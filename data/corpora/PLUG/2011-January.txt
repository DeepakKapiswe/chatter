Subject: [PLUG] laptop, eSATAp, bare drive
Message-ID: <20110101164337.GA10291@gate.kl-ic.com>

I like to back up my laptop hard drive overnight when I am on the
road - a dd copy to an identical drive.  That worked with PATA and
thinkpad ultrabays.  Not with SATA, though (long story).

Moving 500GB in 6 hours requires a fast connection - 190Mb/s 
sustained rate.  USB with overhead probably doesn't do it. 
I would rather not carry a case and a power adapter.  And the
drives will get bigger.

With the newer laptop, it looks like the optimum setup, in theory,
would be an expresscard34 "eSATAp" aka "powered eSATA" aka "USB/SATA"
card, to a cable that connects directly to the back of a 2.5 inch
SATA drive.  The SYBA SY-EXP50028 (at Newegg and Amazon) has the
right form factor, but the JMB360 chipset has bad Linux support.

Another possibility would be a cable with drive connector on one
end, eSATA and USB (for power) at the other end, and a Linux
compatable eSATA expresscard.  Plenty of linux compatable cards,
but I can't find such a cable.  I might be able to make one,
from an eSATA to SATA cable and a SATA-power and USB cable.

Any suggestions, besides waiting for eSATAp to become more widely
available?

Keith

   Yep. The Bytecc USB 2.0 Drive Mate (model BT 300) is powered, handles
neked drives of 3.5" optical/hard flavor, 2.5" PATA flavor, and SATA
flavor. It might not be fast enough for you but I find it fast enough, and
flexible enough, to do all the internal/external transfers I need.

Happy New Year,

Rich

Has anybody here looked into data logging using the sound card or usb?  For
the SW side I looked briefly at xoscope.  It appears not to be suitable for
acquisions at rates in the order of seconds spread over hours.

Anybody here looked into this?  The cheapest approach is likely to use the
sound card and an external chopper to get past the capacitor.  The windows
program daqarta seems to claim all is possible, complete with a chopper
circuit.  It has much more capability, hence complication than needed for
data logging.

I contacted the author of daqarta about Linux.  He said it is written in
assembler, too much work, no market since thIe Linux comunity is mostly
looking for free SW.  He tried wine, but was not successful with minimal
effort.

I checked into xoscope.  I got the impression that it is not set up for the
time scales associated with data logging.

Is there a simple way to interrogate the sound card every second or so
without filling up memory with hours of "sound" file data?

Any other approaches?

Thanks,
-Denis

Denis,

   C-Kermit? I used a c-kermit script to sample both the GPS receiver and the
depth sonar at defined intervals while I drove the boat across the river in
a series of transects. This allowed me to prepare both 3D and contour
bathymetric maps.

   It's been years, but I still have the book. Kermit is a great tool to
communicate with hardware.

Does your pc have traditional serial or parallel ports? You can use them 
as GPIO (general purpose I/O) pins with the help of some basic 
libraries. I used parapin some years ago to do this over a parallel port:

What are you measuring?  You might be okay with something like a
teensy or arduino or some other arduino-clone.  The teensy is kind of
nice because it has good usb-to-chip data flow.

I have an FTDI usb-datai/o thing, which works too.  It has analog and
digital inputs and outputs.

  http://www.dlpdesign.com/usb/io8.shtml

You just send it a query character and it spits back the value as text.

I ran into a problem with the AREF (analog reference), because the
single-board computer I was using, when on battery, didn't necessarily
have 5V on the usb power pin (which powered the thing and also acted
as AREF).  If you can provide a more accurate AREF it should work
fine.

I've used usb to serial and some C code to create a data logger.

I suppose I would try pretty much what you have mentioned.

I sometimes use usb drives, but as you said are slow - and some of
mine are SLOW, SLOW, SLOW as I still have some usb 1 left.

Recently, I bought an inexpensive Toshiba laptop.  I picked it over
several alternatives, because it had one of those USB/SATA ports built
in.  I use it with a normal full size hard disk (large capacity) in a
case that requires external power.  It is a pain to carry, but the
performance is great.  Couldn't be more pleased with it - although it
would be even better if I used a laptop disk and got my power from the
PC some way.  (By the way, I used to use a passport drive that used
two usb connectors - one for the signal and one for power.)

Thanks, Russell.  There is a file there named voltage_now, which seems to
hold a recent voltage.  What system decides when to update that file?  Can I
interrogate whatever writes that file to get more frequent updates? BAT0 is
a link to   BAT0 ->
../../devices/LNXSYSTM:00/LNXSYBUS:00/PNP0A08:00/PNP0C0A:00/power_supply/BAT0,
for whatever that is worth.

I mentioned that I thought the power % reported was faulty.  Perhaps not.
 There are long comments on the web that the eee pc 900 has a battery drain
problem: it is drained even when off (perhaps 14 mA constant!)  I am looking
into that.

The /sys filesystem is a userspace view of various kernel values. For
more information about sysfs, see:

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysfs

So, however often the kernel updates the battery information, that's
how often the value in BAT0 updates.  From a shell, you can run:

  watch -n 1 cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/voltage_now

to get an idea how fast it is updating.  It appears to be every few seconds.

There are some other interesting values in
/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0 too.  Figuring out what units they are
using can sometimes be a challenge.

Rich, did you ever chase this one down?

My first guess is that the DBD bundles are used by all the DBD
backends, and that there are also specific add-ons per backend, but
I'm curious to know if I was right....

Subject: [PLUG] FVX538 seems dead...
Message-ID: <1294139279.10886.10.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

I've noticed that the 8 port built-in switch just doesn't work and the
gigabit port doesn't either which eliminates access the router's web
page to set it up.  Oddly enough, the wan ports seem to be okay as far
as I can tell.  I can only get the test light to turn off by holding the
hardware reset switch down for 10 seconds.  Apparently the Netgear
FVX538 is Linux based internally.  I don't know if this is a hardware
or a software problem, but it appears to be a hardware one.  Any place
I can take this that will repair it for $100 or less?  Much more than
that, it is cheaper to replace.

   Two issues at work here. First, DBD-postgres-2.17.2 would not build here,
but -2.17.1 does and works. Second, the permissions for directories (other
than data) in /usr/local/pgsql/ were incorrect (744 rather than 755, IIRC).

Thanks for asking,

Subject: [PLUG] DVD RAM Drives (and Linux)
Message-ID: <4D233C7D.2000301@cyber-office.net>

I'm looking at DVD RAM drives but have no experience with them other 
than my Panasonic DVR can use (recommends using) them.

As some background I've been fighting the Panasonic for the last few 
months when recording to DVD RWs.  Worked fine for the first few months 
but now I'm having varying levels of success.

I got a gift certificate for the holidays and used it to order DVD RAM 
disks.  They arrive next week so I don't know if they will solve the DVR 
problem but if they do I'd like to experiment with taking the recordings 
from the disk and converting them to another format so I can place them 
on my home network for viewing from other systems around the house.

Doing a Google search I came across very little current discussions on 
using the DVD RAM drives with Linux.  The latest postings I found (2006, 
2009) were mostly positive.
    Anyone on the list used DVD RAM drives with Linux?  What drives, 
kernel, distribution, etc. did you have success (or failures) with?


TIA,
Rod

Subject: [PLUG] Fix FVX538v2 router...
Message-ID: <1294214364.4097.4.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

Using the serial console with no network lines connected, I see redboot
fire up and continue on okay until Loading modules is reached.  This
looks like a Linux system to me.  Any thoughts on what is causing the
8 port switch to not work?  Anyone know who can fix this?  The router
is fairly expensive to replace and I don't particularly enjoy the notion
of just throwing it out.  If it is replaced, I think a Cisco unit is a
better idea even if it does cost more.

Since this is Linux based, is there anything a dual core micro itx
computer can't do that this Netgear router can?  How is the router
allowing dhcp from the Internet modem while at the same time maintaining
a separate network that may or not be dhcp configured and routing
between them?  As far as the VPN features, what is the best Linux distro
to use?

This is all stuff that Linux can do with tools that come with it.

The key is that it has two separate interfaces. Let's call them eth0 and
eth1. If you run DHCP client on eth0, and DHCP server on eth1, you're
already most of the way there.

Just configure some routes between interfaces and you have an official Linux
Router.

I need to spend a few days in Canada, and I was looking for technology to
help reduce the cost of calling home.......hey, it worked for ET!

Anyway, I have a google phone on T-Mobile. The costs for
calling/texting/data is outrageous...

$0.69/minute voice
$10/MB data
$0.20/text message
$0.49/minute for any voice mails (ie if I am notified I have a voice mail, I
get charged, whether I listen to it or not!)

I was told by Tmo that any VoIP would fall under the $10/MB data charge.
Does anyone know if this is true?

Any Android gurus have a technical solution that would help reduce these
costs?

Thanks,

Mark

If data costs that much, then any internet-based solution over the
cell phone netowrk is clearly going to be expensive.  You might try
borrowing free wifi networks and doing VoIP/email over those.  That
should be close to free (though you might need to buy a coffee at the
local shoppe).  The combination of VoIP and WiFi might also drain
batteries fast.  Not sure.

If the system does it's own monitoring to do the shutdown then you
will need a signal
handler to catch the shutdown and/or term signal to go record record a
reading and flush your buffers.

The system does the shutdown.  You are saying that the system will NOT
bother with dirty buffers; that if the system shuts down due to running out
of battery power any applications running are on their own.

This may explain a failure I had with this machine shortly after I received
it:  I ran it 'till it shut down.  When it came back up the some parts of X
were hosed.  There are other explanations for the failure, but this may top
the list if in fact the system behaves as you say.

I will have a bash loop running.  All I would need to do is force a write to
the disk in the loop as it nears the shutdown voltage.  How do I force a
write?

Thanks,

If the system shuts down in an orderly fashion (which it should do if
you are running a power manager that shuts it down rather than quite
literally just running out of batteries?) it will flush the buffers
before doing so.  the signal handler that larry mentioned is something
you can put into your script, since again as the system shuts down
normally all programs are warned before they are killed, and as a
result of the warning you could choose to sync your files.

however, your ssd saves you some worry here--just sync the file every
time you write it.  use a command called 'sync' that you can add to
the script generating the file.  since there is no disk spinup cost
[of power usage] (the major reason not to sync constantly on a laptop)
and you are very concerned with getting all the data saved, i'd just
do it every time you write the file.  or every 5th time.  or whatever.

it's not supposed to shut down like someone hit the power switch for 4
seconds.  my eeepc running ubuntu goes into hibernation at around 5%
battery remaining.  of course even hibernation will run the battery
down eventually (takes about 36 hours on mine from the 5% full
mandatory shutdown point).  i'm gonna blame the blinking LED's =)

'sync'

Subject: [PLUG] How to make my laptop look like a USB charger?
Message-ID: <20110107000907.GK1181@eehouse.org>

I have a Dell laptop running Ubuntu and a Virgin Mobile "MiFi"
cellular wifi hotspot.  The MiFi is great but for one bug: when you
plug its USB cable into the laptop to charge it stops being a hotspot,
so you have to carry a separate USB wallwart to charge it.

I'm pretty sure this is unnecessary -- that if I could get my laptop
to pretend to be a mere USB wallwart I could prevent the loss of wifi.
Googling on the subject turns up instructions for fixing this by
disabling USB Mass Storage mode on windows thus:

# KB823732 explains how you can disable USB device support by changing
# the Start value of
# HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\UsbStor to 4

The closest I could think to try on GNU/Linux was to prevent the
usb_storage module from loading, but this didn't work.  The MiFi still
shuts down, meaning it's been signalled in some way by the laptop.

Can anybody suggest how to do this, or where to read or ask for
further information?  I'm happy to hack the drivers if that's what
it's going to take.  It's apparently possible to fix this by removing
the two inner contacts from a USB cable end, but I don't want to carry
a second cable either -- if I can avoid it.

Thanks,

--Eric

The inner contacts are the data lines, and the outer contacts are
power.  I'm not sure of the data lines even exist on a wall wart.  The
USB standard requires that initialization happens within milliseconds
of connecting the cable, and some of that has to happen before the
computer even knows that it's a USB Mass storage device.  Depending on
how the MiFi device responds to this disabling USB Mass Storage might
be too late.  Have you confirmed that it actually works in Windows?
Modern Linux will typically load this driver automatically as soon as
it's detected, and in some cases may be built into the kernel rather
than loaded on use.

On my ubuntu system the place to prevent loading the driver would be.
/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

by adding
blacklist usb_storage

And possibly rebooting, but there is usually a way to avoid that with linux.

Though if the driver is compiled into the kernel instead of build as a
loadable module this won't work.  I think in that case you can disable
it with a kernel boot option, or rebuild the kernel.

I can't test it because it would kill my keyboard, but how about unloading
the lower level usb driver usbcore.
Some other modules might depend on usbcore so they will have to be unloaded
also. If you need them this will not work.

I would suggest using udev to prevent USB storage from being 
associated with the device.  If you specifically match the vendor and 
product ID, you wouldn't have to kill off storage support for other 
devices.  Note that I haven't actually done this myself, this just 
where *I* would start.

My initial impulse is along Daniel's lines.  Get a USB extension cable
and snip the data lines.  That way, the laptop doesn't see the mifi
and the mifi doesn't see the laptop, just this stream of electrons
zinging up one of the wires.

No.  That's the first thing I tried.  Another reply suggested
disabling the core USB module, which I *can* do on my laptop, but that
doesn't help either.

BTW, the MiFi presents itself as an ISO 9600 FS -- i.e. it looks like
a CD-ROM to Ubuntu.  I'm not even sure what the point of that is, but
then I haven't looked at what files are there -- and can't or I'll
lose the connection over which I'm writing this. :-)

No.  That's an excellent question/idea.  Before I chase this much
further I'll find myself a windows box.

I did that, and confirmed with lsusb that it was not being loaded.  If
I rmmod'd it and did not add it to the blacklist it would get reloaded
when I connected the USB cable, but with the blacklist mod that was
prevented.  Wifi still shuts down, though.

Subject: [PLUG] Question on Ubuntu repositories
Message-ID: <1294369110.8845.6.camel@ileanna>

I can't find a way to output a list of ALL Ubuntu repositories to
stdout.  The apt/get/sources.list does not show added third party
repositories like googleearth and the like. I can see them with the
Software Sources app or through Synaptic but there seems to be no way to
treat the entire repository list  as text, only as a graphical
screenshot file. Apt seems to have no "list" feature.  

I want a text file of the entire repository list to save so I can cut 'n
paste the desired third party additions to later installs 

 Is there another file for added third party repositories?

Maybe I'm missing something really basic here.  Any help?  

Thanx 

Word Wizard

They should all be found in

* /etc/apt/sources.list

and then in the files in

* /etc/apt/sources.list.d/

Specifically, the third party ones will be in the latter.

Have you tried Scotch Tape?  Place a small bit in the connector to cover the
two center contacts and plug it in.  This is the equivalent of the Power
Only cable.  It sounds like you don't ever use it for data anyway so there
would be little drawback on this.

I had a feeling it was something simple  and basic I was missing. That

I chased this around when I first got my MiFi and remember it actually 
being in the MiFi.  When it detects power (and data?) it shuts the data 
functionality off.
   Can't remember all the details or even where I found them because I 
never took the plunge.  Besides at the time everything I found indicated 
it, the MiFi, wouldn't work plugged in to a Linux box so I've stuck with 
using it as a wireless access point.
    Though the thing that sticks in my mind it there was some way to 
jumper some of the lines that tricked the MiFi into charging and still 
working as a connectivity device.

Have you checked the Manufacturer's site?  They sometimes have postings 
from users about non-supported usage or modifications.

Last night at the meeting someone (I forget who and what the context
was) mentioned some issues with regard to non-profits having "Donate
Here" buttons on their sites with PayPal (and I forget *what* the
issue was... I'd do terrible in a line-up, wouldn't I? :-)

Well, I got on this morning and found that *all* of the non-profits
I'm involved with are doing this. So I was wondering if whoever it was
last night could email me (off list, unless someone else felt it was
pertinent to have it on-list) some links with information and some of
the details?

It was me that mentioned it.  Our paypal account was frozen on January
3rd.  We were alerted to this by paypal in an email with vague
requests for more information.  The email pointed to a Resolution
Center page, and that page pointed back at the email.  Attempts to be
responsive via the web interface did not provide any obvious
indication that they'd been acknowledged.  I sent an email instead
with explanatory information and pointing at documentation of our
non-profit status.  We were promised a response within 72 hours (which
would be today sometime).  I haven't seen it yet.  I may try calling
later today.

>From googling a phrase from the email, it appears that the issue that
prompted this was our use of a Donate button.  It seems they want the
use of the Donate button to be exclusively for tax-deductible
donations.  However, we are a tax-exempt 501c3 public charity, so we
*should* be okay with their arbitrary policy.

Hello Everyone

Could someone please share with me a snip of Perl code to take a line
like:


K:\SDan\Iint
Genomics\Spereira\Technology\metrix\07MA7\Mouse\20070305.CEL

And give an output file like:

K:\SDan\Iint Genomics\Spereira\Technology\metrix\07MA7\Mouse\
20070305.CEL

Where whatever is taken after the  last "\" is taken as the filename and
the filename is tab separated into a new column from the original line!
Thanks
Dan

You could use regular expression like the following to separate the
path from the filename:
$line =~ m/(.*)\\([^\\]*)$/ && print "$1\t$2"

Or you could just find and replace the last '\' with a tab...
$line =~ s/\\([^\\]*)$/\t\1/ && print $line

If you provide a kickstart file you can point it to the repository via the
url --url=http://x.x.x.x/path_to_repo

You can also add additional repos to be accessed during the install via
repo --name=<repo_name> --baseurl=

If you created your own repo it will need the groups file from the DVD to
create the repodata info.

MySQL will also fail because of an empty list so it's not just
PostgreSQL.  SQLite will not fail.

>From SQLite's website (http://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html#in_op):
"Note that SQLite allows the parenthesized list of scalar values on
the right-hand side of an IN or NOT IN operator to be an empty list
but most other SQL database database engines and the SQL92 standard
require the list to contain at least one element."

Question-

Is there a particular reason you are trying to install Fedora 9, which is
wayyyyy beyond End Of Life (maybe I missed something from earlier, sorry)?
Fedora is on 14 now.  They support N-1 releases.

My point is, they probably did fix the installer, with F10 or a patch to F9,
or something, but that too is now way out of date.

Unless you have a very particular reason to support an existing install of
an old version, or really need this old one for some particular need,
you might want to look into the newer versions.


Also- you are talking about using the DVD image, yet your subject line is
talking about the net install.  Which one are you trying to use?
If you want to install from DVD, boot the DVD image directly.  Or you could
mount the DVD on another machine, host it as NFS or HTTP, and
do the net-install from that (and follow the other suggestions posted).

Anyway HTH

A couple months ago, Michael was trying to install Fedora 9 and the
reason cited at the time was newer versions of Fedora did not support
his i586-based CPU.  It does appear, however, that Fedora 11 might
support i586.  i686 and above was started with Fedora 12:
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/F12X86Support

I agree.  He might have better luck trying Fedora 11...however...

I would never recommend Fedora 11, or even Fedora 9 as they are both
no longer supported; no security updates are being released for these
versions of the distro.  He might have better luck trying to find out
what version of CentOS will install on i586 and see if that's still
supported...

...or failing that, switch to another distribution that does still
support his architecture (Debian?) or give in and upgrade to newer
hardware.

Michael, if you are unfamiliar with setting up and working with a
distro other than Fedora, it might be worth stopping by the clinic on
the 16th for some hands on support.

CentOS 5 states it support i586 but there was a recent thread
complaining about this
support.  It cannot be installed on anything less than i686.

Some alternatives exist for accepting donations outside of PayPal.
Might be worth having a look if PayPal hasn't responded yet.

A quick Google search on alternatives returned a company named "WePay"
(wepay.com).  I haven't had any direct experience with them, but they
do employ Rasmus Lerdorf, who helped created the PHP programming
language and is a regular contributor back to the open-source
community.  Anyone know of other alternatives worth looking into?

I wouldn't be trying to install Fedora 9 unless I had a very good reason
and supporting i586 machine is a good reason.

I have the DVD, but even when I use an external writer I can't install
from it.  I get to about 84% or so and the drive fails.

I have an old DVD reader on the machine, but it doesn't read later DVDs.

Maybe if I poke around on OSU's site I can figure out what's missing...

Most viruses are targeted toward Adobe reader and Windows.  I'm not
sure I'd worry too much if you keep your system up to date and are
using a reader such as evince or okular.  If you still have your
doubts...

1. You could upload the file to Google Docs and then view the PDF as HTML.
2. You could use a command like 'pdftotext' or 'pdftohtml' to extract
the meat of the content.
3. You could use Google Chrome's new built-in PDF viewer which is
supposed to render PDFs to HTML and do so within a sandbox.
4. You could just delete the file.

Sorry Keith, I think I misinterpreted what you were asking.  Although
not explicitly stated, it sounds like you might want to double-check
that the file is virus free before redistributing it, or do something
to the file to guarantee it is.

If you're not interested in converting the file from a PDF to
something else and back again, there's a couple other virus scanners I
know of you could try:
1. http://www.kaspersky.com/scanforvirus
2. Send the file to yourself with Gmail or another webmail solution
that has a built-in virus scanner.  When you view the email it should
perform a virus scan on the PDF.

   This works only when the pdf has been generated from a text creating

 i tried a quick google to find the article i learned about this tool 
 from, because it actually gave a walkthrough of its use for precisely 
 the situation you describe. i couldn't find the article i remembered, 
 but the utility, pdf-tools, should provide you with all the capabilities 
 you need to investigate a pdf file for potential malware traits. the 
 didier stevens guy's website actually covers some techniques for 
 analyzation, and lists some common attributes to search for.

 http://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/pdf-tools/

 a simpler way to know may just be the contents of the pdf, if you can 
 convert it into flat text file, you should be safe to comfortably browse 
 the contents to determine if the pdf is at all related to the topic of 
 the wiki. if it's not, it has no place there regardless of whether or 
 not it contains malware, and i would be pretty confident at that point 
 that it probably is.

Subject: [PLUG] battery voltage reported by system
Message-ID: <AANLkTimuwxJ5zTqfD=_fXDz5Lj6=4AEZWw52YkAavG8W@mail.gmail.com>

At Russell's suggestion, I have looked at the value reported in
/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/voltage_now.
 On a fully charge battery it reported 7880000. As the system shut down due
to low voltage it reported 5933000.  The values change in increments of
9000.   I assume the reported values are in microvolts.  The battery is
rated at 7.4 volts.

Is it possible that these values are actually what the battery is producing,
or is it likely that there is a calibration error?

BTW, the other values in BAT0 (current, charge, etc.) do not change, so I
assume that the system is not measuring those.

Anybody know where any of the details of these system measurements is
documented?

Thanks,

-Denis

I have a few questions:

1) My understanding is that viruses contained in PDFs are javascript,
inasmuch as recent PDF versions allow javascript to be embedded. True
or not? Is there any other way to write malware into a PDF?

2) The code is executed only when the recipient opens the PDF, and it
must be opened only in Adobe Reader and a version prior to 9.0, or
Foxit Reader, more than a year old. Correct? Are there other readers
that can execute the code?

3) As far as I know there have been only two viruses so far. One
inserts the malware code into all the PDFs it finds on the computer,
and the other spams itself to every address it finds in Outlook. Is
this correct, or do I need further education?

I think it is because your "ISP" has it's main office in Seattle or gets 
its IPs from someone in Seattle.  If you do a reverse lookup (rDNS) on 
the IP you're assigned you will probably see some thing that indicates 
teh Seattle area.

   I'm sitting in Hayden, Idaho but my service provider is in Spokane so 
my IP (block) looks like it is in Spokane.

A quick follow up.  I tried the link on the book page and it actually

Do you remember the Google wifi capture that their streetview cars did?
Most of the location providers use the physical presence of wifi networks as
part of how they locate sites.

They also use the Android phones to feed back this sort of location data, so
they can compute location mappings and all. Apple presumably do the same
with their phones, too.

SkyHook, one of the competing groups, actually have a little form where you
can submit your network details and location to vimprove their database.

None of those methods would require any browser
interaction at all.? 
My IP address would give me away.? 
For that matter my browser thinks I'm at 192.168.8.32 - private range
address.

I'm going to redo this with a sniffer and see what the

Thanks!  This is exactly what I needed.  I've already poked around at
the .xml file so it'll be a cinch to do.

BTW, do you know what happens if I screw up the xml file?  I can

Do you mean that the browser could calculate the location without
asking for permission?  Absolutely, and it is only courtesy from the
browser authors that mean that they do, which is worth keeping in
mind.  I don't believe that, for example, the CoreLocation service
from Apple requires permission requests to do this sort of geolocation
in OS-X.

HTML content, of course, can only do what the browser permits because
it doesn't have a direct bridge to run native code, which means it
can't read the visible wireless network list or anything like that.
(Absent security violations and the like, of course. :)

Your IP address, though, is much more error prone: it will give you a
city-scale location, typically, rather than a street address location
which you can obtain through wifi or cell sniffing (if you have a big
enough database of device locations that you trust and the processing
power to search it).

Subject: [PLUG] Fixed T60 slow ultrabay problem
Message-ID: <20110110181858.GA10353@gate.kl-ic.com>

Not a problem, but perhaps this will help someone else.

Background: My Thinkpad T60 has a 500GB SATA drive.  When
I travel with it, I bring along an identical 500GB drive
in an Ultrabay swap tray for backups.  I could dd copy the
main drive to the swap drive in about 3 hours, overnight.

Then something went wrong.  On the last trip, it took >4 days.
hdparm -t for the main drive is 50MB/s .  The Ultrabay drive
ran at an abysmal 1.3MB/s.  I could not set dma mode with
hdparm -d1 .  After some failed debugging, I ordered a SATA
enclosure and Expressbus SATA card, which will arrive today.

  Last night, I found the problem.  The BIOS settings
  for the SATA controller somehow got changed from AHCI
  mode to Compatability mode.  When I set the BIOS to AHCI,
  hdparm -t went back to 79MB/sec.  Back to 3 hours.  

Some windoze folks have problems with AHCI unless they load
the right Intel drivers.  So the default is Compatability
mode, even if it makes the Ultrabay slow as hell.  BTW, the
T60 Ultrabay actually has a PATA interface, and the swap tray
has a translator chip to SATA in it.  Kludge!  The newer
Thinkpads feed both SATA and PATA to the Ultrabay, IIRC.

I expect the SATAII connection will be quite a bit faster,
since I will be using different buses to stream the data
from drive to drive.  But since the goal was to back up the
drive overnight when travelling, shaving the time under 3
hours is not an urgent need.  Maybe faster will be needful
when I upgrade to >1TB laptop drives, though I'm using
"only" 140GB now.

Under the Hood

There are a few common ways to get location information. The most  common
are local WiFi networks, IP address information, and attached GPS  devices. In
Firefox 3.5 we use local WiFi networks and IP address  information to try and
guess your location.

There are a few companies that drive cars around listening for WiFi  access
points spots and recording the access point&rsquo;s signal strength at a 
specific point on the planet. They then throw all of this collected  data into
a big database. Then they have algorithms that allow you to  ask the question
&ldquo;If I see these access points, where am I?&rdquo;. This is  Firefox
3.5&prime;s primary way of figuring out your location.

But not everyone has a WiFi card. And not every place has been  scanned for
WiFi. In that case Firefox will use your local IP address to  try to figure
out your location using a reverse database lookup that  roughly maps your IP
address to a location. IP derived locations often  have much lower accuracy
than a WiFi derived location. As an example,  here in Toronto, a location from
WiFi is accurate to within 150 meters.  The same location using just an IP
address is about 25 km. 

END of QUOTE

I can confirm/deny that explanation by checking to see
if FF does a query out to that database.

Typically there are a half
dozen WiFi nets visible from home.? Combine them with two hops of
traceroute to determine my global IP (nat) and the software has a lots of
clues to work from.

That's a great XKCD.  And yes, I also cringe whenever I hear the word
"sanitize" in relation to input validation.  It implies to me that you
should somehow cleanse the data and then use it.  That's always a
recipe for disaster... if the data looks fishy, just reject it.

Subject: [PLUG] Caution on RHEL 6 on Laptops
Message-ID: <1294694445.31125.55.camel@Maui>

Folks, 

I know a number of people here run RHEL (or rebuilds such as CentOS) on
their systems -- wanted to share a problem I've apparently had on my
T410 / 500G hard drive since I installed RHEL 6. I reported it at
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=667485 

Bottom line, I think a default RHEL 6 setting caused my hard drive to
fail in less than 2 months

-- adding 200,000 cycles in that time (as defined by the smartctl
-a /dev/sda | grep Load_Cycle_Count command)

When I ran normal recovery stuff on that drive, the problems were
essentially limited to the partition with the RHEL 6 top-level root
directory.

If I understand correctly, 200,000 cycles shouldn't by itself cause a
drive failure, but I'm guessing the way the cycles were focused on hte
RHEL 6 partition contributed to the failure. Perhaps I'm
misunderstanding something about hdparm and cycles, I don't know.

I think a similar bug for Ubuntu was discussed here a while back, which
I cited in the bugzilla.

I've read some stuff that suggests the problem might be limited to
certain hard drives (e.g. Hitachi), and is a problem on laptops because
of power save schemes.

Since I installed a new drive, I've had some success reducing the number
of cycles with each of the following commands:

hdparm -B 200 /dev/sda
hdparm -B 254 /dev/sda

Not sure which is better, but if you have RHEL 6 or a rebuild on your
laptop, I'm guessing either should help.

Thanks,
Mike

Uh ... no.  The SATAII stuff arrived.  While hdparm -t for the
SATA2 interface says 90.7 MB/s, the dd command runs at 50.7 MB/s
with the SATA2 hardware, as opposed to 47.7 MB/s with the Ultrabay
and translator.   So my expectation was false.  Or perhaps there
is a faster way to run "dd" than merely setting the blocksize to
8M (handling the data in larger chunks tends to save time).

Or maybe a newer kernel will help.  I am running an RHEL5.5
clone with the 2.6.18-164.2.1.el5 kernel.  When RHEL6.1 comes
out (RHEL6 just released), that will have the 2.6.32 kernel.  

The Ultrabay and drive weighs 7 ounces, while the SATA2 card
and enclosure and cables and drive weighs 13 ounces.  Sigh. 
6 (fragile) travel ounces to save 10 minutes.  I will stay
with the Ultrabay.

However, the SATA hardware will still be handy for drive copies
when booted from a live CD (the CD drive uses the Ultrabay).
Or if a new kernel breaks the AHCI drivers.  Or if I want to
play a movie off a hard drive.

The brands I ended up with were:

  enclosure:   Eagle Consus M-Series ET-CS2XMESU2-BK
  expresscard: BestConnectivity (SYBA) SD-EXP40014 Sil3132 chip

The enclosure powers from two USB plugs.  It claims to be
"tool-less", but you need to poke into a hole with a screwdriver
or paperclip to open it.  Everything Just Worked after a reboot.

Well, it didn't override the defaults set by the drive manufacturer,
which in turn led to that: at best, a failure to act on a stupid
default by RH, rather than something they actively did.

The real blame sits with the hard disk or laptop BIOS vendor, and I
mention this because it is highly likely that you will encounter the
same situation regardless of which distribution you are using.

    Daniel

This sounds vaguely familiar.

My T61 has a SATA II controller, but to ensure compatibility with
drives of other types that a user might put in an Ultrabay adapter
Lenovo decided to throttle it to 100 MB/s. From information I gathered
on the Thinkpad e-list this was lame, but there you are.

I have a fast 320 GB SATA II drive in the Thinkpad, and a slower 500 GB
SATA II that I mounted in the Ultrabay. I use the Ultrabay drive for
backups, and it's slow, although not nearly as slow as yours before you
fixed the BIOS setting. It takes about an hour to use rdiff-backup to
copy the 220 GB on the main drive; longer or shorter depending on how
many new files there are to back up.

John,

   Consider using dirvish for your backups. It is based on rsync and each
'snapshot' backup is only the differences in existing files plus any new
files. Runs very quickly.

Fair enough. 

However, as I documented in the bug report, Ubuntu dealt with this issue
a couple of years ago, I think using hdparm -B 200 to override such
default settings. Thus the question -- should Red Hat have dealt with
this too, or is it appropriate for them to be more "hands off" (than
Ubuntu) w/r/t relatively common hardware components.

Thanks,
Mike

I have already considered dirvish. I'm not smart enough to run dirvish.
Besides, rdiff-backup does much the same thing and is just as fast. The
only reason it usually takes an hour is because I only run a backup
when I have created work that is important to save. Sometimes weeks go
by where I have no significant production. In fact, some might say I
have never produced anything significant. 

I use a thumb drive as a temporary quick backup medium if I am working
on something. When I finish the project I insert the Ultrabay drive and
run rdiff-backup. I've been doing it this way for decades and I have
never yet lost a file. Keith and I have an understanding: I think he is
overly cautious and he thinks I am a fool. There may be some truth in
both opinions. But for sure, neither of us is likely to change the
other.

Nah, not really ? it sounds like you have found the sustained transfer
rate of the drive, rather than the burst transfer rate.  (The link
rate in SATA 1 was enough for anything production until SSD made a big
showing, and SATA 2 is still has some headroom compared to the
non-enterprise stuff.)

The box will do what is known in the industry as clear qam digital.
This is similar to
the astc broadcast hdtv.  This means that anything that you could use
as a digital tv without
a cable box the HomeRunHD will receive.
Silicondust announced a new box with three tuners and cablecard
support last year.  Their site seems to
indicate they are now in testing certification process for these.

Here in Corvallis, the only unencrypted channels are the super basic ones,
like local broadcast. There might be a total of 10-15 channels that aren't
encrypted, if I remember right. Not many, anyway. Most of the channels on
the "extended basic" cable in my apartment are in fact encrypted and I need
a box to decode them.

I believe several members of NILUG here in North Idaho use the HomeRuns 
but my take is it is best for OTA broadcasts.  They use it in 
conjunction with Myth and LinuxMCE boxes.
    No one has mentioned using it with cable.  Most are more than happy 
with getting the 19+ some odd broadcast channels in the area.  I haven't 
had cable in 20+ years but I remember needing a "cable" box to decode 
the signal(s).

I posted, after reading the above but not testing it, that this was
exactly what I wanted.  Having tested it, however, I must retract.  It
turns out that not all MiFi devices are created equal.  The Virgin
Wireless one I have doesn't even have the XML element referenced in
the above article in its config file.  Adding it doesn't help; the
device deletes it, presumably because it's unrecognized.  Bottom line
by my experience and some more targeted googling (thanks to having the
name of the element) is that the Verizon version of the MiFi supports
this and the Virgin one does not.  I'm not sure about Sprint.

The recommended best solution for Virgin is to make or buy a
power-only USB cable.  I'm going to try hacking udev config files
before I go that route.

Oh, and one other note.  A friend with the same device/carrier got
this working by changing the <poweronconnect> element from 0 to 1.
But it stopped working after he rebooted and he can't make it work
again.  So either he's wrong about the wifi having worked (his laptop
may have been clever enough to set up ethernet-over-usb) or he was
taking advantage of a bug in the device that might be exploitable
again.

Thanks,

--Eric

Subject: [PLUG] convert video to cheap handheld player
Message-ID: <20110113060645.GA26766@gate.kl-ic.com>

I bought a NAXA NMV-155 "digital audio and video player" at BiMart.
Real Cheap, $20, as an experiment.  A surprising number of things
work, sorta kinda.  It claims to be compatable with "Linux 9 and
above" which I assume means Redhat 9 (2003).  

The device has a 320x240 video camera in it, and I can record
videos.  I can connect it to my Linux laptop as a USB drive,
and play the camera videos with mplayer.  20 frames per second,
16000 samples/sec audio.  I can rename and copy the videos back.

What I can't do, so far, is use ffmpeg to reformat another video
so it will play on the NAXA.  I get a "File format error".  The
one difference I can see from the camera video is that the ffmpeg
output contains " Clip info: Software: Lavf52.31.0" according to
mplayer.

An example of the camera video from the device is at
   http://keithl.com/naxa.avi

Any suggestions (not involving Windows or trash cans)?  

Keith

Googling on "Lavf52.31.0" turned up a lot of hits. I didn't check them
out, but maybe one of them has a solution. 

I have never used ffmpeg to convert anything. I have used Avidemux, but
it usually doesn't do what I want. I have had pretty good luck fixing
and converting things with Kino, however. Kino has many, many export
options, and I don't understand even a tenth of them.

I would try idvid on a video created by your box.

For example on a file created by an ADVC-110 A to D converter it yields:

idvid u1999-001.dv
--------------------------------
idvid
Video identification script
Part of the tovid suite, version 0.31
http://www.tovid.org
--------------------------------
Analyzing file: 'u1999-001.dv'. This may take several minutes...
=========================================================
               File: u1999-001.dv
              Width: 720 pixels
             Height: 480 pixels
       Aspect ratio: 1.33:1
             Frames: 8738
           Duration: 00:04:51 hours/mins/secs
          Framerate: 29.970 frames per second
       Video format: dvsd
      Video bitrate: 28771224 bits per second
---------------------------
Audio track 1 (Stream 0.1, AID 0):
---------------------------
              Codec: pcm_s16le
            Bitrate: 0000 bits per second
      Sampling rate: 48000 Hz
=========================================================
Audio is compliant with the following formats:
  Not compliant with (S)VCD or DVD
Video is compliant with the following formats:
  Not compliant with (S)VCD or DVD
This video does not seem to be compliant with (S)VCD or DVD
standards. If you burn it to a video disc, it may not work.
=========================================================

Assuming the input and ouput formats are the same for your NAXA, you can
then work on getting your video into that format using ffmpeg or something.

Good Luck -- Pat

Thanks for the pointer, that helped.  The current version of
tovid (http://tovid.org) calls this function with "tovid id"
but otherwise works like you say.

After more frobbing, I ran across "mencoder", part of the mplayer
suite, and that is the tool that worked.  INCREDIBLY COMPLEX to
use optimally, but I managed with:

mencoder  <infile> -ofps 20 -vf scale=320:240 -ovc xvid \
  -oac mp3lame -xvidencopts bitrate=687 -o <outfile.avi>

Again, that is NOT OPTIMAL, just cargo-cult cut-and-paste options,
but at least it outputs a video that the player likes.  Now I can 
learn more and optimize, build some conversion scripts for my wife
(who this is for), etc.

BTW, it turns out that many of the converters for these cheap 
player devices are based on mencoder, often ripping off and
obscuring the open source code.

...

More surprisingly - I started up Windows 2000 under vmware, 
intending to install the "AVIconverter" windows program on the
miniCD that came with the player on the Win2K pseudodisk .  
The disk popped up a window, but I did not notice that it was
a Gnome window, and clicked install.exe .

Which automagically installed the windows program under Wine.
And it works under Wine, though like many programs it uses
teensy-tiny characters on my 2048x1536 laptop screen.  I 
imagine there is a gnome window zoom tool that might fix that.

For now I will stay with the command line mencoder, wrapped in
a shell script that is easier to automate.  The conversions take
a long time, so it is probably better to batch them up overnight.

I haven't messed with Linux From Scratch in a few years so I can't
tell you specifically where you may have gone wrong there... But more
generally, execvp is from "unistd.h" which is part of libc and should
have been installed with the rest of your GNU C Library headers.

I'd double check that you have your GNU C Library dev suite installed,
because chances are that's what you're missing...

I'm trying to rebuild glibc for LFS and am noticing when I go to make

mv -f /home/lfs/glibc-build/tls.makeT /home/lfs/glibc-build/tls.make
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/lfs/glibc-2.11.1'

The latter repeats over and over and over again.

It's third sunday, Linux Clinic starts at 1PM, in the conference
room at Free Geek.

Except John Jordan can't find his Freegeek key.  We may have a
dozen disappointed people.  Can anyone help him?

John's cell is 503-957-0656

And if there is a kindly key-toting volunteer without rainworthy
transportation, I'm heading to Portland now, in my trusty Subaru.
You can try calling me at 971-570-5542, though I will not answer
while driving, and my hearing is not very good even when parked.

Your help and patience are appreciated!

Subject: [PLUG] Having Problems with Xsane
Message-ID: <AANLkTim7_TYQpqwbx-Z+HpLnX08y5_er_mG3tVVmWxsb@mail.gmail.com>

I have an hp L7688 all in one printer/scanner/fax on my network. I am
running Debian testing on my computer. I have been able to control the
scanner in this printer for years from my computer - it always works out of
the box by installing hpaio, which I have done on several other machines.
Recently, probably due to an update/upgrade dance (?), xsane no longer
recognizes the scanner; it only finds my video camera (which it found since
first installing the camera with the scanner). hpaio and xsane-hpaio are
installed (the backends for this printer/scanner). When I run scanimage -L,
only the video camera is found. Anyone have any suggestions on how to
troubleshoot what packages are missing so I can get my scanner back?

Thanks,

Mark

Makes sense to me. Thanks.

Because I wasn't paying attention. Using Thunderbird, when I start 
typing in a name in the To: line, T-bird will finish it for me and offer 
other possibilities. It used to be that when I started typing PLUG, it 
finished the line with PLUG List <plug at lists.pdxlinux.org>. For some 
reason, now it's putting Plug-talk ahead of Plug. Alerted to the 
problem, I'll pay more attention in the future.

Thanks again to all who responded.

Subject: [PLUG] Configuring Apache modules for better security
Message-ID: <20110121175541.GA31611@gate.kl-ic.com>

I have an apache server with about 7 virtual hosts, some wikis,
some mailing lists, some svn code repositories.  Sorta just grew.  

I'm cleaning up the config, removing stuff I don't really need.
Ivan Ristic's book "Apache Security" has been helpful, and he
makes many good suggestions, such as minimizing the modules
loaded.  Sounds good, my apache config loads way too many
modules.  But it is unclear which modules are actually being
used by my web apps.  Is there an easy way to find out? 
Or do I just try all the features of all the apps,
while pulling out modules and looking for breakage? [1]

What I am using:  moinmoin (python) with jsmath and some
passworded access, mailman with pipermail (python), svn with
viewcvs (python).  A few home-made Perl scripts, some of
which interface to some C++ number crunching programs.  All
the Python and Perl stuff is running with mod_cgi, not
mod_perl nor mod_python.  No PHP.  Some rewriting rules and
redirects.  I have nightly backups for years, so breakage and
security problems are fixable.  I will be using HTTPS for
access to a new wiki.


Any suggestion for a minimum set of modules, or perhaps a pointer to
a discussion of module dependencies for common website CGI programs?

HTTPS plus wiki or wikis?  Unless something has changed, it's not 
possible to share an IP among virtual hosts that are using HTTPS.

Subject: [PLUG] IE drops below 50%
Message-ID: <20110121184808.GA31732@gate.kl-ic.com>

Around September 2010, Internet Exploder\\\rer dropped below 50%
share, as reported by StatCounter.  Most of that is due to Chrome,
now at 15% share.  Firefox has been holding around 30% to 31% .
W3Counter and Wikimedia report lower statistics for IE.  If
current trends continue, IE will be in third place by late 2012.

Maybe, finally, web developers will produce HTML that is standards
compliant, rather than IE compliant.  Perhaps this will also spur
Gnash development - when it becomes more useful than Adobe Flash
Player, Gnash can be bundled with Chromium and maybe Chrome, making
Chrome even more open source.

you can have multiple virtual hosts, just not multiple SSL certificates. If
the cert covers more than one hostname, there's no reason you can't use it
for all of them. you used to have to buy wildcard certificates for cubic
dollars, but nowadays they have "alternate names" that works well for this
purpose.

I will be renting another IP address from my provider for that,
perhaps using the same instance of apache or second instance. 
IIRC, one instance of apache can connect different IP addresses
to different virtuals.  But a second instance might be better,
because I hope to sell the business using that URL and wiki.

For those not knowing what Galen and I are talking about, HTTPS
requires certificates that validate a particular URL website name.
Browsers get cranky when the reverse DNS (IP address to URL) doesn't
match the one in the certificate, and the TLS/SSL handshake doesn't
proceed correctly.  Without a proper certificate trail, transactions
are subject to DNS spoofing and "man in the middle" attacks.

This will take me up to 3 IP addresses on my server - one is used
to tunnel other protocols through ports 80 (http) and 443 (https)
from sites that block other outbound ports (such as the public
wifi at the hospitals in the Providence system).

I believe the apachectl (or, on Debian-esque systems, apache2ctl) can 
run a syntax check that will warn you when an unknown runtime 
directive is encountered. (If a module isn't loaded, Apache won't know 
about its runtime directives.) So,

1. Make a working copy of your apache config
2. Comment out a module or two (or ten)
3. apachectl -f $WorkingCopy -t

There has been much tech press lately about Google's decision to drop
support for H.264 in upcoming Chrome builds, in favor of WebM (VP8)
and Theora.  See, for example:

http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/Googles-H264-Move-The-Right-Thing-or-the-Worst-Thing-for-Web-Standards-71686.html

I am having a hard time making sense of it all, and developing any
sense of whether this is "good for Linux" or "bad for Linux."  Apple
fanboys (John Gruber, especially) and (from what I can tell) many
Microsofties are unhappy with Google's move.  Some Linux folk seem
pleased; others, not so much.

While I've seen a lot of discussion about whether this move
strengthens or weakens Flash's stranglehold on web video, I've not
seen any mention of what effect (if any) this might have on Gnash or
other open-source implementations of Flash.

Basically, I'm lost.  I just hope we don't go back to the days of some
stuff not working / not being accessible when you're booted into a
Linux OS.

Subject: [PLUG] Comcast dilemna...
Message-ID: <1295647944.16522.12.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

I'm on a double play and I'm only 2 months in.  What can people tell me
about VOIP and the alternatives I have to going with Comcast Digital
Voice?  I've heard about something call Eeks for example.  At $45/month
normal price, Comcast Digital Voice seems expensive.

A question about lower cost Comcast Digital Voice, it is 5 cents a 
minute for what exactly?  I'm debating whether or not to have Comcast
install my Motorola SB6120 now and drop the voice service or go with
lower cost phone service and keep the promotional price for the
Internet?  When a year is up, I'm thinking I can drop digital voice.
Doing the math, I save about $9-$10 a month if I drop Digital Voice
service right now and lose the promotion.  I don't have to cut digital
voice till the end of the promotion in May, but even that option has an
associated cost.

How do I search for devices that will work with Comcast's Digital Voice
service in conjunction with my Motorola SB6120?  What am I looking at
cost wise?  I could wait for another voice modem to show up on Ebay, 
but I have no idea when that will be.

Can anyone describe their experience with Comcast as far as reducing
service goes?

I've already checked with Comcast to see if my cable modem is acceptable
and they have accepted it, so I could ask for a service downgrade now.

It might be easier as far as a second line goes to do something through
the phone company or over DSL.

I have been using Viatalk over the top of FIOS.  The pricing has for
this has dropped
to 10.95 a month with no contract.  The only problem that I had was
when I was using the voip ATA device
outside of my firewall.

Awesome, I'd love to have more information about this.
Sounds like I can replace Comcast Digital Voice service
and use this service instead.

Doug,

I'm the one who was sitting next to you at the Lucky Lab Sunday. 

I stopped by Free Geek on other business today, and while there looked
for an adapter for my laptop. They didn't have anything, although they
did have a silver-twisted FireWire cable that looked identical to the
one you had with you. Cables there are only a buck, but I didn't buy
the silver-twisted cable because we already know it won't get your
scanner connected to my laptop. 

In the meantime, I would suggest that the best route at this point is
for you to find a different computer somewhere that has a FireWire port
that your cable will fit, even if it's a Windows computer. The purpose
is to verify that the scanner and cable are functioning, i.e., it's not
a hardware problem. 

If the scanner does work on another computer, that proves that the
scanner and the cable are OK, but there might still be a hardware
problem with the FireWire card in your computer. To test that, see if
you can borrow another FireWire device. If the other device works fine,
then we'll know that the FireWire card in your computer is functioning
correctly.

The purpose of these suggestions is to eliminate any possibility of
hardware failure. Once we know the hardware is sound, then we can
address the software issues. Software issues are harder to
troubleshoot, so before spending a lot of time on the software it is
more efficient to start by verifying that the hardware is good.

Nothing that is locked to the service provider like Rocket-8 or Vonage.

Grandstream HT-503

There is another service that I have reliable feedback about.
http://www.callcentric.com/

Check the following when you search for other providers:
1) Determine if they do number porting.
2) If they do/provide E911service.
3) What equipment do they support - Like an asterisk.

I use vitelity.net, with an old pc asterisk server.  They have rates
published on their site.  It also works with only a good viop (e.g. $100

TripWire - http://www.tripwire.com/ 
Firefly Technologies - http://firefly.granburyrs.com/ (POS Systems)

these are two great linux/foss centered companies i know that
originate locally. Intel of course, and Yahoo! also has a local branch
(can't ignore their contributions to PHP and Hadoop, even if they don't
have a noticeable voice in OpenSource)

Galois is a local Linux shop (primarily) that has made a lot of OSS
contributions to the Haskell community and runs some pretty cool
public technical seminars :)

http://corp.galois.com/open-source/ and
http://corp.galois.com/blog/category/tech-talks are good places to
learn more.

Full disclosure: yup, I work there. (and had to stop myself from

Almost, but not quite, the same thing. However, I did find a solution.
Instead of saying:

OPEN rec FOR 'SELECT ...'

you want to say:

OPEN rec FOR EXECUTE 'SELECT ...'

Then it works just like Oracle.

Thanks!

Subject: [PLUG] Where Are Suspend/Hibernate Controled?
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1101231117490.5926@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   My Google searches have not been productive so I ask for guidance here.

   Previous portables did not support suspend or hibernate and I never missed
them. The Dell implements them by default and suspend gets in my way when it
shuts the system down in the middle of a long download or disconnects from
the 'Net with an active DHCP lease. I would like to disable both suspend and
hibernate, but be able to turn on either (or both) in the future if I find a
need. I've not yet learned where they are controlled.

   Is the control in the system's BIOS? In the OS (and distribution
specific)? In the window/desktop manager? Or, some place else?

Bruce,

   Thank you. On my Slackware systems I run Xfce. I was able to find the
power settings menu there. Can't turn off suspend or hibernate but I can
increase the inactive time before they are invoked. Two-and-a-half hours
should be sufficiently long. :-)

Much appreciated,

Rich

I am trying to go back to Chapter 5 in LFS 6.6 because exec and all

Unfortunately, the next step in Chapter 5 is to adjust the toolchain
to point to /tools.  I think this is why I'm getting infinite loops.
I need to point to the C libraries on the Fedora 9 system instead.

I bet setting the time to zero means never.

Denis,

   Could be. Or, it could mean to suspend between keystrokes. :-) However,
the machine is not left on and unused for 2.5 hours.

   I'll check with the Xfce mail list and learn what they suggest.

The gnome power manager configuration dialog, accessible from the Xfce
menu (Settings -> Power Management) has an option for "Never" under
'put computer to sleep when inactive for:'

Rogan,

   I didn't see the "Never" option. Also, as I recall, there are different
options for when the machine is running on AC or on its battery. I'll look
again tomorrow when I'll boot it up and look again.

As do I. Galois hosts and maintains the main repositories for the open 
source Glasgow Haskell Compiler (ghc, the canonical Haskell compiler) 
and Hackage, the Haskell CPAN.

Galois engineers have released and maintain several useful Haskell 
libraries:

   http://code.galois.com/cgi-bin/gitweb

Late last year, Galois also released HaLVM, a port of the Haskell 
runtime for barebones Xen, allowing Haskell programs written for the 
HaLVM run natively on Xen, without any intervening operating system.

I have to dispute TW as an "open source" company.

"Both are based on the same code, written by Gene Kim and Dr. Eugene
Spafford at Purdue University in 1992, but Tripwire?s commercial products
and Open Source Tripwire have followed different development roadmaps since
they diverged in 1999."
- www.tripwire.org

Sure, some remnants of the source code might be still be in the current
incarnation but they're not accessible...

Message-ID: <20110125000027.GQ2121@sentinelchicken.org>


Howdy folks,

IANA is likely to run out of IPv4 addresses in about 8 days.  IANA
dishes blocks of /8 to the 5 regional registries who then break those
up and distribute them within their own regions.  The regional
registries are likely to begin running out in 2011 as well. FMI, see:
  http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/

Just thought I'd raise some awareness and ask everyone how comfortable
they feel with their knowledge and background in IPv6.  How many of
you who currently run public services (web, mail, etc) would feel
comfortable offering the same services over IPv6?  If you haven't
tackled this already, what has prevented you from doing so?

I hadn't sounded off yet, but there are a couple more contenders:

Puppet labs
Seems like civic apps might fit into this category?  Not entirely sure but
my vague understanding leads me to think that group might fit in somewhere.

And we have several open source rockstars in our midst:

Linus torvalds
Randal schwartz
Steve kirkendall:  guy who wrote and still maintains the elvis vi clone
Selena d, postgres hacker
Etc

Not people or companies but still cool:

osuosl
psas (open source rocketry at psu)
Openconferenceware by igal

the list must be longer :)

It'd be nice to have more COTS home router stuff that supports IPv6.
(The only major one that comes to mind is the Apple AirPort -- though
the upcoming WNDR3800 sounds promising.) I know, the open source stuff
that can be loaded onto such routers works with IPv6. But how many
people do that?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1101251259000.9780@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I've an interesting situation with a data file and I'm uncertain how best
to resolve it. The file started life as an Excel spreadsheet (13,500 rows)
and I imported it to OO.o, then used File->Save as to write it as a .csv
file for ultimate import into a database. I need to change the date format.

   Dates are written as [m]m/dd/yyyy and as a numeric field, not as a text
field surrounded by quotation marks. I'd like the dates to be written in the
more standard YYYY-MM-DD format. OO.o will let me view the dates in
different formats but the underlying format is unchanged.

   Here's an example row:

27132,"96-A001256","BC-0.5",5/21/1996,"pH",8.19,,"True"

   I want the date to read "1996-05-21" instead of 5/21/1996. This
column/field has three sub-fields, unlike the previous parsing need that had
the month, day, and year as separate text fields which are easily handled by
gawk.

   Please offer suggestions on how to convert all 13.5-thousand rows to the
preferred date format.

Super hackish awk that I did in five minutes, but it seems to work... maybe...

awk '{split ($1, a, ","); split (a[4], b, "/"); printf
"%s,%s,%s,%s-%s-%s,%s,%s,%s,%s\n", a[1], a[2], a[3], b[3], b[1], b[2],
a[5], a[6], a[7], a[8]; }'

Give it a try, refine it (because it's fugly), your mileage may vary,
yadda yadda...

Sam/Fred,

   OK. You caught me. I've not used split with awk before.

Probably works in most cases, but Microsoft CSV is actually a
surprisingly complex format to parse.  Cells can contain new lines (as
part of data) as well as indirectly escaped commas.

I've had trouble convincing OOo to behave sanely when it comes to
formatting various fields.  If you can't do the conversion there, I'd
recommend just using Python's CSV module.  It defaults to using
Microsoft's escaping syntax on input and output.  I don't have time to
write the script right now, but it shouldn't take more than 5-6 lines
of code.

Having written the *.csv file, one could use AWK/GAWK, first using the 
comma as the field separator (FS) and then splitting (split) the the 
fourth field with the slash as the field separator.  Finally, one would 
use printf to format the line.  Remember that the FS must be included in 
the format string as it will not have been saved as part of a field.
    printf("%d,%s,%s,%4d/%2d/%2d,%s,%s,,%s\n", .......)
or something of the sort.
Does that help?  Do you need help with that?  Reply off list if needs be.

Tim,

   It's not Microsoft. I imported the original file in OO.o because we don't
do Windows here, and wrote it out as a .csv file from OO.o. Each row and
column is self-contained.

Thanks,

Rich

Sam,

   I'm stuck on the 'yadda yadda' part. I've looked in my copy of 'sed & awk'
by Dougherty and Robbins without seeing the answer to two questions that
have come up.

   Here's another line where one field is a string with an embedded comma.
Awk takes that as the field separator ignoring all double quotes in the
input line:

NULL,"96-A001787","BC-0.5",6/25/1996,"Alkalinity, Bicarbonate",212,"mg/L CaCO3",NULL

The script output therefore is:

NULL,"96-A001787","BC-0.5",1996-6-25,"Alkalinity,,,

   Second question whose answer I must have missed in the book is how to
surround the reformatted date in double quotes. The whole printf string is
quoted; do I escape internal quotes so the printf statement reads,

"%s,%s,%s,\"%s-%s-%s\",%s,%s,%s,%s\n" ?

Thanks,

Rich

Yep, that's because my original assumption was that your csv stood for
"Comma Separated Values" in the absolute most literal sense...

It's looking like I'd probably wind up using python for this after all
(as Tim suggested), as python's csv module is brainy enough to handle
stuff like this, for example:

>>> import csv
>>> crud = csv.reader(open('data', 'rb'), delimiter=',')
>>> for row in crud:
...    print row
...
['27132', '96-A001256', 'BC-0.5', '5/21/1996', 'pH', '8.19', '', 'True']
['NULL', '96-A001787', 'BC-0.5', '6/25/1996', 'Alkalinity,
Bicarbonate', '212', 'mg/L CaCO3', 'NULL']

Seems to have handled the quirky line just fine.

Wes,

   Yup.

   It's a view thing, does nothing to the underlying string/numbers.

Sam,

   I agree, but all the csv files with which I've worked have the literal
strings within double quotes. That distinguishes them from numerics.

   I've not used that module before so I'll read about it.

Well, yeah, but most likely the CSV format it uses is the same as what
Excel generates.

That is, if there were a newline or comma in any field, the awk script
posted earlier would choke.  The following are two perfectly valid CSV
rows, each with 8 columns:


"27,132","96-A001256","BC-0.5",5/21/1996,"pH""",8.19,,"True"
"27132","96-A001256","BC-0.5
",5/21/1996,"pH",8.19,,"True"


Basically, any simple "split()" approach, which is commonly availble
in scripting languages, won't work in the general case.  But if you're
sure your data is clean, it should work with the awk script.

I take exception ... if the problem is one of field separator, and that 
can be sticky, then save the CSV file as fixed width format and parse 
the records by positional counts ... AWK/GAWK can do that with substr(), 
as I am sure many scripts and other languages can.

   Could be, Tim. I don't know that I've seen an Excel-produced csv file.

   I'll write a python script to do the job. Need to get my python back up to
speed anyway, and the csv module is simple enough.

(1) Comma within literal string ... when saving the file from OOo, 
choose some more appropriate field separator ... option include , : ; 
tab space
(1.1) or it could be saved as fixed width ... either way, I would still 
vote for AWK/GAWK
(1.1.1) in this case one would use substr() to extract the desired fields
(2) printf:  yes, escape the internal double quotes with a backslash
Hope that helps

Subject: [PLUG] UPS is beeping sporadically
Message-ID: <20110126102528.25fbf997@mailhost.pdx.edu>

For the past several days my APC Smart UPS, model SUA1500, has suddenly
started beeping at random times. If I ignore it the beeping stops after
a minute or so. Once it stopped when I gave it a smart slap on the top
of the case, although this remedy worked only once. It appears to hold
a charge fine, although I don't know how to test it to be sure. While
beeping none of the trouble lights on the front panel come on. When the
beeping first starts the green charge indicator lights are all lit, but
as it continues to beep they go down, as though the charge was rapidly
depleting. 

I suspect that some electronic device inside is going out, although it
could be the batteries. I've had it for about two years, but I bought
it used. I think it is going to take someone with proper equipment to
troubleshoot, and it may just have to be replaced. Does anyone have any
suggestions for local places I can take it to for diagnosis and/or
service?

Sounds like it is detecting that the line voltage is dipping below it's
threshold.  The sensitivity of this can be adjusted if you think the devices
on the UPS can safely handle the sags. (see page 6 of the manual
http://www.apcmedia.com/salestools/ASTE-6Z8LFR_R0_EN.pdf )  I would try this

How old is the battery?
I have had a couple of UPS units with similar behavior.  When I replaced the
battery they behaved normally.  If your battery is stressed from irregular
voltage it can go bad quicker than expected.
Have you tried unplugging the UPS to see how long it will power your system
without AC?  Does it behave as expected?

Subject: [PLUG] Anyone Using Google Voice with T-Mobile?
Message-ID: <AANLkTimAA1swRumNK+HjEcGtL+-2CUn6PXM=Lt=uL-JR@mail.gmail.com>

Wifi calling on my android phone with T-mobile is not very reliable. Some
wifi points connect, some don't, those that connect drop calls, etc. I think
google voice is VoIP, so it sounds as if it would be a replacement for the
wifi calling app on my phone. But some boards say that T-mobile customers
get charged minutes even when using GV.

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone on the list uses GV + Android + T-mobile
and what their experience has been.

Also, in reading about GV, it says I have to get a new phone number. How
does that number relate to my mobile number, or is it something in the
background that the world does not see? The google docs are not very helpful
in explaining just what GV provides.

Thanks,

I can answer part of your question. It's your lucky day. According to
the Google Blog, as of yesterday you can port your own number to
Google Voice.

http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/port-your-existing-mobile-number-to.html

They tested this a few days ago and temporarily stopped it, but now it
looks permanent.

I don't have T-mobile so can't answer the rest of the question.

As far as I know the wifi calling thing lets you be billed minutes,
indeed.  GV definitely does.

Solid.  My partner and I have very occasional quality issues,
typically low volume, when calling to or from Australia, but local
stuff has been dead on.

So, the best way to use Google Voice is that you have people call the
GV number, and it then calls whatever set of phones you tell it to.
Those phones need their own number, but that is hidden from the rest
of the world.

AFAIK, GV actually intercepts the request to call from Android, talks
over the Internet to their servers, has GV call your mobile, picks
that call up silently, and then connects you through on the outbound
leg.

Anyway, you can also just redirect your voicemail stuff into GV, but
that isn't nearly as nice.

Finally, if you port your number it *stops* working on your current
mobile; you would need to establish a new mobile service with T-Mobile
for GV to be able to call through to the bit of hardware.

If you have more specific questions feel free to add 'em on, though I
am pretty busy right now so might be high latency in responding. :)

If I understand correctly, there is a cost to use GV, so I pay for that. And
I get billed minutes from my carrier to use GV. Am I correct?

If GV is actually calling my Tmo number, then where does the wifi come in?
With T-mobile, any minutes that I talk over Wifi, and not their network are
free - no charge against my plan minutes. It doesn't sound, from your
description, that GV works within that framework.

I agree with others, probably batteries.

However, I did see this symptom at our old house during cold weather.
The UPS would trip when the furnace blower started up, which sagged
the line voltage.  As the batteries got older, they were insufficient
to keep the computer alive, resulting in daily reboots when the 
thermostat timer changed programs at 5AM.  It took 3 days of getting
up early (or staying up late) and watching to figure that one out
( what?? there is /another/ 5 oclock? ).

> It appears to hold a charge fine, although I don't know how to test

That is why you should still keep some incandescent light bulbs
around.  Test the UPS by powering an appropriate number of 100W
lamps, and see how long it stays running.  Probably not long.

Modern UPSes have a USB plug, which provides all sorts of nifty
info to the right Linux software, including battery condition
and power state.  When the power goes off for longer than a
minute or so, it is time for that software to initiate a shutdown.

I'm pretty certain that Google Voice does not use VOIP for the last
leg.  I've been using it as a personal PBX-like system, just for local
calls (I've never needed to use the google voice  paid long distance).
 So far, there is every indication that it is just routing calls to
the gvoice number over my standard phone line(s).  The call initiation
can be done either over a data connection or via phone (using tones?
There is a google voice number, or numbers, that you can call and then
issue a call from without needing a data connection.  I don't know how
the google voice app behaves.)

Anyhow, after ~2 years of google voice, I'm very happy with the
service.  Voicemail transcription is awesome, the scammer call
blocking is great, and I don't have to worry about carrying my number
over when I change carriers, or if I need to receive calls on a land
line for some reason.  You can also send text messages directly from a
Chrome plugin (so you have a real keyboard!), and the recipient is
none the wiser :)

I'm actually late to the entire conversation (hey, I was at lunch) but
I've used Google Voice with my Android phone on T-Mobile for over a
year now (I was part of the Google Voice pre-pre beta stuff, lucky me)
so I may be able to lend some help with this.

And, like the rude jerk I am, I'm going to be replying to snippets
from specific messages all at once rather than just replying to each
individual email individually.

Caveats- I use a Nexus One, which means I get *zero* support from
T-Mobile for my phone. Further it means that there's no T-Mobile
taint... *ahem* "branding* on it, which probably helps a lot in my
day-to-day workings with it.

My personal experience has been *very* positive. But I'll wager that
has a lot to do with the fact that I've go no T-Mobile gunk on my
phone getting in my way preventing me from just using Android and GV
directly.

If you somehow can just use stock Android, Google Voice integrates
seamlessly into it.

As Bill pointed out, there's apparently a new way to grab your
existing cell number and use it with GV. That however is too new for
me, so I've never used it.

I have a GV number and a T-Mobile number. I personally found
T-Mobile's voicemail annoying and cumbersome last time I used it
(which, admittedly, was two years ago :-) so I actually integrated my
standard T-Mobile number into my GV voicemail. This means when you
call my normal T-Mobile number, and I don't answer, it goes to GV for
voicemail. I find this a *terribly* handy feature as it means I can
get email notifications, SMS notifications, text translations (often
times with hilarious results), etc and so on.

There's probably better, more official ways to do this, but IIRC this
is how I did this:
http://thebogles.com/blog/2009/04/how-to-replace-your-cellphones-voice-mail-with-google-voice/

I also have my GV number forward to my T-Mobile number, but I'll admit
I very rarely use that number any more (I used to use it for a
business I ran...)

> If I understand correctly, there is a cost to use GV, so I pay for that. And
> I get billed minutes from my carrier to use GV. Am I correct?

When *I* use GV strictly over Wifi (or even over 3G, due to my plan) I
don't get billed any minute usage (or any additional usage
whatsoever). But, again, I'm not using a branded T-Mobile Android
phone. I'd wager that official branded T-Mobile phones probably have
all sorts of nastiness in them that prevent this sort of shenanigoats
from happening (and that's why I'll never buy a branded phone, thank
you kindly :-)

So, I just checked my bill, which T-Mobile helpfully sent yesterday,
and it confirms my understanding: I am paying "minutes" for Google
Voice calls, at least some of the time.  (I think it is just like
someone calling me would cost minutes, but am not actually certain
enough of how US mobile plans work to be sure of that. :)

[...]

It doesn't.  GV uses the regular phone network at both ends, and VoIP
in the middle...

...but if your T-Mobile wifi calls are free then so too would be GV
calls while the wifi calling was active.

It is probably easiest to think of the "call" part of GV as being
*three* phone calls:

you <=> Google Voice <=> your caller / caleee

Those first and last steps work just like regular phone calls as far
as you are concerned; they happen to proxy through GV, but you can't
really tell.

"I'm pretty certain that Google Voice does not use VOIP for the last
leg."

Google purchased the Grand Central VOIP service. Any Google smartphone has
an ip address. VOIP on the most basic level maps a phone number to an ip
address.

Actually, now that you mention it, I'll admit I've never actually
*looked* under the covers to see what's going on in the Google Voice
app on the phone...

On my phone (again unbranded, Nexus One, so I get stock Android from
Google, yadda yadda) I get the option to complete calls either with my
network *or* with Google Voice. When last I checked, my GV calls
didn't seem to eat any minutes, but who knows what sort of black-magic
they have going on behind the scenes to make that happen.

I do know that on the desktop there is no VOIP with Google Voice
(which is something many people have wanted) so it stands to reason
the same can be said for the Android App.

There is if you have a Gizmo VOIP account.  Google closed the service
to new subscribers when they bought it a year or two ago, though.

No VoIP, just regular mobile phone (or fixed line) voice traffic.
Google assign a proxy number on the mobile network to individual
callers, or have their general purpose number call you.  The same on
the way out to your recipient.

You can list Google Talk as a "phone" in GV now, which gives desktop
VoIP.  Not SIP, but at least something.

"No VoIP, just regular mobile phone (or fixed line) voice traffic.

Google is not a telecom company, they're an internet company. Yes, the have
a pool of "proxy" phone numbers that maps your carrier assigned phone number
to virtual phone number. But at some point those "voice" calls are being
converted and encapsulated into ip packets and then routed over the
internet.

The reason you don't get charged minutes is because they're not traditional
(PSTN) voice calls that traverse multiple carrier exchanges from source to
destination. A "toll free" gets charged by each carrier for each call they
put up over their network.

"Last mile" may or may not be VoIP depending on the carrier or if it's a
mobile or land line phone. But every major carrier has converted their
backbones to fiber optic and IP, they're not installing new TDM switches and
running 2 pair of copper wire for every new phone number.

Well, duh! Some days I stun myself with my own witlessness.

Looking at it again just now there is a lit up red light on the front

So I guess I do need a repair place. Any suggestions?

Thanks to all who replied.  After cleaning up various stanzas of
httpd.conf, taking out some of the unsupported internationalization,
and taking some unneeded configurations out of conf.d ( I don't
use AJP(?) and PHP ), I started yanking modules, putting them
back when the apache syntax checker complained (thanks, Paul).
In some cases, I removed unneeded portions of httpd.conf that
used those modules.

I constructed a links-testing webpage on one of my other servers,
with links to the websites and wikis and svn and mailman URLs
running on the server - about 50 things to click and look at.
The old (soon to be removed) kwiki sites ran very slow, so I
turned the caching back on.  A passworded URL complained, so
I added mod_auth_basic back.  There may be some other breakage
lurking there, perhaps some odd feature associated with
subversion, but everything seems to be OK OK OK OK OK OK ... :-)

So, the httpd.conf file is half its former size ( I did save the
original ) and I am using only 16 of the 57 modules the original
distro version called for.  I hope this will make apache a little
more secure, faster, and reduce the memory footprint somewhat.

I'm not going to post what I still use to the list ( the bad guys
are watching ) but I can discuss what I did and why by private email.

Next task: setting up an HTTPS virtual site, using all the good
suggestions I've gotten here about getting cheap certs.  Mostly
this will be for a form that people can use to send me secret
stuff (passwords, zip keys, etc) without relying on their
(lack of) knowledge of encryption or certificate management.

Keith

I have 5 or 6 /48's already.  Many of them through tunnelbroker.net.

GO GET YOUR FREE FAST IPV6 TUNNEL FROM tunnelbroker.net.

As long as you have ipv4 connectivity outward (even through NAT!), you
can get a fully routeable *static* ipv6 /48 for your very own.  For
free.  Five of them, if you want.  They'll even provide forward and
reverse DNS for free in a few more mouse clicks.

Heck, I have one tunnel that terminates in LA, and another that
terminates in the UK.  Makes watching BBC iPlay a lot easier. :)

Also, if you're on Comcast, and have a proper border router, you can get
ipv6 anywhere in Portland as well, using 6to4 or their other weird
protocol.

Or, most modern machines can run "miredo", which sets up an outbound
ipv6 tunnel on the fly, using the teredo protocol.  I've had mixed
results with that, but my laptop gives me v6 every time I open the
clamshell, regardless of what wifi I'm hooked up to (ipv4 only,
typically).

No excuse not to be on v6.  None.

Subject: [PLUG] secure way to store files on another server?
Message-ID: <20110127012407.GA9791@gate.kl-ic.com>

I am using an offsite virtual (rimuhosting) for my server.  It
has limited disk space, about 80% full.  I have mucho disk space
and bandwidth at home, but I don't want to open up my private
network to potential security threats.  

So, I'm thinking about setting up a chroot jail directory at
home, storing big-but-rarely used stuff there, and driving
an openvpn tunnel from that space back to my server, and
doing file sharing over that link.

Alternately, is there someplace out on the web where I can
store 20GB or so of stuff Real Cheap, and redirect some
URLs to that?  The main content I'm concerned with for now
is some GB+ videos and presentations.  One hop and storage
might be cheaper than two hops.

Ideas?  Warnings?  Random nonsense?

Keith

Wuala.com is an interesting new startup.  Think of it as dropbox but
with these important differences:

(a) data is encrypted locally... wuala people can't see it unless you
give them your local password

(b) you get 1G or 2G for free (like dropbox), but if you have a server
that has relatively constant net connectivity and some spare disk, you
can trade them up to 1-1 for cloud storage.  As in, you give them 50GB
of space on your box, and you get 50GB of cloud space *for free*.

(c) you can select that a folder is mapped to a local folder in either
sync or backup mode.  If sync mode, every change is reflected as quickly
as possible, even to people sharing the folder.

So, you'd get a wuala.com account, donate 20GB to the cause, and then
store your 20GB of stuff in either a cloud-based password-protected
directory (need URL to access) or a public directory (anyone can
access).  It'd be in the cloud, so it won't use your bandwidth no matter
how many downloads people make once you upload.

If you need an invite, let me know... you'll get 2GB initial instead of
1GB.

I don't think easy adequately describes the process.

After you register there's a button to click that provides cut and paste
commands to configure your device for IPv6.

Click, click and DNS is set up. 
Manage your DNS takes a bit longer.

They also have a
"certification" test series. 
Differences from normal
certification test series:
?? the questions are easier
? however you must implement IPv6 and have their system contact yours
via IPv6.? Progression is measured through in the world testing 
??? 
As you go along you'll set up DNS records,
reconfigure your web and mail servers, etc.

All,

Does anyone use evolution? I started using it with my upgrade to Ubuntu
10.04 in November. I hooked it into my google calendar and everything
worked. About a week or so ago though, I can no longer see my calendar
data in evolution, and invites won't add to the calendar.

I started evolution on the command line to see if it threw some errors
for me when I went to add an event, but no dice. 

Does nayone else have this setup? Does evolution have a log file
somewhere?

thanks,

After trying Evolution with all my heart for a couple of months (on 
Ubuntu 10.04 originally), i ditched it in favor of Thunderbird + 
Lightning + the Google Calendar provider. Works like a charm, i depend 
on it.

Evolution was too feature-weak to use as a primary mail client for 
multiple accounts and different protocols.

Which method of blocking large numbers of IPs is the least consumptive

am curious as to whether it is the best way to go when blocking hundreds 
of IPs - like maybe for ALL of China and/or Korea for instance.

iptables is most likely more efficient, though it may be harder to
manage.  I also am not sure how well it scales when you have thousands
of individual IP addresses.  However, it is efficient for blocking
groups of IPs.

You may want to rethink the approach of blocking whole countries.
For some time a friend of mine was blocking all of China and Korea to
cut down on spam.  However, just recently he was workign for a client
in one of those countries and just couldn't figure out why he couldn't
receive their email.  He had forgotten about the blocking.

There's no telling if/when you'll run into similar issues, and it may
not be related to traffic you can anticipate will go to/from those
countries.  (Think geographically distributed services you use every
day.)

A better approach to cut down on noise might be to block traffic from
IPs on public blacklists like the spamhaus XBL:
  http://www.spamhaus.org/xbl/

I'm not sure if that specific blacklist is convenient to use with
iptables, but that would be a better approach in my book.

HTH,
tim

Getting your ISP to block them. Next down would be iptables with an
efficient "match many hosts" module - thousands of rules are relatively
costly. Don't forget to send an "admin prohibited" back, though, or they
will keep sending SYN packets at you.

Htaccess is about the least efficient way - at the far end of efficiency in
Apache, which is way out in user-space.

Does it really matter, though, given how over-powered your CPU is likely to
be compared to your network bandwidth?

Regards,
       Daniel

I also second the "are you sure"; personally I use fail2ban to block hostile
addresses more selectively.

The one upside is that nmap'ing a /64 (if it even worked) is kind of a
self-inflicted DOS attack.  It might not complete in your lifetime! ;-)

Once your private IPv6 address is exposed though, you are fully
reachable *AND* have pretty much given away your macaddress (since it
is embedded in your auto-self-configured address).  There are
solutions to the macaddr problem, but takes a little more work.

There *are* implications.

BTW, just to show how dumb I am, for a while I was under the
impression that just plain old iptables -j MASQUERADE pretty much
protected all the hosts behind it from being reachable from "outside".
Gigantic impenetrably unreadable "firewall rule" sets seemed like
probably more risk than they were worth.  I tended to rely on just the
-j MASQUERADE rule.  I did finally test my assumption and found that
at least in one limited instance, it did *not* provide the protection
I thought it did.  A host on the immediately upstream network side
*could* set a route to the nat'ing gateway if they know the network on
the private side of the gateway and packets get forwarded just fine.
However, I believe that hosts further away won't be able to route that
way if they don't control all the routers in between.

Message-ID: <20110127200539.7410716c@mailhost.pdx.edu>

It turns out that APC wants $180 for a replacement battery for my
SUA1500 UPS. I might be able to get it cheaper elsewhere, but I can get
a brand new unit for about the same price:

CyberPower (nicer features) for $165 with free shipping from Amazon
(CP1500AVRLCD):

http://tinyurl.com/4sk6xd9

APC no longer sells the SUA1500, but they have a new one of the same
performance for $185 from Amazon, including shipping (BX1500G):

http://tinyurl.com/4c9aod8

And TrippLite has a similar model (Smart 1500LCD) for $177 with free
shipping from Amazon: 

http://www.tripplite.com/en/products/model.cfm?txtModelID=3151

The CyberPower comes with a Linux command line utility. The others have
only Windows utilities. However, as Keith mentioned, there are open
source utilities that may work with any or all of the above, and
perhaps better than the proprietary software.

All come with a three year warranty. Thinking ahead to battery
replacement in three years, a replacement battery for the TrippLite is
$150, for the CyberPower $198, and for the APC only $60.

Does anyone have any experience with the above? Does the Linux software
work with them? Any other suggestions? And assuming I get a new one,
does anyone want my old one?

A replacement battery today costs $180 today and $60 in three years?
Have you checked with Battery Exchange to see what their price for 
a replacement is?

Yes, this is actually a very interesting, major shift in how low-level
network attacks will be performed in IPv6.  Attackers will be forced
to guess common addresses or use the DNS to find hosts.  I wrote a
thesis paper on the topic.  It'll be interesting to see how it plays
out.

Yes, it is good to be aware of this.  For many systems, it's not a big
worry if mac addresses are leaked, but in some cases it could tell an
attacker a lot about what kind of special purpose appliances might be
in your private network.

I currently set static addresses on my network, just to keep the
numbers similar to what my v4 addresses are, so this isn't a problem
for me.  However manually set, internal static addresses will likely
become increasingly less popular and hard to manage in v6, so other
solutions would be necessary.

Russell, are you familiar with the current easiest way to run 1:1 NAT
with autoconfigured addresses?  Is this even possible/easy with
iptables?  Several years ago I caught a netfilter developer on
freenode and asked about NAT options and he wasn't very supportive of
the idea at all.  I think NAT will likely become popular for internal
address portability, though NAPT should be shunned.

Great idea!

Unfortunately, the price for the BX1500G from APC with trade-in is $206
and I can get it from Amazon without trade-in for $185. :(

Oh well. It was a great idea anyway.

w/r/t iptables blocklists, i use peerguardian at home and on my servers,
it's packaged as pgld and pglcmd for most distros. it lets you choose
from a wide variety of blocklists for hosts with various types of bad
behavior, and supports whitelisting or custom blacklists, so fine-tuning
is a simple matter. i *believe* that pgld primarily uses lists supplied
by Bluetack, but i am also pretty sure there are some others in the
bunch. as usual, ymmv.

nathan

for iptables blocklists, i've had good success with PeerGuardian,
packaged as pgld and pglcmd for most distros. i will say i have had
better luck with the pgld/pglcmd combo than with moblock/blockcontrol
packages.

PeerGuardian supports lots of blocklists that you opt into during dpkg
configurtaion, separated by various types of bad behaviors. it also
supports whitelisting and custom blocklists, so fine-tuning's very
doable.

one thing to be aware of is that it needs to start up after your other
firewall rules. while i've had good luck with this, depending on your
needs, ymmv.

nathan

My UPS's have done the same for years. Tends to cost about 30 bucks
for the smaller ones (single battery), more for the heavier-duty ones
(which may have multiple batteries).... online, the batteries for that
particular model trend about 90-130 bucks.

   When my second TrippLite unit failed early I swore off them and stuck with
APC. With a Google search I found a company that refurbishes UPSs and sells
them for quite a bit less than new ones. With warrantys, too. My SmartUPS
1400 has been working flawlessly for years, and it's a refurbished unit.

   Something for you to consider.

Something to do with aliasing (i.e., multiple IPs per NIC) ... as in 
eth0:0 having a different IP from eth0?  Just a guess.

You need to define a group around the digit, then reference that digit
as the replace pattern, using query-replace-regexp.  Match on:

\([0-9]\)'

and replace with:

\1

(to refer to the first group)

You need to define a group around the digit, then reference that digit
as the replace pattern, using query-replace-regexp.  Match on:

\([0-9]\)'

and replace with:

\1

(to refer to the first group)

Rogan,

   Obviously, I missed that part on the emacs regular expression syntax Web

This is why I asked for context... I see lots of mentions of eth0:0 (and I

So I want more info before I start guessing :)

It was just a long shot ... perhaps the data we received in the original

Gives the IP address 0 to the interface; you can extend that to the
full 32 bits as 0.0.0.0

This is likely to be used as part of bringing up the interface as part
of a software bridge, to which later the virtual machines will also be
attached.

I have gotten glibc to recompile for LFS temporary tools, but where is
execvp and the other variants?  Looks like none of the packages provide
an execvp binary and it appears to be missing on the fedora 9 host
system as well.  Is execvp merely part of a C library that links in

In order to make application development for IPv6 a little easier,
operating systems have implemented various ways to listen on a single
socket for both v4 and v6 simultaneously.  A good overview is here:

  http://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/Ipv6DualBinding

So you can actually see a program bind to v6, and if the kernel
settings (or manual socket settings) are right, it can accept v4
connections.  This probably explains the odd netstat output you're
seeing.

ipv6 supports the notion of an ipv4 address buried inside an ipv6
address for backward compatibility.  It may be that your next-hop
provider also permits such an interpretation, and so everyone is
cooperating.

Wait, why are you trading in?  Just replace the batteries!  I've used
the place on SE 20th and Belmont.  There is another place (affiliated?)
further out Belmont, a few blocks west of 39th.  Likely to be cheaper
than Batteries Plus.  The batteries are Sealed Lead Acid (SLA) and
come in standard sizes.  There is a 99.9% chance that either of those
places with have a replacement for probably no more than $40 or so
each.

It's generally a bad idea to mail-order SLA batteries.  They are heavy
as lead (joke-joke) and shipping costs are prodigious.

It basically deconfigures any ip address associated with the
interface.  I use it frequently when switching back and forth between
wireless and wired interfaces to the same network (e.g. while
debugging a wireless problem).  If both interfaces are configured on
the same network (which might happen by associating and getting DHCP
from wireless, then plugging an ethernet into a LAN port and getting
DHCP for that), the networking stack gets confused over which
interface to use to reach a local destination, so deconfiguring helps
unconfuse things.  Just downing the interface doesn't necessarily
help, btw.  This series of commands (not tested) should show what is
happening: 

  dhclient eth0
  ifconfig eth0
  ifconfig eth0 down
  ifconfig eth0
  ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0 (or just 0 for short)
  ifconfig eth0

I called Batteries Plus on 30th and Broadway, and Northwest Battery
Supply on 37th and Belmont. Both had the batteries in stock (it takes
two), but they both wanted $120 for the pair. I agree that getting them
online is nuts with the shipping cost, plus the cheapest online price I
could get was $149. 

Note that this is not a wimpy UPS. It's 1500VA and 900 watts. I'm sure
batteries for some of the smaller UPS models are lots cheaper. 

Considering that I can get a brand new APC BR1500G for $179 at Best Buy
(Jantzen Beach) or at Walmart for $175, I have decided to just get a
new one. The new one has a nice LCD screen that gives me more details
about what is going on than the old model. Plus, the replacement
batteries carry only a one year warranty, where the new unit carries a
three year warranty, including the batteries. And the new one comes
with a long USB cable. And to clinch the deal, my old one is dusty and
the new one will be clean and shiny. 

The old one, complete with beepy batteries, will soon become available
to whoever wants it.

If you have DSL it's not unusual to have to pay something like $5/mo/ip.

feh

Sign up with he.net for your own IPv6 tunnel and they'll also let you have
multiple /48 networks.  Routed right into your private spce. 

Whoo Hah, who cares you ask?  
um, a /48 network supports 65536 /64 networks.  

Think you will have any issues finding enough room to segregate test vs prod vs
uat vs wild hair networks in that space?


So far my largest issue with IPv6 is attempting to grasp the enormity of the address space.

O_o  Um, yes.  execvp is one of the libc wrappers around system calls
used to replace the running process with another process.  What on
earth were you looking to do with an execvp binary?

have you checked the output of dmesg? barring that, there's several places in
/var/log such as the boot log or others... i imagine dmesg will give you what
you're looking for.

Subject: [PLUG] APCUSB utility can't see UPS
Message-ID: <20110129173317.731b0aff@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I have installed my shiny new APC BX1500G UPS and it is all working
fine, except for getting the Linux APCUSB utility to see it. The LCD
display on the UPS says that my line voltage is 120, but for the load
all it shows is a bar graph without numbers. I was hoping that the open
source APC utility would provide more details, but it can't see the unit
at all. 

It connects by an RJ45 plug in the back of the unit, with the supplied
cable terminating in a standard USB plug on the other end. The error
message is "NISERR unknown at localhost NIS network connection not
responding." 

From the command line "cat /proc/bus/usb/devices" sees the device. And
the power icon in the gnome panel sees it and correctly reports the
make, model and even serial number. So I know it is properly connected.
The problem is that I'd like to know what the load is, how long to
empty at the current load, and I'd like to be able to adjust the
shutdown preferences, none of which are available from the Gnome panel
Power Statistics window. The Power Statistics window also shows nothing
for the performance tabs - the graphs are vacant with the message
"there is no data to display."

I've read through the manual at:

http://www.apcupsd.org/manual/manual.html#quick-start-for-beginners

But I haven't found any clues yet.

Is anyone using APCUSB? Is there a secret to getting it find the UPS?

A Nice Guy sent me an offline response:

  'Enormity' is one of my favorite words to be seen used correctly, because
  it often surprises people who think it means enormousness or immensity.

  It primarily means some great horror or something terrible. My dictionary
  leads off with: 'a grave offense against order, right, or decency; a
  quality or state of being immoderate, monstrous, or outrageous.'

What a great catch, eh?

So it seems my issue is with the immensity.  This immensity will dull the 
enormity of some net citizens.  No longer will it be possible for them to scan
address ranges checking for exploitable targets. With the sheer size of the 
IPv6 space random probes just won't be efficient.

Unfortunately, this will do nothing to address the enormity of spammer's actions.

Yes and there are some interesting tricks you can play with this if
you get clever.  Here is an example of one:

Ever heard of port knocking?  This is a strategy whereby clients
intentionally probe (for example, port scan) certain services in a
certain order as a secret code in order to instruct a firewall to open
up service to them.  It provides a simple way to mask a service from
potential attackers while still allowing users from any source IP
address to access it.  Port knocking is not a replacement for good
authentication, but it can help mitigate vulnerabilities in certain
critical services.

The problem with port knocking is that you often need special client
software (in addition to special server software) to implement it.
Kind of a pain for the average user.

Let us now consider the enormous address space of IPv6.  Every person
can easily obtain a /48, or 80 bits of address space.  The only way to
find services on a hidden address would be if they were explicitly
advertised or shared in a secret way.  So, you could simply tell your
trusted associates what your random IP address is that provides a
service and then you achieve what you had achieved with port knocking
without the need for a special client.  However, that's kind of a
pain, because people don't want to have to remember 80 bit random
numbers...

So instead, let's improve this by creating a smart DNS server that we
control.  Whenever we ask about any valid name, it returns us a signed
cryptographic token which contains some limited information.  This
token is embedded as the last 80 bits of the IP address itself.
The DNS server can be instructed to place anything it wants in that
token, within space limits.  When the firewall receives a request for
an IP address, it statelessly validates the cryptographic token (much
like we already do in TCP SYN cookies) and passes traffic on according
to predefined rules.

So now we can create ourselves a special, secret domain name like
"mysecretSSHservice.example.org" which returns a cryptographic cookie
containing an indicator for what services should be opened to the
client.  The domain name is easy to remember, there is no client
software required, and we have a very strong guarantee about how
hidden our hidden services are.


Sorry if that's long-winded, but I just wanted to illustrate that
there are some fundamental changes in how the Internet can work,
simply due to the very large address space.

Regards,
tim

Hi Josh,

You touched upon several issues in your email, so here's my wack at what 
I think you need to do.  While I have no experience using the BX1500G, I 
have configured apcupsd with BE750G (on Ubuntu 10.10) which uses a 
similar RJ45<->USB plug.  I agree the gnome panel doesn't provide much 
information.  Regardless, you can (and should) adjust your unit's 
configuration solely from apcupsd.conf (for me 
/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf)-- I set UPSCABLE to usb, UPSTYPE to usb, and 
commented out DEVICE-- not a required option as it will autodetect.  
(Naturally any changes you make to this file should be accompanied with 
a restart of the service).   You can ask your unit for data by invoking 
`apcaccess`.  Here's a sample of mine:

...
CABLE    : USB Cable
MODEL    : Back-UPS ES 750
UPSMODE  : Stand Alone
STARTTIME: 2011-01-21 19:30:19 -0500
STATUS   : ONLINE
LINEV    : 124.0 Volts
LOADPCT  :  57.0 Percent Load Capacity
...

You said you're having problems identifying the device? Here's a sample 
of (my) dmesg output identifying the device upon startup:
generic-usb 0003:051D:0002.0001: hiddev96,hidraw0: USB HID v1.10 Device 
[American Power Conversion Back-UPS ES 750 FW:841.I3 .D USB FW:I3 ] on 
usb-0000:00:1a.1-2/input0

Alternatively, lshw can output system bus information, so you could 
locate the unit that way (not as fun mind you):
...
         *-usb:1
              description: USB Controller
              product: 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #5 
[8086:2938]
              vendor: Intel Corporation [8086]
              physical id: 1a.1
              bus info: pci at 0000:00:1a.1
              version: 02
              width: 32 bits
              clock: 33MHz
              capabilities: uhci bus_master cap_list
              configuration: driver=uhci_hcd latency=0
              resources: irq:21 ioport:e100(size=32)
...

To take this a step further, if you have apache2 setup, you can install 
the apcupsd-cgi addon, which will show you (imho) more meaningful graphs 
via a web interface.  Hope this pushes you in the right direction.

Best,
-EJ

...but don't count on that helping you in the slightest. Various
approaches to remote host discovery have already floated about, and
once any local device is compromised scanning the local network
becomes fairly trivial.

...though it has exactly the same security properties as sticking a
web page in place that accepts a password, and then opens a hole in
the firewall to the client.

Er, no you didn't. Port knocking at least required a password
(probably sent in the clear, and trivially weak, but whatever) before
it granted access; this model counts only on obscurity.  You might as
well advocate picking a random high port to run the service on in IPv4
land.

So, rather than actually authenticating, or using the *mandatory*
IPSec features in IPv6 which are a cryptographically strong way to
provide both authentication and encryption, you want create a shiny
new protocol based on cryptographic tokens.

That has all the drawbacks of building a new cryptographic protocol
(how are you preventing replay attacks?), and all the drawbacks of
requiring custom client-side software, *and* avoids an existing
solution.

...which is equivalent to the bad versions of port knocking, if you
don't have custom client-side software, since you are transmitting
your "secret" in the clear, and worse: now you are using an even more
MITM-able protocol to do it.  Without DNSSEC there is no way at all to
validate that an attacker hasn't manipulated your secret, and even
DNSSEC can't stop them sniffing it out of the air.  Do you really want
to be the next target of FireSheep?

A strong guarantee of zero, there.  It isn't even vaguely well hidden.
 You would do a universe better by layering your authentication token
on something robust, like HTTPS, or even better, ssh.  (pfauth, all is
forgiven. Please come back.)

...but that isn't a change, except in the perception of difficultly.
Now, if you said "IPv6 changes the game because it mandates functional
IPSec" you would be totally on a winner!

I can't figure out the name of the service. But it probably doesn't
matter because the DEVICE line was blank and the others were already
set the way you said. I did comment out the DEVICE.

I don't really have any experience with Apache. I do have the
apcupsd-gci add-on installed, and I noted when I installed it that it
said it was for a web interface. Problem is, I don't know how to find
it with the web browser.

nathan,

   I thought dmesg was updated when the system booted. Looking at its output,
I see that it also reports when new hardware is attached, such as the backup
drive (which needed to be checked after mounting 102 times) and the
PDA/phone when I sync it to jpilot.

   The system is only rebooted when I do a distribution upgrade (new kernel
version) or I've replace failed hardware.  Nothing there about logging in to
the system as a user.

Thanks,

Rich

Fred,

   I looked at all the log files seeing nothing relevant. No, nothing in
/var/log/syslog. All that's there now is

so, my guess is that these messages are actually caused by something
in your login scrips (.login, .profile, et al).  of course those are
rarely the only thing that runs on login--there are usually system
versions in /.etc that run too.

perhaps a binary is suddenly missing, or a syntax error was introduced
somehow, or a thousand other possibilities..

anyhow that stuff won't get syslogged unless you've done something
special and kind of crazy like redirected stdout of those startup
scripts to the logger(1) command...

on to solutions: it seems like something is clearing your screen while
those scripts run and it could be a zillion things, but perhaps you
could slow things down so that you get a chance to read the messages
by inserting some 'sleep 5' commands at the beginning and end of your
shell startup files?  don't forget to login and test the changes
*before logging out* of another session in case you end up creating a
syntax error that screws things up (further =)), so your functional
window can be used to undo the madness.

somehow that answer was longer than it needed to be, but i hope it made sense..

Chris,

   It's the 'clear' command at the end of ~/.bash_profile.

   Yup. I see that the warning is that 'add_group' is an invalid entry.
Wonder where that's coming from ... it's not in my login scripts.

   Strangely enough, too, I see with all the pauses that when the 'loadkeys
~/.keymap' command is run I'm told I don't have permissions for the keymap.n
files, yet the remapping is effective on the console. The same message does
not load those remappings on my portable until I change the permissions of
loadkey to 755. Hmm-m-m-m.

Thanks for the pointer,

Rich

Rich:
How are you logging in, text console or graphic login window?
If you are using a graphic login window, you might try logging in 
through a text console available via Ctrl-Alt-F1, Ctrl-Alt-F2... .
If it is a login problem and not a XWindows problem, you would probably 
see it in the text window after logging in.
If nothing shows up logging in, you may have to start XWindows manually 
with "startx", then return to the text console (Ctrl-Alt-Fx) to look at 
XWindows startup messages.

Someone may know a nice place to view all the XWindows startup messages

As I said, port knocking is not a replacement for proper
authentication.  That is obvious.

What is the difference between sending a secret series of ports
numbers to a host versus sending a secret IP address?  None.  It is
the same level of obscurity.


For certain services, there *is* a benefit in hiding them. Sure, you
can pretend that every service you ever run will be perfectly safe in
its implementation, but as we have seen several times in the past,
even the most trusted services like SSH and IPSEC have been vulnerable
to attack.  Privileged services like this are great examples of where
port knocking is actually useful.  It makes no sense to use it for
public services, but those where you need to afford remote access and
don't really trust the implementation, it is handy.

Once again, I'm not saying this or port knocking should be used to
replace good authentication.  Some people like port knocking though,
and this is an improvement to it.

I'm not advocating that any Joe off the street should hack together
some shell scripts to implement such a system.  I was merely trying to
illustrate how the large address space can be used for some
interesting data tracking.  I have implemented a replay resistant
version of this which also adds other information tracking about
attackers.

Now if IPSEC is such a panacea, then tell me how you are going to deal
with the denial of service problems that are baked into the design of
the protocol?   Not sure what I'm talking about?

The IKE handshake is vulnerable to a serious DoS attack because it
checks a Diffie-Hellman signature right off the bat prior to
authentication.  This first packet often comes in over protocols that
can't be protected with things like TCP SYN cookies because they are
tunneled over UDP or sent directly without any initial handshake.  An
attacker can simply flood the service with invalidly signed packets.

Thank you NSA for pushing a flawed protocol on us.

So now, consider protecting that service with port knocking or the
DNS->IPv6 system I propose.  An attacker can't get the first valid
packet through without first knowing the port sequence or the secret
domain name.  This doesn't provide strong authentication, but it does
provide real-world protection against several types of attacks.

Message-ID: <4D45D64F.1050707@opusnet.com>

For those not in the know, I am a Linux USER, and that's all I want to be.

I am running Ubuntu ( version 'something' later than 10.0x - I cannot 
find an 'ABOUT' or information tab to tell me what version this is. Yes, 
I looked.) I am running Gnome.

Anyways, as of a couple days ago, my browsers have gotten really slow, 
and they 'timeout' more and more, and pretthy much always for now. I can 
open a command line and ping places I want to view, and I get 50ms ~ 
300ms depending on where.

I am trying Firefox, epiphany, and I just tried adding SeaMonkey.
Still timing out.

Windows boxes on my network serve pages normally.

Can I set the 'time' somewhere to like 5 minutes, so I acn request a 
page, do a hosework chore, and then return to the computer once the page 
finally loads. (Yes, I am patient enough to wait minutes for pages; but 
I *do* eventually want to SEE them...)

Any other hints, perhaps?

Is this right after you start the browser or after you have been using it a
while? Shut all the browser windows and restart them afresh. See if that
helps.

While I don't have anything to say to help with your subject problem, I 
can help with the 'ABOUT' question. I'm running "Ubuntu 10.04 LTS - the 
Lucid Lynx." That bit of information is found by clicking "System" on 
the menu bar, and then clicking on "About Ubuntu" at the bottom of the 
drop down menu.

Another place to get it, one that's more familiar looking to M$ Windows 
users, is to click on "System" then "Administration" and then "System 
Monitor". It summarizes the version of the operating system and various 
hardware details.

I hope this is useful, and that one of the communications gurus can help 
with your timing out problem.

I've upgraded to the 2.6.18.8 kernel thinking this might resolve the

is very strange.  There has to be a simple explanation for why I am

Didn't you agree that a secret IP was identical to a secret port
sequence earlier?  I would certainly grant this is no worse than port
knocking, but I can't see how it represents any improvement.

I still don't see it.  Seriously, how is this anything like the value
of actual security protocols embedded in the requirements for IPv6?
Sure, those have risks, but are they really any worse than the risks
in inventing a new security protocol?

Anyway, I would be interested in seeing the protocol description for
your secret DNS solution; I am curious about how you tackle a few
different aspects of the requirements, and that should answer them
pretty quickly. :)

Y'know, the baked in assumption there isn't terribly nice. ;)

In any case, yes, I was aware of that, and that there are plenty of
issues with IPSec.  Heck, if you asked me to point out a current
protocol that was pretty much the epitome of overdesign and complexity
as the enemy of security, IPSec would be right on up there.  (Hello,
Cisco extensions, while we are complaining.)

What it does provide is a substantially tested and, at least in
commercially deployed systems, reliably secure solution to the problem
of strong authentication *without* needing you to modify the client
software.

Sure.  OTOH, it remains secure, just unavailable, and frankly: if
someone wants to DoS your system the infrastructure to do that is
pretty readily available and inexpensive.  The attacker almost
certainly can manage even without something like this attack.

So, yes, granted: there is absolutely a DoS risk there, as well as the
exposure risk of the IKE daemon, and the complexity of IKE and IKEv2
(which does address that risk), and so forth.  Like any bit of
security I regard this, and port knocking, as a fundamental trade-off.

Incidentally: for most cases moving the service to a non-standard port
would have exactly the same benefit as port knocking, which is that
random scanning is less likely to find it, and no difference for
targetted attacks.  Done, without all the extra complexity.

(Also notable: SYN cookies are not a great example of solutions, since
the loss of all TCP options hurts an awful lot on modern systems.
Even the extended version in recent Linux isn't that much better, and
requires both ends to support the same system.)

...but, again, no different to using some sort of secure
authentication that opens the firewall, which easily has better
cryptographic properties, fairly reasonable security assurances, and
uses standard tools.

I don't dispute that the extended IPv6 address space makes this
possible, I just don't consider it a great advertisement for the
improvements in security it delivers. ;)

I am sometimes able to get ONE service of a URL I type in. But if I try

something there, those do not load.

Maybe we can call the situation the 'SEIU' (i.e, do-nothing public

I just discovered that the LCD display on the UPS cycles through
various displays which show the rest of the things I wanted to know. The
first display just shows the line in voltage, the battery charge %, and
the load as a graphic. I thought that that was all there was. But the
following displays give me the load in watts (58) and the remaining
time in minutes at the current load (86).

The Gnome Power Manager is kind of minimal, but it does give me options
for hibernate or shutdown when the UPS battery is critically low. It
doesn't define "critically low," but I suppose I just need to let it
run down once to test it.

So it turns out I don't need the APCUPS utility after all. It would
still be nice to figure out why it can't see the UPS when Gnome Power
Manager sees it without any problem, but I no longer care very much.

It's true.  All security software has the potential to create more
exposures as it closes others.

I guess you missed the part where I mentioned clients no longer need
any special client side software or even need to take any additional
steps to access the service.  They merely need to remember a secret
domain name, which I would estimate is significantly easier than
installing some special client or even taking the additional step of
logging into some web page to white list themselves.

My Master's thesis wasn't focused primarily on the port knocking
replacement trick, it was focused on mitigating spoofed attacks.
However, if you dig enough into the paper, you can find all of the
details that shoul be relevant:
  http://sentinelchicken.com/research/tdm_ms_thesis/

We see eye to eye on the complexity bit. =)

Maybe.  Content distribution networks today do a pretty darned good
job of mitigating attacks using lots of network tricks, though it
seems to require throwing a lot of hardware at the problem.

Resource DoS attacks are a hard problem to address and most people
just write them off saying "well if they send packets fast enough,
there's nothing we can do".  But that's just a hand wave.  There are
ways to make systems scale even under massive DoS and the more tools
we have at our disposal for that the better.

I don't think I buy that argument for targeted attacks.  Port knocking
and similar schemes aren't going to easily yield their secret after a
full port scan.

So SYN cookies are certainly a hack, since they weren't designed into
the protocol, so there ends up being trade offs.  But the loss of
features only happens during an attack and they allow services to
scale *much* further than they would otherwise.  It's really quite
dramatic the difference between services which turn on cookies under
load versus those which don't.

The scheme I developed was primarily built to provide SYN cookies like
protection for all services, not just TCP based ones.  The port
knocking like behavior was just a side effect of the scheme.  I didn't
want to get into these other details and benefits of the protocol on
this list, since they are quite a bit more complex than the port
knocking replacement, but you may be interested.


Back to IPSec: there are a few reasons I wouldn't come out and say
"Look, IPv6 offers integrated IPSec which is a great improvement":

1. We already have IPSec tunneled over other protocols.  For most
people, it's just as easy to use that.

2. IPSec offers no security if you can't authenticate services.  PKI
is the elephant in the room on this one, and most PKIs suck.

For most people there's probably just not much tangible benefit to
having it integrated.  Yes, it's more elegant and should be more
efficient, but features are selling points to most people, not a few %
of speed.

I am pretty new to OpenVPN. I am scouring the documentation at this
