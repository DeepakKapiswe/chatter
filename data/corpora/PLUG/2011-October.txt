I imagine a 7 inch tablet would be fine.  We are dealing with older
eyes, but I assume we can reduce the amount data displayed rather
than show a regular webpage scrunched to teeny-tiny.  But if we
can't reformat the data, we may need 11 inch.  That helps not so
much.

I wasn't going to join in this general fracas until I was reminded
of the above statement.  It's too late, the 1962 Nobel Peace Prize
was awarded to Linus Pauling.

semi-topical - I use dovecot + procmail to filter email quite
effectively.

Subject: [PLUG] question on moving Gnome menus to Ubuntu Oneiric
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHeieEKK=gRcPpnrQNxP+f8gzmuceQmzbWrnb4t=u-Qjyw@mail.gmail.com>

Is there an easier way to move the panels and menu drop downs from the
old Gnome desktop in Ubuntu 10.04 (lucid) to the new Ubuntu 11.10
(oneiric) than doing it all manually?

While I have Gnome 3 functioning, it is missing lots of the drop downs
and panel items and I would like to transfer the old over, as
painlessly as possible.

Any suggestions?

- Randall

p.s. The unity desktop is missing some icons and I am not sure how to
restore them either.

Not that I have heard of.  Although, what I know of, those who have
successfully gotten the panels and menu drop downs added to Gnome3
experience nothing problems with the panels and programs launched from
the menu drop downs.

I have talked to some of the Gnome developers and there is work to
implement similar features into Gnome3, but since they were trying to
make a "clean" break with Gnome3 code wise to improve desktop
performance, several of the previous features willing not work
correctly or generate exceptions/hangs if ported.

I personally have not tried to yet because of the issues I have seen
others experience.

That has been one of the major complaints that I have heard and seen.

Whatever you decide on, please, please, please make sure it keeps the data
encrypted and a strong password used!
I love to see technology help to make companies and services more efficient,
but the implementation often overlooks security.  A cheap tablet, hacked to
do what you need will likely not be secure.  Even if you get one with
Android AND with the data encrypted, it will likely be painfully slow due to
the encryption unless it has a dedicated chip to encrypt/decrypt the data on
the fly.  I have yet to see such a tablet, not saying they don't exist, but
I haven't seen one.

Remember, whatever conveniences the technology provides, must not be at the
expense of the patent's privacy.

It's a "Linus" conspiracy. Clearly.

Semi-related: anybody know a good way to create and read filtered *web pages*?

Say, I want to peruse the archives, for this list, and black-out
posts, or I want to surf 4chan, while not being able to accidentally
see (and thus download) CP.

Is there a DOM filtering browser tool out there?

Use case:
In a DOM tree, I want to filter on every n*r reference from the web
page, href, etc. Where I see: "goodstring" or "badstring".  Xpath kind
of works, but it's more of a searching system, not a developed content
system.

I guess the big hurdle is the "not this page" issue, where predictive
removal of something from a DOM would require chasing down every link,
and churning through the content...

Dude, patents are publicly disclosed, that's part of the deal with society!  

Oh, wait...

Amen.

I think this is Keith's plan though.

As other posters have mentioned, just make sure that a firm device 
locking mechanism is in place.

It really would be ideal for a Tablet with a Biometric login, where has 
that option been hiding?

I'd love one of these as an Xserver or
VNC client.? The touch screen would be a great interface into Gimp or
other graphics program.? 

Yes, Wacom makes such a digitizing
tablet, but their costs are sky high.

I used a little QOS, to no avail.  The worst problem is once in a while I

I think you will want a stylus - Lenovo has an android tablet with one
(and it's pressure sensitive!) but I don't know if it is out yet, or
what it will cost.

I used to work almost exclusively on a tablet (Lenovo X200-t), and the
stylus *was* great for Gimp selections / painting (not that I do much
of that).

David,

   The fellow who maintains the SlackBuild script (a Dutchman living in Rio)
has a working executable on his Web site. I downloaded that and it runs
well.

   I want it for design work, right now a bathroom vanity and a couple of
medicine cabinets.

Thanks,

Rich

IIRC there are a few different things you need to do if you have both
qt3 and qt4 tools installed.  Bare in mind this is coming from someone
who knows the debian approach best, so YMMV.

1. Set QTDIR environment variable to point at the root of where your
QT libs and includes are installed

2. Make sure that if there is a "moc" and other qt tools (qmake and a
few others) are for the correct version.  on debian-based systems
these tend to be symlinks into the /etc/alternatives directory. I
don't know what slackware does for this.

There's probably things I'm forgetting.

? ? Arch Linux is an independently developed, i686- and x86_64-optimised
? ? Linux distribution targeted at competent Linux users. It uses
? ? 'pacman', its home-grown package manager, to provide updates
? ? to the latest software applications with full dependency tracking.
? ? Operating on a rolling release system, Arch can be installed from
? ? a CD image or via an FTP server. The default install provides a
? ? solid base that enables users to create a custom installation.
? ? In addition, the Arch Build System (ABS) provides a way to easily
? ? build new packages, modify the configuration of stock packages,
? ? and share these packages with other users via the Arch Linux
? ? user repository.

? ? *******************************************************************

? ? ? ? Agenda:

? ? ? ? ? ? 7:00 - 7:30 ?Business
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?We will discuss the status of our ongoing projects
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?including PLUG's monthly Advanced Topics meetings,
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?PLUG's monthly hands on clinics, PLUG for Education,

I have a Bamboo and like it, but it is not a manipulate the surface you're
editing device.

A Linux based tablet like the Lenovo would be a
good thing.? Thanks for the point.

For those wondering
"why not just do the editing on the Android?" the tools aren't
ported to the platform yet.?

Don't the tablets use the same kind of screen as the phones? If so, you
can get a pack of four styluses on eBay for $5-6. I use one with my
Android phone, and it helps a lot when trying to hit small icons.

	in Oregon
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHcJ=a_Y+iTcMLx_HFjc+Rv=H1aXQAbywuMgbkEZDpoiuA@mail.gmail.com>

I lost the ability to rsync into the Ubuntu mirror repository at
"mirrors.cat.pdx.edu" over the past weekend, and trying to use the
"mirror.uoregon.edu" repo also fails.  The pdx repository states that
a network link cannot be made and redirects to "opal.cat.pdx.edu",
while the U of OR link simply replies NOP on the rsync request (had to
take a look inside the TCP packet to figure out what was happening in
this case)

It is close to the official release of Ubuntu Oneiric, could the repos
be limiting access to avoid everyone landing on them and overloading
bandwidth?  Or perhaps the problem is local to me?

The pdx repository has been running well for months, so it was a
surprise to lose access.

I would like to know if these repos are accessible to others in the
Portland area.  Thanks for letting me know.

I too, lost access to cat.pdx.edu, although I was accessing Arch-Linux
repositories. I ended up changing my update server to point to the OSU
OS Lab, which seemed to work fine. Hope this helps!

+1 to the linux-flavor.osuosl.org repos; I have been using them since I 
moved to Oregon, never with any hickup and usually with high throughput. 
I hadn't been aware that Portland State had a mirror!

   It's probably the mayor and city council's fault.

   Anywho, try osuosl.org, The open software lab at Beaver State U. mirrors
many distributions and other F/OSS projects. That's where I get my Slackware
and R upgrades.

Yes, as far as I know, they do.  I think the biggest difference is the
pressure sensitivity.

...and having a built-in spot for the stylus :)

This is a historically proven and very fair statement of his behavior on
this mailing list. Not
to mention that when people do attempt to help him he tends to very
argumentative and always seems
to have some unique situation, according to him, in which no one's

Any question that more than one person has about a Linux related issue
that is answered on this mailing list is valuable.  Openly attacking me
on list when I cannot respond on list without being accused of hostile
behavior is extremely rude and unacceptable.  Is to be any semblance of
professionalism in this community at all?  I have been silent for days,
but still people are attacking me on list with arguably little to no
provocation at this point so that I have to speak out against it.
Offering help if I do not know the issue well enough to give reasonable
let alone correct advice is not help by the way.  Nowhere in the terms
of use for this list does it say that I am aware of, "you cannot ask for
help if you do not give help to others."

That people have to go after divisive threads that are over 10 years old
to accuse me of having a, "history of hostility," is ridiculous.  I am
not hostile towards Keith, I am hostile towards calling God a woman on
list.  I stand by my comment that I hope Linus converts to some form of
religion.  Believing in God makes it easier to accept God.  Aceepting
that which one does not believe is probably the hardest thing to do, yet
for the believer, it is no trouble at all.  For those who totally reject
God, there is only Hell.

Every thread that answers a question about a Linux or OSS related topic
is a good thread for this list.  This thread does not pass this test and
frankly, it needs to die.  If answering the questions of all but certain
people, people who agree with you on everything, is offensive to you,
this list is not for you.  If you can't agree to disagree and instead
decide to openly attack a person who has been silent for days, you are
not affecting this list in a good way.  Does anyone honestly think that
I want to see attack posts from this list in my inbox day after day,
week after week?  I don't.

The statement that I am hostile towards this list is NOT a fair
statement.  I have been hostile towards only political/religious
statements which are technically not acceptable list material in the
first place.  I have never been hostile towards people helping each
other use Linux more effectively.

Merely stating a historical pattern of observed behavior is not "openly
attacking you".
It's much like saying this has been the observed weather pattern.

 Believe that most of the modern conveniences that you enjoy were
researched, developed, and "created" by
people who don't believe in "God."

Politics and religion are not an appropriate topic for this list.

PLUG =  General Linux/UNIX discussion and help; civil and on-topic
PLUG-talk = Off-topic and potentially flammable discussion

There's large amounts of historical evidence that you continually post
"Off-topc and potentially flammable discussions" to the PLUG list. There's
not a reasonable person who given the above stated purposes of each list and
your thread archives who would say otherwise.

At this point, I'm considering subscribing myself...

As Galen Sietz mentioned in a thread in PLUG-TALK, the list
administrators take a different tack to the situation:
http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/2004-May/032032.html

Banning even a single member from this list (no matter what side of
this issue you fall on) has the potential to snowball into something
much nastier; I'd hate to see a GNU/Linux mailing list degenerate into
a walled garden where discussion about free software is maintained by
a select few. The old adage goes "Live and let be", and that's exactly
what I do when reading this list, many times I ignore the originating
sender and focus on the content of the post, amazing right? If the
topic doesn't pertain and/or interest you then perhaps it is in your
best interest to leave it alone. This idle banter about degrading the
quality of the list etc, etc, is only affecting the bigots who choose
to focus on the actions of a solitary troll -- ignore it and move on!
I think we've beaten this horse long enough, can we please drop the
issue?

I agree with all of that. But allow me to play devil's advocate for a bit.
Is it fair to new people coming on to the list to have to deal with this and
just
learn to deal with it their own way? Is it also in the list's best interest
if people find unsubscribing the least painful option? When you look at most
forums the moderators do their best to maintain a healthy environment for
the sharing of info, ideas, thoughts, opinions, and feelings. Maybe my BS
tolerance level is lower than most and maybe that is a personal flaw. But
sadly, I'm choosing to unsubscribe due to this one troll. I cringe each time
I see his name show up in my inbox. Best of luck to the rest of the
PLUGers...

Regards,

It sorta reminds me of the history of how Linus got started, based on
his discussions with Andy Tannebaum. But as strongly as they disagreed
w/r/t the right kind of kernel, their disagreements were on topic for
Linux/Unix. 

Today, Linus is known as a "benevolent dictator" w/r/t Linux
development. Thus, I would not object to a list where there is a
"benevolent dictator"(s) who can gently keep us nudged back onto topic.
But as such, that benevolent dictator needs the authority to enforce
community standards. 

And in our free marketplace of ideas, there's always another group
available for that rare user who might get knocked off here or there.
And there's always another chance for such users to find some maturity.

In fact, this group is the most "hands-off" group that I've seen w/r/t
moderation. I know the Ubuntu lists have some more well defined and
enforced community standards. (ref
http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct )

Thanks,
Mike

Actually, I believe it was a thread several years ago that prompted the creation of the "civil and on-topic" description for the list. I'm not positive, but that thread may have included Michael.

I found what you say interesting up to the point where you called me a
troll.  Is that really any way to treat a fellow Linux user?  I don't
think so, and frankly if this community is going to grow, this kind of
behavior has to STOP.

Maybe the list guidelines aren't strongly defined and perhaps that is an
issue that does need addressing.  First off, there is no penalty for
making a religiously controversial comment, such as, "God is a woman,"
on list.  There is no penalty for saying things like, "Obama has big
shoes to fill, I'll buy him a pair."  The person who pointed out that
Keith broke the rules of the list should not have been the person that
had to face severe consequences.  I was that person.  Those who are
commenting now, most of you are not list moderators.  Remember that
before you continue being self righteous.

I think those who are itching for a fight need to stop and reevaluate
what they are doing and why they are doing it.  Does this behavior help
anyone use Linux?  Does it encourage any people to adopt Linux?  Boy oh
boy, that PLUG list is full of Liberal Democrat thugs, I've just got to
use Linux.

I use Linux because I am a college student who needs something
inexpensive that works.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who can say that.
This community in my opinion is not very diverse if only one person can
stand up and say, "I found your point of view interesting."  The lack of
diversity on PLUG suggests that there is a large population in Oregon
that is not interested in Linux.  Why are people not interested?  

I suppose I can try to hide behind Google mail and hope that things
don't go south again.  I shouldn't have to hide.  Diversity is a
reality, that is why political/religious  comments are against the rules
on this list.  With no enforcement though and no moderating, what's the
point of there being any rules?

The question boils down to this, is the PLUG list going to be an
exclusive club or is it going to be an email list that welcomes
everyone?  If someone is targeted by bigots, is it right to say that the
person can simply go elsewhere?  What will happen if someone stumbles on
PLUG, has a bad experience here, and then he/she is faced with the
question of where to go with Linux?  Chances are, that person will dump
Linux and try to make do with Windows or ReactOS.  Bigotry will be the
ruin of Linux.  May not be today, may not be tomorrow that Linux loses
to Windows...  but what about the day after?  Linux came to be because
Linus Torvalds got help from other people.  Without the Net, Linux may
never have come into existence.  Linux is real, look at the progress
that has been made since the 1.0 kernel.  We are up to the Linux 3
kernel now.  Linus actually lives or did live in our state.  Fermi labs
and other major places including NASA use Linux.  There are college
courses on Linux.  Many Windows programs run on Linux.  And most of us
who use Linux didn't have to: produce it, purchase it, or otherwise seek
a license for it.  Some of us may tweak it here or change it there.
Maybe IBM contributed Postfix.  There is more to talk about, but I'm not
the expert and this is already turning into a major article ;-)

I installed a batch of multi-media applications on my centos5 box a number
of years ago.  I don't think that I used that particular page to help with
the process.  (It may well have been before it was written.)  In any event,
I didn't install the priorities plugin.  (Didn't know that it existed.)  And
in time I did have problems with the rpmforge repo serving up rpms that were
newer than what the centos repos had, and that caused dependency problems.
 I ended up disabling the rpmforge repo.

I've since switched to centos6.  I did find that page this time around, and
cut and paste chunks out of it to install what needed to be installed.  But
I still didn't install the priorities plugin.  And thus far, I haven't
needed it.  I installed centos6 and rpmforge-release in back in July, and
they've been playing nicely together ever since.

With that said, I'm not sure that I've seen an update from rpmforge in that
time.  I've seen plenty from centos, particularly after I installed the cr
repo.  It might be that centos6 is keeping up enough to stay ahead of
rpmforge.

We deal with people like that in every circle, Mike. And it's no big
deal at all to mark Robinson's posts as spam and let the email program
deal with it. Unfortunately for those who get digests, they have to see
his posts or change their habits, but the consequences of banning him or
someone like him seem far greater than asking list members to just
ignore him. Paying Robinson no attention whatever only hurts him and,
for a very short time, newcomers to the list.

Even antiquated old procmail can work wonders in this area.

This is one of those cases where the proposed 'cure' under discussion

Seeing kooks, nuts and crazies on the list is kind of like listening to 
kboo. You know that it's open to all because because there they are.

I saw Michael's reply to Keith before anybody else had responded and 
chose to ignore the poor guy. But just like Michael, many of you 
couldn't resist a confrontation and a chance to smite him mightily. Next 
time, let's just chuckle and let it pass.

Which

Rather than banning Robinson
from the list have a process in the list software
append the subject line
of all his messages with "! KNOWN TROLL !"

This will give
new list members a heads up.? Eventually, if Robinson contributes and
ceases the off topic rants, the appending can cease.

Too bad text

One-way audio is a different issue, usually due to NAT issues.

Re: bandwidth restriction:
It's a good idea to restrict overall bandwidth (including VoIP) at the
gateway to keep from saturating your internet link.  Even if you are using
QoS (which doesn't really help much with UDP protocols like RTMP), your
overall link latency goes waaaay up when the link gets saturated.
The current buzzword for that problem is "bufferbloat".

Saturated links lead to high latency and jitter, dropped packets, and
overall call quality degradation.

The easiest way to prevent it is to throttle bandwidth to a value JUST
BELOW the maximum link bandwidth.  So with a 1.5Mbps DSL link, limit it to
~1.4Mbps or so.  (Try it out: push a lot of data through the link while
pinging the nearest upstream gateway, and watch the ping times go from
~90ms to ~2000ms and back to ~90ms as you tune the throttling)

Ever read "The Scarlet Letter"? Might as well shoot him, and be done.

I'm not a moderator of this list, nor even an actively participating
member of PLUG in terms of going to meetings or Free Geek on Sundays.

However, I do follow the list in digest form and sometimes attempt to
help others resolve problems they encounter with Linux. And I learn a
lot just reading the list, which helps me keep my own system running.

I think I was also the first person to object to Michael's rant about
the ReactOS people kicking him off their IRC channel, or whatever, on
the basis that he *knew* it was off-topic because he prefixed with an
[OT] flag, and it was about a crazy Russian Windows clone project and
had nothing to do with Linux. I wrote that it was inappropriate here.

Since then it's blown up, but I've stayed out of it and just watched,
but now I'm going to say some things and I will try to keep it brief.

The hint "civil and on-topic" apparently hasn't been well understood,
at least not by Michael. That means no politics, no religion, no how,
and maybe it could be made explicit, but I doubt that will help much.

Michael: I don't care what you might or might not believe, nor should
you care what I or anyone else on this list believes, or even makes a
passing joke about. That you did so was a trespass upon their rights,
and you know the Lord's Prayer, right? "Forgive us our trespasses..."

I think you owe Keith a public apology for having insulted him over a
word he used in just a joke. How dare you try to impose your beliefs?

For everyone else: I apologize for writing as such length, but I will
finish what I have to say. Ironically perhaps, I don't think the PLUG
list should ban Michael, unless and until he fails to learn from this
experience. It doesn't bother me to skip over his long posts on stuff
that I know nothing about, as it doesn't for any other member's posts.

But, I'm not running systems trying to do everything all at once, way
out in the puckerbrush. So if Michael has questions, let him ask 'em.

If he can't google and find answers, use man pages or learn how to do
troubleshooting, well, that's his problem. We can try to help, though,
because that's what a Linux user group is and we should live up to it.

However, if Michael refuses to apologize to Keith, I will say ban him.

There is nothing more dangerous than religious intolerance, and in far
too many parts of the world that gets people murdered. It is the evil,
and if Michael will not tolerate others then we should banish him now.

Regards,
Robert

I recently acquired some spare parts for a Sequent S500/SE30. I have 
processor, memory, CSM boards, some PBay disks, and power supplies. A 
dumb terminal, an STK 9730 library with no drives. Anything anyone wants 
is free for the asking, or it goes to Free Geek.

Subject: [PLUG] Max Number of Terminals/CLIs
Message-ID: <1317784486.29406.82.camel@Maui>

Folks, 

For some reason, I can't find / (or google) the limit on the number of
terminals that you can open in a GUI. I assume the limit is on the
number of CLIs (e.g. if the limit is 100, I assume that I could open ten
terminals with 10 tabs each). I presume the limit is in some
configuration file someplace. Which file would it be?

Thanks,
Mike

An XTerm session uses a pts device (in /dev/pts).  I don't know of a limit
to the number of pts (other than max open files, /proc/sys/fs/file-max),
but I think each pts uses a pty, which is limited by
/proc/sys/kernel/pty/max

  me at myhost:~$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/pty/max 
  4096

Just curious, why do you ask?

Ahhhhh, that makes sense. It would incorporate remote connections too
(ssh, telnet, etc.) I'm actually in the middle of writing a book for
Solaris 11 (yeah I know, I should be at OOW now, but that's another
story). 

But you've given me enough of a clue to point me to pt_cnt
in /etc/system, which if I understand correctly, has been dynamically
allocated since Solaris 8, starting with 48 and going up.

Appreciate your help!

Thanks,
Mike

Dear All:


I want to find out how Flash player render videos (e.g. movies in h.264)
esp. how it uses the platform HW for video acceleration.    I tried googling
around but could not locate any info.   Maybe because Adobe purposedly keeps
it a secret.

Does anyone know where I can find such info?

I have often seen the message "Xlib: Maximum number of clients reached".  
This limit applies to all of your windows (not just terminal emulators) 
plus some sockets and X11 IPC.  Depending on your X version, you might 
only be able to open around 250 emulator windows.

Until somewhat recently, MAXCLIENTS=256 was compiled into Xorg, then it 
got bumped to 512, and is now finally going to become a setting in the 
config file?  I often have ~60 terminals, ~70 konquerors, ~80 gvims, 
and other assorted windows in my typical taskbar.  But it's not just 
crazies like me who hit the limit anymore:  Apparently firefox and 
google-chrome are using multiple "windows" to render sub-parts of a 
page (probably to manage tabs too) and each of these count as 
a "client".

Message-ID: <4E8DCFEB.3050308@zenlinux.com>

Hi all,

Every time I've run into Michael Dexter I've told him I've been meaning 
to put together another talk for PLUG. I think it's finally time for me 
to get the ball rolling on this.

I'm open to giving a talk on one of a few different subjects, and 
thought I'd leave it to the group to pick which one. So vote with 
replies to this thread and I'll put something together - I would just 
like more than a month to prepare (so I could do this in December or later).

Potential Topics:

* An overview of Autotools/Autoconf
* An overview and comparison of RPM vs. DEB packaging formats

* I could also do a talk on the Yocto Project, a build system and 
framework for developing embedded Linux images. I gave a talk a while 
back about OpenEmbedded, which is now a part of Yocto. I have plenty of 
things I can talk about with Yocto (it's my day job at Intel) that the 
presentation wouldn't be a re-hash of my OE talk.

I'll leave it to the organizers to decide whether these should be 
general meeting presentations vs. advanced topics. The autotools one in 
particular might be hard to not be an advanced topics meeting. ;)

I'll keep the choices simple with these three options. Feel free to vote 
away!

Scott

That would be interesting to me. It might also be interesting to hear
something about distribution-specific alternatives, even though they are
not as mainstream.

You are a hero!  I would be proud to buy you tasty beverages in appreciation.

OE/Yocto would be amazingly good.  But Autotools would be excellent, too.

I've built and maintained packages and archives for RPM and DEB, the
differences never seemed that significant to me.  I would love to be wrong.
It's a shame that DebDelta never got traction on Ubuntu, though...

Interesting stuff. In Solaris 11 early adapter, /usr/include/xorg/misc.h
still implies a MAXCLIENTS of 256, despite some literature suggesting
that they have code that supports 1024 clients, with the -clients switch
in some Xorg config file. 

Appreciate the insight!

Subject: [PLUG] SD cards always mount read-only
Message-ID: <20111007134333.608a8b1b@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Fedora 14, x86_64 on Thinkpad T61.

About six months ago I bought a Transcend 32 GB SD card for my (then)
new Android phone. Foolishly I bought the mini size, not the micro
size. Before returning it I tried it in my laptop, only to discover
that it mounted read-only. I tried various things (now forgotten), but
failed to get it to mount read-write. Since it was the wrong size for
the phone I returned it to Amazon. 

Then I bought a Transcend 32 GB micro SD card that came with an
adapter. Again, I tried to mount it in the laptop, but it also mounted
read-only. But when I put it in the phone I had no problems - Android
happily mounted it read-write. I continue to use it in the phone.

The other day I found a deal on a Sandisk 32 GB micro SD card, so I
bought it. Like the Transcend, it came with an adapter. My plan was to
use it as additional storage on the laptop. However, like its
predecessors, it mounts read-only.

Here is some command line information:

$dmesg |tail
[51144.370076] mmcblk0: mmc0:e624 SU32G 29.7 GiB (ro)
[51144.370190]  mmcblk0: p1

$ mount
/dev/mapper/vg_devil8-lv_root on / type ext4 (rw)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
/dev/sda1 on /boot type ext3 (rw)
none on /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc type binfmt_misc (rw)
sunrpc on /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs type rpc_pipefs (rw)
fusectl on /sys/fs/fuse/connections type fusectl (rw)
gvfs-fuse-daemon on /home/jjj/.gvfs type fuse.gvfs-fuse-daemon
(rw,nosuid,nodev,user=jjj) /dev/mmcblk0p1 on /media/D198-2DA6 type vfat
(ro,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=udisks,uid=500,gid=500,shortname=mixed,dmask=0077,utf8=1,showexec,flush)

I suspect I need to add it to fstab and specify somehow that it is to
be mounted read-write. In the process, I'd like to name it something
other than mmcblk0p1. I read man fstab, but couldn't figure out exactly
how to do this. Or maybe fstab is not the way to fix the problem. 

Suggestions?

John,

   Create a mount point for it; e.g., /mnt/tinycard/. Then, as root, tail and
follow /var/log/messages (tail -f /var/log/messages) and insert the card and
adapter in a USB port. You'll see the name of the device assigned to that
port; e.g., sdb1.

   Then, in /etc/fstab create a line for it to be mounted. Here I have
several external USB devices that I mount as needed:

/dev/sdb         /mnt/thumb       vfat        noauto,users,rw  0   0
/dev/sdc         /mnt/flashdrive  vfat        noauto,users,rw  0   0
/dev/sdb1        /mnt/zip         vfat        noauto,users,rw  0   0

   Now, when you insert your SD card you can type 'mount /mnt/tinycard' and
it should be there.

   In my case, the problem is remembering which device is associated with
which mount point. :-)

Thanks for the suggestion, but I must have failed to follow the
instructions and it did not work.

I started by creating /media/SD as the future mount point.

Then I manually ejected and reinserted the card and did #tail
-f /var/log/messages. At first I saw references to mmc0, so I assumed
that mmc0 was the name of the device. So I added:

/dev/mmc0 /media/SD vfat noauto,users,rw 0 0

To /etc/fstab. 

After altering /etc/fstab I manually ejected and then reinserted the
card. But now it no longer appears at all. And tail
-f /var/log/messages just shows an error:

Oct  7 22:01:14 Devil8 kernel: [81894.186265] mmc0: error -110 whilst
initialising SD card

So I commented out the new line in /etc/fstab and tried again, but now
all I can get is the above error message. Note that it won't mount
anywhere, even without the reference to mmc0 in /etc/fstab.

Dmesg has also stopped reporting anything. With the card manually
ejected I get:

[root at Devil8 jjj]# dmesg |tail
<snipped irrelevant messages>
[81894.186265] mmc0: error -110 whilst initialising SD card

After reinserting the card I get the same exact message. It's not
reacting to the eject and reinsert.

Maybe I broke the card while ejecting and reinserting?

Message-ID: <1318052156.24389.5.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

I had to replace my DSL modem with one that is PPPoE capable.
My old modem is pre ADSL2/2+.  It is bridged where Opus threw 
the manuals for it out a long time ago.  Should I simply take this to
the dump and put it in the computers section or is anyone interested?
The modem is a D-Link DSL 500 modem.  The modem still works, but
CenturyLink requires PPPoE now.  Note that the modem is bridged and that
I lack the necessary information to change that.  I can throw in a
microfilter that came with it and the D-Link CD.  I also have a serial
cable that came with it.

I took the SD card out of the laptop and the adapter and put it into my
Android phone. The phone reported that it was damaged and asked if I
wanted to format it. Since the card was blank I told the phone to do
so. After it finished the phone happily mounted the card.

Then I took the card out of the phone and inserted it back into the
laptop. Now I get:

[jjj at Devil8 ~]$ dmesg |tail
[83821.802409] end_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 4

response 0x0, card status 0x0 [83821.815140] end_request: I/O error,
dev mmcblk0, sector 7

The tail -f /var/log/messages command gives me more or less the same
output as dmesg |tail.

Apparently something in what I did trying to follow the instructions
damaged the SD card. 

I think I need a command that clearly tells me exactly what Fedora 14
thinks the name of the device is. The results of dmesg and tail
commands give me confusing results. There must be a command that gives
a list of all devices attached to the computer. And, since the phone
just "reformatted" the card without saying anything about what file
system it used, it would be helpful to find out what file system it
currently has. And maybe I should just reformat it with the laptop,
where I can specify vfat. Except the laptop cannot currently see it.

I now have what seems like a trivial problem, but I expect to encounter 
similar situations in the future. I have an account on vkrugudruzei, a 
Russian-language social site. I am able to type in either English or 
Russian and have it displayed properly to the recipient of a message.

Someone there mentioned that their native language was actually Armenian. I 
added that keyboard, and it is displayed properly here, though I don't

However, in the message received, all these characters appear as question marks. Does anyone know what the problem is? (I'm using 64-bit Natty, though I suppose this issue is more general in nature.)

Your best bet is to use 'parted /dev/mmcblk0' and have it write a new disk
label.  Then create the partition(s) on the disk.

I think the problem you are having is that you are mounting the device
instead of the partition which means that you managed to mung the partition
table.  Once you run the parted command and create a partition, you should
see both mmcblk0 and mmcblk0p0 (or possibly mmcblk0p1, trying to do this
from memory) devices show up in your /var/log/messages.  You want to mount
the mmcblk0p0 device.

I may be wrong but the way to read the mmcblk0p0 is mmc(MultiMediaCard)
blk(Block device) 0(#0) p0(Partition #0).

Hope this helps,
 Jason

When glyphs appear as question marks, empty spaces, or blank
rectangles, that means that the font used to display the message lacks
the required glyphs. The solution is to go into the preferences or
setup for the application in question and change its default or display
font to one that contains the necessary glyphs. 

As for Armenian, you can see the phonology and characters required to
render it in their native script on Wikipedia:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_language

You might also search on Unicode character sets. I'm positive that there
is one for Armenian, although I don't know the beginning and ending
code points. Most desktops today (Gnome, KDE, etc.) come with a font
viewer applet that should display the glyphs in the fonts that you have
installed. Once you know the Unicode section for Armenian, you can
scroll down to see which of your fonts contain the necessary glyphs.

You may also find help in your package manager. If you search on
Armenian you may find font packages that you can install from your
repositories.

Although I find their religio-political actions abhorrent, the Summer
Institute of Linguistics (SIL) may offer additional fonts and resources.

   I doubt it. Do you have a bunch of /dev/mmc... whatevers? I'm completely
unfamiliar with what sort of device that might be, but the USB flash drives
are usually seen by the kernel as equivalent of SCSI drives, hence an
assignment to /dev/sb... (for SCSI block device).

   Strange, John. The high density SD card I use with the video camera is
seen as /dev/sdb1, which is what I mount on /mnt/zip (because I ran out of
clever names).

   Others more expert than I need to take over now.

OK, after a night's sleep and my morning coffee it occurred to me that
my computer has several GUI disk utilities that might help.

I started with Palimpsest, which has the handy ability to read
information from Smart drives. Palimpsest once diagnosed a failing hard
drive on another computer, and saved me potential headaches.

When I launched Palimpsest at first it did not see the SD card. But
after I popped the card out and reinserted it Palimpsest automatically
added it to the list of devices. And Nautilus automatically opened a
file browser window. I noted in the Nautilus window that reformatting
it on my phone had added LOST.DIR and Android-secure folders.

Palimpsest reported the following potentially useful information:

DRIVE:
Model: 			SU32G
Firmware version: 	12/2010
Capacity: 			32 GB
Partitioning: 		Master boot record
Serial number:		0c38530e
Device:			/dev/mmcblk0
Rotation rate:		Solid state disk
Connection:		SDIO
Smart status		Not supported

In the DRIVE section Palimpsest offers buttons for Format Drive, and
for Benchmark.

VOLUMES:
Usage:			Filesystem
Partition type		W95 FAT32 (LBA) (0x0c)
Partition flags		Bootable
Type:			FAT (32 bit version)
Device:			/dev/mmcblk0p1
Partition label:		-
Capacity:			32 GB
Available:			-
Mount point:		Mounted at /media/2535-1DF9

In the VOLUME section Palimpsest offers buttons for Unmount Volume,
Check Filesystem, Delete Partition, Format Volume, and Edit Partition.

The only button I tried was Edit Partition, which popped up a little
window with Partition Label (grayed out), Type (drop-down, currently at
"W95 FAT32 (LBA) (0x0c), and offering many other filesystem types),
plus a check box for "Bootable," which is checked. I exited the window
without changing anything.

My original line in fstab was:

/dev/mmcblk0 /media/SD vfat noauto,users,rw 0 0

But that always generated error messages that /dev/mmcblk0 did not
exist. So, armed with the information from Palimpsest I changed it to:

/dev/mmcblk0p1 /media/SD vfat noauto,users,rw 0 0

However, that generates error messages that /dev/mmcblk0p1 does not
exist. 

I'm still not there, but I feel I am getting closer. Some questions:

Do I need this thing to be bootable? I will use it just for additional
storage. Would removing the Bootable flag do anything to resolve the
problem? (Probably not.)

The partition type is W95 VFAT (LBA) (0x0c). What do "LBA" and "0x0c"
mean? Is the "vfat" in my fstab line the correct way to tell fstab what
filesystem it is? I might want to use the card to transfer files to
other people's computers, so VFAT is probably the best choice, but
there are other VFAT options in the Palimpsest drop-down. Should I
reformat it to a different filesystem?

Subject: [PLUG] PPPoE, DSL, ...
Message-ID: <20111008211536.GA31703@gate.kl-ic.com>

FINALLY have the DSL working sorta-kinda at the new office.  I did
not want to use the standard/only Actiontec PK5000, so I bought a
simpler Actiontec GT701D, and the network is now running with that.

BTW, I looked around inside with telnet with username admin, and
the admin password.  It is running a Monte Vista 2.4.17 kernel, 
with Busybox on a 160MHz MIPS cpu, 16MB RAM.  One can look in 
the proc tables to find the pppd password and other goodies.  

Anyway, I'm learning about Qwest/CenturyLink DSL, and PPPoE and
such.  I want to firewall my system with an Alix (which will do
internal DNS, split off a DMZ with occasional bandwidth throttling
for PTP wireless, terminate VPN links, etc.).  It appears possible
(but not necessarily easy or prudent) to run the Actiontec in 
bridge mode, instead of it as a NAT/DNS/DHCP box.  I would use
the Alix for most of the work, and transition to IPv6 at the Alix
end in a year or three. 

I assume I can run pppd from the Alix instead, using something
resembling the pppd command that the Actiontec is using.  

But is this wise?  Pluggers have been talking about DSL and PPP
and bridge mode on the list for a decade now.  Some of you might
have useful suggestions about how I should proceed for the next 
decade.  Suggestions?

If you don't like me bringing up open source projects that don't involve
Linux, you don't have to read the PLUG list.  You should listen to David
Mandel who says that bringing up non Linux OSS is acceptable.

If you don't like religious comments from me, you don't have to put up
with them from Keith or anyone else either.

Same goes for political comments.

"--Don't take the next two paragraphs too seriously--"

Know what I should do, I should come to the PLUG meeting with enough
dynamite strapped to my body to take out a building.  I'd go to hell
for it, but at least I'd take some bigots down with me.

Seriously though, I'm not going to join the conservative army of the
Midwest unless Obama becomes president again and ruins whats left of our
economy.  When that happens, all bets are off.  When the second civil
war comes, at least I know which side I'll be on.  When eastern Oregon
purges western Oregon of liberal life hating democrats, I know which
side I'll be on.  Those who pollute my home with their socialist and
anti life rhetoric will see no mercy shown to them.

Still reading?  No, I'm not a sleeping terrorist.  This should be seen
as far enough out there that it can make a point, but not cause undo
alarm.  How do you think the list reads for me when people twist every
comment I make and preferentially target me for ridicule?

I don't believe in worship of one's wife.  I do not believe that high
taxes on the rich is a legitimate strategy to stimulate the economy, but
I am adamant about protecting the environment and helping the poor.
Taxing the rich to give jobs to the poor will only undermine people's
incentive to work.  I am still deeply offended by Keith's wife worship
and I will never apologize to Keith concerning the vulgar display he put
on here.

Indeed, nobody can have a religious or political opinion that is not in
line with those who are receiving preferential treatment here.  Why
should I have to put up with wife idolatry or comments on how great
Obama is?  Do I have to care about Obama's shoe problems?  How about the
way Obama pulled us out of a fight we were winning in Iraq only to
bungle the fight in Afghanistan?  How many people have to die in
Afghanistan before we realize that being there isn't the answer?  It's
just Vietnam all over, we don't know who to trust and our people are
frequently outgunned and outflanked.  How many Chinook helicopters do we
have to lose?

The civil war I speak of is fictional at the moment, thank God.  Thing
is, if we the American people don't get our moral bearings, we can
expect one soon enough.  The way liberal news reporters rip at
Republican candidates, there is going to be a backlash.  There is more
than just a difference of opinion between liberals and conservatives,
Republicans and Democrats, there is genuine hatred bubbling up.
Unfortunately, I see both Republicans and Democrats heading to the
extremes.  This is dangerous, the need for common ground and common
values is greater than it has been for probably a century.  I want a
candidate who: respects human life, respects the environment, sees the
need to replace our reliance on foreign oil with hydrogen, and I want a
candidate who will get us out of Afghanistan as soon as possible.  I
want a candidate who will not endanger marriage by giving the title
married to same sex couples.  Every child deserves to be the result of a
loving union between a husband and a wife, not two women and a dozen
anonymous sperm donors.  We deserve male and female parents and we
deserve to be both well treated and well raised by them.

In short, tune out if you must.  Let the hatred bubble and the country
turn in on itself.  Democracy is fragile where only the grace of God,
because there is freedom of religion, allows our democracy to persevere.
There is no religious freedom when idolatry is the norm and you can't
protest it.  There is no religious freedom when an anti life president
is literally worshiped by his most ardent followers and his detractors
are excluded from public discourse.  Obama is the least ethical and
weakest president this nation has ever had.  Obama has almost, by his
policies, set off another great depression.  Ban me?  Ignore me at your
peril.  There is another viewpoint that is opposite to the preferred
one, a viewpoint that could be correct and that could carry with it dire
consequences.

Franklin Delano Roosevelt did not pull this nation out of the Great
Depression, World War 2 did.  Obama is not the answer.  Civil war is not
the answer.  If the exodus from moderate politics continues though,
civil war will come.

Y'know what?  I have better things to do with my time than hang about
a "Linux" list that will do nothing to prevent trolls making a mess of
the place.  If I wanted to watch trolls destroying community I already
know where to find 4chan; I don't need this from a nominally
Linux-focus group.

Michael, you suck.  Seriously, suck.  Sadly, I know this is the
reaction you want to get, but whatever.  Continue to try and destroy,
and hopefully any other places I run into you will take a stand
against this sort of awfulness.

Michael, please do not contact me privately to whine about my
position, or statements.  I have no interest in "discussion" with you
on the subject.

Liar.  This wasn't a private message to me.  You asked for a response
Daniel by putting this on the list.  I won't email you privately, but
if you get the message because you publicly follow the PLUG list which
you have polluted with your post, that's your problem.  Prove that I
actually intend to destroy the PLUG list.  The only thing I want to
destroy is preferential treatment and blatant prejudice.  Oh and by the
way, suck is a bit juvenile.  The reaction I want Daniel is to wake
people up and if it takes shock and awe to do that, so be it.  The
hatred has to stop, or maybe we can simply take this outside till
everyone is lying dead face down on the streets of Portland.

Yep, I'm gone.

Michael, Keith, this IS a technology list. Your religious commentary
has NO business being discussed.

Michael in particular - arguing on the internet is just annoying for
everyone on this list. I've seen more disgusting, bigoted, and
hate-filled things come from you, and yet you claim to be a religious
person. Grow up. Jesus was not a Christian. His behavior was very
different from your behavior. He accepted people as they were with few
exceptions.

Ahem, I've said nothing bigoted.  You are attacking religiosity though
which is bigoted.  To say that Christ was not and is not Christian is
ludicrous.  Christ didn't adhere to misguided Judaism or nothing for
that matter just to "please everyone."  In fact, Christ had standards
and He expected people to meet them.  The woman at the well in the heat
of the afternoon who had multiple husbands, Christ knew about this and
was critical of it.  Forgiving the woman is not the same as accepting
what her lifestyle was at that time.  Should God encourage man to do
what is good or should God be passive and look the other way when we
choose that which is harmful or even fatal to us or others?  Surely, the
parable of servants being sent to gather people for a feast resonates
with you.  The servants were beat up and killed.  So, the king razed the
dwellings of these tenants and said find someone else for the feast.
When the King saw that one of the people who came to the feast was not
dressed properly, he ordered the man bound, gagged, and thrown into the
street.  Doesn't sound like a parable of anything goes to me.  Reducing
Jesus to a weakling is wrong.  You are trying to silence political
criticism as well I might add by doing this.  

I have a right if Keith or anyone else is allowed to break the rules of
this list with impunity to denounce publicly that breaking of the rules.
If there is to be no moderating, what is the value of having rules
anyways?  In an ideal world, a moderator posts a retraction or removes
the offending post from the archive.  That isn't happening and Keith at
least is not taking responsibility for what he did.

If Jesus accepted people as they were, exactly as they were, with no
exceptions, then He had no reason to come and He would not have come.
Who needed saving if anything goes?  Who needs grace if their is: no
morality, no vice, and no sin?  Look Walker, you are entirely flawed in
your line of argument.  Jesus is not and was not a passive figure who
waved anything and everything on.  Jesus died for the sins of this world
so that by joining oneself to His death one can be with Him in heaven.
Jesus took the sin of the world upon Himself and died so that we may
live.  Only God's self sacrifice, the Son to the Father, was enough for
God to reconnect with man on the supernatural plane.  No amount of burnt
offerings can ever matched Jesus on the cross.  Jesus became the new
Adam, Mary the new Eve.  Walker, you don't understand Christ at all.
Christ, fully God and fully man, reconciled man to God in a way that man
never can.  Man breaks his connection with God, Jesus gives man a way to
reestablish that lost connection.

Criticizing a lifestyle that is objectively immoral is not bigotry.
Attacking religiosity, a gift from Almighty God, is bigotry.  I
justifiably criticize same sex couples who want to be called married
couples, married couples are not same sex.  Jesus defined marriage as
being between one man and one woman and this is abundantly clear in the
scriptures.  Unfortunately, man's notion of fairness and equality gets
in the way of understanding God's definitions of fairness and equality.

A good example of this, the parable where the workers in the vineyard
get the same pay no matter when they started working.  To most people,
this strikes them as unjust or unfair.  This is the wrong
interpretation.  Remember, these parables came from Jesus himself.

If arguing is annoying to people, they should speak up for themselves
when the rules of this list are violated.  If this is to be a tech list,
there is an expectation that religion and politics won't be thrown in
your face even as a joke.  For one person who thinks that God is
insignificant, idolatry means nothing to him.  But for the religious
man, idolatry is extremely offensive.  In one man's view, Obama is going
to bring peace and equality.  To another man, Obama is a radical liberal
who violated one man one woman by his removal of don't ask don't tell
and worse than that, Obama has thrust the nation into what is becoming
increasingly a Vietnam like war in Afghanistan.  For the religious man,
it is clear that God alone can still the heart of man.  Peace does not
come at the point of a barrel or the tip of a patriot missile.  What I
am not saying is that war can't be justified.  Where war is often the
only tool man uses to secure peace though, God has the answer when man
prays and seeks His help.

What on Earth is your problem?  Speech is not illegal.  I had a
disclaimer, so I didn't really threaten anyone.  Yes I shocked people, 
I had to.  I've tried to say all along, "don't take me literally all the
time," but if people don't listen I can't help that.  A lot of this is a
result of people not listening.  Shock and awe only works if you say
something that grabs enough attention to do some good.  I'm sorry that
people ignored the don't take this too seriously disclaimer.  Reality
check, you don't announce that you are going to blow something up before
you do so if your intent is bodily harm.  Without the element of
surprise, the target could get away.  Not to mention, you are asking to
get caught before you can pull it off.  The fact that I said don't take
this too seriously and the added fact that I said I'm going to do a
horrific thing proves I'm not going to.  What else could I have said to
get across how angry I am at this community for it's blatant
discrimination and preferential treatment of certain people,
specifically Keith?

Maybe fbi.gov does need a heads up, not concerning me, but concerning
the stupidity of certain people and the lengths they will go to to win
against a man who says, "maybe I should blow you up."  I have no
intention of causing mass physical destruction, but you don't antagonize
a person who says something like this.  The point is, people feel
threatened and yet they hate me enough to push me which is the point I
wanted to make.  If I were unstable, this pushing is equivalent to
asking to get killed.  Wake up, you don't push people's
religious/political buttons when they appear to be approaching a point
where they could hurt someone over it.  Being silent is not working, two
months of hell on this list being proof of that.  Correcting people
doesn't seem to matter, the hate runs so deep.

I am trying to find another Linux list, but so far I am having very
little luck.  Whether it is the asterisk list or the Silicon Valley
Linux user's group, it seems that I can't get on.  I'm sure that
everyone here wants me to dump Linux and badmouth it to everyone I 
meet.  Linux is not the exclusive privilege of the God hating freaks of
the world.

There are over 500 people on this list. 

It appears that one member is killing it. 

I can think of just 30 or so that actively participate. I hope that someone is someday able to teach discretion to Michael. 

Today is a sad day for the plug mailing list.

Would you be kind enough to take your free speech to government 
property, the only place with guaranteed free speech.

But if you insist on turning this into a religious forum, please 
start at the beginning - and tell us where GOD came from? And why 
that same explanation could NOT explain where the universe came from 
without requiring a GOD in between.

Thanks
JK

Are you all serious?  You ALL need to shut the hell up.  I really could care less what the beef is between you all - but this list is the last place to be regurgitating it.  No one is killing the list.  You are killing my inbox, though.  If the religious and political rants aren't iin the proper section, then the mods can do something about it.  Otherwise you all need to practice some internet 101.

The person in question has been going off apparently since 2004. I do
not know if/what the moderators have tried since.

While I've put that person in my spam filter, I see enough from the
reactions / copy of his emails from others -- his latest rant would have
gotten him arrested (or more) in any US airport, even pre-9/11.

So while the reactions of some to leave the list make me sad, I find it
understandable. At this point, I do not know whether moderator actions
would be sufficient. Even if the person in question is successfully
stopped from participating on the list, the implied threat of violence
still remains.

Thanks,
Mike

And it appears the winner is - an overview of Autotools/Autoconf! By 
just a hair. :)

Someone told me Michael Dexter is in Europe, so I'll coordinate with him 
when he has time to figure out which month this meeting will be (again, 
December would be the earliest I could do this, but I know some user 
groups skip meetings in Dec).

Subject: [PLUG] This list
Message-ID: <4E93293D.2000908@gmail.com>

All,

I would like to take a moment and thank the majority of you that have 
helped me learn Linux.  I am no sys admin, just a guy that runs Ubuntu, 
Kubuntu, and Fedora on his laptops.  I am now, thanks to the patience of 
many of you, able to take care of the small problems that arise on these 
machines by consulting Mr. Google, without bothering you.

That said, I would like to add my two cents to the latest (on going) 
discussion...

I came to this list to get help with Linux issues.  I have learned, over 
the years, that many of the discussions here are beyond my 
understanding, mostly because I don't run servers, mail lists, etc.  I 
have set my email client to thread discussions and am competent at 
deleting the threads that are not germane.  Often, I read some of them 
with the idea that someday I may find the information useful.

This list, as far as I can tell, has some of the best and brightest 
"Open Source" minds that the country has to offer...We all have 
different opinions, ideas, & world views.  This list is not an 
appropriate place for what is happening.  I don't pretend to have any 
ownership here (other than the desire to learn Linux).  I don't consider 
it my place to say what is right or wrong here.

My question is, is there some way to end the public argument here and 
take it to some other more appropriate (private?) venue?

I, too, am ready to unsubscribe.

Bruce

I suggest that everyone apply a jive filter to our favourite troll's
messages. I have been entertained for whole minutes in this way.

Even better: he might consider applying the filter himself before
sending the messages, which would save us the effort, and considerably
soften the tone of the list. As a bonus, his concerns about being
taken seriously would be effectively erased.

The only way to end it is to ignore the irrelevant bits and do what we can
to help with the relevant bits.

Right now, everyone who engages the irrelevant bits contributes to the
problem, rather than the solution.

Setting Robinson's messages as junk has served me for for the time I've 
been in this list.

And now it isn't just one person disrupting the on-topic discussions, it 
is also everyone who responded, who keeps his posts alive, who feeds the 
troll.

When the whole room disrupts into arguments about one person being 
disruptive, it's time to leave the room.

Message-ID: <CABWFOjsdV_urmupOdv1tmbY0XUFsPJeHBkTGDNhczH8BmjW3KQ@mail.gmail.com>

Shalom

I'm working on something called the C++ Middleware Writer (CMW).  The
CMW is the back tier of a 3-tier system.  The middle and front tiers are
open-source and are available here --
http://webEbenezer.n...ntegration.html<http://webebenezer.net/build_integration.html>.
There's an archive on that page that you can download.  When the software
is built, a library and two executables are created.  I'm interested in
finding
bugs in the library or the two executables.  The contest is focused on
finding run-time problems in either of the two tiers or the library that can

be downloaded.  I'll want to reproduce the problem here before awarding
the money to someone.  The open-source tiers run on both Windows and
Linux.  I have access to Linux and two versions of Windows 7 here.

There's a contest status page here --
http://webEbenezer.net/contest <http://webebenezer.net/contest> .

At this time that page has the following:
$50 contest history/status
Oct. 9th, 2011 -- 6:00pm -- open

-------------------------------------------------------------------
The contest can be in one of three states: open, closed or on hold. I only
plan to award one prize at this time so if someone reports (probably
best to copy me on an email) what they believe to be a problem, I'll
change the status to on hold until deciding if the reported problem is a
bug or not.

If the status is on hold, you may not want to report your findings until
either a negative decision is made on the pending matter or the contest
reopens.  Depending on how things go with this, I'll close the contest
after the first bug is agreed upon, but may reopen it at a later date.

If you need any help building or starting the software, let me know.
Thank you for your interest.

Michael,

I'm very reluctant to write this letter, but ...

The main PLUG mailing list is for technical, business, and
philosophical discussions relating to Linux and other Open Source
Software.

The PLUG-Talk list is for discussions on most any topic so long as
they are civil and done with tolerance.

Unfortunately, you have consistently violated these rules.  (Yes,
others have violated these rules as well and I will be dealing with
them as well; but you have been the worst violator.)

Your letter with the subject of "Ban me? Ban yourselves." was the
final straw.   The PLUG community feels threatened by your statements.

Unfortunately, at this point I must take action to save the PLUG
community as many members are unsubscribing from the lists.

Thus, I am dropping you from all PLUG mailing lists effective immediately.
Please do not resubscribe, either using your current name/email or any
other name/email.
You are not welcome to post to the PLUG list under any name.
Please do not attend PLUG events as some of our members feel
threatened and may call police.

However, I did mean to post a copy of this letter to the list as I

Speaking of Android, is there yet a good "cheapo" tablet yet for all the
groupons, coupons, boarding passes, etc. that many of us are still
printing out today.

With the number of things that can now be carried by Android, I'm
thinking it's time to grab some small one, something that could also
include the contents of a guide book for vacations, etc.

One interesting possibility -- the $35 tablet in India, probably $70
when released here

I heard on a radio interview that the new India tablet only last 1-2 hours
on a charge, and the screen is not very responsive to touch commands.

There has been discussion of it, uniformly unfavorable, on the Android
forum. Apparently it lasts only a few hours of use before it breaks.

<Long discussion of details snipped>

Today I spent a couple hours trying everything I could think of,
including live CDs of Lucid, Knoppix, and the utility/rescue CDs GRML
and The Ultimate Boot CD. I used mkfs, parted and Gparted, palimpsest,
fsck and several others that I can't remember now. Nothing could touch
it. I can't reformat it, delete, move or resize the partition, edit the
boot flag, or change the disk label. Everything reported the same error:
"the device is read-only."

Then I called SanDisk technical support, but after 20 minutes on hold I
gave up. They also have web-based chat support where I was finally able
to communicate with someone. He insisted that he couldn't help me until
I had the device inserted in a Windows computer. I asked for an RMA and
he said he could not give me an RMA until he was able to "troubleshoot"
the card on a Windows computer.

I am becoming increasingly suspicious that SanDisk has some kind of
rootkit that blocks using the card on any but the devices they are
willing to support, and that does not include Linux.

Tomorrow I must go to PSU for class. I will take the card with me in
the hopes of finding a Windows laptop that has an SD card reader. I can
check out a laptop at the library, but I don't know if they have SD
card slots. Or I can go to computer help in the basement of Smith.
Someplace there must be a computer I can try it with. 

If I do not find success tomorrow then I will return it to
1SaleADay.com where I bought it. Mind you, the problem may be in the
Thinkpad, but either way the card is useless if I can't get it to work
in the Thinkpad. Like, what value is a read-only storage device?

PS: I have also had problems with SanDisk USB sticks in the past -
same sort of locked features that the user cannot delete. I disrecommend
SanDisk.

It says it has a resistive touchscreen (like the old palm pilot), which 
would mean it behaves quite differently from the capacitive (e.g. 
iphone / android -- finger touch) screens and might be best used with a 
stylus.  However, I played with a cheap (sub-$200) android 7" tablet 
from k-mart several months ago and found some very strange touch 
behavior even with a stylus -- not just unresponsive, but also 
spurious/offset input.  It was as if the android interface has some 
designed-in assumptions about finger touch (which is a less precise 
input than a stylus.)  Or, possibly a problem with a larger (and cheap) 
resistive touchscreen flexing in a way that creates inaccuracies / 
spurious inputs -- of course, the 12" screen on the thinkpad tablet 
works fine with a fingernail.

This may seem silly to suggest, but have you could attempt to throw up
a quick Windows VM and see if you have RW access to the drive then.
May not be optimal, but at least it'll get you support from SanDisk?

John,

   In the 1980s Jerry Pournell wrote glowingly in his "Byte" columns of the
WORM device he used for backups: Write Once, Read Many. Nowadays they're
called optical disks.

Good luck!

Oh, I already have Windows 2000 and Windows XP installed in Virtualbox.
And I already tried them. They both saw the device as read-only. But
that doesn't prove much, since the virtual machines depend on Virtualbox
to tell them what is on the drives, and Virtualbox just reports what
Linux tells it. Or maybe they see the drive directly, but whatever they
see still can't be more than what the host OS (Linux) sees. In any
event, I tried to copy a file to the card while in Windows, and Windows
said it could not because the drive was read-only. I didn't try
formatting with Windows.

The fdisk -l command sees the hard disk, but not the SD card.

The fdisk man page says:

-l	List the partition tables for the specified devices and then
	exit.  If no devices are  given, those mentioned
	in /proc/partitions (if that exists) are used.

Every utility I have used indicates that the SD card has no partitions.

I find it very strange that my phone has no problem with it; it's just
my Thinkpad that can't write to it.

John,

   Wasn't it you who wrote a few months ago about reading somewhere that
phone sd cards should be formatted only in the phone? And that all writes
should be done in the portable device?

   I know that I formatted the sd cards for my friend's new digital still
camera, and my new video camcorder, in the devices. Both can be read and
written to in the computer ... that's the vfat type assigned to /mnt/zip in
my /etc/fstab/.. When I copy the files from my Panasonic camera I delete
them from the card. Perhaps Android phones need total control. But, not
being able to read them in your laptop is quite strange.

   I'm hoping one (or more) of you professional SysAdmins can point me to the
resolution of this problem.

   I'm trying to subscribe to a mail list run my Mailman, but postfix rejects
the confirmation messages because it cannot resolve the host name from the
IP address; e.g,:

Oct 11 06:53:36 salmo postfix/smtpd[27785]: NOQUEUE: reject: RCPT from
unknown[67.23.35.254]: 450 4.7.1 Client host rejected: cannot find your
hostname, [67.23.35.254]; from=<dabo-users-bounces at leafe.com>
to=<rshepard at appl-ecosys.com> proto=ESMTP helo=<marge.leafe.com>

   I added leafe.com to /etc/postfix/rhsbl_sender_exceptions (as OK), rebuilt
the database using /usr/sbin/postmap, reloaded postfix, and still no joy.

   My assumption is the issue is at the other side's DNS server. Am I
incorrect in this assumption? Is there anything I can do to resolve this
issue from my desk?

TIA,

Rich

Message-ID: <CAGc3sk9PNBXsr3qVx0ZJQg2qnKD2A1y4CCER60P7z=b7tnPQJw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm having a weird command line issue on my centos server. When I SSH
into my server with putty and try to type long commands, cursor will jump to
the beginning of the line and begin to overwrite what I've typed. The
command will still run correctly. When I try to arrow to the left to get to
the beginning of the line, the cursor jumps to the line above where there's
no text. This doesn't happen on other linux servers I have and doesn't
happen when I'm using the console. It also doesn't happen when I SSH from
another linux server, just using putty on Windows. I'm struggling to
determine if the issue is with Putty or with some setting on my server.
Settings in Putty when I compare them to a session that works correctly.

   This might be the cause:

   Why might this happen? The file permissions are 755:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 77888 2011-08-12 11:13 /usr/bin/host*

   Any ideas?

Can you run host under your rshepard username? (That is, without su.)

What does "file /usr/bin/host" say?

How about "ldd /usr/bin/host"? Does the output look similar to, say, 
"ldd /usr/bin/dig"?

Paul,

   Nope.

   However, I fixed it by re-installing the bind package from the
original distribution, then upgrading with the patch. Now dig and host work.

   User error (somehow) in patching bind.

Thanks,

Rich

I've seen some similar problems when using my keypad. Checking "Disable
application keypad mode" in the PuTTY Configuration, under Terminal ->
Features took care of the problem for me.

It sounds like a read only mask is set for the automount.
Here in the Fedora guide

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Administration_Guide_Draft#Using_Automount

it mentions a file /etc/auto.master  and a configurable /misc file
pointing to /etc/auto.misc
/etc/auto.misc contains the default mounting options for various file systems.

Do you have such a file and what does it say?

Bill

   Well, host now works:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ host leafe.com
leafe.com has address 67.23.35.254
leafe.com mail is handled by 10 leafe.com.

but postfix is still not resolving the hostname:

Oct 11 08:21:44 salmo postfix/smtpd[28484]: NOQUEUE: reject: RCPT from
unknown[67.23.35.254]: 450 4.7.1 Client host rejected: cannot find your
hostname, [67.23.35.254]; from=<dabo-users-bounces at leafe.com>
to=<rshepard at appl-ecosys.com> proto=ESMTP helo=<marge.leafe.com>

   /var/log/maillog shows:

   leafe.com is hosted by rackspace.com on their slicehost.net service.

   Is there anything I can do to fix this? Or, do I take this to the postfix
mail list?

I searched / on "auto." and found neither auto.master nor auto.misc. 

It would be interesting to try it in laptops running other distros.
However, I did try live CDs of Lucid and Knoppix with and it was always
read-only. And my GRML rescue CD also saw it as read-only.

By the end of the day I hope to know how it mounts on a Windows laptop.

Have you tried running newaliases? Postfix uses that to install names.

Not exactly. I did write when I had the same problems with the original
mini Transcend 32 GB that I bought, and its replacement, a micro
Transcend with adapter. The fact that I have had two different brands
produce the same results is one reason to suspect Linux. But it might
also be the Thinkpad, including the possibility of a physical problem
in the reader or the adapters. Or it might be that Transcend somehow
locks their SD cards as well as SanDisk. 

I have also discovered that there was a change required when SD cards >
4 GB became available. Apparently they required modifications to the
drivers. But my dim understanding is that if you have the old drivers
the card won't even be seen.

When the card arrived I tried it first in the Thinkpad, where I
discovered that it was read-only. At that time it was vfat from the
factory. When I put it in the phone I was able to format it. When I
moved it back to the laptop it is still read-only with "LBA" and "boot"
flags set, the same as the original factory vfat. All that is different
is that there are now two empty folders: LOST and android-secure. In my
phone there are no options in the format command. All you get is a
button that says "Format." In fact, it was so fast I wonder if it
actually formatted the card. It may have just done an fsck, determined
that there were no errors, and added the two folders.

If I can get it read-write in a Windows computer at PSU today I will
see if I can get the Windows computer to reformat it. At least Windows
should give me some options so I can remove the flags. Maybe I can just
format it NTFS to be sure everything from SanDisk is wiped out. Then
later I can reformat it FAT32 or EXT3.

You might also try puting a few layers of electrical tape (or any tape
that has substantial thickness to it) over the write-protect swith
notch on the adapter.

What kernel module does the card reader on your laptop use?  Some of
them offer the option of ignoring the card reader's write-protect
feature.  E.g.,

Robert,

   No, since it's not listed as an alias for anything. But, I just ran the

There are 3 options:

1 (the right way): report this to Slicehost customer support and they will
fix their DNS.
2 (the Postfix way): tell postfix not to care about DNS record validation. I
don't know how to do this in postfix, but I know it can be done. This
specific question should be posed to the postfix list.
3 (the quick-fix hack way) put an entry in your hosts file or local DNS
server if you have one for 67-23-35-254.static.slicehost.net pointing to
67.23.35.254.

Any of these should take care of the issue for you, in ascending order of
quickness.

   I've modified /etc/hosts because I don't run a DNS server (only a cache).

I'll try this later. I have noticed that the connection is a bit flaky.
And there is a note on the Thinkwiki about bad adapters.

I get the following:

[jjj at Devil8 ~]$ lspci

Using modinfo on the above revealed nothing except possibly the last

I suppose I should google on alternative drivers, perhaps sdricoh_cs.
But I'm going to wait until this evening after I try the card in a

I doubt it.  And if it was an issue with the phone's VFAT
implementation, I expect the laptop wouldn't be able to mount the card
at all.

John, are you using an adaptor to fit the Micro SD card into your
laptop's reader?  If so, have you tried a different adaptor?  It's
possible the write-protect switch on the adaptor is not quite right
for the reader in your laptop.  (Apologies if this has been covered
already.)

No, I have another adapter, but 1) I can't find it at the moment and,
2) it came with the Transcend micro SD card that normally lives in my
phone and, when it first arrived ~ six months ago, I tried it with its
adapter in the laptop and it was also read-only. At that time I didn't
follow up on the issue because I intended to use that micro SD card
only in the phone, and it worked fine there.

However, there is a note on the Thinkwiki that some adapters are flaky.
It is entirely possible that both adapters are bad. But if that were
the case I would expect that the card wouldn't mount at all, or mount
but suddenly disappear, or give corrupted reads and writes or something,
not that they would always uniformly mount read-only. But what do I
know? Oh wait ... I do know that this adapter has some peculiarities.
One of the connectors looks like it has a tiny bit of a curve to it,
two of them stick out 1/32 of an inch more than the others, and the gap
between the rightmost two of them is narrower than the others. Not a
sign of good manufacturing quality control.

I suppose I should google on what each of the pins does. But figuring
out what the effects might be for each pin's failure sounds like a lot
of research.

Actually, that's deliberate.  The two that stick out are the power
connectors.  The idea is to have the card power up before applying
voltages to the signal connectors.  The rightmost two are data
pins; I'm not sure why they're so close.

So today I went to PSU for class and took the SD card with me to see
what happened on Windows computers. First I went to the graduate
computer lab in the basement of Smith. They have some <very nice> Macs
which have an SD card reader built in, whereas for the Windows
computers you need to go to the support desk and check out a USB SD
card reader. I opted for the Mac.

The Mac mounted it automatically, and it was read-write. So (after
fumbling around the Mac GUI) I found a utility to reformat it.
Unfortunately, the only choices were several different Mac filesystem
formats plus "FAT (MSDOS)." It didn't even say what flavor of FAT, nor
did it have any option to make it bootable or other choices. I went
ahead and formatted it FAT, and it finished without incident.

I had to go to class, but later I came back and tried the USB SD card
reader with a Windows computer. This offered me FAT16, FAT32, NTFS and
something else (forgot). I decided to format it NTFS just because I
thought that it might be more likely wipe any evil stuff that SanDisk
had put on the device. It finished the formatting without incident.

I was unable to find any Linux computers on campus that I had access
to. Not being a computer science major I am not allowed to use
computers in the CS department.

I am now home. I put the card into my Fedora 14 Thinkpad and got it
recognized, even though it was NTFS. Using Gparted I attempted to
format it, but I got the same error message as before: The device is
read-only.

There remain three possibilities:

	1) The card reader in the Thinkpad is flaky
	2) The adapter is flaky.
	3) Linux is flaky.

Further testing will require finding a Linux computer that has an SD
card slot (capable of > 4GB), and that is -Thinkpad, -Fedora. In the
meantime, does anyone else have an SD card that is working in a Linux
computer?

I plug SD cards into and out of my systems all the time. 
They're from my camcorder, cameras, and digital recorders. 
They all seem to just work.
I could swear I had a SanDisk, but I can't find it now.

We boot a couple of older eee PCs from SD cards, my dude has a 8gb one that
he uses for the filesystem and updates the Ubuntu install on periodically. I
have an MSI that quite happily reads SanDisk and other brands in Ubuntu but
my sister's Acer has a long history of Not Working. No hardware support for
it at all. My Droid Pro and the HTC Eris I had will mount the phone as a
filesystem quite happily in Ubuntu, I connect it with the usb cable and it
will open up a file browser. The irony being that I can't get the phone to
mount in Windows, I have to remove the card and stick it in an adapter.

I have a Dell Inspiron laptop, with a built-in SD card port.  It's
running Fedora 14, and has no trouble reading and writing SD
cards.

One thing I have had to do is tape over the write lock tabs on the
cards.  Fortunately, these things are the equivalent of the write
protect notch on floppy disks; they don't affect the the memory
card proper.  My experience is that the things don't stay put;
when I insert a card into the Dell's reader, it slips into the
"Locked" position.  By covering the Lock tab over with tape, the
reader hardware is fooled into thinking that the card is
writeable.  Just like floppies.  :-P

Which reader does lspci say you have? And which module does lsmod say
you are using?

Just tried it. I used black plastic electrical tape. The first problem
is that I had to force it slightly to get it into the port. There must
not be a lot of clearance. And after it mounted it was still read-only.
Then I had to use tweezers to pull it back out again.

This is a micro SD card in an adapter. I assume you meant to put the
tape on the adapter, since there is definitely not enough clearance to
put it on the micro SD card itself. Besides, only the adapter has a
slider.

lspci reports: "SD Host controller: Ricoh Co Ltd R5C822
SD/SDIO/MMC/MS/MSPro Host Adapter (rev 17)"

According to lsmod, the Dell is using mmc_core, which is used by
ssb and sdhci.  Sdhci is used by sdhci_pci; sdhci and ssb are
leaves on the tree.  (I'm not sure what ssb is for; I'm including
it for the sake of completeness.)

Yeah, electrical tape is probably a bit much.  I just used a
single layer of cellophane tape.

Exactly.  I have an adapter (SanDisk no less, with a SanDisk micro
SD card in it), and three normal SD cards.  I've had to tape the
adapter and two of the normal cards.  The adapter's lock slider is
so loose that gravity is almost enough to cause it to move.  Not
much of a record, is it?

1. No shared code between users.
2. No optimization of shared code between users (think APC/eAccelerator caches)
3. PHP is running as a CGI, so 200 concurrent requests = 200 apache
processes + 200 PHP processes (twice as many processes).
4. suPHP is *very* picky about what uid is linked to what files are requested.
5. suPHP is *very* tightly jailed, so things like debian/ubuntu's
phpmyadmin packages will not work with default settings.... the vhost
settings really need to be dialed in.
6. Of course, based on 1-5, sharing data between different PHP
processes is magnitudes more difficult, and needs to be done on a
different layer (such as a database).

These, of course, are all "features", not bugs. :)

This is only vaguely related, but I've been looking for a way to wedge
this into the current thread and you mentioned eee's ...

I have an old eeepc 701 (the original) that recently decided it's SD
card reader didn't want to work anymore.  I get an I/O error at a
particular block.  The SD card is actually fine, it works in a USB
adapter and in a different machine's SD card reader.  Something
apparently went haywire either mechanically or electrically with the
reader.  You-dumb-too needs 4.4 gig to install, which makes the 4gig
solid-state drive inadequate and a functional SD reader rather
desirable.

In support of Aaron's excellent reply, I want to add that for large
volumes of data, spreadsheets are not the best tool.  I haven't used
xlrd (or the likely Perl equivalent) but I have exported spreadsheets
as CVS and processed them with 10 line Perl scripts, even vi sometimes.

All spreadsheet programs make really crummy graphs - gnuplot is far
superior.  All spreadsheet programs have difficulty with recursion
and complex formulas.  They have a hard time branching, and handling
regular expressions for text matching, etc.  At some point, you must
invest a little time in learning to do "simple" programming.  I use
Perl mostly because many friends do, but Python is a good option for
most.   You can ignore 90% of either language, as long as you learn
how to read in data, write out data, make simple tables, and do
arithmetic.   Plagarizing other programs is the best way to learn,
which is why you have a disk-full of sources.

You can write simple shell scripts to take data from one small
program and run it into another.  If you are obsessive like me,
you write shell scripts that do the entire task, with copious
comments explaining to your future self what you think the
programs are doing, along with references to web pages, texts,
etc. with more explanation.

This is not as much to aim for 100% automation, as to aim for 0%
stuffing your head with unneeded facts and activities.  A side 
benefit is that if you are stuck in the Nevada desert with a 
cell phone, and your data and computer and wife are in Troutdale,
you can spend a frustrating hour guiding her through preparing
that forgotten report for an impatient customer, rather than
spending two days going home to do it yourself.  It is almost
impossible to guide someone else through a GUI program over the
phone.

Thanks. The site I maintain is fairly simple and also fairly lightly

   Before you all think I'm totally incapable let me try to explain.

   When I had the original spreadsheets I did export as .csv and used awk or
python scripts to reorganize the data.

   In this case I was sent the whole spreadsheet with the latest data added
to one of the tabs. I need to extract only the added data so I can insert
them into the database table. The data still need a lot of adjusting because
spreadsheets don't validate cell entries for proper format or enforce any
standards.

   To isolate the newly added cells, I opened the newest spreadsheet in LO,
then told it to compare it with the original spreadsheet. This highlighted
the additions. Instead of either accepting or rejecting the changes, I saved
the marked new spreasheet (nice red cell boundaries around the new data) and
killed the compare documents dialog box. Worked like a charm.

   Over the past 30 years that I've worked with microcomputers I've rarely
used a spreadsheet. I do for preparing project budgets and other simple
tasks, but never for anything complicated. I have written databases in dBASE
II and III, Paradox/DOS, and since migrating to linux in 1997, postgres and
sqlite.

   I've had this discussion of spreadsheets vs. databases many times. I've
concluded that when folks learn to use 'office' applications on a computer
they learn to use a spreadsheet because that's part of what they have
available. They're not taught database design, SQL, or anything else
relevant to databases. So, since the only tool they know are spreadsheets,
they use them for everything. Even when they trip over the limitations.

   Clients send me data in spreadsheets and, when I need to provide more than
an analytical report, they get a database application back. That's why I'm
now developing an extensive environmental model using python, wxPython,
postgres, GRASS, and R. Both my client and the state regulators will be able
to use it on their Microsoft machines when it's done.

A significant portion of my work is just turning stuff into tabbed
textfiles and processing them with cut, paste, join, grep and sed, with a
couple useful Python scripts, and vim for the corner cases.  I try to
always document what I do.

BTW, all y'all knew that Unix started as a text-processing system, right?

I strongly recommend SAMS' "Python Phrasebook", and the other language
books in that series.  It's just enough to get one up and running, and
perfect for folks who learn well by example and practice.  I still use mine
4 years later, since my brain is stuffed with too much other junk.

Hi there.

I am wondering if anyone has some tips about running Ubuntu by default on a
mac. I have heard that it can be quite tricky, and I wonder if that is true
or not.

Would the best approach be to install Ubuntu as the base OS and then OSX in
a partition? Would that even work with OSX's install process?

My experience with any Linux distribution running on Apple hardware is
to be aware of the model you are attempting to use. Both the newer
Macbook Air's and iMac's use custom GPU's, which the nouveau drivers
will _not_ play nice with.

Other than that, best practice dictates that you follow through with
the Apple supported BootCamp method for setting up your partitions,
and then rather than installing Windows, install Ubuntu instead. This
works, although there is some manual fixing after the install, IIRC
GRUB won't be configured properly because Apple's EFI does wonky
things. Hope this helps!

This story may be apocryphal, and, I can't recall just where I read or 
heard it, but the story goes that Dennis Ritchie was on a committee at 
Bell Labs that was outlining a new computer operating system. Some on 
the committee were more conservative the Ritchie, who started referring 
to the committee as the "eunuchs committee". The name for the operating 
systems was later sanitized, of course, to Unix.

   Right now my company web site is hosted on aracnet.com and built using
xhtml and css. I was in the process of developing a better looking site
using CMS Made Simple when postgres-9.x was released. This broke the CMSMS;
apparently the ADOdb layer and the folks on that mail list showed no
interest in supporting postgres-9.x. So, ...

   Rather than trying to push water uphill I'd like to use my CMSMS scripts
on the supported MySQL. I'll upgrade CMSMS and, I've been told, the scripts
should work with the new version, too. But, I don't know MySQL and don't
want to learn another dbms for a single application. I'd rather find someone
who knows MySQL and hosts web sites to maintain the db back end and keep the
site secured while I futz with the content as needed. Aracnet can do this
with an upgrade of my account. I believe that some of you are in the web
site hosting business, know MySQL, and would like me to take advantage of
your expertise.

   If you're interested, please contact me off the list and I'll give you the
details I can so you can give me the price for your service.

I like the "eunuchs committee" story lots better than the "Unics" story.

The wikipedia entry seems to be a good overview and objective about
the checkered, if not tortured path of Unix development to what we
have now.

For those who enjoy Unix history, there is another narrative written
by Dr Peter Salus that's available free online at Groklaw:

http://www.groklaw.net/staticpages/index.php?page=20051013231901859 .

I'm happy to have missed the Unix wars and all the turmoil they
created while I was ignoring it and working on IBM mainframes instead,
but I do like where it wound up in Linux, even if it uses
little-endian machines.

As my email address reveals, my ISP is Speakeasy. I've been with it
for about eight years and during that time it's been bought by Best
Buy (!) and then recently merged into Megapath, a national MPLS
enabled network.

However, twice in the past month Megapath has f*cked up and turned
into Zeropath during my work day (I work online, in London). I've been
using Skype to chat with London, while at the same time I could not
reach any internet addresses beyond the Speakeasy POP in Seattle,
which prevented me from working. That's happened twice, and I am
getting fed up with it even though Megapath worked the problems and
came back up within hours. That never happened before, so I'm
considering changing to another ISP.

What do people here think of Qwest/Centurylink as an ISP? Is it decent?

I know it's a big telco, one of the Baby Bells, but it was the only
one to resist the Bush administration's demands to suck up all its
internet data and the CEO 'coincidentally' was charged with insider
trading, and went to prison, so it can't be all bad. How good / bad is
it as an ISP?

Feel free to send war stories and opinions to my private email
address, if you don't want to reveal your experience or thoughts here
in public.

Thanks in advance,
Robert

Well, no X, but your suggestion sent me looking.  I see a "<" indicating
another page.  After clicking on that, a page with 8 images of previous
common pages visited.  So the new ad was another page icon added by the
folks at Google.  Now the page with the 8 icons shows rather than the ad.
 This is slightly more convenient.

Thanks for the idea.

There's an extension to deal with it.
By default you cannot change it.

I have been with Qwest and now CenturyLink.  I have had very few down 
times.  Most of them caused by local power outages.  YMMV.  Qwest blocks 
port 25 so Spiritone (aracnet) gave me another port to direct my mail 
clients, which has been working for the last two months.  They started 
blocking the port without notice.  Very inconvenient.  Took a week to 
figure out it was not my fault.  Took about three emails for Patrick at 
Spiritone to figure out Qwest was blocking the port.  All the time I 
could surf the net all I wanted.

Thanks so much.  It works just fine.  I guess Google saw this (lack of user
ability to change the new tab page) as one more way to force a view of an
ad.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1110151121080.9771@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   This morning I moved my virtual terminals from rxvt to urxvt in order to
gain support of UTF-8. According to the demo text file, it works like a
charm (except for not displaying Aramaic, or Armenian, or some such language
about which I do not care at all -- sorry, John!). However, there's still
one issue I've not been able to resolve.

   I set background and foreground text colors in /etc/DIR_COLORS, and rxvt
used them just like xterm did. However, urxvt doesn't seem to know they're
there and I end up seeing directory entries in blue on the terminal window's
blue background, rather than in yellow on blue. A Google search produced the
rxvt wiki where I read to add TERM rxvt into /etc/DIR_COLORS.

   Well, that's already there, so I added 'TERM urxvt' to the file, saved it,
and even logged out and restarted X. Still no joy: the directory and other
file colors do not follow what's set in /etc/DIR_COLORS. I see nothing
relevant in 'man urxvt' or 'man 7 urxvt'.

   A pointer to how to get urxvt to use /etc/DIR_COLORS is needed.

   Hokay. I found out why by contacting tech support at slicehost.net.
Looking at the message from my mail log and how the slice was set up on
their end they concluded that the dabo folks mis-confitured the dns lookup.
However, two dabo developers insisted it was a problem on my machine.

   Doesn't matter now. I realized that dabo gives me nothing that I do not
already have with wxPython.

A cursory reading of urxvt's man pages suggests adding "TERM
rxvt-unicode" to your /etc/DIR_COLORS file.  Also, make sure that
you've got your TERM and COLORTERM environment variables set
properly.  I would guess that they should both be rxvt-unicode,
though urvxt ought to work.  You may want to look at your terminfo
database, to make sure that you have the proper entry for urvxt.
(On my system, I have /usr/share/terminfo/r/rxvt-unicode and
../rxvt-unicode-256color.  There is nothing for urxvt.  Hence
TERM=urxvt won't work here.)

Hope this helps,

Dell,

   Sonofagun! Adding rxvt-unicode made the difference. And I thought that was
the same as urxvt. It's not.

Thanks,

No prob.

You might want to check what urxvt is setting its TERM environment
variable to be.  It should be "rxvt-unicode", since that's what
your system terminfo/termcap has installed.  However, it might be
"urxvt" or even "xterm".  If that's the case, you'll want to
change it.  I think I saw a configuration setting for that.  If
there isn't one, you can do it easily enough from your
.{bash,ksh,csh,zsh,$whatever_sh}rc startup file.  ;-)  Granted, it
should work well enough set to "xterm", but you might as well be
able to use all of urxvts capabilities.

Wait, is your ISP CenturyLink or SpiritOne?  

CenturyLink owns all the copper in the street.  Where your bits leave
CenturyLink varies, depending on who your ISP is.

Russell,

I've used Aracnet since '99.  USWest required an outside ISP for DSL 
connections at the time I connected.  Then QWest came along acquiring 
USWest.   I did not use the web hosting they provided, but had to pay 
for it anyway.  Now CenturyLink is offering DSL.  I stayed with 
Aracnet.  Sometime between then and now Spiritone acquired Aracnet.  The 
internet evolves.

Last year I tried Clearwire.  That did not work our when the leaves came 
out on the trees, I lost signal.  I went back to Qwest and got a better 
modem and connection.  But I stayed with Aracnet (Spiritone).  Nice to 
keep the same email address for all this time.  Spiritone has an 
excellent SPAM filter.

Subject: [PLUG] Accessing Files through CD based OS (Ubuntu 10.040
Message-ID: <4E9B5758.30709@comcast.net>

My desktop machine croaked overnight. Fortunately I had already copied
most of my laptop which is now running Ubuntu 10.04. This afternoon I'm
using the Ubuntu install CD in try-out mode to look for and copy things
more stuff. It's been working fine for most files but I've run into some
that won't copy due to permissions problems. In the Gnome file browser
the icons for individual files in some of my directories have an X in
the upper right hand corner. If I right click on them and look at the
Permissions tab of the file's Properties I get the message: "You are not
the owner, so you cannot change these permissions."

How do I become the owner using the CD based OS? Or is there some other
way I can copy these files?

Thanks.

An easy way is to just launch the file browser using sudo which will give it
root permissions.  I use Kubuntu so I am not sure what the browser is in
Ubuntu but for me I would use 'sudo dolphin'  (dolphin being the KDE file
browser).  If you don't care about the permissions of the files, you could
change the permissions of all the files using 'sudo chmod -R 0777 *' which
would make all the files from the current folder down, world
readable/writable.  This is not good for security, but will get the job
done.

In Ubuntu it's Nautilus, but there's something disabled -- the error
message said something about having my administrator enable something
related to "net".

This worked. Thanks. With this I am able to copy the files to my laptop.
I can restore the permissions to normal once they get over there.

Sorry about that, folks!  John and I usually remind each other
about the clinic, but I have been working 18x7 helping my wife
launch her new medical clinic.  I worked late Saturday night and
early Sunday morning lifting furniture, running CAT6, deciphering
Cisco documentation,  and figuring out why the #*&@%! ASUS eeePC
Box (running Linux) wasn't talking to the LCD monitor it talked
to a month ago.

Six months from now, there will be a Whole Lotta Linux at a new
medical micropractice on Northwest Lovejoy.  For now, we rush
to be ready for the first dozen impatient patients on tuesday.

So there was Linux at a Clinic, but not at Free Geek and at the
wrong 1 o'clock.  I hope to be at the traditional clinic in November.

If your ISP is Aracnet then Qwest/CenturyLink shouldn't (can't) be
filtering anything.  If they are, that would be big news.  If you ISP
is Aracnet, then the phone company should be shuffling your bits
directly to them untouched.  They are strictly providing transit in
that scenario and the content of the bits are strictly none of their
business.  I would strongly suspect that the port 25 filtering was
occuring somewhere else, either at your end or Aracnet's or maybe it
was a figment of your imagination entirely, due perhaps to confusing
stimuli (as sometimes happens).

FWIW, I also have Aracnet over CenturyLink copper and the fact that I
am still getting mail implies that my port 25 is not being filtered.

Subject: [PLUG] Program fails to start
Message-ID: <4E9C68C7.8090404@comcast.net>

As mentioned yesterday my desktop croaked. Fortunately I had copied a
number of things from it to my recently upgraded laptop which is now
running Ubuntu 10.04, too. One of the programs I installed on both
machines was a deb package called transcribe. It is an audio playback
program that is used by transcribers to start and stop a recording to
make it easier to keep up with the person speaking while typing what
that person said. It also keeps track of the position of the audio
cursor by time so one can jump to a specific spot in the recording if
one knows when to jump to.

I had this program running on my laptop three weeks ago. I tried to use
it this morning but nothing happens on the screen when I click on its
icon. I tried running it from a terminal window. Here's what I got:

rsteff at acer-laptop:~$ transcribe
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/transcribe", line 479, in <module>
    window = TranscribeWindow()
  File "/usr/bin/transcribe", line 87, in __new__
    new_object.finish_initializing(builder)
  File "/usr/bin/transcribe", line 177, in finish_initializing
    self.player = TranscribePlayer()
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.6/transcribe/player.py", line 54, in
__init__
    'scaletempo')
gst.ElementNotFoundError: scaletempo
rsteff at acer-laptop:~$

I tried Googling gst.ElementNotFoundError: scaletempo but got only one
hit that didn't make much sense to me. Are the other lines, the ones
above gst.E.ementNotFoundError, telling me that something is wrong? Or
are they just showing me something is happening?

I also tried reinstalling the deb package but I get the same results.
Any thoughts on where to look next?

Thanks.

   It's a python application, Dick. There's a problem with the __init__ in
player.py. I suggest re-installing that application as something got torked
since the last time you used it.

   FWIW, I have a similar issue with matplotlib, a plotting library for
python. Just upgraded the version and when I now try running my model I get
an error with a font metric. In my case, I'm waiting for mail list
subscription confirmation so I can ask for help there. You might want to
check with the folks who produce transcribe about the error.

This is a fairly old version of Ubuntu - it's /possible/ you're
running into a problem due to an incompatible version of Python: maybe
you're running a newer version of transcribe that expects a newer
python than what you have installed?

I don't know how backports / LTS works for Ubuntu -- you may be just
fine in that respect, but that came to mind.

But it is the version purported to have Long Term Support so us (more or
less) "ordinary" users can count on things working for a few years.

If it is somehow related to versions my guess is that it is an older
version of transcribe that got bit by some upgrade in python. Alas, I
have so far been unable to locate the source of the program on the
Internet today. My Googling has turned up all kinds of things that
aren't this program called transcribe. There's a music transcription
program called transcribe that dominates my search returns, now. I think
I used to have the python source code from back when I first tried to
use it and before I found the deb package. I'll have to try some other
search strings.

> I don't know how backports / LTS works for Ubuntu -- you may be just

Don't know what backports are all about.

Thanks for the ideas. They got me thinking about other search strings.

I think 'gst' is gstreamer and it sounds like ElementNotFoundError is an 
attempt to access a hash key or attribute which doesn't exist.  That 
sounds like you've got some API version incompatibility between 
gstreamer and transcribe.  Possibly check whether your various 
gstreamer packages (including the python library) got upgraded.

Would you be looking for

Probably something like that. That's why I'm trying to locate the source
with Google, so I can see if there is a more recent version.

Thanks for the tip.

and i suppose it's also not 'transcriber' which is available in the
standard ubuntu 10.4 repos?  i suppose this because that one appears
to be entirely written in tcl :/

I am impressed with what Intel is doing with Yocto. The talk at OSCON 
with Beth, Jefro and Dave was great and totally under-attended.

Highlights: Reliance on QEMU as a multi-platform emulator for the 
various platforms, no?

License-level management of a project to keep things clean.

Very complete! (no? :) )

I'll watch for other 1+'s on the various topics.

Scott, are all topics on offer if adequately spaced?

Russell,

I may be confused as you say.  I checked all my routers and none have 
any port 25 blocking enabled.  My network
has the DSL modem -> wireless router -> house router.  The house router 
is a firewall and NAT for my desktops.
The wireless router is strickly for wireless connections and does NAT 
for the house modem.  The DSL modem does NAT for the wireless router.  
So somewhere there could be a closed port 25, but I sure did not see it 
here.

The another explanation is Spiritone was blocking my port 25, but that 
is unlikely.

I hate to be the one to have to tell you this, but according to your
traceroutes, your ISP is qwest.net, not Aracnet. This means your port 25
being blocked makes perfect sense.

Potentially. I can only commit to things one at a time, though. It all 
depends on how busy I am.

The good news is they're each related to my job, so in theory it's just 
a matter of formalizing the knowledge and putting a presentation 
together...in theory. :)

Subject: [PLUG] Bluetooth mouse dies after kernel upgrade
Message-ID: <20111017220847.67d004de@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Except for a period about a year ago (resolved) it always worked
perfectly, but after upgrading my Fedora 14 x86_64 computer to
2.6.35.14-97.fc14.x86_64 a week ago it dies periodically. To get it
started again I have to (using the GUI) right-click on the mouse
(Logitech Travel Mouse), select Input Service, and let it find the
mouse again. Before doing so I have to put the mouse into locatable
mode by pressing the button on the bottom.

Something is turning off the mouse after an apparently random period of
inactivity. It does not die as long as I am using it. I say the period
of inactivity is random; it may be a fixed time, but it is difficult to
test to determine if that is the case. All I know for sure is that my
screensaver is set to 30 minutes of inactivity and the mouse is always
dead after restoring from the screensaver (have to use the Esc key to
restore). I suspect the mouse dies long before the screensaver kicks in.

The only other clue I have found is the following from Xorg.0.log,
which appeared right after the last time I had to restart the Input
Service:

I copied and pasted to the end of the file, but I suspect the first
three "[101..." lines are the only ones that are important.
Unfortunately, I don't understand what they mean. For that matter, I
don't know what the line-initial numbers mean either, some kind of time
stamp code?

Google didn't turn up anything except my own unanswered posts to the
Fedora forums. I could use some clues.

In the words of the great philosopher Homer, D'oh!

That's one I haven't seen before. It installs and runs just fine. All I
need to make it useful is to find a way to use my foot pedal with it. I
have a program, footpedal, which worked with the program transcribe.
It's also a python program that translates the actions of a three switch
foot pedal into the equivalent of key strokes. It still works -- that is
it runs and its simple configuration still works. I have the source for
that one. I may end up learning some python. Also, transcriber has a
section for changing some key bindings (I think that's the right
phrase), so it may not be too hard.

I wonder why that never showed up while I was Googling. I never thought
to look in Synaptic. Thanks for pointing it out.

... and no. I'm pretty sure musical transcription is the process of
using a piano style keyboard and having what you "play" recorded as
notes on a page, or something similar. That's the most common hit I got
from Google.

Thanks for looking, though.

well, it's not the solution you were looking for, but as the perl
folks put it, there's more than one way to do it =)

man, i hate firing up synaptic to search.  i found it in 3 seconds
with 'apt-cache search transcribe'.

another nifty tool which would have worked even better (had the
utility you started out looking for been part of any of my repos) is
apt-file (which searches in the list of filenames that could get
installed with packages (vs dpkg -S which can search only in actually
installed filenames)).  it's handy because, for instance, you can
figure out that some random program you saw once belongs to some
completely other package (apt-file search pnmarith => netpbm).

it's one of the first packages i install after any ubuntu or debian
installation (see also: openssh-server, screen, vim).

I think all the X log file is telling you is that it's seen that
the mouse was connected, and X has recognized it.  A better
source of information would be dmesg or the system log.  Those
would be /var/log/dmesg and /var/log/messages, respectively.
You'll be wanting to look at the end of those files.
(/var/log/messages belongs to root, so you'll need to su to root,
or do a "sudo tail ..." to read it.  These are the files that
should give you a clue as to what's going on.

You say this started after last week's upgrade, have you tried
booting to a prior kernel?  If you've left your system stock, the
previous two kernels are still installed, all you have to do is
select one from the grub boot menu.

Another possibility is that your Bluetooth configuration has been
changed.  If you boot with a prior kernel and the problem
persists, that's probably where I'd start looking.  Or perhaps the
udev rules that govern these things.  Unfortunately, I don't have
anything Bluetooth, so I can't do any testing.  (And udev rules
are a black art.)  Did any of the Bluetooth programs get updated?
You can compare the current config files with your backups (you
_do_ make backups, don't you?), and restore the old one if
necessary.  It shouldn't be necessary; when a config file has to
be changed, it's given an ".rpmnew" extension, so you can make
sure any changes you've made are merged in.  You might scan
through /etc/* to see if there are any "tagged" files.

Hurrr...  I just checked with RedHat's Bugzilla for Bluez bugs,
and there's one that matches your problem exactly, except that the
author is running F15, with blues-4.87.  Since you're running F14,
I'm not sure that this isn't just a coincidence; still, it seems
odd.  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=716479>

I hope this helps.  (I'm going to sleep.  *yawn!*)

Ah, atlas's ISP is qwest.net.  Slate is the shell host at aracnet.com,
iirc.  So, it seems you have an account at Aracnet, but they aren't
providing your DSL.

You can try: 

  $ tcptraceroute <destination-host> 25 

to see which hop drops your port 25 traffic.

Very cool real-world example of an app I've never heard about solving
a problem I didn't know could be this easy to figure out.
http://michael.toren.net/code/tcptraceroute/

Unfortunately, tcptraceroute appears to have been abandoned by the
author; it was last updated in 2002 and associated mailing lists have
since been deleted.  The major distros have the package available in
some form, usually part of a community-supported repo, but there
longer appears to be any active development (IPv6 support, etc).
NDisc6 (http://www.remlab.net/ndisc6/) appears to provide an IPv6
equivalent.  Anyone know of any other packages/tools out there that
also provide something similar?  /me wonders why iputils' traceroute
still doesn't have TCP support after all these years.

apt-file++

It's also great for tracking down the -dev package you need to get a
./configure script to work.

$ apt-file search <the .h file configure can't find>

You usually need to narrow the results a bit (there are only so many
names for header files, and you need the right one) but it's a great
start.

I have no hard data to support my intuition, but my suspicion is that 
Fedora's new kernel is being a bit too agressive about power 
management.

I think you're looking for:
http://code.google.com/p/pytranscribe/

It requires that you have another application installed called
scaletempo.  It looks like it's failing because you don't have that
dependency:
http://scaletempo.sourceforge.net/

It's likely that the package that provides pytranscribe is missing the
dependency for scaletempo.

Subject: [PLUG] changing IP addresses
Message-ID: <CADJK7_T5L4e6ue3Y+jwo6iVTM2oe5f1ZMO-=mV43Zc97E9Gtzg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all - I need someone to check my work on something. I have a remote
server out there and the ISP needs to change IP addresses. I have a couple
of addresses on this box. What I'm thinking: I should be able to just add
the new addresses to /etc/network/interfaces (this is Ubuntu 10.10), right
after the old addresses and if I restart the networking services, I'll still
be able to access it by its old IP addresses. Then when they make the switch
at the network level, the box will be accessible by its new addresses (we'll
ignore DNS changes for this question). My only concern is whether or not I
can add multiple gateways for multiple IP addresses to the same interface; I
don't see why not, but this is one of those things I'd love to get
confirmation on before I cut myself off from a remote server :)

Here's what my updated /etc/network/interfaces file would look like:
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
    address aaa.aaa.152.150
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway aaa.aaa.152.1
auto eth0:0
iface eth0:0 inet static
    address aaa.aaa.152.106
    netmask 255.255.255.0
auto eth0:1
iface eth0:1 inet static
    address aaa.aaa.152.149
    netmask 255.255.255.0

# adding these new addresses
auto eth0:2
iface eth0:2 inet static
    address bbb.bbb.42.111
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway bbb.bbb.42.1
auto eth0:3
iface eth0:3 inet static
    address bbb.bbb.42.112
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway bbb.bbb.42.1


Does anyone see any problems with this? Does anyone know how to test syntax
or configuration on this file before I restart my services?

Thanks!

- Jason L.

It was dead again this morning. After restarting it and doing a few
other morning tasks I looked at dmesg and var/log/messages.

From dmesg:

First, these messages are repeated over and over:
[22976.956175] sr 3:0:0:0: [sr0] Add. Sense: Logical block address out
	of range [22976.956186] sr 3:0:0:0: [sr0] CDB: Read(10): 28 00

	00 00 00 02 00 
[22976.959152] end_request: I/O error, dev sr0, sector 0

I don't think they are related, but I have no idea what Sense is. My
hard disk passes Palimpsest Smart check and fsck. There is a USB
hard disk attached, and there is also the optical drive. The USB disk
has a couple torrent files on it that I have been seeding.

The following appeared at the very end of dmesg:
[25197.967557] input: Bluetooth Travel Mouse

<snipped more identical entries ending at "input 17."

It sure would be easier to understand dmesg if it gave a date and time
when the event happened. 

From /var/log/messages:

It wouldn't surprise me if Fedora 14 and 15 are using the same kernel
(assuming both are updated, as mine is). Fedora supports only the
current and immediately previous versions; prior versions are cut off
and there are no more updates for anything.

Thanks for the link. I read the report and it does sound identical. I
don't have an account and didn't want to create one just to add a "me
too." However, if only two of us have the problem, that is weird.

I hope something in the above log entries flashes someone's synapses
into more suggestions. I'll keep poking, and this evening I'll have
time to try booting to a previous kernel.

Subject: [PLUG] nscd
Message-ID: <CACKgb8RHZt-5H5e1esz9=jMC6SCEEJJiyFbSxa_msFmv+2Opng@mail.gmail.com>

as i tediously await the end of a wget process that is taking 5
seconds to resolve the same hostname over and over again to finish
mirroring this slow, distant site, i consider putting the hostname
into /etc/hosts.

and then i wonder whatever happened to nscd?  why is it no longer
standard (on ubuntu at least) to have a name service caching daemon?
i tried to install it for myself and found that whatever repo it's in
(bonus question, how can i tell what repo an available package is in,
from the command line?) is one which is clearly not official since the
packages for both nscd and unscd show up as "untrusted" and this
stayed my hand.

caching is generally awesome, and while i can find no evidence that
nscd was standard in ubuntu even as far back as release 6.06 (man, i
really need to make it back to texas to upgrade that machine!
shudder.), i swear it *used* to be standard in all the linuces i
used--since it was usually there but i never explicitly installed it.
but it's not standard in centos6 either (though at least they do
provide a signed package!)

did this functionality become deprecated, or otherwise obviated at
some point?  in my googling i see a little about nsc functionality in
glibc, but i can't really tell what's up with that.  there is an nscd
that is part of some eglibc and libc6-debug packages according to
apt-file, but those are clearly not intended for everyday use.

anyone know what gives?

Is there a way to mark the mouse as "trusted" or set the computer to
be "temporarily visible" in the bluetooth configuration interface?
Although a couple years old, this bug report might be helpful to you
(it's still linked to from the main bluetooth documentation for
Fedora):

Message-ID: <20111018172856.GA32664@gate.kl-ic.com>

My wife's new clinic connects to CenturyLink DSL with an Actiontec
GT701D modem.  I found a Qwest-branded Actiontec M1000 DSL modem
at Goodwill for $5 (and the wall wart at the thrift shop five
blocks away!), and swapped it in as an alternative.  It worked
also, so now the office has a backup modem on the shelf, with
instructions for use in case the GT701D fails.  

I'm told that, besides the PPPoE username and password, some ISPs
have MAC address authentication, requiring connection to one
particular piece of customer hardware.  That is the case for
our CenturyLink business account, which is good news.

Next, connecting the Alix firewall box (running linux and the
pppoe kernel module) through one of those modems in Transparent
Bridging mode.  Although both Actiontec modems run MonteVista
embedded Linux under the hood, I prefer distros I can maintain,
back up, terminate VPNs, do DNS, etc.

Keith

P.S. I was in Goodwill looking for old style POTS analog phones,
the wired kind that don't need wall warts.  We will be automating
the phones with Asterisk, but I want emergency phones that work 
when the power is out, at least until we can bring in a portable
generator.  I didn't find any plain old phones at three different
Goodwills, lots of cheap cordless handsets missing the wall warts.

The first question I'd ask is, why is your local DNS resolver not 
caching the results. Most sites provide DNS TTLs of over an hour; the 
exceptions are fast-changing distributed sites like Google which 
provide TTLs of just a few minutes.

For most sites, however, your local nameserver should return the 
address for a frequently asked hostname in just 10s of milliseconds.

Who provides your DNS service?

I know that Fedora and Red Hat are migrating away from nscd to sssd, 
which (afaict) is intended strictly for authentication caching and 
doesn't support DNS caching.

Even on machines I manage that rely on nscd, I don't use it to cache 
DNS results. I'd rather setup a caching nameserver. Use aptitude to 
search for dnsmasq, a lightweight DSN forwarder.

google :( [8.8.8.8]

to be honest, i just realized what is going on.  i have a huge
download streaming in the background which is saturating my pipe, so
that *all* lookups that go over the wire are actually taking that
long.  i just wasn't noticing as much since my connection to gmail and
twitter is basically streaming or anyway less frequently connecting
and dropping.

i came to understand that to be the main point of nscd too but used it
for dns caching since it was already running.

All,

We're working an issue with extreme latency on one of our application
servers. The lead tech, who hasn't established much credibility, keeps
saying he wants to bounce the Sun Solaris servers, as they have been up for
169 days. He feels that may be the cause of the issue. I highly doubt it as
the System Administrators are saying that resources are available for the
application. What's the recommended reboot cycle for Sun Solaris servers?

thanks,

i don't know, but i have regularly used solaris servers under a fair
amount of constant load (not x86-based) that had uptime in the 2+
years range with no problems.  clearly this was a couple releases ago,
since i haven't worked with solaris in the last couple years.

still, nobody ever considered rebooting them to fix a problem.  that
is heresy =)

You're right, this isn't related to your bluetooth trouble.
/dev/sr0 is your CD/DVD drive.  "Sense Key" is SCSI-spec jargon.
The host controller asks the SCSI peripheral for a status check,
and it returns a block of "sense data".  The sense key is an error
code contained within that sense data.

(log messages snipped)

Hmm, looks to me like these messages are about establishing a
connection with the mouse.  I had hoped to see some message
pertaining to DISconnecting it.  That would give us a lead on why
it's being disconnected.  You could try this:  Check
/var/log/dmesg and /var/log/messages and see what's at the end of
each.  Then let your system sit idle until the mouse disconnects.
Then, _without reconnecting the mouse,_ see what has changed in
those files.  After that, reconnect the mouse and again see what
changed.  A bit time-consuming, I know, but it would give you more
information to work with.  Right now, I'm afraid that's all I can
come up with.

(I have the sneaking suspicion that Paul Heinlein's suggestion is
right:  There's a kernel setting that's causing this.  Not
necessarily a bug, _per se,_ but something mis-configured.  There
may be a setting in /proc that could be changed, but I have no
idea what it might be.)

I've (almost) accepted the fact that I need to downsize, and I'm faced
with getting rid of >30 years of computing literature. I'm hoping
someone might have some ideas or suggestions.

When I was in college (way too many years ago) I used to enjoy browsing
the CompSci library and reading the journal articles. After I graduated
I really missed that, so I started building my own library. I joined
the ACM (and eventually IEEE) and subscribed to everything that interested
me. I eventually decided it was too expensive, and stopped everything
except the IEEE membership. By now I've accumulated a couple of rather
large bookcases of journals, proceedings, etc.

I'm going to have to put them in the recycle bin if I can't find a home 
for them.

The stuff from the ACM goes back to 1978, and continued up until 1992
(not everything covers the entire period). It includes Communications of 
the ACM as well as conference proceedings and regular publications from
SIGPlan		Programming Languages
SIGArch		Computer Architecture
SIGArt		Artificial Intelligence
SIGSmall	Small Computers
SIGMicro	Microprocessors and Systems
SIGGraphics	Computer Graphics
Journal of the ACM
Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems
Transactions on Database Systems

There's also a hefty collection of IEEE Spectrum and IEEE Computing
magazines, the last few years of Creative Computing (David Ahl)
before it went bust, and there may be a bunch of Byte Magazine issues
from the 80's.

It pains me to just throw this all away.

Unless he can give *concrete* and *specific* reasons, it sounds like he is
establising quite a bit of dis-credibility there.  He may be working from
Windows experience.  If so, he is best forgiven and then gently ignored.

I say that not as a matter of principle, but because the longer an
uninformed loudmouth is allowed to delay your data-gathering and diagnostic
process, the later things will be fixed.

This is a job for people who know how to use DTrace and SAR.

Latency/load/response issues are FUN.  Diagnosis often becomes political
and opinion-driven rather than data-driven.  Typically, folks will offer
uninformed suggestions as to what to do, and the loudest voice and laziest
approach will dominate, just by sheer force of annoyance.

Throw around the phrase "Data-driven".

When you need a new OS kernel or to add RAM.  Maybe 1-6 years.

Have you checked libraries? They may not be able to take them, even if
they want them, for lack of storage space. But it's worth a couple of
phone calls. In fact, you could visit most of the library catalogs
online to see if they already have the journal. If they don't, that
would be a library to call.

The problem is, this stuff is mostly readily available online.  There
doesn't tend to be a lot of artwork with these things that makes the
hardcopy desirable.  They are heavy and take up space and aren't
readily searchable.

I've worked with Sun boxes for years and never heard of a "recommended" reboot cycle.  Do you know what version of Solaris?

i don't know, but i have regularly used solaris servers under a fair
amount of constant load (not x86-based) that had uptime in the 2+
years range with no problems.  clearly this was a couple releases ago,
since i haven't worked with solaris in the last couple years.

still, nobody ever considered rebooting them to fix a problem.  that
is heresy =)

I haven't administered any mission-critical Solaris boxes for several 
years, but I never had to reboot Solaris to solve an application-level 
problem. I suspect truss or dtrace can identify the source of the 
latency, if it actually is caused by Solaris.

Subject: [PLUG] Temp directory weirdness
Message-ID: <A3F6DDE1-BAE9-48BA-98D3-5A71EE0333A2@dimstar.net>

I have a perl script that I wrote that is supposed to query a service, then write the results to a file in the temp directory. It exits, then another script comes along and parses that file at intervals. For weird reasons, I need to do it this way rather than have the parsing script query the service itself. 

I have the following routine in my perl script:

sub writetemp {
    open (NEWFILE, ">/tmp/$0.count") or die $!;
    print NEWFILE "$product{name}.value $product{value} $date";
    close (NEWFILE);
}

This works like a champ when I run the script from the command line.

But when I run the script from roots cron, no output file is produced. I've also tried producing the file in a subdirectory within the /root home directory, with the same results. 

Anyone have any ideas?

I don't think the latency is coming from the OS, but who knows. At this
point the Scheduler (CA Inc) is seeing it in the OCI calls, but that just
means it's downstream from them. Oracle is saying they can't find anything
in the logs, and so I've got a whole lot of shrugging shoulders. The Storage
guys say the OS can tell is they are having resource issues, and the OS guys
are saying they don't see any resources spikes. The only thing I do know is
that no one has a clue. To solve the problem we 'roll around the horn' so to
speak on the RAC environment. Latency disappears after that. it smells like
an Oracle issue, but at this point I'm stuck.

Running it at the command line as who and from who's crontab?

Where does the global variable $0 come from?  How is it set?

Not sure this is going to help much, but just in case
    IRIX 6.4 (SGI MIPS)
    Oracle 8.0.4
What appear as a latency issue was that Oracle didn't like the way SVR4 
systems counted time, and processes (it was a know bug but Oracle's fix 
was to move to 9.x which wasn't supported on those offending OS's).  The 
known bug, you see, was found on other SVR4 systems as well, and 
Oracle's known work around was to periodically power cycle the 
machine(s), resetting the counters in question.  In our case it was <28 
days (we made it 21 so it could always happen on Sundays), on some SVR4 
boxes it was <280 days ... that was dependent on how the OS counted time.
Hope that helps

Fred James

It doesn't die?

Are you sure it runs?  ie, does the root crontab have the proper path elements for this to function?

Check the return code from print.  As in:

sub writetemp {
     open (NEWFILE, ">/tmp/$0.count") or die $!;
     my $ok = print NEWFILE "$product{name}.value $product{value} $date";
     if ( ! $ok ) {
        print STDERR "error on print to file:  $!\n";
     }
     close (NEWFILE);
}

or print NEWFILE "$product{name}.value $product{value} $date" or warn "$!";


You may also set $| (autoflush) to true in case there's some weirdness in output buffering.
Shouldn't be but ...

As a test, I set it up under the ubuntu user. When run from the command line, the script runs and properly creates the expected output file in the /tmp directory.

When I set up the crontab to run the script as ubuntu, I get an email saying:

"No such file or directory at /home/ubuntu/bin/test line 99."

which is the 'open' in the script.

Make sure you're using the correct shell. Ubuntu sets /bin/sh to 'dash'
by default, which is a limited shell that doesn't have all of the 
capabilities of normal 'bash'. Supposedly makes running scripts 
quicker.

before you do that, you should ask jason scott of textfiles.com if
it's already done (since he spends a lot of effort doing that kind of
thing to those kinds of publications and has for some time).

i guess maybe since it isn't in danger of being lost (the OP said it
was (mostly?) available online?), it might not worth redigitizing?

Which implies:

sub writetemp {
    print STDERR "sanity check of \$0 $0 value\n";
    open (NEWFILE, ">/tmp/$0.count") or die $!;
    my $ok = print NEWFILE "$product{name}.value $product{value} $date";
    if ( ! $ok ) {
       print STDERR "error on print to file:  $!\n";
    }
    close (NEWFILE);
}

Going to AT tonight? Have remote access to the box in question?

This is Perl, not shell.

Doh! 

I knew that. Then I promptly forgot. :-P

my brain interpreted that as complaining it couldn't find a file named 'open',
which implied some internal feature was missing/not working. Which was
consistent with my experiences with bash/dash.

 : 
 : As a test, I set it up under the ubuntu user. When run from the 
 : command line, the script runs and properly creates the expected 
 : output file in the /tmp directory.
 :
 : When I set up the crontab to run the script as ubuntu, I get an 
 : email saying:
 : 
 : "No such file or directory at /home/ubuntu/bin/test line 99."

Try running your program on the command line with a fully qualified 
path name:

  perl /home/ubuntu/bin/test

You will probably see the same error.

 : which is the 'open' in the script.

You are asking perl to open a file called:

  /tmp/home/ubuntu/bin/test.count

When, in fact, I guess that you would like to create the file:

  /tmp/test.count

A few notes and recommendations:

 0. I would suggest renaming the script from 'test' to
    'test-count-something'; there is a shell builtin called 'test' 
    and often a binary /usr/bin/test, as well.

 1. To solve the fully qualified path issue from above, use 'basename'
    from the perl module File::Basename:

    use File::Basename;
    sub writetemp {
        my $fname = "/tmp/". basename($0) . ".count";
        open (NEWFILE, ">$fname") or die $!;
        print NEWFILE "$product{name}.value $product{value} $date";
        close (NEWFILE);
    }

 2. If you are going to write a file with one program and read the 
    file with another program, get in the habit of creating the file
    atomically.  Imagine what happens when your data file creation 
    program is still writing a the data file when along comes the 
    data consuming program and starts to read it!  Hilarity.

    How do you do prevent this problem?  Take advantage of 
    filesystem atomicity.  In perl, you can use the perl function 
    rename:

    use File::Basename;
    sub writetemp {
        my $fname = "/tmp/". basename($0) . ".count";
        open (NEWFILE, ">${fname}.tmp") or die $!;
        print NEWFILE "$product{name}.value $product{value} $date";
        close (NEWFILE);
        rename($fname . ".tmp", $fname) or die $!;
    }

 3. Consider making your 'or die' statements just ever so slightly 
    more informative:

    use File::Basename;
    sub writetemp {
        my $fname = "/tmp/". basename($0) . ".count";
        open (NEWFILE, ">${fname}.tmp") 
           or die "Could not open(NEWFILE, ${fname}.tmp): $!";
        print NEWFILE "$product{name}.value $product{value} $date";
        close (NEWFILE)
           or die "Could not close(NEWFILE) [${fname}.tmp]: $!";
        rename($fname . ".tmp", $fname) 
           or die "Could not rename(${fname}.tmp, $fname): $!";
    }

You might be tricked into thinking that handling files safely is 
really easy, given that it is such a basic thing that we do on 
computer systems, however, there are well-beaten paths into the pits 
of despair in file-handling.  By the way, Russell--nice work with 
calling close().  Sure, some languages will close the filehandle for 
you when it goes out of scope, but not perl, so it is good that you 
call close() explicitly.

I could probably fiddle indefinitely with this nicely functionized 
'writetemp' you have created, but I'll leave you with one more 
possible variant.  I would use a scoped variable for the filehandle 
(mostly so that perl will clean up the filehandle if I forget to 
call close() on that filehandle).

    use File::Basename;
    sub writetemp {
        my $fname = "/tmp/". basename($0) . ".count";
        my $tmpf = $fname . ".tmp";
        my $fh;
        open ($fh, ">$tmpf") 
           or die "Could not open(\$fh, $tmpf): $!";

        # -- put the data into the file ...
        #
        print $fh "$product{name}.value $product{value} $date";

        # -- Good behaviour!  Call close() on your filehandles!
        #
        close ($fh)
           or die "Could not close(\$fh) [$tmpf]: $!";

        # -- filesystem atomicity is a nice guarantee; use it
        #
        rename($tmpf, $fname) 
           or die "Could not rename($tmpf, $fname): $!";
    }

Wow, you are still reading.  OK, have a look at the perl module 
called File::Temp, and also the Linux command strace.  If you had 
run strace on your initial program you would have seen exactly what 
the error was.  The good run:

  $ strace -e file perl t0.pl
    ...
  open("/tmp/t0.pl.count", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3

OK, so here you got your file.

  $ strace -e file perl /home/mabrown/tmp/t0.pl
    ...
  open("/tmp//home/mabrown/tmp/t0.pl.count", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) 

Sometimes you have to dig around in the strace output a bit, but you 
can get a very good idea of exactly what is going wrong.

Anyway, good luck!

-Martin

Of course, you are correct. I didn't see it, but it made perfect sense when you hit me with the clue sledge.

That's not the real name of the script. But noted.

Done, and it works as expected.

Excellent suggestion. I will implement this and the other suggestions. I'm a novice when it comes to perl. I can usually cobble something together, but I learn by example all the time.

And there's always more to learn!

If you're running a program as root and writing a predictably-named file 
in a globally writable directory, be aware that knowledge of this 
predictable name could be exploited to cause root to overwrite any file 
via a symlink.  Using a tempfile with a randomized name prevents this.

If you run out of space in /tmp/, close() will return false.

  use File::Fu;
  sub writetemp {
    my $fname = File::Fu->tmp +
      (File::Fu->program_name->basename . '.count');
    my $fh = File::Fu->temp_file;
    print $fh "$product{name}.value $product{value} $date";
    close($fh) or die "error closing temp file $!";
    $fh->name->rename($fname);
  }

You can do that with File::Temp and File::Basename instead (which is all 
that happens under the hood) but I use File::Fu so much I forget how to 
do it longhand.  Also, File::Fu checks the return values and throws an 
error for me -- but you could 'use autodie' and even close() would be 
checked automatically.

For bedtime reading, try `perldoc -f open`.

This will fail if $0 is "/the/full/path/to/the/script" instead of just
"script".

Bad idea to use $0 like that.

I updated my workstation to CentOS 5.7 yesterday with a few issues. None 
of them Firefox related but today when I went work an online class with 
video lectures the adobe-flash-plugin crashes.

Anyone else run into this?  Searches via Google only address installing 
flash and the version that is already on the system RPM claims is newer 
than one just downloaded from the Adobe site.

Is there an error log for Firefox/Flash somewhere on the system. 
Nothing in /var/log as to why it is crashing only reference to the 
install, RPM and YUM logs.


TIA,

If there isn't a command line switch for autowrap (aka linewrap,
aka wraparound, etc.), it's normally handled by an escape sequence
that is sent when the terminal is initialized.  This is handled by
the TERMINFO facility.  In order for that to work correctly,
though, you must have your TERM environment variable set
correctly.  The "-tn rxvt-unicode" switch should do that for you.
(At least on my system, there is an rxvt-unicode terminfo entry,
but not one for urxvt.  YMMV, check in your TERMINFO database,
normally located in /usr/share/*.)

   In /usr/share/terminfo/r/ are rxvt-unicode and rxvt-unicode-256colors. In
/etc/DIR_COLORS I added 'TERM rxvt-unicode' after learning that 'TERM urxvt'
meant nothing to the system.

   I just added '-tn rxvt-unicode' to the command line; no difference. Here's
what I see when I cd to a deep subdirectory:

</washington/echo-bay-exploration/bore-holes-wq/
</washington/echo-bay-exploration/bore-holes-wq/

<q/

   This is on Slackware-13.1/32-bit running Xfce. It's quite distracting to
see this rather than the wrapped lines that vanilla rxvt displayed.

The PLUG Advanced Topics, Perl Mongers, and Postgresql groups all meet 
at Free Geek.  The acoustics are not noteworthy, since the meeting room 
is only about 20'x30' and gets crowded with more than 20 people.  The 
classroom has slightly more space.  Both spaces are quiet and there 
usually isn't anything else happening in the building during the 
meetings.  You would need to get approved and deal with access issues 
since the building is locked after 6pm.

Another option might be Collective Agency.

Subject: [PLUG] duplicating window in X?
Message-ID: <20111019192514.GA4772@gate.kl-ic.com>

I assume it is possible to duplicate the same identical graphic
window from the same client on two different X displays ("servers"). 

Can this be done, how is it done, and what is the process called?

The tricky part is that each X display has a keyboard and a mouse.
When the operator of each display moves their mouse into the window,
I would expect the mouse movements to be combined somehow, and the
text stream from each keyboard to be combined also.  Perhaps there
is no good way do do that, and so displaying the same client on two
displays simultaneously won't work.

Why?  Imagine a clerk working with a customer to collaboratively
fill out a form, both having mice and keyboards. 

The other way to do it is to use a video splitter box and display
the same screen image on two screens, from a computer with two mice
and two keyboards on it (easy to do with USB hubs).  That does not
permit different windows on the rest of the screen. and asynchronous
activities - the customer looking up stuff on a browser while the
clerk consults a PDF policy manual, for example, then returning to
the form to work together.  It also requires both participants to
be in one place.

Have you talked to Puppet Labs? They've been open to hosting several 
groups but I don't know the terms. Free Geek has the challenge of 
needing a key holder (and no food) and I believe Collective Agency has a 
fee. These remain the most promising based on my ongoing research.

Hrm...  If your prompt works correctly with other terminal
programs (i.e., using urxvt is the only difference), I'd say
you've hit a bug in urxvt.  Out of curiosity, does autowrap work
in other contexts, or is it just the shell prompt?  What happens
if you expand the terminal's window out to, say, 132 columns?

Is there a reason to be using urxvt in particular?  Something that
other terminal programs won't do?  If this is a bug in urxvt, I'd
say find another terminal emulator.  And report the bug to the
programmer, of course.  For that matter, do you need the entire
directory path in your prompt?  Putting just the current
directory in your prompt would at least be a workaround.

Thank you all who came to the short-notice Android Developer Bridge 
talk. Eight showed up and most with guinea pig phones.

If you didn't see it, Google released Android 4.0 today. A search of 
"ice cream sandwich" will find it and a number of delicious deserts.

The coolest revelation appears to have been Webkey 
http://androidwebkey.com/ somewhat like a remotely-accessible dashboard 
for your phone at bit like Webmin and with the ability to see what is on 
your screen (slowly) and get its location via GPS and a map.

Another find was something that Keith mentioned: Green Century 
Electronics Recycling down at 6923 SW Macadam. 
www.greencenturyonline.net They are an electronics recycler not unlike 
Free Geek for that function but with a good selection of LCD displays at 
reasonable prices. Free Geek's tend to get consumed by their (awesome) 
volunteer program.

Dale,

   I've used xterm, aterm, eterm, and rxvt (my standard the past few years)
and did not have this problem before. I wrote to one of the urxvt developers
a few days ago but have seen no reply.

> Out of curiosity, does autowrap work in other contexts, or is it just the

   I get funky behavior in alpine when composing and sending a reply; alpine
resides in a urxvt wrapper. I've tried expanding the window width and it
makes no difference. Let me try a huge one (on the 20" wide screen ... as
soon as the text gets close to the right margin of the window it wraps, but
truncates the leftmost characters. I've no way of telling how many
characters, but a couple in any case. I had the window set to 180x25 and
could invoke the behavior by cd'ing from one buried subdirectory to another
when specifying the entire path from my home directlry.

> Is there a reason to be using urxvt in particular?

   Well, regular rxvt does not handle utf-8; I see strange characters
instead. I've read quite a few comparisons saying that if you don't need the
DEC and other terminal support of xterm you're better off with a less
resource intensive vt such as rxvt.

Subject: [PLUG] Choosing an nVidia card
Message-ID: <4E9F395D.4020903@comcast.net>

My desktop machine croaked on Sunday. On Tuesday I visited that fine 
emporium of well priced, used equipment -- The Free Geek Thrift Store -- 
and acquired a "new" machine. It has most of what I wanted, and I 
upgraded most of the rest. The Sony VAIO box includes:

Intel D915GRO motherboard
Pentium 4  3.00 GHz
4 GB RAM
500 GB SATA hard drive

Ubuntu 10.04 is up and running.

Unfortunately Free Geek didn't have any nVidia cards yesterday so I'm 
now looking for that upgrade.

The motherboard includes an "Intel Graphic Media Accelerator 900, 224MB 
Max. dynamically allocated shared video memory. It also has "One PCI 
Express x16 slot" and "One PCI Express x 1 slot". My old machine had an 
AGP slot into which my old nVidia card went.

I have not kept up with video card technology so I'm not sure on what to 
focus as I look through the nVidia options. I'm guessing that PCI 
Express x 16 is better than x 1. Beyond that the only other thing that 
may be important is that I also got a ViewSonic VG2030wm monitor that 
has both an analog input and a DVI-D input. From that I'm assuming that 
I need to be looking at nVidia cards that are PCI Express x 16 and have 
a DVI-D output.

Anything else that I need to know?

Second question: Is it possible to use both the on-board video and the 
PCI Express at the same time (going to different monitors, of course)?

Thanks for all advice, tips, pointers, etc.

It seems like just the group for PSU.  You don't list food/alcohol as
requirements, and I'd guess that you wouldn't have a hard time finding
a faculty sponsor at PSU.  I originally learned about R (actually
S-plus, although he knew about R and that's all I used) from a guy
teaching a graduate level environmental statistics class there.

Okay, this is getting weird.  I just tried urxvt myself -- plain
vanilla, no .Xresources file, no command line switches.  It wraps
correctly, even my ridiculously long directory name prompt.

I've been using ROXTerm recently, and it seems to work fairly
well.  I've even fed it Japanese characters (kanji and kana) and
it was happy with it.  To make sure of this, I just pulled up the
Square-Enix web site in Japan (<http://www.square-enix.com/>)
using elinks in both ROXTerm and urxvt and both displayed the
characters correctly.  I'm using ROXTerm v. 1.18.5, rxvt-unicode
v. 9.12, and elinks v. 0.12-0.23.pre5.fc14.  (This on a 64 bit
Fedora 14 box.)

So.  Urxvt works here, at least as far as I've taken it.  It looks
to me as if you have some sort of mis-configuration somewhere.
Best thing to do is back out all the configuration changes (rename
.Xresources to .xresources.old, or something), and see if urxvt
works that way.  If it does, then you can put things back until it
breaks again.  If it's still broken, even with no command line or
.Xresources options, then I have NO idea what's worng.

Sorry I can't be more help.

There is a story, perhaps apocryphal, about a Sun server that had been
running for as long as anyone could remember, but could not be found
within the building.  Eventually, it was found behind the drywall,
covered with dust, in a space that had been remodelled years before.

In a past life (Solaris vs AIX admin) I had a couple servers with over
1,000 days uptime and no issues.

I would now but one has to keep the uSofties happy, I reboot most
every 100-150 days.

I heard the same story. Only it was a bricked up wall, and a Novell server. I heard this back around Novell 3.12 timeframe.

Russell,

   Parking around PSU is a serious hassle.

   We have met at a couple of restaurants, but the facilities are not the
best because of poor acoustics. One member is on the stat faculty of Reed,
but I think FreeGeek would be ideal for a quiet, useful meeting room.
Libations can be had at the Lucky Lab for those so inclined ... or, at
least, consumed without becoming inclined.

Thanks,

Rich

FWIW, I haven't had much trouble recently for 7pm-ish meetings.  I had
no trouble at all for the October PLUG meeting, after school had
started.  Also, there is good public transportation there.  For a
small group, I wouldn't worry too much about it.  Much earlier in the
evening and it's likelier to get dicey.

Reed ought to host it then!  FreeGeek is a nice last resort, and bless
them for being there, but Reed should get a chance to host more nerdy
stuff!  Hell, they've got a freaking nuclear reactor.  What better

Subject: [PLUG] USB and Wine
Message-ID: <4E9FA718.5050501@comcast.net>

Is anyone using a USB device with Wine?

In my search for a solution to my transcription software problem I 
finally found the instructions for correctly installing Express Scribe 
with Wine. I got the program running this time and successfully loaded 
an audio file and can play it. The next step is to have it work with the 
USB foot pedal. Express Scribe can do this, but it needs the correct 
driver for the USB pedal. My Googling suggests that Wine doesn't do USB, 
yet, but that it can do it with a couple of patches. That instruction is 
on a page from 2008, which makes me suspicious that it's out of date. 
The page is:

http://wiki.winehq.org/USB

There is another page that suggests that this is still the way to get 
USB support in Wine:

http://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?t=13325&sid=7925fbf58174ed5f23f9206d46f192eb

So, before I uninstall Wine, download the source, add the patch(es), and 
compile it, I thought I'd see if anyone else has had success with it.

Thanks.

Subject: [PLUG] Reconfigure Gingerbread or Reconfigure Wireless Router
Message-ID: <20111020001204.4740a29c@mailhost.pdx.edu>

My new Samsung Galaxy S2 comes with Gingerbread, 2.3.4. My Linksys
WRT54G router is set to 192.168.0.103. It is connected to a port on my
ethernet switch. Everything in the house is connected by ethernet; the
only purpose of the WRT54G is to provide wifi for the phone.

My previous phone ran Android 2.2.1. It had no problem seeing and
connecting to the WRT54G. The SGS2 can see it and knows that it is
secured, but it cannot connect because some idiot decided that passwords
must be at least eight characters long, and the password I set on the
WRT54G is seven characters long. When I type the password into the
phone the "Connect" button remains grayed out until I enter at least
eight characters. 

I must figure out a way to change the behavior of Gingerbread, or I
must reset the password on the WRT54G. The latter would probably be
much easier. I feel I should also locate the person responsible for
deciding that passwords must be at least eight digits long and make
sure they never have offspring. But that will have to wait for another
day.

That is, I thought that changing the password on the WRT54G would be
easy. Opening a web browser page and trying to connect to
http://192.168.0.103 results in "problem loading page." This happens
even from my laptop and even when the laptop is connected to the WRT54G
via the laptop's own wireless hardware. That is, I can't connect to
the web-based configuration page for the WRT54G whether the laptop is
connected via ethernet, via its wireless to the WRT54G, or via both.

I could use some clues.

sounds like you want something like vnc.  you can certainly
multiply-connect and define the behavior to be either both-drive or
one-drives,one-watches.

there are a variety of other programs in the same vein (vnc extensions
like ultra & tight vnc, as well as completely different things like
nx) and wrappers around vnc that make things fancier/easier, so don't
stop looking just because stock vnc lacks one feature you need.

if all you need is text, gnu screen allows multi-attach again with
acl's that allow read/write as well as read-only for the second
attacher.

luck++;

JJJ,
Unless you have spent a lot of time customizing the settings on your router,
i would recommend resetting your router to factory default.  Then you can
enter a new longer password for your router.  To reset your WRT54G, press a
pencil or whatever will fit into the reset button behind the router, & kepp
that button pressed in.  Then power up your router.  I think it takes a good
30 seconds or so before it rests.  Then remove the pencil & use the default
password to set up your router.  Default is something like admin then blank
space for password.  It can be found through a search engine like
https://www.startpage.com.

Cheers,

Elcaset

If this thing you are calling an ethernet switch is actually a router or is
connected to a router, then you have two routers and two networks. The
ethernet switch network and the WRT54G network. The ethernet switch is
giving out IP addresses on one network, the WRT54G is giving out addresses
on another network.  If  that is the case then 192.168.0.103 is the address
given to the WRT54G by the ethernet switch.  Something that connects to the
WRT54G directly by wireless gets an IP address on its subnet. Let's guess
192.168.1.?, not 192.168.0.?   The WRT54G is by default configured to allow
access to its configuration only if you  are in it's subnet.  So, to
configure the WRT54G connect to the WRT54G via the laptop with wireless. The
laptop will get an address from the WRT54G. Check to see what that IP
address is. Then from the laptop point the browser to
http://192.168.?.0where ? is on the WRT54G network.

I find that x11vnc seems to work pretty well for remotely helping with a 
running session (vs needing to run a vnc server and connect-in from 
both users.)  The '-id'/'-sid' options look very interesting for 
Keith's use, but might assume that your program will not have any popup 
dialogs (maybe just do '-clip').

I think it has to be a completely shared cursor+keyinput with vnc, which 
leads to control conflicts and you typically need to have a voice 
connection going to negotiate who is controlling.  The main problem I 
have is getting my vncviewer window unfocussed without a) moving the 
remote mouse or b) sending 'alt' or another meta key to the remote end 
(only the 'alt' part of alt+tab makes it through and then the remote 
user gets surprised when 'alty' things start happening.)  If warranted, 
some extra input hardware and a bit of Perl would let you have an 
on/off switch for the remote window focus (see your spare tenkey pad, 
Linux::USBKeyboard and X11::GUITest's SetInputFocus(), RaiseWindow(), 
and LowerWindow().)

Two cursors is possible, but that's a whole different bag of mice:

To clarify that a little, because the WRT54G creates a subnet of its own and
is also connected to the other router so is part of the other router's
subnet, it has two ip addresses. we know 192.168.0.103 is one of them, the
other one is probably 192.168.1.0 or 192.168.2.0  or 192.168.?.0  and you
need to connect to it via that IP on its subnet in order to configure it,
not via the 192.168.0.103 address.

I will look at vnc some more, but as I understand it, vnc copies
desktops, not the single window outputs of single applications
("clients" in X parlance).  I specifically do NOT want to share
whole desktops.

I'll provide an example.   Using the special duplication process,
(which I still need a name for!) I bring up an xterm on the desktop
of display/machine A, and that same xterm (via some magic) appears
on the otherwise completely independent display/machine B connected
over the internet.  With my focus over that xterm on machine A,
mouse movements and keyboard movements are fed to the xterm client
(which could be running on machine C, BTW).  The user on machine
B sees an identical xterm window on their own entirely different
desktop, and can also feed mouse and keyboard information to it
when that xterm is in focus.  Otherwise, the desktop of A is invisible
to B, and of B invisible to A.   There can be entirely different
applications running, screen sizes, hardware, etc.

This behavior is already inherent in X, for single windows tied
to single clients.   Already, you can run applications on remote
machines and have their display windows appear on yours.  Except
for communication delays, it is just like being there.  For 
example, if you have a student account on the linux machines at
Portland State, you can ssh to an account on one of their 
machines, and start firefox with the -remote option.  Firefox
runs on the PSU machine, the display is on your own machine, and
you have access to PSU resources.  I've done this to control one
of the unix-based test systems in the ECE test lab.  Slow, but
I don't have to carbon my way into Portland and find parking.
Tolerably fast with 15/5 FIOS, even through peering in Seattle.

In this case, I want to ask the X client to open TWO displays.
That would not be inherent in the client, but I can imagine
opening the client with the environment variable DISPLAY=Double,
where Double is a "pretend display" that opens identical windows
on machines A and B.

I suppose "Double" could be a fake desktop with no physical
hardware attached, which in turn is accessed by two instances
of vnc running on machine/displays A and B.  Perhaps the fake
desktop could be on a real video card with no display attached.
But that multiplies the watts and the computation involved.

Is it clearer what I want?  Remember, X already does something
like this with single display servers, so duplicating the X
message stream to two display servers is not inherently difficult.

HI All,

I spent 3 hours at Frys last night playing with different Tablets.

I have it down to 2 models:

     1) Acer Iconia
     2) Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1

The Iconia has inputs/outputs galore, but weighs a little more.
The Galaxy Tab has NO inputs/outputs (relies on external dongle 
adapters), but is very sexy, light and streamlined.

I am struggling between the useability of the Iconia and the 
portability/sex appeal of the Galaxy.

My primary use will be mobile out in the field, but I do need the 
ability to connect to a projector and
attach external storage occasionally.

Thoughts?

Both my keyboard and mouse are USB, and work well with anything I've tried
them with. It's probably been about a year since I needed wine for anything
(other than to drink) but when I did use it I don't remember any problems at
all. I was impressed with the progress that's been made with that project. I
only use it probably 1-2 times a year on average, so I'm not at all a power
user of it. They have really improved its quality from back when I was first
using it!

If it would help I could get it going later today and check for you, or if
yours isn't working I can tell you what's in config files or anything else
that might help. I won't be available until mid afternoon at best, possibly
even not until early evening.

Subject: [PLUG] Patient records on Live CD
Message-ID: <20111020152603.GA8969@gate.kl-ic.com>

My wife's new clinic will be running OpenEMR, an open source
medical records program.  Sometimes patients (or their other
doctors) want copies of their records.  Rather than kill trees,
I am thinking about putting their patient record on a stripped
down linux live CD, along with a specially configured version
of OpenEMR.  

This would have interesting "evangelistic" consequences for
both Linux and OpenEMR.

To do this properly, the patient data portions of the live
CD should be password encrypted.  Also, it would be nice
to have a very fast CD writer, with some kind of automagic
labelling system so that the CD gets a readable label before
it is handled by people (we don't want to accidentally swap
the CDs going to two different patients).  

A live CD has the additional advantage that we are no longer
dependent on the patient's own dodgy home PC security for
protecting their medical information.  If they want, they
could probably mount their hard drive and copy the information
to it, but anyone smart enough to do that may be slightly
more clueful about security, and assumes responsibility in
any case.  

And as I understand it, many Linux Live CDs boot on intel
Mac hardware reasonably well.  

How does this sound?  Would you like your own doctor to 
do something like this?

Sounds excellent. From your verbiage, it sounds like you're up to speed
on HIPPA and related privacy regulations. I assume they don't regulate
in this kind of detail (but don't know). Assuming you have the
flexibility available, have you considered using USB keys -- they could
be set up with read/only (for the "Live CD") and read/write partitions
(for patient data). I assume such rw partitions can be LUKS encrypted. 

Drawbacks -- that means you wouldn't have access to the CD labelers that
laser the label right on top of the media, and USB keys are more
expensive.

Thanks,
Mike

My pivot point would be to find out which one has the most custom ROMs
available in the developer community, as well as finding out which has
the most lively developer community.  On the one hand, more I/O devices
might make custom ROMs seem buggy because the hackers have to handle all
that stuff.  On the other hand, if the hackers can't figure out a way to
make a single I/O device do what they need, then more I/O devices will
make it more usable.

I wonder if a multi-session CD would meet your needs.  Theoretically
you could pre-write a bunch of CDs with the live image, and then just
add the patient data as needed.  I say theoretically because I've
never tried to create a multi-session CD.

Evangelism aside, and just plain having fun as well ...
    the core need is sharing records in a secure way
... so one might ask oneself ...
    (a) if the recipient has to boot from the CD, is the record truly 
sharable?
    (b) is there a HIPPA standard format that might be more useful?
    (c) what happens when a record is sent to another medical office?

I don't know the answers, nor do I have a need to know ... and there are 
probably other questions as well.  What I am saying is that I have had 
enough personal experience in trying to get information shared between 
offices ... even if they are all 100% MS ... to suggest that that one 
try to focus on need and reality.
    Need in this case is share the record
    Reality is what actually happens, or is likely to happen, or be 
tolerated
       Make it too complex and it will probably not fly

Hope this helps
Regards
Fred James

You guessed correctly, and I'm sorry I didn't make it clearer that
there were two networks.

This morning, after coffee, it dawned on me that I should check what
password I actually set up on the WRT54G. Looking at the settings in
the laptop Gnome GUI it turns out that I used a different password than
I originally thought, and it is nine characters. The phone was happy to
connect to it once I entered the correct password.

It's still lame that Gingerbread can't connect to a network that
requires fewer than eight characters, and someone must die for that.

It's also still perplexing why I cannot connect to the WRT54G. Once you
pointed out that the 192.168.0.103 was being handed out by the wired
router I realized that you were absolutely correct. My excuse for not
realizing that previously is that it was late at night when I was trying
this. However, this morning I attempted to get into the WRT54G, but have
still failed. 

On the laptop I turned off ethernet and turned on wireless. From the
command line ifconfig showed wlan0, but it said its address was
10.42.43.1. That can't possibly be right, although I did open a browser
page to confirm. 

I should add that the wired router is a D-Link, whose default address
is 192.168.0.1. As I recall I just left it at that, so the whole wired
network is on 0, not 1.

But with the laptop using only the wireless I still cannot get into
the WRT54G. The factory default for Linksys routers is 192.168.1.1, but
that doesn't work either. (Note to self: Next time you set up a router
put a sticker on it and write down the address you gave it.) The laptop
insists the address of the WRT54G is 10.42.43.1. However, the phone says
it is 192.168.0.104. Neither will open the configuration page from
Firefox on the laptop. Firefox on the phone won't go there either. 

Although the immediate problem is solved, I still ought to figure out
how to get into the configuration page for the WRT54G, just for future
needs.

vnc does start its OWN x server.  on that server, you can choose to
run no window manager and only one client that takes up the entire
desktop (and the server can run at any geometry, being virtual...say,
exactly the size of one perfectly sized xterm, or just 100x100 pixels
if you wanted to cram it onto a tablet in the corner), and then when
someone else connects to it, all they see is an xterm, and even if
they manage to close the xterm, they can't do anything else to the
remote session--there's no clicking on the root window to bring up a
context menu, because a window manager, not X win itself, provides
that.

i guess one thing that might bug you is that you can't have two
cursors at the same time.  i'd argue that you actually don't want
that--does your app actually know what to do when two people try to
focus different modal dialog boxes or form fields simultaneously?  i
know my web browser will just move focus to whichever form field was
clicked last, and then both people are typing into the same field
without intending to.  the way vnc handles it is to allow either
person to move *the* cursor.  you can certainly play cursor tug of war
and type alternating characters from alternating displays if you want
to, tho.

so it sounds to me like you can do what you want, and without much
fiddling (the default vnc session is 'twm', but you set what clients
are run at startup via the file .vnc/xstartup, so you just replace all
that with "/path/to/xterm -your-options", run vncserver, and you are
done making your example work.)

there are two ways to go about this with vnc, both of which are not 0
configuration (require running at least one command).  but even in
your proposed setup of a multi-display-aware app, someone has to grant
someone else permission to connect to their x server, so i don't think
this is an additional hurdle, merely the same hurdle you'd already be
jumping over at least once per login.

in my proposed setup, machine B has to run "vncviewer A:1"; A's
"desktop" (which in this case consists entirely of the xterm) doesn't
just appear on B.

the other option is that at least one of the vnc variants actually
reaches out and connects to a remote client (which would of course
need to be savvy enough to have granted you connection authority via
xauth, which is way harder that running the vncviewer command imho
(the arguments never change to vncviewer;  they almost certainly will
via xauth).

it appears that ultravnc server might be one that connects outbound to
a remote "client" (aka user) for you.  i've never used that
functionality, so you get to investigate it yourself.

vnc handles all authentication itself (in the 'vncviewer A:1 scenario
above), meaning you set a password for the connection which the user
at B will need to know.  it can in fact be an empty password, at least
with tightvnc.

all of that holds with vnc (either person can drive the
cursor/keyboard, and the other person sees it scooting around; since
vncserver is itself a CLIENT to the actual :0 desktop, there is no :0
leakage to or from B, whose vncviewer is also a client to *its* :0),
including that the xterm client could be running on C like this:

on A: <give C permission via xauth or xhost (shudder) to display
clients on its :1 $DISPLAY>

on C:

export DISPLAY=A:1
xterm

you can of course run whatever app or combination or apps you want on
A's vnc (:1) desktop, including firefox or openoffice or the gimp
(note, the gimp is really hard to use without a window manager!).
heck, you can run many apps, again even without a window manager
(-geometry is your friend) and give the person access to all of them.
or you can just use a WM and get virtual desktops inside that virtual
desktop to allow better multi-window handling/display--it just depends
on how much you trust the remote client.

speaking of trust, vnc offers a read-only mode in case you really
don't trust the client.  they just get to be voyeurs, not
participants.  doesn't sound like you need it, but you haven't
actually told us what you're doing with this so i am offering extra
options.

i think i got it from the start, though you didn't seem to get that
the solution i offered might work for you.

and while what i am describing is not the exact *implementation* you
seem to be hung up on having (an application or maybe X11 library that
is multi-connect aware, if i am reading you correctly), i maintain
that it is a valid, non-kludgey, functional equivalent.  it's actually
supra-functional, since you can use it on ANY app that already works
under x with minimal fuss.  oh, and it's cross-platform, in case you
were ever at the library without your computer, and you needed to do
the 2nd connect from a windows machine.  or your palm pilot.  or any
web browser that supports java (another feature of vnc is that it has
a java connector that works entirely in a browser).

vnc's x server is very low-resource compared to an actual x server,
and so yes, there is some memory usage overhead, but it is just about
negligible since you don't have to run a second window manager, etc--i
used to run vncserver on a 200mhz handheld sharp zaurus with something
like 64MB ram and using it for remote access at the same time as i was
using the zaurus interactively on console caused no slowdown for the
console user.  i imagine that any tablet being manufactured today
could handle it without blinking, and i imagine them to be the most
cpu-starved situation you might exist in today. (says the fellow who
still runs a fanless 1ghz via fileserver with 256MB of memory).

ultravnc offers a wide array of compression options to best serve
whatever kind of remote connection you have.  it's gpl'ed.

perhaps i am still missing the point and this doesn't solve your
problem.  if so, please explain what you are *actually trying to do*
instead of providing hypothetical examples so the next hour i spend
coming up with a solution can be useful to you =)

if i missed, please include in your proposed actual implementation a
list of gotchas like "stream must be encrypted" (tunnel vnc over ssh),
or "no my application really does understand two cursors and keyboard
input streams and uses them in manner X" (and explicitly list the xwin
api's or extensions that it uses to do so).

i agree, the concept seems simple.  i suspect creating the
implementation is more hairy than we suspect, versus using an existing
tool that provides functional equivalence.  but hey, if you're gonna
roll your own...vnc's source code is probably a good place to start
looking =)

luck++;

Unless I specifically requested electronic records, I don't think that 
would be my first choice. I'd rather have paper:

  * I can easily make copies for other care providers
  * I don't need to know anything about computers
  * It fits better with other filed medical records
  * I don't have to remember a password

My opinions are my own, of course. I don't pretend to be speaking for 
others.

while i would love it if my doctor did it, i'd also figure out how to
do my own tech support to make it boot.

imagine my mom, who got her netbook without a CD-rom drive and even if
she purchases ("what kind do i need to buy?") and attaches ("what kind
of cable do i need?") one, has to change the bios to allow her to boot
from it.  and imagine trying to figure out when to hit what hotkey to
bring the bios screen up (my netbook goes straight into linux without
showing the bios screen at all--i have to hit a key like crazy from
the instant of power-on to make it happen).

i think the added complexity will have *you* doing tech support,
remotely, on unknown hardware.  almost certainly, someone's hardware
will be broken or otherwise incapable of running linux.  and what
happens when the person who needs the records is an EMT who doesn't
have a computer handy or needs that tech support at 4am in an
ambulance?

i think i'd pay 10% more to go to that linux-savvy doctor, but i think
most people wouldn't appreciate it like the folks on this list =)

I could understand how the phone says it is 192.168.0.104, maybe you
configured the WRT54G as a bridge to  the other network so that the WRT54G
is not handing out IP addresses, instead it is passing that function on to
the D-Link. However, that would not explain why the laptop got an address on
a totally different subnet. Something odd is going on here.   How about
connecting the wire of the laptop directly to the WRT54G and finding out
what address it gets.

Thanks for the offer.

Keyboards and mice aren't a problem. What I need to do is to figure out 
how to get Wine to install and use a driver for my USB foot pedal. But, 
Googling leads me to understand that Wine doesn't do drivers since it is 
a user space vs. kernel space program -- at least I think that's what I 
read on the Wine wiki.

Production isn't held up since I can still boot to (shudder) XP and use 
Express Scribe there.

Humorous result of Googling: vec usb linux

(vec is the brand name of the foot pedal)

I found a link to an archive of a thread that sounded just like what I'm 
trying to do. As I started reading the thread more and more of it 
sounded familiar. There is a good reason for that -- I wrote it on PLUG 
back in May, 2011! I wasn't paying attention to the names on the posts 
until I came to a post where I say that I posted the output of lsusb -v 
on my comcast web site. I did read then name of the web site and 
realized it was mine. :-)

One useful thing about that thread is that it gives the link to the 
transcribe program I used to use on my old machine.

The application is later "versions" of my wife's medical clinic.
Collaborative work, between doctor and patient, or medical assistant
and patient, filling out forms or looking at documents.  Or, office
manager and accountant, working on Quickbooks on Win7 in Virtualbox
(open source accounting would be better, but a separate discussion). 
In the beginning, we will just use two back-to-back screens off a
video splitter, with two mice and two keyboards on the same desk. 
But it would be nice to move the workspace around, between rooms
and eventually offsite.  

This will be implemented incrementally, but I don't want to start
off in a direction that is incompatable with later improvements,
hence my learning about the technology and beginning experiments now.

What you say about vnc is plausible and informative.  I was confused
by the emphasis on moving whole desktops in other online discussions.

Good point on resale and future support

The Iconia has very little Manufacturer overhead
The Galaxy has a whole layer on top of Honeycomb.

It's not a bad layer, mostly styling.

I'll look into rooting and bootloading.

but when it sent the e-mail in the "from" field it would prepend my
Google gmail address - the address that you must set up in order to use
the Android marketplace and other features of Android. This flummoxed
the PLUG mail server so that it rejected the e-mail. I spent hours
trying to get it to stop doing that, to no avail.

I now have a new phone and needed to test whether the problem had been
corrected. Happily it has. However, I had no choice but to send a
message to the list in order to test it. I should have added why I was
sending a test message to the PLUG list, but typing on a phone is
painful. I regret that my failure to explain led you to assume I didn't
know the rules for listservs.

Are there CD labelers other than LightScribe? I have a LightScribe
drive and it is worthless. It takes nearly ten minutes to finish
labeling a disk, it does only washed out gray, and it requires special
disks that are more expensive. If you really want labels I'd suggest
sticking on an Avery label.

Yes. There are inkjet printable disks that are usually no more expensive than non-printable disks. 

I seem to recall a burner with a disk printer all in one unit, but that might be overkill. One would need an inkjet printer capable of handling the printable CDs if they did not have the all in one.

In addition to the suggestions around vnc, you might also look at
xpra <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xpra>, which is intended to be
screen for X (and has a lighter weight protocol than vnc). I don't know
for sure if it can have multiple clients attached to the same xpra
server.

I have my doubts about HID passthrough in Wine, but have you considered
using software to make the footpedal emulate keypresses?  I think LIRCd can
do that.

There's some discussion of using hiddev/uinput to accomplish this here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/873975/how-to-capture-raw-hid-input-on-linux

Then you could just map the footpedal's buttons to the corresponding
keyboard commands for Express Scribe.

Good points.  

LiveCDs can indeed write to the system disk (a bit more work for
NTFS, but not impossible) - but unless the patient (or physician)
understands the data security implications of what they are doing,
it is probably better that they don't.  Hence, you don't want a
"one click transfer", though that could be arranged.

There are standard interchange formats for medical information
( HL7, DICOM, etc ), and data in those formats will also be
encrypted on the CD.  Patients won't have the tools to look at
them, but they can use OpenEMR on the disk itself to do so.

Medical practices using a proprietary EMR may need the skills
of their IT geek to import the data into the proprietary form
used by their EMR.  Not because the translation is difficult,
but because most doctors and med-techs have limited IT skills.

By putting both the data and the application on a CD, in open
and replicable formats, capability propagates at the same speed
as the information.  Combined with virtualization, it may
someday be possible to move just about any open data anywhere,
with almost zero setup overhead.  Yes, it is a lot of bits, but
the pipes are getting bigger much more quickly than ordinary
people are improving their software install and maintenance skills.

Paper will indeed be available, for the cost of creating it.
My bank charges $10 a month for paper statements, two sheets
of printed paper in a machine-stuffed envelope and bulk 
mailed.  I'm guessing the handling and printing of the 40 or
so pages of the average patient chart would cost about $30,
given the office overhead (about $200 per hour).  With the
right equipment, a CD would be easier to produce.

Note that some chart folders contain more than 500 pages. 
Elderly patients after chemotherapy, for example.  The thicker
the chart, the frailer the patient.  Above 300 pages or so, the
patient is unlikely to be able to lift their own patient chart.

But it is rare for patients to request their charts for 
themselves.  They typically want them to give to another
doctor, either for specialty treatment or for transferring
care.  How many of you have your current patient chart from
your own doctor?  

In any case, other doctors will want an electronic version.
Even if they run a paper office (and those are disappearing
rapidly), they will print out only the pages they need
immediately, and put the CD in the chart folder.  If you
have your chart "just in case", perhaps to take with you
on vacation, a CD in a clamshell case is easier to manage
than paper.  The data can be moved securely over the internet,
but that is beyond the competence of most medical staff.

I am of much the same mind, I don't want to have to reboot to view my
records. The greater issue here I think is that in many business
environments the end user is unable to reboot to CD/DVD due to company
policy. I also feel that a lot of businesses would be unwilling to reboot a
networked office machine to gain access to a single patients records. I
think that a usb device secured in some manner would be the best bet for
usability/adoption. Since you will most likely be distributing to people
running some form of windows this
idea<http://www.pendrivelinux.com/run-a-live-linux-cd-from-within-windows/>,
running a livecd within windows, might be able to be packaged in a way that
works for you and your customers. Allowing the ability to run the livecd
from within windows might remove some barriers to adoption, ie rebooting.
Caveat: yes this link is older and it would probably take a lot of work to
customize it to your needs.

Not exactly what you asked for, but an X11 proxy server sounds like it
could approximate the desired functionality.  The Xdmx project is an
example:

http://dmx.sourceforge.net/

Another possibility might be to set the "shared" environment up as a two
screen display, start up the client app and drag it so it straddles the
two screens.  The app would need to do the duplicating so that each half
displays the same data.  Pretty sure a single X display can have multiple
keyboards and mice so it should be doable, just not that elegant.

Might be a whole lot easier to run your shared fillable form in a web
browser, no?

As I've thought more about this I realize that mapping to keyboard 
commands probably won't work. I use Express Scribe to listen to the 
recording. I use OpenOffice Writer to type. While typing the OO window 
has the focus so any key presses would be interpreted by OO unless 
there's some other trick I don't know about that let's some keyboard 
commands go to one program while another program has the focus. As I 
look at the link you provided there might be something in there. I'll 
dig further.

Thanks.

showkey(1) and xmodmap(1) are your friends (but read the man pages
_carefully_).  Showkey will you what keycodes the foot switches
emit.  Xmodmap will let you map them to whatever you need, before
any application program sees them.  For example, I have my Caps
Lock and Left Ctrl keys swapped.  Works like a charm.

Would it be simpler to print to a PDF, export to the top N formats for
EMR data interchange, write a README for the EMR user's tech to look
at, and encrypt it all to removable media?

For CDs you could create a run-on-insert program that does something
simple like open the encrypted PDF (stored separately for
simplicity?), so the non-tech savy user could trivially enter the
credentials you provide through an auxiliary channel.

The people who actually know what EMR software is can find the README
(or be pointed to it by the same startup app, potentially) and follow
those directions for their required interchange format.

I'd be happy with a PDF on CD - and I'd actually rather have it
unencrypted if that's allowable, since I'd only need to track one
thing (the CD) and not that + a password.  This seems no less secure
than paper, but HIPAA may disagree.

If you had a Linux program that would play sound files, and let you control
it with the footpedal, would you still need Express Scribe?

Also, I think there's a way to send keyboard commands to a background window.

One of the advantages of ES is the time position in the recording. 
Transcribing a 2 hour interview can take 6-8 hours, depending on the 
noise and the pacing of the speaker. So having a way to return to the 
place where I stopped is important. ES remembers where that point is 
between sessions. The transcription program I used up until a few weeks 
ago most times remembers the position, but for times when it forgets it, 
it has a "jump to" command that can put me there easily.

Speaking of that other program, I put a link to it in one of the 
postings of that thread from May I found on an archiving site this 
morning, so I'll be able to go see if there's been more activity with 
it. I should have some time to do that tomorrow.

> Also, I think there's a way to send keyboard commands to a background window.

That could be useful. I'd actually prefer to use the program I was using 
all summer, but if I can't figure that out, sending commands from the 
foot pedal to the Wine window in the background will be worth a shot.

Thanks for the thoughts.

I believe my workplace would be open to hosting meetings of geeky assortments.

We have a couple large conference rooms (one can hold ~30, another can
hold 15) with projectors, smart board/touch screen projector, and
regular dry-erase stuff, and nice puffy chairs.
Also comes with free guest Wifi sitting on a fat pipe. Beverages are
generally acceptable, so long as we keep clean.

Its in the Pittock Building (SW 10th and Washington), if anyone is interested.

I can't vouch for that particular board, but I have gotten Intel
Motherboards to run both on-board and PCI-express video at the same
time.  With two on the PCI-express slot, you could do three at once.

And/or HDMI outputs, which are similar enough to DVI-D that adapters
are cheap. PCH has a 6.5' HDMI to DVI-D cable currently selling for
$3.50.

 PCIe x1 is not only 16X slower than x16, new ones are way spendy so
used ones are probably scarce as hen's teeth.

That raises another question: If the nVidia card has a 15-pin VGA output 
and a DVI output, are those for separate monitors or are they just two 
different ways to get to one monitor out of the card?

Dick,

   They're two different output formats. Not all monitors support DVI (as I
discovered with my replacement 19" Hamms-G wide screen). You can run a
capable monitor with either. The DVI is brighter and has a sharper image. As
Galen told me, once you switch from VGA to DVI you won't want to return.

I suspected something about them being slower. I didn't think about them 
being more expensive. I shouldn't be surprised, though, since it works 
that way with hard drives -- a new 500 GB SATA drive is cheaper than a 
new 320 GB "old style" drive.

I haven't tried Craig's list, yet, but I have looked at ENU and at a 
gamer's supply place out near me, NWCA. They have a BFG GEFORCE210 PCIe 
512MB VIDEO CARD

http://www.nwca.com/product.asp?pf_id=IO-V90313

And their cords are in the $10-12 range. After I verify that I have 
enough power supply to support it I'm leaning towards that card because 
they're only a few miles away.

Meaning two electrical connections for the same image? Derek's comment 
regarding a card with two DVI outputs suggests two separate images.

I am expecting that.

I'm hoping to still use the Samsung monitor I bought from you several 
years ago as the second monitor. Now that you mention it though, I'll 
probably be somewhat disappointed with it if it's signal doesn't come 
from the nVidia card since that's what is in the box I bought from you 
at the same time. That's been a really nice, clear image. It is an AGP 
card, though, an this "new" motherboard doesn't have an AGP slot.

Dick,

   As far as I know, they're the same image. My guess is that a card with two
ports of the same type are designed to feed two monitors; with one of each
type one monitor.

It's not that great even at night. But it's 5-6 blocks from the red and
blue Max lines, and 7-8 blocks from the yellow and green lines, plus
it's right on the trolley line. And the trolley will take you within a
few blocks of the Lucky Lab NW, if that's of interest.

about all it covered was the basics of probability.

John,

   For those of us coming from the wild lands outside Portland (e.g., Forest
Grove, Troutdale), that's not very helpful. For example, the eastern end of
the MAX line is a bit more than 3 miles from my house.

   In your copious spare time :-) read "Introductory Statistics with R" by
Peter Dalgaard. You'll learn both stats and R.

The x16 slot is typically used for a PCIe video card.  I have a leftover
NVidia PCIe card with 2 DVI outputs (from FreeGeek) if you still need one.

You should be able to use the PCIe and the on-board video at the same time.

That depends on the card. Some will drive two different monitors at the same time, with different images. Others, only one port is active at a time. It should be in the specs of the card as to what they do. Since you are looking at a new (to you at least) card, I'd go with a dual DVI, which would almost always be to drive two monitors with different images. The expanded real estate of a dual screen setup is hard to give up once you've experienced it. 

Incidentally, the difference between an HDMI and a DVI output, besides the shape of the connector, is that HDMI includes the sound signals. That's why adapters from HDMI to DVI are so inexpensive.

Message-ID: <4EA1A186.6080100@comcast.net>

Weird network thing. Both my laptop and my desktop machines are running 
Ubuntu 10.04. When I click on Places > Network on the desktop machine I 
see only an icon for Windows Network. When I click on Places > Network 
on the laptop I see an icon for Acer-Laptop (itself) and Windows 
Network. Neither machine sees the other machine.

Each machine can ping the other successfully.

 From the desktop machine I can drill down in the Windows Network and 
see Acer-Laptop. But double clicking on it gives me an empty list 
labeled "Windows shares on acer-laptop".

Both machines can connect to my wife's machine through Windows Network.

This happened to me the other day, but somehow fixed itself.

Ideas? Clue stick? Two-by-four?

Subject: [PLUG] strange hotplug drive behavior
Message-ID: <CACKgb8Tq_2B9jpM+dqfHaFJpZeo6bRaQTnqFZ6fYaxAiQtjGRQ@mail.gmail.com>

hi folks,

this is a kind of involved question, sorry.  i've already asked the
vendor and the centos forums and gotten no useful advice or
confirmation that this problem has ever been seen before by anyone
else.  the main thing i'm looking for is:

a) has anyone ever seen anything like this before? and
b) any suggestions for ameliorating?


i'm seeing some strange behavior with hot-swap drives and am looking
for help in further debugging or solving the issue. here is our setup:

centos 5.5 x86_64, areca 1680x hardware raid card, external enclosure
with sata drives.

here is the behavior that is baffling me:

on the sata drives, we create a single drive volumeset and raidset via
the card firmware, using up the entire drive. we set the
channel/raid/lun combo to a unique value across all of the drives we
use (that information is stored in the raid card's "metadata"
associated with the drive--so it stays the same across
ejections/insertions/reboots, and you can end up with more than one
drive with the same raid/channel/lun and that creates known problems
with the raid cards, so we avoid it). we label it with the date of
initialization via the raid card, and then we format that drive
(/dev/sdf, for instance) with ext3fs and finally use it to make a
backup. all of this works fine.

when we unmount & eject the drives, it is sometimes but not always the
case that a different drive stuck into the enclosure next shows a
"ghost" filesystem from the old drive. it is always the case that if
we eject the drive corresponding to sdf, only another drive that
becomes sdf will see the old filesystem-not sdg or sde. the areca
volumeset and raidset labels (examined via the areca utility 'cli64'
that accesses the card firmware) have changed to reflect the new drive
(which had an old backup on it and is labelled as such).

however, in linux, the new drive will show up with part of the old
drive's filesystem, and the old drive's statistics (total size and %
of space consumed on the filesystem). so when i mount and browse the
replacement drive, i see the root directory of the old drive, and "df"
reports the same percentages as the old drive. it seems like the
filesystem metadata is cached or something, and the new scsi device
retains that cached information somehow. but no matter how many times
we eject and insert, or umount and remount the "new" sdf, we cannot
seem to get to the existing filesystem on the newly inserted drive.

to recap: areca's CLI64 utility shows new (correct) disk info. linux
(by navigating in a shell or file browser to the mount point of the
mounted volume) shows bad, old info. we effectively cannot use the
drives to restore from because their contents are hidden by the ghost
of the more recent backup. (i say ghost because though the drive
appears full, none of the (old) files and only a few of the
directories are on the filesystem).

the only way we've found to fix it is a reboot, after which the drive
shows up with everything correct (areca labels and filesystem). we
sadly cannot just unload and reload the drivers for the cards because
they are constantly in use by other filesystems. taking the erroneous
drive out and putting it back in, even in a different slot, does not
fix the issue--it still has the ghost image.

deleting and recreating the vs/rs does fix it too--but at the cost of
losing the data that was on the drive - which we'd like to use! the
way the areca driver and the scsi subsystem interact is not entirely
known to me, but upon deleting the raidset, the scsi device goes away,
and upon recreating it, a new scsi device appears (via the kernel
logs, seen in 'dmesg' output)

have you heard of this happening before? and is there way to fix this
or even examine the problem in more detail? (nothing unexpected is
logged by the kernel). i've asked areca's tech support about this but
they say nobody else has reported similar problems and they have no
suggestions. and the fact that linux seems to see the old info while
the card's firmware sees the new info suggests to me that it may be
more of a general kernel issue than an issue with the areca
card--though i don't know if the driver is to blame.

thanks for your advice. please feel free to ask any other questions
and i will get you answers ASAP!

I believe there's a separate checkbox to enable management from a WLAN
connection on one of the configuration pages.

Try hooking the cable back up to the laptop and accessing it at 192.168.0.x.

If that won't work there's also a checkbox for HTTPS and/or HTTPS only
management connection.

1. Do you also give each ext3 filesystem a unique label?
2. Does cli64 have a cache flush command?
3. Have you checked SMART status on the drives? (long shot, but...)
4. Assuming your OS is on a different type of controller, can you unload
and reload the arcmsr module and see if the problem persists?  (You'll
probably have to rescan for partitions.)
5. Have you tried putting the Areca into JBOD mode and using swraid?
Beyond the potential issues with recovering from a proprietary RAID format,
you might want to do some performance comparisons, too.

hmm, no!  i didn't even know ext3 filesystems could have labels!

nope, nothing like.  i did just realize i could try changing the lun
with the drive in to see if that would help.  now to get this
(intermittent but frequent but somehow not reproducible right this
minute) problem to resurface!

yup, they're good.  also it happens across a pool of 10 disks, none
seem immune (various sizes and at least 2 manufacturers)

unfortunately, while my OS is on a different controller, there are
other always-in-use filesystems (render farm that rarely quits
pounding) on that card.

> 5. Have you tried putting the Areca into JBOD mode and using swraid?

would love to, but see above re other filesystems.  it's 3 8 disk
arrays totalling 12 TB, not easily/quickly migrated (since all would
have to be migrated and can't be accessed from outside of this card.
i definitely hate hardware raid a little more every time something
like this happens.  i use swraid on my own machines with quite a bit
of joy at being able to plug a broken array into a different machine
to fix...)

> Beyond the potential issues with recovering from a proprietary RAID format,

of course.  the bottleneck on their network is samba's available
transfer speed (did i mention that the render nodes are windows?)

you did give me some ideas, aaron, thanks!

still looking for that magic "clear the cache" utility.  i hear it's
made of silver bullets and unicorn horns...

Subject: [PLUG] Establishing Proper Line Wrapping In Virtual Terminal
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1110211351050.22445@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   In an earlier thread on this mail list I figured out that the reason UTF-8
did not display properly in virtual terminals and alpine is that rxvt does
not support UTF-8. And xterm doesn't support some options I use, plus even
the developers wrote that it's rather bloated and ancient. So, I went
looking for a virtual terminal that supports UTF-8 to replace rxvt. Turns
out that aterm, eterm, st, and mrxvt don't. But, urxvt (or rxvt-unicode in
terminfo) does. But, there's one major problem that _I_ am experiencing with
urxvt that has so far escaped resolution.

   A couple of days ago I discovered that there's a urxvt mail list,
subscribed, and posted a request for help. That's the only message on that
list since I signed up. Apparently it's a ghost mail list, like the Flying
Dutchman.

   One person on the slackware mail list has tried helping, but so far it's
not resolved the problem. I've added 'urxvt*loginShell: true' to
~/.Xresources, created ~/.inputrc (including /etc/inputrc) with the line
'set horizontal-scroll-mode On' and exported that file. Logged out and back
in each time.

   urxvt works fine except for not properly wrapping long lines. The result
is quite distracting and annoying. I find nothing appropriate on the man
pages or the wiki.

   When I cd to a subdirectory several levels down, or try creating a very
long command line, it is improperly wrapped, and also truncated on the left
side. Example:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ cd GIS/GRASS/grass-6.5svn/
</configure --with-postgres --
<s --with-sqlite --with-cairo --with-freetype --with-cxx \ 
> --with-geos=usr/bin/geos-config --with-gdal=/usr/bin/gdal-config \
<ython-config --with-wxwidgets=/usr/bin/wx-config \

   With vanilla rxvt I'd see the entire lines. With urxvt this occurs no
matter how wide I make the terminal window.

   I'm hoping the collective expertise here can guide me to a resolution of
this problem. I don't know what other virtual terminals for the bash shell
support UTF-8 and yet use few resources while being configurable.

grr, i don't know what i hit to make that go out early.  let's try again!

so i use urxvt exclusively and do not suffer this problem.

what version are you using? ?i have several, one that works is 9.06
and another is 9.09.

what is the termcap or terminfo for the terminal?  you're probably
using terminfo, so if there's no entry for rxvt-unicode in your
termcap file (wherever your distro puts it--mine (ubuntu 10.04 with
the 9.06 urxvt) doesn't even have one anymore!), what is the output of
'infocmp rxvt'?  i'll compare it to mine and we can try swapping if
they are different.

hmm, so you think that it is a shell issue, not a terminal issue?
(that is what the attempted solution above does.  have you made
certain that the shell does in fact become a login shell, listens to
.inputrc, and that your xresources are taking effect?  btw, you can
"source" the .Xresources file with xrdb like so:

xrdb < ~/.Xresources (then run a new copy of urxvt from any shell or
menu or whatever--that affects all of xwin).

what shell are you using?

well, if you are worried this is a shell issue, have you tried a
different shell so you can verify whether or not it is urxvt at fault?
 like, install and try zsh or tcsh and see if they behave the same.

i have no inputrc and use bash with a pretty stripped down bashrc,
fyi.  the only rxvt-related xresources i set are:

Rxvt.font:              -sony-*-*-*-*-*-24-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

You got me curious about SMB performace optimization, and I stumbled
across: http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Linux_Performance

They claim a 66% bump in SMB write performance.

if only i'd been benchmarking writes!  i just benchmarked reads.  the
fileserver can crank out nfs at near-wirespeed (2Gbit (bonded)) esp
when working with cached files (on the raid card or in host mem), but
only seems to send smb at around 300mbits.  strangely, it sends out
multiple streams at that speed just fine, but none are faster than
that even when streaming a single one all alone.

i have to admit i was not paid to improve this, just profile it.

   /usr/share/terminfo/r/ has entries for rxvt-unicode and
rxvt-unicode-256color.

   I thought someone suggested entries to /etc/termcap that I had put in
/etc/termcap-BSD, but I find no references to rxvt-unicode or urxvt in
either of those files.

   I've always used the '-ls' option for the virtual terminals. I think it's
a terminal issue, but I'll try anyone's suggestions to resolve the problem.

   No difference.

bash-4.1.007

   Chris, I assumed it was a terminal issue since rxvt, xterm, and other
terminals did not exhibit this behavior. When suggestions referencing the
shell were provided on the slackware mail list I tried them. So, I'm not
'worried' this is a shell issue. If I switch back to rxvt the line wrap
problem goes away. Same shell, same distribution, same everything, but no
UTF-8 support.

   All I have in ~/.Xdefaults related to rxvt and urxvt are:

rvxt*loginShell:true 
URxvt.font: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--20-200-75-75-c-100-iso10646-1
URxvt.boldFont: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--20-200-75-75-c-100-iso10646-1
urxvt*loginShell: true

you didn't send me 'infocmp rxvt-unicode' output.  that is what i am
most interested to compare to my own.

I thought this was to be a civil discussion.  And helpful. It seems to me
that one could do better on both counts.

Wouldn't your setup work a lot better if you use one router, instead of two?
 Use your wired router, then configure your WRT54G to act as an access
point, instead of a router.  Also, You can unplug the power from the acess
point when your not using it, if you want.  This is what I do at home & it
works very well for my family & I.

Cheers,

Elcaset

I discovered that the program is in Canonical's Launchpad repository. I 
posted a question there yesterday and received a response from the 
developer this morning:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your question #175667 on Transcribe changed:
https://answers.launchpad.net/transcribe/+question/175667

     Status: Open =>  Answered

Frederik Elwert proposed the following answer:
Oh, that is probably a missing dependency. Please try to install the
package "gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad", that should fix the issue.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That solved that problem.

Thanks to all for all your ideas on where to hunt for the solution.

I know that I tried to do this when I originally set it up, but there
was some really important, now forgotten, reason for not setting it up
as an access point. My dim recollection is that there was a problem
with the WRT54G. I recall calling Limksys/Cisco and their tech support
people had me update the firmware, but we couldn't get it to work as an
access point.

This entire thread would not have been necessary if I had placed a
sticker on the WRT54G at the time of setting it up with its IP address
and some clues as to how it was set up. Lesson learned.

   During my efforts to either get urxvt to properly wrap lines, or finding
another terminal emulator that supports UTF-8, the window color
specification on the command line to launch a terminal became torqued. I'm
not able to find the one color I used that is comfortable to view; I come
close using on-line html color charts but it's not quite right. Is there a
way to identify the hex code for the window color?

As mentioned in the thread on a program that wouldn't start I got around 
the problem by getting the program Transcribe to work (it was missing a 
gstreamer package). The footpedal program also installed without a 
hitch. I remembered to add the footpedal.rules file and it worked the 
first time I tried to use it.

Thanks to all for all the ideas that helped me through this. Much

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu live disk hangs shortly after loading
Message-ID: <4EA338CB.20605@comcast.net>

My wife decided she'd like to know more about the hardware on her 
machine without opening up the box. So we booted the Ubuntu 10.04 live 
CD in try it out mode. I successfully ran lshw -html and saved the 
output to the Ubuntu desktop. I then tried mounting her hard drive so I 
could put a copy of the html file there. The machine hung. I rebooted, 
ran lshw, and tried logging into my Comcast e-mail account through 
Firefox. I got as far as the Comcast page before logging in and the 
machine hung. I tried once more, this time trying to mount a drive on 
one of my running machines. My wife's machine hung. All we wanted was 
the model number of the mother board, which I wrote down during one of 
the attempts.

Her machine booted back up in XP with no problems.

Any ideas what would cause Ubuntu to hang in such a simple situation?

"This entire thread would not have been necessary if I had placed a

So, if you reset the wrt54g, then it should reset ALL of its settings back
to how it was when it was new in the box.  This should clear up all of your
issues.

Here's the first thing I found that works:

  xrandr --prop | grep current

I am sure there are other ways.

Not knocking the command line but another way with Ubuntu is to click on 
System > Preferences > Monitors. That brings up a window titled Monitor 
Preferences. The Resolution drop down box shows the list of 
possibilities. I assume they are for the monitor because they don't 
include the either the minimum or the maximum shown by xrandr for my 
machine.

Good..

Shows the same thing as the command line for me..

If I  understand the given information I am at max resolution for my
monitor  1600 X 900

Thanks for the info..

Another option...

Many (most?) monitors will tell you what resolution they are currently
displaying... it can usually be found somewhere in the menus/settings -
often prominently displayed on the main menu. It often will tell you what
the "default/preferred/optimal" resolution for the monitor is as well (for
best results, you should use that resolution - especially on LDC's).

Anyway... depending on your monitor, YMMV - but I always like the monitor as
a resolution info source because it is not  _directly_  connected to what
your operating system reports for the resolution (of course, it SHOULD be
the same, although I've run across a situation or two in the past where the
two sources disagreed... although I don't remember what the cause was, or
how I reconciled it... and it may have been a Windows thing).

I think the GUI reports its options based on a combination of what the
graphics chip can do and the EDID report from the monitor. If it
doesn't have information from either one it defaults to offering
VGA or some standard safe resolutions and settings. 

Perhaps xrandr does this as well. I have used xrandr, but I am less
familiar with it than the GUI. I have never found a discrepancy between
what xrandr reports and what the GUI reports, but that's just my
experience with a limited number of monitors and graphics chips.

Message-ID: <4EA59796.4020704@comcast.net>

For the last couple of days some of the web sites I go to have been 
downloading very slowly -- especially if any images are involved. I'm 
experiencing the same thing on both my laptop and my desktop machine, 
both running Ubuntu 10.04. Right now I'm downloading the nVidia non-free 
driver. It's been working on it for 15 minutes and, at 9:51 it is just 
under 1/2 finished.

What's the right way to look into where the hold up is?

Message-ID: <4EA59B84.4030402@comcast.net>

The driver download/install finished moments after I sent the post
regarding slow downloads. The next thing it required was a restart of
the machine. When I restarted the machine there was a blank screen
followed by a largish underscore cursor about an inch and a quarter down
from the top of the monitor followed by a normal sized cursor at the top
of the monitor. The Ubuntu dots appeared, then a login prompt flashed
by, the screen went blank and then the monitor reported no signal.

It appears that the built-in video is bypassed when the nVidia card is
installed in the PCIe slot.

Any thoughts on what to do next? I could remove the nVidia card and get
the built-in video back, but then what?


Thanks.

I can boot with the Ubuntu install CD and run it in try mode. That lets
me mount the hard drive, but I have no clue what file I would tinker
with to "uninstall" the non-working driver.

The install probably runs the nvidia config utility, which recreates the
/etc/X11/xorg.conf file. It should have saved the original, if there was
one. So check that first.

If there was one before, you check the differences. If there wasn't, you
can safely rename the new one to get it out of the way. The current X server
will run pretty well without any xorg.conf file.

Alas, there is no xorg.conf file in /etc/X11.

I was able to look at /var/log/messages. I extracted the lines that have
"nVidia" in them. Do they show anything useful?

Subject: [PLUG] open source IP hard phones?
Message-ID: <20111024234429.GA26599@gate.kl-ic.com>

I want an open source IP hard phone.

The furniture is moved.  I'm back to working on Asterisk.
The problem is the handsets, which seem to be designed to
block information, to follow the script that the phone 
designer had in mind, rather than permit behavioral creativity.

A kind fellow loaned/gave me some Cisco 7940G phones.  I've
been pouring through the docs - how do you program them???
Not configure, not choosing among options, but instead,
changing the responses and display and softkey behavior?  

For example, controlling the response to button presses.
I'd like the option of the phone sending IP messages to
Asterisk rather than making voice channel beeps, or
navigating some preprogrammed response chain in the phone. 

How do I put what *I* want on the little screen?

Basically, I want the configurability of a soft phone in
a classic pushbutton hard phone case.  With protected
voice channel hardware, no dropped sound while the CPU
updates the screen.  I would expect the phone to come
with default behavior, an API, and a built-in programming
language or an external cross-compiler which I could use
to evolve the behavior.

Does anybody make such a thing?   Otherwise, I may end up
buying some multiline POTs phones to plug into analog FXS
ports on the Asterisk server, simply to avoid complicated
but unproductive handset behavior like the Cisco.  Shudder.

HI

Try this speed test and see how that goes.


http://speedtest.net/

This worked well for me.  Reported just what speeds I am paying for..

Do you have a both computers connected to same point?  Can  you plug in
directly for a test to see if it is that.  Or recycle the power on the

On my laptop:
Ping = 34 ms
Download Speed = 1.17 Mbps
Upload Speed = 3.69 Mbps

Several minutes later on my desktop machine:
Ping = 21 ms
Download Speed = 0.23 Mbps
Upload Speed = 3.68 Mbps

Yes. I have them running through a Netgear RT-314 router that I've had 
for years.

I'll try that tomorrow (Tuesday) morning.

And that, too.

If those don't change anything I'll be in touch with Comcast and see 
what they see.

Thanks for the link.

I decided not to wait.

I plugged my laptop into the cable modem and tried again.

Ping = 18 ms
Download = 19 Mbps
Upload = 3.xx Mbps (I didn't write that one down)


>> Or recycle the power on the router/switch...???

Power cycled the router and got:

Laptop
Ping = 31 ms
Download = 7.04 Mbps
Upload = 3.69 Mbps

Desktop
Ping = 18 ms
Download = 7.13 Mbps
Upload = 3.7 Mbps

Sounds like the good old reliable Netgear router -- which I've had since 
the days of @home -- needs to be retired. I've got a couple of 
WRT-whats-its in the closet. Must be time to get one out and fire it up.

Thanks again for the pointer.

As I recall, the RT314 needed to be rebooted on occasion due to buffer overflow.

Interesting. I hadn't heard that. I have rebooted it on a number of 
occasions but I always thought it was for some "unknown" reason.

This morning, from my desktop machine:

Ping = 18 ms
Download = 9.29 Mbps
Upload = 3.64 Mbps

More tests, then I go digging in the closet for the WRTs.

Last night, without the router, I got a download speed of 19 something. 
The nice lady at Comcast was impressed and said I was paying for 12. How 
much loss should there be going through a router and a switch?

If I may jump in, another data point.
One of the reasons for the disparity in download speeds between direct
connection to cable modem, and through the router, could be due to the
router not supporting DOCSIS 3.0 standard, which your cable modem very
likely does support now (or very likely must support, to attain those speeds
and maintain communication upstream)

I would say try with one of your other routers, but my suspicion is you
would get similar results, unless the other routers are newer and support
DOCSIS 3.0.  If not, it may be time for a shopping trip.

Sumpin thought up by one of them speed demon whipper-snappers, I'll 
betcha. Why back in my day we had to carry our bits if buckets, uphill, 
both ways, and we liked it!

Thanks. I don't know the age of my WRTs, but when I dig them out of the 
closet I'll look at their specs. As you say it might be time for a trip 
to the Inter-shopping-mart.

Thanks for the two cents.

DOCSIS is the protocol used to signal data over the coax wire between the
cable modem and the other end at the cable provider's equipment. The router
should not have any relation to it at all. If it does, please elaborate on
how.

Assuming:

--[cable modem]----[router/switch]----[end computers]

and that the cable modem is translating the DOCSIS 3.0 to ethernet, why would the router need to support DOCSIS 3.0?

That is logical and could be accurate.
I do not have first hand knowledge of this, I am not a cable subscriber
myself.  My boss for my secondary job, which is tech support, suggested that
during an issue where a customer had a similar problem, that the router
being too old might be causing problems.  The customer replaced the router
and it worked better- granted that does not necessarily mean the DOCSIS
incompatibility was the issue, but he said it was related.  It could have
also been an all-in-one cable modem + router type of situation, in which
case replacing the "router" would also replace the modem, thus upgrading to
one that supported DOCSIS 3.0.

But it does tend to fit the data, when plugged in directly to cable modem he
gets 19MBs, when through the router he gets around 9MBs- in any case trying
the WRT routers should help narrow this down.

Hm.  Most of the hardphones I worked with were somewhat flexible.  But I
was working with Aastra and Snom phones.  I think they were sending SIP
messages for the button presses.  But they really are programmable
terminals, each one different, with programmability confined within the
bounds that the vendor chose.  A lot like the "Smart terminals" of yore.

I suspect that the Ciscos are designed to act a lot like your standard
office desk phone, with a few dedicated-function keys for transfer/redial
etc. and a few "line" keys.  Rule #1 of successful office IT: make it shiny
and new, but DON'T CHANGE A THING. :)

So get your "transfer" key working and give 'em voicemail and "hold", and
hold off on the improvements.  I know that you know how important it is to
do a first-class job for this particular client.

DOCSIS is all on the cable infrastructure and the cable CPE device.
Beyond that, it's all ethernet. Your router doesn't need to know squat
about DOCSIS.

Routing requires a little CPU to look at each packet, modify it,
figure out which direction it should go and send it on its merry way.
The slowness probably has more to do with the routers CPU, often a
200MHz or slower MIPS core, than anything else.  

Consumer grade routers like this are often incapable of maintaining
wirespeed.  Manufacturers could get away with this because upstream
bandwidth has been pretty limited, and in the case of wireless, the
wireless layer was much slower than wired speeds.  With 802.11n,
that's becoming less true.  Newer routers have been tending to use
faster CPUs.  You don't notice it so much on your local network
because for local traffic your packets are hitting a relatively fast
switch chip and don't have to ever talk to the underpowered CPU.

Subject: [PLUG] Any comments on SLAX?
Message-ID: <4EA7549F.8050307@pcnetinc.com>

On a language related forum I asked for recommendation of a 
small distro that would be attractive to users of that 
forum. Slackware was one recommended, though I'd hardly call 
it small ;/ A Google search then gave SLAX as being 
Slackware based.

I find the idea of only downloading the modules you will 
actually use attractive. It claims to be easily installed on 
a USB stick and has dialers for analog modems, two absolute 
requirements for me. I haven't yet assembled a list of 
modules to download so I don't know how large my initial 
download will be. It should be significantly smaller than 
Debian or Ubuntu which are the two top contenders for 
functionality {I'll not down load an office suite nor a 
browser I wouldn't use - just two annoying features of 
popular distros).

Any SLAX users with comments/suggestions?

Thank you

   Slackware can be as thin as you want. When you install it you can select
the packages to install. It supports older hardware well, too.

Richard,
Unfortunately, the Slax distro is no longer maintained.
http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=slax

But, the good news is that Porteus GNU/Linux takes over where Slax left
off.  I have used the 32-bit version of Porteus.  It's small, extremely
fast, works quite well, is much easier to use than Slackware proper & I
enjoy it.  Like Slax, it is meant to be used live, not installed.

http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=porteus

Well, to paraphrase "Bard upon Avon":
   To acquire thinly or install thinly, THAT is the question.
   {I've got a English professor groaning very loudly ;}

I was irritated by the excessive size of Debian/Ubuntu Live 
Distros at ~1 600+ MB CD. store.slackware.com shows 
Slackware as a *6 CD* set.

Now I have to admit that if I went the Debian and/or Ubuntu 
route, I might ask how much of the respective repositories 
would be available on CD. I *AM* on dial-up :)

THAT was the attraction of SLAX - the _apparent_ opportunity 
to ONLY download what I would use. Having just spent ~1 hour 
browsing the SLAX website, I'm not so certain of that reality.

Not a SLAX user per se, but I have had the opportunity to mess around
with Puppy Linux. Puppy is another breed of Linux that claims to be
small and modular, last time I checked the ISO was around 100MB and
came with some bare necessities. It supports persistent settings and
storage as well, which is a nice plus. Give it a go if you don't find
SLAX to be to your tastes!

I was given 2 Cisco Analog Telephone Adapters.  There are both model
186/188.  I'm wondering what I can use them for, & if they use SIP?
I'll either be using them in a simple setup here at home, or I'll donate
them to Free Geek Seattle for their phone system.  I am one of the main
people starting Free Geek Seattle.

Thanks very much

Yes, but Porteus is still maintained, & it is IMHO, a great distro.

Speaking of Unity/GNOME 3,  don't forget that KDE 4 is much faster than
GNOME 3 (with or without Unity).  From what I've seen, most people (myself
included) find KDE 4 to be more intuitive & user friendly than Unity.

Will there be any Kubuntu representation at the Ubuntu release party?  I
live near Seattle, so I won't be able to make it there to promote KDE
myself.

I maintain dozens of distro ISOs on my laptop hard drive, mostly so
that I will have them handy at the Clinic. These include Slax,
ArchLinux, DSL, Fedora, Knoppix, Mint, OpenSuse, Puppy, Slackware, all
the Ubuntus, and several rescue and utility CDs. At the moment I am
adding the latest Ubuntus, but I also just added Porteus because of the
comments here.

I have pretty good bandwidth at home - a 700 MB file takes about five
minutes if the server behind it has enough bandwidth. So if anyone
needs a CD and doesn't have the bandwidth to get it easily, let me know
and I'll download and burn it for you.

I have used Gnome all my Linux life, originally on Ubuntu and now on
Fedora. I have KDE installed, but every time I try it I find it not to
my taste. However, Fedora 15 came out with Gnome 3, and from what I
have seen on the live CD I am not going to like it at all. I am still
running Fedora 14 so as not to have to deal with Gnome 3, but soon I
will be semi-forced to upgrade, as Fedora only supports the current and
one release back, and Fedora 16 will be coming out soon.

I am planning on spending some time in KDE to see if I can tweak it to
my liking. Hint: I hate icons and I want my desktop utterly clear, not
even wallpaper.

I was there, but I don't recall much mention of Kubuntu. I did get a
cool Oneiric Ocelot t-shirt, though. In fact, I think there were some
t-shirts left over. And I got an official regular Ubuntu CD.

And, like most everyone else, I had to look up 'oneiric.' Shuttleworth
seems to be stretching these days. :)

But it does not seem to have some essential modules, 
gnuplot, SeaMonkey, Scilab/Scioslab, etc. Can the SLAX 
modules be used?

Puppy, Damn Small Linux, et. al.
They are small but lacking tools I want.
SLAX _seemed_ to have the ideal combo of very small base 
package, but ability to add whatever I needed/wanted with 
negligible fuss/bother.

YES, I want everything ;/

I'm the opposite.  I've used KDE forever, even on redhat/fedora/RHEL/CentOS
distros, where the default was always gnome.  For a while I'd try gnome
after each upgrade, but always find something that I couldn't configure to
my liking and switch back to KDE.

Then came KDE4, with lots of bells and whistles.  I managed, with the help
of google, to remove the icons from my desktop.  But I couldn't get rid of
these little translucent nutty cashew thingies, and if I accidentally
clicked on one then odd things would happen.  And I could no longer
configure the keyboard the way I wanted.  In KDE!

So I bailed.  Back to gnome, but only until I'd installed lxde on the box.
Now I'm a happy camper again.

Can the SLAX modules be used with Porteus?  I don't know. Best to contact
someone through the Porteus website to find out.

Another possibility for your purposes is this customized version of Kubuntu
10.04.  It comes with Trinity Desktop Environment (forked from KDE 3.5).  It
is so fast you won't believe it, has the best repos you can imagine, & is
still supported for another year & a half.

I love KDE3 & KDE4, & icons don't bother me.  I've tried many different
Desktop Environments & Window Managers since 1999.  KDE is the one that
works well & makes sense to me.  Of course, there are plenty of other people
who feel the same way.  I run into them daily, online.

Cheers,
Elcaset

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1110260733020.16903@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I want to bring my Web site in-house and add proftp for data exchange with
clients. I have 24G available on the /opt partition and want to set up a
chroot jail there for MySQL, a second copy of httpd (if necessary), and
proftp.

   I'll install MySQL just for the CMS Made Simple Web site. My accounting
application and other databases are hosted on postgres, but CMSMS and most
other Web tools are developed exclusively for MySQL.

   What do I read to start learning how to do this? All advice, suggestions,
and explicit directions are, of course, welcome.

TIA,

Rich

Google sez Cisco sez they're SIP.
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cata/186_188/2_15/english/administration/guide/sip/SIP88CH1.html

You can use them to attach analog phones (e.g. yer typical cordless phone,
or even a FAX machine) to an Asterisk server or a VoIP service (such as
CallCentric.)

If you have a cellphone and don't make or receive international calls from
home much, you probably don't have much use for one.

Note the international angle: immigrants with internet at home would be
well served by someone with ATAs or hardphones and some VoIP knowledge.
Currently, they use cheezy calling cards and by-the-minute cellphones.

The fact that you can get local numbers in major cities around the world
means that their families could call them back cheaply, too.

A chroot jail is a good idea for proftp or vsftp.  Consider allowing only
FTPS for authenticated connections, and only anonymous mode for regular
FTP.  Plain FTP leaks logins and passwords.

Jailing MySQL and/or Apache would be a bigger challenge, since they depend
on a lot of libraries.  Folks who want to go to that much trouble usually
use something heavier, like LXC (Linux Containers) or full virtualization.
The quality of documentation and difficulty depend on your distro--I
forgot what you usually run.

Short term, you might want to set up CMSMS, Apache and MySQL on a separate
box or VM, with a new OS install, just for practice and to get up and
running.

Aaron,

   It would be used only occasionally, but I'm thinking anonymous mode would
work because there would be nothing stored permanently there and in a chroot
jail access is limited.

   I run Slackware. I bought a Jetway atom-based system (physically tiny) for
this purpose but have struggled with whare to put it and the time to keep
everything secure. Most likely, once it's up and running I can put away the
second monitor and keyboard and manage it from my main server/workstation.
I'll put Slackware-13.37/64-bit on the drive. Then I'll need to dig back
into the network docs so I can put that box on a separate subnet and still
access it from the other subnet.

Thanks,

Rich

A great place to get answers is to join the live audience for the weekly
VOIP Users Conference taping (fridays at 9am to about 11).  The first
hour is devoted to the guest of the week, but the second hour is a
general discussion.  The people there have collective decades of
consumer and commercial deployments.

And you can join in via VOIP or Skype. :)

Summary:
* You need TFTP and DHCP servers to load firmware and configs on the phones.
* The dedicated buttons can be made to work with Asterisk.
* There is an XML browser system for defining custom menus and services.

If you had any extra phones, and if I had a few evenings to spare, I'd
totally get into playing with these.  It looks like there's a lot of
potential there, and I've often wanted to work on an Asterisk-based
replacement for the (horrible and very expensive) Cisco Call Manager.

Aaron gets his PLUG membership revoked for not remembering that Rich 
runs Slackware. He only mentions it three or four times a week! :-)

Did you check brother.com support site? Just last week I found Linux drivers 
there for a different model. They had an *extensive* collection of drivers in 
both RPM and DEB packages.

The only complicating factor is they don't have native Cups drivers. Instead 
they have LPR drivers and Cups wrappers. It worked fine for me though, right 
out of the box.

Yes I did. I see that they have both a cupswrapper and a LPR driver in 
both debian and it's derivatives and Red Hat and derivatives in .rpm. I 
am using Slackware and can convert .rpms to Slackware's tgz format with 
rpm2tgz. Do I install both drivers, or just one. Do the drivers work 
through CUPS somehow??

Yes you need to install both, and yes it works through cups.

I installed from RPMs. The cupswrapper package configured and restarted the 
cups service.

As part of the automatic configuration the install script set up a new printer 
assuming a local USB connection, which unfortunately was incorrect in my case. 
I'm using the WLAN interface for my printer. So I had to use the printer admin 
tool to delete the USB printer and add a network printer.

Message-ID: <8662ja7rtp.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I was helping someone recently deal with a HP flatbed scanner,
scanning from Ubuntu.  The problem is, the scans come out too light,
not saturated.  E.g., if you print out the image from the scan, there
is a noticable and quite obvious washed outedness.

I don't have the model number, but the fading is evident both from
SimpleScan and through XSane.  Anybody see that before?  Know how to
fix?

The contrast and saturation sliders don't resolve the problem?

I am using "auto" for that stuff, which seems to work fine on my Epson
scanner at home.

Is there a calibration routine?  My HP slide/print scanner has such using a

Thanks for the information.  I use lots of second hand equipment and
the number of sources for this seems to be going down as new low end
equipment becomes so cheap.  Still, I think it is more environmentally
friendly to use recycled equipment and sort of COOL as well.  I will
definitely check this guys out.

David Mandel

P.S.  I love my 1990 Dodge Caravan.  Only has 250,000 miles on it.
Should be good for another couple hundred thousand; although it seems
to require a new transmission every 100,000 miles or so.

It is an HP G3010 scanner.  I twiddled knobs today, I was not getting
a faithful image.  The blacks came through with a blue-ish tint.
Googling implied that I needed an ICC or ICM file.  Google has been
less successful in finding me one.

I wonder if Little Color Management System would be of any use here. I
have it installed, but I have never used it. It is FOSS and my
understanding is that manufacturers of many scanners, monitors and
printers have incorporated it into their devices. Desktop publishers
(excluding me) need to make sure the color they see on the monitor is
what will come out of the laser printer or printing press. LCMS is a
system to calibrate the various devices. I have no idea how it works.

How?
I installed cupswrapperHL2240D-2.0.4 and hl2240dlpr-2.1.1-1.i386. When I 
add a printer in CUPS and browse for a driver, the HL2240D is not on the

Well, I don't know what to tell you. Something in the packaging may not be 
Slackware friendly despite the best efforts of rpm2tgz. It's been something 
like 15 years since I've even installed Slackware so I'm a little out of date 
on that distro.

For my model of Brother most of the files ended up under 
/usr/local/Brother/Printer (an odd location to be sure, for any distro) and a 
PPD file was created in /etc/cups/ppd. You should poke around in /etc/cups and 
see what's there. Pay particular attention to any files that were modified 
around the same time you installed the packages.

Have you considered setting it up as a generic PCL6 or PCL5e printer?  You
could probably use a PPD for a duplexing LaserJet model (e.g. 5D).

Subject: [PLUG] Best GIMP Resource / Corel Draw equivalent
Message-ID: <1319820715.1739.62.camel@servo>

These are two questions, but they're both about graphics programs:

First: 

I've been using GIMP, gradually getting better at retouching photos with
it and such, but I am nowhere near being able to do the sort of things I
see as example GIMP work.

What's your best recommendation for a good book or online reference for
thoroughly learning GIMP?

Second:

My understanding is that GIMP is a pixel-based program, and that things
like Corel Draw are vector based.  I have CAD programs (LibreCad is
pretty good), and those are, indeed, vector based, but they're for
making mechanical drawings -- not for making pretty logos and decals and
whatnot.

So -- is there a good "make it pretty" sort of vector-based graphics
program that's freely available?

Thanks.

Tim,

   My book is probably well out of date. Check reviews on amazon.com.

   Yes, the GIMP is bit-mapped/raster/pixel-based. Last I counted (a while
ago) there were at least 17 vector-based graphics applications for linux. If
you want a GUI then Sketch or Xfig will do a nice job. If you're willing to
put in the time to learn it, PSTricks is outstanding
<http://www.tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi/>. Look at the examples and you'll see
just what complete control you have over text, lines, etc. And Herbert Voss
is exceptionally helpful. I've used PSTricks to create a scannable form,
plot data, and more.

   There's also gnuplot and graphviz but they're more for data than pretty
pictures of the artistic variety.

Inkscape is one of the best pieces of open-source software I've used.
It's similar to Adobe Illustrator (which, I think, is similar to Corel
Draw).

I use it extensively for diagrams and UI Mockups in proposals and
papers -- Inkscape use svg natively, which works reasonably well with
revision control, and you can run the rasterizer headless, so it's
easy to convert svgs to high-resolution pngs for a LaTeX document in
the document's build script.

Not only had I not considered it, I wasn't even aware such a possibility 
existed. I chose a HP driver with a d suffix,
usr/share/cups/model/HP/hp-laserjet_p2015d_series-hpijs.ppd.gz, and it 
prints, even duplex.

Thank you very much. I was about ready to take the thing back. Maybe I 
should anyway. The damn thing only has a "starter" toner. What crap!

When I asked the salesman if there was another printer that had a real 
sized toner like my old hl-1440,  he said that that is the way they all 
come these days. Well, probably a class-action law suit in the offing 
for some lawyers to make a bundle.

I don't know how good it is, but I have a copy of Beginning Gimp: From
Novice to Professional by Akkana Peck, published by Apress (ISBN
1-59059-587-4). I got it for free a couple of years ago at Oscon. I have
referred to it only a couple of times because I use the Gimp only a few
times a year - most of my stuff is vector based. Since I am not using
it, you are more than welcome to it. Better it get used than sit on my
shelf gathering dust.

You are correct. The Gimp is a raster image editor. Illustrator,
CorelDRAW and Inkscape are examples of vector graphics editors. Havin
said that, all three vector editors that I mentioned can import a
raster image, although they cannot edit it. This is handy if you want
to place text or other vector objects on top of a photograph, for
example. 

Some versions of Illustrator will run in Wine. Ditto for CorelDRAW. And
a long time ago Corel Corporation specifically sold a version of
CorelDRAW for Linux, also made to run under Wine. Somewhere around the
house I have a copy. But it's not only old, it was (as I recall) buggy
beyond belief. And these days Inkscape is better anyway.

Inkscape is what you want.

   It's an excellent book. It was recommended to me by Carla Schroeder, a
friend of Akkana's. It's a bit dated but continues to be a good enough
reference for me.

Snicker. And not only that I'm on dial-up except for trips

I once asked about a Linux users group and was referred here.

won't send anything to the DVI monitor. I'll get another DVI -> VGA
adapter and get both monitors working that way.

I tried two monitors with my laptop and find that it is quite handy. I'm
glad the nVidia card has two ports. Weird that it doesn't work through
DVI cables, though.

Thanks Aaron, & everyone else, for the info.  I do make calls to Canada on a
regular basis.  Also, I spend a lot of time on an old-style corded phone
with domestic calls from home (way too much time for daytime cell phone
minutes).  So, if I could make these cisco ATAs work with a free service
like Skype (not SIP), or something like Ekiga (which is SIP, but doesn't
work well), that would be great for me.  Also, once or if I'm convinced that
Ooma  works well, I will buy that.

 Anybody here familiar with Ooma?

I switched from Vonage to Ooma this year. Never had any issues with 
Vonage, but with Ooma I have occasionally had audio quality issues, and 
even dropped calls. Not fun when I work from home most days and am 
dropping from a conference call.

About a month ago I was considering going back to Vonage, but things 
have been stable since then, so I'm willing to take the risk until I run 
into problems again.

Scott,
Thanks for the feedback.  Ooma's service sounds like it's better quality
than mobile phone service, so I can live with that.  Especially since Ooma's
monthly charge is extremely low.

How expensive and difficult is it to add several phones in the same house to
one Ooma line?

Cheers,
Elcaset

I'm not familiar with callcentric.  I'll have to check it out.  Although,
it's hard to compete with Ooma's monthly rate.

Yep, which is why I really would prefer to stick with them if I can. My 
cost comes to $3.47/mo now.

If you have a cordless phone setup with several handsets, you can plug 
your base station into the Ooma and have as many handsets as you want. 
That would be the simplest approach.

Well, I do have a 3 handset cordless phone that would work on that, but I
prefer to spend most of my phone time on a corded phone.  I bet there's a
way to fool Ooma into thinking several phones are one phone by lining
together all of the phones via couplers & long phone cords.  If I can do
that, that would be great!

Gah! I want to quit using Comcast for my landline. But when I call them to check out pricing, I find that my cable bill will go UP if I discontinue telephone service. 

What a racket!

Yes, that's the same situation I'm in.  Except that I'm in Kirkland, near
Seattle.  That's how we get screwed when Comcast "bundles" things.  However,
once I get a voip setup to my family's liking, I'm getting rid of Comcast
altogether.  We are looking for an ISP,  & telly service provider, as well.
I'm happy to just use free over-the-air digital telly with antennas, but the
rest of the family is hooked on certain "cable" channels.

We used Vonage for years and years, but the quality and reliability got 
really bad so I switched to Comcast VOIP. They use a separate dedicated 
network, and it's best voice service I've ever had.

We've had & continue to have a lot of Comcast service outages where we lose
internet, telly, & phone.  The internet goes out most often, then comes the
telly, then the phone service.  When we call Comcast about it, they act as
if that's normal, & want to charge us extra to come fix it!

I have been lurking on this list for more than a year (not posting

beer available here.  I believe that at least one of the members of 
this crowd also lurked in this forum from Melbourne, Australia 
before moving to Portland.  What is it about the appeal of Portland?

So, a bit of a reach this group has, eh?

A very long time ago I had a Laserjet 4MV, which came with Postscript,
but no PPD file. I used the PPD file for a Linotronic 300 and it worked
fine. The Linotronic PPD file offered features that I couldn't use, but
it was otherwise perfectly functional. My point is that if you need a
PPD file, just find one for the most similar printer and it will work.

For that matter, a PPD file is just a plain text file, usually only a
couple pages long. You can just roll your own. I have not created my
own PPD file, but once I had to edit one, and it was trivial. That is,
it is trivial once you figure out the syntax. And even that is usually
pretty simple. For example, suppose your printer can do 600 dpi or 1200
dpi, but the PPD file only offers 600 dpi. You open the PPD file and
find a line that says (I am making this up) "DPI=600." So you add a
space plus "1200" at the end and try it. If it doesn't work, add a
comma. Or get several PPD files and open them up to see how they are
written. And once you have a good PPD file for the HL2240D, upload it
to the CUPS folks so that everyone can share.

   It rains a lot. Great microbrew pubs. Within an hour's drive one can be at
the Pacific coast, well into the Cascade Mountains, in the high desert, and
(of course!) there's the magnificent Columbia River Gorge and its
leaf-clearing east winds.

> So, a bit of a reach this group has, eh?

   What I've read from others is the broad and diverse expertise of list
subscribers and the willingness of those with answers or advice to provide
them makes this group unique. Perhaps it's the combination of location (in
the silicon temperate rain forest), friendly and helpful culture, and
support/advocacy of F/OSS that keeps us from being insular and isolated.

   Join in more frequently. I'm sure you have contributions that are
worthwhile.

Same as any other VOIP line.

Use the existing house wiring AFTER disconnecting from the external
telephone network at the NID:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_device
http://www.homephonewiring.com/nid.html

Open the NID (regular screwdriver required) and unplug what look like
short phone cord loopback cables plugged into "TEST" jacks. This
isolates your inside wiring from the phone company.

Plug the Ooma / Vonage box into any telephone jack near an internet
feed, hook it up to the internet, plug in the power adapter and there
ya go, at least in theory.

I've had Ooma since Woot ran a special six months ago. Over this time
it has worked fairly well, at least as well as the Comcast cable modem
service. I think I've only had to power cycle the Ooma box once or
twice when it wasn't a Comcast issue. The taxes-only minimum service
is missing a couple things I really miss but not enough to upgrade to
the $120/year Premier service. The thing I miss most is voicemail
email forwarding.

Thanks Neal, very good to hear Ooma is working well for ya.  I think I'm
going to switch us to Ooma.   Also, that info you sent on using the house
phone wiring should come in very handy.

Cheers,
Elcaset

Dude!  Can you suggest a good spot for our Advanced Topics meeting?
Beer selection was one of our prime criteria!  And I am sure you have
much better public transportation there. ;-)

There are some pretty good web based resources for learning gimp, 
starting with the gimp tutorials at http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/

As far as vector based drawing programs, inkscape is by far the best for 
"making pretty logos and decals", etc.

Interesting, though they have used a Broadcom SoC which makes me
nervous.  Broadcom has a bit of a history of being unhelpful with
information on the details of how their parts work.

There are a number of folks working on the Yocto Project which are eager 
to develop a BSP for this device as soon as they become widely available.

Subject: [PLUG] Dual head sees both, displays one
Message-ID: <4EAF1CD4.5080903@comcast.net>

More on my video saga.

I now have DVI to VGA adapters for my nVidia Quadro 285 video card. I 
have the "current version" nVidia driver installed. I have a ViewSonic 
BG2030wm monitor attached to the number 1 connector on the card's 
dongle, and a SamSun SyncMaster 712n attached to the number 2 connector.

Using the NVIDIA X Server Settings tool I can see that the driver sees 
both monitors and knows their model numbers and standard resolutions. 
But only the ViewSonic monitor has anything displayed on it.

When first powered up the second display was disabled. I changed it to 
"Separate X screen" and restarted X. No change. I changed it to 
"TwinView" and restarted X. No change.

Is there something else I should know about to get both screens working?

Thanks.

Reseat all cables/cards? I use to have RAM that would block POST every so often.

Hah! This is great! I just got a call from my cousin, Kent Lunneborg, about this same dead machine. And I was going to post the same question to this list, too.

There should be two green leds on each power supply.
Both green leds should be lit on each power supply to indicate
each cordset is connected.

You could try turning the key off and back on, but having a serial
console connected would give you the best indication of what the
problem is when you do turn the key.

If it's still not trying, Unplug both power supplies and let the caps discharge. Then, with the serial connection working on a terminal, (19200, 8, n, 1, I believe) try to power up. If that doesn't work, and it still doesn't power up, I've had a bad eeprom do the same, but it could be a number of things at that point.
