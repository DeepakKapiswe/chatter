Not a bad system.  You'd be surprised at how easy and cheap it is to
replace a screen.  No spam intended, but you can check laptopscreen.com for
an idea of what screen you'd need, what it might cost and how it's done.

Interesting site. Looks like the going rate is between about $70 and $90 
for a replacement screen. Might be a reasonable thing to do one of these 
days. Thanks for the link.

Message-ID: <alpine.OSX.2.00.1309031106390.387@springwater.galois.com>

One of the neatest command-line tools in OS X is pbcopy (aka 
Pasteboard Copy), which allows you to pipe stuff into the copy/paste 
buffer. Its output counterpart is pbpaste.

So pbcopy allows you do to cool stuff like

   grep thisfile.txt | awk '{neat operation}' | pbcopy

Then you can paste it anywhere.

In alpine (the only-barely maintained successor to pine, the CLI 
e-mail client), you can enable pipe commands. Usually you do that to 
modify the contents of your message, e.g., piping it to tr for ROT13 
encoding.

I receive a lot of system e-mail messages, and occasionally I have to 
put copies of them into trouble-tickets, wiki pages, or whatever. So 
from within alpine (on OS X), I call the message for reading, then

  | pbcopy

Then I paste a away, without ever having to lift a mouse or save the 
mssage to the filesystem.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1309031132230.22291@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I would like to find where the cursor (mouse, trackball) color is
controlled for various applications. This is not the position cursor such as
the point position in emacs, alpine, or lyx which indicates where the next
keystroke will be displayed, but the position of the mouse or trackball
cursor which is a very thin "I" beam.

   My alpine window is configured as white text on a black background (high
contrast but easier on my eyes than black text on a bright white
background), and the trackball cursor is white which makes it easy to
locate.

   When I write using LyX the page background is a pale beige and the thin
black trackball cursor is easily lost among the black text. I cannot find a
LyX configuration color for this pointing-device position.

   In firefox the cursor is a black arrow on a white background so it's easy
to see there.

   Is there a generic location that sets mouse/trackball position cursor
based on the application's background color? I tried looking for 'gtkconfig'
but did not find it and I don't think it's applicable for all applications
in any case.

'xclip' on Linux (and presumably other Unix-like systems) works
similarly.  It combines both setting and getting into one command,
though.  From the README:

    Copy your uptime into the selection for pasting:
    uptime | xclip
    
    Copy your password file for pasting:
    xclip /etc/passwd
    
    Save some text you have Edit | Copied in a web browser:
    xclip -o -sel clip > webpage.txt
    
    Open a URL selected in an email client
    mozilla `xclip -o`
    
    Copy XA_PRIMARY to XA_CLIPBOARD
    xclip -o | xclip -sel clip

Tools like these are very handy for CLI junkies living in a GUI world.

   Thanks, Paul! As was explained to me more than 15 years ago, linux tools
are quite simple and easy to understand. The problem is that there are
thousands of tools. And us non-professionals don't even know what to seek in
the tool universe.

Virtual Private Networks

Our illustrious IPv6 authority will give a talk on popular Virtual
Private Network options, including:

1) standard IPSec clients - require static IP at each endpoint, and are
supported out of the box by Windows, Cisco IOS, Mac, and Unix using
raccoon and similar programs.

2) Modified IPSec VPN clients - example is the Cisco IPSec VPN client.
This is a proprietary modification used to allow one end to have a
dynamic IP number.

3) SSL VPN clients. Cisco has one they call AnyConnect that is
proprietary. OpenVPN is another example.

4) PPTP. This was supposed to have died years ago but since Microsoft
ships the PPTP client with Windows it is still very useful is situations
where the network admin is forced to provide VPN services to clients
that she has no control over.

5) L2TP. This is what PPTP morphed into, Microsoft supports it natively,
so it has the same benefits (to the network admin) as PPTP plus the
Microsoft implementation allows for encryption using IPSec with
certificates.

In light of today's revelations, quite topical!

Maybe the talk should be renamed "virtually-private networks" or maybe
"not-so-private virtual networks" ;-)

I would not be trusting any binary-blob vendor to be keeping my bits
private at this point.

While I don't doubt that the NSA has a large budget and a supercomputer
farm to match, I still think that properly-implemented, peer-reviewed,
open-source and strong cryptography algorithms are still out of their
reach. The problem, as I've read about before is a large amount of open
source software that blindly applies AES without a good understanding of
cryptography creating weak solutions like cryptoloop and tinc. Properly
implemented solutions like dm-crypt and OpenVPN may also use AES, but
are implemented properly and should keep away the prying eyes of the
government for another few years. Maybe what we need is a place to find
detailed information of the quality of various open source solutions as
reviewed by well-known cryptographers.

Thanks. My feeling on all this is that it's like the walls of our
bedroom collapsed to reveal that we've spent the last 20 years in a TV

   I've read the U. Del. web page on procmail, and a couple of others,
without finding a definitive answer whether a recipe can start with FROM_
rather than TO_.

   Almost all entried in my recipes.rc file are used to sort mail list
messages to their proper mbox file. But, there are a couple of individuals
whose incoming mail I want to direct to a file in ~/mail/. I use the FROM_
keyword but all the messages are placed in the default INBOX.

   Is there a way to have procmail use FROM_ rather than TO_ or SUBJECT_?

You can use any header you want to in your recipes. For example, I use
the List-Id header in filtering email from PLUG as it's much more
reliable than using To and CC.

That places all PLUG email into the PLUG mail subfolder of the ML
folder. More information on recipes can be found in the procmailrc man
page with the procmailex man page showing various examples of recipes.

   Thanks, Loren. I'll look again at the man page to figure out why I'm
having problems with two recipes and not all of them.

Is LOGFILE defined in your .procmailrc? Something like:
  LOGFILE=$MAILDIR/pmlog-`/bin/date +%Y-%m`

It should contain some clues.

Michael,

   I turned on logging at the highest verbosity level. What I now see in the
log is:

procmail: Locking "PERSONAL.lock"
procmail: Assigning "LASTFOLDER=PERSONAL"
procmail: Opening "PERSONAL"
procmail: Acquiring kernel-lock
procmail: Error while writing to "PERSONAL"
procmail: Truncated file to former size
procmail: Unlocking "PERSONAL.lock"
procmail: Match on "(^((Original-)?(Resent-)?(To|Cc|Bcc)|(X-Envelope|Apparently(-Resent)?)-To):(.*[^-a-zA-Z0-9_.])?).*RSHEPARD at TWODOGS\.US"
procmail: Locking "PERSONAL.lock"
procmail: Assigning "LASTFOLDER=PERSONAL"
procmail: Opening "PERSONAL"
procmail: Acquiring kernel-lock
procmail: Error while writing to "PERSONAL"
procmail: Truncated file to former size
procmail: Unlocking "PERSONAL.lock"

   Permissions on ~/mail/PERSONAL are 644, the same as for other files that
have no errors. The procmail man page suggests that the disk might be full
(there's 117G available) or the pipe died. Why might the pipe die on only
that one file? Where else might I find the error?

Thanks,

Rich

What kind of mailbox are you using? Meaning are the other files, files or directories?

In that case, please humor us with 
    an `ls -l ` of the directory with the mbox files 
    enough context lines of .procmailrc to see the rule for this mbox and one that works

   These recipes originally did not escape the dot. When I saw someone's
recipes on a Web forum that used them I decided to try them to see if they
make a difference. They don't. Same results with or without the backslash.

   Aha! I never found this in my Web searches.

   I've created a bunch of topic-specific files in ~/mail to reduce the size
of the PERSONAL file. Now I know to raise the file limit in postfix if I
need to store a lot of messages.

Subject: [PLUG] sending data from single serial port to multiple readers
Message-ID: <522E4A02.3010305@seitzassoc.com>

Hi,

I have a need to allow multiple network connections to a single serial 
port.  Data from the serial port needs to be sent to *all* network 
clients, and each network client needs to write to the serial port.  Is 
there a way to achieve this using command line tools, or do you think I 
will end up having to write my own code?

Both conserver and gpsd have functionality similar to what I'm looking 
for, but they are both overkill for my needs.  I'm hoping I can find 
something that will require less hacking.

Ultimately this needs to run on an embedded system running OpenWrt, so 
I'm uncertain as to whether a high level scripting(Perl/Python) solution 
is viable.

Thanks for any suggestions you can provide.

netcat would be useful for that. Busybox comes with an implementation
of netcat so I think it could work on openwrt.

I should have mentioned that I already tried socat(netcat on steroids). 
  Here's the command I started with:

socat tcp-l:9001,reuseaddr,fork /dev/ttyUSB0,raw,echo=0,crnl

This is close to what I want, but the data from the serial port is not 
sent to all readers.  I'm not sure, but I think there is a single file 
descriptor associated with the serial data, so it's a first reader wins 
situation, where the first reader is unpredictable.  I sent a message to 
the socat developer asking for hints on how to accomplish my particular 
multiple reader situation, but I have yet to hear back.

Possibly you could use a multicast address
http://stevehaskew.blogspot.com/2012/08/playing-with-multicast.html

Or a message queue
http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all
http://www.jnbagale.com/blog/2011/12/19/porting-zeromq-to-openwrt/

But this is getting a bit beyond a command line solution.

Instead of the fork command you can use ncat that is part of the nmap
distribution
http://nmap.org/ncat/guide/ncat-usage.html

As the page above says:
"With --keep-open (or -k for short), the server receives everything
sent by any of its clients, and anything the server sends is sent to
all of them."

which is exactly what is needed.

Combine that with  the socat command to send and receive data from the
serial port

and you get:

ncat --listen --keep-open localhost 9212 --sh-exec "socat -
/dev/ttyUSB0,raw,echo=0,crnl"

Every client that connects to localhost 9212 will be able to send
things to the serial port and anything from the serial port will go
out to every client that is connected to localhost 9212.

I did not test it with a serial port, but did test it  like this

from one terminal
ncat --listen --keep-open localhost 9300

from a second terminal
ncat --listen --keep-open localhost 9212 --sh-exec "socat - TCP:localhost:9300"

from a third and fourth terminal
ncat localhost 9212

Now anything typed into the third and fourth terminals appears in
terminal one and anything typed in terminal one goes out to terminals
three and four.

Good eye!  Thanks for spotting this!  I read over the ncat docs but I 
missed that.  I naively assumed that -k worked the same as socat.

This didn't work for me.  The serial data out was not written to all 
client connections.  However, the following does seem to work.

stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 cs8 -cstopb -parenb 57600 crtscts etc.
ncat --listen --keep-open localhost 9001 < /dev/ttyUSB0 > /dev/ttyUSB0


Thanks again for your help!

OK, so all the other kids are bringing apples to their teacher at
school.  Really - how many MacOSX machines can a teacher use?

Think differenter.  Send your child (or someone else's child,
if you forgot to have one) to school with the gift of Linux.
Bring your computer to the Clinic Sunday afternoon 1 to 5 pm,
at Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th, and we will upgrade it to Linux, 
chock full of the free,  open source goodness that impresses
teachers and other students alike.  

We will have distros, screens, keyboards and mice, coffee, and
munchies.  Free Geek is upgrading their network, but assures us
that wired and wireless internet will be available.

Your child will become an A student.  If not from their teacher,
from using their new software and network skills to correct 
grading mistakes in the school's poorly-secured database.  Give
your child the tools they need to get into Harvard, Yale, or
Stanford - with their own poorly-secured admissions and financial
aid databases.  See http://xkcd.com/327/ 

See you Sunday!

Message-ID: <CAJo8XLL_xouBstyXhJV_OXk6C1GUryt9FjLuh6aCs5CF2T=dfA@mail.gmail.com>

Good afternoon to the list,

My name is Tyrell, and I just moved to Portland from Reno, NV a couple of
weeks ago; I'm still trying to settle in, finding jobs and a home and such.
 In Reno, I went to UNR for Geography, but that school didn't offer much in
the way of what I was looking for (Geographic Information Systems), and so
I came up here on the hope of getting residency and then getting into the
GIS program at PSU.

While GIS is largely dominated by the Windows-only ArcGIS suite, server and
networking technologies largely surround the use of infrastructure based on
Linux and Unix, and I can't imagine it being a BAD thing trying to build up
some IT experience before finishing school and entering the job force in my
"Real" field of study.  Further, I have been using Linux as my primary
operating system for the better part of a decade, and wouldn't mind
expanding my knowledge of it, even if just as a hobby.  Most of my
experience is in Fedora, but I have dabbled in Debian/Ubuntu, FreeBSD, and
Mac OS lightly here and there; I would LIKE to think that I'm fairly decent
at system administration, but I'm a far cry from the gurus I'm used to
seeing in the Reno Linux User group, and I'm equally certain that people on
this list can show up many of the people in Reno...

I would love to expand my knowledge in general, and maybe get a job as a
result.

SO, here's the question:  RHCSA is a $400 test; RHCE is another $400.  Is
it worth it? And with CompTIA A+, those, and my experience building my own
systems, how difficult is it to get a Linux job in these parts?

Thank you all for your help

I have not heard of certification coming up and like to think that
Portland companies are more... intuitive than that, but I won't knock
certification as a member of the BSD Certification Group. In tech-weak
climates, it can definitely set you apart and helps show initiative for
those who are right out of school and face the chicken and egg,
experience required/haven't worked yet scenario.

You do realize, Keith, that this appears to be condoning a class C felony in the state of Oregon*?

I understand the intent, but there are others that won't, and I'd hate to perpetuate the idea that linux users are criminals.

I agree: Just good humor; I mean, one must always remember the audience:
While this is far from a private group, and it shouldn't be, the audience
can still be safely assumed to be a bunch of Linux users and professionals
who understand the irony of the statement.

It's a sad day when a satire gets interpreted as an endorsement or
perpetuation of a crime...  And while I have seen some ridiculous things in
the news about courts upholding claims that posting a URL to a page that
may contain pirated data as being a crime in and of itself, I can't imagine
a day when we have to stop having fun out of fear of someone committing a
crime based on a joke...

Personally, I do too. I'm all for humor, light, dark, polite, impolite, etc. But there is a publicly accessible, google searchable archive of every message in the list. I think it's likely that someone, somewhere, will see it, and not take it the way Keith intended. 

If I'm over reacting, I apologize. I know Keith is a very intelligent person, and no slight was intended toward anyone.

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu 12.04 gvfsd -- bug?
Message-ID: <5234DEA2.4090200@dicksteffens.com>

It took several minutes to move five photos from my SD card in a USB 
adapter to a folder on my system. Also, the disk access light is 
blinking rapidly. Top says that 45% of the CPU is being used by 
gvfsd-metada. A bit of Googling indicates this is because gvfsd (Gnome 
Virtual File System daemon) is spending a lot of time working on things. 
Back in 2007 someone had a similar problem:

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1421580

> It looks like your metadata store is got corrupted, leading to an 
> infinite loop in the code.

> FIX:
> The fix here is to remove the metadata storage, located in:

I tried that the other day. Indeed the disk access light settled down to 
normal. But I have the same issue today.

More Googling turned up:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gvfs/+bug/951585

A search of current bugs took me to:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gvfs/+bugs?orderby=-importance&memo=300&start=300

where I found that it is "Undecided" and "Confirmed" but that's from 
last year. Doesn't look like it is getting any attention.

Any recommendations on getting around this, other than periodic deleting 
of the file gvfs-metadata? One of the side effects of that is that the 
arrangement of things on my desktop changed to something that I assume 
is a default layout. While annoying, that's something I could live with. 
The extreme delay getting files moved from this machine to other 
machines, or devices is more than annoying, though, and I would like a 
way around that.

I'm playing around with eproject, which assumes erroneously that

for the life of me I can't figure out how to install or enable it.
I've searched all .el files on my (ubuntu) system.  Googling isn't

Subject: [PLUG] Trackball ball movement not smooth
Message-ID: <523C89CC.9010906@dicksteffens.com>

I decided to try out a trackball a friend gave me. It was pretty dirty, 
so I cleaned the ball and the socket with isopropyl alcohol. Before 
cleaning the cursor response to the movement of the ball was jerky. Now 
the cursor response is smooth, but the ball movement in the socket is 
sticky. It's like I had cleaned some kind of lubricant off of it -- I'm 
guessing that the ball is not lubricated, since that would likely get on 
one's fingers -- but that's what it feels like.

Any recommendations on how to get the ball to rotate smoothly in the socket?

I've never had a trackball, but I'm assuming (oh that word) that it's
rather like an old-fashioned ball-type mouse, only upside down.  If
so, there should be two orthagonal rollers.  Since you've cleaned the
socket out, there shouldn't be any lint or hair or whatever to foul
things up.  At a guess, you cleaned off some sort of lube from the
roller pins.  A touch of lube at each end of the pins should do the
trick.  I think it should, anyway.  Be sure that you don't get any
lube on the interrupters, or your cursor will skip around most
unpleasantly.

BTW, alcohol isn't the best thing to use on those hard rubber rollers.
Some rubber conditioner, like that for magnetic tape capstan rollers,
would be much better.

Anyway, I hope this helps.

Dick,

   I've used only trackballs for more than a dozen years. Now and then they
become less responsive so I know they need a cleaning. I blow and pick out
whatever is visible, usually dust bunnies. Sometimes I need to use splinter
forceps to pick the lint off the sensing points in the base or from crevices
in the unit. I never use alcohol or any other liquid.

   Take out the ball and rub it with a microfiber cloth or lint-free towel.
There are no lubricants on trackballs; it's plastic against plastic and
usually as low speeds. You can wash and thoroughly dry the ball if you wish;
it's solid plastic so it will not be harmed by the water. That removes
finger grease and snack residue quite well.

Hard to say what the "dirt" on this thing was, but it was all stuff that 
was stuck to the plastic. No loose debris. It was free, and I was in 
need of an extra "mouse" so I thought I'd give it a try. I think I'll 
stick with mice and pick up a couple the next time I'm down at Free Geek.

Most made in recent time have been optical.  Usually a laser against a ball
and the ball just floats on little bits of plastic.  If yours is mechanical
it could be quite old.

Subject: [PLUG] MythTV Testing - HDTV choppy
Message-ID: <523CDDCD.60606@dicksteffens.com>

I'm testing Mythbuntu on an Toshiba Satellite laptop. Everything 
installs and runs. I have a simple dipole antenna connected to an 
HDHomeRun box connected to my home network. I can see a number of local 
channels. Those sending a non-HD signal are clear. Those sending an HD 
signal are slightly choppy. I'm guessing this is related to system 
memory, but wanted to get other opinions.

The Satellite is a model L45-S7423. It has I dual-core 1.46Ghz Pentium, 
and 1GB RAM (two 512 modules). I can upgrade to 2GB of RAM for under 
$25. But I wonder if RAM is the issue, or if processor speed is the 
issue. In the long run, this won't be the box I'd run Myth on 
eventually, so it may not be worth the expense -- especially since this 
is the laptop I mentioned a couple of weeks ago with the damaged screen. 
But it is working as a test bed for me to get to know Myth.

Opinions are welcome.

How are you viewing this?  Via mythtv's 'live tv' feature, or are you 
viewing a recording?
...
OK, I see that your laptop has an Intel GMA X3100.  This may be the 
problem.  I'm not sure whether this video hardware is capable of hw 
decode of HD, at least with the drivers available for Linux.  You may 
have better luck with software decoding, but that too may be a problem, 
as the T2310 in your laptop may not be up to the task either.  You can 
try adjusting the quality of the decode in order to reduce the burden on 
your hardware.

This might be useful:

I highly doubt that your problem is due to lack of memory.

Live TV. I haven't tried recording anything yet. Today was the first 
time I had an opportunity to finish configuring MythTV to the point 
where I could watch something with it. Previously I ran HDHomeRun Config 
GUI and watched a couple of stations via VLC Media Player. Same 
choppiness there, too, and also with the demo movie clips in MythTV 
setup. The silly bird was fine, but the character trekking through snow 
in the mountains was slightly choppy. Note, that the choppiness is not 
terrible, but it is noticeable.

Next time I have some free time I'll try setting it up to record 
something and see what I get.

That's good to know. Like I said, I'm not sure it makes sense to spend 
too much on this particular laptop. It does, however, give me the 
opportunity to get to know MythTV from an operational perspective.

Thanks for your comments.

Hey all,

I have a Linux question!

I am looking for the grub-emu info (not man!) page referenced in the man
page:

http://manned.org/grub-emu/9e965fe3


"The  full  documentation  for grub-emu is maintained as a Texinfo
manual. If the info and grub-emu programs are properly installed  at
your  site, the command

    info grub-emu

should give you access to the complete manual."


Could someone please shoot me a copy of this info page or a link to it?

Thanks!

Michael

What's your CPU utilization? Seems like that will tell you if your CPU
has enough oomph or not.

Hope I haven't missed that detail earlier in the thread.

Streaming 1080i/p HD video performance will depend on
1. GPU
2. CPU/memory
3. Hard drive speed
4. network speed
5. DTV Antenna

1 and 2 should be ok on your laptop with newer linux kernels.  I have
a Free Geek Intel box running Slackware64 + XBMC 12.2 (kernel 3.2.45)
that uses the Intel Q965 chipset (GMA 3000). This GPU is a slightly
older desktop version of yours.  My CPU is Intel Core 2 duo 1.86GHz
E6300.

Funny story: 1080p HD worked ok but we noticed a few days ago (via
htop)that someone at Free Geek had disabled the 2nd core in the BIOS.
Might be something to check.

3. Your lappy is sporting a 5400 rpm SATA-150 hard drive. That could
make 1080p video a bit choppy.  Even streaming, IIRC, data gets
buffered to the hard drive.  A proper 7200 rpm SATA 2 or 3 desktop
drive will do better.

4. Network: Ive had issues streaming 1080p over wifi due to
interference and odd chipset support. It can work but takes some
tweaking of the routers, etc. Linux support for some wifi chipsets is
gimpy (broadcom).  A good Cat5 or Cat6 cable with a gigabit NIC is the
way to go (if 100 Mbps, you may need to tweak network kernel params a
bit). It you must use wifi, go with Atheros chips - far fewer packets
lost and better connections.  Look into adjusting TCP/IP parameters in
/etc/sysctl.conf (esp. TCP buffer sizes).

5. I built my own DTV antenna for grins:
http://cdn.makezine.com/make/television/04/DTV_Antenna_FINAL.pdf
I used scraps: some leftover 18 gauge Cu wire and a piece of cork
flooring. I get excellent 1080i reception of PDX stations from
Vancouver at ground level.
Another site: http://www.tvantennaplans.com/

For 1-3, a good way to test the laptop - or the real box later -
download these 1080p videos and then play them via MythTV.

I'm surprised you get such good reception. That's a UHF antenna, and 3 of the 
Portland stations are VHF (8, 10 and 12).

Ah, that's the beauty of this simple design: it can pull in all PDX DTV
channels just fine.  Its great that I built this with leftover scrap
building material in the garage!  A spiffier design is Gray-Hoverman:
http://www.digitalhome.ca/ota/superantenna/design.htm

There are several other designs.  One is a better fractal design that I
plan to try. Here is an example using Al foil on clear plastic:
http://www.htpc-diy.com/2012/04/diy-flexible-fractal-window-hdtv.html

You can increase the number of elements and the Koch curve iterations:
http://makezine.com/2012/01/30/diy-fractal-antenna-for-digital-tv/

"Signal strength" also depends on your DTV tuner.  I suspect that some
(most?) HDTV manufacturers are skimping figuring that most people just
plug into one of the HDMI jacks.  Since 99% of DTV is in the UHF, I
wouldn't be surprised if some DTV tuners skip proper VHF support.

(Note: Anyone that has a high quality roof top VHF/UHF antenna from the
old analog days already has a dang good DTV antenna.  The only reason I
bothered to build one is because the last TV antenna I had was 20+ years
ago!)

But I digress (rainy Saturday!). Yes, this simple design is plenty good
enough in PDX.  If you need more frequency response, replace the bow tie
elements with Koch fractals.

I don't see any mention of grub-emu in the grub main (man/info) page.

It is a special userspace version for a few specific uses.

Feel free to grill your distro for "grub-emu"

Thanks,

I found a list of files in Debian's grub-emu package.  Unfortunately,
as you can see here

    <http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/amd64/grub-emu/filelist>

there does not seem to be a .info file, just the man page.  Fedora
does not support grub-emu at all.  I presume that Red Hat doesn't
either.

I suspect that you're going to have to download the grub2 sources
and compile them yourself, which will generate the doc files.
That's assuming that the grub-emu.info page actually exists, which
it may not.  My google-fu came up blank (i.e., zero pages) several
times.  Another thing you could try is emailing the GNU folks a
line asking about grub-emu.  If anyone could tell you where to get
the info page, they could.  Also, GNU supports a number of IRC
channels on freenode, including #grub and #gnu.  That might be
faster than emailing them.

Anyway, sorry I couldn't help more.  Best of luck to you.

Indeed, very little turns up but this list is very helpful. The sources
only suggested there is one main C file for it.

Thank you,

Hi

I am having printer problems.

Printer was out of ink..

Replaced cartridge.

Printer did not print.

Replaced bad cartridge  Printer complained empty cartridge and wouldn't
print.

Put in anther new cartridge.

Printer won't print..

Model  HP OfficeJet 4620..  Had been working fine.

I use second source ink cartridges.

Any ideas on what I am overlooking?

I rebooted the printer..

The ink level indicator says it is full of  ink..

The test page prints the color things at the top but no text.

TIA

Marvin,

   Does this printer use a separate print head? If so, it might be clogged
and needs to be replaced. Otherwise, there might be an issue with non-HP
cartridge or load. Cartridge World might be able to advise you.

   I gave up my inkjet printer and use only laserjets (one monochrome, one
color).

All HP inkjets have the print head in the cartridge. I've never been a fan of 3rd party cartridges - fine if they work but not worth the overall hassle. If you get nothing out of the cartridge then it's either bad or you have a bad electrical connection (e g not snapped in all the way).

Get a proper HP cartridge to test!

Rich, I agree, laser is the way to go for "bang for yer buck" and reliability. Toners last longer than ink cartridges. I just use inkjet on photopaper since the  colors are a bit better.

   I don't know how much color printing you do, nor what type (plots and
diagrams vs. digital camera images) but these two factors should guide your

visit The Printer Place on Powell Blvd. about SE 17th Ave.

Very good folks there. I bought my color HP LaserJet on craigslist for only
$50 (and a trip to Washougal and back). Turns out it needed a new drum which
The Printer Place diagnosed and fixed for $130 so I have the equivalent of a
like-new printer for a reasonable cost, and I'm still on the set of
cartridges that came with it. When I need new ones I'll go to Cartridge
World; I've been using their toner cartridges for my LJ 5 for years with no
problems at all.

Happy printing,

Rich

Richard..

The only printing I do is Black and White small text files.

Powell and 17th is a long Haul for me.  I live in La Center.

I am scared to buy off Craigslist.   Too much bad luck with electronics
from  that list.

Thanks

Marvin

Marvin,

   Black and white laser printers are quite inexpensive. I bought a Brothers
on sale at Office Depot for $50 a few years ago (and since sold it). Watch
the office supply stores (or amazon.com) and you can replace the inkjet with
an inexpensive, single-purpose laser printer most of which are supported by
CUPS.

To the KPLUG community:

I got "invalid data" warnings for all the March dates on the shell
script file, but changing the time to 03:00:00 fixed this problem.  Is
something wrong with the tzfile or ???

The problem occurred on my Ubuntu machine when checking daylight
savings time EPOCH values for the years 2010 to 2015.

I am curious to see if this occurs on other machines?

Just tried your script, got the same problem.  I tried subtracting one
day from all the March dates and everything worked.

Those March days are all Daylight Saving Time switchover days, aren't
they?  (If they're not, I'm going to look really stupid...)  There is
no 2:00AM hour on those days, thus the dates really are invalid.

And this is one reason a lot of sysadmins don't use daylight saving time (summer time elsewhere) and/or always use UTC for the times our computers run.

Dale is correct here in that they really aren't valid dates due to the
daylight savings change.  To compound the problem, dates between 01:00:00
and 01:59:59 are ambiguous if you don't specify a timezone.

date -d "Nov 7 01:59:59 2010" +%s # => 1289120399 (in PDT)
date -d "Nov 7 02:00:00 2010" +%s # => 1289124000 (in PST, +3601 epoc
seconds)

date -d "Nov 7 01:00:00 2010 PDT" +%s # => 1289116800
date -d "Nov 7 01:00:00 2010 PST" +%s # => 1289120400 (+3600 epoc seconds)


Working backwards from seconds since epoc (which is in UTC)...

date -d @1268560799 # => Sun Mar 14 01:59:59 PST 2010
date -d @1268560800 # => Sun Mar 14 03:00:00 PDT 2010 (+1 epoc second)

date -d @1289120399 # => Sun Nov  7 01:59:59 PDT 2010
date -d @1289120400 # => Sun Nov  7 01:00:00 PST 2010 (+1 epoc second)

I have a side project that deals with historic time data over multiple
timezones, and its tricky to say the least, even with libraries to do
the heavy lifting. Its kind of a notoriously tricky area where naive
solutions can go very wrong. It's an interesting subject. Further
reading  below if anyone is interested, I would particularly recommend A
literary appreciation of the Olson/Zoneinfo/tz database.

Paul M

Further Reading:
===========================================================

(from the python timezone library documentation)
In cases where countries change their timezone definitions, cases like
the end-of-daylight-savings-time occur with no way of resolving the
ambiguity. For example, in 1915 Warsaw switched from Warsaw time to
Central European time. So at the stroke of midnight on August 5th 1915
the clocks were wound back 24 minutes creating an ambiguous time period
that cannot be specified without referring to the timezone abbreviation
or the actual UTC offset. In this case midnight happened twice, neither
time during a daylight savings time period

http://pytz.sourceforge.net/

(from the gnu manual on date and time)

First, a quote:

Our units of temporal measurement, from seconds on up to months, are so
complicated, asymmetrical and disjunctive so as to make coherent mental
reckoning in time all but impossible. Indeed, had some tyrannical god
contrived to enslave our minds to time, to make it all but impossible
for us to escape subjection to sodden routines and unpleasant surprises,
he could hardly have done better than handing down our present system.
It is like a set of trapezoidal building blocks, with no vertical or
horizontal surfaces, like a language in which the simplest thought
demands ornate constructions, useless particles and lengthy
circumlocutions. Unlike the more successful patterns of language and
science, which enable us to face experience boldly or at least
level-headedly, our system of temporal calculation silently and
persistently encourages our terror of time. ...

It is as though architects had to measure length in feet, width in
meters and height in ells; as though basic instruction manuals demanded
a knowledge of five different languages. It is no wonder then that we
often look into our own immediate past or future, last Tuesday or a week
from Sunday, with feelings of helpless confusion. ...

This is a great reason why everyone should switch over to Julian time

Message-ID: <20130927173052.C823F17F778@john>

I finally got around to "upgrading" the Ubuntu 10.04 LTS system that I use 
daily to the 12.04 LTS release. I've been putting it off because I knew that it 
would break everything user-interface related that I depended on. :-( And of 
course I wasn't disappointed. Or rather, I was. Whatever.

I got some of the gnome env back, and I'm struggling through the font problems. 
However all of my keybindings are toast and I still haven't figured out how to 
reconfigure them. The two biggest ones are navigating the virtual desktops and 
launching a terminal.

I don't see any way to do the latter anymore. And the compiz Settings Manager 
has settings for switching to specific viewports via keyboard or directional 
switching via mouse, neither of which I want! I want to navigate left/right/up/
down via keyboard. This was simple to do before I "upgraded".

Suggestion? FYI I'm not using Unity.

Did you install GNOME session fallback? In the Ubuntu Software Center 
it's called:

     GNOME Session Manager - GNOME fallback session
     gnome-session-fallback

I use that, and with it <ctl><alt>T gives me a terminal window.

Yes. That was implied when I said I got most of the gnome environment back, and 
that I wasn't using Unity. I suppose I could have done something else, though.

That may be. But it's awkward, and I have a different, much more natural and 
comfortable combination that I've used for years. I don't want to retrain my 
fingers. In the old system it was a simple matter to redefine the keys.

Now they're trying to make the settings interface look like a Mac, and IMHO 
have only screwed things up.

apt-get install  compizconfig-settings-manager will get you the old
setting manager
Then enable Desktop Wall (or rotate cube) -> bindings
(Ctrl+Alt + arrow is the default, I think, but I may have set that)

In Applications - System Tools - System Settings, in the Hardware group, 
is a button for Keyboard. That has a tab for Shotcuts. One of those 
shortcuts is Launch Terminal, with the default setting of Ctrl+Alt+T. 
Down at the bottom it says, "To edit a shortcut, click the row and hold 
down the new keys or press Backspace to clear."

I haven't tried changing anything in there, but that might be worth a 
try for your key combination.

Thanks. I don't know why I didn't see that. I must have looked at the System 
Settings window a dozen time. :-(

Maybe it's the grey-on-grey color scheme.... ;-)

I already had compizconfig-settings-manager installed, that's what I was using.

I tried Rotate Cube. Holy cow, that screwed things up. Pinned windows lost 
their positions, I suddenly couldn't access any of the virtual desktops. I 
tried to reset things back to the way they were, hopefully I succeeded.

I tried Desktop Wall instead. That works well enough (although I wish it would 
wrap.

When I logged out and back in it complained that there were updates pending 
that needed a reboot. Is it suddenly downloading and applying updates in the 
background?!? That's a no-no. Update Manager settings still shows "Display" 
only. Is there a different setting somewhere else?

Thats standard if a reboot is pending because of previously applied
updates (a kernel upgrade came down the line this morning).

Not as far as I know (on either question, there is unattended-upgrades
but that doesn't involve update-manager and needs to be installed
separately) .

Synaptic/dpkg shows that it got installed...
ii unattended-upgrades  0.76ubuntu1 automatic installation of security upgrades

This script is the backend for the APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade option.

Is there a way to configure it, or should I just uninstall it?

By default it just does security upgrades, without them it won't be
doing  much of anything but you can also exclude packages, so you might
want to keep security but remove kernels so you can control reboots.

Subject: [PLUG] Battery backup issue
Message-ID: <524914D6.80707@dicksteffens.com>

I have an APC Back-UPS ES 550 UPS. I have a Gateway E-4500D plugged into 
it along with a Samsung SyncMaster 712n and a SyncMaster 205nw. Up until 
Saturday I also had my Sony Vaio and another SyncMaster 712 and a pair 
of external speakers plugged into it. We had a power outage Saturday 
evening while I was working on the machines. (Because of the 
"improvements" made in Ubuntu 12.04 I need to run the Sony on 10.04 in 
order to be able to use my foot pedal and audio transcription playback 
software, but that's a different story.)

Anyway, when the power went out the Gateway immediately died. The Sony 
and the three monitors remained running until I went through a 
controlled shut down of the Sony. I can't put my hands on the test 
results I got using my Kill A Watt, but I recall that the power 
consumption for all that hardware was way under the 330 watts / 550 VA 
the APC unit is rated for. But, thinking there may be something more 
subtle going on I decided to move the Sony, its monitor, and the 
speakers from the battery plus surge protection side of the APC to just 
the surge protection side, since I don't create stuff on that machine, 
just play back files I download. That left only the the Gateway machine 
and its two monitors on the APC.

This afternoon, while working again, there was a power blip. The Sony 
survived the blip, but the Gateway rebooted. Later on there was another 
power blip, but this time both machines survived it. In all three cases 
I didn't lose anything thanks to my auto save setting in LibreOffice. It 
was just annoying to have to reboot, start up Thunderbird again, and 
send passwords to five different e-mail accounts. (Another story. Sigh.)

While looking on Amazon at another APC unit (so I'd have one for each 
machine) I found a comment that warned about some computer power 
supplies needing pure sine wave. The BackUPS ES 550 delivers stepped 
approximation to a sine wave. I'm hoping the Gateway is old enough that 
it isn't that sensitive, but I don't find anything that tells me either way.

Any thoughts on why the Gateway should not survive a power failure while 
plugged into a UPS? The indicator light on the APC is green. Red is 
supposed to indicate the need for a new battery. This unit isn't all 
that old, either, but again, I would have to dig to find the receipt, so 
I can't say if I bought it in 2012 or 2011, or maybe even earlier this year.

Two more annoyances ....

The panel at the bottom of the screen (WindowList) used to have an option to 
"auto-hide". It doesn't do that anymore, and it's taking up valuable screen 
real estate that I want back. I've checked every "configuration" and 
"preferences" screen I can find. Any suggestions on how to restore that feature?

Also, now whenever I happen to move a window to the top of the screen it 
automatically "maximizes" the window. Damnit, if I want Windows I'll run 
Windows. :-( I can't imagine on what planet this might be useful. How 
do I turn that off? If I want a window maximized I can do it myself.

Right click on the lower panel.  Click panel options/panel settings.  
Then click more settings.  That should open up a pane that gives 
visibility settings including auto-hide.

If I right-click on the lower panel I get a single choice: "Preferences". That 
opens a window with

  Window List Content
    o Show windows from currecnt workspace
    o Show windows from all workspaces

 Window Grouping
    o Never group windows
    o Group windows when space is limited
    o Always group windows

 Restoring Minimized Windows (disabled unless Show All is selected above)
    o Restore to current workspace
    o Restore to native workspace

That's it. No "panel options" or "panel settings". No "more settings" .

I don't use the same desktop as you, so my advice might be wrong. But
it seems to me that you clicked on one of the widgets (or applets, among
other names) that live in the panel, rather than clicking on the panel
itself . It can be tricky to find a spot on the panel that is not
occupied by a widget, but once you find one you should get the panel
options.

Or - better idea yet - drag the panel to the left (or right) of the
screen and make it wide enough to hold all the widgets that you want.
This will leave you with nothing at the top and bottom, giving you
maximum vertical real estate.

Or even better idea - install Xubuntu, and then move the panel to the
left or right.

Does the unplugged UPS provide enough power to start up the
machine?

That is probably an Offline/Standby UPS.  In normal conditions,
it feeds power straight from the wall to the load, bypassing
the charger and battery and inverter.  When the power goes
down, it twiddles its thumbs for a missing cycle or two, fires
up the inverter from the battery, throws a relay, and starts 
feeding the load, which has been without power for 30
milliseconds or more.  The better UPS units send a signal
over USB to the computer to signal "suspend NOW".

As you can imagine, a computer with a just-barely-adequate 
power supply, accustomed to a squirt of power 120 times a
second (plus and minus lobes of line frequency), might lose
hope and die during a very brief interruption of those 
squirts.  Inside the computer power supply are some
electrolytic capacitors which may have been full value when
the machine was new, but may have been cooked to weakness.

Same electrolytic problem for the UPS itself, which may also
have worn out batteries.  

And you may have added peripherals to the Gateway computer
that draw down the power faster.  A bigger third party 
power supply with larger internal capacitors might help.

The UPSs that Really Work are "online" UPSs.  Power from
the line charges the battery, battery power drives the
inverter continuously, which directly powers the computer. 
If the charger shuts down, the inverter and computer keep
running until wall power comes back or the battery is
exhausted.  If everything is functional, zero power
interruption.  Of course, online UPSs are more expensive.

Either the larger computer power supply, or the online
UPS, will make heat continuously that the offline UPS
and smaller computer power supply won't.  You can spend
Even More Money on high efficiency "green" power supplies
and UPS units.  There may even be computer power supplies
that connect to 370V batteries directly, supplementing
the electrolytics, which is more efficient still. 
This is what the big data centers are evolving to.

The power grid is becoming more unstable and less
reliable.  Utilities are strapped for cash and required
to absorb intermittent, unpredictable "green" energy.
And your neighbors are buying plug electric cars - when
their multikilowatt chargers turn on, the line power will
sag a little (or a lot, depending on charger design).

And if climate change expands the Hadley cell and moves
more tropical storms north, we will have more wind and
rain storms at 45N.  And we won't have as much glacial
melt to power hydro in the summer and fall.  So a good
offline UPS may be needed for the power grid of the future.

Encouraging versions of the Linux kernel that can recover
from instant power loss might be called for, too.  Spotty
power availability is the norm for most of the world, and
most future computer users.  We should help build software
for the precarious power world, and for our own future as
we reduce our own industrial capabilities.

That was it. I needed to <super><alt><right-click> on the panel (super = 
Windows key) and then I got the correct preferences screen.

Thanks.

I still need a way to disable this stupid auto-maximize every time I 
accidentally hit the top of the screen when moving a window. :-(

Well, in KDE you go to settings | Workspace Behaviour, click on "Screen Edges", and then uncheck the "Maximize windows by dragging them to the top of the screen" box.

I don't know how you'd do it in an inferior DE though.

Glad to help!

Found it. It's actually a Compiz setting under Window Management. Disabling 
"Grid" accomplishes what I want.
