Anybody seen this sort of thing before?

  dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/randfile bs=1024k count=5
  md5sum /tmp/randfile > /var/tmp/p1
  umount /tmp
  mount /tmp
  md5sum /tmp/randfile > /var/tmp/p2
  cat /var/tmp/p?

   0ba83cd02d0e182db2a551891a9ecaa9  /tmp/randfile

I can't quite figure out why some files change in subtle ways after 
remounting the drive.  At this point, I'm blaming the motherboard, 
power supply, or some other subtle issue.

I started in the installed OS with the drive on a promise pci card, got 
the same results with the on-board IDE, and again with a rescue CD, 
plus all of those scenarios with a different disk in the same box.  
Both drives work fine in a usb enclosure hung on a different machine.

What I can't figure out is why the other (root) drive gave me no trouble 
(though I didn't test that with the remounting, etc. and it's been up 
for the ~150 days since I installed it -- so maybe that drive didn't 
get unmounted enough times to suffer the bitrot?)

This is an old (200MHz NEC) box that's been through quite a lot.  I 
suppose it is time to hang it up and get something slightly younger and 
blonder from freegeek.

I'm guessing that your cut'n'paste truncated the beginning of p1, as
it's too short (in addition to being "wrong")... In any case, if your
drive is as old as the CPU I wouldn't be surprised to see behaviour
like that at this point, presuming you don't have a really old/buggy
driver/filesystem combination.  Sounds like a good confirmation that
there is a hardware problem, though I'd expect to see if without the
unmount... though your file/pagecache is probably just assuming sanity
until it's flushed out.

I'd be curious of you started out with a file of known (non-binary)
data and diff'd it in the same scenario.. maybe it's some cosmic
message ;)

Or maybe it's too late... too bad I'm not up in Portland, I've got a
lot of overpowered hardware sitting in my basement.

Think that might just be your font.  Try it in fixed-width.

No, fairly modern (40GB 7200rpm) drive.

Debian sarge (or was it etch?) maybe 6 months old in parts (kernel at 
least is that old) but I'm running mildly older stuff elsewhere and not 
seeing anything like this.

I also tried it with several syncs and saw no difference until after the 
remount.

Heh.  It seems like plaintext files maybe were not as affected.  The 
problem appeared when one of my subversion repositories started to 
bitrot.  Most of the others were working fine, but a few had trouble 
dumping (I guess some bits got twiddled in the older revs.)  I'll have 
to check my website for pictures of jesus tomorrow.

This is a very good explanation of SCSI vs SATA

http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Hardware/sata.html

It explained precisely why I had so many problems with SATA raids.
In short, If your data is less important and valuable than your hardware, 
then go with SATA. Otherwise SCSI rules!
Cheap men always pay twice, first when they get a "bargain", second 
when they deal with it.

Sometime in the past month or two I picked up a new
/etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo file via a yum update.  This file
was specifying port 81 in the mirrorlist URL.  Apparently they thought
this was a good idea, and then had second thoughts.  Anyway, there was
a window of time where an update might have picked up the port 81 version.
Today, if CentOS-Base.repo contains the port 81 version of the file, the
following error occurs:

$ yum list updates
Setting up repositories
Cannot find a valid baseurl for repo: update
Error: Cannot find a valid baseurl for repo: update

To fix the problem, just edit CentOS-Base.repo and remove ":81" from all
of the mirrorlist URLs.

Okay, now I see that I'm not subscribed to the appropriate mailing list.

I must not have done an update before they shut down port 81.

a sync() won't affect your read cache, which doesn't get deallocated
until (memory pressure|unmount|age) forces it out or something else
new in, so it's feasible that you had significant decay on-disk
immediately after writing but wouldn't "see" it until after that mount
cycling.  Try a smartctl -t long /dev/hd? on it, followed by a "-a"
and see if it reports any failure conditions, though I've seen a lot
of ATA drives that DON'T report critical stuff up through SMART (WD
mostly).

Let us know if you get any good ASCII art out of it ;)

I have a Dell 30" 2560x1600 attached to an eVGA 7800GT
(one dual-link DVI, one single-link DVI) and it is a joy to behold.

It is attached to a Supermicro dual-Opteron system running Debian unstable.
I am using the nVidia proprietary drivers vers 1.0.8178.
I had to tweak the xorg.conf a bit to include the 2560x1600 modes and to
explicitly set the DisplaySize (to get the font size to work better).

I also have a Dell 20" 1600x1200 next to it turned to portrait mode 
which makes it
the same "height" (physically, resolution, and DPI) as the 30".

I am happy with the 7800GT but, if buying the card today, I would go for 
the 7900GTX
so I had 2 dual-link DVI ports. (in case I win the lotto and want to 
have dual 30" :) )

Really obvious item, is /tmp tmpfs, in which case unmounting the
filesystem *does* make all the files disappear? Do you normally have a
different filesystem mounted there? (in which case umount would pull the
other filesystem out, and mount would bring in the normal FS)

Tried disabling DMA? Or using lower-speed DMA?

Ugh, that is way to close for comfort to one machine I've still got
operational (the only balancing factor is mine started as server-class).

Message-ID: <442F03D3.3000401@verizon.net>

I have been doing some limited reading about the various flavors of 
Linux.  In reading some short blurbs describing the differences, I see 
that Gentoo is highly recommended as a "compile from source" type of 
installation.

The book I am reading didn't include Slackware in the mix of "most 
popular".  I am under the impression that Slack is in the same style of  
"source" installation.

The questions are...how do the two differ, which is better for a P3 933 
dual processor with 1.5 gig of memory, and which would be better if a 
slower machine wasn't a consideration?

Thanks,

Bruce

Bruce,

   No. Slackware comes as packages with a .tgz extension. One uses the
packagetools (installpkg, upgradepkg, removepkg) to manipulate them. There's
also swaret and slack<something> that can be used to upgrade constantly from
the current version (which will be the next stable release).

   I've no idea which might be "better" for anything. I can tell you my
experiences, however.

   From 1997 (Red Hat 4.0 or .1, I forget which) through September 2003 (Red
Hat 7.3), that's all I used. Why? Because when I went to Powell's Tech Books
in early 1997, my choices were Red Hat, Slackware, and the other one with an
unpronounceable (and obviously forgettable) name and the clerk recommended
Red Hat just because they were selling more copies of that so it must have
been more popular.

   During this period I kept getting upgrade notices from the RH team, and
major upgrades were often a major PITA for me. Then, if I wanted to install
some productivity application (as distinct from a system or network
administration application), I frequently ended up in dependency hell.

   My research lead me to Slackware. It has less hand-holding than did Red
Hat, but it needs less, too. Once I made the transition from SysV-style init
scripts (used by RH and it's derivatives) to BSD-style init scripts, it was
a done deal. Other than security upgrades (which are quite infrequent), I
don't upgrade until Patrick Volkerding (who developed Slackware in 1994 and
still heads the team) send the next distribution to me (I'm on subscription so
it costs about $50 per year). It's rock stable (unless hardware goes), runs
everything I want or need, and just works in the background like a good OS
should.

   When I get an upgrade, it takes 15-30 minutes per machine (depending on
processor speed and the amount of memory). I telinit to single user, upgrade
the core packages, then tell it to upgrade everything I have on my system. A
new kernel is seamlessly installed, so I reboot back into runlevel 3 and off
I go again.

   Many folks use Slackware on servers and something else on the staff's
desktop. Patrick doesn't like Gnome, so he ships only KDE; he doesn't like
PostgreSQL, so he ships MySQL. He does ship Xfce. There is a great Web site,
http://www.linuxpackages.net, where I can get postgres, postfix, and almost
everything else I want or need as a Slack package.

   More importantly, when I build from a tarball of source code, after the
./configure and make steps, I run checkinstall and get a Slackware package
from that. I can install or upgrade that package and it's registered with all
the others in /var/log/packages.

   Everyone has a distribution that works for them. Mine is Slackware.

Personally,
I prefer Debian. I have had very little issues. I have recently 
installed Ubuntu (Breezy). It was built off of Debian. Both have run 
very well on my old piece-o-crud laptop. (Sony Vaio 700cpu, 128 RAM, 
wireless nic Cisco). I am not as *into* Ubuntu as I am Debian, so I will 
probably reinstall Debian soon.

      Inkscape is an Open Source vector graphics editor, with capabilities 
      similar to Illustrator, Freehand, CorelDraw, or Xara X using the  
      W3C standard Scalable Vector Graphics  (SVG) file format. 
      Supported SVG features include shapes, paths, text, markers, 
      clones, alpha blending, transforms, gradients, patterns, and  
      grouping. Inkscape also supports Creative Commons meta-data, 
      node editing, layers, complex path operations, bitmap tracing, 
      text-on-path, flowed text, direct XML editing, and more. It imports 
      formats such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and others and exports PNG as 
      well as multiple vector-based formats.

      Inkscape's main goal is to create a powerful and convenient drawing 
      tool fully compliant with XML, SVG, and CSS standards. We also aim 
      to maintain a thriving user and developer community by using open, 
      community-oriented development process, and by making sure Inkcape 
      is easy to learn, to use, and to extend.

   For Bruce's benefit, Slackware runs on everything, from 386s to IBM S/390s
(their new zClass mainframes). I use it on two 1999-vintage notebooks with no
problems.

I would above all recommend _not_ to try gentoo alone if you are 
interested in source distro's. There are a few other source distro's out 
there that are far more stable and easier to maintain and install that 
gentoo puts to shame (endless breakage? anyone?).

Try:

lunar-linux
sourcemage
rock linux
LFS (Linux From Scratch)
especially the first two are recommended above gentoo IMO

it isn't. You might want to get a better book

slackware will install in 30 minutes on a pII. Gentoo (with kde/gnome) 
will take you 3 days depending on the type of install you are thinking of.

At one company I worked at we wanted to have RAID-1 on several test systems 
that we had. The servers weren't super critical but it would be nice that 
they could stay up and no lose everything if a disk died. We looked at some 
of the cheaper SATA cards and they turned out to be some sort of funky 
hardware RAID just so we didn't bother with them.

7 months ago I put together a new workstation and got an LSI MegaRAID 150-4 
card which does real hardware RAID. I put a couple of Seagate NCQ SATA-150 
drives on the controller in a RAID-1 configuration. SuSE Linux detected the 
card out of the box and I didn't have to do anything really special to make 
it work with Linux. The only thing that must be done before the thing is 
useable is to go into the LSI setup program and create the logical disk 
volume.

I've been using nothing but SCSI for all of my systems since 1995 and so this 
last system I built to replace a dead workstation that didn't survive a move 
from Chicago is my first non-SCSI system in more than 10 years. I'm quite 
pleased with the system and Seagate SATA drives are much quieter than the 10K 
RPM  IBM Ultra-160 drives I had in my old workstation. I haven't done any 
speed comparisons or anything but the performance has been good enough for me 
so far. I didn't to any cost comparisons either but the OEM drive were $89.00 
a piece but I paid something like $235.00 for the LSI card so my solution 
wasn't exactly cheap since I spent over $400.00 just for the disk storage.

I'm still a hardware RAID SCSI bigot though if anyone wants me to build any 
kind of critical server systems for them though. :-D

One is a proven, well-known technology with a lot of options out there,
the other gives you a much better dollars-to-gigabytes ratio and maybe a
better future.  (Though SCSI has a *lot* of momentum.)

If it's gonna be handed off to another sysadmin, use SCSI.

For SATA, 3Ware then.  Though Linux MD RAID is consistently competitive
with hardware RAID, with no worries about weird UIs, proprietary formats
or quicky finding a replacement RAID card.

Last server I built ended up using SCSI because it was built into the
mobo, and we weren't buying enough storage for the savings to cover the
cost of the SATA card.

Actually, some SATA drives are consumer-quality short-warranty models,
and others are server-quality 5-year models.

The preliminary day's schedule for Linuxfest NW is on the BLUG site:

   http://blug.org/prelim-schedule.dxp

Note that most of the Portland people are scheduled across the 10 
o'clock time slot.  I would be too, but I really would like to see
George Dyson's talk.

Given that we have so many people from the Portland are presenting,
it might be could to schedule some practice sessions beforehand,
that locals can watch.  Does anyone want to help organize this,
and find us a room?  My living room is available, but I couldn't
get more than 10 people in it.  And the beer sucks...

With local speakers from Linuxfest, from OSCON, from Alternate
OSCON, and with an occasional Randal presentation, we can probably
keep the General and Advanced Topics schedules full for the rest
of the year!

Thanks for the pointers.  Linux From Scratch is one I had read about 
somewhere and will try it someday soon.

I will look at the others, too!

Rich,

You had previously convinced me to install Slack.  Your descriptions 
sold me some time back.  I was surprised that O'Reilly didn't include 
Slackware in his Desktop Pocket Reference.  As soon as some troublesome 
issues with older computers breaking down (another power supply failure) 
are resolved and I can have a computer the wife doesn't need to depend 
on...it will happen.

I was misinformed about Slack being installed from source.  Not an issue 
for me, just something I want to try.

Subject: [PLUG] IPv6 resolved
Message-ID: <442F687E.2050808@writemoore.net>

A week or two ago, Elliot had suggested that the newer kernels licked 
the IPv6 bug that has plagued me for the past few months.  I installed 
Debian Etch on the new machine a few days ago and found, alas, that 
despite it using a 2.6.15 kernel, I still had all the same connection 
flakiness and still couldn't get anywhere without disabling IPv6.

Today I installed Arch Linux, which also uses a 2.6.15 kernel, and 
wonder of wonders, everything works.  No more having to ping servers 
before I can download packages, no more disabling of anything.  So it 
looks like that the problem is with Debian (and Ubuntu, and probably 
other Debian derivatives), although someone else reported similar issues 
with (IIRC) SuSE.  Maybe a networking guru could figure out what it is 
some distros are doing to mess up the packet routing.  Or maybe there 
are just too few people it affects for anyone to fix it.

So it looks like I *finally* have a free and clear connection, and it 
looks like I've found a new distro, which -- connection bonuses aside -- 
I'm really liking  so far.

Keith,

   Over the past quarter-century I have been subjected to very few well-done
presentations. Most are appallingly bad. For some reason, teaching how to
present an effective talk is not part of the educational or professional
training of lawywers, engineers, scientists, or ... computer geeks.

   In the mid-1970s Rosemary MacKay, Professor of Zoology at the University of
Toronto, gave a presention on how to give a presentation at an annual meeting
of the North American Benthological Society. It certainly made a strong
impression on me. Over the years I've read more on how to effectively present
a talk, and I've taken advantage of several free seminars here in the
Portland area that enhanced my understanding and presentation effectiveness
by addressing such topics as the colors used in the slides. Yes, it makes a
strong, sub-conscious impression on your audience by generating emotions that
either reinforce the message you're trying to convey or belying that message;
the latter leads to confusion in the listener's mind and you've lost your
audience.

   A couple of weeks ago I had to sit through a workshop on mixing zones (it
was one of those business things where I had to be seen in attendance). All
the speakers sucked big time; that's the most polite way to describe their
abuse of our presence.

   Unfortunately, too many of the PLUG meeting talks are of the same
ineffective type.

   I would be very happy to give a presentation/workshop/seminar on how to
give an effective presentation. This could help folks who not only preach to
the choir but need to make sales presentations (internally or externally),
speak to those who know less than they do about a particular topic, and be
better able to understand their own reactions to talks given by others.

   Three key factors with which an effective presentation must comply:

   1.)  Know your audience and what they expect to learn from you. Tell them
what you're going to say. Say it. Tell them what you said. Sit down.

   2.)  Assume that your audience can read and comprehend English. Do NOT
turn your back on the audience and read the slides to them. The slides should
be phrases; notes of the key points. Show few data; make it all readable to
someone over 40 years old sitting at the back of the audience. Clarity over
cute.

   3.)  If you want to excite your audience and get them emotionally stirred
up, use colors such as red and yellow. If you want to be taken seriously, use
colors such as green, blue, and grey. Use high contrast, preferably with a
dark background; black-on-white is much clearer than is white-on-black; red
on green gets you neutered with a rusty razor blade.

Dear Editor,

If City Manager Jerry Taylor had as much computer sense as your writer Regina
Garvie the entire CentOS flap wouldn't have happened.

Her article "City manager misunderstanding prompts international response"
shows a much deeper understanding of software, and the people who create it,
than Mr. Taylor's threatening emails do.

this is your very typical 'customer', what's even more

i don't know a solution, but just with our current federal
gov't officials, where even today over 1/3 of US voters
are happy with the way things are, what percentage are
'happy' with the software they use, or if in the position
to influence decisions, will recommend uSoft vs. the
unknown 'Cent OS', or any other alternative.

remember Linux is responsible for the continence of communism,

The best speaker among the locals I have seen is Randal Schwartz, when he
has time to carefully organize.  He gave a presentation to PLUG about how
to do it (about 2 years back, IIRC).  Besides the points Rich has already
made, an important point Randal made is to develop a realistic estimate
of how far you can take your audience in the time you have, and constrain
the scope of the presentation to match.

Some of the OSCON keynote speeches have been outstanding.  The best I've
seen recently is Dick Hardt's "Identity 2.0" talk:

    http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/ 

The best written exposition of how to do a presentation is in Guy Kawasaki's
"Art of the Start".  Guy's exemplar of masterful talks is Steve Jobs.
Though most of us do not have the resources of the Apple CEO, we can at
least do as well as Dick Hardt.

The process of learning this stuff from the masters is enjoyable.  Not
only will you learn something, you will have a good time while doing so;
a much better use of your relaxation time than watching TV.

Uh, Rich ... this forum is archived and searchable by the internet. 
While I can't think of a Google search that will lead those speakers
to your statement, it could be professionally costly if it did.  

Yes, there are a lot of bad presentations out there.  But it is a
learn-by-doing process.  Defensive people don't learn as well as open
people, so lessons about presentations (or anything else) should be 
provided with respect for the pupil.  Yes, they may start out as
idiots; but if they are still idiots at the end of the lesson, then
the teacher is an idiot, too.

One thing that easily gets overlooked in this entire exchange 
was that Jerry Taylor fired off an email & got an immediate 
response from a senior member of the CentOS team. It would be 
as if you wrote to Microsoft to complain about a problem & 
got a personal response from Bill Gates himself.

Now, consider if you wrote to Microsoft to angrily complain about 
a problem on your computer -- not with MS Windows, but with 
how Quicken was installed -- & Gates replied with a scathing email 
caling you not only "stupid" but "fucking stupid" & that to 
expect him to help you with third-party he has no knowledge 
of & has no control over.

Oh wait, Gates already uses that kind of language with people, 
doesn't he? And I doubt he'd acknowledge a follow-up email either.
Now how did he get to be the richest man in the world again? 
Was it actually by offering quality customer service?

Two kinds of people will read this exchange: those who have been 
on one side or the either of a tech support call, & those who 
have not. Mr. Taylor was lucky he got *any* help, let alone 
the help he did get. I would have tossed his email address into 
my twit filter -- & maybe setup an autoreply message telling him 
to go away & autoDarwinize himself

If you like Slack (or Gentoo) you may like Arch Linux even more.  It's i686
optimized -- boots and runs fast -- and has a "rolling release" packaging
system.  It also accommodates installation of unique packages through its
ABS system -- very nice.  I'd recommend one check out the wiki and forums
before taking the plunge.

I moved to Arch, a year ago, after trying Slack, Gentoo and others, and
after years of wrestling with RPM-hell.

My two cents ;-)

it is a shame ? the technical world has to deal
with the Taylor's of this world.

in this case, no response would not have changed anything,
in Mr. Taylor's mind, or may have been better after the FBI
called him back instead :)

maybe it is our own curse, we have made computer technology
accessible to the Taylor's, and now live with the consequences.

part of me misses the days when just to install a computer took
someone that knew what they were doing, even the minicomputer and
early workstation days still kept the Taylor's at bay. I'm not
saying that that was good, but it did make it easier.

i am not an educator, at time feel like giving up on ways to
enlighten the ignorant, but i can hear someone at uSoft
saying '.. come to me, and I will save you for the evil
ones, all will be better ..'

    Presentation: "Teaching Learning Perl"
    presented by Randal L. Schwartz <merlyn at stonehenge.com>

    It's about 45 minutes or so on what I've learned over the years in
    giving hundreds of presentations about Perl. Not very much Perl
    content, but lots of info about doing presentations -- useful for
    those of you who are tapped for future PLUG meetings. And it's
    funny. I'll take Q&A at the end about presentations, Perl, my new
    Alpaca book, or anything else I can answer.

It's a great discussion of SATA RAID controllers (and especially their
problems), but I wouldn't say it's a good discussion of SATA vs. SCSI.
 The references to SCSI in that document are pretty few and far
between.

That link includes a reference to http://spamaps.org/raidtests.php,
which describes some benchmarks on the Linux software RAID in recent
kernels and how it trounces hardware RAID for performance under
CPU-intensive RAID-5 tests.  This makes sense, since the fast general
purpose CPU in your box is likely to run those RAID-5 parity
calculations a whole lot faster than some cheap embedded CPU on a RAID
card, unless you really spend a lot on your RAID card.  However, I
generally avoid software RAID-5 since there are more things that can
go awry with it that will leave you without your data.  Mirroring is
great since in a worst-case scenario you can always just pull a drive
from the smoking ruin of your server, slap it into another one and
boot from it.  ;-)

That's an excellent offer!  I'd love to attend; I skipped the mandatory
Speech class requirement in school.  This would be quite a boon for
anyone presenting at LinuxFest, OSCON or a meeting.

I saw some pretty clumsy presentations last week at the Globe2006 biz &
environment conference.  The sad thing is that most of those guys knew
they were doing badly, but had no idea how to do better.  (Kinda like
businesses and the environment, eh?)

Dude!! I love you!!

Wait ... maybe not.

OK, what you have is what I am dreaming of. 

Imagine, I have asked all over the net trying to find someone using 
this setup with Linux and got no replies. And now I find someone 
right here in PLUG-land. 

So tell me more about the dual Opteron motherboard and stuff. I 
was thinking of going with a single dual-core AMD-64, probably a 
couple steps below cutting edge, as CPU speed is probably not 
that big a deal to me. At the same time, I want a pretty fast hard 
disk. Plus I want the rest of the goodies -- a couple DVD+_RW 
drives, and maybe even a TV tuner. Standard 10/100 ethernet is all 
I need and otherrwise nothing special. Do you recommend the 
Suptermicro motherboard, and if so, which one?

Also, which distro are you using, and is it the 64-bit version?

And do you have any other words of advice?

Easily my favorite part of the article:

Last I checked, Xen requires support from the OS you wish to run under
it, which is why only open-source OSs currently work with it.  The
researchers who developed it got some version of Windows (2000?)
working under it but were not able to release the changes they had to
make to Windows for licensing reasons.

VMware is able to emulate the entire hardware environment, hence the
ability to run almost anything under it.

My understanding is that you need an Intel VT-aware processor (or, 
later this year, an AMD processor with "Pacifica" technology) to run 
Windows under Xen. The Xen Wiki has the best discussion I've run 
across of what processors will do this:

   http://wiki.xensource.com/xenwiki/IntelVT

That said, I haven't seen any documents that outline the process for 
getting Window 98 to run under Xen.

   Yes. I've been using this since their pre-1.0 beta versions.

Hi:

I just got own of a new X-window emulator this week
and I used it to connect to a SuSE box.
It works fine.  The only problem is when I fire up emacs,
all characters become little squre boxes.
I have 2 lines of warnings saying that "cannot convert " courier and 
helvetica " to type FontStruct.

I recall a lot time ago that I had to set the font-alias at the OS level
but don't remember how nor do I recall if that is the solution for my 
problem.

Any tips/pointers on how to fix this emacs display problem much 
appreciated....

   OK. I'll stay with VMware. Apparently it's going to cost me money

Interesting.  Poking around the wiki some more I found this:

Q: What operating systems are supported by Xen?
A: Currently Xen supports Linux 2.4, 2.6, and NetBSD 2.0. XenSource
demonstrated Windows XP running on Xen at the Intel Developer Forum
(IDF) in August 2005, and will deliver a commercial support offering
for this in early 2006.

I wonder what they mean by "deliver a commercial support offering for
this"?  Does this mean you have to purchase a commercial license to
run Windows over IntelVT/AMD Pacifica or are they offering a support
package for open-source products?

Subject: [PLUG] Resolved: Thunderbird disk usage
Message-ID: <443167B2.4090300@comcast.net>

(I didn't ask the question here first, but since a number of you might 
be using Thunderbird, you might run into this someday. While this starts 
out with T-bird on Win98, it does continue to T-bird on SuSE 9.1.)

I use T-bird on this machine (SuSE) and on all the Win98 machines in the 
house (as well as three other machines that I "administer"). Sunday, 
after the change to daylight savings time, when my wife started up 
T-bird, it decided it had to rebuild all the summary files. After 
letting it do that, it was happy. She shut it down, and restarted it 
later and had to go through the same process. My own Win98 installation 
of T-bird did not exhibit this problem. In my case the program was 
running overnight, and I don't have too much e-mail on it, since I use 
this machine for most of it. And, naturally, this machine did not 
exhibit the problem, either. One other machine I take care of has 
exhibited the problem. It was shut down over the weekend, and restarted 
this morning. It doesn't have a lot of e-mail stored on it; my wife's 
machine does. I don't know if there's anything to that (volume of e-mail 
stored) or not.

I googled "Thunderbird rebuilding summary" and came up with this:

http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=397706

It recommended deleting all the .msf files and restarting T-bird. I 
suppose that if somehow the summary files were corrupted, this would fix 
that problem.

It also had a pointer to:

http://kb.mozillazine.org/Compacting_folders

The page starts with this explanation and warning:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
When you delete or move e-mails from a folder, Thunderbird and other 
e-mail programs really only "hide" them (i.e., mark them as ready for 
permanent deletion), and these hidden e-mails still actually remain in 
the folder. Even emptying the Trash does not permanently delete them. 
These hidden e-mails remain in the folder until it is compacted. If you 
don't compact folders your mail folders can grow very large and erratic 
program behavior occur, so it's a good idea to do it periodically.

Many new users never heard of compacting folders before and might 
confuse it with compressing files. It isn't some unique feature of 
Thunderbird. The main difference is that most other email clients by 
default automatically compact the folder when a certain amount of space 
is wasted. Thunderbird doesn't.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm not a new user, but still, I was not aware that deleting mail from 
the trash folder did not delete the mail from T-birds data files.

I verified that this has the same effect on the Linux version of T-bird 
by running df before and after compacting the trash folder on this 
machine. I went from:

Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda8              3670664   1940368   1730296  53% /home
to:
/dev/hda8              3670664   1844192   1826472  51% /home

There is a way to automate the process if one looks at

Edit>Preferences>Advanced>Manage Offline Settings...

There is a check box to "Compact folders when it will save over [100] 
KB" The [100] can be changed to whatever number of KB you want.

Hope this is useful to some of you.

Rich,

    You must be much more discriminating than I am.
I don't really care how polished a talk is as long
as I can understand the general idea of the presentation.
If I get one or two ideas out of a presentation 
(or a book for that matter) that are worth exploring on
my own, I consider the talk (or book) worth my time.
If I get one idea that I actually use in a major way,
I consider the presentation to be a Major Major Success.
By this this standand, 95% of the PLUG talks are worth my
time and a fair share of them are Major Major Successes.

    As a result, I am very grateful to our presenters for 
the high quality education they have been giving me since
1994.  They are worth every penny we have given them ...

The corporate direction at XenSource appears to lack a solid direction 
these days. See, e.g.,

   http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/04/03/xen_enterprise/

That said, I don't think that folks who are unafraid of the command 
line will need to pay for a special license to run Xen/Windows. Well, 
you'll need to pay for Windows, but there won't be additional charges 
for running it under Xen.

The whole virtualization thing is pretty cool. I did a base Gentoo/Xen 
installation last week and then used the Gentoo port of debootstrap to 
install a Debian VM with almost no fuss. I'm really impressed how spry 
the virtual machine feels.

The Solaris folks are making good headway toward Xen-ness:

Yes.  This thread http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?t=20157 was a real
shock.  "Wow, a 17 second boot time *with* X?"

ABS is a real life-saver, too.  What I like most, though, is hardly ever
having to wait for the latest updates.  When OOo publishes a new release,
updates are out in days.  It really helps with security patches, as well.
Good community.

Edit>Preferences

brings up an Options window. The bottom icon on the left pane of that 
window is "Advanced". Clicking that puts a list of things in the right 
pane, one of which is labeled "Offline and Connection Settings". If you 
click the "+" sign next to that line you'll see "Manage offline

"Offline Settings...". Clicking on that brings up another window with 
the title, "Offline & Disk Space". Note that this is the first time disk 
space has been mentioned. You'll find the check box to "Compact folders 
when it will save over [100]KB" near the bottom of this window.

Not exactly in the most obvious place. That's partly why I mentioned it.

HTH.

I'm always surprised at how much play a short boot time gets - one of
the reasons I use linux is because I *don't* have to reboot all the
time..  a boot could take 3 seconds, or it could take 30 minutes and I
wouldn't particularly care which one it was.

Odd. I'm using version 1.0.6!

I have a button above the "Connections Settings..." button labeled 
"Offline Settings...".

See:  http://archie.dotsrc.org/

Archie is the liveCD version of Arch Linux, but it's a bit behind the 
times at the moment.  The latest version was released in November '05. 
It features an XFCE desktop.

Still, it should work.  Arch uses a rolling release system, so in effect 
the "releases" are just snapshots of the distro at a particular time.  I 
think just about everybody who uses Arch tracks the CURRENT repositories 
(and the adventurous also track the TESTING repositories), which means 
as long as you're installing software then your system is always 
up-to-date.  That also means that November '05, in Arch Linux terms, is 
ancient history.  It seems that a lot of the XFCE fans on the Arch 
message boards are using SVN builds of the next XFCE release, which are 
already packaged for Arch.  These folks live on the edge. :-)

BTW, the hardware detection tool (hwd is the name, I think) that Archie 
developers built for the live CD is also included in the main distro now 
and it's excellent.  It created an almost perfect xorg.conf file for me 
in about half-a-second.  The only thing wrong with it was a missing 
screen resolution, but that was easily fixed.  It's even better than 
Debian's 'dpkg-reconfigure xorg', which I thought was already a big 
improvement over 'xorg -configure'.

Interesting. I have the same list, in the same order, with one 
exception. Instead of "Connection", I have "Offline and Connection 
Settings".

In Offline and Connection Settings, I have:

Manage offline settings				[Offline Settings...]

Set up Proxy for accessing the Internet	     [Connection Settings...]

...unless you're using Linux on a laptop, in which case you might care
a lot more.  Or doing kernel development.  Or hardware testing.  Or
like to conserve power but don't trust suspend-to-disk.  Or dual-boot.

I did some more looking and found under the File menu, just above empty 
trash, there is a "compact folders".

Does this count?

Hey all,

I just got a call from a nonprofit looking for Mambo hosting locally.

Please contact me off-list if you'd got this capability and I'll be

Okay...I have downloaded Slax 5.1 and Mepis.  Neither one detects my 
mouse (a Logitech trackball) and leaves me stranded as I am not sharp 
enough to open a terminal window or to know what file needs to be 
edited.  The computer is a K6II 350.  Should I go looking for something 
special this old girl?

Thank you David..

It is the intent that counts....

If we paid some one $500 to present..

They better be good..

Someone who presents for the love of an idea..

That is a priceless sum..

And you are right...


One idea.. One thought...

Bruce,

What version of Linux do you want to use? What do you want to do with 
Linux? If you just want to use the internet and some productivity 
programs then pretty much anything will do. Personally, I would say go 
with a gnu flavor, like Debian, Libranet, Mepis and Santa Fe Linux are 
all options. If you have Mepis try it as a liveCD then install it if you 
like it.

I don't know yet what version of Linux I want to use.  I am 
experimenting with my older computers to see what they will run.  I am 
currently running Ubuntu 5.1 on a dual processor P3 933.  At this point 
in time it is currently an Internet cruiser and something I am learning 
Linux on.

I am trying to rebuild a P3 600 that took a power burp and have a P4 
3.06 processor that is waiting to be built around.

The idea is to divorce myself from Bill Gates (applause greatly 
appreciated here).  My wife is dependent on an internet machine to do 
ordering for an organic produce co-op.  If I can get both the other 
machines up and running ($$ are an issue here) then I will have one to 
install and test drive any version. 

If someone can tell me how to run Quicken reliably in Linux, we will 
sign the papers and make the divorce final very quickly.  The AMD K6II 
350 is currently being taxed to death running XP pro to provide us with 
the Quicken machine.  Open Office has proved itself as a replacement for 
the MS Office.

The short answer is...I am wanting to learn Linux and to do it with very 
little free time.  My wife wants stable tools that work without lots of 
tinkering.

Is Libranet still alive?  I thought, after one of the two developers 
died, it was going to close up shop.

There's a good, relatively recent article looking at distros for older 
hardware at Linux.com: http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/02/13/1854251

The file you'd need to edit to fix your mouse is /etc/X11/xorg.conf 
(could be /etc/X11/XF86config, but I think most distros have moved to 
Xorg by now).  There should be two device sections, one for your 
keyboard and one for the mouse.  What's wrong might or might not be 
obvious, depending on what it says, but it's a start.

For some reason I am not able to download Archie at this time.  I will 
try again another day.  Thanks for the pointer!

A brief recap:  since I first installed Linux on my iMac three months or 
so ago, I've had connection issues related to IPv6.  This was under both 
Debian and Ubuntu.  The "fix" involved editing /etc/modules.d/aliases to 
disable IPv6 support; however, it wasn't a perfect fix.  Although that 
did enable me to browse the web, I still had problems downloading from 
the apt repositories and doing things like using Bittorrent.  Basically, 
I always had to ping the servers I wanted to connnect to, or it was no go.

Last week I got a new machine with Ubuntu pre-installed.  Same problem. 
  I installed Debian Etch to see if a newer kernel fixed the problem. 
Elliot had read that it was fixed recently.  Unfortunately, I had the 
same result.

Keep in mind that all this time I had no troubles at all with OS X on my 
iMac.

Saturday I installed Arch Linux on the new machine, and happily it 
worked properly from the get-go.  After playing around with it, I 
decided to re-structure my system to try out a few things.  I wiped 
everything and started by reinstalling Ubuntu; I was then going to 
reinstall Arch, and forget Debian.  Much to my surprise, during the 
install Ubuntu managed to connect to the repositories.  Neither it nor 
Debian have done that before, I've always had to go back post-install 
and edit the apt sources.list, ping the servers, then connect.  When the 
install finished, I booted into Ubuntu and discovered that everything 
just worked -- no disabling IPv6 necessary, no pinging necessary. 
Firefox worked fine instead of timing out like it always had.

So curiosity got the better of me and I reinstalled Debian after all, 
the exact same disc I'd used last week before installing Arch Linux.  It 
also worked immediately, and is still working.  IPv6 is enabled (that 
is, ifconfig shows an IPv6 address) and it looks like all the problems 
that have plagued me for the past three months are over.

The only thing that changed between last week and this week is that I 
installed a distro that didn't have these problems.  How could that 
possibly fix the distros that did?  It's not as if I didn't have an OS 
on hand that worked -- OS X worked fine even with Debian or Ubuntu 
sharing the same machine.  I don't see how it could have been a hardware 
issue, but could there be some setting in the modem that was screwing up 
Debian and Ubuntu, but not OS X?  And somehow Arch Linux fixed it?

Any enlightenment would be welcome.  I just don't understand this.

Michael,

Did you break the partitions and rebuild them, or did you just leave 
them? I bet you left them. The files were still there and ISTM that arch 
linux had all of the good files and then when you reinstalled the Debian 
and Ubuntu, they kept the arch linux files yet changed the necessary 
files... at least this is what it appears like to me...

BTW... I just uninstalled Ubuntu, reinstalled Debian. I killed the 
partitions and rebuilt them, then installed Debian... I had issues, many 
issues. So, I reinstalled Debian, using a different disk, and net 
installing then I had all the same ol crap. Each time I installed 
Debian, it was a bear. This was the worst experience that I have ever 
had installing Debian. (I have installed it about 15 times.) Thanks be 
to God that #oklinux is on freenode, or else I would have taken a year 
to get it to work! If you need help, go there, and ask Cybodog for some.

christian

Bruce,

   Several weeks ago my old Kensington Orbit trackball broke, and I replaced
it with a Logitech. Unplugged one; plugged in the other. Both are seen as
PS/2 pointy things.

   Is your problem on the console or in the X Window System? If the former, is
/usr/sbin/gpm running? In the latter, what have you in /etc/X11/xorg.conf?

   On my system, the latter contains:

# Identifier and driver

     Identifier  "Kensington Orbit"
     Driver      "mouse"

   (Notice I did not change the identifier when I changed the hardware.)

# The mouse device.  The device is normally set to /dev/mouse,
# which is usually a symbolic link to the real device.

#    Option "Device"      "/dev/mouse"
    Option "Device"      "/dev/psaux"
#   Option "Device"      "/dev/ttyS0"
#   Option "Device"      "/dev/ttyS1"

   (Because the trackball is plugged into the PS/2 socket on the system
board.)

HTH,

Rich

   Er, why run Quacken or Quack Books? Shuffle off to

   SQL-Ledger runs with several backends (I use postgres), httpd flavors (I
use apache-1.3.x), and any browser. Designed for manufacturing, production,
distribution, and retail, it is being used by a huge range of us with various
needs. I use it for my consulting services business. A number of folks on the
mail list use it for POS retail operations. It's completely flexible and
superbly adaptable. As a series of perl scripts, you can do with it what you
want and need. Heck, even the Estonian language translation has now been
completed.

That's the recommended thing to do that will actually free up disk space 
and really delete deleted e-mail. You can also compact a specific folder 
by right clicking on it and choosing "Compact this folder" from the 
context menu.

The automation feature I found pops up a dialog that offers to compact 
the folders when T-bird decides that doing so will save 100 KB or more 
of space. The more important thing is that compaction be done from time 
to time, so the automation feature is not critical as long as you do it 
yourself.

SQL-Ledger is great, though I don't think I would recommend it as a Quicken 
replacement, as it's more of a business accounting applicatoin. Moneydance is 
awesome for personal finances, http://www.moneydance.com/. There are other 
Linux personal finance applications, but none of them have the polish, 
feature set, or usability of Moneydance.

http://www.appgen.com/aptus/my_books_professional_linux2.htm
Appgen MyBooksPro is a great Quickbooks replacement, also great for business 
finances. 

Crossover Office runs Quicken well on Linux, 
http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxoffice/, so you can keep Quicken until 
you're ready to move to something else. A big problem with migrating away 
from Quicken is exporting your data. Intuit makes this as unfriendly and 
difficult as possible, they even dropped QIF support. Which is another reason 
to dump their sorry products.

ps2ascii (primarily for .pdf files) and pstotext. Now neither one works on
Web pages printed to .ps files.

   Has anyone else seen this? Is there a solution?

I've gotten Win98 to run under QEMU, it was slow, but usable on a 2.8Gig
P4.  There is a kernel patch that will supposedly increase performance 4
fold, but I haven't had time to try it.  (I was able to get a base
install of 2K running under QEMU, but it lost access to a critical file
after applying SP4, and would not boot any more.)  With win98, you
should be able to copy the file system to a QEMU virtual disk, boot to
safe mode, wipe the hardware, then boot to normal mode.  AFAIK, VMware
virtual disks are not compatible with QEMU and QEMU disks are not
compatible with VMware.  Good thing they both have network support.

Good Luck,

By "break" I presume you mean delete the existing partitions and create 
new ones.  Another new term for me! :-)

Actually, this time I did delete the existing partitions.  The reason 
for re-doing the set-up was because I came up with a scheme that (I 
hope) will last me for awhile without too much reshuffling.  I wanted 
new partitions sizes, and I decided it was easiest just to delete all 
them and start from scratch.  On the iMac, I usually did a new install 
into existing partitions, since I was only ever sharing OS X with one 
Linux OS at a time.  Apple does not provide an easy means for resizing 
OS X, so it's more difficult to change things around too much on a Mac 
than it is on a PC.  In any case, I hadn't thought that there might be 
something persisting on the drive between installs.  Until recently, I 
thought a re-install automatically erased all the existing data.

Debian was installed on the new machine last week on newly created 
partitions that had been unpartitioned empty space on the hard drive, 
and Debian still exhibited the same old problems.  Arch Linux, too, was 
installed over formerly empty space.  When I wiped all the existing 
partitions yesterday, I created new partitions using the same filetype, 
so maybe there was still something left.  But since the pre-installed 
Ubuntu was at the beginning of the drive and Arch was farther along, I 
don't see how an Ubuntu reinstall (also at the beginning of the drive) 
could've picked up files from a wiped Arch install about 45GBs away.

One thing I forgot about:  before I installed Arch Linux, I booted into 
FreeBSIE, the FreeBSD live CD.  It came up fine except that it failed to 
start my NIC, so I had no internet connection.  I didn't really do too 
much investigating -- I don't know if it failed to detect it, or just 
didn't load the right module.  (Is there a meaningful difference between 
those?)  I was mostly just looking at how the filesystem conventions 
differed.  So I don't think that would've done the trick, but this whole 
thing puzzles me so who knows?

What kind of issues did you have installing Debian?  Apart from my 
connection woes, I really haven't had any problems with either Sarge or 
Etch installs.  These last two reinstalls were using the Etch beta2 
installer.

   What's interesting -- I think -- is that in the eight or so years I've run
win95 and 98 on VMware I've never had a BSOD. Of course, I use it only for a
couple of legacy applications, and infrequently at that, but it has been more
reliable than when I actually booted from a partition into win95.

I didn't think "3546435852" was a valid name.
However, my DNS seems to resolve it to 211.98.81.12 which is an

What is going on?
I find many of these large integer names like this get resolved.
These are names without a .com or .org or .de or .whatever
Are these legal names?
Are they in some reserved name space?
Reserved for the Chinese Phishing Industry perhaps?

Just curious.

That's a decimal encoded IP address. The same as typing http://211.98.81.12/SomeLongPathName into your browser. There's no DNS resolution happening at all.

A quick wikipedia search doesn't reveal a terribly useful page describing the concept, but basically take the 32 bit binary address and convert that to decimal to get a decimal encoding. Traditionally we take 8 bits at a time and convert them to decimal, separated by dots. Just two different ways to represent the same thing.

It does a great job of it!  Then you can click on the x in the corner of
the window and it all goes away, leaving you with a nice Linux desktop,
gotta love it.

Hi,

It is the decimal value of the 32 bit IP address.

Cheers, Mike

I knew it! Suspicions confirmed! All that octal jive is deliberate

It didn't.  There was something in your initial Ubuntu or Debian install that you
didn't notice or are forgetting.

This is one of the features that I love about working with deterministic systems
like computers.  They are consistant, they don't lie (not even to themselves) and
with enough digging you can get to the bottom of any problem.

Soduko puzzles share the same traits.  In the process you either come to the
conclusion/answer or you backtrack to a known good point and redo until you've got
it right.

While you have no way of recovering your old Ubuntu/Debian install to dissect it. 
But you know this:  the installs are different, even if you don't recall anything
different.  The actions of the computer show this.

I will be happily compacting away, now.  In the past I didn't save 
enough emails to make this a usable function.  The PLUG list seems to be 
changing that!

 Thanks to all for helping me to learn.

Michael,

I have installed Debian 15 (maybe more) times. I am very aware of what 
should be chosen for my system. Here is what happened.
cd in (net install)
boot system
load installer
walk through installation choosing
partitioning for workstation
install desktop environment
choose correct time, region settings
everything is good.
reboot system

brings up tty1 login (command) prompt
login
system stays at command prompt (no command given by system)
startx
x makes the attempt and quits
hmmm no desktop environment?
<install gdm>
even though I had chosen desktop environment (like the previous times) 
there is no desktop environment
ok, so I think hmm... maybe there is something wrong with xorg settings 
check them they ok, but need change mouse settings to psaux
restart
same login prompt
.... same thing
no desktop environment
so from here I basically install the whole desktop environment and 
remove xdm which was installed (but probably broken)

to make a long drawn out story short...
I had to do the work the installer was supposed to do, even thought the 
appropriate options were selected. I do not mind this as I learn many 
things I did not know and become better with Linux because of it.

Rich,

Thank you.  I had to look up defenestrate.  I am not only learning 
Linux, I learned a new word today.  I love your sense of humor.

Since we are just a household with one job, all we really need is a 
checkbook type program.  We had just received a notice from Crown 
Ministries about their newly upgraded finance program being ready for 
purchase.  My wife handed it to me and lo and behold....trumpets 
blare....it works with Winders, Macs, and Linux!!

Between that and Carla's recommend we will be doing some serious looking 
and we can't wait to defenestrate!!!!!

Still laughing,

Bruce

Both these instances were with Live CDs.  I don't know if that made a 
difference.  Good stuff.  I will do more research.

Bruce,

   I thought you needed business accounting for your wife's business
interests. That's why I recommended SQL-Ledger.

   For several years I used gnucash and liked it very much. But, they're stuck
with gtk+1 and trying to fix it to work with gtk+2 was a major PITA. The
fellow who had built the Slackware packages of gnucash also gave up and he
recommended kmymoney2. It's crude; _I_ don't like the UI at all, but it
works. All I had to do was install the kdelibs package and it ran ... er,
worked. That's another option for you.

System under discussion:

Supermicro AW4020C composed of Supermicro H8DCE dual Opteron motherboard 
and
Supermicro 645 rack/tower case with temp controlled case/mb/PS fans and 
8-SATA hot-swap bays.
Areca 1220 PCIe 8-port SATA HW RAID controller
eVGA 7800 GT KO video card
Pioneer 110D DVD DL/RW
Hauppgauge PVR550 dual TV tuner
Creative Audigy 2Z (includes firewire port "missing" from MB)

Getting this system up and running has been a real PITA.  Mostly due to 
bad vendor experience exacerbated by bad or misleading 
compatibility/driver information.

I purchased the Supermicro AW4020C barebones system (which contains 
Supermicro H8DCE motherboard), (2) 246 Opterons, and (4) 1G OCZ ECC 
PC3200 RAM  from Monarch Computers.  I purchased as "parts" because 
Monarch could not build the system with the parts I wanted.  I purchased 
the rest of the components from TigerDirect, Newegg, Directron, and 
QuietPC.  I prefer to keep the vendor count down but, in this case, no 
one could provide all the components.  For example, I wanted the eVGA 
7800 GT (to get dual-link DVI) but only TigerDirect had them in stock.  
I purchased my fanless CPU coolers from QuietPC because they were, and 
always have been, very helpful in determining what would or would not 
work in the system.

I now, personally, consider Monarch Computer my "vendor of last 
resort".  There service and support was so bad I would only purchase 
something from them if I could not get it ANY PLACE else.  They are 
supposedly OEM for the Supermicro products but were totally unable to 
provide support.  I had a problem which turned out to be a bad 
motherboard; I sent the system back; after waiting the alloted time for 
it's return it took me days just to get someone to answer the phone 
where upon they just shipped the system back without fixing it (not sure 
they even looked at it).

Once I contacted Supermicro and pleaded for direct support (which they 
readily granted) things were diagnosed and fixed very quickly.  They 
cross-shipped a new motherboard FedEx and things were moving on.

Which got things working enough to discover the (5) Samsung 2504C 250G 
SATA drives I purchased have a bug in their implementation of SATA-II 
features and can not be detected by the Areca RAID.  This is a 
known/fixed problem but requires drives with newer/upgraded firmware.  
It took me weeks, and several calls to the Samsung national sales 
manager to receive firware upgrade software which immediately rendered 
the drive dead.  More calls to the national sales manager and I received 
(5) new drives ALL with the outdated firware.  I gave up on the Samsung 
drives.

The Seagate 7200.9 500G drives now in the machine work just great.

Unfortunately, they only work attached directly to the mother board 
nForce SATA ports.  I could install onto the Areca based RAID array 
using SuSE 10.0 or Ubuntu 5.10 BUT both exhibited such instability (I 
think related to, then current, AMD64/nvidia problems) that I could not 
use the system.  I switched to Debian (which I use on a couple other 
systems) and now have a very stable system.  Unfortunately, the Areca 
driver is not included in the Debian kernels (not even the newest 
ones).  There are sarge install variants available which include the 
Areca driver but as soon as you upgrade your kernel you loose the 
Areca.  Bottom line -- Areca and Debian only work if you are into 
building you own kernel/drivers.

TigerDirect, Newegg, Directron, Dell, and especially QuietPC were all 
very, very good to deal with.

Now, having listened to my home movie, let me say my plans for the next 
system.

1) I will not buy another RAID card unless I KNOW it is supported in the 
standard kernel.  It is just too much ongoing pain and hassle if you're 
just trying to maintain/use the machine.  Every time I have been swayed 
to buy the newer/better/shinier SCSI, RAID, whatever it has not been 
cost-effective to get the thing working and maintain it. The safest is 
3ware which is well supported in most distributions and has been for 
some time. 

2) I will probably buy the Tyan motherboard next time (eg. 2895).  The 
Supermicro people have been very good when I have a bad component but 
there are very few forums or other resources available to get help.  
Supermicro's Opteron products are kind of their quiet secret and just 
not nearly as widely/publically supported as the Tyan boards are.

3) I would highly recommend the Hauppgauge PVR 150/250/350/550 cards.  
Not only are they good products but they seem to be the best supported 
(eg. in MythTV project, etc.).

4) For desktop/workstation system I would probably, at this point, go 
with a AMD64 X2 solution using a DFI, MSI, or Tyan motherboard.  The 
system above needed to include a large disk array and will eventually 
migrate into primarily server role so I went with the more expensive 
"server" hardware.  Probably overkill the desktop/workstation use.

5) Get the Apple or Dell 30"; it is "sell a body part" worth it (at 
least for the development / graphics work I do).  At least make sure you 
get a dual-link DVI card so you can support a 30" (2560x1600) or 24" 
(1920x1200) when you finally get paid for all those blood donations :)

6) If you install AMD64 version (esp of Debian) you will need to set up 
a 32-bit chroot environment;  it turned out to be a lot simpler to set 
up than it appeared at first blush and works quite well.

Hope that is not too longwinded...

John:

I certainly understand what you are saying and I would come down closer to your position, however I wouldn't blame Linux, I would blame the community.  Although, at some level, this is a very open community (and I speak here of the Linux community in the most generic sense not PLUG) educating people is considered almost an afterthought.  It is almost as if the general consensus is that of course avergage end-user Mary is going to want to spend Saturday night hacking config files.  Who wouldn't want to?  And therein lies part of the problem.  I will say that over the last eight or nine years, the Linux/open-source community has moved away from the kind of obvious elitism (and there is no other word for it than that, sorry) that caused folks to disdain usability concerns (although never explicitly stated, the feeling I got was that the learning curve kept the 'mundanes' away) as irrelevant.  Anyone who really wanted to learn how to network with Samba would hack smb.conf end-of-story.  There is a truth as far as that goes, however, if you are trying to network your house and you just can't make Samba work, how likely are you to recommend Linux to your neighbor?  If not by word of mouth, how does the Linux meme spread?  I think that the open-source community as a whole and the Linux community specifically needs to do a much better job at educating people and remembering 'beginner's mind'.  We also need to take the issue of end-user experience as important and not an inconvenient sidenote.
Cheers
Aj

I don't think so.  Most IP address parsers (I suspect) tend to be
implemented with something like scanf(3), which handles decimal, octal
and hexadecimal representation of integers.  It is, however, possible to
use the hexadecimal representation; I've been known to be obnoxious and
enter netmasks in hex--typically 0xffffff00.

You are too logical, Mr. Spock.  I think it's Tribble trouble, or 
perhaps the Ghost of Windows Past haunting the castle.

With the two Debian installs less than one week apart:  The first thing 
the Etch beta2 installer does vis-a-vis the network, after it has 
identified the hardware, is configure DHCP.  That succeeded, on both 
installs attempts (and on all previous install attempt of Debian with 
different install discs, on this machine and on the iMac).  After you 
create your user account, it moves on to asking you to select apt 
sources.  Both times, last week and this week, I selected 
ftp.us.debian.org.  Then it tries connecting to the servers to get the 
package list.  Last week, and 99% of the previous occasions I've 
installed some form of Debian, that attempt has failed.  This is the 
first instance in which the problem manifests itself.  I can't reach the 
servers.  I've had to switch over to another console and ping the 
server, then make it try again.  It always succeeds connecting after a 
fresh ping.  This week, I didn't have to do that -- it was successful on 
its first attempt.  All this happens before I am given the opportunity 
to select any packages or do any other customizations.  The only things 
I've done at this point are enter a root password, create a user account 
and choose the servers.

Certainly you're right that *something* is different, *somewhere.*  But 
the install processes up to this point were identical.  If there is 
something that Debian installs later in the process that mucks up my 
connection, it has not yet been installed, on either occasion.  Or if 
something already has been installed that was mucking up the connection, 
it already has been installed on both occasions, from the install disc. 
  At this point there's been no interaction with the outside world. 
However, there has been some interaction with my modem, in configuring 
DHCP.  That's why I'm wondering if in the process of installing Arch 
Linux, or even in the process of booting FreeBSIE, something in the 
modem changed.

I'd like to know what's going on because I'd like to know how to fix it 
-- really fix it, as opposed to the only partly adequate workaround I 
had before -- if it crops up again.

Unless there's a voltage problem, at which point values that are 
supposed to be binary acquire a "maybe" bit :-)  At least, that's my 
best guess on what was going on with my hard drive problem because it 
definitely isn't the drives.

I have saved it in two different places so as not to lose it. Awesome information, for which I am verty grateful.

As you surmised, yes I will be doing a desktop system, so the RAID problems you had should not be a factor.  I back up to an external USB 2.0 drive, so one single drive is all I need. 

I have built computers for myself in the past, although always Windows boxes. Neverthless, I have the basic understanding of where the screws go and how to plug stuff in. And I am not afraid of the process. It's just Linux compatibility issues where I need research assistance. Your message has been invaluable.

I was thinking that it might be wise to wait until fall, but from what you say it should be possible to get it all working earlier. I think I'm going to target mid-July for this project, maybe a decent interval after Ubuntu Dapper is out.

Thanks again for taking the time to tell me the long story. I totally appreciate it!

I run Win98 under Win4Lin 4, in order to run one CAD app.  The CAD app
sometimes bluescreens the Win98 and Win4Lin, but nothing closing the
window can't handle.  Since the earlier versions of Win4Lin translated
to the native Linux file system,  this leaves less file corruption than
a native Windows crash.  Newer versions of Win4Lin unfortunately work
like VMWare, with a large binary disk file that pretends it is the
Windoze file system.  That may crash more deeply.  This is so people
can run XP and NTFS, I suppose.

Someday, some sarcastic soul with too much money will buy a billboard
in Redmond WA, somewhere before the M$ campus, paint it blue, and put
"Welcome to Microsoft" in white lettering on it.

Linux-to-Projector interfacing?   If not, perhaps there is a
business opportunity here.

I was imagining a site with a webform where you enter your laptop
type, distro or version of X, and the desired resolution, and it
emits a commented Xconfig file.  The deluxe version of the site
helps you locate and upload your current Xconfig file, and then
sends it back with the necessary changes.  The superdeluxe version
allows institutions to upload the list of projectors they have in
various rooms, so an employee or visitor can enter something like
"XYZ company, conference room B-3" and get setup info in advance
(without revealing theft-friendly info).  

That would be a medium-sized task to do all the CGI programming
for, but one motivated person could probably do it in a few
months.  It could get paid for by bonus features and advertising
- it would be used by folks with more money than most.  And no,
it would be evil to put the advertising in the user's presentation,
don't even think that :-/

Of course you could extend the site to handle Windows and
Macintosh, but hardly anyone uses those OS's any more ...

Somebody please steal the idea and roll it out, so I have
something to use when I try to get my laptop working with some
ancient 640x480 P.O.S. projector, or some 2048x1536 laptop with
my 1024x768 projector, 5 minutes before an important presentation.

Keith,

I thought that projectors were 'dumb' machines that merely receive a 
signal and then convert it to light on a screen... I have not had any 
issues with this... but admittedly, I am only working with one 
projector. I have an old piece o junk sony viao that sends the signal 
quite well.

All computer projectors are displays, and all modern ones incorporate
some kind of solid state pixel array, with a fixed sized X by Y size.
The signal out of a laptop HD15 video port makes assumptions about
the X by Y size of the pixel array, typically assuming it matches the
laptop display.  By changing the X configuration on the laptop, you
can change the X by Y size of the signal.  Different versions of X,
different video chips, etc. do this differently.

Meanwhile, recent computer displays (projectors and LCDs) often have
the capability to "resample" the signal, and create a marginally
viewable display out of a signal with a different X by Y size than
the native size of the solid state array of the projector.  However,
this can lead to aliasing, which is where the frequencies don't
quite match, and you get really cruddy pictures.  Worst case
pictures to send to a computer projector that is resampling are
things like grids of alternate black/white pixels or alternate
black/white vertical lines.  

To help the process along, modern projectors and modern laptops
and modern display software are aware of DDC, or display data
channel ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Data_Channel )
which communicates available monitor modes from the display to
the computer.  If X is configured correctly, and modern enough,
and the display driver in the kernel permits it, and the phase of
the moon is correct, then the laptop/projector combination "just
works".  However, it doesn't always just work, and sometimes you
have to tweak the resolution of your laptop display to match 
something the projector can handle.  For example, my projector
will resample up to 1280 x 1024 analog video signals, but a 1536
by 1152 signal, or a 1600 by 1200 signal will drive it nuts.  

Some laptops with high native resolution will not "dual head",
and display a higher resolution on their screens than out the 
analog port, so they must be purposely "dumbed down" to display
on a smaller window on the laptop's LCD, in order to match the
projector.  Sometimes it is only possible to get an acceptable
display by dumbing the signal down to the projector's native
resolution, even if the projector will resample from somewhat
higher resolutions, because of aliasing.  This will become
increasingly problematic as the installed computer projector
population ages in relation to the laptops that will be driving
them - downsampling a signal almost always looks crummy, especially
when displaying text, which we Linux command line weenies often do.

In any case, all of this can involve tweaking the Xconfig, typically
while a bunch of impatient people are hammering you with questions
about what you are there to talk about.  Because you are tweaking
on something involving Linux, your surly insistence on focusing on
your tweaking task will be interpreted as a failure of Linux, a
failure of your personality, and failure of the subject you are
there to discuss.  Shortening configuration time with proper tools
is important.  Hence my suggestion for web-based tools to help. 

Keith

Probably more appropos in this case -- & many others -- than folks 
might consider. Sometimes a powercycle clears up all problems with a 
computer: something in the firmware of a chip somewhere gets corrupted, 
& the only way to clear from memory is a powercycle. Sometimes a *very* 
thorough powercycle: shut the computer off, disconnect the power 
cord & wait 15 seconds for all of the capacitors to discharge.

While Michael is correct, that computers are deterministic beasts, 
each one has enough layers of hardware -> firmware -> driver -> OS -> 
application to permit a stray bitrot to cause havoc up the stack. 
Never underestimate the cleansing strength of a powercycle: it's 
saved Microsoft's butt many times.

On the other hand, unless you can reproduce this glitch on a regular 
basis, don't waste time on it: transient weirdness is part of the 
joys of working with computers. And there are countless more shallow & 
fixable bugs out there to identify & squash. And I look for defects 
in network drivers, BIOSes & other goodies to pay the mortgage, so 
I think I know what I'm talking about. (Hey, I found two bugs in 
ethtool! Well, okay, they were typos in the diagnostic output -- but 
nonetheless I reported them.)

Message-ID: <20060405082958.d2203c78.johnxj@comcast.net>

Have had Xsane on my Ubuntu-64 laptop for some time, and it works
beautifully with my Canon LiDE-30 scanner. (I bought the scanner
specifically to use with Linux, so I researched first -- and it all
works perfectly!)

However, now, for the first time, I am trying to OCR some pages of
text. This is linguistics stuff, so I expected that it OCR utility
would choke a bit on IPA characters. But what I am getting is mostly
garbage. It would be faster to type it in de novo. Surely I am doing
something wrong here. 

The first thing that happened was that Xsane gave me an error message
"child process not launched," or something like that. Taking a wild
guess I assumed that this message meant that Xsane could not find an
OCR utility. In other words, installing Xsane included a menu item for
OCR, but not the utility. So I popped up Synaptic and searched on
"optical" and on "OCR." This turned up gocr and ocrad. I installed
gocr, the gocr-doc package and gocr-gtk. Afterwards Xsane was happy to
OCR the image, but the results were lousy. 

The problem is I can't figure out how to tweak gocr. From my experience
with OCR programs on Windows there should be a "learning" tool and
other goodies to enhance the results. For example, I expected a window
to pop up for editing the results, and corrections would be saved to a
learning configuration file somewhere. It should also use whatever
spell checker you have installed as well. But all I get is a prompt for
the output file name.

I assumed gocr-doc was the Help file, but I can't figure out how to
launch it or read it. There are no entries on the gnome panel to launch
gocr or gocr-doc. From the command line I tried gocr, gocr-doc and
gocr-gtk, but all returned just "command not found." There has to be
more to this utility, I just can't figure out how to get into the
options.

Then I installed ocrad, but not only does Xsane not see it, I can't
find any way to launch it. If I type "ocrad" from the command line the
cursor moves down without a prompt in front of it, but nothing appears
on screen and there are no error messages. It looks like something
might be running, but who knows?

As awesome as Xsane is, surely there is something better than this for
OCR. Any suggestions?

Sounds like you're catching on.

I'm guessing that you might want to scan the page to a (pbm) file and 
work from that while you're trying to get the OCR working just-so.  If 
xsane runs the scanner every time you try this, that extended wait is 
going to be frustrating.

What resolution is your capture?  200-300 dpi B&W is typically 
considered to be the minimum.

Were those goodies free?  GPL?  Then you could just port the relevant 
bits to linux and be all set :-)

OCR is not an easy problem.

http://kooka.kde.org/ is only going to be a different front-end and will 
either interface with gocr, ocrad, or a commercial app (if you want to 
spend $1k on it -- sounds like a $100 donation to gocr or ocrad might 
be a good investment :-/

I'm guessing that ubuntu has dpkg.

  dpkg -L gocr
  dpkg -L gocr | grep bin

might help find it.

I see some possibilities not mentioned so far (unless I missed it):

1. Something changed in the modem. I worked around my problem by 
removing the modem from the list of addresses in Linus and pointing 
primary and secondary addresses to the ISP.

2. The ISP changed something.

Thanks

I used wait for the next bleeding wave too (coming this summer...AMD2, 
SocketF, DDR2, nForce5, ...)
but have been tossed up on the beach stunned and bleeding just too many 
times.

I have found the best road to success (as measured in time, frustration, 
actual USE of the computer, ...)
is to target what was hot a few months ago and is now being over 
shadowed by this month's new thing.

For example, AMD X2, Opteron, nForce4, nVidia 78xx, ... have been out 
for a while and were last years big thing
but it is only in the last few months that the requisite fixes/patches 
have filtered through to the standard kernel builds, nVidia drivers, 
etc. and that you can readily build a solid, stable, system without 
getting blood all over yourself.  It's also about the time the prices 
start dropping.  My advice, drool over the Xmas catalogs/magazines, then 
go shopping. :)

I have tried repeatedly over the last several days to download Archie.  
I have tried from archie.dotsrc as well as from several mirrors with 
older versions, all to no avail.  The archie website does nothing, the 
mirrors I tried with wget -c (tried archie.dotsrc too) and it hangs at 
PASV and eventually times out.

Is wget waiting for user input at the PASV?
Do I need to know the secret handshake, the proper incantation, and the 
correct direction to face while genuflecting?


Any ideas?

The problem is that Xsane -- as cool as it is -- seems to have no
ability to OCR from a PBM file (whatever that is -- something like a
TIFF?). I can save to a PBM file from Xsane. It's just that a PBM file
is all that it will remain.

Well, I can change that in Xsane, and I tried it, but I still got lousy
OCR results. The problem is that there is no ability to tweak the OCR
end of the process.

Actually, yes they were free. On the Windows desktop computer I can use
any of several competing brands under a "free trial" period. I have yet
to buy an OCR program for the Windows machine. But then, I don't need
to do it very often. As for porting, sorry. Not a programmer.

OK, I found kooka in Synaptic and installed it. Much better! Now I'm
getting somewhere. See, I figured gocr or ocrad was somehow tweakable.
They had to be, it was just inconceivable to me that Linux OCR software
was as bad as the results I was getting. It's just that the Xsane front
end doesn't implement the buttons to do so. Kooka does. So now I am
working on figuring out kooka.

Only problem is, now I have installed yet one more KDE app in my Gnome
desktop. I have so many KDE apps installed I might as well be running
KDE. Except I still think KDE is ugly. :(  Oh well. You mentioned that
the OCR process was slow. Using kooka I did a preview scan, selected
one long paragraph from a really clean page (no stray marks or junk on
it), and then told kooka to OCR it. The gear-thingy started jumping
around, indicating it was working on it. Five minutes later I killed
the process because something must have gone wrong. Surely it can't
take five minutes for one paragraph (about the length of this
paragraph). I can type way faster than that. Methinks it got hung up
somehow. I tried it several times and got the same results.

Anyway, thanks for the suggestion to try kooka. That's a big
improvement. Now I just need to figure out what is wrong with it.

My suggestion is that you save a pbm from the scan and then work-out the 
options or configs for the ocr from the command-line (gocr [options] 
pnm_file_name).  Once you have that working, you'll need to find a way 
to set the options in xsane or kooka.  But first you have to figure out 
how to tweak gocr and that is going to require reading the manual and 
docs and figuring out what the -m 130 option does.

The ascii art is awesome, but it could use a gui frontend for the 
training mode.  Given the current figures, 
 ( development cost / my annual profit on scanner sales => infinity )
it's going to be a while before I write one.

Bryce Harrington was planning to speak on inkscape at tomorrow's
PLUG meeting, but he has the flu and can't make it.

I have just asked someone else to fill in.  This person often comes 
to PLUG meetings and has an excellent talk on mythtv prepared.
However, I don't yet know if he is available and willing to
speak to PLUG Thursday night.

In light of this, is anyone else willing to give a talk if the
one on mythtv doesn't work out?  If so, please let me know.

                                          Sincerely,

from the article: "tying together the two major Linux desktop

I will believe it when I see it.

I'm sorry, could you be a little more more expansive?  What do you mean, 
"removing the modem from the list of addresses"?

Certainly a possibility, but the timing would be quite a coincidence.

None here.  I will ask on the Arch mailing list or on the message 
boards, though.  I didn't download Archie myself because I already knew 
I wanted to try Arch, so I was just presuming the live CD was still 
available.  It sure looks like it is judging from the website.  But I 
apologize in advance if I've inadvertently led you down the garden path.

I'll see if I can find anything out ... maybe someone else more informed 
will reply here in the meantime.

My understanding of these things is pretty limited, but if you are using 
alsa, don't you need the alsa driver loaded?  The alsa matrix reports 
that nVidia nForce chipsets use the intel8x0 driver:

http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/index.php?vendor=vendor-Nvidia#matrix

That would be "i810audio.o" from your list.

   Sigh. Thank you, Michael. That's what I kept missing despite reading the
ALSA trouble-shooting page and the rest. It took a pair of fresh eyeballs to
spot that.

On a similar subject, more locally, I didn't notice any reference
to the article about Chris Wright in the Monday Oregonian.  Page
D1, with a picture.  "Linux developer sets own hours..." yada yada.

Chris spoke at Advanced Topics on Virtualization a couple of years
ago.  I expect him to keep me on my toes on the 17th...

           Disable the use of the passive FTP transfer mode.  Passive
FTP mandates that the client connect to the server to establish the data
connection rather than the other way around.

           If the machine is connected to the Internet directly, both
passive and active FTP should work equally well.  Behind most firewall
and NAT configurations passive FTP has a better chance of working.
However, in some rare firewall configurations, active FTP actually works
when passive FTP doesn?t.  If you suspect this to be the case, use this
option, or set "passive_ftp=off" in your init file.

Someone posted this link on the Arch message boards:

It's working for me -- I'm downloading it now, with Firefox.

Subject: [PLUG] turn off a wireless card
Message-ID: <20060406040313.6EAA38F13@tinman.seitzassoc.com>


My IBM X40 laptop has an Intel 2200BG wireless card.  There are times when
I would like to temporarily turn off the wireless card, but as far as I
can tell, there is no external switch to turn it off.  Is there a command
I can use to turn it off, or do I need to unload the driver module?  I 
currently have Fedora Core 4 installed.

thanks,
galen

      Moodle (www.moodle.org) is a course management system (CMS) 
      - a free, Open Source software package designed using sound 
      pedagogical principles, to help educators create effective 
      online learning communities.  You can download and use it 
      on any computer you have handy (including webhosts), yet it 
      can scale from a single-teacher site to a 50,000-student University. 

      Dan Carrere has worked with Linux and other Open Source Software 
      for many years.  He has also taught and worked at several 
      post secondary institutions.  He is currently working at
      Lane Community College where he has been active in building 
      a Moodle site.

Damn! Finally a PLUG meeting on something I am keenly 
interested in (Inkscape), and it is delayed. Please let our speaker 
know he is not permanently off the hook. [Just kidding] :):)

Meantime, never having heard of moodle, I googled and moodled 
and am wondering if it might be something PSU could use to 
replace the student registration program, which must have been a 
freshman compsci project. (Yeah, it's that bad.)

Or might it be something our computer un-literate linguistics 
professors could use to create programs in drawing x-bar schema 
and other stuff that is hard for students to grasp without a lot of 
repetitive practice?

I think the command you want is "sudo ifdown wlan0." The final 
character is a zero. To turn it back on replace "down" with "up."

The Intel 2200BG shows up as eth1, not wlan0, on my system.  "ifdown
eth1" stops any packets from being routed over the wireless link, but
the LED wireless indicator still goes on and off as if the radio is
still active.  iwconfig gives no indication that the radio is off.

I don't know the answer for your hardware.  You might look at the
iwpriv command.  That should list the private ioctl's, perhaps one of
which is a power control.

Did you try:

  iwconfig eth1 power off

?

OK, I am new to Linux and forgot the details. I just checked the 
linux box to get the menu sequence I used with FC4:
   Click desktop at the top of the main screen
     Select system settings from the drop down menu
       Select the DNS tab on the box that opened.
         I found the primary DNS address set to 192.168.0.1, the modem.
         The secondary DNS was set to my ISP

What I did to slove the problem was to put the DNS address of the ISP 
in both places by copying the secondary DNS address to the primary 
DNS address. Another machine with Qwest as ISP started working when I 
got the primary and secondary DNS address from their support number.

Now the rest of the story:
As I mentioned, I just checked the Linux box to get the information 
to write the above. I found that the Modem's address had re-appeared 
as the Primary DNS. But it still works.

As I originally said, something in the modem or the ISP is suggested 
by the data.

Hope this helps someone.

Thanks
JK

I think that controls how often the radio sleeps.  It may be possible to
turn off the radio that way, but the command would have to be 
iwconfig eth1 power on
I tried it anyway, but it didn't seem to have any effect.

The rfswitch web site looked promising, but the X40 is shown as 'None'
in the laptop support table.

I found what I was looking for in the readme for the ipw2200 driver.


1.4.2 Device Level Sysfs Helper Files
-----------------------------------------------

For the device level files, look in
	
	/sys/bus/pci/drivers/ipw2200/{PCI-ID}/

For example:
	/sys/bus/pci/drivers/ipw2200/0000:02:01.0

For the device level files, see /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ipw2200:

  rf_kill
	read - 
	0 = RF kill not enabled (radio on)
	1 = SW based RF kill active (radio off)
	2 = HW based RF kill active (radio off)
	3 = Both HW and SW RF kill active (radio off)
	write -
	0 = If SW based RF kill active, turn the radio back on
	1 = If radio is on, activate SW based RF kill

	NOTE: If you enable the SW based RF kill and then toggle the HW
  	based RF kill from ON -> OFF -> ON, the radio will NOT come back on


On my X40 the following command turns off the rf, or at least I think it
does, as the LED never changes state after the command is issued.
  echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ipw2200/0000\:02\:02.0/rf_kill

You think it's merely *that* bad?  IIRC Banweb is commercial software.  

WebCT and Moodle have common origins; WebCT is a commercial fork.  

I am really amazed what people will pay money for.  I guess it comes
down to who makes the sales calls.

Hm.  Well, if it ain't, it could be, thanks to the power of OSS and
reuse.  Heck, some of the new Python GUI tools make it real easy to
develop custom software that runs on anything.

I know that our moodle speaker, Dan Carrere, has looked at both Blackboard
and WebCT before selecting moodle.  Of course, Dan is biased toward
Open Source solutions; but he intends to do some comparison of moodle 
with Blackboard and WebCT.  

He also knows something about learnlinc which is a really cool, 
expensive, highly closed source tool for giving interactive on-line
classes.  I don't think moodle can do anything like this, but I'm 
sure he will talk about it.  This is something the Open Source 
world really needs and we have most of the parts with things like
gnu-meeting; but to my knowledge no one as integrated them in a
easy to use, friendly manner oriented toward on-line education.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0604060946360.4589@blackbox.fnordora.org>

I have a whole bunch of hardware cluttering up my house.

I am going to be moving in about a month (or less).

I will be giving it away to to whoever wants it.  The rest is going to 
FreeGeek.

There is a Sun 670/MP, a Sparc 2, a PowerPC box, a bunch of misc 
motherboards (including a mips box). A non-working SGI, a whole bunch of 
old cases, keyboards, memory, and obsolete crap.

I will have a list soon.

Anyone who wants it, answer off list.  You get to pick it up and move it.

Subject: [PLUG] more on Tbird compacting
Message-ID: <44354A21.2090905@writemoore.net>

Regarding all the prior discussion about Mozilla Thunderbird and the 
compacting of mail folders, I upgraded to Thunderbird 1.5 and the 
compacting option is now located under the "Advanced" tab of Preferences 
panel, on the sub-tab "Offline and Disk Space."  Thunderbird 1.5, like 
Firefox 1.5, has redone the layout of the Preferences panel, for the 
better I think.  One nice feature is that it provides easy access from 
Preferences to "about:config," the place where you can really go to town 
tweaking Thunderbird to your heart's content.  It's also under the 
Advanced tab, at the bottom of the "General" sub-tab.  There's a button 
called "Config Editor" that opens up about:config, which contains all 
the hidden preference options.

But about the compacting, I think Tbird does it automatically now.  I 
noticed it compacting a folder (it displays a message in the status 
bar), so I went hunting for the setting.  Sure enough, the compacting 
box was unchecked.  So even though I hadn't told it to compact, it was 
doing it anyway.

OIC what you mean.  You're talking about DNS, but my problems were not 
DNS related.  An easy way to tell if you're having DNS issues is to 
watch the status bar of your browser.  When you enter a URL or click on 
a link, the status bar will show "Looking for..." the site.  If it hangs 
there (i.e., never finds the site), you might be having DNS problems. 
If it progresses to "Waiting for..." the site, then the DNS look-up 
succeeded and it is trying to download the appropriate page.

Of course, there are more sophisticated ways of checking DNS, like 
nslookup (read 'man nslookup').  But just watching the browser status 
bar is a good first clue.

In my case, I didn't have any problems finding the servers.  I just 
couldn't connect to them successfully once I did find them.

Thanks anyway for the explanation.

Firefox wouldn't download it for me.
Ken's idea worked for wget.  I disabled -c and added the 
--no-passive-ftp option and off she went.

You need not apologize for sending me down the garden path.  I learn as

Subject: [PLUG] Syngress security books on sale
Message-ID: <20060407011222.GA3248@gate.kl-ic.com>


Linux related, though a bit commercially tainted :-/

Until midnight Thursday 4/06 (eastern time?) Syngress Books is
selling off a bunch of titles at high discounts, some $5 each,
plus shipping.  They have a lot of books on security, many for
open source apps.

A week ago, I bought a copy of Wotring's "Host Intregrity Monitoring 
Using Osiris and Samhain" for $10 + $4.52 DHL shipping.  It is now
$5 (List $45).   They also provide a free PDF download with the dead
tree version, which is cheaper than the E-book version.  Go figure.
I guess they really, really need money to pay taxes.

Note - two annoyances. First:  the book was poorly trimmed;  I had
to cut open twenty or so page pairs with my trusty pocket knife. 
So trim your Syngress book before going to the airport.

Second, the book was sent "cheapest way" with DHL, which meant that
although it arrived last Friday, they weren't planning on delivering
it until Wednesday, the estimated delivery time.  That's just petty.
However, I was down to the DHL office to ship out a warranty repair,
so the kind folks behind the counter dug the book out for me.

Again, forgive a dollar denominated posting, but many of the books
are about Linux!

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0604061928280.4568@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I've had great help here on identifying the missing sound driver for my new
workstation. Now I'm stuck on getting sound working on my fiancee's ThinkPad
600E.

   On the ALSA project Web site's Trouble Shooting page, I worked my way from
the top down. Running alsaconf revealed the incorrect driver was loaded. The
widget searched the system (reading lspci?), indentified the correct Cirrus
Logic chip, found the driver, and modifed /etc/modules.conf as well as
running modprobe to load the correct driver and its helper friends. That
checked out OK with alsamixer, both as root and as a user. When I let the
ALSA widget find, install, and configure the proper driver, it also removed
~/.asoundrc. But, the directory /proc/asound/ contained all the proper
information (e.g., found the card, correct alsa version).

   Every step checked out in the series "drivers loaded, but still no sound."
I'm trying to run xmms on that box, and I know that uses the ALSA drivers,
not the OSS drivers, so I stopped before that section.

   When I run xmms, I see the mixer showing the sound being generated. I've
run aumix and turned up the sound levels for master and PGM to about 80
percent; that should make a loud noise. No sound.

   In summary, the alsa tools found the correct drivers and loaded them. Sound
channels are open according to aumix and alsamixer. The application xmms is
doing its thing. There's still no sound to be heard.

   I'd like some thoughts from you more experienced folks on what else I need
to check, or what I may have missed here.

TIA,

Rich

thinkpad here, t40 series, had linux up and running in half a day, but no 
sound. found "thinkwiki" - took me two weeks of searching to discover that you 
had to MUTE two channels in order to get the speakers to work - it's 
explicitly mentioned on the alsa FAQ too.

I believe it's "line jack sense" and "headphone jack sense".

hope it helps ;^)

Auke,

   That must be one of the differences between the 600E and T40. In both
alsamixer and aumix, the only unmuted channels are master and PGM. There is
no "line jack sense" or "headphone jack sense" in either of those
applications.

   The ALSA wiki trouble shooting page mentioned switching between analog and
digital speaker modes, but the information for the driver on that box had no
indication there was a choice, or any way of selecting them.

   I'll look more tomorrow.

Thanks,

Rich

Hello PLUG members,

I apologize for the spam-like posting here, but I am looking for a few good
minds to help build an amazing animation studio here in Portland.

Are there any places to direct me to local talent of a higher caliber? I
chose to post to PLUG because I know that the subscribers to this group are
in the range of talent I seek. Please refrain from craigstlist type
suggestions. That will only generate too many generic replies. Perhaps there
is a web site local to Portland that has a collaboration of good talent?

Specifically, I am seeking LOCAL Sr. Linux/Windows experts for our systems
support group, however there are many other listings posted here:

http://www.laika.com/entertainment/?m=bookmark&g=company&c=jobs

Again, I know this isn't a technical related topic, so please accept my
apologies in advance. I have been watching PLUG for some time now and I
respect your forum and the sharing of its technical knowledge base.

To keep the post somewhat relevant, I'll be experimenting with my MacBook
Pro/BootCamp/CentOS4.3. Would any of you like to hear about the results of
the install? The XP install worked great! It's surreal to go from OS-X to
XP. I can't wait to put CentOS on it to see what happens!

Anyhow...Thanks for your time...

David

Subject: [PLUG] dirvish question..
Message-ID: <4435E621.6070407@spek.org>

Hello,
  I've been playing around with dirvish as a possible solution to
replace my current semi-homegrown backup "system".

  All is good except multiple snaps of an unchanged directory tree take
up significant space (about 30% of the original) according to du.  Stat
doesn't show any of the handful of files I've checked as linked files
and all have different inodes.

  If I create a file of some random size, then make a hard link to the
file with ln stat shows both the "original" and the linked has linked
and with the same inode.

  Are du and/or stat lying to me?  Or does the rsync link consume lots
of space that a regular ln link doesn't?  Or am I missing some key
dirvish option?

  And I'm not sure if it matters or not, but this is on FreeBSD using
the UFS file system..

thanks for any help,
Brent

I'll bet /var is taking up all that space.  Clear out old logs and stuff 
if they're still there.

The best answer to that question depends on the distribution you're 
using.  I'd probably just put the ifconfig lines in rc.local myself.

Does your rsync support the --link-dest option?

Vram,

   Run 'ls /var/log/packages' and see if anything is returned. If so, it's
Slackware. If so, I can loan you the 10.2 disk set so you can upgrade it to
the latest release. Of course, 11.0 is almost out, but that won't matter on
this box.

   That's interesting. Wonder what's in /data that requires comparatively
little space. I would also clean out /tmp to free more space on /.

   If it's Slackware, you'll find all the init scripts in /etc/rc.d/; look
particularly at /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1

   Let's see if this is help.

The occasional help wanted post has always been welcome here (at least 
as long as I've been here), especially when it's for someplace doing 
interesting work that has the potential to be at the cutting edge of things.

One of these days I'll be looking for a new laptop. I've never bothered 
to look at Apple stuff since when I started out I couldn't afford it, 
and now am trying to focus on Linux. But, for the time being I'm stuck 
having to live with some Win only stuff. So, I'd be interested in a box 
designed to support more than one OS.

Perhaps one day, if you have a free Sunday afternoon, you could bring 
the laptop to the PLUG clinic at Free Geek and show it off.

Auke,

   Progress report follows.

   I'm working my way through the ALSA FAQ. The contents of /proc/asound/cards
and /proc/asound/devices appear correct; at least, there's content in there.

   Converted a .mp3 to .wav using mpg123, but aplay produced no sound, either.

   Just ran 'speaker-test -Dplug:front -c2', per the suggestion on that FAQ
page. The result is:

ALSA lib pcm.c:1959(snd_open_conf) Invalid type for PCM front definition (id:
front, value: cards.pcm.front)
Playback open error: -22,Invalid argument

   Can someone interpret this for me so I understand what's missing and what
needs to be done to fix the problem?

Rich

Oh joy, an old, exposed system.  Backup data, then run chkrootkit.

Try: 
 cat /etc/issue
 cat /etc/*-version
 cat /etc/*-release

Try: 
 du / -x --max-depth=1 
Check /root, /tmp, /var/tmp and /var/log for stuff you can get rid of.

Make sure the data is safe.  Looks like it's all on a single SCSI disc,
so make a backup YESTERDAY.  From a box nearby with enough free space, do: 
 ssh root at web_server "tar -zc /" > web_server.tar.gz

If it's redhat, check /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:0 for an
"onboot=yes" or some such.

I just bought a box from FreeGeek yesterday.  Anyone know how to
resolve this issue?

sh-3.00$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.

Since you only requested a single operation it is extremely likely that
the package is simply not installable and a bug report against
that package should be filed.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  openssh-server: Depends: openssh-client (= 1:4.1p1-7ubuntu4) but
1:4.1p1-7ubuntu4.1 is to be installed
E: Broken packages

Do I need to edit my sources.list file or something?

Chris

Chris,

Try this:

sudo apt-get install openssh-server

It will try and force the needed packages.

This one looks more like his APT sources does not have a link to the
packages it needs.  Check the file /etc/apt/sources.list and make sure all
of the deb locations are uncommented and then run apt-get update and then
apt-get install ....

Thank you Christian,

It was me trying to download it.  I have succeeded in the deed and it 
didn't work on the old machine.
I will download it again and see if something is wrong with the first 
download.  I am glad to see you had a typo (read brain fart) on the 
location.  I kept receiving an error 404 (basically means "taint there 
sport!).

I saw that there was a mailing list late last night, after I emailed the
plug list.  I've now subscribed.

It did in theory.. I was using version 2.5.6, which after getting your
clue about link-dest found had some issues; I updated to 2.6.7 and now
the snapshots are a mere 0.5% of the original, much, much better (and
they take considerably less time to process to)

Thanks for your help!

I downloaded Archie after Ken's suggestions on how to use wget.  Burned 
a CD.  Tried to run live on my old K6II 350.
I watched it boot, start to load Archie, a few dots across the screen, 
and it reset my machine.  I watched this twice before I stopped the process.
I must need to go back and reread the article on distros and old machines.

some hints on boot problems -

some old boxes don't like the iso boot sequence with 2.88 emulated floppies (el torito). Most of them prefer an upgraded bios - I've succesfully booted p200 boxes that seemed completely dead at first this way (wouldn't even start loading the kernel e.g.)

always assume your bios is broken first, nobody back in the days knew how to implement acpi properly and the bios tables often are futzed. While windows will load (because it just remaps everything) linux might fail (it actually tries to follow the bios info). So good hints are to disable acpi and apic (boot with noapic noacpi for starters). 

I'm sure there are more tricks but these are the ones that get most of my systems going.

Thanks, Auke,

The box has successfully load Slax and SimplyMepis with only minor mouse 
issues.  Has something to do with this particular disk or maybe it 
doesn't like Archie for some reason

I forgot if you mentioned what processor you have, but I'm pretty sure
Archie will runs on Pentium III or newer.

Sorry if these min. requirements exceed your hardware :-(

   Thanks, Evan. I had tried the cs4232 module (based on extensive reports
found on Google. Then I let alsaconf do its thing, and it found a different
driver.

   Apparently I now have some OSS drivers and some ALSA drivers, but not
enough of either. So, I'm compiling a new kernel (2.4.32) and will start over
again.

   The reports turned up on Google searches are really confusing. A lot of
folks report success with the cs4232 driver. Others (I think on the ALSA
site) say that it's the 4636 driver, despite the system reporting it needs
the 46xx driver.

Many thanks,

Rich

Rich, 

On my 600E, I used the OSS driver "cs4232". This is the relevant kernel

             -> OSS sound modules (SOUND_OSS [=m])   

As I recall, it has to be compiled as a module, and it needs to be
unloaded and reloaded at runtime in order for sound to play.

Good luck,

Great memory Christian,

I do have a box running dual 933s.  The box I tried to run Archie on is 
an AMD K6II 350.  It was worth a try!

Subject: [PLUG] Scanning and OCR in Linux
Message-ID: <20060408114827.602c36db.johnxj@comcast.net>

Scanning works better than under Windows. OCR sucks rocks.

As far as I can tell there are only two OCR "engines" for Linux, gocr and ocrad. Both might work better if I could get them to use a dictionary. I can't find any way to get ocrad to use a dictionary at all. Gocr will, but only under Kooka (not XSane), and it won't use any dictionary that I have installed. That's because you have to choose the dictionary in a drop-down box that you can't type into, and none of the OO.o dictionaries are listed.  Plus there is a bug in Kooka that requires you to close and restart the program for each page you OCR.

I do realize the OCR software is incredibly complicated. Outfits like Aabbyy, OmniPage, and others have spent many milliions of dollars on programmer salaries to develop their OCR engines. 

One of my big complaints, however, is that, even if the OCR engine worked well, you can't get it to work because the GUI is not implemented correctly. In Kooka, for example, you can click on a button and sometimes absolutely nothing happens. What passes for documentation sometimes doesn't even explain what a button is supposed to do. As far as I can tell the programmer just put some of the buttons on the interface and never got around to writing the code to make them do anything.

So are there any other Linux OCR choices besides ocrad and gocr? (I include command line tools, as long as I can figure out how to use them; i.e., they come with understandable documentation.) Or are there any commercial OCR utilities that will run under Linux? Or should I hire a typist to keyboard stuff into the computer for me?

Right now I have used XSane (a very nice utility) to scan the 35 pages I need to TIFF files. XSane does a great job. I used TIFF because I know Windows OCR utilities can OCR from a TIFF without needing a scanner. So, push come to shove, I can move the TIFFs to the Windows computer and finish up there. But there must be something that works under Linux. Someone please help me be a Linux purist.

John,

Which version of linux are you running? If it is a Debian based distro, 
try clara. Goto www.google.com/linux and search for clara. Goto the 
packages.debian.org/unstable.... site. it will tell you more about it. I 
have not tried it but it looks pretty good. Also, in the future include 
your version of Linux (Slackware, Debian, RedHat etc.) This will help 
others to help you better.

I can't find any way to get ocrad to use a dictionary at all. Gocr will, but only under Kooka (not XSane), and it won't use any dictionary that I have installed. That's because you have to choose the dictionary in a drop-down box that you can't type into, and none of the OO.o dictionaries are listed.  Plus there is a bug in Kooka that requires you to close and restart the program for each page you OCR.

As far as I can tell the programmer just put some of the buttons on the interface and never got around to writing the code to make them do anything.

But there must be something that works under Linux. Someone please help me be a Linux purist.

Have you successfully mixed Debian Sid packages with Ubuntu packages?  I 
read that it's risky -- some might work, others might break and possibly 
muck things up in general.  I've been too chicken to try it, though if I 
do I think I would download and install individual packages rather than 
  adding Debian sources to my sources.list

Yes, I have mixed the ubuntu and debian packages, just not sid packages. 
Sid is a little risky, even for debian systems.

Is a K6II considered i686?  I don't know the older AMD classifications, 
I just know that anything Pentium 3 or greater is i686.  Arch Linux is 
an i686-optimized distro.  There's a port for i586, but I don't know how 
far along it is.

Hopefully someone else can answer that question.  It might be i686.  I 
had a 5x86 that was nothing more than an over clocked 486 (both AMD) and 
it was a smokin machine for it's time.

More research necessary.

The fact of the matter is that I am experimenting to see what the old 
girl will run.  At this point in time she is exhausting herself running 
XPPro...she's tough but struggling with the newer software.  More memory 
would certainly not hurt...Did someone say Free Geek?

486 != 586 - they are really different instruction sets making them different. 
If you run generic x86 code (==i386) it will work (of course) but back then 
nobody was using -march=i586 anyway.

run `arch` on it and it will show the correct value:

$ arch
i586

k6 and k6-2 are not 100% i686. In theory most i686 software will work - 
especially if generically compiled with "sane" optimizations. But at random 
intervals you may experience the horrible "Illegal Instruction" errors.

Just ran Archie (on a PC that already has Arch running) and it seemed to
have some issues recognizing my video card (nVidia that works well with
Arch).  I did 'telinit 3; telinit5' a bunch of times and X acted like it
wanted to start, but kept crashing.

Sorry.  Guess a full installation is the only way to see Arch in action, for
now.

Also, am pretty sure a K6II is not a flavor of i686 (i.e. will not be
supported).

That's okay.  I very much appreciate the help.  If this won't work, we 
will try something else.  I will install Arch on this computer (the dual 
933) and give it a go that way.  My curiosity has the best of me now.

I seem to have about 30,000 attempts from that IP.  I have about 20,00
from some lady at a university in Spain and about 10,000 from Level 3
Communications in Broomfield Colorado. I would assume the last two
probably don't even know that they are trying.  ZOMBIES! ZOMBIES
everywhere! Where is my chainsaw and boom stick from S-mart? ;) Kind of
odd but I never even got unknown queries until 5 days ago.

bots scan the net for open ports and services then launch automated
attacks, you'd be suprised at how frequent and common it is

At times i'm amazed at the comments/replies from Americans,
how they thing we are so 'rich' and forget their are other
countries way above the US. But then they are not spending
their currency on the things we are.

Pete,

I am sure that like in other countries, some of our people are just 
plain old idiots. Unfortunately, for us all, they have gotten themselves 
one of those computer thingies. (Of course those types tend to refer to 
the monitor as a "computer") I apologize on behalf of the US.

Thanks fof the suggestion. I am using Ubuntu-64 Breezy. Sorry, I should have stated that at the beginning. Culpa mea.

As for clara, it is listed in Synaptic, so I installed it. However, it did not create a menu item in the gnome panel to launch it. No problem, I opened a terminal and typed "clara." That resulted in a window popping up, then immediately disappearing, and a message in the terminal window "segmentation fault." Evidently clara does not like something on my computer. :(

In the meantime, I have been googling on OCR and linux and discovered a few things, the most significant of which is that abbyy has released a development kit for Linux, and evidently it is free:

http://www.abbyy.com/for_developers/?param=28804

In the Windows world, abbyy's  FineReader is considered the best OCR software for the individual desktop. There are others that run a close second, but FineReader is held as the one to beat. So now it's time for the Linux proggers to create an interface for the abbyy OCR engine.

In the meantime, I guess I have to rely on Windows to do OCR.

Oops. I didn't see that. Oh well. Back to square one. I personally 
wouldn't mind paying a few bux for their copyright, but not if it 
requires activation. That means that sometime in the future they'll 
move to a monthly licensing fee.

Bruce, as always, e-mail me off-line (or use  the  toll-free number -- as
I'm out of town a lot) if you have any questions about installation /

Here are a couple of quick reads that will help you know what you're getting
into:

   I managed to miss specifying generic_serial when I built my custom kernels
(2.4.32 and 2.6.16). I need that driver for the pci serial card (the
motherboard has only one serial port on it). It's been so long since I built
a single driver as a module.

   One reference found on Google suggests that I use:
gcc -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__ -O6 -c generic_serial.c
but that results in:

generic_serial.c:1083: error: syntax error before
"this_object_must_be_defined_as_export_objs_in_the_Makefile"

Shame, that.  The state of voice-recognition is pretty poor, too.
Reading the Oregonian's "Ooh! Shiny! Windows Vista!" article, that was
the one feature that wasn't already available on Linux.

Wine has a SANE-TWAIN interface, so Winders apps can use scanners in
Linux.  I wonder if that could be made to work with an OCR app?  Might
be a fun project for some Linux Clinic or something.

It has nothing to do with America IMHO.  Idiots are everywhere.

I later found the following site:

http://www.simpleocr.com/Demo/

If you upload a scan from XSane as a black and white TIFF at about 300 dpi it does a pretty good job on the bare text. Unlike the sophisticated OCR utilities available on Windows, however, it blows away pictures and even tables. Can't even handle tabs or columns. It also has no "learning" abilities. But it's better than retyping. And I used it for the 35 pages I needed to do, so I was able to avoid having to use Windows.

Pehaps a web-based interface is the future for OCR on Linux? Maybe it could be made a feature of OpenOffice.org? That way, while we're hitting Bill Gates in his cash cow, MS Office, we can hit Abbyy (FineReader) and Nuance (Omnipage) at the same time.

That reminds me. How are we doing on getting the word out other 
than on this list? Are there signs at Free Geek? I wonder if the 
computer science departments at schools would put up a notice on 
their bulletin boards if we asked them. Can anyone think of 
anyplace else? The point I am trying to make is that if we want 
converts, getting publicity for the clinic is important.

I would just do another make menuconfig or its equivalent and enable the
additional driver, followed by make modules.  Then you can copy the module
to the appropriate spot in /lib/modules.  It's probably safe to do
make modules_install, but I won't guarantee it.

I know there's a more direct way, but a quick search didn't find it.

Galen,

   OK. I thought I'd have to rebuild the kernel as well; obviously I didn't
think it all through.

> I know there's a more direct way, but a quick search didn't find it.

   This looks sufficiently direct. Now I need to find where in the .config
file that driver is hidden.

Many thanks,

Rich

I've been ramping up the publicity a bit each month so we don't get
slammed.  I'd like to put up flyers this month, though I haven't yet
come up with a design I like.  This is a good time to start doing that.

I was thinking of making a bunch of B&W quarter-sheet flyers and leave
stacks at FG, around campus and at coffeehouses where laptops gather.

I have free laser-printing at school, and a small quota of color prints.
Maybe a few 8.5x11 flyers with some color to catch the eye?

Get me an email version of the flyer and I can get it to Lincoln High School.  A 
printed (or printable) version would be better.  I will be there on Thursday PM.

   Here are what I think are the relevant options, as found in .config:

CONFIG_SERIAL=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_EXTENDED=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_MANY_PORTS=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_SHARE_IRQ=y
# CONFIG_SERIAL_DETECT_IRQ is not set
# CONFIG_SERIAL_MULTIPORT is not set
# CONFIG_SERIAL_NONSTANDARD is not set

   Everything else relates to USB serial converters. Might I want to set
SERIA_MULTIPORT to get the generic_serial module built? (There's nothing
relevant when I grep for GENERIC in .config.)

Thanks,

Rich

If you use make menuconfig, you'll have the benefit of the help text that
describes some of the options.

Not to mention that some of the options in .config are enabled
automatically as dependencies.  You really should be using one of the
make *config options (config, menuconfig, xconfig, etc.).

How about just posting the flyer on the web so the rest of us can get 
it. I'm sure we can post it many places.. but many of us don't travel in 
the usual circles that normal geeks travel in.

Hey guys...

Interesting question here for you. (Well actually two of them.)

Does anybody else encounter severe AM interference when dealing with 
wireless devices? (aka laptops, bluetooth devices, etc.)

Does anybody randomly encounter a dah-dah-de-dit-dit on their radio?

Anybody know what that is, or know how to counter it?

You don't by chance have a GSM cell phone, do you?  I get all kinds of
speaker interference with my phone.

Can't say I've had any from bluetooth, but I also tend to listen to FM radio.

Do you have a Mororola Razr cell phone?  I have seen that model cause that 
exact problem.  Don't know exactly why.

It isn't Razr specific.  I have a Razr, but my wife has a Sony
Ericsson which does the same thing.  Rather annoying really, since the
speaker on our alarm clock is apparently always powered, so if we
leave one of our phones near it overnight we get awakened rather
rudely.

It seems (from my searches online) to be a "feature" of GSM having to
do with the periodic (once an hour?) "ping" between the phone and the
tower.  I would have thought they would ping more often than that, but
what do I know.

I have an LG phone, but it the only time it makes that noise is when 
it's about to ring or when I'm dialing and put my phone next to a speaker.

galen,

   That gave me no insight. The help described intelligent serial boards and
non-standard boards. Nothing that clued me in to what builds
generic_serial.c. So, I keep looking.

Rich -

generic_serial.c is enabled by enabling one of the drivers that
requires it.  Look in drivers/char/Makefile to see which drivers
enable generic_serial.  You will have to turn on at least one of those
CONFIG_* options in your .config.

NOTE: I am looking at a 2.6 kernel, I am not sure how much of this
applies to 2.4.

Jason,

   Thank you for the suggestion. I've done that and cannot find where in
menuconfig those drivers are to be found. For example, in
/usr/src/linux-2.4.32/drivers/char/Makefile I find these:

obj-$(CONFIG_A2232) += ser_a2232.o generic_serial.o
obj-$(CONFIG_SX) += sx.o generic_serial.o
obj-$(CONFIG_RIO) += rio/rio.o generic_serial.o
obj-$(CONFIG_SH_SCI) += sh-sci.o generic_serial.o
obj-$(CONFIG_MVME147_SCC) += generic_serial.o vme_scc.o
obj-$(CONFIG_MVME162_SCC) += generic_serial.o vme_scc.o
obj-$(CONFIG_BVME6000_SCC) += generic_serial.o vme_scc.o
obj-$(CONFIG_SERIAL_TX3912) += generic_serial.o serial_tx3912.o
obj-$(CONFIG_SERIAL_TXX9) += generic_serial.o serial_txx9.o

   But, I find no reference to any of these under Char devices in menuconfig.
This makes no sense to me, but I've looked several times.

   The A2232, for example, appears to be a serial card for Amigas. BVME6000 is
apparently other hardware (Debian supports them). Perhaps I can't see it
until it bites me in the nose, but I cannot find where any of these can be
selected for building.

   Aha! Found this puppy. Built and installed generic_serial.o manually.
Loaded module (with insmod; modprobe couldn't find it), and now the second
serial port is seen as /dev/ttyS4.

   Thank you Galen and Jason ... and anyone else I forgot to mention by name.

Perhaps a different approach is in order.  What kind of hardware are
you trying to enable?  generic_serial.c (as far as I can tell) is not
a driver, but a support file used by other drivers.

Jason,

   It's a 2 port, pci, 16C550 serial card by StarTech.com for which I paid
more than 3 times what I used to buy them for 20 years ago. That was my last
purchase from that local vendor.

   Anywho, it's working now.

Thanks,

Rich

I have a nokia phone... it will cause interference if I set it near a 
powered speaker (through the speaker, not the phone) As for the 
bluetooth/wireless on a laptop... no, I have not heard of this 
happening, but it is possible.

Looks good, but the "Sunday 1-5pm" might make some people think it is 
"this" Sunday and be mad when it is next Sunday or the Sunday after(etc.)

Suggest that you drop the day reference and let them get it from the website.

Thanks

I think you mean 'wget -m' for mirror.  It will make a folder 
automatically based on the name of the site where ever you run the 
command from and put everything in there.

'wget --help' is your friend.

We should also probably have somebody update the web site with the
information.  The FAQ still references Riverdale High School and there is
no information on the main page about the clinic.

That command will not do what you want it to. '-c' is for continuing a 
failed download.

But I would recommend against doing a site grab, it does not guarantee 
you will get all the files. You'll only get files that have a link from 
another page on the site.

Your best option is to Tar the directory on the original server and 
download that. If you're being hosted and do not have cli access, I 
would ask the tech support to Tar it up for you - it only takes a few 
seconds.


> Also, where does it go if I have just entered in the command above?

It would go to the current directory.

If you don't have access to the command line it might be good to look
for another host..  but until then I'd also recommend using rsync.

Indeed. This was mentioned some time ago, but I see it has not yet been done. Also, I don't see it mentioned yet on Free Geek's website. But I understand people are busy, so don't take this as a kvetch.

There  was discussion on Slashdot about this recently:
http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/04/07/2111217

Apparently TDMA (and thus GSM and iDEN/Nextel) devices frequently do
this. The solution is to move the phone further away or shield better.

I've personally experienced this frequently with GSM or Nextel phones
and cheap computer speakers.

Subject: [PLUG] Help me help a hapless WinXP user
Message-ID: <443C5A84.3030500@writemoore.net>

I have a friend in New York that I'm collaborating on something with.  
Most of what we need to do we can do through email, but it's getting to 
the point where it would be really useful for me to be able to transfer 
files to (and sometimes retrieve from) his computer by other means.  He 
has a recent Dell running Windows XP Home.

The thing is, my friend ... well, how do I put this?  He was a 
successful Wall Street stockbroker for about 15 years.  He speaks 
English, French and German fluently, and Spanish and Italian passably.  
He has a B.A. in English Lit from Williams College and an M.A. in Comp. 
Lit from NYU.  He's a great cook and a creative and capable gardener.  
Put him in front of a computer, and your typical 4-year-old could 
probably manage better than he can.  He can do the basics of word 
processing -- by that I mean, he can type on a keyboard and the words 
will appear in the document, which he is capable of saving.  He can just 
about manage to use AOL, though not without some difficulty.  A typical 
statement is, "I think I downloaded something, but I don't know where it 
went."  At one point, I created a folder on his desktop which I named 
"DOWNLOADS" and I directed any and all downloads from any AOL source 
there.  He still couldn't find them.  I had him using Ubuntu for about 
six months and he did as well there as he does in Windows -- which is to 
say, he just about got by.  I did everything that might loosely be 
termed "administration" for him.

I really don't know much of anything about Windows to Linux networking, 
and since I don't have a Windows machine at my disposal I can't 
experiment.  Is there something that I could walk him through the set-up 
of that would enable me to move files back and forth without having to 
depend upon him doing anything except providing me with his IP address 
if it changes?  Setting up an ftp server on his machine would probably 
test our friendship, I was hoping for an easier solution.  I found 
copSSH, which doesn't look too difficult, though by default it would 
restrict me to a single directory.  Getting him to move what I need to 
that directory would be an on-going hassle, given that he just doesn't 
grasp the concept of "directories."  Ideally, I would be able to have 
any and all remote-desktop capabilities, but I think Windows only 
provides that from one Windows machine to another, and even then only in 
XP Professional.  You would think, given how often Windows machines get 
p'wned, that there ought to be an easy way to voluntarily hand over 
privileges to someone you want to be able to access your machine.  
Anyone have any suggestions?

TIA

The 'rdesktop' program can be used to connect to an RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) server, which is what WinXP uses for desktop sharing. It's free/OSS, I use it to connect to my family's PCs and help them with issues now and then.

I had forgotten how annoying this feature is with phones that employ TDMA. I 
recall years ago with my old analog phone it would cause my computer speakers 
to make noise anytime an incoming call came in. I had CDMA service for 
several years and it never affected my speakers but recently I switched over 
to GSM service with Cingular and so I'm back to having speaker noise.

I even managed to annoy everyone in a meeting one day when my phone was 
causing the speaker within the tabletop speaker-phone to make a bunch of 
noise even though it wasn't online with a call. I had to move my phone 
several feet away before the noise finally stopped. :(

Here is a fun one for you... :)

For about two years I was in charge of the media aspects of my church. 
Which meant that every Sunday I was sitting in front of the old analog 
sound board, video presentation, and light controller. My timer for 
church service that I used was my Cingular PDA phone. It was usually 
placed on top of the sound board so we could see the time. Unfortunately 
quite often during the middle of the church service the sound 
interference would get broadcast throughout the entire church!!

So now cellular phones are not allowed in the sound booth!!

Indeed.  I'd like to see a reference to it on the front page, along with
a link to map/directions (e.g. on FG's site).  I don't believe I have
access to the PLUG site to change that, though.

   I've tried to send an email message with .pdf attachments to someone at an
organization that runs only Microsoft. Apparently, whatever malware detector
they've installed and configured sees that file extension as something
dangersous, so the messages are not delivered to the intended recipient. I'm
not the only one whose mail with innocuous attachments ends up in the bit
bucket.

   Is this common in the Microsoft world, or could they have mis-configured
whatever they're using?

Just curious,

Rich

Yes to both.  I haven't the faintest idea why they'd block PDFs, but
basically everything useful Winders users would want to attach to email
(.DOC, .XLS, .ZIP, .JPG) has been used to carry viruses/worms.

I've seen mail setups that filter most attachments, put 'em on a web
server and substitute an URL in the message.  Also helps with those
pesky "Ooh!  Everyone look at this 10MB video!" email storms.

   I have read that all Microsoft document formats have been compromised;
didn't realize that .jpg files are also in that category. I suppose that
since nothing Microsoft puts out is immune to being mis-used, the assumption
is that everyone sends only malware. "Your productivity ... our passion."
Yeah. Right.

We had a system that blocked files like that but we had to e-mail within
the company to share information and programs from multiple sites.

What we did was rename the file without the extension, send that file
and tell the user on the other end to save and rename it.
Worked well because the filtering system didn't inspect the contents and
the e-mail virus scanners won't (will they?) find anything wrong with the file.

   Ooo, good idea! Think I'll try that.

Malware authors need productivity and passion, too.

Windoze is too brain-dead to determine the file type by itself, so it relies 
on extensions. So you'll see weird filenames like foo.jpg.exe. And yes, a lot 
of common file types have been compromised in ways that don't require weirdo 
filenames. Windows happily runs any stray executable, whether or not you want 
it too. Microsoft's feeble efforts to lock it down have succeeded in making 
it even more mysterious to users and admins, but hasn't done a thing to slow 
down its affinity for all the wrong things. It's a form of perversity that 
has almost reached the level of art.

Subject: [PLUG] Interesting Samba problem
Message-ID: <200604121204.32233.ladyfractal@yahoo.com>

Hey folks:

A customer of mine is using a version control product that I support in a 
mixed platform environment.  All of their repositories live on a UNIX file 
system and are mounted by Samba.  The clients are all using development tools 
on Windows machines so when they save their source files to the Samba mount 
they are getting the EOL (^M) character thrown in which makes their build 
scripts complain and then die.  The particular version of the versioning 
software they are using does not have a built-in 'translate EOL' function and 
I was wondering if anyone might know of a hack to make Samba do the heavy 
lifting.  

I initially thought a shell script but that won't work because when the source 
code file is written to the archive library as read-only.  If it can't be 
done, it can't be done and they'll have to continue transferring their source 
code files as binary but I'd like for them to not have to do so.

Thanks in advance.

Cheers
Aj

Aj,

   There is a pair of great linux tools called dos2unix and unix2dos
(Slackware has them as todos and tounix) that translate EOLs from one flavor
to the other. How these can be used in a solution for you is up to folks much
smarter than I am about these things.

Back when I did a lot of Samba. I remember the Samba development team 
not being keen on this idea. It's riddled with problems. I would agree 
with them. IIRC there is a hook in the conf - but IMO it's a deal with 
the devil (M$ pun intended).

I would not recommend saving files as binaries. Binary files are 
versioned as an entire file (AFAIK in most version control systems). So 
you'll end up bloating the repo.

The best solution as I see it, would be if their development environment 
would be able to deal with *nix style line endings and have them switch 
to that.

If that is not an option - other options I can think of:
Switch to a version control system that understands line end translations.
run dos2unix before your 'make' - either find a way to run it on the 
repo or do a check out - conversion - check in

Christian

I don't know the environment but it seems like they are copying files back and
forth for check-in/out and sandbox development.

If the revision system is cvs or svn, I would recommend TortoiseCVS or
TortoiseSVN.

I had very good experiences with TortoiseCVS working in Linux and windows.  Had
to share some of the library and header code between client (Linux)
and server (windows).

Rich:

What I usually do if I have to send a customer/user something like a DOS batch 
file or Bash shell script, both of which my employer filters out, is to 
rename the attachment to .txt or, if a binary, simply remove the extension 
altogther.  I'll then tell the recipient, save the file as type foo and all 
the right things happen.

Adrienne,

   I've sent the attachments without a filename extension. We'll see what
happens. The direct recipient is out of the office now, but I forwarded
copies to the front desk, too.

Hello!

If my memory is correct Windows XP Pro has the ability to remotely hook up to 
another computer and allow the remote person to do things to that computer 
just like they were sitting in front of it. If this is true which I am pretty 
sure it is - I saw it demonstrated on "The Screensavers some years ago - then 
you could get control of the computer and use the ftp client on that computer 
to transfer the files to it. Of course you would have to have the files on a 
server somewhere.

Hello PLUG!

Some of you might remember me.  I'm working at IBM in New York now,
administering Linux clusters and testing IBM's cluster management software
on them.

There are two Linux sysadmin positions open here right now, and apparently
they're having trouble finding people.  If any of you folks would like to
work at IBM, here is your chance (see below).  I am VERY happy here --
much more so than I ever was at Intel.

The below announcement is from CTG -- the company that supplies all of
IBM's sysadmin personnel.  They pay relocation expenses.

Please give the recruiter (contact info below) my name when applying so
that I can get my referral bonus.

Thanks,

Ken Barber, RHCE

Hi Ken -


If you know of anyone with a Linux, specifically RedHat Linux certified,
that might be interested in a position at IBM in Poughkeepsie, please
let them know that we have two openings available.  We're having a
somewhat difficult time finding folks.

Message-ID: <200604131024.24873.ladyfractal@yahoo.com>

Greetings:
I was thinking about founding a local chapter of LinuxChix (http://www.linuxchix.org/). The purpose of LinuxChix, from their homepage is:

LinuxChix is a community for women who like Linux, and for supporting women in computing. The membership ranges from novices to experienced users, and includes professional and amateur programmers, system administrators and technical writers.

I'm throwing this out to the list to see if there is interest in creating a Portland LinuxChix chapter. If you are a woman on the list and think this is something you would like to see and/or be involved in, please respond to me directly. If you know of any women who are or might be interested, please forward this email to them. Thanks in advance.

Cheers
Aj

Subject: [PLUG] Any GIMP Gurus Here?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0604131139290.20219@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have an image (.jpg, .png, .gif ... any flavor that'll work) and I want
to draw a red circle around the existing image. I use the elliptical
selection tool and create the circle (holding the shift key as I drag the
selection). Next, I apply Edit->Stroke selection. That gives me a nice 6 px
width on the circle.

   But, I cannot color that rim. I can fill the circle with a color, but that
obscures the image below. Rather than having the disk filled, I want only the
border filled with color. According to the GIMP help, I'm doing the correct
things, but I'm seeing the expected results.

   Any ideas?

Rich

I don't know.  I only know what they're paying ME, which is a good deal
more than I ever made in Oregon (10K more than what I made at Intel). 
Cost of living here is about 1.1 times the cost of living in Portland.

   Sigh. As is so often the case, I discovered the solution immediately after
sending the original message. What I had to do was swap the fg and bg colors
before creating the circle. Once I did that, and chose a solid like for the
stroke selection, there it was in red. Ta-da!

Subject: [PLUG] So Long And Thanks For All The FIsh
Message-ID: <443EA9A3.4070305@frankhunt.com>

I recently accepted an offer to return to Hewlett Packard (I was "Carly'd" after 26 years as a result of the Compaq merger a few years back) and join their Technical Solutions Group as a Workstation Community Liaison for the CAE organization at GM in North America and Europe (part of the GM outsourcing contract with HP).  I am leaving on Sunday so to be in place on the 17th of April, most likely living at the Marriott for a few weeks until I can find a more permanent location.  My family will join me later this summer.
 
Although I have yet to attend a PLUG meeting, I feel that I have gained significant technical insight and valuable help as a member of this forum.  I'll probably stay on the list and just "lurk" for a bit - never know when help will be needed. 

Best to all . . .

   Well! Good for you. I hope that GM survives for as long as you want to work
there. You might also want to check out the Onion's article on Detroit being

   We've had folks move away but stay subscribed. We've also had participants
from Quebec, Belgium, and the Phillipines, so you'll be well within the
distribution range.

Happy new job,

Subject: [PLUG] Copying Hard Disk to Hard Disk
Message-ID: <443F0D84.6060904@comcast.net>

My wife has a 4GB hard drive on her Win98 machine and needs more room. 
The simple solution was to add a 13GB drive as a second drive. 
Unfortunately, she needs to run a disk space hogging program that will 
only install on the "C" drive (and is only available for Winders).

My question:

Can I boot up the machine with Knoppix (or similar) and copy the first 
drive to the second in a way that, when I swap the drives, the second 
drive boots just as if it was the first drive, but is now 13GB? (I would 
swap cables and adjust jumpers on the drives.)

If so, what command do I use, and how do I log in to Knoppix in a way 
that lets me do this? (I assume I need to log in, or SU to root, but I 
don't know the Knoppix root password.

Thanks for any advice.

Dick Steffens

I've been too busy with an illness in the family to do get anywhere with

suggested as soon as I can.

Sure!  Just login to windows as root and mount C:\\Program\ 
Files\\directory\ name\\here\\ to a partition on the new drive.  Oh, 
wait...  nevermind that.

Sure, but you have to transfer the boot sector or else use the windows 
rescue disk to put a boot sector on the new drive.  IIRC, it is 
somewhat dependent on the drive geometry, so it may be easiest to use 
the startup disk instead of dd.

the partition modifying software should (gpart?  i don't remember).
How is that for specific step-by-step instructions?

BTW: su to root doesn't need a password on Knoppix.

Ghost4Linux has bootable ISO images for download. It does either local
or networked disk cloning. A quick peek says if you clone from a
smaller disk to a larger disk, it will leave "some space" (their
words; not very descriptive) unallocated. It uses partimage, according
to the docs, so if Knoppix has that, you might just try it directly.

GNU Parted can resize FAT partitions.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/g4l
http://www.gnu.org/software/parted

Optionally, you could find somebody with Norton/Symantec Ghost, which
can resize partitions during a clone.

Nice thing is, you can afford to screw it up as long as you leave the
original disk alone.

Yes.  Boot to DOS by pressing F8 just as Windows starts to load, you 
must be quick.  Run FDISK and set the primary partition on the D:\ drive 
to "Active".  Exit FDISK and do "format d: /q /s".  This will quick 
format the drive and make it bootable.  I know on floppies you can just 
do "sys a:" and it will make the disk a system disk (bootable) w/o the 
format, but I can't remember if that works on hard drives.  It's worth a 
try.  If it doesn't work it will just tell you you can't do that.

Now boot to Knoppix and just copy everything over.  Note; I didn't say 
move.  You will get a few files being over written (the boot files), 
that's ok.  The /s option on the format command was still necessary.

Now reboot after swapping your cables and boot to the larger drive to 
verify all went well.

If you're a whiz at partition editing then the dd/image method may be 
fastest.  But this method isn't far behind at all.

Message-ID: <443F8825.1050509@acm.org>

Ref: SATA verses SCSI Drives and RAID.

Well I've decided to go for the SCSI ( which I was inclined to do anyway. )

I am now in the process of pricing out a system from PogoLinux.  The 
SCSI RAID cards they offer on the system I'm looking at are LSI MegaRAID 
320-2's.  Not the 2E.  After going to the LSI site I still can'd 
determine if the the card will rebuild the raid 'on the fly' from a hot 
spare or a hot swapped drive.

Do any of you have experience with or knowledge about the LSI MegaRAID 
cards?

The case used by PogoLinux supports hot swap but my recent experience 
with RAID has been in the MS Windows world ( and it wasn't a pleasant 
experience ) so I'm pretty much doing a SWAG on what-does-what in the 
_real_ RAID world.


TIA,
Rod

It seems the two places in the process that would be easiest to work with 
are before/at checkin and before/at build.  Would it be possible to add a 
precommit script that does the EOL conversion?  CVS allows this, I assume 
other SCM tools do as well. Or add a convert script as a precursor to 
make?  I've taken this route several times.

Dick,

   It appears that you've received excellent advice from those who know how to
work with Winduhs. In my naivete about such things, I'd like to throw out a
suggestion of a different sort.

   If you install the larger drive as secondary to the existing one (d:\, I
believe it would be), could you not copy over most of the applications and
all of the data from the original drive and leave that for booting and the
user-unfriendly application that insists on being there and taking up a lot
of room?

   Moving applications and all data out of the way should be simpler and
easier than recreating the existing system on a larger drive. No?

Rich

This will most likely cause much grief.  As any shortcuts (icon 
symlinks) will point to the old location.  The entire Start menu in 
userland in Windows is all shortcuts, as well as whatever shortcuts were 
put on the desktop over time.

But that's not the worse part.  The installation of anything more than a 
very simple small program 99% of the time can't just be moved.  Windows 
expects it to be where it was installed at.  The registry or any .ini 
(.conf) files that the program uses to store personal or internal 
configuration info such as paths, would now be wrong as well.

A better approach to this idea would be to use the uninstall utility, 
and remove programs that way.  Applications such as MS Office won't 
delete personal settings, email and such.  It will just remove the 
suite.  Then it could be reinstalled on a different drive and email and 
personalizations will magically return on their own.  Unless you are 
aware of what applications take up the most disk real estate then this 
might be time consuming as well.  Honestly I think my approach is the 
best and easiest, but not for ego.  I do this sort of thing all the time 
so it's easy for me.

I've personally been less-than-impessed with the LSI hardware, mainly
documentation and linux support... these controllers are present on
the Sun v[2|4]0z Opteron systems, and while they work, it took me
quite a while to find _any_ way to determine what the status of the
array is in linux.

There's some java app that you can run, but is GUI based and not
scriptable. I also found a semi un-maintained C source that polls the
driver and outputs a character device with some info... it's not
complete, and was working on a perl app to run and parse that info for
Nagios.

If you end up with one and can't get it to do what you want, drop me a
line.  I'd suggest finding something that has more out-of-the box
support.

PS -- Other than that, the Sun v*z series boxen are _really_ great.

Interesting that the product brief pdf's for both cards state "Automatic 
rebuild of hot spare drives" as a feature.  But it's only listed on the 
web page of the 2E.  I guess it must have it.  Odd for them not stating 
it.  Maybe they want people to buy the more expensive card.

Sorry for not doing it in Linux but I have had great success with a program
called BootIT NG.
http://www.terabyteunlimited.com/bootitng.html
download the iso.  burn to cd.  boot it.  hit esc to get past the
install screen.
Used the utilities to image from one drive to another.

This was the only program that would correctly move one of my office machines.
Four different versions of Ghost and two different versions of Drive
Image failed.
BootIT NG worked and re-sized the partition in the process.  No real
work on my part.

No one cam blame you, Windows is such a wild beast that few care to attempt taming it =)

I actually know some people who use a separate drive for apps and just leave them on that drive when they do the requisite monthly-reinstall of XP to keep things fast and efficient. I'm surprised by the number of programs that will actually run. A lot of games (except a few that put cdkeys in the registry, shame on them) and most general purpose apps (excepting anything M$ like office, of course)

But I too have lost some of my Wind0ze skills over the years as I see less and less of it in my happily almost-all-linux world. Can't wait for the rest of the world to see the light =)

Nope.  It is going to be Keith speaking on whatever his talk is for 
LinuxFest.

I will get a notice out soon.  (House buying is eating up my brain and

Sunday, April 23, 2006, which is not this coming Sunday, but the
following one.  After that I assume it will return to its regularly

Great!  It's what it's for!

Someone needs to either update the pdlinux site or give one of us Clinic

Of course, you lose all your registry information when you do that.  Some 
programs do not deal well with that information going away.  Some programs 
used to store their config information in the \windows\system directory. 
(I found that out the hard way with a texture generation program that 
stored everything there.  Lost a whole bunch of non-reproducable work.)

I have to use it at work.  VMWare runtime is helpful though.

The 13GB drive used to be a C: drive with Win98 installed. When I put it 
in her machine, I just erased everything, but didn't format it. I ran 
"sys d:" and got no complaints.

Knoppix reported /dev/hda1 and /dev/hdb1 as mount points. Looking at the 
contents confirmed that hda1 was the C: drive and hdb1 was the D: drive.

I ran:

dd if=/dev/hda1 of=/dev/hdb1 bs=1024k

It completed without complaint.

I left the old 4GB drive disconnected, and put the jumper on the pins to 
indicate the 13GB drive was a primary drive. Then I rebooted and stopped 
by BIOS and ran auto detect on the hard drive.

The machine booted just fine and it looks like everything is there. But, 
  the properties report shows the drive as only 4.02 GB. I rebooted in 
MS-DOS mode and ran fdisk to have it display the partition info. It 
thinks the drive is 13GB.

I re-booted Knoppix, and after a bit of searching on the web, discovered 
that Knoppix 3.2 (that's the CD I have), doesn't have parted. On the 
other hand, it does have qtparted. Sigh. Anyway, I ran that and had a 
look at hda. It shows it to be a 13GB partition, too.

So, while the machine will work for her tomorrow, I'd still like to find 
a way to make Winders realize that there's another 9GB out there it can use!

I looked into this, and tried to follow their directions for making a CD 
image, but I got an error message when I ran mkisofs:

rsteff at dhcppc4:~/2ndDrive/ToBurn/bootitng> mkisofs -R -V "BOOTITNG" -b 
DISKIMG3.DAT -c catfile -o BOOTITNG.ISO -input-charset UTF-8
mkisofs: Missing pathspec.
Usage: mkisofs [options] file...

As I was running out of time, I moved on to using Knoppix.

I'm not sure it would have mattered, though, since for some reason, the 
Knoppix iso image I downloaded and burned today wouldn't boot. At that 
point I dug out the one I got back in July, 2003.

dd is a little lower-level than I think you probably wanted.  It will make a 
perfect image (assuming no errors) of the drive's sectors -- including things 
like the partition table.  

It's why dd is great for making CD and floppy disk images, and for copying 
from one identical drive to another.. but not so much for transferring files.

The best solution, honestly, would be, I think, ghost followed by Partition 
Magic, because they're better at dealing with Microsoft's filesystems.

The Amateur Sky Survey (tass) is closing it's doors.

The reason for posting here is that some of the equipment might be
useful to the scientific community.

The idea of tass was to build camera systems suitable for an all sky
survey and give them away (without software) to programmers found on
the internet. I call this the "Field of Dreams" scheme.  If you
build the systems, the software will come.  The scheme actually
worked. Four dual camera systems were given away and two of the
recipients wrote the code needed. Three dual systems were operated at
Batavia, IL and have taken about 230 million measurements over three
years of stars in the northern sky. Each consists of simultaneous
measurements in V and I in the range of 7 to 15.

The systems consist of two 2k x 2k CCD442A detectors and 100
mm dia f/4 optics on a simple polar mount.  The optics are narrow
band to match the filter used.  This allowed an improved flat field
for the 5 element optics.

The best description is at:

http://www.tass-survey.org/tass/showtell/st0010.html

More information than you can stand at:

http://www.tass-survey.org/tass/tass.shtml

The electronics is home designed and works just fine.  The best I have
done for noise is 10 e- or so but I only cool to -20 C.  No
electronic reason not to get to 3 e- with proper cooling.  The
electronics is 2 channel and there is some cross talk 1/1000 or so.
Not critical for me since I am sky noise limited.  One could always
run single channel systems.  There is lots of spare electronics.

There is lots of stuff available here in Batavia, IL that will go
into the ash can with my impending demise.  I have cancer and it has
gotten to the state that I can no longer scramble up on the roof to
run the telescopes.  There are pretty good drawings for all the parts
and good electronics drawings.

Some of the items:
16 completed and tested 2k x 2k CCD442A cameras.  TEC cooled
each camera has a built in V or I filter.  There are a few spare
  2" x 2" filters.
2 Unused CCD442As lumigen coated, taped windows
16 sets of dual channel electronics.
5 completed dual channel systems
32 lenses various numbers of B, V, I, and R
Of the 20 CCD442A CCDs, most are class 3 but the company was
generous and they are probably better than class 3.  They look very
good to me.
Many computers running on linux.  System requires an ISA slot so I
have a big collection of recent ISA slot computers that run linux.

Contact Tom Droege  droege at fastmail.fm

I will accumulate requests and then give stuff away for the best
science use.

My wife has tested a few programs, and they seem to work correctly. 
She'll give it more of a workout tomorrow. Assuming all that works, then 
it would appear the dd did the same thing that Ghost would have done. 
Does Partition Magic change anything in the registry, or something else, 
that would make the OS recognize what the partition table sees as the 
drive size? Is there some kind of end-of-partition marker that needs to 
move?

The partition table for drives is stored in the first few sectors of the 
drive, so when you dd the drive, you end up with the partition table of the 
old drive (and all it pointed to, including the size) in the new drive's 
image.  You might be able to get away, if you have the new drive already in 
place and "working", just installing Partition magic and resizing the 
drive -- the BIOS seems to recognize the real size of the drive, so it 
shouldn't be a big deal... (shouldn't)

Get a newer Knoppix and look more closely at the parted (or variant)
instructions.  It can resize partitions and filesystems.  I've used it
to help out some people at clinics, so I know it'll work.  It even
works on NTFS.

When I said copy the files over, I didn't mean dd, I meant 'copy' as in 
the command or of the drag-and-drop persuasion.  You will be better off 
to start over and do it the way I said.  It would take all of minutes to 
do outside of the copying of the 4GB of data.  You're sorely over 
complicating this matter.

Finally, an easy way to tell the CEOs why they should stop buying Windows.... heh.

Playing the devil's advocate, what versions of each did they compare? I'm assuming that's apache 2 (IMHO is too bloated and insecure) because apache1 is relatively simple, that looks like way too many calls.

What they should do is make a graph using lighttpd, and one IIS from win2k3. You'd probably actually be able to read the words on the lighttpd one =)

Silly fellow! 
That picture ( http://blogs.zdnet.com/images/SysCallIIS.jpg )
isn't the a graph of system calls for Windows, it's the org
chart for the Department of Homeland Security! 

Or the wiring diagram for my home network.  Or the map to every

hamburgers).

You should see what my Nextel phone does to my computer monitor (old 
CRT, probably seven years old now) right before it rings.  I think I 
freaked out a friend once when I picked up my phone and started to 
answer it before it actually rang while she was sitting there.  :-)

  I'm not sure... The article is a little light on information.  I
tried following the link to Sana Security, but didn't find any info
about the data.  It may be very old.  I still though it was

So, when I boot up Knoppix, which starts up KDE and has icons for each 
connected hard drive, should I have opened those up and dragged the 
contents of the smaller one to the other?

To start over:

1. Delete all the stuff I put on the large drive with dd.

2. Boot up with Knoppix and proceed with the copy as described, above.

Right?

Simpler is better. Thanks for the advice.

Okay... the problem here is you copied over an image of your 4GB hard 
disk on to your 13GB hard disk.  That image contains some magic at the 
start of it that says "I have a single 4GB partition and that is all" so 
your 13GB disk can't be fully realized.  What needs to happen is that 
magic at the beginning of the disk needs to say "I have a 13GB 
partition" and then the filesystem that lives inside that partition 
(FAT32) needs to be fixed to take up the remainder of the single drive 
partition.

Now, you can either resize the existing 4GB partition using some magic 
like parted (which is able to resize partitions) OR you can start from 
scratch.  Repartition the 13GB drive in to a single 13GB partition (with 
fdisk or similar), create a FAT32 partition on it (with mkfs.msdos or 
similar), put the windows boot magic on it (with a DOS floppy and the 
"SYS" command), then *copy* over the *files* from the old disk.  Use cp. 
  Not dd.

Note the format/boot magic steps can be combined with a DOS floppy as 
mentioned by somebody else before using the /s flag in DOS's FORMAT command.

What you need is a filesystem resizer for MSDOS. MSDOS is reporting the
amount of space on the _filesystem_, not the size of the slice. You made
an exact image of the filesystem, including the filesystem structure. The
trick is that structure includes the size.

There are three approaches. First, you can change the size of the slice
to be 4.02GB, and then make a second slice (partition) that would appear
as D: (then use `format D:` to make the filesystem).

Second, you can use a filesystem resizer to enlarge the filesystem. The
one that comes to mind is FIPS, though that was mainly used to shrink
FAT filesystems in the bad olde days. I also haven't seen much mention
of it recently, so I've no idea whether it has been maintained.

Third, you can go back, and create a new filesystem on the disk and
simply copy file by file.

Free, to whoever can provide the transportation... a Samsung CLP-500
color laser printer.  There
might be some toner left, but I don't guarantee anything.  Note that
this is around a 75lb printer,
plan accordingly.

Samsung did ship a linux driver with this printer, but at least at the
time it was released, it was
binary only.  By looking at the install shell script, I was able to get
it to work on a gentoo system,
both 32 bit and 64 bit (using 32 bit emulation).  I don't if Samsung
drivers are still binary only.

If nobody's interested, this will likely eventually end up at Freegeek.

Subject: [PLUG] Installing Java Software, XML and PNG Files
Message-ID: <20060415162653.9ea75bd1.johnxj@comcast.net>

I learned about this program from a professor:

http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~donaldd/help/help.htm

Accoding to the first paragraph (Introduction) it says it says it "was written in Java, and will operate in Microsoft, Linux, and MacIntosh environments."

I downloaded the Windows zip file and it runs on my Windows 2000 computer. Sourceforge lists only a Mac and a Windows download file, so I downloaded the same Windows zip file to my Ubuntu-64 Breezy computer and unzipped it. However, I am at a loss to figure out how to run it. Or will it run in Linux? Java is supposed to be cross-platform, right?

Also, assuming I can get it to run, it appears to save its files in XML format, or I can export as PNG. The PNG export is a raster image and it kind of sucks. I'd like to be able to use the images in OpenOffice.org Writer. I already tried it on my Windows 2000 computer and all I could get Writer to accept was the PNG file. It will also open the XML file, but it comes in as a text file, sort of like what you get if you open an EPS file in a text editor -- just a list of the code.  Is there a utility that can turn the XML file into a real vector file?

In the treeform directory, try this:

I did this, and it came up, but I have no idea if it's fully functional

1) Blank out the 13G drive however you wish.  Leave it with no partitions.

2) Install the 13G as a secondary drive and boot to the 4GB in DOS mode 
buy using F8 just as Windows starts up and before you see the splash screen.

3) Run FDISK in DOS and create one primary partition that spans the 
entire 13G disk, then set it to "active" also from the FDISK menu.  Make 
sure you have the right disk selected.  It should be obvious though.

4) Reboot (sorry, it's required before the format) and get back into DOS 
mode.  From the command line do "FORMAT D:\ /S" sans quotes.  This will 
format the drive and make it bootable.

** fun fact: 3 files are required to make a disk bootable to MS-DOS. 
The COMMAND.COM, IO.SYS & MSDOS.SYS.  This is what the /s option does.

5) Boot to Knoppix and "copy" or "drag-and-drop" the entire contents of 
files from the 4G drive to the 13G drive.  When finished, the root view 
of both drives should look identical, aside from one having more space.

6) Shutdown and remove the 4G drive and set the 13G to the primary 
master and start it back up.

7) ???

8) PROFIT!!!

As a side note, Knoppix and the like are great tools and no doubt have 
saved a Windows computer on more than one occasion.  But trying to do 
operations on one OS from another will most likely always have its 
caveats.  For anyone doing this with Win32 even on an infrequent basis, 
I recommend getting a hold of Barts WinPE boot disk.  In it's default 
form it's very basic.  But it will boot to a (stripped) graphic shell 
and allow you to do many rescue type tasks et al on any version of 
Windows to date.  With a few addons installed, it can be made to look 
like Windows 2000, have Firefox, AV, the Explorer shell, added driver 
support and much more.  All the above steps could be done by booting 
into this 'Windows Live CD' with no reboots, aside from making the 13G 
drive the primary.  As with my USB drive, it's one of my top tools.  And 
it's free, though not OSS.

Since Alan is in Moving Hell, I will attempt the following announcement,

present at Linuxfest, and I'm looking for feedback.  Hell, I'm looking
for obsequious praise, but I'm expecting rude criticism :-)

No, I don't know whether we have officially scheduled the room at Jax,
but I vaguely remember Alan mentioning it.  We moved to Monday to avoid
Wednesday Jazz.

Well, after some struggling, I have been able to overcome my computer 
problems & have after too long of a time updated the PLUG website. Not 
only have I removed the notice of the upcoming February Advanced Topics 
meeting, but have also added a section on the front page about the new 
Clinics over at Free Geek. (I hope to shortly move most of that information 
to its own page.)

Believe it or not, I'm glad that it's done more than anyone else. 
(Upgrading one's internet connections is not always an improvement across 
the board.)

Comments, suggestions, & other communications can be sent to my current

Looks good!

Now we need to get someone at Free Geek to add it to their website,
too. 

I keep trying to think of other free publicity things we can do that
won't require any effort on our part. If I were a PR dude I'd call the
Oregonian and get them to do a special in the Sunday paper, but that
requires major effort, plus I am totally not a PR dude. There are a ton
of other possibilities, it's just a question of the time to do it.

Some thoughts (in case anyone has the time/interest to invest:

* Bulletin boards at computer stores around town -- Fry's, Enu,
CompUSA, etc. Also, having them tell their employees about it, so the
employees might actually suggest it to a customer. I'm thinking it
would be especially useful at places where they sell components,
because their customers are the kind who might be interested in taking
a spin with Linux.

* E-lists at college and university comp-sci departments -- PCC, PSU,
inter many alia. Also their bulletin boards.

* Tech companies -- bulletin boards and e-lists -- e.g., Intel, Tek,
Xerox, and lots of others.

Would that I had the time and testosterone to get out and do all of the above. :(

Linux Device Drivers by Greg Kroah-Hartmann.

A fine thing in dead-tree form, also available online for free.
My signed copy has gone missing, dammit.

There's also some good documentation in the kernel source tree itself
under linux/docs (I think), and at kernelnewbies.org.

The other popular dead-tree book is Linux Kernel Development, by
Robert Love.  Currently 2nd edition from Novell Press, *extremely*
bright red cover.

Both of these books cover the 2.6.10 kernel.  Changes in API stuff
since then can be found at http://lwn.net/Articles/2.6-kernel-api/

   Those of you running a business and not using SQL-Ledger for your
bookkeeping and accounting functions are missing a great tool. Not only will
it probably do everything you want, if it doesn't, Dieter will probably add
that feature if it looks to be useful to others, too.

   One of the really slick features is the speed of upgrading to the latest
version. The application is a set of perl scripts installed in
/usr/local/sql-ledger/. To upgrade, download the latest tarball, copy it to
/usr/local/, and type 'tar tzvf sql-ledger-<version number>.' Press [Enter],
and as soon as the tarball is unpacked over the previous version, you're
finished. It's that simple. Even faster than running the Slackware package
tool, upgradepkg. :-)

Rich -

I felt I needed to write this, this is not personal in any way. I've 
gone through several Linux accounting programs and SQL-Ledger has some 
serious downsides.

My comments are about a version I ran for about 3 months, a year ago 
(and some quick glancing at current code).

If you are looking for anything beyond rearranging forms, like 
customizing/fixing a bug (what I consider the biggest feature of open 
source and perl programs), you are out of luck.

- The code is bloated (see next 2 comments) and spaghetti, some of the 
worst I have ever seen.

- No (effective) modularization of the code. Subs can be several pages 
long. Several similar/identical subs. So if you need to make one change 
you may have to find up to 8 different places to make the change.

- no use of standard perl modules, in particular CGI.pm (which I mention 
later). Many people look-over/use/correct CPAN perl modules. Almost all 
CPAN modules are programed well and tested. There are wonderful 
templating modules, CGI::App, and Math modules, all with tests and all 
proven to work by hundreds of programmers.

- There are no tests. This is bad, very bad.

- There is no 'use strict;' and no real reason not to 'use strict;'. 
This makes any error you introduce harder to find and could really bite 
you at a later time. Especially when you combine that with no testing.

- No use of CGI.pm - I (http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=157245) and 
others (http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=51012) have ranted 
about this in the past . At best it invites problems at worst and more 
commonly it's a security problem.

- The database is far from any normalized. This also makes customization 
difficult for several reasons.
   1) It's not standardized. Any DBA can look at a 3NF db and understand 
  it. 3NF is the standard (well, unless you know the rare occasions when 
you need to break 3NF, which are still pretty standard reasons)
   2) In 3NF, the Schema reflects the purpose and the relations of data. 
In non-normalized db's the code must handle the data relations and error 
checking, the schema won't help. Which makes data relations difficult to 
find and change. Sql-Ledger is using the db as a glorified spreadsheet.

There are a couple good, free (as beer), linux based business accounting 
packages for small/med sized businesses, but unfortunately SQL-Ledger 
has more name recognition.

Here are some good packages free (beer and/or speech) I found:

Quasar Accounting - http://www.linuxcanada.com/, the accounting side is
free (beer and now speech) the POS side (if you want it) does cost. 
Great for small/med business. Great support. You can customize it but, 
most of the time it's not needed, it's far more feature filled than 
SQL-Ledger.

GNUCash - http://www.gnucash.org - For very small service based 
businesses, GNUCash can run your books. Simple, easy to use, well 
supported, but not suited for any kind of inventory. Free (beer and speech)

Compiere - http://www.compiere.org/ - The whole shootin' match. Free 
(beer and speech). Accounting, ERP and CRM. Currently requires Oracle 
(but should/may have already changed to allow PostgreSQL). Tough to 
setup, but has everything any small/med business could want.

I ended up using Appgen MyBooks - Not free but inexpensive.

Christian,

   So have I gone through several accouning programs. The first one I tried
(in 2000 when the one I had been using broke with the century change) cost me
more than $1,000 and never worked well. The docs were a few README files and
the vendor offered minimal support. Terrible.

   Actually, I cannot comment on any of your criticisms as I do not know perl
(nor do I want to) and I have no need to modify the application. I just use
it. I'm on my third year now and it does all that my business needs an
accounting application to do. It's accurate and it's fast; the former is an
absolute requirement.

   I might look at this.

   No, this is not for businesses, only personal checkbook type use. And, it
stopped working for me when Slackware went to gtk+2 and the gnucash folks
didn't. I ended up in the ol' dependency hell trying to get gnome packages
installed just to run this one application. Finally gave up -- on the
recommendation of the Slackware package maintainer -- and moved to the less
pleasant, but working, KMyMoney2. Ugly, crude interface, but it works.

   Haven't known of this.

   What I do know from the SL mail list is that there are a lot of businesses
of all sizes and types that are happy to use it. As an application it's quite
similar to my diesel pickup truck: I get in, turn on the glowplug heaters,
start it up, and drive where I need to go while carrying whatever I need to
carry (or tow). SL is the software equivalent for me: it just works, even
when I don't look under the hood for more than oil level checks.

Over the last 2 years there have been several accounting features added. 
It can (and I have) used it to do business accounting. It handles 
Inv,AR,AP,GL very well. The GTK2 port is almost done and I did not have 
any problems with FC4 getting it to work with GTK.

If you really want to get into CRM and/or ERP it's great. Otherwise it's 
overkill.

But what if you decide later on you wanted to tow 5th-wheel trailer only 
to find out the frame of the truck won't support it.

SQL-Ledger used to be the only thing out there and it worked. But it's 
poorly designed and now it has competition. It may still work, but with 
poor design many features will be slow to come, compared to well 
designed programs.

Hm.  Sounds exactly like what FreeGeek and co. went through with another
"ready-to-run" app that needed just a wee bit of customization.

How many times has someone said, "well, we didn't *mean* to rewrite the
whole thing, but the old code was so ugly..."

That's a great list, thanks!  Will save for future reference.

Subject: [PLUG] logwatch report user account has expired
Message-ID: <4444B752.9060004@emediatedesigns.com>

Hello and happy post Easter to all.

In my quest to build a new server I noticed I stopped receiving emails 
from logwatch.  Hmm, was the cron not working?  So, I went off and ran 
the script in the /etc/cron.daily and it reports many lines of:

crond[14463]: User account has expired

Then continues with other information. I think I either have permissions 
wrong or the users accounts that I need not to expire have. I have been 
searching about the net and my dusty mind to find an answer but no 
avail. I'm looking for a way to tell the status of a user account? Is it 
expired? I have yet to find a simple way. Or is this really the problem? 
Perhaps it is something more basic. It appears that my cron jobs are not 
running. Still confirming this but at least logwatch is complaining 
about expired accounts.

Thoughts? Advice?

Thanks,

Josh

More information.  It appears none of the daily crons are running.  I'm 
guessing now that a permission has changed.  Still searching.

Seems odd to have an expiration set for your cron user.  If this should 
be a sane distro without hardening, you might have to suspect something 
of causing the problem.

  man passwd
  man shadow

Expired status depends on some numbers in the /etc/shadow file.

Look in /etc/shadow and see what system accounts have expiration dates on 
them.


The format of the shadow file is described in:

 	man 5 shadow

Hope that helps.

Subject: [PLUG] Mounting Phone
Message-ID: <20060418091513.467bc35e.johnxj@comcast.net>

After Sunday's yard work I tossed my muddy pants into the washer. As I took them out to put them into the dryer I found Mr. Cell Phone in the bottom of the tub. Mr. Phone was not happy. In fact, Mr. Phone was seriously dead. Drowned. All attempts at resuscitation failed.

Mr. Phone came into the world at the Sprint store downtown. So back I went to acquire a replacement. But they wanted a two year commitment, and the only commitment I was in the mood for was a commitment service for Mr. Phone, who had served me faithfully for his four years of life. Hence, I went cell shopping, and ended up walking out of the Cingular store with a shiny new RAZR and a much better service plan. 

And this morning I sit here trying to figure out how to mount Mr. RAZR on my Linux computer via the USB cable. When I plug in the cable Mr. RAZR's face happily lights up, but I'm guessing that's just because he senses the joy of a new voltage source. (His battery icon is twitching excitedly.) I tried "mount" from a command line, but nothing appeared that looked like a phone -- deleting the lines for chroot --

/dev/hda2 on / type ext3 (rw,errors=remount-ro)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
usbfs on /proc/bus/usb type usbfs (rw)
tmpfs on /lib/modules/2.6.12-9-amd64-generic/volatile type tmpfs (rw,mode=0755)

And when I run dmesg I get the following --

[151519.276063] ohci_hcd 0000:00:02.0: wakeup
[151519.548143] usb 1-2: new full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 4
[151519.684584] usb 1-2: configuration #1 chosen from 2 choices
[151519.706279] cdc_acm 1-2:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device

So it appears that Linux is aware it is there. What I need to figure out is how to be able to move stuff off of it (like the test pic I took last night). Anyone know how to mount a phone?

I don't know if your phone is supported, but check out http://bitpim.org/
Phones can vary wildly WRT their USB operation, even with the same phone
model and different carriers.  Just because you were able to do something
with your old phone does not guarantee it will be possible with the new
one.

If it were a mass-storage device, the above would say something 
about /dev/sda or otherwise mention blocks and/or storage.

This is a "USB ACM" device.  I haven't got a clue what that means, but 
I'm guessing konqueror 'gg:usb acm linux razr' may shed some light on 
the subject.  The ttyACM0 implies that you (or a program on your 
behalf) will be having something like a serial (one at a time please) 
discussion with mr phone involving some sort of protocol that expresses 
"may I please have the ..." in a vocabulary appropriate to the 
intellect of a device slightly smarter than a bag of hammers.

There is a program that will talk to the RAZR.  I haven't made it work
for me yet, but I haven't been very motivated.  Hmm.  Let me dig
... moto4lin, i think it's called.  Google should lead you in the

I have seen some great things with downed phones.  I was just with 
someone who did the same thing.  For two days we did not try to turn it 
on but instead took the battery off and the sim card out.  Let it dry in 
the sun and he held it out a car window while we drove around one 
afternoon. Air dry.  It originally had the screen full of water.  We 
then on the third day when all water appeared gone started to charge the 
phone.  Then we turned it on.  Presto!  The phone worked as though it 
never was in the wash.  This was great . Now of course he should be 
backing up his contacts but I doubt he is. 

I give it a few days to dry.  Other with us also had the same thing 
happened and waiting a few days and drying it has solve the issue. 

Good luck.

Well, I went through the shadow file and still don't see anything that 
would cause it.  I have one Fedora 1 Machine that is working fine and a 
CentOS 4.2 that is not.  The latter was working until 7 days ago.  I can 
see that in the cron logs.  I have very little users on the new machine 
so it is easy to look at them.  They appear to have the same settings as 
the old machine. 

I don't even know which accounts are expired.  The message repeats for a 
long time.  Like 30-50 times. then it goes on with other logwatch reports.

I want to thank the folks that listened attentively to my presentation
on Offsite Virtual Servers at the Advanced Topics meeting monday night.
The feedback helped me build my presentation from Linuxfest.  I set up
a page ( http://www.keithl.com/offsite.html ) that links to the monday
presentation, the current version of the presentation, and a wiki for
more information.

Based on the feedback, I put the presentation on Weight Watchers.  I
still have some slides to consolidate, and some slides to add, and a
script to memorize then ignore. 

BTW, someone asked about the fixed memory and disk areas of UML and Xen,
and why those could not be adjusted dynamically.  While there are good
reasons to make these areas fixed, those wanting to get very last drop

First, Eric, what does the "gg" do in "gg:usb acm linux razr"? I ask because in Konqueror I opened a new location popup window and pasted that line in. Konqueror announced "gg is not a supported protocol."

next, Russell, I downloaded moto4lin and another file from the same page, pk2moto. Sourceforge says my V3 is supported by moto4lin, but I didn't see any discussion of what the difference is between moto4lin and pk2moto. I viewed both tar files with my archiver program and each contains gobs of files. Not being sure what to do next, I googled. Best instructions are here:

http://www.linuxnetmag.com/de/issue9/m9moto4lin1.html

But it didn't work for me. "Make" worked, but when I got down to "make install" it gave me a lot of error messages. He says to make some changes to ./bash_profile, but I couldn't find /.bash_profile.

I've tried things like this (make, and related commands) several times in the past in order to install programs. I have yet to get one to work.

Further suggestions welcome.

Hmm.  Must be only out-of-the-(debian)-box.  It's a shortcut for google.

Settings->Configure Konqueror, scroll down to "web shortcuts" and add 
something like the following as "wp"

  "http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?search=\{@}&go=Go"

You might only have to check the "enable" box.  the \{@} gets replaced 
with whatever comes after the wp:

I bet it's there, but just in case:

  "http://www.google.com/search?q=\{@}&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8"

Then there's the "shortcut" field, which can have whatever separated by 
commas.  Mine says "gg,google", but should maybe just say "g" because 
life is short.

Though teh SlashDot article mentioned it I didn't see any mention in 
your notes of the Linux-VServer project ( http://linux-vserver.org/). 
It is a true FOSS project not a subset of someones commercial product ( 
OpenVZ ).  Is does lack a spiffy website ( basically it is a wiki for 
developers and users ) and a good portion of the developers are non-US 
so there is a time-zone issue when using irc.
   Still well worth the look-see.

Just thought to send and update.  I found the issue to be the cron jobs 
are not executing correctly.  I'm going through each one but any that 
are run as a user appear not to work.  Don't know why yet but sure it's 
a permission or configuration of cron.

About 10 years ago, I spent a winter working on the service desk at an 
AT&T Wireless store. Phones dropped in the toilet, or in a puddle were a 
regular occurrence. I don't recall ever hearing about one going through 
the wash, though. The universal truth about these incidents was that the 
phone was either dead or dying. The only exception was when the power 
was off AND the phone was completely dried out immediately after a very 
brief water based experience. A blow dryer is recommended.

If the power was off when Mr. Phone went swimming drying just might 
work. On the other hand, Mr. Phone has now been introduced to Mr. 
Corrosion, and will someday discover that one of his circuit board 
traces, or a joint between a chip and a board will have become a 
resistor instead of a conductor, and eventually will develop a condition 
of infinite resistance, also known as an open. The other possibility is 
that some of the corrosion from one place will meet up with some 
corrosion from another place and create a new resistance path that Mr. 
Phone won't know how to deal with.

As was recommended earlier, if you do get the phone to work, get the 
info from it as soon as possible, and don't plan on being able to use it 
in a critical situation. Some day it will probably fail.

Just a guess but what filesystem type did you specify when formatted the drive 
under Windows XP? Looks like it's trying to mount the filesystem as VFAT but 
maybe you formatted the filesystem a NTFS instead?

I just started using an external USB drive and it came formatted as NTFS by 
default. I was able to shrink the NTFS partition down and created a second 
partition which I formatted to EXT3 so I can backup both Windows and Linux 
paritions from my laptop.

It's a low end Pentium I have for Dos and Windows 3.1 because of a

I need to get into this database:

http://www.spiritone.com/~mcrobins/mark/oldenglish/wendere.htm

I have OO.o 1.93.129, which is supposed to be able to connect to MS Access databases (I can do it with OO.o on a Windows computer), but on my Linux computer it keeps bitching that libodbc.so.1 is not available or corrupted. I do have this file in /usr/lib, and I made a copy in /usr/lib/openoffice2, but to no avail. Can't find any documentation about where this file is supposed to be or where it came from.

I don't give a rat's patootie what format I can get this in, although OO.o Base format would probably be easiest to deal with. Ultimately I want to merge the data into an OO.o Writer document and print it out. Can anyone suggest a good open source solution for getting into MS Access database files?

I never had much luck with OO.o's access stuff (and I've not been impressed

to put a fancy GUI on databases like mysql or postgres... 

Using knoda with the mdb drivers, I was able to open the Access 2002 version 
of the file decently -- I got 'table1' which seems to be the extent of the 
dictionary with a sample record being (column names excluded because I'm 
lazy):

I got a couple conversion errors complaining about "Missing or broken VBE

HI All.
    I'm trying to figure out the mod_rewrite function for Apache and
really don't have a clue stick here. All I want to do is redirect all
the spiderbots to my latest and greatest website folder while still
having the old folder in place (things in there that need to stay there
for the time being). I have read the mod_rewrite page on the Apache site
and all it does is befuddle me.
    Here's what I want to do...
All requests for files that reside in folder Web2004 need to be
redirected to folder Web2006. Now according to the mod_rewrite man I
think it should go like this:
    RewriteEngine On

    RewriteBase    /Web2004
...the above being the easy part. My problem is that my index.html is in
a higher folder and it looks to me like that may cause a problem with
trying to get the redirect to work right as I don't have a set file to
redirect to as in the example...

RewriteRule   ^oldstuff\.html$  newstuff.html

Hit me with a clue stick please.

That's the RewriteBase example.  Try the RewriteRule example.

  RewriteRule  ^/here/$                 /there/homepage.min.html  [L]

"need to stay there" meaning that external links to the URL's can't get 
broken?

Are you redirecting everyone or just the bots?  Maybe not a job for 
mod_rewrite.  Symlink?  Alias?

Message-ID: <4447B195.8060306@comcast.net>

Has this happened to any other T-bird users?

Someone has been sending me things with a very large J at the end of the 
message. Since I got it from more than one person, I thought it might be 
some current cultural thing that, having lived under a rock for too 
long, I've missed out on. Turns out it's just one of the happy face 
emotcon variants, but for some reason, it renders as a large J on both 
my Linux and Windows versions of T-Bird. Here's the text I received:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
It is a happy face.  If you type a ?:? and then a ?)? it turns into a 
happy face J
---------------------------------------------------------------------

When I use a happy face, I usually use :-) or ;-)

I haven't used :) before.

Most of you will see simple text, but T-Bird users: are you seeing a 
large J or a : and a ), or some graphic T-Bird is substituting? I do get 
graphic emotcons from time to time. When I reply I see the text that 
they were based on. But, a J? Weird.

Thanks for the suggestion. Knoda is listed in Synaptic, so I installed it. However, it cannot seem to see the wendere.mdb file. In fact, it cannot seem to see anything. The only thing that is not grayed out is Settings > Options, and nothing in there looks like it might have anything to do with the problem, except maybe the setting for "Driverpath:." 

Re the conversion error messages you got, after reading more about the database file it appears that it contains not only the data (2,900 Old English words in an OE-ModE dictionary), but it also has some search queries. Access stores all the queries, scripts and other stuff in the same file along with the data, so that's probably what caused the error messages that you got. 

Theoretically I should be able to access the MS Access .mdb file directly with OO.o Writer. It should display the fields and give me options to merge into a Writer document, e.g., as if it were a mailing list. However, something has changed in OO.o 1.93.129 (the version I now have) from the old 1.15 that I used to have. It used to be that you had an option to Create a New Data Source where you could specify the .mdb file you wanted to get into. I'll be damned if I can find where they moved that option to. All it displays now are the data sources that I created back in the days when I had 1.15, and the option at the top of the list to add a new one is missing. The Help file says to go into Tools > Data Sources, but there is no such entry on the Tools button. There is also a Database Wizard, but it seems to be missing libraries or something -- types of data sources that the Help file says are there are not listed (e.g., ADO, which it says is the best to use for accessing MS Access files). The Browser window for adding a database does not see any files that end in .mdb.

I also tried KOffice and Abiword, but they don't seem to have any external database connectivity at all. KOffice has a mail merge, but evidently only using its internal mail list database.

I searched in Synaptic on "ODBC" and came up with a sizable list of things to install (including Knoda), but I can't tell which one I need. Probably some library is missing, but which one? It would be most helpful if one was labeled "Hey dumbass, can't get into your Access database? Click Here!!"

For the record, I can't get into it on my Windows desktop either. It now has OO.o 2.0 and the "New Data Source" is missing there also. As an absolute last-ditch possibility I do have MS Office 2000 Professional. I used to use it before switching to OO.o, but about six months ago I uninstalled it. I could reinstall just Access 2000, but I'm trying to go open source as much as possible. Besides, this is a learning experience. I'm sure this is not going to be the only time I ever need to get into an Access .mdb file with Linux, so best I figure out how to do it.

Additional suggestions welcome!

Ref: SCSI vs. SATA RAID messages.

I'm down to the point of ordering our new ( specialized ) server so I'm 
thinking of other performance considerations for the software it will be 
running.  This brings up file systems.
    I typically just choose ext3 and SWAG a partition scheme depending 
on how much disk space the system has.  This has worked for well for the 
general purpose systems I've build to date.  Since the software we'll be 
running is very disk and RAM intensive we've loaded up ( given the 
projected work load ) on RAM and the SCSI RAID will help but I'm now 
looking at file systems.
    Choices fall as either ext3 and XFS.  I know how ext3 works and it's 
warts but I've never used XFS.  The reason I'm not considering ReiserFS 
  is we have million's of files ranging in size from a few KByte to a 
few GByte in size.
    There are also a lot of temporary files that are short lived so -- 
according to the XFS articles I've read -- will never hit the disks.

What are your thoughts and ideas on XFS as a file system.


TIA,
Rod

On the topic of knoda, it requires (optional) database backends, sqlite, 
postgres, access, what have you.  Under debian, Access' stuff is in 
the "libmdbtools" pacakge.

On second thoughts, OO.o may be suffering from a similar issue.  Though, I 
don't know enough about OO.o to say, but I would guess your system just 
doesn't have any libraries to read .mdb files?

I'll give a brief brief, if you want more info I'll be happy to
provide details ;)

XFS is great.  However, so is ext3.  (very non-commital ;)

In the event that everything works OK, I've been extremely happy with
XFS.  When I've had failures they are tremendously huge, and sometimes
have a creeping-doom leaving up to them making recovery painful.  I
used to rant about how inferior ext3 was, and scoff at those to didn't
take the time to test and tweek _every_ filesystem tunable and
generate pretty graphs documenting superiority... I'm recovering from
that now!

After unaddressed significant XFS bugs lingering through numerous
in-kernel releases and XFS project releases, I realized it wasn't
something that I wanted to be running on critical systems.  I've had
issues with kernel bugs on ext3, but they've been addressed _swiftly_
by Redhat and the developers.  XFS had numerous bugzilla entries from
me for a long time, that never responded...

Pros:

XFS:
  Fast.  Tunable.  Chic.

ext3:
  Fast.
  Extremely well-tested and proven recovery/lint tools.
  Great full-time coder/vendor support.

Cons:

XFS:
  If it breaks, plan on recovering from backup and switching to a
different filesystem.  If it's a repeatable bug, you'll hit it
again... and again... and post how repeatable it is... and get no
response.

ext3:
  The docs are only like 10% as big ;)
  Far fewer filesystem layout options.

Breakdown:
  ext3 is fast when set up right, and very stable.  If you've got the
new hardware investment, there are a number of things you can do to
tweak your layout properly for your workload.   If you'd like to chat
about it, let me know.  If you want to play with a system specifically
for non-critical temporary data with massively concurrent IO (and you
have a LOT of money to make that work), go with XFS (or just buy some
Spinnakers).  If you want a really capable, stable, and warm-fuzzy
system that is capable of massively concurrent IO (within the limits
of your hardware), I'd go with ext3 (or just buy some Spinnakers)  and
put a bit of effort (a couple days) into planning and testing it.

IMO.

Cheers,

/eli

Thanks Eli.  Very interesting.  The warm fuzzy I was reading came from 
an IBM site.  Nothing about JFS though.  :-)  I guess I was impressed 
with the 8-9 EByte size and the lazy write feature.

So minus-one for XFS.  Plus-two for ext3.

Anyone else?

BTW, if you're looking almost exclusively for lazy-write/short-lived
small file optimizations, I've hacked that up with ext3 succesfully. 
Once you have a large & fast external journal device on disks (raid10)
_separate_ from your main filesystem array, you use that for all your
filesystem writes first (data=journal).  Inline with that, setting a
very large journal flush period enables short-lived files to be kept
off of your main array... and all that IO directed at the disk doesn't
affect read performance until it does a large batch write of long-term
data (MUCH better than sporadic small writes).

I see a smilie that thunderbird substitutes in. I don't see any ':' + 
')' becoming a large 'J'.

Perhaps it might be related to the version of Thunderbird you are using. 
I am using version 1.5.

It certainly sounds as though libraries are missing.

Following your suggestion re libmdbtools, I opened Synaptic and find that it is already installed. Another odd thing is that OO.o complains that libodbc.so.1 is "missing or corrupt," yet it is right where it belongs (I think), and has been all along.

I posted queries in OO.o forums under Writer and under Base. So far 20-30 views, no responses. I also searched the forums and came up with lots of people complaining that OO.o couldn't see queries and reports, but no one complaining that they couldn't at least open the database and see the tables.

I also did a search in Synaptic for "database," hoping to find something else like Knoda, or whatever might show up. In scanning through the several pages of programs I came across gda2-odbc, which says it is a gnome backend for ODBC. I installed it, and afterwards OO.o can finally see the wendere.mdb file (and the wendere97.mdb file as well). However, it still can't get into either of them. The error message says the driver must be bad. But previously when I navigated to the folder where those files are located it couldn't even see that they were in the folder. So something must have happened.

I'm spearing fish in black water here, hoping to hit something edible.

LVM would be nice in this case.  The snapshot feature is a must for
consistent backups, but partition resizing and migration are nice to
have, too.  Check into (and test) online resizing for the filesystems
you're considering.

Will your RAID card support online array resizing?

For temp file performance, try tmpfs, too.

Oh, and my money's on Ext3.  Unless you have time to test with a
simulated workload on the various filesystems, go with what you know.
Just read up on RAID stripe size vs. stride= settings before you mkfs.

Good luck,

Which brings up an interesting point for those using firefox and 
thunderbird...

Did anybody here have any issues with firefox and thunderbird NOT 
informing the user that there was an update to be had?
I had my system spend a HUGE amount of time at a 1.0.X because it wasn't 
informing me of MAJOR updates.

So double check your versions folks...
Of course you could still be using pine.... ;)

It takes messages great, the problem is that it doesn't detect the
other party hanging up and shut off immediately.  So I have many
recordings of the phone company, "If you'd like to make a call..."

Another improvement I badly want to offer is playback of the message
just recorded.  I'm about ready to switch to Slackware 10.1 instead
of Fedora Core 1 on the off chance that Slackware's vgetty will work
better and be more complete.  Slackware's rc scripts are much closer
to correct for nfs root than Fedora Core 1's init scripts.

Not hanging up is more likely a problem with the modem than vgetty.
I've been using vgetty with RH7.3, FC1, and FC3 and have never had
a problem with it hanging up. There may be some modem config settings
that will improve the hang-up detection.

Why are you using Fedora Core 1? That is pretty old.  Current is Fedora 
Core 5.

That's good.  Last week I made an inadvertent discovery about my IPv6 
problems on Debian that may have some bearing on why I had Debian/Ubuntu 
issues but no issues with Arch Linux.  But I haven't had time to look 
into it further as this has been a very bad week.  My mom died a few 
days ago, so I'm not paying much attention to computer stuff right now 
and am way behind on email and, well, everything else.

   No. I read about the updates and grabbed the Slackware packages as soon as
they were available. Installed right away. Firefox on three machines,
thunderchicken on one.

   Yes, I do. Never saw a need for a graphical interface for a text

You might try it for a week or two and report back.  1.5.0.2 is out...

Interesting question.
I can't find anything in Thunderbird that checks for an update.  I find 
a  check for updates to extensions and themes, but not for the program 
itself.
With Ubuntu I have to change the ownership of Firefox and manually go 
check for updates since I upgraded to version 1.5.

Michael,

I am very sorry to hear about your loss.  I spent all last week with my 
sister who is going through a rough time with family issues.
I am about ready to buy or build a couple of computers and am anxious to 
have a box that I can test drive some different distributions on.  
Ubuntu has been solid for me, but I am curious.

That's because with Ubuntu (and most other distros) you are expected
to use apt to get the updates, not Firefox's built-in update
capabilities.

The built-in update capabilities is only useful on platforms that do
not have distro update functionality, such as Windows and Mac.

My guess is that it's supposed to turn into the Unicode smiley face, but
your font is making it into a different character.  

Here's a paste of 0x263A ("White smiling face"):
?

And 0x263B ("Black smiling face"):

?

What do these look like to you?

With Thunderbird...
Tools Menu
Options Selection...
Advanced Icon
It then shows quite a few options for upgrading both Thunderbird and the 
Extensions.

With Firefox...
Tools Menu
Options Selection...
Advanced Icon
Update Tab
It then shows quite a few options for upgrading Firefox, Extensions and 
Themes, and Search Engines.

Has anybody else run into the same issues that Bruce is facing?

rdesktop will allow a linux box to connect to a WinXP though it has
limited support.  Works much like native Remote Desktop feature in XP.

VNC is also a good choice but requires a bit more setting up on your
friend's side.

Folks, 

Just ran across this article,

which seems like a logical follow-up to Keith's advanced topics
discussion of Xen. 

I know, it's The Register, but it seems like the VMWare folks are doing
more to reach out to the community - but Xen has native advantages, such
as paravirtualization.

Exposing VNC to the internet is problematic.  I have re-discovered
an easy vpn code set that works on both windows and linux.  Hamachi
http://hamachi.cc/

Remote desktop feature is only available in the Pro version except via
the help request.
If you can get this person walked through getting hamachi setup and connected
to you vpn then he could just use the windows help request which should allow
you to connect to Remote Desktop.  Use windows once to get this setup and
then install vnc.

I looked at the yum repository to find out where the Fedora Core 3 updates
are being grabbed from and then started downloading all of them with gftp.  
Well, I got 550'ed.  Has anyone else been 550'ed trying to grab all of 
the updates for an older Fedora Core release?  What I suggest to the
Fedora Core Community, distribute a final vesion of each release
with ALL of the updates applied.  The updates are getting to be as
much as the release itself.

Try using the livna repo. Livna says it will continue hosting the 
"current" (along with adding new rpms) rpms for RH7 and up.

Actually, it's been postponed. I got too busy and the current situation 
is stable enough for my wife to continue working.

When I tried putting the 4GB drive back as the boot device, it failed. 
When I run Knoppix on the machine I can access all the data on both the 
4GB drive and the 13GB drive. So now, the machine is booting from the 
13GB drive, but thinks it's just got 4GB. Some day...

The 4GB drive is getting pretty old. It's a Quantum Bigfoot from back 
around 1995. It's the drive that came with Win95 installed on my old NEC 
(really Packard/Bell) 200MHz machine. The rest of the machine is working 
just fine with a larger hard drive and is the server I have running RH 
7.0 in the basement.

So, thanks to all for the advice. I hope to find some spare time to 
fiddle with the equipment one of these days.

The character white and black smiling faces - not the T-Bird yellow graphic.

I'm still on 1.0.6 on both this (Linux) machine and my Win98 machine.

If you select "apply to incoming messages" too, then it should fix it.

Message-ID: <20060421222303.75514.qmail@web51814.mail.yahoo.com>

I've been trying to install Ubuntu 5.10 on an AMD64 system (Asus A8N
mobo, 1 GB RAM), but it keeps hanging during the install. It hangs at
different parts each time... sometimes during partitioning, sometimes
while copying files from the CDROM, and sometimes after the reboot when
it finishes the install.

I verified the CD image with md5sum, tried two different i386 CDs and
also an AMD64 CD. I also tried three different hard drives (two SATA
and one IDE), tried both SATA ports, all with the same results. I also
tried installing with "linux noapic nolapic" but didn't fix it there
either.

This system installs Suse 10 just fine.

Any suggestions?

somecommand | awk '{ sum = sum + $2 } END { print sum }'
where $2 represents the second field of the output from somecommand
would seem to work.

'wc -l'  (count lines) (also characters "-m", words "-w")

just add another pipe, and it will tally the number of lines written
out by your previous chain of commands:

  ./check_dns_zone.pl  | grep IN | awk '{print $5}' | sed s/\.$//g | wc -l
(sorry, that was close at hand...)
Feed in whatever series of filtering commands/scripts you wish and it
will return the number of lines it sees.  If you meant more along the
lines of totaling integers, there's probably a way to feed it to 'bc',
but a perl one-liner would probably be as easy :)

Was that what you were looking for?

you should give a short example of the input data, now it's rather uncertain
how it looks. I'll assume it looks like this:

foo 1
bin 5
bar 2
bin 3
baz 0

even without them you can do this using plain bash/sh:

assume $INPUT == the filename of your data, and leave the part after 'done' away
if you read from stdin.


while read WORD NUMBER; do
    if [ "$WORD" == "bin" ]; then
        (( TOTAL = TOTAL + NUMBER ))
    fi
done < $INPUT
echo $TOTAL


alternatively, you can read a whole line and "awk" $2 out of it if grep matches a certain regex,
but the above method is much faster since it doesn't fork.

Also, you can solve this with awk only. I'm sure someone can come up with this ;^)

Cheers,

Auke

Where are you getting the updates from?  It is quite possible that one
of the original mirrors has decided to no longer keep the FC3 updates
since FC3 is obsolete.  The official updates are still available from
the master site at
http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/updates/3/.

Also, Fedora Legacy project, http://www.fedoralegacy.org/, has taken
over maintenance of FC3.  They attempt to release security and bug
fixes for FC3.  Their updates are available from
http://download.fedoralegacy.org/fedora/3/updates/.

I had the same results. I looked at the contents of /usr/local/lib and
found that all the files were owned by root. So, I su'd and ran make
install again. This time it appeared to work.

There don't seem to be any instructions on what to do next, though. I
looked in /usr/local/bin and found p2ktest. When I run it, with my cell
phone connected using the USB cable that came with my Canon Digital
Rebel camera and got these results:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
dhcppc4:/usr/local/bin # ./p2ktest
P2k Test
Device list:
22b8:2a62: [Motorola, Inc.] [Motorola V3c]
0000:0000: [Linux 2.6.5-7.252-default uhci_hcd] [UHCI Host Controller]
No phone found.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two things that aren't clear.

1. Why doesn't p2ktest find the phone?

2. What is the purpose of p2ktest? Is it just to verify that the
computer can talk to the phone?

I suppose that there's the outside possibility that the cable somehow is 
not the correct one.

Ignoring that problem for the moment, I went on to try to build
moto4lin. After discovering that I didn't have QT3, and resolving that 
with YaST I was successful in building moto4lin. But, I was not 
successful in running it. I get the following:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
dhcppc4:/usr/bin # ./moto4lin
Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server
Xlib: No protocol specified

moto4lin: cannot connect to X server :0.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------

So, while I got a little farther than you did, I didn't get far enough 
to be able to help you (or me!) figure out what to do next.

Does anyone else have some insight to share?

That didn't appear to have any effect when I forwarded one of the errant 
messages to myself. But, that might not be a suitable example. I'll have 
to leave that setting on and wait for another smilie face from one of 
those two folks. One us using Outlook, and the other probably is too 
(the header says it comes from Exchange), and, of course, that's where 
the problem really is. :-)

I would create a script, because "awk '{ sum = sum + $1 } END { print 
sum }'" doesn't tab-complete as well as something like pipe_sum, and 
that awk one-liner is still a script.

  http://scratchcomputing.com/svn/misc/trunk/code/perl/bin/pipe_sum

That's a bit lengthy, but only because I intended to add some options to 
it at some point beyond the plain

If you really want the opportunity to test some distributions I would
recommend (if it works with your version of the kernel/distribution).....

VMWare

It is available free as a Beta product (NOTE: This is separate from the
VMWare player available from their web site.) although it does require
registration and a serial number (provided by them at no charge when you
download it).  The requirement to install/use:  Provide Feedback / bug
reports.

I've got it installed on several machines (work / home) and it's pretty
stable on SuSE 10 / SLES 9 and (I hate to admit it) Windows XP.

The advantage: You can build machines that have the same "configuration"
to test installation ease, configuration and then roll-back any changes
(like updates) to test that.

It is a bit of a memory hog, and getting it up and working was a little
bit of a challenge.  But it works well to test Linux configuration (or
in my case - impacts of applications as I add more of a load to a
server) and allows me to experiment with "what if" configurations.

Give it a shot.

Tim

Eric,
    External links is exactly right. I just want to redirect the bots. I
photograph for a local kids track club and until they get their site
updated and ready i need to leave the old site live as I host the photo
portion on my web server. Hence the need to refer the bots to the new
without disturbing the old. That and the fact that I get a lot of search
bots cruising my site and don't want to lose those that have found me.

Does anyone have any experience with http://www.yousendit.com/ ? It

You could set up a shared gmail filesystem. Works in Windows too:
http://www.viksoe.dk/code/gmail.htm

Not sure if it splits files to support <10GB files, as that's the
single e-mail limit.

Last time I fiddled with it (some six months ago) it would just fail silently 
on files larger than 10 megs (not 10 gigs..), after, of course, spending a 
good 10 minutes trying to upload 10 megs over my cable connection.

 From the caveat at the bottom of that page I can tell that this would 
not be a good solution for my wife and her sister. His otherwise 
interesting idea needs to be reworked every time Google changes the 
login procedure. This would require me to walk them through it every 
time. Better will be something designed for the purpose with a stable 
interface.

That's the whole point of the exercise: finding a way to send larger 
than 10GB files.

Thanks anyway, though.

Looks like gmail has a 10MB limit, which seems to be fairly common in 
e-mail services.

Another possibility is to use googlepages, which has a 100MB total limit.

If they're shipping files in both directions, then they will have to
share the account.  If the files are only going in one direction, then
the originator can use the account to upload the files, and the other
can simply download them from the web.  (Warning:  I haven't actually
tried uploading big files to googlepages, so I can't guarentee that
they'll make it in one piece.  The largest one that I've put up there
is about 120k.)

I believe that googlepages accounts are currently only available to
people who have gmail accounts.  But gmail accounts are now wide open
- everyone with a current account has an obscene number of
automatically regenerating invites.  And if you have a cellphone, then
you can sign up without an invite.

Hmm.  So the space they offer is an 'overall' thing.  Well, you can 
always post the files to your Comcast web space then send them links. 
Or if you have a domain that has more space then do the same with that.

I know that winrar has the option to make archive files that are a
specific size, and then will begin writing to another archive after, and
another. In the end you might have six archive files but if you extract
the first one it will go through them all. No clue if ark or similar has
an option to do the same thing, but it might.

I had a look. The files would only be going one way, but the sender is 
the sister in Boston, and not someone who would want to administer a web 
site, even one as simple as googlepages.

Thanks for the idea, though.

That might work if I was the one sending the files, but would probably 
be too much for the two of them to have to deal with.

I suppose one way to do it would be to create a web site on one of my 
Comcast e-mail names that doesn't currently have a site on it, and see 
if I can teach my sister-in-law and my wife how to ftp to and from it.

Something like this may be the way to go. As I mentioned in another 
reply, I might just have to set up a web site that they can put files 
into and take them out of.

Thanks to all for the ideas, and the thought process that led to another 
idea.

Do they both have AIM/ICQ/GChat/MSN/Yahoo/etc??

File transfers can be done via those programs from user to user.

I don't think so, but I'll ask them. Even though my sister-in-law has a 
Comcast connection, she still uses Compuserve for e-mail! We've tried to 
convince her to change it, but she thinks she has too many clients who'd 
have to get used to a new e-mail address. This doesn't sound too hard 
for most of us, but it's a real big deal for her.

Thanks.

I haven't had time to pursue it further, but I will be at the Clinic tomorrow, and I will have my computer, phone, and a couple different cables with me. (I have three USB to mini-B cables.) Maybe one of the gurus can figure out what we are doing wrong. If so, I will post back with the solution. 

Like you, I want to be able to download pics and videos directly to my computer via the USB cable instead of paying Cingular for the privilege of e-mailing them to myself.

You can never be too rich, too thin, or have enough redundant onramps to the 
Internet.
-----
I will bring an activated T-Mobile GC89 PCMCIA card with me to
the Plug Clinic at Freegeek, tomorrow, Sun-Apr-22-2006 @ 1 PM PDT.
I will need to leave with it right at 4 PM.
-----
I recently activated the service, and am using it with the included Windows CD.
T-Mobile does not support Linux, but it would be great to see it work.
I'll be bringing along an Ubuntu notebook, just in case somebody can do it.
Please advise if you want to try it in your notebook, with your distro.
Activating the card provides you with a SIM, which must be present to operate.
-----
Here is a spec sheet on T-Mobile's $200 (less $50 rebate) GC89 PCMCIA card:
http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/Phones/Default.aspx?shape=data
It connects via the following protocols:
GPRS -- 2/3 the speed of dialup, I once surfed continuously from Seattle to 
Salem.
     -- Ain't no speed daemon, but the connection was seamless all the way down 
I5.
Edge -- 2.5 times the speed of dialup, they claim, but I haven't "experienced" 
it yet.
     -- It's supposed to be an up-and-comer, a partnership with T-Mobile & 
Cingular.
WiFi -- T-Mobile Hot Spots (starbucks/borders/etc) included with Total Internet 
Service.
Connect to other Wi-Fi hotspots, I haven't used the Wi-Fi capability yet.
-----
Here is a spec sheet on their $50 per month "Total Internet Service":
http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/plans/detail.aspx?tp=tb1&id=311e4582-a0d6-4dc9-956e-8bce2691c67c
(if the url doesn't work, search TMobile.Com for "total internet service" or 
browse "plans")
-----
BTW I got it working on a WinXP desktop with a PCI to PCMCIA card from Fry's.
Plug it in, no drivers come with the card, PCMCIA shows up with no config.
A $39.95 "For BEST Ports Connection" branded card DOES work. It identifies 
itself as:
"Ricoh R/RL/RT/RC/5C475(II), R5C520 or Compatible CardBus Controller"
Tier-3 tech support guy said he'd never heard of a GC89 working with a PCI to 
PCMCIA card.
He said he thinks it's because most of them are NOT 32 bit.
-----
The first card I tried did NOT work; a $39.95 SIIG branded card from Fry's.
It identified itself as Ricoh too, but I don't remember the numbers.

Thanks ... it's much rougher to deal with than I expected, but I guess I 
didn't really have any particular idea of what to expect.  Turns out you 
really can't prepare for things like this, however apparent it is that 
it's going to happen in the not-too-distant future.

I'll make a separate post about the IPv6 thing.  I didn't mean to sound 
all mysterious, I've just not had time or inclination to deal with these 
things recently.  And I don't know how helpful it will be anyway.  But I 
could use some distractions now!

I don't know the answer to either of those questions, but I *do* know
that there is something  wrong with the way moto4lin establishes
connections to the phone.  I've never been able to connect solely
through moto4lin.  IIRC, the proceedure I've used to transfer files
to/from the phone is:  (If this doesn't work, let me know.  I don't
have my usb cable to test and it's been a while.)

1) run p2ktest and establish a connection, then close p2ktest (the
closing part may be optional)
2) start moto4lin, verify the settings are correct (pointing to the
correct tty device, mostly -- and in agreement with anything learned
from p2ktest in #1)
3) Hit the Connect/Disconnect button
4) transfer files very carefully.  The defaults are anything but
intuitive, and the view of the phone filesystem seems to have little
effect on where things go and what paths you need to input manually. 
Basically, moto4lin is a serious pain in the ass to use, but I have
been able to get the job done with it.

See if you can run xclock in the same way, with the same user as
moto4lin.  This looks to be an X issue that should be easily resolved
by running something like 'xhost +' and/or setting your DISPLAY
variable.   Are you running a non-standard X setup? (nested, multiple
servers, etc?)

As a side note -- I have not found a way to install a ringtone over
the usb cable.

Subject: [PLUG] More on IPv6 problems
Message-ID: <444B2F91.70406@writemoore.net>

I don't know if this will be of any help to anyone else who has had 
browsing and other connection-related issues due to IPv6 
misconfiguration problems, but I stumbled across a little discovery 
quite by accident.  My problems were with Debian and Ubuntu, both the 
x86 and PPC versions, and the symptoms were that network activity was 
touch-and-go (usually gone) across a wide variety of functions.  It 
wasn't *just* Firefox that was broken, but anything that was in some way 
shape or form IPv6-enabled -- using aptitude or apt to connect to 
Debian's and Ubuntu's servers, for example, would timeout unless I first 
pinged the servers; bittorrent would also fail to connect to a tracker 
unless I first pinged the server hosting the tracker.  These problems 
unexpectedly and automagically resolved themselves after I installed 
Arch Linux.  My guess, and it is purely a guess, was that there was some 
problem with the way Debian and Ubuntu interacted with my modem/router 
(a Qwest-provided Actiontec GT-701-WG), and that installing Arch somehow 
reset something in the device.  Upon reinstalling both Debian and Ubuntu 
(after having installed Arch), all apps worked out-of-the-gate under 
Debian and Ubuntu -- the same apps that had given me grief before.  It 
was no longer necessary for me to disable IPv6 in either OS (a fix that 
was never entirely satisfactory, as I still had residual connection 
problems).  And just to be clear, under Arch, there was never any 
problem at all.

What I discovered is that the problem returned under Debian when I 
installed the gnome metapackage.  I'm not sure how other distros do it, 
but in Debian there are basically three versions of Gnome:  1) 
gnome-core, which I think provides the essential libraries and some core 
gnome apps; 2) gnome-desktop-environment, which provides a reasonably 
complete Gnome setup without including everything in the Gnome universe; 
and 3) gnome, which is much of the Gnome universe.  I had had 
gnome-desktop-environment installed, as per my usual, and decided to 
install gnome.  Immediately, my IPv6 problems returned.  I promptly 
uninstalled gnome, leaving gnome-desktop-environment, and the problems 
went away again.  (Heavy sigh of relief there.)

In looking over what additional apps get installed with gnome, it seems 
to me the likely candidate for what caused the problem is avahi -- not 
sure if it's avahi-daemon, avahi-dnsconfd, or avahi-utils, as all get 
installed with the gnome metapackage and none are installed with 
gnome-desktop-environment (though I do have some avahi libraries 
installed).  According to aptitude, for avahi-daemon:

"Avahi is a fully LGPL framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery. It 
allows
 programs to publish and discover services and hosts running on a local 
network
 with no specific configuration.  For example you can plug into a 
network and
 instantly find printers to print to, files to look at and people to 
talk to.

 "This package contains the Avahi Daemon which represents your machine 
on the
 network and allows other applications to publish and resolve mDNS/DNS-SD
 records."

For avahi-dnsconfd, the first paragraph is the same; the second reads:

 "This tool listens on the network for announced DNS servers and passes 
them to
 resolvconf so it can use them.  This is very useful on autoconfigured IPv6
 networks."

Sounds to me like that would be something that could muck things up.

I haven't had a chance to read more about what exactly these tools do 
because of my mom's illness and death, but here's my totally 
unsophisticated, barely informed pet theory:  at some point in months 
past, when I was using only Debian and OS X and had only my iMac, I 
installed the full gnome metapackage on my Debian PPC installation.  
That dragged avahi in, and reset something in my modem/router that 
persisted across all subsequent installations of Debian and Ubuntu.  
Keep in mind that I had these connection issues even during installation 
-- as often as not, during the installation apt would fail to connect to 
the servers, and that was with only the base system installed, well 
before any DE packages were installed or even downloaded.  Whatever 
avahi did, did not affect OS X, which continued to work fine with IPv6 
enabled.  Installing Arch Linux, for reasons that remain a mystery to 
me, somehow undid what avahi had done, and because I didn't reinstall 
avahi under any OS, the problem went away.  Until, of course, I 
reinstalled avahi.

Does that sound like something that's in the realm of the possible?  
Anyone else who's had or has some of these issues might want to look 
into whether you have or are likely to have had avahi installed.  It's 
probably just something that crops up with particular hardware and 
software combinations that are difficult to pinpoint, which I guess 
would be why it only bites a few of us.  But, man, does it bite -- I was 
almost ready to give up on Linux altogether.  At least for me, I know 
what package to avoid like the plague, at least until these issues are 
resolved.  I don't currently have Ubuntu installed and given recent life 
events I'm probably not going to mess with it again at least until 
Dapper is released, so I can't check whether Ubuntu handles avahi 
differently than Debian.  I don't have Gnome installed under Arch Linux, 
so I definitely don't have avahi installed there.

So there you are -- hope it helps.

That's good to know. I hope John sees this before going to the clinic today.

Maybe that's the answer to the question of what p2ktest is for. Maybe 
moto4lin is a project done without a lot of time available to integrate 
stuff as it comes along.

The standard X setup that comes with SuSE 9.1.

So the problem is related to running moto4lin as root. Do I change all 
the protections for all the files related to moto4lin, or is there some 
other way this should be done?

That won't bother me. I use vibrate exclusively. In some settings a 
unique tune could be amusing, but I find that vibrate is less annoying 
to anyone around me.

Thanks for the ideas. I look forward to hearing John's experience at 
today's clinic.

Message-ID: <200604231848.36322.ewilhelm@cpan.org>

(Wouldn't you know I would figure this one out as soon as I got home 
from the clinic with nothing but a couple of first names.  I think I've 
got the right Dale (she mentioned that you setup this laptop for her.)  
I'm not sure how to contact Judy (though I know she volunteers at 
kboo.)  If anyone knows her, please forward this message to the correct 
Judy.)

Ok, so for Judy and everyone else's reference:

You can set artsd to relinquish control of the sound card after a given 
time period.  Go to the "Control Center" (or type kcontrol from a shell 
window) and on the sound->sound-system section, check the 
"auto-suspend" box and set the slider to something like 2 seconds 
(maybe higher if that gives you trouble.)

Yay!  Now you can run audacity without having to go to the control 
center and disable the sound system.  You still can't play sound from 
two programs simultaneously, but what would that sound like anyway? :-) 

It seems you'll be okay to leave kscd open, but there is the catch that 
you cannot be *playing* sound when you start audacity.

Yes and not a good one.  Their email server was not configured correctly 
to acknowledge that they are who they say they are.  My email server 
would then say you are lying to me.  I'd reject them.  I talked to the 
admin of the company I was working with and he told me he had complaints 
from other email servers with the same issue. 

To solve the problem for 2 very non-technical people I setup an ftp 
client for both and helped them configure the ftp to my server.  Then 
they just drag and drop to the ftp client the files they need.  They 
both happen to use Mac.  I did this with other clients as well who have 
no idea how to ftp a file and they have had no problems learning 
Filezilla or some other simple free FTP client software.  They upload 
and send an email to the other to get the file.  Has worked very well.  
Takes me about an hour to teach them but saves me tons of time with the 
complaints about a bounced email and not knowing what was working.  
Also, with FTP they can resume upload/download and that has saved them 
many times.

Subject: [PLUG] Firefox-1.5.x Does Not Play Nicely With Other Applications
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0604241718080.17330@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Over the years I've grown used to highlighting text from a
firefox-displayed web page (using the trackball), then pasting it in another
application, including a text file. I've also been able to print the file to
disk (as a .ps file), then convert it to text with pstotext.

   Neither process works any longer; not since I replaced version 1.0.7 with
1.5.0. I don't understand why not.

   Has anyone else seen this? Alternatively, if you're able to paste to a text
editor in a virtual console or convert from .ps to .txt with the ghostscript
tools, please tell me how you're doing this.

TIA,

Rich

***Implementing Mutual Exclusion for AJAX
AJAX programmers who come from the Java world should be concerned with

tools from the synchronized keyword and the old Object wait()/release()
to the modern java.util.concurrent package introduced in J2SE 5.0. Bruce
Wallace addresses the problem by introducing protection for critical

Message-ID: <20060425021404.GA17237@gate.kl-ic.com>


Linuxfest is this Saturday, April 29, in Bellingham:

http://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org

I will be driving up that direction early Friday morning, if anyone
needs a ride.  I plan to make a stop in Seattle at 830am, and pass
through Bellingham before noon.  I will spend Friday afternoon in 
Vancouver BC with friends, returning to Bellingham in the evening.

If you want a ride to  Bellingham and can be ready to roll around
530am, let me know.  I will be in a mini-SUV, and can carry 3
passengers northbound, or two passengers and a bicycle or two.  I
will be driving back to Portland with my wife on Sunday, and
stopping to see friends in Tacoma, so it would be better if you
take the train or bus or plane back.

If there is anything to carry up for the raffle, I can probably
bring that up as well.  No server racks...

Audio. Their business is transcribing recorded interviews that can run 
to an hour or more. One of their clients broke up a Sony .dvf file into 
two parts of just over 15 minutes each. One file is 8.7MB and the other 
8.5MB. Most of their clients wouldn't know how to split a file into 
shorter parts, though.

Until recently they've been using regular and mini cassette tapes. With 
the growing popularity of digital recorders, they have had to adapt. 
They are doing better at the adapting than many of the clients! The 
switch will mean much faster turn around and lower costs: no more FedEx 
delays and charges. Who would have thought we'd be thinking of overnight 
as a delay?!

I'm guessing your using a burned image if your checking the md5,
unfortunatly the ubuntu ISO files have an issue when burned sometimes (it's
not uncommon unfortunatly) try reburning the image at 4x and see if that
helps, I know the md5 checks out fine but somthing gets lost in translation.
The other option is to get a pressed CD, I have one sitting next to me if
you want me to mail it to you drop me a line off list w/ your address.

I mistakenly changed units in my reply to his original, which he
duplicated. I also said less-than rather than greater-than. My
proofreader must be on vacation.

I believe he's doing >10MB files.

Actually, I prefer to use a Weber. (Sorry. Couldn't resist.)

I'll have to look into it and see what it would take to get past the

It works fine for me.

I have had the problem, every time I upgrade firefox, that
middlemouse.contentLoadURL will get set back to the default of
'false', and I have to go back to about:config to fix it.

But normal copy-n-paste _is_ the default behavior, and I don't see why
firefox would change it on you (it didn't change for me, when I
upgraded).

Doesn't work here with a console or terminal. I can only paste to a GUI 
text editor like gedit or gvim. Middle-mouse button pasting works in 
gvim, but not in vim in a terminal (gnome-terminal). I don't seem to be 
able to paste text copied from Firefox into terminal vim at all, not 
even by right-clicking and selecting "paste."

At the Clinc (with help from Keith) we determined that there is a 
bug in the download file and it cannot be installed. Screw it.

   It was the default before, Ali. That's why I'm at a loss to figure out why
it stopped working.

   How about running PostScript files from a printed Web page through
pstotext? Does that work for you, too?

Bummer. I went to the Motorola web site the other day and saw (I think 
in the RAZR phone accessories section) a cable that comes with software 
for $35 or so. Naturally, it's for Windows. Hopefully this phone will be 
popular enough for someone who knows how, to fix the moto4lin problem.

   Apparently, my inability to cut-and-paste from firefox to a text file
(using joe in a virtual console) is web page dependent. Many -- most? --
pages seem to copy just fine, but certain ones (a wikipedia page comes to
mind) just won't. Shrug. Must be user error, I guess.

   However, I'm still having difficulties converting .ps files to .txt with
pstotext. This is what I see in the latter:

###### ###################
##### ####################
#############
######## ###################
####### #######################
####################### ####################
########################################
################

   Could this be related to the .ps file having MozillaCharsetName:
iso-8859-1, and my system defaulting to some other character set?

Thanks,

Rich

Is anyone using F-Secure SSH Server on solaris or linux? I am working with
the authors of jsch (java secure channel), a java ssh2 implementation, to
make jsch work with F-Secure. Unfortunately, none of the machines that are

not need a login. They think the issue we are seeing is in the key exchange.
Any help would be apprecitated.

A friend has a Samba file server in Tacoma, and remote client machines
in New York, some of which are Windoze.  Opening a 1M Word file on a
New York machine takes 3 minutes - obviously far too much talking back

Is there some sort of caching mechanism that can speed this up?  Ping
time between the machines is <200msec, and it is possible to set up a
local Linux/Samba server in New York (remotely administered from Tacoma).

Don't buy the cable from Motorola. They want $25 for it. It's just a standard USB to mini-B cable. Fry's has them for $10-11 or so, and doubtless you can find one even cheaper. You may already have one if you own other snall USB devces -- my digi camera and my 60 Gb pocket drive both came with one.

The cable is actually useful even if we can't get the software to work. That's because if you plug it into your computer it will charge the phone's battery off the USB port. I've found that kind of handy.

Message-ID: <444EA485.6010502@acm.org>

I recently went through an interesting problem with a drive that was 
going ... away.

After running the SCSI utilities and verifying the drive it worked for 
awhile.  Problem was somewhere further in so on the lightly loaded 
system it didn't show up right away.  ( Good thing this was an used 
system :-) So after replacing the drive ( actually upgrade in size and 
an extra drive ) I decided I should maybe exercise it a bit.  It's been 
a few weeks so I can't remember all the commands -- off the top of my 
head -- I used but basically I tried to fill the disk with random data 
then ran shred against the files to get a little more exercise.

Short story getting very long here so I'll just ask if anyone has 
written a script to ( mostly ) fill a drive with files.  Stopping before 
it crashes the system ie. it doesn't quite fill the drive or partition?

I found a method to 'zero' a drive ( dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1m ) 
but I want to write to file(s) so the OS doesn't have to be reinstalled.

My wife has decided to try using Linux on a new computer, so I need
to migrate as much of her application data from Windows on the old
computer to Linux on the new computer.

Fortunately, all the important stuff is on Mozilla (web and email),
gaim and OpenOffice.

Has anyone done this before?  Any recommendations on the best/easiest
way to get those apps on Linux to import her data from their Windows
versions?

then just create (a) file(s) with random stuff until the drive is full:

dd if=/dev/zero of=file bs=1m


or separate files:

while true ; do (( N++ )) ; dd if=/dev/zero of=file.$N bs=1m count=1 || break; done

Colin,

   As far as OpenOffice.org is concerned, open them in the linux version. Then
save them. If they were originally in the .sxw format, save them in the .odt
format (Open Document Text). The data files don't care on what platform
they're opened because it's all in ASCII text with xml markup.

   Don't know about moz. The bookmark file should be plain text.

So far, I haven't seen any other way to get the software than to buy the

Colin, 

I don't use Mozilla for e-mail, so I can't address that issue. But I
sure do give OpenOffice.org a daily workout on both my Windows desktop
and my Linux laptop. There is never a problem. Whatever platform I
created a document on is irrelevant; it opens up perfectly on the other
computer. The trick is to make sure that the new Linux computer has the
same or newer version of OO.o, and that all the fonts that are
installed on the Windows computer are also installed on the Linux
computer. Most font licenses allow installation on multiple computers,
so just copy them into /usr/share/fonts and that should do it, although
you might have to use spadmin to get OO.o to see them. 

OO.o keeps some user preferences in the default template, so if you can
find it on the Windows computer, copy it over to the new Linux
installation. That also goes for macros, which are typically stored in
templates. (That's how Gates decided to do it, and to my everlasting
annoyance, OO.o copied the scheme.) Just copy over the default template
and any custom templates that she created for herself. Best practice is
to let OO.o put them where it wants to -- I decided I wanted all my
personal templates in a different folder and I'm constantly fighting
OO.o to get it to find them.

She should have OO.o installed and running exactly like her old copy
within half an hour.

Message-ID: <444FA784.3040507@telestream.com>

I am in need of some (Intel) CPU testing software, similar in idea to 
what memtest does for memory.  The googling I've done leads me to 
endless no-name shareware products.  I've never had to test for this 
problem before so I'm not sure what's available and reliable.  Can 
anyone offer some direction, or is a benchmark package the best bet?

What I was sure was a motherboard problem is now confirmed as 'not'.  I 
replaced the PS as well, but the server still randomly freezes and the 
hardware monitoring shows fan RPM's from 0 to 160K (yes that's 160,000) 
when they look like they're at normal speed to me, and CPU temps far 
beyond what would be functional at 78C.  All of this is false or the 
machine wouldn't function.  A quick reboot into the BIOS shows normal 
readings.  None the less it's locking up frequently.  So I just replaced 
the mem and CPU and brought the originals home for testing.

   Well! This looks like what I went through with an Athlon CPU very recently.
My unintentional stress test was trying to build a 2.6.x kernel. Another,
which I did not try, was compiling X from source. The latter will almost
certainly show up any problems if you run on a known-good system board and
RAM.

   As soon as I put a loaner CPU in the box I was able to successfully compile
the 2.6.16 kernel. Couldn't do that on the suspect CPU.

PDA phones. 

Unfortunately the BB integrates well with Windows, slightly with MacOS,
and not at all with Linux as far as I can tell. Who has experience
integrating a BB with a Linux desktop? I would like to be able to use
the phone as a wireless modem (if I'm paying for unlimited data, I want
to use it!) and I would like to back up the dialing directory and

I know about the XmBlackberry and Barry projects on sf.net. Neither
seems quite ready for prime time, though I'll happily accept evidence to
the contrary.

Comments? Feel free to email me directly and I'll summarize.

As is sometimes the case, I wanted to avoid something that may have 
errors anyway.  I will probably throw FreeBSD on it and do a buildworld. 
  That involves several hours of compiling as well and I am familiar 
with it.  I am hoping to find something that says: This CPU fails x out 
of x tests.

Have you considered a Palm Treo instead?  PalmOS has worked well with
Linux for quite a while and it's generally a less closed system than the
Blackberry.  I just replaced my Kyocera 6035 with a Treo 650 and I
really like it.

Try downloading [1] and running the Mersenne Prime Test [2]. This 
eliminates any OS problems and tests your CPU against known numbers. 
I've used this in combination with Memtest in the past to diagnose 
problems.

I'll second the Treo.  I've had four treos (270 x 3) and now a 650. 
There has always been great support for Linux with Palm products.  I
can use Bluetooth and much more.  The interface is, imho, much better
than blackberry; I tried a blackberry for a week and disliked the
interface so much I decided to go back to the Treo.  Palm has a much
better hardware interface, and the software is built around the
hardware.  For this reason I would never recommend the 700 since
Windows is not meant to run on a tiny screen like on a Treo.  I'll
leave it up for debate whether Windows is right for even a desktop
computer.  And, throw in the fact that you can run a SSH client on
your Treo for emergency shell access to your servers, and I'll never
leave the Treo fold.

I like the Palm UI, but their prices are ridiculous. I heard about a lot
of bugs when the 650 first came out; have those all been fixed?

Thanks.

I'll third that.

I use the treo 650 (with sprint's unlimited Internet: $15/mo) as a
bluetooth modem for my laptop. And of course having an ssh client on the
phone itself rocks. Best phone ever :)

Now I'm hoping the next non-windows Treo will have a GPS integrated.

Both have very small keys. My fingers are not too fat for the tiny keys,
but I know it will be an adjustment for either BB or Treo.

I actually looked at the T-Mobile MDA (Win Mobile 5.0), but I'd rather
avoid Windows if I can.

I have been using a Sidekick for almost 2 years now and it has a lot of
advantages. The ssh client is very usable, the keys are big enough that
I rarely have typos, the screen is big and bright. It dropped about 8
feet to the floor a couple days ago with no noticable damage whatsoever.
But it has no BT, no USB, no integration with anything, no easy backups
to a disk that I control. The SK3 will be more of a brick and will
probably have wifi, but I'm not sure that's such a big win.

I can justify a certain amount of money for features, but I have most of
the important features with the phone I currently use. I can save about
$50/month by putting a couple of accounts together and I can get a new
phone from Amazon along the way. I can't justify $600 for a Treo but I
can justify $100 for the new crackberry.

Or I can wait for the summer phone deals, and maybe get BT, EDGE, wifi
and GSM in one convenient handset. I hate charging the phone every day
though, and anything with wifi will suck battery power like crazy. 

I'm trying to keep an open miond, but if I'm going to switch phones, I
want the new one to be significantly better in the ways that are
important to me. SSH, PIM features, voice and display quality, battery
life, integration: that's my list (not in any particular order).

78C? That's wayy not good.. then again, I guess that's >=half the
problem with the modern Intel chips...  and 160krpm, sounds like your
BIOS/lmsensors is scaling that wrong.

What I've done before for another employer (and am now recreating
again...) is to build upon CTCS (GPL abandonware from the VA Linux
days.  Anyhow, it's a rough structure for doing repeatable, repeated
and well-logged unit tests for hardware stability.

The default tests including kernel builds (optionally concurrent, -j n
options, etc) as well as tens of other specific tests for disk
functionality, several very good memory tests, CPU tests (which I
don't use BTW)...

It's a fairly complex environment, and unless you want to sit down and
learn something, a bit more than what you may be looking for.  Some
old standbys' I use are

  sha1sum (/proc/kcore | /dev/mem)
  openssl -speedtest
  make -j32 bzImage (lower int for this if low mem/few cpu's)

If you're running a recent kernel, make sure you set up mcelog
(download the newest and compile) and run this per-minute dumping to a
file.  This will output if there are any CPU/BUS/MEM ECC errors
detected, and frequently (depending on chipset) drill down to the CPU#
or DRAM bank.

Well, remember, I just replaced the motherboard and power supply and the 
exact same problem is back.  I don't for a minute actually believe the 
proc is that hot.  This is a Supermicro bare bone unit and the video and 
nic are onboard.  So when I replace the board, I replace everything.

I'm up to 8 passes on the memory (Corsair) now with memtest and no 
errors yet.  Bad memory is not very common, but the few sticks I have 
had come up bad in the past show up in memtest pretty quick, if the 
computer boots at all.  So I don't think it's the mem.

But even more rare is a bad CPU.  I have only ever had one and I wasn't 
sure that the board it was in is what took it out.  So that's why I need 
some way of testing this chip.

My test box doesn't even have a hard drive in it right now.  But thanks 
for this info.  I will keep it in mind if something a little more 
convenient doesn't show anything.

Hrm, mine will only be ~$200 when I actually get around to sending in my
rebate, after renewing my agreement with Verizon.  I wouldn't be able to
justify $600 for it either.

I don't know about any bugs with the 650; mine has been reasonably
solid, aside from problems with a few applications I used on my PalmOS
3.x, none of which were actually important.

The only thing I'm kinda bummed about is that the SD wifi card is not
supported, even though there have been promises of support in the near
future for a long time.  OTOH, I'm not sure if I'd actually shell out
$100 for a wifi card for a phone; I sure as hell won't pay what Verizon
charges for data service either.

Just two notes then:

I've seen plenty of RAM issues caused by incompatibility, things that
crash under load and misbehave/segfault, but memtest will NEVER show
anything.  You may want to try reducing the clock/CAS rates (probably
a group non-turbo setting in the BIOS).

P4's DO have extremely high max operating temps... unfortunately. 
I've got a set of Opteron 850 systems that will sanely operate up to
71C if a fan dies, but norm is around 55C FULL load.  Oddly, the P4's
should be throttling down if they do get that hot, so perhaps the
thermistor/lmsensors calibration is just way off.

Bad CPU's are not at all uncommon, especially in consumer-level systems.

Good luck!

Greetings!

Last month, the gauntlet was thrown: Eugene announced their first Plone Users Group meeting. Well, we Portlanders won't be left out -- we are inviting anyone who is interested in learning, discussing, and sharing around Plone (the best Open Source content management system, http://plone.org) to the first Portland-based Plone Users Group meeting. We hope that this initial meeting will kick start a group that meets monthly to help new developers and consultants get started, to facilitate the transfer of knowledge among veterans, and to encourage networking and collaboration. Most importantly, this first meeting will include snacks!

---------------------
- SPECIFICS -
---------------------
What: Portland Plone Users Group Meeting:
When: May 9, 2005, 5:00p - 6:30p
Where: TACS Conference Room, 1001 SE Water Ave, Suite 490, Portland, Oregon ( http://www.tacs.org/about/dirtemplate.asp?pID=47 )

-----------------
- AGENDA - 
-----------------
* Introductions, Welcome, and Food
* Why Plone?
* Plinkit: Plone for Public Library Websites in Oregon and Beyond
* Where do we go from here (optional brainstorming for those interested)

I've been very happy with the PSC2510 from HP. I has worked with every 
flavor of Linux that I have used so far. Hated the Lexmark that it replaced, 
which never worked with Linux. So, in short, I concur with your inclination.

I can't say a lot of good about HP, but have to admit, they have some 
really good printers, that are compatible with Linux, OSX, and the other OS.

In addition, my father-in-law is very happy with his Epson. He's using the 
other OS from up north, but they are known to be linux friendly. If you find 
something you like, check it at http://linuxprinting.org/ before you buy.

P.S. Stuck on that other OS too, until I can replace my router.

Apparently most of them are supported. Other
manufacturers may offer good support as well, but I
think I'll put in a bad word for Epson. Epson brags
about the small size of its ink drops, but I get the
impression that if one of their printers isn't used
frequently, the print head clogs easily and becomes
unusable. That's exactly what happened to me--I forget
the model number. It worked perfectly until I did no
printing at all for a few weeks, and never worked again.

I'll second the bad word on epson. I have known few people that have had 
decent epson print device that liked them, most people I have known 
wished they would have never bought it. (This doesn't apply to 
commercial use printers.)

OK, I see some more reasonable prices at Amazon for the 650, but the
plans suck. I'm happy with T-Mobile, even though their coverage isn't
perfect; it's good enough in the places I go most. Unfortunately, they
don't offer the Treo any more, and getting an unlocked one is not in the
budget.

Yeah, T-Mobile has the best data prices. That another reason that I want
to stay with them.

I like the idea of integrated wifi, but I'm not convinced that the
reality of it is all that practical yet. There are rumors that the
integrated handsets (VoIP/GSM with seamless roaming) are supposed to be
here this summer, but I don't want first-generation hardware anyway.

I'm reviewing the code for XmBlackberry, and if it looks decent, I'll
try the crackberry and work on the code in my 'free time'. T-Mobile
dropped the price to 'free after rebates' to match the new Cingular
price at Amazon, so it's not too expensive to try. I can always go back
to my Sidekick if the crackberry is too painful.

Thanks to all who replied!

Weird.  Even the cheap-o D-Link routers have proper web interfaces.
Though you can get a Linksys NAT (no wifi) router at FreeGeek for way
cheap right now.

Oh, and another good word for HP officejets.  Combine with an HP
JetDirect and you can run the scanner with your web browser.

Any body here interested in tutoring high school students?  I have begun math 
tutoring at Lincoln High School in Portland, and I find that it is much needed 
and rewarding.  In the next 8 weeks ('till school ends) anybody with the time, 
inclination, and skills would be most appreciated.

Any school I am sure would appreciate the offer.  I chose Lincoln because that 
is where my son went, and I knew some of the people.  No response needed here; 
just go make yourself available if it appeals.  It is clear that there is a 
large body of high quality talent in PLUG, so I thought I would plant the idea.

There are thousands of youth in this city who need tutoring in all 
kinds of things. You have no idea how big the need is. I am tutoring 
a 14-year old Guatemalan student who is working on learning 
English, speaks Spanish and a native Guatemalan language, and 
can't read or write in any of them. Smart as a whip but so 
educationally disadvantaged that the local school system can't 
deal with him.

But this is OT for PLUG list, so I'll shut up now. Just go do 
something for the next generation.

I am not sure if I am looking in all the right places, but, my Ubuntu

Since I am not having problems at this point, it's just a matter of

Hello,

Is anyone planning on driving back from Bellingham after LFNW on
Saturday?  If so, I wonder if I could catch a ride.  Email or phone: 
503-888-1488.

Thanks,

On Debian, I did "aptitude search avahi" and found that the following 
are automatically installed:

i A libavahi-client3          - Avahi client library
i A libavahi-common-data      - Avahi common data files
i A libavahi-common3          - Avahi common library
i A libavahi-compat-howl0     - Avahi Howl compatibility library
i A libavahi-glib1            - Avahi glib integration library

None of the other avahi libraries or packages are installed.  There are 
four avahi packages (plus python2.4-avahi) and a bunch more avahi 
library packages in the database, including some QT integration libraries.

I haven't tried to remove these, so I'm not sure whether any of them 
would take other packages with them.  Their presence doesn't seem to be 
causing me problems.

The LWN comments are kinda interesting:

Rough summary: ReiserFS mounts/unmounts slowly and generally uses more
CPU, Ext3 deletes files slowly, XFS and JFS are generally (but not
vastly) superior performance-wise.

My take-away: stick with Ext3 unless you can benchmark.

I'm a simple user, neither advanced in my technical skills nor in my 
needs. In all the years I've been using a computer of one type or 
another to do the simple kinds of things that I do, I've used a variety 
of different file systems -- fat, vfat, NTFS, ext2, ext3, hfs, hfs+, and 
ReiserFS. The only time I've ever had a problem vis-a-vis file system 
corruption and data loss was with the last.

That's purely anecdotal and unscientific, of course, and says nothing 
about the merits of ReiserFS for tasks I don't require, nor anything 
about the virtues and capabilities of the various other file systems 
available. But you know what they say, "once bitten, twice shy." People 
can benchmark themselves into the next millennium; me, I'm sticking with 
ext3.

Comcast provides instructions on how to use your Comcast account web 
space for file storage. My sister-in-law has a Comcast account and no 
web sites, so I set up a few secondary users for her, disabled e-mail 
for them, put an index.html file with "This page intentionally left 
blank." as its only content and told her how to gain access to the site 
using (cringe) I.E. to access ftp://upload.comcast.net. (That's what 
Comcast has for instructions. It seems to work.)

She and my wife are now happily sharing files.

Thanks to all for the various recommendations.

Look for me at the 'fest;  my wife and I will be driving back Sunday
morning, though we were planning on lunch with a friend in Tacoma and
a stop at the Centralia outlet stores.

Brian Martin will be coming back Saturday night.

I head north at the crack of dawn tomorrow, too late to hitch a ride up...

Subject: [PLUG] Passwords
Message-ID: <4451EA53.9000406@subtend.net>

I was discussing passwords with someone the other day, and I was telling
him some of the methods I've used.

I've always been a fan of diceware[1], modified to use my own wordlists.
 Remembering a 4-6 word sentence is easier than a long password with
mixed case, numbers and symbols.

I was thinking about how you could take it further to make it easier to
obtain a password using a diceware like phrase as a seed.  But I'm not
sure if it actually makes it more difficult or just adds a layer of
obscurity.

One example would be to take a _very_ easy phrase and sha1sum it for a
password.

echo plug rocks|sha1sum
085c0af93df7240980dbee4c484f24c5cc4b86b0  -

Using that hash (maybe even include the "  -" at the end) as the
password.  Obtaining this is faster than decrypting from a master GPG
file.  But in this example you don't know what it's for.

Maybe a mnemonic where DNS is applied, or a purpose, combined with a
standard prefix and separator that is only known in the mind.

echo myvoiceismypassport =: www.pdxlinux.org|sha1sum
2635de49082a81a5b71bfadd1c0df5df406a54c2  -

echo myvoiceismypassport =: www.visacardx.com|sha1sum
4a7fdd148fb1862b1af9618ac08e61a9fb196c6d  -

Of course most banking websites don't give you the opportunity to use
such a long password (why is this?).  Maybe the hash could be used up to
the maximum char's the website will take.

Another benefit (possibly) is one could obtain their password for
something on any system with `sha1sum` on it (taking into account trust
issues of the random host you are on).

..hmm.. what about a known passphrase seed, separator, DNS, and a fixed
pattern of hashing (lets use 551 to remember md5|md5|sha1):
echo myvoiceismypassport =: www.pdxlinux.org|md5sum|md5sum|sha1sum
585d7a2429b4a842fa696c89b2f3352609929a7b  -

Maybe involving md5sum lowers our available bits for hashing that it
makes sha1 less effective.

Another method, more for generation, I've tried is `cat
/dev/random|strings` and just wait a while, choosing a number of lines.
 Not sure of the strength of this either.

This is more of a post to spark a discussion of what weird ways have you
used for password generation, policy, storage, and use?

Random password musings brought to you by 3am.

Try base-64 encoding the output of the random device to get 
password-friendly characters:

   head -c 32 /dev/urandom | openssl enc -base64

You can also ask OpenSSL to generate random stuff for you:

   openssl rand -base64 32

Some sort of multimedia player/plugin (e.g., mplayer, mplayer-plugin).

Jason,

   I had not known of its existence. Looks like a nice idea, but the available
version is from last November -- about 6 months old. Think I'll make my own.

Thanks for the suggestion,

I found this a few days ago.

And it has a good write up about max password lengths and random numbers.

   Using CIDR all IP addresses in 1.2.0.0/16 is the notation. If I want to
specigy those within a narrower range, I can write 1.2.128.0/24. What I still
don't completely understand is how to represent a network address range
between whole integrals of the dot-quad notation.

   For example, if I want to specify all addresses in the range 1.2.128.0
through 1.2.255.255, do I write 1.2.128.0/20?

No, you write 1.2.128.0/17.  1.2.128.0/20 would give you the range
1.2.128.0 through 1.2.143.255.  The /17 is the number of bits set in
the 32-bit netmask from left to right, and thus the number of bits to
determine the network.  The remaining bits are used to determine
unique hosts:

Netmask (255.255.128.0):
11111111  11111111  10000000  00000000 (first 17 bits)

Network (1.2.128.0 through 1.2.255.255):
00000001  00000010  10000000  00000000
through
00000001  00000010  11111111  11111111

Running burnK7 on my AMD64-3000, I couldn't get it to go lower than 33C,
or higher than 47C.  The first jump from 33 to 40 was snappy.  Maybe you
could combine this with a kernel compile.

Subject: [PLUG] External USB 2.0 hard drives
Message-ID: <4453EA43.9000804@writemoore.net>

I want to get an external USB 2.0 hard drive in the vicinity of 300GB.  
Newegg has a nice-looking simple 320GB model from the WD "essential" 
series that does just USB 2.0 and doesn't come with (useless for 
non-Windows/OSX) back-up software, yet I still can't find anything 
"official" saying, yes, this drive should work fine with Linux operating 
systems.  I'm 99% sure it should be fine, because it seems to lack 
proprietary gotchas, but I thought I'd ask in case there is some 
glaringly obvious warning sigh I'm missing?

The WD drive I'm interested in is here:
http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.asp?driveid=166&language=en

The Newegg.com listing for the drive is here:
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822136001

I can understand any hardware manufacturers not wanting to make it sound 
like they will support 200 different Linux distros, but honestly how 
difficult would it be for them to include a brief footnote that a 
particular piece of equipment should work without problems on any Linux 
OS with USB support?  It's frustrating that so often they won't even 
provide that kind of basic information.  It's when I see "Supported 
Operation Sytems: Window blah blah Macintosh blah" and no Linux that I 
have niggling doubts.  It's yet another factor that slows Linux adoption 
because it's another case of expecting Linux users to be able to read 
between the lines and "understand" that, yeah, this is fine despite the 
refusal to spell that out, or no, this will be a problem because of x y 
or z.

Of course, if anyone knows of a vastly superior drive at a similar price 
point, feel free to chime in!

Turning the question around might be easier: Are there any USB drives
that *don't* work with Linux? (I've heard of problems with USB 2.0, but
once the user has USB 2.0 working, I've never heard of any drives that
wouldn't mount.) If there are any, why won't they work?

I'm pretty sure the USB mass-storage protocol is simple and stable 
enough that no manufacturer besides olympus has managed to screw it up 
(and that was a camera.)

I'm curious if anyone has experience with the drive enclosures that come 
with a shiny button?  Does the kernel say anything when you push the 
button?  Can that be repurposed to trigger a udev event?

1 year warranty?  This *is* an IDE drive after all.  Buy these two and 
get a better price and 5 times the warranty on the drive.  I have the 
USB enclosure and it's high quality.  They have them at Fry's if you 
want to take a look at them.  They want a lot more for them though.

Well, people have problems with other devices (cameras, audio players 
and phones, mainly) that connect via USB 2.0, so I don't know if that 
extends to drives or not. WD makes a "NetCenter" drive (NAS) that they 
do say supports access from "Windows, Macintosh, and most Linux based 
computers," though they also say the drive can not be reformatted as 
FAT, NTFS or HFS(+) because it uses a proprietary file system. I don't 
know what that file system might be, or why they *do* explicitly state 
that this drive will work with Linux and do not explicitly state that 
other drives they make will. That's the kind of thing I find confusing. 
But maybe you're right, and all USB 2.0 hard drives just work, period.

I know someone who bought a USB CD burner that wouldn't work with her 
Vaio laptop, but it turned out that the Vaio, even though it supported 
USB, was picky about external devices, at least when it came to external 
burners. The device drivers wouldn't install properly or wouldn't work 
properly once installed. She had to return the HP burner she bought and 
get one made expressly for the laptop instead. Of course, it was 
considerably more expensive. So I guess I just don't like to assume 
everything will work with everything, even when something seems like it 
should.

In the past, I had problems with some USB chipsets in conjunction with
2.4.X and some of the early 2.6.X kernels.  The drives would mount, but
they would lock up after moving an hour or so of data.  More information
at http://www.keithl.com/usb2bug.html.  I don't know whether that bug 
has been fixed - I haven't had time to pursue it or even verify if it
is still there on newer kernels.

Hmmm.

KDar (Dar with KDE user interface) is what I have been using to back up
to my 60 GB USB pocket drive. KDar locks up about one backup out of
three. I wonder if I have been blaming KDar when I should have been
blaming USB.

Message-ID: <1146292626.44530993026ee@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I have a situation where there is a desire for telephone and network
connectivity in two buildings 200 feet apart.  I have a 
wired/wireless ethernet between the buildings.  

One possibility is doing a phoneline and running DSL on top of it.  
Question is, does anyone offer an ADSL dslam that is cheap for a 
single point to point link?  I don't need ADSL2, ADSL2+, SDSL, 24 
ports, etc.  

Is there an inexpensive way to feed a POTS signal through an IP network 
and convert it back to POTS at a remote location?  I go from 
100baseTX to 802.11b for my ip link.  I hear that 100baseTX lines 
have a free pair that can carry POTS. If I can feed POTS over 
802.11b wifi, I don't need to do DSL.

I have a Verizon modem and a netopia modem from CenturyTel that are 
both ADSL capable.  What is the best way to cash in old DSL modems 
that have no use?  Are there any local businesses that will take them?
