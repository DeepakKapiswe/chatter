   Has anyone here used a portable scanner (preferably with a USB interface)
on a laptop/notebook with Xsane?

   I'm looking for recommendations for a unit I can carry with my portable
office to scan a lot of letter-size pages.

Dwight,

   My research on the Sane Web site gave me some insight. I was hoping folks
here could provide more current information since I don't know how
frequently the devices list is updated.

   The one portable scaner I indentified so far is the Fujitsu SnapScan S300.
It's supported "good" on the Sane page; perhaps by now it warrants
"complete" status. But, it looks good enough for scanning documents and the
occasional color photograph. The selling price is about $245; Amazon seems
to be the lowest. It uses USB 2.0 and apparently a fast host helps. This
scanner has several lauditory reviews, including one on a Web site for
portable tools for lawyers.

   Unless I learn about another scanner I'll see if I can get client approval
to buy this. There's a reported "4 foot high stack of documents" at a state
agency that I'll need to review. I won't need copies of everything (whew!),
but there will be quite a few pages I'd rather scan than copy on paper and
scan back in the office.

   On the cable issue, I'll have only the notebook's power cord and, perhaps,
a small, external, USB mouse attached so one more USB cable won't matter to
me.

Rich,

We've got a couple SnapScan S500 scanners at our office. They're 
connected to Windows workstations, so I can't comment on Linux 
compatibility. Also, the S500 line has a different document feeder 
than the S300s.

I will say, however, that S500s are very good at scanning documents. 
Our legal and and contracts folks, who use them frequently, give 
them high marks.

Paul,

   According to the sane-project.org Web site, the S500 is discontinued, and
I cannot find a price for it. The images I see for that model suggest that
it's comparatively large and not designed to be easily transported in a
briefcase or computer bag. The sane support for the S500 is "complete."

Thanks,

Rich

Bill,

   I noticed the excellent support for Epson, but none of them is
particularly small. Carrying a full-page flatbed scanner is not as
convenient as one designed for portability, even if the latter is slower.

> perfection 1650 with Sane.

   This model is no longer available. The numbers are much higher now. :-)

Thanks,

Rich

Yes, the new ones look tempting.   If you don't need a distortion free
image,  you can use a digital camera in a macro setting and just carry
around some type of tripod.

Subject: [PLUG] Minitab dilemna...
Message-ID: <1254425477.3097.11.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

It looks like it is atrociously expensive to buy a licensed copy and
worse than that, it requires from what I can tell a Windows XP system
that has 512 megs of ram.  I don't have that.  I have my Linux system
with 512 megs of ram.

What is the ultimate alternative to using Minitab 15?  I'm needing 
to use it for a stats course.  Unfortunately, I don't know of any 
way to use it remotely.  Do the Windows computers at PSU have any 
means of being accessed remotely?

I have the demo version of Minitab 15 which I dowloaded last night, 
but that is only a 30 day solution and then I guess I have to rent
2 more months.  Man this Minitab outfit is ridiculous.

Will Crossover Linux, the most recent version perhaps, run Minitab 15?

I suppose I have a laptop that is in use now by my father with 512 megs
of ram and Windows XP, but it's in use.  I actually have a Pentium 4
desktop computer with a 1.80 Ghz processor and 256 megs of ram, but
that isn't enough ram to run Minitab and I don't know what kind of
DIMMs it takes.  It's an SIS micro atx board.

So I'm stuck either grabbing a copy of XP somehow and dual booting on
my Linux system, running Minitab via Wine, or using something else.

I'm not familiar with Minitab or it's feature set ( I used SPSS in
college), but there are plenty of free alternatives.

R - http://www.r-project.org/ - is a stats programming language.
Gretyl - http://gretl.sourceforge.net/ - is more for econ regressions,
but might work
PSPP - http://www.gnu.org/software/pspp/ - is built as a free
alternative to spss

http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Free_statistical_software lists many
more alternatives.

Add Scilab - http://www.scilab.org - to the list.  It's _not_ specifically
for statistics, but if you can get by with a normal number cruncher
program it may be the way to go.

I've heard good things about R from folks who are in the know.  I would
get a copy, but the control and communications systems work that I do is a
very good fit for Scilab; statistics are either peripheral to what I do,
or are vary narrowly focused on control and communications problems, not
'general' statistics.

You may want to investigate the class a bit -- if the course content is
"to find out the conditional distribution with x2 = 5 just type in this
here Minitab command and see the result" then you probably need to get
Minitab (or find a course that actually teaches the subject, not the
tool).  OTOH if the course content is the math, and Minitab is just used
as a way to get there, and if you're happy with getting _no_ support from
your prof with R or whatever, one of the alternatives may be just fine.

Talk to the prof, too -- I could see a department head who's used to a
commercial program demanding it's use.  The prof may have a favorite
open-source program already, and may be willing to help you on the side. 
OTOH, if his head turns around three times and he barfs green slime at the
mention of open source, you may want acquiesce to Minitab for the
duration, and get something better later.

If you came to the LinuxFund party last week for LinuxCon, you saw how cool
Club 915 is.

Well, for those of us that miss Jax as a nice wifi-friendly downtown location,
Club 915 has offered their upstairs for use at no charge, provided we arrange
in advance and spend some money on food and drink.

Unfortunately, they don't have a projector or even a nice wall to project on,
but if we can sort that out, the place is ours.  The wifi was pretty spiffy in
any event, and they have a pretty well stocked bar and food menu.  Also,
they're a mere block from both the trolley and the Max for those of you in
transit mode.

I'll have more details about who to call soon, but feel free to start the
rumors.

Normally I don't recommend re-inventing the wheel, but if you're a computer
science student, you might try to take this as a learning experience and
implement the various statistical methods and tests you're learning about.
When I was taking stats I did this as a way to make the class more enjoyable
and I felt like I learned a lot from it.  Your mileage may vary.

Bill Harp wants to help arrange these to begin with, since it was his work to
make the party in the first place, and he doesn't think random people calling
the restaurant will work as well.  Feel free to call his cell at

I use a Canon Lide 30. When I bought it a few years ago it had been
discontinued, so I got it for about $80, about 20% off. It is
completely supported with Sane, but the later models are not (or were
not at the time). 

I bought it because it is lightweight and runs completely off the USB
2.0 connection. I have actually carried it to PSU in my backpack along
with my Thinkpad T61, although the combination is pretty heavy if you
also need to carry a couple textbooks.

It has always "just worked" with every version of Ubuntu.

Message-ID: <4AC58BE8.1050807@zenlinux.com>

Hello,

At tonight's meeting I mentioned schroot as a friendlier way of setting 
up and using chroot environments. As long as you're working with Linux 
distributions that support network-based installs, this tool can be 
quite handy. I use it to manage chroot versions of Debian that I develop 
in for an embedded project I'm working on.

The schroot project doesn't have an official web site as far as I know, 
but this tutorial will get you up and running with it:

http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/566

This was another article that describes setting up Debian build 
environments:

Enjoy,

Look at Sage math ( http://www.sagemath.org/) for a general
mathematics package. It has R, numpy, octave, etc. etc. I'm not a
mathematician, so I don't know a huge amount about it, but I have been
checking it out as I am an engineering student and mathematica was
recommended to me. This is a *very* actively developed alternative to
just about any math package. They have a little of everything, but of
course the things that are most complete are the ones that have
interested developers. So some areas are more mature than others, I
gather.

It's very powerful right now, though. Normally you can check it out at
http://sagenb.org/

I even have an account there (it's free) and play around with stuff
sometimes. It's got fun graphing and lots and lots of math that's way
beyond me - rings and ??? But I just went to look at it to get the URL
and the whole thing, sagemath and sagenb both seem to be down right
now. First time I've ever seen that, but it would be when I want to
recommend it, of course!

I'm sure it will be back up soon, but right now it's broken.

You can get a taste of it at:
http://sagemath.blogspot.com/          (author is originator of sage math)

Message-ID: <20091002100454.775db38b@kmfms>

I'm a huge fan of schroot!

Here is a little trick that I have found extremely useful for the Linux
build systems that I manage.  We have an Ubuntu Hardy build server with
Debian lenny and etch chroots, and this in /etc/rc.local:


# clear out any old/stale sessions
for SESSION in `schroot --all-sessions -l`; do
  schroot -c $SESSION -e
done

# start the schroot sessions
SESSION1=`schroot -b -c lenny`
SESSION2=`schroot -b -c etch`

# start services in the schroot sessions
schroot -r -c $SESSION1 /etc/init.d/parabuild start
schroot -r -c $SESSION2 /etc/init.d/parabuild start


This starts our build server software (Parabuild in this case) in both
chroots.  This allows us to run builds for different versions of Linux
on the same hardware with zero overhead from virtualization.

You could use the same steps to bring up any type of services you might
need.

My first stop usually is http://www.distrowatch.com, then I search for livecd:
http://distrowatch.com/search.php?category=Live+CD#distrosearch

I have tried live versions of OpenSUSE, PCLinuxOS, Fedora, Ubuntu (and
Mint), Knoppix and a couple others, and the one that seemed to "just
work" on most of my PCs was Ubuntu.  Knoppix came in a close second,
but I'm not a big fan of KDE, Knoppix's default manager.  PCLinuxOS
and the others all needed ndiswrapper for my wireless, and OpenSUSE
got my video height wrong and showed only the top half (after loading
the proper drivers it works, but just not out of the box).

Another neat demonstrator is PenDriveLinux
(http://www.pendrivelinux.com/).  Their claim to fame is running from
a USB stick, and as long as the destination PC can boot from USB,
you're in business.  The advantages of LiveUSB versus LiveCD:
  Faster boot time since the USB stick as a higher transfer rate.
  The CD drive is not occupied, so demonstrations of CD/DVD operations
can be performed.
  The package takes up less than 700MB, leaving room to save
configurations and even installed apps.

Ubuntu's LiveCD includes an app to make a LiveUSB.

                       ^^^^^^^^^^ Keith's emphasis

FYI:  8 of us went to Afters at the Lucky Lab Northwest.  We asked,
and were given the back room for free.  We spent $60 (I kept track) . 
I'm guessing that is typical for us. I don't know how that will
change with a different location, different prices, different
food, different general meeting topic attracting different number
of attendees, etc.  There will be big nights and slow nights.
What happens on the slow nights?

I bring this up because of an unfortunate incident at the Cedar
Hills McMenamins a few years ago - a "peacemaking" event between
two factions of another group.  Faction A arranged for the back
room.  As part of faction B, I was unaware of the arrangements.

About 15 of us met, haggled, ate, drank, and trickled out afterwards.
I, and another fellow who was there to learn about the kerfuffle,
were the last two people in the restaurant, having left the back
room and moved to a booth to continue our discussion.  We were
flabbergasted to be presented a bill for the room, minus the food
consumed by the group, about $110 ( $200-$90, IIRC ).  Since we
were the last ones there, they stuck us with it.  The other
fellow and I split the tab.  The faction fight resumed, with
one more adherent on our side.

The takehome lessons: (1) make sure everyone attending knows what
the arrangements are, and who has financial responsibility. 
(2) don't be the last to leave.

I'm ambivalent about Club 915, but Randal often has good ideas,
so I'll follow his lead.  However, given one widely circulated
story on the web about Club 915, I want to know the arrangements,
preferably written down and approved by Club 915 management.  If
the management is upset by this request, then they may also be
upset (and call the cops, two blocks away) when we balk at a
large room fee that they unilaterally decide we owe them.  Best
to start out with a clear understanding.

I'm not accusing them of dishonesty.  However, honest people
paying salaries and rent and taxes often have different
expectations than their customers.  It is a rare skill to
satisfy customers, employees, and vendors simultaneously.
Many failed businesses in Portland attest to that rarity.

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu Update - Packages could not be retrieved
Message-ID: <4AC6359D.7080807@comcast.net>

I received notice via the orange gear icon that Ubuntu (8.04 hardy) has 
updates for me to install. I told it to do so. It's a relatively long 
update -- for me, anyway -- so I wasn't paying attention most of the 
time. I decided to look back and see how it was doing and found a dialog 
box with the following message:

----------------------------------------------------------------
Some of the packages could not be retrieved from the server(s).
Do you want to continue, ignoring these packages?

[No] [Yes]
----------------------------------------------------------------

That's not very informative. How would I know if I should continue or 
not? All I can see in the update window is, in the upper half of the 
window, a list of the last 5 packages(?): samba, samba-common, 
smbclient, ttf-opensymbol, and winbind. Each of these has a filled in 
blue square to the left if the package name. I recall that there were 
packages for Open Office, too, but until I respond to the dialog box I 
can't do anything with the update window. The lower half of the window 
starts with

Version 3.0.28a-1ubuntu4.9 (or is it lubuntu?)

followed by some security update descriptions.

So, is the best answer yes, or no, and why?

Thanks.

I always answer "No" when this happens and re-run the update - the 
packages you successfully downloaded will be cached so it won't take as 
long the second time.

Since apt uses dependency checking (and the update notifier app uses apt 
in the background), if you tried to continue with the install I assume 
it would only update the packages it downloaded that have met 
dependencies. So you shouldn't be able to bork your system with either 
answer, but to be on the safe side I always say No and run the updates 
again.

I would say no, simply as it has not committed anything at this point.  I'd give it a day or two and see if anything has changed.  You might also try changing your repo servers in synaptic.  I usually use osuosl repos here in the valley.  They always seem to perform well.

Personally, I would hand her an Ubuntu disk, because I know it would have
a good chance of making her happy, and it would require the least work on
her part to get to the point of looking at a live Linux screen.  The list
looks like a great thing if you're looking for the best disk to hand her
-- but I wouldn't just send a link and leave her on her own; I'd engage in
some evangelicalism.

I would hand her an Ubuntu disk because (a) I use Ubuntu, and I can vouch
for it being a very good distro for the recovering Windows user, (b) it
has a friendly little "install me now" button right there on the desktop,
and (c) I've used the live CD and it always works.

The _only_ other Live CD distros I've used are Knoppix (which I like, but
is really made to _only_ be a live CD distro) and DSL (which is cute, and
worked well for me when I needed a distro I could put on a 256k USB stick,
but is _small_).  So I can't call myself an expert on live CD
distributions.

In my experience it sometimes works to say "no" and try again immediately,
or at most a few hours later.  As near as I can gauge the issue is server
availability, they never seem to stay inaccessible for long.

I would also consider mint, as it is ubuntu without the hassle of hunting down proprietary codecs, etc.  I have used their live cd and it works well.  It is yet another flavor but well done and set up a bit more like a windows machine would be.

I am on their mailing list, and it was a virtual server that crashed
hard and they have had no luck getting it up again. Some kind of
hardware problem, possibly. They switched servers that it's on, and
changed DNS pointers, so it should be up for everyone soon if it isn't
already. Both links work for me, now.

Why not try it with VirtualBox[1] or VMWare[2].

I myself run several different Linux distros using VirtualBox, with XP as
host (as well as Linux as host and other Linux and XP as guest).

Subject: [PLUG] (K)Ubuntu email sync
Message-ID: <4AC6D4C0.8020806@verizon.net>

The latest project has me with 2 computers.
I am running Kubuntu on one and Ubuntu (both 9.10 Alpha 6) on the other.

I have been trying to figure out the best (easiest) way to sync 
Thunderbird on both machines.  The obvious goal is to keep the clients 
current on what's read, forwarded, replied to, etc, so no matter which I 
grab and run with, I am current.  I can leave a copy of the message on 
the server, but Verizon dumps them to me after an unknown period of time 
and I am then stuck with deleting a large batch of previously read messages.

I plan to switch to a Gmail account in the not too distant future, but 
am paying for Verizon service for now.

Google keeps telling me to switch from POP to IMAP.  AFAICT, Verizon 
doesn't support IMAP.

So, I am wondering if rsync (rdiff?) is the most reasonable solution.

All ideas gratefully accepted.

TIA,

Bruce

What I've done is to point ~/.mozilla-thunderbird to some server that
both machines can access.  I've used SMB to host a directory and it's
worked well.  It's the default sharing mechanism in Ubuntu, and
because this was limited to my LAN I could have used NFS, but SMB
allowed for authentication.  If encrypted NFS was available (versus
tunneling NFS via SSL) I'd have gone that route so I could sync mail
remotely.  I've since switched to Google, to which I can IMAP with
Thunderbird or use their web interface if I'm not near my own PCs.  I
used IMAP to move all of my archived mail to Gmail.

Gmail has lots of features: polling up to 4 POP accounts, intuitive
filtering, excellent spam filters, autoresponder, and more.

Some users have had success with gmail drive, which literally mounts a
gmail account as a filesystem.  I'm sure there are some drawbacks, but
it's free, and free is pretty cheap.

Then switch to gmail now. IMAP is the answer. You can have gmail check 
your Verizon account so Verizon not offering IMAP is no longer an issue.

Thanks Matt,

I DL'd VMware's Workstation and it works, but I'm not sure I'm ready to 
fork out $190 for some Linux investigation. VirtualBox might be OK but I 
can't seem to get the dang thing to do anything other than 640x480 or 
800x600. Guess I'll keep digging.  My video is built it ATI 3200 on my 
ASUS motherboard.

Subject: [PLUG] OOPS - Need to recovery back to virgin Windows XP Boot
Message-ID: <4AC91F5A.30007@aracnet.com>

While trying a few things like trying Ubuntu desktop and server loaded 
on a spare HD in my system... the drive is no longer a spare :(

My ASUS motherboard appears NOT for follow the BIOS setup info and 
things are a little messy now.
I have IDE 320GB drive, a 320GB SATA drive and a SATA DVD in the system. 
The system was booting off of the SATA HD running XP. I had setup a dual 
boot to Ubuntu Desktop and then decided to look into Ubuntu Server.  I 
set the SATA HD to DISABLE. Set the IDE to the bootable HD after the DVD 
and NO 3rd option was spec'd.  I tried to bail ( unsuccessfully ) when I 
thought it was going to nuke the SATA drive...

Now If I unplug the IDE the system will not boot, even after I spec the 
SATA drive. With the SATA drive selected and the IDE plugged in I get 
'2' boot screens
#1 is to pick one of the Ubuntu Server versions or XP. Then pops up the 
selection for Ubuntu Desktop or XP.  I want to get back to just the SATA 
drive and XP. I was doing some reading and is it as simple as recovering 
the MBR using XP? AFTER I backup all my XP stuff?

Thanks

Easybcd for xp will rewrite the mbr back to the original one

My ASUS motherboard appears NOT for follow the BIOS setup info and

I have IDE 320GB drive, a 320GB SATA drive and a SATA DVD in the system.
The system was booting off of the SATA HD running XP. I had setup a dual
boot to Ubuntu Desktop and then decided to look into Ubuntu Server.  I
set the SATA HD to DISABLE. Set the IDE to the bootable HD after the DVD
and NO 3rd option was spec'd.  I tried to bail ( unsuccessfully ) when I
thought it was going to nuke the SATA drive...

Now If I unplug the IDE the system will not boot, even after I spec the
SATA drive. With the SATA drive selected and the IDE plugged in I get
'2' boot screens
#1 is to pick one of the Ubuntu Server versions or XP. Then pops up the
selection for Ubuntu Desktop or XP.  I want to get back to just the SATA
drive and XP. I was doing some reading and is it as simple as recovering
the MBR using XP? AFTER I backup all my XP stuff?

Thanks

Well, it's all in the details... Thanks.  I've downloaded that version 
and will give it a go as soon as ny backup is finished and I fix my MBR 
on that box.

The VirtualBox secret you are missing is to install Guest Additions.
Not only does it allow you to set the size of the virtual machine's
window, it also allows transparent use of the mouse, and a few other
goodies.

Should I be loading the 'Windows' version since the host is Windows? If 
so this did give me some nice visual affects and the mouse thing but 
never could get it past 800x600.  More tinkering later

There are a couple, not free, that I've used.  news.individual.net is
about $15.00 per year and carries lots of non-binary groups.
usenet-access.com is about $7.00 per month and carries binaries.

For whatever it's worth, Google groups carries non-binaries, but
there's no filtering.

I wnet looking and the current version only supports Vista. Had to go 
back to 1.6 or 1.52 before it quit warning me it I didn't have Vista 
loaded.  All in all I just wasn't comfortable with this tool and decided 
to use XP's Recovery Console off the CD.  I then needed to Fix the 
boot.ini file to nuke the prompt for the remaining Ubuntu parition.

thanks

Oh! 

I assumed you were running VirtualBox on Linux. I have no idea how, or
even if Guest Additions works with a Windows host.

Sadly though, it doesn't cover Oregon covering only 8 states, Canada,
and Australia.

http://opentaxsolver.sourceforge.net/

I don't know if it is out of beta yet.

This may be an option when Oregon is added to the list of states that
the program supports.

I'm not sure I like that this tax software doesn't use the interview
approach, but then again I haven't tried it.

Well, so much for the OSS community can't produce tax software.  I 
think a group of accountants though working with a Linux programmer
selling a commercial Linux tax app might be more fruitful.  I 
wouldn't mind paying $20 to download open source tax software if 
that means that the developers can stabilize it and support the 
Oregon tax code.  People shouldn't have to pull out Windows and 
TurboTax or do their taxes on a web site.  Yes you can go to a 
tax preparer, but a lot of times that costs more than using 
TurboTax.  A decent tax software package, commercial or free, 
should be open platform anyways and I like to hear that e-filing 
will be possible with this open source tax software.  It looks 
like opentaxsolver is on the right track at least.

../orinoco_cs. After checking with lsmod that they were loaded, I ran
'/etc/init.d/networking start' and the pcmcia Orinoco Gold card came up on
eth1. Whew!

   The power-off-on-shutdown issue remains unresolved. I added 'apci=force
pci=noapci" to the kernel line in /boot/grub/menu.lst, but it makes no
difference. This is not a fatal flaw, just a bother since previous versions
of the distribution would turn off the power after the system was halted.

Is apci a typo or is that actually how you have it in menu.lst?

It should be acpi.

I had no complaints about Easynews, plus I liked the web interface option.

Every usenet provider I've ever heard of goes through some hiccup
periods from time to time, so they will all have naysayers.  Even
Easynews, which was very reliable for the year-and-a-half I was
subscribed, had a rocky few weeks this past winter.  I guess the trick
is to look at those who seem mostly reliable.

Thank you,

It is obvious that IMAP is the answer.  I have taken some time to read 
what Google had to offer on the subject of POP vs IMAP.  I already have 
a Gmail account.  Looks like I will be doing some reconfiguring over the 
next several days.

And Mogerly, this is not a plug-talk topic.  I avoid 
plug-talk because there is no decorum there.  It is

This project is open source and it targets Linux so 
that you don't have to go through some commercial 
outfit on line or through Windows.  It is one thing 
to use a credit card on line, but doing your taxes 
on line is quite another thing entirely.  I have 
no interest in doing that.

I sincerely hope that someone with the know how 
joins the project and adds Oregon to the list of 
states that it supports.  Right now, the project 
is useless to people living here.

Has anyone successfully run Minitab on Linux without using vmware,

I don't know yet if I can use something else, I'm still waiting 
for the first assignment.  I emailed professor Tableman, but she 
hasn't gotten back to me at all.

I'm beginning to wonder if PSU has a special deal for students to
purchase Minitab where Professor Tableman doesn't want to rock 
the boat by responding to the idea of using an alternative?  If
that's the case, I can't say I blame her.

Anyhow, if anyone has had success running Minitab on Linux without
using Windows, I'd like to hear about it.

Message-ID: <8a8466290910052053q8f8fd5eged21c1b2c29d3404@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I've been trying to implement the parallel sort algorithm described at
http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~cs284/lectures/29oct97/sld001.htm. I'm currently
working on quicksorting some sublists. However, only sometimes does my
parallel quicksort routine produce sorted sublists, as expected. Sometimes
it fails to sort. I believe this is likely do to a race condition involving
my qs_arg object, but I'm not all together sure; my attempts to mutex it did
no further good. Can someone with a keen eye spot the race condition and
propose a solution?

Thank you!
Jameson Williams

It appears that you are using a single qs_arg variable and passing a
pointer to it into each thread that you create. The next cycle of the
loop then clobbers everything in this variable's contents, even if the
thread you spawned is still working on it. Don't share your qs_arg
memory between threads. Make sure you don't make this a variable
scoped locally to your partition_index loop though, either. I'd
suggest pre-allocating an array of number_partitions variables for
your qs_args, or something similarly transparent.

Subject: [PLUG] Using Postfix WARN Action
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0910060556150.5526@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   The Postfix book tells me that using the WARN option on a restriction
(such as in the /etc/postfix/header_checks file) logs the warning while
delivering the message. However, there is apparently no marking of the
message so it's clearly identified as one that tripped that warning.

   I want to examine delivered messages that contain
"Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64" in the header. Adding that string to the
header_checks file with a WARN option does not explicitly identify those
messages.

   Use of the warn action is not giving me the results I want. How should I
be doing this? Alternatively, if I use the HOLD option instead, where are
those messages held until I can examine them?

Message-ID: <e2aeccd60910061204j5ef8015ej49761d57858acc76@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Plug,
I'm working with moblin which is fedora/ubuntu like so I figure this might
be the best place to ask. I have an atheros chipset which is causing the
system to lock up, it's reproduceable with a few moves in the moblin UI. I
have an alternate kernel module I have built and it will run on the system,
however the ath5k/ath9k drivers are built in to the kernel and are being
used by the system. Rolling my own kernel is an option but I'd rather try
and avoid it right now. What is the fedora/ubuntu way of forcing the system
to use a module instead of whats built in to the kernel for driver support
for a given piece of hardware? I've tried aliasing the network interface in
modprobe.conf but not getting any joy with it. Google so far has failed me.

Thanks,
Drew-

I have done 1/2 of what you want, but it has been a while, so I'l
giveyou what I can verify today:

$ ls /etc/modprobe.d/
blacklist-ath_pci.conf  blacklist-firewire.conf     blacklist-watchdog.conf
blacklist.conf          blacklist-framebuffer.conf

That is the area you want to mess with to prevent the 'bad' module from loading.

how you get yours to load is a different problem.  /etc/modules still
works, but I think there is a 'new way' (like putting a file in
/etc/modprobe.d/ that is dedicated to your issue, makes updates easer)

I assume that you've put the module in /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/somewhere.
Do you get an error if you try to modprobe it in from the command line?

Carl,
Thanks, at least I know I'm messing around in the right area. The problem
is, the driver being used is built in and not modular so blacklisting it
won't work in the traditional way at least from what I understand.

There's a good thread here, on this very same topic: 
http://groups.google.com/group/sci.electronics.design/browse_thread/thread/8f3125aca6957e53/61ae1ca73615ec55?lnk=gst&q=Usenet+providers%3F#61ae1ca73615ec55.

IIRC one of the posts points to a page which critiques a number of 
providers.

Thank goodness my ISP still does newsgroups!

Ali,
The module actually loads and runs fine but the built in support in the
kernel is being used, so ath5k isn't listed as a module since it's built
statically in the kernel itself rather than modular. So, I need to get it to
stop using the built in support and using the module I load.

Are you sure? that seems very odd for ubuntu, and I am pretty sure it
was the ath5k module that I blacklisted.  this was about 1.5 years
ago, so 3 ubuntus ago...

Carl,
It's not quite Ubuntu proper, just Ubuntu/Fedora like, hence my confusion as
I'm used to Slackware. I went into the kernel config and indeed ath5k was
built in and not as a module.

Has anyone successfully run Minitab on Linux without using vmware,
virtualbox, etcetera?

I don't know yet if I can use something else, I'm still waiting
for the first assignment.  I emailed professor Tableman, but she
hasn't gotten back to me at all.

I'm beginning to wonder if PSU has a special deal for students to
purchase Minitab where Professor Tableman doesn't want to rock
the boat by responding to the idea of using an alternative?  If
that's the case, I can't say I blame her.

Anyhow, if anyone has had success running Minitab on Linux without
using Windows, I'd like to hear about it.

at least back in 2007, someone has:

I didn't know something could get a rating of "Garbage"

http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=213

but clicking around, it also got Gold...  but but that is for an old
version of everything.

I would try current versions.  With Ubuntu, it is dirt simple - like
put the CD in, maybe click setup.exe, and get an "install wine?"
dialog.. more clicking, and next thing you know setup is wizzing away.

Subject: [PLUG] The Case of the Disappearing Modules
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0910061728340.5526@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   This is part of the on-going heroic saga of upgrading our Toshiba Tecra
8000 from xubuntu-8.04 to xubuntu-9.04. The upgrade's complete, but it takes
this ol' workhorse a _lot_ longer to boot than it did with last year's
distribution. Much longer. But, that's for another day.

   What I don't understand is why the pcmcia wireless card modules (orinoco
and orinoco_cs) did not load after the machine was shut down and rebooted.
Seems to me that when modprobe is used to load modules, they remain in the
list to be loaded at the next boot. Do I need to add them to /etc/modules.d/
some place, too?

Thanks,

Rich

The discussion here is enlightening:
   http://lwn.net/Articles/355628/
The quick summary is that the WNR3500L uses Broadcom closed source 
drivers, so the kernel is still stuck in the 2.4 series.  A better 
choice for an open router might be the Linksys WRT160NL, which uses 
Atheros.  Apparently openwrt has added support for the WRT160NL.

Perhaps Russell can tell us more.

I have Clear and haven't had any issues at all.  Although for port
forwarding I had to login to the clear modem and configure the ports and
then configure them again in my router.  After a little trouble everything
is working good.  I'm using Ubuntu.

In a nutshell: I would not recommend the Clearwire mobile broadband,
based on my experience with their non-mobile service.

I did had a Clearwire account for my home broadband for two years.  I
was extremely unhappy with the billing department (I don't believe the
true rates were disclosed until my first bill arrived), and the
service.  More than once I ended up using 3G via my phone because the
clearwire connection was so sluggish.

Customer service tried to help by having me very gradually shift the
orientation of my home modem to get a better signal to a (better?)
working tower.  This was a very painstaking process ("ok, shift it
another 1-2 degrees clockwise, ok, stop" <3 minutes later> "nope, that
dropped the signal..").  I would be concerned about the effect of
crowds or thick walls on the signal with a mobile card.

Clearwire also developed a habit of notifying me of account changes /
alerts by redirecting a single http request to one of their servers
instead of using email/phone/usps.

I've been meaning to dig into tethering with the G1, but I haven't had
the motivation since I switched to DSL.

I use T-Mobile broadband and haven't had any service issues at all. Works
fine with Fedora and Ubuntu. I received slightly better speeds with the
service in Seattle (around 3Mbps vs 1.7 in Portland).

The financial/investment community has had a strong commitment
to Unix for decades.  The remaining question was when to move
from Unix to Linux, and  most large firms made the back-office
conversion years ago.  Most of the desktop is still M$.

In fact, OSS has already moved to the next level.  The battle
for the kernel is raging between better latency and better batch
throughput.  In environments where being 1msec late for a trade
can cost thousands of dollars, hundreds of times a day, low
latency wins.  This was the subject of one of the talks at
Linuxcon (by a coder for a big European stock trader, IIRC),
who was showing how latency was increasing in recent kernels.
I suspect he just needs to recompile his kernels ...

On the other side of the battle is shops processing humongous
amounts of data.  There are user-level equivalents of this 
battle;  I do a lot a bulk computing, and have different kernel
needs than a gamer.

So we may already be in the late stages of the war, with the
defeat of the M$ Axis in sight, and beginning the squabble over
post-war borders.

First, I have very little experience with Clear, only one evening in a
pub, shortly after rollout last January.  But I do know a little about
it that I'll share.  First, all three of the widely advertised WiMax
services in Portland (Clear, Sprint and Comcast) are running off the
same towers/radios.  That is, Sprint and Comcast are simply
reselling/rebranding Clear service.  As such, you can't expect any of
them to be noticably better, connection-wise, since they are all
fundamentally the same service.

As I understand it, the mobile WiMax system that is deployed in
Portland is not widely available in other cities, though they say they
are expanding.  Here's the current list of cities at the Clear
website:

  CLEAR is Available in:
    Abilene, TX
    Amarillo, TX
    Atlanta, GA
    Bellingham, WA
    Boise, ID
    Corpus Christi, TX
    Killeen, TX
    Las Vegas, NV
    Lubbock, TX	
    Midland/Odessa, TX
    Milledgeville, GA
    Philadelphia, PA
    Portland, OR
    Salem, OR
    Waco, TX
    Wichita Falls, TX

Note that Clearwire that was deployed earlier in places like Seattle
(note the distinction between Clear and Clearwire is important), uses
an older fixed-WiMax technology, which I understand does not work with
the Clear devices.  There are protocol differences.

Anecdotally, in Portland, I have heard some people who are very happy
and some people who are not at all happy with coverage where they are.
Signal quality apparently is quite variable.  I haven't tried to test
that, as I don't have the service myself and probably wouldn't
consider getting it until there are linux drivers for the Clear mobile
device (a USB dongle that lacked linux drivers as of last spring).

There are Intel WiMax drivers in the vanilla kernel these days, but as
of last spring, the USB dongle that Clear was providing was not using
the Intel WiMax chipset.  I got my hands on it briefly and snagged the
vendor id from the usb bus.

  "Bus 004 Device 031: ID 198f:0210 Beceem Communications Inc."

My understanding is that's from a Broadcom-owned subsidiary or
something.  Google is telling me there still is no linux driver for
this device available today.

I also understood that as of late last spring, you could not yet
"activate" mac addresses of devices that Clear wasn't selling
directly, so the WiMax radios in some new Intel-based laptops would
not work either, even though they *have* linux drivers.  That might
have changed by now, but I haven't heard either any confirmation or
even any rumors that it has.

Basically there are two ways to use linux with Clear right now: a)
using their "home" modem, which you can interface with using cat5
(bulky to cart around with you though); or b) a wimax/wifi device that
connects to the Clear network that also integrates a wifi access
point.  I guess that's nice for sharing, but perhaps a bit bulkier
than ideal.

The only other little tidbit is that a Clear representative came to
one of our PTP meetings and indicated that Clear service could be
used as backhaul for shared wifi hotspots (like a PTP node).

I have no experience at all with cellphone based broadband services,
so this post is stamped with a gigantic FWIW across it.

I saw the device reported this last week or so, and even before seeing
reference to the broadcom radio, I saw the list price of $140.  There
are better options at that price point.  

Also, I have yet to become enamoured of 802.11n.  My experiences so
far, although limited, were not positive.  Two nearby Cisco/Linksys N
routers (one of the sleek-looking black models) rendered the RF medium
unusable.  802.11g is way faster than your internet connection, so all
the marketing language (even if it was true) about super high
bandwidth 11n is mostly useless.

I used to have a Verizon broadband card through my work.  After
initializing the card in windows, it worked just fine from my Debian
install (dual boot laptop).  The setup is just like a modem, using some
sort of dialer software.  Google knows the number, username and
password.

The only problem I had was with HP printer software in windows (not the
drivers themselves, but the support software) and an OpenVPN connection
using the Verizon connection software.  Their router would detect some
funky network activity and shut down my connection.  I would boot to
Linux and find that everything would work just fine.

The only place I took the card was to Packwood WA for autocross racing.
Not exactly a booming metropolis, but I did get a signal and was able to
make a connection from several different locations around Packwood.
There wasn't a lot of speed in those connections, but they were stable.
My Verizon phone works in roaming mode in this area, but there were no
extra charges on the broadband card.  As far as I know, Verizon is the
only service in the area, fellow racers often ask to use my phone.  An
Internet connection at the track was a novelty.

Sadly it was a victim of the economy.

That much I've been aware of. In a previous life I worked at
a closed source UNIX shop that was a vendor to an exchange.

I've not kept my ear to the ground with regards to Linux adoption
for awhile.  I've been fortunate to work in places where it was
the rule rather than the exception for quite awhile now.

No accounting for taste. ;)

I've been doing a lot of job hunting lately. Being a Lisp developer, I
have been searching for jobs in this area. I am finding that financial
companies are the biggest users of custom Lisp solutions (at least
from my vantage point). These companies have money; they're not using
Lisp for its up-front cost savings. My theory is that even though it
costs more to hire good Lisp developers, they're willing to pay it for
the best solution. What I don't understand is how non-computer people
discovered Lisp amidst all the marketing noise.

   I downloaded a database from an agency's Web site, and the date formats
are not that used by SQL (YYYY-MM-DD). Instead, they are in the form of
D/M/YYYY (or DD/MM/YYYY). Not only that, but the column they are in is the
second to last of 11 columns; a representative sample is:

1993-1|Water Quality|WVR|Yamhill, City of|Yamhill|Hamlin|Holt|Npv|NPDES-Waste Discharge Limits|7/6/1993|01993-1|Water Quality|WVR|Yamhill, City
of|Yamhill|Hamlin|Holt|Npv|NPDES-Waste Discharge Limits|7/6/1993|0

   Is there a practical way to apply sed and/or awk to convert the date
column above from 7/6/1993 to 1993-06-07?

   Ah, never mind. I exported the table in .csv format, imported it into an
Xess-SE spreadsheet, converted that one column to use the @DATE() formula,
exported the spreadsheet, and the date format was correct for SQL.

You did say ?practical?. A perl script would be the most practical way
to deal with this file. I'd want to examine one line of text at a
time, parsing each line on the | characters. The data field would
always be the 19th element of the resulting array (counting from
0). The date would then be parsed on the / characters, the elements
rejuggled, and padded with 0s if neccesary. Then the whole line would
be reassembled with the new date inserted into position 19, and
written to a new file.

I'd give you a sample script here, but that would take all the fun out
if for you.

   Thanks, Joe. I'll save this for another day.

   I could have dug into my gray book on awk, but using the spreadsheet was
much faster ... for me. I just don't do enough awk or sed programming to be
proficient.

Much appreciated,

Is this suppose to be two lines?

Perl OK?

while (<>) {
     chomp;
     my ($f1, $f2, $f3, $f4, $f5, $f6, $f7, $f8, $f9, $f10, $f11) =
     split('\|', $_);
     my ($D, $M, $Y) = split('\/', $f10);
     my $newdate = sprintf("%04d-%02d-%02d" , $Y, $M, $D);
     print join('|', $f1, $f2, $f3, $f4, $f5, $f6, $f7, $f8, $f9, 
$newdate, $f11). "\n";
}

Not elegant but works with the data provided.

   Well, Joe! That is super slick. Turns out the spreadsheet copied the value
rather than the formula so all dates were the same. I started over and used
your awk script. Instant success.

Many grasses,

Initially it looked like two lines munged together then I noticed it was 
the same data.

I like your spreadsheet solution.  Reminds me of my _early_ computer 
days (Well actually second early days -- the first early days were in 
the late sixties).

Spreadsheets were just nothing I had found a use for.  Then I needed to 
generate a big bunch of sequential numbers in blocks that were 
inconsistent is size and start points.

So a simple =A1+1 formula, copy/paste it into around 8000 rows, find the 
points where the sequence broke, type in the new starting number, export 
the values, and import them into the application.

Trivial use but saved four of us from days of having to hand key them in.

Seriously, whenever you start having variable names or column names or
anything names that end in "1", "2", "3", you're doing it wrong.

An array would have worked far better there.

You are right on there.  I didn't say in my post it was partially a 
joke.  Many years ago I was asked to add some minor functionality to a 
Fortran program written by a Civil Engineer.
   There was no documentation and the variables were exactly like this. 
F1-F18.  That made it interesting as they were used to to do some 
complex calculations and I, not being a civil engineer, didn't know what 
was being used for where.

Also I was caught up in the 11 fields thought.  Not a Perl hacker, just 
pragmatic.  :-)

Got a few of them hanging around where the script wasn't slapped together.

   Even if you were the CE who wrote the code, in 6 months you wouldn't
understand it, either. There's still a lot of FORTRAN code written by
scientists (and engineers) in the 1970s with no documentation. Punching
comments cards on the 029 keypunch took time and money (for the cards, for
the reading/processing/output of the cards) so most of us didn't do it. We
did draw diagonal lines with felt-tip pens on the top of the decks so when
we, or the operators behind the wall, dropped the deck we could put it back
in order within our lifetime. With a limit of 80 chars per Hollerith card
(and statement length) strange variable names were the norm. I've got lots
of horror stories of FORTRAN code I wrote, and libraries I used, in the '70s
writing ecosystem, population, and mathematical models for the S/360
mainframes.

So malloc calls a timeout and starts rummaging around the free chain,
sorting things out, and merging adjacent small free blocks into larger
blocks. This takes 3 1/2 days.

Maybe, but in a recent discussion in a (near) real time list and
from Linus's own recent rant the kernel is getting bloated. We do
have one advantage that $Soft will never have and that is control
over the kernel. I've been playing around with schedulers since
I to have ...

.. the above issue, I have one client where they run one single
large ETL process every hour, to them is is all block I/O. Saving
a couple milliseconds for a disk request or a ftp transfer ends
up saving them many minutes by the time 200-400 GB has been sifted

Another place I am aware of is doing HFT, High Frequency Trading. These
are the guys that are trying to shave not milliseconds but microseconds
off. They make the stock exchange guys look like they are using
calculators. They only have 60 employees, 12 with PhDs and have a
full time kernel hacker. They never even considered $Soft, they
still do work with a couple of 12 proc 4 core Suns. Alas they are
not in PDX.

One thing that would be interesting is a GUI (for the non techie)
users out there that could let the turn a few of the knobs, or at
least have 3 or 4 buttons for kernel options. Maybe not needed
now but soon.

Hopefully we learn a few things if not that Pogo comic strip will
become true again.

Pete,

   In my naivete I assumed the idea was for the linux kernel to be small and
additional resources added as needed as modules. I thought that for a
single-purpose computer the requisite modules could be compiled into the
kernel for speed, but doing so is a user option rather than a default for
everyone.

   From what I've read one of the major reasons for the collapse of the
financial systems are these finance and math PhDs who create derivatives and
mathematical models that are not only too obtuse for anyone to understand
(including the authors), but have serious unintended consequences.

I have experience working with math PhDs who were being employed as
java developers. Their code was horrendous. One-letter variable names,
2000-line functions, the works. Our rule was to never touch their code
under any circumstances for fear that the entire system would
collapse. Spooky premonition of the financial collapse, if Rich is
right.

Subject: [PLUG] Failed hard drive, field swapping
Message-ID: <20091012165247.GA15750@gate.kl-ic.com>

I was in Baltimore this weekend to present Server Sky to the AMSAT
satellite amateur radio symposium.  The other presentations were
all Powerpoint, and they went through two failing laptops and all
the usual compatability issues.

In the middle of the Friday sessions, my RHEL-clone laptop started
throwing bus errors and behaving badly.  A reboot got tangled in
hundreds of sector read errors.  I was planning to use my own
laptop for my Sunday morning webslide presentation, since the web
browser on their third laptop wasn't configured right for SWF or
Javascript (or a lot of other things, they were fighting it all
weekend).

Fortunately, I had brought along the Ubuntu Heron hard drive that
I use at Linux clinic, and a drive swap got me back on the air.
Using a spare drive bay and a USB flash drive, I was able to get
my presentation off the old hard drive and onto the Ubuntu drive.
The Sunday morning presentation went well, with remote control
and wydiwys navigation and animations all behaving splendidly. 
I even updated some slides an hour before presentation.  I would
have been in deep trouble if I was using M$. 

I was missing some of my usual apps on the Ubuntu drive, but the
really slow hotel wifi was still fast enough to add them with
synaptic, and config files from my home backups over the VPN.

I am back home, where I have an identical spare hard drive to my
RHEL-clone.  I am rsyncing the files from my wednesday dirvish
backup.  Next, I rsync the thursday and friday files off the
failing drive, some files off the Ubuntu drive, and I should 
be good to go, with no more than some inconvenience.  Another
spare drive (Seagate 160GB PATA) is on the way from Newegg, so
I can recover the next time this happens.

BTW, I did have some warning - the night before I go on a trip,
I make a dd copy of my laptop hard drive to the spare.  This time,
it failed halfway through (corrupting the spare).  So, I brought
the Ubuntu drive and the spare drive bay, and saved my butt.

Keith,

   Before I leave on a trip where I'll be making a presention using slides I
always copy the .pdf file to a USB flash drive. That way I have an extra
copy ready to go just in case.

I detect considerable derision toward all non-programers.  Too bad the
world cannot not be run exclusively by assembly language programers.
Think how wonderful life would be.

My father once attended a conference of architects and engineers. A
speaker remarked that if it were not for the engineers the buildings
would fall down, but if it were not for the architects the buildings
would be torn down. (He did not mention programers.)

One issue is rather then add modules if they are needed, just assume they
will be needed. Similar with the 'default' packages many of the
distributions include. For example why are Bluetooth packages 'default' ?

I think they are scared that a non techie user will say the feature is
not available rather then taking the time to download etc.

But I think it goes beyond modules, look at some of the things being moved
into K space, yes it is faster to process but .. back to bloat.

I don't know the solution.

I totally agree with one addition. Lets call it 1st generation or generation
n, but there were those even in the early days the understood things a
first year engineer should know, feedback. I say should because last year
I had to explain how to make a PID loop stable to a EE.

The one company I'm familiar with is now playing with generation n+2 or 3
or whatever. Part of their staff is there to prove the other wrong. An
interesting approach. On the personal side I think the whole thing is
wrong but then I think 90% of the people doing trading should not be.
Too much OT for PLUG.

On the flip side they are doing some pretty heavy stuff and have decided
to use Linux and I hope some of their work will make it back into the
public.

Denis,

   One does not need a CS degree to be a competent coder. PJ Plauger received
his PhD in physics before developing C compilers for main frames and being a
member if the ISO C standards work group. The only formal programming course
I took was Introduction to FORTRAN because the grad school at the U. of
Illinois insisted I take it after I was writing in that language for two
years. If one is writing code that is supposed to work and be maintained
then it's not unreasonable to expect some degree of knowlege regardless of
the training being formal or on one's own. I learned C and Python on my own,
with the help of books, on-line mail lists, and better qualified friends.

Me too.  Although the one time it happened (my fault; I left my battery 
charger in my hotel room for a 3-hour talk with 2-hour batteries) the 
show organizers not only coughed up a laptop, but they installed 
OpenOffice just for me, so I could give the talk in the native format 
instead of pdf.

Dunno what would have happened if I'd insisted I needed Ubuntu, too.

Not derision from me!  Afterall, I wanted to kiss them.  

In my case the underlying idea was fairly clear (well, except for all
the GOTOs which needed unscrambling) in the code, they just didn't
know how to execute it well, which made me feel like a genius and made
it easy to find order-of-magnitude improvements.  I would have been
clueless without the algorithm they dropped in my lap.

Indeed I did have two USB drive copies, and a CD copy.  I was
in the midst of writing an updated version of the USB copy
when the "bus errors" started happening.  I had the other
older copies, but I did not want to lose my updates.

The presentation machine was an improperly configured WinVista
box, which had problems with Javascript (something else was
preloaded which ate keyclicks before they got to my
presentation's Javascript).  It also ate the backspace click
from their wireless remote.  I did not want to get into that
zoo if I could avoid it.

A general problem with Win PCs is that the owners don't know
what is running on their machines, or have weird security tools
that semirandomly prevent innocent activity, and the owners are
afraid of making things worse.  Many attendees ran Linux at home,
but did not bring anything with them.  Most of these folks are
in their 60's to 80's, and program in solder and aluminum.

There were a few Mac laptops about, and I suppose I could have
recruited one of their owners, but as mentioned before, I already
had things working on the Ubuntu machine.  

BTW, most amateur satellites have small embeddded computers with
simple programming, a la PIC32, but no operating system.  They
were quite interested in the ALIX I showed them to demonstrate
low power computers, but for ground apps.  In orbit, they have
only a few hundred milliwatts for computer and and audio DSP,
and don't have an OS.

It is worth mentioning that you can apt-get install into the Ubuntu
live CD, as in, boot cd, open term, apt-get install... right into ram,
adds it to the system, just like running from a hard drive.  boot,
install openssh-server, ssh into the box.

I need cheap/light hardware to run some linux apps: mainly sshd and
dvgrab, and talk to a 100mbs eathernet and firewire.  firewire is the
curve ball, but i found:

http://www.globalamericaninc.com/product_info.php?products_id=1807613
mini pci firewire card

One thought is: I bet I can find 802.11b APs for cheap.  that is a good size.

"image" in this context, is a generic term for any snapshot of data
collected into a single file. An ISO is a type of image.

the .img files designate non-CD images, probably raw data, meant for writing
to a floppy or flash drive or some such, so they can be loaded onto the
specialized boards indicated.

   Is this coming Sunday clinic day? If so, I'd like to bring a blank,
writable cd-rw disk and use the high-speed pipe to download xubuntu-9.04.

   The upgrade did not go well; it takes about 5 minutes for the laptop to
boot while with earlier versions it was about 40 seconds. Also, the pcmcia
wireless drivers aren't loaded when the machine is rebooted. I'm hoping that
a clean install (I'll copy her /home/ directory to a USB flash drive) will
fix these two problems.

Yes, the clinic is this Sunday, but FreeGeek's pipe isn't all that big. A
typical home cable or DSL connection will bring the file to you in a few
hours. Wget even supports resuming interrupted transfers.

wes,

   I thought of sucking it down here on the DSL line, but that slows
everything while it's working. Perhaps I'll start it using shell overnight.

Thanks,

 Manual page wget(1) line 394

       --limit-rate=amount
           Limit the download speed to amount bytes per second.  Amount may be
           expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the k suffix, or megabytes with
           the m suffix.  For example, --limit-rate=20k will limit the
           retrieval rate to 20KB/s.  This is useful when, for whatever
           reason, you don't want Wget to consume the entire available
           bandwidth.


Start wget, get a feel for how fast it can go, then cut that in half
or so.  having your pipe saturated makes everything unbearable.
having it under heavy use makes things slower, but I find it very
tolerable.  drop it to 1/4 or so and you hardly notice - it just kinda
blends in with the normal erratic performance of the net.

My USB drive always comes to the Clinic with me. I keep all flavors of
Ubuntu for several releases back on it. It takes about four minutes to
burn a CD image from it using my laptop.

I have decent download speed with Comcast at home - about 2.5
MB/s. If the server or torrent is fast enough I can get a distro image
quickly. Last night I downloaded Karmic 9.10 x86_64 beta via torrent
and it took 12 minutes (over 200 generous seeders). If someone wants
something special, just let me know.

Drew,

   I've not used torrent. It would probably take me more time to find a
Slackware package, configure it, learn how to use it, and apply it than it
would to run wget in a screen session while I'm logged out of the system
overnight.

   Thank you, John. Xubuntu-9.04 (32-bit Intel) would be great. It would
probably take about 12 hours on my dsl line.

I had forgot until clue sticks hit me that it supported rate limiting ..
FWIW slackware ships with a client =)

   Not found when I grep for 'torrent' or 'bit-torrent' in the package list.
Must have some other name.

Do a google (verb) on

and see if any of that is helpful ... it was to me in the past, but that 
has been a long time

PS:  I remember a particularly helpful part that showed me how to view 
the "connection chat" to help debug the process and find out what the

Bruce,

   Thank you for your gracious offer, but there's no rush and Tim volunteered
to mail a xubuntu-9.04 disk to me.

Message-ID: <20091014010519.GA21707@deer-run.com>

Server Sky, Keith Lofstrom
6:30pm Tuesday, October 20th
Eugene City Brewery (downstairs)

The EPA predicts US data center power consumption in 2011 will be 120
billion kilowatt hours, or 3% of total US power consumption, doubling
every 5 years thereafter. Our work as programmers and technologists
will continue this exponential growth. This will have huge
environmental, social, and economic consequences unless we find
alternative ways to power the digital economy.

Server sky is a proposal to build large dispersed arrays of 7 gram
paper-thin solar-powered computer satellites and launch them into
6400km earth orbit.  A server-sat is a 100 micron thick, 6 inch solar
cell, with processor memory, and radio chips around the edges.
Server-sats use light pressure for thrust and electrochromic shutters
for steering. Thousands of server-sats position themselves in three
dimensional arrays, about 100 meters on a side. An array acts as a
large phased array antenna, permitting it to transmit thousands of
communication beams simultaneously to ground receivers and other
arrays in space.

A server-sat displaces 25 watts of ground-based electrical generation,
cooling, and power conversion. A server-sat does not need the racks,
cabling, power converters, land, buildings, and other infrastructure
needed to build a ground-based server farm. These savings alone may
pay for launch.  Server-sat arrays use unlimited space solar power,
and operate outside the biosphere. The environmental impact of power
generation and heat disposal is close to zero. In time, new launch
techniques, and solar cells made from lunar rock, can further reduce
the environmental and economic costs of manufacturing and launch.

Earth can return to what it is good at ? green and growing things ?
while space can be filled with gray and computing things.

   I've the GNU Ghostscript-8.63 installed, but when I try to convert a
printed Web page (*.ps) to text (*.txt), I get what appears to be raw
PostScript rather than ASCII text. I'm using Firefox-3.0.14.

   Has anyone else encountered this? Is it related to a more current version
of PS than that supported by ps2ascii? Are there alternative tools I could
use?

Could it be that the webserver doesn't support the output type?

Drew,

   Shrug. I display the page then use ctrl-p to print it to file. The .ps
file begins thusly:

%!PS-Adobe-3.0
%%Creator: cairo 1.6.4 (http://cairographics.org)
%%CreationDate: Thu Oct 15 08:26:56 2009
%%Pages: 7
%%BoundingBox: 0 0 612 792
%%DocumentData: Clean7Bit
%%LanguageLevel: 2
%%EndComments

   Looks normal to me. Wouldn't printing be a local thing unrelated to
whatever server is hosting the page?

Thanks,

Rich

My ps2ascii man page mentions pstotext as an alternative. It claims
that pstotext is actually better because it takes the width of
characters into account:

ps2ascii ignoriert die Schriftkodierung und kommt nicht sonderlich gut
mit Unterscheidung (Kerning) zurecht. Somit sollten Sie f?r PostScript
(aber gegenw?rtig nicht f?r PDF) pstotext benutzen (siehe unten).

Which means (roughly):

ps2ascii ignores the encoding and does not do especially well with
kerning. For that you should use pstotext for postscript (but
presently not for PDF).

Carlos,

   pstotext is much older than ps2ascii:

pstotext 1.9 of 2003-01-09
Copyright (C) 1995-1998, Digital Equipment Corporation.
Modified by Ghostgum Software Pty Ltd.

and the output is useless:

###### #
############ ###### #
## #### #### ##### ### ########## ########## ###
#### ### # # # #
########## ###### # ############### ############# #### # #### ##### #
############ ### #
## ###### ##### ####
##### ######### ########## #
## # ##### ################# #
## ##########
############### # ############### ####

   Both pstotext and ps2ascii used to work flawlessly. I cannot recall when
they stopped working, but it's a PITA that they have.

Thanks,

Rich

   I can cut-and-paste the text from the Web page to emacs, and ps2pdf works
fine on all files printed from Web pages to disk as .ps files, but it would
be nice to both learn why the converters are not working and how to get
working versions.

Yeah, you're hating it. The other thing mentioned in my man page is
that ps2ascii uses gv to do the work. Perhaps it's nothing more than a
frontend to gv. When was the last update to gv or to ghostscript? Can
you go back to the old version to test?

Have you checked apt to see if there's a version available?  If Ubuntu
lists one, that's your best bet of getting something that's the right
version.

I've noticed some glaring regressions in the printed output from
firefox in the 3.0 series.  A *lot* of new font "stuff" was added (eg:
ligatures) and it looks a bit like that impacted the printed output
pretty negatively... letter spacing (kerning?) is often very
inconsistent, to the point that I can't bear to read printed FF output
anymore.

Anyway, it's possible that Firefox is just producing really ugly PS.
If so, then Firefox may be the only thing affected by this problem,
and you could use something else to get text from web pages (lynx and
w3m will do it).  Or <cough> switch to Opera :)  (I would suggest
chrome, but it also has sub-optimal printed output.  Better than
Firefox, but not great:  http://imgur.com/A595C.png Take a look at
"just works" and "flexible" in that image to see some of the
differences.)

Carlos,

   I looked into this the last time. Slackware-12.2 has the most current
versions of gv and gs. I don't know if -13.0 has a newer version.

Rogan,

   I've suspected that the problems are firefox related, not the fault of the
GNU tools. Too much emphasis nowadays on eye candy rather than function.

   I have Opera installed because there are some Web sites that just stopped
displaying properly on Firefox. Example: Daryl Cagle's political cartoons.
With Firefox-3.x the first page displays, but every time I try to display
page 2 (never get past there) it instantly shifts to a "share me" page and I
cannot return from there. So, I use Opera for that site on the rare
occasions I check it. There's another couple of sites (including one federal
government contractor) that are built with M$ tools and work only with M$
clients. Public money in the latter case but they don't care. Opera works
on those, fortunately.

   Thanks for the insights.

Rich

Maybe I'm being dense here, but using "Save Page As" then choosing "Text 
File" from the Firefox File menu isn't acceptable?

   No, you're not being dense. I had not before noticed the drop down choice
box, with the "Text File" option, on the save dialog box. Since the default
is html code I assumed that was the only format.

Thanks very much for the lesson!

No one talks about package management in ubuntu much, probably because it's
pretty easy once you get the hang of it.
In aptitude package manager (gui version,  default on Gnome) you would just
type pppd and it will usually find one or more things; from the explanation
you might be able to figure out what you want.

KDE has some other package manager which works similarly.

If use the command line, you can type "apt-cache search pppd"  if you see
the package you want you type "apt-get install pppd"  or whatever you found.

Also there is a "dialup linux howto" (google) which might help you, although
those are getting really old.  It might give you the clue you need to get
going...

I'm running 8.10, and 'man pppd' coughs up a man page, as if it's in there.

On my ubuntu 9.04 (jaunty), I started aptitude, typed in ppp and saw ppp
package and pppconfig.  I suggest you try installing those, and then if that
doesn't work, keep trying.

Subject: [PLUG] Questions re lpr and imaging
Message-ID: <20091015230844.4b5431b9.johnxj@comcast.net>

I have a 90 MB PDF file that was supplied to me by the assistant to a
PSU professor. I need to print 250 copies of this 152 page file to a
Laserjet 8000DN (Clonescript 2.0, gobs of RAM, all the options). And my
Jaunty x86_64 computer has a dual-core 2GHz CPU and 4 GB of RAM.

The problem is that the file was created in Adobe InDesign by someone
who had never used InDesign before. Worse, while she is a great artist,
she has little concept of outputting images to lasers. The file has
hundreds of TIFF images at 300 dpi. All I have is the PDF; I have no
access to the original and, even if I did, the last version of InDesign
that I have is CS, where she used CS4.

So I am struggling trying to get output from this file within my
remaining lifetime. Oh, did I mention that the professor needs to take
the copies with him when he leaves for Africa on October 24?

I can print from Adobe Reader 9.1, but it takes 25 minutes for the
print job to start printing, and 24 minutes for one copy to print. The
printer is rated at 24 ppm and a normal 152 page file takes about eight
minutes per copy. And "RIP once, print many" doesn't work from Linux,
so each copy is re-imaged over and over; that is, each subsequent copy
takes as long to print as the first copy.

If I print from Okular I can shave a couple minutes off those figures,
but it's still hopeless. Worse, Okular's number of copies dialog box is
broken. You can specify any number you want, but you're going to get
one copy.

Evince does even worse than Adobe Reader 9.1

Foxit Reader is even worse than Evince.

So I spent half an hour printing to .ps file from Okular. Now I am
trying to send the .ps file with lpr, but it's not going anywhere at
all. I am using the following command:

lpr -P Laserjet_8000_Series -#4 -o Collate=True -o media=letter -o
sides=two-sided-long-edge ~/Kim\ \&\ Bom/Full\ Bom\ primer\ 15\ Oct\ 09
\ 2.ps

The command executes reasonably quickly, and a print job then appears
in Manage Print Jobs. But the print job appears to go nowhere. When I
look in System Monitor nothing is doing anything. I mean, if
Ghostscript  or some other process was wailing along at 100% CPU I'd
feel that at least something was happening. Cupsd sits and does
nothing, and nothing else that sounds like it has anything to do with
printing is doing anything. At the same time grep is sucking down one
of the CPU cores at close to 50%. Grep? What does grep have to do with
printing?

If anyone knows how to kick lpr in the butt, I'd like to know. Any
other suggestions are also welcome.

I don't know but it seems that taking your one copy to kinkos would be cost equivalent to printing 250 copies of a 150 page document in terms of paper and toner...Not to mention your sanity.

Not an option. Kinko's would charge 7 cents per side, creating a cost
of 10.50 per copy. I don't have $2,500 in my budget for this project.
My cost per page for toner is 1/4 of one cent per page. More important,
as the professor once opined about the climate in Africa, "it eats
books." Therefore, the paper must be heavy duty. And I have already
purchased the paper (108 gsm).

I think I need some way to massage the PDF into a more svelte
appearance. It needs either a girdle or a diet, and fast.

On a deeper level, I need to discover ways to print DTP files from Linux.

Marvell Dove and Freescale i.MX51 are two different types of ARM
processor classes. The published images intended for flashing onto
USB sticks and can be used as either live images a la livecds or
for installation.

It's expected that at least some portion of the netbook market will
become ARM based devices, given their relative low cost and low
power consumption.

I don't know enough about CUPS' internals, but that seems odd. Have
you tried adding the "-# num-copies" option to your lpr command line?

How about pdftoppm this puts each page of the pdf into its own ppm file.
These are just images and should not need as much processing to print each
time. That is if pdftoppm can even handle your file in the first place.

i'd use ghostscript to convert to pcl and then print the pcl file.  that 
will go much faster as you'll effectively have rip'ed it under linux and 
then the printer just has to put the toner on the page.  the printer will 
also be much faster if you can print it non-collated (250x page 1, 250x 
page 2, etc) and then manually collate.  or if you have the external 
collater, print 20 copies at once (or whatever the maximum capacity is for 
the collater).

Indeed, I am currently investigating Ghostscript. I have used it
occasionally in the past to view .ps files when I needed to be sure the
file was correct. But I know it has a lot more capabilities, so this
morning's work is to try to figure out how to do what you suggest.

Presumably the following would convert the PDF to PS:

gs filename.pdf filename.ps

But it's not working. Instead of writing the .ps file it displays the
PDF on screen.

Also, I'd like to specify the output device, which in CUPS is known as
Laserjet_8000_Series2. I also set this as the default printer in CUPS,
but I can't get the syntax right to make Ghostscript use the device:

gs -h

Returns a long list of printer devices:

Input formats: PostScript PostScriptLevel1 PostScriptLevel2
PostScriptLevel3 PDF Default output device: x11alpha
Available devices:
   alc1900 alc2000 alc4000 alc4100 alc8500 alc8600 alc9100 ap3250
appledmp (full page of similar device names deleted for brevity).

Apparently it can only use the devices in the list, not devices the
user has installed in CUPS. I read through the list trying to figure
out which would be most compatible with my printer (which has PCL5 and
Clonescript 2), but the closest I can come is a device name listed as
"pcl3," although there is another named "laserjet."

The man page hasn't answered many questions, so now I'm off to google.

I'm not sure even "gobs of RAM" can hold all 152 pages, assuming that CUPS
even knows how to handle the extra RAM in your printer.

You will probably have to hand-collate, I'm sorry to say.

You may be able to use evince, acroread or pdftk + pdf2ps/pdftops (they all
produce different output) to batch up, say, 10 or 30 pages of postscript at
a time and then hand-collate from there.

As for making a smaller PDF for online reading or presentations, ps2pdf
lets you choose the image resolution, if I remember correctly.

Good luck!

Subject: [PLUG] Frankenstein Thinkpads?
Message-ID: <20091016190403.GB5906@gate.kl-ic.com>

I have been happy with my standard screen Thinkpad T30, and use it
for thousands of hours a year.  But it is getting worn out, and
repair parts are vanishing.  Most particularly hard drives - it
uses PATA drives, and those are getting rare.   

But I may have waited too long to replace it.  I want a 4x3 screen,
and they don't make laptops with those anymore, just W.GA displays. 
Wrong direction.  I write 8.5x11 text documents.  I would love a 3x5
tall screen, deploy and rotate, full page, but nobody ever made those
for laptops.  Okay, you love widescreens, and you think I am an
idiot, and I think you are an idiot, but let's move past that. 

There is a hack.  See:
http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Installing_a_QXGA_display_in_a_R/T60_or_61

Extreme laptop modders are adding QXGA ( 2048x1536 ) displays to
late R series or T series Thinkpads.   I can buy a 15 inch T61
(perhaps used, with a busted screen), buy one of the QXGA screens
for about $200, modify the EDID codes on the panel, and I will have
the laptop of my dreams.  Although the pixels are too small for my
normal xterms ( 2 wide, 80 characters each, 5x7 fonts ) they will
be great with double-sized 10x14 fonts, and I imagine I can easily
scale images to drive my 1024x768 projector.

I will be taking this on as a project in December or January,
hopefully, collecting parts beforehand.  Is anyone else interested?

Keith

P.S.  I suppose an alternative is to start designing all my documents
in two-column landscape format.  Then W.GA displays might be usable. 
But people already think I'm weird, that would get me institutionalized. 
Code display would still suck, unless there is a multiple-column xterm
client out there.

Thanks to everyone for the suggestions. I still haven't hit on a
solution.

I have Windows 2000 installed in Virtualbox, so I opened the original
file in Adobe Reader 9.1 there. In Win 2000 I have the PCL and PS
drivers installed, so I tried printing the file to both. The PS driver
just printed an "offending command" error. The PCL driver printed the
first dozen pages OK, then started printing half pages, pieces of
pages, error codes, and just a general mess.

The creator of the document has been away, but I was able to
communicate with her this morning. I am going to have her re-export
from InDesign with some specific settings, like lowering the resolution
for graphics, choosing "print" instead of "press," and setting it PDF
1.3 instead of whatever it is. Hopefully that will get me a usable file.

I tried ps2pdf using the > to redirect the output to file (thanks
Bill!). It produced the file, but it was of 0 bytes. This is the PS
print file that won't print via lpr either. I created the PS print file
by printing the original PDF to file from Okular. And Okular is the
only program that can actually print the original PDF, albeit glacially.

At this point I must conclude that there is something messed up in the
original PDF file and I should wait until the creator of the file sends
me a new one.

Can you print to PDF using the cups-PDF package?  That might help clean
up the file a bit.

I didn't say you're an idiot, but it is true that I don't understand what is
wrong with widescreens.  What about a widescreen on a tablet?  Those allow
screen rotation.  What about a screen that is big enough to have side by
side 8.5x11 pages?

Solution..

Two part..

Hand edit  /etc/wvdial.conf
And run wvdialconf..  <as Root>

[Dialer Defaults]
Init = ATZ
Init1 = ATZ
Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0
Modem Type = Analog Modem
ISDN = 0
Phone = <phone # goes here>
New PPPD = yes
Modem = /dev/ttyS0
Username = <name here>
PPPD Path = /usr/sbin/pppd
Password =  "Love-linux or something"
Baud = 115200

Need to hand edit the three fields  name, phone, and password..

TIA

This probably came up last time this was discussed, but I ordered my 
15.4 Latitude with a 1920x1200 display. I can see TWO 8.5x11 documents 
on my screen side by side, crystal clear.

That was one of the first things I tried. The resulting PDF was just as
bad as the original.

However, while waiting for a response from the creator of the document
I discovered a solution. I had earlier discovered that I could not get
output with either the PCL or PS drivers from Adobe Reader 9.1 on
Windows. Reader / Windows happily sent the file to the printer, but the
output was full of errors.

So, instead of printing to the printer from Reader / Windows I printed
to file. Windows creates .prn files instead of .ps files - not sure
what the difference is. But I do know that sending the .prn file via
lpr works great. Still no "RIP once, print many," but it RIPs so fast
that it still gives me 85% of the rated speed of the printer. I do not
understand why the PS file that I created by printing to file from
Okular on Jaunty would not output at all. Clearly, there is a
difference between the PS created by Okular and the PRN created by
Reader / Windows.

Note that I should not have had to go through all this. I still think
the original PDF is somehow messed up.

Subject: [PLUG] Freedos and Linux tftp servers...
Message-ID: <1255738682.3765.21.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I have a Linux based tftp server and I've been creating 
bootable freedos disk images.  Unfortunately, I'm limited 
to a 2.88 meg image.  Is there any simple way to break 
that limit?  Some programs I'd like to run via network 
boot such as Battle Tech II demand an actual hard drive, 
groan.

Naturally, I want to be able to switch network bootable 
images so I can use different programs, test memory, get 
an LTSP Linux terminal, etcetera.  My experiments with 
Microsoft Client have been less than fruitful on my 
D845PEBT2 based computer system with built in Intel nic.  
There is a packet driver for the board that works in native 
dos, but not an NDIS driver.  Actually, E100BPKT.COM doesn't 
seem to work in a diskless environment causing motherboard 
reset the minute I try to use a network app.

My thought is that freedos is a simple system that can be 
outfitted with drivers to support reading ext3 file systems. 
So in theory, one can network boot and back up via network 
their Linux system.  Sadly, the freedos project is stalled
and there seems to be no effort to produce open source high
quality network card drivers.

In some ways I wonder if a network booted console only Linux 
system would be more useful.  I would like to know what to 
replace the init scripts with as leaving them the same when 
you are network booting doesn't make sense.  The typical 
scripts assume that there is a hard disk.

Does anyone know of a really fancy way to pick from multiple
network boot images at network boot time?

Bootable CD ROM images?

That's what I use for installation with PXE booting.

Well it needs to at least think that it has a hard drive. Have you
tried dosbox, or DosEmu, or something like a KVM virtual machine.

Have you tried the eitherboot project.  They have demonstrated booting
almost every Microsoft OS via the network.  I've even witnessed a
netbook being booted via WPA encrypted wifi.  It may be able to make
the system think it is acessing a local hard drive, but it is actually
a network block device.

Dos never had a standard TCP/IP stack.  You had to use 3rd party
software to get TCP/IP before windows 95.

Fortunately the unix model is to have mount points, so what specific
filesystem, or block device doesn't matter once it is mounted.  The
tricky part as I remember it is getting it to mount the root
filesystem.  /etc/fstab will need to have the network filesystem, or
block device in it, and you might need to have pivot root someplace in
the init to switch to the network filesytem once it is mounted.

I believe it is part of the PXE standard to be able to select what
image to boot.  The config is a bit trickier.

lets talk about how a box boots.  hardware stuff happens, then a hard
wried address is stuffed into the CPUs instruction pointer, and it
starts running code from a rom.  the rom code eventually tries to find
a boot device.

historically, that was a floppy.  so there was code in the rom to load
the 0th sector from the floppy into memory and jump to it.  that code
would then load more stuff from the floppy, and eventually an OS would
get loaded that knew what a file system was and how to read files from
the floppy.  or in the case of memtest, it would just start testing
memory.

Hard disks are similar.  boot from boot sector, load stuff that has
full file system support, load files (like mouse drivers, windowing
systems and email clients.)

Network booting is similar: only instead of reading from a disk, it
brings up networking (static or dhcp) and has a smal (trivial) ftp
client that can grab something like what would typically be in a boot
sector.

The key to remember is: what gets booted first doesn't really know all
there is to know about reading/writing files.  grub seems to know how
to read files, but I would be very surprised if it can write files.

interesting thing about bootable CD's:  The bios is hooked to load a
floppy image into ram (much like a floppy sized ram disk) and then
boot that using the old "boot from floppy" code.

which brings us to memdisk:
http://www.etherboot.org/wiki/bootingmemdisk
and
http://syslinux.zytor.com/wiki/index.php/MEMDISK
"MEMDISK simulates a disk by claiming a chunk of high memory for the
disk and a (very small - 2K typical) chunk of low (DOS) memory for the
driver itself, then hooking the INT 13h (disk driver) and INT 15h
(memory query) BIOS interrupts. "

Which is about the same as what the CD does, only instead of coming
from a real floppy or an image on a CD, it comes from somewhere else,
like a tftp server or I think a file system (disk or network.. doesn't
really matter)

Up till now I have written about stuff I have experience with and can
say it works.  this next part I have only read about, and would love
to hear that someone had one it:

"For any other size, the image is assumed to be a hard disk image, and
should typically have an MBR and a partition table. "

I have heard talk about "I have 700mb free ram, why not make a CD
sized ram disk?  No clue where that idea went.

yes, I do this.

you have 2 choices:
1. boot: prompt where you enter the lable you want to boot (like type
words = yuck.)
2. menu of boot options - arrow to your choice and hit enter.

I took notes and posted them on a wiki, but they have degraded as
others added and subtracted till the point of the page changed and was
renamed.  I tried to add back in what was missing, but haven't really
done it well.

   Before doing a new installation of xubuntu-9.04 on the Toshiba Tecra 8000
I want to back up directories that need to be restored. In addition to
/home, I'm thinking that /etc ought to be backed up, too. Any others?

   Also, is there a directory or configuration file to which I can add the
orinoco and orinoco_cs modules so they're automatically loaded when the
system boots? This was apparently lost in the not-quite-perfect upgrade from
8.10 to 9.04.

   See you at the clinic tomorrow.

One final issue in my printing saga.

I need to reprint just a few pages of the middle of the 151-page
document. The following lpr option does not work:

-o page-ranges=119-151

It just starts printing from page 1.

Any suggestions?

This happened to me once before... I think it was the bad credentials
from my old .Xauthority file from the original computer. Try removing
that on the new one, then log out and back in.

   I'd greatly appreciate insights from you professional network admins since
I'm out of ideas.

   One host on the network, the Toshiba laptop, communicates via a wireless
connection to both the LAN and, via the router/bridge the Internet. From the
laptop I can ping other LAN hosts as well as external sites. However, from
the main server/workstation I cannot ping (or otherwise access) the laptop.

   When I try I'm told that the destination is unreachable. Usually I see
this when the network is down, but it's up and running just fine. I suspect
the issue is with the wireless access point, which is another node on the
LAN. I cannot ping that host, either; there's no message, just dropped
packets.

   Any and all thoughts on why communications _from_ the laptop work while
attempts _to_ the laptop fail are appreciated.

is the wireless acting as a bridge or a router?  is the laptop on a

(1) Can you attach the laptop in question to the LAN via an Eithernet 
cable (disabling wireless)?
(1.a) If so, can you ping it then?
(2) Are there any other host attached to the LAN via the wireless point 
in question?
(2.a) If so, can you ping any of them?
Hope this helps
Regards

I have seen security options in wireless router config pages along the lines
of "wireless isolation" - something about preventing wireless clients from
talking to other hosts on the network.

Joe,

   I don't know. I tried accessing the unit via the web browser but could not
connect; I cannot ping it, either. Not sure what I did since the last time I
futzed with it.

> is the laptop on a different subnet than the rest of your network?

   No. It's IP address is 192.168.55.5, while the LinkSys WRT54GC is
192.168.55.200. I also cannot access the LinkSys via the default IP address,
192.168.1.1.

Thanks,

Rich

Fred,

   The last time I had it connected via ethernet I did not try pinging it
from another host.

   Nope. That's the only host because she works from the den at the rear of
the house and I don't want to run a cat5 cable across the floor.

wes,

   In this case, how could the wireless-connected laptop get mail from the
server here? And, I can ping the other hosts from the laptop.

is this linksys the main router for everything?  or is there another 
device that is your internet router?

Joe,

   It is the connection between the one laptop and everything else, both
local and remote. There's a Netgear firewall appliance/router to which that
wireless router is connected.

my guess is that it is doing routing, and it sounds like it is using the 
same ip range, which is really confusing.  the best way to check is to 
find out which port on the wireless linksys device is hooked to the 
netgear device.  for this kind of setup, you'd want to use a lan port 
(internal network) and set an ip on the linksys to match your regular net 
and then disable dhcp on it as well.  you may have to isolate the linksys 
and plug directly into it to accomplish that.

   The LinkSys uses the 'Net port to connect to the ethernet router. That's
how it's been set up and I don't recall problems like this before. Of
course, I may not have really looked, either. I'll move the cable to a LAN
port on the LinkSys and see if that works.

   As I wrote earlier, the LinkSys is 192.168.55.200 on the LAN; dhcp is off
since the laptop has a static IP address.

   I may have to do this via my notebook this evening, just to see what's
happening.

it isn't confusing if the device is bridging between the wireless and the 
wired side.  but when you use the wan port, it does nat routing (unless 
that device has the ability to be setup in wap mode, or bridge mode or 
something like that).  since you are seeing one way pingability, that 
sounds like the laptop is behind a nat box (just like your internet 
router).  by using the lan ports on the linksys you'll get bridged 
behaviour because those are both "inside" the nat.  with dhcp disabled on 
the linksys, your laptop dhcp will be bridged to the netgear and get that

it isn't confusing if the device is bridging between the wireless and the 
wired side.  but when you use the wan port, it does nat routing (unless 
that device has the ability to be setup in wap mode, or bridge mode or 
something like that).  since you are seeing one way pingability, that 
sounds like the laptop is behind a nat box (just like your internet 
router).  by using the lan ports on the linksys you'll get bridged 
behaviour because those are both "inside" the nat.  with dhcp disabled on 
the linksys, your laptop dhcp will be bridged to the netgear and get that 
info for routing, dns, etc and the gateway functionality on the linksys 
won't be used.

Rich,
Run /sbin/route on the laptop and the desktop here when you get a chance and
post them on the list.

Drew,

   From the laptop (192.168.55.5):

Kernel IP routing table

   Wow! I never set routing on that box; wonder where it got the defaults.
Regardless, local and remote connections from the laptop work fine.

Thanks,

Rich

why do you think the laptop is 192.168.55.5 when it seems to think it is 
on 192.168.12.something?  that seems to confirm my theory that you have 
two networks running with nat going on.  make the changes i suggested 
earlier and i think you'll be set.  just make sure you get dhcp disabled 
on the linksys before you hook into the lan side or you'll have battling 
dhcp.

   Because the former is what's in /etc/hosts on the server.

   I'll look at the wireless router this evening using a direct connection to
my notebook.

I'm going to hazard a guess that Joe is spot on here. There are 2 subnets
involved between the Linksys and Netgear devices and without some static
routes between the 2 they won't be able to communicate. I have to do some
similar bastardization between the Qwest CPE and Linksys AP I have at home.

Russell,

   The '-n' option makes no difference in the results of 'route.' Numeric in
both cases on both hosts.

That is indicative of a problem. It means you cannot do name
resolution.

Carlos,

   The version of 'route' on Slackware-12.2 here seems to use the '-n' option
the opposite way (as did earlier versions of the tool). According to the man
page,

        -n     show numerical addresses instead of trying to determine
               symbolic host  names. This  is useful if you are trying to
               determine why the route to your nameserver has vanished.

"localnet" "loopback" and "router1.appl-ec" are *not* numeric.  The
'-n' option will return numeric versions for those.  That's what I'd
like to see.

This looks like a boogered route but I could be wrong. I've seen people use
some funky weird gateways.

0.0.0.0         192.168.55.4    0.0.0.0         UG    1      0        0 eth0

Drew,

   As far as my limited memory recalls, the name 'default' has always been
associated with 0.0.0.0. It's the same on all machines here.

   I'll need to wait for time to look at the WAP with my notebook; right now
I've too much to do of higher priority. I suspect that I changed the LinkSys
from a static IP address for the laptop to dhcp with a fixed address to
assign. If that's what I did then I can see how it screwed up what used to
work.

   It'll be a couple of days or so before I get back to this thread; business
takes precedence. Stay tuned ...

Thanks,

Rich

Rich,
The name isn't the issue and 0.0.0.0 is just a default routing statement
basically telling any packets not destined for a more specific route to head
to 192.168.55.4 as the gateway which then will further route it to where it
needs to go.

I have offered to take this up and have a venue to beta test and a
presentation I can give on setting up Xen under NetBSD 5.0.1. I have at
least two other speakers lined up but neither were available on short
notice. This Wednesday conflicts with POSSE.

What are people's thoughts about a NetBSD Xen walk through on Thursday
from 7PM - 9PM at Club 915 at 915 SW 2nd?

Let me know ASAP and I will make it happen.

Michael

FWIW, my vote is to move it from Wednesdays, since that conflicts with
PTP weekly meetings.  The previous venue, Roots Organic Brewing, is
not bad either.  Has beer + food, room is free.

Subject: [PLUG] Where logwatch gets sshd data
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0910200747220.11674@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Yesterday a compromised host at a Canadian university was used in an
attempt to crack into our network. The information was in the sshd section
of logwatch's report.

   I would like to send the admin there timestamped records from the raw log
file that show the attempts, but cannot locate the appropriate file in
/var/log/.

   In /var/log/syslog.? there are references to sshd, but they all refer to
an inability to get shadow information for NOUSER. I cannot get results when
I grep for the domain name.

   Where might logwatch be getting this detailed information? I cannot find
that in /etc/logwatch/logwatch.conf or the files in /usr/share/logwatch/,
and it's not in /var/log/syslog.1.

   As is all too common an event, I found the answer just after posting the
message here. The answer is /var/log/messages.1.

Next Wednesday or Thursday are also options.

Should we aim for this month or next month with an High Availability or
Clustering topic?

hello all,

i want to Perform an SNMP set request in SNMP agent. return 0 if the
connect succeeded.

here is what i did :

LIST = 'ypcat hosts|| sort | awk '{print $2}''
for Devices in $LIST
do
Errorcount=`snmpget -v1 -c privator $Devices snmpInBadCommunityNames.O
|awk '{print $4}' `
if [ Errorcount > 0 ]; then
Devices=$Errorcount
echo $Devices
# line added
echo "$sysdate $Devices" >> /tmp/hosthistory.txt

fi
done

well, rather than using awk, i'd suggest using the -Oqv option to snmpget. 
that will make it only spit out the value.

but i'm not sure what you are trying to do.  that snmpget will return the 
total number of bad requests the device has seen since reboot.  is that 
what you want to do?

Thanks Joe
The answer to your question is No. 
1. I want to Perform an SNMP request in SNMP agent. return 0 if the
connect succeeded.
2. I want to be able to see how many times people from outside tried to
get into the devices also

I know my script is wrong , but her is what I come up with so far:

LIST = 'ypcat hosts|| sort | awk '{print $2}''
 for Devices in $LIST
 do
 Errorcount=`snmpget -v1 -c privator $Devices snmpInBadCommunityNames.O
|awk '{print $4}' `
 
  if [ Errorcount >= 0 ]; then
    echo "Devices=0"
    echo "$sysdate $Devices" >> /tmp/hosthistory.txt

  fi
 done

I feel like I forced the devices to be zero.
My next question is how would I know if the device been hacked or tried
to be hacked ?

Thank you

to see if your snmpget worked, you need to check $? immediately after the 
snmpget.  it will be 0 if snmpget was happy, not 0 if it had a problem.

checking snmp for bad community requests is not a very useful way to check 
for hacking.  snmp should either be restricted to known management ip 
addresses, or use snmp v3 with encryption and authentication.

I thought the range was base, good, bad, ugly.

As for which one to install, it depends on what you want Totem to play.

You could try them all, starting with Base, until Totem finally plays
what you want.

Also search the Ubuntu forums on "gstreamer." There's bound to be a lot
of discussion there.

There is too much discussion and not enough real help..
I had this problem about a year ago and someone told we to install the
windows plugins or something..  It is .wmv files I can't play..

If anyone knows how to get the plugins necessary for totem to play
anything including DVDs for any Redhat style environment, I'd love
to hear it.  I use vlc instead of totem, but it's a pain to have to
manually redirect all the time.

in my experience, compared to Totem, VLC's playback functionality (e.g., 
DVD menus for one), performance (really smooth), and less need to tweak 
color settings (both on my high-end nVidia-based laptop and my low-end, 
low-performing Intel945 graphics Dell) makes it worth the fuss.

Subject: [PLUG] xorg, evdev, hal and PS2
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0910221038250.6699@localhost.localdomain>

I have 5 computers that I administer (4 at home, one at work) that all
run gentoo. With the recent upgrade to xorg 1.6, I switched all of
them to a HAL keyboard and mouse setup, employing evdev as the driver
for these devices.

4 of the 5 computers work great with this setup. 1 does not. The
keyboard and mouse are completely unresponsive while in X. This
computer has one key difference from the others: its keyboard and
mouse are connected via PS2, while the others are USB. Could this be
the missing link? I guess I could try a USB keyboard and mouse myself,
I just haven't yet. The machine is my server, and I don't like to mess
with it much.

Is there a way to get evdev working with PS2 input devices? The whole
evdev thing is a good idea (avoiding duplication of effort between the
kernel and X), and I would like to make use of it. Since the keyboard
and mouse work in a VGA console, it seems that the kernel is perfectly
capable of reading them. I just wish I wouldn't be forced into buying
a new keyboard and mouse when the ones I have are perfecly
serviceable.

If you're using Gnome you can right-click on the video file and choose
Properties.  Select the Open With tab and select VLC as the default
application.  I'm not sure how to adjust DVD handling.

The gstreamer project describes these plugin sets as:

gst-plugins-base: contains a basic set of well-supported plug-ins

gst-plugins-ugly: contains a set of well-supported plug-ins, but might 
pose problems for distributors

gst-plugins-bad: contains a set of less supported plug-ins that haven't 
passed the rigorous quality testing we expect

I always install all of them on my Ubuntu desktop systems - they are not 
mutually exclusive.

You mentioned wanting to play Windows Media Files (.wmv) - if it doesn't 
work after you've installed all of the above plugins, I've been using a 
package named w32codecs which usually does the trick. It's definitely 
not open source, though.

Perhaps this page will help you in looking for where to find that .deb file:

No meeting tonight but I will line up something more solid for November.
 With POSSE running later, I think we should avoid it by a day unless
that further complicates it for people.

I am told that the meeting used to come after POSSE. Any thoughts on the
advantages or disadvantages of this arrangement?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <4AE12C93.5070202@wescottdesign.com>

Just got done trying out Xubuntu 9.04 for the second time (so no, it's 
not a bad CD...).

On machine A, I run it, it comes up really screwy in regular mode, and 
fine in 'safe graphics' mode -- except that after about 30 seconds the 
machine powers down with nary a 'blip' of warning.

On machine B I get the startup menu just fine, but when it goes to boot 
the screen just goes blank and stays that way, both in regular and safe 
graphics mode.

I'm clueless here -- any suggestions?  Is Xubuntu broken these days?  Am 
I just having really bad luck with compatibility?  What?

I tried to see if I could do a text-only start, but I don't know the 
magic finger-ring combination -- if someone knows, I'll try that on 
machine B to see if it's just a really bad graphics compatibility issue.

If you're using the live CD, the boot options are on the initial screen
- the one which says "run Ubuntu without changing your computer" at the
top. The boot options for startup commands are hidden, and I can't
remember exactly where they are, but the instructions are on that
screen. There are also several other options in the menu. 

If you have already installed it, the option you are looking for is in
the Grub boot menu. Under the regular (default) boot entry there will
be one labeled "recovery mode." When the Grub screen comes up (right
after the BIOS stuff) you can hit Esc and it will bring up the menu.
You have to be quick with the Esc.

Tim,

   There are definite changes in xubuntu-9.04 from previous versions, As you
read here, I upgraded a laptop to that version. It boots, but takes 4-5
minutes. It's also very slow to shut down. I will make time this weekend to
reinstall it.

   The two new issues with this release that I quickly resolved were the loss
of powering off when the system ran 'shutdown -h now' and the pcmcia
wireless card modules not being installed on boot up.

   For power off on shutdown, I added to the kernel specification in
/boot/grub/menu.lst 'acpi=force pcmcia=noacpi'; for the wireless card
modules I added 'modprobe orinoco, and 'modprobe orinoco_cs' to
/etc/rc.local.

   The only residual issue (which may go away with a re-installation) is a
weird screen display instead of the blanked screen after a period of
inactivity.

If you're going to reinstall, why not wait a few more days and get 9.10. 
It will be out before next weekend.

   Sure. Works for us. Perhaps that will fix the boot/shutdown speed issue
and the few other things that broke in the 9.04 upgrade.

Fix old bugs, add new bugs. :)

As usual, as soon as it is released I will download all varieties of
Karmic and put on my USB drive. My download speed is about 2.5 MB/s, so
it won't take me long. And I bet the torrents will have a bazillion
seeders for the first few days.

Anyone with slow download speeds who needs a copy is welcome to meet
with me any place reasonable.

What application?

Recently, I was using a WinTV PVR 350 to transfer video tapes to MPEG.
After trying everything I could think of, I fell back on
"cat /dev/video0 > capture.mpg"

I gotta get some cheap cameras and one of those $12 4-channel USB capture
boards from DealExtreme.  Linux has some great motion-detection and
computer vision libraries.

"video" is pretty vague.

web cam? ripping streaming video?  ripping dvd,

my guess is you want to look at dvgrab (command line) or kdenlive (gui
editor that can capture)

to record events I use

Ugh!  Sorry!  I mean capturing a region of the X screen over a time.
I'm using xvidcap; but it's a bit difficult to get just right.

I have head of that.  never really used anything, but I have done this:

ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1024x768 -r 29 -i :0.0 -target ntsc-dv -y foo.dv

You can also use vnc with one of these:
http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/vnc2swf/
http://www.sodan.org/~penny/vncrec/

I have tried to do the vnc thing, but didn't put much effort into it,
got bored, moved on.  I would like to get back to that someday, so let
me know if you get it to work.

That works VERY well!  Thanks.  Now I just need a way to (automatically)
determine what to fill in for the "-s" parameter... xwininfo works well
enough for manual records; but I'm not enthused about parsing that
output.  Surely there's an X windows query accessible to a bash script ...

I doubt I'll pursue that.  But if I do, I'll send you my results.

vnc might be the answer to capturing just a window. I kinda remember
something about 'share desktop' or 'share window'

I agree with m0gley here.  I had issues with 9.04 that seem to have been 
resolved in 9.10.  I thought they were related to my Intel chipset.  I 
have been playing with it since Alpha 4.  It seems faster, more stable, 
and the standby and hibernate options work now.  Might be worth the wait.

Subject: [PLUG] Reinstall, yet save everything
Message-ID: <20091023202948.d6349ff7.johnxj@comcast.net>

Generally the only time I do a new install is when I get a new
computer. Yet I like an up-to-date distro, so I always do a
dist-upgrade of my Ubuntu laptop whenever a new version comes out.

The reason I hate a reinstall is that I have god knows how many
programs installed, many of which required fiddling to get them
working. Did I document what I did to install them? Of course not. I
mean "It's working. Yay! Time for beer."

Then there's the issue of user configurations. Sure, config files for
applications are in ~/, but what about the configurations for the
desktop and for Ubuntu itself? And do those application config files
include all the plugins, add-ons and extensions? Will Firefox remember
the theme and plugins I have installed? Will Openoffice.org find my
Zotero library so I can add a reference to a term paper?

I figure a reinstall will take at least two full days, days mostly
filled with swearing in several languages.

I really don't want to do a reinstall, yet there is something messed up
in Xorg, Gnome, or bluetooth on my Jaunty laptop. I have tried and
tried to fix it, but there are just too many files, libraries, modules
and settings. Things are working, except I have currently lost the
bluetooth mouse again. I am giving serious consideration to a fresh
install when Karmic goes final. Plus, the timing is good - I have no
big projects underway at the moment.

Of course, I will do a full backup beforehand. In fact, I will do it
several times - to a hard disk, to DVDs, and again to the hard disk
using a different backup strategy.

Before I detrepidate myself and undertake this effort I could use
information about how to get a list (printout) of all installed
applications. I could also use a list of all configurations that I have
made to Ubuntu, including a list of all repositories I have enabled.
And I could use a list of a lot of other things needed to get me back
where I am, things that I haven't even thought of yet.

Suggestions and comments will be gratefully received.

If you installed them with aptitude, `dpkg -l | grep '^i'` or perhaps 
`dpkg --get-selections` possibly informed by the dpkg manpage and/or 
googling "debian list installed packages".  For backup, I think the 
sacred files holding this data are in /var/lib/dpkg/.

You can print this stuff on paper, but you could also feed it straight 
into aptitude to keep it busy for a while once you've installed the 
base packages.  If you're crossing a release boundary, some of the 
package names will have been changed to protect the innocent and new 
stuff will have 2s and 3s tacked on it.

Everything you've ever done as root to configure your system is in the 
git history of your /etc/ directory iff you uses git to track changes 
to your /etc/ directory.  Otherwise, it's going to be hard to tell the 
difference between what you changed and the defaults.

But even with a full history, upgrades often change the comments and 
make a very noisy diff.  There are also scripts that run when you 
install a package (and sometimes those ask you questions about stuff) 
so it's no simple matter to extract the difference between defaults and 
decisions.  You could diff your backup against the newly 
installed /etc/, but that's likely to be a really big diff to read 
through.  Replacing the files after install is not a good idea because 
the package configuration scripts would have made changes to deal with 
options in the new versions and lots of stuff would probably break.

Your repositories should be in /etc/apt/sources.list

It still might be simpler to fix that than to start over.  Then setup 
etckeeper or something so you have a record.

When I upgrade across releases, I use dist-upgrade, so everything 
in /etc is intact and most of the packages carry-over your old 
settings.

dpkg -l grep '^i' gave me pages of incomprehensible stuff. dpkg --get
selections was a little better, but still not simple enough.

I think I just need to get a piece of paper and write down what is in
Applications.

Aptitude will not be running. I will wipe the partition and do a fresh
install.

Sadly, I don't know what git is. Guess I never used it.

At least that part I understand. I can make a printout
of /etc/apt/sources.list.

I have spent hours trying to fix it. The problem is figuring out what
is installed by a default fresh install, and compare that to what I
have installed. But that only discloses what I am missing. What if the
problem is that I have something installed that I should not have
installed? And we are not talking about half a dozen packages. It's at
least hundreds.

So do I. But upgrading a broken installation is not likely to mend the
broken parts.

The easiest way I've found to check this sort of thing is to create a 
new user account on the machine, log into it, and see what works and 
doesn't work.

It's amazing what problems will disappear once you have a clean home 
directory. :-) It's also amazing what things don't work...

That doesn't fix all your problems, of course, but it'll give you a 
good idea of what is functional and/or dysfunctional with your current 
user-specific configurations and workarounds.

Perhaps $$ is really tight for you these days, but if it's not you can

a) buy an external enclosure for your current hard drive, and

b) buy a new hard drive to install your new OS.

Once you've got the new OS installed, then mount your old hard drive 
and copy what you need to your new /etc, /home, or whatever.

Plus, you can always chroot yourself into the old environment to do 
things like query your old apt database or see what library versions 
are used by your old binaries.

If the new hard drive is considerably larger than the old one, you can 
even dd the old drive to a file on your new one -- and mount/chroot it 
just as you would an external drive.

I've been burned by major rev upgrades, so I never even attempt them
anymore.  I don't attempt to do a full restoration either, first because
it's too hard and second, not doing so allows me to purge apps and other
stuff that I never use anymore.  After all, the only way to find out if
these apps are useful is to download them and try them.  Sometimes I can
judge that they are useless and purge them, but usually I think "that might
be useful someday", and the promptly forget about them.  If I was a better
housekeeper, I would clean useless stuff off as I go,

I do a "tar -cjvf" of /home and /etc to compress and list all the files to a
big usb drive.  I double check to  make sure everything is there, reformat,
install and then add back files as I need them.  I copy the listing of the
tar file to the new hard drive so I can grep for stuff quickly without
having to mount the usb drive, When I think of an app I want I just "apt-get
install" and I'm done with it.

Good Luck.

I've had similar experiences the two or three times I've upgraded to a 
new version/distribution.

I wonder if virtualization can help. I'm starting to think about 
upgrading my hardware before I really need to (this time!) and I'd 
appreciate hearing the collected wisdom on the subject, and if what I 
perceive from past discussions is how it really can work.

What I imagine:

1. Buy a quiet box and put a motherboard and processor in it that fully 
support virtualization.
2. Install a distribution that does little but support the virtual 
installations that follow.
3. Install the distribution I want for day-to-day use, and transfer all 
the stuff I have on this machine to it.
4. Install other distributions to try out, especially another copy of 
the one installed in step 3 to try out distribution upgrades before 
applying them to the day-to-day distribution.

Does this sound like it will work?

Are there some gotchas the collected wisdom knows about?

I'm I correct in assuming that I can make each one of these 
installations look like a different machine on my home network and move 
files between them as desired?

Yes, you are correct about how this works. The only "gotcha" is that the
hardware will not look the same to the virtualized installations. The
virtualization software provides a "virtual processor" and "virtual  RAM"
and "virtual network interface" and every other piece of hardware you might
have. It has no concept of power management hardware.

So, you can test things out from a software compatibility perspective, but
not so much for hardware. This means you'll about double your overall
testing time.

This was a good suggestion. Actually, I already had another user set
up, with just a standard Ubuntu desktop and nothing extra. I had
created this user years ago so I would have a way to log in just in
case something happened to my normal account.

I logged in to my alter ego and then went to set up the bluetooth
mouse. Amazingly, it connected and worked fine. Therefore, I must
conclude that my problems are with something in my normal account. 

The strange thing is that after logging out and back in as my real
self, the bluetooth mouse continues to work. Of course it would - the
bluetooth stuff is not a user thing. But previously as my real self it
was not working and I could not get it to connect. It was always
paired, and an hcitool cc command worked without error, but it just
failed to work.

I like this idea. One can always use a bigger hard drive.

I may do this, but first I have to shop for a hard drive compatible
with a Lenovo T61 - not just any 2.5 inch SATA drive will do; Lenovo
put some stuff in the BIOS that creates errors if non-Lenovo drives are
used. Yet there are some non-Lenovo drives that do work. I'll ask
around on the Thinkpad e-list.

I have a week before Karmic goes final, so there is time to think about
things and do some shopping.

I'm also considering going to straight Debian instead of Karmic. Other
than an occasional live CD I have never used any distro other than
Ubuntu 64-bit. Maybe it's time to expand my horizons. It would be
interesting to work with it for, say, a full week, installing all my
apps and configuring everything the way I want it. As long as I have no
pressing projects, this is as good a time as any.

Does the power management hardware do its thing underneath, or does it 
need to interact with the OS? I.e., if I get a motherboard and processor 
that are good at minimizing power usage, but then run my day-to-day 
stuff on a virtual machine, do I still get the benefit of the power 
management? If not, is that a good reason to consider not going the 
virtual route for day-to-day operation?

I.e., I'll have to re-test for different installations? That shouldn't 
be too bad if I don't make changes very often -- which I don't.

One reason to go route of different installations is that I can keep an 
older copy of something working when the upgrade looses the ability to 
talk to an older piece of hardware. I have an Epson Perfection 600 
flatbed scanner that worked fine when I was running SuSE 10.something. 
But, when I installed Ubuntu Hardy, it was no longer recognized. I 
figure if I keep a virtual distro around to run the scanner, I won't 
have to worry too much about upgrading it. I wouldn't use it to talk to 
the Internet in any way.

The OS can tell the power management hardware to do things like go to sleep,
dim the screen, slow down the processor, etc. You wouldn't be able to test
that sort of thing from within a VM. But if that isn't important, great.

I mean once you get all the software working the way you want, you'll then
have to put it on real hardware, at which time you'll have to re-test with
that hardware.

This seems reasonable. It might be fun to get communication between the
device and the VM's OS going, but I'm sure with a little playing around, it
should work.

I endorse this approach :).  I've gone back to Debian after four years
of Ubuntu, and I am much happier running Debian testing than I was
with Ubuntu.

Keep in mind, though, that Debian comes in three distinct releases.
Stable is very, very, stable--and it's also way behind the Ubuntu tech
curve.  You will probably want the middle release ("testing", if I'm
remembering correctly).  The bleeding-edge version ("unstable", also
called "sid") ranges from very usable to extremely broken, all
depending on the point of the release cycle.

Unlike Ubuntu, I don't believe Debian has fixed-time releases, so
there seems to be a stronger focus on maintaining and improving
functionality (and avoiding regressions).  My experience with Ubuntu
has indicated that the frequent releases cause less emphasis on
maintaining basic functionality and more emphasis on keeping up with
the latest tech.  (You can do that with debian too, just install sid
or run a mixed distro.  The difference is that no one is sugar-coating
sid to look like a stable OS.)

Dick,

   If you look at the sane-project.org Web site you'll see that the Epson
Perfection 600 is supported "good." It uses the umax back end:

Perfection 600 	SCSI 	  	Good 	OK, SCSI-ID=EPSON Perfection600
umax (1.0-41) 	sane-umax

   The 610 is completely supported.

   Regardless, if you have a current version of Xsane installed your scanner
should work regardless of distribution or version.

   There are other distributions that avoid being at the bleeding edge. It's
one of the reasons I like Slackware. Security upgrades come out when
necessary, individual applications can be upgraded easily, yet there are
still a lot of servers and workstations running older versions quite
securely and happily.

   I think it depends on what each of us does with the computer and the
distribution. I'm not in the computer business so for me it's a tool; a means
to a end rather than an end in itself. I'll upgrade the tool when there's a
solid reason to do so, otherwise I want to minimize administration time and
focus on what makes money for me. Those who need to know the idiosyncrasies
of various distributions on a professional level, or those who just enjoy
futzing with them for fun, have a different need.

Subject: [PLUG] trouble booting
Message-ID: <86ocnwjvbx.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I recently encountered an ancient P3/Celeron 1GHz-ish motherboard that
is having trouble booting.  I get the initial splash page with the
power-on self-test, then the screen blanks and I get a blinking cursor
in the upper left.  If I enter setup (with F2), it takes about 60
seconds of the blinking cursor before the setup screen appears.  If I
don't enter setup, after a long delay in some cases I get the initial
part of the GRUB boot up, but it seems to go more slowly and usually
hangs.

I have replaced the box's power supply with a brand-spanking new 400W
one, also replaced the hard disk.  That seemed to help for a week or
so, but symptoms are back now.  I've disconnected the CDROM and floppy
drives (they weren't being used anyway).

I have found one sequence that *seems* to work reliably.  If I enter
setup on the first boot attempt, then F10 to save and exit, after the
associated reboot, the GRUB menu comes up and it boots the OS just
fine.

At one point, the harddisk booting had disappeared from the Boot Order
options, and all I got was a PXE boot attempt.  It wasn't obvious why
that had disappeared, and it had booted successfully before I touched
it (was running when I arrived), and I had not touched that setting.
If it was the CMOS battery, I would expect more obvious clock problems
or warnings.

Any ideas?

This is very similar to a boot problem I had last year. I know the solution
was just to change a bios setting. I think it had to do with turning off
auto detection for drives that were not there, but my memory of what I did
has faded.

Message-ID: <847ED336-041D-46C1-B007-F98321BA25CE@ridenbaugh.com>

Next month, I'd like to bring my desktop box in to the Sunday clinic  
and set up a dual boot - it's currently XP, and I'd like to dual boot  
with the current Linux Mint. (Hard drive has more than 100 gb  
available, so there should be plenty of room.) My question: Apart  
from backup (which I do regularly anyway), and download of the OS,  
what else should I do in advance of bringing in the machine? Or bring  
with me?

One note: I don't have wireless installed in it, have been using DSL  
cable. Not sure if that would make any difference (I think I recall  
DSL cabling in the clinic room, at least last time I was there), but  
thought I'd mention it.

I've been researching new hard drives for my Thinkpad. I very much like
Paul's suggestion to get a new drive and put the old one in a USB case.
In fact, I even have a USB case I could use.

When I said I was considering giving straight Debian a week's trial I
suspected that I would get many suggestions of other distros. Well, I
am aware of the existence of all the other major distros, and Debian is
at the top of my list. 

Whatever distro I use next (and no guarantees that I will not end up
going back to Ubuntu), it must be Debian based. I have tried RPM based
distros and I can't get my head around package management. It would
take a great deal to get me to give up Synaptic.

Also, whatever I use must be pretty user friendly. I have no desire to
spend hours googling and searching e-lists for answers to problems. If
I want to play a DVD I want it to just work. And if the codecs are not
installed by default, then I want the application to announce that fact
and offer to install them without having to do hours of research to
figure out which ones I need.

Furthermore, I want a major distro with tons of users. Ubuntu has a
huge advantage in its forums. Responses to questions often come within
minutes. I'm willing to give that up, but I'm not willing to use a
distro where I have to wait all day for an answer.

I am a bit concerned about what Rogan said about Debian. I do want
something reasonably up to date on the tech curve, but the name
"testing" is a turn-off. But then, it is just going to be a one-week
experiment. 

I should add that in the several times that I have tried Fedora live
CDs I have been favorably impressed. But then I try to install
something and run into the darn RPM stuff.

And finally, one of my main motivations for trying a different distro
is Scribus. I spend a lot of time in Scribus. While it works OK in
Ubuntu, the Scribus developers are not shy when it comes to bitching
about Ubuntu. Scribus uses QT, and apparently the Ubuntu devs did
something to the QT that comes with Ubuntu. The result is a mess of
bugs that happen only to Ubuntu users. They openly recommend Debian,
Fedora, or OpenSuse.

All of the above are personal preference issues. Please feel free to
disagree with me as much and as loudly as you want. It won't change my
mind, but still, feel free. :)

The Clinic has both wired and wireless internet connections. No need to
install wireless, just plug one of the Free Geek cables into your
ethenet card and you should be fine.

As for what to bring, you can probably get away with bringing just the
box. We have monitors, keyboards and mice.

Supposedly we have distros available to burn to a CD. But there is not
much call for Mint and I'm not sure which version we have unless I get
up, walk across the room, get the drive and plug it in. Probably best
to just download the distro that you want, burn the image to a CD and
bring it with. If I recall correctly Mint does a live CD, so you can
test the CD yourself by booting to it. If it boots, you burned the live
CD correctly.

The next Clinic will be November 15. Looking forward to seeing you!

One thing I would recommend for you is to have your Windows installation
completed before you bring it in. Set its partition size to what you're
going to want it to be, and make sure it's the only partition on the drive
at the time, or at least the first one on the disk.

Next month, I'd like to bring my desktop box in to the Sunday clinic and set
up a dual boot - it's currently XP, and I'd like to dual boot with the
current Linux Mint. (Hard drive has more than 100 gb available, so there

of bringing in the machine? Or bring with me?

One note: I don't have wireless installed in it, have been using DSL cable.
Not sure if that would make any difference (I think I recall DSL cabling in

That is true, but if so, why won't Kooka, Scanner Utility, or XSane 
Image Scanner see it? I haven't played with them for a few months since 
the scanner on my multifunction printer works on my XP machine, and that 
was sufficient for most of what I do. However, the printer's scanner bed 
is not as long as the Epson, and I don't have the same tools to prescan 
and crop before scanning that are provided by XSane.

Message-ID: <1256498491.29526.3.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

How can one restrict who can use firefox in safe mode?
Extensions like Procon::Latte are pointless if everyone
can switch to safe mode and uninstall it.  Has anyone
restricted firefox by creating a wrapper for it and 
hiding the actual firefox executable?  Is there any
way to fix firefox safe mode so that you can't access
sites that aren't local to the computer?  Firefox safe
mode isn't very safe, the developers of firefox should
seriously consider redesigning it.

Is a simple perl script I wrote as a wrapper.
I moved /usr/bin/firefox to /usr/bin/firefox-actual.
The only problem I see is that someone can do
firefox-actual --safe-mode.

You could always recompile Firefox to remove the ability to enter safe 
mode if you have an application that warrants it. I'm not sure if 
removing safe mode is a compile-time option, but if not you could patch 
the source to remove the check for the safe mode command line option.

Keep in mind, without safe mode, you can get yourself into situations 
where extensions could make your browser unusable. For example, some of 
the kiosk extensions do a pretty good job of preventing you from 
defeating them - the only way to get rid of them is to put FF into safe 
mode and remove the extension.

Debian kinda/sorta does that, but not quite with the degree of polish
that Ubuntu does.  But it is actually pretty easy to get what you need
simply by adding the unofficial-but-widely-used multimedia repository
to your sources list.  The website is:

http://debian-multimedia.org/

It has straightforward instructions.

With Debian, the major action is on the mailing lists, especially the
high-traffic debian-user list.  For more, see:

http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/

The testing branch of Debian is, generally, more stable -- and
sometimes, more up-to-date -- than the latest Ubuntu release.
(Remember that Ubuntu takes Debian's *unstable* branch, freezes it,
tweaks it, and releases it.)  New or updated packages enter Debian's
experimental or unstable branch, stay there for at least 10 days, then
migrate to the testing branch if and only if they aren't causing any
problems in unstable.  Sometimes it might be longer than 10 days,
depending upon the size or complexity of the package(s).  If a problem
arises, a package doesn't migrate to testing.  At any given time,
there are lots and lots of packages in testing and unstable that are
at the same version number; there are lots of others with newer
versions in unstable than in testing.

At some point in the process, the Debian powers-that-be decide to get
ready for a release, so they freeze the testing branch and begin
fixing release-critical bugs and any other bugs they can.  This
process can be aggravatingly slow.  During this time, very few
packages migrate from unstable to testing.  Eventually, testing is
transformed from "testing" to "stable" and released.  Whatever was
"stable" becomes "old-stable."  At the same time, a new testing branch
is created and named, and the whole process starts anew.  The most
volatile period of the testing branch is right after a new release,
because a slew of packages (all those packages that had been held back
during the freeze) suddenly land in the "new" testing from unstable,
and that almost always causes some problems for various users,
depending upon what packages they're using.  Other than that, the
testing branch is usually pretty reliable.  There might be minor
glitches from time to time with certain packages (or the interactions
between certain packages), but nothing worse than users of Ubuntu or
other Debian-based distros encounter.  IIRC, it has been more than
three or four years since a major bug got into the testing branch that
rendered it crippled for most users.

Of course, that might mean they are due for another one.  :-)

I want safe mode to be closed to the average person.  If one must enter
a password to get into safe mode, that will work.  Changing the source
code of firefox is an extreme option that will make it harder to upgrade
when new releases come out.  Is there any standard way to protect
against safe mode abuse?  Procon Latte is a popular plugin I suspect,
but what's the point of it if anyone behind it can pop into safe mode
and remove it?  I am surprised that the author of Procon Latte hasn't
addressed the safe mode abuse issue.  Ideally, the developers who are
going to release the next version of firefox should address the safe
mode abuse issue.

Safe mode exists for a good reason - to prevent Firefox from becoming 
totally borked by third-party extension code. So while in your 
particular situation it poses a security risk, I guarantee if it were 
disabled by default, a far greater percentage of the user base would be 
inconvenienced. It's a trade-off.

Procon Latte is likely a good solution for users who do not have the 
technical know-how or motivation to try running Firefox in safe mode. 
Content filters are best deployed at the network level, e.g. as a 
firewall service. Otherwise you're constantly playing a cat and mouse 
game with other applications the user could install or run to circumvent 
the content filtering - including by using things such as bootable CDs 
or USB drives.

I get the cat and mouse game problem.  Thing is, what filter is there
that I can implement without a proxy at the network level?  Some sites
don't work through a proxy.  It would be nice if my direct access option
could catch attempts to search for "adult" material etcetera and do
something about it.  To be a direct access option means no proxy though.
I suppose I need to use iptables somehow to reroute packets to a server
side filter program and then inject as appropriate as if nothing had
happened.  I want something transparent.  An option is to simply go and
get the PICS ratings for whatever web site one is trying to reach and
flash a warning if appropriate, but how do I do that transparently and
still provide direct access?

As far as safe mode being an authenticated mode of firefox, I think
that is way too liberal.  I don't suppose in Linux though that one
can restrict what programs can be run.  To do so one would need an
administrator program that registers all the acceptable programs
with perhaps a daemon in the background that gets queried every
time there is a request to execute a program.

I don't know if it's possible, but it sounds like you want FF to operate 
off line, ie. not go out to the network. One of your initial queries was 
regarding restricting FF to local to the computer. When I run my laptop 
without any network, I can still access the vmware managment console 
even though FF is in off line mode. It sounds like that would be another 
solution.

I don't know how you'd limit users to FF in off line mode though, as 
it's a check box under the file menu. You may face the same challenges 
with that as with safe mode.

Message-ID: <1256535062.2250.4.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I'm wondering if anyone has set up the 2.8.0 version so that they
can download files?  The default doesn't allow this.

I'm wondering if another filter tool would work better for implementing
basic filtering where the user is warned about potentially inappropriate
material but not stopped.

I tried to look at squidguard, but it's not clear if that has the exact
features that I'm interested in.

2.8.0 is ancient and unsupported. 2.10.1.1 is the current stable. DG is 
setup by default to be content secure in a K-12 environment, so it's 
pretty tight. To unblock downloads, open bannedextensionlist and comment 
the lines you want allowed. For 2.8, I think it is in 
/etc/dansguardian/lists.

DG doesn't warn. It blocks. You can set it up with a bypass password 
though. Not sure what the point would be for normal users.

Good morning All,
I want to keep track on all my devices using snmp.
Any intrusion on the devices.
Any ideas?
thanks

to see if your snmpget worked, you need to check $? immediately after
the 
snmpget.  it will be 0 if snmpget was happy, not 0 if it had a problem.

checking snmp for bad community requests is not a very useful way to
check 
for hacking.  snmp should either be restricted to known management ip 
addresses, or use snmp v3 with encryption and authentication.

Try running this variation of the script:

LIST = 'ypcat hosts|| sort | awk '{print $2}''
for Devices in $LIST ; do
  echo $Devices
done > output.txt

Post the contents of output.txt

I suspect the error is in using single quotes instead of backtics and
possibly using an OR (||) instead of a pipe.  If you are using bash, I
would recommend using $() instead of backtics.

Thank you Robert,

The code will output the list of my hosts file.
I want to be able to keep track on all my devices using snmp, check if there is an intrusion also,

That's what it should do.  I suspect it may not.  For example, here's
what I get when I run it from the command line:

$ LIST = 'ypcat hosts|| sort | awk '{print $2}''
-bash: LIST: command not found

That's what it should do.  I suspect it may not.  For example, here's
what I get when I run it from the command line:

$ LIST = 'ypcat hosts|| sort | awk '{print $2}''
-bash: LIST: command not found

Maybe the shell script isn't the issue.

Have you tried running the snmpget command manually?

Yes I have run it manually?
The results:
If the community name is incorrect I get:
Timeout: no response from Device###
If the community name is true I get:
Error count :value

That is what I want to implement

Thanks

Can you post the output from the script rather than your description
of the output?

That is, can you wrap your script in this and run it:

true && ( set -x
# insert your script here
) >& output.txt

and post the contents of output.txt.  Here's what I mean:

true && ( set -x
LIST = 'ypcat hosts|| sort | awk '{print $2}''
for Devices in $LIST
do
Errorcount=`snmpget -v1 -c privator $Devices snmpInBadCommunityNames.O
|awk '{print $4}' `
if [ Errorcount > 0 ]; then
Devices=$Errorcount
echo $Devices
# line added
echo "$sysdate $Devices" >> /tmp/hosthistory.txt
fi
done
) >& output.txt

When I run the above this is was I get for the contents of output.txt:

 $ cat output.txt
+ LIST = 'ypcat hosts|| sort | awk {print' '}'
+ /usr/bin/python /usr/lib/command-not-found -- LIST
+ return 127
-bash: LIST: command not found

I suggest you modify the two lines above to this one so you're not 
running into the interesting side effects of bash variable assignments 
and confusion of apostrophes & back-ticks.

    for Devices in $(ypcat hosts|| sort | awk '{print $2}') \

Though I'm a little confused by the or (||) in that statement.  I would 
have thought you wanted the results of ypcat to be piped to sort.

Thanks very much for the clarification about Debian versions. I read
all of the Debian pages, but couldn't get my head around the
differences. Your explanation makes it much clearer.

After considering it all, testing is what I want.

I note there is a net install. I don't completely trust my net
connection. It's fast, but sometimes Comcast throws me a curve. I'd
much rather download an ISO via torrent, even if it's several CDs or
DVDs. I'm in no rush. But I can't find the 64-bit ISO to download. For
some reason I find Debian's web pages very confusing to navigate. I
guess that's not a good omen, huh?

Never mind, I finally found the ISOs. I'm going to have to use direct
download because the torrents are broken - "not authorized to use this
tracker." The direct downloads are going pretty fast, though.

John,

You want cutting edge and stable. Stabler than Fedora? Try Arch Linux.

http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=arch

I think you'll like it.

Dave

I use the net install, because the packages that you install off of the
CD will probably need an update, which means that you will need to
download the current packages anyway.  So, why not just download the
current packages as part of the install process?  The net install can
still give you a functional computer without a network connection, you
just don't get the GUI.  Or most of your usual commands, but it is
functional.

If Comcast knows your MAC address (the hardware address of your network
card), you should be good to go.  If not, unplug your Comacast device
for 5 minutes, then plug it back in and then start your install.

Good luck,

Does this mean that Debian testing will not have an Update Manager that
will look for new packages? Will I be stuck with whatever is on the
CD/DVD unless I completely reinstall? 

Must I use a net install in order to get the latest version of testing?
If I download the DVDs of testing today, will they not include the
latest updates?

And what happens to the net install if the connection is interrupted
for 15-20 minutes while I call Comcast, reset the modem, etc.?

Message-ID: <36EA23E5496844BBA4DF74F5DDAB4A1C@mukta>

Is "fdisk" or "sfdisk" lying to me? Or both?

Below is the output of both "fdisk" and "sfdisk".  Nobody makes sense.

Both claim the different geometry (heads, sectors/track) and a differing
number of cylinders.
Yet both pretty much agree on the ending cylinder of sda1.
With the number of heads disagreeing, almost nothing should line up. 

fdisk
-----
fdisk claims cylinders are made up of 15120 blocks of 512 bytes yielding
7741440 bytes per cylinder.
Yet, doing a cylinder computation of sda1 gives:
Blocks/(blocks/cylinder) 51309688/15120 = 3393.49 
(Because some partitions start/stop on non-cylinder boundaries fractions are
expected here)
This value is half the expected value of 6786.
If a block is actually 1024 bytes (as sfdisk claims and bytes per cylinder
still 7741440) 
then the blocks per cylinder would be 7560 making the computation:
51309688/7560 = 6786.99
which is the about the expected value.

sfdisk
------                                   
sfdisk claims cylinders are made up of 8225280 bytes in blocks of 1024 bytes
(yielding 8032.5? blocks per cylinder).
This looks line the number of bytes per cylinder is off by half a block.
Cylinder size in bytes and in blocks should be consistent with each other.

Anybody got an idea of what is going on here?
Am I doing the computations wrong?

As with everything 

YMMV..

What fdisk and sfdisk report is just something to make the user happy.
Data in not stored on modern disk in cyl/head/sector 

For example...Do you really believe you have 255 heads on your drive?

So why does it say that...?  Survey says...in the bios field on the
drive you have room for an 8 bit number... 

C * H * S  should give you disk size...

At some point in time we started using LBA  <Logical Block Addressing>
Which means..We tell the user we are storing data one place and actually
store it some other place...

And it goes on and on...  There are probably  A LOT of people who can
explain this better then I....   I will leave that up to them..

What is the problem you are trying to solve?
Or are you just curious about the disk size?
Or it is a SLOW NIGHT?

And of course there is the difference between base10 and base2 and base8
and base16 numbers..

HTH

Subject: [PLUG] Laptop as Server?
Message-ID: <4AE69174.3040703@wescottdesign.com>

My #1 son and I are in mild disagreement.  I've got an old Dell laptop 
(Latitude 26something) that I've put Xubuntu on and am re-purposing as 
a  version control server (later internal web server for testing and 
probably Dirvish for, well, survival).

(And yes, using a laptop as a server has a number of strikes against 
it.  But I don't care, because it cost us exactly $0 to put into 
service.  We can get our feet wet with this without spending any 
capital, and if and when it seems necessary we can shell out some real 
dough for a real machine.)

He's of the opinion that a laptop is gonna break if it's left on all the 
time.  I'm of the opinion that it's going to be pretty less heavily 
loaded than if someone were using it (how much can a working household 
with three part-time developers load a server?), and besides it's been 
left on for days on end before now, so get outta the way kid and let me 
work!

I've never tried this, so I have to admit that it's an either/or thing 
as far as I'm concerned.  I'm interested if anyone has any direct 
experience, good or bad, with this.

I had a friend that used a laptop as an Email server for quite a few 
years until it eventually broke down (it lasted about 3-4 years). He 
liked it because it didn't use as much electicity as a desktop so he 
could afford to leave it running. He used it not only for his own Email 
but as a mailing list that we and some other friends used to keep in 
touch. No clue if it's really relevant to your issue however.

If you think about it, you don't have to buy a UPS for a laptop which
saves you money.  Laptops tend to take up less space than desktops,
which is good.  Unforunately, laptops tend to run hotter than desktops
and if the laptop is used for more than 2 years the chances are good 
that the hard disk in it is going to die soon.  Another obvious problem
with using laptops as servers is that they probably only support 1 hard
drive which roughly translated means no raid.  I believe there are
different classes of laptops meant for different purposes.  There are
obnoxiously large laptops that are clearly meant as Desktop replacements
and there are tiny Asus Eee PCs that run Linux which are single core
and sub 1 Ghz.  I like the Asus Eee PC because the Linux version at
least has a solid state replacement for the hard drive.  Laptops include
screens that you technically don't need on a server, so three laptops to
serve as three servers means redundant keyboard, screen, touchpad, DVD
drive.  Do you want a laptop for a server or would a mini ITX form
factor computer make more sense?

Laptops are so cheap right now starting at around $400 for a new one.
By the time you buy three 1000VA+ smart UPS'es, you have spent more 
than that.  The real question is, will a laptop be more reliable than 
a desktop system outfitted with a UPS?  the advantage of normal 
form factor computers is that it's easier to replace failing parts.
Laptops tend to have custom size custom made parts and they aren't
typically supported for very long.  Typically, you should replace 
fans as often as once a year.  Ideally, a server should be fanless
dissipating it's heat via special conversion devices or a special
liquid.  The liquid needs to be non ionized if the circuitry is to be
submerged in it, so tap water is out.  The biggest strike against
desktop computers is that the power supply is so cheap and the
most likely of all the parts to fail.  Laptop power supplies are not
necessarily much better.

I recommend writing a list of the advantages and disadvantages of using
a laptop as a server and then augment that list with a list of what you
can do to remedy the disadvantages.  It will be interesting to see what
costs more, using a laptop as a server or a desktop as a server.

It'll probably be just fine. I used an old Dell laptop as my router
for a few years before "upgrading" to a COTS wireless router. My only
concern with running a laptop 24/7 would be potential cooling issues.
If it's ever heavily loaded for a significant amount of time, a lot of
heat may be trapped in by the closed lid.

The broadband that is bundled with a crackberry have been very good, excluding Sundays in Italy[1].
If the tools to duplicate RIM's Windows/MAC offerings for desktop connectivity progress to full
useability a Blackberry with data service, ~$30 a month per line, from Verizon would be viable.

[1] For some reason bandwidth and connectivity would become very unreliable in Italy mid-morning 
on Sunday.  Late Sunday night service would be restored to the normal fine feed.

I use 2 laptops in exactly this way. One with BSD and one with Windows. They
have been on pretty much 24/7 for years now, and still running strong.

I haven't touched the hardware in the BSD laptop since I set it up, though I
do want to put a bigger hard drive in it. It had an uptime of over 700 days
before I moved and couldn't plug it back in before the built-in UPS ran out
:)

Add that to the current uptime of 349 days, and I think I do OK. The screen
was broken when I got it, so I removed it. I keep it stood up on its side to
keep heat from collecting on the bottom. Its location at my old house was in
a small closet that got pretty hot. Never had a problem.

I think the only concern with the hard drive is with the constant movement
normally involved in using a laptop. This won't be an issue after you start
using it as a server, but what it's been through in the past will become a
factor in the future. Has yours ever been dropped?

My Windows laptop is on all the time too. It was made in 2003, and was top
of the line at the time. I only turn it off when I need to put it in the
carrying case, and that is only because of heat.

In addition, my company had 4 very old Toshiba laptops in service when I
started here. We're down to 2. One lost a hard drive and one was obsoleted.

I agree that the biggest risk factor in a laptop is the hard drive. Keep
backups that work and replace it when it breaks. In a way, it's doing you a
favor to force you to keep backups, as you KNOW it's going to fail first in
all likelihood.

use fdisk -lu and sfdisk -l -uS and the start/end values should be the 
same.  the whole concept of cyl/head/sectors is bogus nowadays.

as most people have indicated, heat is the biggest concern.  keeping the 
lid closed will shut off the backlight, but will trap some heat that 
normally would radiate up through the keyboard.  the main thing i'd say is 
to make sure you blow out the fan/radiator ports before you start this 
project, and then i'd do some proactive cleaning every few months to see 
how good of a vacuum cleaner the laptop is.

You can do this, but:

1) Keep it cool.  Perhaps one of those fan platforms will work, or
you can place the whole thing on top of a large box with a big slow
fan in it.  This will help lifetime.

2) Use an external disk for dirvish/rsync, which really thrashes the
backup drive.  Strongly suggested.  An eSATA Cardbus card connected
to an external Vantec Nextar single-slot HDD dock ("drive toaster")
and a large 3.5inch SATA drive (3-5x what you are backing up) means
you still have the backup drive after the laptop dies.  Using a drive
toaster, you can even hot-swap and rotate drives, for air-gap security.

Note - the double slot Vantecs don't work, at least with my eSATA
hardware and recent production kernels.  

So you are out some expense and some extra power, but it will greatly
increase the survivability and robustness of your server/backup system,
and take a major source of heat and early failure (thrashing hard disk)
out of the laptop.  You may want to use one of the network speed
throttling options for dirvish/rsync when you back up the laptop 
itself, or its bethren. 

Three weeks ago, I used dd to copy my laptop main hard drive to another
drive in the ultrabay, as a backup measure before a trip.  Bad idea.  
It overheated the main drive - thousands of I/O errors after that.  
Fortunately, I had yet another older drive copy.  Color me paranoid.

If your Dell laptop is too old to support Cardbus, you might need to 
re-think the above, and figure out how to get some I/O speed out of the
laptop.  For really old laptops, this is the Achilles heel, they were
designed to talk to modems and USB mice, not networks and fast drives
and high data rates.

There's no clear cut answer.  The laptop will break, eventually.  And
there will no way to show whether it was because it was used as a
server or just because its time ran out.  I think you have a sound
strategy by trying it with the intention of moving to a "real" machine
only if necessary.  And that real machine may be an old desktop you
have lying around or a friend wants to toss.

As an anecdote, several years ago we had setup an ssh server for a
small non-profit using Ubuntu Server 6.06 on a lowly 365 MHz Celeron
with 64 MB of RAM and a 3 GB HDD.  We also decided that for easy
expandability and maintainability we would keep things simple: one
partition, swap in a swapfile, labels on filesystems.   By the time
that machine was retired almost 3 years later, it had become a time
server (ntpd), a cron server (crond), a dynamic DNS updater
(ddclient), a proxy server (squid), a web server (apache), a Samba
server, and a DHCP server (dhcpd).  In that entire time, the machine
only went down for kernel updates.  So you don't need much to run a
small local server.

Good luck and let us know how things go.

Regards,
- Robert

Until recently, I backed up my laptop "server" (an ancient Toshiba 
Tecra 8200) using iSCSI to a Openfiler host. That worked pretty well. 
I've had to end-of-life my Openfiler server for hardware-related 
reasons; otherwise, I'd still be using it.

I will be presenting my server-sky talk to the PTP meeting on
Wednesday, 630pm at Roots.  One of the things I would like to
try before the presentation is how well my 1024x768 projector
works with widescreen laptops - does it letterbox, or distort?

So I hope a few of you can bring widescreen laptops and we
can do some tests.  Linux/BSD/Win/Mac .

I would also like to try my wydiwys slide show, so hopefully
some of you have laptops with USB ports and web browsers with
Flash and Javascript and no keycode-munching browser plugins.

I recall that I tried using my Thinkpad T61 (Ubuntu) with your
projector at an Advanced Topics meeting at Jax. It was about a year
ago. I have the nVidia Quadro at 1680 x 1050, but all I could get to
display was 1024 x 768. That is, only a portion of my screen was
displayed.

I'm using an old Latitude as a print server.  It was for a time also
hosting a FAQ, posting it regularly to Usenet.  It being a laptop it has
a built-in UPS and power management that will do a sane shutdown.  The
only downside is that the backlight sometimes comes on when the lid is
closed, which has at least once helped to overheat the unit.  A $15.00
USB-powered notebook cooling pad solved that problem.  A little more fan
noise, but much less than a proper server, and much less power
consumption overall.

I would think that the opposition to using a laptop as a server comes
from the notion that a laptop really isn't meant to be used 24/7, where
a server is supposed to be designed and built for such demand.  But in
my personal experience, my laptop-as-a-server is "used" less than one
hour per day and is otherwise sitting idle, occasionally responding to
rsync for backup and to the update manager.  My other laptop is used
probably 6 or 7 hours every single day, hosting a variety of programs
and a virtual environment, and it is possible that it will fail sooner. 
That's my opinion, of course, and has no basis in fact.  YMMV

A projector is just another display, with it's own resolution settings. 
If you're slides are designed at 4:3, they will display at 4:3. However, 
if the display is widescreen physically, but set to run at a non-native 
4:3 resolution, then the slides (and anything else) will display 
stretched. If you run 4:3 slides (and anything else) on a widescreen 
display set to run at its native resolution, you will see black bars on 
the sides.

Good morning Robert,
I run the script and I got the list of all my devices in the hosts file.

true && ( set -x
LIST = 'ypcat hosts|| sort | awk '{print $2}''
for Devices in $LIST
do
Errorcount=`snmpget -v1 -c privator $Devices snmpInBadCommunityNames.O
|awk '{print $4}' `
if [ Errorcount >= 0 ]; then
Devices=$Errorcount
echo $Devices
# line added
echo "$sysdate $Devices" >> /tmp/hosthistory.txt
fi
done
) >& output.txt

Actually that will be nice if can somehow find a way to have and variable that hold the last value when I run it again I should compare it to the new value ..if the new value is greater than the old value==> display the $errorcount..if the new value is equal to the old value ==> no display( basically I only wnt to display when the value changed).
Thanks again robert,

T

Can you post the output from the script rather than your description
of the output?

That is, can you wrap your script in this and run it:

true && ( set -x
# insert your script here
) >& output.txt

and post the contents of output.txt.  Here's what I mean:

true && ( set -x
LIST = 'ypcat hosts|| sort | awk '{print $2}''
for Devices in $LIST
do
Errorcount=`snmpget -v1 -c privator $Devices snmpInBadCommunityNames.O
|awk '{print $4}' `
if [ Errorcount > 0 ]; then
Devices=$Errorcount
echo $Devices
# line added
echo "$sysdate $Devices" >> /tmp/hosthistory.txt
fi
done
) >& output.txt

When I run the above this is was I get for the contents of output.txt:

 $ cat output.txt
+ LIST = 'ypcat hosts|| sort | awk {print' '}'
+ /usr/bin/python /usr/lib/command-not-found -- LIST
+ return 127
-bash: LIST: command not found

Subject: [PLUG] 3d graphics question
Message-ID: <4AE73268.7090907@gmail.com>

To all Linux graphics aficionados:

I am trying to create some physics 3d graphics that illustrates moving 
waves and particles.  The snapshots can be accumulated into a movie.

I have been told to stay with OpenGL to make the graphics compatible 
with both Linux and MS Windows, as the graphics needs to run in
both environments (other people have that other system, sorry to say)

I have tried to use gnuplot, but it is far too simplistic and cumbersome 
to use.  I am currently examining Octave and QtOctave.

The following 3d graphics programs have come to my knowledge, but I 
would appreciate finding others which are suitable to my task.

1.  Panda3d - http://www.panda3d.org/index.php

2. Python Computer Graphics Kit - http://cgkit.sourceforge.net/index.html

3. OpenSceneGraph (OSG) - http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg

The graphics, when completed, will look similar to the following snapshots:

http://www.vtk.org/VTK/project/imagegallery.php
   see Data in the vicinity of fluid flow (LOx) around a tube graphic

http://www.taumuon.co.uk/jabuka/
   see Sequential Impulses stack movie

The Open Dynamics Engine http://ode.org/ is another resource which shows 
the 3d rendering of objects obeying physics laws.

The goal is to give insight on Maxwell's equations in 3d involving 
electromagnetic fields and also electrostatics and magnetics.

Questions:

1. Are the above graphics programs suitable?
2. Has anyone worked with 3d physics modeling and can advise on the 
pitfalls and development time?
3. Are there any other cross platform 3d rendering engines suited for 
modeling math equations related to physics?

Gnuplot gives accurate graphs for the equations, but I need the 3d 
capability and a "good" rendering engine so that users can quickly 
visually grasp the insights.  QtOctave doesn't seem fully MatLab 
compatible, as I tried running a couple of MatLab programs under Octave 
and it doesn't recognize the graphics framing structures.

I appreciate your advice.

If you have questions, please feel free to ask.

Randall,

   Look at PSTricks <http://www.tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi/> and the
pst-3dplot module.

I did look at this and imported the packages into the MikTeX on the 
Windows XP side only to discover that due to some type of header file 
problem, LeDitor is NOT able to generate the pdf from the TeX file 
directly, nor can any of the others.  I can use the dvi to ps converter 
and print from there.

I was looking for more of an interactive graphics enviroment where the 
user is able to change their perspective.

Thanks, that was a helpful tip

Could you use gmail or hotmail or some such to eliminate it since the
disclaimer makes no sense for a mail list?

A lot of places don't allow the use of other email sources. I don't find it hard to just ignore the disclaimer. Especially since it really means nothing since email travels across the net in cleartext. 

In other words, it's a lawyers attempt to protect something without understanding the technology.

I agree that those disclaimers don't make a lot of sense, but I more
strongly believe that complaining about them makes even less sense.

Ouch! You are right.  I am going to do my part, to keep the noise on this
channel to a minimum, by never bringing up or commenting on the subject of
email disclaimers again.   How silly of me.  Bye.

No, you will not be "stuck" with whatever you install, it is just a lot
faster for me to install packages once for each install instead of
twice.  I also comment out any references to CD's
in /etc/apt/sources.list, sticking to just online sources for packages.

No, you can use the full version to install the system that you want,
then use the online updates which will probably update most packages.
CD package versions always lag online version, it is the nature of the
beast.

Good luck,

I am running ubuntu 8-10

and I just ran 

root at desktop:/usr/sbin# tzconfig
WARNING: the tzconfig command is deprecated, please use:
 dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
root at desktop:/usr/sbin# dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

Current default timezone: 'America/Tijuana'
Local time is now:      Wed Oct 28 10:05:06 PST 2009.
Universal Time is now:  Wed Oct 28 18:05:06 UTC 2009.


And it is an hour off....

Should PSDaylight time..



root at desktop:/usr/sbin# apt-get install tzdata

Or is Tijuana the problem??

Dude, you need to UPDATE the tzdata package. And then you need to pick
the correct timezone. Are you in Oregon? Then try
America/Los_Angeles. President Bush's daylight savings change probably
did not affect Tijuana.

yep, that would do it.  i really dislike the city centric method for

Yeah, like complaining about top-posting or replies to discussions about 
the AT talk or subject lines that don't really mention the subject.  
But what about listing your beefs in an excel file and sending that as 
an attachment?  Surely the corporate mail server can be configured to 
add that to every outgoing mail.

Oh, possibly because it's the largest city in the UNITED STATES on the  
west coast. Most people from the west coast know that LA is in the  
same time zone. (Sarcasm... )

However, I do know of one person from Redondo Beach (loosely a suburb  
of LA) that didn't know Oregon was on the coast. He actually tried to  
tell me I had to drive through Idaho to get to the coast.

I know, it would probably be better to just use UTC +/- X, but that  
has issues too.

Forget for a second that it is ridiculous for an internet-connected 
computer to ask a human for the time of day... Why is choosing "a city 
from the same time zone as you" supposed to be easier than typing the 
name of your timezone?  Now you have to know the politics of not just 
your own city, but also of some arbitrary large city north or south of 
you.  Somebody in LA should get the city's government buildings to 
switch to EST on Tuesdays just to keep things interesting.

Actually, the city may not be to off the wall - there are still places 
within the USA that do not observe Daylight Saving Time ... www.time.gov 
is your friend for all sorts of information ... but that would be 
Hawaii, Arizona (in Arizona only the Navajo reservations observe DST) 
and part of Indiana, as well as many Pacific islands and Puerto Rico - 
Sigh, I wish I didn't have to.

I don't know for sure the mentality behind the initial decision. I can
imagine that it eliminates the need to maintain the names of the time zones
in different languages. It would be easier for people that understand
different languages to recognize the city that is nearest or most
north/south of their location than to recognize whatever we call their time
zone.

I had a similar problem with a blanket on my bed.  It was too short. 
So, I cut off a foot of material on the bottom and sewed it onto the top 
and now the blanket comes all the way to my chin.

Look at the Wikipedia article "Daylight Savings Time".  An influential
early proponent was British aristocrat William Willet, who disliked
cutting short his golf game at dusk.  The first implementations were
by the Germans and their allies during World War 1, to save coal.
The gains are dubious and the losses are documented.  Personally I
think it is a travesty, forced on us by arrogant authoritarians
who like to dominate others.  A lot of countries have repealed it.

States can drop out, like Arizona and Hawaii did.  Oregon ought to.
Our arguments?  Dropping out helps farmers.  It reduces traffic
accidents.  It saves tweaking on the clocks and computers.  It
synchronizes us with our important Asian trading partners (China
and Japan and Korea have all abandoned DST).  And most importantly,
it insures Portland's appearance in the tzdata tables! 

We can call our time zone "Ecotopia Intelligent Time", or EIT,
which can include other patches of the west coast US and Canada
as they "come to the light".  Eventually, the only holdout may
be regions around the Microsoft campus.  That time zone would be
"Bill's Unfortunate Lackeys Losing Synchronization, Horological
Idiot Time".  Or more simply, "WIN-0" time.

The fool in Redondo Beach who thinks Oregon is in the Mountain
Time Zone would be right at least part of the time.

Personally, I like Cory Doctorow's suggestion in the fiction book
"Eastern Standard Tribe".  In a 24x7 world, you pick your own
time zone, based on when your friends (wherever they are in the
world) are awake.  I hang out with computer geeks a lot, so I'm
going for Hawaiian time, always GMT-10 (I woke up an hour ago).
Two hours of morning screen glare avoided.

And to make this more Linux relevant, perhaps we can write apps
that help keep track of our friend's time zones.  People will buy
Android phones so that they know when preferred calling hours are.

I'm looking at an MSI netbook:

It has an Athlon Neo processor. Anyone have any idea what CFLAGS I
should use to compile genoo on this CPU? Do I just use -march=k8?

   Perhaps someone here has insight to a behavior that showed up this week.
Platform is SeaMonkey on the Toshiba Tecra laptop running xubuntu-9.04.

   Whenever my wife tries to view a Web page a message box pops up telling
her that SSL is disabled. While I don't think that's a big deal when viewing
a page, it's annoying. However, when we go into Edit->Preferences->Security
we see that the two SSL options are enabled and all warnings are disabled.
With this configuration I cannot see why that warning box displays.

   Any ideas?

   This weekend I'll reinstall 9.04 and see if that cleans things up.

Mel,

   Looks like a reasonable suggestion, but I cannot imagine how those were
uninstalled during normal use. This message box started to show up on
Wednesday.

Subject: [PLUG] How many domain name servers?
Message-ID: <20091030174928.GA21148@gate.kl-ic.com>

How many domain name servers can a domain registration point at?
Is there a hard limit or a maximum practical limit?

Right now, I'm using dyndns for domain name service, which is
expensive.  I plan to move DNS to my server hosting company
Rimuhosting, (3 name servers) and add some place like everydns
(4 name servers), for 7 name servers in the domain registration
record.   The redundancy permits me to relocate more easily if
Rimuhosting gets eaten by a bad economy (they are thriving now)
and their nameservers abruptly vanish.  

Does that vaguely approximate a rational plan? 

Keith

P.S. I have two static IPs at Rimuhosting, which have not moved
for years.  Their gui for changing DNS records is difficult to
use.  I have TXT records for DKIM and such, and about 5 or 6
CNAMEs each for 15 URLs.

i'm not aware of any official limit.  there are practical limits for the 
size of a dns response that will fit in a udp packet.  big places (google, 
yahoo, ms) use 4-7 servers without problem.  there is a mini compression 
algorithm involved so extra ns records with the same base names don't use 
much space.

but why not just use the dns from your registrar?  usually that is 
included in the registration fees and has a web interface to drive it.

The benefit of dyndns is that you can quickly change IPs because of the 
low TTL.  If you're concerned about your hosting vanishing, are you 
concerned that the vanished IP is going to be cached in downstream DNS 
servers for several hours?  Is the redundancy any use at that point?

I've personally never been able to setup a registrar, or hosting
provider DNS in a way that made me happy.  Usually they only let you
set some of the many record types, and it is very tedious with web
forms.  Also they pretty much never let you set the cache refresh to a
low number for performance reasons, but when you are about to switch
IP addresses you want the cache refresh to be a really low number for
a little while just before the switch.

I am unmasked!  I confess, I am the "integer" Keith!  64 bit twos
complement.  Oh,  0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF !!!

My wife insists on turning on the lights as she prepares to go to
work.  THAT morning glare.  After she leaves, lights out, cave mode. 
You aren't referring to the supposed big blue room on the other side
of the front door, are you?  Rumor has it that the connectivity out
there is lousy.

Me thinks:  Of what possible concern are such "disclaimers" to me?
Me thinks:  The sender of such "disclaimers" hopes to absolve 
her/himself from liability exposure resulting from misdirected email?
Me thinks:  Silly person is possibly in error?

I had an issue on a PC running SeaMonkey, with browser warnings anytime
I visited a site using SSL. The problem went away when I corrected the
system date on that PC. The incorrect date had been more than a year off,
which made the cert appear to be expired.

I am not sure if the issue was SeaMonkey specific, possibly other
browsers obtain their date from another source, the Internet perhaps.

Chuck,

   Interesting point. I'll check the system date.

   Today I bought a 4G USB flash drive so I can tar and back up her ~/ and
/etc directories before re-installing 9.04. My 1G drive is too small and I
cannot get the system to recognize the 10G external drive in the Bytecc
adapter. Sigh.

More when I have it,

Rich

I've decided to try installing a Linux Mint, and it's been going well  
so far. I'm just getting into the partitioning, and it has asked me  
something that makes me nervous. I'm going for a dual boot with XP,  
which has already been on the machine.

Mint's installer has gotten to "starting up the partitioner." I now  
have in front of me a box that says, "Unmount partitions that are in  
use?" It says, "The installer has detected that the following disks  
have mounted partitions: /dev/sdb  Do you want the installer to try  
to unmount the partitions on these disks before continuing? If you  
leave them mounted, you will not be able to create, delete or resize  
partitions on these disks, but you may be able to install to exiting  
partitions there."

Yes and no buttons below, with the "no" indicating default.

The Mint installer apparently is set up to create and size new  
partitions.

Advice? Is this a major irreversible step, something critical that  
could bite me with my current setup, or should I just go ahead and do  
it?

This step of unmounting is not dangerous, but you are wandering into
dangerous territory. Are you going to resize a partition, or use an
empty partition that already exists?  Just make sure you don't delete
the partition containing your XP installation, but only resize it.

I have also heard that it is a good idea to "defrag" the MS partition(s) 
first - compact it all down to one end of the partition - they said this 
was because MS (or maybe it was an OEM?) puts important stuff out there 
on the disk that might get whacked during a Linux resizing (any truth in 
that?)  My personal experience was that Linux could successfully resize 
MS up through XP, but not beyond (say as in Vista?) - Your mileage may 
vary, possibly depending on the OEM?
Regards
Fred James

PS:  It is always advisable to have a good recovery plan in place, just 
in case - for me personally, I never cared if MS survived on my personal 
machine(s).  I did try to keep MS on my laptop(s) for easier warranty 
service but when V showed up that went poof - oh, well

You might try shutting down seamonkey, renaming her profile, and starting
seamonkey back up again. I have fixed issues in forefox that way.  If that
fixes it you can just transfer over her bookmarks from her old profile to
the new one.

Chuck,

  Interesting point. I'll check the system date.

  Today I bought a 4G USB flash drive so I can tar and back up her ~/ and
/etc directories before re-installing 9.04. My 1G drive is too small and I
cannot get the system to recognize the 10G external drive in the Bytecc
adapter. Sigh.

More when I have it,

Thanks to those who helped with my partition/mounting question. Now,  
with Linux installed, I have another once.

I got through that process and set up the dual boot. Windows appears  
to function properly. And so did Linux Mint - until a couple of  
minutes ago. I was able to get around the OS, reconfigure a few  
things (like desktop appearance), get on line with Firefox,  download  
and open an app (scribus). But then I got an error message indicating  
an issue with authorization (this after I had already loaded in  
scribus). I logged out, and now when I try to log in I get this:

"GDM could not write to your authorization file. This could mean you  
are out of disk space or that your home directory could not be opened  
for writing. In any case it is not possible to log in. Please contact  
your system administrator."

Any suggestions what I should do now?

One other thought. When I went through partitioning, I didn't specify  
anywhere the *size* of the new partition for Linux. Might it be that  
the installer automatically sized it just large enough for the OS,  
and then when I loaded in scribus, all the space was used up? Might  
that suggest I need to re-size the partition (there should be more  
than 100 gb available on the hard drive)?

If i can get back into the Linux os . . .

Well, you aren't too far into configuring the system, you could
reinstall. Somewhere in the partitioning it must give you control over
what size partition to create.

Instead of trying to login at the graphical login, try Ctrl-Alt-F2 to
get you to a terminal window and log in there.  If this works, run df
-h to see if the partitions are full.

That should bring you up in root mode..  do a df  -h and it will let you

Message-ID: <ddf6f4ca0910301953p574adc0bnf7e2f3edc8c491da@mail.gmail.com>

I've personally never been able to setup a registrar, or hosting
provider DNS in a way that made me happy.  Usually they only let you
set some of the many record types, and it is very tedious with web
forms.  Also they pretty much never let you set the cache refresh to a
low number for performance reasons, but when you are about to switch
IP addresses you want the cache refresh to be a really low number for
a little while just before the switch.


I've had similar experiences but figured it was probably
specific to my registrar.  So am interested to hear of
this.

There exists a live CD of gparted, the open source partition manager:

http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php

You can even boot to it from a USB stick.

Regarding your initial problem, once you have gparted running via live
CD or USB stick you can use it to see what size your Linux partition is
and how much of it is used.

You can boot into single-user mode by appending "failsafe" (without the
quotes) to the boot command.  Some distributions term it Safe Mode, and
you might already have a boot choice set up in your boot menu for this.

You may have to login as root (userid "root"), with your root password.

The df command will show how much free space remains on each partition,
and if that shows 0 in the Avail column for your home partition then it
is the problem, that is, your /home partition somehow got all filled up.

If you have free space in your /home partition, then you can check that
you still have permission to write to your userid directory there, with
the ls -al /home/userid command, where 'userid' is your userid literal.

If your userid is "rxs" the command would be: ls -al /home/rxs

The directory listing should look something like this:

drwxr-xr-x  57 rxs  rxs   12288 2009-10-30 19:11 ./
drwxr-xr-x   4 root root   4096 2009-10-21 15:05 ../
- -rw-rw-r--   1 rxs  rxs      24 2009-03-16 01:19 .somehiddenfile
- -rw-rw-r--   1 rxs  rxs     NNN YEAR-MM-DD HH:MM somenothiddenfile

The important line is the top one, the entry for your own home directory
that starts with ./ on the right.  The third and fourth columns are your
home directory owner and group.  If they're not your userid that is your
problem.

If somehow your ownership of your home directory got changed, you should
be able to change it back running as the root user, by using the command
chown rxs:rxs /home/rxs (change "rxs" to your real userid throughout).

If your issue isn't one of these problems, try to post more information.

Robert

Thanks much for all the help. Upshot is, my new Linux OS now is up  
and working as it should. (Next task will be getting truetype fonts  
installed, but that's for another day.)

Checked the partitions (via the df -h command), and sure enough, the  
installer had allowed just barely enough space in the OS main  
partition to put it in there - about 2.33gb. Solution was via a  
gparted live disk. Had never used gparted before, but with a little  
web research got it to expand the partition to about 10gb, which  
ought to be good enough for the time being, without doing damage  
anywhere else (XP still seems to be working normally too, and all the  
files seem to be in place). And there's still about 100 gb unused  
space on the drive. No more error messages on Mint. So that seems to  
have resolved it.

Anyhow, thanks again for all the speedy (and useful) help.

Tim,

   Excellent suggestion. I'll do this, too, after re-installing the
distribution.

Much grasses,

Subject: [PLUG] CentOS kernel update puzzle regard grub.conf default kernel
Message-ID: <4AEC9898.8050904@seitzassoc.com>

I have two CentOS 5 machines that I just updated to 5.4.  On both 
machines the new kernel was inserted into the top of the list in 
grub.conf.  However, on one machine the default line in grub.conf was 
changed such that the old kernel would boot by default.  On the other, 
default was left at 0 so the new kernel would boot.  This is not the 
first time I've seen this behavior.  What controls whether the default 
gets changed on a kernel update?  I can't think of anything I would 
have done that would cause these two machines to behave differently.

thanks,
galen

It's looking for a template - an existing entry in grub.conf that's
pretty darn close
to the kernel that's being installed.  I think that 'close enough'
involves having
the same title (should be CentOS) the same-ish version (better be
2.6.18-something)
and the same xenedness and PAEness.

make sure that /etc/sysconfig/kernel has the correct type of kernel 
configured.  if you are running smp, but the config file doesn't say that, 
then the grub file won't be updated.
