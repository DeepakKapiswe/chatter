I'd hoped to continue not using wine.
Having said that, it does not.  
michael at bivy:~/.wine$ wine ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/iTunes/iTunes.exe
wine: cannot find L"C:\\windows\\system32\\gearsec.exe"

err:module:attach_process_dlls "odbc32.dll" failed to initialize, aborting
err:module:LdrInitializeThunk Main exe initialization for L"C:\\Program Files\\iTunes\\iTunes.exe" failed, status
c0000005

gearsec.exe does not exist on my system
odbc32.dll is probably failing to initialize becase I'm on a 64 bit system.

Bill,

   Well, I downloaded the bootable .iso, bootable .gz, and source. Other than
detailed instructions on how to make a bootable USB flash drive I find no
instructions on how to run it from the lilo boot memory or anything else.
Strange that the web site has nothing on how to run it and interpret output.

   I think I'd rather burn a cd-rom with the ,iso than use a 1G flash drive
for this.

   Have you any suggestions based on your experiences?

Thanks,

Rich

   Found it: it's all in the FAQ.

   I can use the .bin in /boot just like I did with memtest86.

Not exactly an answer to how to get Linux to talk to iTunes, but on the 
Stephenfry.com page you first posted, there are RSS links to the .m4a files.

I am working with Creative Cares, a local nonprofit organization who's

We need some work done on our web site mostly involving matching the

location, time commitments
and possibly other parameters, then generate an introductory email to 
all parties. Our
current site is hosted at dreamhost.com which has all the tools 
necessary to do what we need.
The current site (www.communitycares.org) is based on Joomla Community

Subject: [PLUG] Network configuration for Ubuntu 10.04
Message-ID: <4CCF49B8.1030709@comcast.net>

I put a second NIC in my machine so I can run LTSP. Before I get to 
that, I want to change eth0 from DHCP to static, since I run Apache for 
my in-house web site. When I try to use the tool provided from the icon 
in the upper right hand portion of the screen, I get an opportunity to 
edit the settings for eth0 and eth1.When I apply the change for eth0 
(from DHCP to IP address: 192.168.0.253, Netmask: 255.255.255.0, 
Gateway: 192.168.0.1) I lose my connection to the Internet. If I change 
it back to DHCP my connection returns. I've tried running sudo ifconfig 
eth0 down, and then up, and even though ifconfig shows eth0 as up with 
192.168.0.253 for its IP address, I can't get out through my router.

Any thoughts on a reliable way to manage my two NICs in Ubuntu 10.04?

Thanks.

The only thing that springs to mind is to make sure there is not another
device on the network with that IP.

does your connection work if you manually assign the same IP that DHCP
assigns you?

Oh yeah, are you able to ping the router?  What about a specific IP address
on the net?

I don't have one to try, outside my router.

One recommendation I found was to uninstall the default Network Manager 
and pick another one from those available from "add/remove" which I 
assume to by Synaptic.

I suspect you might be missing the default gateway when you manually
assign the IP or the routing tables think that the other NIC should be
the default GW .. what does running /sbin/route show after you
manually assign an IP?

Try to ping 74.125.19.147  this is one of google's ip addresses.  If you can
ping it then it is a DNS issue.

You're right. The dialog has a place for me to enter the Gateway. I put 
in the IP address of my router. But the output of /sbin/routes shows 
that there is no Gateway.

$ /sbin/route
Kernel IP routing table

Thanks for the Google IP address. But, no joy:

$ ping 74.125.19.147
connect: Network is unreachable

The two pointers you two provided helped me see something else. I never 
put in anything in the boxes for "DNS servers" or "Search domains" in 
the Network Manager dialog. Also, there's a button for "Routes..." that 
I did nothing with. I have a vague recollection of being asked for a DNS 
server in the past, and I always just put "comcast.net" in the provided 
box. If I put that in Network Manager's DNS server box, the Apply... 
button grays out.

I'm thinking this tool is less than friendly when one wants to do 
something non-standard. I don't remember having this much trouble 
setting up a static IP address with 8.04.

Fedor:

A night of careful reading and studying some working C++ code in a 
library showed me what was going on, but you are exactly correct.

I moved everything out and used non-member operators.

I appreciate your response.  Thank you.

I don't run Ubuntu so I can guide you through whatever network management
tool you're using. However any of those GUI front-ends are going to
read/write from/to the "/etc/network/interfaces" file.

So can you cat that file out and copy & paste the output here so we can see
how both your interfaces are currently configured? It will be a lot easier
to help if you can provide this info.

"cat /etc/network/interfaces"

I don't think that is correct.  NetworkManager doesn't really do
/etc/network/interfaces.  The only interface in my 10.10 install's
/etc/network/interfaces is for loopback.  NM does its own thing.

Also, the cool kids use the iproute utility these days.
ifconfig/route are soooo yesterday.

Bill,

   Certainly looks that way.

   I replaced memtest86 with memtest86+. It ran all night (was in the 13th
pass when I stopped it). In the first pass 8 errors were detected; no
additional ones found.

   What is considered an acceptable error number? The 8 found here seems
high to me, but I know the areas are very tightly packed on the silicon.

   Should I swap these for a new pair?

Thanks,

Rich

Dick,

   The Toshiba laptop here running Xubuntu-10.04 detects and uses wireless
connections automatically. However, when I tried adding the wired network I
ran into the same issues you're facing. Even modifying
/etc/networks/interfaces I could not add a working wired network with a
static IP address. Major PITA.

   Then I discovered that both my Linksys WRT54GC wireless access
points/routers apparently died. I have a new Asus sitting here that I'll set
up as soon as I resolve the memory/hard drive issues on the new desktop and
I'll give up trying to get wired as well as wireless networking going on the
laptop with xubuntu.

IMO, even a single memory error means the underlying DIMM (or 
whatever) should be swapped out. memtest86+ should run completely 
clean.

   Thank you, Paul. That's what I believe to be the case but I've no
knowledge of current memory sticks.

   The manufacturer should test at the factory and ship error-free products.
Back they go today.

Just a few weeks ago I had some RAM that showed up with one error in 
memtest86+. After a couple of runs found the error at the same address, 
I prepared an RMA and the vendor (G.Skill) promptly replaced it.

You can probably "get away" with running RAM that has a small handful of 
errors, but I don't recommend it. If the RAM is still under warranty, 
definitely return it.

Yes, I think you should swap them. There are software fixes you could
use, but why bother if the memory is in warranty. Make sure you get
memory that matches your motherboards specifications.

As Russell says, it doesn't contain much.


I'm thinking I need to give Network Manager more information. 
Specifically, the DNS servers and the Search Domains. A bit of Googling 
turned up a Comcast list showing Primary and Secondary DNS servers for 
Oregon as 68.87.69.150 and 68.87.85.102. The only thing I could find for 
Search Domains is hsd1.fl.comcast.net.

Is there a command that will show me what is being used by the machine 
when I allow DHCP to assign everything? I'd like to confirm the numbers 
and name the ever trustworthy Internet coughed up.

I feel some sympathy for the memory manufacturers.  I'm sure there are 
cases where they get blamed when the actual cause is a marginal 
motherboard design.  I'm not saying that's the case here, I'm just 
pointing out that there are two sides involved.

I'm running F13 in Oracle VM VirtualBox. I'm trying to implement a bash
backup script to backup to CD but am having CD problems of some sort.
My configuration auto-detects and mounts a CD if it has data on it but I've
yet to figure out how to mount a blank CD.
I'm currently focusing on adding a /dev/cdrom line to /etc/fstab and would
like some advice as what should be here for this. OR if you have another
idea or process for sorting this out let me know about that.
Thanks,
Loren

I've tried the following:
/dev/sr0   /media/cdrom   udf,iso9660   defaults   0 0	
/dev/sr0   /media/cdrom   udf,iso9660   noauto,owner,kugzu,rw 0 0	
/dev/loop0   /media/cdrom   udf,iso9660   defaults   0 0	
/dev/loop0 /media/cdrom udf,iso9660 noauto,owner,kugzu,rw 0 0
/dev/cdrom /media/cdrom udf,iso9660 noauto,owner,kugzu,rw 0 0
and a few others.

I get errors like:
[root at localhost ~]# mount /media/cdrom
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loop0,
missing codepage or helper program, or other error
(could this be the IDE device where you in fact use
ide-scsi so that sr0 or sda or so is needed?)
In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
dmesg | tail or so

On Debian/Ubuntu it does interact with /e/n/i - if you mention an interface in
there NM assumes you mean to manage it the old fashioned way, and should no
longer touch that interface.

So, if you set eth1 up in /e/n/i then NM will not break it for you.
Otherwise, yes, it doesn't touch it. :)

Well, it does have the signal advantage that it actually, y'know, works to
manage the features of the Linux IP stack and all. :)

*nod*  This is not like a hard disk, where they automatically swap out those
bad bits on write or anything.

It is also notable that memtest86+ is good, but usually not as hard as running
real software on the machine is; we have previously had occasional faulty
sticks of memory that would run clean for weeks under memtest86+, but would
oops within ten minutes on corruption in the Linux MM lists.[1]

You can't - you don't mount the blank CD to put stuff on it[1], you use a tool
like wodim, or growisofs, along with an ISO9660 filesystem builder, to write a
single stream of data representing everything you want on the disk.

For your purposes I would actually recommend burn:
http://www.bigpaul.org/burn/

It wraps up those tools and makes them trivial to use.  I don't know if F13
packages it, though.

Daniel,

   The loss of mouse clipboard pasting and a few other annoying glitches
appeared only on the new system. While that's not proof of cause-and-effect,
it's presumptive so I'll make arrangements to trade in the two DIMMs for a
fresh set.

I'll second this assessment: it IS worth noting that real-world 
application stress will tickle errors that memtest86+ won't find.

My suspicion in such cases is that the extra power draw and/or heat 
output that occurs under OS/Application load is the proverbial straw 
that breaks the camel's back.

memtest86+ is relatively easy on all aspects of hardware usage other 
than memory. Marginal components are more likely to reveal their true 
nature when hard drives are spinning furiously, data buses and 
expansion cards are pushing bits like mad, and CPU instructions are 
queued in a long line.

If the errors show up in a repeatable location in memory, you could try
swapping the positions of the two DIMMS.  Then, if you run memtest+ and the
locations change, you can be sure that the memory is bad and it is not a
glitch on the motherboard.

Or, just have them replaced...  :-)

Well I use 'Ceni' as it's the net mngr that's pre-packaged w. Sidux (Debian

When I'm setting up a mult-net config, I prefer to roll my own via
/etc/net/ifaces.

Here's a net iface stanza from my /etc/net/ifaces file if you're interested
in going that route
iface eth0 inet static
        address 192.168.110.9
        broadcast 192.168.110.255

To use Network Manager on Ubuntu 10.04 to change from DHCP to a static 
IP address do the following:

Right click on the Network Manager icon -- it's the square with a dot in 
the middle and a diagonal line running down and to the left from the 
bottom left corner of the square.

Select "Edit Connections..." from the drop down menu.

Select the appropriate NIC from the list (in the current case, that was 
shown as Auto eth0) and click on the "Edit..." button.

In the "Editing Auto eth0" dialog click the "IPv4 Settings" tab.

Change "Method" from the "Automatic (DHCP)" entry to the "Manual" entry.

Under "Addresses" click the "Add" button.

Enter the desired address in the "Address" column, the desired netmask 
in the "Netmask" column, and the gateway address in the "Gateway" 
column. Be sure to hit the <enter> key after entering the gateway 
address. If you click away from it, the address disappears. In my 
example the addresses are:

Address:     192.168.0.253
Netmask:    255.255.255.0
Gateway:    192.168.0.1

Enter the desired DNS server addresses in the "DNS servers:" box, 
separating each address with a comma. For my example the numbers from 
Comcast are:

68.87.69.150,68.87.85.102

Enter the desired search domain address in the "Search domains:" box. 
Again, in my example the search domain from Comcast is:

hsd1.fl.comcast.net

Next, click the "Apply..." button. You will be asked to authenticate by 
providing your root password.

Finally, to really apply the changes, bring the connection down by 
clicking (not right clicking) the Network Manager icon and clicking 
"Disconnect" on the line under the connection you just changed. Then 
bring the connection back up by clicking the Network Manager icon and 
clicking on "Auto eth0" or whatever is appropriate for your situation.

I'm personally not a big fan of the search domain setting, especially when
it comes to Comcast. It tells your computer to query Comcast's domain and if
they can't resolve your query they'll redirect you at their discretion. Of
course they do this because businesses pay them $ to do it.

So I don't ever set a search domain and although I use Qwest I always point
to a public DNS server. I point to University of Oregon's 2 pub DNS
servers.

I also run a my own dns cache server on my Linux notebook too so that
probably makes me a bit of DNS freak But I want my DNS fast & true. And I
don't want anybody messing with my queries, especially some cable tv
company...

It does happen that a marginal or slightly flaky motherboard design can
cause intermittent memory errors.  I think it's happening on my desktop.

I built this with a motherboard that a friend gave me that someone else
didn't want, and this might be why.

I have one of the first edition Asus Crosshair motherboards with 2x 1GB
DDR2 800Mhz DIMMs of Crucial Ballistix Tracer memory.  Crucial replaced
those twice under the lifetime warranty because they wouldn't even POST.

(The Crucial memory was cheap, I think I paid about $30 for both DIMMs,
and that's the only reason I ended up with such gamer bling RAM sticks.)

The second time it sent me newer 2V DIMMs to replace the 2.2V originals
and I haven't had any further POST errors with these sticks since then.

However, every few days to few weeks, I'm getting random memory errors,
which don't seem to follow any specific pattern.  In memtest86+ testing
it sometimes fails fairly quickly and sometimes later during block move
tests.  Maybe the memory is degrading, but I suspect that it's actually
a slightly flaky motherboard design, maybe the Nvidia controller chips.

Every time I get these memory errors, turning off the system for awhile
then rebooting seems to resolve the problem, then memtest86+ runs fine.

I doubt that this is the sort of problem Rich is having, but it happens.

I agree that Rich should exchange the memory, and that'll likely fix it.

However I'm probably looking for a new motherboard, and some ECC memory.

Robert, et al.:

   I have the Asus M4A79LT-M LE with 4G of Kingston RAM and the Athlon II
dual core CPU. This is what the folks at ENU recommended since my old(er)
Asus motherboard and Athlon X2 did well for the relatively light loads on
it. (One thing I like about ENU is they will sell down to what I really need
rather than trying to sell me more expensive hardware.)

   I'll arrange to exchange the RAM tomorrow.

Subject: [PLUG] Removing OOo with yum ... or?
Message-ID: <20101102154415.237ece30@mailhost.pdx.edu>

When I installed Fedora 11 x86_64 it came with OpenOffice 3.something.
After using it for a bit I discovered lots of missing features. It
turns out that Fedora decided to remove some things because they felt
they were not clean enough for Fedora. So I used Yumex to uninstall the
Fedora version of OOo, then installed 3.1.1 which I downloaded from
openoffice.org.

Now I wish to upgrade to OOo 3.2.1, which I just downloaded from
openoffice.org. I am amazed at the lack of documentation. That is,
there is an installation readme on the OOo website, but it is silent
about *upgrading*. It just addresses installation as though the user
does not have OOo installed yet.

Google turned up a couple places that seemed to suggest that one needs
to remove OOo and then reinstall the new version. I suppose that would
be safer than just trying to overwrite old packages with new packages.
But that brings me to the present dilemma: How to remove OOo 3.1.1.

After untarring the 3.1.1 version (which I no longer have on my hard
disk) it consisted of around 30 RPMs. As I recall I just navigated to
the folder and did "rpm install *.rpm" and it all worked. But I don't
even know the names of the old RPMs, so I'm not sure how to uninstall
them while being sure that I get them all.

Yumex lists lots of things for OOo, but I think they are the packages
from the Fedora repos. 

I tried to read the man pages for yum and rpm, but they were pretty
hard to follow.

So how does one remove a mega package like OOo?

Something like this will get you in the ballpark:
rpm -qa | grep -i openoffice

If you "yum install yum-utils" you can use the handy "package-cleanup"
tool to list installed RPMs that aren't available from currently
installed Yum repositories:
package-cleanup --orphans

I figured it out with the help of a kind soul who posted how he did it
on a Fedora forum. For the record:

su
rpm -qa | grep ooo > rmlist
rpm -qa | grep openoffice > rmlist
cat rmlist #check to be sure they are all OOo 3.1.1 packages (they were)
rpm -e 'cat rmlist'

Then I used the setup script that came with the new version. All is
well and 3.2.1 appears to be working fine. So far the only advantage I
see is that it can finally use OTF fonts that are based on Type 1 fonts
(e.g., everything from Adobe). I checked a couple of longstanding bugs
and they still are not fixed.

For my next adventure I will upgrade my Fedora 11 laptop to Fedora 13.

Oops. The third line should have had a double arrow:

rpm -qa | grep openoffice >> rmlist

And the fourth line should presumably use backticks.
   rpm -e `cat rmlist`

Oh crap. But I have this cool genuine Fedora DVD for 13 which a fellow
at the Fedora booth at Oscon last summer gave to me. It's really pretty.
I understand I can use it to upgrade. 

Can I do the same if I download the 14 ISO and burn it to a CD?
Wait ... I'm not sure I want to go to 14 yet. 

In fact, I'm not sure I like the constant upgrades at Fedora. I have
gotten no updates for my Fedora 11 since shortly after 13 came out.
Like, they cut you off. Not even security updates.

If it wouldn't take me several days to reinstall and reconfigure
everything I'd be tempted to go to Lucid, just for the long term
support.

Sorry - I just meant to say that while memtest showing an error *is*
sufficient to prove that a DIMM is faulty, the absence of memtest errors is
*not* sufficient to prove that the DIMM is good. :)

That is what Fedora is for.  Cutting edge, but stiletto blade. 
Those of us more interested in long term support use RHEL or its
clones.  Which means you don't get the latest stuff, unless you
choose to fold it in yourself, and disable updates for that.

RHEL6 is in Beta 2, so the release is due any month now. 
It is approximately Fedora 13.  I am using pokey old RHEL5. 
More precisely, Scientific Linux 5, because Fermilabs will be
supporting it long after Red Hat stops doing so.  SL comes
with extra scientific packages that I like,  as well as
supercomputer software and a bunch of other hacks to support
their scientific users.  The world's biggest computers,
and my little 4 watt Alix, run SL5.  

The supercomputers are why they support it for so long.  When
100,000 CPUs are grinding away on a 3 year long computation,
you don't want to upgrade the distro in the middle.

I already knew the purpose of Fedora before I started with it a year
ago. I was distro shopping in an effort to expand my knowledge of other
versions of Linux. And having spent some time in other distros, the one
that suits my needs best is Ubuntu. I would go back to it right now
except that it would take at least four days to get all my apps
reinstalled and configured and working properly.

At the moment it appears that I am going to have to give up on OOo
3.2.1. The only benefit is being able to use OTF fonts. But it breaks
Zotero, and I must have Zotero for citations and references in papers. 

Zotero is a Java plugin for Firefox and OOo. I absolutely hate Java
apps. I have NEVER had a Java app that did not require hours of
tweaking and futzing and googling to get it to work. Java must attract
dilettante programmers who have no clue what they are doing. I also
have no idea how to program, but I have the good sense not to try.

And upgrading my Fedora 11 would install a newer version of Firefox,
which would make matters even worse.

I found that Open Office 3.2 greatly improved compatibility with the
newer MS Office files. (The ones with an 'x' at the end.) At least for
me that was a life-saver.

But if you want a list of things they changed, it's here:
http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/features/3.2/

Of course, if there's nothing on there that matters to you then
there's no benefit.

I was always surprised that Open Office wanted a Java install on the
system. I don't usually do much with Java programs, but when I do I've
had pretty good luck in general. Though there have been times where
they've been incredibly frustrating!

I sent this out on Monday but it, for some reason, never posted to the list.
Try again . . .


I am working with Creative Cares, a local nonprofit organization who's
mission is "To match creative professionals with organizations in need?locally,
regionally and globally". We need some work done on our web site mostly involving matching the
Creatives with the nonprofits who need them. We need to match on skills, interests,
location, time commitments and possibly other parameters, then generate an introductory email to
all parties. Our current site is hosted at dreamhost.com which has all the tools
necessary to do what we need. The current site (www.communitycares.org) is based on Joomla Community
Builder with mysql underneath. I am looking for someone locally to help put this together.
We hope to get a grant soon to pay for the work.

If you can do this work or know someone who can, please contact me at:
fhh @ frankhuntphoto.com

Comparisons of OOo with MS Office always rated Calc as significantly
inferior to Excel. I'm not surprised to see the majority of the changes
are in Calc. I have launched Calc maybe a couple times in the past
year, so it makes no difference to me. Looking at the list in the above
link the only real benefit is being able to use my Adobe OTF fonts. But
I need Zotero more than I need to be able to use Type 1 based OTF
fonts.

OOo will run without Java, and you can download a Java-free version. As
far as I know, OOo uses Java only for its wizards and optional
extensions like Zotero. And all but Zotero are happy to use an open
source version of Java.

Right now I am trying to figure out what Iced Tea does and how to
replace it with something else. Zotero is actually two add-ons for
Firefox, and one extension for OOo. You keep your reference list in
Firefox, and the OOo extension creates a toolbar that lets you access
the list from Writer. 

The problem is the interactivity between OOo and Firefox. It is well
documented on the Zotero forums that current versions of the Zotero
add-ons require Sun Java. I currently have the latest version 1.6-22,
and two previous versions -18 and -20. Everyone says they have it
working fine with -18, so I set OOo to use -18, and I set it as the
default for Fedora. But apparently there is some conflict with the Iced
Tea add-on for Firefox. If I disable Iced Tea in Firefox, then Firefox
has no Java at all. I think I need to install a different one for
Firefox and completely remove Iced Tea with yum, but I haven't figured
out yet how to install a replacement for Iced Tea in Firefox. At least,
if you go to Mozilla's list of available add-ons there is only Iced
Tea, so installing a replacement is not going to be just a
click-click-click operation.

I finally succeeded in getting Zotero working on OOo 3.2.1 with Firefox
3.5.9 on Fedora 11 x86_64. My trek is documented in the Zotero forums:

In its "Command Substitution" subsection, the bash(1) man page even 
makes a special point of calling out this circumstance: "The command 
substitution $(cat file) can be replaced by the equivalent but faster 
$(< file)."

But, but, but what if you are passing in thousands of arguments?
Interestingly, /bin/echo seems to handle overrunning ARG_MAX, though I
don't know about rpm.

cat is fewer system calls, though:
[dyoung at dyoung tmp]$ strace echo $(cat rmlist) >/dev/null 2>/tmp/cat;
wc -l /tmp/cat
37 /tmp/cat
[dyoung at dyoung tmp]$ strace xargs echo < rmlist >/dev/null
2>/tmp/xargs; wc -l /tmp/xargs
52 /tmp/xargs

So -1 to me for being pedantic. ;-)

But xargs completes faster:

[dyoung at dyoung tmp]$ seq 1000000 > /tmp/1000000
[dyoung at dyoung tmp]$ time echo $(cat /tmp/1000000) > /dev/null

real	0m2.293s
user	0m2.150s
sys	0m0.149s
[dyoung at dyoung tmp]$ time xargs echo < /tmp/1000000 > /dev/null

real	0m0.534s
user	0m0.197s
sys	0m0.403s

Nice! I hadn't ever thought of that.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1011031741110.3774@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I'd like some guidance on setting up the new Asus WL-520GC WAP/Router. The
instruction manual is totally useless -- in 23 languages, no less! -- as it
servers only to tell readers how to insert the Windows 'EZ Setup' disk in
their Windows computer and launch it from the startup menu. As useful as a
rubber crutch for those of us not running a Microsoft OS.

   A Google search turned up the default IP address (192.168.1.1), username
(admin) and user password (admin). This information is not in the
instruction manual.

   I've tried to reach the Asus via the Web browser on my notebook using a
ethernet cable from my notebook to either the WAN or LAN1 ports on the Asus.
Neither will load the admin login page.

   The notebook's eth0 is configured for the local network. If I'm accessing
the Asus via a http connection does this matter? Should I be opening a file
named 192.168.1.1 rather than a http connection?

   A clue stick or three would be quite helpful at this point.

TIA,

Rich

Hi Rich,

Just a couple of ideas to spur our thinking...

  * can you ping 192.168.1.1
  * might the router respond to an https:// request?


Very Best,

As I recall, you tend to set static IPs on your network. Are your statics in
the 192.168.1.x range?

If not, you won't be able to reach the router.

I just upgraded Fedora 11 x86_64 to Fedora 13 x86_64 using the DVD.
Actually, I tried to upgrade to Fedora 14, but the Fedora 14 DVD
informed me that it could only do two versions. Using the decimal
arithmetic I learned in kindergarten, I quickly calculated that it
would work if I used a Fedora 13 DVD. Indeed, the Fedora 13 DVD worked
fine.

However, after the install a number of programs will not launch.
Frequently I get the error message "Authentication denied: User doesn't
exist 521."

I hate to inform the Fedora project, but I do, indeed, exist. Cogito
ergo sum. Wait ... I can't think. OK, nevertheless, I exist. I'm not
sure if I'm user 521, however.

If anyone has a clue, please share it with me.

Why not do a clean install.??..  Then just add you home directory later?

Which programs?  I don't know anything about Fedora, but I am able to
apply the General Problem Solving Algorithm, generally.  That nice
man, Mr Google, doesn't seem to recognize that error message, are you
certain that's literally the error message you get?

Cat /etc/shadow and it should give you the UID of your user and who
the mysterious account assigned 521 is.

<Sigh>

I get this response all the time.

Before doing the upgrade, as a precaution, I wrote down all the apps in
Gnome application launcher. There were 112 entries. And that doesn't
include all the command line utilities that I use.

The last time I did a fresh install was when I moved from Ubuntu Jaunty
to Fedora 11. It took five days to reinstall all my applications and
get things back the way they were.

It is exactly:

Authentication denied: 521 User doesn't exist!

It's happening all over the place.

Also, many apps will not launch from the Applications menu. No error
messages, just nothing happens. That includes Ktorrent and all OOo
apps. I haven't tried everything. But Firefox and Claws-Mail are
working fine. I haven't looked at the logs yet.

Cat /etc/shadow does not work. I can't copy and paste the error message
from the terminal window because the copy button is grayed out.
Basically, it said "permission denied" so I repeated it as sudo, and it
said "error while loading shared libraries libaudit.so.0; cannot open
shared object file; no such file or directory

I have always been in the sudoer list and never had a problem before.

I should add that I went into System > Administration > Users and

are me (jjj) and an alter ego that I created a long time ago (jcj).

This might point to the problem. Did the audit-libs package get

implies that it might not have because of dependency problems. Instead of
the DVD can you now do a web upgrade? Maybe that will fix things.

Your guess may be accurate.

Note that I upgraded Fedora 11 x86_64 to Fedora 13 x86_64. That's two
versions. I actually tried the Fedora 14 DVD, but it said it could only
go back to Fedora 12. Nevertheless, after upgrading to Fedora 13 Yumex
lists pages and pages of updates. 

Moreover, about a third of my installed apps will not launch. Using
Yumex I discovered that those that will not launch were apparently not
upgraded by the DVD. Perhaps I should have done the Preupgrade instead. 

One by one I am going through my Appliications menu and using Yumex to
update everything that will not launch. I have made it through all the
folders except System Tools. Using Yumex I have fixed everything except
all the OOo applications, Pulseaudio Device Chooser, and Praat. The OOo
applications were installed from openoffice.org, not the Fedora repos.
I'll probably end up just uninstalling and reinstalling them. Praat is
a mystery, but I'm subscribed to their e-list and someone will probably
come up with a solution. Pulseaudio Device Chooser is probably not
worth bothering with.

Having gone through the majority of my installed apps, the error
message "Authentication denied ..." is no longer popping up. I have no
idea why. But I'm happy to live with the outcome. :)

Wes,

   Ah, yes. This reminds me that I need to assign eth0 to 192.168.1.0 as well
as the real lan. That's adding anouther route until I reassign the router's
IP address.

If Bill's suggestion does not work, this may be time to boot into
runlevel 1. Haven't tried F13, so I don't know if the option readily
exists from the GRUB menu -- but if it does (this works with older
versions of Fedora -- and RHEL 6 beta)

1) Boot the system
2) When a message like "press a key within 5 seconds" appears, do so
3) Press a (or p to enter a password, then press a)
4) In the line that appears, type a space followed by 1, press Enter
5) Press b to boot into runlevel 1
6) A command line should appear -- you'll be the root user. You should
then be able to run [cat /etc/shadow]

Thanks,
Mike

Perhaps you're not aware of the traditional way to copy and paste 
under X.  I rarely use the Edit menu or its associated short cuts.

No guarantees that it will work in your situation, but I would bet yes.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1011040922590.10096@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   For some reason GoogleEarth-5 doesn't want to run here. Running with
strace isolates the problem:

exit_group(127)                         = ?

   This happens with both the vanilla Google Earth or the repackaged
Slackware package.

   My Google search turns up a similar bug related to the library and symbol
but on Fedora Core 8 running X.org with the 'openchrome' driver and a
different problem: black screen when loaded.

   Where do you suggest I go for help? Does Google take such reports?

The problem is more or less resolved. I haven't seen the error message
since yesterday sometime.

As far as I can tell the problem was due to a massive number of
packages that the upgrade from Fedora 11 to Fedora 13 failed to
upgrade, including lots of dependencies. 

Using Yumex I have been going through the list and updating all the
packages that it says need updating. I am up to k, except for a few
that will not update due to missing dependencies. 

For some reason Yumex displays the updatable packages in alphabetical
order, except Virtualbox-OSE and Virtualbox-OSE-guest, which it lists
at the top of the list. And those two refuse to update; each says the
other is a dependency and it can't update either without the other. Nor
will Yumex uninstall either one.

I have most of my installed apps working, except for Virtualbox-OSE.,
which will not launch. There are a couple others that will not launch
as well, but I'll work on them later. I need Virtualbox only a couple
times a month, but when I need it I really need it.

So now can you look at /etc/passwd and tell us who user 521 is? Maybe he got
created with one of those updates.

Sure. I just looked at /etc/passwd, and at /etc/passwd-. Interestingly,
they have time stamps of 19:17 and 19:01 yesterday, which is roughly
when I did the upgrade from Fedora 11 to Fedora 13.

But the error message did get one thing right - user 521 does not
exist.

So he must have been there right before the upgrade and was expected by some
of the old packages, but was removed during the upgrade. The packages that
didn't get upgraded expected him to still be there.

I'm not sure about that. I certainly never created a user 521. I have
two accounts, jjj (normal) and jcj (for emergencies). If a user 521 was
there he was created by some package. 

I was also having a lot of trouble selecting text, and that problem
has also disappeared. For example, I would try to delete some stuff in
an e-mail reply and I would get a weird popup on top of the area I was
selecting. It was usually when I was trying to select some text with a
> in it.

I landed on a web page.  (I realize that web pages do contain multiple

Can socket connections be limited from another running program which

Hello,

IMHO, you get this response because it is the preferred method, especially
if you are more than 2 versions distant from current.  Doing an upgrade from
N-2 or earlier almost invariably leads to... headaches ;) (N being current)
Same thing with upgrading more than one step at a time.

If you are all set now, then this is something to keep in mind for future
purposes.

One of the best ways to go, is to keep a separate partition for /home, this
way when you do a clean install of the newer version, all your user data
remains intact.  Plus, you can backup your important /etc config files to a
subdirectory in /home (like /home/[user]/backup for instance), and compare
those with the new ones after the install.

Plus, here is a good tip for you, if you remain on Fedora going forward
(which I encourage you to do!).
There is a much easier way to keep track of your installed programs, than
going through manually and writing them all down.

Before the upgrade install, run this command as root (or put sudo at the
beginning):

rpm -q --qf '%{NAME}\n' -a > rpmlist.txt

This will make a list of ALL your installed programs, and will strip out the
version numbers (this is important).
You can then sort alphabetically if you want (it won't really matter to yum,
but makes it easier to look through yourself):

cat rpmlist.txt | sort > rpmlistsorted.txt

This will give you a list of all installed programs, by name only (no
version number included), so when you go to install them on the new system,
it won't get hung up on version numbers, it will install whatever version is
current for the new release.  I usually keep these commands saved in a txt
file in my /home directory.

When you are ready, you have your config files backed up and this rpmlist
created, then do a CLEAN install of the new release (making sure during the
hard drive setup phase to tell it to mount the /home partition but do NOT
format it).

After that is done, fetch all the available updates.

Then, you can run this command (again as root or with sudo), and it will
process through, telling you many of them are already installed (which is
expected), and then it will get to the ones that are not installed, and
install them.

xargs yum -y install < rpmlistsorted.txt

Also, if you have a separate /home, when you log in after the new install,
going through the initial setup, you create a user with the same username as
before, and it will automatically reuse your existing /home/[username]
directory, and once all your programs are reinstalled, they _should_ pick up
any custom configurations you have saved in your /home directory structure.

The yum install part will take a while, so fire it off and go grab a coffee
or something.  But, letting that chug for an hour or so is a lot less hassle
than going through manually for a week or two.

This is the method I have been using for some time now, and just did it with
Fedora 14.  It makes things quite easy.  Note there may still be some
tweaking necessary after all is said and done, but not many many days worth.

So to sum up, stick these in a txt file somewhere in /home, and save them,
run the first two before the new install, and the last one after.

Before install:
rpm -q --qf '%{NAME}\n' -a > rpmlist.txt
(optional)
cat rpmlist.txt | sort > rpmlistsorted.txt

After install:
xargs yum -y install < rpmlistsorted.txt


HTH!

... and may the Source be with you.

Here's a FWIW.

I am normally a Debian/unstable guy and to me "releases" are an alien
concept.  However, recently I have deployed a few Ubuntu boxes for
family members for "usability" reasons.  And, actually, also on a few
laptops I have floating around.  A couple of them had fallen a few
releases behind and their users recently got ominous warnings that
support of 9.04 was going away.

So, I cautiously did the recommended thing, which was "update-manager
-d", and ... it worked fine.  I had to re-do it three times (9.04 ->
9.10 -> 10.04 -> 10.10) to get up to date, but it all went fine.  Not
so much as a hiccup.  Maybe it's a .deb thing that it goes so
smoothly, I don't know.  Only that I'd heard the "oh, do a fresh
install" advice, I ignored it, and I seem to have lived to tell the
tale.

Matt> cat rpmlist.txt | sort > rpmlistsorted.txt

Oooh!  UUOC!

  sort rpmlist.txt > rpmlistsorted.txt

though personally, if I wanted it sorted I would typically just pipe
the output through sort to begin with, something like:

  rpm -q --qf '%{NAME}\n' -a | sort > rpmlist.txt

It's not the preferred method if you have so many apps installed that
it takes you a week to get them all reinstalled. I am serious.

In my experience there are sometimes issues with an upgrade, but so far
it has always been less work than a fresh install. In my current
situation it has taken about six hours to fix problems with the upgrade
from Fedora 11 to Fedora 13. Compare that with days to reinstall apps
after a fresh install.

It appears that the "fresh install" advocates never have a clue how
complex my installation is. 

As for software to get a list of installed apps, I have done that. I
had someone on the Fedora forums give me excellent commands to generate
lists. Unfortunately, any command you use will generate a list of all
RPMs. More than three quarters of them are libraries and dependencies.
The resulting list was just about unreadable. It would be awesome if the
Gnome menu editor had an export function, but it does not. Copying down
the 100+ apps by hand took only a little over ten minutes and gave me a
list that is actually usable. I realize it is not the geek way, but
it's my way.

My upgrade from Fedora 11 to 13 is now complete except:

* Can't get VirtualBox to launch. Missing module error messages.
* Praat won't launch. It appears for a second, then disappears. 
* I have four python packages that won't update because they are all
incompatible with each other.

Google and e-lists will come up with the solutions. And I'll expand my
knowledge in the process.

And it doesn't have to take a week to get them reinstalled.
I had a ton of apps installed on my Fedora VM, and it took about half an
hour for yum to chug through the list and reinstall them all.
The only reason this method would not work, is if you install a bunch of
apps using non standard methods, i.e. source tar.gz files, or other binary
tar.gz files, and so on.  If you install all (or even most) of your apps
using RPMs, and better yet using yum (and not just random RPMs downloaded
off the net), the rpm list method will work.

Maybe, maybe not.  I have had complex installs myself, and I used to do the
upgrade path.  It worked OK for the most part, but there were almost always
issues.  Now I have decided it is less headache to do a clean install, and
just feed the rpm list to yum and let it chug.

Again, if you use the list of all installed RPMs, feed it to yum, it is
smart enough to toss out the stuff that is already installed (meaning ignore
it, not uninstall it), and ask if you want to install the stuff that is
new.  When it is done, voila, all your apps are reinstalled.  It doesn't
take weeks, it takes less than an hour (for me anyway, and I had about 1300
new apps beyond the standard live install image).  It doesn't have to be
readable by a person, just by yum ;)  Though of course it is readable, if
you feel like going through it all...
This also only works well if you strip out the version numbers, and feed it
only the package names.  Otherwise you will run into dependency issues and
so forth.

As for VirtualBox are you checking their forum?
Can't help with Praat...
As for the python, have you tried uninstalling all four at the same time (as
in, using rpm -e python-[x,y,z,a] on the command line), then reinstalling?
There is probably some kind of circular dependency hook that is giving you
the monkey wrench.

   This assumes that you do not install any applications in /usr/ other than
what comes on the distribution disks. For many of us, that's not the case.

   If I get two versions behind on Slackware, I upgrade one version at a
time. And I make sure that everything is working properly on the first
upgrade before proceeding to the second one. With few exceptions, this has
worked for me. And, I'm normally no more than one version behind.

"It hurts when I do that."
"Don't do that."

This is what /usr/local and /opt are for, and that's why I have both 
of them on separate partitions.  Installing non-distribution stuff 
into /usr is just tempting fate.

galen,

   I've had this discussion with the slackbuilds.org folks and they insist
their practices are in line with the FHS. They write that /usr/local and
/opt are for locally-developed, location-specific applications. You're
welcome to present your support of my position to their mail list.

Do they have some coercive power over you to decide where you install
your locally compiled software?  I mean, you could use:

  --prefix=/upside-down-and-backwards

in your configuration commandline, and that would be strictly between
you and your (hopefully) consenting PATH env.

IMHO this should be tried as an alternative image first.  They already have

Subject: [PLUG] Python questions
Message-ID: <20101105141221.5e15b3a9@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I have four python files that Fedora 13 thinks need to be updated:

gnome-python2-applet (x86_64)
gnome-python2-desktop (x86_64)
gnome-python2-gnomekeyring (x86_64)
python-mako (noarch)

Yumex will not update any of them because it complains that they are
incompatible with other packages. So I decided I would just nuke them
and then reinstall. Yumex won't nuke them either, so I tried from the
command line. I started with python-mako, but was informed that it was
required for Deluge and Azureus. 

So then I decided to stop and ask before I mess something up. Gnome
is running just fine, but it might not run at all after I nuke the first
three. I think there are command line tools to find out what a package
is a dependency of, but I don't know what they are. 

Suggestions and advice needed.

the following is just my opinion...

first, i'm glad to see some experimentation in the desktop arena. the
large majority of popular distributions are largely vanilla gnome
installations with a bit of tweaking, so anything that promotes
diversity in the desktop space is ok by me. maybe in a few years we'll
all be on Unity. that being said, i agree wholeheartedly that such a
drastic shift should really be tested in a spawned release rather than
main. i don't see the new-to-linux user that Ubuntu caters to taking
this type of drastic shift lightly.

this type of reckless abandon without regard to loudly expressed
userbase concerns about the decision have prompted me to shuffle over to
crunchbang statler (debian + openbox). things don't get much stabler
than debian. so far it's been a good move, i was especially impressed
that for once i didn't have to do any additional work to get my broadcom
wireless working. it just worked!

and... there it is again... choice.

And here I am, chasing my way backwards towards a more minimalist desktop...
I suppose its inevitable to want more eyecandy and a better platform to
provide it, but until openGL starts beating DirectX in every possible way
and hardware manufacturers cough up current stable 3d enabled drivers it
seems like the cart before the horse to me...

First, I managed to update python-mako, and then I discovered the
problem with:

gnome-python2-applet (x86_64)
gnome-python2-desktop (x86_64)
gnome-python2-gnomekeyring (x86_64)

It turns out that there was a gnome-python2 package to create python
bindings for the Nautilus CD burner. I didn't realize that it was from
Fedora 11 until I did package-cleanup --problems, which listed missing
dependencies for it. When I tried to reinstall it yum informed me that
it was not available. It was then that I decided to read its name
carefully.

After erasing the old package the three updates finally installed
without a problem.

Message-ID: <20101105212002.3430856a@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I killed Firefox. I didn't like its appearance, so I downloaded several
themes, intending to try them out one at a time. Of course, you have to
restart Firefox to see the new theme. So I selected one of the themes
and told Firefox to restart. It did not restart. Clicking on the
launch menu item, it still won't launch. In the Gnome panel I see
"starting Firefox" for about 15 seconds, then it disappears. From the
command line it just returns me to the prompt without any error
messages.

I reinstalled with yum, but Firefox still won't launch.

I'm trying to figure out where Firefox saves its configs and themes and
such. It's not in a hidden folder in my home folder. If I can find the
themes I can rename the files one at a time.

Never mind. It wouldn't start because it was still running. After
killing it with top it launches fine.

John,

   Perhaps you're not seeing the message that firefox is already running. I
get that occasionally for reasons I don't understand. Regardless, the
solution is to run

 	ps ax | grep firefox-bin

and see if there are firefox-bin processes listed. If all you see is the
grep process, then that's not the issue. If you see firefox-bin processes,
issue the command

 	killall firefox-bin

and that should clear the way for a new instance to load and run.

Subject: [PLUG] Odd partition has appeared
Message-ID: <20101106152834.587cf0ac@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Following my recent upgrade from Fedora 11 x86_64 to Fedora 13 x86_64,
I have discovered that there is now a new partition listed by Nautilus
when I view the "Computer" folder. It now lists:

CD/DVD Drive
vg_devil8
File System

"Devil8" is the name of the computer, so that part is clear. The icon
for vg_devil8 looks like an older, taller hard drive. It has a round
green blob in the corner that says VG in tiny white letters. If I
double click on vg_Devil8 Nautilus gives me an error message that it
can't mount the location.

Also, there is now a menu item Under System > Administration labeled
Logical Volume Manager. Launching it gives me a GUI view of vg_devil8,
where "vg" apparently stands for "volume group." The GUI shows a
"logical view" and a "physical view" of sda2, the root partition. (I
set up the 320 GB hard drive with a 200 MB boot partition, and the
remainder as sda2 for root; no separate swap partition.)

All seems to be fine except that gParted now shows /dev/sda2 with a big
orange triangle with an exclamation mark in it and the file system is
now lvm2, where it used to be labeled ext3. Right clicking on /dev/sda2
and selecting Information gives a warning "Logical volume management is
not yet supported." I assume that warning means that gParted doesn't
support it, since everything seems to be running fine.

I suppose now I'm going to have to spend hours googling to figure out
what a logical volume is as opposed to a partition, and why Fedora 13
decided I needed one.

Yes, but I don't know of anything on Linux that acts as a suitable front end;
over in OS-X land there are "Little Snitch" and a couple of similar tools.

However, you might be able to address at least some of your issues with some
combination (for Firefox; alternatives exist for other platforms) of AdBlock+,
together with the EasyPrivacy list, and/or Ghostery.

They both serve to stop a wide range of those extra services and/or monitoring
tools from working on the page.  (You might also want FlashBlock to avoid that
adding more paths to fetching ... stuff. :)

I would add NoScript to that list of Firefox extensions, it is a
whitelist/blacklist for javascript.
NoScript + AdBlock == the web is a little more sane again ;)

AdBlock+
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865/

NoScript
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/722/

Chances are good that some kind of embedded scripts are calling some of
those extra connections.

This from <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_volume_management> ... 
which does agree with my experience, except that at that time we could 
not "re-size or move ... without interrupting the system use" unless we 
unmounted the volume(s) in question.  And in our case at least, that 
would most certainly have interrupted the system use.  Hope this helps

Well, it turns out that suddenly I wish I could resize my partitions.
My boot partition is 200 MB, which is how it was set up by default when
I installed Fedora 11 a year ago. My root partition is the rest of the
drive, with 2.5 MB free.

I just now tried to use Preupgrade to upgrade Fedora 13 to Fedora 14,
and Preupgrade announced that it could not continue because there was
not enough room on the boot partition for the image it needed to create.
Way to go Fedora. Two hundred megabytes ought to be enough for anyone.
There are other ways to upgrade to Fedora 14, but I'd prefer to use
Preupgrade. Therefore, I now have a motivation to learn how to resize
partitions, which I have never done before.

I can't use gParted, because it does not support logical volumes yet.
According to Google there is a tool "lvm2" which one uses to work with
logical volumes. But it's new and there are several things it can't do
yet. It would be interesting to learn why Fedora decided to change my
root partition to a logical volume group when the tools to work with it
are not yet ready.

I'm going to ignore the issue for the time being and use the Fedora 14
DVD to upgrade from 13 to 14. Meantime I'll google on the issue and
maybe at the next Clinic we can play with how to resize a logical
volume group.

John,

A "logical volume" (LV) is a block of storage, the characteristics
of which are maintained by the OS, rather than by the disk drive.
There are a number of advantages to using logical partitions.

* Unlike a disk partition, which is limited to a single drive, an
LV can contain multiple partitions, from multiple drives.  This
means that you can have a whopping big "partition" without having
to spend the money on a whopping big drive.

*  Partitions can be re-sized in an LV fairly easily.  You can
have a large LV, and a number of small partitions with unused
space in the LV.  If you need to enlarge a partition, it's
reasonably easy, and you don't have to mess with the underlying
hard drive partitioning.  You can also easily add a partition to
the LV.

*  You can add more physical volumes (read: hard drive partitions)
to an existing LV.  I haven't done this, but from what I've read,
it doesn't look very difficult.

*  It is possible to "snapshot" an LV, for backup purposes.  I
have not looked into this, so I don't know how it works.  However,
it looks like it should be a nice way of being able to run full
backups of a live system.

The graphical tool you mentioned is pretty nice -- certainly
easier than doing it via the command line.  My oh my is there a
lot of typing involved.  It's not hard, but don't make any
mistakes.  (I've used both methods.  Trust me, the GUI's easier!)

The use of LVs has been an option since Fedora 10, I think.  With
F12, it became the default, and you had to explicitly turn it off
if you didn't want to use it.  I'd resisted using it up to F12,
but finally decided to try it.  It works, I'm happy, and I doubt
that I'll go back to the old way.  Granted, it's fiddly-er to use
than standard partitioning, but it has its advantages.

Doesn't work in F13, eh?  Hmpf.  I'm going to upgrade to F14 here
soon.  Maybe it'll be working there.  OTOH, the GUI logical volume
manager does work, so maybe there's no hurry.

I _think_ there's an explanation in the Release Notes.  If not,
some of the other docs on the Fedora Project web site should have
the information you want.  <http://fedoraproject.org>

Anyway, you shouldn't have any trouble with the LV setup.  Hope
this helped.

May I also suggest NoScript.  It helps block ads, and also allows
you to block web sites that you don't want to connect to.  It's
quite amazing how many other web sites some of these pages connect
to.  And they connect to others, which connect to others...

I used option 2, which worked fine. The default size of the /boot
partition for new Fedora installs is now 500MB because of this issue.

It helped. Thank you.

I just looked at the GUI again. It has a button for Expand Volume
Group, and a button for Remove Selected Physical Volume(s), but there
appears to be no way to shrink a volume with the GUI.

I also checked in Yumex and found lvm2, already installed. You run it
from the command line with "lvm." I didn't take time to explore its man
page (assuming there is one). I'm guessing that it is the only way to
shrink a volume at this time.

Subject: [PLUG] Marine battery safety...
Message-ID: <1289116391.2591.79.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

I have APC SU1000NET smart UPSes on 3 servers plus 1 diskless server 
and an occasionally active server that is used for backup purposes.

I am not satisfied with the run time.  A half an hour or even a mere 5
minutes is not enough with most major power outages lasting 1 to 4
hours.  Typically, a squirrel flips the power company breaker or 
there is a snow related outage.  The service is fairly reliable, but
there are power outages.

There is natural gas service for backup heating, but generators 
are really expensive and with 200 amp service, I guess I would 
need a fairly large generator.

I have a deep cycle marine battery that I picked up, but I'm wondering
if I can even use it as these produce hydrogen gas when charging.  How
much gas and how much ventilation is needed to disperse that gas?  

I am after supplemental power so that my UPS'es will run longer.  So how
do I set up the AC circuit and what do I need to effectively keep the
batteries I pick up from being drained all the time and prematurely worn
out?  How do I set things up, I have an inverter, so that the inverter
kicks in and dumps power into the rest of the AC line 
(not the breaker box) during a power outage?

I understand with wet cell lead acid batteries that they can be
reconditioned. Sealed lead acid batteries are not repairable, 
at least without special equipment they aren't repairable.

How many batteries will be needed to provide 1-4 hours worth of power 
to four to six computers, one digital answering machine, and one
cordless phone?  Is a 600 watt peak inverter too small and should I buy
a bigger one or more of them?  If I go from one battery to more than
one, do I need a charger for each battery?

Essentially, I want to build a very simple UPS.  Charge batteries and
feed AC power to the rest of the circuit when the power is on.  When
there is a blackout, power the rest of the circuit (not the breaker
box please) using stored DC power and an inverter(s).  I don't care
about smart signal schemes, though I might need a micro controller of
some kind and I might run embedded Linux on it.  I estimate on a bad day
that a computer will consume about 300 watts and I have 4-6 of these at
any one time running on the circuit plus a cordless phone and a digital
answering machine.  A conservative estimate is that I need to provide
1920 to 2k watts for 1-4 hours.  That is most likely an overestimate
though.

Thoughts?

Just from my power need estimate, I figure that translates to four 600
watt inverters (not grid tie).  Additionally, four batteries will be
needed to feed those inverters at $80+ a piece.  I figure I can pick
up Cobra 600 watt inverters for around $69 a piece.  I already have one
marine wet cell battery and one 600 watt inverter.  I'm looking at about
$500 in additional batteries and inverters plus whatever it costs to
build the necessary circuity to make this all work.

A generator and a medium size UPS will provide longer run time at
less cost.

I have an electric start Generac 5500 watt generator that will run for
13 hours on five gallons of gas. At the first hint of snow I go to the
gas station and fill up four five gallon cans, plus the car. The car
holds another 18 gallons, which can be siphoned if necessary. That's
enough for three days.

To back up the computers I have a moderately heavy duty APC battery
UPS. It is sufficient to run the laptop for several hours, or both the
desktop and the laptop for half an hour. All the computer and
electronic stuff runs off it, including the router, cable modem and
even the stereo. 

If the power goes out I do nothing for 15 minutes because most power
outages are less than that. At 15 minutes I fire up the generator and
plug the APC into it. You don't want to run computers off a generator
(although I have done so), but the APC conditions the power. 

After several hours of power outage I run an additional 20 amp
extension cord off the generator through a hole in the garage wall into
the house. To this I connect the refrigerator, freezer, television and
half a dozen table lamps. Now the power can stay out for several days
and I'm still fine. 

The APC cost me $150 or so. The Generac cost me $450 used but almost
brand new. It's noisy, but has a good reputation for reliability. It
has a recoil starter in case its starter battery goes flat. It's way
overkill for the computers and electronics, but its additional capacity
is handy for other appliances during an extended outage. I have a gas
fireplace that heats the house and requires no electricity, but the
Generac also has enough to run a furnace if you need that. 

I don't need any fancy electronics or expensive devices to connect the
generator to the entrance panel. My backup system is completely off the
grid. When the power comes back on I shut down the generator and plug
everything back into the wall outlets.

You want to run 200 amp 120V service off of batteries? I hope you have
deep pockets! You would need a battery room the size of a good garage
to run that for any length of time. A large battery could be rated at
200 amp hours, so that would put out 200 amps for one hour. (Well, if
you were trying to drain it that fast it wouldn't last for an hour.
Those ratings are for a much lower drain at a time.) But that is only
at 12 or 6 volts. So if it is at 12 volts then divide it by 10 and
subtract off the losses for the inverter. So one battery might provide
something like 20 amp hours of service doing 120 V AC if you have a
very good inverter and have a bunch of batteries so the drain on each
one wasn't too much. And these are the BIG batteries that cost mucho
dollars. I did a quick search and found some that costed $400-600
dollars each. I have no idea if you can get them cheaper, but you
would need so many of them that you probably don't have room, even if
you had the money.

You're just not going to get around that trying to provide that much
power is not going to be cheap. You're talking about large amounts of
power. The generator that John is talking about that provides power
for all the basics to survive a power outage is only providing ~45
amps at 120V, assuming it can put out that peak power continuously and
everything is working well.

But really, if you need this kind of power and backup solutions then
you're going to need to pay for it. You should really be talking to an
expert in the field about what your realistic options are.

Fine, but I never said that I have to sustain 200 amps.  I only
mentioned that as a if a buy a generator do I have to push 200 
amps?  I am after backing up one 20 amp circuit.  Long term, I'm
thinking about a natural gas powered 8 KW generator.  That should
run 3 twenty amp circuits handily and almost a fully loaded 15 amp
light circuit as well.

Are marine batteries safe indoors?

How much ventilation is needed?

How do I figure out the amp hours of a particular marine battery?

It's considerably more complicated than that.

I have been googling and searching the Fedora forums. Most of what
Google turns up is in the Fedora forums, because apparently Fedora has
been in the cutting edge of implementing logical volume groups. There
are a lot of Fedora users trying to figure out how they work,
especially how to shrink one. The usual case is installing Fedora, then
later wanting to make a separate partition to install another OS into.

In addition to the Logical Volume Manager GUI that I found earlier, I
have discovered Palimpsest, which also comes with Fedora (in
Applications > System Tools > Disk Utility). It has more buttons, but
still no button for "shrink."

The process is not trivial. Apparently first you have to boot to Rescue
mode and make sure your root filesystem is not mounted. Right there I
am confused, because how can you boot without mounting and reading
the root filesystem? Then you use commands like lvm --pvresize and lvm
--lvresize, neither of which I understand. Another part of the problem
is that a default installation of Fedora does not create a separate
swap partition; instead swap is allocated somehow at the end of the
root partition. And the pvresize and lvresize cannot yet resize the root
partition when the swap is there, so the swap has to be moved out of
the way and then put back afterward. Or something like that. It's still
all very fuzzy to me.

I do suggest for anyone considering installing Fedora that you not
let Fedora use its default partition scheme:

1) Make the boot partition at least 1 GB for future needs. Current
    versions of Fedora set it to 500 MB, but I think that is still
    shortsighted.
2) Make your root filesystem (and /home if you want it on a separate
    partition) less than the remaining space on the disk so you won't
    have to shrink it later.
3) Volume groups can include multiple partitions which the OS sees as
    one disk. So split your disk into multiple smaller partitions and
    let Fedora stripe them into one volume group. Removing a
    partition from a volume group is trivial compared to having to
    shrink a partition.

I'll keep reading and perhaps eventually I'll get it all figured out.
Unfortunately, I'm starting from zero, because I don't understand what
terms mean like "extent" and "sector," among many others.

Even though I don't understand it all yet, the best Fedora post I have
found so far is:

Uh-huh.  There is a sound reason for that, too: it is reasonably easy to
implement growing a file system, but it is technically very, very difficult to
shrink one.  (Not impossible, just hard, *especially* if it is active at the
time.)

So, even if you could easily change the size of the LV or VG, the size of the
content still needs to be dealt with.

I would guess that they are using the "rescue mode" on the install CD, which
means that you are using the software installed and available on it, not the
stuff on your hard disk.

(This solves the "especially" part of my comment above. :)

A "PV" is a "Physical Volume", or an actual "low level" storage device used as
part of a volume group.  (A VG is a collection of physical volumes. :)

An "LV" is a "Logical Volume", which is where you throw things like
filesystems and the like.

.....you are better off thinking of LVs as "partitions", and the VG as "the
disk", rather than thinking of the VG as somehow being the "root partition".

Uh-huh.  LVM is basically an abstraction that behaves more or less like
traditional partitions on a traditional fixed disk, but with more
flexibility.  (Not in what we have talked about so for, but in things like
snapshots and the like...)

> I do suggest for anyone considering installing Fedora that you not

Actually, I would *strongly* encourage y'all to move to using LVM, which has a
whole lot of technical advantages.  Just think of the single partition on
disk, and the VG, as "the disk", and you will be in about the right mindset.

I concur.

With LVM it is usually a good idea to create small LVs, then grow them later,
because that is easy.  Then when you find that you should have made /home or /
bigger you can easily fix that without even needing a reboot.

The reverse, shrinking them, is hugely difficult and a PITA.  Just avoid it by
going the other way around.  (I use ~ 10GB each, unless I know ahead of time
that I need more storage capacity *right now*.)

Not really, it isn't: the process is literally identically complicated.  There
isn't any particular benefit to the approach you are suggesting.  Moving
allocated parts of a single PV is just as easy as moving stuff off a separate
PV would be.

FWIW, if you don't know the technical reasons for these decisions it is
probably better to trust that the distribution folks have good reasons for
their choices, in my experience.  They *have* done the research and understood
the most common technical reasons to do things these ways...

Well, if I may, his servers are running Linux.
And he wants to know a good way to keep them running if the power goes out.
Sounds On Topic to me, at least tangentially.

To OP: You definitely want to talk to some people with a lot of experience
in this field.
One good avenue to try is Amateur Radio Operators (aka Ham Radio).  Many of
them operate their gear completely off-grid, or at least able to be off-grid
when necessary.  Running Marine batteries you will need to put them in a
place that has a lot of ventilation, and preferably away from major
electronic equipment (in case of sparks etc).  As Richard is saying, setting
things up incorrectly could be a serious hazard, as you are dealing with
hydrogen gas.

I am a Ham Radio op myself but have limited experience with this kind of
thing, many others have been doing something like this for years.
One place to try is the Portland Amateur Radio Club, http://www.w7lt.org/
and also the Oregon Tualatin Valley Amateur Radio Club, of which I am a
member.  http://www.otvarc.org/
Check their contact info, send them an email, maybe someone will be able to
help.

Many Ham Radio ops use Linux (myself included)  :)

The purpose of a UPS is to provide power for a short period of time,
either for:

1) Hoping the glitch goes away within a minute, or
2) Safe shutdown, or
3) Starting a generator

I've done the deep discharge batteries trick, with a triplite
inverter charger designed for them.  I kept them in an unused
fireplace so they could vent hydrogen.  Didn't work very well,
the batteries were sulfated when I actually needed them.

Batteries do not store enough energy to last hours with kilowatt
loads.  Further, batteries wear out, and you should plan to
replace them every two years or so.  So get a generator and
find a safe place to store a couple days of gasoline for it.
It is easier to manage and lift and pay for gasoline than 
batteries for runtimes over 30 minutes or so.

I put all my critical computer circuits, along with refrigerators
and FIOS ONT and furnace motor, on a separate 50 amp breaker panel
with a manual transfer switch to a 30A/240V generator socket. 
When I get more money, that switch becomes a relay, and the
generator becomes "digital start", probably controlled by my
Alix firewall box (which runs Linux, making this on-topic). 

I hope to have all those controls, including generator start,
available over a secure web page.  Perhaps by that time, PGE
will offer some web-accessable way to estimate when the repair
crews are scheduled to appear.  Then I can pile on fiendish 
amounts of open source software to manage my powerless plight.

I've not had occasion to shrink an LV partition with the GUI tool,
so I'm afraid I hadn't really noticed that detail.  So you're
probably stuck using the command line for that project.

Hmm, I just looked at the LVM GUI tool, and it looks like you MIGHT be
able to shrink a partition.  In the left-hand pane, select the logical
volume you want to shrink.  At the bottom of the center pain, click on
"Edit Properties".  That will open up a window which, among other
things, lets you set the size of the volume.  I tried moving the
slider around, and the program didn't tell me I couldn't make the
volume smaller, so I assume (HA!) that you can.  Mind you, I didn't
try it; I just got done building that volume!  I DON'T KNOW IF
THIS WILL WORK CORRECTLY.  For all I know, it will simply shrink
the LV and blow your filesystem into itsy-bitsy flinders.  On the
other hand, it could work as well as GParted.  I don't know.

Lvm is actually a suite of tools, each with its own man page.
You've got a lot of reading to do.  :-)  They're not terribly
difficult to use, but it helps to write down the procedure ahead
of time.  At least it helped me when I built a volume group and
logical volumes from scratch.  (Hm, check out the fsadm(8)
command.  It looks like it should do pretty much what you want.  I
think.)

Just remember that when you shrink a partition or a logical
volume, you're actually shrinking two things: the partition, and
the filesystem that resides inside that partition.  The filesystem
will have to be shrunk FIRST, _BEFORE_ the partition can be
modified.  Otherwise, you WILL lose data.  Given the universe's
ironic sense of humour, it'll probably be the most valuable data
on the drive.  Best to run fsck on the filesystem before doing
anything else.  That and _BACK UP YOUR DATA!_  You never know what
might go worng.

Fair warning:  I once did shrink a standard partition and its
associated filesystem.  It was a MAJOR pain, and I never, ever,
want to go through that again.  This from the person who was crazy
enough to build a dual boot system for his very first Linux
experience.  (Window 3.1 and Red Hat 5.0.)  From scratch.  That
was easier, and easier on my nerves.  You Have Been Warned.

My perl is rpm installed, but it is custom compiled perl-5.12 and not

trick to bypass this issue?  I recompiled to use vim, vim now works like
a charm.  I'm trying to set up mailwatch as I want to do something
intelligent with the flood of mailscanner reports I'm getting from
quarantined messsages.  These mail programs seem well done, but I'm
having a hell of a time figuring out how to combine spamcannibal,
mailscanner, mailfilter, postfix, etcetera.  I haven't been able to make
spamcannibal for example tarpit anything yet.  Can I reprogram the rpm
database to treat the perl requirement as satisfied?  I apparently need
to install the perl modules DBD and DBD_mysql for mailwatch to work.
I could invoke cpan and try to do it that way, but I'd rather go the
cpan2rpm route if at all possible.

Hello All
I have copied thousands of files from one windows fileshare onto another
windows fileshare.
How can I easily verify that the file copy is correct?
I intentionally changed the directory structure between the source and
the destination.
I am trying to use md5sum on recursively through every file in every
directory between the two fileshares and then I would compare the sums
in a small database.

Question is:
How do I get md5sums recursively through a directory structure for ever
file using cygwin installed on my laptop?
Thanks for any help!
Dan

dunno if this works in cygwin, but it should get you started.

parsing the data into your database can be your own adventure :)

Something like:

  cd /top/of/tree1
  find -type f | xargs md5sum | sort > /tmp/tree1.md5sums
  cd /top/of/tree2
  find -type f | xargs md5sum | sort > /tmp/tree2.md5sums

  diff -u /tmp/tree1.md5sums /tmp/tree2.md5sums

perhaps?

Since the files are presumably Windows-related, more than likely there 
are some files with spaces in the filenames.  After punishing those 
responsible, you will want to tweak Russell's examples slightly.

find -type f | xargs md5sum
   becomes
find -type f -print0 | xargs -0 md5sum

Here's my $0.02 of input.

In my case it was bunch of image files (from scans and cameras) that 
kept getting uploaded or moved about on the SAMBA server.  I wanted to 
find any duplicates.
    I resorted to this Perl script

#!/usr/bin/perl

use Digest::MD5 qw(md5_hex);

my $file = $ARGV[0];

print STDERR $file . "\n";

my @ary = split( '/', $file);
my $filename = $ary[$#ary];
my $pathname = join('/', @ary[ 1 .. $#ary -1 ]);
open( FILE, $file );
binmode( FILE );
my $tmpchk = Digest::MD5->new->addfile( *FILE )->hexdigest;
close( FILE );

print join( "\t", $tmpchk, $filename, $pathname) ."\n";


Then sorted the output file and looked for two or more lines with the 
same md5sum.

I find that just upgrade seems to work in CPAN.

If you got it from the OS, they should be able to sort it out.  If you
hand-installed it, my strong preference is to repeat that install process
which will do things like ensure that dependencies are followed and found.

Current "best practice" is usually CPANPLUS, but that obviously means getting
CPANPLUS installed on the machine.

However, cpanminus is starting to take over in the popularity and performance
stakes for folks who have strongly Internet connected systems; it has some
plugins to do things like "show me outdated modules" and the like.

    https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus/tree/master/plugins

I use cpanm when I don't use the distribution tools.

        Daniel

   Rather self referential, eh? Use cpan to get cpanplus ... or cpanminus.

   I'll keep this for reference. I update perl modules only when some
application (such as building the most current spamassassin) requires them.
Otherwise, I ignore it.

Thanks, Daniel,

Any of 'em should work. :)  CPANPLUS has a reputation for being very heavy,
but it is (IIRC) in core with 5.10 or maybe 5.12, so that should get a bit
easier.

I would highly recommend grabbing cpanminus, then, and just using it for
that.  It really doesn't suck compared to the competition.[1]

Regards,
        Daniel

Footnotes: 
[1]  I didn't actually believe this for ages, and used both CPAN and CPANPLUS,
     but have now been converted. :)

rsync works on windows and it works by comparing the source and destination.

rsync -avn sourcedir destdir

The -n tells it not to change anything, the -v is verbose.  If the two are
identical you won't get any output.

You probably want '-c' to force a checksum based comparison, rather than just
date/time based.  The whole "windows" bit makes checks based around file
timestamps so much more unreliable and awful, sadly. :/

Subject: [PLUG] Projector in 86-01 at PSU
Message-ID: <20101109175327.68e909df@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Today I went to PSU on other business, but took my Thinkpad with Fedora
13 x86_64 with me. I wanted to see if I could get it to work with
the projector in the room where we hold the general meetings.

Before doing so I had installed the latest nVidia proprietary driver,
which comes with a GUI configuration tool. Using the GUI I was able to
get the projector displaying my screen (which runs at 1680 x 1050), but
the projector displayed only the top left 1024 x 768. That was with the
"Twinview" setting. Using the "Use Separate X Screen" setting I got it
to display my entire screen, albeit badly scrunched, but the screen on
my laptop went black.

Due to the nature of my upcoming presentation I need every pixel I can
coax out of the projector.

I have installed xrandr, but haven't figured it out yet. Google and the
man pages await me. I understand that it does not work with the nVidia
driver, so I'll have to go back to the nouveau driver. That is not a
problem - I've been using the nouveau driver for ages without the
slightest problem.

I know there are people here who have used the projector in that room
with their own computers. A couple questions for you:

1) Do you recall what resolution you got out of the projector?

2) How did you do it?

But how do I get rsync on a winddoze system?
Or are you speaking of using it via Cygqin?
Thanks!

Subject: [PLUG] Cheapest possible linux hardware?
Message-ID: <20101110043921.GK808@eehouse.org>

A friend and I had a crazy idea for a linux-based appliance that only
works if it can be an order of magnitude cheaper than the Soekris and
PCEngines boxes I'm used to tinkering with.  And so I went googling to
figure out just how low in the system-on-chip world I could go and
still run something close to vanilla linux.  And found nothing.

It must be that I don't know what search terms to use.  Does anybody
here?  That is, how do I figure out what the cheapest SOC is for which
I can build my own kernel and userspace stack?  Or does one even do
that in the embedded world?  Does one instead run something the SOC
vendor provides?  I think of myself as knowing "embedded linux"
because I work on a linux-based smartphone OS, but smartphone hardware
is a lot more capable than what I'm trying to research here.  Any
pointers to get me started?

Thanks,

--Eric

Generally the goal of selecting embedded hardware is to obtain the 
cheapest platform that offers reasonable performance in whatever domain 
you're working on. You seem to be approaching the problem in the reverse 
order.

What do you need the device to do? How small does it need to be? Are we 
talking about a handheld, battery-powered device or something that can 
run on AC power? Does it need to run video, display a user interface, or 
act as a headless web server, etc?

FWIW TI is releasing an extremely inexpensive board called the Panda 
Board. I think it's targeted around $100 or so (likely in volume), and 
uses modern ARM (v7) hardware.

The tiniest, most inexpensive Linux-based devices I know of are "smart" 
ethernet ports, which often only offer a tiny embedded webserver an 
miniscule amounts of flash memory. Useful when tied to a sensors in data 
acquisition situations.

My apologies for the unusual grammar above. I'm tired and/or becoming

Then there is the DockStar and the BeagleBoard.  As a party trick at
DorkBotPDX two weeks ago, we managed to get an ARM Ubuntu to install
on a version of the Beagle board.  We had a monitor and keyboard
connected and it was painfully slow (as well it should be).

The Dockstar is around $30.  

At Personal Telco, we run linux on 200MHz MIPS-based processors (on
access-point boards).  Those sold at retail for on the order of
$40-$70, so you can project backwards to get a guess at how much they
cost to produce.  Fon was giving them away at 6 euros each a couple
years ago.

You can get rsync on Windows using any of the "Services for UNIX", Cygwin, or
MSYS solutions.  Theoretically, I think, you could also natively compile it
since it is fairly POSIX-portable, but I don't know anyone who did.

I would personally recommend SFU as your first stop, then MSYS, then finally
Cygwin, but YMMV.

Given you were posting to a Linux list, though, I imagine most people

I don't think rsync will do what you want. It expects the files on the
two systems to be in the identical directory structure.

It really depends on what you want to do with it.
There are devices that you can experiment with that will run linux
without too much problem
Look at the two different project out there.
openwrt (dd-wrt)
nslu2-linux

Both of these work on hardware that you can get for less than $100.
The Fry's Wireless N router (and the d-link equivalent) is listed on
the dd-wrt database.

Now if you want to build your own embedded system; the development
boards are normally
an order of magnitude more.  The development boards are a pre-cursor
to the real hardware
that will be built.

Also a couple websites for hardware.

One of the cheapest is probably the ubiquiti bullet, under $40 including 
built-in wireless, ethernet, and serial data port. Downloadable SDK too.

Subject: [PLUG] Finding Expert X Window System Help
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1011100540490.5827@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have an exceptionally bothersome issue that appeared only a few weeks
ago after a distribution upgrade followed immediately by hardware failures.
Despite a totally new hardware system and a clean installation of the most
recent distribution version the problem persists. I need to communicate with
someone intimately familiar with X but have not identified an appropriate
mail list, Usenet group, or Web-based forum.

   If I recall correctly, we have at least one such expert as a member of our
group and I would appreciate a dialog that might guide me to the source of
the problem and its resolution.

   The problem is that the ability to paste blocked text suddenly stops.
Doesn't matter whether this is within a single virtual console or
application or across windows. The source text remains highlighted but it
will not paste when both mouse buttons are pressed simultaneously. Killing
the X server and restarting it usually fixes the problem for a time. The
time between failures is highly variable. The failure happens with my
regular Logitech trackball and with a USB-connected mouse.

   The distribution version is Slackware-13.1 with xfce-4.6.1-i486-8 and
xorg-server-1.7.7-i486-2_slack13.1. I will provide additional information
as needed.

   Turns out the brand new unit is defective. The first page in "Quick Setup"
sets the local time zone. Clicking the "OK" button does nothing, even after
15 minutes. I'll contact Newegg about this.

You can get rsync on Windows using any of the "Services for UNIX", Cygwin, or MSYS solutions.  Theoretically, I think, you could also natively compile it since it is fairly POSIX-portable, but I don't know anyone who did.

I would personally recommend SFU as your first stop, then MSYS, then finally Cygwin, but YMMV.

You definitely want to put SFU (Services for UNIX) on the Windoze boxes 
and provide NFS file shares back to Linux. If at all possible, upgrade 
your Windows machines to Server 2008.  We have experimented with SFU and 
found the NFS performance to be quite good.  The alternative is samba 
client on the Linux box, which is a pain.  Rule of thumb, in a 
heterogeneous environment, provide the native protocols that the client 
machine supports.

out of curiosity, how well did that stuff work on earlier windows?
does it work on non-server machines (say, xp pro and vista ultimate)?
i'm conslutting in a mixed environment where that's what's available,
so the question isn't quite idle.

i find typing 'aptitude install samba-client' (or similar) and
'smbmount \\\\192.168.1.20\\sharename /mnt -o user=username' to be
easier than doing anything to/with windows...i also know that my unix
tools work fine on those file shares (and it sounds like they would on
the SFU NFS export too).  while i agree that the crazy number of
backslashes aren't intuitive, well, the OP knows about them by this
example so now it's known & easy anyhow.

also, how good is the performance?  i have a machine that can serve
over 1000mbit via ftp or nfs (using jumbo frames on a channel-bonded
4x1000mbit nic).  samba on the same machine serves at significantly
slower rates, peaking around 300mbit.  (tested from a linux client.
performance not quite as good to/from a windows client).  so i am not
trying to argue that samba works better on the network--i'm curious to
hear some numbers on similar hardware (no way to test windows on this
box, not with the raid arrays formatted xfs).

my rule of thumb is "don't do anything with windows you can more
easily do with linux" =)  but easy is all in the eye of the beholder.

Wayne,

   I've been using Slackware since -8.0 and this is the first time it's ever
happened. And, I've never had a pointing device with three buttons, only
two.

Thanks for the thought,

I have seen this problem, but it may not the source of your problem.
With older Slackware distributions I have noticed that if you ever once 
use the middle mouse button, the dual button paste no longer works, you 
have to use the middle button thereafter. Try it.

I'm not an X expert, but a few questons:
1. Does it work the same with the middle button on a 3-button (or scroll)
   mouse and Emulate3Buttons disabled?
2. Does a commandline clipboard util (e.g. uclip or xsel) show the selected
   contents?  I.e. is the "copy" operation or the "paste" operation failing?
   Similarly, if you use uclip/xsel to copy data, does it paste OK?
3. Can you replicate the behaviour on any other version of the X package,
   on another distro, or on a Slackware live CD?
4. Does it matter if GPM is running?
5. Does switching to a text console (Ctrl-Alt-F1) and switching back
   (Alt-F7 or so) change anything?
6. Is GrabDevice enabled or disabled?
7. Does this link have any bearing?

To be more precise, you want a Linux box for under $20?
That's a tight budget that calls for specific requirements.

You can build an ARM board for that, in quantity, but you'll need to
prototype on more expensive hardware, such as Gumstix or BeagleBoard.

Questions:
1. What hardware features do you need to get the immediate job done?
2. What software/OS features are driving the Linux requirement?
   If you can go simpler, you get much cheaper hardware.

I've always been amazed that vendors build full VoIP phones (codecs, IP
stack and all) based on the old 8051 8-bit uC.

Subject: [PLUG] Poorer video performance on Ubuntu 10.04 than 8.04
Message-ID: <4CDAF954.5080501@comcast.net>

I recently did a fresh install of Ubuntu 10.04 on my desktop machine. To 
test performance I ran Foobilliard. The balls moved in a jerky fashion. 
I installed the nVidia driver and Foobilliard works as smoothly as it 
did when I ran it on 8.04. Another test is http://www.jigzone.com. A few 
months ago it stopped working altogether on Firefox and Ubuntu 8.04. It 
now runs, but dragging the jig saw puzzle pieces is not smooth. It is 
smooth on my XP laptop running the same version of Firefox (version 3.6.12).

I'm assuming there is something different between 10.04 and 8.04 that is 
causing the problem, but have no idea where to start looking. Here are 
the specs for the two machines as reported by Ubuntu System Monitor and 
XP System Properties:

                     Desktop                            Acer Aspire 
1640Z Laptop
Processor    AMD Athlon XP 2100+    Intel Pentium(R)M 1.70GHz
Memory       1002.4 MiB                      0.99 GB of RAM
Video            GeForce2 MX/MX 400    Mobile Intel 915GM/GMS, 910GML 
Express Chipset Family

Any ideas where to look? Or is this a case of 10.04 pushing the limits 
of, what is now, an "older" machine?

I'd put my money on the video driver. For nVidia Ubuntu (like most
distros) has switched from the old "nv" driver to the "nouveau" driver
as their open source driver of choice. When Ubuntu 10.04 was new the
nouveau driver still had issues, and I recall reading a lot of
complaints about speed.

I would see if I could get the latest version of the nouveau driver as
my first course of action. If that doesn't help, try the nVidia
proprietary driver. If you have enabled the Medibuntu repository the
nVidia driver should be available in Synaptic or apt-get.

Thanks. I'll look into the nouveau driver. I have the nVidea driver 
installed already:

     NVIDIA Driver Version: 96.43.14

I did that at the recommendation of the OS. At some point it recommended 
installing the nVidia driver, and I accepted the invitation.

I didn't mention it this time, but I did turn off the eye candy stuff:

     System:Preferences:Appearance:Visual Effects -- set to "None" which 
also helped the performance of                                         
                                                                         
         Foobilliard.

I just installed the nVidia driver a couple days ago in an attempt to
get my computer working with the projector in the PSU room where we
have our general meetings. It was in the Fedora rpmfusion repository,
and the version in the repository was the same as the latest version at
nVidia's website. It is version 260.19.12. 

Yours seems a lot of versions older. But maybe there are different
numbering schemes for different versions of the driver. E.g., mine is
running an Quadro NVS 140M. Wouldn't hurt to check for the latest
version, though.

That seems odd. In my experience Ubuntu doesn't even enable the
non-open source repositories by default. Oh wait ... you have to
install the nVidia driver if you want the desktop effects. That is
probably when the OS "recommended" the nVidia driver.

This is probably the Nvidia Legacy driver version, and that is why the
numbering is different.
His graphics card is quite old, Geforce 2 MX.  A Quadro NVS 140M is more
recent.
In this case, the latest version of the driver wouldn't work on that older
card.

OP mentioned turning off the eye candy, that should help, especially on
older hardware.

Have you tried using one of the more lightweight window mangler
environments?  (XFCE, LXDE, Blackbox etc)

Yes: 0.9 metadata has a limit of 28 devices, while 1.* scale to "hundreds"
without a specifically specified limitation.

1.* metadata is much harder to boot from successfully.

Subject: [PLUG] Upgrade SiI SATA RAID controller -- sans floppy drive
Message-ID: <4CDB7E42.2000209@cyber-office.net>

I need to upgrade a Silicon Images 3114 SATA RAID controller so I can 
boot from it. (Configured as JBOD, no RAID)
    Problem is the system doesn't have a floppy drive and Silicon Images 
only provides a DOS and Windows method to upgrade the controller BIOS. 
I think I have a floppy drive rat-holed somewhere but give me a break; 
it's 2010.

I tried Hiren's BootCD (found a reference to using it because the poster 
had the same problem I do -- Linux can't/won't boot from an attached 
drive) but that didn't work.  Went away for very long time just trying 
to test the hardware.  I got ticked off and canceled it.
    Getting to the DOS option was a joke.

Any suggestions or other "Rescue CD" that would run either a DOS or 
Windows flasher?


TIA,
Rod

weird question--i got paid to search for a solution for two hours today.

what i came up with was this:

http://derek.chezmarcotte.ca/?p=188

his boot img (a bargain at 97k gzipped) has 36MByte of room for your
flash util+files (but beware, this image has 0 dos utils, including
echo/rename).

i made it work to update a really recalcitrant supermicro motherboard
and there was much rejoicing.  i had to do the renames manually but
that wasn't tough.

I made a bootable USB stick with FreeDOS to flash a BIOS once. You can
get FreeDOS here:

Lucky you.  This was for a personal system.  :-(

It seems Silicon Images needs to address the non-floppy 
drive/non-Windows world.
   I spent two hours trying to figure out if it was something I did 
during the OS (MythDora) install or a bad card.  Then another 2-ish 
hours searching for a solution followed by several attempts to find and 
download a Hiren's BootCD iso.

Excellent!  I'll go sorting through my "I can't justify throwing this 
old technology away" box for a smaller USB stick.  Heck it looks so 
useful I might just buy new and keep it in the tool kit.

Renames?  Something to lookout for?

Thanks.  Chris' solution uses FreeDOS also.

Guess I need to look at that project again.

like i said above--this is a kind of crippled image.  if you know what
you need to do you're fine, but it lacks even the 'copy con' ability
to print a text file, much less run rename (ren).

my bios update was a batch file that literally renamed a .sys file to
a .exe and ran it with some flags, but the 'ren' command wasn't found
and i couldn't read the batch file on the machine to figure out what
went wrong...

while there are other freedos images that have more commands, i could
not find one larger than 2.44MByte that i could modify usefully.  i
was probably just doing it wrong, but after a few rounds of unetbootin
and downloading i decided to just ask the lazyweb and found someone
who could help.  (actually lots of someones, but all of the other
instructions i could find needed legacy grub that i was unwilling to
install, since it wanted to remove the new grub to do so!)

This is probably a bit out of date, but this old discussion might be 
useful.

Well I feel lucky.  I got a UPDFLASH.EXE and a b5500.bin. -- nothing 
fancy.  I did convert the lowercase letters to uppercase booted and 
updated the BIOS.  Slick!  I can now boot the system from the SATA drives.

Again thanks.

Yup there it was.  Right in my Save->PLUG->2006 IMAP folder.  Too bad I 
didn't think to search before I asked. :-)

Subject: [PLUG] Need Help with Apache AllowOverride
Message-ID: <AANLkTimyuHPqVPFiEbi68N6FtT8MgAhP+wdpVS1WN2Jk@mail.gmail.com>

I have a web server at webIP off site. I have a second server for photos
running a php photo gallery app behind apache at photoIP on my local LAN. I
have a page on the web server that uses iframes to the photo server's
images.

I am trying to restrice access to the photo server to requests from the web
server using apache Allowoverride on the photo server. Here is what I have:

<VirtualHost photoIP:8080>

        DocumentRoot /var/www/gallery

        <Directory />
                Options FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride None
        </Directory>

        <Directory /var/www/gallery>
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride All FileInfo Options
                Order allow,deny
                Deny from all
                # internal access
                Allow from 192.168.25.0/24
                Allow from 127
                # Web server
                Allow from webIP
        </Directory>

        ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/hammerhead/
error.log

        # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
        # alert, emerg.
        LogLevel debug

        CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log combined

</VirtualHost>

I can access the photos from a machine on my local LAN, but not from hosts
off my LAN. The only way to get it to work is to change Deny from all to
Allow from all. What am I doing wrong?

Thanks!

You're embedding the photos in the pages on WebIP?  Then the photos are
being accessed from the client's browser, not WebIP.  In that case, you'll
want to limit access by referrer.  (Note: Apache spells it "referer", with
one r.)  People will still be able to grab your pictures, of course, but
they won't be able to embed them from your server into their own pages.

No. The photos are served by a php program called gallery within a iframe on
the web server.

It might be easier to ignore the web server in my problem and just think of
the problem as apache configuration for a php app.

Sorry, I didn't write clearly.
You're embedding references to photos on PhotoIP in the pages (as iframes)
on WebIP, then?  Or is WebIP acting as a proxy for the photos?

Sort of.  On PhotoIP, you'll want to permit access for any IP, if the
Referer is WebIP.  There's an example at the bottom of
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/env.html

I just fixed a similar problem on my roommate's maverick system.  For some

lsusb mentions this device, and lsmod seems to indicate that usb_storage is 
loaded.

A Lexar keychain drive is immediately recognized and mounted. It could be that 
the other one is just not automounted. How would I check this (it's been so long 
since I had to mount such a device manually that I forgot how to do it)?

I could solve the immediate problem by using Windows to copy the files from the 
smaller drive that is not recognized by Maverick to the larger one that is.

well, if 'dmesg' indicates that it sees a scsi drive, you can find out
what its partition table is with 'fdisk -l' and then mount whatever
partition exists (probably sdX1 for some alphabetical value of X) as:

mount /dev/sdXY /mnt

if dmesg doesn't spit out a bunch of stuff about how it found a new
mass storage device and assigned it a drive letter, something deeper
is wrong and posting the output here is going to be necessary for
further troubleshooting.

It is recognized as /dev/sdc1 and can be mounted and accessed with

mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt

There is no icon for it on the desktop, unlike the case of other removable 
devices.

I found another problem by doing this that should really be a new topic. It 
doesn't seem to play too nice with FreeBSD:

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sdb1   *       48693      121602   585646299   a5  FreeBSD
Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary.
/dev/sdb2           14650       48692   273437697    5  Extended
Partition 2 does not end on cylinder boundary.
/dev/sdb5           14650       15258     4882432   82  Linux swap / Solaris
/dev/sdb6           15258       18298    24413184   83  Linux
/dev/sdb7           18298       48692   244140032   83  Linux

Partition table entries are not in disk order

For that reason, for example, Clonezilla doesn't want to save partitions on this 
drive. Comments on that subject would be welcome too.

You might want to look at  the Request Policy add-on for firefox
https://www.requestpolicy.com/

It blocks cross-site requests by default. This will break a lot of sites
at first since many host their CSS/images on another domain but
white-listing just the ones you want is easy enough, It works in a
similar way to no-script, so if you are familiar with this you will know
the score.

I consider it an essential addition to NoScript + AdBlockPlus.

I appreciate all the information on controlling the browser connections.

Unfortunately I am still getting the "domain.not.configured" connects.

I would urge all readers to take a look while they are browing and see 
if this is occuring.

Has anyone successfully built Linux from scratch on a Fedora Core 1

gcc-4.4.3 to compile.  If anyone wonders why I am trying to compile LFS
on a Fedora Core 1 system, I am trying to build on an AMD K6-2 500
system.  Go too recent in the Fedora line, this processor isn't
supported.  As it is, the system is quite slow.  I have Fedora Core 3
and Fedora Core 5, but I wonder if they will be too slow let alone new
enough to make this work?

Can I cheat somehow and compile a compatible system on a quad core
system?

As I recall (not 100%, please correct if wrong) a K6-2 is Pentium II class. 

As such, it's better than a Pentium Pro, which is the processor needed for Fedora.

So... As I understand it, the processor you are using is supported. 

YMMV.

Hey folks!

I'm running Fedora Core 13 in VMware Workstation and I'm having a little bit
of networking trouble.

I've added a second adapter named eth1 to a dhcp server however it fails to
receive an ip address on boot.  The boot.log shows "Determining IP
information for eth1...failed."   After booting the machine I run ifconfig
and see only my eth0 adapter.  At this point I can do ifconfig eth1 up then
stop and restart networking to bring up the eth1 adapter and give it an IP
address however this is not an ideal situation.  I'd much rather have both
adapters be addressed properly at boot.

Below is a copy of the config scripts for each interface.  Any help spared
is much appreciated!

So as I understand it, you're manually addressing eth1 to establish ip
connectivity on that interface? If that's true what happens when you try to
bring up eth1 via DHCP after the machine has booted and eth0 has ip
connectivity?

Also, do eth0 and eth1 both have ip addresses on the same subnet as your
dhcp server? I wonder what would happen if you bring up eth0 via dhcp 1st
and then have the static ip addr on eth1.

Complain to your distribution vendor?  I recently (about a month or

was fixed almost right away.

   Will do, Russell. My Google searches turned up many instances in the
ubuntus, fedoras, and slackwares. It's apparently related to moving the
video modes for Intel chips into the kernel with KMS. The combination
apparently has many issues.

   Further searching suggests that the stock kernels (which is what Pat uses
in Slackware) do not have KMS set by default. Tomorrow morning I'll rebuild
2.6.36 with KMS set and see if that makes a difference.

You could download an Ubuntu CD, boot it in live mode (i.e. without
installing it) and see if it has the same problem.

*psst!*  It's just Fedora 13 now; they dropped the "Core" part a

From this I gather that you are installing the NIC "manually,"
using the old standard tools.  Since Fedora runs NetworkManager
by default, try entering the interface in NM, instead.  NM does
not use the standard locations for storing its information about
the interfaces.  (Why, I don't know.  Perversity, perhaps.)

I will jump in.
I am basing this on VirtualBox, which may be different from VMWare.

Have you configured the settings in the VMWare instance for a second NIC?

I know at least in VirtualBox, you need to configure the settings for the
NIC(s) you have, so the guest OS can "see" the virtual hardware.
If you install the guest OS and have only 1 NIC configured in the settings,
then later decide to add a 2nd NIC, you would have to update the VM
configuration settings and reboot the guest OS.

I've used Hugin a few times with moderate-to-acceptable results, but
I'm also not a photo manipulation guru.

Here's one example:

http://picasaweb.google.com/creswick/EnchantmentsHike#5381519732127053282

If you look closely at the little rock islands on the lower-right,
you'll notice some funky cyan pixels in there -- that is an artifact
of the processing, not some crazy algae :(.  I *think* the problem is
that all the images were using 16-bit color and with the combination
of two images with different exposure settings that wasn't sufficient
to represent all the colors needed during (and maybe after) the merge.
 I don't know of a good way to get around this with linux, if that is
indeed the problem.  Maybe Gimp's GEGL support is mature enough to
handle 32-bit images these days (last I checked you had to specially
enable that during the compilation though, so I have doubts it's ready
for mainstream use).

Hugin is definitely worth trying though :).

All

I am having a simple problem in Gmail..

Tab Completion stopped working.

For example in the To: box if I type a letter, any letter, Gmail used
to immediately try to finish the address for me.

Now nothing happens and I have to type in every address I want to email to..

I can't find any setting and I have googled and just find my own
question out there.

Anyone have any ideas.

I am sure this is a Gmail thing.

I suspect is would be useless to email Gmail..

TIA

Well, you could check by running Gmail from a different browser.

So, that would be a client-side JavaScript based feature.  So:

Does this happen with a clean profile for your current browser?
Does this happen with an alternative browser?  (eg: Chrome if you use Firefox,
or whatever)

My guess is that you installed something (GreaseMonkey?  NoScript?  Ad
blocking sofware?  A filtering proxy?) that is breaking the completion process
and all - or perhaps frobbed some configuration setting.

> I am sure this is a Gmail thing.

Really?  Personally, I think this is like the occasional thing that happens
where someone comes along and claims that the Linux kernel must be
fundamentally broken because their code isn't working:

If it was really broken for something so widely used you wouldn't have *any*
trouble finding out about it.  The Internet would be *full* of people
complaining that GMail was broken like that - so that says it is something
about your client-side configuration.  To me.

> I suspect is would be useless to email Gmail..

Well, you get what support you pay for.  OTOH, their support forums do have
staff watching them, so it won't /hurt/ to put in the request there.

I installed Chrome and it works the same way...  Broke..

I have not installed any additional software.  In fact I just
installed a new copy of Ubuntu 10.4.

I've had OK results with Hugin.
The most pleasant software I've used is Autopano (now commercial SW).

Now if only they'd sell photo-printer paper by the roll...

I used the assistant to generate three panoramas from 3 or 4 shots.  I am
quite pleased with the results.  It is clear from the review and the
tutorials that I need to spend more time in understanding how to use the
program for more custom results and more exotic tasks, but this is a big
step up from what I had used before.  (Synaptic provided Version
2009.2.0.4461.  Even so, I am impressed.)

Subject: [PLUG] Fedora, K6-2, and LFS...
Message-ID: <1289867388.1326.12.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

A few issues to mention:

1: Linux From Scratch compiles take a long time on a K6-2.

2: Fedora Core 3 is apparently too old to compile binutils-2.20 where I 
   notice that the 2.6.9 kernel is used.

3: At some point in the Fedora series, the K6-2 CMOV instruction is no 
   longer supported.  This missing instruction is why Centos 5.x is not 
   an option.  Can I get high enough kernel wise before the CMOV
   instruction was dropped for LFS 6.6 to work?

4: Is there a way to get compiles to optimize for a K6-2 without 
   compiling on a K6-2?  I have a quad core AMD Phenom II handy.

The highest ancient version of Fedora I have handy is Fedora Core 5.
Beyond that, I have Fedora 9 and Fedora 12.  I don't have Fedora 7
and Fedora 11.  I try to keep the odd numbered Fedoras handy.

Yes, just set it in make menuconfig

  ? Symbol: MK6 [=n]
  ? Prompt: K6/K6-II/K6-III

Short answer: Yes.  Somewhat longer answer:  Cross-compilation is
a capability of the kernel Makefile, but I'm uncertain as to the
details.  I've never had occasion to do any cross-compiles.

Fedora 11 looks like the last release that supported the i586 and
lower processors.  That said, you should be able to take the
source to the current F14 kernel and recompile.  The config
entries are there for CMOV and i586.  For that matter, a plain
vanilla kernel has the same config entries.

Hi Cooper,

    I am the closing staff member at Free Geek tonight and I was told 
that PLUG does not have a keyholder to close up when they leave.
    Unfortunately, if that is the case we are unable to provide a 
meeting space tonight, as it costs Free Geek to pay overtime, etc.

Sorry for the inconvenience. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,

I think I didn't make something clear.

Unless Michael has been approved for a key and will be there tonight,
there will be no one there with a key. And it's not just a key; the
keyholder must also be given a code and instructed on how to use it to
arm the burglar alarm when the group leaves.

The meeting starts at 7:00 and Fee Geek is open until 7:00, so the
building will be open at the start of the meeting. But all the Free
Geek people go home shortly thereafter, so without a PLUG member who is
a keyholder it will not be possible to lock the place up at the end of
the meeting.

Subject: [PLUG] Xrandr
Message-ID: <20101117161405.76417cd4@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I'm still trying to figure out how to get my laptop screen to appear on
a projector. I've been googling and reading the man page for xrandr,
but I don't understand much of it. My laptop screen runs at 1680 x 1050
with the nouveau driver, and I think the max that most projectors do is
1280 x 1050. 

If someone has used xrandr to get a laptop screen to display on a
projector at the same time, it would help if you would share the
command(s) you use. 

Oh, and I have xrandr 1.3 on Fedora 13. The following is the output of
xrandr -q (or xrandr --current):

Screen 0: minimum 800 x 600, current 1680 x 1050, maximum 1680 x 1050
default connected 1680x1050+0+0 0mm x 0mm
   1680x1050       0.0* 
   1280x1024      61.0  
   1280x800        0.0  
   1024x768       61.0  
   800x600        61.0  

I'm going to Portland State tomorrow to see if I can find a classroom
with a projector that is open and not in use. Or maybe I can use the
multimedia test room in the library. Hopefully I can take some time to
experiment until I get it right. 

Thanks in advance for suggestions and advice.

I slipped over to newegg.com to check and is seems that some projectors 
can't do what you are asking ... can the one you are trying to use do 
it?  ... or have you already checked that?

Indeed. One of the things that I failed to do last time I was in 86-01
was to jot down the make and model of the projector. All I remember is
that it is a Hitachi. However, one of the Help staff told me he thought
it would do 1280 x 1024. Perhaps I can verify the make and model
tomorrow. Knowing what it is capable of would be a plus.

There is nothing special about testing it with a projector. You could just
test it with any external monitor as long as it can handle the same
resolution you will be using with the projector.

All,

I'm starting to do some investigation of PLCs for a project involving
marine (ship) management. I was wondering if anyone was familiar with
any linux applications that collect data from PLCs. Would the
applications have to be built to the specific PLC? Are there any "cross
platform" applciations that can read from different PLC backends?

thanks,

That is why I wish I knew what the projector in 86-01 is capable of.
But even if I knew, at home I have only the monitor on my laptop. And
what if the video chip in the laptop can drive my laptop monitor at
1680 x 1050, but does not have sufficient poop to drive an external
monitor at greater than a certain (lesser) resolution at the same time? 

There is no substitute for in situ testing, especially considering that
the documentation for xrandr is pathetic.

In most cases now, you can plug in an external display device and then
run 'xrandr' to see the list of supported resolutions for all
connected devices, whether they are displaying or not.  Then it's just
a matter of knowing the xrandr command line voodoo:

I use something like this:

$ xrandr --output LVDS --mode 1280x800 --output VGA --mode 1024x768

although,

$ xrandr --auto

usually works well enough.

If you want to mirror the same thing on both displays, then you need
the --same-as <device name> flag, and you need to specify modes that
both devices support. eg:

$ xrandr --output LVDS --mode 1024x768 --output VGA --mode 1024x768
--same-as LVDS

Message-ID: <20101118082456.403b4dc9@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Just in case you haven't been paying attention to the calendar, the
famous PLUG Linux Clinic is this Sunday, November 21, at Free Geek
at 1741 SE 10th Avenue, Portland from 1 ? 5 PM.

Bring your computer with Linux issues. Bring your <other OS> computer
and we'll install Linux for you. We have monitors, keyboards, mice and
cables, so all you need to bring is the box. Or just come and look over
shoulders to see what Linux is all about. 

And if you're an expert with Linux, we need you too. The Clinic is a
good way to learn how to support desktop Linux.

We have all major distros and variations thereof. We also have coffee,
cookies, and other edibles. And most important, we have fun.

Sounds interesting.
It sounds like your best bet is to use Modbus over serial or ethernet.
There's a lot of OSS Modbus stuff.
http://libmodbus.org/documentation/
http://qmodbus.sourceforge.net/
http://mblogic.sourceforge.net/mbapps/apps.html

Also: http://www.beremiz.org/

I took some A-B PLC classes a few years ago, but never got to use it.
All the OSS A-B stuff fell off the net.

Message-ID: <20101118211241.6abad8c5@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I currently have roughly 10 hours invested in trying to get my Thinkpad
with nVidia video to work with projectors at PSU. That's about six
hours on campus and the rest of the time at home researching the
nouveau driver, xrandr, and the nVidia proprietary driver, installing
and uninstalling each. It also involves several man-hours of time spent
by PSU support staff, not that most were very useful:

"What version of Windows do you have?"
"Windows is not installed on this computer."
"But it's not a Mac ..."
"It runs Fedora 13."
"What's a Fedora 13?"

Eventually I usually did find a support person who knew Linux, but even
then they knew nothing of the nouveau driver, and little about xrandr. 

I did discover that the projector in FAB 86-01 is a Hitachi CPXCO5,
although the O may be a zero. Unfortunately Hitachi and Google are
unable to find that model. Without technical specs there is no way to
tell what resolution(s) it is capable of. 

Not that projector matters much. Using the nouveau driver I can't even
see it; xrandr -q just shows the laptop screen. Using the nVidia driver
I can see it, but I can't get it to display anything.

I asked here if anyone who has successfully used the projector in FAB
86-01 could share how they did it, but there have been no responses.

It's time to throw in the towel.

I'm very sad to hear that.
It's not much help at this point, but I've had great luck with Ubuntu and
external monitors/projectors on my laptops.

I suspect you'll just have to throw your slides on a thumbdrive and borrow
another laptop that does work OK.

I'd try to tinker with it at the Clinic, but I can't come because Beloved
Wife wants us to clean house before Thanksgiving.

First, I am currently back at PSU and I took a second look at the model
number. It is CP-X605:

http://www.projectorcentral.com/Hitachi-CP-X605.htm

Yesterday I was using the nouveau driver and it could not even see the
projector. It was as though the cable was not connected. I tried to
install the nVidia driver, but was having difficulties logging in to
the wireless. Without net access I couldn't download or install
anything.

Last night at home I reinstalled the nVidia driver. Now, at PSU, I am
able to see the projector using the nVidia Settings utility. And the
screen from the projector no longer says "no input detected." However,
it remains black. I've tried a zillion settings in the nVidia Settings
utility, but nothing gets it to display my screen on the wall.
Unfortunately, there are many, many options, and the possible
permutations of settings is in the millions. And the nVidia Help file
is useless: "Xinerama - check this box to enable Xinerama."

I note from the technical information about the CP-X605 that its
maximum resolution is 1600x1200. When the nVidia Settings utility finds
it, all it shows is its native resolution, 1024x768. And, although I
can move the projector display screen all around, and even on top of my
laptop screen, it looks as though all it will do is project 1024x768 of
my 1680x1050 screen, assuming that eventually I hit on the secret to
getting it to display anything at all.

>I suspect you'll just have to throw your slides on a thumbdrive and
>borrow another laptop that does work OK.

I thought of that possibility, but the person would need to have
installed many packages and fonts. It's possible, but not trivial.

>I'd try to tinker with it at the Clinic, but I can't come because
>Beloved Wife wants us to clean house before Thanksgiving.

I plan to tinker with it some more at the Clinic. But at this point it
looks doubtful that it can be made to work.

Sometimes a hard reboot with the projector connected and on will help. I
don't have any advice about your settings though because the last time I
used a projector you just went into xorg.conf and typed in some magic, there
were no fancy tools like xrandr to add to the confusion of what needed to be
done.

Not sure about this, but I believe I read somewhere that dual display 
(or something like that) has to be enable in BIOS to have the same image

I will endeavor (remind me Sunday morning) to bring my projector to
the Clinic, and we will debug this summich.  However, that will put
two normally-helps-others folks offline.  Could you (yes, you the
intelligent and helpful person reading this) show up and help us
help others?

I imagine John's Thinkpad will need some tweaking, perhaps even 
some driver compiling, but if we miraculously succeed early, we
can try a few other laptops on the projector.

I was thinking of asking Keith to bring his projector, so I'm glad to
hear he will do so. 

Another point: I was still wrong about the projector in FAB 86-01. But
now I am positive because I got someone from the Doghouse use his key
to let me in the room. It is a Hitachi CP-SX1350:

http://www.projectorcentral.com/Hitachi-CP-SX1350.htm

<By the way, there is a used one for sale on eBay for $418 with free
shipping. The price for a new one online is around $3,700. Yikes!>

And I note that its native resolution is 1400x1050. The one I was
testing with in an open classroom had a native resolution of 1024x768,
although both are listed as having a maximum resolution of 1600x1200.

All those resolutions are odd numbers compared to what we are
accustomed to on computer screens. Several people have told me that the
projector will sense what the computer is sending it and sync to it if
it is within the projector's range. My laptop normally runs at
1680x1050, so I tried setting its resolution down to 1280x1024 to test
it. Didn't work. 

Someone else said xrandr will work with some of the nVidia drivers and
can be used to change the resolution on the projector. I tried that as
well, as root. The commands I tried all executed without error, but
made no difference in the projector's resolution.

Here's an off the wall suggestion for the projector problem:

Connect a known to work laptop to the projector.

Connect John's laptop to the working laptop with a network cable.

Configure with a static IP on both ends.

ssh -X from the working laptop to John's laptop.

Run desired application(s).

What if the "known to work" laptop is running at, say, 1280x1024, and
therefore it syncs with the projector just fine. But my screen is
1680x1050, and my video driver does not support 1280x1024? 

The projector is capable of 1600x1200. Due to the nature of the
presentation I need to squeeze pixels out of it until it screams.

apparently not the first time you've asked this :)

http://www.devheads.net/linux/fedora/user/dog.htm

the link you got then still works.

ftp://ftp.icm.edu.pl/vol/rzm1/linux-pld-linux/dists/3.0/PLD-20100811/SRPMS/RPMS/dog-1.7-2.src.rpm

additionally, it's available in the debian repos. I assume ubuntoo tu.

The idea is that you run your X11 application over an ssh tunnel.
Your laptop's video driver never enters into that picture.

The projector is only going to project at its native resolution.  All
pushing more pixels at it is going to do is cause it to resample them
into its native resolution, probably badly.  My guess is that the
1600x1200 it cites is just the maximum resolution that it will accept
for resampling.

Projectors aren't the same as monitors.  Don't expect them to be and
your life will start seeming better.  Count yourself lucky if it does
1024x768!  The people in the back of the room won't be able to tell
the difference anyway.

I have personally seen professors using Windows laptops change the
resolution of the projector to match their laptops. Most classroom
projectors at PSU have a native resolution of 1024x768, yet I am
positive they were getting more than that.

I have seen Scribus at 1024x768 while experimenting with the Hitachi
projectors at PSU. It is horrible. If the audience sees desktop
publishing on open source software at 1024x768 they will walk out of
the room and immediately buy Windows and InDesign. 

More years ago than I care to recollect, I paid $2,500 for a 21" CRT
monitor that would do an unheard of 1280x1024. It weighed 55Kg, and I
needed a friend to help me lift it up to my desk. At the time everyone
in the computer world was using 14" or 15" monitors at 640x480. People
were astonished when they saw it. Yet, to me it was worth every penny
and then some. In DTP you need screen real estate. If your monitor
won't do more than 1024x768 then you need to 1) buy a better
monitor/video card, 2) spend the next several months of your life
learning TeX or, 3) expect to have a frustrating experience.

Isn't the same true for LCD monitors? They have physical pixels.  Any data
has to be made to fit.

My understanding is that a projector is just a movie projector with some
kind of screen instead of film.

Hmm, I should google up on that. Might help if I understood more
clearly how they work.

A projector is nothing more than a monitor that projects it's image rather than display it on a fixed screen. 

It still has all the stuff an LCD monitor has, and works exactly the same. 

In my experience, plugging the projector in before booting is the easiest way to get it to work. If your system works with an external monitor, it will work with the projector. 

If it's not working, then maybe your making it too complicated.

It doesn't work with an external monitor at home. That is, it sees the
external monitor, but I can't get it to clone the signal to the external
monitor. The monitor in question is an LCD that runs at the same native
resolution as the laptop. The nVidia Settings GUI sees it, but I
haven't hit on the secret combination of settings that will make it
clone the laptop display to the external monitor. The external monitor
is receiving some kind of signal, because the "no signal detected"
message disappears as soon as I plug it into the VGA output on the
laptop. But it remains black regardless of what I do.

However, yesterday at PSU I did succeed in getting my laptop display to
appear on the wall with the classroom projector. I just couldn't get
the resolution right.

The part I don't understand is where it says in the technical specs for
the projector:

Native resolution 	1400x1050
Maximum resolution	1600x1200

Does "maximum resolution" mean that it will display whatever the laptop
sends to it, as long as the laptop resolution is within the maximums?
And if so, what is the secret to making it do so?

And note that I can't get anything to work with the nouveau driver and
xrandr. My partial success yesterday was with the nVidia driver. Xrandr
reportedly works with some nVidia drivers, but apparently not mine.

>If it's not working, then maybe your making it too complicated. 

It's already complicated.

This is what I was trying to explain to you.  Maximum resolution is
what the projector will accept.  Native resolution is what it actually
projects.  It translates the resolutions by resampling.  Resampling
usually leads to blurry pictures.  You want to avoid that if you can.

Yes.  What I meant to suggest was that people (particularly the
manufacturers) have different (lower) expectations for resolution with
projectors than the do with monitors.  *I* want 1600x1200 native
resolution projectors (and hell, why stop there?), but I don't want to
pay what the asshat manufacturers would charge me for one.

John, I am fully on board with your desired for more pixels.  You are
talking to a guy with 1600x1200 on his laptop and that spent $1200 or
something on a 20 or 21-inch 1600x1200 trinitron back in 1995.  Pixels
rule!  But in my experience, you aren't going to find so many pixels
on projectors as you do on a garden variety monitor.  Expecting them
isn't going to make them magically appear.  Given that (I presume) you
don't want to go into the projector manufacturing business to rectify
this problem, I suggest that you will become happier when you accept
that reality.

On the other hand, if you really! need the higher resolution it looks like
you can now buy an hdtv resolution projector

Most of then are based on the Texas Instruments DLP chip

I saw the guy that invented this chip gave a talk a few years ago. It's a

What I would suggest is to get yourself an Ubuntu USB stick, boot with that with the monitor connected. I have yet to have that fail, straight out of the box. Using the live 'CD' setup, I get into graphics mode on most any system I've tried it on. This is how I test laptops with broken screens to see if anything is on them and everything else is functioning. 

I'm suggesting this because it appears a lot of flailing is going on, with something that should be fairly simple. I'm thinking if you can test it with a generic setup, as the Ubuntu live is.

Message-ID: <1290354689.2779.17.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

SVC: failed to register lockdv1 RPC service (errno 97)

I notice that this seems to hit when the Linux From Scratch script
for mounting non root file systems is reached.

I am adapting a compiled from scratch Linux system to be an NFS root
system.

One strange problem, iptraf installed under /usr/local/bin isn't
copyable let alone usable and I don't understand why.  I get permission
denied period even when I'm root.  I'm nfs exporting usr (ro,sync), so
I wonder if I need to root_squash or if this trouble is related to 
errno 97?

The above snippets show how I have reordered and adjusted the boot
time scripts.

I also had to move libwrap.so.0.7.6 I believe to /lib so that portmap
will work before /usr is mounted.

I wish the blfs book would release information on writing appropriate
init scripts for network root booting.  Another option would be a
substitute set of scripts.  I guess you almost have to mount a ram disk
and chroot to it when root is a remote file system.  It would be
preferable to have shutdown and reboot actually work in a NFS root
environment.  Runlevel 1 is problematic in such an environment.

The instructions for installing X from source in the BLFS book don't
seem to work, period.  I can't figure out how the suggested commands are
supposed to feed the proper file names to wget so that all the required
packages can be retrieved and built.  X is a nice tool for doing
recovery work, though not absolutely necessary. I'm thinking tab window
manager is good enough for a graphical front end to a back up tool(s).

Out of curiosity, what is the best way to back up a Windows 7 system
using ntfs-3g so that you can recover to a blank replacement hard 
drive?  I don't want to go the dd route, hard drives are getting
too big for that.  My dad is in Windows 7 hell, no media to reinstall
it from.

Subject: [PLUG] Fedora Core network install problems...
Message-ID: <1290371314.2576.5.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

I'm trying to create a local ftp repository to install Fedora Core 5
from on an AMD K6-2 system.  I almost have it I think, but when it comes
time to find the packages I get a can't find repomd.xml error.  The
server is CentOS 5.5 based and I'm trying to use CentOS's createrepo.
Question 1, is the CentOS createrepo command compatible with Fedora
Core archives?  Question 2, where do the xml files need to be in the
Fedora tree?  Question 3, do I need a media.repo file or something
similar?  Where does a media.repo file go?

I can't tell from the anaconda error where it is looking for repomd.xml
file.  Supposedly my repository is set up wrong, but how do I set it up
correctly?  I copied the rpms from all the cd images into one RPMS
directory under Fedora, I copied the base files to Fedora/base, and
I did a createrepo in the RPMS directory.  I'm at a loss and google
doesn't seem to be helping.

I use everydns.net, which was recently acquired by DynDNS.com. So now I
think you have to get the account through DynDNS. I have never had any
problems with their service. I think the free service requires that you use
a sub-domain of one of their domains, but the paid service will let you use
your own domain name.

Yes if you use the group option and use the group.xml file that is on
the CD images.  It's needed unless you
want to specify things without groups.
xml files go into repodata directory that createrepo makes.  Normally
the repodata directory
is in the rpm directory.
Media.repo file is for the individual discs.  Not needed for a network repo.

You will have to look at your ftp logs or turn them up high to find this.
Also did you look at alt-f3 or alt-f4 terminals for details logging.

You could also enable remote syslogging via syslog=x.x.x.x from the
pxe line given to the kernel.

Verifying the repo would be easier using yum and querying it that way.

I had something last week with a ftp site that I was finding the files
on the server but ftp would not
work.  Turns out the root of ftp server was not the root of the file
system and I had the wrong path.

The group file is normally located on the CD in the repodata directory.
It is normally called comps.xml or something with comp in it.  You
don't need to change it.
Just use it with the createrepo command which will used it to make the
other xml files.

Unfortunately, Fedora Core 5's installer is adding a strange %2F so that
the path becomes /%2Fpub/ftp_ext/Fedora/Coree5/.  How do I correct this
or work around the problem?  I tried creating a symbolic link on my ftp
server to get around this, %2Fpub to pub, but that didn't work.  I found
a bug report on this, but I guess it never got fixed.

Hello,

When you create the symbolic link, you want to use whatever %2F translates
to in Unicode, not %2F itself.
When you put in %20 (I think) in a web browser it translates to a space.
OK.... upon Googling, %2F in Unicode translates to...... /.
Yes its forward slash, which should be in the path normally.  Or perhaps it
is looking for an extra /, which is erroneous.

Perhaps when you enter the path during the installer, just leave out the
leading /, and it will add it for you.  I remember some fiddling was
required with the RH/Fedora network installer to get the paths working
right.

So instead of

/pub/ftp_etc/Fedora/Core5/

try this:

pub/ftp_etc/Fedora/Core5/

in the line where you specify the remote location path.

Did the bug report mention a work around?

Here is another suggestion, a different course to try:
Try using an http server instead of ftp, to bypass the bugged ftp installer.
You could also try an NFS server.  Both of those should be fairly
straightforward to setup on the CentOS host box.

A while ago when I did a PXE boot network install of my small form factor
Debian box (this machine is old, floppy disk drive, no CD/DVD, and could not
boot from USB), I believe I used a local http server for the installation
hosted on my main Fedora desktop.

I am curious as to why you immediately thought Modbus would be needed. 
For communications between the PLC and a computer?

Subject: [PLUG] MailScanner jamming...
Message-ID: <1290480331.2540.16.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

I have mailscanner failing to pass any email on one of my servers.

To try and fix this I have done the following:

I upgraded to postfix-2.3.3 on the affected server via rpm and the force
option.

I checked every file in the postfix config on the broken machine just to
make sure they match the files from a working machine (and vary in a few
places as well).

I force reinstalled the mailscanner rpm, 4.81.4-1.

I checked /var/spool/relay_spool permissions on both working and broken
server.

I checked /var/spool/MailScanner permissions on both working and broken
server.

I dumped the hold directory and the quarantine directory on the broken
server.

I set the MailScanner incoming directory to be an in memory area and
dumped it.

I've tried 

spamassassin -D -p /etc/MailScanner/spam.assassin.prefs.conf --lint 2>
spamassassin_test

On both the working and the broken server.

I get a message that lint detected 1 or 2 issues and that I need to turn
on debugging, but I don't know how.

I reinstalled mysql on the broken server, every mysql rpm.  I double and
triple checked to make sure mysql is running before MailScanner is
started.

Is there data in /var/www/mailscanner that I need to be aware of?

I was getting errors that perl was defaulting to the C locale, so I
force reinstalled glibc rpm's and did an ldconfig -v which seems to
have cleared that up at least ;-)

How do I tell spamassassin and the mysql databases to dump?  I want
to start over bayesian and everything.  I want to restart the works
here.  Barring that, is there a troubleshooting trick that will tell
me why this server is jamming?  It won't even pass locally generated
email.

At least one of these three pieces is broken:

1 Postfix
2 MailScanner
3 MySQL

The $20 million question is which one and how do I fix it?

FWIW, the author of Postfix feels (and I, personally, agree with him) that the
design of Mailscanner is utterly, completely, awfully broken.  It pokes around
in the innards of the mail server in a way that is absolutely not reasonable
for a third party bit of software.

I would generally suggest using amavisd-new, which uses SMTP or LMTP to
process the messages on the way through, and which I find generally works very
robustly.

(It also has the advantage that you don't need to fiddle with permissions
 inside the MTA, or to run two MTAs, for things to work.)


I know that isn't actually solving your problem in the immediate term, but it
might help avoid it reoccurring in future.

Regards,
        Daniel

I'm getting smarter about this, but I'm still having problems.

It seems around Fedora Core 5 that things get broken.  Network
installs fail for Fedora 9 with cannot find group information
errors and no advice on how to fix that.  Yes, I've tried the
-g option when I do createrepo on the CentOS box.

I've discovered that for pre Fedora Core 5 Fedora's where I have
multiple CD images on the server that I can use links to access
all the rpms from one directory and not absorb tons of disk space.
If the directory structure on the ftp server is correct, you are
golden.  Not so for Fedora Core 5 and later though.  Fedora Core 5
even may be too old to build an LFS 6.6 system on.

So given a Fedora 9 DVD that normally I could install from directly,
how to I put this information on a server in such a fashion that the
network installer won't puke?  The only hint I have is an error that
/sbin/lspci doesn't exist (makes no sense how this has anything to
do with failing to find group information).

I have googled and googled and googled.  Nobody tells you what to do
on the server side of a network installation of Fedora Core 5 or later.
Something definitely has changed.  I can network install Fedora 12, but
not to a K6-2 500.  So by Fedora 12 things may have gotten better.

Make an iso file from the image and loop mount the iso on the server
where the ftp commands can
get at it.

Fedora 12 won't by default support that processor.  686 class or above.

Yep.  Daniel wanted to gather data from the PLCs.  But really, I don't know
much about this stuff.  I wish I knew more, and could actually work on it,
but that's not what's paying the rent right now.

The solution isn't pretty though.  It's where the files are on the ftp
server that makes the difference.  Historically, there was a Fedora
directory with a directory called base and another called RPMS.  Fedora
Core 5 and later don't seem to expect that.  I had to link the RPMS
from the root of the install tree.  The repodata directory seemingly 
has to be accessible from the Fedora/base directory instead of the
normal place, Fedora/RPMS.  So I end up with 2k+ links in the root
directory on my ftp server for the rpm packages covering up the iso
directory and the mount points for the individual iso images.  I think
I can tweak this some to unhide the mount points now that I know the
proper directory structure.  Is is too much to ask for the Fedora
community to publish what has to be done on the ftp server to create
a usable repository?  Maybe I didn't give google the right search
terms...

Hugs seems to be for Windows.  I thought there were some Linux releases,
but is there another route?  I need to learn the rules of Lambda
Calculus and solve some problems related to that before Tuesday.
The Hopcroft book we are using at PSU has a lot to be desired.

Another thing, universal turing machines and computability is kinda
going over my head at the moment.  Seems to me that computability 
is the whole entire point of the course where a universal turing machine
is supposed to represent programmable computers or machines that can do
more than one thing based on what they are given as input.  Is it just
me, or is there too much information in PSU's CS311 course in general?

Any advice on getting online help to learn Lambda Calculus and
understand UTMs would be very much appreciated ;-)

   The replacement Asus WL 520 GC arrived and I'm trying to configure it but
cannot access the admin page via firefox. It must be something I've done
incorrectly and I'm not seeing what that is.

   The Asus is connected to the Ethernet port on my portable, normally eth0
with the IP address of 192.168.55.2. As root, I ran 'ifconfig eth0:1
192.168.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.0'. When I run 'ifconfig -a' I see that port
eth0:1 is running on the 192.168.1.0 subnet.

   In the address box of firefox I enter 'http://192.168.1.1' and see a
message that the connection cannot be established. I also cannot ping that
IP address as a user.

   Cluestick needed, please.

Did you set a route?
first check it with
route -n
then set it with
route add default gw  192.168.1.1
assuming you have guessed correctly what network your router is expecting.

My preference is to use arp to assign (?) an IP address on the local 
network to the MAC address of the "device".  Then I just connect to that 
IP address -- browser, ssh, or whatever is needed.

Bill,

   That's what I forgot. Thanks.

   Now, when I put 192.168.1.1 into the firefox address box I see (in large,

   After correctly instantiating eth0:1 and adding a default route for that
subnet, I can access the Asus' admin page.

   Now, what recommendations have you for security level? My choices are
low/none, medium (WEP 64 or 128 bits), and high (WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK). I know
nothing about these nor how to define hex keys for any of them.

Advice, please,

Rich

I prefer WPA2-PSK but that's me. Others may chime in with their preferences.

I prefer low/none, so others can use my wireless if they need it. Then you
put firewalls on each internal computer to stop access from the wireless.

Drew,

   I just read the Wikipedia page on WPA/WPA2-PSK. I have a 13-character
passphrase in mind. What the article did not explain is what I need to do to
the portables here to allow them to reach the AP using the passphrase.

   Once I enter that passphrase in the Asus I need to provide it to the Dell
(running Slackware-current) and the Toshiba (running xubuntu-10.4; to be
upgraded as soon as the wireless AP is working).

Thanks,

Rich

Bill,

   I had no security on the various Linksys APs I've used; all the neighbors
whose APs can be seen from here are protected so I might as well join them.

You'll need to grab wpa-supplicant packages for both distros and they'll
help you configure the WPA passwords needed to connect via wireless.

It all depends on how much security you actually want.

If your goal is simply to keep honest people off your network, WEP or 
the older WPA will do fine, but either can be broken quickly by anyone 
who so desires.

If you actually want something resembling security, go with WPA2 and a 
long (> 15 character) shared key.

Drew,

   I read about this in my Google searches. I have wpa_supplicant installed
on my Dell running Slackware-current; I'll check Pamela's Toshiba for that
and get it set up if it's not there.

   I'll read more about wpa_supplicant for the answer to this question: if I
set the ssid and passphrase in there for the local wireless AP, what happens
when I try to access other wireless APs from hotels, coffee shops, etc.? Are
those all set with no protection so wpa_supplicant is never invoked?

Thanks,

Rich

Paul,

   From one extreme (low/none on the former wireless APs) to WPA2. I've a
13-character shared key in mind so it won't be as secure as a > 15-character
key, but probably Good Enough.

   Got it straight now. The shared key is associated with the local ssid and
not external ones.

+1

However, besides all those good steps, I put the wireless on its
own DMZ network and address space, then use ssh tunnel from the
laptops.  A 3-ethernet-port ALIX configured as a firewall makes
this easy.  That way I can shape and filter traffic if needs be,
and someday I will add a no-cat splash page to the wireless, 
letting people know for sure that service is free but that they
should behave decently.

I encrypt most traffic on my wired ethernet, not just over the
wireless.  It would not be difficult to get in and add a snooping
device someplace that I do not inspect daily.  The ALIX has a 
built-in crypto engine, so I will configure that someday, too.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1011241104350.30045@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   On the Toshiba running xubuntu-10.04, I created a file,
/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf containing:

network={
   ssid="OurSSID"
   key_mgmt=WPA2-PSK
   psk="OURPSK"
}

but the machine is not connecting to the AP.

   When I click on the circling wireless icon on the panel I see our SSID so
the AP must be visible to the host, but it's not connecting.

   Pointers from those of you familiar with ubuntu are needed.

   The wireless AP is for my wife's use from the den in the rear of the
house. My laptop is connected by an Ethernet cat5 cable. I just want to get
this working so I can focus on my business and not futz with the computers.

Hugs runs on quite a few platforms, it's certainly available for
Linux, however, most current Haskell work is done with ghc:

http://www.haskell.org/ghc/

It's probably worth noting that lambda calculus--without
extensions--doesn't have types, so Haskell is somewhat more complex,
despite having many similarities.

The first computability course you take often feels that way.

Well, if you're working with haskell, these may help:

that on-line book, despite the rather simple illustrations :)

No.  Hugs 98 is a Haskell interpreter.  It should be packaged for any

That's a lot to bite off, so good luck.
You still have today to get down to the FAB and find someone to tutor you.
Also check http://www.pdx.edu/tutoring/

PLEASE check your professor's office hours and drop by.
Most students wait until it's TOO LATE.

You may need to lighten up your course load, and/or spend more time with
fellow CS students.

It takes a certain amount of free time and energy to keep up with your
coursework, turn the ideas around in your mind, and discuss them with
your peers at school.  You may be taking too heavy of a course load to do
all that, and keep up with other demands on your time and energy, like
earning money and being with loved ones.

I had that happen during my Senior year, around the time I met my wife.
I wasted a lot of good tuition until I got things straight.

   Progress has been made, but there is still one step to be fixed.

   The Asus WL-520GC AP is configured and working.

   The Toshiba Satellite running xubuntu-10.04 is connected to the LAN. I can
ping hosts here.

   However, I cannot get outside the LAN from the Toshiba. I'm told there's
no route to the external hosts.

   I have the wireless AP set with the Toshiba's IP address, the gateway IP
address (that of the router between the LAN and the 'Net), and the local DNS
(caching only) and domain name. There must be something I've either missed
or mis-configured.

   Your help in making this last step work will be appreciated.

Rich

It's your time, but DHCP was invented to take care of all of this for you.
On top of that is Network-manager which will take care of bringing up and
down devices as you connect them. Just remove any device configuration from
/etc/network/interfaces and let network-manager take care of things. If you
then still want static IP addresses you can tell the router which MAC
addresses to assign which IP addresses and all is done.

Bill,

   I've 4 hosts on the network and static IPs have worked well for us. I
don't understand how DHCP will fix this current issue. Using the static IP
addresses the laptop can see all the internal hosts, including the gateway
router. If the wireless AP dhcp server assigns the same static IP address to
the laptop how does that allow it to get outside when it now cannot?

Because it does not just assign the IP address, it sets up the routes and
the DNS all with the current information from the router. Plus when you
unhook the laptop and take it somewhere else, you will be using DHCP anyway
so you will not have to change the configuration.

Do you have the dns set up in /etc/hosts? (I think that's the guy they go in)

Bill,

   OK. I'll re-do the Asus configuration tomorrow using DHCP and I'll get the
MAC for the realtek chip in the Toshiba.

   Now I need to learn how to configure and set up wicd on my new Dell so I
can connect to wireless networks with it. I did the wired configuration and
it works on that. The wireless setup continues to escape me.

Thanks,

Rich

Or it could be that you are still fighting your security. Do you have any
wireless devices connecting correctly? Try it without the security first as
a test.

I too run a mix of dynamic and static IP's (servers are static so the 
firewall can map ports to them easily, NAS devices so they are always in 
the same place, etc).  I have found the networking "tools" Ubuntu 
provides to be, well, worthless.  I always manually edit the files.  
/etc/network/interfaces, /etc/resolv.conf are the files (don't forget 
/etc/hosts too), also be sure to remove the dhcp-client app then restart 
the networking.  Unless you have fat-fingers like I do and get one or 
more IP incorrect, you should be golden.  Another way to go might be to 
set the system up with dynamic to make sure everything works, then 
switch it to static.

Bill,

   I just reconfigured the Asus AP to use dhcp and rebooted the Toshiba.
Still sees only the hosts on the LAN and cannot find a route to the outside
world.

   Yeah, it does. However, after I enter the first four pairs of hex

Frank,

   She uses the wireless capabilities outside the house and needs to detect
and connect to access points there. On the local network I can ping hosts --
including the gateway router -- but cannot find a route to get outside.
Doesn't make sense to me, but I'm not familiar with Debian and the ubuntus.

   Because I must be a masochist I'm also trying to get wireless networking
on my Dell laptop using wicd. I got wicd configured for the wired Ethernet
connection but how to do the same for the wireless still eludes me.

Thanks,

Rich

Bill,

   OK. I'll try this, too.

   Until I deleted all the neighborhood APs the laptop detected nm-applet
kept asking me for passwords for them. It has not asked for a password to
the local AP.

What are the Toshiba's IP address and the gateway IP address?

What is the output of "route" with no parameters?

Odd, usually it knows the MAC address, you don't have to type it in, you
have to type in the IP address. But if you have to type in the MAC adddress,
some interfaces want colons between the hex characters, some don't?
But this is beside the point, if it's not working with the address it was
given, then switching over to static will not make any difference.

Be careful that you don't have too many things trying to control the
network, for instance you mentioned that the system is asking for keys for
your neighbors wifi, but not yours and you also implied that you manually
configured your key. Maybe you should remove the manual configuration and
then it will ask for yours also. The same with /etc/network/interfaces. If
you put configurations in there for a device then network-manager will
ignore that device. Remove those and restart network-manager and things
might work as expected.

   Well, something in the ASUS got FUBAR. Now when I enter the local IP
address of this unit it tells me that it's not a valid IP address and resets
it to 10.1.1.1!! Yet 192.168.55.200 is the only way to access the admin
interface and when I try typing in that box that's the default address it
shows. What a serious PITA this is.

192.168.55.1, ASUS wireless AP 192.168.55.200 (except now it won't accept

   I shut down the Toshiba so she could take it with her. If I can get the
Asus AP to accept its IP address I'll quit for today and try to get some
real work done here.

Bill,

   It knows the MAC address, but if I want to have the dhcp assign a specific
IP address to a specific machine it wants the MAC/IP address pair entered.
Yes, I do enter it with colons; perhaps that's how the AP displays them
while not wanting the colons entered. No instructions when I hover the
cursor over that part of the screen. I'll try without colons tomorrow.

   I've learned this about the ubuntus when trying to get that machine to
recognize an Ethernet connection when the cat5 cable is plugged in. Never
did get this working. I took out all the /etc/network/interfaces information
but that made no difference.

   Today I removed /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf, too.

   What puzzles me is how the Toshiba can ping the gateway router, server,
and other portable but not be able to pass through the router to the 'Net.
Nothing changed on the Netgear VFS-318 since it last worked with that
laptop.

Thanks,

Rich

Bill/Frank/Wes:

   I think that I've found the problem: I've managed to let the Asus think
it's connected to the 'NET via its WAN interface when it's only supposed to
be node on the local network. I'll have to go through each setup page to see
where I turn that off.

   More when I have it. Happy Thanksgiving, all.

I am still confused.
Which is it?
A) Asus is the only router and it should get an outside address.
B) There is another router and it gets the outside address and the Asus is
better replaced with a nice cheap switch from Free Geek.
C) your network modem also doubles as a router but you don't want to use its
routing capabilities. So it should be in bridging mode.
Or D)?

   No. If that was the case there'd be no problem with it.

   No. Free Geek has cheap switches that accept wireless connections? I've
always used a Linksys WRT54G or GC. Didn't know a "cheap switch" worked on a
radio.

   No. No. No. The DSL "modem" is connected to the NetGear VFS-318
router/bridge/firewall.

> Or D)?

   Yes. The wireless AP is a node on the local network. It acts as a bridge
between the wireless laptop and the rest of the LAN, plus accessing the 'Net
via the NetGear gateway.

   This has worked very well for a dozen or so years. However, the Linksys
routers failed (both the little ones apparenly died) and the Asus replaces
the failed AP.

Now I understand. The Netgear has no wireless so you need the Asus for the
wireless. Does the Netgear serve some purpose that cannot be done by the
Asus? I am asking if you could just replace the Netgear with the Asus and
remove the Netgear altogether. Then all your wireless and routing needs are
met with one device.

Bill,

   Perhaps the Asus could assume the NetGear's role, but the latter has been
flawless in all its functions. Before the various Linksys wireless units
failed it was never an issue to have them function strictly as a bridge
between radio and wire; they, too, could act as routers and perhaps
firewalls. That's what I went the Asus to do, too.

Thanks,

Rich

In general, how does Comcast treat customers who run their own web
and/or email site?  Without multiple IP addresses, running redundant
servers could be awkward.  Still, fewer global IP addresses equals
cheaper service.  I'm on DSL, but it is painfully slow in my opinion
compared to cable.  The phone service is expensive enough that it might
make sense to switch to Comcast triple play even at the normal
price, whatever that is.  I don't know if Comcast is much better than
CenturyLink considering that Comcast advertises the initial as opposed
to the long term cost.  Yes you are looking at $35+ a month for
telephone service alone with CenturyLink, but at $30/month per service
from Comcast where that price is limited may not be much better.  I wish
FiOS was available in Columbia County.

In my case, switching from DSL to Cable may not make sense.  Dropping
the DSL speed down and supplementing with cable might.  I'm thinking
keep DSL but at a lower speed for my web/email site and use Comcast
cable for my own web browsing.  At least in the short run, it would 
make sense to have both (while the cable is still cheap).

I'm simply curious what people are doing.  For that matter, has Linux
support for satellite based Internet improved?  I'm thinking dual
direction satellite, not the kind where you use your telephone and
receive via dish.

Michael -

I'm using Comcast in Vancouver and I'm running a few services - namely VPN
on a residential account without issue. I do believe they block port 53 for
email but that's the only one I'm aware of that they officially black list
without a corp account.The speeds are decent. I pay 56.99 a month for a tv
package + 12Mbps down 2Mbps up internet access.

I have been running a couple small sites (personal stuff and photos, 
etc) for many years now with Comcastic - they do block port 25 now but 
have (so far) left port 80 alone.  I use zoneedit to manage the IP in 
case it changes - but it hasn't changed in over three years.  I also use 
zoneedit to forward my emails (xxx at mydomain.com) to their comcast 
equivalents (xxx at comcast.net).  No problems.  I think the key is to keep 
the traffic low.  If you try to run a business they may not like it.

Rich,
I think you want to put it in what Asus calls AP mode as described here
http://support.asus.com/faq/asus-faq.aspx?SLanguage=en-us&no=28C95A86-C1D7-F359-7B45-F8F6B966E8BA
where the Asus is just doing wireless and not router function. Does yours
have this feature?

Bill,

   That's how it's set. I somehow also managed to configure it for WAN access
until I realized that's what I did and turned it off.

   The Asus is configured correctly now. I learned how to properly use
wicd-client and wicd-curses on my new Dell laptop (running
Slackware-current) and it connects via the Asus now (as well as over the
Ethernet cable which is faster).

   So, given that the Asus works with the Dell, I need to finish getting the
Toshiba with xubuntu working with it.

   Just turned on the Toshiba and opened a terminal. The nm-applet icon on
the panel keeps spinning. A left-click shows the local network AP (the Asus)
as well as some of the neighbors'. A right-click tells me there's no
connection.

   Now and again a box pops up telling me that our local AP wants a
passphrase. The one it displayed when the 'show password' box was checked
was the admin password for the Asus, not the PSK. I changed that to the PSK
and it still will not connect. Sigh.

   I'm really out of ideas. The Toshiba finds and connects to the wireless AP
at the Gresham Borders store so why won't it connect to the local AP it sees
here?

Thanks,

Rich

Rich,
  I think it's still a security problem so you'll have to get somebody else
in the group to answer that. Wireless security is like door keys. The person
my door lock most often keeps out is me. Anybody who actually didn't care
about the door would just break right in.

Bill,

   You may well be correct. I'm using the same key on the Dell with wicd as I
am on the Toshiba with nm-applet. And the same wireless AP.

   I'll now investigate whether wicd is available for xubuntu, is more
effective here (and equally effective elsewhere), and as automatic as
nm-applet should be.

Thanks,

Rich

   I found -- and fixed -- a typo in /etc/networks/interface that prevented
the wired connection from working. I've downloaded and installed wicd and
will try that for wireless connections after upgrading packages and the
distribution to 10.10.

   What does it mean when the upgrade manager fails to find/download some
packages? I don't recall seeing this before on prior upgrades.

Usually it is do to one of the repositories being down.  You can try again
later or change the repository mirror to one that is working, then try again
and it should get the rest of the packages.

   Thanks, Jason. After the first round I had it check again and it found
another 242 packages (including those it couldn't find before). I let it run
the updates and it's all done now.

   Something is really screwy here. I replaced NetworkManager with wicd and
rebooted. As a user I run 'wicd-client -n' and get a nice GTK GUI box
showing all wireless APs around the neighborhood. Ours is at the top with
100% connectivity. However, trying to connect fails. According to
wicd-client, it's a bad password, but it's the same one I use on my Dell to
access the local AP.

   The properties tab for our wireless AP lets me specify static IP address;
whether I do makes no difference in connecting. It also has two choices for
WAP2 security: password and preshared key. Again, it doesn't matter which I
select, the entered shared kay won't work.

   This makes no sense to me. The same shared key/password works on the Dell
running Slackware-current, but won't on the Toshiba Satellite running
xubuntu-10.10.

   Is there anything other than replacing Xubuntu with Slackware that might
fix the problem?

In WPA2 security the password takes two forms, the passphrase used to create
the key, and the key itself that is created. Are you giving it the correct
one? That's my limited knowledge guess. The problem is probably elsewhere.

Bill,

   AFAIK, it wants the plain-text passphrase and converts that into the key
behind the scenes. I entered the same string on the Asus AP and the Dell as
I did now on the Toshiba.

   BTW, wicd provides more information on what it's doing than does
NetworkManager.

   I am searching for the 'elsewhere.'

Thanks,

Rich

You do want to go into Synaptic or Software Sources (which is a subset
of the repository utility from Synaptic) and test the various servers
to find the fastest one. At the Clinic I have frequently run into
Ubuntu installations where the default server is somebody's laptop on a
dial-up in Upper Lower Somelandia. 

For a while back in my Ubuntu days I had it set to (can't remember for
sure) either cat.pdx.edu or osuosl. Then one day I discovered that
packages that were supposedly available in repositories that I had
enabled were not there. After some experimenting I discovered that some
mirrors were not always complete. And it wasn't just a case of new
packages that were lagged in getting out to the mirrors; often it was
packages for which there had been no changes for months.

Ubuntu does a pretty darn good job of keeping their repos and mirrors
up to date - better than most distros - but the system is still not
perfect.

    I think that there must be a Farraday cage surrounding my brain that
prevents intelligent thoughts from getting out to my conscious.

    Problem fixed: I did not have the proper MAC address for the Toshiba in
the Asus' access control list. No idea where I got the number in there
(might be that of the Asus itself), but I deleted that, entered both Toshiba
MACs (ID and LAN), booted the laptop and it connected. HOO-HA!

    Even works in the den now, with 100% quality. The problem before must have
been the radio in the Linksys WRT54GC was too weak.

    It's interesting that in the office, on the north side of the house
facing the street, wicd-client sees 10-12 other networks; in the den on the
south side facing the park it sees 2 (ours and one other).

Whew!

Message-ID: <20101127221206.7bc8ab88@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I have a Thinkpad T61 with nVidia Quadro NVS 140M running Fedora 14
x86_64 (Gnome). After several days of googling and fiddling I managed to
get the laptop display (normally 1680x1050) to run at 1400x1050, using
the nouveau driver.

I also have a Viewsonic VG2021m (borrowed from Keith Lofstrom) which
can do 1400x1050 as its native preferred resolution. It is plugged into
the VGA output on my T61. I have tried dozens of things, but the
Viewsonic remains black. Actually, it is not completely black, the
power light remains on and there is a hint of the backlight. It is
definitely getting a signal. But I can't get it to display the same as
the laptop screen.

Xrandr sees both displays:

Note that both are set to +0+0, i.e., they are set to be mirrors. 

Google and I are both out of ideas. Any suggestions welcome.

Did you follow the instructions about creating a clean xorg.conf described
here
http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Xorg_RandR_1.2

Or maybe you have a hardware problem. Did you give the monitor connector a
good inspection?

Or you could drop the xrandr method and drop back to manually configuring
xorg.conf

Yes, I read those instructions, but they are three years out of date.

The connector must be good because xrandr sees the external monitor and
can probe its DVID just fine.

>configuring xorg.conf
>http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/X.Org/Dual_Monitors/Nvidia

I have already tried all the suggestions on the Gentoo site, except for
adding both monitors to xorg.conf. At this time my xorg.conf has no
monitor section at all.

What if I add monitor sections for the two monitors, and then later
boot without the external monitor (the usual case for me)?

Thanks for the suggestions.

Since you don't state what the dozens of things are I feel compelled to ask the 
obvious: did you cycle through the <Fn><F_ Key for the external display> settings 
pressing keys at each step?  

This normally puts the laptop display system into three states:
    On board LCD on,  external off
    On board LCD off, external on
    On board LCD on,  external on

If you've chosen the correct F_ key your onboard LCD will turn off during one stage of
this testing.

Well since you will not often be using an external monitor you could just
maintain two xorg.conf files and switch them when you need to, or until you
find the right xrandr setup.

Thanks for the suggestion. I knew that the Fn-F7 key is supposed to
wake up an external monitor, and I had tried it. I was unaware that it
actually cycles. Just now I tried it and the laptop screen did go black
at one point, so it is working. And at one point the Viewsonic powered
off and gave me a "no signal" message. The next keypress turned the
Viewsonic back on. But its screen remains black. So the Fn-F7 keys are
apparently working as expected. 

Among the many things I have tried is connecting to a different
monitor. I have a desktop computer as well, which is connected to a
monitor that can do 1680x1050. Its behavior is the same as the
Viewsonic, that is, there is a faint backlight and I can turn it on and
off, but no screen. At least I know that the problem is not hardware.

I have also tried different resolutions on both screens. And I have
tried setting the external display to be to the right, bottom, top,
and left. Xrandr sees both monitors, says they are connected, and
displays the correct resolutions and timings. The Xorg.0.log does not
indicate any error messages. And I have also tried booting with the
external monitor connected, and also not connected, which made no
difference. If I boot without it connected and then connect it after X
is up and running it becomes immediately visible.

At this point I'm wondering if it's a bug in the nouveau driver.

While looking at the nouveau site I found a troubleshooting page:

http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/TroubleShooting

I'm going to run through the suggestions, especially the parts about
other drivers interfering. I did have the nVidia proprietary driver
installed at one point.

>Can you summarize what the problem was with the nvidia driver.

I want as much screen real estate as possible for my presentation. The
projector will project 1400x1050 and can accept from my computer up to
1600x1200. Therefore, I want my laptop to do 1400x1050 or higher, in a
4:3 ratio. The nVidia driver offers me only 1680x1050, 1280x1050, or
1280x960, and lower resolutions. Thus, with the nVidia driver I can
project 1680x1050, which will be distorted to the audience, or I can
project 1280x960, which will not be distorted to the audience, but
gives me less screen real estate than the projector is capable of.

The nouveau driver gives me options of 1680x1050 or 1400x1050, and
lesser resolutions. By setting my laptop to 1400x1050 I can project an
undistorted 1400x1050 to the audience. My laptop will be slightly
distorted, but I am looking at it right now and it is tolerable. After
the presentation I can set my laptop back to 1680x1050.

Actually, the nVidia driver is slightly faster than the nouveau driver
so, after the presentation I will go back to it.

So there is a problem getting the nVidia driver into the resolution you want
and a problem getting the nouveau driver to display on two monitors. Why not
reverse the problem. Go back to the nVidia driver at 1280x960 and get dual
monitors working. Then try to find out why the nVidia driver is not offering
you the resolution you want. It seems the resolution problem would be easier
to solve.

That is what I tried to do from the beginning. By reading Xorg.0.log I
finally determined that the nVidia driver was misinterpreting the EDID
data from the laptop screen. In other words, fixing the resolution
problem in the nVidia driver required a bugfix from nVidia. Meantime, I
knew that the nouveau driver would give me the resolution I wanted
because the Lucid live CD uses the nouveau driver and it offered me
1400x1050. I also knew that it was possible to get the nouveau driver
to connect to the projector because others have done so. And from
reading the troubleshooting page on nouveau's site I'm pretty sure I
can fix what is wrong. I've just had other things to do so far today.
But before the day is out I'll probably have the external monitor
working. (Crossing fingers.)

FYI, it is possible to force X to read the edid from a file instead of the
monitor.  Had to do this for a couple of years with my Viewsonic monitor,
finally I modified my monitor's firmware to match what the driver was
wanting (different checksum) and have not had any problems sense.

If you want details, let me know and I'll dig through my notes as I have
forgotten the syntax for doing this..

On most Linux systems I've worked with, the locate database is only 
updated every so often (usually nightly, but sometimes weekly). Check 
your cron jobs to see how often the "updatedb" command is run.

HI


Find takes more options

Try


find / -name "nvidia.ko" -print

Another quick answer

Locate uses a database to answer the question..

Find does a search to answer the question..
Find is also A LOT move flexible..    Takes more options

Thanks for all the replies. Now I understand. And from now on I'll just
use find.

If you need to find things often, you're probably better served by
running updatedb more frequently.  I often 'sudo updatedb', grab a
coffee, and come back to run locate. (well, I do this less often than
I drink coffee :).  For me, updatedb is a 5-10 min operation.  Find
will do roughly the same thing, but find's results aren't as easily
reusable (unless you're really thinking ahead, and really know find).

It can be difficult to get the find invocation just right, and you
often don't notice until it's spammed your screen with errors (hence
the 2>/dev/null that someone suggested).

This isn't to say that find isn't useful -- but when searching an
entire system for something by name, I find locate to be generally
better, even with the delay to run updatedb.

If you *aren't* searching the full system, then I either use find
(usually), or pipe locate through grep, searching for the path I'm
interested in.

After several hours of trying I have failed to get the nouveau driver
to light up the external Viewsonic monitor. I did all the
troubleshooting things on the nouveau page, but nothing helped. 

I booted to an Ubuntu 10.10 live CD and to a Fedora 14 live CD as well.
Both were able to see the external monitor, but neither could get it to
display anything. They act the same as my installed Fedora 14. 

I have another monitor that my desktop is normally connected to
(Samsung). The nouveau driver sees it as well, but still can't get it to
display anything. If I connect the Viewsonic to the desktop computer it
works fine. So we know the cables and monitors are good. 

I searched the nouveau bugs on bugzilla and found only one bug that was
close to the same. It was from last spring and was never resolved.

In my peregrinations through the web I came across the possibility of
modifying the EDID in the monitor, as well as the possibility of adding
a line in xorg.conf to force the driver to read the EDID from a file.
The former can be done with a shareware tool called Powerstrip.
Unfortunately, it runs only on Windows, and I have no Windows on the
laptop. It is also scary.

As for getting the EDID into a file, I did that with a utility called
monitor-edid. Here is the ASCII version:

00 ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 24 4d 87 28 00 00 00 00 00 0f 01 03 80 21 15 78
0a bc a5 98 58 55 8b 28 24 50 54 00 00 00 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01
01 01 01 01 01 01 1c 2f 90 d0 60 1a 0f 40 20 30 13 00 4b cf 10 00 00 19
45 27 90 d0 60 1a 0f 40 20 30 13 00 4b cf 10 00 00 19 00 00 00 0f 00 b3
0a 32 b3 0a 28 14 01 00 32 0c 00 00 00 00 00 fe 00 4c 50 31 35 34 57 30
32 2d 54 4c 30 36 00 bf 

Not very helpful, eh?

I can get the physical properties of the laptop display with xrandr (I
think). But I don't know how to put them into a file that the nVidia
driver will be able to understand. If you can remember anything about
how you did it, I'd be interested.

Hello,

Following this thread, something occurs to me, and sorry if this has been
discussed already.
Is it possible the video out on the laptop is not functioning properly?  As
in it doesn't actually output a good video signal, even though the monitor
senses there is something there (doesn't show "no signal" anymore)?

It sounds like you have tested a few different OS'es with a few different
monitors.
It is still possible of course it is just a nouveau issue.

I would suggest trying a few more different live CDs.  Have you tried
Knoppix with the same monitor(s)?
You may also want to try a live bootable CD of that "other" OS, something
along the lines of BartPE [1]
(bootable live Windows CD for repairs and such).

You are in luck, I still have my old xorg.conf file that you can use as an
example.

The key is the* Option         "CustomEDID"
"DFP-0:/etc/X11/VX2025WM-EDID.bin"* in the screen section of the xorg.conf
combined with the binary (non-ascii) version of the edid file (named
VX2025WM-EDID.bin in this example)

I verified that your monitor does have the correct checksum so I am not sure
why it doesn't work correctly for you.  This is worth a try though.
I am including the binary version of your edid that I typed in, just in case
you only had the ascii version.

Also, I found this was what the problem was by examining my Xorg.0.log and
searched for errors, have you looked there to see if it is complaining at
all?
To modify the edid on my monitor, I used a boot CD provided by ViewSonic to
correct a similar problem and customized it for my purpose, I think I still
have the ISO around if you are interested.  It's only about 25 MB if I
remember correctly.

Let me know if you need any more help.

   One can also edit /etc/syslog.conf so that slocate runs each day. Then the
database is current (as of the night before) and locate, in my experience,
returns results much more quickly than does find becuase it's a database
lookup using an index rather than a file-by-file search across all
partitions.

As usual, especially in Linux, "it depends" . . .

whereis: will search only particular paths to find binaries and or 
manpages.

locate: locate uses a database created by updatedb to efficiently locate 
files. Works great, assuming your database is updated often enough.  
updatedb usually runs daily via cron but can be run manually from the 
command line.

find*:* find is a powerful, general purpose search command. For just 
locating a file/program of a particular name, it'll definitely be slower 
than locate or whereis because it will search each and every path 
recursively from it's start point.

Of course, in all cases RTFM.

   And, there's 'which' that shows the full path to (shell) commands. Useful
for finding binaries to run.

FWIW - About a year ago I discovered 'MLOCATE'

"mlocate is a new locate implementation. The ?m? stands for ?merging?:
updatedb reuses the existing database to avoid rereading most of the file
system, which makes updatedbfaster and does not trash the system caches as
much."

And there's also 'SLOCATE'

"Secure Locate provides a secure way to index and quickly search  for
files on your system. It uses incremental encoding just like GNU
locate To compress its database to make searching faster,  but "it
will  also store  file  permissions and ownership so that users will
not see files they do not have access to."

The laptop is a Thinkpad T61 with nVidia Quadro NVS 140M. The desktop
uses the nVidia GeForce 6150 built into the motherboard (Asus
M2NPV-VM, running Jaunty x86_64). The desktop is normally connected to
a Samsung 206BW at 1680x1050. I also have a Viewsonic VG2021m borrowed
from Keith. Both monitors work fine when connected to the desktop. When
connected to the VGA output on the laptop both monitors are recognized
and there is a faint backlight. They take commands from xrandr, like
--off and so on, but nothing I have tried will get them to produce a
display. 

Previously, when running the nVidia proprietary driver with the
Viewsonic connected to the laptop it displayed the screen fine, so I
take this as evidence that the external plug on the laptop is working
as well.

I'm about to reinstall the nVidia driver on the laptop and see if I can
get it to display 1400x1050 with a custom EDID file. If not, the
presentation will be at 1280x960. I don't have time to wait for nouveau
or nVidia to come up with bugfixes.

I have found the custom EDID option elsewhere while googling.

Thanks. I can't remember what utility I used to produce it, but I
remember it offered to create a binary or ASCII file, and I chose ASCII
so I could read it easily.

I hope I never have to read an Xorg.0.log file again. But in answer to
your question, the files are always clean, both now with the nouveau
driver and previously with the nVidia driver.

>To modify the edid on my monitor, I used a boot CD provided by

Don't throw it away, as I might need it. However, it is the laptop
display that I need to get at the correct resolution, and in the
Xorg.0.log the nouveau driver sees it as an "IBM 2887." Not sure if
Viewsonic utility will work with it. In fact, the log file also gives
the EDID in hex:

 EDID (in hex):
[    23.567] (II) NOUVEAU(0): 	00ffffffffffff00244d872800000000
[    23.567] (II) NOUVEAU(0): 	000f0103802115780abca59858558b28
[    23.567] (II) NOUVEAU(0): 	24505400000001010101010101010101

[    23.567] (II) NOUVEAU(0): 	13004bcf10000019452790d0601a0f40
[    23.567] (II) NOUVEAU(0): 	203013004bcf100000190000000f00b3
[    23.567] (II) NOUVEAU(0): 	0a32b30a28140100320c0000000000fe
[    23.567] (II) NOUVEAU(0): 	004c503135345730322d544c303600bf

The nouveau driver then produces modelines for 1680x1050, 1400x1050,
and lesser resolutions, all of which work fine. Presumably it did this
from the information in the above EDID. When the nVidia driver reads
the same EDID it complains that the horizontal and vertical sync rates
are wrong, says it is going to ignore them, and produces modelines just
for 1680x1050. If I add custom modelines to xorg.conf the nVidia driver
tries them, concludes they won't work, and discards them.

Working around other people's bugs is a PITA.

Subject: [PLUG] Help Emacs Find ipython
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1011290847290.9360@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I'd like help figuring this one out.

   When I start emacs it tells me that it cannot find ipython. In ~/.emacs'
python section I have:

(setq load-path (cons "~/development/python/python-mode-1.0" load-path))
(autoload 'python-mode "python-mode" "Python editing mode." t)
(require 'ipython)

   'which ipython' returns:
/usr/bin/ipython

   I see nothing specifying a path for emacs and this error is new since the
distribution upgrade. My assumption is that emacs 'knows' to look in
/usr/bin/ for ipython without needing the path specified.

   Taking emacs' suggestion, I started it with the --debug-init option:

Debugger entered--Lisp error: (file-error "Cannot open load file" "ipython")
   require(ipython)
   eval-buffer(#<buffer  *load*> nil "/home/rshepard/.emacs" nil t)  ;
Reading at buffer position 6649
   load-with-code-conversion("/home/rshepard/.emacs" "/home/rshepard/.emacs"
t t)
   load("~/.emacs" t t)
   #[nil \205\264
   command-line()
   normal-top-level()

which gives me no more insight into the problem's solution.

   How to I tell emacs that ipython is in /usr/bin?

I'm almost afraid to ask this at this point, but is there *any* chance
that the neuveau driver actually worked correctly, and the screen was
just displaying a solid black image? (a black desktop background, or
some other rendering bug?).

I have found that gnome panels often interfere with dragging windows
on to adjacent monitors, so that could also be complicating things if
it decided to position the displays such that you had to drag across a
gnome panel to actually get content onto the other display.

Anyway, I don't expect that this is the problem, but nothing I've read
so far has eliminated the possibility...

I have tried setting the external monitor to "mirrored," "right-of,"
etc. all to no avail. I have done so with the GUI and with xrandr
(which recognize each other's changes), but nada.

Interestingly, if I have set the external monitor to, e.g., right-of I
can then drag the mouse past the edge of the screen to the right. So
Gnome is recognizing the setting. It's just something in nouveau that
refuses to send the signal for the display.

In about an hour I am going to PSU where I will try a projector in an
unused classroom. At the moment I still have the nouveau driver
installed. Who knows, maybe it will display on the projector where it
would not display on an LCD. If that fails, I have downloaded the
latest nVidia driver and I will install it and try it. 

And don't worry about suggesting silly things. In my experience it
often is something dumb that I have overlooked.

Don't know, but could you set a link with something like: ln -s 
/usr/bin/ipython ./ipython
in the directory that emacs expects to find ipython (or a link to it).

Wayne,

   Sure could ... if I knew where emacs was looking for it. :-) That's what I
was hoping to learn running the --debug-init option. No such luck.

I *think* this means that it can't find the .el / .elc file that has
the '(prodide 'ipython) sexp.

Common causes:

* load-path may be set incorrectly, try something like:
   (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name
"~/development/python/python-mode-1.0"))

  instead of your (setq load-path ....)  the ~ may not be expanded
properly, which might cause this failure.

* python-mode-1.0 has sub directories that need added to the load-path.
* ipython isn't the right thing to require.  Maybe you need '(require
ipython-mode)'? (I don't really think this is the issue.)

You can also run emacs under strace to see where it's looking:

$ strace -f -o emacs.strace.out emacs

Then close emacs as soon as it starts, and search emacs.strace.out for
'ipython'.

Rogan,

   I do believe you're correct. I don't currently have ipython.el. I just
downloaded that from the scipy site as well as anything-ipython.el. I'll
read them more completely, tune them to the setup here, and add them (at
least one of them) to ~/.emacs.

Thanks,

Rich

One thing to keep in mind is that when John was over, we actually
did get both the laptop screen and the Viewsonic working with an
Ubuntu Lucid 10.04 live CD.  We did not finish in the attempt to
get Fedora 13 to do the same thing, but I saved all the logs and
libraries and drivers to my server while Lucid was running.  

In situations like this, my predilection would be to:
  (1) buy another hard disk, and put Lucid on it, present from that, or,
  (2) tweak X and drivers until Fedora matches Lucid, or,
  (3) copy the presentation to another machine that just happens to work

Note that the later Thinkpads keep their hard drives in swappable
caddies, and that SATA drive interfaces are reasonably well designed
to handle quite a few insert/remove cycles.  Some thinkpads are
large enough to contain "media bays" - you can swap out the DVD 
drive for a second hard drive bay.  I use these to make "dd" copies
of my hard drive onto an identical spare before trips, and this
saved my (vegan) bacon on one out-of-town presentation.  

With a spare caddy and drive, John can have both an optimized
Ubuntu disk and an optimized Fedora disk.  With two spare caddies
and drives, he can have image backups, the easiest way to do a
5 minute restore in case of failure.  And with a swap bay, he
can pull critical files off the failing drive - they rarely go
all at once.

Note also that when dealing with software such as drivers,
the latest version is not always the best version.  If the
person in charge of the software doesn't have the same setup
as you, they may break something while fixing something else.
So if you find something that works, copy it.  If you want to
help with development, start tweaking things one at a time back
towards the not-working setup and see what is making it break.
Then provide a detailed report to the developer.

Even though I am a Red Hat fanboy and run the Fedora-like RHEL5,
I usually present from a Ubuntu laptop, because I have had more
luck with driver compatability.  Red Hat is a server-oriented
distro, while Ubuntu is a desktop/newbie/works-out-of-the-box
distro.  Thus, Ubuntu may be hard to tweak for edgy stuff like
multiprocessor CAD or scientific computing, but is a lot more
likely to work for display-oriented do-it-the-common-way tasks.

When I went to PSU this morning the first thing I did was find an open,
unused classroom that had a projector. I set things up, booted my
computer, and there was my screen projected on the wall. The projector
in the classroom was a less fancy Hitachi, so it can only do 1024x768.
The nouveau driver not only had no problem sending the video signal to
it, but it synced my laptop display to the same resolution. Yay!

So, armed with this encouraging development I went to FAB 86-01, which
has a Hitachi CP-SX1350, capable of 1400x1050 native resolution
according to Hitachi. It even says SXGA+ in great big letters on the
bottom of it. I plugged things in, booted my computer, and again, there
was my screen projected on the wall. And again, the nouveau driver
automatically synced my laptop to the projector.

But it didn't look as I expected. In fact, it looked exactly as it
looked a few minutes earlier in the classroom. So I opened a terminal
and, sure enough, xrandr decided that the projector could do a max of
1024x768. WTH?

Conclusion: Either the connections through the podium are limiting the
signal, or there is a button on the Hitachi to cripple it. Neither
sounds very likely to me, but there you have it. Unless, perhaps,
someone has a better explanation.

Another mystery is why my computer at home recognizes the two external
LCDs (mine and Keith's), syncs my laptop screen to their resolutions,
but refuses to display anything. What is up with that? Oh, and whether
connected to one of the LCDs at home or the projector at PSU, xrandr
sees the external device as VGA-1. Does the nouveau driver love
projectors and hate LCDs?

So it looks like my presentation is going to be at 1024x768. It will
suck rocks, but it looks like I'm stuck at that.

Okay, I'll give it a shot.  Mind you, I've never used python-mode
at all, so I may be all wet here.  You Have Been Warned.

From my googling about, you should have

  (setq ipython-command "/usr/bin/ipython")...

instead of the (setq load-path ...))...

I got that from the ipython.el file, located at 

  <http://ipython.scipy.org/dist/ipython.el>.

You can also find a lot of good info in the Python programming
pages of the Emacs Wiki:  

  <http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PythonProgrammingInEmacs>.

The IPython stuff is about two-thirds down the page.

Well, no, it doesn't.  The load-path specifies where emacs will
look for emacs "libraries", i.e., Emacs-Lisp packages.  So far as
I know, Emacs doesn't expect anything else to be there.  (I could
always be worng, of course.)  I don't know how Emacs is set up on
your system, so I can only tell you how it works on mine.
According to the sources on the Web, Emacs should look in
/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp for libraries.  However, Fedora
installs GNU Emacs in /usr, rather than /usr/local, and it doesn't
know anything about the /usr/local location.  Since I wanted to
keep site-local things out of the main distro installation, I set
up Emacs to look in the /usr/local location.  In the file
default.el, in /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp, I added the following
lines:

;;; Add the site-wide local directory hierarchy for Emacs-lisp
packages. (add-to-list 'load-path
"/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/") (let ((default-directory
"/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/"))
(normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path))

With that in place, you should be able to put ipython.el in
/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp and Emacs will see it when it
starts up.  (Oh, and I had to make a soft link from default.el
into the site-start.d directory.)

If I want to experiment with my own .el files, I put such things
in ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp, and added the following to my .emacs
startup file:

;;; Add user-only local storage for Emacs-Lisp packages
(let ((default-directory "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/"))
  (normal-top-level-add-to-load-path '("."))
  (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path))


I must admit, the debugger output didn't tell me anything,
either.  :-) I've not had to use the debugger, so it's all...
err... whatever-it-is to me.  :-)

Anyway, I hope this helps, at least a little.

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?by

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?John Jason Jordan

? ? Scribus is just a few years old, but has already achieved
? ? most of the features of the expensive commercial desktop
? ? publishing apps, and a few they don't have. If you need to
? ? do fliers, brochures, or whole books, Scribus is now the
? ? preferred tool.

? ? The presentation will start with a brief introduction to
? ? some of the terms of desktop publishing, especially how to
? ? get your computer to produce something that a print shop can
? ? put on a press. This will include matters such as typography,
? ? color management, banding and line screens, transparency,
? ? imposition, and several other issues.

? ? Then we will spend a few minutes on an overview of Scribus,
? ? how it is different from word processors, TeX, and advantages
? ? and disadvantages. ?This will include the basic features of
? ? Scribus, including typographical controls, master pages, render
? ? frames, PDF forms, PDF export options, scripting, collect for
? ? output, and lots more. It will also cover how Scribus is the
? ? end tool in a process that starts with other programs.

? ? Finally we will reproduce the PLUG flier that was created
? ? in Scribus. ?This will be presented on the screen showing
? ? the steps and features of Scribus necessary to produce it.
? ? Each member of the audience will have a paper copy of the
? ? flier to assist in following the process.

Subject: [PLUG] Firefox: Same Version, Different Behaviors
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1011291706180.9360@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I've tried searching with Google and looked at the mozilla pages on
config:about without finding why firefox-3.6.12 behaves differently on my
laptop than it does on the desktop.

   Both are set to open to a blank page. The desktop installation does this.
The laptop version comes up with a hokey message about being embarrassed in
not being able to restore the previous session. I cannot find anything in
Edit->Preferences to turn that off.

   On the desktop (and on my previous Sony Vaio notebook), clicking on the
address bar and pressing ctrl-u cleared the URL and left the cursor at the
left end ready for typing of a new address. Clicking in the body of the page
and pressing ctrl-u displays a window with the page source code. On the Dell
laptop I get the source code displayed even when I click in the address
window. I see nothing in Edit-Preferences that appears to control this
behavior, either.

   I'd appreciate learning how to change the behavior on the Dell, learn more
effective Google search terms, or learn about a mozilla page that explains
how to control these two behaviors.

I spent the last few days trying to use Hugin and Gimp to create a panorama
from 4 photos.

Hugin: I installed Hugin (v 2010.0.0.5045) from the Debian testing
repositories. I found Hugin very complex and not very intuitive. I am sure
it is very powerful given all the options. I could not get the assistant to
create merge points automatically, even after installing a different plugin.
The tips at the end of this article
https://panospace.wordpress.com/2010/09/26/the-quest-is-over/ were the most
helpful. I tried using autopano-complete and autopano-c-sift from the
command line to create the points (lots of output, no errors), which seemed
to work. However, the resulting panorama was worthless. I also tried
manually entering the points, but never got a panorama out of it.

Gimp: I tried the panorama plugin, which worked. I then pulled out my Gimp
book (Beginning Gimp by Akkana Peck, Apres 2006) and followed her manual
process for creating the panorama, and it worked very well. The only problem
is that I have a vertical shadow where the images are joined together. Sent
an email to the Gimp users list to see how to remove it. I am a gimp novice.

IMO, Gimps' manual method was the easiest to create a panorama from a couple
of images. YMMV. If I had to do this for a living, then i would spend the
time to learn Hugin and make it work. However, after several google searches
and reading different articles, I gave up as it was taking too much time.

Your desktop and Vaio probably have a "gtk-key-theme-name" entry in
~/.gtkrc-2.0. Setting that attribute to "Emacs" gives you Emacs-like
key bindings in the location bar and other text entry fields.

    $ cat .gtkrc-2.0 
    gtk-key-theme-name = "Emacs"

Paul,

   There is no ~/gtkrc-2.0; a couple of other users have them, but I don't.

It sounds very much like something has gotten mangled in your
profiles for Firefox on your Dell.  Try deleting the *.default
directories in $HOME/.mozilla/firefox.  That usually clears up
things like this.  You should probably save your bookmarks, just
to be on the safe side.  Everything should still work, though.

Hope this helps.

Yes, I do.  What do you need them for?  FreeGeek had some too, as of
6-12 months ago.  I went on a safari and grabbed some to scalp the
stepper motors from, which I did, but I also have a supply in my
basement.

The following MozillaZine article may instructive:

http://kb.mozillazine.org/Emacs_Keybindings_%28Firefox%29

It mentions the possibility that your GTK preferences are configured
via GConf. In any case, creating ~/.gtkrc-2.0 with the appropriate
entry ought to enable the Emacs bindings on your new system.

This differs from my brief experience.  I let Hugin make the decisions and I
was pleased with the results.

I have done some reading and I see that the pros use a special head on a
tripod to rotate the camera about the 'nodal point" of the lens.  This makes
near and far objects stay in the right place between rotations
(eliminates parallax).  I am in the process of building such a gadget.  We
will see how that goes.

I notice that Hugin has many features, e.g., lens distortion correction,
depth of focus enhancement from multiple images, and multiple row stitching.
 I have explored none of these.

What version of Hugin?
What distro are you running on?
Did you compile from source or use something pre-made?
What additional program did you download so Hugin would create the points to
stitch the photos together?

Thanks,

For the mechanical part of it: I know this would take all the fun out

Mark,

My experience with hugin matches what Denis reported, so I'll take a
stab at your questions.

I'm not sure -- I've just installed hugin with apt/aptitude.  I'm
trying version 2010.0.0+dfsg-3+b1 right now.

Debian or Ubuntu.

pre-compiled, installed with apt.

I've always done this in hugin.  My workflow is pretty simple with
hugin -- I just follow the 'assistant' tab, and when it complains
about control point auto-detection not working, it dumps me back at
the 'control points' tab.  Once here, just go through the images
selecting control points manually.  (Click a point on the left image,
drag to fine-tune the location, then click close to the corresponding
location on the right image and fine-tune further if necessary, then
click 'add' in the lower right.) I usually set 5-8 control points per
seam.

After setting the control points, I switch to the 'Stitcher' tab,
tweak settings if I think it's necessary (usually choosing a non-tiff
output under File Formats), then click "Stitch Now!", which (usually)
generates the outputs requested.

how permissions on newly created files (including untarred files) are
set depends on your shell and your version & invocation of tar, but
assuming the tar file was not made with those permissions in it (check
with tar tvf file.tar), you can get them back out with the same
permissions with gnu tar's "p" flag (ie tar xpf file.tar).

assuming you want to ignore the permissions in the tarfile instead, do
some googling on 'umask'.  in bash, i'd use 'umask 002' to make any
created files (by tar or others) mode rwxrwxr-x, or umask '111' to
make them all nonexecutable by everyone.  this is probably not what
you want, really, since directories need to be executable to be
usable, tho.

luck++;

Chris,

   That's what I meant. I could not remember umask. The man page is good
enough to remind me.

Much grasses,

Ever since upgrading from Fedora 13 to Fedora 14 Firefox is complaining
several times a day about expired and untrusted certificates. Just now
I had one from the website for the Department of Defense Manpower Data
Center:

www.dmdc.osd.mil/scra/owa/home

Where does Firefox get information about certificates? Can it be
updated?

Interesting! I get an error going to that site too. can you provide any more
examples?

The error I get is "sec_error_untrusted_issuer"

This suggests an issue with the Certificate Authorities installed in
Firefox. Did one get removed in a more recent version of Firefox? If so, we
can simply re-add it. But it might be something else... more examples would
help troubleshoot.

I am running hugin Version 2009.2.0.4461 on Ubuntu Lucid (10.04).  It is a
package. The packages installed are: enblend, enfuse, hugin, hugin-data and
hugin-tools.  I believe the first and last of these are likely the ones
employed for stitching.

I didn't save any of the several previous ones I have had in the past
few days. But I will from now on. 

The site in question is a Department of Defense site. That's why it
surprised me.

I forgot to add that I got the same error with Opera, so apparently
it's not just Firefox. There must be some global certificate place.
Maybe they're in a file on my computer and all browsers use the same
file.

This is pretty common, in my experience. It was surprising the first
few times, for sure :)

I don't understand how the default set of security certificates is
selected -- perhaps there are some complicated export restrictions
written up somewhere that make it difficult for browsers to package up
their software if it includes government certificates.
