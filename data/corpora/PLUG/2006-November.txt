Now picture it with:

  kdialog --caption "ifswitch" --combobox "current: roam" home work

If you have it hooked to a hotkey, a dialog is much easier than opening 
a console.

Tony,

   Yes, I have been changing the ctrl and cap lock keys for many years now by
using loadkeys and ~/.keymap. It works well on other systems, but there must
be something with the notebook that's getting in the way. For reference, all
systems run the same distribution release and kernel.

   X is different, as you note. It reads ~/.Xmodmap and that works flawlessly
in the same machine that's decided to be recalcitrant at the console.

   It's in ~/.bash_profile so it's always running -- when it works, that is
-- in each console.

   I'll figure out a kludge if I can't fix the problem.

Thanks,

Hmmm. This could save me some time. Currently on my Ubuntu Dapper
laptop when I go to PSU I have to open System > Administration >
Networking <password>, then activate the wireless (sometimes takes one
or two minutes to activate it), then > Properties, select pubnet, click
on OK, and wait sometimes another minute or two while it thinks about
it. When I get home I have to change back. I created profiles for PSU
and home, the home one works within 30 seconds or so, but the PSU one
doesn't work at all. I have to do it manually there by clicking through
all the above.

The kdialog line above is cool. (Learning new stuff here.) First, I
installed ifscheme with Synaptic, then tried the command. It popped up
the GUI combobox, but in the terminal it errored out saying the
database was not available. Also a bunch of errors about not being able
to find the device:

jjj at Devil5:~$ kdialog --caption "ifswitch" --combobox "current:roam"

So I guess I need to create the database that the combobox is looking
for. I don't know where to start looking for instructions for that.
Plus, I assume the database would have code to do the ifup and ifdown
stuff, which I think I might be able to figure out. Can you point me to
some documentation here? It would be cool to hit a hotkey, and just
click once on the combobox to select what I want it to do, instead of
the convoluted stuff I have to click through now.

IIRC, loadkeys changes the keymap on every vt.  Makes sense that you 
might need to be root to do that.

Maybe it should go in etc/rc.local?  Debian uses /etc/init.d/keymap.sh.

No.

kdialog only prints what you selected on stdout.

ifswitch uses it to ask what you want and then juggle your network,

But you need to have /etc/network/interfaces in order before it will do 
you any good.

This is not a configuration tool, only a switcher.  If you've been using 
a gui config tool, I guess you'll have to hope it speaks ifupdown.

Read the earlier e-mail.

Have you all looked at networkmanager? If you use gnome it works pretty
well. Its included in the Automatix kit for Ubuntu now. It uses dbus so
you have to wipe your /etc/network/interfaces clean. In the past it was
dependent on dhcp but I think you can set static profiles now(not sure
about that though).

I googled *loadkeys permission* and a lot of stuff turned up. 
There seems to have been some sort of hiccup in the kernel
sometime in the  2.4.31 - 2.4.33 timeframe.  The suggestion
that turned up a couple of times was to update the *kbd
*package (whatever that means for Slackware).

   Thank you, Tony. All systems are running 2.4.32, but I'll upgrade kbd
anyway on that box.

Tony-
Thanks for the info. Rich -- I mirror the official tree's from 9.1 =>
11.0and and it looks like the kbd package hasn't changed between
10.2 and 11.0

I'll do some more digging on what Tony mentioned and see if I can come up
with anything. Might want to check -current and see if Pat's updated
anything there ..

   OK. But, I've other things to deal with first. I'll get to this over the
weekend.

Thanks,

   Yea, team!

   Has autoconf changed between 10.2 and 11.0? I'll look later, but it turned
out to be an issue.

   In an idle momment yesterday I decided to upgrade my notebook from 10.2 to
11.0. Since I've used Slackware it's been a quick and smooth process to
upgrade from one release to the next. Not yesterday, unfortunately.

   When I upgraded the /extra packages, the 2.4.33.3 kernel source was
replaced by the 2.6.17 kernel source. Sigh. Not good. Booting into the
2.4.33.3 kernel meant no modules loaded. Since I need a custom kernel for
the Sony anyway, I rebooted to the working 2.4.32 kernel and tried to build
the 2.4.33.3 from source. 'make dep; make clean' worked just fine. But,
'make bzImage' immediately failed with no rules to 'make autoconf.h.' Well,
that's a new one on me and I've not had time to look into it. But, I will.
Probably over the weekend.

Rich

I think autconf is part of binutils IIRC. So nope hasn't changed. I had some
issues few releases back that required me to actually remove the
kernel-modules package in order to recompile from a vanilla
kernel.orgrelease (newer non-slack kernels for upgrades). Don't think
thats your issue
though.

If you are using Cygwin / XWin, then you may want to use the following
command:

    Local$ xhost +remotehost
    Local$ ssh -Y user at remotehost
    RemoteHost$ konqueror &

and then bring the application forward to your desktop to display it in
your local XWin.

If you need more info, you can email the list or me directly as I use this
technique regularly at work.

I called ENU, but they said they don't install or support Linux.

Can anyone recommend a local store that sells computers with Linux 
preinstalled and provides good support?  It would be nice if it's near 
Vancouver, but anywhere in the metro area will do.

Tonight I was helping a friend learn about Linux - we got through a
lot (where and what to search on Google, upgrading, rpms, etc.).  

One rough spot was when we attempted to upgrade Firefox 1.5.0.7 to
Firefox 2.0 .  We figured out how, but the process was painful;
there is no online documentation for upgrading 1.5 to 2.0 that
describes what to do and where things go.  This was upgrading a
SUSE 10 system, so we decided not to do a real install.  We will
wait for SUSE to provide an RPM that puts everything in the right
places for SUSE. 

 was unpleasantly surprised at how undocumented and newbie-unfriendly
the manual tar and move links and find plugins process was.  I would
not expect an unaided newbie to try this.  This is of course
compounded by the problem that a browser is a critical item to
re-install;  if you goof up, it will be difficult to go back out on
the web seeking help.

Am I expecting too little from newbies, or expecting too much
too quickly from the firefox people?  Again, I expect SUSE 10
will have a Firefox 2.0 RPM upgrade in a week or two, but most 
newbies won't have such an easy time of it.

I downloaded the .gz, .tz or whatever file but I haven't installed it yet - I 
would have to pore through my Linux books to find that note where I wrote 
down what do do with a stupid "not a normal ZIP and doesn't install with a 
double-click" file...

RPM or equiv would be nice ...

Maybe it'll be user-ready March 2007?

One thing I like about Linux is that it runs for years without maintenance or 
upgrades... I've even forgotten what the hell I'm running, and there's 
nothing in the 'Star' menu that even says what this system is...

Well Keith...

Honestly I'll be surprised if SUSE will have firefox 2.0 very quickly. One
of the things that makes *in some aspects* SUSE harder, is the factor that
it is really challenging doing a source upgrade. This is due to the large
amount of customizations which occur. (It's like Real Estate, location,
location, location.)

The advantage is that if you're using YAST and SUSE has released it, it's
generally pretty good at working from the get go. (There have been times
when it wasn't that way.) The downside is that you're not usually going to
get the latest and greatest, but it will be very stable.

You may wish to try out the Firefox 2.0
packages available in the openSUSE buildservice:
http://software.opensuse.org/download/repositories/mozilla/SUSE_Linux_10.0/

(I *think* but don't know for sure that you can add that URL as an
installation source in 10.0's yast and then be able pull in any necessary
dependencies automatically.)

You can read more about the openSUSE build service at
http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/User . The people maintaining the
Mozilla packages are both people from SUSE (unfortunately, the build
service requires an account to see who's maintaining a specific project).

   1.) mv <file> to desired directory and run 'tar xzvf <filename.gz/.tgz>'

   Er, better do the security upgrades for your distribution as soon as they
come out. If you're not on the security mail list, find it and subscribe.

Well, I'd really like to help, but I'm afraid this is another "I use 
<XXX-linux-dist> and it just
works",  where  <XXX-linux-dist> ::= Ubuntu Edgy (6.10).  I'm about to 
install the latest Suse, so
I'll give it a go and see what the precipitate looks like.

I've installed Edgy a couple times in the last week. Count me as an

Unless you have the source distribution for firefox 2, then you can
skip steps 3-5 and just do "./firefox"

No, there is no such store, unless you're looking for business-class
systems.  None of the small, local PC shops have the time to devote to
learning and supporting Linux and there isn't that much market for it,
AFAICT.

That (just run ./firefox in the build directory) is what I did regularly 
during the transition from
1.0.x to 1.5 in Mandriva, and it worked fine.  I think a lot of the 
cache/control stays local to the
build directory in that case, and I seem to recall doing some fancy 
linking and copying to keep
the environment the same (bookmarks, plugins, etc.), not something I 
would expect the average
user to want/have to do.  Keith is right, it should be easier (another 
plug for Ubuntu here). 
Waiting for someone on the dist team or in the community to create a 
.rpm/.deb package
is the pits.  Almost makes me want to do it myself.

It picked up my old settings just fine, it should store everything in
<home> regardless of where you run it from.  Plugins installed under
the installation dir. will need to move if you move the binary, of
course, but you can put them in your home dir anyway.

This is one of the biggest problems with deployment on linux....
possibly the biggest problem with linux.  There are *so many*
variations of linux, each with a slightly different file system, or
slightly different libraries in slightly different places.... you
either have to know how to do it your self, or you have to wait.  It's
not reasonable to expect a project maintainer to cater to everyone's
needs -- that's precisely why we have distributions.

Firefox *is* easy to install, compared to many things.  Pick an app at
random and try installing it w/out using a distro package.   Say, Open
Office ;)

It is also nowhere near Vancouver.

I just viewed the joint Microsoft/Novell announcement.
The core of the announcement is that Novell has agreed
to compensate Microsoft for its Intellectual Property.
When customers buy Novell SuSE Linux, they pay an
"upfront balancing payment" that earns them a patent
covenant from Microsoft.

Steve Balmer made it clear that if you buy or use
something other than Novell SuSE Linux, you will have
no such covenant and will be at risk.

I'm wondering how this is different that the license
fee SCO offered for Linux users. This announcement seems
to guarantee Microsoft a revenue stream from Linux sales.

Microsoft promised not to bring action against Open Source
developers - all developers apparently - not just those
who develop for SuSE Linux.

They also announced technical cooperation on things
like virtualization technologies, interoperability,
and document formats (Office/OpenOffice interoperability).

Strange bedfellows: Microsoft, Novell ink pact

11/2/2006 3:28:11 PM, by Eric Bangeman

At a press conference in San Francisco, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer
and Novell CEO Ronald Hovsepian announced a new partnership between
Microsoft and Novell. The unprecedented deal will have Microsoft
offering a degree of sales support for Novell's SUSE Linux while
both companies work towards better interoperability between their
respective operating systems. As part of the agreement, Microsoft
also promises not to wield its patent portfolio against SUSE Linux.

Of course that didn't do any good since the latest version of Suse I 
installed is
OpenSuse 10.2  Beta, which, of course, comes with firefox 2.0 already there.
Shows what I get for being a new gadget tester/shaker by habit.

Me thinks we've entered a new era, probably triggered by the
Oracle announcement, and with the foreseeable end of SCO also factoring
in to the calculations.

There's going to be a lot of jockeying for position among the big players
in the software industry. Probably some mergers and a fair number of
colossal mistakes. And someone might actually make a smart move at some
point.

So sit back and enjoy the show.

Anyone else want to use a USB-P1K phone from www.von-skype.com on a Linux
distribution that is more stable and more recent than Fedora Core 3?

I tried it on Fedora Core 5 and couldn't get it to work.  A few things that
really irritate me, Linux compatibility was advertised but the phone wasn't
shipped with Linux drivers.

Is there a way to install a compatible version of the dbus library without
making all my programs on Fedora Core 5 use it?

I ran into a web site: http://www.dizwell.com/prod/node/42

Thats suggest connecting a repository to CentOS's yum system via:

rpm --import http://dag.wieers.com/packages/RPM-GPG-KEY.dag.txt

etc.

Question is, which repositories are safe and which ones aren't?



On a side note:

I'm leery of doing updates, I am configuring CentOS to replace my 
aging Redhat Valhalla system.  I want clam antivirus though.  I 
remember for the 2.4 kernel that there was a cd changer program 
in the documentation of the kernel source.  Trouble is, how do I 
get a patched up kernel source tarball installed?  Are there any 
plain english explanations of the changes the CentOS community makes
to a stock kernel?  I found and installed the source rpm, though
not without tons of errors about a user not existing.  So it 
installed the source as being owned by root.

I bought it off of http://www.von-phone.com/ because it was advertised
as being Linux compatible.  It barely is.  The darn thing requires
Fedora Core 3 and even then you can't use the keypad on it.

$30 is more than a TracFone and a TracFone not only works, it sounds
better than this thing does.

http://www.von-phone.com/support.php links to the support page for this
product.

I give this product a 1/5 rating.  Big tip, it uses the OSS sound
drivers and doesn't work with Alsa.

I am as dissatisfied with this product as I was with the Intel 536EP
chipset modem that I couldn't use the voice features of under Linux.

Why do companies say works with Linux on their web sites but drop that
little note on their product cds?  Worse, why is the support inferior?
This USB device doesn't look that complicated.  Someone else could
probably do it better.

Would this be a good time to point out that Steve Gibson's review of
Vmware and Microsoft's offering favored VMware hands down?  Apparently,
Microsoft doesn't know jack about doing virtualized machines.  Every 
version of Windows, from what I can tell, has been designed to break
program compatibility.  Why support running Windows NT in a virtual
environment if you can make more money forcing companies to upgrade
to Microsoft Server 2003?

As far as the Redhat should be worried comment in the mentioned article,
why?  Redhat is in a different market than Microsoft is.  Microsoft has
no grounds to threaten Linux users with patent infringement lawsuits.
The purpose of patents is to increase public access to and fair use of
technology.  Attempting to use the patent system to create an empire is
an abuse of it and shows a lack of consideration.

For a while, I've been hoping that ReactOS will become more functional
for deskop use.  I think it would be better to prove to Microsoft and
the world that you don't need Windows, or any Windows compatible system,
to accomplish fantastic computing feats.  

Windows is not a good operating system.  Microsoft basically ignores the
Internet Engineering Task Force's every recommendation.  The registry
concept of Windows has become a monstrosity as various software vendors
and even Microsoft itself have abused it.  If the courts would get their
act together, Microsoft would be in trouble for threatening to sue Linux
users without grounds to do so.  

Isn't harassment against the law no matter how rich and powerful you
think you are?  Isn't it slanderous to lie about patent infringement
from a competitor when there isn't any infringement?  Does this strike
anyone, lying about patent infringement, as anticompetitive?

I think the response to this partnership is to generate more demand for
Linux.  If Microsoft is crazy enough to try and sue Linux users, I hope
people rise up and put Steve Ballmer in his place.  By rising up I'm
advocating: Microsoft software boycotts, helping people use alternative
software, and helping further the development of open source software
solutions.

NTFS on linux is not really a good idea.  Most of the write support
falls in the category of "It usually works, but if it zeros out your
filesystem, well, oops."

You can bypass Windows lack of support for large fat32 volumes by using
something like partition magic to create the partitions, I caution I haven't
done this in a few years but _did_ actually work .. I created the max
partition size allowed by windows to start then used PM to non-destructively
increase the size past the limit. NTFS should be avoided at all costs (if
you value your data) IMHO atleast for the time being.

Does it?  I was using the DOS format command, but it kept barfing.  And I
don't have a copy of partition magic.

FAT is just a wee bit nasty so I'd tend to avoid that if possible. I'm
not entirely sure of its stability, but I'd point towards UDF. Apparently
the less privledged system does support full read-write on UDF, and I've
seen it stated that UDF tends to be used on the larger USB keys (for
which sparing sectors are important, unlike hard drives). I do know it is
possible for Linux to mount and write UDF filesystems, just I'm not
entirely sure of the stability. `fsck.udf` would be good to keep handy.

Yes, that is the reason explicitly stated in the US Constitution, by
allowing a temporary monopoly. Now, would you please face reality and
read how the system is actually being used by companies?

Yes that is the case. Now try to prove it in court in front of a judge.
They will claim there are some reasonable grounds under which they
/might/ be able to sue, therefore it isn't slander. The article isn't
stating that they've threatened to sue anyone, just implied that they
think they could. True the implication is ridiculous, but that is an
implication, not an outright lie.

Here you may have it right, this could well help Linux more than it helps
Redmond. I suspect their latest EULA may well do more damage in the
immediate timeframe though.

I've been studdying Knoppix, Fedora core 6 and other linux installations and I just can't figure out how to get NTFS support. Nothing lets me have RW access to the partitions. According to the output in the terminal I should not even be able to have RW permission to the root of the Fedora install partition when I am logged into Root in the terminal. It does not give the same options as FC5. But in any case this is not an advantage to me because no matter what kind of Linux I use I can't open and change files in NTFS. I can open them with Knoppix but thats where it ends.

It's really not necessary to bait him; especially since I end up having
to moderate it.  His posts have been mostly on-topic lately; let's leave
it at that.

Did you even google it?

Apparently you can right-click the NTFS partition ("drive") and select
the r/w option.

Or `mount -o remount,rw /mountpoint` might work?

Better plan it for a few years out.  And even then, get refundable 
tickets.

There's nothing new here.  Having watched the press conference, I'm 
mostly hearing that MS feels entitled to extract licensing fees from 
Linux users (likely by virtue of their patent on the backslash and 
similar "innovations".)

What puzzles me is how this doesn't put Novell on the wrong side of the 
GPL.  It implies that only licensed SUSE customers are granted a 
license to use this supposed MS IP.  If this is the case, I would 
assume that this license is not universally transferable, which sounds 
like the imposition of restrictions on GPL'd code not owned by Novell 
-- hence voiding their right to use said code.  Guess we'll see what 
the courts think about this having-and-eating-not-your-cake business.

The other fun fact is their claim that they'll grant a covenant to 
"individual" open-source developers.  That means as long as you're 
writing free software and not running a company, they will be happy to 
steal your work and not sue you as soon as they file a patent for it.  
If you have money to extract, I guess that's a different story.

Hmm.  My guess is his hosting service lapsed and that IP now points at
someone elses server.  The lists.whiteknighthackers.com is at the same

   Has anyone a use for a 15" monochrome CRT monitor and/or a full-size
keyboard? I used them when upgrading or rebooting the firewall box, but they
are now surplus.

   If not, off they go to FreeGeek.

Hello Linux folkz,
After recently announced "collaboration" between Novell and MIcro$oft,
I'm going to drop SuSE for good and to migrate myself and my clients to 
another Linux distro not tainted by M$ or corporate greed. 
I don't want to get into a situation when Novell repeats the fate of SCO or 
gets sued for violating GPL license.
Could somebody please recommend Linux distro which installation and 
configuration tool has look and feel similar or close to SuSE's YaST.

Many thanks in advance,

Alex

I have not used every distro, but I've seen a few, and I've never seen
anything as wonky as yast.

If a distro migration decision is to be based upon the updater utility,
then perhaps it is time to rethink the entire problem.  RPM is
inherently inferior to apt.  Some good reasons for making this claim can
be found here:

synaptic is the GUI for performing update/install operations on a debian
machine.

openSuSE is more like Fedora than CentOS. CentOS is an attempt to be a
binary-compatible rebuild of RHEL, while Fedora is a corporate-sponsored
community effort (as in, "lawyers and accountants make sure it's all
legal").

Your "true community" options -- little or no "corporate structure" are
Debian (apt-based administration) and Gentoo (Portage-based
administration). The choice between Debian and Gentoo depends largely on
whether you want to recompile almost everything (Gentoo) or run a pure
binary (Debian) Linux.

I run Gentoo and am both locked in and happy about it. :) But it will
never win any popularity contests as long as there's Ubuntu and Fedora.

I won't upgrade my Ubuntu Dapper amd-64 to Edgy until after finals, but
I did download and burn the live/install CD. When I booted to it this
morning it found and configured everything, even my Broadcom 4306
wireless. Dapper was supposed to find and configure Broadcom chips
also,  but I found it didn't work and had to go back to ndiswrapper.
Looks like wireless has had further improvements.

I also downloaded 32-bit Edgy and burned three copies to bring
to the Clinic. That should hold us until I can order free official CDs
from Ubuntu (no Edgy available yet).

I'm totally with you.  suse to gentoo is a big leap, though.  I went
from redhat 8 to knoppix 3.4 to pure debian to gentoo, a process that took
2 years.  Once I hit gentoo, I have been a happy camper for 2 years
more and counting.

Regarding ubuntu and fedora: at my job, where I have been working for
the past year, I have watched as former linux naysayers are (through my
efforts) been coming around.  There's a guy who has been fighting with
fedora for a month or two.  He put ubuntu on his home machine, and likes
it way better.  I'm all for it.  If there's a debian distro that
everyone likes better than the redhat family of distros, and if ubuntu
can get more widely supported among the big corporate vendors (hardware
ones especially), we may start seeing debian make its way into Houses of
Microsoft like the one I work at.  That can do only good for us staunch
linux users who have to work in these environments.  I get to run gentoo
on my workstation, but I am the only one in an 800-employee company who
has this privilege.  I pay for it by being the java dev.

Gentoo users should remember to be thankful for all the debian community
has given us: common-lisp-controller, and the new and improved java setup,
come to mind.

Isn't opensuse going to be tainted by M$ along with corporate SuSE through 
this "collaboration"?

I'm going to use it mostly to deploy my applications and web based services to

I wonder what the fuss is all about.  I see M$ supporting vmware with
SuSE running in that on Windows.  I see Windows running inside vmware on
SuSE.  The distributions will be separate and under their own licenses. 

Am I reading this wrong?

A word or two of advice:

1. If your concern is avoiding lawsuits, hire an attorney and take his
or her advice. This isn't a technical matter, after all -- it's the
legal health of your business that's at stake.

2. If you want to be compatible with the 900-pound gorillas in the Linux
business -- for example, if you want to hire certified systems
administrators, etc. -- your choice of distro really boils down to three
options.

   a. Red Hat Enterprise. If you can afford it, it's stable, well
supported and the horse to beat.

   b. Fedora. There's a very strong community and all the support Red
Hat can *legally* provide.

   c. Novell SuSE Enterprise.

I'd recommend staying away from CentOS. I've used it, and I haven't had
any problems whatsoever with it, and it seems to be what it claims to be
-- a community-driven rebuild of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. My hesitation
to recommend it is based on concerns about the strength of the community
relative to the strength of the Fedora community. CentOS is *competing*
with Red Hat and Fedora is *co-operating* with Red Hat. That's a *big*
difference!

And I'd recommend staying away from both Gentoo and the Debian-based
distros -- Ubuntu and Debian itself. The communities are strong, and the
package management and system administration tools are first rate. But
they are *different* from Red Hat -- the 900-pound gorilla. That's a
cost to you, the business owner.

Alex,

   If you're going to be installing, maintaining, and using it then you might
also consider Slackware. It's highly stable and works very well.

   The FUD about Microsoft indemnifying Novell/SuSE users from patent
lawsuits is an echo of SCO's attempt to extort licensing fees based on what
they claimed to own with UNIX. Some companies were foolish enough to buy
into the FUD, but SCO is being shot down (or has been emasulated) in every
one of the lawsuits they initiated.

   Novell and Oracle have no more love of OSS than does Microsoft. They're
all trying to figure out how to keep milking their cash cows while their
business models dry up and blow away like the over-hyped dot-coms did almost
a decade ago.

   Ya' think Microsoft is going to sue Munich, China, Brazil, and India for
patent infringement?

   Just keep your seatbelt fastened. There will be a lot of excitment in this
continuing drama.

I disagree.  Regardless of the relationship between CentOS and RHEL,
CentOS is a very strong choice--it has the stability and familiarity of
RHEL without the price tag (which honestly isn't that bad at $300/yr).
If you want to get, say, your RHCE you can learn it on CentOS.

The additional benefit is that RHEL remains an easy option--if you have
customers who want to pay for support or want to run a proprietary
application on a certified platform in production, you can use RHEL and
use CentOS for dev and QA.

If you have a customer with a RHEL server which they no longer want to
pay for support, you can just switch update sources to CentOS and not
worry about it.

If you maintain a collection of locally-built packages, you need only
build them once (per major version).

Fedora isn't a good choice for commercial uses like this because its
lifespan is frightfully short and fedora-legacy near death.  I like it
on my own workstations because I always want the latest there, but my
servers are all CentOS.

Yes, they will just work. 

However, the 'one-button backup' stuff seems to be Windows-only. Please
let me know if this is not the case for you; I've never seen that button
do anything under Linux.

Pretty much all USB drives work with Linux. However, some of the more
clever vendors have gone out of their way to be Linux compatible. Check
the boxes at CompUSA and Fry's, and search the web.

As to gotchas, if you're counting on using software supplied with the
drive, it probably won't work on Linux. And one big gotcha is that a USB
drive is usually formatted FAT32. If you hope to share it with other
operating systems, you won't want to re-format it. And if you need to
re-format it, you're better off doing that on a Windows system. Windows
puts some extra things on when it formats a partition.

If you plan to use it for Linux only, you're free to reformat it with
something that has Linux-specific features, of course. Big external USB
drives tend to be slower than internal hard drives, so you might want to
choose a filesystem that's optimized for a lot of writing of the type of
files you're planning to back up.

I bought a "Fantom" 250GB external USB 2.0 drive to and my laptop, running 
Linux, detected it when I plugged it in. The entire drive came formatted from 
the factory as NTFS and so I shrunk the partition size down and created a 2nd 
partition and made an "ext3" filesystem. 

Unfortunately I need to dual-boot my laptop so I need to backup data for both 
WinXP and Linux from my laptop. IIRC I was running SuSE 9.2 at the time I 
made the original drive purchase and it worked flawlessly. I would guess that 
any reasonable Linux distro with good USB support would work as flawlessly as 
SuSE' Linux in terms of supporing a USB 2.0 drive.

OK, so I've built this AMD64 system (ended up getting a pretty decent deal

I'm pretty sure that java and flash are strict necessities on this

  Not if you want a native AMD64 version of Flash 9 anytime soon...
Here's the story, direct from the developers beak:

http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/2006/10/whats_so_difficult_64bit_editi.html

  There are apparently ways to run Flash 9 via compatibility libs, but
you're on your own figuring it out.

If you use amd64, you'll simply run 32-bit versions of java and possibly
flash.  This means running a 32-bit build of your browser.  Haven't
played with 64-bit debian, but in gentoo it is a no-brainer to pull in
and use 32-bit packages.  There is a mozilla and a miozilla-bin, for
example, where mozilla-bin is a precompiled 32-bit mozilla.  I imagine debian
is solid in its 32-bit emulation too.

I use amd-64 version of Ubuntu Dapper and it works great in all
respects except a couple of things, one of which is flash. Other
plugins are sometimes a bitch too. If I really needed flash and
multimedia plugins working in my browsers I would just install the
32-bit versions of the browsers. Right now I use Crossover Office
(getting WINE working on 64-bit is doable, but a lot of hassle), and
Crossover Office has a list of supported programs that you can just
click and install. One of them was Quicktime, so I installed it. It
installed itself as a plugin in Opera, but I can't figure out how to
get it working in Firefox. 

You can go to the Ubuntu 64-bit forum and find a lot of advice on
getting stuff working on 64-bit Ubuntu. Most of the advice is
appropriate for other 64-bit distros as well. Look for posts by a guy
who uses the nick Killz; he seems to have a pretty good handle on this
stuff. He advocates the 32-bit browsers and has instructions/scripts
for installing them on 64-bit Ubuntu without using a 32-bit chroot
environment.

I haven't tried getting those things working in 64-bit Edgy yet,
because I'm not going to install it until a month from now when finals
are over. I've booted the live CD, and I noted that Firefox did not
seem to have any flash or multimedia capability. So evidently those
things are not going to get installed by default.

First, you made another sale of your book the other day. A copy now
resides in the bookshelf behind me. :)

As for USB drives, as others have noted, they "just work." At least on
my Ubuntu Dapper amd-64 machine they do. I plug one in and Nautilus
pops up a browser window. All I had to do was create a mount point
"/media/usbdisk" and mounting is a snap. Both of mine are formatted
ext3, the same as the hard disk partitions on my computer. 

But having said that, I have some problems that make me wonder. For
example, if I use Kdar to make a backup, half the time the computer
locks up solid -- no keyboard, no mouse -- in the middle of a backup.
It seems to happen mostly when Kdar is chewing on a large file. A
couple of times I have had lockups just copying large files to and from
the USB disk, i.e., with Nautilus. Is there a problem with the USB
driver? I can't say. I know I have googled and never found any major
complaints. If my problems were caused by a bug in the USB driver you'd
think there would be serious screaming all over the Linux forums. So do
I just have flaky drives? One is the original drive that came with this
computer. The other is a Pocketec sold specifically for backing up
laptops. And I can also add that my USB ports work flawlessly otherwise
-- my mouse has never failed me, for example.

It's all a mystery to me. All I know is that I don't trust backing up
to my USB drives. Before I do I make sure I have saved all open files
and closed all programs other than what I'm using to back up the data.
If it's going to lock up at least I'm ready for it.

What I really crave is a hard drive I can stick on my home ethernet
network. They're kind of expensive, though.

If USB drives worry you, how about a mobile rack?  It's a thing that
fits in a CD bay, and accepts a 3.25" hard drive.  You can even get ones
that take up 3 CD bays and accept 5 hard drives (fitted vertically).
These are super cool.  And mobile racks slide out - hence the "mobile".

If you mean Java as an applet running in a browser I can't help you, I 
hate them and never (ever) want to see one, YMMV.  I do use the amd64 
version of Java on my 64 bit AMD for other things though and it works 
dandy.  As I recall wasn't trouble to install and get working at all.  I 
do need Flash though and I just run 32 bit versions of Firefox and 
Flash.  That was also very easy, google answered all of my questions in 
mere seconds.

This becomes an even more interesting discussion in light of the bruhaha
around Oracle Linux, which is also a "rebuild" like CentOS. As the
CentOS developers freely admit, the tools they use to rebuild aren't the
same as the tools used by Red Hat, and this may affect compatibility /
certifiability - in terms of support for specialized software (not any
LPI/RHCE sort of tests).

But this drifts away from the topic. Remember, most all of SUSE is GPL,
and built from the same source code as Red Hat, CentOS, Debian, etc. So
if Microsoft has agreed to not sue Novell, then they have no basis for
sueing Red Hat, etc. over the same code.

But then again, IANAL.

Thanks,
Mike

You mean like a NAS? You can sort of fake those. Go buy a case, cheap
motherboard with RAID built in, a gigabit NIC and a couple of identical
hard drives. Install your favorite Linux distro, Samba and NFS and
you've got a NAS.

Speaking of gigE, since even USB 2.0 speeds far outstrip Fast Ethernet, it 
looks I'm going to have to upgrade my network too. What a pity, having to 
purchase new toys.

I just realized that I don't have any real speed information on the
various possibilities. My home wiring is CAT-6, but I don't know how it
would really perform if I connected gigE devices through it. The only
gigE device I have is my Linux laptop. Everything else, including my
Windows desktop (five years old) is fast ethernet only. If I bought an
NAS drive that had gigE connection, I wonder how fast the laptop and it
would talk to each other. I'm talking real world v. theoretical. I
googled and didn't find much. And what would be the comparison if I got
a 1394b drive? That is, assuming that the Firewire port on this laptop
is 1394b and is actually working under Dapper amd-64 -- I don't have
any Firewire devices to test it with. I just assumed that the fastest
solution (from a practical standpoint) would be a gigE NAS drive, but
that may have been an unwarranted assumption.

I've been lovin' it with Edgy for the past while.  Now that it's gone
into lockdown, I gotta say it's just about ready for prime-time.
Suspend/resume is a bit hinky on my old Dell, but it's a hard model to

Message-ID: <20061105114624.1fd5c48c.johnxj@comcast.net>

I just know there are people here who dream in SQL commands. My
knowledge of SQL is negligible. I need to change an SQL command that
reads a table in an OOo Base file and displays it in a control in a
Writer form document. The current syntax is SELECT DISTINCT "IPA" FROM
"Test_Table". I need it to sort the data based on the field "Number",
which is also in "Test_Table". I tried appending SORT ON "Number" FROM
"Test_Table" but OOo puked it up. I don't have time to take a course on
SQL commands (I actually tried reading a book on it once and found it
hopeless for me). The problem is that I need to deal with SQL commands
only once in a blue moon; not enough to be worth my time to become an
expert. Can someone tell me what is the secret to getting the SELECT
command to sort the data when it displays it in the OOo form control?

Perhaps the reason is because linux is all about choice.  "Because I
can" is a valid reason to run any version of linux on anything, any time.

I'm running java and flash on an amd64, and it works great.  I do employ
32-bit binary builds of java, flash and firefox, but that's only because
Sun and Adobe haven't stepped up with x86_64 builds of their products
yet.  So for me to say that java and flash work great on my amd64 is
analagous to saying that 32-bit emulation in a 64-bit OS works great on
an amd64.  If java and flash are going to run as 32-bit binaries anyway,
why limit yourself on the other 99.99% of your distro?

A year ago, it was hard to get packages like PHP, ruby and mozilla to
work well on amd64.  These issues, and may others, have long since been
resolved.  The only laggards left are the proprietary software vendors
and OpenOffice.  The day when all packages have a 64-bit build will come
sooner if more amd64 boards get sold.  Those who choose early adoption
will have a few minor struggles, but we'll manage.  Those who choose to
wait will have 32-bit boxes that run swell.  There's room in the linux
world for both camps.  Choice is our great weapon against proprietary
software.  Let us support one another in making choices.  We have enough
people trying to limit our options.

Back to the actual topic of this thread: which netinst disk to use?
Both will work for java and flash development, though the 32-bit one
will take less effort to get working than the 64-bit one.  The choice is
entirely yours, lucky fellow.

I think what you are looking for is  SELECT DISTINCT "IPA" FROM

I don't know anything about Firewire on Linux-- USB 2.0 has a theoretical 
upper limit of 480 megabits per second, and SATA 3.0 3 gigabits per second. 
Real-world speeds are less, of course, because of Ethernet and TCP/IP 
overhead, and every piece of hardware that your bits must traverse bogs them 
down a bit. Common bottlenecks are PCI buses, because they use shared 
bandwidth, and old slow hard drives. To get the best gig-e speeds, you'll 
want nice modern everything, like PCI-e, fast hard drives and NICs, hotrod 
CPUs, and of course suitable cabling and network interfaces.

On modern PCs if all you do is use gig-e NICs, switches, and cabling, you 
should get double what you were getting with fast Ethernet.

Thanks to you and Bill. It worked. Sort of. That is, OOo didn't puke it
up. However, it didn't change the way the data is displayed in the
form. The entries are still random, and I can't figure out why. The
order in which the entries appear in the form control is not the order
in which I entered them in the database originally, not the way the
database is currently sorted, or any other way that makes any sense. I
am assuming that the sort utilities in OOo Base are really just sorting
the display; the data remains on disk in some original order. But I may
be wrong about that. I only conclude that because that's the way other
databases I have used in the past worked, plus when I have done sorts
on this database the hard disk light never came on. But who knows.

This entire form project is turning into a major PITA. It's an
experiment to see if I can create an editable PDF file with drop-down
selection boxes that students can choose an answer from. Adobe Reader
7.0 will allow the user to edit such a file and then print it out. I
have successfully exported the form to PDF from OOo and Adobe Reader
does allow edits. But I can't get the controls to display the choices
in the order I want. Also, OOo embeds the font I'm using in the
document, but not for the controls. Evidently it's not embedding any
font at all for the controls, because when Adobe Reader opens the PDF
it is substituting one of its default fonts for the font in the
controls. And the Adobe font is not IPA capable, so half the characters
are not showing up. And finally, for some reason when I change the
value in one control in the PDF document, it suddenly makes all similar
controls display the same entry. It's like they are linked somehow. I
can't figure out how they got that way or how to unlink them.

Trying to figure out which of the zillions of options in the Propery
window for the controls needs to be changed in order to solve these
problems is driving me nuts.

Interestingly enough Oracle's "Unbreakable Linux" seems to have been
built from CentOS's packages and not directly from Red Hat's.  I'm not
sure which tools you mean differ, but I'm pretty sure where it
counts--gcc, binutils--are the same versions.  I'm sure Red Hat a
considerable amount of infrastructure that goes into automating the
building and testing which CentOS doesn't have (or has different).  At
any rate, at my previous job we did a lot of work with Oracle and
WebLogic (and lots of other Java crap) running on CentOS and RHEL and
found no appreciable differences.  (Well, the differences were I didn't
have to wait for management to order my entitlements for CentOS before I
could do on-line post-installation.  These days, of course, I've
discovered that Yam can be used even to mirror from RHN, which I wish
I'd had or known about then.)

I have heard so much back and forth about the whole matter and I haven't
bothered to spend any time reading about it, so I have no idea what all
the fuss is about.

Busy week... I haven't studied the whole announcement, so I'm probably going to end up looking extremely foolish.  Oh, well, here goes...

I think you're all a little off base with what all of this means.  In the context of virtual machines, Novell is extremely interested in Xen.  Xen is most competative in para-virtualization mode, otherwise I really have to go with VMware.  

Para-virtualization requires that the guest OS is "aware" of the host OS, knows that it is running in a virtual session, and can adapt to load conditions under control of the host OS and the hypervisor.

Novell has said that Xen is market ready for shops that wish to implement NetWare/OES and SLES-10 guest OS's.  <aside>probably not as ready for Linux/OES since it remains at SLES-9 until 2nd half 2007).  Novell says specifically that proprietary closed-source OS's such as Windows wouldn't work well in a Xen environment because it cannot be adapted without the cooperation of Microsoft.

The announcement seems to be suggesting that Microsoft is willing to cooperate -- as long as their cooperation doesn't drag Windows into the GPL.

I know I should wait until I know something before I stick my virtual foot in my actual mouth, but perhaps someone on this list with knowledge of Xen could look at Novell and Microsoft's announcement through that "filter" and see if I'm crazy.

Okay... I'm crazy, regardless.

I bought it off of http://www.von-phone.com/ because it was advertised
as being Linux compatible.  It barely is.  The darn thing requires
Fedora Core 3 and even then you can't use the keypad on it.

$30 is more than a TracFone and a TracFone not only works, it sounds
better than this thing does.

http://www.von-phone.com/support.php links to the support page for this
product.

I give this product a 1/5 rating.  Big tip, it uses the OSS sound
drivers and doesn't work with Alsa.

I am as dissatisfied with this product as I was with the Intel 536EP
chipset modem that I couldn't use the voice features of under Linux.

Why do companies say works with Linux on their web sites but drop that
little note on their product cds?  Worse, why is the support inferior?
This USB device doesn't look that complicated.  Someone else could
probably do it better.

Would this be a good time to point out that Steve Gibson's review of
Vmware and Microsoft's offering favored VMware hands down?  Apparently,
Microsoft doesn't know jack about doing virtualized machines.  Every 
version of Windows, from what I can tell, has been designed to break
program compatibility.  Why support running Windows NT in a virtual
environment if you can make more money forcing companies to upgrade
to Microsoft Server 2003?

As far as the Redhat should be worried comment in the mentioned article,
why?  Redhat is in a different market than Microsoft is.  Microsoft has
no grounds to threaten Linux users with patent infringement lawsuits.
The purpose of patents is to increase public access to and fair use of
technology.  Attempting to use the patent system to create an empire is
an abuse of it and shows a lack of consideration.

For a while, I've been hoping that ReactOS will become more functional
for deskop use.  I think it would be better to prove to Microsoft and
the world that you don't need Windows, or any Windows compatible system,
to accomplish fantastic computing feats.  

Windows is not a good operating system.  Microsoft basically ignores the
Internet Engineering Task Force's every recommendation.  The registry
concept of Windows has become a monstrosity as various software vendors
and even Microsoft itself have abused it.  If the courts would get their
act together, Microsoft would be in trouble for threatening to sue Linux
users without grounds to do so.  

Isn't harassment against the law no matter how rich and powerful you
think you are?  Isn't it slanderous to lie about patent infringement
from a competitor when there isn't any infringement?  Does this strike
anyone, lying about patent infringement, as anticompetitive?

I think the response to this partnership is to generate more demand for
Linux.  If Microsoft is crazy enough to try and sue Linux users, I hope
people rise up and put Steve Ballmer in his place.  By rising up I'm
advocating: Microsoft software boycotts, helping people use alternative
software, and helping further the development of open source software
solutions.

Hi Wil, 

I realize this is old info, but this link
techworld.com/opsys/features/index.cfm?fuseaction=displayfeatures&featureid=505&page=2&pagepos=9

suggests otherwise:

"?CAos makes a general attempt at binary compatibility with RHEL,?
explains project leader Greg Kurtzer. "
snip
CAos aims to be a very different enterprise distribution, one that
visibly nods to the controversies that have dogged Red Hat?s build
practices. It ships with an older glibc and native gcc but more recent
kernels, Gnome, and Mozilla web browser. "

Thanks,
Mike

   Rightly so. Feed it garbage and it complains. There are two aggregating
commands, and the one you want is 'group by.' Try "select * from test_tickle
where field_name = 'ipa' group by 'number'". I don't know the specific SQL
dialect used by OO.o.

I echo Rich on Slackware but thats just a guttural response. It boils down
to a couple of things both of which you touched on.

A) Legality - I don't think any of us are lawyers? If you wanted to avoid
the lawsuits and IP issues associated with Linux there is also FreeBSD.

B) What are you going to use it for? From an ease of use standpoint I'd lean
towards Fedora or Ubuntu although I'm not partial to either since as
mentioned above I'm a slackware user :-) Or if you're really into getting
something that *should* be clean and a challenge you could always go linux
from scratch (http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) has been one of the things
I've wanted to get around to doing myself. Think incredibly compact
webserver.

Let us know what you decide!

Subject: [PLUG] PDF Online from Linux
Message-ID: <20061105210432.aa07baa8.johnxj@comcast.net>

Problem: Can't embed fonts in a form control on OOo Writer document
when exporting from OOo to PDF. I need an alternative PDF creator.
CUPS-PDF is pathetic. I need something really good. I am prepared to
pay. I'd even consider buying Adobe Acrobat, but it won't run under
Linux. Not even Crossover Office can install it. (I need at least
version 7.0.) I haven't tried quemu or vmware or win4lin, but I'd just
as soon not add more stuff on my computer if I can avoid it, plus I
really don't want to install Windows, even in a virtual computer.

I don't need to do this often, so an online facility sounds good to me.
Has anyone ever successfully created a PDF from a Linux computer with
one of the online PDF creation services? Alternative: Does anyone know
how to create a PostScript printer in CUPS that prints to file? I ask

Subject: [PLUG] Anyone good with LDAP?
Message-ID: <e2aeccd60611052109u5a9e9e51q7435a8cc168ea74f@mail.gmail.com>

Evening All,
I currently have a box setup using LDAP + NSS for user authentication which
is working like a charm. However I've gotten to the point where I have
enough users who want to change their password (darn users!). I used to use
a web app called LDAP Manager (http://lam.sourceforge.net) but at this point
its getting to be a chore to change user passwords for many reasons
(security being the top issue). I've found many examples on the web of ways
to write a stand-alone app using php/perl or some variant of and have
limited success it getting them to work, rolling my own has not yielded
anything workable at this point either. I've run into a problem essentially
with the application not being able to bind as the user, it can bind _only_
as the manager account. I'm loathe to allow users to change passwords while
being logged in as the manager. My hand LDAP admin book doesn't show any
ACL's which should preclude the user from auth'ing so I have no idea what
gives.

Any suggestions?

Thanks!
Drew-

Has anyone here tried LFS? I'm getting frustrated with tiny Linuxes for 
firewalls and WAPS for various reasons, and I'm thinking maybe I should just 
try to roll my own. But I don't want to get sucked into a time-eating 
project, no matter how fun it is. Got enough of those already. :)

Message-ID: <454EC0F3.4050209@verizon.net>

I have just about given up on Linux.  I feel bad about it.  Linux has
many good things going for it.  I love the KDE destkop, I love the power
of the command line, and I love the networking power it empowers me
with.  I love that it is free in both senses of the word.  But I'm
getting tired of the missing things.  Things like device drivers that
fully support a device, video and audio codecs, and games. 

I don't want to support Microsoft,  a confirmed monopoly.  But in fact
every time I buy a machine it comes with windows anyway.   I support
them against my will.

In the wireless area I have never been able to get a laptop to work well
with wireless.  I can configure it to connect to a particular network,
but I was never able to get it to scan for available networks and then
configure for one of them.  I think the problem is my wireless driver is
not complete.   Under windows this just works.

In the codec area, I am tired of having to boot windows to listen to
certain audio and video feeds.   For example I like to listen to
zefrank.com occasionally.  But I haven't been able to get it to work on
linux.  In windows this just works.

And of course the problem we are all aware of with games is that
manufacturers write for windows and don't give a care for linux.

And finally, I am getting tired of all the tinkering I have to do to
keep things working.  I might be able to fix the codec problem with
enough research, but I just don't want to do that anymore.

I am a proponent of platform independent software.   I write in Java, I
use thunderbird and firefox.  I'll continue to support platform
independence when possible.

I want Gnu/Linux and FOSS to succeed.  I hope these problems are fixed
over time.   But for now I think I'm going to switch.  Who knows, after
a while I may be so irritated by Windows and Microsoft that I'll switch
back.

Chris

Of course you will be back. :)

It will be a while, though. Several months at least, is my guess. But
you have tasted Linux and the other side will not be able to give you
what you have here. You will be back. And Linux is a patient OS. The
community will be here to welcome you back when the time comes. :)

Meantime, keep in touch.

Subject: [PLUG] lisp problem: switching packages on the fly
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0611052243230.12285@sphinktoo.pippiandcarlos.com>

Been beating my head against the monitor on this lisp problem.  Maybe
someone can help.

The following snippet of lisp code is from my web server.  I have more
than one website running in the server, and the websites have many
shared resources.  For instance, the stylesheet is identical for all the
websites, except the specific values (colors, font names, etc.).  So
each website has its own skin-config list, whereas the stylesheet
generating function itself is shared by all websites.

Each website lives in its own package.  There's a :wrlug-site, a
:jewelry-site, and a :pippiandcarlos-site presently, with more to come.
Each of these sites has its own skin-config, therefore there is a
wrlug-site:skin-config, a jewelry-site:skin-config, and a
pippiandcarlos-site:skin-config.  But there is only one function
(stylesheet-body), which lives in a parent package called :araneida-site.
:araneida-site does not use any of the aforementioned packages.  Indeed,
there would be symbol conflicts aplenty if I attempted this, since each
webapp package has many of the same symbol names, of which skin-config
is just one.  The idea is to have as many shared resources as possible,
and to be able to use these resources without having to pass around a
lot of data and functions in argument lists to make them accessible to
the shared functions.

So when I get to the point in the execution of a page where I'm calling
(araneida-site:stylesheet-body), I need to direct this function to call
upon symbols from the correct package, corresponding to the webapp the
user is in when he sent a request that caused (araneida-site:stylesheet-body)
to be called.  Ideally I would like to switch the current package to
<webapp-package>, execute the code, and (if necessary) switch back to
:araneida-site.  This seems like the cleanest way to make a single body
of code work across a bunch of packages.

This is as far as I got.  The current package does indeed change.  I can
tell this because my REPL prompt changes to the new package name.  But a
condition is signaled: "The variable SKIN-CONFIG is unbound".  However,
if I type "skin-config" in the REPL after the package change, the value of
skin-config is found, and its contents displayed.

If I cannot switch packages on the fly inside a function, I would settle
for a macro that prepends the package name to a symbol, so I could write
something like (prepend-package skin-config), and end up with
jewelry-site:skin-config in its place, though it's less desirable because
I would have to alter many lines of code to do something that should be
possible with one line at the top.

Any ideas would be appreciated.

Here's a complete code listing for a clinical test case.  The expected
output would be a CSS body{} element, with colors and font names
substituted in place of the skin-config queries.  It should be called
like:

(in-package #:araneida-site)
(stylesheet-body "jewelry-site")

So, I just typed "zefrank.com" into my web browser and clicked on "the 
SHOW" link at the top of the page.

A new page openned with a "click here to watch the show" box and when I 
clicked there, the video buffered for a second and then started playing. 
It just worked.

Of course, I have debian-multimedia.org in my apt sources and so all of my 
codecs and stuff are up to date without me ever thinking about it.

Yeah, if I were 15 and hadn't yet been discovered by girls, I would worry 
about that.  For me, it's not a problem.

Huh.  What distribution are you running?  You shouldn't have to do any 
tinkering.

Well, Java isn't exactly platform independent, is it?  I mean, it's just 
the Java platform.

Well, when you stop having to tinker with Windows to get it to do things 
like recursively rename files and directories or search for a single word 
of text in a few thousand files or update the ID3 tags of a several 
thousand MP3s based on the directories into which they've been sorted, let 
me know.  Maybe I'll switch, too.

Oh, and also when they stop thinking information is property.

Have you tried Scribus? It's a bit more like PageMaker than Acrobat, but
it might do a better job than Open Orifice (which, by the way, I detest!)

I have lots of PDF-making tools on my Gentoo box. Surely one of them
will do what you want to do. Also, are you sure you have all the fonts
you need totally installed?

I've built several systems "from scratch" (you've got to bootstrap it 
somehow, of course, so you're probably starting with a simple development 
Debian environment and then building a bootable system inside that which 
then becomes the primary system so you can delete the binary installation) 
and ran them for several years.

They were a bit of a hassle to maintain, but doing it certainly teaches 
you a lot about the system architecture and gives you respect for an 
elegant and well-ordered package management system.

> Think incredibly compact webserver.

Yeah, well, it turns out... not so much.

A bare Debian system with just the packages you'd like to have installed 
is way smaller than a "from scratch" system because you don't have any of 
the development utilities or libraries.  Also, they're faster and easier 
to build.

Given the parameters you've supplied, it sounds like you need "order
by", as in "select distinct ipa from test_table order by number."
That'd be mysql and mssql syntax. I don't know specifically about
oobase syntax. 

"Group by" is a completely different beast; that's good for things like
"select count(*), author from books order by author"; it won't do the
ordering you're asking for.

Assuming you've copied the syntax right, you'll probably want double
quotes around "number" but not around "order by." In mysql-ese, you'd
be using backticks to delineate the column names.

I don't actually _dream_ in SQL, though.

As I wrote just minutes ago, I ran LFS systems for years (back from maybe 
2000 to 2003 or so?).

They're not the tiny things you might think.  The development environment 
is kind of huge.  If you want to pare something down, you're better off 
building something inside a UML or chroot environment that is exactly what 
you need and then making an image of that and putting it on a new machine. 
No compilation required.

Huh, usually my brain is sort of good until midnight. 

Obviously this example should have been 
"select count(*), author from books group by author" (to give a list of
authors and the count of their books. You could also add " order by
author" to make it ... ordered.

My machines come in many little boxes.  None of them include windows.

As for laptops, those are a bit harder to piece together.  There are 
several vendors fighting the good fight despite the fact that the 
manufacturers aren't helping.  I would guess that maybe a thinkpad 
would be the least evil PC laptop, but maybe someone here has 
experience with the LinOS machines?  Of course, a mac can run linux 
too, especially now that it's got an x86 chip inside.  Mac had 
authorized yellow dog to resell the PPC stuff wearing Linux.  What 
other laptop manufacturers do this?

I don't do anything against my will.  Last I checked, we all enjoy that 
freedom.

They don't make money putting the OS on hard drives.  Booting it is what 
makes them a monopoly.  If you don't want to support Microsoft, then 
quit.  Don't buy software that only runs on it.  Don't buy hardware 
that only works with it.  Don't use IE, MSOffice, Etc.

I think I'd probably lean toward using CLOS (Common Lisp's most

My SQL is quite rusty, but I am suspicious about being able to order
results on a field that isn't being selected.  You might want to try
adding the "Number" field to the SELECT list.

Heck my Fedora Core "1" system worked like this.  Mplayer-plugin does it

Actually, you can probably get a LAMP stack, including a primitive GUI,
on a 128 MB stick using a compressed filesystem. Damn Small Linux was
born at 50 MB for just the kernel and desktop. I can't imagine needing
more than another 78 MB for Apache, MySQL and PHP. Now where your web
apps will store their data is another story ...

Another option for a small system would be a Gentoo "stage3" install. I
forget how big that is, but the whole toolset fits on a compressed 50 MB
business card CD. It is command-line only, though -- no GUI.

Also, there's LAMPPIX:

ORDER BY is based on the table your selecting from, not the data your
selecting.

So:
 SELECT v.Type from veggies v
 ORDER BY v.Price,v.Quantity

Would select all the data from the Type column and sort that based on
Price, then Quantity before returning the results. This is pretty much
common among all SQL servers.

I have, indeed, tried Scribus. I've used it off and on for little
things. The problem is that it is designed for desktop publishing, and
this project needs an office-type suite. To repeat the problem: I am
designing a form with drop-down buttons tied to a database for students
to select the correct answer from the contents of the field in the
database table. Adobe Reader 7.0 will allow edits of this sort in a PDF
file. The students won't be able to save a copy (although there are
workarounds), but they will at least be able to print it out for
themselves or to hand in to the professor. Scribus is a very nice app,
but it doesn't have controls that I can put on a form.

OOo has all the functionality I need, except that its export to PDF is
sort of broken. It is not embedding the font that I applied to the
controls. In fact, last night I moved my most recent PDF attempt to my
Windows desktop (where the font I used is not installed) and discovered
that OOo isn't embedding the font anywhere. It's just embedding a
pointer to it, and for the controls, not even that. Hence, when I open
the PDF on my Linux computer it displays the regular portions of the
text correctly (because the font is installed here), but for the
controls it substitutes some ugly thing that doesn't have all the IPA
characters I need. On my Windows desktop Adobe Reader substitutes the
ugly, useless font everywhere.

The controls do appear properly as a OOo document. So OOo is applying
the font correctly to the controls. It's just in the export that it's
broken. Since it appears correctly as an OOo form document, I thought
that a different PDF creation utility would be the next thing to try.
However, creating editable PDFs like this is cutting edge in the PDF
world. Adobe Reader 7.0 was the first reader that could display
editable PDFs like this. If I open my PDFs in Kpdf, Gpdf, Evince, or
anything else, the controls are just gray images -- no editing
capability. And that's a PDF that *is* editable in Adobe Reader 7.0.
The result is that I think there is no point in trying the toy PDF
creators, or anything which has had no development done on it for a
couple of years.

OOo is doing the job for me as far as the document creation goes
(although I spent the better part of a day figuring out how to create
forms with controls and how to set up the database in Base, and I've
still got a problem displaying the records in the controls in proper
sort order). It's the export to PDF function that is broken. I'm using
OOo 2.03 on my Ubuntu Dapper laptop, but I can't find the latest 2.04
in the repositories. I posted a query on the Ubuntu forums to see if
someone had figured out how to install 2.04, but no responses so far.
On the OOo website it has only an RPM for download. A couple of times
in the past I've tried to convert an RPM to a DEB with alien, but have
never been successful. It's a long shot, and there's no way to tell if
the problem has been fixed in 2.04 anyway -- at least scouring the OOo
forums has not turned up anything on point.

I'd just go buy Acrobat 7.0 or 8.0 (previous versions can't create
editable PDFs), but there's no way to get it to run on Linux, except
maybe with vmware or qemu. I don't really want to install a whole extra
OS on this computer. Adobe also has an online PDF creator but, of
course, it only supports Microsoft and Adobe products. However, it will
also create a PDF from a PostScript print file, and that is what I am
investigating next. I need to figure out how to install a driver that
will print to file instead of to a printer through the network or a
port or something. I gave up last night about 11:00 when my eyes
refused to focus any more. Now it's morning and I'm back to work on the
problem.

Thanks for the suggestions. I'm sure there's a way to do it on Linux.
It's just a question of finding the right tools.

The first thing I did was to observe the syntax that OOo Base used to
select the data from the "IPA" table. It was

SELECT DISTINCT "IPA" FROM "Test_Table"

Observing the above, I decided to wing it in the hopes that I could get
it right. I appended "SORT ON" to the above:

SELECT DISTINCT "IPA" FROM "Test_Table" SORT ON "Number"

But OOo Base puked that up. Hey, I'm not a programmer. "SORT ON" is the
way I would say it. All the programmers I know love to tell me how
modern programming languages are easy because they're English-like.
Well, evidently, programming languages do not enjoy a vocabulary as
large as mine.

So I asked here and, after a couple people responded, I changed it to
"ORDER BY." That seemed to satisfy OOo Base. No error messages. But it
also didn't work. The records in the IPA field are displayed in the
control, but still in the strange random order as before. Since there
are 105 records,  students will have to scroll up and down to find the
correct answer, so having them in a logical order is important.

Later I discovered that if you select a control in the OOo form,
right-click on it and then on Form (instead of Control), it changes the
property window and you have a place where you can select the sort
order. This is a different box frrom the Select box, in fact, it is on
a different tab. It had a "..." button to the right, which popped up a
list of the fields in Test_Table. I selected the Number field, and
happily concluded that I had finally found the right button to get it
to work. I also deleted the ORDER BY from the entry in the Data tab.
Sadly, it still does not work. No error messages; it just doesn't work.
The records are still displayed in the control in the same strange
random order.

I also subscribe to a User e-list for OOo and I posted the problem
there. Unfortunately, I use my Hotpop account for that e-list, and
Hotpop has occasional bouts of constipation, followed by diarrhea. At
the moment it's in constipation mode, so even my own post has not
appeared in my inbox. I'm hoping that I will eventually get a response
there that will lead me to the solution.

Games.  One of the reasons I run Linux is that I have a semi-
addictive personality, and games would suck up entirely too much
of my life that I would rather use productively.  There are just
too many positive things that I can do, and need doing, and not
enough hours to do them in.   So games get erased on my machines,
and if the urge becomes overpowering I actually firewall off some
game websites so I can resist temptation.

Most of you are younger than me, and grew up with computer and
video games, and perhaps some of you have spent thousands of hours
on them.  So how does the thrill of winning a video game compare
to completing a small program, or finding a bug, or building a
cabinet, or playing music with friends, or some other small task
with a defined result?  Does game playing scratch the same itch?
For me, game playing is almost self-destructive, it is the 
internal brat fighting against the outwardly successful adult.

The one gamelike addiction I permit myself is Sudoku puzzles out
of the paper, but even there it was more satisfying to write a
solver in Perl (which has solved every puzzle so far, though a
16x16 5 star from the Oregonian takes almost a minute to solve
by machine, and hours by hand).  Still, that is time taken away
from other things.

The reason there are so few games for Linux may be because Linux,
and creativity in general, are much more engaging games.  Perhaps
if we developed some game-like debugging tools, then the young
folk spending kilo-hours looking for monsters in mazes could be
looking for buffer overflows instead.

This quotation is about cAos, not CentOS.  Your snip left out an
important detail:

"While the core is similar to CentOS, ..."

I don't actually have a real RHEL system to check with, but CentOS 3.8
(equivalent to RHEL3 Update 8) is built with:

I'm with Russell on this.  ORDER BY is looking at the result set,
not the original table.  If you don't select something, you can't
ORDER BY it.

As an indication of that, I often use "ORDER BY 2" to order by the second
column of the result rows.

At least in standard SQL.  We're not talking about the seriously dainbramaged
MySQL here.  (Hint: please stop using MySQL... PostgreSQL is far more standard
and useful and scaleable.)

At least PostgreSQL tells you that you can't order by something that you
haven't selected or computed.  MySQL breaks again by letting you ask for
something that you aren't getting, but not telling you about it.

Assuming you're talking about OpenLDAP, then you need this as part of
your ACLs:

access to attr=userPassword
    by self write
    by anonymous auth

Well based on what you have said, I would chalk this one up as an issue
with OOo forms. With most development, even if your selecting data from
a source such as a DB and your sorting the returning data in SQL, you
cant be sure that the order will be maintained in the language/data
structure that storing it for future use. 

I have absolutely no experience with OOo Base so I'm afraid I cannot be
of much help there. But if OOo does keep the order of the data returned
from the DB then the ORDER BY clause is what you want, even if its not
working now it is the standard way or sorting results in SQL, remember
it.

I know this is going to sound like a dumb question, but I am going to
ask anyways. 

Have you googled around a little? 

Good Luck
-Mark

The only time the ORDER BY Clause is limited to the result set is when
your using a SELECT DISTINCT <COLUMN NAME>, other wise you have access
to any tables used in the query.

"SQL in a Nutshell" p146 says, "All implementations discussed here [SQL
Server, MySQL, Oracle & PostgreSQL] also allow the use of ordinal
positions in the /ORDER_BY/ clause."

By the way, why is it that every time I upgrade PostgreSQL I have to
dump and restore my tables?

Wil,

   A dump 'n' restore should be necessary only with a major upgrade. If
you're upgrading from 8.1.4 to 8.1.5, for example, you can do it without
disturbing the dust on the data. However, upgrading from 7.x to 8.x includes
disk storage format changes that require data to be dumped from the old
format and restored to the new format.

Check "print to file" when you print.  That generates a postscript file.
I do that a lot, and use ps2pdf to make a PDF out of it.

In fact, I generally "print to file" the receipt-pages from e-payments
and then convert those to PDF in bulk whenever they start to use too
much disk space.

Going the other way, note that pdftops and pdf2ps work rather
differently from each other.

Are the fonts marked as "non-embedable"?  Some fonts have restrictions 
in the font file that prevents them from being embedded in documents. 
(For anything that pays attention to the flag.)

Either you need to find a font without that flag set or be a scofflaw and 
reset the flag yourself.

Actually there are few "new" games for Linux.

There are thousands of old ones that run under emulation.

I spent about 5 minutes making an old copy of "Sam and Max Hit the Road" 
run under Fedora Core 5 on my daughter's machine.  Works great.

I thought that was only usable in DB2.  I guess not.

Well said Keith. I think you hit the nail on the head. I play games but I do
so as a distraction from writing code, debugging said code and generally
trying to learn more about Linux then I do about how to get the latest gun
in Unreal Tournament.

OOo embeds the font for the entire document, but not for the controls
in the document. The controls are the problem. At least, I think it is
embedding it for the rest of the document. As for the font, it is
Junicode, an open source font. 

As far as I can tell so far, the problem is a bug in the OOo export to
PDF utility.

Ah! I had seen that box before and never used it. Much easier than
trying to create a print-to-file driver in CUPS. 

However, there is bad news. The printer I used to print to file is a
Laserjet 5SiMx (just like the one at Free Geek). It has genuine Adobe
PostScript Level 2. I printed a paper copy of the form on this printer
and it came out fine. So I uploaded the .ps file to Adobe's online
conversion utility. It worked great. (You get five free trials, so it
didn't cost me anything.) I downloaded the finished PDF, which Adobe
had cleverly set to open automatically in Adobe Reader. (It also
downloaded and opened a PDF announcing how I would enjoy a improved sex
life and become richer than Bill Gates, if only I would buy Acrobat.)

Ignoring the advertising PDF, I looked eagerly at the PDF of my file.
It looked perfect, except no controls. It was not an editable PDF file
at all. 

I repeated the process, except this time I printed to file while in
"design mode" in OOo Writer. Same results.

I e-mailed Adobe support, but I bet it's a lost cause. I noticed while
uploading the .ps file that I could choose the PDF version -- Acrobat
3.0, 4.0 or 5.0. No Acrobat 7.0 or 8.0. I think the ability to create
editable PDFs came in with Acrobat 7.0. Just a guess, but one of the
issues with editable PDFs is DRM stuff. I bet Adobe didn't want to make
editable PDFs available online.

After sleeping on the problem, I think I already agree that my approach
is not the best.  Before going on at length on how I intend to solve
this, I want to actually see it work first.  Stay tuned for an update,
and hopefully an elegant, lispy solution.  Hint: it will involve
fetching the shared function (stylesheet-body) as a data object (instead
of calling it like I am now), and funcalling it from within the right
package space.

Subject: [PLUG] Xvfb experience
Message-ID: <454FCEF5.2070705@acm.org>

Does anyone have experience using Xvfb?

We have found a Windows application that does just what we need, has 
command line version and runs via Wine.

It would be called by a Catalyst ( mod_perl ) application.  The problem 
is wine doesn't like not having $DISPLAY/ X Server and throws lots of 
error messages.  The application works fine but we don't need the cruft 
in the logs.  So the idea is we could use Xvfb.  Only problem is I've 
never used it.

So the questions arise!  Can apache -- the user -- access 'X', and 
how/where do I start Xvfb?

OF course the ideal situation would be to tell wine to shut up and not 
worry about the display.  Hum ... maybe I should check if that can be done.

Anyway, in the mean time, and thoughts; ideas, or pointers would be great.


TIA,
Rod

Try this command:

   strings [kernel file] | head -20

For 2.4 and 2.6 kernel files to which I currently have access, the

Subject: [PLUG] Error reading block xxxx
Message-ID: <454FCDB5.8050903@comcast.net>

We went away for a week, so I shut down all the hardware in the house.
Upon our return, most of it started back up. My old 200 MHz machine
running RH 7.0 reports a problem. After saying something to the effect
that the filesystem hadn't been checked in a very long time (this
machine ordinarily stays running) I got the following:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Error reading block 257756 (Attempt to read block from filesystem
resulted in short read) while reading indirect blocks of inode 98117.
NEC40GB: UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY; RUN fsck MANUALLY (i.e., without -a
or -p options)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Then I was given the option of entering root's password or <ctrl>d to do
a normal boot, again.

First I tried to get away with a normal boot again. Didn't work. One
nice thing is that the error repeated with the same message as the first
time. So, I followed the directions. I logged in as root and was given
the prompt:

(Repair filesystem) 1#:

I ran man fsck, less /etc/fstab, and then:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
(Repair filesystem) 1#:fsck LABEL=NEC40GB

Parallelizing fsck version 1.18 (11-Nov-1999)
e2fsck 1.18, 11-Nov-1999 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
NEC40GB contains a file system with errors, check forced.
Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

That was over an hour ago, and the screen hasn't changed. I realize it's
a 40GB drive and only a 200MHz processor, but shouldn't I see something
to indicate progress?

I suspect that I could edit fstab to prevent the 40GB drive from being
mounted during boot, but what would I do after that?

Recommended reading on diagnosing and repairing damaged file systems
would be appreciated.

In case anyone's wondering why RH 7.0, that's the machine that has it's
sound card wired to the stereo in the living room. The last time I tried
upgrading to a later version of the OS, I ran into latency problems that
would not go away. I have since read on the mpg123 web site that they
have made improvements that might solve this problem. Meanwhile, I've
been happy to live with the old OS, since this machine sits inside the
hardware firewall with NAT, so should be invisible to the rest of the world.

Old Man Knoppix might be your best friend once again.  You'd be better
off running a fsck when the root filesystem hasn't been involved in the
bootup.  Booting from a CD is ideal for situations like these.  Plus,
the version of fsck will be newer (if your knoppix disk isn't as old as
your RH7 load).

It's been a looonnng time since I used ext2, but I seem to remember that
you have to pass a switch to get verbose output.

Sounds like a good idea. The disk the OS is on is not the one with the
problem, but I can download and burn a Knoppix CD and have new tools to
work with.

A switch to fsck? Is fsck what I need to read up on?

Actually, try e2fsck first.  It is a wrapper for fsck.  It can run
badblocks for you too.

Games are also one of the best ways to shake out the bugs in an X

I DID IT!!!!

I've spent nearly two whole days on this project, which I thought might
take two or three hours when I started it. :(  Lots of learning
required, mostly figuring out OOo.

To refresh memories, I'm trying to create an editable PDF using OOo
Writer form controls. I have created a test document with drop-down
combo boxes, check boxes, radio buttons, and a text box. The drop-down
combo boxes are tied to various fields in a database, and that's where
one of the maddening problems cropped up. I couldn't get one of the
fields to display in properly sorted order. I spent hours trying to
figure out why -- the order in which records appeared was random. The
records in this field are IPA characters, mostly just one character. At
first I thought it might be sorting on Unicode #. But half an hour of
checking revealed that it was not in decimal or hex order (by Unicode
decimal or hex number). 

I tried all kinds of SQL statements, and all kinds of fiddling with the
GUI pop properties window for the controls, but nothing worked. 

Finally I noticed that in the GUI Properties box for "Type of list
content" it offered "table," "tablefields," "query," "sql," and
"sql-native." You're supposed to select one of these, then enter the
syntax in the box immediately below it. I thought I had tried them all,
but evidently I had not tried "query." I did so, and the box below
suddenly developed a drop-down button. But nothing was listed in it.
Thinking quickly, I realized that the database window I had open
elsewhere on the desktop had a button to display queries. I went there
and discovered there were options to create a query by "design view" or
by SQL statement (kinda sick of SQL right now). I clicked on design
view and up popped a window that I swear the OOo people stole lock,
stock and barrel from Microsoft Access. Now I was on familiar
territory! If you haven't seen these little GUI query design windows,
they are way easy for a non-programmer to create queries. Basically,
the window is a front end to create an SQL query. (In fact, in Access
you can toggle back and forth from design view to SQL view.) I should
also add that if OOo did some robbing, it's fair, because Microsoft
stole the idea from Borland, who called it Query By Example, and made
it a top selling point for Paradox.

I quickly selected my IPA field in the first column, and the Numbers
field in the second. I hit the checkbox for the Numbers field to make
it not visible, and then I hit the drop-down to tell the query to sort
ascending on the Numbers table. I saved my query, and went back to the
control properties popup window. Lo and behold, "Query1" showed up as an
option. I selected it, saved the form, and hit the button to return to
user view. Then I clicked on the drop down button for the control I had
changed and -- there were all my IPA characters sorted in the proper
order! Yay!!!

I don't know why I didn't find that query design thingy before, but now
that I know it's there, making other forms will be much easier. I've
written queries for all the other controls and fixed all of them. The
form is working perfectly now!

However, I still have one show-stopper problem remaining. When I export
to PDF the font I set the controls to is not getting embedded. My last
hope for that is GhostScript. If I can't get GhostScript to create the
PDF form correctly, I'll have to buy Acrobat 7 or 8, install it on my
Windows desktop, and move this operation there. Gack. I want this to be
a Linux-only thing.

Much thanks to all who helped earlier with the SQL stuff!

Message-ID: <200611062044.20684.carla@bratgrrl.com>

hey all,

How small can you make a Gentoo installation? I want to roll my own 
firewall/WAP/router Linux, and I want it to be as small as possible, and to 
be easily customizable and upgradeable. Which sounds like Gentoo, does it not? 
Pyramid Linux, Pebble, and other WAP Linuxes weigh in from 50-128 megabytes. 
How does Gentoo compare? Here's a sample feature list:

-iptables
-openvpn
-support only for installed devices
-openssh
-stunnel
-dnsmasq
-maybe some kind of public WAP frontend like Wifidog or nocat auth
-ntpd
-the usual gnu tools and essential system administration tools, some 
net tools

I want to keep it under 64 megabytes.

thanks!

Gentoo will never be a small-footprint distro because of the portage
tree.  I put a minimal installation on a 3.2GB hard drive once. It fit
until I added X and mozilla.  That put it over the top.  A similar
debian box could probably squeeze into a gig and a half or less.

I suppose you could get it built up and then delete all the portage
directories.  As long as you didn't run any emerge commands, it might
not blow up.  But if you forgot a package and had to emerge it, you'd be
in for a bummer time.

It's hard to imagine any desktop distro going this small.  What about
busybox?  Gentoo has busybox embedded in it, probably for bootstraping
purposes.  It comes on practically every consumer appliance router.

it can't because it needs (like any source distro, see e.g. others like lunar-linux.org 
or sourcemage.org) gcc and a rather complete set of headers and tools.

Anything under 500mb (not gentoo, but a really lightweight source distro like lunar) is 
an accomplishment, allthough these source distro's are rather easy to minimize and 
maintain manually (compile on a remote machine, and install sort of slackware-ish.... 
hey slackware, now that was a small distro).

If you really want to have a single maintainable source distro, you'd be looking at 
about 400mb minimal easily. Anything under that is pure occupational therapy.

Cheers

This is probably a flaw on the media surface that showed up over
your vacation.  If there are some marginal disk blocks that are
constantly being re-written on the disk, they may unwrite themselves
if the disk is idle long enough.  The fsck badblocks commands that
others talk about should fix it. 

However, you should be aware that leaving a machine on for a long
long time, then turning it off for a couple of weeks, then turning
it on, can sometimes uncover hardware failures.  For example, many
chips are covered with plastic, and can get very hot while running. 
This can cause the plastic to deform over time, opening up gaps. 
The hot chips tend to evaporate moisture in the gaps, but if the
room gets cool and damp over the turnoff time, moisture creeps into
the gaps in the chip plastic and causes failures.  The failures will
happen, someday, anyway.  They just tend to exhibit themselves
during the turn-on after an absence.  

The bottom line is, if you turn your machines off for a couple of
weeks here in the NorthWet, allow some time to repair them afterwards.
By all means, turn them off when you aren't using them, leaving them
on means they will fail sometime during use instead.  Just budget the
time for restores from backups or replacement of some hardware.  If
everything works, get some extra sleep!

No, it doesn't.  Gentoo is not small at all and, while not particularly 
difficult to upgrade, wouldn't be in the list of "easiest" distributions 
to manage.

If you're not happy with any of the existing tiny distributions, you might 
consider (as I suggested before) setting up a subdirectory on your box and 
putting in only exactly what you want.  You can test it by making a chroot 
environment or UML and running your programs inside.  After you've 
determined exactly what you want in terms of applications, you can start 
over again with source and build only those libraries and utilities that 
you need with only the functionality you need.  Strip all the executables 
and you might have something.

To me, it seems like an enormous hassle for very little gain.  You can 
build a business card-sized Debian system that is apt-upgradeable and 
quite reasonably small with almost none of that other effort.  Do a bare 
install and deselect everything but the required base packages and then 
just add one package at a time until you have what you want.  Should be 
well within the size range of cheap flash memory.

Like others have said, gcc, the associated libraries, and utilities
for building things bumps
this up way too high.  Now you could host your build and distro on
anything and just
export the resultant code without package management.
Here are some build systems that I would look at.
buildroot
openwrt or DD-wrt

If you're not opposed to using off the shelf hardware like a linksys WAP
then you can get the firmware that is linux based. I've been running it for
a few months now and love it.

Along this same train of thought, I wonder how small it would be if you 
simply installed debian on a chroot with several throwaway mounts in 
it?  /usr/include, /usr/share/man, and /usr/share/doc come to mind.  
While it wouldn't be as small as possible, it would certainly be easy 
to maintain (guess you could even have gcc and such if you installed 
them in /usr/local -- and maybe it would even work for gentoo.) (hmm. 
stow?)  Anyone seen this done before?

Just a warning, nocatauth depends on perl, so it probably isn't a good
choice for a small install.  Nocatsplash is small, C-based and
self-contained.  PTP is considering migrating to wifidog, though it
behaves a little differently than we are used to.

And frankly, I think you'd be better off just getting comfortable with
pyramid or pebble or one of those.  Stand on the shoulders of, er,
taller, less-lazy people.  Adding packages to pyramid from ubuntu is
pretty easy.  I added bridgeutils at one point and it took about 15
minutes to finish, bumps-and-all (damn you to hell, libsysfs!)  You
can build a chroot environment that makes building from source easy
and fast (on your desktop hardware), then copy to your image and away
you go.

not worth the hassle. /usr/bin and /usr/lib (and the non-/usr/ brothers of those) are 
already quite huge on modest systems. On my box this accounts for 1.5gb, but even on the 
most minimal system I work with (our source distro's (lunar) installer ISO build), we 
are already at 102mb (!) [[the entire build system is about 360mb, of which about half 
is compressed packages]].

So much for being absolutely minimal.

If you really want minimal, the only real option still feasible for ordinary distro's is 
nfsroot or similar, and just move all requirements off to a different storage system.

Cheers,

Auke

Oh goody!  I get to be Santa Claus for Carla!

Because you've been Sooo GOOOD this year young lady, you get to find
out about EWRT, sponsored by our fine friends at Portless Networks.

http://www.portless.net/menu/ewrt/

Which, if you have one of the appropriate older versions of the Linksys
WRT54G or WRT54GS wireless access points, or one of the new ...GL versions,
you can crosscompile and upload into the unit.

Other options involve older versions of the Netgear WGT634U, which have
USB host support and allow you to add all sorts of other goodies.  That
busy elf, PLUG's own Russell Senior (russell mumble personaltelco mumble
net), built something called a bike stumbler which he has heavily hacked
to log wireless access points onto a USB key, with GPS information, while
he rides his bicycle around.  Way cool.  So there is more than one kind
of unit that you can do these hacks on.

So you can get it all done with a $50 WAP, and some specialized distros
designed to download into them.  If you want to add features that aren't
already in the extensive list of customizations these folks are working
with, you will at least be 95% of the way there.  And since the one thing
they are lacking is somebody to /write up/ their endeavors for mass
publication, you can be Santa Claus for them, too!

I have used Xvfb for Java web apps which were using AWT graphics
before they introduced headless mode.

You start the server like this: "Xvfb :1". Then use :1 as the DISPLAY.
You can either start it before the app or as a separate service. It
uses the normal X security. I think that by default it doesn't use any
authentication so any local user can connect. If not, you can use
"xhost" to allow access.

Thanks Ian.

This sound good and doable for our needs.  The "user" will be apache so 
there will probably be some $HOME issues in addition to the possible 
authentication issues.

Message-ID: <20061107122806.e3de4755.johnxj@comcast.net>

Back when I used Windows 2000 I had Norton File Manager, which had FTP
capability. You could just put the FTP address in an entry and you
could drag and drop files to/from the FTP site. It would even prompt
for a password if necessary, and save the password if you wanted it to.

I need to set up a web site as a student at PSU. I've read the
instructions and it says to transfer by FTP to
odin.pdx.edu/~johj/public_html. Presumably that folder is already
there; created when I set up my Odin account a long time ago. 

I've created the website with OOo (really simple little website, just
needed for people to download a couple things). Now I need to FTP the
files to PSU. I tried Konqueror, but couldn't get it to work. Is there
a simple little GUI FTP transfer utility I can install that will make
these things easy for GUI-addicted folx? Or if it is easier by command
line, can someone give me a hint about what commands I need to learn?

This ubuntu forum thread looks like a good place to find info:

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=269266

It looks like Nautilus (the Gnome file manager) has support for ftp.

Thanks. I tried Nautilus, but couldn't figure out how to get it to
work. However, searching on "ftp" in Synaptic turned up gftp, which
seems to have gotten the job done.

Now I need to figure out why I get "forbidden" when I try to browse to
http://www.pdx.edu/~johj. That's what the instructions say my website
address is supposed to be. Can you try going there and see if it's just
me, or are you refused access also?

Konqueror works fine with odin. Note that the OIT machines use
SFTP, not plain FTP. In the Konqueror location bar, you'd enter
"sftp://jjj at odin.pdx.edu/home/jjj/" (replacing "jjj" with whatever
your actual username is). It'll ask you for your password, and then
take you to your homedir.

If you really want minimal and not have to rely on a remote file
system, a common approach is to build a custom kernel image (with no
frills--nothing but what you need), and a basic complement of
libraries and utilities based on a pared-down glibc and BusyBox. Such
a system can easily fit in less than 4 MB of storage. It won't do all
that much, but it will qualify as a mostly full-fledged Linux system.
If you want to add other fancy stuff like servers and such, you'll
likely need more space.

http://www.busybox.net/

Check out the handhelds.org site for a good example of what can be
squeezed into a small amount of flash RAM (32 MB, in their case). They
host the Familiar Linux distribution, which is meant for PDAs such as
the iPaq.

http://www.handhelds.org/

For a turnkey cross-toolchain, I like the Embedded Linux Development
Kit (ELDK). It includes kernel source for various PowerPC and ARM
targets, and also ships with ramdisk images for both (meaning you
don't even have to bother building your own filesystem, just the
kernel image).

You'll need to chmod the files once they are uploaded. You  ftp'd the files
to the public_html directory correct? If you have then  there's a right
click option I believe in gftp to change the permissions. You need read
access for world in order for the webserver to serve it up properly.

Message-ID: <E8F9B6C95BD88C46B8FABB9503DB7C85633520@mse1be1.mse1.mailstreet.com>

Hi all,

I'm conducting a study for a Harvard Business School professor on the
costs associated with migrations between different Linux distributions,
and I am looking for companies that have undergone a migration like
this.  Does anyone have any contacts for IT professionals at large
companies (1000+ full time employees) who have migrated from one Linux
distribution to another?  I can provide an honorarium of $200 to the
company IT individuals willing to participate in the study.  It will
involve a 30 to 45-minute phone conversation.  I am not looking for
external consultants who have done migrations, but specifically someone
who works for a large company that has undergone a Linux migration.
Thank you for any advice or assistance.

 

Amy

   I know that a number of folks here are fluent in python, but I need some
help specifically with wxPython. Is there anyone here with the experience
(other than Robin Dunn who's over-committed as it is) and willingness to
directly answer questions when I cannot find answers in the API docs, the
book. or Google?

   If so, please contact me off the list. Right now I have a derived dialog
class that generates no python errors when the application is invoked, but
it won't pop up when called.

Err, ok.  My debian webserver (no X) has them at 121MB, and that's with 
php, mysql, vim, subversion, gcc, and a bunch of other stuff that I was 
suggesting could be built in /usr/local and/or managed by juggling 
symlinks.  Maybe it's still too much hassle to get down to minimal that 
way, but it's definitely not 1.5GB from a bare install.

Maybe the debian packages could be rebuilt to put build-requires stuff 
in /usr/local and run-requires stuff in /usr/.  Possibly easier to take 
this approach with Gentoo.

You don't really need an nfsroot if you're "booting" for maintenance 
from a chroot with the fun maintenance stuff mounted in from elsewhere 
(or even mounted as-needed on a big usb drive on the production box 
(i.e. the maintenance environment could be shared amongst many wee 
boxen.)  Maybe nonsense.  Oh well.

Hmm.  I can't get the above to compile.  Perhaps it isn't indented

Let's just say that I had you in mind as a hopeful, Russell.  You did
get me thinking that package manipulation was not necessarily the answer
for this problem.  You were right.  I guess the java programmer in me
was looking for a stack of nouns to throw at the problem, when a verb
was clearly needed.

Instead of trying to call the function directly, making it execute
within the :araneida-site package, and have it try to call back into the
place where I should have stayed all along, I do it the lisp way, which
is to fetch the function as data and run it in the context of the
:jewelry-site package.  This way, the compiler does not try to compile
the function as a top-level form, since it is just data.  Therefore, the
function can contain anything at all.  Its contents only get evaluated
at the moment the function is actually called.

(defpackage #:jewelry-site
   (:use #:cl
         #:araneida-site))

(in-package #:jewelry-site)

I have KimDaBa 2.1 installed.  My son sent me a pile of photos together with an

to import the pictures I get an error message which says "Export file did not

have to kill KimDaBa to get rid of this message.

I found one year-old posting of someone getting the same message, but he got no

Anybody have any words of wisdom?

Yeah. I totally hate useless graphics and junk on a website.

JJJ,

Your site opened fine for me in Firefox v1.5.0.7 on SuSE 10.0, IE
v6.0.2900.2180 on Windows XP SP2, and Firefox 1.0.7 on Windows XP SP2
(Ok guys....I run Windows XP for work because it's required!)

All four files were available for downloading by right-clicking.
Obviously, I couldn't open the OOo stuff on Windows XP.

The site was clearly readable on all systems (i.e., Good fonts / nice
contrast on the colors). You might want to see if it's fully
validated.....(http://validator.w3.org/check) and then post the logo if
it passes.

Hope that helps.

Tim

Have your son repeat the export operation? Kimdaba offers a few
different options on how to handle images during export (e.g., include
them in the .kim file, create a directory structure that sits
alongside the .kim file, etc.).

What version of Kimdaba is he using? It's possible there's some
incompatibility if it's an older version. Note that Kimdaba changed
its name to KPhotoAlbum as of v2.2.

We are both using 2.1.  We can try again, but transferring the files takes a 
very long time.  We can do some tests, short of sending the entire collection. 
Good idea.

I have no way of knowing if 2.2 would help, and I cannot find a packaged 
kPhotoAlbum.

I burned a copy of Knoppix V 5.0 and tried to boot the machine with
that. Unfortunately, the machine claims it couldn't find the CD, even
though during the first moments of the boot process the BIOS reported
the 44x CD drive to be present. Thinking I might have made another
coaster, I tried the CD in my laptop: it boots just fine.

I can think of two options at this point:

1. Edit fstab and remove the reference to the second hard drive (the one
with the problem), let the machine boot, and then run e2fsck -c locally.

or

2. Pull the second hard drive from that machine, put it in this machine
and run e2fsck -c here.

Any good reason to choose 2 over 1? It appears that 1 would be easier
than 2. The machine with the problem drive is in the basement, and I
have to stand on a chair to work on it. Once booted, though, I can ssh
into it from my office, and that would be easier than taking apart two
machines, and then putting them back together.

Option #1 sounds dandy, except for the old fsck version factor.

There is another option.  Use a knoppix 4.0 disk.  I find that 5.0 is a
little bit sucky.  For one thing, I've seen it fail to boot on some
machines, where a 4.0 disk works.  Another problem with 5.0 is that it
automounts your hard drive partitions read-only.  Why did they decide
that was a good idea?

I cannot find a knoppix 4.0 iso for you, unfortunately.  I wonder if a
gentoo install disk might have the necessary tools.

I found a knoppix 4.0 iso on my work machine.  It is being copied to my
web server at home as we speak.  Looks like the time remaining is all
over the place, ranging from 1:00 to 5:00 left, depending on the speed
at the moment.  When it is done, you are welcome to download it from
http://mirror.wrlug.org/knoppix/ .  I'm no datacenter, so don't expect a
zippy download.

Hello. I am new to this group.
    I have bits and pieces of experiance with Linux, and am still quite 
shaky about using it on my main machine.
    I met some of you at the Lucky Lab brewpub, where you told me about

    Here I am. I am willing to play with Ubuntu, given the abundance of

I'm downloading it (to my laptop, which has a burner) as I type. 2:37:59
remaining, and rising! I'll check it again later this evening. Thanks
for making it available.

Meanwhile, since I had things set up anyway, I ssh-ed into the basement
machine and started looking around. First:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root at nec /]# fdisk /dev/hdb

Unable to open /dev/hdb
------------------------------------------------------------------------

then:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root at nec /dev]# e2fsck -V
e2fsck 1.18, 11-Nov-1999 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
        Using EXT2FS Library version 1.18, 11-Nov-1999
------------------------------------------------------------------------

followed by:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root at nec /dev]# e2fsck -c /dev/hdb
e2fsck 1.18, 11-Nov-1999 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
e2fsck: Device not configured while trying to open /dev/hdb
Possibly non-existent or swap device?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is what fstab looked like before I removed the entry for the second
drive:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root at nec /etc]# cat 061108-fstab
LABEL=/              /                       ext2    defaults        1 1
LABEL=/boot          /boot                   ext2    defaults        1 2
/dev/cdrom           /mnt/cdrom              iso9660 noauto,owner,ro 0 0
/dev/fd0             /mnt/floppy             auto    noauto,owner    0 0
LABEL=NEC40GB        /mnt/mp3                ext2    defaults        1 2
none                 /proc                   proc    defaults        0 0
none                 /dev/pts                devpts  gid=5,mode=620  0 0
/dev/hda2            swap                    swap    defaults        0 0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

LABEL=NEC40GB identifies the second drive. I'm assuming it's hdb because
hdc is the cdrom drive.

Besides waiting for Knoppix v4 (it's now at 2:49:00 and dropping!), what
do I do next? I found a brief explanation of "LABEL=" at:

http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/Fstab

which told me more than I knew before, but didn't tell me if that
information was something I could make use of in some way in this situation.

Hi,

I think I remember you from the Lab. (See, if you say "sorry I was late
honey, I was busy at the lab" you might actually get away with it. OK,
probably not. But it's worth a shot.)

You could download and burn the live/install CD from Ubuntu and then
use it to boot your computer. Or you could wait until Sunday the 19th
when we will have our next Clinic at Free Geek. I will be there, and
there will be copies of the live/install CD, and there will even be
cookies.

   Alternatively, go to Powell's Tech Book store or the local library and get
a book that gives a generic background on linux. Not distribution-specific,
but an introduction to the philosophy and structure of the OS.

   Learn what filesystems are, how there are little tools to do specific
things (but thousands of those little tools), what is meant by multi-tasking
and multi-user, the differences between working on a console and within the
X Window System.

   An overview can make it a lot easier to understand the what and why.

To really be sure what drives your system can see and what they are
called, do an "fdisk -l".

Googling for "fsck device not configured" is coming up with scant
pickings, but none of them are overwhelmingly good.  The partition table
is suspect.

"Device not configured" must be a message thrown by a low- or kernel-level
task.  It comes up for all sorts of hardware problems.  Most likely, it
means that there is no kernel driver support for the device.  If you
have one IDE drive working and another one that doesn't, this
explanation doesn't jive.  Maybe the drive has become a total goner.

I'd get that knoppix 4.0 disk in there and see if a newer version of
fsck.ext2 will help.

In my readings of man fdisk I ran into a reference to /proc/partitions.
It lists hda and hdd. Then I remembered that the second drive is the
slave on the controller that also has the cdrom drive, hdc.

The numbers for hdd don't seem encouraging compared to hda.

The superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2
filesystem.  If the device is valid and it really contains an ext2
filesystem (and not swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock
is corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate superblock:
    e2fsck -b 8193 <device>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I get the same results running e2fsck -b 8193.

50:21 remaining. I hope you're right about the newer version helping.

Thanks for YOUR help.

And if you don't have time (or access in some cases) to a library, check
out the online documentation at "The Linux Documentation Project."  It's
available at http://www.tldp.org.

There's some really good (and not so good stuff) there.  Browse through
and see if there's anything that would be nice to start with.

I'm partial to NAG (The Network Administrator's Guide), SAG (the System
Administrator's Guide) and LAME (Linux Administration Made Easy).  But
they all expect a little bit of knowledge (and are a little dated).

There's also "Introduction to Linux - A Hands on Guide" but I haven't look
at it yet, and the "Bash Guide for Beginners."  Those are both at
http://www.tldp.org/guides.html

Welcome to the source...

Message-ID: <20061108235354.55d2f825.johnxj@comcast.net>

I'm sure someone here has done this. I have some sound files in WMA
format. I need to open them in Audacity. Audacity does open them, but
plays just static. I can play them in Windows Media Player (thanks to
Crossover office), but I need Audacity's ability to slow them down.
Audacity's Help files don't actually say what formats it can open. But
from experience, I know it can open WAV and AIFF. I'll try anything,
however. Does anyone have experience with converting WMA to something
more open source that Audacity might be able to capiscere? If so, what?

Weren't you just five or six seats over from me at Bill Barry's excellent 
talk about mplayer a couple of months ago?

He covered all kinds of audio and video conversion.

If mplayer can play it, it can convert it to something else.

And what the hell does "capiscere" mean?

Dick,

   I don't recall the reason why this is a bad idea, but rejumper the drives
so the hard drive is the master and the cdrom drive is the slave. You -- and
the kernel -- will be accessing the hard drive much more frequently than the
cdrom drive.

   A number of years ago I had drives set up as you do and had some problems
with them (I don't recall just what they were). Swapping the master and
slave fixed everything.

I like it. It could be the name of a six-dollar confectioner's coffee,
or maybe it's a sub-minor diety from the Roman Pantheon; some forgotten girl

   I think it's the name for Starbucks' smallest cup of house coffee.

Subject: [PLUG] Postfix copy all inbound and outbound messages
Message-ID: <45534F40.7070106@acm.org>

I did a quick search but didn't find anything useful so I'm hoping 
someone here will give me a clue.

A company I do some consulting for is getting more accounts that require 
that all e-mail be saved/stored/archived.

Currently they use an iMail ( Windows mail server ) hack to copy all the 
mail to and from a specific domain.  Since it is Windows we ( mostly me 
) are a little concerned about the security of that captured mail.

I'd like to do the same thing using Postfix so we could more the more 
critical accounts to a more secure system.  I'm not sure what the terms 
I should use to search should be.  My initial search using google.com, 
in the first three result pages, lead nowhere.

I have some ideas for inbound e-mail using procmail but for the outbound 
e-mail I have no ideas.

Can someone suggest some terms I can use for searching?  For that matter 
if you know of a Posfix add-on or configuration to do this I'd take 
that!  ;-)


TIA,
Rod

Rod,

   If you subscribe to mailhelp at moongroup.com and post your question there, I
would not be surprised to find someone's already worked out a solution. The
postfix mail list is another resource.

I love these responses. English speakers, especially, develop a "sense"
of what a word might mean even if they've never encountered it before.
The theory is that the many language collisions that English has
suffered has invested it with small morphs that "sound" like something.
Thus we combine and recombine them, frequently to the point where they
have lost all sense of their original meaning. :)

In any event, "capiscere" (pronounced with four syllables), is an
American made-up Italian verb, commonly used by pseudo cognoscenti
(more Italian), particularly in eastern metropolitan areas. It arose
from the real Italian verb "capire" which is derived from Latin
"capire," to take, grab, capture. Indeed, English "capture" is a Latin
borrowing from the same verb. In modern Italian "capire" has lost most
of its "capture" meaning and instead is the common verb for
"understand." Think of the English expression "Get it?" and you can see
how the meaning drifted from capturing to understanding.

The second person singular form of "capire" is "capisce," (sometimes
pronounced with an s and sometimes with an esh, depending on dialect.
So in places where there are concentrations of Italians, e.g., New York
City, English-only speakers kept hearing the question "Capisce?" and
eventually it was adopted into English as another way to say "Get it?"
And then the pseudo cognoscenti, who had studied enough French, Latin,
Spanish or Italian to understand vaguely how Romance verbs work,
invented a new infinitive form "capiscere."

And yes, I was in the meeting about mplayer. But I must have missed the
fact that it could convert. I'll fire it up right away and get those
evil WMAs converted to something more pleasant.

You could also look for linux/unix overview information online, if you
prefer electronic media. Google 'Unix overview' or 'Linux Introduction'
or some such. I second the Live CD suggestion, as a good place to start

glxgears does not push opengl very hard.  It does not test transparencies,
texture mapping or any of the advanced capabilities of the driver.  Quake 4
does.  (Actually the best for testing was the last version of Descent. It
showed all sorts of weird corner cases for the driver.)

Rich, I'll look at the moongroup.com list.

That's the way to do it!  I often use Mplayer to convert stuff to more
friendly formats, or to download video or audio streams for later (and
less stuttery) perusal.

Message-ID: <200611091157.58056.carla@bratgrrl.com>

Newegg got my new enclosure and drive to me in record time. Yay Newegg. (For 
those of you going "hey, why don't you support our kewl local shoppes" it's 
because I live in the wilds of Eastern Oregon. There are no kewl local 
shoppes.) 

I ordered a Rosewill RX353-S SATA enclosure. It has a cooling fan, and comes 
with both USB and SATA cables. The SATA cabling includes an external rear 
bracket. 

I bought a Western Digital 250-gigabyte 3.0 SATA drive for the insides. Slides 
right in, no problem. It seemed a bit wobbly, so I stuffed some anti-static 
foam around the sides to pack it in more tightly.

Plugged it in, fired it up, made one big partition and formatted it in ext3. 
Copied over a gazillion giant digital photos without a hitch. I'll use the 
SATA connector and backup my LAN to this drive, the usual rsync blahblah. 
SATA speeds don't much matter for network backups, but it's connected to my 
photo-editing workstation, so those speeds will come in handy.

Easy peasey and fun!

Well, I found out a few things, and in the process solved the problem.  Export 
without marking the check-box to include thumbnails produces, during import, an 
error window for every picture in the collection.  So after 926 "OK" clicks, the 
import proceeded.  Checking "include thumbnails" during export avoids this problem.

A quick glance at the project's web site didn't turn up any bug
reports for this issue. You might want to let the author know about

OK, I just now finally had time to try this, and I failed. I also had
some help from someone tonight and we failed to convert the WMAs with
various tools. Several times we produced an output file, but when I
tried to play it all I got was static. My most recent attempt was with
lame:

lame --vbr-new -B
320 /home/jjj/Phonetics/WS_10008.WMA /home/jjj/Phonetics/test4.mp3

The WMA files play fine in Windows Media Player (via Crossover Office),
Mplayer, Totem, and a couple other choices. But I can't get them
properly converted to something that Audacity can play. And I do need
Audacity. It's the only app I've ever found that has the ability to
slow down playback while preserving the pitch.

Whatever is wrong is happening with all the conversion tools I am
trying. Therefore, there must be something fundamentally wrong here.
Does anyone have any ideas?

I certain you already tried Google, but just didn't quite find the
right search query.

For work with Audacity, WAV is probably your best bet.  Use mplayer with
'-ao pcm:whatever'.

Carla,

www.gumstix.com might be an option. Not only do they have really small 
form formfactors but you can roll your own software to install. Give

Thanks Wil.

I'm still, as time permits, beating my way through the on line docs.  I 
also came across a method by Ralf Hildebrandt.  Of course it might be a 
little old and superseded by the *_bcc_maps.

Choices are good ... right?

Have a look at:

Builds gentoo to fit under 5MB.  This is obviously extremely pared down(no
X, gcc, etc. - just the minimal command line apps) but pretty cool.

OpenWrt (buildroot-ng) builds a jffs2 basic image of about 2.7 meg for
the WGT634U, which has 8 meg of flash storage.  Additional packages
can be added, which of course use more storage.

At Rich's recommendation, I swapped hdc and hdd so that the 40GB hard
drive is now hdc and the cdrom drive is now hdd. When I try to boot from
the knoppix 4.0 CD I get the following (after the BIOS stuff is finished):

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
OS load in progress...

ISOLINUX 2.11 2004-08-16 isolinux: Loading spec packet failed, trying to
wing it ...
isolinux: Failed to locate CD-ROM device; boot failed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

BIOS shows the correct configuration:

  Primary IDE Master  ST38410A
   Primary IDE Slave  Not Installed
Secondary IDE Master  ST340810A
 Secondary IDE Slave  ATAPI 44X CDROM

The Knoppix 4.0 CD boots just fine in my laptop.

Also, the problem system boots from the RH 7.0 CD.

Otherwise, I'm still where I was when the drives were reversed, except
that I've brought the machine up to my office so I can sit in front of
it, instead of standing on the chair!

Any other ideas?

Hi all!
 
    I am working to reinstall my edge system this weekend and had a quick question. I am replacing my old whitebox linux(redhat replica) with an Ubuntu Edgy system that will run VMware server(free edition). This way I will be able to do a little more experimenting on my edge and be able to quickly bring the network back up when the wife starts yelling. ;) 
    The question I have is this. VMware is bridging to my external interface(Groovy! Via their own bridging tech I think..?) and I want to leave the interface up so that my virtual machines can access the external lan but I want no external access to my VMware host server. I think I have a decent solution but it feels a bit clumbsy. Anyone know debian well enough to give me a little more elegant way to do this? 
    Righ now I have made sure that eth0 has a non routable address on the outside and then put a quick ifconfig command in the /etc/network/interfaces file to set it to have no IP address. This seems to work. My virtual machines can talk and I cannot access the host server via the network but again it just feels cheezy....  Feels like I am driving the car around the block just to roll up the windows.. Thanks for the help!
 
/etc/network/interfaces:
iface eth0 inet static
          address 192.168.0.1
          netmask 255.255.255.0
          up ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0611110831280.5646@grond.sourballs.org>

In brief-
We have a home-built computer that's been working well for the past 5 
years or so.  Yesterday, my spouse added a DIMM to it. It seemed ok, 
although we discovered that it spontaneously rebooted several hours later.
This morning, it is dead. No activity of any kind when the power is turned 
on, except the USB wireless adapter's LED glows, indicating that it is 
getting power. We removed the added DIMM. No change in behavior, still 
non-responsive.

Question: how do we start troubleshooting this?

Much obliged for any and all bits of help.

Are the fans spinning?

Do the LEDs on the keyboard flash?

Any beeps from the speaker?

If you have a voltmeter, check a disk power cable.  Yellow to black is 
+12V.  Red to black is +5V.

If you think power is good, you might try reseating the processor and 
DIMM.  Check to make sure all cables are properly seated.

Power supplies have a safety breaker in them.  I've tripped them just by
touching the case with sufficient static charge built up on my person.
The breaker flips back after a lengthy period of time (half hour?), but
you have to unplug the power cord.

Hmmm. Yellow to black: 0.07V.  Red to black: 0.01V. Don't see any obvious 
fuse or breaker on it - is it necessarily hosed, or might it have a 
problem that can be easily fixed?

Apparently not.

We've unplugged it repeatedly, but I'm not sure if we've done so for 30 
minutes or more. Is there a way to see if the breaker (assuming there is 
one) has been tripped?

That I do not know.  But one thing you could do is move the mainboard to
another case.  The downside is that if there is a problem that causes
the frying of the power supply, you will then have 2 dead ones.

   And I've had two power supplies fail over the years. First thing I'd do is
get a good power supply (I like the Antec quiet ones) and replace what's in
there.

I concur with Rich.  And I might add that a bad power supply can fry your
board or it might have been vice versa in my case.

I'm ready to buy a cheap FXO card. Any local sources? How about favorite
online vendors?

The generic X100P cards on eBay are about $25 with shipping, I'll pay up
to $5 more locally. Or if anyone has a used one they don't need, I'd be
happy to buy it.

If others are in the same boat, voxzone.com has a card for $15 with
shipping at $10 for the first one, but $2 for each additional card. I'd
be happy to place a large order so we can share the shipping discount.

Sounds bad, though maybe the power supply's good and the mobo isn't
giving it the "turn on" signal.  You can bring the power supply (or
whole computer) in to somewhere like Pacific Solutions or the FreeGeek
Thriftstore (open 11-7 today) and they can plug in a tester.

I'd recommend Free Geek; you can buy a tested used power supply for
peanuts, and even try it out right there in the store.

And BTW, they take credit cards now, so you could easily buy a whole
replacement computer.

Always trying to help folks spend money there,

We swapped in a power supply from another machine, and the box in question 
started to boot up. We got some complaints from the CMOS, probably because 
we cleared its memory in our attempts to get the machine to respond. So 
that, combined with the voltmeter readings, make it looks like we need a 
new power supply.

Here's a new question: could simply adding in a stick of memory (256MB 
PC-3200 400Mhz) fry a power supply? Or is that mere coincidence? This 
particular memory stick ran fine in my wife's machine for several years.

She replaced it with a single 512MB PC-2700 333Mhz DIMM, which freed up 
the other stick to go into a third machine. Adding that DIMM to the third 
machine seemed to start this chain of failure.

The mobo on the dead machine is an MSI K7T266 Pro2, whose manual only 
mentions using PC-1600 and PC-2100 memory.

That would be a simple matter if I still lived in the Portland area, 
unfortunately the trip from central Iowa would be unreasonable.

I recently bought two new power supplies (on sale at newegg.com) because
I needed one and I knew I'd eventually need another because I have had
bad power supply karma lately.  Plus now I can give my old 'test' power
supplies to FreeGeek.

I'm not really a hardware guy (though I desoldered the audio tower off a
motherboard yesterday and it still works), but my understanding is that a
system that has run in one configuration for a long time may not
tolerate changes well.

I've read that if you run a CPU at its rated speed for a few months,
the odds are against being able to overclock it much. By contrast, if
you overclock it from the start, your odds are much better. I'm not into
overclocking because my applications require reliability, but that seems
to suggest that hardware doesn't like change. 

Hardware wizards? Please enlighten us.

I doubt that would fry the power supply directly. But age of the 
hardware is one consideration, nothing lasts forever. Corporate service 
techs are trained extensively on _E_lectro _S_tatic _D_ischarge, and the 
damage it causes. Just touching the case before handling internal 
components is not a guarantee that ESD will not damage something. Often 
the damage is slight, only weakening a tiny trace connection to an IC. I 
have seen electron microscope images of this. What happens is the 
component will fail "mysteriously" a few months down the road.

I don't have a lot of experience with this, but after reading the man 
pages for fsck and e2fsck I think I would try:
1.  Run e2fsck -ck      This will check for bad blocks.
2. Then e2fsck -pv     This will try to repair automatically with 
verbose output.

e2fsck is a wrapper for fsck.  If fsck throws these errors, e2fsck
will too.

Here's something that may be worth a try:

http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2005/03/msg00584.html

It involves dd-ing your hard drive to a big ol' file, and then
mounting the file -o loop.

If you go this route, you should probably use dd_rescue.

Hi,
There used to be a path through the menu system where you could click to 
make list the default view for all folders. I can't find it now in 
Ubuntu 6.06 or 6.10. Has it been removed or am I just getting lost in 
the maze? If removed, is there an alternate way to accomplish this?

TIA,

Yeah.  Regular /bin/dd will abort on the first error, which isn't what
you want.

Assuming you're referring to Nautilus, open any folder in the Places
menu, then View, and on the bottom of the list is View as List.

Ok...This is good to know.
I have decided that I no longer want the data on the drive.  I have moved 
stuff out of it a few weeks ago for a different reason.  So the stuff on 
there, I can really do without.

Should I reformat the drive?  I am thinking I can do that but I am not sure 
if the drive is reliable
since I have no clue why I have trouble with it today all of a sudden.  The 
drive is less than 3 years old.

In a world where hard drive space is dropping below 40 cents a
gigabyte, it is not worth trusting your data to a POS worn-out unit.
What piece of computer hardware has more moving parts than a hard
drive?

Reminds me that I had better get a set of new drives soon, before I
find myself in your boat.

I figured this out last week or so (long enough that I've already
forgotten the fine detail), thought I'd followup with the general
solution.  I may have misled (i don't remember now) on the problem
description slightly.  It is possible that printing locally was not
working afterall.  

Turns out, the host that attached to the printer had its cups
configuration pointing at the printer as a network resource, rather
than as a locally connected usb printer that it was.  As soon as I
fixed that, bingo, everybody started printing.

I agree with the cost being low.  But this drive I had is only 3 years old 
(or even less).  I expect them to last a bit longer than that.

And there lies the problem with the continually downward spiral of
quality vs. the price. People these days seem to only care about how
large of a drive they can get for the money and the only way companies
can offset the cost is lower quality control measures and maybe sub-par
materials. 

Lately it's been performance for me, and getting a "high"(read 10k rpm)
performance drive is well worth the money even if you're only getting an
80 GB drive. 

Because honestly; the bigger storage I have the more crap I
accumulate... which seems to be the same problems with my homes...hmm
insightful.

Is this the board you are troubleshooting?

It looks like a soket processor which is good because
the slot style processors seem to come out easier.
For dead power supply, check to see if the fan is
ceased and if it is I'd strongly suggesting picking
up an Antec unit to replace it.  The other thing to
watch out for is a power supply issue such as 
overloading a UPS or a circuit that would have 
nothing to do with the functioning of your computer.
The first rule of troubleshooting is to make sure
that what you are focusing on is in fact broken.

The predecessor was apparently unstable.  This review
says something about needing registered memory if the
board had four slots.  The USB apparently stops 
working on the board reviewed in this article 
beyond 137 megahertz.  Putting memory on this board 
that is faster than what it was designed for probably 
won't work if the reviews I've been running into are 
correct about it being unstable.

Looking at this board, I bet I'd buy it if I didn't
realize it has problems.  The A version of this is
supposed to be okay, but I wonder if MSI really got
the problems fixed.  What is an AMR slot?  It sounds
like a non standard slot that never caught on.

What about an oversized southbridge chipset heatsink
makes it less than robust?  Isn't oversized pretty 
much good and being undersized a problem?

I'd test that I'm troubleshooting the right thing by
plugging in a stable electrical appliance where I'm
taking my power from for this machine.

Question I have if the motherboard isn't all that great,
what is the best replacement for it?

Indeed.  And it might still be under warranty.  Some drive manufacturers
have a webpage that lets you punch in a serial number or datecode and
find out if the drive's still under warranty.

If it's not, DO NOT RE-USE IT.  With modern hard drives, once you start
seeing errors, the drive's nearly dead.

I bought a used 60G drive for $30 (before idiscount) at FreeGeek the
other day, BTW.  They test 'em and everything.

I do a LOT of CAD simulation, mostly with proprietary apps ($$$) 
designed for 32 bit X86.  I want to buy new motherboard; I want
simple and fast, I do not need fast graphics or fast ethernet or
sound or big disk or big ram any other wizzy stuff, just the best
performance on small, single-threaded 32 bit floating-point apps. 
I will probably be running a RHEL4 clone OS on the machine.

What is the best way to go?  Does an Opteron or a dual-core run
32 bit single thread apps faster than a P4 or Atheron?  Given
fast processor X, which motherboard is most reliable?  Suggested
websites with reviews?

Can't give any pointers on consumer-level hardware, but to answer the
performance question:  Yes, an Opteron (or Athlon64, since you don't
need multi-CPU)  will in general run your 32-bit code faster than any
other processor.

Last time I ran a 32-bit benchmark on a range of cpu's I would say that since that 
latest chip thingy from that other cpu company came on the market, "in general" that was 
not really the case anymore ;)

Yup, that would be the one.

OK, after reading your response and that of Rich S. , I can see that I 
did a piss-poor job of explaining what I was looking for. I think the 
path started in the Mozilla browser something like System > windows > 
preferences although that is obviously not the case now. The final menu 
had a *checkbox* labeled something like 'make list view the default for 
all files ' . Checking this made *all* menus in the file system default 
to list view. No more changing the view in each menu as I worked through 
them.

Does this ring a bell with anyone? I found this feature referred to in 
someone's column or blog on the net, not in any of the Ubuntu help 
stuff. I've lost the reference and after going the System > Preferences 
and System > Admin menus numerous times I'm beginning to doubt if this 
feature exists anymore. Maybe dropped after 5.10.

If anyone has a clue about this I'd appreciate a response. Sorry for the 
confusion.

I know the vendors of the codes you're running probably don't want to 
give you benchmark results, but it won't hurt to ask. Meanwhile, given 
that you are dealing with a single-threaded 32-bit app, probably 
floating point intensive, I'd go with whatever has the shallowest 
pipelines and the biggest cache.

MailChannels recently built a scalable, modern, event-based system for
asynchronous IO. Here's how they did it.

Subject: [PLUG] A little more help with Pyramid Linux on Metrix Mark II
Message-ID: <334c4450611132233g5b983a8aq5364ace133c58adc@mail.gmail.com>

All knowing PLUG Listers,

I've posed questions before and have received constructive comments
(which I greatly appreciate), so here goes.

I've got a small wireless mesh network setup in the following topology:

L1<---link1--->R1<---link2--->R2<---link3--->L2

L1 and L2 are laptops (WinXP with wireless cards)

R1 and R2 are mesh routers with dual wireless cards and an ethernet
port (Pyramid Linux).

R1 is connected to the "Internet" via its ethernet port (eth0).

R2 is not connected directly to the Internet (its eth0 port is open).


The routing on R1 and R2 is accomplished by running OSLRd on the
radios on R1 and R2 responsible for maintaining the link2 connection.
For all intents and purposes, OSLRd is merely maintaining routing
tables on R1 and R2.  I use HNA announcements on R1 and R2 to
broadcast connectivity to LANs (wlan0 AP on R1 and R2) and the
Internet (eth0 on R1 only).


Under my current configuration, L1 is hosting a web server and FTP server.
L2 is able to ping L1 over the mesh, and can even access the FTP
server on L1 and transfer files.

Question #1:

However, L2 is unable to pull up the default web page hosted on L1.
I've witnessed a successful TCP handshake between the two, but the
HTTP connection is never established.  What might be blocking this?
IPTABLES on R1 is currently setup with default policies to allow
everything, and performs SNAT to the IP on eth0 to facilitate Internet
access.  IPTABLES on R2 isn't configured at all (defaults to allow
everything).

This same problem occurs when L2 attempts to access the Internet.  L1
can surf the web with no problems (it can even resolve DNS names).
L2, on the other hand, can't resolve DNS names, but even more, it
cannot pull up web sites on the Internet (by IP address) while having
the capability to ping the Internet IP address.

I've installed Lynx on R1 and R2 to troubleshoot the problem and have
verified that R1 can pull up the web page on L1, but R2 cannot (same
symptom as experienced by R2).

Question #2:

I mentioned the DNS issue.  R1 connects to a cable/DSL router via DHCP
and obtains all of the DNS settings "automagically", thereby allowing
L1 to do DNS lookups and resolve names.

Does anyone have a link to a HOWTO or advise for getting DNS
information on R2 via R1, thereby allowing L2 to do DNS lookups and
resolve names?

I've done some poking around regarding dnsmasq and the nameservice
plugin to OSLRd, but the combination of the two leaves me scratching
my head and my attempts to configure this have been uneventful.


Thanks in advance, and thanks for your help in the past!

Ben

The SPEC benchmarks and website are one "standard" with

Look at CPU benchmarks and Results areas of the site.
You can also download the benchmark and run it on your candidate system

I do a LOT of CAD simulation, mostly with proprietary apps ($$$) 
designed for 32 bit X86.  I want to buy new motherboard; I want
simple and fast, I do not need fast graphics or fast ethernet or
sound or big disk or big ram any other wizzy stuff, just the best
performance on small, single-threaded 32 bit floating-point apps. 
I will probably be running a RHEL4 clone OS on the machine.

What is the best way to go?  Does an Opteron or a dual-core run
32 bit single thread apps faster than a P4 or Atheron?  Given
fast processor X, which motherboard is most reliable?  Suggested
websites with reviews?

I'm not sure spec benchmarks are valid relative to CAD simulation. IIRC 
CAD simulation is floating point intensive and "highly scalar" -- not 
really helped by vector or parallel or concurrent execution. Hence you 
want short clock cycles, large caches and shallow pipelines.

By the way, although you might not be using them, there *are* open 
source CAD codes available, which might make good benchmarks. You could 
compile one that's close in functionality to one you actually want to 
run on your current box and benchmark other machines with it.

It's going to be moderately difficult to find a pure 32-bit non-dual 
core machine these days -- even starter systems have 64-bit dual-core 
chips in them these days. So even if you don't need all that stuff, 
perhaps it's worth getting in the hopes that the application vendors 
will catch up to the hardware in six months or so. :)

Actually, SpecVIEWPERF contains a number of high-end CAD as well as 3D
modeling softwares.  It's the most relevant benchmark available for
comparing hardware for /production/ software, as opposed to games.  I
use this in addition to a number of other codes to regularly
test/compare GL cards & CPU's for use in the 3D effects industry.

Hi all I need some advice. I am fighting a bit of a ghost and don't know
where else to look. I reinstalled my edge box this weekend and have gone
with vmware to containerize all my virtual appliances. Should make
developing and experimenting much easier. Anyway I am having a problem
with the base server responding to tcp traffic. It is sporadic at best
and most of the time it won't respond at all. I can always ping the eth0
interface but cannot ssh to it dependably from my PC. Note that when I
cannot connect I get a "connection refused" error. Me thinks this is
typical of a firewall or acl but there are none in between. The machine
is a fresh install of ubuntu server with openssh, kernel source, a few
libraries, and vmware server installed. On vm1 I have a pfsense server
installed and it is working fine. I can access it via 443 with no
problems and it is passing traffic just dandy. I must be missing
something pretty basic here. Thanks for the help!
(SORRY FOR THE POOR ASCI ART. I AM A VISUAL FELLER) 

       ---------                      --------
 eth1  |       | eth0                 |      |

       ---------                      --------

Configuration:
-(eth1) is up but is configured with an "ifconfig eth1 0.0.0.0" cmd
I did this because I dont want any traffic to hit eth1 accept for the
traffic destined for the vmnet1(which is bridged to eth1). Probably a
better way to do this... Any tips welcome.. note I put an "up ifconfig
eth1 0.0.0.0" line in my /etc/network/interfaces to do this.
-(vmnet1) is up and has my external ip address. It is bridged via vmware
to eth1
-(eth0) is up and is 10.x.x.10. This is the int having the connection
problems
-(vmnet2) is up and is 10.x.x.1. This is the pfsense gateway. (note that
10.x.x.10 is showing up correctly in the arp tables on this gateway)

Funny things I have noticed:
- Even directly connected(eliminating the dell) to the box it will still
fail. 
- The time to connect with ssh is very slow, I will get a username
prompt and then will wait a good 6 seconds for a password prompt. 
- Also the route command is very slow to respond. It takes forever to
get the default line.
- I have tried to set the ip on eth1 to a private address ie 192.168.x.x
and have also disabled it altogether. The changing of the address had no
effect. The disabling of the interface seemed to help with the stability
of the connection.
- Unplugging the eth1 interface seems to help with stability(ssh is
still slow to authenticate)
- I have also shutdown the vm1 to make sure there were no conflicts and
it didn't change anything.
- I have swapped the configurations of eth0 and eth1 and still have the
same results on different interfaces.

Thanks all! sorry for the long post!

Why Wil?  Are you absolutely certain?  Shops find time to become
certified Microsoft support centers, why not Linux?  What makes you 
say that being a certified Linux support center in a small shoppe 
isn't feasible?  How does incident Linux support work?  Does Redhat
offer the latter?  Has Geek squad ever considered Linux support?  Is
there a greater need for OS-X and Windows support because the source
code is closed, hence a bias in support?  There are plenty of, "I have
not learned...," and, "I don't want to/can't learn...," comments on 
this list despite the openness of most Linux dependent software.  To 
me, that sounds like a potential market.  I think commercial Linux 
support is positive as long as free support benefits from it in 
the long run, the quality is good, and the pricing is reasonably
competitive.  Maybe I don't live in reality on the subject of how
the computer software business works, but if noone knows why it
doesn't work the way many feel it should, how will it ever improve?
If you don't know how or why something is broken, how are you supposed
to fix it?  I don't feel that I have sufficient Linux mastery to start 
a small shoppe providing Linux support, but I bet there are people
on this list with both the skill and the time that could.  So my
question to these individuals is, what's stopping you?  Aside from
Carla's book series, I don't see much being done.

What metric Wil are you using to measure the demand for local Linux
support businesses?  There are Mapinfo groups with apparently paid
members, maybe something similar can contribute to establishing
local Linux support shops.  Buying a Linux compatible hardware
platform that can fill one's needs isn't a task that is diminishing
or going away, especially with OEM's continually attempting to
create proprietary hardware and lock it into closed software 
platforms.  There is more need for small business computer support 
than there is for large business computer support.  Small business 
is the lifeblood of every economy in the world.  Without small
business, there is only a minimal amount of innovation.  What is
the viability of creating a business like Dell that specializes
in a mail order Linux laptop business with lifetime support?  Are
Dell and Gateway the only companies that can do this?  I especially
question the latter notion if Dell and Gateway won't support Linux
as the installed OS.

Do you have reverse DNS for your 10.x.x.x network?  No PTRs can make 
SSH and route act just like that.

I will give that a try tonight. I have never had these issues before
without reverse dns running. I know xdmcp can be touchy about it but I
haven't ran into anything else that really needs reverse.
One more thing to add to my original post: The same problems are
occurring with the port that vmware uses.. (905 tcp or something like
that. Cant remember.) Thats why in the first post I said I thought it
was a tcp problem... Sorry I was not very clear about that.

Thanks All!

In any folder window, select Edit->Preferences.   Under the Views tab, Default 
View, in the 'View _n_ew folders using:'  drop down list, select List View.  After
I did this, all folder I opened are using the list view (except It looks more like
a tree view to me).  I'm assuming Ubuntu here, not Kubuntu.  I haven't found
a way to do this yet outside of a folder window.

How old is the motherboard?

What happens if you move the cd rom drive to hdb?

Do you have the cable select jumper on any of the drives?

FYI - It is working great now. All I did was put in a forward record in the vm1 pfsense firewall and used the name to connect. :( This is very odd to me. But hey at least I can finish building my virtual machines. Guess I'll have to figure out what was happening later. Thanks Jason for the tip! Turned out that dns helped!

Think I got it! I noticed this morning that when I pinged the 10.x.x.10 address I would get a .3 ms reply with a TTL=64. However every so often this would change to .7ms reply with a TTL=255 and my connection would drop. Very wierd. Seemed like there was another host with the same address. There were no arp entries in my router to support this theory. Regardless I decided to change the address of the interface. Boom now its been working stable for an hour or so. It responds immediately when I ssh and the ping stays constant at .3ms and TTL=64. I am unable to ping the old address so I am not sure what exactly was going on. Oh and I killed the forward record for the old address. I didnt think ssh was dns dependent. Thanks All!

Message-ID: <20061115170527.GB3567@gate.kl-ic.com>


A little annoyance solved ...

Mail attachments of type "application/octet-stream" can be damned
near anything;  M$ mailers expect you to resolve the type by the file
extension.  This makes it easier to propagate viruses, so that everyone
can share.  The /etc/mailcap and .mailcap files don't know what to do
with the extensions.

For those of you using the mutt mail reader, you can use the shell
script at http://www.davep.org/mutt/mutt.octet.filter, which is launched
by "application/octet-stream; mutt.octet.filter %s ; copiousoutput"
in the mailcap file.  I added some code to mutt.octet.filter so it
will launch Acrobat Reader when it sees a pdf (Proprietary! Heretic!
KILL!!!), but for the most part it seems to handle many common types
of octet-stream automagically.

It might be better to do some rewrite rules on incoming mail so that
the octet-stream types are rewritten into "application/xxxxx" for
all the various types, so that mailcap can handle that naturally.
Is there such a tool for postfix?

Have you looked at procmail (local mailbox delivery agent for postfix)? 
It has
a scripting facility for piping incoming mail to 'external 
applications'. I don't
know if there is a built in filter for attachment types, but you should 
be able
to provide that if necessary.

Subject: [PLUG] iptraf display problems...
Message-ID: <1163556030.870.27.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I am specifically noticing that iptraf displays fine on a 2.4.29 
Redhat 7.2 system, but on all my 2.6 kernel based Linux systems,
including Slackware 10.1, it doesn't display right.  It's fine 
inside an x terminal, but not on the console.  Was there some 
change that affected ncurses based programs which I need to be 
aware of between the release of the 2.4 and the 2.6 kernels?

Doing export TERM=vt100 is certainly a workaround, but not a very 
good one.  I tried to google for this problem only to get bogged
down in extraneous hits.

I'm getting ready to pull my last Redhat 7.x box up to 
CentOS 4.3 Final.  Understandably, I don't want to lose 
any functionality that I currently have.

If it's a framebuffer issue, a broken terminal library, etc. 
I'd really like to know.

<gripe>
2.6 was supposed to be a grand reorganization of the kernel after 
the 2.4 series.  It seems to me that: the number of options exploded, 
things got broken, and the documentation to options ratio dropped
sharply.  In a stable kernel, I feel that undocumented options 
should either be documented or removed.  I think the time has come
for the developers of the 2.6 kernel to revisit the documentation
problem and get more aggressive about it.

I know there is tremendous pressure to upgrade in order to be secure.
However, I am not very impressed with the 2.6 kernel yet.  Redhat 9 
and Fedora Core 1 are old systems, though they also appear to be among
the last Linux distributions that are 2.4 kernel based.  I worry that
simplicity that existed when there were fewer kernel options has been
lost as 2.6 has grown.

To help people configure 2.6 properly for what they have verses the
options that exist, has there been any attempt to make a small
distribution on a flash drive that essentially writes a 2.6 config
file based off of hardware detection?  Even if it wouldn't crank 
out an optimal configuration, a stable base configuration is a good 
starting point.

Why can ext2/ext3 filesystems occupy larger partitions than FAT
filesystems can?  I'm suspicious of NTFS even on Windows 2000/XP.
I question how NTFS is supposedly an improvement over FAT where 
I'm even more concerned that the tools Microsoft puts out 
developed originally for FAT12/FAT16/FAT32 filesystems aren't 
suited to NTFS.  I wish Microsoft was a company that respects 
the GPL.  I'd love to see Microsoft throw out all of it's 
proprietary filesystems in exchange for better OSS replacements.  
For those working on ReactOS, I think installing to an ext3 
instead of an NTFS filesystem is where the focus should be.  Is 
there a project to allow for installation of a MS Windows system 
to a free modern filesystem that Linux can handle well?

Does Vista even allow for installation to a FAT32 filesystem?

BTW:
Is there a trick to get XP to activate on second and third
installations, hard drives do wear out after all?  Microsoft 
will undoubtedly want everyone who still uses Windows to 
buy Vista soon enough, but I'm not interested.  I am hopeful 
about the ReactOS project, but I'm still not certain if it 
will ever become a complete drop in substitute for XP.  Why
isn't there a free Windows clone around that's comparable to
at least Windows 2000 which Microsoft is trying to drop 
support for now?

I'll second Wil on this so far.  I seem to be moving in this direction
myself.  CentOS is a good system if you want a clean Linux system that
doesn't come with any proprietary software.  It is seems to be a good
choice for stability.  CentOS is not for supporting the latest
and greatest.  The update repository seems very limited.  On the other
hand, upgrades often impact system stability in a negative way.
Theoretically if you don't install experimental compilers etc., you
don't need to update as frequently.

I think all of the major Linux distributions could be pushed 
aside by one that is: documented better, current, and designed to
run in a small footprint.  I wonder what Puppylinux is based on
and if any of the small Linux distributions will compete with 
the RHEL clones?  We are starting to see embedded Linux distributions,
but they seem to be mostly specialty distros that are hard to find out
about.  These distros appear to be very tightly tied to specific
hardware for the most part.  A linux distro that targets certain Linksys
routers which has been mentioned recently on this list comes to mind.

I've tried gentoo and I don't like it.  If you don't like the poor
documentation that comes with the 2.6 kernel, I seriously doubt that
you will like gentoo much.  I'm sorry, but I don't understand portage
very well and I worry that a system that trusts it's package management
system and recompiling software to stay current is going to be nothing
more than a maintenance nightmare.  In a world where no upgrade can
cause loss of functionality or break programs, gentoo might shine.  In
reality, making a mistake in how you compile one package or upgrading
something that can't be without replacing everything is not the sort of
situation you want on a production server.  I think gentoo magnifies the
confusion of updates that people already feel on yum and apt based Linux
systems.  Updating in general in my opinion hasn't been implemented well
in any popular operating system at this time.

Hmm, comments like this may partially explain why 50% 
of marriages end in divorce.  I think it is extremely 
crass to promote promiscuity in a technical forum.

I don't see how buying AMD64 machines when Linux and even
Windows hasn't caught up with them is going to promote 
any decrease or for that matter an increase of proprietary 
software options.  I don't even suspect a direct 
correlation let alone a stronger indicator.

The way Microsoft wastes memory and processing power,
this to me seems to be why AMD64 is available today.
Will Windows take advantage of AMD64 fully, I doubt it.
I have already seen updates from Microsoft to try and
reconcile 64 bit Windows with 32 bit Windows.  A PC164
Alpha, 72 pin FPM simms, has been my only 64 bit 
experience.  It was a world where the software didn't
exist yet and it was hard to get the right version
of anything, even if it was available.  At least it was
that way with zoot-alpha and beyond when I tried to 
replace zoot-alpha with a Redhat 7.xx alpha system.  
Let's see, I got that machine in 1998 and it was 
manufactured in 1995.  In eleven years, Alpha seems to 
have died and nothing that is replacing it seems to be 
doing much better.

64 bit architecture machines are very different machines
than systems that are IA32 compatible.

What's wrong with the computers we already have?  I think
the law that processing power will double every 18 months
is going to stop being a law if it hasn't failed already.  
Does every one realize that Intel and AMD are basically 
shoving multiple processors onto a single chip and calling 
it one processor for the most part now?

The reason for read-only on NTFS is that is is a reverse engineered file 
system.  It varies in slight ways from version to version and is not 
considered to be a well enough known quantity to write to safely yet.

Not to mention the possible patent problems with it...

I doubt it.  FAT32 is an evil hack to begin with. Long file name support 
in FAT32 even more so.

Because they want you to spend money on Vista.

Why would you expect older tools, which were created for older
technologies to work with newer technologies? You don't need to be a
programmer to realize that an 8-track won't work with a cd player...
this is a similar issue.  AFAIK, FAT filesystems aren't journaled, and
NTFS is -- that alone is enough to make them largely incomparable, and
there are certainly many other minor differences as well.

Keep in mind that those differences are what represent steps *forward*
(in general -- I'm not debating the benefits of FAT over NTFS, or vice
versa, at least not at a file-system tech. level.)  Some advances
simply can't be made while perpetually providing for backwards
compatibility.  Other things just simply aren't worth updating -- I'm
assuming it's far easier to just create a new set of tools for NTFS
than it was to update the old tools to work with all MS filesystems.

I'm not familiar with ReactOS, but if you're targeting Windows users,
it probably helps to support a file system they can read with existing
computers.  Until windows natively supports ext* or reiser or xfs
or... then NTFS/FAT seems a reasonable choice.

Because it's really, really, *really* hard to make a clone of
something that big, and it's *extremely* hard to make a clone of
something that big when you have to reverse engineer it, and all it's
bugs, from a black-box perspective.  Surely you're familiar with the
Wine project, and the CrossOver line of products?

Linux works very well on the AMD64.  I have been using it since Fedora 
Core 2.  I have a couple of AMD64 machines and they run fine.

The problem is in certain closed source apps.  Flash will run in 64 bit 
soon enough now that Adobe has opensourced it.

Nope. Wrong answer.  There are a bunch of reasons people want 64 bit 
systems.  (Memory beyond 4 gigs, large L1 and L2 caches, etc.)

> Will Windows take advantage of AMD64 fully, I doubt it.

It is not stable on 64 bits yet, so it is not an issue.

You need to read the AMD 64 docs.  They are more alike than you think.

Don't buy them then.  But don't bitch at people who want to move into the

Perhaps you could look at investing in higher quality smaller drives
and throwing them in a RAID5 NAS.  Would definately help in protecting
from single drive failures.

www.tomshardware.com has comparison charts on several NAS appliances
(drives included or BYOD [bring your own drive] models), whose
performance continues to increase while prices continue to drop.  If I
had the money at hand, or could justify the expense, I'd look into it
myself.

I concur with the others that continuing to use this drive isn't worth
the headache soon to come.

Most of the "small" Linux distros are based on Debian, often via a 
remastered Knoppix LiveCD. Damn Small used to be that way. I personally 
liked Morphix -- they started with Knoppix but made the base LiveCD only 
200 MB and set things up so it was easy to add packages from the Debian 
repositories.

You don't hear a whole heck of a lot about Knoppix these days -- or for 
that matter, many of the other Debian-based distros. And you don't hear 
a whole heck of a lot about Slackware. If you're going down the Debian 
path, you pretty much have to go with Debian itself or with Ubuntu.

If you want a "stable" community distro, Debian stable, CentOS and 
Slackware are probably the most stable. Fedora, being a "proving ground" 
for RHEL, is a lot edgier than those three.

Somebody also mentioned Gumstix. I just got one :). Most of the 
ARM-based embedded systems will run off of "buildroot". I don't know 
about how stable it is yet, but my Netstix comes with an Ethernet port 
and a compact flash slot and boots up with DHCP with a functioning ssh 
server and web server. Available software includes Ruby and SQLite, so 
I'm planning to max out the compact flash slot and see if I can get 
Rails running on it. I think *that's* very cool. :)

Well ... here we disagree. I think Gentoo's overall documentation is the 
best there is! They've led me through some pretty hairy upgrades.

Well ... on a production server, you only need to change something to 
close a security hole or fix a bug in a package you are using. Where I 
think Portage *currently* falls down relative to "up2date/yum" or "apt" 
is in the notification strategy. Up2date, for example, will tell you 
whether an update is a security fix, a bug fix or new functionality. So 
you can choose to only do critical updates. With Gentoo, right now, you 
have to read the change logs. I think I *could* run a production Gentoo 
stable server as easily as someone else could run a CentOS or "Sarge" 
stable server, but I've been working with Gentoo almost exclusively for 
years.

I know the Gentoo people have plans to provide better notification 
strategies, but their user base probably wants other things more, like a 
point and click installer, better LiveCD tools, and more packages in the 
repository.

Hmm, that sounds a lot like a fancy virtual machine for javascript (or 
ECMA-262 which Flash uses and calls ActionScript) and not a Flash player 
itself.  And the Mozilla project is talking about a 2008 release date 
for it being integrated with Firefox[1], which isn't exactly "soon 
enough" in my opinion.  It looks like we'll still have to wait for the 
foot dragging Adobe to get a Flash player for Linux.

So I bought a sort of bargain priced system at Belmont Computers weekend 
before last and just got around to assembling the thing.

Grr!!  There's no audio or accelerated video for the onboard components in 
2.6.18!  I have no sound and crummy vesa video.

I'm kind of extraordinarily upset about this (which means I actually 
frowned and kicked my foot at some dust).

I think I'm going to dismantle the thing and see if Belmont will do an 
exchange for a different motherboard.  If the price difference is too 
great, I'll have to buy cheap video and sound cards.

I don't need any fancy 3D or anything like that, but great 2D is a 
wonderful thing.

So what onboard stuff is well-supported in an AMD64 chipset?

Message-ID: <20061116153148.GB17884@gate.kl-ic.com>


I have an AMD Athlon X2 64 dual-core 4600+ machine running.  It
turns out the proprietary CAD tool that I am using has a 64 bit
version I am entitled to, and it will take advantage of dual core.
So a simulation that took 120 seconds on the 32 bit machine now
runs in 18 seconds on both cores.  Since I am running these sims
imbedded in a Perl script, 200 sims in a bunch, that is quite a
time savings.  It is interesting to watch the power meter on the box
jump from 60 watts idle to 120 watts when both cores are cranking.

Why 200 sims?  Checking out many corner cases.  

The software is a proprietary simulator, and has all sorts of copy
control stuff, with an arbitrary built-in 10 second enforced delay
between sims when running dual thread, making the sims 50% slower
than necessary.  I hate "proprietary"[1] software ...

BTW, this is running on top of Scientific Linux 4.4 ("Beryllium")
64 bit SMP, a free RHEL clone from FermiLabs with 3 year upgrade
support.  64 bit is challenging - proprietary [1] apps like Acrobat
Reader look in the wrong places for libraries.  Oh well, it is 
just a compute server.

That is the core of the Flash player according to one of the Adobe 
developers.  There is a 32 bit beta for Linux already.  It is the 64 bit 
that is the problem.  I have not seen the code, so I have no idea how 
clean it is.

ReactOS is wine turned into an operating system.  There are only two
wine API's apparently that don't work directly in ReactOS, but there
are equivalents to them.

There are only 2 ways I can see to break the Microsoft monopoly, 

A: Don't wait for aggressive marketing of Linux as a desktop
   replacement by the existing players.  Develop and market 
   applications for Linux now.  Linux standards base is your
   friend.

B: The ReactOS project gets further and produces real competition.

Regardless how hard it is to reverse engineer Windows, B is the 
only option until such time that A is taken seriously enough.
I think it's fair to say that noone will effectively replace MS Windows
with a proprietary system because Microsoft will simply buy out that
system via hostile takeover if necessary.  WebTV anyone?  They didn't
last long before Microsoft bought them out.  Open source operating
systems are the only competitor to MS Windows because they are the only
OS'es that Microsoft can't buy out.  Microsoft already owns Apple, so
for those who think Macs are competition to PC's, reconsider.  Until
such time that antitrust means, "you can't buy out every single piece of
proprietary technology within a single market sector," A and B appear to
be what we're stuck with.

Congress in my opinion needs to put some teeth into antitrust and start
enforcing the law, but I doubt that is going to happen anytime soon
judging by the history of antitrust law.  I don't even trust democrats
to push for what needs to be done.  Clinton didn't get the job done
with Microsoft, who is to say that this new Congress will either?

There is a simple way to promote B if you have any money.  Go to
http://www.reactos.org and make a donation.

For those who worry that A is impractical because Linux is changing so
fast.  That issue doesn't seem to stop: Microsoft, Nintendo, Sony, etc.
I see the same Nintendo titles rolled out over and over where the
complexity of programming is on the rise and the Nintendo hardware is
in flux.  Nintendo programmers are definitely updating their programming
skills.  Ditto for Sony with it's playstation.  I hear compiling is
expensive and cloning is hard frequently from Rogan.  Why?  Linus never
said that Linux can't run proprietary applications and even so, there's
the example of IBM which paid for postfix up front and GPL'ed it because
IBM wanted it.  I'm grateful to IBM's investment which gives me a mail
server today, free of charge I might add.  Excuses stink, I can't
believe that a public that deserves choice can't promote it somehow.
OPB supports itself by individual contributions, why not the OSS
community?  If the ReactOS community can attract enough talent and raise
enough money, I think it can go far.  After all, Linux is technically a
black box clone of UNIX.  AT&T locked UNIX System V up if I remember my
history correctly.  If UNIX had remained freely distributable, I doubt
that Linux would have ever been born.

I see that an off topic opinion from you is okay but I get openly
criticized by the list maintainer, Wil.

"Don't buy them then.  But don't bitch at people who want to move into
the 21st century and beyond."

How much memory is really needed for todays most common applications if
programmers use memory efficiently?  I hear rumors that some
applications are not faster on a dual core system compared to say a
Pentium 4 system.  Pentium 4 systems are 21st century.  What I see is
that dual core systems are very expensive.  I feel they are unproven.
I worry about power consumption considering that the Pentium 4's
of the past already consume too much.  Energy is a major worldwide
problem where every major new computer type that comes out tends to need
more power than it's predecessors.  Since you can't build a safe nuclear
power plant in America due to regulations inspired by a paranoid public
and with our technological capacity to collect solar energy being
woefully inadequate, this problem isn't going to go away anytime soon.  
Other green power options, such as focusing the sun on a water tower
in death valley to run a steam turbine, are dead in the water as well
because of the paranoid public.  Perhaps our energy problems could be
solved today, but the public won't allow this because of it's paranoia.

Moving into the 21st century to me is acquiring computer equipment
that is both modern and 100% Linux compatible.  No 64 bit computers
are yet or there wouldn't be so many postings about software glitches
on them.  I think supporting companies that put out equipment which
Linux has problems with is a mistake.

Why aren't the ReactOS people further along is what I'm
wondering?  One would think that Linux software should be
getting more popular, XP really hasn't been around for
very long.  Does the public really feel like throwing
computers and software out every 3-4 years?  With vmware
staying strong, maybe one can distribute software with
an embedded OS and not worry about being Windows or Linux
compatible?  Everyone can get the player for free.  VMware
is getting more current, it worked out of the box on Fedora
Core 5 last time I tried it.  Theoretically, what can the
ReactOS project accomplish?  What would happen if the majority
of people preparing to buy Vista made a donation to the ReactOS
project instead?

With Microsoft's broken promise of one Windows for everyone back
in the 98SE days, people should become more favorable to a
free alternative.  The fragmentation is ridiculous.

Subject: [PLUG] Internet growth, RFC 1918 addressing...
Message-ID: <1163650325.9492.68.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

For private lans with Internet connectivity addressed using an RFC 1918
block, are there any reserved domain names that will never be used on
the Internet?  Are pri, lan, home, ... reserved domain names that people
setting up dns for RFC 1918 networks are allowed to use?  How do you
program bind 9 to realize it shouldn't ask ANY Internet name server
to resolve a particular domain name while keeping this a possibility
for other domain names?  If it is known whether a local name verses 
a remote one is being searched for, there could theoretically be
separate domain systems ( say the global Internet one, and a local
private one ) where the system to use could be indicated at the time 
a program or user queries for a name to be resolved.  This might call
for standard changes to the resolver libraries unfortunately unless 
it can be done another way.  It seems that there really should be a
standard way to query dns nameservers so that one can indicate whether
they are looking for a local name or perhaps a remote name on an
internet/intranet other than the Internet.  Naming whole domains at 
once alone won't be enough I bet as names are exhausted.  Having 
enough physical numbers is only half the problem of addressing 
every Internet connected host.  You can go from 32 billion ip 
addresses to 8 times that or more, but eventually how do you 
come up with enough unique names for all those ips?  As the Internet
grows larger, how long will it be before there is pressure to break
it into multiple smaller networks because it is just too darn big?

Is it standard practice to use one's globally registered domain name
to name hosts connected via RFC 1918 subnets?  Who wants an ip address
without a domain name?  Even if you can't be seen on the Internet, that
doesn't mean you don't want to be seen on your local TCP/IP network.

Using views in bind 9 is an interesting feature, but it feels like a
kludge where I couldn't find any document covering this option on ISC's
web site.

Subject: [PLUG] Controversial web site...
Message-ID: <1163665509.9492.153.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

http://homepages.tesco.net/J.deBoynePollard/FGA/smtp-avoid-helo.html

According to this article, RFC2821 is flawed and anyone who tries to
use Postfix's reject non fully qualified helo hostname feature 
should stop doing so.  The increasing use of NAT is cited as a main 
reason.

I have seen discussions about Microsoft and Netscape mail servers
via google where claims that these servers are highly resistant to
attempts by administrators to set the helo hostname are rampant.  One
would think that the helo hostname for someone emailing out onto the
Internet from behind NAT has to be the hostname of the NAT router, but
it generally isn't and I've always wondered why.  According to this 
web site, no RFC says it has to be.

I'm trying to study smtp-proxying to see about changing my helo after
NAT where this article makes me wonder if that is even common practice,
let alone appropriate.  It appears there are at least some perl based
options, etc. if I should change the helo to match my NAT routers
external address.

My question, why does Postfix's documentation generally recommend
strong checking of the HELO/EHLO string including DNS checks of it?  
If the HELO/EHLO should be resolvable, when will an RFC come out 
mandating that it needs to be resolveable?

I don't know if this is the web site of someone who is frustrated
that has decided to state inaccurately what should be done concerning
helo checks, or if this person is onto something.

One approach is to say don't run a mail server behind NAT.  Security
wise though, who doesn't want to?

If this web site is correct, perhaps a lot of the how to configure
postfix to stop UCE and SPAM information needs to be changed.

How can I soften Postfix 2.0's helo checking features so that
an unknown or supposedly invalid helo leads to an email being
logged, forwarded, or put on hold instead of dropped?

I am with you Jeme as far as being frustrated about integrated
components on a lot of modern motherboards that Linux's most
recent stable kernel can't accelerate or even run at all in 
some cases.  A list of which motherboards Linux will
perform best on, where is it?  Hopefully, Linux will
accelerate more of these onboard video cards and use more
of the integrated sound cards that hit the market in the 
future.  This is why those who say AMD64 is great need to
back up in my opinion and ask, why aren't these boards 
perfectly supported by Linux or any other OSS operating 
system for that matter?  I really think a boycott is
appropriate.  AMD and Intel will shape up towards the OSS 
community if they can't sell enough new motherboards.  The
most effective stick is a company that puts out a 64 bit
offering that Linux works perfectly on where word of mouth
can convince people to favor it.  This will effectively hurt 
AMD if the company won't get serious enough about Linux
and either put something better out or release OSS drivers 
for the problematic integrated devices.

I have a big batch of photographs I want to scan, and I'm having problems 
getting good scans. They lose a bit of sharpness sharpness and the colors are 
off a little bit, even at the maximum resolution.  I'm using an Epson CX 
4800- of course the ink cartridges clogged themselves to death ages ago, as 
is the habit of Epson printers, so I only use the scanner. I use both Kooka 
and the Gimp to run the scans. 

Should I be looking at getting a different scanner, or different software? Or 
is it not realistic to expect perfect copies of photos from scans?

Having the ActionScript engine is a long way from having an open source

Just declare your local instance of BIND to be the master for the 
namespace in question. Your named.conf will look something like

  // where to find info on zones for which we're not master
  // or secondary
  zone "." IN {
    type hint;
    file "named.root";
  }

  // declare ourselves masters of the .robinson DNS space,
  // making hostnames like www.robinson or ftp.robinson
  // perfectly legal for all hosts that use this DNS server
  // for name resolution
  zone "robinson" IN {
    type master;
    file "zone.robinson";
  }

And so forth. I did a BIND writeup for Carla Schroder a couple years 
ago that has some practical examples and some links to weightier 
reference works:

  http://www.madboa.com/geek/soho-bind/

> Is it standard practice to use one's globally registered domain name

Practices vary widely. Often, internal subnets will be apportioned a 
distinctive slice of the public namespace like "intranet.bigcorp.com," 
but that's certainly not the only way to do it. If you control both 
the .net and .com versions of your namespace, you could reserve .net 
for internal and .com for external addresses...

I'd love to see more EE, math and physics grad students contributing to
open-source simulators, but if they're angling for industry jobs,
they'll be afraid of giving away their Secret Sauce.  (Never mind that
it'll all have been invented before, and what employers care about is
that they know how it works.)

That's a very cool Linux application you got there,

I'd look for an Intel-integrated video if I were you.  I was impressed
by the fact that with X.org 7.1, my work machine with the "crappy" Intel
video just worked with 3D-acceleration, whereas my home machine with a
"hot" NVidia card is a constant headache, dealing with binary drivers
and whatnot.  I wish everyone else would get on the "open-source driver
for our 3D chipsets" bandwagon.

I believe Microsoft owns 49% of Apple's stock.  Microsoft
is close enough to owning Apple if this is still the case.

Why did Apple dump Motorola?  I hear that Motorola 
processors have tended to lag behind Intel's, but I've also 
heard that they tend to be better engineered than Intel's
offerings as Motorola catches up.

If it's rubbish that Microsoft owns Apple, great.  I
seriously doubt that it is though with Apple going to
Intel effectively putting to death a significant 
source of competition to the WinTel monopoly.

WebTV isn't separate from Microsoft even though it
started out that way.  Why not Apple?

If Microsoft doesn't own Apple, why does Apple even bother
with IE and Outlook in Mac OS-X 10.3 and later?

Back in 1997, Microsoft purchased a 7% stake in Apple, but no voting 
rights came with the stock.

Nonsense. AS far as I can search MS bought 150,000 non-voting series A
convertible preferred shares in 1997 for $150 million. They have since
then sold them according to e-trade and a 2003 SEC filing from Apple.

They have owned Apple stock BUT NO WHERE NEAR 49%. Please don't pull
numbers out of your ass.

The PowerPC line of processors were JOINTLY developed my IBM and
Motorola with input from Apple. IMHO I believe the switch from a RISC
based Processor to x86 chips by apple was a matter of price and speed.
Not shoddy engineering.

How does architecture change affect Apples ability to compete with
Microsoft? If anything, switching to cheaper, EASIER to replace hardware
will be a major contributing factor to Apples continued success.  As of
October 18, 2006(according to Gartner) apple has 6.1 percent of the US
PC market. That is the ONLY PC maker that does not bundle Microsoft's
OS. They are right behind gateway, hp and dell respectively to hold the
4th position. 
That is a Small percentage but it is FAR greater than any Linux desktop
sales. 
 
> WebTV isn't separate from Microsoft even though it
> started out that way.  Why not Apple?

WebTV was a move by Microsoft to try to capture what they saw as an
emerging market. There is something alluring about being able to just
turn the TV on, check you email and then flip to Histories Mysteries.
What Microsoft didn't count on was dramatic PC price decreases and
continually dropping ISP charges.
I can even understand why your talking about WebTV in the same
conversation as a Microsoft acquisition of Apple.

> If Microsoft doesn't own Apple, why does Apple even bother

Umm.... Apple doesn't develop IE for the Mac, Microsoft does. Just like
Microsoft releases versions of Office on the Mac. Office is Microsoft's
cash cow, if Linux had 6.4% of the desktop market I bet you $50 that we
would see office released for it. Plus IE for the Mac has not been
developed since June of 2003, its stuck at Version 5 and there is no
real reason for Mac users to use it with browsers like Safari and
Firefox available. 

As far as Outlook goes, as far as I can research there is a version of
Outlook for the Mac called "Outlook 2001" that was released for Mac OS9
for the sole purpose of Mac clients to be able to access exchange
servers. OSX has a program called Entourage for interfacing with
exchange. 
 
But both of these are DEVELOPED by Microsoft for the Mac and not
Visa-versa.

I don't own a Mac, nor have I ever owned one, but I don't like people
saying absolutely random things just to spur potential arguments over
the internet. Especially when the random statements make absolutely no
sense.

Subject: [PLUG] Printer choice
Message-ID: <455E0D99.3060505@dslnorthwest.net>

It looks like I am in the market for a color printer. I will be replacing an HP 
Deskjet 930C. It is home use, low volume.  Some pictures; mostly text. I am 
running Kubuntu dapper.

I remember some comments here about HP putting disabling chips in their 
cartridges.  I have not done any cartridge refilling, but the idea of spending 
extra $ so that HP can force people to buy their cartridges irks.

I see that Epson C8X series is suggested for Linux on one website. Office Depot 
has the C88+ for $107.  (Is C88+ considered "C8X series"?)  I like the idea of 
more stable ink, separate cartridges, improved print speed.

Is this a reasonable choice?  Any other suggestions?

Thanks,
-Denis

Loosing a bit of sharpness is the nature of the beast.

Resolution != Color Balance, what kind of calibration have you done on the end to
end chain?  How are you judging color balance?

You should be able to get proper color balance.

   I've had satisfactory results with my HP ScanJet 5200C and Xsane. I also
use the GIMP to tune the resulting colors. When I scan at a sufficiently
high resolution, they look good to me on the monitor.

   There is a tool called something like LCM (for Little Color Maker?) that
allows you to calibrate monitors to printers. I've not fuzted with it.

Is your "mostly text" black on white? If the quantity of color work is
low, you might consider an inexpensive laser printer for home, and use
one of the many office services houses (Office Depot, Kinkos/FedEx, etc)
for your color work. Take them a .pdf and they can give you what you
expect the image to look like.

The last printer I bought (this past summer) was an Epson Photo R220.
The warning from the guys at The Printer Place (on SE Powell near 17th)
was to be sure to print the test page once every week or two so the
color heads don't clog. Look for a way to be sure you are only printing
black in the driver (I haven't tried this on my Linux machine so I don't
know what CUPS offers in the way of controlling what colors are used
when printing black). I didn't discover this until I noticed that the
color cartridges were depleting themselves, even though I rarely printed
anything with color.

Other than that, I've been happy with the R220. Now that the color ink
is almost gone, I've switched back to an old Brother HL-730DX laser
printer. Drums are only available from a remanufacturer (about $50), but
the toner is a separate replacement item that is still available, and
the drum will last through several toner cartridges.

I thought Alan might be a bit busy this week.  He told me I might be on 
my own to start the meeting on Monday, so I guess this is self-serve 
month :-)  Here's a bit more info.

Topic:

  WxPerl:  What I Learned the Hard Way
    An architectural overview of using the wxWidgets C++ GUI toolkit
    with Perl on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

OR:  How to have a decent and perlish architecture in spite of being 
subjected to obscenely verbose reams of C++ documentation, overly 
academic examples, slow wikis, and infectious misconceptions.

  PLUG Bonus:  tricks for developing Windows software on Linux

  o wxWidgets -- what it is and what it can do for you
  o interlude:  mac users heckling loudly
  o Wx (aka wxPerl) -- crazy, but true!
  o dotReader:  an open-source e-book reader written in Perl
  o getting started / documentation
  o cross platform development (aka fun with vnc)
  o installation (aka fun with make/nmake/bake/shake/quake)
  o getting past getting started
  o code generation (or not)
  o event driven OOP -- how to have your cake without eating your hair
  o callbacks with closures, methods, and accessors
  o testing
  o building
  o testing
  o packaging and deployment on windows, mac, and linux
  o no really, testing

I've spent the last several months designing and building a large 
(10kLOC and growing in 81 modules) e-book reader system complete with a 
comprehensive test suite, pluggable, reskinnable architecture, 
cooperative multitasking, network-transparent connectivity, blah, blah, 
blah.  The dotReader source code will be released as GPL on Nov. 22nd.

This may even include a live demo.

 From what I've gathered it would have been impossible to compete with thermals and 
power consumption vs cpu power with ppc chipsets as compared vs. x86, so that would 
suggest a purely non-speed related choice. Apple really focuses on the laptops, the 
desktops are IMO marginal business for them and likely far less profitable.

As for price, one could argument that AMD might have beaten Intel, but one should assume 
that both Intel and AMD have shown designs way before anyone else in the market when 
Apple started shopping, and at the time Intel likely had quite an edge with Yonah/Intel 
Core.

On top of that IBM is taking power in a direction which seems orthogonal to 
desktop/office design. It all just seems too logical to me.

Cheers,

Auke

Subject: [PLUG] Formatting thumb drive
Message-ID: <20061117192513.013ee621.johnxj@comcast.net>

About a month ago I lost my 512 MB thumb drive. While waiting for it to
show up in the bottom of the washing machine (where such devices always
end up), I decided I needed a thumb drive badly enough that I bought a
brand new 1 GB drive. Last week the first one appeared in the bottom of
my backpack, so now I have two thumb drives. 

Both are SanDisk Cruzer drives. The first one performs just fine. The
second one also performs fine, but when I stick it in a USB port at a
PSU lab computer, Windows XP finds an auto-launch file that pops up a
SanDisk browser utility. This utility doesn't launch on Linux,
presumably because it is just a Windows utillity. Now, the browser
utility is really annoying. It has SanDisk plastered all over it and
stuff. There is an .exe file on the drive that evidently launches the
utility. I tried to nuke the .exe file while at the university, but
Windows XP refused to delete it. Later, with the drive on my Linux
computer I successfully deleted it.

I thought that would take care of the matter, but the next day I put it
in the USB port on a PSU computer. The damn utility popped back up
again. Lo and behold, the .exe file was back! So, sitting at the PSU
computer I pulled my Ubuntu laptop out, booted it, and stuck the thumb
drive in its USB port. The .exe file was there again. So I nuked it
again. Then I put the thumb drive back in the PSU computer. The utility
popped back up and the .exe file was back on the thumb drive!

Now, this has me seriously pissed off. If SanDisk wants to blast me
with their advertising, then they should pay *me* to use their drive.
My questions for this group are: HTF did SanDisk do this? Has SanDisk
made a pact with the devil Gates? And do I assume correctly that if I
use my Linux computer to reformat the drive (FAT32), I will finally
exorcise the evil installed on it by SanDisk?

Well ... have you tried formatting it on the Windows machine? My 
experience has been that formatting a USB drive on Linux

mkfs -t vfat -F 32 /dev/sdxn

gives you something that Linux has no problems with, but Windows may or 
may not like. However, if you format it on Windows, Linux won't have a 
problem with it.

Now -- on to mounting. You might need to mount your flash drive 
"umask=000" on Linux. In some cases, you'll need to be root to write on 
it if you don't do that.

Finally, unless you want to move stuff around between Windows, MacOS and 
Linux systems on it, there's really not much reason to format it FAT32. 
If you're going to use it exclusively on Linux, ext2 is a much better 
way. For one thing, the bogosities associated with upper and lower case 
translations go away, and the umask=000 isn't necessary.

Maybe, but why do you need to?  (Formatting a usb drive on Linux may 
render it incompatible with some computers (I've seen trouble just 
trying to mount it on different linux boxen), though that seems to have 
been healed in recent kernels.)

I'm wondering if you're actually getting it deleted or just wandering 
into something funky with the automounter.  If you do the following, do 
you still see the files on the second ls?  If not, then try the windows 
box and see if something really funky is going on.

  mount /dev/sda1 /media/usb
  ls -a /media/usb/
  # rm whatever files offend you
  umount /media/usb
  mount /dev/sda1 /media/usb
  ls -a /media/usb/

Is the second one a  "U3" drive? If so, the utilities on it are designed to
be on it.

Here's a web site explaining it... and supposedly, how to remove them.

I returned the motherboard I had previously used and got another one from 
the same manufacturer that used the nforce3 chipset.  All of the chipset 
features are well-supported in Linux and it has both TV output, DVI, and 
is apparently capable of dual VGA.  I did have to pay an extra $22.

I'm quite happy now, however.

Too bad the machine's not mine.

yeah, typo. That should be 45? 31' North, 122? 39' West, although it's

The Clinic is definitely Sunday, November 19. Officially 1 pm to 5 pm,
but some of us will be there earlier to start setting things up.

Thanks! That did it. The uninstall utility popped up a window saying it
could not run because it required XP, not 2000. But it offered
"continue" as well as "quit," so I clicked on "continue." It proceeded
to work anyway. Except it offered to wipe the U3 stuff and leave the
data, but that part didn't work. It wiped it clean. Oh well. It's now a
plain USB flash drive.

But a warning to y'all -- don't buy a new SanDisk drive, because
evidently they all now come with this craptacular U3 junkware.

Don't know why it should. I plan to be there around noon, or shortly

I've been out of the area for a year now, since moving to Hailey,
Idaho.  A year here has been long enough for me to forget that crimes
like this happen.  I am sorry that living in Portland means dealing
with dishonest people who will steal from their neighbors.  Here's
hoping that the stolen goods are recovered.

Just to cover all bases here: Chuck Wheeler left his modem at the Clinic on
Sunday.  There was no immediate way to get a message to him that we
could figure out.  I took the modem home with me, and emailed a request
to Hevanet (Chuck's ISP) support to relay a message to him, by phone if 
possible.
I also left a note at the FreeGeek front desk with my name and phone
numbers. I CC'd Chuck at his Hevanet address just in case he has some
other way to get to his account.

Hosting email should be simple, but it isn't - thanks to all the

As a result, I'm tryed of hosting my own mail and I'm looking around
for a hosted solution for a few domains.  What do people recommend?
What are the pros and cons to gmail for domains?

I've been using their service for my domain for a while with no real
complaints, the Jabber integration is a nice touch as well.

Hosting your own email is more work than it seems to be worth. Aside
from the shear geek factor, given that there is probably someone out
there who will pay you *good* money for the exact same effort, why
bother?

about half full. So that means maybe eight seats are available.
You can register via the Red Hat site or via the local site:

Hello Pluggers,

I need some help understanding how to do something to an
older kernel.
I need to backport the kexec feature to a 2.6.10 kernel to
make use of kdump for kernel core dumps.
My current attempts have proved, I need to learn more.

Please lets limit the discussion to how to accomplish the task
at hand or an alternate method to capture kernel panics with  a core
and still recover without user intervention.

I am not currently able to move from the 2.6.10 kernel for
technical reasons outside of my influence.

   But, Paul, Terry is much less noisy than are the cicadas, and there's only
one of him, not a whole swarm that darkens the skies (which the NW winters
do all by themselves) and eat everything in sight (he was quite slim, last I
saw).

Message-ID: <4561F746.8000405@cooper.stevenson.name>

Hello Everyone,

I am in need of a quality hosting provider who offers leased hardware. I 
am looi
king for a provider who simply provides rackspace and hardware with 
technical su
pport in an emergency. If, say, one of the conrollers on the primary 
servers fai
l, I will want an on-sight administrator to resolve the issue.

The provider should meet the following criteria:

  --Main fiber loop bandwidth, preferably across two rings for added 
speed and redundancy
 
  --Serial --> IP access should one of the server's networking 
subsystems fail
 
  --Available on-site staff 7/24/356
 
  --Power redundancy, preferable via dual grid location and/or generator 
backup
 
We wish to move our servers from New York to a local provider.


Thanks,


-Coop

I've never used managed hosting, but I've heard great things about
easystreet. I believe they meet all of your requirements, and then some.
They're a great ISP, FWIW.

Actually, you probably don't need to.  Did you check the -MM patches?

Can you give any information on how your current attempts did not work,
so we don't duplicate effort?

Let's do any dang thing we like, since you're not paying me to read your

It'd be gratifying to know what those reasons are.

My guess is the help docs didn't get installed. Usually they're separate 
packages, so yum search [packagename] ought to find them.

Gennies are fine. We tested ours weekly and it worked great.

We are looking for hosting for 6 1U servers:

  2 Front-end request servers
  3 Mongrel proxy request recipient servers to handle Ruby requests
  1 MySQL server

I'm comfortable with out-of-state servers. It's natural, of course, that 
I look to servers in Oregon first. We host servers that automatically 
process condominium transactions. Paying the invoice for ISP staff 
on-site is a lot less painful than explaining to your client why their 
site isn't online processing transactions. I haven't been there 
personally but it's pretty clear to me when you ask that it's a lot 
easier to ask a higher price for critical service up front than to try 
to reclaim a customer's trust after a system failure.

While we're always looking to keep costs to a minimum, we never do so at 
the expense of top service.

Thank you for your recommendation--it's spot-on to what I need.

Only when purchased via Haliburton. He's considerably cheaper on eBay.

I spoke with EasyStreet. I found their sales associate knowledgeable and 
easy to work with. I had mentioned earlier that I required multiple 
stand-alone servers. EasyStreet told me that this wasn't a problem. 
That's great; the several virtual hosters I've spoken with struck me as 
kind of like the "Model T" of the ISP world, "you can have any distro 
you want so long as it's Red Hat."

Further--and may the geeks forgive me--I'm not interested in mantaining 
the hardware. When there's a problem, I need the hot-swap automatically 
failover while the on-site staff work with the hardware. This is much 
better, of course, than saying to the client, "oh, I'm driving to the 
ISP now. It'll be online, (meekly) I promise."

That's a conversation you _do_not_ want to have. EasyStreet has a plan 
available for just this arrangement.

Thanks for the tip!

I had not looked at the -mm patches but will look now.  Thanks for the
pointer, I don't
normally think about that series of kernels.
I had tried the -mm patches from http://www.xmission.com/~ebiederm/files/kexec/
for the 2.6.10 kernel but they had too many not found files to allow
them to work.

1) Patch files from http://www.xmission.com/~ebiederm/files/kexec/
specifically 2.6.10-mm2-kexec2.tgz and 2.6.10-mm2-kexec3.tgz.
Neither of these could be applied because of missing files.

2) Raw diff from 2.6.10 to 2.6.18 produced a patch file of about 450MB
which I would not
even try to apply.
3) Limit the above to only x86 arch and main line code.  Still about
150MB patch.
4) Grep for kexec KEXEC in the 2.6.18 kernel, do diffs on those files
between both kernels,
   remove non-x86 arch files and Kconfig depconfig.  This came the
closest but had error during the build process that although related
to the patch, are in files that have nothing to do with kexec code.

In relationship to other patches I have applied,  squashfs 3.0 went in
without a glitch and
worked first time.

Because we are currently locked-in to using a Montavista supported
kernel and tool chain
that supports boards that are unavailable from the general community at large.

Sorry, I sometimes forget that the people here don't know what my
problem is without
totally describing it (I know what my problem is, why don't you ;) ).
I guess my telepathy
isn't working so good today.

Most likely this means the servers in your /etc/yum.repos.d/ are down, or your 
config files are goobered. You should have a fedora.repo file that looks 
something like this:

[base-i386]
name=base-i386
baseurl=http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/5/i386/os/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1

Every repository needs a separate configuration file. 

This is a good page on configuring Yum repositories:

I don't know the answer. I do know that upgrading Breezy to Dapper
(last August) created an installation that wouldn't even boot, except
in recovery mode. And in recovery mode I had so many unresolved
dependencies, which turned out to be truly unresolvable, that I had to
create a brand new installation for Dapper and trash the old breezy. I
recall one of the problems was LVM.

I also know that *the* place to ask questions and get answers is the
Ubuntu forums:

http://ubuntuforums.org

But an unrelated question: Why are you upgrading to Dapper and not all
the way to Edgy, which was recently released?

It is work?

Aside from periodic tweaking of the spam filtering engines, where's the work?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0611210800000.15534@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Emacs has an outline mode that identifies levels by the number of
pre-pended asterisks. However, for source code (specifically python right
now), a line cannot begin with asterisks.

   Has anyone used this capability with source code to find functions more
quickly? Or, has anyone modified the indicators from asterisks to something a
language recognizes as comments?

sounds like you have a business opportunity for those that don't want to

Once an e-mail system is up and running (not an easy task, but it's 
essentially a one-time thing), the time-consuming work is two-fold:

  * user and list maintenance: accounts, aliases, and lists
  * customization support: filters, shared folders, etc

That sort of work may be carried out by a systems staff, but it's 
defined and driven by the business customer. Unless that's customer's 
needs are *very* static, my opinion is that it's impossible for a 
viable business to not "want to deal with their own mail server."

You may not think of accounts, aliases, et al. as the real work of 
maintaining a mail infrastructure, but imho it is. It's possible to 
outsource the systems end of the deal, but the day-to-day tasks never 
go away because they're business issues, not technical ones.

I use speedbar to quicky navigate functions.  I've never tried it with
python though.

Another possibility, if the normal outline mode won't work for you, is
to use allout
   http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/AllOut
It looks to be more configurable.

Ali,

   I rarely use the "thumb" on the scrollbar. I have ctrl-v and alt-v bound
to PgDn and PgUp, but it's not very efficient.

   Thank you. It looks like I need to study it for a while so I'll put that
on the to-do list for when I have time.

Rich, have I got an editor for you!! It's called Leo (Literate Editor 
for Outlines). It's written in Python and does exactly that sort of 
thing. If you're spoiled by vim or emacs, it will connect to both of 
them. Check it out at

Ed,

   It looks like a stand-alone product with tcl/tk for a GUI widget set. I'll
look to see if its functionality can be used from within emacs.

   The reason I'm on this issue is that some of my module files are getting
large, and I want to navigate quickly among bound methods and other
functions. Years ago (mid-1980s to mid-1990s), when I was writing in C on
DOS I used a wonderful editor called Multi-Edit. It had the ability to
collapse the code based on a starting column. So, for example, since all
functions began in column 1, I could collapse the code and see only the
first line of each function. Moving the cursor to that line and expanding
the display put me just where I wanted to be. Much as I like emacs, I would
like to regain that capability.

   Speedbars (thanks, Ali!), and other options may do the trick. With
speedbars active I can see all the files in the directory, but I need to see
if I can tag classes and methods in .py files so they're directly
accessible, too.

Thanks,

Rich

Ed,

   I've discovered two wonderfully useful things this morning: 1) speedbars
is installed in my emacs ('m-x speedbars' brings it right up), and B)
clicking with both buttons on a .py file name icon displays the included
classes while a double click on the class name icon displays the included
methods. This is exactly the functionality I sought (thank you again, Ali!)
and even better than Multi-Edits approach because it's in a separate window
and lets me work in the main display while it's open.

I am curious whether you know about ECB, or Emacs Code Browser.  It opens
speedbar and a few other neat buffers when you do an "M-x ecb-activate". 
One of the buffers is a class browser that I have seen work well for java,
C, lisp and php.  I'll bet it can do python too.  The buffer shows info
like the following (a java example).  If you middle-click a line, it jumps
you to that part of the code.

   I was sent two Gannt charts created in MS Project. I need to be able to
view them in a format available to linux. Does someone have access to that
application who would be willing to print them as PostScript files or
otherwise translate them to a format I can use?

Carlos,

   No, I did not know of this, and it's not on my system. However, I'll go
look for it as soon as I get the M$ Project Gannt charts translated.

Yes, it started working a while later. The original problem
is the same though - nothing appears when I click on help
for ANY graphical program. I guess it's time to reinstall -
no time to troubleshoot.

   Nevermind. I discovered the ganttproject on sourceforge and it does the

Sometimes my email server(s) work trouble free and everything is fine.
This will go on for months, but then something will go wrong.
I mean, I always seem to have some unexpected difficulty come up every
now and then.

I have had email servers compromised or attacked with DOS attacks
several times - maybe as often as once every two years.

I'm always fighting SPAM or trying to break thru SPAM filters.
One of my domains was miss handled in the past (before it was mine)
and is now SPAM MAGNET CENTRAL.
I need very good SPAM filtering for this domain.
Google does a fair job, but even google has problems with accounts on
this domain.

At times, I have had an isp change my ip number, which would be fine -
except the new ip number was in everyone's black hole list.  Ever try
to get an ip number removed from a black hole list?  Some of the black
hole list administrators won't remove an ip for any reason.  Or have
you ever tryed to send mail to someone whose mail server is
mistakingly blocking your domain?  Or have you ever set your SPAM
filters too tight and blocked out important mail?

Believe me, problems happen with mail servers.

You might look at the source RPM from CentOS 4; it's 2.6.9-based kernel
and ships with kexec/kdump; there's probably a patch specifically for
it.  Porting it forward from 2.6.9 to 2.6.10 is probably much easier
than porting 2.6.18 back to 2.6.10.

   The ganntproject tool works OK, but for one file -- or exporting as pdf

increase that temporarily?

Try the options listed at 'java -X' (assuming this is Sun Java).

   Thanks, Bill. The shell script that starts the application had -Xmx256m,
and I increased that to 512m. One file still won't load and the other won't
finish exporting to pdf. I added the -Xms512m and will see if that helps ...

   Nuts! I think it's a bug in the application. I'll contact the author(s).

Wil,

   Thank you. The problems seem to be bugs in the application. On the
sourceforge-hosted forum I found a message posted today that the same export
errors were seen by someong running winduhs-XP.

   Well, I wrote too soon. One loads, but does not let me navigate back from
today and crashes after 75% of the process toward a .pdf. The second one
crashes the application trying to load.

   Both issues were reported (one just yesterday) by Winduhs users on the
help forum at sourceforge.net. I added a 'me, too' to both, but that's where
it stands.

I suspected it might be .bash_profile or .bashrc crashing, but the

The loadkeys command appears to be connected to the kbd package.  I'm
sure at a loss as to what these errors are being caused by though.  
What permissions are causing this problem?

I thought I had corrupted my admin account, so I added a new one to

Only root logins don't generate the above errors.

If you have search pattern highlighting enabled, and your last search
was for whitespace (unusual, but it happens), then that could be the
cause.  Run a new search for something highly unlikely (e.g.,
"asdfasdf"), or disable search highlighting (":nohlsearch").

Prehaps you might want to sample the various coloschemes in vim.  Try
":colorscheme <TAB> <TAB> <TAB> etc." to cycle through all the
available ones.  If none of these work for you, it is possible to make
your own.

I like colorscheme "ron", personally.  Highlighted text is red in this
colorscheme, I believe.

That was it!  The :nohlsearch command does not seem to turn it off though...
At least I can now get rid of the annoying brown blocks all over my screen
using a nonsense search.

Subject: [PLUG] Web site programming
Message-ID: <20061122105316.0fd4f524.johnxj@comcast.net>

Consider this a question from a total dumbass who knows zero about
website creation.

I want to create a website that will function as an electronic version
of flash cards. There would be a list of questions, each with a
drop-down selection tool. When the student has finished selecting the
answers for the page, there will be a button for "check answers."
Clicking on the button would then present the student with the
drop-downs showing the correct answer, and if the student selected the
wrong answer, it would show the correct answer in red. Perhaps a little
score box with a percentage correct would be nice as well.

There would be several hundred questions. Each time the student opened
the page it would present 20-30 or so selected at random from the
several hundred. Thus, the student would always be presented with a new
set of questions. The student could use the website to practice until
they finally get an acceptable score.

There is an additional problem to surmount: The drop-downs and some of
the text on the page must be displayed in a font that has a complete
set of characters for the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). There
are several available that are open source and freely distributable
(Junicode comes to mind). The problem I have discovered is that many
peoples' browsers do not display the characters properly. I have never
had a problem on my Linux computer, but I think it is because Firefox
and Opera both installed themselves with UTF-8 in the settings by
default. Or maybe it's because Ubuntu set UTF-8 as the default for the
whole operating system. I just know it works and I never had to mess
with anything to get it to work. I note at PSU computer labs the
browsers are set to Western-something, and they do not always display
the characters properly. Whatever it takes to get the students'
browsers to display the characters properly must be added as an
instruction page. That means that I need to figure out what settings
need to be fixed for each popular browser on each popular OS.

The first set of problems would contain questions like:

1. voiced alveolar stop        [ ]  <-- drop-down with IPA characters
2. voiceless velar fricative   [ ]  etc.

Other than needing the display the IPA characters correctly, I'm pretty
sure this is just a matter of tying a database with fields for the
"question" and for the IPA characters to the page. I have no idea how
this is done, but I assume I can learn it. However, I also want to make
a similar page where the "question" is a sound file, using the same IPA
character drop-downs as above. This may be a bigger problem. I know it
is possible to have sounds on a website -- there are lots of them out
there that I have been using. However, would it be possible to tie
several hundred sound files in a database for the questions, so that
the sound files would be presented randomly? In other words, in the
example above, instead of "voiced alveolar stop" and "voiceless velar
fricative" I want icons for sound files to be displayed. The student
would click on the icon, the sound clip would play in whatever plugin
they have installed in their browser, then the student would select the
correct IPA character from the drop-down. When finished the student
would click on the "check answers" button, etc.

I'm assuming that I have a long learning curve ahead of me to figure
out how to do all of this. But before I decide to spend winter break
learning website creation with databases, is the above possible? And
does anyone have hints for how to get browsers to display the
characters correctly?

Use WebGUI http://www.plainblack.com/support

It has a built-in Survey module that will do almost everything that you
want.  It shouldn't be too hard to alter to do the subset of questions
from the total set.

Ciao,

A friend of mine needs someone to write an article on Java licensing.  Any
credible writers with knowledge in this way would be considered, with decent
remuneration.  She writes:

"I'm looking for a credentialed, Java-focused writer who can provide a
development timeline for the Java platform (similar in structure to this
article on Linux: http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6000), beginning with
its inception, through the introduction of various standards bodies,
including the JCP and other standards bodies, and articulate the differences
in licensing among Sun's CDDL and the open GPL and Apache licenses without
editorializing."

If you're interested, please send outlines/abstracts to jaloi at us.ibm.com.

Would this be plain ol' random, where there could be repeats, or a
shuffle (like a deck of cards), where there would be no repeats?

IMO the best way to deal with this is to simply use GIF images of the
IPA characters.  Make sure the images are pulled from static URLs on
the webserver so the browser can cache them easily.

You do lose the ability to have the characters in drop-down boxes, but
for a multiple-choice test, it's nicer to have all the options lined-up,
visible and clickable rather than hidden inside a combobox.

It's also possible to make the GIF/IPA thing configurable; maybe there's
even a reliable way to ask the browser if it can display IPA.

Most definitely.  Any way you like from Perl/CGI to Ruby on Rails.

Yup.  Databases can hold anything, including pathnames to the
soundfiles, or the soundfiles themselves.  Might want to have a
configuration thingy at the beginning to choose what sort of soundfiles
to use.  (I.e. "Click here.  If that doesn't work, click here.")

Ever since I made an ugly voicemail-retrieval webpage for an Asterisk
server, I've been looking for good examples of pages with clickable
cross-platform sounds.  If you run across any, lemme know.

No time limits or set response times. It would be for practice sessions
that students could do on their own time. A learning resource, not a
required activity. It would be best if it could be made "fun," that is,
perhaps a reward if the score on a page is high enough or something.

There should be repeats. That would increase the difficulty level, but
that is a good thing. Students do not learn the answers if they derived
the right answer by counting cards. (I hate Bridge, because I can never
remember what has been played.)

OK, this might work. But there are 110 IPA "letters," plus about 20
superscripts, and about 30 diacritics, any of which could appear on
about half the characters. Suppose I put GIFs of all ~160 characters at
the top of the page, and each question just has a box in which to type
the character, two spaces wide. The student puts the cursor in the box
next to a question, clicks on the appropriate GIF image(s), and the
character with diacritics and/or superscripts appear in the box. This
would be better than a drop-down box because, as you point out, all the
glyphs are visible at once. The only drawback is the space on the page
that the display of characters takes up.

> It's also possible to make the GIF/IPA thing configurable; maybe there's

If I am correct and the secret is to set the browser to UTF-8, then
that's what the site needs to query the browser about. However, the IPA
font must appear in the box next to the question when the student
clicks on a GIF image, and that means the box must be set to use a font
that has the IPA characters. Windows boxes have Arial Unicode and
Lucida Sans Unicode, both of which have the full IPA character set. I
assume there is a way to set the boxes to use a certain font.

I have to learn a programming language? Can't I just get an app where I
can poke at stuff until it works? Colin's suggestion of WebGUI sounded
pretty good.

That brings up another question. Turns out I not only know next to
nothing about website programming, I also know little about sound file
formats. Assuming I want to be www compliant, and I want to support IE,
Firefox, Opera and Safari and the three OSs, MacOS, Linux and Windows,
what would be the most compatible sound format?

I tried out the demo, but it wouldn't run on Firefox. Undaunted, I
tried Opera, and discovered that it wouldn't run on Opera either. But
at least Opera told me why -- it needs the latest Flash plugin. Most
Linux boxes I know of do not have the latest Flash plugin and some
people disable it completely. Not very reassuring.

The flash demo is just eye candy.  It doesn't do anything useful
except show pieces of WebGUI with their icons.

Just log in as Admin, delete the flash demo, and add a Survey.  Then
tinker with it.

Oh, with respect to your other post, to extend the Survey module
you will have to know perl.  But it would be easier to find someone
to tweak an existing piece of software than to write one from the
ground up.

Subject: [PLUG] remapping port with iptables
Message-ID: <20061122230643.GA14683@gate.kl-ic.com>


I have a 2.6.X server with a static IP address, connected directly
to the net, and running iptables.  It does not do NAT.  I am running
an application as nobody, and want to connect to a privileged tcp port
( port number < 1023 ) so I can get there through firewalls with 
restrictions.  One way for my app to be able to reconnect to the
privileged port is to remap it to an unprivileged port > 1024 .

Lets say I want to map the external port 321 on eth0 to port 3456
where the application can grab it.  I think it is possible to do
this with NAT rules and IPTABLES.  But I am not an iptables expert,
and could use some review and some confidence building.  Who can help?

If I understand correctly, there are two actions needed: (1) a PREROUTING
rule that does "destination NAT" and rewrites packets with destination
address 321 into packets with destination address 3456.  Next, (2) a
POSTROUTING rule that does "source NAT" and rewrites packets with
source address 3456 into packets with source address 321.  Perhaps
these two rules:

iptables -t nat -A  PREROUTING -d $ETH0 -p tcp --dport  321 -j DNAT \
         --to-destination $ETH0:3456
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s $ETH0 -p tcp --sport 3456 -j SNAT \
         --to-source $ETH0:321

... along with some magic line of stuff for my iptables rules (what?)
that figures out what $ETH0 is (the ip address of eth0).

What I am not sure about is what happens when an external client connects
to another application on my server, and my server assigns a port number
to complete the connection the other way.  Is iptables smart enough to
tell the application or the kernel not to use 3456?

Any suggestions, oh iptables wise ones?

Here's one possible solution.  Examine the Accept-Charset HTTP header
and look for utf-8 support.  Here's a wireshark packet trace of a GET
request:

GET http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/IPA/ipafonts.html HTTP/1.1

If-None-Match: "52b745271548c61:9c3"
Cache-Control: max-age=0

If a client supports UTF-8, then give him a page in which the
Content-Type is set:

<META http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/>

Note: if you are sending XML pages to the client rather than HTML
pages, change the MIME type accordingly to text/xml.  I would use
UTF-8 for both the XML and the XSLT pages in this case.  But it's
unlikely you'll be going that route if you're not doing web
development as a paying gig.  Only paying gigs will go through that
much trouble to produce a web page.

Here's some links:

http://depts.washington.edu/llc/help/presentations/unicode_ipa/1_introduction.html
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html

Keep in mind that unicode is a mapping of integers to characters (a
"character set"), while UTF-8 is a way to express those integers as
bytes in a computer file (a "character encoding").  The IPA characters
are part of the unicode character set (or so I think I have read),
which implies that they will not change from computer to computer,
since the unicode character set is wide enough to have a unique code
for every character on earth (or so they claim).  With UCS-4, a
4-byte-wide unicode character set, this is believable.

 I can't believe that Gnome shoves Totem and CUPS down the throats of

   Ya' gotta' watch them garden gnomes, Keith.

   In my copy of Firefox-1.5.0.7, Edit->Preferences->Download invokes a
dialog box. The bottom section has a button labeled, "View and Edit
Actions." In the list window that displays, you can edit the application
used to display, play, or whatever with data files of different extensions.

   I'd replace references to 'totem' with that of 'mplayer' and give it a
test drive.

   Plan B: In 1.5.0.7 under Tools in the top menu, do you have an item called
"Media Connectivity?" Here that brings up a sub-menu with three additional
items: "List all media links on page," "Check for embedded media now," and
"Configure." The latter is where I have futzed trying to get video and
ungarbled sound to work again. (Still not there, but it's a low priority
here.)

Dude.. Wait. What?

Plus doesn't mplayer have some stuff in it that makes it less than "pure" in

Subject: [PLUG] APC Smart Slot and NUTS...
Message-ID: <1164269072.9050.78.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Does anyone use an APC Smart Slot 9607 on an APC SU1000NET
UPS with network ups tools?  I'm running nut on three 
connected Linux servers.  Right now, I only have signal 
to one of them.  

I'm trying to decide if buying two more serial smart cables 
and this smart slot or picking up two more SU1000NET UPS'es, 
possibly without batteries, is the better way to go.  Can
one of these units without a battery still signal?  Can 
nuts be configured to use the signal off of one these UPS'es 
if it doesn't have a battery?  Well, I have to buy or make 
another signal cable or two either way, but what I'm essentially 
noticing is that the price difference doesn't seem all that 
great between the smart slot plus 2 serial smart cables route 
verses second unit without battery or accessories route.  The 
latter route does become more expensive by the time I get a
2nd signal cable and replace the battery, but why spend money 
on a smart slot if I'm going to acquire more physical 
units anyways?

I am leaning toward getting more units so I can eventually 
increase the runtime.  I really don't want to make any one 
of these three servers depend on the other two for signal.
With the smart slot 9607 option, I don't know if I would create
the problem of all three servers trying to control one 
UPS fighting each other over it.

I'm thinking, "get a good battery later," no big deal if I 
can use a unit without a good battery just for signal.

If the smart slot serial port expander that allows for two more
signal cables works with nuts, that could give me independent
signal. Unfortunately, the smart slot solution will not increase 
runtime.  A unit without a battery on ebay is about $10 more 
than the combination of a smart slot and two more smart cables
(shipped).   

A new battery can be had for around $70 shipped unless there is a
cheaper local source of RBC6 replacement batteries?

If I use network ups tools to capture signal off an APC Smart SU1000NET,
can I add an APC Smart Slot 9607 to signal two more nut enabled machines
independently?  If there are problems with Smart Slot 9607 and nut, can
I use another SU1000NET without a battery installed for a
secondary signal source instead?

Message-ID: <1164316018.10557.7.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

It's an ISA memory mapped scsi card that Iomega bundled with the
Bernoulli MultiDisk 150 drive.  I've been trying to modprobe
g_NCR5380 ncr_irq=255 ncr_addr=D000 ncr_53c400=1
to get it running.

This looks my Redhat 6.2 system up hard, but I do see a message
that there is 1 detected scsi host.

I get this error about a connected devices command not existing.
I saw a chip on the card that looks like it says NCR 53c400.  I'm
starting to wonder if Iomega did something strange.
I'm also wondering if I can plug this Bernoulli drive,
via adapter, into another scsi card?  I suppose the next thing to
try is unplugging the Bernoulli drive and seeing if the scsi card
driver will fire up without it.  What is it with kernel modules
taking the whole system down if they are not happy on load?

I have not had any problems with cups.

Totem, on the other hand, is an abomination.

 I don't know what it takes in Ubuntu.  (I'm not into Pokimon.)  In Fedora,
there is a "totem-mozilla-plugin" package that you have to remove.  (Not
certain on the name.  Use "rpm -qa | grep totem" for the real name of the
package.)

There are lpd to cups support libraries that handle the old stuff.  It has
worked fine for me.

I wonder what you play?  mplayer is one of the few that does almost
everything for me.  The reason I removed the totem plug in is that it
interfears with the realaudio plugin.  (Which I need to listen to BBC
6music.)

Xine also works well for me.  (Especially for DVDs.)  I have yet to get
Totem to play anything correctly that is not a patent free codec.

Using GNU tar (which is probably what you have), it's easy

  tar -x -C /usr/local/bin -f /usr/local/src/jim.tar

Subject: [PLUG] web site navigation map
Message-ID: <596193188.1164739510229.JavaMail.root@fepweb06>

Is it possible to automatically build a map of web navigation for a web site. . For a simple web site, you can just try out all the links and write down where they go, but for a large complex site this is impractical. I've searched around the net and so far have not been successful; possibly I'm mlooking for the wrong keywords.

What I mean is generating something like the following ('m calling it a web site navigation map; is there a better term?). What I've written below is strictly hierarchical, but there certainly can be backward links or links skipping a level.

Home page
   Link1 (goes to PageLink1)
      SubLink1 (a link on PageLink1; goes to PageSubLink1)
         SubSubLink1 (a link on PageSubLink1...
         .
         .
   Link2
       SubLink2
   Link3

If all your HTML pages live in a filesystem, it's easy to 
conceptualize a simple program that would

 1. walk the filesystem,

 2. grab page titles and relative locations from the HTML
    files it encounters,

 3. build a PHP or SSI snippet containing a nav menu (referenced
    by each of the HTML pages containing a nav menu).

There are just too many snags for this to be practical:

 1. Menu text is usually a much shorter version of the target
    page's actual <title>...</title> text.

 2. What about pages you want to appear is multiple contexts?
    (OK, I guess symlinks would work, but it's kludgy...)

 3. What about HTML pages that you don't want to show up in
    a menu?

 4. What about automatically generated pages that don't appear
    in the filesystem or that appear via some CGI, Alias or
    Rewrite magic?

Additionally, my opinion is that the best menus are context-sensitive: 
they show you where you are in the navigational hierarchy and expand 
only that section of the site; other sections are represented in the 
menu only by their top-level entries.

For my money, it's best to develop a way to store and poll metadata 
about your site's page hierarchy. It could be a static PHP or SSI 
file, a simple structured text file, a semi-simple XML file, or data 
stored in a RDBMS.

Thanks for responding. You are correct; a context sensitive menu is  best. My desire for a web site navigation map, though, is not so that I can put it on the web site.

I am faced with a large complex site with literally hundreds of pages and yes, some are automatically generated, I believe. I want to improve/refactor the navigation. What I was hoping for was a tool that would walk the site for me and give me a list of everything that was available and how you get there. The how is not its location in the file system but rather what you have to do in your browser to get there, following the rules of the site (that is, not typing in a url in the address bar). You know, going down a navigation tree until you reach a leaf and then back up and down another.

I wanted this map so that I could see the current situation before I muck it up. 

For a simple site, one can just click around and draw such a map in your notebook. But for a large complex site, this is very impractical.

Have you looked at the wget tool?  It has a recursive option for grabbing an
entire site (depending on how its navigation works).  That would download
all the pages in HTML form, as they appear to browsers.  At that point, you
might write something to parse through the pages and look for <a> tags,
building the map as it goes.

On the other hand, if you find a tool that will do all this for you, let us
know!

There are tools out there that will follow the links in a website.  They
are mostly for finding broken links and such, but they may prove useful in
your case.  Here's a starting point:

Yup.  It's called a "sitemap".

Thanks to those who responded about my request for sitemap generation. I downloaded and used Heritrix and Sitemapper. I haven't got the information I want out of eilther but this is definitely a start. The jargon seems to be "web crawler" for what I'm looking for. The key things to look for are 1) how you limit where it crawls (you don't want to map the entire Internet) and 2) how it determines what a link is.

I've got a new LCD monitor.  It looks OK with VGA 15 pin, but it
would look better with DVI .  Sadly, the video cards in the stores
are mostly fast-rendering game engines, which burn lots of electrical
power.  The few low-cost low-power cards I've seen are VGA only.

Any suggestions for low power DVI video cards (with Linux drivers,
of course)?  The fastest thing the card is going to show is fast
scrolling xterms.  I see no reason to waste power and money on
graphics capabilities I don't need.

I purchased the cheapest ATI chipset card I could find at the time that 
had DVI, works fine under linux.  It doesn't take up two slots, have a 
12K rpm fan on it, or a dedicated power connector so I don't think its a 
high power card but I don't know how low power it actually is.

Between 'man radeon' and Wikipedia's "Radeon R200" entry, you ought to
be able to pick a suitable older ATi-based card. The latest that is
fully supported by the X.Org drivers (meaning 3-D and all that good
stuff) is the 9200-something, IIRC. Newer cards are useable with
binary ATi-supplied drivers (if you can sleep with yourself after
stooping so low). Most cards in the Radeon 9xxx range can be purchased
brand new for $20-40.

R300-based (and R4XX?) cards now have a modicum of free software
support also, via the new r300 drivers in Xorg 7.1. My Radeon 9500
works great in Fedora Core 6, including teh Compiz/AIGLX bling. OK,
there's the slow scrolling in web browsers, but look at my desktop
spin! ;-)

Can't say it qualifies as a low power card, however.

After much fretting and research, I finally cut the Gordian Knot by
going to the Free Geek store.  Rick poked around and found 3 DVI
cards, and I bought all three for $10 each.  One worked easily.

Currently installed in the system was a Matrox G400 dual head card,
2 VGA, of which I was using only one.  Rick sold me these three
cards:

1) A Matrox G400 dual head with a DVI riser board.  It booted the
text startup of Fedora 1, but it would not go into graphics mode.
redhat-config-xfree86 (I am using legacy Fedora Core 1) failed to
talk to it, and I gave up after futzing around with the Xconfig
for a while.  Rather than waste time, I instead decided to try:

2) A Matrox G550.  This configured into X, but would not properly
configure for 1400x1050 to match my screen;  instead it interpolated
to 1280x1024 (which looks awful).  Rather than waste time, I tried:

3) A Radeon 7000/VE RV100 card.  This configured properly, and now
I am looking at 1400x1050 LCD with DVI drive.  Looks wonderful.
Admittedly, the VGA was not too bad, but I plan to connect the VGA
off my new LCD to the VGA switch box and get rid of another monitor,
saving a few millisalmon per week of electrical energy.

So thanks for all the suggestions.  I have some spare DVI boards
now, perhaps I will eventually find a DVI KVM switch box and learn
how to make these other boards work with it, replacing all the
VGA boards on the current KVM. 

And the main shopping suggestion is that Free Geek has a mess of
inexpensive video boards.  Do your holiday shopping there!

Subject: [PLUG] Bad-mouthing ext3
Message-ID: <20061130200204.991489d1.johnxj@comcast.net>

Several times I have complained here about ext3. It turns out that I
may owe ext3 an apology. 

The other day I was at PSU and my computer would not boot. The Compaq
splash screen came up, then nothing. Of course, this happened when I
had a presentation due in four hours and the Impress file was on the
computer. And I have to run it from the computer through the AV stuff
in the classroom because if I try to run an OOo file from my H drive it
would not likely work. I doubt that the university has OOo available on
the computers in the classroom, let alone the IPA fonts I needed or the
sound clips I had links to in the Impress file.

The help desk in the basement of Smith could not help, but suggested
that the CAT people in the CompSci building could probably assist a
Linux user. On the way to the CompSci building it dawned on me that if
Grub was not coming up, this must be a symptom that the hard drive was
not found. You'd think the BIOS would have the common sense to explain
this to me instead of just hanging, but we're talking cheap HP hardware
here.

When I got to the CompSci building the first thing I asked for was a
small phillips head screwdriver so I could reseat the drive. Believe it
or not, in the entire place no one could come up with a small phillips
head screwdriver. 

Back to the basement of Smith, the help desk people ushered me into the
back room where students were busy putting electronic things together.
The jefe running the place asked a student to hand me a small phillips
head screwdriver, whereupon the student handed me a slot head
screwdriver. There ensued a discussion between the jefe and the student
about the difference between phillips head and slot head (I am not
making this up), at the conclusion of which I finally secured the loan
of a small phillips head screwdriver.

Two minutes later my computer was happily booting into Ubuntu.

The point is that the continual corruption I have been experiencing may
have nothing to do with ext3.

I'm a bit surprised, I would of expected AGP vs PCI-E to be more of a
problem than low-end not having DVI. Nearly any card with less than 4 in
the hundreds place of the designation will be a low-power card. The
card number is typically GLRR. Where G is the generation (X1 is current
for ATi, 8 is just out for nVIDIA); the Radeon X are where ATi moved to
PCI-E, for nVIDIA it was GeForce 6, though AGP versions of those are
available. L is level, 8 or 9 for high-end, 5-7 for mid, 0-3 for low-end;
RR is either 00, or 50 for a revised version of some sort.

nVIDIA 5200 or 6200s are the nVIDIA ones you would of been looking for.

So, Keith's search for a low-power video card included a comment about his 
screen resolution.  Reading those numbers made me my eyes get all big and 
maybe I sweated a little.  I want a widescreen resolution, too!

So, I looked and found that there are some VERY affordable widescreen LCD 
monitors that would be comparable to my current screen, but actually 
readable and maybe radiating less and certainly taking up less desk space.

There are all kinds of interesting little specifications for each one and 
I have a vague idea of what each of them would mean in terms of 
performance.  However, if a person has an opinion on a drop-dead minimum 
contrast ratio, I'd like to hear it.  I'm seeing that the difference in 
price really jumps between 800:1 and 1000:1.  Am I really going to be 
disappointed with the lesser contrast?

Is there another vital spec?  I'm assuming 6ms DVI is what I really want.

Subject: [PLUG] Freedos discrimination...
Message-ID: <1164844760.4038.68.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

What about dos makes it bad if you have a completely open source 
release of the once popular OS?

The ReactOS project in response to a question about Freedos's FAT32
support, "we won't use it because we already have our own support."
If the freedos FAT32 implementation and ReactOS's implementation aren't
compatible, how is that a good thing?  It is already frustrating to me
that Windows 98SE and Freedos 1.0 use incompatible FAT32
implementations.

If ReactOS becomes compatible with Microsoft's implementation of FAT
that has to be paid for but not Freedos's, how will that convince
anyone to replace Microsoft Windows with a free alternative? 

I for one want to see the ReactOS community get something out before
next year.  Their code audit still isn't done and they don't expect
to move their XP compatible offering into beta for quite some time.
Uhm, is it just me or is it getting a little late to achieve 
XP compatibility?  Vista will be pushing XP out for better or worse 
fairly soon.  Most likely worse.  Unless Microsoft finally flops a
Windows release, how is Vista going to do anything but hurt this open 
source Windows replacement effort?

<history_windows>

Let's look at the history of Windows briefly starting with 1995.

Between then and today, we have seen:

     Windows 95a
     Windows 95b
     Windows 95c

     Windows NT 4.0
     
     Windows 98
     Windows 98SE

     ??? Windows CE ???

     Windows ME

     Windows 2000

     Windows XP Home
     Windows XP Pro

     Windows 2003

     ??? Vista ( if it's out yet ) ???

At least 12 different releases of Windows where compatibility
was broken at least 3-4 times tracing from 95 to XP.  Windows NT 4.0,
2000, and 2003 are another path where compatibility has probably been
broken at least 3 more times.  This list is probably short and could be
expanded on the issue of compatibility by taking into account the side
effects of applying various service packs.  

Something to consider, activation became a requirement with the release
of Windows 2000 and Windows XP.  Activation adds a whole new source of
compatibility problems by exacerbating the OS obsolescence issue.  There
are companies that still use custom software written for Windows NT 4.0
that have no intention of porting it to 2000 or 2003.  If NT 4.0
required activation, they'd probably have to port their software today.
Porting can be expensive.  If a newer system doesn't offer anything you
want and what you have works, why port to it?  

As far as Windows CE, is it dead?  

Between 1995 and 2005 is a 10 year period.  This is the post dos era 
of Windows and I can't say that I am impressed.  As far as Vista, it
seems to be it's own beast.  It has a virgin network stack and
undoubtedly it breaks compatibility with both the NT and the 9x/XP line.
XP may be more properly classified as an ugly NT/9x hybrid release of
Windows than as part of the 9x line.  It seems that Millenium
was a 9x style system, but it wasn't compatible with 95 or 98 and it is
seemingly dead already.  I had Millenium on a Fred Meyer HP system for
about three days.  I took the system back because it blue screened and 
Redhat 6.2 couldn't support the integrated video card well.  I didn't
like that the system had a proprietary power supply either.

BTW:  Can I get the updates for anything that came before 
      Windows XP and Windows 2000/2003 on compact disc?
      Do any third parties put out Windows updates that 
      favor the Firefox/Thunderbird crowd?

      Is there a way to cheat XP/2xxx activation so I can reinstall
      from scratch long after Microsoft drops support?

      ReactOS is a legally safer alternative to cheating Windows 
      activation, but the project seems stalled and ReactOS definitely 
      isn't stable yet.  I've had ReactOS blue screen on me.

If this driver is stable, great.  It should support file 
permissions.  If XP wouldn't hardware fingerprint, I'd
say run XP under vmware and skip this.  Well, except for
the fact that you need a license after 30 days.  If most
Linux distributions could run Windows in a virtual 
environment free of charge indefinitely, Linux would become
significantly more popular.  Are Bochs and Qemu up to the 
task?

Out of curiosity, why do 8.3 dos format files pose a problem
for an ext2/3 filesystem?  I didn't quite follow the linked
site on what the problem is.  Something about how files are
stored.
