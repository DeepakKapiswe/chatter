Ditto on floppyfw.  I had a junked P166 machine with 2 NICs and a floppy 
drive (no hard drives, no CD) that ran floppyfw flawlessly for ~ 3 years. 
Eventually I needed a wireless router, so I retired it and have been 
using the firewall capabilities of the router instead.

I've been using ipcop. I know several others here do to, as I see 
familiar names in the ipcop mailing list.

However, it's getting harder and harder to resist the temptation of a 
cheap Cisco router. I just bought a 2514 off Ebay for $56, shipped. 
That's about all I need, and it's 1U in my rack.

And, if not, how I properly configure it.

It's the other way around, PHP will use MySQL, or Postgres, or whatever.

You use a RedHat varient?  `rpm -qa | grep php` will show you if
the package php-mysql package is installed, or the php4-mysql one. 

Debian varient?  `dpkg --list | grep php`

After that check /etc/php.ini for MySQL config options.

   Aha! I had /etc/apache/php.ini set for postgres, and just now uncommented
mysql.

or you could just use phpinfo() to take a look and see

<?php
phpinfo();
?>

put that in a web accessable file and take a look.

Chris,

   This tells me that I have only one php.ini file, and that php was built
with mysql support.

   I can invoke the mysql command line from within the installation directory,
so it's running.

   The problem is that SugarCRM will not recognize that mysql is installed and
that I've modified /etc/apache/php.ini to allow an application to use 10M of
memory rather than the default 8M. Until it recognizes those two things I
cannot continue the application's installation and configuration.

   In the meantime I'll go do something productive instead.

Thanks,

Rich

It should tell you all sorts of things, my phpinfo output is some 14 
screens tall.  Is your's truncated?

Rogan,

   Er, ... no, he sheepishly writes.

   Well, that took care of the memory amount, but SugarCRM is still not seeing
the mysql back end (and that's running).

Thanks for the clue stick, Rogan,

Brent,

   No, it's not truncated. But the only reference there to mysql is in the
build configuration.

   Have now.

Thanks for passing that on, Michael. Jeff also said that he would  
edit the video and put up that as well. He probably won't get back to  
it until next week sometime.

I spent the day at the Real Time Conference. I went to the Linux  
sessions. Monte Vista and TimeSys weren't there, so they couldn't  
tell us about their patches to the kernel for hard realtime, so the  
Blue Cat Linux folk (LynuxWorks SOUNDS like a Linux supporter,  
doesn't it?) were busy telling us that Linux is unsuitable for hard  
realtime. So what happened to the RT patch? Well, a lot of it got  
folded into the 2.6 kernel, they acknowledged, but Linux is only  
suitable for soft RT. I hung around for the talk on changes to the  
2.6 kernel that were specific to realtime, but the marketing guy get  
babbling and there was some poor benighted soul from IBM who kept  
trying to correct him (I know he meant well, but he was trying to get  
a *marketing* guy to get his facts straight and, well, he was a  
*marketing* guy so...). And whenever the FAE tried to get onto a  
track that might be even slightly interesting, the marketing guy  
brought it back on message. BUY OUR STUFF! Geez. What could have been  
an interesting talk...

Enough bitching and moaning.

What is the distiction between hard and soft RT?  Does, for instance,
soft RT have enough Real in the Time to work for telescope control?

   I assumed when I read this that "hard RT" is what they do and "soft RT" is
what everyone else does. That way they can claim a unique position in the
marketplace.

   In my opinion, unless there's an earthquake going on, telescope control is
at a much slower Real Time than shutting down a run-away nuclear reactor
core.

   As some sage wrote here not too long ago, "real time" is fast enough for
whatever data stream you need to capture or control. It's a subjective term
that's dependent on the context.

The difference is pretty much a matter of deterministic behavior and  
is also relative. If an interrupt (or some other event that I have  
defined) comes in, can I be absolutely certain that the system will  
respond within an acceptable time.

More years ago than I care to remember, I had a project that weighed  
rail cars and guessed what kind of cars they were as they slowly (<5  
mph) moved across a section of track that had strain gage. For that  
purpose, I needed to be absolutely certain that I logged the data  
within 1 second (or so - it's been 25 years or so). Technically, this  
was hard realtime since I would lose data if the interrupt latency &  
context switch took more than a second. Realistically, a soft RT  
system would work here, because just about anything other than an  
abacus can be guaranteed to respond within a second.

When looking at a realtime system, there is the best case, average,  
and worst case times for response times. The worst case is probably  
pathological - pretty rare. So if what happens in that worse case? If  
people die or airplanes fall out of the sky, that's a case for a hard  
realtime system. On the other hand, if the average response time is  
well within tolerance and the result of a worst case response time is  
just annoy (say, you change the channel on the remote and it doesn't  
happen), soft realtime is acceptable.

And then there's the whole issue of the priority inversion problem,  
but friends have just come over for dinner and I'm being told to get  
of the &*()@#$ computer and be social.

  Hope that answers your question. I can drone on ad nauseam, of course.

I'd agree.  IMO Linux is too complex and powerful to be hard RT.
Leave that to the PLCs and hand-programmed microcontrollers.

> soft RT have enough Real in the Time to work for telescope control?

As far as I know: 
Low-latency means most interrupts will mostly be serviced within about
X microseconds.  This is good for user experience.

Soft RT guarantees that interrupts will always be serviced within X
microseconds, which is important for many SW and HW applications.

Hard RT guarantees that a particular interrupt will always be serviced
in no more than X microseconds and no less than Y microseconds.  This
deterministic behavior is critical in systems where the controller's
latency is part of the system (or safety) design.

Slackware ships with MySQL 4.x ... you said you installed MySQL 5.x...
did you rebuild PHP to work with 5?  I'm not entirely sure the PHP MySQL

Rob,

   Since I've used only postgres the past eight years it did not occur to me
to look on the distribution disks for MySql. However, I did look on
linuxpackages.net for mysql and the only packages I found where bundled with
postfix or cyrus. No, I did not rebuild php.

   Tomorrow, if I have time, I'll uninstall mqsql-5 and install mysql-4.

Thanks,

Rich

If you used checkinstall for 5, it should be trivial to do that... a

Slightly off-topic...

Jeff's Ubuntu slides from today's presentation at the OSDL Desktop Architect 
meeting are now online at:

The GNOME slides are not there yet.

Dammit, I'm not at my Linux box and my wife is asleep across the room  
from it. I apologize in advance for any lapsed synapses in my memory  
after several tasty beers with friends.

So, with that caveat in mind, let me go from memory. It seems that  
Virtual PC only supports 16 bit color (the shame) and Ubuntu comes up  
in 24 bit mode - they've got this really smart installer that made  
one too many assumptions (it really is good, though) - and you've got  
to tell X to start in 16 bit mode or things go all whacko on the screen.

So fire up your box and don't start X. From your nice non-GUI trip  
back in memory lane, sudo vi /etc/X11/xorg.conf (did I get that  
right? It's the X config file, dammit), and change the color depth  
(sorry, I can't remember the arg, but it will be obvious) from 24 to  
16. Start X (or reboot or whatever) and everything should be fine. It  
is usable on my 800 MHz G3 iBook and almost (but not quite) snappy on  
the 2 GHz G5.

Hot rumor (actually just my conjecture about what's right over the  
horizon): Apple's new machines with the Intel processors will have  
that cool new hardware virtualization which will be fully supported  
under OS X 10.4.5. We will be able to run Linux and WinXP alongside  
OS X without any penalties. Without buying any other product. After  
all, Apple is a hardware company and they've got the most exquisitely  
beautiful user interface - virtualization built in will sell a BUNCH  
of hardware.

This is going to be GREAT for Linux. Right now, Gnome & KDE are  
rapidly evolving into really nice interfaces, but most people don't  
see them (or OS X, for that matter) because they only use one OS. And  
that's because there are still a lot of programs out there that only  
run on one of those platforms, so a machine that supports all three  
(or more) operating systems will give us the opportunity to try  
something new without abandoning the old.

Most of the rapid evolution in Gnome, KDE, and the F/OSS apps comes  
from us (as the users and as the actors and as the greek chorus). A  
lot of our designs come from remembering other work we've seen or  
other ideas we've encountered and then improving on it. Having an  
Intel PowerBook where I can use cool new tools to build cross- 
platform apps and then *rapidly* look at them under Gnome, KDE, OS X,  
and Win XP, means that my user interface designs (as crude as they  
may be) will probably evolve quickly into something less  
objectionable. I think it entirely possible that this development  
will lead to Gnome and KDE out-evolving even OS X and that the  
"masses" will realize that the whole M$ architecture sucks as badly  
as their business model.

But in the long run, the WinXP, OS X, and Linux arguments don't make  
any difference. Because people won't choose Linux because of our  
arguments. It will be because of the quality of our work and how  
intuitive we make our user interface(s) will push people in our  
direction over the long run. Eventually, the choice of operating  
system is irrelevant and people will end up choosing the best  
operating system based on what they think makes it best.

In that case, Linux and OS X will try to out-evolve each other and  
WinXP will fade just as GEM once did (it'll take longer to fade away,  
but it will happen if there are real alternatives). With a 6 month  
release cycle time for both Gnome and Ubuntu and with Apple on a 1  
year cycle, we are going to end up with some really cool stuff in the  
very near future.

I'm excited - we are about to see whether the Open Source development  
model really is more productive and rock-solid than even the most  
talented and motivated proprietary model.

And I haven't even started raving about Harmony & Mono, yet.

> Ron, you should check this site out...
> http://www.eratosthenese.com/braithwaites/index.html

Wow. My mind is blown. I'm gonna drop 'em a note and see if there are  
any actual Braithwaites associated with it. I'd better get the DVDs  
of the series.

I just read this over and was struck by how much beer I have drunk  
and how much i've spewed out through my keyboard. But it doesn't  
sound too bad at the moment, so I'll hit send. I may regret this in  
the morning.

Loquaciously yours,

I'm working on a Sunday Linux Clinic at FG.  I need to convince one of
their staffers to attend, though, since the building would normally be
closed.

I'm hoping to get it to overlap with the Sun/MIPS/etc group meetings.

Rob,

   No, I didn't use checkinstall because it came as a binary. It's all sitting
in /opt, except for a copy of the init script that I put in /etc/rc.d.
Uninstallation will take about 30 seconds. ... Done.

   When I needed to replace the keyboard on our ThinkPad 600E I searched
Google and found several places that sell replacement parts. I've no idea if
they have CPU fans, but that's easy enough to determine.

   Otherwise, a call to FreeGeek might turn up such a fan, and eBay's worth
checking for a unit that's being sold part-by-part.

   This morning I replaced MySQL-5.0 with -4.1.14. It's chugging along, but
SugarCRM still does not recognize that it's installed.

   I just checked their community forum, where I posted a message yesterday
afternoon, and there were 14 people who viewed the message, but zero
responses. There's still nothing about mysql in the php info.

   Guess I'll give it another day before folding it up. If anyone has ideas or
suggestions, please pass them on to me.

I wasn't there when you asked.  But I hadn't heard of VPC so off to
google I went.  If you seach for Ubuntu at
  http://vpc.visualwin.com/index.aspx
each release has some "Extra Notes", the probably contain the

So what does "not recognize" translate to in symptoms that you
encounter?  

While I'm asking:

Did Sugar want you to create a db instance before running?
Did Sugar ask you about IDs and passwords for accessing the db?
  and/or
What were the steps that Suger had you perform to get db access?

seeing as how you are changing mysql versions and such, reinstall php and 
restart apache. php is probably looking for the wrong version of the mysql 
libs.

   Sigh. I humbly ask your apologies for being so dense. Yes, a httpd restart
fixed the problem with the mysql-4.

   I have become so used to not rebooting or needing to stop and start things
on linux that it just doesn't occur to me to do this. Except with postfix ...
that's very visible to me.

Sincere thanks, Chris,

I haven't visited their site(s) recently, but a couple of years ago 
there was a lot of interesting "hard real-time" kernel work going on in 
Dresden. There's a microkernel (L4) and a Linux layer on top of the 
microkernel. Last time I looked they had 2.6, 2.4 and 2.2 kernels on top 
of the DROPS (Dresden Real-Time Operating System). Anyhow, the URL is

http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/drops/

Last posting there is from August 2004 -- maybe this died :(.

Subject: [PLUG] nerd mode for installing Ubuntu 5.10?
Message-ID: <20051202173952.6833.qmail@web52704.mail.yahoo.com>

I was thinking of installing Ubuntu 5.10 on my laptop (the live CD
worked OK, so I assume the drivers won't are all good).

I'll be using it for school and development, so I'll want a mix of
desktop and server aps (open office, eclipse, apache, databases, and a
dozen programming languages).  

Can anybody tell me whether it'll be easier to install in desktop mode
and add apache and databases or install in server mode and add desktop
aps (and maybe disable a few services)?

I'm also trying to decide if there's any reason to install both Fedora
and Ubuntu (the disk is 18Gig).

Any advice or pointers would also be appreciated.

Jon

I have a similar setup, but I don't recall how I did the install. 
I'll advocate doing a desktop-centric install initially, then adding
the packages you want over telling the installer you want a
server-centric install, and removing things.  Generally you're safer
adding services you want than removing those you don't need, in the
later case there are likely to be services running you aren't aware of
and don't need.

Either way, it would probably be wise to severly restrict the
connections allowed to your laptop.  Denying anything other than ssh
from hosts other than localhost may be a good place to start. 
/etc/host.deny or some firewall app should do nicely.

IMHO, there is no reason :) particularly with a disk that size.

What do people use for development under Ubuntu? Jon mentioned using a
variety of languages... Do you plan on using one or more IDEs for those
languages? I'm interested in more than a terminal window, a command line,
makefiles and vi. Is there a development environment under Ubuntu that
people like and use?

snif, snif, do I smell a permissions issue?

At some point you had to give Sugar an ID and password for accessing the MySQL
system.

If it didn't ask for the root access information, you would have needed to create
the account through MySQL.

Typically the instructions to do so follow the form:

(commands with prompts and feedback left out)

  mysqladmin -u root -p create DATABASENAME
  mysql -u root -p
  grant ALL on DATABASENAME.* to SugarID identified by 'secretive';

If all of that is totally unfamiliar in this context I suspect that the database
is not available because Sugar does not have any access rights to the database and
MySQL is refusing access.

Server mode install doesn't do X.  So I'd suggest desktop mode and then add what
you want for services.

Being able to work in both environments will help you understand the underlying
workings without getting dependent on implementation details.  The way the two
handle, for instance, network setup and initialization is quite different.

If you do go that route, plan out your disk partitioning carefully. You'll 
undoubtedly what a separate and shared /home partition.

If you go app install crazy the 18G may become a restrictive amount of space. My
10G drive notebook is requiring care to avoid running out of disk space.

I use Eclipse for Java, and emacs/make for everything else -- not any
different from my dev. environment on any other system/distro.

Does anyone know if there is a way to install Ubuntu into a currently
live Linux system?  I have an old laptop with no working CDROM and I
would love to replace that system with Ubuntu.  I know Gentoo
(http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/altinstall.xml, entitled "Installing
Gentoo from an existing Linux distribution") has such a thing.  Any

I don't run Ubuntu, but I'm not sure that matters as far as picking an
IDE...

I use Eclipse for everything... everything being php, MySQL, and a
little bit of c/c++, perl, or python.

Unfortunately, I think Java is going to be added to that list next term.

   I have a couple of Eclipse and Java books for sale at very reasonable
prices. Powell's had enough so they didn't want to buy them. If you're
interested, please contact me off the list for details.

Thanks,

A bunch of us are doing this at work.  We all started with the desktop
setup (with 5.04, actually, followed by an 'apt-get dist-upgrade',
since that was the version we had a CD for) then added servers as
needed.  So far it's been working fine.

I'm a long-time Debian user.  The only place I've seen Ubuntu fall
short of Debian is in the packages for cross-compiling PocketPC apps
-- not exactly a frequently traveled corner of the distributions. :-)

It might totally break your installation, but it might be possible to
modify your /etc/apt/sources.list with the Ubuntu ones and apt-get
dist-upgrade.  Totally untried.  Use at your own risk.

You can probably get the sources.list from the Live-CD.

Well, that would work if I was running a debian system, but I am not. 
Suse 6.3 is what is currently on this machine.

Subject: [PLUG] Module Locations
Message-ID: <43909E50.3010800@acm.org>

My apologies if this is a duplicate.  The first attempts got deferred 
because of a reverse DNS delegation issue for the SMTP server I _was_ using.


My question is where do you place custom/company/product modules used by 
both a web site and non-web based processes?

Off the top of my head I see:

    a directory tree starting at ServerRoot,
    in the normal perl search path/tree ( site_perl, vendor_perl ),
    or in a custom location ( /home/foo/lib, /home/bar/lib ).

The issue is that several websites that offer similar products are 
hosted on the same system and use very similar but different modules and 
we'd like to keep them separated.  ( Yeah, modifications to the originals. )


Suggestions, readings?


TIA,
Rod

Although I do not use Dreamweaver myself, because
hand-coding suffices for me, I've heard that the
absence of a Linux equivalent is the main reason why
many Linux users still require a dual-boot system. I
suppose Dreamweaver launches on vmware, but then you
still need a Windows licence (at least in theory) and
a somewhat spendy program. (Of course, Dreamweaver
itself, if legally obtained, isn't cheap.) Some
designers find that Bluefish meets their needs, but
progress on the Dreamweaver front is probably needed
to shrink Windows' installed base.

I have added the web tools to it and am using it as we speak to edit html, 
This is the first time I have done this, so I will get back to you 
Shortly with a review.

WOW, code assist for HTML!!

Until now, I didn't know that Eclipse could do this, but it even offer me
style options.

Check it out, it's pretty good.

Subject: [PLUG] Securing Initial Accounts in MySQL
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0512021246540.9119@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Page 125 of the mysql-4.1 manual (section 2.9.3: Securing Initial Accounts)
tells me to start the database interface, then use

mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR ''@'localhost' = PASSWORD('<password>');
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR ''@'<hostname>' = PASSWORD('<password>');

which is what I did.

   Then, running the SugarCRM setup wizard I get to the last page where all
the options and configuation choices have been entered and the application is
supposed to create the database, my user account, and start running. Well, it
can't even get up on its hands and knees and crawl, never mind run.

   What I see in the dialog box is this:

Step 6: Perform Setup   SugarCRM
Creating the config file...done

Installation is proceeding... the output will appear below once it is
complete. Please wait.
Creating the database sugarcrm on localhost...done
Creating the db username and password...Creating the db username and password
for localhost...done

Unable to select database: Access denied for user ''@'localhost' to database
'sugarcrm'

   Now, simple-minded as I am, when I set the mysql password, I thought I was
setting it for a server, not a user. Yet, the sugarcrm message tells me that
there's a user called ''@'localhost'.

   Is this a mysql error on my part? In the sugarCRM setup, I defined myself
as the authorized user, and the username 'mysql' as the db admin.

   With hope that this is the last hurdle to overcome, I ask for another clue.

No prob.  Install the desktop version and then use Synaptic or apt-get
to install whatever else you want.  It's all there.

Why would I ever want to do that?  PHP is *not* designed to write GUIs.

Web Tools was a mess to install when last I tried it....

I get "code assist for HTML" with the PHP plugin, and don't need style
options in my IDE... but you didn't answer the question, does it do WYSIWYG?

Isn't that what libraries are for?

I agree Java is a good language for many reasons, but that's not
really one that's unique to Java.

Thanks for the pointer, Ed. I sure hope the project doesn't die,  
since it looks pretty interesting. I'll pick at that scab a bit and

Rich,

L4Linux -- the Linux kernel on top of the L4 microkernel -- looked alive 
and well. They just posted Linux 2.6.14, so they're tracking the kernel 
as it comes from Linus and company. What I didn't see was any activity 
in the DROPS site itself.

IIRC all of this magic works best on Debian.

Ken,

   I will go look for that tutorial. I'm annoyed that the SugarCRM folks will
not support any back end other than MySQL. I've been using PostgreSQL for
years and currently have SQL-Ledger and WebCollab running on it. Do I really
want -- or need -- a second dbms? No.

   According to one of the sales droids I met at the OSCON exhibit, they've
heard the request many times to support postgres and other back ends, but
management just shrugs and ignores our requests.

   Does this attitude remind you of any other software vendor?

Rich

Rich,

This attitude describes many small time developers who have their hands
full supporting the software they have----Not knowing the size of the
company, and just guessing at the reasons for their attitude.

I work with great egos all the time.  Most of them are good people with
good intentions, but often their opinions get in my way.  I am sure glad
I don't have a great ego or any opinions.  87)

You can define different passwords (and privileges) for the same
username based on the host it logs in from, but you still need to have
a username.  '%' is the host wildcard.  What you probably want
(thought I don't know anything about sugarCRM) is something like user
sugarcrm and host localhost, i.e. 'sugarcrm'@'localhost', though if it
doesn't matter what system the web application is running on you could
simplify things with 'sugarcrm'@'%'.

You want to create a user for the *application* and grant it the
permissions the application needs.  You can then define yourself as an
admin.  Make sure you change the password for 'root' as well :-)

Hopefully that's a clue.  But MySQL is getting hazy in my gray matter...

Ken,

   I certainly don't have the breadth of experience that you do. I suspect
that the SugarCRM company is not "small" as is Dieter Simander of SQL-Ledger
or Patrick Volkerding of Slackware. The company had a large booth at the
OSCON exhibition with several sugar cubes in branded corporate uniform. I
assume they have some VC money behind them.

   Well, a great ego is not difficult to develop; there are a bunch of
self-help books out that you can read for guidance. Or, go to a city council,
county commission, or state legislative session and observe the clash of egos
on a grand scale. If you're lazy, just look for those who put academic
degrees or the initials of other certifications after their names and you'll
find excellent examples of great egos.

   I also suspect that you're overlooking some opionions stuck in the corners
of your pockets or left over from previous jobs. The really dangerous aspect
of having opinions is expressing them in the wrong forum or in front of
people who take umbrage that you actually have opinions -- and they're
different from theirs.

   Anyway, SugarCRM got past that sticking point (thanks to Kurt), and has now
been "Populating the database tables with demo data (this may take a little
while)..." for over 10 minutes. Sigh. It's actually fighting me; perhaps it
just doesn't want to run here.

Thanks,

Rich

 Do certain machines just not have a system bell?  I want to use the

   I removed all traces of SugarCRM-3.5.1a and MySQL-4.1.14 from my system ...
er, my computer system, that is. Then I reinstalled the mysql package and ran
'mysql_install_db --user=mysql' and the root password change, followed by
/etc/rc.d/rc.mysqld start. That spawned a whole slew of mysqld processes ...
and all was Good.

   Next, I downloaded and installed the sugarcrm zip file. Ran through the
configuration again, This time I left off loading the demo tables and the
setup went through like a load of Exlax. And all was Good, again. I even read
the note that told me I needed to log in as the admin the first time. So I
did that.

   As admin, I have nothing there and I really don't want to use the
application as admin. So, I logged out and tried logging in as a mere mortal
user. Not Good. Despite the setup being told my username and password, it
won't take it. However, it will take the admin username and that password.

   This is certainly a Windows-centric application. For example, if I want to
add me as an employee, one of the fields is "IM Type". I figured out that
stands for "Instant Messaging"; the choices are MSN, Yahoo!, and AOL. Feh!

   Anyway, thank you all for your patient help and good advice. I'll play with
this and see if it's really goining to be useful despite the feature glut for
a one-person shop.

Just a sanity check, you are aware that the permissions and userID and
password system for MySQL has nothing to do with the userID and password
you use to access the computer.  ??

   Yes. I'm writing about the ability to access the SugarCRM application as a
user (defined in /var/www/htdocs/sugarCRM-3.5.1a/config.php) rather than as
the application's admin.

If you're desperate enough to make this thing work, I believe both GAIM 
and Kopete can communicate with all of the above Instant Messengers. The 
one I'm not sure about is MSN; that may be a recent trick the open 
source IM packages have learned. And there are other open source IM 
routines -- GAIM and Kopete are the two biggies (Gnome and KDE, 
respectively).

Rich, I was asking in light of this statement:

  So, I logged out and tried logging in as a mere mortal user. Not
  Good. Despite the setup being told my username and password, it won't
  take it. However, it will take the admin username and that password.

Is YOUR[1] username and password configured in the MySQL security system?  
MySQL does not care what is stored in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow.
If you can log in as admin and not as the "mere mortal" it indicates
that "mere mortal" isn not defined in the MySQL system.

[1] Where YOUR equals "a mere mortal user".

Let's be careful here--there are three layers of authentication and it
is important not to get them confused:
  1. System authentication - "Regular" user accounts (in /etc/passwd)
  2. Database authentication - Who can connect to the database directly 
     (rows in mysql.Users)
  3. Application authentication - Accounts within the application
itself, stored in tables in the app's database

Rich: I assume you've logged into the application using whatever default
admin account it setup and created a user account for yourself.  If not,
this is the piece you're missing.  (You have to do the same thing with
SQL-Ledger, so it should be familiar, although it's probably been a
while and you might've forgotten.)

Ed,

   While I often talk to myself when I need to consult on an issue, or discuss
options, I've not found it necessary to use IM. Actually, I've never found a
need for IM in any situation. My comment was that only Microsoft-centric
options are available in that application; what I did not express was wonder
that such an option was even thought beneficial to the perceived users of
that application.

Mike,

   Allow me to try to clarify. The SugarCRM setup included me as a MySQL user,
but not as a SugarCRM user. To become annointed as the latter, I logged into
SCRM as 'admin' and added me as a user. That worked.

Wil,

   My confusion began when the SCRM setup asked for a username and password.
Turns out that was for the mysql back end, not the application. Silly me to
not realize that.

   Yes, I found the 'add user' button in the cluttered browser window and took
the requisite steps to add me as a user. I also dropped about 8 of the dozen
tabs as totally irrelevant to my needs.

   It will be test driven over the next couple of weeks; I'll see how many
miles I can put on it.

Thanks,

Rich

Just as you don't want or need a second dbms... the SugarCRM folks don't
want or need to *support* a second dbms.

SQL isn't as portable as some would lead you to believe.

Well, only one of those three (the big popular three, by the way) is
really associated with Microsoft.

I use all three (and a few others) here at home, in Linux, via gaim.
Gaim and Kopete both support those three protocols (and several others)
just fine.

I wouldn't call them Microsoft-centric.  They're protocols, that's all.
 AIM and YIM have official Linux clients, even (and have for years).

Rob,

   Then I offer my apologies if I offended you or anyone else. I don't do
instant messaging so to me they're all foreign applications.

No apology necessary.. no offense taken.  Looks like all there was was a

Message-ID: <20051204125708.GA20723@patch.com>

I'm in a locked up situation with a dist-upgrade to current Ubuntu
realease, two machines are displaying the same sypmtons, another 
upgraded cleanly.

The error is:

  Extracting templates from packages: 100%

How do I correct this situation?  Attempting to remove gconf2-common
also errors out.

You might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:

E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).

Overall any upgrade or removal attempt is snarled up in similar failures
after dependency checks.

Seth had it correct.  I had to do a --force-overwrite with two packages
followed by "apt-get -f install" (yes, with no packages listed) to flush
out some other lingering dependencies.

The update is now complete.

Note about his word of caution:  --force-overwrite could install
incompatible to the point of deadly versions of files.  I went ahead
with it because the files in question were Gnome related and I knew this
system would remain in console mode until after I completed a full and
successful upgrade.  I could work knowing that anything broken in Gnome
wouldn't bring down the system.

Has anyone else been having trouble with Comcast this morning? Several 
times, I've looked over at the cable modem and found it going through 
the sequence it uses to establish a connection. This seems to happen 
shortly after I've successfully received some e-mail, and am trying to 
send a reply.

The solution has been to power down the cable modem for 10 seconds or so 
and then power it back up.

Seems ok to me.  I did receive a new IP recently though.  I had my last 
one for about two years. :(

I always have problems with Comcast.  They are NOT "comcastic" in the
slightest.  ;-)  More like a necessary evil.

I suppose it depends on a few things, possibly your area.  I started 
with @home, which was bought by AT&T the Comcast.  I purchased my own 
Toshiba cable modem after a good amount of research rather than renting 
and the service has been excellent.

I suspect location is the problem. I sent Comcast tech support an e-mail 
from their web site. The response was fairly quick, but didn't resolve 
anything. The tech did try to be helpful, though:

The connection has been stable all afternoon (so far), so I thanked him 
for his efforts and said I'd give his recommendation a try if I 
experienced further problems. Of course, that would make it difficult 
for my wife to connect, and I'd be without such firewall as my Netgear 
RT314 provides, so I wouldn't run that test for very long. Besides, now 
that I think about it, there doesn't seem to be any problem with the 
RT314 -- that is, I don't think it can cause the cable modem to go 
through a connect sequence.

FWIW, my inlaws had a problem with their Comcast connection just
today.  One of the cable modem lights was out, I didn't see which one.
I suggested they power cycle.  They power cycled the cable modem (and
everything else except for one thing plugged into a different outlet)
and it didn't help.  Then they power cycled the other thing.  It
started working.  The other thing was a Linksys WRT54G acting as a
firewall.  The one light that was out was the PC-Link light.

I've been downloading through Comcast all day.  So somewhere between
you and the Phat Pipe (possibly even your computer or your power feed)
something is wonky.  From my firewall:

Assuming that you have a linux box talking to the cable modem, you might
look at ethereal or tcpdump output and see if somebody else is dragging
down the line, or attacking your box.  You might also put a cheap little
4 port ethernet hub between your computer and the cable modem, so you
can watch the blinky lights, or monitor the traffic with another computer.

Sounds more like a problem localized to his particular upstream rather
than a problem experience by everyone on the CMTS.  If these conditions
continue then by all means call in an get some attention on the issue.

I'm not a postfix hack, but shouldn't postfix be able to perform a reverse
DNS lookup in conjunction with a white-list to determine if the site is
legit?
Please share the answer when you determine what can be done.  I'm looking at
using postfix myself.

Subject: [PLUG] Scope for a Postfix server...

The default for postfix 2.x seems to be, "talk with any smtp server that 
can see me."  A postfix smtp site can accept data from smtp servers 
that can see it even if it can't reach them.  Oops, this can lead to
a clogged defer queue incredibly fast.

This problem could be solved by having the postfix site, site A,
use a map of the world that is limited so it can refuse to 
communicate with servers it can't reach. 
 
                        public  |  private
     /----------\               |
     | INTERNET |            /-----\          /---\
     |          | ---------- |  C  |----------| A |
     | /----\   |            \-----/          \---/
     | | B  |   |               |
     | \----/   |               |
     \----------/               |

Site A is hidden on a private network hosted by the gateway, Site C.

There is one host on the Internet that is supposed to be able to
reach site A over it.  Unfortunately, this host uses a dynamic ip.

I don't want ratholes jamming garbage into Site A.  Site A trys to 
bounce the garbage back and then defers it when it can't connect
to the ratholes.  I only want to service host B off of the net.  
Site A should not defer anything to/from the Internet that is
not to/from Site B.

Since Site A firewalls outbound smtp requests to it's local subnet 
and site B, one thought is to have a parallel change occur at site 
C.  Have site C do destination nat for site B only.  Can't do it, 
easytcp on site C and easytcp on site A are incompatible.  For
now, site C does destination nat for site B's subnet, 65k hosts.

Even if the firewalls at Site C and Site A change in parallel,
what's to stop jamming of the defer queue at site A if a local 
user attempts to email a site that site A can resolve, but not 
connect to?  

Can postfix know that a site it's trying to reach is blocked 
for a reason and not just down?  Do I solve the worldview problem
at site A by doing parallel packet filter changes at site A and
site C?  Do I need to configure site A in a special way?

Masquerading and destination nat can get you into another ip 
network, but information is lost at the destination concerning 
the true source of your packets.

You mean it must fulfill either requirement or one of the two
requirements?

Be forewarned that enough mail servers are not resolvable through
reverse lookup to make it a frustrating requirement for OKing mail.

Comcast gave you a buggy RCA or Motorola modem again, huh?  So far the only
cable modem that doesn't crash after a couple months of uptime is made by
3Com, but I haven't seen a 3Com cable modem since Comcast and AT&T gutted

Richard,

I had problems like that when I first moved into this apartment.  Drove
me nuts.  Comcast sent a tech over and found numerous wiring problems
between their cable and my computer. All fixed at no charge and no
problems since then.

what I meant was that postfix would get the system/domain name via a reverse
DNS lookup and then look up that name in a white-list to see if it should be
allowed through.  That way you are dealing with a persistent name instead of
a changing address.  This would seem to be a viable solution since there are
very few servers you wish to accept mail from out on the internet.

I did plenty of research when I purchased my Toshiba and they were 
solid.  My model is older now (PCX 2000) and I have not had to restart 
it once in the years I've had it.  Sure, some brands or models may have 
a reputation of being problematic.  But surely more than one brand out 
there isn't.

So your white list contains "comcast.com", and I set up my reverse
DNS to say "comcast.com"?  Are you going to whitelist me?

Whitelists like that are trivial to spoof.

In regards to comcast issues ....

I have had comcast for over 8 years now, and several times have had issues just you explain.

Chances are they need to replace a filter (more people or services were added to the node) or something has gone wrong on their node (like some one crashing into a junction box).  Call comcast .... takes for ever for them to show .... but when cable modems run correctly they should never have to be rebooted or loose connection.  I get a steady 6000 Kbs in my house :o).

Subject: [PLUG] Arrrrrrggg! Problems with php5 and freetype
Message-ID: <2539.67.42.83.21.1133934574.squirrel@botteronet.net>

I'm having absolutely no luck getting php5 installed and working
with GD and FreeType on my RHEL3 machine. php4 is installed and
functioning well in every way with these. I'm convinced that it's a
FreeType issue, because both phpinfo() and gd_info() for the php5 tell me
that all that is missing is the FreeType support.

These are the FreeType packages installed:

freetype-2.1.4-4.0
freetype-utils-2.1.4-4.0
freetype-devel-2.1.4-4.0

These are the GD packages installed:

gd-1.8.4-12.3.1
gd-devel-1.8.4-12.3.1

These are the php5 ./configure options I've used:

./configure --libdir=/usr/lib --prefix=/usr --with-gettext
--enable-mbstring=all --with-zlib --with-gd --with-mysql --with-ldap
--disable-cgi --with-freetype-dir=/usr --with-png-dir=/usr
--with-jpeg-dir=/usr --enable-gd-native-ttf --enable-gd-imgstrttf
--with-ttf --with-openssl --with-png --with-apxs2filter=/usr/sbin/apxs

Alas, I'm not a Linux engineer, and in fact don't really know all that
much about it, but I can usually beat out a decent solution for my needs.
Does anyone see why with these things and this ./configure, that I can't
seem to get FreeType support going with php5?

Any idea where I should look for a problem, what problems might possibly
effect my system in this way? I'm about to give up on it...

Thanks...

Subject: [PLUG] Lyx hijacked "Open with"
Message-ID: <43968AE3.4394.A14B9003@localhost>

Ubuntu-64 Breezy on Compaq laptop with Gnome

Some time ago I installed Lyx intending to see if it might be better 
than waiting for Scribus to mature. Now every single file, from .txt 
to .htm and even .pdf pops up in Lyx. Lyx then announces that it is 
not a Lyx file. 

Thbis is so annoying. I don't want to uninstall Lyx because I still 
want to work on learning how to use it. I've looked everywhere but I 
can't find any place to change file associations.

A related problem is how to select a file in Konqueror without 
launching it. For some reason it is set to launch with a single click. 
I can't find any place to change that to a single click for Select and 
a double click for Launch. And for some reason, a right click in 
most programs seems to be the same as a left click, instead of 
bringing up a context menu, so that doesn't solve the problem 
either. Having banned the evil Nautilus from my computer, I use 
Konqueror for file management and this is making life difficult.

Anyone have any suggestions?

Bad package!  Bad!  Somewhere in Settings->Configure Konqueror->File 
Associations, there is a mess of things registered to LyX.  The 
simplest thing would be to click through there and clean them out.  The 
better thing would be to figure out where in the ubuntu package the 
file associations were defined and send a patch to the maintainer.

(hold ctrl to just select if you're in single-click mode)

Hmm.  When you first start kde, it asks you about 5 questions.  One of 
these is about "style" and enables this plus about 20 other things.  I 
never had to change it though.   Took some digging to find this.

Control Center -> Peripherals -> Mouse -> "General" tab  ("Icons" 
section)

That's intuitive!

Find the gd.so file (assuming you built it as a plugin, use the php
apache plugin file otherwise, probably libphp5.so) and run ldd on it:

  $ ldd /usr/lib/php4/20050606/gd.so

You'll see a line that starts 'libfreetype.so.6 =>'. What it points at
will tell you whether it's finding the freetype library.

If not, that's an important clue. If it is finding the library or if it
doesn't have a reference to it, then you'll have to deal with those
(check your /etc/ld.so.conf to be sure it includes the path to the
freetype library or check the php5 fora to see how others have gotten
around the likely 'configure' bug).

Why are you using an old version of the GD library? Just curious.

Another thing that works is to hold the mouse button a little longer 
than normal.

No,no. No gd.so anywhere.

Check /etc/mailcap and ~/.mailcap for rogue lyx references. The 
mailcap(4) man page will assist with questions about the files' 
format.

As far as spoofing, how do you avoid getting bad dns information?  

By scope, I want to tell postfix explicitly what subnets it can 
deal with externally.  I want to change postfix's default, 
"what I can look up I can see," behavior.  Just because you can 
look up the foo.com smtp server, that doesn't make it valid to 
work with the foo.com site.  Ip filtering rules make smtp 
transactions with foo.com impossible outbound from my mail 
site.  If foo.com connects to my site and my site wants to 
bounce the message foo.com sent to it, there's a major jamming 
problem.  How do I synchronize iptables rules that block smtp
access to all but one external subnet with my postfix 
configuation?  Postfix needs to determine that a server 
connecting to it is from an acceptable subnet.  It needs to 
look up the site name and if the net it gets is not on a 
reachable list, the connection should be terminated immediately.  
I want my mail site to refuse data from other mail sites that 
it cannot connect to because of the local ip filtering rules.
My only other thought is that I need to make changes on the
firewall that my mail site is behind.

Why not just block smtp connects from the disallowed subnets in iptables?
That way the disallowed subnets will never be able to contact your smtp
server.

As far as spoofing, how do you avoid getting bad dns information?  

By scope, I want to tell postfix explicitly what subnets it can 
deal with externally.  I want to change postfix's default, 
"what I can look up I can see," behavior.  Just because you can 
look up the foo.com smtp server, that doesn't make it valid to 
work with the foo.com site.  Ip filtering rules make smtp 
transactions with foo.com impossible outbound from my mail 
site.  If foo.com connects to my site and my site wants to 
bounce the message foo.com sent to it, there's a major jamming 
problem.  How do I synchronize iptables rules that block smtp
access to all but one external subnet with my postfix 
configuation?  Postfix needs to determine that a server 
connecting to it is from an acceptable subnet.  It needs to 
look up the site name and if the net it gets is not on a 
reachable list, the connection should be terminated immediately.  
I want my mail site to refuse data from other mail sites that 
it cannot connect to because of the local ip filtering rules.
My only other thought is that I need to make changes on the
firewall that my mail site is behind.

Thanks. It didn't occur to me that it would be in Konqueror. I found 
the window where I can change the settings. Took me forever to go 
through it because it listed every file type in the known universe. It 
seems Lyx hijacked everything having anything remotely to do with 
text files. Even script files, etc. Unfortunately, when I tried to 
remove Lyx most of the time Konqueror popped up a window 
saying that the service could not be removed. However, I was able 
to demote it and put another app on top so Lyx will now try to open 
the file only if the top application(s) are not available.

Paul suggested where to look for rogue Lyx references and I'll do 
that later. There may be some others in there too, because I can't 
remove certain other services -- noatun, for example.

Better solution, except I use only Gnome. However, there is an 
equivalent "Configuration Editor" utility. Under "mouse" the "single-
click" box was checked. I unchecked it, but it didn't make any 
difference. Afer unchecking the box I clicked on Apply, but it still 
tries to open or launch the file with a single click. Then I logged out 
and back in, but still no joy. Finally, I shut down the computer and 
restarted it, but a single-click still tries to open or launch the file. 
And checking in the Configuration Editor, the box is still unchecked.

Must be something else that is controlling it. Logically, it must be 
Konqueror overriding the system settings. But I can't find any 
settings for this in Konqueror.

Wait ... I tried something else. I went back to the configuration 
panel for the mouse and right-clicked on the entry for single-click. 
That brought up a context menu where I could edit the key, unseat 
the key, make it the default, or make it mandatory. Choosing Edit 
popped up a small window, but it was grayed out. Oh well. Didn't 
know what to edit there anyway. Left Unseat alone, as I have no 
idea what unseating does. I chose Mandatory and this popped up a 
warning that I was changing something that the Administrator did 
not give me permission to do. But it also said it might not take 
effect until the application was relaunched. I tried shutting down 
and restarting again, but it did not take effect. I think I have to do 
this as root. But that means I have to launch the configuration 
editor as root or with sudo. I don't know what the executable file for 
the Configuration Editor is. There is probably also a config file 
somewhere that I can edit manually from the command line, if I 
knew what and where it was.

Oddly, single-click has always just selected a file when I am in 
other applications, e.g., OpenOffice.org. It's only in Konqueror 
where it tries to open or launch the file.

Thanks for the help so far. Until I get to the bottom of this at least I 
can hold down Ctrl.

And finally Keith responds:

I got distracted, and did not make a serious search for a card until
this week.  I am now looking at the display driven by a Compusa Radeon
9250 card - nice and sharp! - using the standard Radeon driver that
came with SUSE 10 .  The card is $60 and 128M, though since all it
will be displaying is 2D graphics that is probably major overkill.

It displays an alternating black/white pixel stipple very nicely.
The old VGA interface made streaks - and more importantly, "m"
characters in xterms, thin vertical lines, etc. used to look bad.

BTW, I hacked the new card in the old fashioned way, by turning off the 
built-in video in the BIOS, then editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf with the
new information for this RV280 device.  There was some worry that
the driver would go looking for an AGP bus card rather than the PCI
card (the SUSE hardware compatability guide only lists the AGP version
of this chipset), but it found it!

So the remaining question - what is the modern way to switch video
cards with SUSE?  Text editing xorg.conf is so nerdish ...

That will never get you there.  You _have_ to use the kde control 
center.  Try running "kcontrol" from a console.

Unfortunately, Gnome and KDE have different ways of handling 
configurations and the twain shall never (or just not yet) meet.

General caution with SAX:

It has a tendency to always add a PCI_ID mapping for the card to the
xorg.conf.  Can be a problem when duplicating a config across a
machine, but in your case it might be good to remember in case you
want to re-order you cards on the PCI bus some day.

Greetings...

One of the people that I am working with wants me to E-Mail him lots of 
pictures! Unfortunately I don't want to take the time and man-handle all 
111 of them. Anybody think of any snazzy way of scripting this out?

All of them have the same recipient, the same subject line with the file 
name attached to the end, and all of them have the same body line.

Any ideas?

How large is it? If it's not bigger than you and his size limits you might
be able to archive them... or at least put a few into one archive. There is
zip for Linux which would be great if he's on Windows.

PHP has a PEAR library that handles mail attachments, and I though I don't
work with Perl, I feel 100% confident that it too does.

But can you Imagen getting 111 emails with attachments? Can you put them
all in a directory so he can access them? Burn them to a CD and mail them?
Zip them up and let him download them?

But basic zip is built into Windows XP+... much simpler and free-er, and
seen most everywhere. I don't believe it handles tar, but if it does than by
all means he should go with that.

I would think with uuencode, for and mail you could generate 111 emails,
that he'd be so happy to receive......

Nobody seems to have suggested using Dropload.
http://www.dropload.com/
The photos could be tar'ed or zip'ed an just uploaded for pickup.
This is a much more sane solution then sending an attachment which will have
an expansion for transmission factor of roughly 2-1.

PHP has a PEAR library that handles mail attachments, and I though I don't
work with Perl, I feel 100% confident that it too does.

But can you Imagen getting 111 emails with attachments? Can you put them all
in a directory so he can access them? Burn them to a CD and mail them?
Zip them up and let him download them?

   -----------------    -----------     ---------------------
   |Internet client|----| gateway |-----| private mail site |
   -----------------    -----------     ---------------------

Here's what I've done to address the security problem:

Couldn't use easytcp because the version on Redhat 7.3 gateway 
doesn't work with the version on my Fedora Core 1 private mail 
site.

Since I was using samba anyways between the two systems, I chose
to post the valid external ip address using it.

The rules for destination nat that I start up with on my gateway 
point to a dummy ip address, effectively nowhere.

When my private mail site gets a valid external ip address, it 
posts it via samba to the gateway.  The gateway then replaces
the appropriate rules in the prerouting nat table via a bash
script which cron runs every 2 minutes in case an update is
needed.  When the private mail server's firewall changes, the
gateway's firewall changes shortly after.  A daemon would be
nicer, but I don't know how to write daemons.

At first, I didn't think of the fact that masquerading was hiding
the actual source of smtp clients coming into my private mail
server from outside subnets.  This is why the destination nat
rules on the gateway have to be specific.  I had to realize that
whatever gets natted is essentially local traffic at that point.
Is there an alternative to masquerading?  Well, generally the
source is suppose to match the ip net you're on as far as I
know.

This solution seems reasonable.  I'm curious about IPsec or 
secure tunnels as potentially better approaches to this
problem though.  

What I still want to know is if postfix can be programmed
with it's own name resolution scheme that's seperate from what
Linux's /etc/resolv.conf, etc., specifies?  For a mail site 
that should only work with a small list of known hosts plus 
one external host, a hosts file approach seems adequate.  All 
I need to do is cleanly update that special hosts file.

For those who wonder, why Redhat 7.3 on your gateway?  I'm 
using an SMC card in a PLX adapter with hostap.  I don't 
know how to set up an AP using anything newer than Valhalla 
with this equipment.  Also, I do ltsp and nfs root servers
where I am worried about being able to implement all of that
with a more recent Linux distro.

I find with servers that it's easy to move slowly.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0512081053300.24455@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Has anyone here run Python code within Emacs? If so, can it be debugged
from within the editor?

   I've entered 'pdb.set_trace()' at a couple of points in my code, but the
GUI becomes non-functional as soon as I move to the command line to step the
debugger to the next line.

   The modules I'm trying to debug are the GUI; this takes me into a new area
where I'm stumbling around. Unfortunately, suggestions from the wxPython mail
list have not been helpful or productive.

He could use the MIME::Lite perl mod. Pretty simple:

Easy enough with mutt and bash:
  for file in picture*.jpg ;
  do mutt -a $file -s "This is $file" fred at here.com ;
  done

Optionally, you could use imagemagick or something to do some
processing on the image first, such as increase the compression or
reduce the size.  Pulling EXIF info out and putting it in the email is
left as an exercise for the reader.

Subject: [PLUG] Format?
Message-ID: <43984E36.19334.A82E8C7A@localhost>

I bought one of those little shirt-pocket size USB hard disks to 
make backups of my laptop to. It holds 60 Gb, which is also the 
same size as the laptop hard disk. 

When I tried it (with Dump) it got 4 Gb written and then the terminal 
window gave me an error message that the file was too big. Of 
course, silly me. When I checked, the drive had been pre-formatted 
at the factory with Fat32. 

Since this will be used exclusively with the laptop, which has only 
Ubuntu on it, I decided I want to reformat with Ext3. But I don't 
know how to do that. Ubuntu has a dialog box under System > 
Administration > Disks that has a button for Format, but the button 
is grayed out for this drive. Strangely it is NOT grayed out for the 
laptop's drive. Like it won't let me format unused external media, 
but it WILL let me format the disk containing the whole operating 
system.

The drive is mounted as /media/DATASTOR. I tried man format, but 
got a message "No manual entry for format." I also tried System > 
Help, only to be reminded that Ubuntu's Help is broken. It always 
pops up a window that says "The application 'yelp' has quit 
unexpectedly." I've never been able to see the Help files.

So where do I find out how to format this new disk?

Find out what the device the drive reports as.  Probably /dev/sda, but 
make sure.  (Should be at the end of dmesg after you plug it in.)

Make sure the drive is not mounted.

Use "fdisk /dev/sda" (or whatever it is called) to change the partition 
type to ext2.  (Just delete the old partition and create a new one.  it 
will automatically be ext2.)

After you save the new partition table, run 'mkfs /dev/sda1' to 
create/format the new file system.

The drive should now mount at a Linux file system.

Yes, it is dev/sda. The laptop's hard disk is dev/hda

I don't know how to do that, but read on ...

I did that, and got a message:

"The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 7296
There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024
and could in certain setups cause problems with:
1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO)
2) booting and partitioning soiftware from other OSs
    (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)

Command (m for help):"

I typed m and it displayed the help, but I didn't understand what 
any of the options were talking about. None of the options was 
"proceed anyway."

As soon as I gt past fdisk. :)

Ouch!  Stop.  Make _sure_ the drive is not mounted.

umount /dev/sda1

Of course, your distro may have an automounter.  Anybody's guess as to 
how nice that plays with command-line partitioning/formatting tools.  
(Eek!)  Maybe what you really want is to find the graphical utility for 
this (assuming that it can disable the automounter.)  Do you know how 
to disable the automounter?

That means what it says and you'll see it just about any time you run 
fdisk.

Yeah, fdisk is not the best user-experience available.  I've always 
thought that cfdisk is a bit more discoverable, but if you don't know 
whether the disk is mounted, you're bound to have some problems.

OK, thanks to you and Alan. But I just got a notice that PDXLUG is 
having their meeting tonight at the Fireside. I usually go to those 
anyway. I'll just haul the stuff down there and surely someone can 
teach me how to do this.

And yeah, I suspect 64-bit Ubuntu Breezy has an automounter. I 
say that because when I plugged the thing in for the first time this 
morning it was immediately available and I didn't have to do 
anything to get Dump to write to it (except I had to su first).

WinZip can handle zip archives, tar archives and tar.gz (tgz) archives. 
It can't, as of a day or so ago, handle tar.bz2 archives.

CygWin, on the other hand, can deal with all of the above.

Apparently the size limitation for ext2 is 2GB.  :-/

You want the -B and -M options for `dump`. These will cause `dump` to
write a series of files, rather than trying to dump everything into one
giant file.

Sample usage might be:

dump -f root.dump-20051208. -B 1048576 -M -j /dev/hda1

Which would produce a series of 1GB bzip-compressed files named
"root.dump-20051208.001", "root.dump-20051208.002", etc. Thus bypassing
any filesystem size limitations.



As for placing an ext2/3 filesystem on a device, `mkfs`. And as has been
mentioned, MAKE SURE IT ISN'T MOUNTED. At best if you forget this, the
disk will end up with a messed up filesystem. At worst you'll end up with
a screwed up filesystem, and your system will reboot (or worse, *won't*
reboot) because you confused the kernel.

As to the step involved, `fdisk` is optional. You could simply do
`mkfs -t ext2 -T largefile /dev/sda1`. The mismatch from the partition
table may confuse some utilities, or other OSes that expect the type in
the partition table to be accurate though.

Even better, if you're only placing on giant filesystem on it, you could
simply do `mkfs -t ext2 -T largefile /dev/sda`. The -T largefile tells
it to create fewer i-nodes, saves some space by limiting the maximum
number of possible files. Given that you're planning to use this for
backups, for which 256MB is *small*, this is appropriate.

They'll show you the steps we're talking about. This is safer as you'll
have someone to make sure you don't mess this up (these tools can do
severe damage if used correctly).

I have created larger than 2gig files on ext2.  (DVD ISOs are larger.)
You have to be running a 2.6 kernel though.

What kernel are you running?

Subject: [PLUG] Just Say No to Microsoft by Tony Bove
Message-ID: <20051210190454.GA2360@gate.kl-ic.com>


I encountered a semi-nifty book, "Just Say No To Microsoft" by Tony
Bove, No Starch Press, $16.47 from Amazon .  I plan to buy half a dozen
copies for Christmas presents.  It isn't perfect, but it will help
the recipients and save me some time.

About half the verbiage in the book deals with why Microsoft is bad.
The first section of the book concentrates on the history of personal
computing, and is more diatribe than most of the people I am giving
this to will want.  However, the other sections are mostly about how
to access alternatives.  The book is friendly to Linux, but it is
mostly a love letter to the Macintosh, why that is the best alternative
for most people, and how you can maximize your open-source experience
on that platform.  It is not blindly pro-Mac;  where Apple strays 
towards the dark side, Bove is quick to point it out. 

There are a few factual errors - Bove has Linux Torvalds hailing from
Norway, for example - but these do not get in the way of the primary
function, reducing dependence on proprietary Microsoft monoculture.
Until a less polemic, more cookbook-oriented book comes around, this
will be pretty handy for teaching people how to minimize the damage
that their Microsoft addiction causes.

And that is how it helps me.  I don't know how many of you are 
frequently yanked out of your cozy Linux world to clean up the
Microsoft messes of others, but it happens a lot to me.  I am
considered the "computer fixit" guy by a lot of relatives.  I am
always resisting the urge to grab these people by the shoulders and
shake, while screaming "You idiot!  YOU MORON!  You brought this on
yourself by running this Windows CRAP!  I can't keep fixing your 
computer messes if you don't fix the reason your have them!  Change
to Linux!  Buy a Mac!  Stop screwing up your life and mine!!!!"

So now I can hand them a book and let it do the screaming for me.
While it is more diatribe than most readers will like, it is not as
much as their sloppy computing habits have earned them ... 

Keith

PS - one of the pleasures of the book for me was Bove's statement
that a large part of Apple's success is its connection to the music
community, partly due to early adopters like musician Herbie Hancock.
<brag>
I introduced Herbie to the Apple II, which I used as the controller
for an electronic switch for his analog synthesizer keyboards.  I
presented the reasons to use an Apple (and the alternative, a mini-
LSI11) during a break in the recording of "Monster" at United
Western Studios.  Producer David Rubison, sound engineer Fred Catero,
and a half dozen other musicians were listening in.  They liked the
pitch so much that they decided they wanted Apple II computers (fully
laden) too - I ended up with a lap full of American Express Gold
Cards.   Herbie's keyboard manager Bryan Bell and I trundled down
to the Santa Monica Computer Store (the only place you could buy
Apples in the LA area in 1980) and bought the place out.  "We'll
take 8 of those, 16 of those (do you have any bigger monitors?), we
want them NOW."  Bryan was very persuasive.  The store had the usual
(for the time) collection of teenage hackers pounding away on the
display units - some of them were unhappy when those units were
taken away on the spot, to be repackaged and sold to us.

Herbie got his Apple and his keyboard switch, though the analog
synthesizer technology was soon replaced by digital synthesizers and
MIDI.  However, he spent most of the next year glued to his Apple II
and his modem, BBS'ing with 14 year old hackers about computer
programming.  He loves math and science, and sometime I can tell
the story about our trip to Edwards to watch the first space shuttle
landing.  Maybe we can bring him in for an Advanced Topics talk.

Subject: [PLUG] HELP! Broken Ubuntu! Can't login!
Message-ID: <439AC5D3.11236.B1D1CA6E@localhost>

I was reading on Ubuntu Forums and found a thread about making 
backups. Someone suggested Kdar. I installed it via Synaptic on 
my Ubuntu-64 Breezy laptop. I launched it from terminal because it 
did not create a launch setting under the Applications menu. The 
Help files were not working, so I fumbled my way through starting a 
new archive. The archive was to be named 12_10_2005 on my 
external USB disk, which is formatted ext3.

It ran for about 50-60 seconds and then locked up Linux. Keyboard 
and mouse dead. Had to hit the power button. 

When I restarted I tried again, this time with no other applications 
running. It seemed to go much better. It progressed to about 150 
Mb, about 10 minutes running time, then suddenly it disappeared 
from the screen. I had left the terminal window open and the last 
line was that it had crashed.

I wanted to see if it had actually created part of the archive, so I 
launched Konqueror. This produced an error message that KDE 
could not run. (I use Gnome for desktop.) I tried a few things, but 
nothing would get Konqueror to launch. At that point I decided to 
shut down and restart. I did System > Shut down and it appeared 
to shut down normally.

It restarted normally and gave me the usual login screen. But when 
I entered my username and password it gave me an error message 
that my profile "is not installed on this computer." I tried several 
other options under "Session" but the only one that will log me in is 
"Failsafe Terminal."

Supposedly, this is a way for me to fix wat is wrong. Unfortunately, 
I have no clue as to what needs to be fixed or how to do it from a 
terminal. The terminal window is running in a corner of the screen, 
and it appears that X is running.

At this time my computer is essentially dead. The only thing I can 
think of to do is to wipe the hard disk and reinstall from scratch. 
Ugh. I do have a backup that I made with Dump a couple days ago. 
The backup file is intact on the external USB drive -- at least it 
should be still there, unless that Kdar POS buggered it up 
somehow. It is a backup from /, so it should be the whole shebang 
(9+ Gb file). I have no idea how to use it to restore the system, 
however.

I'm in deep doo-doo here. :(

   That's the Microsoft solution. You can apparently access the system in
single-user mode as root. That's all you need.

   Yeah, we've all done something like this a time or three.

   I'm completely unfamiliar with Ubuntu and Debian, but I assume you're using
GRUB as the bootloader. You can pass it the location of the boot partition
and you can edit /etc/password (for example, by assigning your username a new
password).

   The SysAdmin gurus on this list can give you the step-by-step instructions
on what to do. I'd go to my bookcase for Carla's book (or one of the other
references I keep handy) and check how to recover from a bad system crash.
It's not impossible, just time consuming.

i have a toshiba portege 7010ct.  i'm working with debian b/c having troubles
with cd-rom so i'm using a net-install through a wireless connection.  The
cd-rom is on a docking station that gives me irq errors when i try to run
laptop undocked after install (i would really love to use DSL on this, so any
help on installing would be great).  I can't get the usb floppy for DSL to work
on my external cd-rom and of course the toshiba bios doesn't support usb boot
even after a firmware upgrade.

Well, that's the details of this project.
Thanks for your help,
-Mike

   Linux Cookbook, It's published by O'Reilly, Tasty recipes, too. And, if you
prefer a good beverage to accompany your meal, Marcel Gagne's Linux System
Administration is an excellent vintage.

I read other replies and was about to reply, but then it dawned on 
me that I had 64-bit Breezy Install and Live CDs that I got from 
Mike at the PDXLUG meeting a couple days ago. I put the live CD 
in the drive and booted it.

It came up perfectly. Yay! It also sees the USB drive with the 
backup I made with Dump on 12/8/2005. So that is accessible. 
And the network is working, because Firefox can go out to the 
web, which means it is going through the ethernet to the router. No 
doubt I can get it to see the Windows 2000 computer as well, 
which means I should be able to copy that backup file off the USB 
drive to the Windows computer for safekeeping.

That is the good news. The bad news is that it sees the external 
USB drive, but does not see the filesystem for the installed OS. 
Nautilus displays a "filesystem" but it is the filesystem from the live 
CD, not the filesystem on the computer's hard disk.

I also have the Install CD. I wonder if it has a "repair" utility on it. 
Maybe that would be easier.

Just tried it. No repair utility. All I can do is reinstall over the old 
system. That means all my settings and stuff will probably be 
wiped out. 

I couldn't find a way to exit the setup utility on the install CD. I just 
turned the power off. That's where I sit.

Off to research doing Restore from that Dump file

I have that exact model of laptop, with the DVD docking station, and
Debian installed.  Does your docking station include the floppy drive?
 There's also an external non-usb floppy drive for that model of
laptop that I might be convinced to share :-)  I have not tried
running it undocked since installing, since I have no use for the
machine undocked.

HI

If you can run live..

Copy your .files from the home directory and /etc.

That should save configuration issues.


Cheers..

First, in the there have been problems with USB external drives and
Linux.  I found a chipset dependence, but did not have time to pursue
it.  At the time, with both late 2.4.XX kernels and early 2.6.X kernels,
the process would go for a while and then hang.  I do not know what the
status of the problem is now.  If it still is a problem, then some
careful attention and tracing would probably provide enough detail that
the USB driver folks could take it from there.  I suggest loaning the
drive to somebody else, and see if they see similar problems.  That's
why we're here, guy!

Second, from some of the other problems you have been having, it is 
possible that you have flaky main system hardware.  One of the things
the World Needs is a good hardware test suite.  With all the different
kinds of hardware out there, that would be an enormous task.  So
generally we are stuck with swapping the hardware around and seeing
what it works on.  

Question - did you buy any of the hardware pre"Fry"ed?

I can run Live, but Live cannot see the filesystem on the computer's 
hard disk. It can see the external USB drive, but not the computer's 
hard disk. It shows a filesystem, but it is the filesystem on the Live 
CD.

The good news is that Live sees the archive file made with Dump 
two days ago to the external USB drive.

Did you mount the filesystem?

The Live CD sees the external USB drive just fine. The archive file 
made with Dump two days ago is still there -- 9 Gb. And Dump had 
no problem writing to this USB drive. So I seriously doubt there is a 
hardware or driver problem with the new USB drive.

The computer is a Compaq R3240 purchased brand new last 
summer in the unopened box from HP. I did buy it on eBay, but the 
box was unopened and all the stuff inside was still in the sealed 
plastic wrappings. I don't think this is a hardware problem.

In fact, other than flaky software, I have had no problems at all with 
this computer. This problem was created by Kdar. No question 
about it. 

I think that the best solution right now is to use that Dump archive 
file to restore. Unfortunately, I have no idea how to do that. I 
googled and found some instructions for Dump/Restore, but they 
were written in Geekian. I understood one or two words per 
sentence, usually things like "the" and "an." :(

Failing that, I could just reinstall from the Ubuntu-64 Install disk. 
But that will wipe out everything, I think. Lots of work to put 
everything back. I tried the Install disk just now, but it doesn't seem 
to have a Repair option.

Ummm, no. But I didn't mount the external USB drive either, and it 
saw that fine. I just assumed that it could not see the computer's 
hard drive because a Live CD is not supposed to touch the 
computer's hard disk.

But I could try the Live CD again and give it a whirl. I know about 
"mount" and "umount," but there are things you have to put after 
the command, like *what* you want to mount. I don't know that 
syntax. 

Bear in mind that the Live CD does show a filesystem. It's the 
filesystem from the CD, not the filesystem on the computer.

Right, you can see the CD filesystem because it has to be mounted to
use the Live system.  It sees the USB filesystem because it is
configured to look for hot-swappable filesystems like USB thumbdrives.
 It doesn't automatically mount your hard drive filesystem, because
normally those are mounted "manually" by the /etc/fstab file.

mount syntax in it's simplest form is just "mount <device> <mount
point>".  So try this:

# fdisk -l /dev/hda  # This will list the partitions on your hard drive
# mkdir /tmp/my-hard-drive  # This will create a temporary mount point
# mount /dev/hda1 /tmp/my-hard-drive  # This will mount it

I expect you want /dev/hda1, but check the output of fdisk first.

And now it's time to watch Illinois cream the poor Ducks.  I love
Illinois basketball.

I was unclear.  The problem is low rep-rate and hard to reproduce - I
would see it about once per 10GB moved, sometimes after a few hundred
megabytes and sometimes after 50GB.  It seems to relate to
synchronization and error recovery.  You can find a writeup at
http://www.keithl.com/usb2bug.html , and mentions of it in the PLUG
archives and elsewhere.  If you have repeatedly filled and emptied your
external drive without error, then you can rule out hardware errors.

But without the actual bug detected or at least characterized, how can
you tell?  You may have no question about it, but the people you expect
to solve the problem for you do have questions.  Questions are how 
answers are found.   You have learned that you cannot make Kdar work
for you using the thought and skills you are willing to apply.  That
does not necessarily mean the code is broken, but it does mean it is
not suited for you.

As a person that designs hardware, let me assure you that none of it
is perfect.  "New in the plastic wrap" means somebody knows how to
put a unit in a bag and seal it in a box.  So do the clowns at Fry's,
and they sell "defective new in the box" stuff all the time.  Even
the best hardware from unimpeachable sources comes with failure
rates approaching a percent.  Sometimes every instance of a product
is defective, and the manufacturer sells the dreck anyway.

I suspect software is indeed the problem, but the process of fault
isolation requires slicing the problem into pieces, and the 
hardware/software slice is usually good for cutting a problem in
half.  However, intermittent software problems that behave like
you are describing typically have their roots in infrequent conditions
in hardware, which should be detected and bypassed and are not.
Since the problem is locking up your machine, it is likely something
down in the kernel or drivers or below - it is very unlikely that
any user space code, even code run by root, can cause a machine to
lock up without help from the kernel and the hardware.

And geekian - or books, or something else that requires an investment
of effort, is how you are going to find a solution.  Dump is not as
hard as most things in Linux, and it has been around long enough that
you can find instructions in 30 year old books.  I can dump my usr
partition with something like  "dump -0f dumpfile /usr" - that is 
about as easy as it gets.  File maintenance, and restores, require
quite a bit more effort, which is one reason why I do not like the
apparent simplicity of dump.

I no longer use dump, and maintain an open source disk-to-disk backup
program, dirvish.  However, dirvish is a lot more complicated and 
powerful than dump, so I would not suggest it in your case.  It does
mean I have seen a LOT of disk-related and USB-related errors from
dirvish users, which is why I believe that intermittent hardware 
failure, or kernel code that does not bypass those failures, is a
distinct possibility in your case.

A lot of the questions you ask are answered by some good books.  I 
suggest Carla's "Linux Cookbook", Peter Harrison's "Linux Quick Fix
Guide", and the "Linux Administration Handbook" by Nemeth.  These are
not self-licking ice cream cones, however;  the sweetness will require
some effort to get access to.

Linux for the desktop is still arriving.  It has not become effort-free
to use yet, though it is getting closer daily.  If you want something
closer to effort-free, you may want to consider a Mac.  Linux is (IMHO)
easier to use than Windows, in the sense that the sum of easy and hard
things necessary to safely operate a computer are easier as a whole for
Linux (try doing a bare-metal disk restore from backups in Windows XP). 
But for now Macs are easier still, and allow you to substitute money
for effort.  If you can't afford either money or effort, then you will
have many disappointments.

None of that worked, but someone on an Ubuntu forum got me 
going. the filesystem is on hda2 (hda1 is a swap partition). I now 
have the Live CD running and a Nautilus window open showing my 
home folder with all my files and stuff. So now for sure I have the 
filesystem mounted. Plus, I got the networking going to my 
Windows computer and I copied that 9.8 Gb dump archive to the 
Windows machine, *just in case*.

The next question is, how to fix what went wrong? Since I can't log 
in, it must have something to do with my user account. I know zero 
about creating user accounts. This computer has root and jjj, and 
that's it. I know the passwords for both, of course -- I live alone and 
no one else uses this computer besides me. 

I could su and then create a new account for myself, or reset jjj's 
password, except that I already tried that and the Live CD doesn't 
seem to allow becoming root. E.g., from a terminal I did 'su' and 
when it asked for the password I gave it my root password. It 
wouldn't take it. Of course it would not. The Live CD has no idea 
who I am or who root is on this computer. On the other hand, the 
commands the fellow on the Ubuntu forums gave me all started 
with sudo and they all worked, without even asking for a password. 
I don't understand that.

Anyway, I'm getting closer!

You could be shot for saying things like that around here. :)

Thanks for the help so far. I think now that I'll get things back 
again. Hope the game comes out the way you wanted it to. :)

To make sure its a problem with your account, you can create a new
account (via adduser/useradd) and see if you can log in to that
account.  If that works, then move every file in your home directory
that starts with a dot somewhere else and then try logging in.  If
that works then you know something went wrong with your dotfiles
(where personal account settings are stored) and you can decide
whether to try moving them back and fixing it or just start with a
reset set of settings.

Ubuntu has a different philosophy than tradition *nix does, choosing
to disable the root account and add NOPASSWD sudo privileges to the
first account created during installation.  Look here:

OK, tried that. Locked up the Live CD.

Since I didn't know anything about creating users accounts from 
the command line, I went to System > Administration > Users and 
Groups. That's when it locked up.

I restarted the Live CD and this time it let me create a user 
account. However, I think it just created it in the RAM occupied by 
the Live CD. It didn't create it on the hard disk.

I can get the hard disk mounted, but can't figure out how to create 
a user account on it instead of just on the Live CD instance.

Though imperfect, the man page for restore is quite useful. Comes down
to two steps:

First, prepare the restore target. `mkfs` as mentioned previously. For a
regular filesystem you might want to use -j, and get ext3's journaling
capability. Likely your disk is /dev/hda1.

Second, do the restore. Mount the filesystem (`mkdir /mnt/target; mount
-t ext2/3 /dev/hda1 /mnt/target` will do). Then go into that directory
and run restore, `restore -r -f <archive>`. If you used -M during dump
you'll use it here too. -j -z and -B will be figured by restore from the
archive. Do the level 0/full first, followed by incrementals in
increasing order (I doubt you've got incrementals, so don't worry about
this). Once this is done you'll have a complete image of what you had
before. At this point remove the file "restoresymtab", this is a leftover
from how restore works. You're done, you can unmount the filesystem, or
proceed to other things.

You'll need a third step though, restoration of the boot loader. Alas I
haven't done this for GRUB. I'm unsure whether Ubuntu's setup will allow
it, but it may be possible to reboot with the live CD in the drive. It
may find your restored filesystem, and boot your system the way it was;
in this case it might be as simple as running `grub` at a root shell.


Note for the elders. The Linux dump is a SysV-style, rather than the
ancient awful BSD-style dump. SysV-style restores via the normal API,
rather than directly accessing the target filesystem via block device.
This has advantages of not needing the target to be identical in every
way (notably size), in fact you can restore onto a completely different
type of filesystem.

Given that dump happens more often then restore, dump is the place where
simplicity is more important. OTOH, when you need restore you may will be
a frazzled, paniced admin and need things working quickly.

`cd /usr ; restore -f dumpfile` seems pretty simple to me. Older
BSD-style restore would be a large PITA, but thankfully that isn't what
we've got today (at least with Linux, FreeBSD users are SOL). I've had
to use it twice this year, and easily pulled backups (though replacement
hardware was a big deal).

What do you mean "file maintenance"?

You're seeing a multi-threaded application. Each thread is assigned 
its own process ID, but in actuality they share memory space.

Jason, can you try the machine undocked to see what happens.  I have the same
docking station (with floppy).  You still wouldn't be able to boot from the
external usb, right?  I would still be very interested in trying the DSL boot
floppy with the Toshiba external cd-rom, using my Toshibe external floppy
drive.  I am not married to DSL if anyone out there knows of a lightweight
window manager that has a good add/remove program interface, comes with icons,
can autodetect usb, and has a graphical wi-fi network interface.  I guess
that's alot for a window manager to handle, but KDE and GNOME are both too much
for my computer to handle.

Thanks,

Mike,

   Well, I don't know if Xfce does all that, but it's a fast and lightweight
desktop/window manager that runs on all the hardware I've ever had. They have
a ton of add-ons that I don't use so you may find what you want. Check it out
at <http://www.xfce.org/>.

I just booted the laptop undocked just fine, with no IRQ errors. 
Perhaps this is a problem with DSL?  Or perhaps it is a hardware
problem, which I definitely wouldn't rule out on a laptop that old.

Are you hot-undocking it?  That's probably bad if you are.  Make sure
you shut down first.

I'll second Rich's suggestion of xfce.  You should be able to use
synaptic (for debian-based) or yumex (for rpm-based) for package
management.  Good WI-FI management is still a lot to ask regardless of
distribution/window manager/wireless card.  You'd better get familiar
with the command-line tools.

Jason

As Paul mentioned, if they're all identical than most likely they're
either threads or forks which are all sharing the same memory.

SHARE may include files mmap()ed by multiple processes as well as SysV
shared memory, and the former can be written to disk rather than swap.
I'm unsure whether top will include memory sharing caused by threads and
forks in this number. Crucially though, this will appear in multiple
processes (worse some of those might have differing portions mapped, and
so even if the number differs for two processes they could be sharing).
This is why top gives you a separate number for shared memory.

RSS is the portion of the process's address space that is actively
mapped (been used "recently"), not something excluding SIZE. Therefore
you shouldn't be including this in your total.

SIZE can include a number of extras. Notably any "file" that has been
mmap()ed. Though mmap()ed files may take up memory, they will never take
swap space because they're tied to an actual file on disk (FreeBSD though
may cache these in swap though). Of greater note is that X will mmap()
the framebuffer, and that will be included in SIZE. I suspect nVIDIA's
driver may also give framebuffer access to programs if they can access
the appropriate device.

Still trying to get my Ubuntu working. 

When I did sudo fdisk -l /dev/hda2, I got heads, sectors, cylinders 
and "units = cylinders of 1008 *512 = 516096 bytes." And then on 
the next line it said:

Disk /dev/hda2 doesn't contain a valid partition table.

Another symptom: I tried to copy the Dump file from the external 
USB drive to the filesystem using the Live CD. It said it could not 
copy the file because there was not enough space on the disk. (It's 
a 60 Gb hard disk, formatted ext2, and only about 11 Gb are used.)

So evidently shutting down without logging off and going through 
the shutdown sequence gave me a corrupted disk. (If you recall, I 
had to use the power button because Linux was locked up, dead 
keyboard, dead mouse.)

So is there a way to rescue the partition table? Or should I keep 
reading and trying to understand the instructions on how to do a 
Restore with the Dump file?

Of course not!  /dev/hda2 is a partition.  Try fdisk on /dev/hda
instead, since it holds the partition table.

Oh. OK, never mind then.

Right now I have managed to get the filesystem mounted at 
save_my_ubuntu and I am copying the Dump file (9.8 Gb) to its 
home folder. Next I plan to try to use the Dump file to restore the 
home folder.

Unfortunately, the instructions for Restore that I have found are less 
than clear. For example, they talk about "target" as though I know 
what that means. Is that the folder where I give the command? Or 
the folder where the files are to be restored to? And what about 
subfolders? I haven't found the answers in the online documentation 
or the man page. And lots of other terms. The syntax for the 
Restore command is pretty intensive -- tons of choices. Assuming I 
can figure it out, I still don't know what folder I'm supposed to be in 
when I give the command. 

I don't need my computer to get even more screwed up. :(

How do I get it to stop trying?

Anyone can ip filter your packets so that you can't reach their 
smtp server even if they let you look it up.

I use masquerade_classes etc. to prevent problems with private
subdomains of my global address, but what about the random 
server on the Internet that's either down or blocking me?  It's 
also possible that I'm blocking access to a server out on the 
Net locally using iptables.

Is there any way to control the defer and deferred queues in
postfix?  I want to disable the defer feature or at least
limit it.

Has anyone configured postfix to use a hosts file instead of
a local dns cache?

"target" will 99% of the time refer to the destination filesystem.

You'll want to be in the target/destination directory when you run
restore. Once there you need the "-r" ("restore") option.

Simple command sequence would be:

cd <target> (or destination, take your prefered terminology)
restore -r -f <dumpfile>
rm restoresymtab

This assumes your target/destination has already been prepared (mkfs and
mounted). As you'll note from the sequence, you're in the
target/destination directory when you run `restore`, and therefore you
give a full path to the "-f" option.

memtest86+ gives you the (EEPROM-based) speed, and IIRC it displays
the clocked-at speed.

Also, you can use MTDtools to read the EEPROM data directly if you
were so inclined...

Jason,

   Interesting tool. However, it cannot determine the RAM speed on one host
and provides even less information on the other host.

   Darn!

First, regarding this thread, I finally did get my login back last 
night. Someone on IRC #linuxhelp figured out what was wrong and 
helped me fix it. This time I have the IRC log file, so I can go back 
in case something like this ever happens again. And FWIW, the 
solution was "chown jjj:jjj /home." Turns out I didn't need the 
backup after all. But more about that in a minute.

While fixing my login I was introduced to "adduser." That worked 
fine, and now I have an alternative to log into, in case something 
like this happens again. But when I log in as the new user I note 
that a lot of programs that I uninstalled are back. And a lot of 
programs I installed are not there. How can this be? I thought 
"uninstall" meant "hit the road, Jack, and doncha come back no 
mo,' no mo,' doncha come back no mo.'"

And along with that, is there a command like "cloneuser"? 
Considering that a new user is virgin, I'd like to clone myself. (Hey, 
not a bad idea in the real world, too!)

OK, so that means Linux has to be running, because Restore is a 
Linux program, right? So if (god forbid) my computer is stolen or 
destroyed, but I have a Dump file on the pocket drive sitting at 
home, I could restore from the dump file, but first I'd have to get a 
new computer and install Linux on it. Does the Dump file then 
replace whatever Linux is installed? Sounds like there would be 
bits and pieces of the new Linux installation left over -- doesn't 
sound like a good thing. But I have probably misunderstood the 
procedure.

But speaking of Dump and backups in general, I did some 
searching this morning on Ubuntu forums for recommended backup 
utiities. Dump was mentioned only once, and rather negatively. 
Most comments lauded Simple Backup Solution. It's designed for 
Gnome, and Ubuntu supported its development. I installed it and it 
seems pretty good. Good, that is, except that it doesn't work. My 
computer has about 10 Gb used. I told it to make a full backup 
from /. It made a 500 Mb tar file. I realize that is compressed, but 
10 Gb > 500 Mb doesn't sound credible. So I tried to make a 
second full backup and it produced nothing. It's really stripped 
down -- no announcements like "finished" or anything. You just 
have to guess. And no documentation with the program. Just five or 
six comments from users on a wiki page. It's just what I need 
though. It's just not usable yet.

In the meantime, I'm open to other suggestions.

I thought there was an option to adduser, but I'm not seeing it.

All backup solutions have the issue of how much do you need to recreate
before restoring (the "bootstrap" problem). In all cases you'll need to
(re)create the parition table (fdisk), and create new empty filesystems
(mkfs). Some restoration programs may help you with those though. Booting
off an emergency CD is generally sufficient, you don't need to go through
a full installation (unless your backups are on CDs and you don't have
multiple drives).

Once you've got empty filesystem(s) and access to the backup, both `tar`
and `restore` will recreate everything else from there. Settings, kernel,
everything. Often followed by a step to reload the bootloader. Of major
note, neither requires much recreated prior to restoration, they only
need disks operational and a text console; no sound nor graphics.

Yes that is typical nowadays due to the older BSD-style restore program
which really was nasty. Thankfully, the ext2 restore program is the newer
SysV-style which is quite nice. In general most of the criticisms of
dump fall into one of two categories: First, criticisms which only apply
to BSD-style dump. Second, criticisms which apply equally to all backup
programs.


Until a reviewer has actually tried some flavor of SysV-style restore
(both ext2's dump/restore and SunOS's ufsdump/ufsrestore are in this
category), I feel I can legitimately ignore the writer's criticisms. I'm
well aware BSD-style restore is *nasty*, SysV-style isn't.

The criticisms of looking directly at the filesystem when the kernel may
well be modifying it apply just as well to tar. This exact same issue
applies to all backup solutions, just the manifestation differs. For tar,
if a process is writing to a file during the time the backup is running,
you'll lose the file. In what way is dump inferior here? `rsync` suffers
the exact same downfalls.

OTOH dump/restore have the crucial advantage that you'll save every file,
every link, and do so efficiently. Crucially you'll catch files that get
renamed, saving *only* the link, not the entire file contents. In order
to get a similar effect, GNU tar has to keep a hash of visited i-nodes;
this works, but isn't as efficient as dump, and could be fooled by
filesystem characteristics. Additionally, dump will deal with sparse
files very efficiently, other programs have to read the entire file.


I've yet to see a credible reason to not use ext2's dump program. While
I see plenty of reasons to use it over other backup programs (at least
for backups to archives).

As to the easy backup program you were refering to...  Sounds like it is
using a graphical desktop during backup. This *really* scares me because
it might also need that for restoration (gee rebuild your X config in
just to restore from bare metal, ouch!).

<Changed subject since the login emergency is now history>

Thanks for a long story explaining some things to me in a manner 
that I actually understood (sort of). I did have to reinstall Windows 
2000 once when a hard disk went to hard disk heaven. Umm, wait 
... that disk prolly went to hard disk hell, since it was warranted for 
five years and lasted two. I understand what you said about how 
much you have to rebuild before you can restore. At the time I was 
using Backup Exec, written by the same people who wrote the 
basic Windows 2000 backup utility -- same thing but with more 
bells and whistles. Once I had a new hard disk I had to reinstall a 
basic Windows 2000 system, install Backup Exec, then do the 
restore. However, to its credit, it completely overwrote the basic 
system I had just installed and left me with the original system 
completely intact, even down to what service packs had been 
applied.

So I understand that having to set up the filesystems before doing 
a restore is trivial, really. And it hadn't occurred to me that I could 
do the restore with a live CD. (Nothing like that in WinWorld.) 
Except that, having just gone through an nerve-wracking problem 
with a broken user profile, I discovered that the live CDs are 
generally written to prevent any attempt to touch the filesystem. 
That's the whole point of the live CD -- "try it out, it won't touch your 
existing setup."

Unless I stumble across a better alternative, for the time being I am 
going to continue to use Dump. The Simple Backup Solution is just 
not ready for prime time, although I suppose I'll probably go to it 
eventually -- I like stuff that is graphical and easy. Still, Dump is 
easy for me to use also. I have the command line syntax to do it 
and it works. I can create a new backup as often as I want, and 
then delete the older ones as space on the USB disk gets 
cramped.

However, if I need to restore from a Dump file, you'll hear me in 
here screaming HELP! Oh well. It's for emergencies, right? 
Hopefully that will never happen. Or at least not until I graduate 
from n00b status. This stuff is always learned the hard way. :(

Ken,

   Software to make someone psychotic is not what I need. There was mention in
that article of software for those with ADD. With therapist training, the
patient can learn to keep his/her mind focused rather than jumping all over
the place.

   Other software has been developed to treat anxiety disorders and a number
of phobias. It's a very interesting idea with a very great need. That's why I
asked if anyone knew of anything that ran on linux. My assumption, totally
without specific knowledge, is that everything in the article is designed for
Microsoft.

One day (if MS or Mac doesn't beat them to it), your gnome desktop will 
load-up with a single OK button.  Just click it.  Then who's laughing?

   Tsch! Tsch! No mention of Xfce. :-( Ya' want functionality without excess

Message-ID: <20051213173957.28937.qmail@web50606.mail.yahoo.com>

A few months ago I installed Sarge, at that time a
testing release, and the wheel mouse function wouldn't
work, even when properly configured. Ultimately this
was such a nuisance that I decided on another
installation. I had a lot of trouble with Etch, so I
installed Sarge stable with the linux26 option.

I find that Realplayer doesn't work on the new
installation, even when installed exactly the same
way. I read the fine print and discovered that it
wasn't designed to work with ALSA, which is probably
what I now have. The slider moves across, but without
sound. (Totem doesn't play these files either,
although it is intended to.) Is there a version of
Realplayer that will work with ALSA?

Does anything play audio correctly on that machine? It sounds like
you've hit the everyone-does-it-once alsa "problem" of not unmuting
the master volume.  alsactrl will let you fix this, if that is indeed
the issue.

I should have clarified that: otherwise, the audio is
fine. I watched Jay Leno in full-screeen mode in "TV

Hi Gang,

I am getting ready to order DSL from Verizon.  Hooking up to the WinDoze 
machine should be no problem.  The Verizon web site doesn't say anything 
about Linux.

I am running a dual boot with SuSE 9.1 Pro and Kubuntu 5.1.

Does anybody have any suggestions as to how well this will work.  SuSE reads 
the network card as a Netgear FA310TX.  The same card should be in the 
WinDoze machine.  We will be ordering the router that is offered with the 
package.

Thanks!

Bruce

   Thanks, Eli. I know from the test on that machine that currently it's
running at 400MHz. I want to check the same modules in a new motherboard.

John,

Any way you can perform a restore on another system to be familiar with
Dumps mechanisms? I hate to think that you will wait for a crisis to
find out how it works. I cringed when you wrote: "Hopefully that will
never happen." 

Remember: Whatever CAN go wrong, WILL go wrong. 

It is inevitable that you will need to do a restore. Perhaps you can
take a dump file and redirect it to another piece of similar hardware? 

I only say this because I have been totally burned before by not
familiarizing myself with the restore process until the situation is
critical. 

BTW: That's a great point using a live CD for restore purposes. I will
try that out this week.

<Changed subject since the login emergency is now history>

Thanks for a long story explaining some things to me in a manner that I
actually understood (sort of). I did have to reinstall Windows 2000 once
when a hard disk went to hard disk heaven. Umm, wait ... that disk
prolly went to hard disk hell, since it was warranted for five years and
lasted two. I understand what you said about how much you have to
rebuild before you can restore. At the time I was using Backup Exec,
written by the same people who wrote the basic Windows 2000 backup
utility -- same thing but with more bells and whistles. Once I had a new
hard disk I had to reinstall a basic Windows 2000 system, install Backup
Exec, then do the restore. However, to its credit, it completely
overwrote the basic system I had just installed and left me with the
original system completely intact, even down to what service packs had
been applied.

So I understand that having to set up the filesystems before doing a
restore is trivial, really. And it hadn't occurred to me that I could do
the restore with a live CD. (Nothing like that in WinWorld.) Except
that, having just gone through an nerve-wracking problem with a broken
user profile, I discovered that the live CDs are generally written to
prevent any attempt to touch the filesystem. 
That's the whole point of the live CD -- "try it out, it won't touch
your existing setup."

Unless I stumble across a better alternative, for the time being I am
going to continue to use Dump. The Simple Backup Solution is just not
ready for prime time, although I suppose I'll probably go to it
eventually -- I like stuff that is graphical and easy. Still, Dump is
easy for me to use also. I have the command line syntax to do it and it
works. I can create a new backup as often as I want, and then delete the
older ones as space on the USB disk gets cramped.

However, if I need to restore from a Dump file, you'll hear me in here
screaming HELP! Oh well. It's for emergencies, right? 
Hopefully that will never happen. Or at least not until I graduate from
n00b status. This stuff is always learned the hard way. :(

   I had the same NICs in my previous boxes. No problems with them or the
built-in NICs on the replacement boxes.

   My DSL bridge is by Fujitsu. I understand that they now support a different
brand/model, but this is doing just fine for us. Well, the power brick went
out, but I bought a complete replacement on eBay so it's working again. Spare
Fujitsu sitting here, too.

You probably don't need (or want) whatever windows software they send 
you.  Too bad the CD's don't make better coasters (not absorbant enough 
and that hole in the middle leaks), but mine seems to do well enough 
for setting a coffee mug down temporarily.

If their router is at all decent, you can just login to 192.168.1.1 or 
whatever with you browser and the password in the book (change it to 
something else (and don't lose it!))  Configure all of the clicky 
things until they look right and make sure that it says it is connected 
when the phone line is plugged into it.

Then you just have to setup all of your boxen to get dhcp or at least be 
on the same subnet as the router (and if you're using static IP's, 
you'll need to enter the router's address by hand as the "default 
gateway".)  At that point, you should all be masqueraded onto the 
internets via the router's single public IP.

Yes I have.  And I used to work for them, well the Spokane office that 
is.  And we didn't play those silly dhcp games.  Each customer got one 
or more IPs.  Routed or bridged connections depending on the 
circumstances/needs.

I don't think Oregon is in their lata but I have a bcc of this message 
to the Technical Manager in case I'm out of date on that information.

I think you want alsactl, not alsactrl.

I do believe that it is a Slackware package, but I am not positive.

It should be in the utilities package. (in debian, it is in the
alsa-utils package -- a similar one should exist for slack).  I'll
second Chris's note that it's alsactl instead of alsactrl (contrary to
my earlier message.  I just checked).

SpireTech (spiretech.com). Hevanet (hevanet.com). EasyStreet 
(easystreet.com). There are probably others. Joey over at SpireTech

Unfortunately, no. I have just the Linux laptop and the Windows 
2000 desktop. I need them both. Wish I had something expendable 
to try it out on.

In the meantime I keep trying to work with Simple Backup Solution. 
Lotsa bugs still. But maybe it will get good enough soon enough

Been using Linux on Verizon for quite a few years, without a problem. I
don't use a router from them, I prefer my WRT54G, but my fiancee has the
Westell router that Verizon sends on her account, and Linux runs fine behind
it too (even wireless). The one complaint is that hers will freeze up if you
run Bittorrent (though not the Blizzard WoW updater... odd), but it's not
that big of an issue.

I have Verizon DSL and run RedHat Mandrake and Fedora [1|2] at various times.
I am behind a netgear router.  The only problem I had was getting the initial
connection with Verizon setup on time and then having them leave it alone.
In the 1.8 years of time, I have only had to reset the modem twice and once
was because I was troubleshooting my windows box.

All,

I'm setting up cheap multi-zone audio using 4 seperate linux boxes with sounds
cards around my house. I have a central server with my ogg vorbis files that
I'll share out to each of the audio boxes. My question is should I use samba or
nfs, and why one over the other?

thanks,

It may be simpler to stream the audio with something like icecast, and
have each client machine play from the stream rather than a file. 
This, of course isn't without tradeoffs -- you'll have synchronized
audio everwhere, but changing from one song to another is not as easy.

I used to have DSL through DSL-Only in Verizon land. If you order the 
line through DSL-Only, they handle all the Verizon stuff. You get to pay 
two bills this way, but the ISP will admit to knowing that Linux exists, 
and it works.

I'd still be with them, except when I bought my house, 4000 feet from 
the CO, Verizon installed my phone line on a digital loop. That makes it 
incompatible with DSL. They refused to re-engineer the line, even though 
that would mean I would pay them more. So I switched to Speakeasy's 
one-link service, which is DSL on a dry pair... No dial tone required. 
Then I got VoIP and told Verizon to turn off their phone line. I didn't 
need it anymore. So they completely lost a dialtone customer because 
they wouldn't give me what I wanted.

Anyway, if you can, and Verizon won't admit that Linux exists, I'd say 
get a different ISP. Keep in mind that the last time I did this, you had 
to order the service through the ISP, or Verizon would assume that you 
want them to be both the ISP and the line provider.

I'd probably go with nfs just because smb tends to be a bit more 
"chatty".  If you have any plans for Windoze systems in the future, then 
go with samba because all Win systems speak it.  You might also want to 
consider that one of the reasons that smb is more verbose is that it is 
"stateful" and nfs is not.  You can actually play this to your advantage 
sometimes - nfs will just keep trying to find what it is looking for 
(depending on the mount type) because it is too dumb to know that it's 
gone.  Nfs will come back when the system re-appears.  Smb knows that a 
client or server is gone and applications that are not written to 
re-start the network will have to be re-started.

The 'casting' point is a valid one, though probably more involved than
just an NFS config:

##server /etc/exports:
/EXPORT/audio      10.0.0.0/255.255.255.0(ro,no_root_squash,async)

##clients /etc/fstab:
server:/EXPORT/audio       /mnt/audio    nfs   
defaults,ro,tcp,nfsvers=3,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,actimeo=30 0 0

Now all you need to do is create said directories, populate the server
with data, and mount on the client (and define your IP range..). 
CIFS/samba is more involved, and I wouldn't recommend it for simply
transferring files across Linux boxen.

I use SpeakEasy as my ISP (out of Seattle) over Verizon (in Beaverton) and
my Customer Service Rep had heard of it and assured me it would work.  I
found it was cheaper than Verizon (at least when I got it last year) and I
got two static IP addresses, even though I'm only using one.

There are customer service reps who've heard of it.  Unfortunately my
dealing with Verizon no one heard of it and one who had said it wouldn't
work......

How about gmediaserver or mediatomb?  They are upnp media servers.  Then 
you can use djmount to setup a directory to play you files from.

I don't like the "look and feel" of Gnome and personally prefer KDE, but 
I think Linus is way off base condemning Gnome like that. *Large* parts 
of KDE have sketchy documentation, or none at all, and there is also the 
issue of the "dual licensing" of QT.

 From what I've seen, KDE is *significantly* more complex than Gnome, 
and that's not necessarily a good thing. As a matter of fact, XFCE4 is 
lighter than Gnome -- it's worth taking a look at IMHO.

Subject: [PLUG] CDParanoia/Lame issues/ Ping Paul Mullen
Message-ID: <439F247E.9482.C2E395AA@localhost>

Last summer I ripped a ton of my CDs to mp3s to put on my iPod. 
All went well until Nautilus deleted most of them (and no backups). 
Then I screwed up the iPod and had to reformat it. I put what mp3s 
I had left back on it, but now that it's winter break am trying to rip 
the lost CDs again. Paul Mullen gave me instructions for doing it 
from the command line and I saved them in an OO.o Writer file. But 
for some reason the instructions are not working. Since I did this 
last I have upgraded from Ubuntu Hoary-64 to Ubuntu Breezy-64, 
but I doubt that is the problem.

First, the instructions said to copy and paste some parameters 
into a text file and save it as abcde.conf in my home directory in 
order to specify to lame how to rip the final mp3s. I just looked and 
no such file is anywhere on my computer. I have no explanation for 
why the file is not there, because I remember creating the file. 
Anyway, I recreated the abcde.conf file from the instructions and it 
is now in /home/jjj.

The instructions for ripping a CD to cdda.wav ("cdparanoia 1-4", 
where 1-4 are the tracks I want to rip as one file) did not work at 
first. I kept getting "cannot open default output file cdda.wav: 
Permission denied." This, in spite of the fact that cdda.wav from 
last time I did this was still in /home/jjj. Surely I have permission for 
my home folder. Eventually I just sudo'ed it and the rip proceeded.

But at the end, it created cdda.wav in the root. Huh? I never 
specified where it was to put cdda.wav before and it always put it in 
my home folder, overwriting the previous cdda.wav file. Maybe it put 
it in the root folder because this time I sudo'ed it. But then that 
takes me back to why cdparanoia insists it doesn't have 
permission to create cdda.wav in my home folder. Before sudo'ing 
it I gave it the command as jjj at devil5/$. Surely the owner of the 
home folder can issue a command to write a file to it.

Or maybe I should have specified where cdparanoia was to create 
the wav file? But I never did that before and it always put it in 
/home/jjj/. In fact, I don't even know what syntax to use with 
cdparanoia to specify the output file and location.

Total confusion here. Luckily this is not an urgent matter, but I still 
want to re-rip these CDs before winter term starts. (And make 
backups this time!)

Easystreet, yes. BUT Why?
I never get this debate..

Your ISP won't care. Are there really people using Linux that will need 
their ISP's help in toubleshooting? If not, then there's no need to care 
what OS you're using, assuming it speaks Ethernet and IP.

The day of installing a PCI NIC for DSL in your Win2k box are long gone. 
You can use Windows 3.1, WARP, WOPR, Nintendo, Linux, whatever--as long 
as it can talk to your *gasp* Linksys */ickiness* router.

Unless a) your ISP provides a USB-only modem, or b) you're trying to
diagnose PPPoE problems, which Verizon DSL apparently uses everywhere
EXCEPT Portland.

I agree - I have used EasyStreet as my ISP and Verizon for my carrier 
for many years now and the only assistance I have needed from EasyStreet 
has been completely OS independent - like "Hey you guys, looks to me 
like your dns server is down, how about checking that out?"  They don't 
give a hoot about my OS. 

Incidentally, I am in the process of moving from Verizon/EasyStreet to 
just Verizon/Verizon since (a) they offer a static IP service for about 
the same $$ (only, for some reason I have to be a "commercial" account) 
and (b) FiOS is coming!  They are just finishing up with the digging of 
my street so 15Mb/2Mb is just around the corner.  Yee Haw!

Message-ID: <20051214071509.24669.qmail@web50606.mail.yahoo.com>

The only really frightening part of Debian
installation is configuring exim4, which may not even
need to be done. It seems like Japanese (or, if you
happen to be Japanese, it seems like English.) Anyhow,
I think I made the wrong choices--I would now like to
be able to send mail outside the network--say, to
Australia--with smtp. Is there an easy way to get back
into the configuration and change the options? Most
other 'NIXes seem to use sendmail--which I have
installed in FreeBSD.

I can send smtp mail, of course. But I'd like to use
fetchmail-MTA-mutt as an experiment.

Have you looked in

/etc/exim/conf

It turns out that, from the standpoint of using Pine,
the problem can be avoided by putting the SMTP server
on the appropriate line, rather than employing a
transport agent for outgoing mail. Some people believe
that Pine has security problems, but its enthusiasts
think it is secure enough. Are there any opinions
about this?

Message-ID: <20051214091200.90969.qmail@web50605.mail.yahoo.com>

A fairly up-to-date reference gives the following
instructions for installing JRE on Debian:

    * Grab:
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp
    * apt-get install java-package fakeroot
    * fakeroot make-jpkg jre-1_5_0_02-linux-i586.bin
    * dpkg -i sun-j2re1.5_1.5.0+update02_i386.deb
    * logout and login again and check java
    * java -version

I have done #1. But, at least for stable, I can't find
"java-package." Has it been superseded by
"java-common?" Or is this writer on the wrong track?

Ah!  But you do need a source for "contrib"

  $ apt-cache show java-package
  Package: java-package
  ...
  Section: contrib/misc

Check your /etc/apt/sources.list

  deb ftp://archive.progeny.com/debian/ sarge main contrib non-free

I believe cdparanoia puts the cdda.wav (or watever output file) in the
current directory, so, if you are in your home dir (as you probably
were before) then it would deposit the file there, and do so with out
any permission issues.  Judging from the prompt you show above:

       jjj at devil5/$

You are *not* in your home directory, rather you are in the root "/". 
You probably want your prompt to look like this:

       jjj at devil5 /home/jjj$

which signifies that you are in your home directory.  (Disclaimer:
every one's prompt is different, but I'm reasonably confident I've
interpreted yours correctly).  If you want to set up a script or
something that always puts the output file in the same place, run

      cdparanoia --help

and look for the option to specify an output file there. (I would
check for you, but I don't have a copy of cdparanoia handy).

HTH,
--Rogan

Subject: [PLUG] Need help: Groupwise migration: Netware to Linux
Message-ID: <20051214171705.19238.qmail@web51814.mail.yahoo.com>

I need a consultant to help me finish a Groupwise migration from
Netware to Linux. This project was started months ago, but my
consultant is no longer available. It would need to be a weekend job,
sometime in the next couple of months.

Currently a Netware server handles the MTA, GWIA and Webaccess agents.
A Suse 9.1 server handles the POA and holds the actual PO file system.
An outdated Webaccess webserver resides on an old Red Hat server. I
would like all the services moved to the Suse server, and the current
version of Webaccess set up on a new Linux install. A couple weeks
later, after everything has been proven stable, I want the Netware
server wiped and set up as an identical Suse server.

Is anyone here interested in helping me with this project?

-Scott

Message-ID: <c834ec80512141148m21add5e7v1d9dd8a92ff28fc4@mail.gmail.com>

I'm searching around for a cell phone, and realizing I have no idea
what I'm looking for, however, I have come to the following
conclusions:

1) Any phone I like will probably have a camera, even though I don't
really care if it has one.
2) since it has a camera, I'll probably want to be able to pull images
down to a linux box.
3) I've heard you can rebuild the menu structure on many phones these
days, as well as add java apps and what not.. has anyone tried doing
this from a linux system?

Anyway, I'm looking for input -- is this stuff even worth bothering
with? Is there any chance I'll be able to configure  / use my phone
with a linux box? Or should I just call it a phone and use it
separately from any computer? (I know the camera will suck... I
normally use a DSLR, obviously there is no comparison, but it could be
fun to have it working anyway).

I'd love to hear about other people's phone experiences, although if
you have only non-OS related comments, perhaps replies should be made
off-list. (just to keep from cluttering plug)

Thanks,
Rogan

Sorry, I don't have time for a long answer, but bitpim (www.bitpim.org)
is probably your best bet.  Don't expect to be able to do much wrt java
apps though, as the phone companies want to charge money for stuff like
that (Like I'm going to pay money for a game that runs on a 1"x2"
screen!).

FWIW, I got a new phone a couple months ago (A Motorola RAZR with
Cingular).  It's got a camera.  I specifically asked the Cingular lady
if I could transfer images (or other random digital blobs) over
bluetooth.  She said "no, you need to get the $10/month digital
service".  I went home and tried, and it works fine on Windows (ick!).
I've pulled photos off and pushed a ringtone on over bluetooth.  I
haven't figured out what I need to replicate that on Linux, but I
assume the tools are there.

What I want (which is apparently NOT what the rest of the world wants)
is a RAZR without the camera.  The RAZR has a lot of cool features
(like Bluetooth) in a tiny package that seems great from everything
I've read.  However, there's so many places that don't allow (or at
least strongly frown upon) cameras that I would rather just not have
one.  If I want to take pictures, I'm going to take them with a *good*
camera.

Ubuntu offers a variation called XUbuntu that's XFCE-based.  I tried
installing XUbuntu-desktop on my regular Ubuntu 5.10 system, then
logged out of the Gnome desktop and logged into the XFCE one.  It was
OK, if less well-polished as Gnome.  What was interesting was that
once Firefox had pigged out on all the RAM, the difference in memory
consumption between the two desktops was insignificant.

Waiting for the port of a KHTML-based browser to Gnome,

Really?  Like, where?  I haven't encountered that, personally.  I
didn't get the phone for the camera, but it didn't bother me that it
was there.  

Maybe you could just put a piece of electrical tape over the lens?
Or, if you need a permanent fix, a 6-penny nail and a ballpeen hammer
(smooth irregular surface afterwards with hotglue to avoid cuts). ;-)

You can use dpkg-reconfigure to re-do the config script that ran when
you installed it.  You'll almost certainly want the "smarthost" option.

I believe cdparanoia puts the cdda.wav (or watever output file) in the
current directory, so, if you are in your home dir (as you probably were
before) then it would deposit the file there, and do so with out any
permission issues.  Judging from the prompt you show above:

       jjj at devil5/$

You are *not* in your home directory, rather you are in the root "/". 
You probably want your prompt to look like this:

       jjj at devil5 /home/jjj$

which signifies that you are in your home directory.  (Disclaimer:
every one's prompt is different, but I'm reasonably confident I've
interpreted yours correctly).  If you want to set up a script or
something that always puts the output file in the same place, run

      cdparanoia --help

and look for the option to specify an output file there. (I would check
for you, but I don't have a copy of cdparanoia handy).

HTH,

Like any company that doesn't want you taking pictures of
pre-production products.

I've also heard of some issues with health clubs, though I don't
imagine myself taking a cell phone to a health club anytime soon (I
have a hard enough time taking *myself* to one...).  Heck, with
cameras increasing in video quality as well as still-photos, I imagine
it won't be long before you can't take them into theaters.

Thanks to you and Rogan for pointing out something that is so 
obvious I didn't even think of it. Actually, I just solved the problem 
by making it /home/jjj/cdda.wav. I will be ripping/encoding about a 
hundred CDs, so I can just toggle back and forth with the arrows, 
editing the command as necessary. The path can just stay there.

It takes a noobie a very long time to learn the tricks of the 
command line. :(

You may find it easier to use something like Grip to rip the cds.  It
will deal with the renaming and filing for you, although you may have
considered this before.  In any case, there are almost certianly
better options than manually ripping / encoding 100's of discs.

All,

I upgraded my clark connect gateway and was playing around with the network
tools. I saw this connection extablished: 

TCP	01:11:34.38	192.168.2.20   69.88.120.210 	ESTABLISHED	36649->80	HTTP
TCP	01:11:30.24	192.168.2.20   69.88.120.210	ESTABLISHED	41618->80	HTTP
TCP	01:11:25.61	192.168.2.20   69.88.120.210	ESTABLISHED	33028->80	HTTP

192.168.2.20 is my desktop. I wanted to investigate further so I pointed my
webbrowser to 69.88.120.210 but got nothing. That made me curious, so I started
up nmap and ran an OS Detection, and Nmap said it was a broadband router
(although Nmap is saying that conditions weren't ideal so it's just a guess).
Now I got a little paranoid and began looking at netstat to see if port 36649,
41618, or 33028 were open on my desktop, however, nothing showed up. Since the
ports are listed as established I would figure they should be in netstat
correct?

I've also run ethereal for about 15 minutes to collect data going across my
desktop eth0, but have not found any reference to 69.88.120.210 in that
traffic. Just to be safe I shut down all outgoing ports from my desktop to
69.88.120.210. The ports however, are still listed in clarkconnect's connection
monitor output. So I guess my question is, are these just left overs that
haven't closed, or are these ports actually open? If the latter, how do I get
them closed?

thanks,
Dan Herrington

Yeah, I tend to agree. The one frightening part of Debian is their choice
of exim4 as the default MTA. The other MTAs have got configuration
scripts that make them just as easy for simple installations. Of note
exim has had an awful lot of security updates.

Debian offers a sendmail package. If you want, grab the sendmail package
and rip exim4 out as it deserves.

Any chance you were pointing a web browser looking for heating and air

It really doesn't sound any more suspicious than that.

You can use lsof to find out what apps are using those connections:

lsof -i | grep -i "69.88.120.210"

should do it, although it may take a few minutes to run.

   Postfix should be considered, too. I set that up a few years ago and found
it easy to install, configure, and maintain. The latest book (published by No
Starch Press) is a valuable resource. It helped me tune my spam filters to
the point that very few get through now.

Message-ID: <20051215030558.51621.qmail@web50607.mail.yahoo.com>

I have found quite a few references on the Web to my
problem, with Sarge stable, but not yet a satisfactory
solution. Realplayer 10 installs and the slider goes
across, though silently.

RP 10 isn't geared to ALSA, and that seems to be the
problem. It worked in Sarge testing (2.4x), which
still used OSS. Installing alsa-oss is supposed to do
the job: then realplay is invoked as "aoss realplay."
You can't do this in a browser, of course, so you
write a shell script and invoke this instead.
Unfortunately, this doesn't work either, but when I
type such a command as

>aossrp file.ram

it not only launches the GUI, but the following
message:

Warning: LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/libaoss.so

This appears to be an environment variable. What can I
do about it?

Thanks all. The ip address doesn't have an assoicated website, so I'm not sure
why it would have appeared on the connection list initially.

After running that scan with Nmap earlier there are now dozens of "established"
connections to that ip, all to various ports. I'm beginning to suspect that
once the port connection is established it gets assigned a default timeout
which appears to be on the order of a day and a half. The connections currently
expire in one day and eight hours. I'm pretty sure there is no current
connection between the two boxes as all ports to and from that ip are shutdown
at the firewall, and the lsof output shows no open files on the local box.
Seems strange to have such a high connection time out period though.

Actually, we;ve been through all this before. I tried Grip and gave up 
on it as uselsess for classical music. The problem is that I am not 
ripping songs. I am ripping symphonies and operas. I want all the 
tracks in one mp3 file. But sometimes a CD has more than one 
symphony on it, in which case I want just the tracks for each 
symphony in one file. I've tried ripping individual tracks and then 
making them as one "song," but it does not work well in the real 
world. After all, why would I want to listen to just the thrid 
movement of a symphony without the first, second and fourth 
movements?

So the result is that I want to rip/encode the CDs individually and 
manually. Works better for classical. Unfortunately, Grip does not 
"think" this way. It is designed for an album containing a dozen 
popular songs where the publisher included one or two cool songs 
and the rest are junk that the user wants to dump. Or at the least, 
where the user wants to arrange individual "songs" into a "playlist." 
I have yet to create a playlist, as it is largely pointless for classical.

Subject: [PLUG] LCD Monitor Resolution Question
Message-ID: <43A1A2B8.9040104@comcast.net>

I'm looking for a flat screen monitor to replace my Mother-in-law's big 
glass box monitor. As I recall, LCD monitors used to come as 
one-resolution-is-all-I-can-do, but that something changed in the last 
couple of years.

Does anyone know just what changed (if I heard this correctly) to allow 
LCD monitors to cleanly display any of the various resolutions available 
for glass monitors? Or, was this just a problem with laptops, and 
doesn't affect stand alone monitors? My Thinkpad has a decent looking 
normal resolution of 800 x 600 and, while it will display 640 x 480, it 
doesn't look very good - especially the fonts (or maybe it's just the 
fonts -- I don't remember which; I just know it's not too good at 640 x 
480).

Mom needs 640 x 480 on a 17" monitor. When I'm over there fixing things 
for her, I usually change the resolution (this is a Win98 box) while I'm 
working on it, but then change it back for her. So, I'm hoping to find 
the combination of things I need to get her the resolution she needs, 
and the flexibility to have the resolution I want.

I'm willing to consider 800 x 600 on a 19" screen and see if that works.

Subject: [PLUG] postfix question:  discarding mail to nonexistent users
Message-ID: <20051215172731.GA12274@gate.kl-ic.com>


I cannot find a parameter in postfix for turning off bounces for
non-existent users.  If a spammer sends my server a mail to a
non-existent user, with a fraudulent return address, postfix 
sends a "no such user" message to the return address.  While this
is probably called for by RFCs, it is not productive behavior 
these days.  Just the mail logs are noting this is occuring are
getting up to 100MB a week. 

Is there a config parameter or other kludge for postfix that turns
off "non-existent user" bounces, and just discards these messages?

Keith

P.S.  Yes, I know there are other filtering approaches, and I
am setting those up, too.  Some (like some implementations of
greylisting) get into dependency hell, so I am going slowly.
Relying too much on any particular spam filtering method allows
for single-point failures, like old dikes in hurricanes.

Message-ID: <20051215215729.1053.qmail@web50601.mail.yahoo.com>

You're not supposed to trifle with the kernel in
Debian, I guess. After installing, say, Fedora, typing
"xconfig" would pop the window right up, but that's
not the case here (Sarge). The kernel source was
missing, and that's easy to correct. But then "make
xconfig"
*
* Unable to find the QT installation. Please make sure
that the
* QT development package is correctly installed and
the QTDIR
* environment variable is set to the correct location.
*
make[1]: *** [scripts/kconfig/.tmp_qtcheck] Error 1
make: *** [xconfig] Error 2

What's the QT installation? And what's the QT
development package? And what's the correct location
for the QTDIR environment variable? The query 

apt-cache search qt 

must have located at least 50 packages. Well, "config"
is dreadful, so I wanted to make sure that at least
"menuconfig" would work. But that complained that
ncurses-dev was absent. There is no such package, but
libncurses5-dev must be what they mean, for that
works.

But suppose I'm a perfectionist? What still needs to
be done to get into qconf? I once used it with Fedora,
and it's neat.

Because I think they are somehow connected to the fact that my 
iPod will not mount, although it did fine last time I tried, a couple 
months ago. Previously it auto-mounted. All I had to be careful of 
was to issue the command "umount /media/iPod" before 
disconnecting it.

Now, I plug it in, its display goes to "DO NOT DISCONNECT," but 
gtkpod can't see it. "Mount" does not list it. "Umount /media/iPod" 
says it is not mounted. And /mount/media/iPod gives me "mount: 
special device /dev/sda2 does not exist."

Does the last error message mean it is not listed in fstab or mtab? 
If so, how does it get in there, because I know I have never 
manually changed anything in those files. I only know of it from 
seeing references to it.

One additional clue: Last time I plugged in the iPod was a couple 
months ago. Since then I've added a USB pocket hard disk, which 
was plugged in when I plugged in the iPod. I'm thinking that made 
Ubuntu Breezy think the iPod was sda2 instead of its normal 
status as sda1. I unplugged the pocket disk, but that didn't change 
the error messages with iPod. 

I don't dare disconnect the iPod as long as that warning message 
is on its screen, or its filesystem will become corrupted and I'll 
have to go find a Windows XP computer to restore it. 

This sucks.

adding non-free to the sources doesn't fetch it. There
are rpm's available, so a .deb could conceivably be

I've been struggling with an ntpdate and ntpd problem for about two days. I'm
attempting to use ntpd on my gateway as the "master" time server for my
network. However, I can't even get ntpdate to work from the command line for
the various ntp servers I have in my ntp.conf file. Every server seems to work
fine in debug mode (-d option) but fails with the error " no server suitable
for synchronization found". Everything I've found on the web indicates this
message shows up when there is a network connection problem. I've verified with
tcpdump that messages are getting back and forth, and the "-d" option shows the
following:

Fetching libmotif-dev allowed Z88 to work. Not the
other program (which installed on FreeBSD with no
trouble), but a Java version of that one works better, anyhow.

Dick,

   My monitors are multi-frequency, but I've not tried them at 640x480.
However, I do know that my 17" LCD monitor is only 1/4" shorter diagonally
than was my 19" CRT monitor. That is, the view areas are almost the same.

Keith,

   Yup. I use:

         check_recipient_access hash:/etc/postfix/roleaccount_exceptions
         check_recipient_access hash:/etc/postfix/recipients
in /etc/postfix/main.cf.

   In those hash files, change the REJECT to DISCARD and they're silently
gone. I let postfix reject 'em and each day I get hundreds of attempted
messages addressed to my username with an additional 4 characters. Shrug.

I would first go to the ALSA web site and look for supported chip sets.
Here is the Intel supported list.
http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/index.php?vendor=vendor-Intel

and specific info on the HD set look like it was cut and paste but here it
is as such.
http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/doc-php/template.php?company=Intel&card=ICH+southbridge+HD-audio+and+modem.&chip=ICH6%2C+ICH6M%2C+ICH7%2C+ESB2&module=hda-intel

For additional help on this go to the ALSA users and developers e-mail
lists. Links to those lists are on the last web link.

You didn't specify what distribution, version, and ntp version you're
running.  Try decoding what's going out on the wire during the ntpdate
runs, check to make sure you're getting a response:

# tethereal -R "udp.port == 123"

Check that ntpd is running on the remote host (success of this command
will vary by nmap version, server version)

# nmap -sU -sV IP -p 123

The latest WAP (a Netgear) in the house freezes up if I run BitTorrent

What distro are you using? Gentoo more or less automatically configures 
ntp, and IIRC Debian does as well.

By the way, if you have a full NAT network, it's probably not necessary 
to have a time server on your network at all -- just synchronize 
everything to a public time server. However, if your network is isolated 
from the Internet for security reasons, you'll need to have a server.

Here's the configuration info from Gentoo -- not sure how generally 
applicable it is:

http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/home-router-howto.xml

Time Server

Keeping your system time correct is essential in maintaining a healthy 
system. One of the most common ways of accomplishing this is with the 
Network Time Protocol (NTP) and the ntp package (which provides 
implementations for both server and client).

Many people run ntp clients on their computers. Obviously, the more 
clients in the world, the larger the load the ntp servers need to 
shoulder. In environments like home networks though, we can help keep 
the load down on public servers while still providing the proper time to 
all our computers. As an added bonus, our private updates will be a lot 
faster for the clients too! All we have to do is run a ntp server on our 
router that synchronizes itself with the public internet servers while 
providing the time to the rest of the computers in the network. To get 
started, simply emerge ntp on the router.

Code Listing 6.3: Setting up the NTP server

# nano /etc/conf.d/ntp-client
Customize if you wish but the defaults should be fine
# rc-update add ntp-client default

# nano /etc/ntp.conf
Add the follwing lines:
restrict default ignore
restrict 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.255.0 notrust nomodify notrap
These will allow only ntp clients with an IP
address in the 192.168.0.xxx range to use your ntp server
# nano /etc/conf.d/ntpd
Customize if you wish but the defaults should be fine
# rc-update add ntpd default

# /etc/init.d/ntp-client start
# /etc/init.d/ntpd start
      

*Note: * You should make sure that you allow inbound and outbound 
communication on the ntp port (123/udp) when setting up the server. The 
client just needs outbound access on port 123 over udp.

Now, on your clients, have them emerge ntp also. However, we will just 
run the ntp client so setup is a lot simpler.

Code Listing 6.4: Setting up a NTP client

# nano /etc/conf.d/ntp-client
Change the 'pool.ntp.org' server in the NTPCLIENT_OPTS variable to '192.168.0.1'
# rc-update add ntp-client default
# /etc/init.d/ntp-client start

Try 'local_recipient_maps'; this will reject messages for unknown local
recipients during the SMTP session, which is even less overhead than
accepting-and-not-bouncing and without the side-effect of violating
RFCs.

You should be able to disconnect it with no problems, this time.  The
danger in unplugging it while it is "in use" is that you may stop a
disk write opperation before it is completed, leaving the ipod disk in
an unstable state.  Since you aren't actually *using* the ipod (it's
just plugged in -- not mounted, and you're not actually copying data
to it) this shouldn't happen. (I say "shouldn't" because it is
*possible* that the ipod is doing something bizzare to it's filesystem
-- I don't know it's internals. )  I've unplugged mine from similar
situations with no problem.

That's probably the issue.  The device entries are assigned when you
plug usb devices in, so if you haven't unplugged your ipod since you
unplugged your pocket drive, it will still be on a different
/dev/sda.. device.  Try unplugging the ipod and plugging it in with
out the pocket drive plugged in.  If that works, then we can worry
about getting both devices to show up at the same time.

Someone with udev or automounter experience can help more than I cank.

First, as someone already pointed out, a 15" LCD has viewable area which 
is 15" across the large diagonal which is almost as large as a 17" CRT 
monitors viewable area of between 15 and 16 inches.

Second, I have found most people find a good LCD to be much more 
readable than even a larger CRT monitor.  For example, I find it much, 
much easier to read the 1280x1024 LCD of a Compaq Presario 16" laptop 
than to read the 1280x1024 display from any of our 19" CRTs (and they 
are very good monitors with good video cards).  Just anecdotal, but I 
believe the older folks find this to be especially true. Maybe its the 
lack of jitterness.

Third, I have also found most find it easier to read and use a higher 
resolution screen with the font size, icon size, etc. enlarged than to 
read a low resolution displayed on a large screen.  This approach 
results in  text, icons, etc. that are as big and which are much, much 
better shaped and defined.  I know, esp with older windows vintages, the 
occasional small text/icon will show up but I think you'll find the 
overall result is much preferable. 

As to LCD monitor resolutions, LCD panels all have a "native resolution" 
which it is far best to run them at.  Anything else is scaled up/down by 
the LCD electronics and display with suboptimal results at the native 
resolution.  The scaled display often bad.  I would heartily recommend 
getting your mom a 17" or even 19" LCD, running it at the native 
resolution of 1280x1024, and making everything real big for her.

The only problem I ever have with ntp is that it will not sync if the 
time is off by 180 seconds or more. That number might be off. First 
update your time, either with date, ntpdate, or some implementations of 
ntpd.

I just installed openntpd ( a port of OpenBSD's ntpd ) on my gentoo 
machine and was able to update the time by running "ntpd -s"

Check your ntpd man page for help with a large time correction.

For some reason that iPod message won't go away until you "eject"
it. Use the 'eject' utility on the device node, i.e.:

   eject /dev/sda

I've just been through the "find a flat screen monitor" quest.  I ended
up with a 1280x1024 Viewsonic VA912B from Compusa, about $300 IIRC. I
ended up using the DVI interface to get maximum display quality.

We can assume that Win98 will never get any new drivers, so all you will
be able to drive is 640 x 480 (or 800 x 600) analog from your existing
card.  I haven't seen any big flat screens with this resolution.  I also
suspect if there is any pixel aliasing the monitor will look ugly (the
VA912B does this) so you will want a display that will show a multiple
of your desired resolution, so 1280 x 1024 on a 19 inch LCD may be your
best option.  Yes, there are $500 1600 x 1200 displays out there, but I
assume you have better ways to spend your money.

Unfortunately, you are still subject to how well the monitor does the
analog capture - even if it is capturing at an exact multiple, it
might look fuzzy.  That can be a function of the video source; some
of the newest video cards do some kind of clock dithering to reduce
EMI, and that would be a pain in the butt for the monitor analog
video capture.  I guess the best suggestion I can make is to consider
a 19 inch 1280x1024 monitor, and be ready to return it if it doesn't
look good.  BTW, a good test pattern is a grid of alternating
black/white pixels in a checkerboard pattern - guaranteed to make an
LCD monitor with bad analog capture display obvious streaking and noise.

When shopping for monitors, bring along a USB thumb drive with some
pictures to look at, arranged as a web page.  Most stores are glad to
let you look at your own pictures, and you can detect lots of problems
that way.  For example, I don't care about game and video performance,
but some monitors are optimized for that, costing some static performance
and off-axis viewing angle.  Look at the monitors from the direction
of "over Mom's shoulder" - many monitors look ugly from some directions,
depending on how they arrange the magic LCD goop to optimize various
things.  Monitors differ - select the one that works best in your 
specific situation.

Sorry I can't provide more help directly answering your question ("buy
X from Y") but hopefully that helps you conduct your search.


At the risk of making a long email longer, you have another option for
Mom - set her up with a Linux box running Win98 under Win4Lin (which
is how I run the occasional windoze program).  Win4Lin does not work
with some games and 3 button mouse apps, and it is a pain in the butt
to install, but the older versions at least work on top of a native
Linux file system, and communicate through Linux, so you get all the
firewalling and Linux file security and drivers and so forth.  Right
now, I have Win4Lin running on one of my virtual desktops on my laptop,
so I can run Internet Exploder on some poorly designed websites.  The
newest versions of Win4Lin, and alternatives like VMWare, use a big
opaque file as the disk partition for Win98, which means I cannot get
directly at the files inside it from Linux.  But all this may be more
distraction than you want, even if in the long term it prevents problems
with an unsupported OS.

VMWare is probably a better product all around - I understand the
emulation is better.  I use Win4Lin version 4 because I prefer to 
store files in native Linux format.  Neither product is open source,
which can be a royal pain in the ass when connecting these to a 
kernel.

All these emulators are spendy - and VMWare used to cost more like
$400, but the price has eroded because of the competition with
Win4Lin.  If you can wait, I imagine somebody will come out with
an open source windows emulator based on Xen someday.

It's worth noting that the "Free[1]" version of VMWare Player allows
running of native VMware entities.  I'm currently evaluating this to
significantly[2] reduce the licensing costs for use.  I still have
concerns of feature-set and the lifetime of this pricing model.  If
it's possible to pay only for per-session licensing for the full
version used to create and modify guest OS installations, but run the
Player unlimited-ly, then it's a significant boon to instances like
mine:

1000+ node clusters with (currently) licensing per-guest to run a
Windows app inside the Linux host.  This currently keeps us (and other
installations I've worked at) from even going this route on a
large-scale.

-1:  This is still proprietary, closed-source, and subject to
licensing restrictions.
-2:  This is IMO a good idea for VMWare, as the costs of use can sum
up to be staggering for what amounts to a 'workaround' .  The MS tax
is bad enough if you "need" it for some purpose.  If this works out
for them, they well may see more revenue from people actually buying
licenses for the product :)

or run rdate

You may need to download rdate

Then for educated time.

rdate -p time.mit.edu

Ok..

You need the headers and scr if you are going to compile the  kernel

You also need gcc...

Check to see it there is a meta package called built-essential



 # apt-cache search bui* | grep build-ess
build-essential - informational list of build-essential packages


Try that

Subject: [PLUG] Need help w/ a procmail recipe
Message-ID: <e3b7bac0512161235v34a5444ds5561677acf26e9db@mail.gmail.com>

Hey All,

I was wondering if anyone can point out why the following recipes are
failing to cause all multipart/alternative and multipart/mixed e-mails
to be converted to plain text and output to the mailbox called other:

LOGABSTRACT=all
PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH            # munpack is in $HOME/bin.
TMPDIR=/tmp/procmail.$$
TRAP="rm -rf $TMPDIR; $TRAP"
VERBOSE=yes

:0 Wic
* ^Content-Type: multipart.*
|mkdir -p $TMPDIR

# Message is multipart/alternative.  First part is text
# and should be discarded.  Second part is HTML and should
# be converted.
:0 w
* ^Content-Type: multipart/alternative.*
|munpack -t -C $TMPDIR && \
lynx -dump -force_html $TMPDIR/part2 | \
cat -s

# Message is multipart/mixed or related.  HTML is first part.
:0 w
* ^Content-Type: multipart.*
* ! ^Content-Type: multipart/alternative.*
|munpack -t -C $TMPDIR && \
lynx -dump -force_html $DIR/part1 | \
cat -s

:0:
other

Because none of the commands output their results to a file but serve
as  filters (save mkdir which has been flagged to continue
regardless), it was my understanding that procmail would continue
processing the other rules.  It does though as you can see from this
log entry:

procmail: [14124] Fri Dec 16 12:32:11 2005

Sorry. It's ClarkConnect version 3.1, 2.6.9-27.cc kernel, unmodified from

I don't have either of those utilites on the box, so I'd have to build them.
When I run ntpdate -v hydrogen.cert.ucr.edu the tcpdump shows:

the ntpdate -d hydrogen.cert.ucr.edu gets a full response back, so I'm pretty

I know this is not a firewall problem becuase this is the gateway box and the
communications are going over the wan nic, so no firewall to contend with.

My boxes behind the router are Gentoo. I checked out the gentoo wiki for info,
but it didn't seem to help with the connection info using ntpdate.

I figured there would be a sync problem, but from the manpage it appeared that
ntpdate should update the time so they would be in sync. However, the local and
remote don't seem to be very far off:

I'm not sure I understand.  What do the roleaccount_exceptions and
recipients files look like?  I don't have them in my postfix directory.
Do I need to provide a list of valid users?  Does postfix send anything
at all back to the fraudulent sender address?

What I would like to do is just finish the smtp handshake then
silently send everything, log file entries included, to /dev/null if
there is no user to forward the mail to.  When 99.99% of incorrectly
addressed email is the result of directory attacks looking for valid
email addresses in order to spam them, I don't want to waste network
bandwidth responding.  If the RFCs specify sending back a response,
they need to be rewritten - that is pathological behavior in 2005 AD.

When I look at access(5) for DISCARD, I see:

  DISCARD optional text...
       Claim  successful  delivery  and  silently discard the message.
       Log the optional text if specified,  otherwise  log  a  generic
       message.

I suppose if I make the optional text "u", then I get a short cryptic
log entry, and short is better than long, though I would prefer no message
at all.  But since I don't have either a roleaccount_exceptions file or a
recipients file, I don't know what DISCARD or REJECT are in relation to.

That's encouraging. A 17" might work for Mom at 800 x 600, and a 19" 
should have no problem.

Good to know. Mom has mentioned some jitterness on the screen from time

I'll have to fool around with this. There's something in the 
"Accessibility" settings that might work. Like a lot of folks, Mom 
doesn't like change, especially when it comes to here computer. She's 
figured out how to make it do the few things she wants from it, and even 
though some things that seem minor to us would make it easier, it will 
take significant coaxing to get her to try it, let alone switch to it.

That confirms my experience with my laptop, and is what I was hoping had 
improved.

I'll see if I can test this out at a computer store.

Thanks for the ideas.

Her card will drive at least 1024 x 768, and one or two steps beyond 
that (I've never tried higher than 1024 x 768).

I haven't taken the USB thumb drive plunge, yet, but I do have a CD of

Good point. Mom does e-mail, and MS Games, and that's pretty much it. 
She does tend to be right in front of the screen, so off axis shouldn't

I'll give this some serious thought. She's probably not going to like 
it, but maybe I can set it up to come up looking like what she's used to 
seeing. I do have her on the Win version of Thunderbird, so that 
shouldn't be too hard of a switch for her. She's also used to using 
Word; switching her to OO may be asking too much, but if I could get 
Word to work in Win4Lin... I'll have to try it all here, first. If it 
works, then I could get her a new video card and monitor combo, along 
with a Linux installation.

At the pace she's comfortable with, I'll let you know how it works out 
sometime after Easter!

Thanks for the ideas.

I've found if you scale down in a manner that makes sense, the results
aren't so bad.  If you scale from 1024x768 (native) to 800x600, for
example, you're going to have very ugly results.  However, if you scale
down from 1600x1200 (native) to 800x600, things are fine.

I've found the LCDs at work scale down nicely either way.  They're 19"
... I don't recall the brand name, but can look it up for you on
Wednesday after I'm back from vacation if you wish.  Their native
resolution is 1280x1024 (or something similar?) but they scale down to
1024x768 without the blotchiness you see in older LCDs.  They picture
isn't as sharp, but the older eyes in the office (those over the age of
40  :-P) prefer the scaled down version to the native resolution.

   Well, you're certainly welcome to use DISCARD rather than REJECT. Look at
it this way: rejection generates economic activity via backbone traffic and
the electricity needed to run the 'Net. You don't want to stiffle economic
growth, do you?

   It's all relative, Keith.

   BTW, if you'd like a list of all the checks I've implemented in
/etc/postfix/main.cf I'll send it to you. The order matters, I've learned.

   FWIW, with the new tuned and tested SMTP restrictions and a tuned set of
scores and rules for SpamAssassin I'm averaging about 1 spam per day that
actually makes it to my inbox. I can easily live with this.

Dick,

   My 17" LCD display at 1280x1024 is as easy for me to read without reading
glasses as was the 19" CRT at 1024x768. It's much clearer, too.

I had this problem with my Dad on a windows box.  I told him the right
solution was to use the native resolution of the LCD and scale the
fonts up instead.  Turns out, on windows, that didn't work.  No reason it
shouldn't.

BTW, these 43 year-old eyes are doing fine at 1600x1200 on a nice
Samsung 204T at normal font size.  Drawback of the 1600x1200 is the
$500+ pricetag (I just paid $550 for one), but after years using a
nice 1600x1200 trinitron I couldn't bear going back to 1280x1024.

OK, this worked before. Now it does not. I can't make any sense 
out of what is different now and why it is not working.

What is not working? Getting new mp3s into my iPod with gtkpod. 
In the past I plugged it into a USB port, I opened gtkpod, I told 
gtkpod to read its files. Then I added new mp3s to the list in gtkpod 
and told it to Sync. It synced. Done.

Now it does not automatically mount. But bear with me here, 
because my understanding of when something is mounted and 
when it is not is dim. E.g., if I can drag a file to and from a drive, I 
figure it is mounted. But I have been told that is not necessarily 
true. I don't understand why. I do understand the filesystem and 
mount points v. Windows way of doing things. I just don't 
understand when something is mounted.

So anyway, I plug in the iPod. I do "mount" and note that it is not 
mounted. So then I do "mount /media/iPod." This gives me an error 
message that special device sda2 does not exist. Like hell it 
doesn't. I even held the iPod up in front of the monitor so Ubuntu 
could get a good look at it. Doesn't exist. Bah. Stupid computer.

So finally I figure out that the command line seems to want the 
whole nine yards. It wants "mount /dev/sda -t vfat /media/iPod." But 
even that generated an error message. You see, just because I'm 
the one who paid for the computer doesn't mean I get to use it. At 
least, not as far as Linux is concerned. No. I have to mount the 
iPod as root. Otherwise I am just a worthless no-count user.

OK, so I do "sudo mount /dev/sda2 -t vfat /media/iPod." Yay! It's 
mounted! (Or seems to be.)

OK then I open gtkpod, it reads the iPod's database, and I proceed 
to add some new mp3s. Then I do Sync. And for each new mp3 I 
get:

"Error opening 
'/media/iPod/iPod_Control/Music/F12/gtkpod561325.mp3' for 
writing (Permission denied)."

What the hell? OK, I go to Konqueror and check permissions. Sure 
enough, the iPod is owned by root. Well, of course it is. Ubuntu 
required that I be root in order to mount it. But remember, gtkpod is 
being run by a mere worthless no-count user. So gtkpod can't write 
to the iPod. Why did this work before?

So what should I do? Create a new root account and just run 
everything as root from now on forever? Yeah, yeah, I know, you're 
not ever supposed to do that. OK, I won't. But the current situation 
is driving me insane. Plus, I really, really need my iPod. Because 
of the annoying Christmas music this time of year, I can't listen to 
the radio -- for the health of the radio, you understand -- because if I 
have to listen to one more little tin soldier I'm going to take a 
shotgun to the radio. And there are nine more days until this 
pseudo-religious madness is over. 

OK, getting back to resolving the problem. The last time I mounted 
my iPod and added stuff with gtkpod was a couple months ago. 
Back then I had 64-bit Hoary. Now I have 64-bit Breezy. So maybe 
Breezy broke something. But what? Suspicion: It broke the 
automount feature. But all I know about automount is that it exists 
and it's some cool feature of recent releases. 

So first, I need someone to tell me if my thinking is anywhere close 
to correct, that is, that the problem may lie with automount. And 
second, how to fix automount. And third, any other suggestions, 
including the fact that (as usual) I'm a hopeless n00bie who keeps 
screwing up his computer.

Having the mount point owned by root is not a problem although it should
allow read and search permissions for everyone (rwx r-x r-x, or 755).
Your mount directive did not mount the device read-only so that should be ok
too.
Is it possible to look at the dirs/files on the device to see what their
permissions are using tools like 'ls' ?

John,

I feel your pain. The good news is that you've hit upon what is perhaps
the toughest permissions related hurdle for new users: default mounting
permissions.

There's a reason why mount works the way it does, that's another post.
Try one of the following (be certain to unmount the iPod volume first):

  sudo mount -t vfat -o umask=000 /dev/sda2 /media/iPod

Or (better yet):

sudo mount -t vfat -o uname=[your_user_name] /dev/sda2 /media/iPod

Send an 'ls -ld' of your /media/iPod directory if you still are having
trouble.

Thanks for the pointer. That makes sense.

Yes, I can navigate to the directories on the iPod (as jjj) using the 
command line. I can see anything that is there. However, the ls 
command does not list the permissions, just the folder/file names. I 
did ls --help to see if there was an option to display permissions, 
but didn't see one.

However, Konqueror does list the permissions. There are four 
folders on the iPod (Calendars, Contacts, iPod_Control, and 
Notes). They are all rwxr-xr-x. The Calendars, Contacts and Notes 
folders are unused. The iPod_Contol folder has three folders 
(Device, iTunes and Music). They are also all rwxr-xr-x. And each 
has files and/or subfolders, and all are also rwxr-xr-x. Evidently the 
whole thing is rwxr-xr-x.

However, I don't know the syntax for what rwxr-xr-x means. Is this 
a bad thing? If so, is it possible to change it?

Now I can't unmount it.

umount /dev/iPod gives me "umount: /media/iPod disagrees with 
the fstab." That damn fstab again. 

So I tried "umount /dev/sda2" and got "umount: /dev/sda2 is not 
mounted (according to mtab)." Ah, god old mtab. If fstab doesn't 
screw me up, mtab will step in and make sure I remain powerless 
over this computer.

But if I run "mount," the last line says it is mounted. Oh wait, it 
says sdb2, not sda2. OK, got it unmounted finally with "sudo 
umount /dev/sdb2."

>   sudo mount -t vfat -o umask=000 /dev/sda2 /media/iPod

Omigod, it WORKED! As I sit here gtkpod is finally syncing!

OK, I had to change your line to sdb2. So now that the immediate 
problem is resolved, it's time to see if I can learn something from 
this.

1) Why is it sometimes sda2 and sometimes sdb2?  

2) I know what the -t vfat does (although the documentation says it 
should not be necessary). And I understand the device is /dev/sdb2 
and the mount point is /media/iPod. But what does "-o 
umask=000" do?

3) Any theories as to why it automounted and worked without any 
problems a couple months ago, and now requires a PhD in 
CompSci to get it working?

> Or (better yet):

I have saved all the correspondence, for future reference. You 
swee, I know that next time I try to mount the iPod something else 
will be screwed up.

I recently had to go through this with my mother-in-law.  I got her a
new computer for Christmas and I did not want to have to deal with
Windows and to ensure that she updated on a regular basis so I
installed SuSE 10.  At first, she was not sure about the change, but
it only took 1 week of playing around with it, before she felt
comfortable.  She found OO was so similar to word that there was no
problem using OO.  The big bonus is that I setup the system so that I
can SSH to the system remotely if she has any problem, I do not have
to travel to her house to resolve any issues.  I did have to install
JRE-5 on the system so that she could play her YAHOO games (which I
did remotely :)).

No distribution particularly likes you playing with the kernel. Just
differing distributions install differing percentages of the packages
needed for kernel building by default. Since Fedora isn't aimed at end
users it make sense for them to install development packages by default,
while Debian which aims to be a stable base doesn't.

The "proper" way to do kernels on Debian is to install the
"kernel-package" package. You then use the script "make-kpkg" as a
front-end to the kernel build, and it produces a Debian package for you.

One wonders if perhaps this was a precursor to Linus going for KDE.
Perhaps they bribed Linus by writing the qconfig script, while the GTK
folks got into the game late.

Installing "kernel-package" would of sucked that in as a suggested
package (though you could of told the system to disregard that).

Installing "kernel-package", using `make-kpkg`, and installing the
package produced is the right way. You've also got the option to install
"libgtk2.0-dev" and use gconfig which is the GTK front-end.

Now that's an important idea I hadn't thought of. She's on dial-up with 
SpiritOne. If I can get her to try it, I'll be back for assistance on 
how to make that work.

Don't forget the Free QEmu emulator.  With the kernel module it performs
about as well as VMware, although it still doesn't have a decent gui that
exposes all of it's features as cleanly as VMware.  It does have the added
advantage of running as an emulator on non x86 hardware which is kind of
nice.

Used it at OSDL back in the day, where it served admirably in its
important role of waking up sysadmins at unreasonable hours.

Got it set up properly a few weeks ago at my current job.

Important tip: do *not* enable off-hours pager notification until
you've negotiated compensation for being on-call, and arranged for
someone else to take the pager sometimes.

I too found the ability to SSH into remote relative's computers a BIG 
advantage.

I just added a script/icon on there desktop which would tell them the 
address of their current session.  When they needed help, they got 
connected to their ISP, called me, gave me the current IP, and in I'd go.

By the way, at first a script did not seem necessary because they could 
just run ifconfig or somesuch in a terminal window BUT even talking them 
through that much often got them frustrated.  Thus a simple script/icon.

I thought about having a start up script just email me the new IP but 
did not want the mail clutter.

Unfortunately, this won't work, since the current session would be tying 
up her phone. Maybe I can work something the other way around where when 
she calls me, I give her my current IP (I'm on Comcast, so it changes 
sometimes), which she types in response to a prompt in a script, hangs 
up, then responds to another prompt in the script to get it to dial out 
and connect with me. I'll have to figure out how to get it through my 
Netgear Router and to my machine -- instead of my wife's or one of the 
other ones in the house.

Maybe a script on her machine could get her IP address, and e-mail it to 
me. That probably makes more sense.

I suppose it is possible that the batteries are just dead, but why

Thanks. Once I realized it automatically showed the permissions, 
it's faster to user Konqueror, which I always have running.

Thanks to Cooper and Charles I am now able to get it mounted and 
dismounted, and the permissions are correct so I can read/write to 
it. Strangely, sometimes when I plug it in dmesg | tail says it is 
sda and sometimes it is sdb. So I always have to dmesg before 
trying to mount it. Weird.

Even stranger is that it always worked with automount before, 
without any need to do a mount command. It just magically 
mounted the moment I plugged it in. I was always able to 
read/write to it.

I went into System > Administration > Users and Groups  and 
clicked on my username. I have permission to access external 
drives (all the boxes are checked, in fact). So I don't understand 
why I have to give it the option "-o umask:000" in the mount 
command in order to be able to write to it. And another thing, if I 
give it "-o umask:jjj" or -jjj:jjj the command fails.

At least I can mount and unmount it now. These are just things I 
am trying to understand here.

Ok, well since it sounds like a couple of people are using it...
One thing I'm stuck is is that I can't get notifications working
for services. (They work for hosts.)

I've got:

 notifications_enabled           1
 notification_options            w,u,c,r,f
 notification_interval           60
 notification_period             24x7

for services, and

 service_notification_period     24x7
 service_notification_options    w,u,c,r,f,n
 service_notification_commands   notify-by-email

In the contact records.

(I didn't want to spam the list with ALL my config files, but
I'd be happy to make them available to anyone who's interested.)

Is there anything questionable about the lines above, or any
typical 'gotchas' with getting notifications to work for services?

There is an LED on the device that is supposed to indicate "Replace
Batteries" or something.  It is supposed to do a self-test and report
on status.  Never lit.  That's what I'm talking about.  My reading of
the manual indicates it is _supposed_ to be that smart.

I don't want to buy new batteries if the whole thing is junk.

Do you hate automounters yet?  I know I do.  IMO, a great way to find 
trouble is to plug and unplug disks without knowing what the OS is up 
to (the same goes for windows -- which sucks even more because you have 
no way to disable this silly opaque behavior.)

Read the manpages for mount, umount, and fstab.

If you don't like reading manpages on the console (I know I don't) just 
put "man:fstab" in the address bar of konqueror.

Ok, just read the first line of "man fstab".

Note:  it says "fstab - static information about the filesystems"

Yeah, that sucks, but that's the way it is, and it is pretty stable and 
transparent even if it doesn't mesh well with usb disks.

If you disable your automounter, you only have to put a line 
in /etc/fstab for every disk that you want to mount.  The trouble with 
this when it comes to usb disks is that they are /dev/sd<whatever 
letter comes next> depending on the order in which you have plugged 
them in, when you last rebooted, day of the week, price of stamps, lunar 
phase, etc.

That's no fun.

What *is* fun is udev.

Maybe it's too complicated to just hold your nose and dive in without 
completely wrecking your system and having to use vi from the command 
line to recover (but isn't that everything that's cool about Linux?)

Anyway, if you're not afraid of that (or at least you know someone who 
has the skills to resurrect your box from a bricklike state), you just 
have to figure out the serial number/model or some other identifying 
information for each usb disk.  This is most easily done by 
watching /var/log/messages as you plug it in and then doing something 
like:

  cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/4-4/product

(Where I really do mean _like_ because the magic number 4-4 comes from 
the very messy /devices/pci0000:00/blah-blah/<magic-number>/blah-blah 
string that "tail /var/log/messages" tells you.)

product contains something like:

  "USB DISK 2.0"

There's also "serial", "idVendor" and some other interesting stuff in 
there.  Look around, it's just some text files, symlinks, and 
directories.  Hmm... transparent... drool...

Ok, so now you put something _like_ this in /etc/udev/udev.rules.

BUS="usb", KERNEL="sd*", SYSFS{product}="USB DISK 2.0", NAME="%k", 
SYMLINK="mydisk%n"

And, finally, the next time you plug in that usb disk, udev will 
create /dev/mydisk, /dev/mydisk1,  and so on (though you probably only 
have one partition.)

Now you can put a _static_ line in that file that contains "static 
information about the filesystems" and just do mount /media/mydisk, 
umount /media/mydisk and _know_ what is happening with your disks 
rather than wondering if they are currently being eaten by your 
automounter.

You can do lots of other fun stuff with udev too, including 
automatically mounting the disk, starting kteatime (though you might 
need dcop for that?) whenever you plug in the usb teawarmer, etc.

Could be. But, she in Lake Oswego and I'm in Oregon City, so it's at 
least worth looking into. However, I'm not holding my breath.

Well, if it's just plain shutting down or cutting out, it could be bad
batteries (IE it tries to fill in for a small power problem but the
juice ain't there) or it could be the output board.

If you can afford it, just pick up a replacement at yon local big-box
and donate the old one to FreeGeek.  They *love* bigger APC UPSes.
Also, as of this instant, the FreeGeek store is open for another 20
minutes, and they sell UPSes.

Off to buy a couple CD-ROM drives for work,

How much voltage should there be on a dead battery?  I just measured
13.15 and 13.2 V, respectively.  PowerSonic PS-12120 F2.

Message-ID: <20051218044738.299884072@joseph.doink.com>


I have a fairly new home-built computer that's having mouse
related trouble.  My mouse looses the ability to move my cursor
vertically with annoying frequency.  I don't think that the
mouse itself has trouble, although it could be related to mouse
configuration.  I can force the problem to occur at any time by
clicking on the "Edit" menu button in Konqueror.  After that I
can't do anything with the computer other than power it off, and
move the mouse cursor left and right.  Ctrl-Alt-Del doesn't work,
nor does Ctrl-Alt-Bkspc, nor Ctrl-Alt-Fn, nor do the kernel SysRq
keys.

I've googled a lot, read FAQs, and haven't be successful at all
in changing the behavior.

My system uses an Athlon 4200+ 64-X2 in an ABIT AV8-3rd Eye
motherboard.  The video card is a Radeon 9250.  The keyboard is
Logitec, and the mouse is a 3-button Logitec unit which I've
used quite a bit with a laptop and with no problems in that
application.

The OS is Mandriva 2006.0.

Can anyone please advise me on this?

Thanks....

Looks OK, though often a bad battery can show a good voltage, but fail
a load test.  Short the battery for a half-second with a long piece of
wire and then measure the voltage.  Or see if you can monitor the
battery voltage during a UPS test.  Or you could put the UPS into
Runtime Calibration mode.

The UPS probably uses standard-issue rectangular 12V 7AH gel-cells,
which you can buy at any business with "Batteries" in the name or at
Fry's; you can also take a chance on some used ones from Wacky
Willy's.  All are open Sunday.

Heck, if it's for your business, buy a new one and expense it this
year.  (Section 179 depreciation, or as my Econ prof calls it,
"daddy's little helper".) CompUSA has an APC BX1500 on sale for $150.

What version of nagios are you running? I'm using 2.0b3; if you're 
somewhere in that ballpark, then these snippets may be helpful:

define service {
   name                  enterprise-service
   register              0
   check_period          24x7
   contact_groups        admins
   max_check_attempts    3
   normal_check_interval 30
   notification_interval 60
   notification_options  w,c,r
   notification_period   24x7
   retry_check_interval  2
   }

   [....]

define service {
   host_name             BlahBlah
   service_description   SMTP server
   check_command         check_smtp
   use                   enterprise-service
   }

I'd also be interested to know if anything shows up in your system 
logs. Does nagios try to send messages but get thwarted by local SMTP 
configs? Do you have a smarthost somewhere in your e-mail chain that's 
refusing to relay?

Well, it had enough juice to cook a 47 ohm resistor in about 5 seconds
with no measurable loss of voltage.  My guess is that batteries are
okay.

OK then, it's likely something that'll take too long to fix.  I'd
suggest buying another one and donating the old one to FG on Tuesday
(they're closed this Wednesday).  They *love* good UPS batteries,
especially 1212s.

It can, but you have to tell procmail to treat the pipe as a filter;
otherwise it expects the piped command to do the final delivery. For a
piped delivery example, my spamassassin capture rule looks like so:

  # SpamAssasin adds a header for stuff it thinks is spam.
  :0:
  * ^X-Spam-Status: Yes,
  | gzip >> spam.archive/spam-${MONTH}.gz

because I like to keep an archive of it around, but prefer it take up
as little space as possible.

Perusing my own .procmailrc, all the rules I have that act as filters
are prefixed with:

  :0 fw

rather than just the bare:

  :0 w

that you have, so you might try that.

A couple of other misc notes, not related to the issue you're having:

  - you might wrap up everything into a script, so that you don't have
    to have that funny rule+trap to mkdir/rmdir.
  - /tmp/procmail.$$ is a pretty guessable/DOSable path, use mktemp(1)
    (and create/use a ~/tmp/ as well)

HTH.

Subject: [PLUG] vsftpd, virtual users
Message-ID: <20051218080218.78d96cd7@badger.had1.or.comcast.net.>

Hi.
I've inherited a setup where users are logging in via ftp to home directories 
(/home/$USER), and they're being authenticated against the user password. 
We're migrating our setup to a new server, and I've convinced the powers that 
be that since all the user info is in a database anyway, to use vsftpd and 
pam-mysql to authenticate them. Now, I've got all users logging in properly
on the new system and download is copacetic, but they just might want to 
upload new web pages and the like. But the permissions are wrong; because 
we're rsyncing from the original server to the new server, the owner of the file
is the uid of the owner on the original server. I'm sure that there's some 
configuration setting I'm missing here, because it seems like it should be working
'ok' ?  I've read through the man pages a few times, and can't spot where it says 
"to allow writing for an authenticated user to their chrooted directory ..."

I can run chown -R ftp.ftp on the home directory and it fixes this problem, but 
that'll cause rsync to work overtime and recopy the directory, won't it? 

Would you take a look at this vsftpd.conf and tell me what I'm missing?

Kevin,

I don't know Mandriva much at all, but does opening the mouse
configuration applet help at all?  It might be worthwhile reselecting
the driver and seeing if this resets the mouse configuration.  This
might be a temporary stopgap, but also might help troubleshoot where
the issue is.  You will probably need to navigate to the applet using
the keyboard, but I would assume whatever window manager Mandriva uses
should allow you to do this.  In Gnome+Ubuntu, hitting alt-f1 brings
me to the first menu in the menu list, so that might help.

Message-ID: <20051218114337.25a50f6c@badger.had1.or.comcast.net.>

System is an AMD64 SuSE/United Linux (1.0) computer...


It's creating the Work directory as owned by root, and then can't get into it and check it.
MX_USER is set to defang.
Clamd user is set to defang.
ps aux | grep mimedefang shows that most of the processes are owned by defang.
/var/spool/MIMEDefang is owned by defang.defang, the spool directory is owned 
by defang.defang, all subdirs and files are owned by defang.defang EXCEPT 
results file and Work directory.

I've been beating it up for about two hours, comparing two different servers 
and googling like mad.

Any tips?

Check your startup script and see what user is running defang.  Sounds like root is running the process.

Not that big, just the production hosts/services.  Including routers,
around 8 boxes, maybe 20 or 30 services total.

I'm actually monitoring more now at my current job.  Though I want to
set up another monitoring box so I can get notified if the main Nagios
box stops working.  Helps that we have some hosts offsite at a couple
colos.  Otherwise, I'd have to worry about my monitoring box being cut
off from being able to send text messages via email.

Well, sounds like a call to Microsoft support is in order.  After all,
that's part of what you paid for when you bought the copy of Windows
you're installing, right?

Graphics card was the culprit.  Or at least the lack of a W2K driver for 
the card.  Kind of an odd card - an AGP with an Intel accelerator.  
Can't find out much on the internets about it - part number on the board 
is 9804-20 with an FCC ID of ICUVGA-GW804B.  Whatever it is, Linux knows 
about it and Windoze does not (at least back when W2K came out.

The system would come up until the point where it switches from 
startup-mode graphics to "real" graphics that the window manager uses.  
Then it would barf and start over.

Well, solved that one.  That makes me 1 out of 32767  :-)

Subject: [PLUG] Time to learn how to do a script
Message-ID: <43A5BD1E.16393.DCA7C90C@localhost>

I use OO.o 2.0 on my Windows 2000 computer and OO.o 1.9 on 
my Ubuntu-64 laptop. I use them a LOT. 

On the Windows computer OO.o comes with a little program called 
quickstarter.exe. You can put this in your Startup folder if you want 
it always running (I do). It places a little icon in the system tray. 
You can right-click on the icon to do things like "open new Writer 
document," "open existing document," etc.

The Linux version of OO.o does not come with this utility. 
Supposedly there are two equivalents available from the Linux 
community -- ooqstart-gnome and oooqs-kde -- but neither is listed 
in Synaptic. Possibly another one of those 64-bit issues. Or maybe 
it's in some weird repository that I don't have enabled.

The person who told me about these two utilities also suggested 
that I write a little script instead. He suggested:

#!/bin/sh
while true; do
  xdpyinfo 2>&1 >/dev/null  ||  exit
  soffice -quickstart
done

Nice of him to include the code, since I have zero programming 
ability. But what do I do with the code? I assume I save it as a file 
somewhere, but where? And does it need a specific extension? 
And how do I make it run?

Of course, it might also be possible to get the oogstart-gnome 
utility to run on my 64-bit Breezy. I did find a link to what may be 
the utility at:

http://cia.navi.cx/stats/project/gnome/gnome-ooqs?s_message=3

But none of that page makes much sense to me, so I'm guessing 
I'm going to have to figure out how to run a script.

Thanks in advance for suggestions.

For some reason the mimedefang.pl script was being started by root. I couldn't make it stop.
So I cut my losses and removed mimedefang (sigh) and installed spamass-milter, which'll do 
what I want it to anyway (drop all spammy messages passing thru the system). That's a fine solution,
the boss-man is particularly sensitive to load issues on our mail servers.  I'll hit it with a clam
milter next and call it good.

Thanks for your eyeballs.

When will Mozilla get over itself and drop GTK in favor of QT so it actually

Hi John,
I primarily use KDE, but a quick Google search brought this page up with 
information on how to autostart programs in Gnome:

http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Autostart_Programs

Whether you use KDE or Gnome, however, you'll need to create a file with 
your favorite text editor and paste in the script that was given to 
you.  A file extension isn't required, but since it's a shell script, 
you should give it a ".sh" extension to easily identify what type of 
file it is.  Put this file in a place such as /usr/local/bin.  Next, 
make the script executable.  So if you named the script ooquick.sh, for 
example, then you would run the command "chmod +x ooquick.sh" (or 
right-click the file in your file-browser and make it executable).

Message-ID: <20051219171838.GA3537@gate.kl-ic.com>


Are there limits on how many ethernet switches can be placed in series
and still work reliably?  I've run into an interesting problem, and
exceeding some limit might be the cause.

I have computers scattered throughout the house and my home office,
and rather than run big bundles of parallel cat5 everywhere, I tend
to run just a single run of cable then branch out with little ethernet
switch boxes (mostly Linksys 5 port and 8 port units).  From the 
firewall machine to the laptop cables in the kitchen and my wife's
office, there are typically 5 cat5 runs and 4 switches in series between
the firewall and a machine:  (1) Wifi AP/router (2) downstairs switch
(3) upstairs switch (4) room switch.  

(And to anticipate an irrelevant suggestion, no I don't normally leave
the laptops on wifi - the bandwidth is too low for nightly backups, and
it is more secure to send most packets down wires)

Well, the power has been glitching the last few days because of the
wind and the furnace coming on.  About once or twice a day, the upstairs
computers go incommunicado, not talking to each other or to downstairs
and the firewall.  The machines downstairs keep talking to each other
and the net.  I can make the problem go away by power cycling the 
upstairs switches.  About 3 weeks ago I added a new ( brand X ) switch
in a room, but otherwise this setup has worked seemlessly for the last
year or so.

This may be due to a bad switch (either failing or poorly designed),
or it may be that I have exceeded some specification for number of
switches in series (perhaps they get confused when stacked this deep).
Or it might be something else.  Ideas?

Ok, it won't be a full month, but due to the recent upgrade of gcc and
the subsequent full rebuild of everything that does (and doesn't,
whoops!) get built with gcc, including java stuff with gcj, and the need
to further test package selection windows in Anaconda,
system-config-packages for upgrades, and the development tree in general
once we settle down the rebuilds, we have decided to delay test2.  Here
is a new schedule that we will be working toward:

* Test2 freeze date to 9 January
* Test2 release, 16 January
* Test3 freeze, 6 February
* Test3 release, 13 February
* Final absolute freeze, 6 March
* Release, 15 March

We are going to try very hard to have a stable(ish) tree suitable for
testing over the holidays, so that Test2 will be better for the slip and
keep us in line with getting Test3 and eventually the final release out
in the best shape possible.

Thank you all for your hard work in helping us develop the best
distribution we can!

In twisted pair Ethernet you have the same stacking limit as you would
with hubs, no more than three deep.  More than that you end up getting into
timing problems with packets not being able to get to the other end of the
wire.

The other problem is that it depends on the firmware of the switch as
to whether it will work correctly when attached to another switch.

With TP ethernet hubs, there were timing issues when you went over X
number of hubs deep.  AFAIK switches function as re-timing modules and
take care of this, but each switch has to keep a list of all the MAC
addresses on each port.  Smaller, consumer-class switches probably
have a hard time doing this.  Also, they often don't support spanning-
tree protocol, which is a frame routing protocol for switched networks.

So a mesh of li'l 4-port switches probably are gonna keep losing track
of where everything is, and might not handle that situation right.

Or maybe you just have a bad switch in there somewhere.

FreeGeek has some nice 12- and 24-port switches in the store.  I don't
know if they're fast enough, but flattening out your network might be
a nice thing for the computer users in your household.

I wanted to look at gconfig (in Debian 3.1), but was
informed that GTK was not installed. So I installed
packages to resolve these dependencies.

After that, Kylix, which had formerly been giving me
no trouble, refused to start, with the message:
"GLIBC_2.0 not defined." The standard workaround for
this is: "export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.20." Even so, a
couple of Kylix menus are grayed out.

I assume that it's a lot of trouble. Has anyone else
had an experience similar to this?

Incorrect, you do not have a stacking limit when it comes to switches.
 See the following link:
http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/5/5_4_3_rule.html

I would guess that it is either an issue with one of the switches or a
cabling issue.

Sounds like you have everything mapped out, so there should not be an
issue of cabling, but I would double check that you do not have any
"loops" in the network.  I would suggest makeing sure that all of the
switch firmware is up to date, Linksys is really good about posting
the latest firmware for all of there equipment.

(FYI...)
Spanning Tree has been seen as a frame routing protocol, but that was
not it's intention when it was created.  See the following link:
http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/s/spanning_tree_protocol.html

It is a link managment protocol, IMHO, spanning tree is to be used for
those who do not know how to setup a network.  I know of this one
individual who loved to create network loops and hated to run spanning
tree.  He would always whine about not being able to connect to
anything, once we would turn on spanning tree for him, everything was
fine.

What's better, win4lin or vmware?  I'm trying the vmware 5.5 workstation trial,
but admittedly I'm chafing at the sticker price.  $105.00 seems awfully high, 
although rebooting all the time is an awful pain.

I have a 20" Dell LCD at work, and it scales down decently enough. It
shows none of the nasty jagged font edges, etc. that older and cheaper
flat panels are subject to. I'd take Keith's advice: go to your
favorite retail outlet and test out as many subjects as possible.
You'd be surprised at how much the quality can vary.

I've been to those sites and have googled and have posted on Gentoo
forums. I'm not clear on how to set ALSA to simply pass through the
spdif port...

Subject: [PLUG] Old version of Maple, what can I do?
Message-ID: <1134796742.43a39fc630d57@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I have maple 9.02 for Linux which seems to work with Fedora Core 1 okay.

Well, I'm running Fedora Core 3 now.

I don't want to downgrade to an unsupported version of Fedora
just so I can use maple.

One thought, run Core 1 under vmware.  Expensive route and I'm worried 
that maple won't be able to render 3-D graphs.  After all, that's what 
I got it for.  Another route, upgrade my maple.  Thing is, Waterloo 
doesn't talk about Fedora Core compatibility and I know that 
Redhat Enterprise Linux is too expensive for me.  I'm also worried 
about what the upgrade will cost.

Is there a trick to get maple 9.02 to work on a Fedora Core 3 system?
Apparently, it uses something from the 2.4 series of kernels and
Redhat's pre Core 3 c++ libraries that doesn't exist anymore.  Of
course, I'm just guessing.  

What does maple cost these days?  Is there any possibility of trading 
my old maple in so I can get a newer version?

I don't want to run multiple computers.  Unfortunately, I may have to.
Rebooting just to use maple could wear out my laptop pretty quickly.  
I don't want to go there.

Anyone know how to test that it's working without actually going to a

With clamav, there's a test signature file.  After all, you wouldn't
want to use a virused file to verify that clamav is working if it 
isn't.

Why buy an APC unit if the batteries are proprietary?

Why not build your own off of standard car batteries that you
can pick up just about anywhere?

Does anyone know of a kit with all the needed circuitry pre done

I know that there is a work around documented on the web, just becuase
I am running Maple 8 on SuSE 9.3 (2.6 kernel) right now. 
Unfortunately I cannot remember what the fix is, but if I come aross
it, I will let you know.

Abbreviated STP, a link management protocol that is part of the IEEE

loops in a network that are created by multiple active paths between
stations. Loops occur when there are alternate routes between hosts. To
establish path redundancy, STP creates a tree that spans all of the
switches in an extended network, forcing redundant paths into a standby,
or blocked, state. STP allows only one active path at a time between any
two network devices (this prevents the loops) but establishes the
redundant links as a backup if the initial link should fail. If STP
costs change, or if one network segment in the STP becomes unreachable,
the spanning tree algorithm reconfigures the spanning tree topology and
reestablishes the link by activating the standby path. Without spanning
tree in place, it is possible that both connections may be
simultaneously live, which could result in an endless loop of traffic on
the LAN.

No... It turns out to be exactly the opposite..

SPT is for those who know how to set up a network..


Good luck

Keith,
I've got a similar net work at my place using NetGear 5-port switches.
My deepest run is 4 switches including an underground cable between
buildings of about 120 feet.  I've not had any problems running at 100Mbps.
For power out here in the country I have an automatic backup generator.
I did have a problem with flaky connectivity but I traced it to a bad port
on one of the switches and replaced the switch.  It's been clear sailing for
over a year now.

Are there limits on how many ethernet switches can be placed in series
and still work reliably?  I've run into an interesting problem, and
exceeding some limit might be the cause.

I have computers scattered throughout the house and my home office,
and rather than run big bundles of parallel cat5 everywhere, I tend
to run just a single run of cable then branch out with little ethernet
switch boxes (mostly Linksys 5 port and 8 port units).  From the 
firewall machine to the laptop cables in the kitchen and my wife's
office, there are typically 5 cat5 runs and 4 switches in series between
the firewall and a machine:  (1) Wifi AP/router (2) downstairs switch
(3) upstairs switch (4) room switch.  

(And to anticipate an irrelevant suggestion, no I don't normally leave
the laptops on wifi - the bandwidth is too low for nightly backups, and
it is more secure to send most packets down wires)

Well, the power has been glitching the last few days because of the
wind and the furnace coming on.  About once or twice a day, the upstairs
computers go incommunicado, not talking to each other or to downstairs
and the firewall.  The machines downstairs keep talking to each other
and the net.  I can make the problem go away by power cycling the 
upstairs switches.  About 3 weeks ago I added a new ( brand X ) switch
in a room, but otherwise this setup has worked seemlessly for the last
year or so.

This may be due to a bad switch (either failing or poorly designed),
or it may be that I have exceeded some specification for number of
switches in series (perhaps they get confused when stacked this deep).
Or it might be something else.  Ideas?

Keith

That sounds sketchy to me. I'm a do-it-yourselfer at heart, but I would
not home-roll a UPS system. APC makes an excellent 750w for ~$150.00.
I'm not concerned at all that the battery is proprietary. If it's made
right, it will last a few years. At least now they make them so you can
replace them easily. Four years ago, you would have had to take apart
the APC in order to exchange the battery. 

I would not recommend a do-it-yourself UPS unless you really hate your
hardware.

It's on Canyon, a block west of Cedar Hills Blvd -- and right across 
the street from Super Bowl Teriyaki, home of the extraordinarily 
reasonable $3.99 chicken teriyaki plate. :-)

Kylix is becoming deprecated. An application that
allows one to build Kylix applications on WINDOWS,
CrossKylix, is now available, and I may try it. Must
have Delphi.

Borland is now pushing C++Builder X. That is what I am
downloading now, and it has a native Linux version.

I'm trying to get three LCD monitors working together.

The computer is a Compaq Evo somethingorother with a built in Intel 845g
graphics card and a Matrox Millennium G450 DualHead card.

When the system boots up everything goes to the monitor connected to the
845g card.  When X starts then I get dual-head working on the two monitors
connected to the G450, but the monitor on the 845g goes black.  I'm running
xorg 6.8.2 on Fedora Core 4.

lspci shows my graphics cards at:
     00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation
82845G/GL[Brookdale-G]/GE Chipset Integrated Graphics Device (rev 01)
     06:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Matrox Graphics, Inc. G400/G450 (rev

In /var/log/Xorg.0.log, I get:

Really? See below.

Seems like that should be "PCI:0:02:0", to match the error message, and lspci.
Other than that, are you certain the i810 is the right driver? (if
not, perhaps try something simpler, like svga just for troubleshooting
purposes.)

Sorry, the xorg.conf I pasted in was from my testing.  The BusID entry
should have been "PCI:0:2:0", which doesn't work either.

Sorta.  It's on Canyon *and* Beaverdam, between Cedar Hills and Short
(though Short Ave between Canyon and Beaverdam is kind of hard to miss,
being the world's shortest street block, 6 feet).

After I recycled an old (very old) UPS I found out that Battery 
Exchange on TV Hwy in Beaverton carries UPS batteries.  If you're 
shopping (I missed the original posting) for a UPS, why not check on 
replacement battery availability and cost as part of the purchase

a printer.

I hate Gnome... it sucks, IMHO.

I dislike KDE nearly as much.

I don't run Gnome - and I find Firefox not only looks good to me, but it
runs at a decent speed, too!  :-)

Set up the script so it emails you her IP... she calls, says "Son, I
need help!"

You reply, "Okay, ma, hang up, connect to the 'net, and double-click the
'HELP ME!!' icon on your desktop"

...which emails you her IP.  (and maybe opens up SSH in case you don't
want to leave it open all the time)

My money would be on a switch dying.

You can stack switches many many levels deep - the collision domains are
essentially irrelevant with switches (unlike hubs).

I've had switches and other cheapo network hardware dye with power
fluctuations... requiring a bounce.  Swap the things out, see if it
still happens.  Invest in a spare switch, perhaps.  Test the cable, of
course.

As Jeff mentioned, are you sure you have no network loops?  Cheapo
switches may not handle such things gracefully.

That will be the way to go, assuming I can trick her into switching from 
Win98 to Linux. She's already using Thunderbird, but on her 333 MHz 
Pentium, her favorite games will take a long time to load under Wine -- 
at least based on my experience trying those games with an ~500 MHz machine.

The issue was timing, but not so much a timeout issue.  Hubs are layer 1
network devices.  Switches are layer 2.  Hubs just look at the ones and
zeros, sending them back out to each cable plugged in to them.  Switches
look at the frame's destination and send the frames to the right port.

To avoid network collisions (where two computers attempt to communicate
at once, effectively rendering the information they wanted to send
useless), you could only stack things a few switches deep.  Before
somebody on one end of the network was done sending, there had to be
time for somebody's frame on the other end of the network to start and
get to the first computer.  This way the first computer could jam his
packet, realizing somebody else was using the wire at the same time.
Hubs essentially treated the entire network like a party line - only one
person could talk at a time.  If somebody else started talking, you had
to say "whoops!  I'll try later" and cancel whatever information you
were trying to get out.

With switches, the problem doesn't exist.  Each port on a switch is its
own collision domain.  The switch doesn't just send information it
receives out to everybody, it just sends it to the people who need it.
They're also generally full-duplex, meaning two people can talk at once,
anyway....

  - tail the logs

  - In it's default install DG is quite strict.  Try to do an images 
search on Google with Google's filtering disabled.  DG won't let you.

DG does have test files as well, but the above should get you going.

A poor man's UPS could be built using:

One 12VDC power supply, probably 25 Amp capacity would be acceptable.  This
would not be cheap for a new unit, but if you are hunting for surplus or
will build your own, you might get by without spending a fortune.

One 12V sealed or controlled venting battery.  It would not be good to run a
standard car battery, since they vent hydrogen gas and acid vapor, neither
of which are great to have wafting around your computer room.  You can
usually get a 36AH gel cell for around $50 if you look around.  That size
battery would give you close to an hour and a half of operation, assuming
one computer at less than 300 Watts of load.  If you go with a smaller
battery, just make sure it can source 25 or 30 Amps to operate the inverter
at load (assuming one or maybe two computers).

One 300 to 500 Watt power inverter.  Computer power supplies are pretty
forgiving as to the source of AC power since they are chopping it up anyway.
As a result, you can probably use a simple "quasi-AC" inverter, many of
which go on sale for $50 or so, especially in the automotive market, like GI
Joe's.

Since this is the simple approach, the system would be on-line all the time,
which leads to the requirement for the power supply to be able to provide
the large amount of power to operate the computer system as long as you have
AC power.  If you want to get slightly tricky, you could experiment with an
AC-powered relay, that you would wire so that the computer is connected to
the commercial AC power as long as there is power.  When the relay coil is
deenergized, the contacts would swing you over to the output of the
inverter, which is already sitting idle ready to go.  This would do two
things: one is it would reduce the average load on the inverter, extending
it's useful life.  The other thing is that the power supply could be
replaced with a simple float charger for the battery, which would only have
to maintain the battery and keep the inverter powered on in the idle state.
I have not made any measurements, but a 1 Amp source would probably be
plenty.  Of course, for this to work, your computer would have to be able to
sustain itself during the momentary interruption of power while the relay
swings over to the inverter.  Because this approach has a pretty attractive
cost benefit, due to eliminating the huge power supply required for an
on-line system, the experiment would be worth a try.  I would be surprised
if it didn't work just great.

If you delve into this, remember the DC side of things runs pretty high
current (25 to 30 Amps), so you should be running 10 gauge wire or so.  The
AC side is peanuts at 2 or 3 amps.

If it were me, I would do this in a heartbeat.  I currently have a small
off-the-shelf UPS that is hooked up all the time, but I also have 750AH of
batteries under my desk that are always kept at float voltage with a small
2A supply.  When I decide to watch TV during a power outage, I just plug in
the inverter and get about 30 hours of operation.  I just haven't bothered
to make it permanent.  Of course, if you wire something up and it makes big
sparks, I didn't tell you to do it.................

Just some thoughts,
Brian.

After I recycled an old (very old) UPS I found out that Battery

Probably not - I haven't changed that wiring downstairs in over a year, which is
the only place there are enough cables to get confused by.  Also, the symptoms
only occur upstairs, where there are single cable runs only.

I like the "cheap piece of garbage that can't handle power glitches" ethernet
switch box theory.  I purchased this switch at a weird little computer store
near Seattle (and M$) when I needed to do some testing up there, and I guess
the bad vibes from Bellevue just followed it home, where they festered on a
shelf until I installed it in one room a couple weeks ago.  

Actually, this is probably an opportunity to buy a firewall switch, for
reasons I will outline in another message.

How is that?  If you purposely create loops (for redundant purposes),
then you would want to use STP as your LAST choice for a redundance
protocol.  CDP, or EDP are two examples of protocols which respond
faster to fail over and have more capabilities than STP.  STP (not
SPT) was derived from the early version of Cisco's CDP.  In addition,
there are other 802.3ad (port aggregation) which will do mutliple
links between two network devices and can handle if one port goes
down.

Most of the users that I have seen who use STP, use it because they
have an issue with plugging two network devices (i.e. switches)
mutliple times and they do not understand why they are getting
broadcast storms, so they enable STP and the problem goes away.

(you said you changed this, right?)

This line shouldn't be here:

>? ? ? ? VideoRam ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?32768
>EndSection

Inside the "Device" section, "Screen" means which port on the 
multi-headed video card to use.  In the case of your i810, it might be 
having trouble finding the third port (but I would think it should be 
ignoring that.)

If that doesn't do it, maybe post the whole config again as it currently 
stands.  It's tough enough to debug this stuff via e-mail without 
having to keep track of a bunch of little mental patches :-)

CDP

The Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is a protocol for discovering devices
on a network. Each CDP-compatible device sends periodic messages to a
well-known multicast address. Devices discover each other by listening
at that address.


CDP is not to control redundant paths...

It you want traffic to go through you give it redundant paths..  Good
design..   Then you need a protocol to manage those paths..  That would
be STP...


My option and I am sticking with it...

No, CDP doesn't do that.

Heh, negative. STP is used on every large L2 network; normally one 
spanning-tree instance per vlan (so it doesn't blindly disable an entire 
trunk)..

No, but it does half of what STP does... if you look at the message you
quoted, you'll notice Jeff stated STP was based on CDP, not that it
/was/ CDP.

Do you know how STP works, though?  It's not exactly ideal for any kind
of a high-availability setup, which is the kind of setup one would be
most likely to want to implement something like STP on.

So, STP is neat and all... and useful in many situations, but if you
know what you're doing when you're designing the network (and you wish
to design it correctly) you aren't going to use STP.

Ok, let me clarify.  STP is fine to use in certain situations.  If I
had a small network, and performance is an issue, then I would not use
STP.  In large corporations, where up-time and connectivity is vital,
then STP is a great thing.

I tired to find the documentation that Cisco would provide to setting
up a L2 mesh network, where they would suggest using CDP and ISL
rather than STP, but unfortunately the old link I have is no longer
valid.  I do admit that when you are in a large corporation, you
usually have a variety of network devices, so the only way to get all
of the devices to work in a mesh topology would be to use STP.  But if
you have a network with all one type of equipment (i.e. Extreme
Networks) then using EDP (Extreme Discovery Protocol) or similar
protocol have been proven to have a faster response time.

Looking back at the "original" problem, a very small network, which
has <20 computers that is having problems with connectivity.  The
switches are "inexpensive" which probably means that they are
un-managed which also means that they do not support STP.

My opinions come from having tested and supported (3Com, Cisco, Intel,
Extreme, D-Link, HP, Foundry) L2/L3 switches.  When you need the best
possible performance, then you will find STP will hurt your latency. 
STP is fine, if latency and performance is not an issue.

You need to contact Cisco and tell them..

They use it ALL over..

But, apparently you have better ideas..

So I suggest you contact them (Cisco) right away and give them the
benefit of your wisdom


Good Luck

1. What flavor of RHEL is supported? CentOS is pretty much 
plug-compatible with RHEL; Maple should run on it. You'll be further 
back on things like KDE/Gnome, OpenOffice, Evolution and Firefox than 
you would be with Fedora, but everything there works.

2. How locked in to Maple are you? There are open source symbolic math 
packages. I've got both Maxima and Axiom running on my Linux boxes. I 
build them from source, but there are RPMs available. There are some 
other "lighter-weight" symbolic packages, but those two are "industrial 
strength".

3. There are *oodles* of ways to render 3-D graphs besides a symbolic 
math package like Maple. I'm partial to R, but there are plenty of others.

Impressive.  My network is only connected by 0 servers.  Think he uses

Ward Cunningham, founder of the Wiki.

. The Oregonian article covers the collaborative nature of Wikis.

. But equally profound, is the Wiki markup language, which enables
  mere mortals to easily "PUBLISH" their knowledge on the web,
  in an understandable format, without geeky html.

. It would be even more profound to enable non-techies to write
  "PROGRAMS" -- analogous to the early spreadsheet revolution.

Adding the `f' did cause the other two recipes to be considered after
the first was applied.  Thanks for that; however, the results are
still not what I was hoping for.  After telling procmail that the
first recipe is a filter, the log entries it produces are like this
one:

procmail: [17988] Tue Dec 20 00:56:06 2005
procmail: Match on "^Content-Type: multipart.*"
procmail: Executing "mkdir,-p,/tmp/2005-12-20-00-56-procmail-17988"
procmail: Assigning "LASTFOLDER=mkdir -p /tmp/2005-12-20-00-56-procmail-17988"

  Folder: mkdir -p /tmp/2005-12-20-00-56-procmail-17988                    5312

procmail: Executing "munpack -t -C $TMPDIR && \
lynx -dump -force_html $TMPDIR/part2 | \

However, if I delete the file `other', touch it, list it and see that
it is a zero byte file, run my test script that executes procmail with
the given recipes, and list the file `other' again, it is still zero
bytes.  If I run the command

munpack -t -C $TMPDIR < ~/misc/procmail/foo at yahoo.com.txt && \
lynx -dump -force_html $TMPDIR/part2 | \
cat -s

The output to the screen is a beautiful text message :/

Perhaps I'll do this, but then I have to remember to transport the
script too if I need/want to use the recipes on a different box.

I don't have mktemp available to me on Solaris where I do some of my
work.  I try to use stuff in Linux that will be portable to that OS
too in case I need to use it there too.  (Of course I can't always do
this, but I try when I can.)  However, I did switch the declaration of
`TMPDIR' to this:

TMPDIR=/tmp/`date +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M`-procmail-$$

I'm not sure if that is safer because I don't understand how naming a
file `/tmp/procmail-1234' could lead to a denial of service.  (I'm
sure it could, but I just don't understnad how.)

It certainly did.  Thanks, Steve.

Heh!  Procmail was outputting its results to `~/other' rather than
`other' in the directory where I was testing my recipes.

Your `f' flag was the solution after all, Steve!  Thanks a million.

Hey, don't laugh.  We've got STP running on our neighborhood-wide
bridged wireless network in North Portland.  Not sure it is necessary
in the current configuration, though it would be if we create
redundant point-to-point links.

I wired up a battery, inverter and built a little box with a 3PDT relay 
with a 120vac coil. The power line holds the rely in. When line fails, 
relay drops out and transfers load to inverter. The inverter is started by 
the 3rd set of contacts on the relay being wired across the power switch in 
the inverter. Worked OK for a video projector to protect lamp from power 
failure. Don't know if transfer is fast enough for a computer.

A float charger will also be required. It must be able to fully charge the 
batery(s) in a reasonable period of time, say one day. 200 a-hr/24 hr = 8.3 
amp MIN. B aware that many cheap chargers won't really put out their rated 
current except to a dead battery. Also the end of charge should go to 14.x 
volts, hold for a while the drop to float at 13.x volts. I got a 12V 10A 
switching supply from Frys (before they quit carrying them) and found that 
the adjustment went to above 13V (don't recall if I tried to get 14+V)

I will probably do a PCB with real electronics on it for a fast transfer 
and well defined line voltage limits. May even put it in a box with a 13.6V 
power supply.

My motive for NOT using a commerical UPS here is a desire for a big battery 
- I have two in parallel adding up to around 200 amp-hours.

There are two problems putting a big and therefore external battery in a 
commerical UPS:
1. The two that I looked at had the battery connected to one side of the 
power line - not good for an external battery.
2. Concern that an extended run time may overheat a unit not designed for 
long run at full power.

You're just spewing buzzwords. CDP is unrelated. ISL is an L2 trunking 
protocol, cisco's alternative to 802.1q. Also, UNRELATED.

If I (a different user on your system) do the following:

  for i in $(seq 1 $((2 ** 15))) ; do mkdir /tmp/procmail.${i} ; done

I can effectively prevent your script from ever being able to run.

Depending on how munpack handles existing symlinks and existing files,
I -might- be able to craft a symlink from part1 or part2 in one of the
directories I created that points to your ${HOME}/.ssh/authorized_keys,
and then send you a funnily crafted mime email which happens to have
an ssh public key in it, which munpack, if it followed the symlink,
would place neatly in your authorized_keys file.

And, depending on your umask, you may also be needlessly exposing your
mime-encoded email to others. Generally, creating and using a tmp/
directory in your home directory is probably a good idea, though you may
pay a tradeoff in speed if you're using one of the ram based fs'es --
in that case, creating /tmp/${USERNAME}/, and using that as the root of
your temporary tree would work, too.

Starting with <I believe> 2900 series switches Cisco no longer uses ISL.
They use 802.1q.

Subject: [PLUG] OT: After effects of Accessibility Wizard in Win98
Message-ID: <43A84877.9020607@comcast.net>

(I've asked this question on a Windows Forum, but so far have had no 
response. Knowing that some of you work with both tools, I'm hoping to 
find a pointer to a solution. Feel free to respond off-list, since this 
has nothing to do with Linux.)

Has anyone fiddled with the Win98SE Accessibility Wizard? As part of the 
research into how to improve my mother-in-law's computer experience, I 
tried some changes on my Win98 machine. When I finished, I pushed a 
button to "restore defaults," or words to that effect. Now, on some 
programs, the font used for menus is Times New Roman, instead of Arial, 
and in others, the appearance of 12pt Arial, Bold, (not the font 0Arial 
Bold), looks like it is no longer anti-aliased.

Since this is not limited to a single program, I'm assuming it's a 
system setting, but have had no success finding some tool to change it.

What's odd is that the effect on menus is not universal. It happens in 
Thunderbird, but not in Windows Explorer, or Word Perfect. Also, the 
non-anti-aliased 12pt Arial, Bold is not universal. It looks fine in 
Word Perfect, but not in another program I use.

I'm pretty sure the problem I'm having is because the little ethernet
switch I am using is a POFS.  Since the problem space is morphing a little
bit, this may actually be an opportunity to test out more appropriate gear.

New subject:

The situation is this:  my wife is a doctor, uses Linux at home, and works
at a clinic that is still laden with zillions of paper folders containing
paper charts.  One of my missions is to set up an "Electronic Health Record"
replacement for her clinic.  Political and legal and interpersonal issues
aside, there is the thorny issue of data security and patient privacy.  

There is some nifty open source software out there for EHR and practice
management.  I am looking at one package called OSCAR, from McMaster 
University. OSCAR is being used in clinics across Canada, with a concentration
in BC (see the "BC billing" demo at http://www.oscarmcmaster.org/demos ). 
There is also a consultant in Missouri maintaining a US variant.  The
software is web and java based, with a Tomcat/MySQL back end. 

My first thought was that we could run all this on my wife's office PC 
(Linux of course) for her use only, and remove power from the USB hard
drive containing the patient database when the ethernet switch between her
and the internet is powered up.  One or the other, never both at once.

However, since OSCAR is a complete practice management system, with billing
and scheduling and connection to external pharmacy databases and such, 75%
of the usefulness comes from connecting OSCAR to the net and to the database
simultaneously.  So now I am thinking of allowing all the computers in the
office to get HTTPS access to the OSCAR database, and integrating OSCAR into
their practice.  The security job just got harder, and HIPPA is now involved.

The clinic is in one of the Physician Office Buildings managed by Legacy
Good Samaritan Hospital, and LGSH does physical maintenance of the wires and
the network to all the computers in the clinic.  LGSH is NATted and firewalled,
and the clinic lives inside firewall cloud of the whole hospital system.  The
clinic runs a half dozen PCs using windoze XP.  They don't seem to run much
specialized software on these PCs, though, so they are not deeply invested
in M$. The LGSH security is good enough that there have not been any virus
infections for the last few years.  I need to learn more about the details.  

Still with me?  The expansive solution I envision in the short term is her
Linux box acting as an OSCAR server for the office, behind a commercial firewall
appliance that permits inbound HTTPS access from the six clinic computers,
and nothing else inbound.  Outbound, she will have http/https/ping, and I
will be driving an SSH tunnel through my public server to my inside server,
allowing her access from home and connecting her home email account to her
work machine - maybe.  That should be reasonably secure, though someone really
nefarious and persistent could break through the LGSH firewall, zombie one
of the XP computers, then use that to crack OSCAR.  Or break through my three
firewalls.  I suspect it would be easier to subvert one of the staff, though,
and that can happen just as easily with the current paper charts.

During the discussion of Rich's travails using an "all-in-one" firewall switch,
I suggested he use an old laptop as a firewall.  This is a good solution where
there is a Linux guru handy, but it probably is not suitable for a clinic
without a propellerhead in sight.  So, we need an appliance that can do the
firewall, pass ssh packets, and keep an eye on things.  While there isn't a
large pile of money to burn, we probably should buy something better than a
$59 Fry's brand-X special, though not some top-of-the-line $5000 Cisco product.

So a question ---------------------------------------------------------
  Can somebody suggest a reliable, secure, easy-to-use firewall appliance
  that does the simple job above, and they have had good luck with?
And another question --------------------------------------------------
  Are there better alternatives to the security concerns than the vision
  outlined above?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a lot of risk - EHR permits data mining by litigious attorneys, which
is one reason why this excellent patient-protective technology isn't more
widespread in the US.  On the other hand, if the EHR system is maintained
by a bunch of little Linux consultancies, there are fewer targets worth
being sued by the big law firms.

The upside is pretty good.  The clinic is not completely software ignorant - they
were founded by a doctor who later went on to start a medical informatics company.  
My wife's partner is one of the principle doctors at LGSH, and if the whole clinic
converts over to Linux in the mid term, and if OSCAR looks good, this could spread
like crazy around the Legacy system, and in clinics in the Portland area and
elsewhere.  There are also a number of medical informatics experts in the area,
including Tom Clark of Tualatin, who regularly participates in open source ESR
conferences in Europe.  Perhaps we can even come up with some "will code for cheap
healthcare" system for some of the local open source unemployables, though I
wouldn't bet the farm on that, because of clinic economic and liability issues.

Alas no, there is no big money in it.  Rich doctors are impersonated by rich actors
in rich Hollywood.  In Real Life (tm) most clinic doctors work incredible hours
at high personal risk for meager personal incomes, and do it because they hate
suffering and want to heal your sorry asses.  An EHR system will reduce suffering, 
increase personal risk, involve all sorts of bureaucratic HIPPA compliance
nightmares, and have a small negative economic effect.  Definitely a mixed bag.

Anyone who wants to talk about this stuff, or who has connections with other
clinics and would like to help me evaluate alternatives, let me know.  People with
good diplomatic skills suitable for imperious doctors and cautious hospital
IT departments are welcome to participate.

I'm pretty sure it's not an SMTP problem or anything like that.
My sendmail config is pretty simple, and host alerts are working
just fine. I think I'm going to set up a separate Nagios (with
a stripped down config) to experiment with this. And I'll turn
on all the logging I can find (I'm not seeing any indication that
it's trying to send alerts for the services.)

I'm running nagios-2.0b1. Do you know if much has changed since
then?

The low-end Cisco PIX-501 devices

* are fairly secure
* have fairly sane defaults
* make VPN access for Windows and OS X hosts fairly simple
* are quite configurable
* can be administered via a CLI, a web-based Java applet, or SNMP
   (though I don't recommend the latter :-)
* are quiet and unobtrusive
* have some application-layer protections beyond simple packet
   filtering
* can export configuration file via tftp, easing disaster recovery
* are supported by a myriad of Cisco admins, so the clinic would
   be able to find support should you meet an untimely demise

Plus, I have a feeling that you'd stand a pretty good chance of 
fending off a HIPAA legal challenge if you can show that you're using 
up-to-date Cisco gear. I imagine that a court or arbitrator would see 
Cisco as industry standard. (Obviously, I'm no lawyer, but I'm trying 
to think like one for the sake of argument.)

Froogle shows the 501 model running about $400 for a 10-user license 
and $550 for a 50-user license.

The downside, of course, is that you're dealing with proprietary 
software. There are also a lot of fairly's in my bullet list, 
indicating value judgements on my part; you'll need to judge those 
items for yourself.

It seems like the API for the 2.0 series has been pretty stable; 
changes between the 2.0 beta releases appear to be limited to bug 
fixes.

2900/3500's can still do it.. but that wasn't the point. I was just 
saying, that it's completely unrelated to spanning-tree :)

Agree.....

And I was just pointing out that Cisco is not using their properity
software and using open source  802.1q..

We use 2950's here and you CAN'T run ISL on these.. Must be 802.1q

Removing the BusID and Screen entries solved it.  I'm now in triple LCD
bliss.  Thank you to everyone that helped.  I'll attach my xorg.conf below,
but first another question.  :-D  Is there a way to make the mouse
automatically jump to the center of a particular display?  Right now it
takes a lot of mouse moving to get from one side to the other.  Maybe
there's even a device that will track which display my head is pointing at
and move the mouse there automatically.  :-D  If I want to add 2 or 3 more
LCDs then my wrist isn't going to scale well...  ;-)

Well, I'd reccomend going with a square config once you have 4 :)

This isn't an answer either.. but your question reminded me of a
feature I've been wanting to try, but have never seen.  I would like
to have the size of the mouse cursor increase as a function of it's
speed.  Put another way, I think it would be easier to keep track of
the mouse if its speed in terms of its size was constant.  Has anyone
tried or seen such a creation?

There used to be a mouse cursor feature that would create trails of
mice.  This was in Win3.1 even.  As you moved your mouse quickly you 
could see a group of pointes from old position to new position.
Otherwise on early laptop screens it was easy to get the mouse cursor to
disappear.

Oh, right.  I had forgotten about mouse trails.  For some reason they
drove me mad ;) but I may have to look into them again.  For some
reason, I think a cursor that meerly swelled and shrank with speed
would bother me less, particularly if it were semi-translucent.

I'm no graphics expert, but isn't a mouse normally treated like some little
pixel map, with some kind of backing store in software or hardware for the
stuff it goes over?  I suspect if you changed mouse size or left mouse 
trails, you would be asking X to do a lot more work (computationally 
intensive, opportunities for rendering errors).  However, I like the
idea of increasing the visibility of the cursor when it moves;  I wonder
what you could do that would be most obvious with the fewest pixels
disturbed?  I would guess some kind of swirling black and white pattern
that fills the whole bounding box of the pixel, and gets more annoying
as under the conditions making the pixel hard to find - high speed short
moves or lower speed long ones.  

This sounds like an excellent senior project for a CS student working
with a psych or art student. 

---

A question closer to the original subject of multiple screens - with my
single screen, I have multiple virtual windows, which I select from the
panel (gnome, at the bottom, in my case).  How does one represent multiple
virtual windows with multiple screens?  A distinct panel for each, with
independent virtual window representations?  A proper "move the mouse to
screen N" trick would be an extension of this.

With xinerama enabled, it acts almost exactly as if you had one really
large desktop.  On my home setup, each virtual desktop is 3200x1200
pixels.  With edge flipping enabled, they flip when the mouse hits the
*far* edges of the screen(s).  Imagine cutting your current monitor in
half and putting a tongue of plastic down the middle -- if you could
do that with out preventing your screen from functioning, you would
experience xinerama. (almost.. most window managers know that when you
maximize an app to only fill one monitor, rather than spanning all
your physical screens.)

With out xinerama, there are a number of things you can do, but the
only one I've tried is to run a separate x session on each monitor. 
In that case, the mouse moves from one to the other, (and the keyboard
focus follows, at least by default).  Each head also runs it's own
window manager, etc.. as a result, you can't drag windows between
monitors as you can with xinerama.

I still can't seem to make any progress on the notifications
for services. One specific thing I realize I'm unclear on is
"active" vs "passive" checks. What my original configuration
was doing (which I *think* was the default) was active and
passive checks on services, and only passive checks on hosts.

After reading the documentation I'm confused about this.
I *think* all my checks are "originated" by Nagios (though
they are carried out by plug-ins.) It seems like all the
checks I want would be "active."  However, it doesn't appear
to make any difference when I change the config to use
all active checks. In fact, when I configure hosts to have
only active checks, BOTH active and passive checks show up
as "No" when I look at the running config via the web page.
So it would seem that there would be NO checks running.
But it doesn't appear to affect the operation at all.

BTW, if anyone is motivated to take a look at my config
either by viewing the web page or ssh, lemme know. I'd be
more then happy to buy beers at the Lucky Lab for anyone
who could help me figure this out. It's *probably* just
some simple thing I've overlooked or don't understand.

i'm looking for timesheet software (preferrably web-based) that would allow
a small group (<30) to track their time spent on individual projects. on the
backend it would be nice to either use canned reports for summary hours or
be able to export to csv or some other simple format for importing into
another management package. it would also be great if it could export weekly
hours to send to a payroll service.

engineering consultants and lawyers would have very similar needs for what i
am looking for. anyone out there know of a package (open-source or not) that
would handle these requirements? thanks in advance.

doesn't recognize my wireless card (Dell Wireless WLAN 1350 WLAN Mini-P).
Ubuntu accesses the Internet just fine with an Ethernet cable. Windows
recognizes and uses the Dell Wireless card.

Google points me to a description of this problem which others have
experienced. http://thefinleys.com/dell_d810/ The fix described there
involves ndiswrapper and a BIOS change for  my Dell.

This seems a lot to do for "Linux for human beings." Has anyone else come

This isn't a critical issue, but still anoying.  If I kill X11 and then 
try to restart it nothing happens, the screen just goes blank.  If I 
reboot the computer X starts up fine.

Has this happened to anyone here?

I have checked the logs for X and they look no different from when it 
works.  I am using enlightenment from cvs and thought that might be the 
issue but the same problem happens when using X11's default window 
manager twm.

I am using an Intel 845GRG board with integrated video and gentoo with 
the latest stable release of xorg-x11.

You might want to compare the output of lsmod before running it
successfully and after exiting from the working session.  It might
point to something.

Ubuntu didn't recognize the Broadcom wifi in my Compaq AMD64 
laptop either. I finally got it working with ndiswrapper, although it 
took a LOT of help from experienced Linux people. Then I upgraded 
from Hoary to Breezy and it broke again. After I fixed it I made a 
writeup about it on the R3000 wiki. I did so mostly for myself, so 
that next time I upgrade Ubuntu and it breaks the wifi I will know 
where I saved the instructions. :)

It can't be any modules because the only module(s) loaded is for the

Yes, anyone with a Broadcom wireless NIC who wants to run Linux has
run across this problem.  You can a) use ndiswrapper with the Windows
driver as suggested, b) complain to Broadcom/Dell/etc. that they don't
support Linux, or c) support the open-source reverse-engineered
bcm43xx project, which is not likely to provide you with a working
driver for quite a while.

That's life when a hardware vendor refuse to release specifications
and/or drivers.

A number of wireless card makers haven't released the specs for their
products (broadcom  is somewhat notorious for this.. I have a thinkpad
partially because you can't get linux to use the wireless on an iBook
G4).  I'm no expert on ndiswrapper, but as I understand it, it is
essentially a windows emulator for wireless drivers, so you can use
the closed-source drivers with a linux kernel.  I haven't bothered,
because the bother didn't seem worth the savings over an intel / cisco
wireless card.

FWIW, ndiswrapper is *probably* your only choice, short of reverse
engineering the driver, but don't quote me on that :)  You could also
look at usb wifi dongles, or pcmcia cards if you want wifi with a
different type of hassle.

ndiswrapper is not worth the trouble.  Go buy a USB wifi adapter
(after researching for driver support); I think mine is this one:

http://netgear.com/products/details/WPN111.php

I plugged it into Warty and it worked like a charm with zero extra
configuration.  Should work no problem with Breezy, I assume.

I did it partly because I am totally new to Linux and figured it would 
be a good learning experience.

It was. I learned a whale of a lot. Sometimes the education is worth 
the time and frustration.

Message-ID: <op.s17zutq8v05gle@jasitpjd>

Brought home a Debian machine from Free Geek a few weeks ago, and it ran  
fine; I've been using it to learn Linux. While getting one of the  
recommended apt-gets, I think I wound up downloading a replacement kernel  
- I'm unclear about exactly what happened. But on the reboot, things went  
downhill rapidly; it seemed to reboot partially with some apps corrupted,  
and then wouldn't come back up at all. I've tried installing a couple of  
new OS (another Debian and Ubuntu) but the install always fails partway  
through.

I have briefly spotted, flashing by, a message indicating damage to the  
BIOS - on some occasions, not on others. The BIOS is accessible as usual,  
though, and *looks* normal. I've made adjustments in it (boot order  
mainly) which seem to stick. But I'm not sure if that means anything.

I also have seen at the beginning of a boot, "primary hard disk drive  
failure," though the BIOS seems to read the hard drive OK and the install  
goes on at least partway.

My question: How extensive does the problem seem to be, or how do I  
determine that? In other words, are these symptoms indicators that the  
motherboard is shot, or the hard drive, or both, or possibly that neither  
is, but that some other corrective measure would/might solve the problem  
and allow me to install an OS? Or should I just recycle the box and get a  
new one?

As far as I know, that means that the hard drive isn't working. Check to be 
sure the cables to it are firmly plugged in and also where the wide cable 
goes in to the mother board. If that doesn't work, try moving the hard 
drive cable, where it goes on the the motherboard, to the other IDE 
connector (may require a change in boot order).

BTW, the bios doesn't rely on the hard drive to run. I would guess that the 
install is running from CD just fine then stalls when it tries to use the 
hard drive for the first time.

If you do need a new hard drive, I think I got one from Free Geek for $10. 
New ones at Fry's aren't too far away from $50 on sale (beware of big hard 
drives with old motherboards).

Thanks

   Some days ago I accidently clicked the trackball while the pointer was
where it should not be. The Firefox history window changed from a tree
structure (showing the current day at the top and past days below) to a list
of unconnected page names with a silly page icon to the left.

   I've looked at every menu -- including all the corners of the
Edit->Preferences that I could find -- and cannot see where to change the
display back to a multi-day, collapseable/expandable tree structure.

   As trivial as this is, I'd like to change it back and I'm hoping that some
one of you knows how.

Thanks,

Rich

I wonder if there are stats on Linux usage by country as a percentage of
population or maybe Linux-related spending as a percentage of all IT
spending.

I was in a bookstore in Nurnberg a couple days ago and counted 12 unique
magazines with 'Linux' in the name of the magazine. In France I saw 5
magazines about Linux, with a lot of depth in the ones I picked and
struggled with (I speak almost no French).

How many Linux magazines are there in the US?

I recently got an ASUS A8N5X MB and an Athlon 64X2 3800; I like it, it's
quite fast (at least compared to my old Athlon 1700), and seems quite
stable so far.  No weird hardware on the motherboard, sound, ethernet,
and sata were recognized by linux.  Be aware that this MB uses PCI-X so
you'll have to get a new video card too, and a new power supply since
it's got a 24 pin + 4 pin connector; your thunderbird probably just has
a 22 (or is it 20) pin + 4 pin connector.

Good luck!

Kurt,

   Welcome back from your trip. It's too bad you missed the only interesting
winter weather, but there's always next month.

   The only two linux magazines I've seen are Linux Journal and one called (I
think) Linux Magazine. Looked at the latter once or twice.

   What significance do you ascribe to more titles in Europe than the US? More
people using linux over there? Higher on-line connection fees so more
information from a printed magazine is preferred? Better marketing by the
publishers?

   How do the various titles differentiate themselves? What seems to be the
focus of their editorial policies?

You mean PCI Express?  PCI-X is something else.  I've never heard of a
PCI-X video card, though I suppose they do exist.

Would have to be PCIe ("PCI Express") seeing how nVIDIA has never made a
PCI-X chipset (the 'N' in A8N5X). Please don't confuse terms, "PCI-X"
specifically refers to 64-bit wide PCI with >100MHz clocks and the extra
edge connector. Looks like "PCIe" is the incoming abreviation for PCI
Express.

I don't know whether they reached into the >100MHz category, but 3Dlabs
did make chips for 64-bit, 66MHz PCI. I saw them in reference to Sun
hardware. Quite likely 3Dlabs did make it into the >100MHz/PCI-X
category, though I haven't seen explicit mention of it.

Subject: [PLUG] Beware of silent failures in postfix
Message-ID: <20051226054226.GA1365@gate.kl-ic.com>


I have been fixing up postfix on my incoming mail server to filter
more spam.  Some options did not seem to work - it turns out there
were some typos in the main.cf file.  I learned that postfix does
not check for typos;  if you misname an option, it will parse it
and ignore it.  The one that caught me was the mispelling:

   smtp_recipient_restrictions =

Which should be:

   smtpd_recipient_restrictions =

If you have problems with postfix, or it does not seem to be
implementing an option you put in the main.cf file, this is 
something to check.

I encountered this while adding postgrey as one of the final
bricks in the wall (since it stops so much stuff, you need to leave
it off while implementing the other filters). 

 --- and wandering off on a tangent ...

The last brick in the wall is a high MX spam trap, like Randal talked
about a few months ago.  I hope to do that by using the postgrey
mechanism and database.  Postgrey starts its timer and permits mail
to pass 300 (default) seconds after the previous attempt to send email.
Persistent servers get through, and then get whitelisted.  My plan is
to "postdate" a high-MX entry sent to the postgrey daemon;  postgrey
will then block mail from that source for 300 seconds after the
future time I set for the entry (probably 6 hours).  Yes, I will
have to tweak on postgrey a bit to permit this, but it apparently
has an options mechanism for the message passing that will keep the
tweak small. 

My first approach was to just block the source of the high MX spam
permanently, but Randal pointed out that a zombie hidden behind a
legitimate mail server could also generate high MX traffic, apparently
coming from that mail server's IP address.  A few hours delay should
permit the sender to locate the zombie on their own net.  Randal
blocks the entire site by adding an entry to iptables and removing
it after a time.  While there are advantages to this (it is easy!),
it also may block web page service to the offending site, preventing
them from learning about why they are blocked, and also does not
permit postmaster@ and abuse@ emails to go through.

Well, no.  It gets added to my table for port-25 access.  So they can
still visit my website just fine.  And to them, it just looks like my
email server is down... so legit email will queue for a few hours and
finally get delivered.

Does anyone make a dual AMD-64 motherboard? Or is that a 
useful feature anymore?

I built my first Windows NT 3.1 computer right after NT 3.1 was 
released. At the time its major attraction to me (besides stability) 
was that it could use dual CPUs. Except for my Linux laptop I have 
always had dual CPU computers ever since. Two CPUs with an OS 
that knows how to use them just makes everything run more 
smoothly.

But I have paid no attention to the world of motherboards and CPUs 
since building my Windows 2000 desktop three years ago. I built it 
on a dual Athlon 1.2 GHz motherboard (Tyan Tiger S2460). I swear 
it is faster and more responsive than my almost brand new 
Compaq AMD-64 laptop with Ubuntu-64 Breezy. Nowadays I hear 
talk of "two CPUs in one" and "dual-core" and stuff that I have no 
ken of. In about a year I plan to build a new desktop and go totally 
Linux (I hope). Being a desktop the power requirements are not an 
issue, so I'd definitely like to stick with dual CPUs. 

I've been watching this thread with great interest hoping to update 
my knowledge of CPUs and motherboards for the day when I finally 
decide to build the new desktop.

Oh, and I definitely want to get one of the 24" widescreen LCD 
monitors that run at 1920 x 1200. You can get them now for about 
$1,000. I guess I also need to update my knowledge of video cards 
with Linux and which ones will drive such a monitor. Plus, I really 
want to see one in action. Does anyone know of a local store that 
has them on display, even if it is with Windows?

Yes, as long as you're on the same partition and the program has an open 
file descriptor.  The same goes for deleting a file while reading it 
(or writing for that matter (a common strategy for temporary files.)

Note that some programs will use a temp file during download and then 
write to the final location upon completion, so I wouldn't make a habit 
of this because it's very dependent on the internals of the program 
writing the file.  Vim is a good counter example:  By default it moves 
the file to a backup filename, writes a new file with the same name, 
and then deletes the backup.  So, moving a file that it has open for 
editing will mean that you save in the old location unless you have 
setup your config to do otherwise.

When you "move" a file with mv, all you're really doing is moving it's
directory entry from one place to another. The file itself doesn't go
anywhere and any processes that have a open handle to the file are not
aware that anything has happened because they are referencing the file
by inode, not by the directory entry.

But this little bit of magic only works if the source and destination
directories of the move on are the same file system. If not then mv will
copy the file to the new file system and delete the original, in which
case you would get behavior more like what you might expect - with one twist.
Your ftp transfer would have still completed and would have consumed disk
space on the original file system. On second file system you would get only
a snapshot of what was in the file at the time of the move. Upon completion
of the FTP transfer the space on the first file system would be freed up.

It depends on the use.  But a dual socket motherboard is no longer 
required.  Any Socket 939/940 motherboard is compatible with dual core 
AMD processors, which produces the same effect.  You can still get dual 
processor motherboards but it's not required anymore for SMP, unless you 
want two dual core CPU's (think 4 way).  Both Intel and AMD offer dual 
core solutions.

I'll second the recommendation of the A8N5X.  I chose this board because it
is one of the few Athlon 64 boards that explicitly states that it supports
ECC.  It was really frustating to me that many of the motherboards that I
looked at did not mention ECC support.  This is despite the fact that ECC
is built into the Athlon 64 memory controller.  The only extra cost to
a motherboard vendor is 8 traces and some BIOS work.

Sure. If you want to spent lots of money, Opterons are explicitly
designed for up to 8 processors in a system. I imagine someone is likely
trying to put more than 8 in a system.

Two things are being done. The first one on the market was Intel's
"Hyperthreading". This simulated two processors by placing two sets of
registers and context on a single processor core. This effectively splits
the processor core in two, resulting in the two virtual processors being
slower than a single processor but the net throughput being greater than
a single-context processor. Except for performance characteristics that
don't match dual-processor systems (somewhat more than half the
performance), these do otherwise look indistinguishable from
dual-processor systems.

Multi-core processors involve duplicating almost the entirety of the
processor multiple times in one package (Intel was planning to do
multiple chips in one package). For AMD this would means lower memory
bandwidth because of the shared memory controller, but otherwise for all
intents and purposes these *are* multiprocessor systems.

For cabling a good starting place is:
http://www.pacificcable.com/DVI_Tutorial.htm

Most modern cards would drive such a beast. The trick might be getting
one where the digital path can handle the bandwidth required (most cards
merely have "single-link" outputs, not "dual-link"). If you're willing to
compromise on refresh rate that might not be an issue though (LCDs are
quite usable with a 30Hz refresh, if the electronics are up for it).

I looked at MSI and Gigabyte too.  I've heard they are great boards, 
but I went with an ABIT AV8-3rd Eye, Athlon 4200+ 64-X2 with a pair 
of 512MB DDR400 memory modules.  The things I needed at the time were 
on-board FireWire, USB2 & networking.  One thing that boxed me in 
for my motherboard choices was the size of the board, since I already 
had a case.  I forget the nomenclature, but there are server boards 
just a bit bigger than ATX boards that won't fit my case.  As I 
recall, the Tyan Tiger and Thunder boards differ in size this way, 
with the Thunder being bigger, but the Thunder also improves memory 
utilization between processors.  This is kinda rusty info from me as 
it's past my 6 month half-life of knowledge.

Best-o-luck....

I have screwed up the first few sectors of an NTFS partiton using grub.  Can
anyone recommend a tool that can recover the data on the NTFS partition? I
have since reloaded windows on a second disk but windows will not recognize
the original disk as having a file system on it.  I installed the ntfs
module when booted to FC4 it recognizes the partition as being ntfs but will
not mount it because of problems with the boot sector.

Does anyone have experience recovering an NTFS file system?  Are there any
good filesystem tools available when booted to XP?

Hi,

In our Linux Installation and Configuration class at PCC, there is a 
section encouraging students to learn by playing with their test computer 
(not the production computer!). I'd appreciate any comments to help improve 
on the following:

Remember, there is nothing you can type which will make smoke come out of 
the computer (until you learn about overdriving a monitor or using a 
debugger to push the read/write head into the side of the hard drive 
case).  If you trash your Linux installation you're bound to learn 
something. Think of it as an opportunity to practice system repair (or the 
installation process) and what not to do on a production computer.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,

   I'd take out the parenthetical phrase; someone will take that as a personal
challenge. Then add "virtually" in front of "nothing."

   The second sentence can be tuned by writing, "If you trash your linux
installation -- and you've made careful notes of exactly what you have done
-- you should learn useful things."

HTH,

Rich

Hi,

Using the XP installation CD, early in the install process there is a 
repair option which has occasionally saved me.

Good luck,
Mike

Hi Mike,

I fondly remember taking two Linux admin courses from you at PCC.  Hope all is well.

Many years ago, just before the days of what we now call PCs, I wrote almost the same instruction to first year college students, trying to entice them to use Commodore PET computers (with an amazing 8K of available RAM), and to explore without fear.  Something to effect that there is nothing at all you can type which will hurt the computer.

A few days later, amendments started to appear along the lines of: Well, if you hit the keyboard like Kurt does you can destroy the keyboard but not otherwise damage the computer.

Eventually, of course, we came across something which one could type which actually would damage the computer.  For a few brief (very brief) moments, I contemplated putting out a warning along the lines of PLEASE DON'T TYPE THIS COMMAND BECAUSE YOU COULD DESTROY PART OF THE SCREEN.

I recall that we eventually decided on something very close to the original, something intended to convey information without issuing a challenge.  Something like:

In general, there is nothing you can type which will hurt the computer.

Anyway, students continued to get peanut butter (or something) on the keys, insert floppy disks backwards, spill prohibited drinks in the general vicinity, and all the rest.  But no one ever typed anything which hurt any of the precious little PETs.

Happy Holidays.

Allen

Hi,

In our Linux Installation and Configuration class at PCC, there is a 
section encouraging students to learn by playing with their test computer 
(not the production computer!). I'd appreciate any comments to help improve 
on the following:

Remember, there is nothing you can type which will make smoke come out of 
the computer (until you learn about overdriving a monitor or using a 
debugger to push the read/write head into the side of the hard drive 
case).  If you trash your Linux installation you're bound to learn 
something. Think of it as an opportunity to practice system repair (or the 
installation process) and what not to do on a production computer.

Thanks,
Mike

The recovery console (during setup) will allow you to repair the boot 
sector.  It's going to most likely remove the Linux boot loader though.

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;314058

It's been years since I dual booted NT and Linux, but as I remember it 
wasn't hard to get Linux to boot from the NT boot menu.  Google is your 
friend.

Note the $$$ was in reference to 8-processor systems. 2-processor Opteron
systems aren't too expensive. The moment you hit 4-processors for any
system you're looking at >$400 for a motherboard and those are very
pricey processors too, 8-processor motherboards are really expensive.

You can use fairly inexpensive dual-core processors in a 2-processor
system and have it act similar to a 4-processor system. For lots of money
you could stick dual-core processors on an 8-proc board for something
that looks like 16.

I think just mentioning 8-way and all the other info behind it went a

I know the gamers like the hottest processors they can get their hands 
on, but are there really video cards, monitors, games and operating 
systems that can use all this processor horsepower? After all, my 
"ordinary" 1.3 GHz Athlon T-bird is cranking out about a gigaflop at 64 
bits on the Atlas linear algebra library.

Eight dual core Opterons? You ought to be able to pull off a pretty 
convincing simulation of a journey to the center of the Sun with that 
kind of power. :) Of course, you wouldn't need to run your furnace in 
the winter either. :)

Subject: [PLUG] Manipulating Bit Masks in Python
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0512271538010.27748@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Has anyone here manipulated bit-masked data in Python? I'm having
difficulties finding information on how to go about it.

   The Numerical Python (Nympy) doc has a chapter on masked arrays, but these
are not the same thing; they're a mask that indicates which rows/columns have
valid data in an array.

   I'll be getting 2-bytes/row data from the optical mark reader and I need to
test each bit in each byte to know what data are in each row. If you know of
a reference that describes the preferred way to do this, please pass it on to
me.

Yeah. I'm not doing even serious gaming. I just know that I have 
used single-CPU Windows 2000 computers otherwise equipped 
pretty much like my dual, and mine is lots smoother. It's only 
slightly faster; the real benefit is that I never wait when I want to do 
something, regardless of what is running at the same time. I can 
be doing a full backup and downloading a multi-Gb file while 
working in OpenOffice or Photoshop and whatever program I'm 
working in acts as though nothing else is happening. It's sort of like 
having the optional larger engine in your car -- because of speed 
limits you probably won't get places much faster, but it really feels 
better. Nevertheless, dual is all I really need to get that feeling. 

Now I have to figure out the different kinds of two-in-one technology.

Well really there are only two you will be concerned with.  AMD's X2 
processor and Intel's Pentium-D.  You will want to research some 
benchmarks to find out which performs best in the areas important to 
you.  If your computer is on a lot the AMD does run consuming slightly 
less power, FYI.  Either will be pretty fast for general use.

Here are a couple links to go through:

http://support.intel.com/products/processor/pentium_D/

Here is a benchmark that came out today (pricey cpu's though):

I might be missing something obvious here, but the standard c bit op's 
are available in python; ^, &, |, >>, <<, etc.

Has to operate on ints in python, but any reason that wouldn't 
suffice?  A quick timeit test shows ops from above to be ~.27 uS for 
my semp. 2600, which is pretty quick python wise...

Has anyone used Eclipse with Breezy?

It installed and runs simple Java programs, but I cannot stop at a

I have Eclipse Version 3.1.1. I got it by running gnome-app-install and
choosing Eclipse under Programming.

Google returns lots of people saying they've encountered the same
problem. But I haven't come across a solution that works and makes
sense.

Is there anyone out there running Eclipse on Breezy and stopping at

This sounds like a screwed up partition table, not a problem with the
boot sector.  Try using fdisk (or cfdisk) to delete the partition and
then create a new partition of the correct size and type with the same
beginning cylinder that the original partition had.  Remember, you do no
damage until you tell the program to write the new partition table (in
other words, be sure to write the partition table before quitting).

You should then reboot, just to be sure, then try mounting it.  You
don't need a functioning boot sector to mount a partition and you won't
mess up the file allocation system until you format the partition.

I know of a Debian package called ntfs-tools.  I've only used the resize
tool, but had no problems.

Sure, but you have to pay to use them.

Kurt,

    I noticed a bit of the same myself.

    You say you found:
            -  12 unique Linux magazines in Germany
               (Were all of these in German?)
            -  5 unique Linux magazines in France
    I noticed several Japanese language Linux magazines.
    while in the US I'm only aware of:
            -  Linux Journal (by SSC)
            -  Linux Magazine (www.linuxmagazine.com)
            -  and there was one other, but it was short lived.
            -  Also Linux World conferences sometimes put something
               out that makes the magazine racks - but it isn't really
               a magazine.
            -  And there are a few on-line magazines including
               - The Linux Gazette (by SSC)
               - TUX (by SSC)
            -  And of course there are the Linux news web sites
    Many American bookstores also carry:
            -  Linux Format (published in UK)
            -  Linux Magazine (www.linux-magazine.com)
               (This is an english langage magazine published by
               the German media company - Linux New Media.
               They publish magazines in several languages.)

    Until now I thought the name confussion between PLUG and PDXLUG
was bad; but this is minor compared to the potential confussion 
between linux magazine and linux-magazine!!

Thanks for the suggestion Chris.  I finally had some time to
dig into this a bit more.  I tried reconfiguring the mouse.  It
was set to something like "IMPS/2" in xorg.conf.  I config'd it
to "PS/2".  I also tried a USB mouse I've got.  It seems that
neither mouse makes my system happy.  But, I do know a little
more now.  My system will lock up after a fashion, and each time
it's *always* after I click a button on the mouse.  So far it's
always the leftmost button (for right-handed folks) that causes
trouble.  When I say "lock up after a fashion" that means that
user input from the keyboard or mouse is all done.  The best I
can do is to slide the mouse pointer left & right.

Something else that characterizes the lockup is that I can ssh
into the machine, get a shell, and the system seems OK from that
shell.  But, I can't shutdown the machine from that shell.  I
tried after su'ing.  I could see an init process trying to enter
run-level 6.  I started killing off child processes of my KDE
session and the machine still wouldn't shut down.  Finally I had
to power it down.

I've never had an IRQ conflict in a machine before.  Is this
sounding like that?

I ran in console mode for hours without any trouble.  My mouse
didn't do anything tho, so maybe that's not a fair test.

I fired up IceWM instead of KDE 3.4.  It's only been 10 minutes
into IceWM, but I've been trying to click into oblivion without
locking things up yet.  I'll pursue this more.

Anyone have idea for me to try?

Thanks much....

OK, IceWM has the same trouble, but it took longer to show up than my 
previous KDE sessions.  Something else a bit different with the IceWM 
session, 'top' told me that the X server was using 99.4% of my CPU.  
I found this out via ssh.  I then killed the X server, which I'd 
hoped might respawn.  Nope.  Instead my ssh shell locked up too.

Sigh....

   I posted the message before completing all my research. I know that I get

Subject: [PLUG] high MX versus greylisting
Message-ID: <20051228162723.GA7977@gate.kl-ic.com>


A High-MX spam trap may be incompatable with greylisting, unless
the two are carefully combined.

Randal has a clever "high MX spam filter" system that detect
when the bad guys attempt to get around spam blocking by going
to the secondary mail input first.  Here's how it works:

The MX records for my site specify an alternate mailing address
to use when my primary mailing address is not responding;  this
alternate address has a higher MX value, telling the mail transport
programs out there to use that high MX address if they cannot connect
to the normal low MX address.  Since the alternate address is often
less heavily guarded than the main one, some spam-bots try that
alternate high-MX address first.

One simple (but sometimes invalid, see below) way to detect
spammers (and the IP address they are working out of) is to
set up a fake high MX secondary address, on the same machine
as the primary (but with another IP address perhaps), and
temporarily blacklist the IP addresses that try to use it. 
After all, if the secondary address is capable of receiving
mail, the primary address is too - there should never be any
mail to that address.

Now, add greylisting.  Greylisting works on the idea that a real
SMTP server will retry sending a message if it doesn't get through
immediately.  spam-bots don't do this.  So a greylisting MTA
(Mail Transport Agent) receiving an email will send a 450 error
to the sending MTA the first time it sees an email attempt, but
will pass the message (and whitelist the server) when it sees
another attempt more than five minutes later.  This blocks more
than 95% of spam-bots, and when I turned on greylisting on my
server I went from 60 spam messages making it through spamassassin
per day, to less than 2 (Note, I get around 30,000 raw spam
attempts per day).

However, because greylisting sends out the 450 temporary error
to the sending MTA, that MTA will retry on the high-MX port.
A High-MX trap program will need to be aware of this, or it
will treat this valid behavior as a spambot.  

I do not have time right now to rewrite my high-MX detector
and combine it with Postgrey, so I just take the high-MX messages
and dump them on the floor.  That stops the high-MX-only spam,
though it creates an inconvenience all the other valid MTAs
and may cause some to break.  Unless I can combine the behaviors
properly, I probably shouldn't run the high-MX detector.

Very cool profiling of that behaviour!  If the response is entirely
RFC compliant, and doesn't break valid (but non-RFC...) MTA's that's a
great frontline defence before any Bayesian filtering even has to take
place!

Aside from the points you mentioned, the most important thing I can
think of would be the addition of some software loadbalancing-esque
feature.  If the real and faux MX are on the same box, having
per-minute (or realtime) polling of the status of the "real" MX would
be necessary in the event that it actually fails, so your backup can
actually receive.  IMO.

Cheers on the good work, please update when/if you have time to
integrate that further.

Subject: [PLUG] A Postgrey problem solved
Message-ID: <20051228194514.GA8613@gate.kl-ic.com>


As I mentioned in a previous post to the PLUG list, I am now
running Postgrey, and it really stops a lot of spam.  I also
run a DNS check, an RBL check, and spamassassin afterwards.  
While I am getting 30,000 spam attempts per day hitting my
server, only 2 or 3 make it through.  Color me pleased!

There were a couple of things I ran into that aren't mentioned
in the rather skimpy Postgrey documentation, that might save
some of you some headaches. 

First, the documentation suggests using a port to connect to
the postgrey daemon, while the RPM installs /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgrey
configured to use a socket.  If you install from an rpm, check
the file /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgrey.  If it contains these lines:

DBPATH=/var/spool/postfix/postgrey
SOCKET=$DBPATH/socket
OPTIONS="--unix=$SOCKET"

Then you should have these lines in your /etc/postfix/main.cf file:

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
    permit_mynetworks
    reject_unauth_destination
    check_policy_service unix:/var/spool/postfix/postgrey/socket

Second, the "permit_mynetworks" line above is important, but not
explicitly mentioned in the postgrey documentation.  I initially
configured the above lines without the "permit_mynetworks.  It
failed to pass traffic outbound from the mailing lists I run on
my servers.  I would get a bunch of these errors instead:

  Dec 28 13:40:19 rimu postfix/smtpd[24279]: NOQUEUE: reject: RCPT from \
  localhost[127.0.0.1]: 554 <john at somedomain.com>: Relay access denied; \
  from=<dirvish-bounces at dirvish.org> to=<john at somedomain.com> proto=ESMTP \
  helo=<rimu.kl-ic.com>
  (line breaks added)

Of course, the inbound line to keithl AT kl-ic DOT com worked fine;
it was difficult to detect that the mailing list was broken.

I fiddled with all sorts of things, but eventually found a few postfix
main.cf listings on websites out there with "permit_mynetworks" set.
This frob got the mailing lists moving again.


If there are any college students out there that are looking for
senior projects, there are two things that need to be done about
postfix.  First, postfix needs a friendly front-end configurator,
probably implemented as a set of web pages that you feed information
to, producing the /etc/postfix files.  Fully developed, that might
make a nifty web product for some mail-savvy company like Naked Ape;
choose a template, enter information, paypal $10, and download a
usable main.cf and other files .  A lot of templates to design,
sure, but over time nobody has to read the docs, the dove book,
or desperately google for keywords.  

Secondly, postfix needs a simulator.  This could also be a website,
where you feed it some network description operation, the contents
of your /etc/postfix directory and a few other configs, then start
feeding the simulator fake mails on various spigots and see what
happens.  This would be more involved than the config generator,
but probably necessary to test it thoroughly.  One of the really
stupid things about postfix (like other MTAs, sigh) is how little
testing it permits; you pretty much have to take it live and run
an ad-hoc mail test script to make sure it is working - and then
a bunch of users get annoying test emails.  Ugly.  

Oh well.  At least postfix beats sendmail, and works fine if you
know what you are doing (myself not included, sigh).

Message-ID: <9e0a35780512281309j1e072494ha069b59ec0c8b98f@mail.gmail.com>

Here's the situation...

I have a box outside my network that has only SSH access available.  This
box is running Squid.  Computer "A" on my network is only allowed to SSH to
this remote box, "R".  I then setup an SSH tunnel from "A" to "R" with this
command:

ssh -f -N -L 3128:localhost:3128 user at server.tld

So far so good.  Computer "A" can browse the web through Squid on "R".

Now, I have Computer "B" that cannot reach "R", but I'd like to pass the
traffic through "A".  So on "A" I created the following tunnel to listen
locally on 3129 and redirect to the other tunnel on 3128:

ssh -f -N -L 3129:localhost:3128 user at 127.0.0.1

Then on "B", I created this tunnel:

ssh -f -N -L 3129:localhost:3129 user at computerA

So far so good.  On "B", I can telnet to localhost on port 3129 and I get
Squid responding from "R".

Now, I want to transparently redirect any outgoing port 80 traffic on
computer "B" to travel through these tunnels to Squid on "R".  I've been
fumbling around with iptables for a while now to redirect outgoing port 80
traffic to 127.0.0.1:3129, but no luck.  While you're pondering that, I'll
continue reading the netfilter docs...

Thanks,

My "client" has updated her requirements. Mom is now interested in 
reducing the amount of furniture in her place, and wants to find a 
computer monitor that also works as a TV, or the other way around.

Fry's had an ad for one at $649 (Syntex Ovidea, or something like that - 
comes from Taiwan. Circuit City had the same one for $639.), so on 
Monday, I braved the crowds and had a look. They had it hooked up to a 
computer running XP and some video clips. Looked pretty sharp. The nice 
lady at the store shut down the video clips and let me look at some text 
(I didn't remember to take my own image files - but considering the 
crowd, that would have been asking a lot, since I was just having a 
look). The display worked well at 800 x 600, and also in some larger 
resolutions suitable for the HDTV sized screen.

Mom currently has a 27" TV, and needs that size screen. This was listed 
as a 27", but I haven't been in the HDTV market, so I didn't realize 
that they still measure them the same  way - diagonally - and what is 
27" in HDTV works out to something like 24" in the old 4:3 aspect ratio. 
To get the equivalent of 27", one has to go to a 32" model. Naturally, 
the price goes up a minimum of around $300, which puts it into the, 
"that's nice, but I think I'll wait awhile" category for Mom.

So, I think this solution will work for her, later this year when the 
prices come down on the 32" models.

Is anyone on the list using an LCD TV as a computer monitor?

Message-ID: <20051228224918.GA8983@gate.kl-ic.com>


I don't know whether this means anything, but I got a message from
a potential client in Beaverton that has a strange message ID:

!~!UENERkVCMDkAAQACAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgAAAAAAAAAxLkJF2VfLkOlCfAsg2WrTMKAAAAQAAAAE4On7vWWUESqKFpE0KjRQQEAAAAA at ______-inc.com

(name changed to protect the innocent).

They are using Outlook:

   X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook, Build 10.0.6626

Since the average message ID number part is around 15-25 characters,
and the longest legitimate ID in a few hundred recent emails is 40
(amazon.com, who else?), I wonder if this is a sign that they have
Outlook misconfigured, or perhaps even zombied and attempting a
buffer overflow?

I checked 190K archived emails, and have seen this about 12 times in
legitimate mail over the last year (all from Outlook) and quite a few
in spams.  Any ideas?

This is normal for Outlook. IIRC, this is generated when the sender includes 
"Message Disposition Notification" aka "read reciept" aka when the sender 
wants to know if the receiver read the email.

Well, you have to install the rootkit in order to send the read

Rootkit? Most people I know run Windows with an account that has

My guess would be that you are having a firewall problem.  Eclipse tries 
to make a tcp connection to the vm running the program to be debugged.

Message-ID: <20051229171234.GA16565@gate.kl-ic.com>


Most of us use Mailman for mailing lists, everyone here has used
it.  The number one question I am asked by non-computer-people
on the lists I manage is "how do I get at my control page" or some
variation of that.

Even though the text above the "Unsubscribe or edit options" is
reasonably descriptive, the button label itself conveys the wrong
impression to many.  I am thinking of renaming it for my lists to
something more natural, or creating extra buttons (that all go to
the same user edit page).  Any good user interface designers with
better ideas?

You must also start the VM you intend to debug with some options to allow a
remote debugger to connect. I don't have the details in front of me, but you
should be able to find them easily. Are you trying to debug a webapp? If so
you will need to configure the appserver you are using to allow a debugger
to connect. For a standalone app it's just a couple command line args.

Well, you have to enable squid to work with transparently redirected 
traffic.

squid.conf: httpd_accel_uses_host_header on

There might be another important option too.. I forget. Googling 
"transparent proxy squid howto" worked for me in the past.

 It should be, but it's for an application that doesn't have proxy support.

Alrighty, for those of you following along, here's a recap and the solution:

I have an application with no proxy support.  The network does not allow
connections on port 80 to the Internet, except through a web proxy that
requires authentication.  I do, however, have Squid running on a server on
the outside of the network and I have a box on the inside that can SSH only
to it.  So I created SSH tunnels between each box and setup iptables to
redirect port 80 to the locally listening SSH tunnel.

>From inside box:
ssh -f -N -L 3128:localhost:3128 user at outside_server

>From second inside box running the app with no proxy support:
ssh -f -N -L 3128:localhost:3128 user at inside_box
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 127.0.0.1:3128

So, all outgoing port 80 traffic on the box running the app with no proxy
support is transparently redirected to an SSH tunnel to the other inside box
which is redirected to the outside box running Squid through a second SSH
tunnel.

Crazy stuff, but fun.

Googling for egg package linux got me this info:

"Eggs are to Pythons as Jars are to Java..."
  -- http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs

They are zipfiles containing a Python app and its dependencies.  Looks
to be kind of an alternative to .pyc files and frozen binaries.

Now I know something I didn't 5 minutes ago,

Context would be helpful.

"eggdrop" software is a bot program for irc.

"egg" is an interpreter for the language in Dijkstra's Discipline of 
Computer Programming.

"libegg" is a Gnome library.

There are other contexts where "egg" is used, but that seems to be the 
three main ones.  (There is also used to be an eggcups thingie for cups 
printer software, but I may be hallucinating.)

Context would be helpful.

"eggdrop" software is a bot program for irc.

"egg" is an interpreter for the language in Dijkstra's Discipline of 
Computer Programming.

"libegg" is a Gnome library.

There are other contexts where "egg" is used, but that seems to be the 
three main ones.  (There is also used to be an eggcups thingie for cups 
printer software, but I may be hallucinating.)

Thanks, Chris and Rob.

I was able to solve the problem by installing Sun's java (not the one
that comes with Ubuntu) and configuring eclipse to use that. I kept the
eclipse that came with Ubuntu.

Details on how to do this are on the Ubuntu Forum, Desktop section. If
you're interested search for a post by tedk there. I got help from an
Ubuntu forum member called timetunnel.

Chris, you're the guy I used to know at Data General, right?

   Thanks, Aaron. I used the same search term but did not see that hit on
the first three pages. Found a lot about egg cartons, though.

Jason,

   Thank you. I didn't get this hit from google. I did, however, find the PEAK

Nobody's mentioned "Easter Eggs" in software yet. But they aren't Linux

Anyone have experiences with either tool?

Message-ID: <1135976952.8581.8.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Sometimes I sit in the library, using the free wireless Internet it
provides. Every so often (every hour or so; yes, I sometimes spend the
day there) I lose the connection and then it just comes back on its own.
This happens to everyone. When it happens, I've cruised around and
checked with other laptop users. 

I checked with one of the librarians. She said, just be patient it'll
come back. She's right. But does anyone know why it happens?

I asked if they did it on purpose -- the wired stations they provide say
that connections are limited to an hour so that everyone gets a chance.
So I asked it they threw everyone off the wireless for some reason. She
said no, they didn't do that, just be patient, it'll come back. And it
always does, in a few minutes.

Does anyone know why this happens? The library I sit in is the
Tanasbourne one.

Someone using a leaky microwave oven?  2.4ghz phone in use?  Don't know 
without being there with the proper tools.

I have problems using wireless when the microwave is running.

The access point may be rebooting itself.  Do you know what kind of
access point they are using?  They are often visible, bolted to a
ceiling or the like.

Yes, I suspected the access point was rebooting but can't guess why.
I'll see if I can find it next time I'm there.

The librarians haven't a clue and I don't want to appear to complain.
I'm a big fan of the library.

One more thing to try is use a tool such as kismet or netstumbler to do
a on the cheap "spectrum analyzer" survey.  Ideally I'd be as close to
the access point as I could get.  See if there is something generating
noise during the outage.

I have heard good things about OpenFiler, http://www.openfiler.org/. 
It is based on Centos (which is based on RHEL).  It is a single
purpose distribution which means it just does NAS/SAN. It is supposed
to have an easy setup and good web-based management tools.
