True, but the big question is "why?" unless you absolutely want a
backup modem just in case you're in some bizarre part of the world
that hasn't learned of wifi yet, and your laptop happens to have one
of these neutered buggers built in already.

I'm not sure how much this applies to the situation at hand, though
I've noticed with several different cable modems at different
locations since AT&TBI took over part of @Home that the cable modem
itself will hang if it hears more than itself and one other MAC on
it's ethernet segment.  If you have more than one computer, NAT is
pretty much mandatory to get around this odd bug.

   Wow! That's the first time I've seen a request to fork a child process in

Well, the point was to:
fork()
sleep 23,667,694.5
exec()

Now I may be wrong, but I think you need an 'eject' in there, followed
by 'head', 'tail', and finally 'cut' :-)

I doubt it.

The video I speak of, as indicated in my initial reply, shows the 
_/*core*/_ in operation. A relevant link from a quality source:

http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071021-core-of-windows-7-taking-shape-meet-the-minwin-kernel.html

Windows 2008 Server Core is like this already, and will ship without a 
GUI. I'm not going to get into an MS war, but I was just answering his 
question, which seems sincere in that he didn't know.

Now more on topic, Linux the kernel has been ready for the desktop for a 
long time. The problem however is the OS, not the kernel. Ubuntu and 
others in all their glory falls far short of reaching ease of use across 
the board. I know there is a long list of things distro's like Ubuntu do 
very well, but there some things that are not being done well that will 
affect any user. And anyone who is honest with themselves should be able 
to think of a couple good examples without trying too hard. It's not all 
the FOSS community's fault when things like documentation get in the 
way, but I could argue your 50 million lines of code by saying 50 
million developers has it's drawbacks too. The inconsistencies in the 
user experience scream out all over the place if you put any thought 
into it.

Personally, I give kudos to Apple for OSX. They created a GUI/*nix 
environment in a relatively short amount of time that for the most part 
works very well.

The posting is a "M seeking F" ad on Craig's List in NY, amusing
because it involves a guy seeking a woman to raise command-line-
using children with.  Sorta funny, sorta wistful, sorta hopeless,
but ... possibly leading to a dangerous thread.

Let's keep the "jokes" tasteful, and the offensive ones non-existent. 
Read this:

http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Encourage-Women-Linux-HOWTO/

... and consider whether your "joke" might drive a female Linux
user (or male Linux user sensitive to the needs of women) away.
So far, the humor we share here has been good, and not offensive
to each other.  I'm proud of us.  Thanks for keeping it that way!

Keith

P.S.  Offensive to Bill Gates, Steve Balmer, Darl McBride?  Sure!
They aren't on the list.  If they want help using Linux, we can
do that, and help them repent their sins.

OK, then you are just naive and we can chalk it up to that.  Yes, the
same 50+ million lines of code in Vista will also be in Windows 7.
You think they coded it all from scratch?  Ummm...yeah...heh

Well, the model is different.  I can run a basic Win32 binary I
compiled for NT4 and it will still likely run on Windows Vista.  With
nix, the point is to not duplicate labor, and this brings in the
dependencies problem, which will always be with us.  It is a trade-off
for having lots of duplicated code everywhere...

It is nice, but I don't like to pay premiums for being locked into
restricted freedom.  I guess we all pick our battles.  My original
point was that all the code is the same in almost every Windows
release.  Every reverse engineer already knows this.  Why do you think
bugs in WMF affected every version of Windows :-)  Now, I'll grant you
that Windows 7 is smaller code base, but all they did was pick and
choose the existing bits they wanted, slim it down, remove the GUI,
and give you a simple shell to get the state of things.  However, the
kernel is nearly identical to Vista, just with some new code sprinkled
in to glue it all together.  The guy even mentions this in the
video...

Well, there aren't *really* 50 million developers. If you just count the 
desktop -- the kernel, xorg, the two major desktops and GUI toolkits, 
Firefox, Evolution and OpenOffice.org, it can't really be more than 
several hundred *active*, *real*, *named*, *contributing* developers.

What I think is more of a problem than "inconsistencies in the user 
experience" is a lack of *real* innovation in the user experience. A 
Linux PC looks more like a Windows PC every day I see one. Mine doesn't 
-- mine looks more like a Sun or Vax workstation than anything else out 
of the "past", but most of them do.

Of course, their GUI evolved from the original Mac GUI, which predates 
Windows by a number of years. Windows to a certain extent started as a 
Mac GUI knockoff. Mac users had Excel and WYSIWIG word processors and 
drawing programs when PC users were still using Lotus 1-2-3 and 
WordPerfect on DOS. The first versions of Windows used only one button 
of the mouse, etc.

And nobody before or since has *ever* done anything like HyperCard. :)

Ed,

There actually was a HyperCard-like product called Toolbook in the early
1990's put out by Asymetrix (a Paul Allen company).
I worked for Asymetrix.  
Asymetrix was very clear that HyperCard had been the inspiration for
Toolbook.
The unfortunate thing was that Toolbook got awards at shows for new
features,
that a short time later appeared in MS Visual Basic.
Asymetrix is no longer around.

I don't often need to open old MS Office files, but whenever I have had
the need the import facility has worked fine with all versions of OOo
back to before 1.0. That is, there is an occasional minor formatting
glitch, both they definitely open. 

Send one of each type to me off-list and let me see what happens when I
try them. If they work for me then we can sleuth out what I have that
you don't.

Folks, 

Even my wife is saying it's time to upgrade the wireless . . . So I'm
wondering what your thoughts are on 802.11n and draftn stuff. Was
reading the other day that true 802.11n hardware will come out this
summer.

So should I upgrade now, or wait?

Thanks,

Doesn' the Apple Air have 802.11n?  I think so.  Regarding your
question though, I have always learned that it never pays to be an
early adopter.  I had one of the first consumer DVD recordable drives.
 What a pain that was, and to record at 1x took a very long time!!??
Just like with cars, you get the best vantage point (and deals,
superior technology, robust engineering) about 2-3 years out from the
initial offering to the public.  Look at the iPhone :-)  Had you
waited, could have saved $100 only three months later!  It always pays
to lag behind.  In fact, I think it is unwise to adopt early.
However, we need some of you consumers to be the sacrificial lambs, so
maybe I shouldn't have told you all this (my consumer purchases will
now be less robust 2-3 years out).  Anyway, that's just my two cents.
Take it or leave it...

It depends on whether you want to spend premium dollars for "the latest 
gizmo" or not. I don't actually have wireless at all, so maybe I'm a bad 
example. :)

And, the Mac GUI evolved from the Lisa, which is what Apple put together
out of  what they got from Xerox PARC. M$ just took longer to implement
what they got from PARC.

I was working at Apollo Computer when the Lisa came out. At Apollo we
had a windowing GUI, with a mouse or a touch pad, for the workstation OS
before the introduction of the Lisa. Somebody bought one and brought it
in for us to play with.

For what reason are you "upgrading"?  There may be other options that
solve the problem you are trying to solve.

First, if you do don't get the Intel 4965AGN. There are bugs in the
driver (worse in the 64-bit) that cause sudden hangups. Supposedly this
will be fixed with a later kernel. Some already report success by
upgrading their kernel, but I'm unwilling to do so on a computer where
everything else is working. I'll wait for Hardy Heron and see what
happens. Meantime I'm using a borrowed Netgear WG511T that "just works."

I should also ask if getting an n-capable device now is going to make
any difference - I don't know of any access points that support it yet.
Or does the access point device have any bearing on it? If so, the only
reason for getting one now is to avoid having to upgrade one more time
several years from now when there are places where it would make a
difference. In my case about 90% of my wireless use is at PSU. If PSU
has to upgrade all their hardware to the n standard before I will get
the benefit of it, then I can just forget about it. The power outlets
on the fourth floor of the library put out 75-80 volts and they can't
even find the money to fix those. (I brought a meter from home day
because I was so frustrated.)

I'd say get something like the WG511T on eBay for $15-20 and give it to
Free Geek several years from now when it makes sense to get one with
the n standard.

I don't think we're lacking innovation (as long as you accept that the 
demo of said innovation may not have any practical use.)

I think it really comes down to the lack of real *money* to pay for 
professional effort focussed on user experience.  It doesn't help that 
users spend all their money on lawn ornaments.

Money (and funded effort) in open source tends to go toward uptime, 
throughput, security, and similar features with widely accepted and 
clear-cut cost/benefit breakdowns.

Anybody know what happened to the OSDL desktop initiative?

Actually, just one year.  Windows was first released in November, 1985.

I'm not sure if the one-button thing is true, considering many other
DOS programs of that vintage did use all three buttons (Logitech
Paintshow being the most notorious that comes to mind right now).

Visual Basic wasn't that far off back around version 3.0 and 3.1.

One possible workaround would be to upload 'em to Google Documents and

Of course not. The point being that the decentralized nature of the

across so many people and other boundaries the logistics to make it all

   Thanks, Paul. It's probably a corrupted file as John couldn't open it with

   No. Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. There was a really good video on
YouTube documenting how Xerox gave away everything they had to Apple.
Unfortunately, that video's been removed for some term-of-use violation.

I have to convert some stuff for others and have used
http://www.zamzar.com/

It seems to work well.  They have locked it down to being able to submit only
one document at a time but it works.  You upload the document and then
get an e-mail back when the conversion is finished to download the completed
document.

Linuxant, as many of you know, is intended to allow people with Linux laptops to use Wifi cards that would not otherwise work. I am running SuSE 10.3, and when I attempted to install Airlink 101 AWLC3028 with their software the computer hung and the OS would not reboot. (More details on request.) But I would suggest having a good backup if you try to install a card with their application.

"Thirteen tasks were running, most of which would be familiar to
anyone who has opened Task Manager: smss.exe, csrss.exe, and
svchost.exe were all there, plus the mini web server httpsrv.exe."

The code is all the same in the kernel, but they detached the GUI.
You can see the same code is all there.  However, since they don't
have a proper shell yet to interface with the kernel, they wrote
simple web server.  Like, one that anyone could write.  It handles
three requests :-)  One of the options is to dump the internal process
table.  I bet they still use the winxx api call EnumProcesses() in
Windows 7 to get this list unless they are dumping the internal tables
directly for MinWin...

ndiswrapper is another solution...and supports 64-bit as well...

Talking about the origins of personal computer GUI-ness, I would recommend
renting "The Pirates of Silicon Valley", it was a direct to TV movie a
number of years ago on TNT, and shows just this sort of progress of Apple
and M$ in the elder days of the computer industry, how things started, with
PARC and Seattle Computer (sp?), Big Blue, and so forth.

Quite well done, and when asked about it Steve Wozniak said it was a "fairly
accurate representation", though it did have a little bit of artistic
license of course.  Rather good moments in there, including the bit where
Bill and Steve are talking about their new GUIs, and how they both got the
ideas from Xerox, Bill said something to the effect of, "We both live next
to a rich neighbor, you stole their TV, we stole their VCR."  Also quite
entertaining was the part where Steve takes a hit of LSD and starts
"conducting a symphony"...

My dim understanding of Linuxant is that they sell a script that
downloads the Windows driver for your card, installs ndiswrapper, and
configures it for the driver. They also have resources for finding the
Windows drivers. All of the above can be done by yourself. Having said
that, it's a useful service for beginners or people who just want the
thing working and don't know how (or want to spend the time to learn
how) to do it themselves.

If your computer won't boot after running their stuff, see if you can
boot into recovery mode. If you can, do lsmod and see if ndiswrapper is
loaded. And if so, do ndiswrapper -l to see if the driver is loaded.

   Thank you, Larry and John.

   Looking at the contents of the file with 'less' I see that there's nothing
in there that I really need. It _might_ have been useful, but it's turned
out to be less than I thought.

One thing to consider before you abandon all hope, during that time 
frame, MS Office saved files in rtf, but named them .doc, in the name of 
compatibility with other versions of the software.  It was a major 
kludge they fixed in the next release.  Since you looked at the file 
already with less, I suspect this is what happened, since a true doc 
file wouldn't be readable as text.  Look at the first line of the file 
and see if it says RTF anywhere, or just rename it as file.rtf and see 
if OO.o can read it then.

   The file under discussion was created with PowerPoint-7.0b. When I looked
at it, I could see some text strings among all the binary blocks. Saved a
copy as *.doc, but that didn't work, either.

   Strangely enough, toward the top of the file is this:

^@^@^@^@^T^@^@^@&^F^O^@^^^@<FF><FF><FF><FF>^D^@^T^@^@^@Word^N^@Microsoft
Word^E

That's why I tried as a .doc file.

   Anyway, it's FUBAR and that's OK.

Thanks, Michael,

Rich

Folks,

John, My understanding is different - I don't think they use Ndiswrapper
- otherwise they'd support a larger array of wireless cards that would
otherwise be Windows only. When I used Linuxant a long while back for a
card with some old Realtek chipset, my fungable memory (i.e. I could be
full of ..it) suggests that it worked a lot better than Ndiswrapper.

However, I wonder a bit about their business - the last news on their
website is from early 2006. 

Tim, In other words, I suspect their software might not be updated to
support openSUSE 10.3. But the last time I used it, the Linuxant person
monitoring their mailing list responded fairly quickly.

Thanks,
Mike

Another good book "Fumbling the future" describes how back in the 
'70s, Xerox developed the desktop computer, Ethernet, laser printer, 
mouse, GUI and WYSIWYG word processor, how they demonstrated an 
integrated network at the sales managers meeting and how the sales 
managers snubbed the idea . DUH!

"Fire in the valley" covers the early days at MITS through the demise 
of Computerland.

Hi all,

For some reason I decided to learn emacs.  I bought the oreily book
Learning Gnu Emacs 3rd edition.  On page 306, it says, "You can hide
the toolbar through the Show/Hide option on the Options menu."
Well...I can't find that option.  I am using Gun emacs 21.4.1, and the
book was written for Gnu emacs 21.3.5.  I'm just trying to take my
first baby step, i.e. not write macros or Lisp, of configure my .emacs
file.  Is what I need in the customization group?  I'm a bit lost.
Could someone  just please show me the lay of the land please?

Victor,

Don't depend on the toolbar.

Ctrl-H A Should help you find most commands.
Worst case Ctrl-H Ctrl-H can help you with Help.

The most confusing at first is the meta-X which can be <esc>-X or Alt-X.
Ctrl-X is something completely different.

Suggest you start with the very basic commands:
	^A	Move to beginning of line (Ctrl-A)
	^E	Move to end of line
	^D	Delete character under cursor
	Backspace	Delete preceding character
	Cursor keys
	Escape > Move to end of buffer
	Escape < Move to beginning of buffer
	^s	Search forward
	^r	Search backward

Most of these command also work in Bash with the default settings (or do a
"set -o emacs")

Don't worry about the .emacs file until you understand the very basics.

It helps to get a good .emacs file from someone.  I put up a sample
file at http://mirror.wrlug.org/emacs/sample_emacs_files/_emacs

Every .emacs file I've ever seen has a (custom-set-variables) form in
it somewhere.  You can add this to the form:

'(tool-bar-mode nil nil (tool-bar))

Or you can use M-x customize-variable to customize `tool-bar-mode'.
This will do the same thing, namely writing the above quoted list to

I suggest upgrading to emacs 22 or 23.  You'll have to do it sooner or
later, and there are backwards compatibility issues between 21.4 and
22.  I happen to know that JDEE is moving toward emacs 22+
compatibility.

That's why I want to remove it, and I can't figure out how to remove
it.  The instructions in my book says, "You can hide the toolbar
through the Show/Hide option on the Options menu.".  I can find the
Options menu, but I can't find the Show/Hide option.

Even more worse case, I couldn't figure out what to do when I typed
Ctrl-H Ctrl-H.  I was overwhelmed by the terse statements of help that
I saw.  I still can't effectivly use the Help menu.

Once I get rid of the toolbar, so I don't rely on it, I plan on
playing around with a text file.  I also want to change my keybindings
to avoid carpal tunnel, but first I want to get rid of that darn
options menu.

That did the trick!  I am annoyed that I couldn't get rid of the
toolbar by using the Options menu.  Is there a way to do this via the
Options menu?  I even went to the web site of FAQs about emacs,

http://www.xemacs.org/Documentation/21.5/html/xemacs-faq_5.html#SEC187

and it said,

 Q4.5.1: How do I get rid of the toolbar?

#### Write me.


I decided to write to my local PLUG for help.  All in all, it's been
frustrating just getting started.  I guess I'm a masochist.

I don't know how to upgrade.  All I did was apt-get install emacs, and
I got version 21.4.1 which is fine for me at this time because the
oreilly book that I'm going through is geared toward 21.3.5, which I
presume is good enough for learning purposes.

When I was a bit more ambitious, I downloaded the source code for
emaics, compiled it, and then the computer said I needed something
called ncurses.  I couldn't figure out the latter, so I just went with
apt-get install emacs.

So now I can get rid of the toolbar, but can I get rid of it using the
Options meny using the Show/Hide option?  I can't find the latter
option.  I'm just curious now.  It seem like it shouldn't be this
problematic.

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

Victor,

   Why not just ignore it? Nothing says you need to use it. There's a tool
bar on both the console and X Window System versions. Sometimes they're
handy, the rest of the time I use the keyboard alone.

   Because it's there does not mean you must -- or will -- rely on it. You'll
learn to use emacs much more quickly by using it. When you need to do
something you don't know how to do, you'll learn it. IMO, it's much more
important to use tools as a means to an end rather than making the tool an
end in itself.

Message-ID: <1202099554.5825.127.camel@badger.arghwebworks.com>

Ok, I've fouled this up somehow, and I need help making it work again. 

The scenario is:
Company A is a hosting company, and provides mail service for companyb.
They've been doing this for a while, and their current setup has worked
in the past, but something I've done in the last week or perhaps year
( it's hard to say how long this hasn't been working ) has fouled it up.

CompanyB is assigned a real live user on CompanyA's mailserver,
usercompanyb. CompanyB is in the /etc/mail/local-host-names
and /etc/mail/virtuser-domains, and there are several users assigned to
this company in the /etc/mail/virtusertable ( which is hashed ). A
segment of /etc/mail/virtusertable looks like
alice at companyb.com usercompanyb
bob at companyb.com usercompanyb
carol at companyb.com usercompanyb

There's a seriously funny looking procmailrc file to move the files from
usercompanyb to /home/usercompanyb/mail/(alice|bob|carol) .

The problem, in a nutshell, is this: If I send mail from
bob at companyb.com to alice at companyb.com and cc to carol at companyb.com,
carol does not get it. It does not even show up in the maillog file when
I "tail -f /var/log/maillog | grep companyb.com" -- the one for alice
shows up but not carol.  If I send mail from my gmail account to both
alice and carol ( to:alice, cc:carol, same as testing as bob ) both
entries show up in the /var/log/maillog and in their mailboxes.

Which means it looks to me like something in the sendmail.cf file that
keeps bob from sending duplicate messages to usercompanyb ( something in
local delivery?). I build it regular like from sendmail.mc, which I've
duplicated below, trimming out some comments and assorted crap.

So, the question is; what did I break?

Well, many inner workings of the sendmail.mc file are opaque to me,
however, the order of the FEATURES is importand, and the quotes ... I'm
not sure how the quotes figured in.
I changed from this order and these quotings:
~~~~~~~~~~~
FEATURE(`virtusertable',`hash -o /etc/mail/virtusertable.db')dnl
(several lines redacted)
VIRTUSER_DOMAIN_FILE( `/etc/mail/virtuser-domains' )dnl
FEATURE(`virtuser_entire_domain')dnl
~~~~~~~~~~~
to this order and these quotings:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
VIRTUSER_DOMAIN_FILE(/etc/mail/virtuser-domains)dnl
FEATURE(virtuser_entire_domain)dnl
FEATURE(`virtusertable',`hash -o /etc/mail/virtusertable.db')dnl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And, ahem, verified the correct ownership
on /home/usercompanyb/.procmailrc

I'm curious about how much server-side Javascript is deployed
in the world. Is anyone here using it on a Linux platform?
on Windows?

For what it's worth, the options menu in my emacs install has a
Show/Hide sub-menu, with checkboxes for the various things that can be
shown/hidden:

http://ciscavate.org/data/emacs_options_menu.jpg

but I'm running v. 23.0.60.1  (well worth it, IMO, by the way)

Try the emacs tutorial.  C-H t  (that's Ctrl-H, then press t) or
Help->Emacs Tutorial.

Remapping caps lock to act as an additional control will help a lot
(if you haven't done that already), but I think changing the actual
emacs keybindings is a bad idea.  As others have pointed out, bash and
many other interactive apps use emacs-style keybindings for navigation
(anything that is based on gnureadline).  All the tutorials and
on-line information out there for emacs also assume standard sets of
keybindings -- to the point that there are certain chunks of
keystrokes that are reserved for personal modification vs. new emacs
modes and addons.  I've also found that dvorak works very well with
the default emacs keybindings, and in general switching to that from
qwerty made a huge difference in hand and wrist pain.

I'd be happy to help with emacs questions, so feel free to ping the
list, or email me directly if you have more questions / problems.

I hadn't heard of anyone using server-side Javascript until I heard
about this (yet to be released but still cool) Javascript Rails port.

I use Rhino in my web-based document design system for post
Merge processing on a per-temlate basis, it allows each
Template to specify how post processing should happen.

I works fantastically and is very very fast for an
Interpreted language.

There is however an irony in using an interpreted language
(Java) to parse and run and interpreted language (Javascript).

Subject: [PLUG] Bind9 Views - One Size fits One
Message-ID: <200802041821.13260.mikeraz@patch.com>

I'm configuring a new DNS server for a new domain using bind9's views feature to provide distinct answers depending on whether the client in on the local net or not.

This is not new to me, on ns.patch.com views have been running fine for years.

On the new server ns.michaelsnet.us every client gets the external view.

This is puzzling because:
  - no error messages appear in the log file when I load bind
  - an `rndc dumpdb -zones internal` creates a file that contains the expected name<->IP addr matches.
  - even the name server itself is served the external view
  - dig shows ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 3, ADDITIONAL: 3  and the address from external 

Fortunately (?) the "wrong" results are the public ones, so Internet clients can still attach.

I'm running out of diagnostic ideas.   Suggestions?

I ordered mine  I from jr.com.  It shipped immediately and I got it in
a couple days.  I ordered the 4gb  model because JR had it in stock.
They seem to be one of few places in the US that claim to carry the 8
gb model which I would have preferred, but it was temporarily out of
stock and would have taken too long to arrive.  Unfortunately, I
needed one quickly.  On the other hand, I am very very happy with the
machine I got so I can't complain.

We have had to do some speaker rescheduling.
It looks like we need to move

Scott Lewis to March 2008
and
M. Edward (Ed) Borasky to April 2008
and
Justin Breithaupt to May 2008

This leaves us without a speaker for Thursday night (Feb 7, 2008).
Would anyone like to fill in?
The first one to "apply" wins the task.
I will be traveling tomorrow, so I probably won't be able to send a
confirmation until Wednesday, but people should be able to decide
among yourselves if multiple people offer to speak.

I've bumped it to 8 and turned on query logging.  
Query logging shows the requests match the "internal", unless I'm having negative hallucinations:

view "internal" {
        // This should match our internal networks.
      match-clients {
            199.88.144.0/24;
            127.0.0.1;
        };
... rest of config
};

Feb  4 21:53:24 eye named[24619]: client 199.88.144.12#34385: view global: query: www.michaelsnet.us IN A +
Feb  4 21:54:24 eye named[24619]: client 199.88.144.2#34612: view global: query: www.michaelsnet.us IN A +

Uh, whoa.  I don't have a "global" view.  
Well, of course I do, it's right there in the log.

Sequencing is significant.
Becuase the "global" was defined by the (distrubtion supplied) conf file first with match-clients { any; };
everything matched there and was never referred to the internal section.

Lesson:  when setting up you named.conf files for bind9 save the anys for last.

Drat... I'm in town, and was planning to attend, but I don't really have
anything new to talk about ... YET.  I'm writing up my Seaside talk for
Advanced, but it's also not done yet. :)

I could tell jokes, or something, with the goal to be to keep the

Randal,

It sounds like it would be a pain for you, so let's wait to see if
someone else has something together.

David Mandel

P.S.  I have a plone talk, but I'm reluctant to give it, because it
still needs some work and I won't have much time.  Also, we had a
plone talk a few months ago.

I'm running out of memory on my laptop, which is partitioned with
openSUSE

install of openSUSE 10.3 so I can use the whole hard drive. I don't even
use Windows on this machine, and I want to experiment with formatting
the entire hard drive. Anybody know of a good utility I could use to do
this? Any warnings? Thanks.

Formatting does not satisfy proper wiping conditions.  It merely wipes
the file system data structures holding information about how to
access your files.  It's like freeing a pointer, but the data is still
in memory.  Your next call to malloc() might get you the same chunk of
data back...

Dan,

   To a large extent the answer depends on what you have on your hard drive.
If the data (separate from applications) is not sensitive or useful for
identity theft, then you'll be OK with reformatting the drive. OTOH, if
there are data of a sensitive nature (personal or business) then you're
better off running Darik's Boot & Nuke (DBAN) on the drive.

   It's like shredding papers before putting them out for recycling. I use a
1/4" Bostich shredder I bought about 18 years ago. There's no need for me to
buy a 1/8" cross-shredder because the people most likely to look through the
roll cart are drug addicts, and they're not going to spend the time and
effort to scan all those 1/4" strips and put them back together in the
proper order to get an account number.

   Use the level of security appropriate to the data and who might want it.

Short answer: no.

Long answer: formatting (e.g. mkfs) doesn't overwrite the data. It
merely re-recreates the filesystem.  Think of the filesystem like an
encyclopedia with an index and entries (files) written on
non-consecutive random pages.  For example, if you were to look up
"cow" in the index, the entry may be on pages 1, 15033, 130, and 1297.
 Reformatting your encyclopedia would be equivalent to wiping the
index and renumbering the pages.  The pages themselves still contain
the entries, it's just very difficult to find them or make sense of
them without the index, but not impossible.  A true wipe (e.g. shred
or wipe or dd if=/dev/zero ...) would be equivalent to replacing all
the text with spaces or random characters.

Regards,
- Robert

Retract that lesson.  With the reordering, everything is seeing the Internal
definitions.  Most very broken.

New Lesson:  I still don't know what's broken.
Secondary Lesson: After "fixing" check what used to work.
Tertiary Lesson:  Do not test things at night after a yoga session that has

It's possible.  While researching my problem I saw references on how to do just
that.  Didn't record them as it wasn't related to my problem.  Sorry about that.

In a related subject...is it possible to do zone transfers of different
views, while using the same IP (I had planned to address this at some
undetermined later time, but this thread reminded me that I do need to
address it eventually)?

Here's the case:

I have two views setup on two different domains each: public and
private, domain.tld and sub.domain.tld

I have two DNS servers, each at a different site and therefore different
circuits, networks...etc.  One server is master for domain.tld and slave
for sub.domain.tld, while the other is master for sub.domain.tld and
slave for domain.tld.

Each site has an internal IP scheme while also having a public one too.


I would like to do zone transfers of each view of each domain.  I've
gone through various docs for BIND9, but did not find anything that
addresses this specifically.

The only work-around I've come up with is to have a VPN setup between
the two sites (which will be happening eventually anyway) and do two
zone transfers: one using the external IP for the public view, and the
other transfer using the internal IP (routed through the VPN) for the
private view.

Is there a more elegant solution for this?

I love talking about how lame MetroFi is, backed up with real live

"plowed-ground" at this point.

   The ground may be plowed, but it needs to be disc'd before you can plant
the seeds. Several passes over the same ground prepare a better planting
medium.

    Nothing shows up in my procmail log so I'm pretty sure it isn't one

Forgive me if I'm wrong..but for 500 bucks and using Ubuntu 7.10 w/LAMP and
Webmin you could get something a lot more robust than an 1.2ghz w/512mb ram
and say an 80gb harddrive (because they offer a selection of 40-160gb.)  I'm
all about local businesses and I think it's great they are in Sisters. But I
picked up a Quad 2ghz with 1.5gb RAM and 2x200gb hard drives for about 200
bucks on craigslist. and I installed Ubuntu 7.10 LAMP with Webmin, it's cake
using the Ubuntu Perfect Setup Guide.

http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_server_ubuntu7.10

Just some thoughts--I mean it IS small...but who cares if it's a server?
Just stick in the closet or under the desk. /shrug

All the best,

Aaron

Makitas work too, and so do DeWalts. There's also the ever so popular 
thermite.

Subject: [PLUG] Sudo Access to application accounts...Some thoughts please??
Message-ID: <D04DAF1C0FD50A4F96F51B5AF2E8922D16E416@BWPW05.f2.enterprise>

Hello All
I am seeking some comments on my sudoers file snipped below..
 
What I am trying to do is allow several select users to administer their
applications using a local application account and avoid having to give
the user either full sudo access or the passwd word to the application
account..
 
In other words..I want to force user 'droberts' to run the command 'sudo
su - molnet-app'  which would switch the user over to the molnet-app
account from which the app work can be done..
 
Problem though is this..
How is it possible to partition the responsibility of say applications
A,B,C and D to 'droberts';  Applications A, E, F and G to 'phil' and
applications A,B,C,D,E, F and G to my root admin person 'eric'..
 
I have figured it out for a single group to admin all the app accounts
(see my sudoers file below) but how can I do something as described as
above by using the sudoers file without adding additional GIDS?  Does
the sudo file support a hierarchy of rights for example?
Does anyone out there have any examples they could forward or have
suggestions!
Thanks for any advice!
Sincerely
Dan Roberts

Well this is a 6.9" X 4.9" X 2.3" box that would be placed in the garage 
on the wall near the POTS and internet lines?  I have several full size 
boxes that will run trixbox 2.4.2 but nothing I feel good about placing 
in a kind-of dusty area.

Does the molnet-app account give access to run a number of apps for
example A,B,C,D? I don't think after phil has ran "sudo su -
molnet-app" it is possible to say, "Well you were originally phil, so
you only get access to A and B".

I think one way you could do this is to have a sudoers like:

droberts SCDMAPPSERVERS= (molnet-app) A, B, C, D
phil SCDMAPPSERVERS= (molnet-app) A, E, F, G
eric SCDMAPPSERVERS= (molnet-app) A, B, C, D, E, F, G

where the apps are a full command like if A was "/usr/bin/MolnetAcmd [A-z]*"

Also from the sudoers man page "Wildcard matching is done via the
POSIX fnmatch(3) routine. Note that these are not regular
expressions."

After that if phil wanted to run A, he could use the command

sudo -u molnet-app /usr/bin/MolnetAcmd start

Might not be the best solution but maybe this will get the ball rolling.

Otherwise maybe you can make an account for each app.

Those look awfully similar to the DMP eBox systems, which you can find
for an awful lot cheaper than $500-600, even if you have to supply
your own hard drive.

There seem to be several firms re-branding the eBox systems.

Yes I've seen these and some others but they kind-of lean towards the 
desktop.  Plus none of these offer dual NICs.  Not absolutely a 
necessity for the Asterisk box but nice.

Subject: [PLUG] make sudo act like "su - foo ..."
Message-ID: <200802061148.44052.ewilhelm@cpan.org>

Update: I mostly answered my question while writing this, so I'm mostly 
posting it as a matter of interest and in case someone has suggestions.

I'm trying to find a compact but secure way to configure sudo to allow 
running a command as a specific non-root user.

I might be missing something, but "sudo -u foo command" doesn't get me 
the same results as "su - foo command".  Is -H all I need?

The idea is that anybody in the 'stowpan' group can run the cpan shell 
as the 'stowpan' user, but they can also pass arguments.

  %stowpan ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/su - stowpan /usr/local/bin/cpan, 
    /bin/su - stowpan /usr/local/bin/cpan *

That does what I want, but it is awfully wordy.  (the first command spec 
to allow zero arguments to `cpan`, and the second to allow one or more 
arguments.)

The following has the right permissiveness, but means one could also run 
a 'cpanfoo' or 'cpanbar' program:

  %stowpan ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/su - stowpan /usr/local/bin/cpan*

So, the '*' wildcard has to be part of an argument -- it can't stand 
for 'zero or more additional arguments allowed here'.

Of course, this much lockdown (in this particular case) is moot because 
cpan has a 'look' function that will get you a bash shell, so the 
security really stops at:

  %stowpan ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/su - stowpan

But again the implies-some-number-of-arguments sense of '*' comes into 
play.  I have to write it as:

  %stowpan ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/su - stowpan, /bin/su - stowpan *

So, what's the equivalent to 'su - user ...' via 'sudo -u user ...'?

  %stowpan ALL=(stowpan) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/cpan,/bin/bash

That seems to work when invoked as:

  sudo -H -u stowpan cpan
  sudo -H -u stowpan bash -l

Does that sound right?  Suggestions?

The '-i' switch seems to get more of an 'su -' sort of behavior, but 
skews the interface a bit:

  sudo -i -u stowpan bash
  /bin/bash: /bin/bash: cannot execute binary file

Whereas 'sudo -i -u stowpan' gives me a shell (and 'sudo -i -u stowpan 
cpan' requires that I have bash in the allowed commands.)

Sure they do:

  http://www.wdlsystems.com/modperl/view_services.cgi?r=detail&prod_num=1EBOX53&aisle_id=1002

  http://www.wdlsystems.com/modperl/view_services.cgi?r=detail&prod_num=1EBX452&aisle_id=1019

My point isn't to endorse any particular supplier, but rather that all
of these systems appear to come from the same manufacturer. Might as
well look for the best deal.

Eric, I *think* sudo -H is all you'll need to make sudo -u similar to su -.

As for the arguments, the thing that always screws me up is that
wildcards aren't regular expressions, they use fnmatch which doesn't
seem to be the best for matching arguments. Or maybe I just don't use
it right.

Thanks.  I must have missed the dual LAN looking at the list.

I will do some more looking.

To clarify

Molnet-app is the GCOS name for a specific UID on my system that I use
to install the molnet applciation..
The same holds true for Applications A,B,C,D,E and etc..

Lets say that the application account names are A-APP, B-APP, C-APP and
so on
So I would want for example to give
Droberts the ability to to su to A-APP, su B-APP and etc
While 
Phil could only su to E-APP and G-APP for instance..
While my super admin could su to all the given app names above..

And when the user su's over to the given application account such as
A-APP the person then can run whatever command is required to
maintain/setup the application to which they just sudo'd to ..
I hope this helps clarify my situation and question a bit
Thanks

Does the molnet-app account give access to run a number of apps for
example A,B,C,D? I don't think after phil has ran "sudo su - molnet-app"
it is possible to say, "Well you were originally phil, so you only get

I think one way you could do this is to have a sudoers like:

droberts SCDMAPPSERVERS= (molnet-app) A, B, C, D phil SCDMAPPSERVERS=
(molnet-app) A, E, F, G eric SCDMAPPSERVERS= (molnet-app) A, B, C, D, E,
F, G

where the apps are a full command like if A was "/usr/bin/MolnetAcmd
[A-z]*"

Also from the sudoers man page "Wildcard matching is done via the POSIX
fnmatch(3) routine. Note that these are not regular expressions."

After that if phil wanted to run A, he could use the command

sudo -u molnet-app /usr/bin/MolnetAcmd start

Might not be the best solution but maybe this will get the ball rolling.

Otherwise maybe you can make an account for each app.

I have a talk about using Cruisecontrol and Ant to build Elcipse plugins in
a continuous integration environment. It's short and pretty basic ... I've
given it once and not sure anyone listening learned anything new.

Randal,

It sounds like it would be a pain for you, so let's wait to see if
someone else has something together.

David Mandel

P.S.  I have a plone talk, but I'm reluctant to give it, because it
still needs some work and I won't have much time.  Also, we had a
plone talk a few months ago.

Subject: [PLUG] Kernel 2.6.24 build on T61
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0802061530380.4852@shadow.bitmine.net>


I'm trying to do a kernel build for my T61 in order to get the 
(theoretically more) stable wifi driver and generally make it work like I 
would how I would like it to work.

Unfortunately, I get a kernel panic on every build I've tried.  Message 
follows:

BIOS EDD facility v0.16 2004-Jun-25, 6 devices found
VFS: Cannot open root device "sda6" or unknown-block(0,0)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option; here are the available 
partitions:
0300	4194302	hda driver:	ide-cdrom
Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root ofs on 
unknown-block(0,0)

Now, this seems pretty obvious to me, but the fix has been elusive.

My assumption here is that this is what's going on:  The SATA 
controller driver isn't loading (it's requiring a module or something that 
can't load until the drives are mounted).  Sound reasonable?

It says the only devices available are ide-cdrom, but I'm at a loss as to 
figure out why.

The Debian-built kernel works fine presumably because of the initrd image 
that holes a massive crap-pile of drivers that's loaded before the hard 
disk is mounted.  (By the way, that seems like an amazing piece of magic 
to me.  How the hell do you read the kernel and initrd image from a disk 
controller whose driver you don't have loaded?  But please don't get 
side-tracked by this question, I'm dying to figure out what's going on 
here.

I can attach my .config, if anyone wants to grep it.  But let it suffice 
to say for the moment that I am definitely building the kernel with SATA 
support and all of the intel chipsets related as non-module kernel 
components.

Man, I have math to do.

Did you make a new initrd to go with your new kernel? If you install
the kernel by doing "make install" I think it does this automatically.
If you installed the kernel image manually then you have to make the
initrd yourself.

   mkinitrd /boot/initrd-2.6.24.img 2.6.24

And then add it to you grub.conf following the same pattern as your
stock Debian kernel.

The mkinitrd utility is *supposed* to add whatever modules are needed to
boot your machine. If not then either there's a bug in mkinitrd (unlikely)
or as you suspect the correct modules weren't built in the first place.

FWIW, Ubuntu Gutsy works on my ThinkPad T61.  You may want to look at
how that kernel is configured to make the wifi work under Debian.

I have problems similar to this all the time.  It's typically me and my
overly-lean attitude toward kernel configuration.  I often nuke an IDE
option or two that are critical to the initial bootstrapping process.

In your case, did you compile the SATA options all into the kernel
itself?  If not, that's certainly going to be a problem if you need to
boot off of them.

I often do not use an initrd image at all.  Not needed in most cases
with lean kernels.  I don't have time right now to look through your
config, but if you continue to be stuck, kick me an email off-list and
I'll try to look.

HTH,
tim

Oh ok, if you have accounts for each application then you can do
something like what you already have but rather than giving a group
access to commands, you could specify the users.

droberts SCDMAPPSERVERS=/bin/su - A-APP, /bin/su - B-APP
phil SCDMAPPSERVERS=/bin/su - E-APP, /bin/su -e G-APP
eric SCDMAPPSERVERS=/bin/su - A-APP, /bin/su - B-APP, /bin/su - E-APP,
/bin/su - G-APP

Apparently I've been spoiled by too much X11 use.  I can't remember 
how to generate a key sequence like C-M-% (query-replace-regexp) in a 
standard terminal session.  Is it possible?  Note that control-% 
doesn't really exist in a standard ascii, but characters like 
control-\ do.  Thus C-M-\ (indent-region) isn't a problem.

What command would droberts have to type to become A-APP?  Would it be
"sudo -u A-APP su -"  or "sudo -u A-APP -i" or something else?

if sudoers looks like this:
droberts SCDMAPPSERVERS=/bin/su - A-APP, /bin/su - B-APP

then the command droberts would type to become A-APP would be:
"sudo su - A-APP"

if sudoers looked like this:
droberts SCDMAPPSERVERS=(A-APP, B-APP) ALL

then the command would be something like:
"sudo -u A-APP -i"

I'm not really sure which way is better.. Maybe someone comment.

I find the second format cleaner.  They seem functionally equivalent.  Are they?

This isn't really an answer but: "M-x query-replace-regexp" works, or
if it doesn't (it didn't for me in an xterm): "ESC x
query-replace-regexp" should.  Or, remap the command to a different
key-sequence your terminal can generate.

Are they?

Seems to me that the former approach may be ripe for abuse if not
carefully configured and tested.  Finding a way to slip a stray
parameter to su could lead to privilege escalation.  I'm not up to speed
on how sudo handles various special characters when comparing commands
against the configuration, so couldn't tell you how one would go about
attacking it, but it just smells funny to me.  I'd definitely shoot for
the latter approach.

HTH,

Subject: [PLUG] lcd care and feeding
Message-ID: <200802061646.20654.ewilhelm@cpan.org>

Hi all,

Does anyone know what the implications are of power-cycling an LCD 
backlight?  I've heard that one should not turn a CRT on and off too 
frequently because it reduces the life span.  1)  Is that true? and 2) 
does it matter so much with an LCD?

I'm considering replacing my screensaver with:

  xset dpms force off

(Suggestions of how to make that happen in kde land?)

Interesting facts:

1) My samsung 20" LCD draws 0.38A (about 0.44kW/hr), which is a bit over 
one-third the power (1.05A) used by an idling AMD 6400+ with an 80+ 
(certified) efficient power supply (idling at 1GHz down from 3.2 with 
the powernow driver in the 2.6.22-3-amd64 kernel.)  (Disclaimer: 
current measurements taken with an analog clamp-on amprobe on a 
ten-wrap (mail me a digital meter if you're concerned about 
precision :-D .))

2) Contrary to my previous belief, the LCD panels actually suffer from 
something like "burn in", though it is just a cell memory and not the 
permanent burn that you get with a CRT.

Eric,

   I have never used a "screensaver." Instead, I specify that the screen
blanks. That saves the screen and is not at all distracting.

   With my first LCD monitor I turned it off at night because I could see the
glow when the lights were out. Burned it out in no time. Hitachi was good
about a replacement, but now I just leave it on continuosly.

> I'm considering replacing my screensaver with:

   I don't force it off, but the screen blanks in 10 minutes of no keyboard
or trackball action, then it goes into sleep mode after a half-hour.

HTH,

Rich

Eric,

It is rare indeed that I have anything to offer which might help someone as 
expert as you--I am a novice.  BUT, I have the following notes from my early 
attempts to set dpms.  Maybe they still apply.

-Denis

(following done under Dapper Drake)

To set the DPMS (Display Power Management System) time values, do not use 
kcontrol or systemsettings.  Those create a new xorg.conf file lacking the 
required Option "DPMS" entry and use the same time for all three time settings. 
  In addition, the time settings do not survive logoff/logon.

Instead of trying to use the GUI methods,  add an Option "DPMS" entry in the 
Monitor section of xorg.conf.  Make the desired time entries in the ServerFlags 
section, such as:
  Option  "StandbyTime" "2"
Option  "SuspendTime"  "3"
Option  "OffTime"   "5"

These times are in effect after reboot, but just kde logoff and logon does not 
read these times.

Other DPMS notes:
  xset q reports times and status, xset dpms force off turns the monitor off, 
xset dpms 120 180 300 sets the same times as the example above (but xset 
settings do not survive a restart of X.)

The file $home/.kde/share/config/kcmdisplayrc has times settings as above, but 
seem to have no effect.

Message-ID: <47AA5750.1070609@verizon.net>

All,

I have a laptop that has been running Ubuntu Gutsy without problem for a 
while.  I wanted to play in KDE and installed the desktop.   It made a 
mess of my menus (editable I realize) and Kstars did not run stable.  So 
I uninstalled the KDE desktop and installed the few programs that I 
wanted, allowing apt to install the dependencies.

So, the other night I got a wild hair and installed Kubuntu on another 
partition.  The install went well and it updated.  I then rebooted the 
computer back to Ubuntu and it won't load telling me that /home is not 
to be found.  Kubuntu is using it, so I know it physically exists.  
Ubuntu just can't see it now.

My assumption was that since it is a separate partition, they would 
share.  My bad (?)

Can someone please explain what happened, is what I am trying to do 
possible, and how do I fix Ubuntu so that it sees my home partition.

Thank you!

Bruce

Russell,

Let's plan on having you do the "how lame MetroFi is"  talk.
Sorry, I took so long to reply, but I have been on the road and just got home.
Have been without much communications for a couple days.

And then some time in the future, maybe Ted couple do the talk on
using Cruisecontrol and Ant to build Elcipse plugins.

If I understand correctly then you have/had a /home partition running under
Ubuntu. You installed Kubuntu on a separate partition using the pre-existing
/home. Upon booting the previously installed Ubuntu you don't have access to
your /home? That sounds odd. Kubuntu and Ubuntu should have no problems
sharing a /home as long as they both have the same UIDs for the users. Did
you check the /etc/fstab under both?

At Freegeek they use a six pound hammer, which I have heard referred to as
'Mr. Smashy'.  They also use a utility called 'badblocks' which has
been on the few rescue CDs I've looked at (makes four passes, writing
bytes to all disk blocks in such a way that all bits are flipped at least
three times, I think).   In this thread somewhere it is suggested that
 'urandom > <raw-device>' will suffice.

The output of "mount" run on both installs would help a lot.

Turning it off burned it out?

My meter shows off, suspend, and standby all exhibiting the same 
behavior:  the draw drops to 0.1A for a few seconds and then to about 
0.01A.

My question is whether using a blank screen/screensaver is worth it at 
all instead of just going straight to standby after e.g. 10 minutes.

Incidently, blank screen saves no power (though I guess it would prevent 
ghosting.)  Actually, a black blank screen uses more power than a white 
one by about 0.02A (during normal operation the meter is below black 
and above white.)

Thus, if there's nothing wrong with the extra power cycles, 30 minutes 
of blank screen to the tune of 30W hardly seems worth it.

I don't really know what to make of your Hitachi story though -- are you 
saying you left it blank during the day and manually turned it off at 
night because the suspend would never kick-in?  I could see how that 
would run out the clock on the backlight.

Well, `/etc/init.d/kdm restart` or Ctrl+Alt+Backspace after logout 
typically does the trick to reload X without a reboot.

>xset q

Interesting:  mine shows that standby is set for 600 and my kmcdisplayrc 
has displayPowerOff=10.  So, either there's been some information 
duplicated or kde is still honoring that setting (but no longer making 
it accessible in the kcontrol gui.)

Given the quickness with which an LCD can suspend and resume, it seems 
like the default should be to just turn it off.

I really can't find anything about the implications of power cycling 
though.  (Google hates me:  today it has decided that all of my queries 
should be answered by the patent office (is that a step up or down from 
having all of the results point to my own svn/email?))

   It was probably the current draw when turning it back on. For whatever the
reason, it quit working. The replacement lasted a couple of years before the
power supply died. I keep the replacement Asus monitor on all the time, too.

   "Worth" what? The screen will go blank when I'm on the telephone a long
time, when I take a lunch or dinner break, or otherwise not actively use the
system for 10 minutes. It comes back up quickly. It also comes quickly to
life first thing in the morning, so I suppose it makes no difference in
responsiveness what mode the monitor was in.

   I'm not concerned about power. My primary reason is to not have spurious
images moving around the screen. My secondary reason is to prevent burn-in
(which may not be an LCD issue).

   No, suspend activated, but there was still visible light. Naively, I
thought it was a Good Thing(R) to turn it off. Turns out it wasn't.

Boot kubuntu and run this script:

The backlight in current LCDs is a fluorescent tube(s), although I see 
that Samsung has some monitors that use LED backlighting($$$).  With 
the fluorescent tube, I suspect it's probably not a good idea to 
increase the number of on/off cycles.  I'd set the timeout such that 
the backlight stays on longer than your average interruption.  With an 
LED backlight, power cycling should be less of a problem.

40 watts.

Is your standby light blinking when the screen goes blank?  If not, your 
computer is sending it a grid full of black pixels (and with the lights 
out the screen glows a bluish-black.)  That's 40W of black.

I think the "modes" you're seeing here are "on" and "off".  My LCD does 
only one thing for all three of the dpms suspend/standby/off modes.

Eric,

   I see no modal difference. I agree that it is either on or off. If there
are different off states, they're not visible.

As I recall, kcontrol had settings, but either they did not work at all, or they 
only worked for duration of the X session.

The most stressful time for a power supply is turnon - cheap designs
really strain to get all the voltages up to the right values, and 
sometimes the wrong voltage comes up first, straining some of the
components.  Good designs have extra margin and proper sequencing,
and that is true for CRTs and LCDs and PC power supplies and
everything else.  I wish I new how to determine which brands used
good designs, but it is likely that "happy family mixed vegetable
brand" power supplies fail quicker.

There are two wearout mechanisms for LCDs.  With the right kind of
pattern (alternating black and white patterns at half the refresh
rate are particularly nasty) the LCD chemicals end up getting
pushed to one of the electrodes in the pixel and sticking - this
is called "electroplating" but is a little different than the
metalization process.  Sometimes electroplating is reversable,
sometimes not, depending on the design - leaving the display off
is a good way for the LCD chemicals to diffuse back towards original
conditions.  

The other wearout mechanism is the backlights - usually one on top
and one on the bottom for large desktop LCDs.  The backlight is a
fluorescent lamp tube, quite similar in behavior to the ones used
for electronic ballast commercial lighting, though very thin and
fragile.  The lamps are treated much more gently than the lamps in
most lighting fixtures, but they will wear out, perhaps after 10K
to 20K hours.  They get dim and turn greenish or pinkish as they
age.  A skilled technician can replace the lamps, but it is very
tricky work.  There are designs on the drawing boards that replace
the fluorescent tubes with high brightness LEDs;  those can have
lifetime problems too, but would be easier to replace.

So, over all, it is probably best to idle the display when you are
not using it.  It will save some millisalmon, and make the device
last longer.  If the power supply is properly designed, power cycling
will not reduce lifetime either.

Keith,

What do you mean by idle?  I power mine off completely (that is, there is no 
juice at the power plug) when the computer is not in use.  Problem or no?

Thank you for the responses.
I will respond to each of you when my wife isn't in the middle of 
ordering for the produce co-op, probably this weekend.  I have to figure

Thanks all for the input.  Denis, maybe this summary helps:


a.  hard switching (e.g. powerstrip/unplug)
  power:  zero power use
  life:   depends on power supply quality

  Every time you apply juice, the power supply and/or other components
  get a bit of stress.


b.  power button (on monitor bezel)
  power:  zero or near-zero power use
  life:   fluorescent backlight on/off too often reduces lifespan


c.  soft-off (e.g. dpms suspend/standby/off)
  power:  near-zero power use (about 1W?)
  life:   fluorescent backlight on/off too often reduces lifespan


d.  screensaver/blank screen
  power:  same as (or more than) normal usage
  life:   consumes backlight lifespan

So, assuming 15k hours of lamp life, we better turn off the backlight 
for a good portion of the day if we want it to last more than 2 years.  
Turning it off for 8 hours at night saves .5 years.

I wonder what the trade-off is on lifespan in switching the backlight 
off 3-5 times per day if that gets the running time down to about 6 
hours per day.  Would it be reasonable to expect 15k hours of lamp life 
with 10k on/off cycles, or would that drop the lamp life to e.g. 10k 
hours?  What about 10-15 times per day?

Looks like I'll find out in either 2.5 or 6.8 years.  At that point, it 
will be time for LED backlights anyway, right?

For now, I've got dpms set to suspend the monitor 30s after the screen 
blanking -- I figure I'll wiggle the mouse if I'm still sitting at the 
desk when it goes blank.

There are at least two ways that I am aware of:

$ hdparm -z {device}   # only for non-SCSI devices
$ echo "w" | fdisk {device}

Both as root or using sudo.

That's disappointing.  CRTs last tens of years.  Assuming normal people will
replace rather than repair the flatscreen under these conditions CRTs being to
look much greener.

Does this help?

Q:

How can I make a server a slave for both an internal and an external view at the
same time? When I tried, both views on the slave were transferred from the same
view on the master.
A:

You will need to give the master and slave multiple IP addresses and use those to
make sure you reach the correct view on the other machine.

Master: 10.0.1.1 (internal), 10.0.1.2 (external, IP alias)
    internal:
	match-clients { !10.0.1.2; !10.0.1.4; 10.0.1/24; };
		notify-source 10.0.1.1;
		transfer-source 10.0.1.1;
		query-source address 10.0.1.1;
    external:
	match-clients { any; };
	recursion no;	// don't offer recursion to the world
	notify-source 10.0.1.2;
	transfer-source 10.0.1.2;
	query-source address 10.0.1.2;

Slave: 10.0.1.3 (internal), 10.0.1.4 (external, IP alias)
    internal:
	match-clients { !10.0.1.2; !10.0.1.4; 10.0.1/24; };
	notify-source 10.0.1.3;
	transfer-source 10.0.1.3;
	query-source address 10.0.1.3;
   external:
	match-clients { any; };
	recursion no;	// don't offer recursion to the world
	notify-source 10.0.1.4;
	transfer-source 10.0.1.4;
	query-source address 10.0.1.4;

You put the external address on the alias so that all the other dns clients on these
boxes see the internal view by default.

It's from http://www.isc.org/index.pl?/sw/bind/FAQ.php

True. And the Bind documentation agrees.

Now resolved.

Twofold.
1) if you FU and send your "internal" RFC1918 (or other unroutable address) view
to your external DNS slave hope that you can get someone on the other end to
manually intervene.

2) Don't do anything you'd be embarrassed to admit to PLUG.

Boy, this hurts.  I was converting a test box into a production box.  Text box had
lots of unneeded software.  My clean up run was not complete.  dnsmasq was running
and responding to update requests from DNS slaves.  It cached the internal view
AND the internal view's list of authorized slaves.  External slaves were barred
from transferring updated zone information.

Side effect from all this:

I rented a virtual server instance from Gandi.net and set it up as a DNS secondary
for the afflicted domains.  I now have a self controlled DNS server in France.
It's a Xen hosted "share" and I had choices of Fedora, Centos, Ubuntu, Mandriva or
Debian.  End to end setup from the vendor side took less than an hour and I can
scale the Xen instance up or down to meet needs.   This is probably similar to the
Amazon virtual server arrangement.  I'll refrain from saying how cheap it is.

I tried partprobe thanks to your suggestion, but it looks like it
won't report the one drive because it doesn't have any partitions on
it.

apt-file search partx

doesn't find it in any package...  There is a kpartx, but that seems
to be for raid, and other virtual partitions not real partitions.  I
tried it none the less, but it didn't seem to help.

Some are.  Mostly, they set up satellite links through commercial
services, because the end users in the field are *not* licensed amateur
radio operators, and they need more information than can fit on a
typical shortwave link.

Humaninet tries to make it so the people on the ground at a disaster
site can focus on medicine and food and shelter, not on radios,
communication, and transport logistics.  Emphasis on logistics;  they
want to minimize delays and hassle for the field people ("can you get
1000 winter tents purchased and shipped to Katmandu in 24 hours?")
rather than provide calls home for the lonely (though that is very
important, too).  They mostly rely on fixed-base support in the US.
It is easier to shop the web or negotiate with bureaucrats from an
intact operations center in Portland, than from a disaster site in
rural Indonesia.  Still, the field people need a lot of information,
so the satellite links facilitate that, with the fixed-base folk doing
most of the searching and arranging where it is easier and cheaper.

I'm not directly associated with them, but I have been to a few of
their events, and I admire their competence and audacity.

Hi Kevin and PLUG,

A long time ago, I wrote to the PLUG asking questions about DNS.  At
the time I was a bit overwhelmed by all the responses.  I set aside
reading the email responses for awhile, and looked at them again.  I
understand better now.  I guess what I want to do is not mess with DNS
initially, as you indicate in your email below.  I realize now that I
don't have to set up my own DNS server in order to use apache.  I just
use somebody elses DNS server(s).  I want to use DynDNS with Comcast
as you do.  You say you installed a start-up script.  Are you
referring to ddclient or inadyn as shown at:

http://www.dyndns.com/support/clients/unix.html

If you use one of these start-up scripts, which one do you prefer?

When you say you run a cron job, are you referring to crontab as shown at:

http://www.learninglinux.com/modules.php?name=News&file=print&sid=57

Can you be specific with regard to what would be a good cron job command?


I tried this DynDNS stuff a while ago, but I didn't know what I was
doing.  I think I did apt-get install ddclient on my debian machine.
At one point, the program ran me through some dialog boxes asking me
to set some configuration options.  Some of the configuration stuff, I
couldn't figure out.  I've gone from blind to semi-blind now.  I'm
wondering if in one of the dialog boxes, I set up a cron job, or if
it's the case that I configure whatever it is that I need to configure
with the dialog boxes, and when I'm done, I then set up a cron job.

Any feedback would be most appreciated.

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

The simplest summary is: Metro-fi says they comply with the contract, but even
so, are out of money, and are probably having second thoughts about giving
away a bunch of stuff for free.  Some Local Geeks say they aren't even close
to complying (with data to back it up), and it's hurting everyone as a result.

And there are some URLs for fun and education.  And a good time (and a nervous
laugh) was had by all.

I don't hate MetroFi, but I do have some information about ways
MetroFi doesn't live up to its own claims.  Most of what I talked
about last night is at least mentioned on the website in my signature.

Message-ID: <200802090836.05792.mikeraz@patch.com>

I'm migrating the home network to new systems and using the process to review how I do things.

Google doesn't show a maildrop vs procmail discussion here.

By default I'd just stick with procmail.  I do see enough mentions of maildrop to give it some consideration.  

Factors to consider:
  postfix is the MTA
  virtual domains will be implemented for domains I host and if possible all the mail
  must play well with mailman and sympa

I'd like your feedback on the local delivery options.  Especially: 
   what am I missing out on if I stay with procmail 
   what gotchas I need to be careful of if I go with maildrop
   what option am I overlooking

Reserved disk space.  Assuming ext2/3:

$ sudo tune2fs -l /dev/sda1 | grep -i res

Look at the -r or -m options to tune2fs to adjust the reserve block
count/percentage.  Careful, though.  The reserve is there for a
reason.  Use that up and you may lock your system.  Might want to
consider a Gig or so for reserve.

Each file consumes exactly one inode, no matter what the size. So depending
on your file sizes you can run out of disk space before running out of inodes,
or the other way around.

But either way you're not really out of space. The 100% means that there
is no space more space available to non-root users, but for root
there is 6G available. This is determined by the reserved block percentage,
which if I recall correctly defaults to 5%. The reserved block percentage is
to prevent non-root users from filling the disk to the point where root can't 
even log in.

i've filled up several (non-system) filesystems with no lockups.  it's
definitely a problem in /tmp, /var, and maybe /, but not /usr/local or
/mp3 (or your filedump du-jour).

And I forgot to mention . . . 

How did I manage to fill the disk?

It provides an nfs mount.  I rip CDs on another system and copy them to this
one via the nfs mount points.  nfsd is running as root so files transferred to
the nfs exported directories aren't restricted by the reserved limitation.  An
unprivledged user can then write until the partition is 100% full.  Nice DOS
if you have a sensitive partition NFS shared.  This would apply to any
partition where a service needs to write tmp files.

Which raises the question:  do you partition your drive or just have a all
encompassing root?  If it's all one big one consider that LVM has taken 
the pain of wrongly sized partitions out of life.

Good point to clarify, although the OP's mountpoint was root:

But YMMV.  One simple test would be to fill the filesystem up with "dd
if=/dev/zero of=blank.file" and see if the machine still boots.  If it
does, then you know it's not a problem.  If it does not boot, then you
know it is a problem.  Boot with a Knoppix CD to remove the
blank.file.

I'm kind of old fashioned and kind of new fashioned:

i typically have a minimal / that i mirror on a separate disk for easy
disaster recovery, and the rest of the disk goes into /spoo or
/usr/local (and i religiously tune2fs -r 0).  then i try like hell not
to fill / =)

this has required some creative linking on a few systems where i
underplanned (my original gentoo setup needed less than 300M of system
files, but it balooned once i started using it as a desktop), but it
works out ok, and the big win is that when i reinstall, i say "yes,
reformat /" yet my data lives on.

i don't use LVM on PC's, since i might theoretically want to move the
disks around, say to a windows machine.  i love LVM on machines i
won't ever want to move the disks around on, though.  it was just
about the only saving grace of my time with AIX 3..

the old days of separate /var|/tmp/|/boot are fondly remembered but
not so necessary for the most part in these days of huge disk.  sure,
occasionally some looping service fills up /var (which is part of /)
with logs, but i tend to notice pretty quick when that happens.  i
haven't had any filesystem corruption in many moons.  i'm going to
blame ext[23]fs for being good to me and my hardware for being
non-flakey for that one.

the cool thing about unix is that there are still room and reasons for
every philosophy under the sun.  my way seems to work for me and my
employers =)

Subject: [PLUG] MS Access -> ? for OOo
Message-ID: <20080210150028.6334ce8d.johnxj@comcast.net>

I have a file containing about 5,000 records in MS Access 2000. I have
not needed to access this data for over a year, but suddenly I need to
again. The last time I did it I used OOo on Linux, which could read and
merge the data I needed. However, I just tried it and it no longer
works. I asked on an OOo e-list and was told that support for the .mdb
file format had been dropped from the Linux versions of OOo. I find
this rather unbelievable (why, if it was working before?), but so be
it. I guess it is time to get the data out of Access and into something
else. The database contains numerous queries, sub-tables and forms, but
they could all be recreated. The main table is the important part.

I know next to nothing about databases. I have heard of a number of
different databases - mySQL, etc. Which would be the best for a dummy
who just needs to merge data into OOo Writer documents, a la mail merge
(but more involved)? 

Also, does anyone know if there is anything in Linux-land that can read
the Access data?

Never mind. Kexi did the trick. Lost the queries and forms, but all the
tables are there. Now all I have to do is see if I can get OOo to see
the Kexi database.

Did you try an older 1.x version of OpenOffice?  That may work...

oobase?

mdbtools, oobase, m$ access via wine?

   Step back a bit, if you can, and learn something about database systems so
you can make an informed decision. SQLite would probably work for you, but
you'll need to learn SQL and master the simple command line interface. Yes,
CLI! But, it works well.

   Yes, there is. <http://mdbtools.sourceforge.net/>

   If you're going to be using databases to any extent, I highly recommend
Rick van der Lann's "Introduction to SQL, 4th Edition."

Thanks for all the suggestions. I installed mdbtools, but there is no
documentation for it. I guess you're supposed to be born knowing how to
use it. 

I already had Kexi installed (part of KOffice), so I gave it a shot.
Happily it opened the MS Access database just fine. It lost the queries
and the one form in the Access file, but all of them are really simple
and easy to recreate. It's a GUI, so it makes it much easier for
dummies to use. In fact, it's very Access-like.

However, OOo can't seem to grok the Kexi file any better than it could
the Access file. I don't know what's the matter with OOo and databases.
It's easy to merge data once you get OOo to read the database file, but
you have to "register" the database with OOo before it can read the
data. And the registration process is hopelessly unintuitive. 

I also tried KWord and I can't find the right buttons to get it to see
the Kexi database either. <sigh>.

Oh well, at least I've got the data out of Access into an open source
file format. I did discover that I can export the data as .csv from
Kexi and OOo can read the .csv file. However I'm not sure I want to
keep my data in .csv format. From past experience there are problems
with delimiters when you need funny characters in a field (and I do
that a lot).

I'll keep poking at things. Meantime further suggestions are welcome.

Another tidbit to tickle the brain with:

Log of fsck -C -R -A -a

fsck 1.40.2 (12-Jul-2007)

fsck died with exit status 8

I noticed this when I booted into Ubuntu this morning.  The UUID doesn't 
seem to match to anything I saw in gathering the requested information 
already posted.

Did the installation of Kubuntu change the UUID of /dev/sda5 aka /home?

csv is well-defined for funny characters -- if you have problems with
a file either the file is corrupt or the csv implementation is
inferior (there are *lots* of these, unfortunately, so your argument
may well be sound based on that alone).  Generally csv isn't sufficent
for most people simply because it only stores values (duh) this is
probably not an issue for a db dump, but if you have spreadsheets,
then you should know (or realize?) that csv does not persist formulas.

Another problem with .csv is getting it merged into an OOo Writer
document without the quote marks and with the field delimiters - and
all merging as it should. OOo does not remember the settings from the
last time you merged data, so you have to go through and carefully tell
OOo what the delimiters are. And the default delimiters are
non-standard - e.g., it uses a semi-colon for the field delimiter, so
as not to conflict with the comma, which it thinks should be used for
the thousands separator. If you need to merge data into OOo, then .csv
will drive you nuts.

OOo Base would be perfect, but the Linux version cannot read MS
Access .mdb files. Kexi can do so, however. But then OOo can't read
Kexi data either - evidently Kexi uses "SQLite format 3." According to
the literature OOo Base is supposed to be able to read SQL and open
document formats, but SQLite doesn't seem to be on the list. At the
same time, the only format Kexi can export to is .csv. Around and
around I go.

The Access database file contains 43 tables, now happily residing in
a .kexi file. Originally the Access file had numerous queries as well,
but those didn't survive the import into Kexi. I had it set up in
Access so that one table ("Worktable") would be the table that all word
processor merges worked from. Then I had a query to delete all data
from Worktable, and numerous other queries to add data to it. Lots of
times I would quickly create an ad hoc query when I needed specific
records, always merging the records to an empty Worktable, and from
there into OOo Writer. I did all the querying and all the data editing
from within Access. I can probably replicate the workflow with Kexi,
but there seems to be no way to merge data out of Kexi into a word
processor without exporting as a .csv. I can't even get KWord to merge
data from Kexi. Kexi gets rave reviews, and I have to agree it is
really easy to use. But it's like the Roach Motel - data checks in, but
it never checks out.

Kexi is also very fast, while OOo Base is uniformly lambasted in
reviews as being pathetically slow. I did bring in the one .csv file
(5,000 records) and tried a simply select query. It took roughly four
minutes. I did the same query in Kexi and it finished in less time than
it takes you to read this sentence.

My problem is that the database contains test questions that must be
merged into a word processor so that styles can be applied to the
different parts of the question during the merge. For example, the
indents and tabs for the stem must be different from the indents and
tabs for the answers. The only way to accomplish this is a merge into a
word processor that supports styles. But i can't find a common format
that everything likes.

The nice thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from.

Those appear to be the same fstab files.  Can you run this from
Kubuntu and post the contents of output.txt:

true ; (

Looks like you posted the same output.txt twice.

Can you run the script again from both environments?

Probably.  And you'll probably find that UUID in the fstab on whatever
is the root filesystem for Ubuntu.

   That's SQLite version 3. The internal format did change from version 2.

   If Kexi stores the data in an embedded sqlite database then you're ahead
of the game.

   There's probably a Ubuntu package for SQLite-3.5.5 (that's the latest
version, released last week and it uses registers rather than the stack).
Install it. Look at the file names that kexi uses; there should be one that
represents the database. On the command line, type:

sqlite <filename> [Enter]

   Once the database is open, look at the help file to see all the ways you
can look at the database:

sqlite> .help [Enter]

   You can change the separator, export the file using different delimiters,
and so on. You can see the tables using the .table command, check the schema
for a table using the .schema command, and so on.

OK, I did all that. sqlite3 is version 3.4.2 listed in Synaptic, and I
installed it. I did as you said above and the .help command listed all
kinds of things I could do. However, I did not see anything in the list
of options that I could not do just as easily from within the Kexi GUI.
>From the command line the only export option is still .csv. And
the .schema command just shows the design of a table, also easily
viewed and changed from within the GUI.

I did export my largest table as a .csv (setting the field delimiter to
semicolon) and then used it to merge into OOo. However, in OOo all I
can do is merge from the .csv; I can't find any way to open the .csv or
import the .csv as a table in an OOo Base document. If i can get it
(and my other tables) into Base then I can perform queries and stuff on
the data. And Writer will merge from a query as well as a table (at
least I think it will), which is handy. 

Part of the frustration is the user interface for Base. There are no
definitions for all the options when connecting to or opening a
database. For example, there is a long list of connection types (ADO,
JDBC, ODBC, and several more) and no information as to which one should
be selected for which application's files. As you go through the wizard
there are five or six pages and each one has numerous drop-downs with
similar incomprehensible choices. And at the end you discover that
evidently you chose something at the beginning that led Base to think
that you wanted to connect to a database on another machine over the
network, but when you go back through the pages you can't find the
option that led you down the wrong path in the maze. It's like the
telephone menu system at the IRS.

I'd actually prefer to use Kexi in its GUI incarnation. It seems very
intuitive to me, although that is because I am somewhat familiar with
Access and Kexi is very Access-like. However, I can't figure out how to
get any of my three word processors to see the Kexi file for merging,
not even KWord. Very strange, that.

Thanks for the suggestions. I'm still poking around for a solution.

Truly every seasoned Unix sysadmin has their reasons for their quirky
partitioning schemes.  Mine typically are some variation of the
following (in order):


[swap]
/ 
/var
/var/log  (optional, typically on servers)
/tmp
/usr
/home


Reasoning:

- I believe there are some important security reasons why /home should
  be it's own partition if it's a multi-user system, particularly on
  Linux[1]. 

- Of course having swap at the beginning of the disk makes it marginally 
  faster.  This is the same reason /var goes toward the beginning.  

- No reason to use /boot nowadays IMO, since grub is great and doesn't 
  have size limitations for finding kernels.

- I'm old skool and like to have /tmp separate from other filesystems
  for various reasons; mostly security paranoia that may not be
  necessary.  I generally mount /tmp with restricted setuid features. 
  Nowadays my distros typically create their own RAM filesystems for
  /tmp, so that could be just as effective.

- It's handy to have /var separate so it's a little faster and so you
  can mount it with different sync options if you're worried about
  file/filesystem corruption.

- I find /var/log handy as a separate partition when you've got a
  mission-critical server with valuable logs.  I've forgotten to have
  one or two services rotate logs properly and ended up with corrupt
  files (such as MySQL databases) a few too many times.  You can also
  have /var/log/mounted as sync and noexec which is nice. 


HTH,
tim



1. I'd have to dig up some old mailing list threads to explain why.  No,
   it's not because of filling-disk DoS attacks either, but attacks more
   sinister... It's related to the fact that any file in a given user's
   home directory can have it's ownership changed by that user.  Combine
   that with file hard-links on the same filesystem and nasty stuff can
   happen.  I think there are measures in place to prevent this, but not
   so long ago I remember a thread describing an effective attack to
   take control of files in /usr, for instance.  Don't quote me on it.

How comfortable are you with scripting languages? It sounds to me like 
you have the database part under control as long as you abandon all hope 
of bending OpenOffice.org to your will. :) The rest of it -- generating 
printed documents, reports, etc. -- sounds like something fairly easy to 
do in one of the scripting languages, like Perl, Python or Ruby. All of 
them have very user-friendly interfaces to databases, including SQLite, 
and all of them can generate PDF documents. If you *must* have a 
Microsoft document format, there are probably libraries available to 
make them, but I've lived comfortably with PDFs for years.

Subject: [PLUG] Clearwire WiMAX in Oregon City
Message-ID: <47AFDBAA.5060500@telestream.com>

I got a letter on my doorstep from my neighborhood association leader 
describing the horror of a "cellular antenna" wanting to be put up a 
couple blocks away from me. The letter indicates this is from the 
company Clearwire and is for Internet access.

So, I'm thinking the basis of the letter I got is not wanting a large 
cell tower site on a corner block of a residential neighborhood. But 
after a caffeine backed google power session, I couldn't find a photo of 
a WiMAX base station (proper term?), which I presume this what we're 
really talking about here. Is a WiMAX site similar to a cell site? I've 
seen some impressive and creative methods used for disguising cell 
towers, and am thinking such methods would apply to anything similar. 
But I can see the knee jerk reaction for the idea of the typical cell 
tower site. Anyone have any pretty pictures? Also, are there nice 
monthly incomes for WiMAX sites like there are for cell sites on private 
land?

Also, does anyone have any questions they could offer that would be good 
for me to ask? We're having a community meeting on this on Wednesday. 
I've read up on WiMAX a little, but am not sure if there are any good 
practical questions that should be asked.

I'm confused.  None of the fstabs you posted have
'UUID=147d9d2f-f064-4efe-861b-31bd8b720da4' anywhere in them.  What
makes you say that UUID refers to /dev/sda6?

I think you can assume that a WiMAX tower is going to be pretty much
indistinguishable from a cell phone tower.  It'll operate in slightly
different frequencies.  Ask clearwire or the local land-use officials
for a rendering of the proposed tower.

I need the files in some kind of word processor format - OOo, KWord,
AbiWord or even RTF. As long as the file format supports at least
paragraph styles I can use it. The reason is because the data will have
numerous different destinations. One might be Scribus, one might be
Adobe InDesign, and occasionally even a local laser printer. However,
the text must still be editable when it gets into Scribus or InDesign,
therefore PDF will not do. Furthermore, I have massive additional
formatting that I must perform on the files before they end up in
Scribus or InDesign, all of which I do with macros in OOo. 

However, I have zero - and I mean absolutely zero - knowledge of
scripting or anything else requiring computer codes. I have tried
programming and I find it impossible to understand. I'm sure I could
learn, but the learning curve would be massive and I don't have the
time now. Besides, this is the only place I'd probably ever need it. It
would be a ridiculous amount of effort for me.

I do have one final backup strategy - open the database in MS Access
which I have installed in Windows 2000 that is running under
VirtualBox. In Access I can create queries to select the data, then
merge it into OOo/Windows. OOo/Windows does have the ability to merge
directly from an MS Access file, as did previous versions of OOo on
Linux. And eventually that capability will be restored to OOo/Linux.
But I steadfastly refuse to do it in Windows unless there is no other
reasonable way. I've got the data in Kexi / Sqlite3; it ought to be
possible to merge it into *some* word processor on Linux.

Thanks for the further thoughts, but let's forget about scripting.

I believe the KWord-specific format has been deprecated.  I've noticed
current versions of KWord can load other formats, but will only save
to standard and open formats now, like ODF.

I can assure you that's not true ;) Many of your questions over the
years have pointed out excellent examples of UI bugs that Unix/Linux
hackers have happily been scripting around for decades.  You're one of
the few users who has the patience and tenacity to beat these
situations around until the (often times meager) tools will solve your
problem.  If you ever want a job in QA, just show the interviewer your
PLUG history ;)

That said, I would solve your problem with LaTeX and some scripting.
(probably in Haskell, but that's personal preference.)  Learning to
use scripting languages is a lot like learning how to use duct
tape--you can do *anything* with it (even if you shouldn't ;).

> It would be a ridiculous amount of effort for me.

This, however, is true.  I don't think it'd be as bad as you expect,
especially with some tutelage though.

You really must learn LaTeX some day though (LyX is a good way to
start -- it's WYSIWYG) I think you would really enjoy how it separates
the content from the formatting, yet still does the formatting
perfectly.

For your problem, it looks like it *is* possible to get to OO Base to
load an sqlite db:

http://documentation.openoffice.org/HOW_TO/data_source/SQLite.pdf

It doesn't look *that* hard, but probably not a 5-min job.

LaTeX cannot handle OpenType fonts. That is a showstopper.

I did install Lyx once a couple years ago. It hijacked file
associations for damn near everything, including .txt files.

I tried the above PDF instructions, but couldn't get it to work. I note
the file is three years old. That long ago OOo/Linux could read an MS
Access .mdb file directly. It was only recently that someone decided it
wasn't broke so it needed to be fixed.

The above PDF file gives links to drivers and other files, but they are
all 32-bit. I found most everything in Synaptic, however. But I don't
know if the version I installed is the right one. And some of the links
in the PDF are broken.

I think it may be possible to get OOo to work with Kexi, but it's going
to take more up to date information than that PDF file. Unfortunately,
the only source of information for KWord and for Kexi are mailing lists
with practically no traffic.

   OK. Use that.

   Actually, that's not so. If you change the mode (.mode) you can select
columns, one value per line, and other output formats. To write the results
of the SELECT statement to a file, use the .output option to specify the
file name. (When you're done, reset .output to stdout and .mode to list.)

   If you select the questions, or whatever in the table you need to put into
OO.o, then save them to a file, the results could be either imported or
cut-and-pasted into your processed word document.

Looks like /home is mounting just fine.  Is everything working with
the shared /home?

As for the fsck issue:

Looks like then all you need to do is change the entry in the fstab
under Ubuntu to this and you should be good to go:

UUID=fb59a69d-99aa-4555-9964-589dea15f426 /media/sda6     ext3
defaults        0       2

Let us know how thing work out.

I haven't had issues like this before and haven't had to tweak things to

Subject: [PLUG] Help needed setting up Apache and PHP
Message-ID: <105849.12771.qm@web84106.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I am trying to get PHP set up with Apache and having problems. I installed the LAMP server on my Ubuntu 7.1 running laptop. I also have zoneminder installed, I have been asked to look into zoneminder for my company. Apache seems to be running, I have webmin installed to ease configuration issues (or so I hope). I tried installing phpmyadmin and it seemed to install correctly. I can't view any php docs on my localhost though. everytime I try and load one up firefox attempts to download the file instead of view it. I am pretty sure this is due to my not having Apache configured to load the PHP module correctly but I have not been able to find any documentation that says  "do it this way stupid!" Could someone tell me what I should have in my httpd.conf file in order to get PHP started up? Currently that file is empty.

Jim

I believe this is what you're looking for?

   1.

   Edit Apache's configuration file /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf and
   add the following lines:

       #
       # This next section will call PHP for .php, .phtml, and .phps files
       #
       AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
       AddType application/x-httpd-php .phtml
       AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

       #
       # This is the directory containing php.ini
       #
       PHPIniDir "/usr/local/apache/conf"

    If a LoadModule line was not already inserted by the PHP install, add
   it too:

       LoadModule php5_module modules/libphp5.so

No - just symlink the php5.load and .conf files from mods-available to 
mods-enabled and restart apache.

cd /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/ && ln -s ../mods-available/php5.load && ln 
-s ../mods-available/php5.conf && /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

So in the mods-enabled directory, they look like:
php5.conf -> /etc/apache2/mods-available/php5.conf

I just got a call from Jax.  (Where we hold the Advanced Topics meetings.)

They are wanting to know if we can change the meeting nights back to
Wednesday.

They no longer have the jazz nights on Wednesday.  Evidently business has
been slow enough that they are wanting to close on Sundays and Mondays in
order to save on labor costs.

Is that going to work for people?

And, no, I still do not have a speaker for the Feb meeting.  (I have one
for March.)

I'd prefer Mondays to Wednesdays because Personal Telco has its weekly
meetings on Wednesdays, but ... I'd prefer Wednesday to having the
meeting on the sidewalk.  So, I guess, Wednesdays are fine here.

	tips/pointers requested
Message-ID: <1202771095.2222.16.camel@denkiteki-penpen.easystreet.com>

I'm trying to make a wireless access point using CentOS 5 with an
Atheros based WiFi NIC (Atheros Communications, Inc. AR2413 802.11bg NIC
(rev 01)) and using the madwifi drivers from ATrpms.net
(madwifi-0.9.3.3-39.el5).

Basically, I'd like to know what other people have done and if they have
any tips/pointers.  I'd like to keep as close as possible to doing
things "the Red Hat way", as that (I'm assuming) should limit the amount
of complexity in maintenance and reproducibility.

I have briefly looked at hostapd, and may create a package for that
eventually (all software needs to be in a package, that way things can
be trivially reproduced), but I'm not sure I need that much
functionality.

I'd like to be able to run multiple networks/virtual interfaces on it,
starting configuration will be routed not bridged.


Questions, Comments, Screams-of-outrage, moral or immoral indignations?

This sounds like you're using a full/existing PC.  Way overkill.

I use a mix of Netgear and Linksys WRT54GLs with OpenWrt.
Routes, bridges, firewalls, and much more or much less, it's up to you.
All with a tiny energy and space footprint.  Fanless too.

Atheros is a good chipset choice, though only time will tell if they
manage to get it more stable.  I've used an Atheros card in my laptop
for many arcane purposes.

At first I thought you were joking, but then I realized you were
serious... =P  Not a fan of Red Hat here, or any distro based on it.
But to each his own.

I have only used hostapd for running APs.  It is probably going to be
the easiest solution if you want to do anything more complicated than
unencrypted networks.

Note that while the Atheros drivers can in theory run a multitude of
virtual interfaces of different types, this is often not the case in
practice.  There are often problems when trying to create several
virtual interfaces of different types.  For one thing, you have to
create them in a certain order.  I have found trying to run an AP at
the same time as a STA interface (client) is quite unstable.

I can't say that I'm an expert on the drivers and such for this.  The
primary purpose of my use of it was to perform penetration tests against
corporate networks (yes, these were sanctioned, legal, we got paid,
etc).  We would set up the Atheros card as an AP and lure unsuspecting
laptop users into connecting to our "AP".  From there we'd attack
desktops directly.  It's remarkable how foolish Windows is with
selecting networks to use even when laptops are also connected to hard
lines... 

In any case, I've only ever tried creating a single AP at a time.


> Questions, Comments, Screams-of-outrage, moral or immoral indignations?


In terms of managing the services you'd need to run for this, I'd
recommend using something like daemontools[1] or runit[2].


Good luck!

I'm using an old Dell, and it's very silent.  I started using a PC
because I have a routed subnet in addition to some internal routed
networks and I didn't even want to attempt that with a "consumer" level
piece of equipment; the wireless NIC will be another interface with
routing/acls for internal and external use.  Yes, it may be over-kill,
but this new firewall/router I'm building has 5 ethernet ports (4 port +
1 port cards) and a wifi card (mostly for future expansion) :D

In the past I had thought about having a modem card for auto-failover,
but I haven't ever needed it really to date (my current hardware has
one).  I've also thought about adding DUN to it too so I could dial into
it...but that too I don't think I'd ever use...

lol.  For me, it's "The Devil I Know" (TM).  I've used RH-based distros
for a long time now...it actually is what I cut my teeth on when it
comes to basic linux usage.

My work also uses it (CentOS), so I've had no real external push away
from RH/Fedora (in fact, I've spent the past several months moving more
deeply into this version of the Dark Side, with the culmination just
occurring recently: I'm a signed Fedora Contributor, working on my first
official package).

Sounds like that's what I'll need to do then...

Hmmm...I'll have to keep that in mind.  I have room for more cards, so
if I ever need to be a client also I may fore-go running it over the
same card.  Mostly, I was thinking about running two access points over
it: one secured/restricted with access to internal resources, the other
open and throttled with access to only the outside world.

I'll take a look at those tools too.  daemontools sounds awfully
familiar (RH/Fedora isn't my only exposure...)

Thanks for the tips.

Cool.  Well I've always been a fan of the Debian half of the Linux
distro tree. "Back in the day" Red Hat used to be such hell to manage
with package dependencies and such while Debian's was much better
thought through.  I'm sure they're quite a bit more similar nowadays
though in that regard.

I haven't tried it, but my guess is that having two VAPs alone on an
Atheros card should work fine.  As you grown the number of VAPs, I would
question the quality of speed/reliability you'd get, but 2 is a pretty
small number.  I think the biggest VAP restrictions come into play when
you start using clients (STAs).  You may only be able to use one of
those at a time.  I think it's also chipset model dependent with regard
to the restrictions.

It is always good to have a meeting place in reserve.  However, Jax
has been very good to us, and the space is the best we have had so far.
When the transit mall construction is complete, there is likely to be a
lot more street parking available and this should help their business. 
And if the "parking" myth does not convince you, the "increased
accessability by light rail" myth might. 

So I think we should accomodate them, and perhaps help them drum up
more business for the other days and nights.  If they want to stay
open late one Thursday a month, we could consider moving the General
Meeting afters to Jax.  Perhaps we should also connect them up with
the folks at O'Reilly that are planning OSCON; that room would be
nice for offsite parties.  Eventually, we will print more PLUG cards
with corrected information.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0802111828280.3045@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I want to create a letterhead as an .eps file for inclusion in LaTeX
documents. The typeface is BakerSignet. Years ago I spent too much time
trying to understand and follow the long, complicated procedure for adding a
new Type1 typeface (in four fonts) directly into LaTeX.

   The OO.o pdf generator is not Adobe-compliant, so ImageMagick cannot
convert the pdf to eps. I don't have that typeface installed in The GIMP or
Xfig, and don't know how to add additional typefaces to those apps, anyway.

   Does anyone have suggestions for creating a PostScript text-only file?
That can be encapsulated with 'convert' easily enough. I don't know enough
PostScript to create the letterhead using PS primitives.

If, indeed, the problems at Jax are temporary we should stay.  The room
works wonderfully.  My comment was an encouragement to be prepared for their
closure to extend beyond Sunday-Monday.

Rich,

Do you have the CUPS/PDF driver installed.  I just converted one created 
by it using ImageMagick.

I've done this before.  It's not totally crazy, however there are at
least a couple reasons why you might end up somewhere else in the
solution space.  First, radio propagation from the back of a metal box
tends to be suboptimal.  Even attaching an antenna on a short coax is
going to be suboptimal because of signal losses in the thin coax.
Second, in my experience, madwifi-ng can be unstable, kernel panicking
from time to time.  I'd rather have an external device doing the
kernel panicking myself and let my wired traffic alone to do its nice
stable thing.

I would recommend instead to find an openwrt'able access point, maybe
with an atheros radio already, and bridge that to a wired ethernet
port on your router.  That will let you place the radio just where it
best covers what you want covered.  A meraki indoor is inexpensive
(circa $50), uses an atheros radio, PoE'able, and is reflashable,
though the reflashing procedure is complex enough that I haven't tried
it yet.  There are other alternatives.  See the openwrt.org wiki for
details.

Rod,

   Let's see what happens .... Well! D'oh! Print the pdf to file using xpdf,
then use convert. Sheesh! Don't know where my head was when I wrote this
yesterday, but it was certainly not bolted on properly.

   Now I can trim it, just as soon as I find the appropriate ImageMagic tool,

Thanks for the clue stick,

Something to note:  just recently, the version of xpdf I am using with
Debian unstable had some kind of bug that caused it to generate broken
postscript.  I was able to print pdfs using lpr, but couldn't print from
xpdf due to postscript errors.  Something to watch out for in the
future, as I have yet to find a resolution for that (besides going
around xpdf for printing).

I have once in a while had problems printing PDFs from KPDF as well,
and not just recently. It happens very infrequently, but often enough
that I simply use Adobe Reader 8.1 instead. Also, Adobe Reader 7 or
later is still required if you need to fill in PDF forms. 

You might try Okular, a fork or something of KPDF, which can fill in
text boxes now on PDF forms, although not all the other types of
controls. I have found it to be really useful for converting PS to PDF
because the converted PDF appears right in the window immediately.
Also, I haven't had any problems printing from it (so far). I think
it's still in development - part of the new KDE. But even if it isn't
finished it's stable and the parts that work seem reliable.

Kris, did you get any further?  And which of the four "net boot"
options in the BIOS were you using?  None of them is explicitly "PXE",
though the first three bring up what looks like a PXE boot status
screen (Intel copyright 1999!).  I'm getting no network activity

   I have a different issue with the default xpdf version in Slackware-12.0.
It refuses to start, but then works just fine the second and subsequent
times. Go figure.

WDL Systems was great in swapping out the 2300-sx's for 2300's.  Even
with the client recycling all the packaging.

The 2300's are a bit slow, but one of the main uses was to run some
tutoring software via Windows 2003 terminal server.  We lowered the
resolution and tweaked some GUI settings to get things drawing a bit
quicker.

Amusing is that rdesktop running on these provides a snappier GUI
experience (in Windows 2003) than the native Gnome desktop. :)

Sorry to the few of you who offered to help and I didn't reply.  We got
approval of the RMA for the new 2300's at the last moment and then it
became a hectic race to the deadline, which was made on time.

I noticed a new ebox-4300 which is the same profile as the 2300 but a
bit faster (and Via, unlike the 2300sx).  The price isn't that great yet
($231).

After this adventure, WDL was great in helping us out and I can now
highly recommend them for embedded hardware.  We're soon going to be
testing a setup with the 2300 + built-in wireless.  I'll keep the list
updated.

Subject: [PLUG] db auditing and LINQ
Message-ID: <007b01c86db5$3fcd33a0$bf679ae0$@net>

Last week at the Lab I was talking with someone about db auditing and LINQ.
There's some discussion going on at the padnug yahoo group about LINQ and db
auditing.

Whoever I was talking to at the Lab said that db auditing and LINQ did not
work together, but I don't have enough experience to comment on that. But
I'd like to participate in that discussion and there's one beginning on the
padnug site. Here's a comment that I "sort-of" understand but would like to
understand better.

<start quote>

MySQL triggers are activated by SQL statements only. They are not
activated by changes in tables made by APIs that do not transmit SQL
statements to the MySQL Server; in particular, they are not activated
by updates made using the NDB API.

On my 2300, Firefox is faster xhosted from my laptop than running locally.
Not sure I'm surprised, though; the thing is ~400 bogomips.

I have a 4300.  It's a sweet box.  But yeah, the price is a bit high.
And now that VIA has announced 64-bit processors that are
die-compatible one can hope that either the price will go down or there
will soon be a much faster machine available in the same case.

Am I wasting my time hoping to get the 2300-SX running Debian?
Eventually I want to put a 160G hard drive in it and use it for NAS
and maybe (with USB audio) to drive my wife's stereo.  So I don't need
PXE-boot to work: that's just the easiest way to install -- or was,
anyway, for my 2300 and 4300.

Thanks,

That is true.
In MySQL you set triggers on INSERT, UPDATE & DELETE statements. So
you have to be passing SQL to the DB for the trigger to happen.

The NDB cluster stuff can become a headache due to the way is handles
the tables rows like "cursors" so it is in effect modifying that
single row rather than a SQL statement like "UPDATE table SET row =
1". Most of the time I have seen code using NDB that also uses
"regular" mysql connection techniques to pass SQL to. The NDB stuff is
nice if you want to access your data like an object, but sometimes its
nicer to just pass SQL to the cluster.

The easy way to get this going would be to use freeNas on a USB drive
as the boot device.
No, it isn't Linux but is really simple to setup and get going for a NAS box.

Ted,

That was probably me....

I can't speak specifically for that topic inside databases in general, but
I seem to recall something about that in some of my reading about MySQL.
Using the API (in MySQL, I'll stay away from other engines) cuts down on
some of the overhead and allows for faster performance (from my limited
reading of the API on MySQL).  I'd love to explore that and confirm it but
I don't have any experience programming any of the database engines using
APIs (my function is as a Production Support DBA rather than a Development
DBA).

That said, from my understanding it makes sense that the Triggers may not
"fire" if updates are made using non-SQL structures.

As a side note, based on our conversations at the Lab, were specifically
that some auditing may not be captured using LINQ and that Views are used
to lock down data to ensure sensitive (or restricted) data is not viewed
directly in a table.  Stored Procedures (and Triggers) can enforce logic
and updates local to the server (reducing network traffic if large table
scans (ugghh) are required or multiple and/or complex look-ups or parallel
updates are required).

If I am the person you were thinking of, we can take this off list and you
can email me directly.

there has been no open source competitor. Well, that has changed. We
now have Kexi, which uses SQLite3. SAQLite3 allows one database file to
contain multiple tables, queries, forms and reports, just like Access.
Its GUI is also very Access-like, making an easy transition for MS
Office users. And the frosting on the cake is that Kexi can import an
Access database flawlessly. (Except that the current version can only
import tables - the rest is still under development - a fact which does
not disturb me because my queries and stuff are simple and easily
recreated.)

So I imported my Access database into Kexi and was pleased to see all
my tables in perfect condition. Next, I needed to figure out how to do
a mail-merge type of operation into OpenOffice.org. I need to merge
into a word processor because each field must be formatted with a
different style. You can't do that sort of formatting with a report
from a database. 

And that is where I got stuck. OOo used to be able to merge directly
from an Access database, and it worked perfectly. Sadly, it worked too
well, so someone at OOo decided it needed to be fixed. And the result
is that OOo since 2.2 has not been able to read an Access database.
This is what sent me off to find alternatives. And, while Kexi works
beautifully as a replacement for Access, OOo Base cannot seem to read
Kexi data either. The only thing I could do was export from Kexi
as .csv (its only export option) and import each of the 43 tables into
Base one at a time. 

However, I am thrilled to report that, with the help of a kind genius
on the OOo User e-list, I have succeeded in connecting OOo Base to the
Kexi database. The procedure was not trivial - various extra drivers
and libraries to install and get configured. But it now works perfectly
and I am back in business with my data now completely in open source
formats.

I still need to have Windows running under VirtualBox in order to run
Adobe InDesign. But InDesign is the last thing I need Windows for.
Everything else in my life can now be done perfectly under 64-bit Linux
with native Linux apps. And InDesign will someday fall under the open
source axe as well.

I know your pain!  I used to date a graphic designer, and Linux was
not up to snuff with Adobe CS.  However, the Scribus
(InDesign)/Inkscape (Illustrator)/Gimp (Photoshop) combo and becoming
viable alternatives and can even open some of Adobe's proprietary
formats :-)

   No it isn't. You can use a meat tenderizer, a broom, or anything handy. Of
course, if one's not using winduhs, there's no need to even look at it.

Even harder to "beat" is MS Works -- a database with only one table and 
no queries.  Incredibly simple, but a spreadsheet doesn't seem to fill 
the bill (Works DB allows you to view your table as a stack of cards, 
and print it in various simple ways.)  Access seems quite a bit 
different: worksDB also behaves like a spreadsheet, but has just a few 
database-ish features.

Even worse, *nothing* will read the format (not even anything in the 
msoffice suite IIRC.)

This is probably the trickiest bit in migrating my mother to Linux.

Suggestions?  Anybody been there and done that?

I played around with exporting files from worksDB and using OOo, but 
that seems a bit of a steep learning curve.

You could try some of the lighter word processors - KWord or Abiword. I
know KWord can do data merges, although only MySQL. Not sure about
Abiword.

I may have spoken too quickly when I said I could easily recreate my
queries in Kexi. I just spent the past hour trying to figure out how to
design a query (using the GUI) that will delete all records in a table.
The Kexi Handbook is a noble idea, but only five or six pages long at
this point. My Access database had several dozen queries, and I
designed all of them with the GUI. Kexi allows me to create a query
with SQL syntax (I think), but I don't have time to learn how.

Any Kexi users here?

Error message:
The query is incorrect. Syntax error near "DELETE"

It's probably a comma missing, a period misplaced, something is
supposed to be in caps, or not in caps, or on a separate line, or God
only knows. I would get several errors like these on each query I try
to create, and figuring each one out would take hours of googling, all
of which would create mounting frustration. And once I have the queries
made, I will never ever have to create a query again, so all the
knowledge gained is for naught.

See why I don't want to have to learn SQL syntax? Just one error and
I'm already about to throw the whole computer into the river. Grrr.

"SQL for Dummies" is worth the money and time - i still go back to it

Yup.  Give me a handful of examples over the docs they got.

If it's anything like sqlite3, then this might work to delete all the rows:

  delete from <tablename> ;

throw in a where clause to limit the amount deleted:

  delete from <tablename> where <where clause> ;

Still doesn't work. Strangely,

SELECT * FROM worktable

Works fine. But

DELETE * FROM worktable

Gives a message that there is an error near DELETE. The SQLite syntax
website (http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html) gives the example:

DELETE FROM worktable

But that gives the same error message. Adding ";" at the end doesn't
help either. Neither did changing * to "all" or putting it in different
places.

Maybe Kexi didn't implement all of SQLite syntax. Maybe it never
occurred to them that someone might want to empty a table. I joined the
SQLite e-list and asked there, but it doesn't appear to have much
activity.

If you just want to nuke a table entirely, you can

DROP TABLE worktable;
CREATE TABLE worktable(

.
.
.

);

or you can leave the table structure in place but delete all the rows with

TRUNCATE TABLE worktable;

The database has 43 tables in it. All but a handful have exactly the
same structure. The reason is so that records can be selected from
various different tables into worktable without worrying about field
data mismatches. There is a reason (lengthy) for using different tables
rather than one massive table with a selector field with 43 different
codes. The structure of all these tables includes 23 fields using half
a dozen different field types (numeric, text, max length, etc.).
Recreating worktable would be a pain. In fact, I created it by using a
maketable query in Access a long time ago out of one of the other
tables, then deleting all records from it and renaming it to
"worktable." I suppose it could be recreated with a query, but if I
can't even get a bonehead DELETE query to work I'll never be able to
get a create table query to work.

I tried the following:

TRUNCATE table worktable;

With and without the semicolon and with and without "table," and got 

*The query is incorrect
Syntax error near "TRUNCATE"

I didn't try DROP TABLE yet because I didn't understand how CREATE
TABLE works. Recreating all the fields and their properties would be a
pain. I suspect CREATE TABLE requires a lengthy list of fields and
their attributes. And if I can't even get a DELETE statement to work,
I'm not holding my breath on CREATE TABLE.

week and won't be able to make it.  Sorry for any and all confusion.  If

Try that again?  Perhaps your semicolons haven't caught up with you yet 
(and/or maybe close the program and start with fresh ram -- you might 
have managed to twist one of the internal knobs too far.)

Perhaps.  If it really starts to hurt, maybe drop into an sqlite shell.

Well, I got a response from the Kexi e-list I subscribed to last night.
Kexi has a feature Edit > Delete all records in table. So I can just do
it from the menu, although you have to open the table first before it
works. It's a solution, but it still bugs me that a simple DELETE query
can't be made to work. 

Now I'm trying to create an insert query using the GUI and that isn't
working either. The Kexi Handbook has all of three paragraphs on how to
create queries. Creating queries is sort of important when working with
databases. :)

Not only is the GUI not working (either because it is broken or because
I can't figure it out), but SQL statements are also impossible to
figure out. I can see that it's going to take a long time to get this sorted.

   If you're getting wrapped around the axel and not getting done the work
you need with your data consider sticking with Access. It's all GUI,
displays and manipulates your data and doesn't ask you to learn SQL or a
CLI.

   If the process is more important than the end results, then continue as
you are. If the end results are what you really need before the end of the
decade, stick with what you know and like.

I'm looking for alternatives that will allow me to migrate the virtual win98

Well, it is looking like this month is going to get canceled.  My speaker
has backed out.  Unless someone wants to speak on the 20th and gets ahold
of me in the next hour, I am going to just try again in March.

You know, I certainly wouldn't mind spending the time discussing what we
want out of Advanced Topics. Rather than scramble for speakers every month,
might we discuss what we would like as a vision or direction for Advanced
Topics? I'm a nitty-gritty person, not pie-in-the-sky, but discussing as a
group what kind of topics or areas or approaches we'd like makes sense to
me.

Actually, both are important, and I would rate them equally.

I have just this morning discovered the source of the DELETE problem,
at least partly. A participant on the Kexi e-list told me "only SELECT
queries work, no DELETE, UPDATE, CREATE queries for now in the gui."
That doesn't explain why I can't get it to work with bare SQL, but at
least I can stop poking at the GUI. The only kind of DELETE I need is
all records in the table, and I can do that with the Edit menu for now.

Having said that I have discovered something else. Way back in the bad
old Access days I needed worktable as an intermediate table. That was
because OOo could merge from a table, but not from an Access query. I
just now tried to get OOo to merge from a Kexi query, and again it
failed to see the Kexi query. However, now that I have the Kexi
database registered, OOo sees all the tables just fine. Plus, OOo Base
has a very nice, robust GUI query creator. I just spent a few minutes
poking at it and quickly created the query I needed. I can merge into
Writer based on the OOo Base query, so I don't even need worktable. 

Ultimately I'd like to do data manipulation in Kexi, but for now I can
create the queries in OOo. I still have to do data editing in Kexi,
because Base sees the Kexi tables as read-only. Theoretically another
option is to move all the tables into Base and just forget about Kexi,
but that doesn't seem to be working. Plus according to all the reviews
Base is extremely slow, and breaks every time a new Java comes out.

I have what I need for now. Thanks to all for the suggestions and
advices.

I'm really happy with VirtualBox. Simple to configure and use, and it's
surprisingly fast.

http://www.virtualbox.org/

I've tried KVM/qemu on a couple of occasions, but it never worked well
for me.

I agree, virtualbox is great!  I have over 20 images that I use, and I
haven't had any problems.

And it's opensource. Even better.

Hope you are doing well Rich!

I only skimmed through the previous mails on this subject, so please forgive
if I'm repeating something someone else has suggested or you have tried. I
also am assuming based onthose posts you know all about the kernel header
requirements and have verified that those are available and in the right
place. Most problems with getting vmware-config.pl to run right (where it
ran right previously) with a new kernel can be "automagically" fixed by
using the infamous "any-any" updater. Google for "vmware any-any-update" and
you will see a number of hits, one of which will likely be a howto for your
particular distro, slackware IIRC.

Failing that, I would try installing VMware Server and/or Player to run
them. Between the two they have most of the features of Workstation, and
since they have been updated since 5.5.3 was released, they play nice with
newer kernels and will likely side-step your problem entirely.

I can second the VirtualBox recommendation. Even a dummy like me had it
working and Windows 2000 installed in it in not much more than an hour
- and I had no previous experience with virtualization of any type on
any platform. To get it to see all my devices and partitions was pretty
much automatic, although a couple times I had to poke at things for a
couple minutes.

I've heard him speak before and he will address lots of plain old SQL issues
and has db experience that extends beyond MS. His talks are free.

   Thank you, Paul. I'll see if it lets me access the existing partition.

Quentin,

   Since I built the 2.6.19.2 kernel from the source tarball, I assume that
everything is in /usr/src/linux-2.6.19.2 and /usr/include.

   Could I use the existing /vm partition with them? That holds the guest OS,
applications, and data.

I second that.  Jax is expecting some people to show up, anyway.

What kinda irks me is that we could potentially get a lot more
contribution.  Only a few of us speak; only a few of us find other
speakers.  The rest probably know /something/ or /somebody/.  I like
seeing all the people show up, but it would be more cool (and less
work for Alan) if some of you worked up the gumption to talk about
something you know about, or invited  a cow-orker or friend or
conference acquaintance to speak to us.

Yeah, it is a nuisance, but when you are old and feeble, what will
you remember most - listening to a presentation, or giving one?
Hell, after a few shots at it, you might find out you are good at
speaking to a crowd;  you will never know until you try a few times. 
If you are not part of the solution, you are part of the precipitate!

I don't know if virtualbox works with vmware images, but vmware
workstation 6 will fire up vmware workstation 4 images.  It's
annoying that the vmware modules have to be rebuilt every time
the kernel is upgraded, isn't it?

Why go with virtualbox over vmware workstation?  Does vmware 
server allow creating virutal machines?

Can you use sqlite3 as a backend for either Kexi or OOoBase?

   Notice that Sun announced yesterday that they're buying the company.

   It's interesting that VirtualBox may support win98. It's reported by
users, but not officially supported by the vendor.

Quentin,

   Think that I'll devote this coming weekend to upgrading my
workstation/server to Slackware-12.0, then figure out how to install VMware
Server or KVM to run the existing installation. The distribution upgrade
requires a lot of hand tuning to return Xfce to the appearance/functionality
it now has so I've been putting it off for months. Really should do it,
though.

Thanks,

Rich

Currently I spend a great deal of time trying to get speakers.  After five
years, you sort of run out.  (I have been getting speakers for five years.
 We have actually been around for a bit over seven years.)  In that time,
I have spoken at least 4-5 time, Randal 8-10 (or more), and Rusel Senior
at least 3.  It gets bloody hard getting new people who are willing to
speak and have a topic they are willing to cover.  (And can speak about
something that is interesting for an advanced audience.)

At OSCON I appreoached over 60 people trying to get speakers.  Of those,
you know how many actually spoke at an Advanced Topics meeting?

     Zero.

Getting speakers is damned hard work.  If someone wants to help, please do.

Recommending topics is one thing.  Helping to get people to speak on those
topics is even better.

Now for the more interesting bits...

I just got  back from Jax.  They are willing to stay open this Monday for
us since it has been such short notice.  I am trying to confirm a speaker
now, but if not I am sure we can come up with something.

March is another thing.  We will want to move to the 19th anyways.  The
third Monday is St. Patrick's day.  (Also known as Amateur Drinking Day.) 
I don't think we want to try and hold a meeting during that madness.

I also spoke to them about moving the PLUG general meeting afters to Jax. 
They do not have a problem with that.  They are willing to stay open late
if needs be on that night.  Do we want to do that?  David? Anyone?

Jax has been real good to us.  They have given us meeting space without
charging us a flat fee.  That is almost unheard of these days.  (Trying to
find someplace with food, booze and meeting space is very hard, having had
the same discussion with all the other groups I am involved in.)  We want
to make sure they get lots of business.

To answer your previous question, yes Player and Server can both run virtual
machines created with Workstation 5.5. Generally speaking, a VMware virtual
machine can be used in any vmware product from the same generation or newer.
To get an overview of how the various VMware products fit together, you can
take a look at the slides from a presentation on virtualization I gave at
the Eugene IT Pro Forum last year. http://itproforum.org. Slide 6 has a
graphic I put together on it showing their different products and at a high
level how they relate to eachother.

Since it sounds like you are going to be in "experimental mode" you might
also want to give VMware server 2.0 Beta a try. It has some nice new
features in it and once again, has the most recent code for kernel
interfacing in it so it should be fairly turn key with even the newest
kernels.

One thing that many source packages assume is that there is a symlink at
"/usr/src/linux" that point to the "real" source directory for the running
kernel. I don't remember off the top of my head if Vmware is one of those,
but adding it (or updating it if it exists already) may ease some
compilation troubles, aside from this.

Tonight or next Wednesday?

it would be nice to hear about what people _want_ to learn.

while I don't share John's opinion of SQL's relative quality, I do want to know
more about it.

For the Public Speaking Adverse, I could give a talk on "What to do when you blow
your preparation and really don't have anything to talk about because you also
broke your project."

But I already did that.

I've considered the following:

  *  Putting You in YouTube (basic video editing, using phone for still camera
shot videos)
  *  iptables for the wary (or fearful) (need a reviewer to make sure I don't give
out bad advice)
  *  Fun With Netgear (collaborate with a couple others, Like Russell Senior -
what to use a Netgear/Linksys/Buffalo for besides a WiFi AP, AKA OpenWRT
Possibilities;  I replaced a desktop PC Firewall with a Netgear)

What I'd be interested in hearing

  * CMSes that don't suck - they all feel like straight jackets to me
  * wiki conversion - moved from/to any combination of: MoinMoin, MediaWiki,
PHPwiki, Kwiki, oddmuse, dokuwiki ...  what worked for you?
  * next steps in _____ - where _____ is any common language or technology where

Quentin,

   That's good to know. Actually, the vm was created with the pre-1.0 betas
and updated (or just used) with every release they sold me until I stopped
buying them with 5.5.3. Workstation-5.5.1 was the last one running, IIRC.

   Will do.

   The latest kernel support is good; nice new features probably of no value
to me. I stopped upgrading MapInfo in 1998 (it runs on the virtual win98 as
it did on win95), and Garmin's MapSource also doesn't need anything newer or
fancier.

   Since I'm not doing spatial analyses any longer, I should just ensure that
all the GIS data are also found on a linux partition and not worry about MI.
If MapSource runs on WINE or something similar, I can use it to load
specific maps to the little GPS receiver as desired.

Many thanks,

Rich

Monday.  This month it is the old meeting night.  (Sorry for the
confusion, but it has been a weird couple of days.  I got hit with the Jax
monday night issues at the last moment.)

What I want to see...

More kernel development talks.

More talks on where x.org and freedesktop.org are going.  (Especially
after yet another abi change in the latest version of X.  Those running F9
alpha know what I mean.)

I should see if I can get Eric to talk about the Fedora project and all
the secret handshakes and other illuminati-type behind the scenes info.

An embedded java/linux talk.  (Especially development on the Motorola
A1200 series of phones.)

GCC internals.

How to create projects using automake and autoconf.

Debugging using gdb.

How Linux handles cut and paste and how applications can access the data.

Assembly language programming in Linux.

PAX and address space randomization.  (Or other anti-exploit techniques
used in GCC and the kernel.)

And probably more given a bit of time to think about it.

http://knihovny.cvut.cz/ftp/pub/vmware/vmware-any-any-update115.tar.gz

I don't know if it applies to your situation or not, though.

That is the "any-any" update that I mentioned previously. Thanks for finding
the link, I was in abit of a hurry and my first shot with Google failed me.
It's not just for 64-bit issues, it generally fixes a number of kernel
quirks which may cause the vmware modules to not compile correctly. It has
become something of a silver bullet in the vmware community. I haven't dug
into it myself, nor have I seen a good explanation of what it does, but it
just about always seems to work...

I have used the Any-Any patch as well.  You want to make sure it is the
current version, but it works in most cases.

You know, we may be missing something important in the realm of user groups.
I once worked in a place where at lunch we alternated giving presentations
about our projects and frankly sometimes it was just that ... I tried to do
this this week and it all fell apart. Presentations need not always be about
success stories. We're a small enough group that people can present
half-baked, half-working projects with unresolved problems. The ensuing
discussion may solve a problem or two.

The thought that only successes need be presented may be a major reason why
speakers are hard to come by.

And SQL is .. well, just SQL ... I am now getting interested in LINQ but
don't know if there is an opensource equivalent to that ... would be nice. 

Alan's topic list is fine ... not my list ... my interests these days are
more in the web site, IDE (eclipse), java,  PHP, database, continuous
integration areas.

Tonight or next Wednesday?

it would be nice to hear about what people _want_ to learn.

while I don't share John's opinion of SQL's relative quality, I do want to
know
more about it.

For the Public Speaking Adverse, I could give a talk on "What to do when you
blow
your preparation and really don't have anything to talk about because you
also
broke your project."

But I already did that.

I've considered the following:

  *  Putting You in YouTube (basic video editing, using phone for still
camera
shot videos)
  *  iptables for the wary (or fearful) (need a reviewer to make sure I
don't give
out bad advice)
  *  Fun With Netgear (collaborate with a couple others, Like Russell Senior
-
what to use a Netgear/Linksys/Buffalo for besides a WiFi AP, AKA OpenWRT
Possibilities;  I replaced a desktop PC Firewall with a Netgear)

What I'd be interested in hearing

  * CMSes that don't suck - they all feel like straight jackets to me
  * wiki conversion - moved from/to any combination of: MoinMoin, MediaWiki,
PHPwiki, Kwiki, oddmuse, dokuwiki ...  what worked for you?
  * next steps in _____ - where _____ is any common language or technology
where
people use the easy 10% and miss out on the benefits of the rest
  * From itch to scratch - how you worked out a solution to some difficulty

If you find no speaker, we could probably do lightning talks.  That is: 
five minutes or so (gong optional.)  You just need several people who 
have a little something to talk about.  It's also a great way to start 
a public speaking habit.

Tim,

   Not. I'm running a 32-bit Slackware; don't need 64 bits for anything. But,
those are the processors that are sold.

The 5-minute talks seem to me like a good idea. We cover a range of topics
(and at least one person is interested in that topic) and we can guage how
much others are interested.

I'm not sure what you mean. Bear in mind that I know zero about
programming and only enough about databases to do a mail merge into a
word processor.

Kexi uses sqlite3 as its format. So how is that different from "as a
backend"?

I also managed to get OOo to see the Kexi data. To do so I had to
install sqlite3 drivers/libraries. Then I had to use ODBCConfig and get
it to see the driver, and then create a User DSN in ODBCConfig pointing
to the Kexi database. Only then was OOo Base able to see the Kexi
database. It would probably take an ordinary person a few minutes to do
this, but it cost me several hours of googling, experimenting, throwing
up, revising my approach, trying again, throwing up again (rinse,
repeat). 

At this point I have a solution that works. I have the data in Kexi,
and I can access the Kexi file with OOo. Kexi is too young yet and does
not have good support for queries, but I can use queries in OOo Base
instead. OOo Base allows me to view and merge the data, but does not
allow editing of the Kexi data. Kexi, however, can edit the data. So if
I need to edit the data I use Kexi; if I need to query or merge it, I
use OOo base. 

It's a clunky solution, but it will get me by until either Kexi gets
better with queries or OOo base gets better with importing tables from
Kexi.

'sudo apt-get install nmap' yields this error message:

Couldn't find rubygems either. Anybody know why?

I'm running in full desktop mode with the default Xandros os.

Thanks.

Not sure if this will help..but when I was playing with an EeePC I added the
repos here:

and installed everything I wanted.

Hope this helps!

Yes, very helpful, as I was just about to add the Debian source version...
According to the link you sent " The official word from Xandros is that
adding Debian repositories will break Xandros."

Thanks!

   In case you're interested, LaTeX can type set linguistic symbols so you
can parse your sentences and make the results look good. Furthermore,
PSTricks has a linguistics diagramming package so you can draw your homework
and have the results typeset.

Let's also point out for those following along that VMware Server and 
VMware Player are FREE.  Download them and get a license instantly on 
the VMware web site.  VMware server installs cleanly and is easy to 
configure, either with the console manager or with config files.

I can attest to VMware Server flexibility and manageability, I needed to 
deploy 12,000 VM's last year so I needed a way to clone one good image 
many times, which VMware provides with the copy-on-write snapshot 
images, and a configuration so each VM get's it's own MAC address and is 
able to DHCP a preassigned IP address (we were running 15 VM's per 
physical host).

This is starting to sound like a good talk for an upcoming meeting...

I prefer TreeForm. The author is a linguist who understands exactly how
X-bar tree structures need to work. Can you say that PStricks is
superior to TreeForm for drawing X-bar trees?

While "ready" is good and even very desirable, it is hardly necessary,
as I amply demonstrated twice recently.

Was that the disk failure analysis talk?  I remember that as being
rather good.

I've been trying to recruit people to talk at PLUG, including someone
to follow up on the nice intel ethernet driver effort with a talk on
intel's wireless driver effort.  That's something I am very interested
in, and have a marginal "in" with a potential speaker on the subject.
Unfortunately, at the moment, they are ramping up and aren't quite
ready to give a talk.

Thanks to Keith Lofstrom's sharp eyes and sharing spirit, I heard
about the Humaninet event in time to attend this evening.  It was
pretty cool, learned a little about humanitarian relief efforts and a
role for geeks, and saw a satellite communications terminal (air time
is painfully expensive, but before all you had was money ... now you
can read your email from the nepalese pucker-brush).  The meeting had
a big turnout of people, lots of whom I hadn't ever seen before,
including a contingent from nten.org, a group I had barely heard
about, but which sounded like "fellow travellers".  Also, i saw at
least half-a-dozen XO's and even got to play with one for a bit.

There is a lot of interesting stuff floating around out there.  Some
of you are probably doing some of it.  Share!  It's easy.  When your
audience has had enough, they'll clap and you can sit down.

Of course, one of the topics for that evening is a real (lunar) 
eclipse, beginning at around 6pm on the east coast and continuing
until 9pm where it will be more visible from Portland:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_February_2008_lunar_eclipse

or

Can you see the eastern sky from the roof of Jax?  There may be 
buildings in the way;  maybe not.  Perhaps we can make
arrangements to look if the view is clear and the sky is not
overcast, or schedule a brief trek to waterfront park.

There ain't no sech animal! :) That's why there are Object-Relational 
Mappers (ORM), Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD), report generators, 
etc. Over the past year, I forced myself to learn enough SQL to do what 
I need to do with some rather large collections of numeric data I've 
saddled myself with over the years, but I find SQL code difficult to 
read and difficult to factor, etc.

If you use MySQL, there's a nifty front end called DBDesigner 4 that 
helps a lot. But in general, many person decades have gone into web 
application frameworks, etc., that present a much saner API than raw SQL.

The last time I was up there the eastern view was pretty clear.  What really
matters is where on the horizon the moon is coming up and if there's something in
the way.

I think the roof at Jax will be better than waterfront park.  The 3rd and Alder
Smart park garage top floor would be better than both.

The good news: I got it running (by Debian-installing onto a
USB-mounted CF card on my desktop, then swapping in a patched kernel.)

The bad news: 94 bogomips.

I was expecting at least 5x that.  The original 2300 has a 200mhz
processor and runs at 400 bogomips, while the new 4300 with its 500mhz
processor runs 1000 bogomips.  Is there anything I could have done in
building my kernel to cause the device to run so far below what I
assumed was its potential?

One thing I do need to check: BIO settings that might be underclocking
it.  Anything else?

Hey, it's a cute device; it'll make a nice paperweight. :-)

Thanks,

What clock speed does /proc/cpuinfo report? It's possible that the CPU
in the eBox supports clock frequency scaling. Digging through
dmesg/syslog might reveal something useful.

One problem I have with SQL is that there seems to be a large variety
of flavors of it, all of which are obsessed with having their commas,
semicolons, periods, word order, etc. precisely the way they want it.
Witness the multiple suggestions I received here for how to write a
delete query. 

Then there is the problem that it requires logic. At the moment my
logic module is pretty toasted from overexposure to linguistic syntax
(algebra for linguists).

But the biggest problem is the documentation. People who write the
documentation assume I know the difference between a "command" and a
"keyword," not to mention various other terms. Understanding that stuff
is like trying to figure out what your algebra teacher is talking about
when you missed the first half of the term.

Even a GUI like Access, Kexi, OOo Base, et al. is difficult to figure
out. But at least you can drag and drop and click on stuff, which
automates the writing of the statements. Thus, even a beginner can get
the commas, semicolons and periods where they belong. It may not be a
lot faster than typing the statements manually, but when you factor in
the time and frustration involved in debugging, the GUI is way faster.

As I said previously, I finally have a solution that works for me. Kexi
(sqlite3) holds the data and I have no problem editing it, creating new
tables, forms, reports and such in Kexi. Its query abilities are GUI
also, but very little of sqlite3 has been implemented yet. Basically,
the only queries you can do in Kexi at this time are Select queries.
That is pretty limiting, but OOo rescued me. After much travail I
managed to get OOo Base to see the Kexi data. Unfortunately, it sees it
in read-only mode, so if I want to edit the data I have to do so in
Kexi. And OOo sees only the tables in Kexi - it cannot see the queries,
forms and other objects. However, OOo Base has a very nice query engine
of its own that is very robust, fully featured, and GUI. You can View
the SQL statement in case you want to, but so far I haven't had a need
to do so. So now I can edit the data in Kexi and create queries in OOo.
Ultimately I need the data merged into a Writer document, and OOo will
happily merge the Kexi data into a Writer document based on a query in
Base. Previously, when I used Access, OOo could merge only on a table,
so I had to create a dummy table that I would insert data into, then
empty after the merge. Merging on a query is much simpler.

Theoretically, now that I have OOo Base seeing the Kexi data, I should
be able to simply move the data completely into Base and forget about
Kexi. But Base requires Java and breaks every time there is a new
version of Java. Java is also very slow, and if you read comments from
OOo users there is a lot of complaining about speed. I mean serious
speed problems. Users report things like two hours to perform an
operation in Base that took a few minutes in Kexi. So for the time
being I'm just going to leave well enough alone. The version of Base
that comes with OOo 2.3 is a relatively new rewrite, and Kexi is also
in its infancy. What I have works for me and I'll just bide my time and
see how these two develop.

   SQL is a language that works with sets. It is not procedural, functional, 
or otherwise similar to general purpose programming languages. There is an
established standard for vendors to use in their SQL products, but they are
free to implement many of the standards as they see fit. What you see are
not SQL flavors, but vendor-specific implementation details of many/most SQL
capabilities.

   Think sets: tables (called relations in the lingo), tuples (rows), and
attributes (columns). SQL queries return tables (sets).

   I highly recommend Rick van Laan's "Introduction to SQL, 4th Edition." Not
only comprehensive, but very well written and, to my knowledge, the only
comprehensive discussion of date and time in SQL selects. Critical for most
business applications and not at all well supported by any RDBMS.

Message-ID: <498756ed0802141738g379989d6u5482b1b36f809aeb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I was looking up how to use rmdir in man and info.  I was trying to
remove a directory, and it's subdirectories, and all the files.
Neither the man or info page for rmdir showed that the -r parameter,
or whatever you call the latter, as in rmdir -r, would do the trick.
Why is that?  Isn't the man or info page suppose to show that.  I did
a google search, and at the web site

http://www.computerhope.com/unix/urmdir.htm

it gave the example rmdir -r

So, isn't man and info suppose to be used to figure stuff like this out?

Also, what's the linux way of referring to the -r in rmdir -r.  Is it
parameter, tag, et. al.?

Sincerely,
Victor

You want `man rm`.

   The '-r' is an option, meaning recursive. I've never used that with rmdir
because that tends to work on only empty directores. A better way to remove
a non-empty directory with all its subdirectories and all files is 'rm -rf
dir_name/'. That means remove recursively and force (without asking for
confirmation). Use with extreme care.

I have said this before, but I have learned that the command "rm -rf"
include the non-printing characters <PAUSE> and <THINK> _before_ the
<ENTER> key.  You may not see them on the screen, but they are there
and they need heeding.

If you have the luxury of a gnu rm, you can develop the habit of only 
ever typing '-rf' as the last thing on the line.  That gives you time 
to pause and think.

Also, if you are unfortunate enough to find yourself in a bsd userland, 
you can pause and think during the "curse,ctrl+a,alt+f" ritual.

Historical note:  I developed this habit immediately after banning all 
keyboards with the backwards L enter key (no! that's not a backslash!)

Sunday February 17 (3rd sunday each month) is Linux Clinic Day!!!   

Join us at 1PM to 5PM at Free Geek (1731 SE 10th Ave, 2 blocks south
of Hawthorne, http://www.freegeek.org/map.php ) and bring your
misbehaving computer or your misbehaving Linux repair guru.  We will
combine them and see what happens.

We will have distros, power, wifi, ethernet, monitors, keyboards, and
meece.  We will have coffee, cookies, and Penguinos (a mexican cupcake,
somewhere between Little Debbie and scouring pad).  We will have 
access to the vast Free Geek library, with solutions to all problems
for software predating 1995.  We will have bad jokes, nerd cameraderie,
Linux expertise,  hardware expertise, linguistic expertise,  dating
expertise (just kidding, we are nerds after all), strange opinions, 
and a hammer to smash unsupported wifi cards.  The thrift store will
be closed, so it's a good idea to bring whatever hardware you might
need to get your machine running.

Escape your drab, wretched, lonely existence!  Replace your boring
old problems with shiny new ones!  Help others find the true path
to open source enlightenment!

   SQL is a language that works with sets. It is not procedural, functional,

or otherwise similar to general purpose programming languages. There is an
established standard for vendors to use in their SQL products, but they are
free to implement many of the standards as they see fit. What you see are
not SQL flavors, but vendor-specific implementation details of many/most SQL
capabilities.

   Think sets: tables (called relations in the lingo), tuples (rows), and
attributes (columns). SQL queries return tables (sets).

   I highly recommend Rick van Laan's "Introduction to SQL, 4th Edition."
Not
only comprehensive, but very well written and, to my knowledge, the only
comprehensive discussion of date and time in SQL selects. Critical for most
business applications and not at all well supported by any RDBMS.

At 5:00am on Saturday morning I encountered a problem with an Open Source
package.  Hop onto IRC pose a question and within 20 minutes I had a fix
installed.

Try that with a commercial product.

Once again I floated on a contented cloud of appreciation for Open Source
software and the community around it.

Then I thought about work.  About our SNMP polling system and the (latest)
product whose MIB isn't properly interpreted.  Not only do we have both
companies claiming fault with the other we also have to be an intermediary
for the discussion.  There's no way (that we've found yet) for a support
or technical engineer at Vendor A to get in direct contact with a support
or technical engineer at Vendor B.

Have any of you ever encountered a problem like this with Open Source groups?
Where parties would find fault with the other and refuse to discuss it?

I don't want to let my mood get unjustifiably utopian today.

Yeah,  I waited until then so east coast people would wake up.

Checks and balances are obtained in the corporate world through
lawsuits.  If a corporation cannot sue a vendor for a faulty product
or service, then the corporation has no further recourse.  This is
because corporations cannot deal with anything that does not fit
neatly into little squares on spreadsheets, which especially includes
human beings.  Since a corportation cannot sue Debian or Gentoo or
some one-man sourceforge project maintainer when a bug is found in
their open source, BSD or GPL licensed code, these products will never
make it into the corporate mainstream, while Redhat and SuSE can be
sued, therefore their names are synonymous with Linux wherever
mindless middle management types lurk.

I feel it is our duty as humans to get as much open source code
running inside corporate walls as possible, if only to piss off
Lundbergh types.  I have a common lisp web server running critical
jobs at my workplace.  My drone-like colleagues are put-off and
scared, but it's too late to rewrite it all in .NET, so they're
learning to cope.  Success!

I have noticed that the buggiest software I use is written by
corporate giants.  I'm mainly thinking of Evolution and Tora.  All the
other software installed on my workstation, including the Gentoo OS,
the XFce4 desktop manager, the complex Emacs editor with all its
tiny-project-scale plugins like JDEE and SLIME, and the Common Lisp
implementation of my choice (generally SBCL) along with its ASDF
packages (each of them being an OSS project in its own right), while
not 100% bug free, are still far more solid than the big-cheese
offerings.  It is interesting that a corporate giant cannot mobilize
its army of coders to fix bugs as effectively as a tiny OSS project
team.  I'm sure it comes down the ability or willingness to
communicate.

To answer your question, I have not seen this behavior among OSS
groups.  Usually you get the opposite: heavy vocalization of opinions.
And you don't need access to private data stores to see it; their
media (mailing lists, IRC logs) are public and searchable on google.
So keep feeling good!  Maybe you should head to Mount Hood and get
some turns, since you're up anyway!

It does happen, but is usually more casual and short-lived.  When you 
have the source code, accusations are provable.

The more ongoing standoffs are typically about architectural 
disagreements or places where standards and protocols are in flux.  
These are usually accompanied by a code fork.

Sunday February 17 (3rd sunday each month) is Linux Clinic Day!!!   

Join us at 1PM to 5PM at Free Geek (1731 SE 10th Ave, 2 blocks south of
Hawthorne, http://www.freegeek.org/map.php ) and bring your misbehaving
computer or your misbehaving Linux repair guru.  We will combine them and
see what happens.

We will have distros, power, wifi, ethernet, monitors, keyboards, and meece.
We will have coffee, cookies, and Penguinos (a mexican cupcake, somewhere
between Little Debbie and scouring pad).  We will have access to the vast
Free Geek library, with solutions to all problems for software predating
1995.  We will have bad jokes, nerd cameraderie, Linux expertise,  hardware
expertise, linguistic expertise,  dating expertise (just kidding, we are
nerds after all), strange opinions, and a hammer to smash unsupported wifi
cards.  The thrift store will be closed, so it's a good idea to bring
whatever hardware you might need to get your machine running.

Escape your drab, wretched, lonely existence!  Replace your boring old
problems with shiny new ones!  Help others find the true path to open source
enlightenment!

I will do you one better and tell you a brief story involving a
project I worked on while I was at Cisco :-)

So, I'm writing this massive automated computational "cloud"
infrastructure in C and Python (similar to Amazon EC2).  My boss asks
me to do it.  He wants to "virtualize everything" related to Cisco
Security Agent product testing.  Cool!  So, a couple months into the
project and we start noticing some major issues with the VMware VIX
API.  At first we just thought we were dumb, and writing some code
improperly, but as time went on we started to realize that the VIX API
has some problems.  After trying to work around them for a while, we
kept hoping a new release from VMware would solve some issues.
Finally, it came.  Or did it?

We upgraded all the machines to the latest VMware, in hopes that the
problem was fixed, and gave it a whirl.  Now things blew up even
worse.  This time, instead of just hanging, things were segfaulting.
I called up VMware support.  They gave us the run around.  Many calls
later, and debugging, and we finally get someone to open up a real
ticket.  I explain the problem, and they don't know what's going on,
but tell us to try all these hidden VMware options to see if they
might help.  Some of them actually make the problem worse, so that was
no help.  However, this back and forth with the vendor went on for 2
months just about.

I finally got sick of hearing "suggestions" about what to do and broke
our gdb, stepping through the VIX API myself, without debugging
symbols.  It was a major pain, and took me a couple days just to
figure out what was happening.  Well, in the end, I came to a
startling conclusion.  At some strange points between certain VIX API
calls, the connection handler would accidentally free an old pointer,
disrupt the connection, and ultimately dereference a pointer to dead
code (or invalid code).  When I got to the end of debugging, I found
that the VIX API would call this function panic(), which would call
panic_panic(), right before death of the process.  Now, to test my
suspicions, I actually opened up libvmwarevix.so and patched the
binary in place a few times to see if I could circumvent the bugs.
After a day of hacking around the possible places I thought that would
case the issue, I struck gold, and found a way to patch it so that the
incorrect dereferencing would not occur.  I tested the modified VMware
VIX library shared object on our infrastructure, and it worked!

Now, you would think that VMware would be so happy that I took all
this time out and debugged their issue, even telling them the exact
locations in the API that needed to be fixed.  But no!  I called them
up, asked to be elevated to a senior engineer, and they finally called
me back.  I gave them the whole story.  The engineer was surprised,
but quite intrigued about this, because he said "we actually have an
internal bug number for this, and I've seen it before".  Great!  He
asks me to give him a week to try and get a fix into VMware for it,
and that he will call me back.

A week goes by.  Two more weeks.  I finally call on the third week.  I
talk to the engineer.  "yeah, we looked at the bug, and we know
exactly what the issue is, but in order to fix it properly we need to
rewrite a lot of code, and we cannot do that at this time".  I was
stunned.  I asked, "so when can I expect it to be fixed?".  To which
he replied, "we will not be fixing this bug any time soon".  I just
about shit my pants.  They knew there was something wrong and they
*refused* to fix it?!?!?!  Wtf?!!  This would never happen in the Open
Source community!!!

I had my boss call up VMware and give them a bunch of heat.  Wouldn't
you know, after that, they agreed to fix the bug :-)  You can see the
end result of the project I led on here:

Heh.  This reminds me of the feeling I had while doing my survey of
MetroFi's network.  I kept thinking here I am, for no compensation,
doing at great effort what would be one or two orders of magnitude
easier for someone "on the inside", you know, someone with access to
management interfaces and stuff.  Why isn't the jackass on the inside
doing their job???

I recall <mumble> years ago having a problem with CorelDRAW on a
Windows NT computer. I was pretty sure the trouble lay in the driver
for the Matrox video card I was using. I called Matrox tech support
(800 number). The dude on the phone said he had available an NT
computer with CorelDRAW on it and asked if I could hold for a bit. I
said "sure," and he left to check things out. He came back a few
minutes later and said he had been able to replicate the problem. He
wasn't a programmer, but he assured me that if he could replicate the
problem he would be able to bump it to the programmers for resolution.
He took down my name and e-mail address and promised to get back to me
as soon as possible.

Two days later I received an e-mail from him telling me that he had
posted a new version of the driver in a special place on their website
and gave me the password to download it. He asked if I would be willing
to try it out. I did so, and it solved the problem completely. I
immediately e-mailed him back thanking him and verifying that the
problem was fixed. The next day the new driver was on their website as
the latest version with a note that it fixed a problem with CorelDRAW.

I'm certainly not saying that closed source is as good as open source
or that there are not huge advantages to open source. But I *am* saying
that we should not paint everyone with the same brush. There are lots
of good people in the closed source world and corporations are not all
run by evil people.

Whether they are good or bad is not the issue :-)  It comes down to
dependency.  If you depend on closed-source vendors to fix your bugs,
it's like you are on crack, and they are the dealer...

Hey guys, I'm trying to set up my wireless network again, and both my
netgear routers keep failing. My roomate said it's probably the wireless
channels interfering with each other. When I scan for local networks, the
only ones that come up are Metro-fi Free and Metro-fi Premium. Do you know
what channel Metro-fi uses? Does it matter? Could they possibly be
interfering with my equipment?

I read Netgear's site and it recommended setting channels at least 5
channels apart from your neighbors to reduce interference. Said also that
there are 11 total channels, 1 - 11. Which one would you guys recommend
using? Any tools you can recommend for monitoring channels of local wireless
networks? Thanks.

They may not be broadcasting their SSID  so they won't show up. iwlist scan
on a linux box should give you all the info including channel info you need.

Thanks. I put a WEP key on the router and changed over to channel 5 from the
default 11. Seems to be working now (*knocks on wood).

Good man to put a key on it ;-)

If you keep still having problems .. I have an old OpenWRT'able Linksys that
you're welcome to test/play with to see if it helps.

And then consider removing the WEP.  If you are not inclined to remove it, at
least replace it with WPA or WPA2.  A false sense of security is dangerous.

Subject: [PLUG] Open ports indicator for gnome desktop
Message-ID: <20080217183205.GA10599@gate.kl-ic.com>


Are there any gnome desktop applets that display the status of 
inbound open network ports?  I did a quick search, but I couldn't
guess what such an applet would be called (probably something
descriptive like "alfalfa" or "plinknert").


Many of the people we help at the Clinic (today, Sunday!) have 
machines at home.  Sometimes they have sshd running and we can
go into their machines using SSH.  Potentially, so can the bad
guys.  It would be nice if people needing help with their home
machines could turn on SSHD before they leave home, then turn
it off again when they return, narrowing the exploit window.
They could also open SSH on a nonstandard port, narrowing the
window a bit more.

However, the typical newbie user is going to have trouble 
remembering what their IP address is, what port SSHD is running
on, etc, and have trouble remembering to stop SSHD when it is not
being used.  So we would be replacing their current problems with
security problems, and that isn't helpful. 

J Random Newbie Ubuntu User could benefit from a Gnome applet that
displays what their IP address is and what ports and services are
open, perhaps with a little icon in the panel that indicates overall
vulnerability.  That would be vulnerable to security problems itself,
but it would be a lot better than nothing.

So, is there anything like that out there?  If not, any guesses as
to how hard that would be for a gnome-savvy programmer to write?

Is there a handy single script to wipe my browser(s) history, clear
cookies, encrypt saved passwords, wipe my swap file, etc. in preparation
for returning from outside the US?

One question I haven't seen answered relative to the laptop confiscation
buzz is "how likely is this?" That will help me to figure out how much
work to put into cleaning up my system on the way back. Another question
no one has answered (or even asked, AFAICT) is "has confiscation
increased in recent months, or did the media just discover it?"

I still want a script to clean everything up...

Thanks.

If you're using Firefox, it has a handy "Clear Private Data" feature
at the bottom of the "Tools" menu.

If you're really paranoid, "rm -fr ~/.mozilla" should do the trick.
That would wipe out everything related to your Mozilla/Firefox usage,
including bookmarks, etc.

Probably the best thing to do is just install firestarter (a firewall
w/ GUI).  Make the default rules block everything.  Turn it on most of
the time, and turn it off when you don't need it...

Funny you mention, I put a WEP key on it just to practice breaking it. Once
I have that wired I'll switch to WPA.

Yeah, how about just moving all your dot-files into an encrypted
directory?  That should probably do it.  Move them back out when you
return.  You could mount /home as encrypted if you set it up that way.
 Full disk encryption can be done in a few hours time if you really
want.  Pull out the disk and store is somewhere else in a locked
container to separate it from the laptop perhaps?  Also enable a BIOS
password and GRUB password.  That way, they would need to know (or
reset) the BIOS password, circumvent the GRUB boot, and then somehow
try to login.  If full disk encryption is used, they can't just pull
out the disk and sniff the contents...

Kristian,

   While these are sound technical solutions, they virtually guarantee the
confiscation of the laptop. The Homeland Security/Customs agents assume that
you are hiding something of Major Importance; else, why would you encrypt
anything? No, the above won't work as intended.

   The goal is to pass inspection without raising any eyebrows and bringing
the computer back home again.

   Not knowing what they might be looking for -- other than web sites you
accessed while out of the country, for whatever reason they think that's
important -- dumping ~/.mozilla is probably all that's needed. Unless, of
course, having no records at all is reason to be suspicious.

Keep two hard drives then.  One with Windows installed that acts as a
decoy (standard install, some apps, light usage of "ok" websites).
Keep your other disk somewhere else...

Oh, come on.

Since the searches themselves are totally meritless and irrational, why 
would you think you could come up with some rational way to second-guess 
the inspectors?

If you wanted to smuggle data into the US, you would just use SSH and ship 
it across the internet to a machine somewhere.  Anyone who wishes to 
actually do such a thing has already done so.

My personal belief is that the laptop confiscation scare exists to 
discourage overseas travel, create an illusion of threat, and possibly 
make bloggers think twice about checking out the world situation 
first-hand.

Put your laptop in a DHL box and ship it home.  Mark the customs label 
"office equipment and documents" and be done with it.

Or better yet, don't take a laptop at all! Unless you're so young that 
you never learned how to operate a pencil, pen and paper notebook, leave 
the computer at home.

   While business used to be conducted this way, for many folks it's not a
viable option. Web, server, repository access, project cooperation, and more
require access to the 'Net.

No, that's really the goal.

Well, even though it would make me want to gag (and other expressions of
extreme distaste), being able to conidently log someone into my laptop
and demonstrate that there is absolutely nothing suspicious without
giving away any confidential information is a good start. 

Being a white male and travelling with my wife and daughter will
probably also help.

Telling the customs agents how ridiculous and unfair the search is will
NOT help, nor will demanding my rights as a US citizen, because as far
as they're concerned, I have none until they allow me past the customs
gate. I happen to think that's as wrong as what the TSA is doing, but
this is apparently an old US Customs policy.

And of course I do archive my changes over a secure connection to a
server that I control at every opportunity. That's not the issue. The
issue is getting home with my laptop still in my posession.

Personally, I think the 'scare' exists to sell whatever media the scare-
author-du-jour gets his paycheck from. But I'd rather be safe than
sorry.

Would you ship your laptop across the country in a box? I wouldn't. So
I'm certainly not going to ship it across the ocean and then across the
country. 

My un-scientific guess is that confiscation is fairly rare, and has
always been fairly rare. This is not a new regulation or policy, as far
as I can tell.  I have travelled outside the US with a laptop in the
past, and have never even felt like there was a threat that my laptop
would be confiscated. But in these (gag!) post 9/11 times, I want to be
as sure as I can be that my laptop will arrive home at exactly the same
time that I do.

You're obviously assuming that this trip is a vacation. 

Yes, I will dine and imbibe interesting foreign fare but there is also
work to be done, and that work requires my laptop with my tools and my
files.

I'm looking for a technical solution to a technical problem, not a
meta-solution to a meta-problem.

But do they require *both* face-to-face and Web, server, repository, 
etc. communications? I think not -- I think that's a delusion fostered 
by technology vendors. ;)

   Ah, grasshopper! Face-to-face is difficult when one half of the dialog is
overseas in a different country ... different continent. We are, after all,
discussing the laptop's return from foreign lands.

Well, the work may require a computer, tools and files at the 
destination, but is the only way to get that conjunction of technologies 
at the destination carrying a laptop out of and back into the United 
States of America? As someone already pointed out, there are many ways 
to transfer information, etc. A laptop may seem to be the most 
convenient solution, but as you've noted, there are some obstacles to 
overcome.

I've been fortunate not to have to do any significant amount of business 
traveling since 1985. My "laptop" was a TI portable terminal with 
thermal printer paper and a built in modem, which, IIRC, could do a 
whole 1200 baud over ordinary phone lines. To be fair, I did have a 
Sharp PC-1500 pocket computer as well, but that I used mostly as a 
calculator.

   And therein lies the rub: what is "suspicious" to those who hold the keys
to access the country? I suspect that it is a highly classified secret.

The problem is Grub.  As far as I can tell there is no way to get grub
to be absolutely silent about what it is doing.  Even with
"hiddenmenu" and "timeout 0" in the menu.lst file, grub still blabs
"starting grub ...", if only for a split second.

Now if you could get grub to be quiet, then you could dual boot into
Windows 98/2000 by default.  When you need to do real work, you reboot
and press ESC after the POST screen to bring up the grub menu, select
linux, and away you go.

I have pondered this overall issue several times as it very important to
me.  My laptop sometimes contains very sensitive security information
that my clients have provided to me under NDA.  I think the only
solution that keeps me sleeping sound is to encrypt the partition with
the data.  I could just encrypt files individually, but chances are I'd
forget some of them (or to wipe some deleted copy of them).  In your
case, it would be a pain to think about every possible dot file you want
to clean out.  Any third party tool would probably only work for the
specific software it knows about.  Just encrypt /home and don't worry
about it.

While I agree that encrypting a hard drive would look suspicious to
border guards, I believe having it run Linux alone would be sufficiently
suspicious for them and if they had a chip on their shoulder that day,
they'd surely image my drive.  If you really want to try and pull the
wool over on them with a "normal" computer, have a separate Windoze
partition that looks tame. 

For me, the data I carry is worth more than the laptop.  If they take my
laptop while the data is hopelessly inaccessible to them, at least I can
just tell my client: "I need to get that data from you again, but don't
worry, your network isn't compromised because of it."

HTH,
tim

Of course I'm running Linux! #:)

And even the TSA thinks this is a stupid thing, and they have made a
point to clarify that this is the US Customs' policy, not theirs.

I agree, just running Linux will probably look suspicious. Not much I
can do about that, though auto-booting into a Windows VM is kind of a
cool idea.

I like this one. I probably won't do it, though.

I talked to an attorney friend tonight, and he said the odds of getting
a laptop confiscated are miniscule, not even worth worrying about. So
I'm still looking for a script to clean out caches and related lists,
but I'm not so concerned about arriving home with no laptop.

Thanks for all the thoughtful discussion and clever ideas!

Better to leave it open.  ;-)

Also, you'd be better off at least 2 channels off of the "normal" ones
(1, 6 and 11).  So, instead of 5, try 3 or 4 or 8 or 9.  iwlist
<iface> scan will tell you who is operating on which channels.  Try to
pick one as far away from strong signals as possible.

MetroFi sticks to the three non-overlapping channels to minimize its

You can use iwlist <iface> scan, or better is kismet.  Kismet will
show you all the networks it can hear, they can be sorted various ways
(by channel, etc), will give you a sense of which ones are busiest,
etc.

The traditional recommendation is to try to stick to 1, 6 or 11,
because these three channels do not interfere with each other.  Most
off-the-shelf wifi routers default to channel 6.  However, in very
dense wifi environments, you are going to get interference on any of
those channels.  If you are actually seeing interference problems, you
can try 2 channels away from those three: 3 or 4, or 8 or 9 (3 and 9
seem more popular).  Here is a table of network channel choice from
the couple months of my stumble data:

  ntwks ch
------- --
   6655 1
    553 2
    778 3
    546 4
    501 5
  17523 6
    557 7
    667 8
   3613 9
    855 10
   8569 11

Kismet will tell you if anyone nearby is using those already.
Basically, you are looking for maximum separation from whoever is
transmitting loudest and most (a very-loud network that isn't being
used much doesn't interfere as much as a medium-loud network that is
transmitting a lot).

Sounds wise.  I worry a lot more about the laptop getting taken by
thieves.  Then I have some explaining to do to my clients.  If it
is taken by customs, then my clients still get upset, but not at
me.  If they are a foreign site for a US company, then then we
apply pressure through my congressman and theirs.  If it is a 
big foreign company, the pressure comes via the State Department.  
Either way, I suspect some Customs officer has a lot of explaining
to do.

I always travel with my laptop.  It is a secure platform, and has
all the things I need to do my work.  Reconstructing that
environment on another machine elsewhere would take a week. 
I could also travel with just the clothes on my back, a passport,
and a cash card, and buy all the stuff I need when I get there,
but that would be time consuming, too.  

My laptop gets completely backed up before I leave.  On long trips,
I usually carry along a spare hard drive in a drive bay, and do a
drive image copy twice a week or so.  So to really inconvenience
me, they would have to take both.  In extremis, I can slowly move
data over the net both ways, but that means going into my firewalled
systems from a customer machine I probably shouldn't trust.

The real worry is what they do to foreign nationals entering and
leaving the US.  Later this week, my Dutch friend Jaap will be over
here to do some installations at Intel (and go to Advanced Topics
if he isn't too jetlagged);  his last trip through US customs was
not very pleasant.  This compares to travelling around western
Europe; he can drive into Belgium or Germany without even slowing
down for the "entering Belgium" style signs on the border. 

If we make ourselves too hard to do business with, then we will
suffer badly, technologically.  Jaap works for ASML, which makes
semiconductor steppers (photomask imaging machines).  The other
big stepper maker is Canon.  If both companies find it too much
hassle to do business with the US, then Intel (and AMD, and IBM,
and TI, and Micron ...) can't make chips.  I wonder how long we
would last after that?

I laughed out loud at this one. It's like a guy coming into a library,
yelling really loud, then changes rooms frequently enough so he can hear
himself, not because there are other people quietly reading.

See, that's the thing I'm hoping to eventually prove to myself. Even if it's
not intentional, doesn't keep it from being a nuisance, if not illegal
(given the chance they are hogging up the airwaves). I'm sure there's got to
be a law somewhere about disturbing other's frequencies....

Both netgear routers here were defaulting to channel 11. Switched to 5, sort
of worked, then crapped out. Channel 11 immediately goes down. Could just be
bad equipment, have to get some other equipment to test.

How can I 'see' interference problems? Or would I just deduce interference
from present activity on given channels, etc?

Cool, gonna investigate more. Too lazy to run wire, hate being restricted to

You misunderstand the WiFi radio bands.  Anybody can transmit anything they
want in this band, as long as they limit total radiated output per device.

The Matrox people used to be real good about supporting their products. 
They used to be this good for Open Source as well.  (I helped debug a
bunch of Matrox drivers years ago.)  Since then they have gotten less open
and less helpful.  (They seem to want to "preserve their IP" except that
ATI and nVIDIA passed them years ago.)

   In the 1980s WordPerfect Corp. (started as Satellite Software
International) set the standard for customer support. At one time they had
more than 1,200 support staff working on their Provo campus. (Their campus
would be the envy of many a college, and their cafeteria served great food
at very reasonable prices.) No one could touch them. Then they lost their
way and plummeted out of existence.

what does it mean when iwlist can't produce any results, even though the 
Gnome nm-applet sees and names the networks available?

joe at essence:~$ iwlist wlan0 scanning
wlan0     No scan results

Wow, Access, really?  I wrote a tool for my QA team to read sets of data
into Oracle for analysis, because playing with GUI shapes in Access gets
really frustrating and hard to edit, and its manual SQL
syntax--particular those parentheses-ridden joins--is nigh impossible to
work with.  They love my loader tool, because it gives them a "normal"
SQL interface (not to mention the power of a real RDBMS), and once you
get used to that, you won't go back to using GUIs.

No, there's no such thing as standard SQL, but most systems will support
90% of what you need (Access not included), with only minor differences.
The problem is, with an enterprise app', where performance is critical,
you'll inevitably find yourself tweaking your queries in system-specific
ways:  here a proprietary annotation, there a restructuring of
subqueries, just because your DB likes it better that way.  And that's
where ORMs fall short:  they simply can't know in every case what's the
best way to write a query.  They'll produce something that works, but to
make it hum, you're going to have to write that SQL by hand.

So I recommend biting that bullet and learning the basics of SQL, along
with whatever little quirks your DB introduces.  Learning outer joins,
"group by" and "having", "exists" and "not exists", and a few other
tricks will give you worlds of power, and you'll find those skills
really do transfer from one system to another, including Oracle, Sybase,
MySQL and Postgres (but not Access!).

With that knowledge, you'll be in a good position to tweak your queries
for best performance on whatever system you're using (except, well, you
know).

WordPerfect set the standard for tech support - free, unlimited 800
numbers. At one time they installed a new telephone system to handle
the incoming calls more efficiently. At 8 am one day they turned it on,
and promptly blew out the incoming 800 service for the whole state of
Utah. WordPerfect is also the source of many apocryphal tech support
stories - e.g., "the cup holder broke." Or my personal favorite:

Tech support: 	"Open and then close the door."
Customer:	"OK." (Sound of footsteps, a door opening, then
closing, more footsteps.)

There was a time when it came to video I said "Matrox or nuthin.'" That
has changed. Today I would say "nVidia or maybe Intel." But my needs
have changed and companies have changed. The only thing that never
changes is that everything is always changing. I still say that not all
companies are run by evil people and open source is not the best
solution 100% of the time. There are too many variables to make blanket
statements.

I discussed the idea of laptop searches in customs with some friends 
this morning. As someone who knows more than the average person about 
computers, to me it seems pretty easy to hide information from most 
people on a computer if I wanted to. And what kind of idiot would 
physically carry that kind of damning information with them anyway? 
Surely it would be easier to just transfer it electronically through teh 
tubes.

I just installed Truecrypt 5a on a spare laptop with WinXP, to try out 
the system disk encryption. The new bootloader is not encrypted, but 
everything else is. Pretty slick so far, but how would that look to an 
over zealous border guard? I had a web server compromised once, and the 
level of paranoia in me mandated a re-install of the OS. Though the 
evidence of the attack seemed clear that I could clean up the mess and 
that attack wasn't even entirely successful, I couldn't trust it 100%. 
It isn't a lot different with this issue in customs; how far will they 
go to be satisfied?  If I were in the position of being a border guard, 
and these laptops were going through me I know enough to know that I'm 
nowhere near the level needed to properly process the information. In 
fact, I'd bet no one employed in this position with customs currently is 
either.

It seems so futile for them to do this.

I would be interested in hearing how things go when you get back, if any 
suspicion at all arose from your Linux laptop. Probably none, but it's 
crazy enough that this idea got beyond a board meeting at all.

I did about the same trip last year, and coming in through customs the
big issues were "do you have your entry stamp?" and "did you bring any
home-packaged meat or cheese from France?". They really didn't care
about my laptop, which was hanging on my shoulder as they went over
their checklist. We went through customs at LAX and it was really
crowded and (to my eye) somewhat disorganized. 

This year we'll be returning someplace else, I'm sure, so it may be
different. But considering that the confiscation policy is pretty old
and I've never had travel trouble related to laptops, I don't think I'll
have trouble this time.

   It's all for perception. It's a visible sign that our government is
looking after our security very thoroughly. That it does nothing is besides
the point. Like negative campaign ads, it works. So it's done.

There's a good tip in the above. Come in through the most crowded
border crossing you can arrange.

Personally I never travel past Mexico, and I always come back through
Tijuana/San Ysisdro. It is the world's busiest border crossing. You
flash your passport and you're on your way.

It's like the 'security' at Bonneville Dam. Anyone visiting the 
'Visitors Center' has to show ID to get to it, and you still can't watch 
a boat go through the locks. However, anyone with a boat can go through 
the locks without any ID at all.

However, the crew and passengers on the boat must show ID to look at the

Subject: [PLUG] Grub won't launch Debian until I hit return key
Message-ID: <20080219055400.GH7237@amethyst.spiritone.com>

Just did a net install of Debian Etch.  It installed Grub.  Everything
is fine -- except that the machine won't boot unattended.  It gets to
the Grub screen, giving me the two choices Debian installed, but will
not leave that screen until I hit the return key to make a choice.

Once I hit return there are no further problems.

I've checked the menu.lst file, which says 'default 0' and 'timeout 5'.
I've run 'update-grub'.  And I've rebooted several times.  Any ideas
what might be wrong -- or how to fix?

I guess I could switch to lilo....

Thanks,

--Eric

Odd issue.  If you wanted to post your full menu.lst that might help...
perhaps there's some kind of syntax issue.  Other than that, you've
already checked the first thing I thought of.

Yes, odd.  Can you run these commands and post the contents of output.txt:

true ; (
set -x
cat /etc/issue.net
grep -v -e '^#' -e'^$' /boot/grub/menu.lst | cat -A
grub --version
grub-install -v
df -hT /boot/grub/menu.lst
cat /boot/grub/device.map

I have not had too many problems opening MS doc formats in OpenOffice. 
OLE embedded spreadsheets used to cause problems, but I have not tried
them in a while.

The newer versions work better.

   The file under discussion was a PowerPoint presentation. It's the only
member of its species I could not open in OO.o. It also was not viewable
with different versions of different software. Might have been bit rot on
the distribution diskette; might have been something else.

   Regardless, it turns out that the information is not needed at all.

This year is the year the local multiple listing service, RMLS, is
supposed to come out with a site that can be accessed with browsers
other than IE. I was hoping to be able to migrate my real estate work to
a Linux machine, but it looks like I'll still have to keep IE around to
be able to access Multnomah County's GIS information site, SAIL. If you
visit http://www.co.multnomah.or.us/dbcs/it/maps/ and look over on the
right hand side, and down towards the bottom of the page, you'll find
"Sail--Interactive and GIS Search", this link:

http://gis.co.multnomah.or.us/sail

Visiting it with Firefox or Konqueror returns this message:

SAIL requires Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) 4.x and above

Clackamas, Yamhill, and Washington counties all have GIS sites that can
be viewed with browsers other than IE.

Sigh.

Have you tried UserAgentSwitcher for FireFox?

It's a kludge.  But if it works, why not?

eehouse at pup:~$ sudo grub-install -v
grub-install (GNU GRUB 0.97)

Also, I'm running "testing" now having just upgraded hoping to get
a better cups and that this might also get fixed.  No luck.

Indeed.  The difference between driving into Vancouver Canada and

Getting into Canada is a breeze. Canadian border officers tend to be 
quite polite and efficient.

It's coming back to the US that poses the problem: long lines, 
prolonged bouts of questioning, and officers with an attitude that 
suggests they all have world's worst job or they've all been recruited 
from chip-on-my-shoulder hall of fame.

Smells like restraint of trade. Governments are not immune from the
Sherman and Clayton Acts. Oregon has similar laws which are sometimes
more restrictive. A word to the county attorney would probably be
ignored, but is worth thinking about, especially if it comes from your
corporate counsel.

I'm not an expert on anti-trust laws, but Google might turn up
something with IE +antitrust.

Yes, thanks.

Everything lists /dev/hdb.  Are you booting from /dev/hdb or do you
have another drive in this machine?

If you are not sure, run this script and post the contents of output.txt

true ; (
set -x
cat /proc/partitions
) >& output.txt

All four of the GIS sites have similar disclaimers. The information is
still useful. It just means that you have to verify what you find.

I tried it (a few minutes ago). While it lets me connect to the site, it
only displays part of what should be there. I suspect they are using
some features if IE that aren't available to other browsers.

That's the problem with the multiple listing service site. It was
designed long enough ago that people were usually connected to it by
dial-up, and they had a real problem with performance. By using some
active-x features they move some of the processing load to the users'
machines and the apparent wait is not as bad. Of course, now that we all
have high speed connections, that's no longer necessary.

Let's see... which windmill do I point my lance at, today?

While it would be very satisfying, and useful for the general public,
too, if I were to pursue and be successful taking on Multnomah County's
IS department, I think I'll pass. I did send a polite complaint e-mail
to the web master with links to the other three counties' GIS sites.

While I can't use SAIL from my Linux machine, or with Firefox on my XP
machine, I can still get the job done. Like you, my goal is to some day
be able to do all my computing with Linux and open source software. That
day is still somewhere off in the future.

Interesting idea, though.

Upon return from my first (and second) trip to France back in 1992, I
noted that despite the reputation for Parisien rudeness to stupid
Americans, without a doubt the rudest people I met on my two trips
were at US immigration/customs on my return.

+ cat /proc/partitions
major minor  #blocks  name

   3    64    1000944 hdb
   3    65     732784 hdb1

My machine (an eBox 2300) has a connection for an internal drive that
would be hda, but I'm booting off a CF card on hdb.

Is it possible this is related to grub's interaction with the BIOS?  I
figured by the time grub was displaying the menu it was fully in
control.

Thanks,

It would be bizarre, but if grub thinks a key had been pressed sometime
after booting, it would certainly no longer boot on a timer.  It's a
stretch, but maybe there's garbage in the keyboard interrupt handler's
buffer left by the BIOS?

I found someone who had a similar issue and their grub would boot
automatically when the timeout was set to 0:

  http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-370462.html

but not when it was set to anything else.  This probably isn't the
solution you're looking for, but might be worth trying to see if it's
got the same symptoms.

After missing my flight out of Barcelona in October, I had to get a 
last-minute ticket out of Amsterdam (and a one-way ticket from Barcelona 
to Amsterdam -- there's a whole story here that I won't repeat).

So I flew into Amsterdam and was there for 12 hours and then flew to 
Atlanta.  The officials at the Amsterdam airport were mildly curious that 
I flew to their city for 12 hours and had purchased my ticket 18 hours 
before and they asked me lots and lots of questions (most of them came 
after the shocking confession that I had *gasp* left the airport (!!) in 
that time).

Upon arriving in Atlanta, however, I went through passport control (no 
questions at all) and then folks were being directed off to the right. 
The woman directing said, "Baggage claim is this way!"  I said, "I have no 
checked bags."  And she looked surprised and said, "Oh... you can go this 
way."  And I walked through a doorway and found myself in one of the 
terminals at ATL.  I don't think I went through customs at all.

Now I wish I *had* done something nefarious in Amsterdam.

I haven't been following this thread until now, but I can add this 
data point.  On my Thinkpad X40, when I interrupt the boot process 
prior to grub and then tell the bios to continue with normal booting, 
my grub timeout is apparently ignored and the default entry is 
immediately booted.

I used to go to Canada regularly (from BWI) when I was a field analyst 
for FPS. There were some things you couldn't say, like "I'm coming in to 
work." It was OK to say, "Giving a presentation" or "giving a lecture" 
but "coming in to work" was a no-no.

The only really rough time I had was coming in to Ottawa the week Pope 
John Paul II was there. But I got to see the whole thing on TV, and from 
my hotel window, I could see the *back* of the stage where he blessed 
the crowd.

Well, actually, that wasn't too bad either. One time, though, I came in 
through Boston instead of directly to BWI. When I got on the plane from 
Boston to BWI, there was a guy in front of me with a lobster in a 
cardboard box. So I asked him where he got the lobster and he told me, 
"There's a store in the airport where you can buy them. I'm taking it 
home for dinner." And the lobster said, "I've already had dinner -- take 
me to a movie."

That does indeed sound awfully similar.  Worth a shot to set timeout
to zero (0).

Two other things to try:

1) reinstall grub to your MBR

# grub-install --recheck /dev/hdb

2) run this script as root and post the contents of output.txt:

true ; (
set -x
fdisk -l
) >& output.txt

I don't suppose you want to use windows in Vmware on you Linux system to 
access IE only sites.  At least that way you would only need one computer.

My proposed "solution" to the "laptop search avoidance without raising
suspicion" problem is to run the laptop to the point the battery is nearly
flat, and pack your AC in your checked luggage. That way, you look
cooperative, but there's nothing you can do to make the machine work after
it turns off halfway through booting. "Oh, sorry, I watched a movie on the
flight. The battery must be dead."

:D

Note that I've never tried this, but I suspect it would work well.

I don't have Ken's problem, but I do need Quickbooks and InDesign,
neither of which can be made to work in Wine. So I have Windows 2000
installed in Virtualbox. But it's a pain in the ass. I have to launch
Windows just to print an invoice for a customer. (No, GnuCash has no
inventory control.)

Ken's issue is even more annoying. The web is *the web*. It should not
require proprietary formats. *The web* makes me think of things like
equal rights and equal access and neutrality. I am wearing at this
moment a plastic bracelet from Mozilla that says "I support the open
web." (Got it at OSCON last summer.)

The internet and all its features should be accessible to all humanity
regardless of *whatever*. The internet is humanity's best hope for
peace and progress. Its openness must be held as sacrosanct as free
speech and freedom of religion. The law should recognize this.

The solution here is to feign ignorance. "It's my company's computer. That
was on there when they gave it to me." And then make some fuss about the
password being really long and hard to remember and you can't find the slip
you wrote it on because they just made you change it and you'll try but you
just keep getting the password wrong and.... After about 2 minutes of that,
damn near any border guard will let you go just to be rid of you, and to all
appearances, you were trying to be compliant.

That's something I'll get to one of these days. For now, I have a KVM
switch hooked up and plugged into both machines. I don't use the monitor
part, but while I'm in my home office I put the laptop up on the riser
with my Linux machine's monitor and just use the one keyboard and mouse.
I keep my home activity on the Linux machine and my business activity on
the laptop. It works well enough that, for now, it falls into the "don't
fix what ain't broke" category.

I'm traveling now.  Before leaving home I installed lilo, which boots
fine unattended.  I'm not sure whether garbage in the buffer would have
the same effect on lilo.

I'll try this when I get home.

Of course another alternative is to run vnc server on your Windows 
system and run the vnc viewer on your Linux system.  At least you would 
not have to reach up to the KVM.   Another alternative is to run synergy 
on both systems.  That way you can use one keyboard and mouse to control 
both systems.  I must run my companies Windows laptop at home once in a  
while and use synergy from my Linux home system to control both 
systems.  Just move the mouse from one to the other.  At work I have 
three LCD monitors, 2 for a Linux system and 1 for the laptop and I even 
leave the laptop open to use its screen for email.  It's a pain to have 
to use only the laptop screen at home.

Crossover Linux will run IE6 at least, if I'm not mistaken.  This
saves one the trouble of emulating a copy of Windows.

BTW, How do you install Windows 2000 so that you don't have to
be an administrator to use say a USB thumb drive?  What updates
are people using for 2000 these days?  I wish there was an open
source program to go out and get all of the 2000 updates and
create a private mirror that Windows update can be pointed at.
Same thing for XP.

Here's an idea, pass a law for updates to proprietary consumer
software forcing it to be open source.  So what if someone
reverse engineers your software, they still have to get away
with large volume distributions or sales of their stolden
property to actually hurt your bottom line.  You can take
your chunk out of an attempt to sell your software illegally.
There is always the option of a hefty fine for abusers of
open source proprietary software.  Open sourcing the updates
would be a boon for the honest users of your software and
make it more popular.

iesforlinux http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page lets
you run IE 5.5 -> 7 on linux, but it's not particularly reliable. In
this case it doesn't cut it. (The results are about the same as
changing your user agent in firefox.) I'd expect crossover to have the
same results, but it may be worth a try.

Aren't the updates essentially just patches to some mammoth source
tree? How useful would a diff of two versions of the windows kernel be
without one of the full versions of the source?  There *might* be
something of use in there for wine/mono developers, but it seems
fairly unlikely.

I thought about that once, but never got around to it.

My KVM uses a double click on the <Scroll Lock> key, so it's no biggie

I haven't heard of synergy. I'll have to look into that.

I've been a fan of multiple monitors since the first time I used the
English CAD software (the name of which slips me) that was sold on Prime
Computers back in the early 1980's. There was a dumb terminal for text
operations and the big, color monitor for the drawing. I've always found
it useful to be able to have help files open on one screen while trying
to do something related on the other.

I'm guessing that everything but firefox placed in /usr/bin

work...

I get:

Are you trying to manually install from the downloadable binary tar.gz?

have you tried symlinking from the bin dir. to the exe? eg: ln -s
/usr/lib/firefox-2.0.0.12/firefox /usr/bin/firefox

What does 'which firefox' say after adding that dir to your path?

Good idea, but you go through Customs with all of your luggage. 

If I had something worth a little hiding, I could pull out the power
brick and 'accidentally' drop it on the floor, really really hard. But
it wouldn't surprise me at all to find that they have some universal
power bricks... And if they're suspicious, they'll just confiscate it
and look at it later.

I don't know how it works with VMware and other virtual machine
utilities, but with VirtualBox I have no problem mounting a USB stick.
I just launch VirtualBox, select (but don't launch) the Windows 2000
machine, insert the USB stick, wait a sec for it to automount in Linux,
then open a terminal to see where Linux mounted it (in my
case /media/disk). Then I go into Shared Folders for the Windows 2000
machine and add this as a shared folder. Whenever I launch Windows 2000
this folder will show up in Windows Explorer along with any other
shared folders. Actually, you don't even have to go to this much
trouble - if you know that your distro will always mount stuff
in /media you can just add /media as the shared folder and then any
removable drives will be accessible there.

As for othjer USB devices, mice and keyboards are just automatically
available, but I don't know about things like modems or wifi cards and
such because I've never had any of those to worry about. 

As for Windows updates, since VirtualBox automatically configured the
network for Windows 2000 as well as Linux I can just go anywhere on the
net from Windows 2000 the same as I can from Linux. So to get an update
for Windows 2000 I just went off to microsoft.com and told it to do an
express update over the net. A short while later it was updated to SP4.
I can also update any other program that can be updated over the net,
e.g., Sun Java, etc., and I can install anything over the net (flash,
realplayer, etc.).

I haven't found anything that doesn't work in Windows 2000 under
VirtualBox the same as it does in Linux.

Let me second this. There is also a good talk (which unfortunately I cannot
attend) at the Microsoft Office tonite (look at http://www.padnug.org for
details). Yes, it's MS and SQL Server 2008 and all that, but the speaker's a
good one and I've been to these before and you can have good disucssion
about SQL (or TSQL which I think is what MS calls their version). Yes,
different versions from different vendors but there is a common base., The
simple things I do can't tell the difference.

Subject: Re: [PLUG] Advanced Topics February meeting

Wow, Access, really?  I wrote a tool for my QA team to read sets of data
into Oracle for analysis, because playing with GUI shapes in Access gets
really frustrating and hard to edit, and its manual SQL
syntax--particular those parentheses-ridden joins--is nigh impossible to
work with.  They love my loader tool, because it gives them a "normal"
SQL interface (not to mention the power of a real RDBMS), and once you
get used to that, you won't go back to using GUIs.

No, there's no such thing as standard SQL, but most systems will support
90% of what you need (Access not included), with only minor differences.
The problem is, with an enterprise app', where performance is critical,
you'll inevitably find yourself tweaking your queries in system-specific
ways:  here a proprietary annotation, there a restructuring of
subqueries, just because your DB likes it better that way.  And that's
where ORMs fall short:  they simply can't know in every case what's the
best way to write a query.  They'll produce something that works, but to
make it hum, you're going to have to write that SQL by hand.

So I recommend biting that bullet and learning the basics of SQL, along
with whatever little quirks your DB introduces.  Learning outer joins,
"group by" and "having", "exists" and "not exists", and a few other
tricks will give you worlds of power, and you'll find those skills
really do transfer from one system to another, including Oracle, Sybase,
MySQL and Postgres (but not Access!).

With that knowledge, you'll be in a good position to tweak your queries
for best performance on whatever system you're using (except, well, you
know).

Subject: [PLUG] Mysql db recovery problems
Message-ID: <c834ec80802211054y1ecfc3eq774633f58287d253@mail.gmail.com>

I recently had some disk corruption on a low-priority personal server
(in other words, a box that I didn't bother backing up regularly, and
never stored anything critical on.) I would like to recover my wiki if
possible, though, and this is proving to be difficult.

The wiki was a mediawiki install that used Mysql 4.1 for the data
storage, but the version installed now is 5.0.51-3.  The machine is
running debian testing, but I don't think that makes much difference.

Mysql will load the database, and I can see the tables with SHOW
TABLES; however anything that tries to actually look at a table in
detail errors out with some form of "table does not exist".  An exerpt
of the output from mysqlcheck is below, which demonstrates this:
(CHECK TABLE <table> seems to do the same thing, just from within
mysql)

 $ mysqlcheck -c rogue_wikidb
rogue_wikidb.archive
Error    : Table 'rogue_wikidb.archive' doesn't exist
error    : Corrupt
rogue_wikidb.categorylinks
Error    : Table 'rogue_wikidb.categorylinks' doesn't exist
error    : Corrupt
rogue_wikidb.hitcounter
note     : The storage engine for the table doesn't support check
rogue_wikidb.image
Error    : Table 'rogue_wikidb.image' doesn't exist
error    : Corrupt
rogue_wikidb.imagelinks
Error    : Table 'rogue_wikidb.imagelinks' doesn't exist
error    : Corrupt
<...snip....>


myisamchk (the other table checking tool I know of) doesn't report
anything unusual on the .MYI files:  (the newtalk and trackback tables
probably *are* empty -- this is a very small wiki)

$  myisamchk -e *.MYI
Checking MyISAM file: searchindex.MYI

At this point I'm stumped -- I don't know what to try next.  Does
anyone have suggestions?

Have you checked the permissions on database files? Are they and the
directory they are writable by the user mysqld runs as? Did you try
using myisamchk in recovery mode anyway? Maybe with '--safe-recover'?

The permissions are Ok -- they are the same as other databases that
were not corrupted, and those DBs are working just fine.   (The
directory has permissions: drwx------ mysql:mysql and all the files
are -rw-rw---- mysql:mysql)

> Did you try using myisamchk in recovery mode anyway? Maybe with '--safe-recover'?

I just did this, and then realized that the MYI files seemed to be ok
(only three tables are in MYIs? I don't know the difference between a
MYI, MYD and frm)  Most of the tables seem to be stored in .frm's,
which myisamchk won't do anything with:

 $ myisamchk --safe-recover user.frm
myisamchk: error: 'user.frm' is not a MyISAM-table

I am able to read the content of the MYI tables (the search index),
for what that's worth.  (I can extract quite a bit of the content from
there if that's all I can get.)

Do you have access to a box with mysql 4.1 (or higher in the 4.x 
series)? If so, I'd try using that version of mysqldump to create 
straight test/SQL versions of your data. Then use mysql 5 to load the 
dumped data.

Or maybe you've tried that already...

That should read "text/SQL" not "test." Sigh. Has it been that long 
since I had my morning coffee?

Is grub able to handle logical volumes? This claims it is able to in
1.95, but as current as Fedora is typically, it has only 0.97. Ah, STFW:
1.95 is the new, in-development GRUB 2; 0.97 is the current stable
"legacy" version.

My habits for servers is to have to partitions: one for /boot and one
LVM Physical Volume. When I have two drives, these are (MD) RAID1
volumes; when I have two large drives, I create several partitions as
RAID1 volumes and use them as PVs in LVM. This allows me to not use them
until necessary and keep them stopped, so they don't try to sync if I
have to reboot uncleanly.

What is large?  How big do you make the physical volumes?

I don't have access to such a box -- and the data is not important
enough to bother with setting one up.  (although, I'll probably look
into live cds, since it seems that etch is still using the 4.x series)

That's true, in the situation where you want to use LVM on all
partitions, /boot may be useful.  For me, I just consider all of my
system partitions expendable.  I keep any important data on separate
partitions that can be mirrored.  If I'm worried about losing configs
in /etc or something, I just back them up to the mirrored set.  You can
also do full system mirrors without using LVM at all, so grub can boot
that fine.

Hi everybody,  I know this is probably a simple question but I cannot find
an answer.  I just switched from Ubuntu to Kubuntu (I go back and fourth
every couple of releases) and they are now using dolphin as the default file
manager.  No big deal I kinda like it.  It some what reminds me of midnight
commander only pretty.  I have one issue that I cannot find an answer to.  I
have been all over the k/ubuntu forums to no resolve.  How in the world do I
get Dolphin to show me a thumbnail for movie files? I suspect I need to
install a multimedia package but witch one?

Thanks

As much as i'd like to think hell has frozen over, i'd hire me a lawyer 
to read the fine print before doing anythin' with them thar APIs. 
Groklaw, as usual, is first out the gate with a comprehensive analysis &

I have rather serious doubts. Short retention time is a major
performance bottleneck for RAM, if retention time could be even
doubled without creating errors all chipsets would use it (and on some
motherboards you can adjust the read delays, if you make it even 20%
longer than the memory supports you can get hundreds of errors per
second). And we're still talking about nanoseconds, not seconds.

I don't think it's fake. But I also am not convinced it's correct
either. How comes I can't extend retention time by 10 nanoseconds
without getting bit errors and they can still recover the data after
removing the memory module from the socket? Why don't memory
manufacturers rush to cycle DRAM once per second (gotta take at least
this long to pull and re-seat the DIMM, right?). I want at least a
plausible explanation. I have no issues with the warm boot experiment,
the memory was never powered down, the hardware keeps the values until
OS rewrites them (BTW, some libc versions can be configured to zero
out all free()-ed memory). But powering down or even unplugging the
DRAM module... Let's just say that I think an alternative explanation
is more likely (and I don't mean it's fake, fake would imply
intentional falsification).

Well, did you read the paper at all?

There's a big difference between having a DRAM refresh interval that is
reliable enough to keep your system from crashing (i.e. incredibly high
reliability on every bit) and an interval which is long enough to keep
some significant percentage of data intact.  

Keep in mind that these guys were cooling the RAM to -50degC in order to
get the desired longevity.  That's not normal operating conditions.
Fortunately, if you'd like to test this method out yourself, just shoot
canned air at the RAM while the can is upside down.  It's not like the
methods require expensive equipment to test, which speaks to it's
authenticity.

Finally, a big portion of the paper was dedicated to algorithms for
recovering partially corrupt encryption keys through improvised error
correcting codes.  They're obviously not implying that all of their bits
are intact.

I can't say that I've tried it, but these are all reasons not to dismiss
it outright.

Can I weigh in here, as a chip designer who has designed memories?
The explanation will get a little technical.

Dynamic memories store charge on a tiny little capacitor, accessed
through a tiny little MOSFET.  The capacitors leak, and the transistors
leak - but not a whole lot.  The amount of leakage is a function of
process, power supply, temperature, supply noise, and manufacturing
imperfections.  In particular, the leakage typically goes up because
of noise, high power supply, and "fast" processing variations.  It
doubles every 10 degrees Celsius.  And it is very sensitive to 
imperfections;  the weakest cell out of billions may leak as much
as 1000 times as much as the vast majority of typical cells.  

Since manufacturers don't want to throw away any more chips than
absolutely necessary, they design the average cells so that the
rare outliers with 1000 times as much leakage, 125C temperatures,
high noisy supplies, and worst case processing, will STILL retain
retain their value for the typical 2 *millisecond* refresh cycle.
Run the same chip at -55C (spray freeze) or -196C (liquid nitrogen),
with reduced supply noise and power voltage, and it will indeed
retain state in the vast majority of the bit cells for minutes to
hours.  Further, if a RAM cell stays powered up with the same bit
value for months at a time, it tends to "burn in" the value a tiny
little bit, and when powered up will often show that bit value
before it is overwritten.

This behavior can actually be pesky in static RAMs;  if one of
the transistors in the static latch of the cell is busted, then
the RAM will act like a long-lifetime dynamic RAM - it will retain
value for many seconds, making the defect difficult to find in a
quick RAM test (semiconductor testers cost about $200 per hour to
run, so long tests are expensive).  In the field, where static
RAM information is expected to survive without rewrite forever,
these effects will bite you.  

Yes, there are some mechanisms that fail if you slow the clock.
Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) and the various DDR designs have clock
synchronizers called phase locked loops that get their knickers
in a twist if the system clock stops or is too slow.  That can
result in write errors.  But it won't rewrite the whole chip;
the vast majority of the bits are unaddressed and undisturbed.

So yes indeed, the vast majority of the cells in a Dynamic Random
Access Memory will retain value for a surprisingly long time.  The
decay mechanism the Princeton folk describe in their paper - a
long period of nearly perfect retention, followed by a relatively
short period of high decay, is exactly what you would expect
given the physics.  The temperature behavior is, too.  And the
memory will decay more slowly if the chip is powered down,
because fewer leakage paths are activated by stress and supply
noise, so an out-of-socket RAM will retain a pattern longer.

I can point you at papers and books on dynamic memory design and
testing if you want to slog through some heavy circuit theory.
Otherwise, you will have to take my word for it, or ask another
memory designer if still skeptical.  

If I can find the time, I hope to put together a presentation for
Advanced Topics titled "Bits Are a Myth", about many pesky ways
that digital electronic circuits are not always digital, the cheezy
noisy analog signals that your disk drive read head and cable modem
and wireless receiver sees, and new technologies like RAZR that
speed up logic to negative voltage and timing margins, then repeat
the calculations that fail.  It's an analog world out there, and
it will bite you on the ass with a tiny but nonzero probability.

Programmers that assume perfect computers, and do not incorporate
periodic consistency checks on data and program state, are not only
subjecting their users to security fragility and undiscovered program
flaws, but also to random analog unkindness and senseless acts of
indeterminate nonbeauty.  As we scale down the energy per computation
step, it will only get worse.  They taught self-correcting software
and hardware back when I was in school, when computers were less
reliable;  they should start doing that again.

Subject: [PLUG] integer-decode-float equivalent in C (gcc bug at -O2 and
	higher?)
Message-ID: <86wsoxuycv.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


In Common Lisp and Scheme you often find a reliable compatibility
between print and read for floating point values.  That is, for any
float you can print it to a string and then parse that string back
into the same float from an equivalence point of view.

   Printing Floating-Point Numbers Quickly and Accurately
   http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~burger/FP-Printing-PLDI96.pdf

   How to Read Floating Point Numbers Accurately
   ftp://ftp.ccs.neu.edu/pub/people/will/howtoread.ps

In Common Lisp there is a function that "decodes" a float into the
various integer parts (sign, mantissa and exponent) in such a way that
you can reconstruct the float from the integer components, thusly:

   [1]> (integer-decode-float 1.0)
   4503599627370496 ;
   -52 ;
   1

   [2]> (multiple-value-bind (m e s) 
          (integer-decode-float 1.0) 
            (* s m (expt 2.0 e)))
   1.0

Note, the second command is binding the multiple values to (m)antissa,
(e)xponent and (s)ign and then recomposing them by multiplication:
sign * mantissa * 2^exponent, and returning the same value you fed to
integer-decode-float (1.0 in this case, but it will work for any
floating point number).

I have an application in which a C program wants to pass floating
point values (doubles, as it happens) accurately over a network socket
to a lisp program without a lot of messy float printing and parsing.
Integers are so much nicer.

So, I tried to write an equivalent to integer-decode-float in C.  I
did.  It worked.  For a while.  Maybe my C is rusty.  Here it is in
testable isolation:

   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <stdlib.h>

   struct decoded_float {
     unsigned sign;
     signed exponent;
     unsigned long long mantissa;
   };

   struct decoded_float*
   decode_float(double value) 
   {
     static static decoded_float d;

     unsigned long long *p,v;

     p = (unsigned long long *) &value;
     v = *p;

     d.sign = v >> 63;
     d.exponent = v << 1 >> 53;
     d.mantissa = v << 12 >> 12;

     printf("s e m = %u %d %llu\n",d.sign,d.exponent,d.mantissa);

     if(d.exponent)
       d.mantissa |= (unsigned long long) 1 << 52;

     printf("s e m = %u %d %llu\n",d.sign,d.exponent,d.mantissa);

     d.exponent -= 1023 + 52;

     printf("s e m = %u %d %llu\n",d.sign,d.exponent,d.mantissa);

     return &d;
   }

   int 
   main(int argc, char** argv) 
   {
     double v = atof(argv[1]);
     struct decoded_float* f = decode_float(v);  

     printf("s e m = %u %d %llu\n",f->sign,f->exponent,f->mantissa);

     return 0;
   }        

[Note: s here is 0 or 1 rather than -1 or +1 in the lisp equivalent
... that's okay, I can deal with that.]

Again, this seemed to be working fine.  Then, after about 4 years I
wanted to run this stuff again and I noticed some errors, particularly
when I ramped up the optimization.  

   $ for i in $(seq 0 6) ; do echo Using -O$i ; gcc -O$i decoded-float.c -o decoded-float ; ./decoded-float 1.0 ; done
   Using -O0
   s e m = 0 1023 0

   Using -O2

   s e m = 1 894 6122029203849216
   s e m = 1 -181 6122029203849216
   s e m = 1 -181 6122029203849216
   Using -O3
   s e m = 0 128 1294403149217721
   s e m = 0 128 5798002776588217
   s e m = 0 -947 5798002776588217
   s e m = 0 -947 5798002776588217
   Using -O4
   s e m = 0 128 1294403149725625
   s e m = 0 128 5798002777096121
   s e m = 0 -947 5798002777096121

   s e m = 0 -947 5798002776625081
   s e m = 0 -947 5798002776625081

Note, with -O0 and -O1, I get the same decodes as the Lisp
integer-decode-float.  In -O2 it goes wrong and it goes wrong
differently in -O3 and above.

   $ gcc --version
   gcc (GCC) 4.2.3 (Debian 4.2.3-1)

Any clues what I am doing wrong?

My guess is that you are doing nothing wrong, but you're seeing
differences caused by precision difference of x86 floating-point
registers and x86 double word (80 bits vs 64). Lisp may do what in GCC
is called "float-store" (you can compile with -ffloat-store to test
the effect). Or Lisp may change the FPU control to use 64-bit
registers, it's a system call, you can do it in your program too:

    #include <fpu_control.h>
    unsigned short cw = 0;
    _FPU_GETCW(cw); // get the FPU control word
    cw &= ~_FPU_EXTENDED; // mask out '80-bit' register precision
    cw |=  _FPU_DOUBLE;   // mask in  IEEE '64-bit' register precision
    _FPU_SETCW(cw); // set the FPU control word

I have discovered that -fno-strict-aliasing makes the problem go away.
Gdb (when tardily asked) suggested to me the problem was in the cast.
A different value than expected was showing up in the unsigned long
long with -O2.

Installing MoviePlayer, MPlayer or Kaffiene woun't help, as I have them
installed and see the same behavior from Dolphin as you do.  For that matter,
Konqueror also does not display thumbnails, at least for .avi files. 

My research didn't turn up an answer to your query.  It did find criticisms
for Kubuntu 7.10 for including Dolphin.  Critics said it's not ready for prime
time and isn't similar enough to the Dolphin in KDE4 to provide the
preview experience.

but I didn't give up and ...
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kdemultimedia/+bug/51024

"I finally found the solution by installing libarts1-xine AND
libxine-extracodecs."

My system already had libxine-extracodecs.  installing libarts1-xine enabled
thumbnail viewing for avi files from my still cameras.  

Konqueror needed to be restarted, Dolphin just needed to reread the directory. 

This is good.  Seeing the thumbnail makes life easier.

OT - of Mplayer, Movie Player and Kaffeine only Mplayer did well on presenting
the soundtrack of the mini-movies.

but how did xine do?  I've always felt that mplayer and xine were the
two best options (and maybe vlc, though i've never tried it on linux
since those two were sufficient on the slow linux machines i tend to
use...)

Subject: [PLUG] transferring an open firefox session from machine to machine
Message-ID: <20080223041257.GA20171@gate.kl-ic.com>


My wife left a Firefox session open on her Linux computer downtown,
and will probably need to make a trip to Portland tomorrow to save
data from the session and close it, and restart the session from
the saved data on her Linux laptop at home.  It started me thinking
that there has to be an easier way to do that, given that I have a
VPN running to the remote machine and root access to both.
The machines are running different distros (SuSE10 downtown, RHEL5
here ) but the same version of Firefox (2.0.0.4) .  

I am wondering if it is possible to copy some of the runtime data
from the downtown machine to here, and take over the session?
Alternatively, to move the open X window from there to here?  
Probably not, to both, as there would be security issues with 
such a capability, but perhaps somebody knows of a way to do so.

Mine offers to restore the previous session after a `kill -HUP`.

>Alternatively, to move the open X window from there to here?

I have yet to get `xmove` to work reliably, but you have to start the 
program on that DISPLAY.  There is a debian package.

This feature is called Session Restore. The information to restore the
session is kept in ~/.mozilla/firefox/?????.default/sessionstore.js
I just tried tried the following experiment. I killed firefox on my desktop
and on my laptop. I then backed up sessionstore.js on my laptop and
overwrote it with sessionstore.js from the desktop and restarted firefox.
Now I had most of my windows from the desktop start right up. Some
complained about  expired certificates but I bet you could solve that by
copying over some certificate database also.

Subject: [PLUG] HSQLDB string operations
Message-ID: <20080223172757.c7914c93.johnxj@comcast.net>

I need to sort a query baased on the rightmost three characters of a
field using HSQLDB, which is what OOo Base uses. The total number of
characters in this field varies from one record to the next, so I can't
just tell it to ignore the leftmost X number of characters. I went here:

http://hsqldb.org/web/hsqlDocsFrame.html

And found a list of built in operations, but I can't find a right-string
(length) type operator. I found a length operator, and a substring
operator that works from the left for len characters, but no right
(length) operator.

The problem is that the query I created in the GUI is sorting the data
on the entire contents of the field, where I need it sorted only on the
final three characters in the field, ignoring everything before the last
three characters. Base lets me edit the query in SQL, but I need to
figure out how to tell it to ignore all characters before the last
three. 

There has to be a way to do this. There just has to be. Are there any
HSQLDB experts in here?

John,

You'll have to build a formula for this and use the "mid" function (the
substring operator). What you want is the starting position to be
(length-3) and the number of characters to be 3. I don't know the exact
format, but hopefully you can figure it out from that.

Be warned that this is VERY performance intensive and could be time
consuming depending on the number of records you're searching.

Why are the EU and U.S. anti trust cases against Microsoft 
so impotent?  Will using these 'free' API's/ABI's be safe or 
prudent?  Will Microsoft turn around and say, "sorry, that 
isn't free anymore?"  Microsoft has a history of stealing
software, does use of this information put samba at risk?
I think this announcement from Microsoft is downright scary.

What's wrong with:

RIGHT(s,count)

    returns the rightmost count of characters of s

??

RIGHT(field,3)...

Interesting news.

The city uses MetroFi for everything, up to and including parking
meters. How will parking meters be able to access your debit card
account if the wireless service goes away?

I have a hunch that MetroFi will get a financial shot in the arm from
the city. Grant, loan, or whatever, the only other choice the city has
is to embrace another provider. That would cost the city a lot of
reconfiguration expense. It would probably also result in heads
rolling. Personally, I find heads rolling down the steps of the
Portland building a rather amusing sight. But the head owners probably
have a different perspective on the matter. And a lot of the head
owners are the persons in charge of such things.

John> Interesting news.

It is actually somewhat old news.  There was an article back on
February 1 in the Portland Business Journal with the same information,
and indeed the only thing new in the BJ article was the amount that
MetroFi was asking ($3 to $9 million, depending on the "solution").
MetroFi announced they were stopping construction back in October.
They still have about a hundred devices sitting on poles not doing
anything.

The new news was OPB's interview with MetroFi CEO Chuck Haas late last
week, in which it sounds slightly like Chuck had just been awoken from
a nap:

  http://www.unwirepdx-watch.org/files/haas-interview.mp3

linked from here with a little commentary from yours truly:

  http://unwirepdx-watch.org/index.php/2008/02/21/interview-of-chuck-haas-on-opb-this-morning/

John> The city uses MetroFi for everything, up to and including

Parking meters were part of the original pitch, but it turns out the
City never did use wifi for that.  They are still using cellphone
technology, though they have changed the way they process transactions
recently (they used to batch them up until the end of the day, which
cost the city more in bank fees due to "card-not-present", but cost
them less in air-time and the customer less in transaction time.  now
they do the transaction while you wait).  Apparently, the vendor of
the parking meter kiosk thingies said it would cost too much to switch
to wifi.

Furthermore, according to Logan Kleier (the city project manager), the
city is not relying on MetroFi much in any other way.  Something like
20-30 workers use it now (even though it covers only a small fraction
of the city) and one office has a fixed-wireless service for something
like $300/month.  The BJ article said that the City could get higher
bandwidth than they have now into police cars for "a fraction" of the
$9 million MetroFi wants by buying the service through Verizon.

So, to the contrary, the City is *not* using MetroFi for everything,
or even much of anything.

John> I have a hunch that MetroFi will get a financial shot in the arm
John> from the city. Grant, loan, or whatever, the only other choice
John> the city has is to embrace another provider.

I don't think that is going to happen.  The city has been asked by
MetroFi several times to do this and so far the city has had the
fortitude to say: "heh, no thanks".  As far as I can tell, the City
has been in a somewhat passive "please fulfill your contract
obligations" mode for a while now, but hasn't been willing to actively
tell MetroFi to take down their gear and get out of town.

If MetroFi gets a shot in the arm from anywhere, my guess is it comes
from Microsoft, which is already involved.

And it was such a *stupid* idea as well.  After all, WiFi is an unlicensed
band.  Nothing would prevent me from setting up a few legal peer-to-peer wifi
hotspots on a city block, and then burn traffic on them in such a way that the
meters on the block would have absolutely no access for hours at a time.
Heck, it doesn't even require a hotspot... I could simply use the cordless
phone in that frequency range, which does a pretty good job of scrambling all
WiFi transmissions.

This really needs to get filed in the "what were they THINKING?" department.

It's not an exact quote, but I've seen this sentiment expressed by the

And just for the record, I believe that people are kind and cooperative by
default, unless they feel threatened, in which case it's every man for
himself.  So, I welcome strangers into my home when they call, but I lock my
door at night when I can't monitor it.

Subject: [PLUG] Recognizing Portable Music Player
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0802241050330.25474@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I just received my Meizu mini-MP4 player (which plays OGG and MP3 music,
among other things). When I plug it into a USB port on the desktop it starts
charging the battery, but there's no reaction from /var/log/messages
recognizing a new attached device.

   How do I go about identifying which device the kernel sees as the player?
I'd like to add a line to /etc/fstab so I can attach the player and transfer
music files, but I need to know the device and file type.

Dear Rogan,

I am a linux god.  And you deified me.

After your last email, I almost sent the email way at the bottom of
this email  to the PLUG and you.  I was so sick and tired of trying to
compile emacs from source.  I decided to leave the "compiling from
source emacs" problem alone for awhile.  Then I read you last email
that you sent me yet again, combined it with what I read in the text
file:

~/src/emacs-22.1/etc/PROBLEMS

I wound up doing :

apt-get install libncurses5-dev

Then I did

./configure -prefix=/opt

and

make

and furthermore

make install

and finally

 /opt/bin/emacs

and glory of glories, my emacs editor came up!  I have been having so
much angst over this for the longest of times.  I've been veritably
obsessed by it.

The following are my motivations and problems viz a viz linux.

If I'm going to use some crazy free non-mainstream operating system, I
might as well use the craziest, most free version of all.  I settled
on Debian.

Since I'm using such a hard operating system, I might as well learn to
use the command line, because "Real Men Do It From The Command Line".

Since I'm engaging in self-flagellation, I might as well add the
hardest version of text editors to the mix, i.e emacs.

I feel the version of emacs that you get when you do apt-get install
emacs, is inadequate  ( I actually want to use more colorful language
of what I think of Debian and emacs at this juncture! ) I decided, and
was influenced, to get a more modern version of emacs.

Because I wanted a modern version of emacs, I decided I would do it
with source code.

When I finally figured out how to compile from source, I succeeded
with compiling emacs from source, and when I went to invoke emacs,
i.e.

/opt/bin/emacs

I got the stupid frustrating, enraging,

emacs: Cannot open termcap database file

At this point, I gave up trying to get emacs to work.  When Rogan
Creswick said do:

apt-get install libncurses5-dev

and then told me to reconfigure, et. al.

emacs finally worked!

I did not realize that the whole configuration process does not update
your PATH.  I think some of my Windows programs do that.

I did not realize that I had to use a fully qualified path name to
invoke the program if my PATH wasn't updated.

I did not realize what commands in the configuration process could be
done as a regular user, and what had to be done as root.

I wasn't sure how to become root.

A lot of unnerving, fingernails scratching on the cardboard, major
little obstacles waylaid me on my "Royal Road to learning emacs"

Now...I guess I have to learn to use the darn editor.  Uh...Oh...

So, let me wax eloquently viz a viz Rogan Creswick and getting emacs
to work.  I couldn't have done it without him, and more generally, I
couldn't have done it without PLUG!  May my testimonial bear good
fruit.

Sincerely,
Victor Soich





The following is an email that I almost sent to PLUG and Rogan
Creswick.  I'm glad I didn't because I finally got emacs to work from
the command line.


Dear PLUG,

I am endeavoring to compile emacs from source.  I believe I have
successfully did the configure, make, make install stuff.  The
following is what is on my system:



[vsoich at c-24-22-47-214 /opt/bin]$ ls
b2m  ctags  ebrowse  emacs  emacs-22.1  emacsclient  etags
grep-changelog  rcs-checkin
[vsoich at c-24-22-47-214 /opt/bin]$ ./emacs
emacs: Cannot open termcap database file
[vsoich at c-24-22-47-214 /opt/bin]$ ./emacs-22.1
emacs: Cannot open termcap database file
[vsoich at c-24-22-47-214 /opt/bin]$


The system cannot open termcap database file.


In the text file:

~/src/emacs-22.1/etc/PROBLEMS

It says:


** Emacs does not start, complaining that it cannot open termcap database file.

If your system uses Terminfo rather than termcap (most modern
systems do), this could happen if the proper version of
ncurses is not visible to the Emacs configure script (i.e. it
cannot be found along the usual path the linker looks for
libraries). It can happen because your version of ncurses is
obsolete, or is available only in form of binaries.

The solution is to install an up-to-date version of ncurses in
the developer's form (header files, static libraries and
symbolic links); in some GNU/Linux distributions (e.g. Debian)
it constitutes a separate package.



I don't know what it means to install an up-to date version of ncurses
in the developer's form ( header files, static libaries and symbolic
links)

I can do apt-caches search, and apt-get install, but I don't know what
to search for or install specifically.  Once I do install the
appropriate stuff, do I need to do configure, make, make install, on
my emacs source code again?

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

Thanks to you and Tim for the suggestions. It turns out that I was trying to create the query in OOo Base (which uses HSQL) but run it on a Kexi (SQLite3) database to which the Base database was connected. Therefore, I needed the SQL to be in SQLite3, not HSQL. Unfortunately, SQLite3 can't seem to do it either. Plus SQLite3 has nowhere near the capabilities of HSQL.

Therefore, I spent several hours and finally got the Kexi data in to an OOo Base database. (You really do not want the blow-by-blow process, because it was not pretty. Believe it or not, Base cannot import anything, not even a CSV file. Lots of imprecations.)

So now that I have the data in Base I am again trying to sort the field based on the rightmost three characters of the selection string. Note that I need to sort on the rightmost three characters of the *selection string*, not the rightmost three characters of the *field*. Base will let me sort on the field, but in design view (the GUI) there seems to be no way to specify an Expression to sort on. Sorting on the field gives me this SQL:

SELECT * FROM "MainBank" WHERE ( ( "Selections" LIKE '%LFc-___%' ) ) ORDER BY "Selections" ASC

I need to change that ORDER BY so it reflects the rightmost three characters of LIKE '%LFc___%'. I have tried several things but all I get is error messages. I think I need a WHERE nested inside somehow, something like:

SELECT * FROM "MainBank" WHERE ( ( "Selections" LIKE '%LFc-___%' ) ) ORDER BY "Selections" WHERE ( RIGHT,3 ( LIKE '%___%' ) )  ASC

But that doesn't work, nor do any of my other attempts. Either my logic is wrong or I have misplaced parentheses, quote marks, or something.

Suggestions to fix the syntax are welcome.

Never mind. I got it sorted finally:

SELECT * FROM "MainBank" 
WHERE ( ( "Selections" LIKE '%LFc-___%' ) ) 
ORDER BY SUBSTR( "Selections", LOCATE(  'LFc-', "Selections")  + 4, 3) ASC

The first step is to make sure the device is recognized at all. What
does 'lsusb' tell you?

Does 'cat /proc/partitions' show anything unexpected (i.e., /dev/sda drives
that aren't normally attached)?

   Only that the HP scanjet and logitech camera are seen. Er, ... helps to
turn on the device before connecting it. Now I see:

Bus 002 Device 044: ID 0492:0140 Samsung SemiConductor, Inc.

   So, now root can mount /dev/sda on /mnt/meizu. /var/log/messages tells me
that

Feb 24 15:11:08 salmo kernel: SCSI device sda: 16015360 512-byte hdwr

   And, I added /dev/sda to /etc/fstab.

   But, when root mounts the device, I -- as a user -- cannot copy files to
it. But, root can.

   To gain user access, do I source /etc/fstab or just log out and back in as
a user?

Thanks, Paul,

Rich

   AFAIK, no devices are automounted. I've never used the Xfce file browser;
'ls' has worked fine for me. :-)

   Don't think HAL was in 11.0; it is in 12.0, but I've put off the
time-consuming upgrade on my main server/workstation.

Add 'user' to the options field of your fstab entry. For example:

  /dev/sda   /mnt/meizu  vfat  user,noauto  0  0

Aren't you an XFCE user? It should be automounting USB mass storage
devices for you. Plug in your player and see if an entry shows up in
the XFCE file browser's sidebar. If it doesn't, see if you've got HAL
installed.

The 'user' option allows regular users to mount and unmount file
systems. If a file system was mounted by root, it's likely that it
won't be accessible to regular users (depending on the permissions
set).

Hi,

I have Debian on my system.  I am going through the book

Easy Linux Commands
http://www.amazon.com/Easy-Linux-Commands-Working-Examples/dp/0975913506/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1203897852&sr=1-1

which I think is just super.

My nephew is coming to Portland with his Mac laptop with "Leopard" 10.5.1

If I open up the terminal, will all the commands in the Easy Linux
Commands work exactly the same.  Remember, these are beginner linux
commands.  Or is there some gotcha that I should be aware of?

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

   That's very true. If mounted by root it's not writable by a user. However,
after root adds the device to /etc/fstab, I thought that a user could
immediately mount the device. It did not work then. Now it does; I can mount
the device as a user.

"Yes, but no".  The mac has a BSD userland, so ls/find/rm are 
implemented differently.  In general, they work about the same, but 
have a less generous options-parsing scheme (e.g. the directory name is 
not optional with `find` and option flags can almost never go after the 
arguments.)  You may also find gnu features missing in tail, head, etc.

Mac OS X has Darwin as its UNIX core, which is BSD-ish.
When you go back far enough it derives from NeXTSTEP UNIX, which was Steve
Job's other project back in the 90s, and that was BSD based.
You can still see some of the NeXT lineage in the OS X file manager among
other places, if you switch the file view to three column mode, this is
exactly how NeXTSTEP did it.

So to boil it down, when you open a terminal on OS X, it will be BSD-ish
rather than System V-ish (like most current Linux distros).
Most of the "beginner" Linux commands should work more or less (pun
intended).
For example you would use "ps aux" instead of "ps -ef".

Here are some good resources:

The Unix of OSX is more Unix than Linux is[1].  All the same basic commands
you're familiar with should be there in a Terminal window... "ls", "cat",
"grep", etc.  Even emacs, and if it's installed, gcc.  Perl is already there,
and you can build most open source tools directly from the net.  You should be
right at home.  You can even run X11 programs if they've installed the
optional X11 package.

[1] OSX Leopard has actually been OpenGroup-certified as "unix(tm)".
    See <http://www.apple.com/macosx/technology/unix.html>.  Linux
    has not met that qualification that I'm aware of.

I really think you are twisting peoples words and intentions, you're not
one of those naive Libertarians who thinks that we can all just get
along without controls to keep the wealthy elite from ganging up on
everybody else like they have been for the past 20 years, are you?

Yes I am a socialist (small s) and no I don't think people a Angels, be
they poor or rich.

No, I'm anything bat naive, and I think that without controls you'd
find out what "ganging up" really means (and the last 20 years will
seem like the good time).

The newer BSD utils in Leopard (10.5) behave more GNU-like than those 
in Tiger (10.4). In fact, the very example you gave is one of the 
changes; I know, because I like "ps -ef" better than "ps aux" for some 
things.

In Tiger, "ps -ef" fails, but it will succeed in Leopard.

Furthermore, while ps/ls and the like are from the BSD side of things, 
the GNU version of several utilites are there, including tar, grep, 
m4, and make.

Actually, X11 is now installed by default under OSX 10.5 Leopard.

Incidentally, if he hasn't updated to 10.5.2, do so for him. There are  
a metric butt-load of fixes in that version with tons of regression

have been fixed.

Some of us lightweights have grown fond of GUIs (I started with  
version 5, so I don't have any excuse except I'm lazy), so we also

You can get Pallet by running:

At any rate, OSX Leopard is the real deal, as far as Unix is

available for it.

Good to see you back in the game, Victor.

So, just having installed TrueCrypt on my spare laptop and encrypted the 
system drive, I saw this video a few days ago and was impressed by the 
simplicity of it all. I'm sure the TC guys (et al) are working on 
solutions, but do you think that in situations like this, when the key 
is entered at boot, it's then passed onto the disk where it is now 
readable? Then an operation can be done to zero out either the part of 
memory that contained the key, or all the memory if necessary before 
proceeding to boot the OS? I don't know what kind of performance 
penalties would be incurred though, or is such an idea is even good at all.

It was interesting seeing the picture example, as it reminded me of 
resetting my Zaurus. The contents on the display last, would fade out 
like that on a reset.

The key stays in RAM. In fact, for most of these programs the key is stored
in a partially precomputed form, such as "key schedules for block ciphers"
to quote the paper.  These precomputations greatly minimize the delay
associated with decrypting the hard drive,  however, they create a lot
of redundancy, which makes key recovery after partial decay much easier. 
Without the precomputation, disk access would be pig slow.

A BIOS boot sequence that clears the memory (such as a memory check)
provides partial protection.  At least, that occurs before the boot
loader pulls who-knows-what-program from who-knows-what boot device.
That means the bad guys have to take the time to disable the RAM check,
or take the time to open the laptop in preparation for removing the 
memory card.  

Programs like TrueCrypt are still valuable;  if your laptop is stolen,
the thief is not a spy 99% of the time, and won't have tools necessary
to recover the key.  If the thief sells your laptop to a spy, the
memory will have been long since erased and written over.  You can't
expect perfect security with any program or hardware;  but for a given
expenditure in effort and performance, you can reduce the risk of loss.

Storing data /anywhere/ has risks and costs associated with it.  Taking
that data outside of a controlled environment greatly adds to the risks.
Most sensitive data should never go anywhere near a laptop.

I assume my laptop will be stolen, someday.  I expect that the bad guys
will see the "weird" Linux on it and realize that it will have to be
rewritten with Windows before it can be sold to a fence.  Chances are,
the laptop will be trashed and discarded or overwritten.  So, my risk
is not zero, but smaller than it would be if I was running a more
popular OS.

That wasn't the RAM you were seeing, but the effect is similar.  The
voltages that drive the liquid crystals in an LCD display are also
stored on pixel capacitors between refreshes, and they decay in a
similar fashion.  So the fading you saw on your Zaurus is quite a good
analogy.  Cooling the display would slow the decay, although liquid
crystals are also temperature sensitive, so the slow decay would be
affecting a bad picture.

One thing that cause me *many* problems is that the file system in OS
X is *NOT* case-sensitive, but it does preserve case (and the
auto-completion *IS* case-sensitive).  This is one of the main
reason's I don't use a mac any more -- the first time I realized that
Documents and documents were the same folder was when I obliterated
one with the other :(.  (This was a while ago -- I don't expect that
the filesystem is suddenly case-sensitive, but perhaps the tools make
it more obvious now.)

You can make a volume case sensitive.  You just have to format it as UFS,
not the HFS+ format.  (Some packages will not build under OSX unless you
build on such a partition.)

My big problem with the Mac (besides the single button mouse) is the
proprietary nature of the OS.  Apple still acts like they own you.  The
patents on their interface alone are enough to make me not want to use
their OS.  Yes it has a Unix core.  But it also has a proprietary mindset
everywhere you (next)step.

Unfortunately the mac will not boot off of a case-sensitive partition 
nor will many mac-native applications install to a case sensitive partition.

Oh, I forgot about that "fun".  They should have just put that in the 
GUI layer, but instead they put it all the way down at the filesystem.  
Unfortunately, they forgot to break all of the shell tools to match.  
So, `find` doesn't play the same game as `ls` and `rm`.  IIRC, they 
didn't deal with anything besides ASCII case either -- so utf8 case 
*is* sensitive (duh, 65==97 but 256!=257.)

Actually, under OSX 10.5, you have the option of volumes being HFS+  
Journaled, case-sensitive. That is what I do for servers, but not for  
workstations, simply because some older applications (e.g., Microsoft  
Office 2004) get confused.

No.  I get out plenty.  I'm telling you the world I live in.  I presume
kindness and cooperation, and people cooperate with me.  *Unless* they are
threatened.  So my job is to be on the "friend" side of "friend or foe" as
much as I can, and I'm pretty good at that.

As of 10.4, you can also have a case-sensitive HFS+.  But as said elsewhere,
good luck at getting *some* packages to work.

I got a lot of things working under 10.3.4.  Only one package was pissy
about needing case sensitive volumes for build.  I just set up a seperate
volume for builds, so other apps were not an issue.  The only other
problem I ran into was that some autoconf versions did not recognize
"darwin" and needed to be upgraded.  I even had Squid and Hylafax built
and running under 10.3.4.  Not hard once you ditch Fink and build your own
tools.

Are you sure?  Had I known you were asking about sqlite I would have written:

What's wrong with:

  substr(s,-3)

substr(X,Y,Z)
substr(X,Y)
  Return a substring of input string X that begins with the Y-th
  character and which is Z characters long. If Z is omitted then all
  character through the end of the string are returned. The left-most
  character of X is number 1. If Y is negative the the first character
  of the substring is found by counting from the right rather than the
  left. If X is string then characters indices refer to actual UTF-8
  characters. If X is a BLOB then the indices refer to bytes.

More that I failed to say: Yes, I was trying it in SQLite3, but the
data is in Kexi. Kexi uses SQLite3, but only a small portion of the
SQLKIte3 features have been implemented, and they don't yet include
substr. Even though I am writing the query in an OOo base database that
is connected to the Kexi database, the query language I use in Base has
to be SQLite3.

I solved the problem by moving the data to Base where I can use HSQL
queries. The Base GUI does not implement all features of HSQL yet, but
all HSQL features can be used if you write the statement manually. And
you can sort of do it in the GUI, you just have to write the substr
part in the box where you would normally put a field.

Base is pig slow compared to Kexi, but I can't wait for Kexi to
implement the features that I need. Someday maybe Kexi will mature to
the point where it has the features I need and I can move back.

I think that set of assumptions is the best among the alternatives.

And really, what benefit disrupting some parking meters?

Also, there would be backup, for goodness' sake.  They would have cellular

As I recall that's what the disk utility told me when I was 
repartitioning my macbook last December.. I could be wrong.  It may also

I've done it with the 300GB drives in my main server. Rather than look
up how many DOS/BIOS logical partitions I could have in an extended
partition, I just used 4 primary partitions: 100M for the /boot mirror
and 3 PV mirrors divided kinda evenly from the remaining space.

Subject: [PLUG] Debugging odd effect a Slackware machine has on a network
	printer
Message-ID: <47C59AC5.6010101@comcast.net>

A number of years ago I started the project of sending audio from a the
sound card in a basement computer to the stereo in the living room. That
machine, which  was a 200 MHz Pentium running RH 7.0, finally  failed.
About a year ago I re-purposed another machine to replace it. I
installed Slackware on it (I forget which version) and things were back
to normal. Also, at the same time, my network printer started acting
funny. It would wake up, warm up, and then go back to sleep. I spent a
long time on the phone with Brother tech support, but never got a
satisfactory answer from them. I don't know what caused me to shut down
the basement machine, but when I did, the problem with the printer went
away, and has not returned.

Now that I have a little time, I'm ready to try to debug that problem. I
can set up the machine in my office so I won't have to run back and
forth to the basement.

I have very little time invested in running Slackware, and I realize
that I don't need X running on this machine, so I'm willing to start
from scratch. All the machine needs to do is to run Apache, MySQL, &
PHP, and be a file server.

Recommendations welcome as to the road to pursue: find and fix the
Slackware problem, or start over with a different distro.

It has been my impression that slackware users are becoming rarer and
rarer these days, and either debian or RH based distros have the
strongest support 'net, so I would suggest using one of those.

Personally, I would strongly suggest Debian because of it's history of
stability, ease of maintenance, and tiered release cycles (stable /
testing / unstable).  Ubuntu has recently demonstrated that they care
more about meeting self-imposed deadlines than distributing usable
software, and Debian Lenny did a fine job when I recently installed it
on a T42p (wireless took 5-10 min of tweaking, but it got power
management and everything else I use working just fine).  The point
being that debian isn't as arduous as it used to be.

I can't speak for the RH derivatives, I've not used an rpm-based
distro since early '99.

I think you'll find it's a lot easier to get things working / fixed
with RH/deb. simply because more of us know how to use them.

Did the Slackware server provide any services on your network? DHCP, CUPS,
or any or service?
If so, any of those could potentialy be causing the printer awaken (for a
new IP, or CUPS trying to access the printer, or something).
I would start by turning off un-needed services on the Slackware machine.
If all you need is SSH, Apache, and MySQL, then you can probably safely
disable any DHCP services, Portmap, CUPS, and any other services.

I'm an old Slackware user myself, don't have any boxes currently running it
but I do remember some tricks. I had never encountered a problem such as
this one.

I use E-P-I-C <http://e-p-i-c.sourceforge.net/>, so if that is what you
are talking about, I enjoy it immensely.  As far as the features goes, I
think I barely use more features than what would be available in
something like gedit.  Sometimes it helps to have a tool that keeps
track of all the crap that I don't want to, or shouldn't need to.

It would help if you can give the model # of the NVidia card (and possibly
the laptop models).  GS is a sub-model, such as GS, GT, etc.  We need the
model #, such as 6150, 7600, 8800, etc. to better be able to compare.

Generally speaking though, NVidia or ATI discreet video with dedicated RAM
would tend to have better video performance than Intel with shared RAM.
I don't know if the GMA X3100 is different from other Intel video chips I
have no experience with that particular one.

In a laptop there can be power ramifications with using a dedicated video
vs. shared video.  There are things both ATI and NVidia do to mitigate that,
I know NVidia uses a thing called "Powermizer" to scale performance to
conserve battery life.  There is always a trade-off, better performance ==
less battery time, slower performance == better battery time.  Both ATI and
NVidia also have control panel settings you can adjust, but there aren't as
many options in the Linux version as in the Winders version usually.  I am
not sure about Intel if it has similar controls, it very well probably does,
I haven't seen it myself.

Slow brain, and fingers, today.  This is an option for a System76 
laptop.  Here is the whole thing.

	nVidia GeForce 8600M GT 256 MB graphics and 2 Mega Pixel Built-In Webcam

The reason I even asked is because the Built-In Webcam only comes with 
the nVidia.  The person I'm working with on this will be traveling tp 
Mexico and where he is going Cell service doesn't not exist but he is 
looking at Hughes Net satellite service so would be able to use Skype or 
some other VoIP-ish method for phone service.  A Webcam is icing to this.

I thought nVidia is pretty good choice.  I've always had good success 
with them even back in the early days of binary-only drivers.

Also I'm not of the "Ubuntu Faith" so am concerned if they work well 
with Ubuntu.

Well I think for most of the time he will be tethered, near power, or 
doing small tasks.


Thanks for the great insights.

Yes EPIC is what I meant. I just downloaded it. Thanks for the
recommendation. Nothing more frustrating than spending the time to learn a
tool and then realize it wasn't worth the effort. So looks like I will try
it out and read the docs.

I use E-P-I-C <http://e-p-i-c.sourceforge.net/>, so if that is what you
are talking about, I enjoy it immensely.  As far as the features goes, I
think I barely use more features than what would be available in
something like gedit.  Sometimes it helps to have a tool that keeps
track of all the crap that I don't want to, or shouldn't need to.

Thanks for the recommendation. A few years back, just before I started
using SuSE 9.? (since upgraded to SuSE 10.0), I tried using Debian. I
followed the advice of the list, and successfully got the machine
running. Unfortunately, there was a problem with the mouse behaving
strangely -- it would seem to stick on some spot and then come loose
quickly as I dragged the mouse across the screen, particularly near the
edge of a window. I took the box to the PLUG Clinic at Riverdell, hoping
to take advantage of the knowledgeable folk there. That particular day,
there was no one there familiar with Debian! There was a very helpful
fellow there who gave me a set of SuSE CDs, and that's where I am, today.

I've been thinking about trying Kubuntu, but recently have been reading
things that tend to make me hesitate. Perhaps it's time to try Debian
again, and see how that goes.

I'll do a little detecting on the Slackware install first, but if that
starts to take too long, I'll probably switch, again.

Thanks for the recommendation.

Yes. I'll have a look. Then, I'll probably be back asking how to know
what's a service that doesn't need to run. I.e., I think I'll recognize
things like cupsd, httpd, smbd, etc., but will there be services with
names ending in something other than d? Hopefully, tomorrow I'll set up
the machine and see what's running.

<Not a rant, really -- more of a semi-confused sigh mode on>
It's a great freedom, to be able to run only those services you want to.
But some of us don't know which ones are ones we can choose not to run,
and still have the machine do what we want it to do.

   Does anyone here write LaTeX/TeX using Emacs, and have it set to compile
the code within the editor? I just tried this and up came pdfeTeX (whatever
that flavor is), but nothing happened.

   I think it would facilitate writing PSTricks code to compile and debug
within emacs. Experiences you've had would be very helpful.

Dick,
Rich Shepard and I are both Slackware users. I'd be happy to offer any
assistance I can for your install.

and as far as where services live and how to disable them in Slackware ..
just navigate to /etc/rc.d and chmod 000 anything you don't want running.

OK so it is an 8000 series which is the newest ones, and the GT is the
higher end line, this should be a fairly powerful beast, it will handle 3D
graphics no problem.
Obviously you will want the nVidia 3D drivers, which you can now install
with kernel module packages (on Fedora at least, Ubuntu has them too I
think), or the binary download.

I haven't dealt with a Webcam under Linux lately, but if it is from System76
I can only assume they will have it configured to work with Linux.

Yes nVidia works quite well under Ubuntu, though in my own current setups I
have Fedora AMD64 on my desktop with nVidia, and Ubuntu on my laptops with
ATI (an Intel Centrino 1.6Ghz and a G3 Powerbook)

Once you get up and going, you will have to try out Compiz (3D desktop
effects).  I finally got it working on my Fedora desktop, it rocks.  It has
many of the same whiz-bang 3D eye candy effects as Winders Veesta, only more
so, and more configurable.  It is available on Ubuntu also.

Well in that case if he is "plugged in" the beefier video card shouldn't
matter really, it will help with any graphics intensive stuff, and is always
good for just "eye candy" like Compiz.

   Better yet, as root run `/etc/rc.d/rc.<service> stop' No need to change

Thanks, guys.

When I get the machine set up, I'll have a look there and see what
services are running. Then, I'll be back with a list to find out which
ones I need vs. which I don't need.

   Without loosing sight of the primary reason for this exercise: allow
sleeping printers to remain undisturbed while this server is running. It is
a strange situation.

   Oh, check what cron jobs are set up to run on that host, too.

Subject: [PLUG] alien ping response
Message-ID: <20080228221731.GB9733@jamhome.us>

We've been tracking down an intermittent, odd problem. One of the symptoms is
ping response behavior:


hostname % ping -I 1 -n 10.11.22.122 
 ...
64 bytes from 10.11.22.122: icmp_seq=1436. time=1. ms

64 bytes from 10.11.22.122: icmp_seq=1439. time=1. ms

What?  Why is the response from another device on another subnet arriving
here?

Have you seen behavior like this?
What was the cause?

Once upon a time in a college network I was working in, I saw this kind
of traffic: echo replies being received from random sites on the
Internet when no outbound echo was sent.  As we were doing security
research at the time with IDSes, we spend some time looking into it.

We reported it to the network operations guys, but they really weren't
interested.  We had suspected hanky-panky with ping spoofing, but they
didn't want to deal with it and told us no routing/firewall rules were
in place to prevent spoofing like this, so the real source of the echo
requests could be anywhere within the (rather large) campus network.

Then a couple of months later, the main college routers to the Internet
went down.  The network guys were obviously interested in that.  The
investigated and found out that it died because of an enormous amount of
ICMP traffic coming to/from the campus.  They finally traced it back to
a few Solaris workstations that had been compromised and were used for
DoSing poor bastards on the Internet.

So, what is your network's source IP restriction policy?  In my case,
the echo replies were coming from hosts on the Internet because the
attackers were spoofing my IPs when sending out.  In your case, why
would an attacker try to bounce traffic off of an internal host?  It may
not be malicious. Could it be the result of some broken NAT rule or
something?  Just guessing.  To really find out the answer, you'd
probably have to sit down on 10.11.44.212's local switch and follow MAC 
addresses one router at a time to figure out where the echo requests are
coming from.

HTH,
tim

I have seen this sort of weirdness caused by something completly different.

Check to see if you have a router loop.  If you have a nest of switches
plugged into switches sometimes you can get switch A plugged into switch B
plugged into Switch C which is plugged into switch A.  This causes all
sorts of fun on the network.

Another possibility is that you have a failing switch that is flaking and
throwing in bogus packets or delaying things randomly.

Finally getting to this.

Machine details: AMD-K6 3D+, 333.114 MHz, 196 Mb RAM

KDE version :	3.5.4
User:		rsteff
Hostname:	Slack-2
System:		Linux
Release:	2.4.33.3
Machine:	i586

>    Oh, check what cron jobs are set up to run on that host, too.

cron.hourly: kmod*

cron.daily: lograte* slocate*

cron.weekly: (none)

cron.monthly: (none)

root's crontab has only the instructions to run the hourly, daily,
weekly, and monthly sets.

There is no crontab for the one ordinary user, rsteff.

As far as what services are running, does the output of ps ax answer the
question? (It's below.)

What tool do I use on Slackware? If it's to not use a tool, but do it
from the command line, is there some tool I would need to disable?

On SuSE, I start and stop things using YaST. As I recall, the few times
I tried to configure something from the command line in SuSE, my success
rate was low; either nothing happened, or sometime later I discovered
that it had changed back. When I use YaST, it works.

The machine has been running for a couple of hours and so far, no issue
with the network printer. On the other hand, my wife reminds me that it
was several days before the problem showed up. I don't recall if that's
true, but I have no reason to doubt her, either.

One other issue for now: SAMBA is working, and I can see the files on
Slack-2 from this machine. httpd is running, and from Firefox on Slack-2
I can connect to http://localhost/ and see index.html correctly
displayed. However, I can't connect to it from Firefox on this machine.
If I enter slack-2 in the Firefox address box, I get a Google page. On
the other hand, if I enter slack-2 in the Firefox address box on my XP
laptop, I do get the right page. Also, I can ssh from Slack-2 to this
machine, but not from this machine to Slack-2.

> ssh slack-2
ssh: slack-2: Name or service not known

That sounds like a problem on this machine, but I don't know what to
look for.

Try disabling Cups if the printer starts acting up again.
It shouldnt cause any problems that I've ever seen, but then again, there
are mini remote control tractor pull competitions in Holland.

But I digress...

What sort of crap? What does eclipse with a perl plugin provide the user 
that a good text editor doesn't?  (Not trying to be pugnacious, just 
curious.)

   That looks OK. Nothing polling the printer in there.

   Slackware -- until version 12.0 which now uses the SysV init scripts
rather than the BSD init scripts -- has the startup scripts in /etc/rc.d/.
Each application has its own rc.* script and you can append 'start,'
'restart,' or 'stop' to the name of the script.

   Then it may not be anything to do with this one machine. Unless something
new starts after a few days, it does not seem reasonable to me that it would
suddenly start acting like a character in a Stephen King novel or Twilight
Zone episode.

   To see what various network hosts can see, look at /etc/hosts,
/etc/hosts.allow, and /etc/hosts.deny. Also. /etc/hosts.allow controls who
is able to use ssh and what hosts can be accessed.

Dick,

   If you are not printing anything from this host there is no reason for
cupsd to be running. Disable it using

Because the machine started out up in my office as a "try things out on
this one" machine, and KDE is what I'm familiar with for a working
environment. I don't expect to run X or KDE when it's back in the basement.

OK. How do I figure out which of those services I need and which I
don't? I know I won't be printing, so I don't need CUPS. When I saw kmod
 in the hourly script my first thought was that it was somehow related
to KDE, and that since I won't be running X, I won't need KDE. I tried
to read a man page on kmod, but there isn't one. I did a Google search
and learned that it is a kernel module loader. That sounds like
something I should not mess with.

Is the process (for figuring out what services do) to take every thing
in the output of ps ax that ends with "d" and run a Google search to
learn what it is, or is there a better place to search for that information?

OK, but what do I do to tell Slackware not to run those scripts at boot
time? I'd like to make the changes relatively permanent, so that
recovery from power failures can happen without my involvement.

I don't see how it would matter, but since I'm currently running the
machine in my office, it's network traffic is not passing through the
switch in the basement. It is passing through the switch in my office,
though.

As mentioned, above, it's a temporary thing. I'm spoiled by the GUI, and
use the tools I know for debugging.

Aha! I added Slack-2 to Moonguide's hosts file and now I can ssh to
Slack-2. I looked at the hosts file on Slack-2 and saw that Moonguide is
there. (Moonguide is the name of this machine.)

   What I'd do is decide what non-kernel services I want to run; e.g., httpd,
sshd, postfix, whatever. That is, what do you want this machine to do. Then
I would explicitly enable those services and leave the rest as they are.

   As I understand the point of the exercise is to see if this host somehow
causes the network printer to rumble and complain now and then. If that's
the case, then let's focus on what might be doing this -- CUPS -- and ignore
the rest for now.

   chmod a-x rc.<whatever>

   This makes them non-executable. Also, look in /etc/rc.d/rc.local and see
what that loads at the end of the boot process.

> Aha! I added Slack-2 to Moonguide's ...

   Isn't this one of Frank Zappa's kids?

Done. So the next time I boot, it should not start. However, when I
tried to follow your instruction for shutting it down...

...I was not successful. First I tried:

rc.local is empty, except for some comments.

   You need to tell it that the command is local; viz: './rc.cups stop'

    I've never had any issue starting or stopping services. What are the
permissions on /etc/rc.d/rc.cups? This is how it is here:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 3947 2004-09-19 16:50 /etc/rc.d/rc.cups*

   Oh. I always felt sorry for those kids having to drag those goofey names
around for their entire lives. But, such is the price of fame, I suppose.

Well, don't feel too sorry. As the story goes, Dweezil was named by his 
parents in the hospital, for that little bit of umbilical cord still 
attached,, which Frank thought lookied like a little dweezil. The nurse 
who was filling out the birth certificate was horrified and, unbeknownst 
to the parents, put some ordinary name on the cert and filed it. Her 
subtrefuge was discovered years later, and Dweezil, outraged, changed 
his legal name to what his parents wanted.

What that has to do with linux, hmm...

Doh, again! I had already disabled it.

root at Slack-2:/etc/rc.d# chmod 777 rc.cups
root at Slack-2:/etc/rc.d# ./rc.cups stop
cups: stopped scheduler.
root at Slack-2:/etc/rc.d# chmod a-x rc.cups
root at Slack-2:/etc/rc.d#

All better.

Now, on to figuring out why my Music Data Base web page doesn't work.
Probably something with MySQL or PHP on the page. I haven't tried to run
it since it was on the older machine. I need to look at the code and
make sure it isn't pointing to the old machine by name, or something
like that.

I set up this machine last May (I think) and I know I installed
Slackware on it. I don't know what I did with the CDs, and I don't find
any paper notes, either.

Where do I look on the running machine to see what version of the
distribution I'm using?

I know which kernel I'm using:

root at Slack-2:/proc# cat version
Linux version 2.4.33.3 (root at tree) (gcc version 3.4.6) #1 Fri Sep 1

Oddly, this message, with a time stamp of 11:08 AM, arrived after the
other one, with a time stamp of 11:09 AM. Hence, my earlier reply.

   OK. Out of my areas of expertise or experience; don't use mysqueal or PHP.

   That's the default 2.4 kernel with Slackware-11.0.

'sOk. Thanks for the Slackware help.

I need to break open the book I used when I set up the LAMP application
to remind myself how to administer MySQL, and how to access it from a
web page. Something to do tomorrow, maybe.

On to taxes this afternoon. :-(

I've often wished/hoped for a universal version of this file, 
something like /etc/linux-release with a simple whitespace-separated

Shell scripts that need to work across various distributions and

I don't know why this is not in LSB spec.  Probably should be.

Ack.  Mine (etch) still said 'sarge', then I aptitude installed 
lsb-release and now that file is gone.  It looks like the spec only 
wants the `lsb_release` command (and rightly so.)

https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/lsb-discuss/2004-May/002146.html

But I don't see why etch would have that as an optional package.  
Optional standards?

or:
$ lsb_release -h

usage: lsb_release [options]

options:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -v, --version      show LSB modules this system supports
  -i, --id           show distributor ID
  -d, --description  show description of this distribution
  -r, --release      show release number of this distribution
  -c, --codename     show code name of this distribution
  -a, --all          show all of the above information
  -s, --short        show all of the above information in short format

or for what Paul wanted:
$ lsb_release -rc
Description:	Ubuntu 6.06.2 LTS
Codename:	dapper

Subject: [PLUG] setting bit rate
Message-ID: <47C8ABBA.1060606@verizon.net>

Hi all,

It's an HP AMD64 laptop with broadcom wireless drivers.  After using it 
for a while, I realized it was running at 24Mb/s when it is capable of 
54Mb/s.  I manually changed the bit rate using iwconfig. 

iwconfig eth1 now shows 54Mb/s.  Gnome's network manager shows it still 
running at 24Mb/s.

Which one is correct?
What do I need to do to change it and then edit to make it permanent?

I tried Google and had very little success.  Perhaps some of you can 
word the search better, or perhaps already know without searching.


Thanks,

Bruce

Subject: [PLUG] problem with viewvc and apache configuration
Message-ID: <47C8AED6.8000601@seitzassoc.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to use viewvc to view a subversion repository, and I seem 
to be having an apache configuration issue.  Whenever I try to access 
viewvc over my network, I get a 403 Forbidden error.  When I navigate 
to the same location locally, it works.  I can get to the web server 
home page over the network, so I don't think this is a firewall 
problem.  Note that local and remote accesses via viewvc-static are 
working.

Here's the contents of /etc/httpd/conf.d/viewvc.conf

Alias /viewvc 
/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/viewvc/bin/mod_python/viewvc.py
Alias /viewvc-static /usr/share/viewvc/templates/docroot

<Directory /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/viewvc/bin/mod_python>
     AddHandler python-program .py
     PythonHandler handler
     PythonPath 
"sys.path+['/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/viewvc/bin/mod_pyth\on']"
     Order allow,deny
#    Allow from 127.0.0.1
#    Allow from 168.192.1
     Allow from all
</Directory>


This is a CentOS 5.1 system with subversion-1.4.2-2.el5, 
viewvc-1.0.4-1.el5, and httpd-2.2.3-11.el5_1.centos.3.

Any ideas on tracking this down would be welcome.

thanks,
galen

Subject: [PLUG] Bluetooth and modules and stuff
Message-ID: <20080229231952.f5ddcd5f.johnxj@comcast.net>

On my Gutsy x86_64 laptop my bluetooth mouse works a charm, that is,
when it works. But every now and then it just stops working. Google
found me a fix that until now has solved the problem - "sudo hidd
--search." I don't know enough about how bluetooth works, but until
this evening this has always restored the mouse to normal operation.

Tondight, however, the command has failed. In fact, what I get is:

jjj at Devil7:~$ sudo hidd --search
[sudo] password for jjj:
Searching ...
        Connecting to device 00:0F:F6:6C:6C:DB
Can't get device information: Operation already in progress

I have googled and googled and can't find out exactly what the
"operation already in progress" error message means. Like, what
operation? Can I kill it?

I can restore the mouse function by rebooting, but that is not always
an option. This evening the mouse quit while in the middle of a project
where I was mentally keeping track of the creation of dozens of PDF
files out of various text files. I really didn't want to lose my train
of thought, which is what would have happened if I had shut down all
applications and rebooted. Things like this always happen at the most
annoying moment. In this case I connected a USB mouse temporarily while
I finished the project. 

I ran "lsmod" and the only module relating to bluetooth seems to be
"bluetooth." I tried "rmmod bluetooth' (intending to do an "insmod
bluetooth" afterwards), but I got an error message that several
currently running things were using it.

Other than the stupid stuff that I find on the net ("bluetooth uses
radio ..."), does anyone know how it really works? Does anyone have any
suggestions for command line things that will kill/restore the mouse
when it suddenly dies? Any suggestions welcome!
