Subject: [PLUG] Backing up Wii DVDs
Message-ID: <1262371303.7561.33.camel@UbuntuHH>

Folks, 

My wife got a Wii/Fit for Xmas, and I'm wondering about the DVDs. The
online chatter suggests special software is required (and perhaps a
special LG DVD-ROM reader), but I see nothing w/r/t something like the
dd command.

So I'm wondering if anyone has any experience using Linux backup tools
to create a backup copy of the Wii DVDs. 

I assume the "firmware" hack of the Wii console is required.

Thanks,
Mike

Subject: [PLUG] Workspace switcher failure
Message-ID: <20100102051404.GA15818@gate.kl-ic.com>

Workspace switcher in my gnome panel stops responding to selection
mouseclicks from time to time.  I would like to figure out why,
but I don't understand the panel applet process well enough.  

RHEL 5.4 clone, 2.6.18 kernel, xorg-x11-server 1.1.1, Gnome 2.16.0.
It fails when I have a lot of Firefox (3.5.5) windows up, and go
to a site with animated content that keeps the processor busy.

Workspace switcher normally responds by displaying the correct
virtual desktop, and coloring the selected window image in the 
desktop light blue.  After the failure, it draws the selected
window image in light gray, and does not change the virtual desktop.

I can start up one or two more copies of workplace switcher,
and the new ones work, while the first window shows light blue
for the selected window, but remains otherwise unresponsive.

Right-clicking the original borked switcher brings up the usual
preference menu, and that works, but does not fix the left-click.
It would be nice to debug this.  Suggestions?

Keith

Subject: [PLUG] Getting around junk sound card...
Message-ID: <1262489747.3392.8.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I have a motherboard from an old Monorail system with a built in
Monorail 3D Audio sound card.  It is an ISA card supposedly.  I
can't use it under Linux, I turn the card on in the bios and
the next thing I know I'm getting an OOPS message when I try
to load Slackware.  I don't have a dos driver for this sound
card where Monorail may not have made one.

I've looked closely at the mobo thinking I can slip in a compatible
sound card to get around this issue.  No dice.  The board only has
2 PCI slots, 1 AGP slot, and 1 ISA slot.  Short of converting this
SCSI based system to an IDE based one or pulling the ISA pcmcia card,
I can't add a compatible sound card.  There are no Linux compatible
pcmcia sound cards supposedly.  I am not sure what will work over
the USB ports.

Is there any chance of a patch to get the onboard sound working?

Hrmm. Well, if you're considering using a PCMCIA sound card anyway, why not
pull the PCMCIA adapter card and put a sound card there?

Subject: [PLUG] xorg.conf does not listen to rgb.txt?
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.1.10.1001031705400.4925@grond.sourballs.org>

A very long time ago, I modified the rgb.txt file for my X server of the 
time to use some custom colors.  I stopped bothering with it for a long 
while, but recently I decided I'd like to set it up again so that my 
xterms use a color that is not in my X server's default palette (as far as 
I can tell).  So I set it in /usr/share/X11/rgb.txt:

   0   0  63             reallydarkblue

However, my current X server seems to ignore my entry.  The log says my 
modified rgb.txt is being read:

  X.Org X Server 1.4.0.90
  Release Date: 5 September 2007
  [...snippage...]
  (**) RgbPath set to "/usr/share/X11/rgb.txt"

but when I try to run an xterm with my custom color, I get:

#xterm -bg reallydarkblue &
# Warning: Color name "reallydarkblue" is not defined


As I said, this used to work, a long time ago, with the XFree86 X server. 
>From my reading of the docs, I can't see any reason why it wouldn't work 
now.  Can anyone shed some light on this?

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? What is it Good For?

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?<lev at levelos.com>

? ? Drupal is growing leaps and bounds these days, powering everything
? ? from ma and pa brochure sites to Obama?s recovery.gov. Does this
? ? mean it?s a great fit for any website? Not exactly.

? ? Drupal has been defined as many things, including a content
? ? management system, a web application framework, and community
? ? plumbing. In some ways, this is both a blessing and a curse;
? ? there?s so much you can do, in so many different ways, that new
? ? users are crushed under the weight of the options and lack of
? ? clarity. In addition, all of that flexibility does come with a cost,
? ? in terms of performance and conciseness.

? ? This presentation will cover some Drupal basics including history,
? ? core concepts, and system structure. From there, we will dig into
? ? Drupal?s strengths and weaknesses, finishing off by discussing the
? ? types of projects Drupal is best suited for, including specific
? ? examples for each case.

? ? My hope is that developers new to the platform will gain a better
? ? understanding of when to approach a new project with Drupal, more
? ? experienced developers will gain a bit of insight on when not to
? ? use it, and non-techies will have some help in choosing a platform
? ? for their projects along with an understanding why developers they
? ? work with select a given platform. Please note that this talk will
? ? not delve deeply into the technical details of Drupal.

? ? *******************************************************************

? ? ? ? Agenda:

? ? ? ? ? ? 7:00 - 7:30 ?Business
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?We will discuss the status of our ongoing projects

I'm just throwing spaghetti at the wall here, but maybe it will at least
point in the right direction.

On my Debian box, there is a symlink from /usr/share/X11/rgb.txt to
/etcX11/rgb.txt. Is it possible this symlink is non-existent or broken? 
Also,
do you know which file xterm reads from? I found a thread where someone
had to move the rgb.txt file from /user/share/X11 to /lib/X11 to as 
that's where
xterm was looking for it...

as a co-owner of spiretech.com, i'll throw our name out there.  all dsl 
accounts have static ip, and we don't do port blocking beyond standard 
windows services (135-139, 445), which we block at our internet 
connection.  we work with qwest or verizon for physical layer.

Not sure about reallydarkblue but darkblue does work for xterm -bg, the
rgb.txt file should contain all the colors that can be used.  A quick but
not comprehensive search did not yield any html color codes for
reallydarkblue for me.

My growing suspicions were confirmed when I found
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12293

  "rgb.txt is deprecated, sorry.  The default upstream is to build without
  support for it.

  Your distribution may choose to do otherwise, of course, but that's not
  for X.org to enforce."

So it sounds like I'll have to rebuild my X server to have a chance of 
this working now.  Dang.

Why are you trying to create custom color names?

Wow.  "Deprecated" for simple funsies of removing features I guess... 
One would think that there was supposed to be some new and easier way 
to do what the old thing did, or that whoever closed the ticket might 
mention what the "new way" is called.  Throw us a rope man!

Didn't you say your xorg server's logs claimed to load your rgb.txt?  
Very strange indeed.

Yup.  The log plainly shows the path being read out of the xorg.conf file.

  (**) RgbPath set to "/usr/share/X11/rgb.txt"


Not sure why supporting that was considered so onerous.

I'm not, really.  I'm trying to create custom colors.  The custom colors 
need to have unique names to identify them.

I want the custom color because there is no built-in X server color that 
corresponds to an RGB value of { 0, 0, 63 }, which corresponds to a very 
dark blue that I liked to use for xterm backgrounds.  There isn't even 
anything close, oddly enough ('blue4', at { 0, 0, 139 }, is way too 
bright).

This used to work, but for reasons unknown the ability has been removed 
from the xorg X server.

Hey, David!

   What happens if you redefine blue4 to the darker shade?

It's ignored - I get the 'standard' version of blue4.

Good idea, though.

Hmm, I guess that doesn't imply that it actually read the file, just 
that the variable RgbPath has been set (and apparently then ignored).

you should be able to just use numeric values.  something like #00003f 
should work just fine.  i just tested:

xterm -bg \#00003f

the backslash is just to make the shell not see it as a comment.

Subject: [PLUG] VLC remote control
Message-ID: <fbb9452c1001061516t768f6eccvc99e5c192ff71b61@mail.gmail.com>

Just for fun I was trying to remotely control my computer that acts as our
movie player. I wanted to just tell it to switch from one movie to another,
which I thought would be a fairly simple task. I failed pretty miserably.

I know that it is possible, because when I was searching I kept coming
across various apps for both the blackberry and iphone to do what I wanted.
But I was logged in with ssh from my laptop and wanted to do it that way.
(And I don't have either of those things, and not about to go get one...) I
tried everything that google could find for me, with all kinds of different
command line options, specifying which interface to use, using rc, ncurses,
and on and on. Every time it just tried to send the video to my laptop. But
since VLC wasn't running on there it would take over the terminal screen and
try to render the video in ascii. (I was actually impressed with how well it
did, but that's another matter.) I also tried using the http vlc server to
get it going, but no luck there, either. I made these attempts with vlc
already running on the server as well as with it shut down. (Though server
is a bit of a misnomer, since the screen is also attached to it, and that's
where I want the video/audio stream displayed.)

So my question is does anyone know of a way to do that? It's just a
curiosity and gee-whiz thing, so don't worry about looking into it yourself
if you don't already know how to do it. It's not worth much effort, but I am
still curious about it...

Thanks!
Erik

This is on a fairly fresh install of ubuntu 9.10, with very little extra on
it. Just VLC, TVtime, maybe a couple others.

VNC might do the trick.  But if you think of the laptop as a remote 
control, and in general terms how the average video device works, menu 
and control reaction are observed on the main display.  I would think 
along the lines of a remote control program on the laptop and the 
complimentary listening service on the server.

Otherwise, I would think that issuing a VLC command to direct output to 
a specific display is required.

Just a thought.

It's probably not the route you want to take, but you can make a video
stream from your laptop and pick up the stream on the media player.
There is a lot of documentation on this, but I've never been able to
get it to work. :(

As a matter of fact, it does.

Well, now that I have the answer ("xterm -bg \#00003f") I no longer care 
what happened to rgb.txt.

Yes, it looks like VNC would indeed take care of it. But that's too
heavy-handed of a solution for me at the moment. I'm not interested in
installing new software on there simply to control a video player. SSH is so
much less intrusive, but powerful. What I was wanting to do was merely
because I thought that I could. It is easier to get up and walk 5 feet to
the server than it is to fight this very much. But I'm a curious sort and I
wanted to see if I could do it. After trying the obvious stuff and then
google I saw that it surely must be possible, just beyond what I can figure
out right now.

Which is the conclusion I came to, as well, but I sure can't figure out what
that command might be. Probably because VLC is such a mature and
full-featured network aware program, it has all kinds of commands to send
the output stream to various different places through a plethora of
different protocols. In looking through their forum and this page:
http://wiki.videolan.org/VLC_command-line_help
I came away from it all no closer to solving it than I started. The amount
of options was dizzying, and I didn't understand the half of what they did,
so I failed to find anything helfpul.

Nope, not at all what I wanted when I said remote. I simply want to SSH into
the box and tell it to play the file off of its disk onto its screen. I
naively thought that a simple command or two and I'd be done without having
to get up from cuddling with my wife and sons, since I had the laptop next
to me. (Well, I also wanted to impress them - see look what daddy can do!)
:)

Although, like I said in the other post, I think that part of the reason
it's so hard for me to find the right command is that VLC has all these
wonderful network abilities that could make it the media center of a whole
house. I may even use it that way someday. But for now I just have a simple
set up.

Thanks!
Erik

It appears VLC has some remote control options, including a telnet-like 
option.  I'm playing with the HTML option, controlling video playback 
via web interface.

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? What is it Good For?

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?by

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?<lev at levelos.com>

? ? Drupal is growing leaps and bounds these days, powering everything
? ? from ma and pa brochure sites to Obama?s recovery.gov. Does this
? ? mean it?s a great fit for any website? Not exactly.

? ? Drupal has been defined as many things, including a content
? ? management system, a web application framework, and community
? ? plumbing. In some ways, this is both a blessing and a curse;
? ? there?s so much you can do, in so many different ways, that new
? ? users are crushed under the weight of the options and lack of
? ? clarity. In addition, all of that flexibility does come with a cost,
? ? in terms of performance and conciseness.

? ? This presentation will cover some Drupal basics including history,
? ? core concepts, and system structure. From there, we will dig into
? ? Drupal?s strengths and weaknesses, finishing off by discussing the
? ? types of projects Drupal is best suited for, including specific
? ? examples for each case.

? ? My hope is that developers new to the platform will gain a better
? ? understanding of when to approach a new project with Drupal, more
? ? experienced developers will gain a bit of insight on when not to
? ? use it, and non-techies will have some help in choosing a platform
? ? for their projects along with an understanding why developers they
? ? work with select a given platform. Please note that this talk will
? ? not delve deeply into the technical details of Drupal.

? ? *******************************************************************

? ? ? ? Agenda:

? ? ? ? ? ? 7:00 - 7:30 ?Business
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?We will discuss the status of our ongoing projects

Yes, it looks like it would work if you start the command by sitting at the
computer and allowing the alternate interfaces, but I haven't yet been able
to start the program from a ssh terminal and redirect the video to the
attached monitor instead of it being sent to the terminal where I'm typing
the commands.

With the HTML option, can you start VLC using that, or do you have to start
VLC from the local keyboard, with HTTP as an alternate interface? Cause when
I tried it I still had funny stuff going on, and it wouldn't play to the
local monitor, it was trying to stream over the network, which is not what I
wanted.

Thank you,
Erik

Unfortunately, VLC contains the http server, so it must be running.  I 
suppose you could enable some other listener and then send a trigger to 
the appropriate port, but that's beyond me.

But I have had success using the --xvideo-display option.  That might be 
what you're looking for.  Try
  cvlc --ffullscreen --xvideo-display :0

cvlc kills the default interface.

This one really has me scratching my head.

Ubuntu 9.10 64-bit, Qwest DSL with Easystreet as my ISP. i use OpenVPN 
(via NetworkManager) to connect to my employer from home.

i have no connectivity issues for any app, with or without the VPN, --- 
except for Pidgin (2.6.4).

Actiontec modem, which is configured to use  Easytreet's DNS servers. 
i'm not running any firewall software. web browsing, ssh, mail, all work

Searching the Ubuntu Forums (once again) hasn't been too helpful. Any 
pointers as to where this activity is getting logged on the system?

You mentioned something about your "employer's domain". What do you mean 
by this exactly?

For example, my previous employer had an internal jabber server and I 
had to be on the vpn to connect
to it.

Logging - System logging can be enabled in the Prefs menu.

Have you done any port testing?

w/o vpn connection can you run nmap for each of the diff IM services ports?
e.g.

nmap -p 5190 login.messaging.aol.com

Starting Nmap 5.00 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2010-01-07 11:10 PST
Interesting ports on bucp-m1-vip.blue.aol.com (64.12.202.116):
PORT     STATE SERVICE
5190/tcp open  aol

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.81 seconds

If the ports are open, can you to telnet to an IM server
on its port?

e.g.
AIM Server: login.messaging.aol.com
AIM Port: 5190
Command: telnet login.messaging.aol.com 5190

If neither of the above works,  the Pidgin client supports Proxy Servers 
and Port Forwarding.
I would start looking into that...

HTH,

Mike

Obvious question, but I'll ask...Have you checked to make sure you aren't
proxing Pidgin through your companies VPN?  There are some configuration
options in there (at least I have some on 9.10 with the Pidgin Extras).

But either way, that command still doesn't work for me. It still sends the
video to the remote terminal as CACA (Color AsCii Art is what it says at the
top.) So thank you, but it's still not quite there.

...

I just realized that it wasn't logged in at the local terminal, and maybe
that would affect the xvideo-display number. Well, in fact it does affect
it. Retrying the command with it logged in at the box started up the movie,
just like I wanted. It didn't start it up with the extra interfaces for
remotely controlling stopping/starting, etc. (I don't think. The terminal
window used to issue the command is no unresponsive.) But that's an easy
extra cli option. Thank you!!!

But the terminal window says there was an error. I don't know why, but it
says:
x11 video output error: X11 request 42.0 failed with error code 8:
 BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)

So I almost didn't go in the other room to check if it was working. (During
the day my wife has the laptop at her student teaching job.)

So it's solved, thank you!

Starting it with cvlc enables the dummy interface.  For your terminal 
window,
  vlc -f --xvideo-display :0 -I rc
will give you a text-based control panel.  Then all you need to do is type
  add /path/to/video
to start a movie.  Typing help will show you all the available commands.

I get that too, and I'm not sure why.  I didn't dive in too deep since 
the movie played.

Glad I could help.

I can't get any BGP route responses from Qwest or Level3. I don't know their
peering or multi-homed upstream situation. Seems like something is really
really wrong though.

I am seeing some stuff related to a Qwest outage on the NANOG (North
American Network Operators Group) mailing list, I don't know if it's related
or not.

If you don't need to transcode the video to stream it you might want to try 
mplayer.

Since with mplayer you can ssh into the box, set the display to the desired 
display and run mplayer.  Mplayer will continue to take control commands via 
the ssh session that started it, but will use the display variable to 
determine the display that it plays back to.

Here's a session were I played a mpeg on the 42" LCD connected to my mythtv 
box and controlled everything via the ssh session from my laptop:

foo at laptop:~$ ssh mythtv       
foo at mythtv's password:         
Last login: Sun Jan  3 23:29:47 2010 from laptop.foo.com
[foo at mythtv ~]$ export DISPLAY=:0  
[foo at mythtv ~]$ mplayer /var/lib/mythtv/videos/red_dwarf/red_dwarf-
better_than_life.mp4

The internet weather map shows this router in Vancouver, B.C. w. a 100% 
packet loss
anguhub14.net.ubc.ca
http://www.internettrafficreport.com/namerica.htm

Not sure how it might relate. But then again, I was suprised my trace to 
spiritone
went up to Seattle via Comcast ibone and then back in through Integra 
Telecom.

The SpiritOne network is currently down. Admins are en route to the NOC 
to investigate.
We apologize fr any inconvenience.

When I go to www.spiritone.com from Safari (OS X 10.6.2, ISP hevenat.com) I
get a page that says:
Emergency Notification regarding SpiritOne Services

As of 6am this morning, a fire at a power substation has left our Network
Operation Center without power. This affects internet access, hosted sites,
email, as well as our office phones. Callers to our office will hear a fast
busy signal.

At the moment, we are aware of the problem and are anxiously awaiting power
to be restored to our Network Center.

Hmm I wonder if they've got gear at the Pittock Building, I noticed there
were power issues with the street lights down there because of the fire.
Would have figured they were on generators though.

Pittock and Infinity which are both downtown have been on (at least 
partial) generator power since the wee hours. Infinity's cut-over was 
smooth and we saw nothing.

I'm colo'd at Infinity and didn't notice any hiccups which is nice after a
couple of generator disasters in the past couple of years.

More network problems.  Running a new Qwest Adapttec pk5000 modem,
with dlsnorthwest.net as the ISP.  Everything was fine for a couple of
weeks.

To summarize the problem, it seems that after boot, the network would
not work sometimes.  On testing, I found that the modem was not
accessible--ping 192.168.0.1 returned nothing.  I replaced the modem
to test it, and the replacement did not respond either.  Thus, I
assumed the problem was my network "card" (on the MB).  Shut down.
Wait for lunch.  Restart.  Now it is up.

My plan at this point is to leave the computer up to see if it fails
while running. Also, I am borowing a card to enable more
troubleshooting, when the trouble occurs.

Any other ideas?

-Denis

I have tried two.  I need more.  (The lights flash at both ends.  Does
that exonerate the cable?)

It should, you may want to install mii-tool if it's not already installed so
you can look at the NIC more closely. /sbin/ifconfig can also show if there
are errors, perhaps it's just getting far too many errors and the reboot
clears it.

With Larry's command it worked, but I was having issues with disabling the
screensaver. For some reason it just wouldn't do it, no matter if I told it
explicitly or not. So far by using the export command first I can simply
tell either VLC or mplayer to play without using the cvlc or any other
options and they both look like they've disabled the screensaver properly as
well. Having the display set that way seems like it should be the same as
setting it as an option to vlc, but for whatever reason it's not working
that way for me.

Now I just need to use screen to be able to close the ssh session without
killing the video and it looks like I'm set. (I might be misunderstanding
nohup, but I've tried it, and every time I close the ssh session it kills
the movie, even with the nohup first on the cli. Oh well, not a big deal.)

Thanks again to everyone, I've learned quite a bit in this little adventure.

yeah, if you're not already using that, it's a good thing to try.

another is of course to check the logs.  my wifi card likes to give
out occasionally and when it does as a user i most easily notice
because connectivity is gone, but the kernel is also very informative
as to what has happened.  it tells me that:

Feb 11 08:33:50 home irq 20: nobody cared (try booting with the
"irqpoll" option)
Feb 11 08:33:50 home [<dcfa2f84>] (ndis_isr+0x0/0x6e [ndiswrapper])
Feb 11 08:33:50 home Disabling IRQ #20

which means a reboot because even unloading and reloading ndiswrapper
doesn't fix things.

or occasionally it just says that it became disassociated with the
access point and i just need to ifup it again.

so, perhaps your kernel or system is telling you something?  all of
the logs that have been relevant to me have been in the kernel log
(available via the 'dmesg' command) but they all end up in syslog with
output from the daemons and other log if you want the bigger picture.

Once you can't ping the upstream modem, see if the interface is still up,
has a valid ip address, a routing table, and an arp entry for the modem
if it's directly connected. What I'd be trying to determine is whether it's
a NIC hw faiure, OS, or TCP/IP stack bug.

Rather than me regurgitating all the commands for this, take a look at 
this page.

Try putting a & at the end of the command. Then it should run in the
background, and you can exit the SSH session, without having a Screen
session laying around until you remember to go back and clean it up.

using gnu screen isn't a bad idea anyway so you can get diagnostics
about bad video files, or even suggestions--i use mplayer on a slow
machine and it is often too slow, in fact, to play video at full speed
and mplayer will suggest command line options that work around or even
sometimes alleviate the suffering).

are you running it as:

nohup vlc -flag1 argument1 ... > outputfile 2>&1 &

that's the only surefire way i'm aware of to make nohup work--you have
to redirect the output somewhere (it says it'll use nohup.out, but i
have distinct memories of processes dieing when they tried to output
to stderr even so.  perhaps that's a problem that was solved 10 years
ago though, i stopped using nohup much back then thanks to screen...)

That won't work, backgrounding it will cause mplayer to suspend playback.  You 
would also loose the ability to control mplayer via the ssh session.  Screen 
works fine however.

   All I know was the last incoming e-mail was timestamped 12:38am today, and
I had no access to the 'Net until about 1:30pm.

   My calls to Aracnet's voice line triggered the automatic message that 'the
circuits are busy, try again later' which I interpreted as a total loss of
service.

   Heh-heh-heh! That does us aracnet customers a lot of good! Reminds me of
the sign in a fast food restaurant that read, "If you cannot read this menu
ask us to read it for you" and the note included with an important letter,
"please let me know if you do not receive this letter."

Sigh,

Interstingly aracnet.com gets right to the Spiritone home page, while

Thanks for that reference.  It seems to address potential problems for
systems much more complicated than mine.  Mine is a desktop computer
connected to a dsl modem via a 3' cable.  I executed some of the
diagnostics mentioned and saved the results to a text file for future
reference (the network is fine at the moment.)  When it breaks again I
will repeat the diagnostics to see if it shows anything informative.

My goal is to blame the NIC, the cable, or the modem.  What else
should be on this list?

Software! Which could be the driver or tcp/ip stack itself...
See if there's a newer or alternative drivers out there for your NIC.

Aracnet was down from around 5:30 am until about 1:30 pm or something.
Then it was down again for about 15 minutes around 2pm.  There was a
power outage in parts of downtown, apparently due to the transformer
failure/fire near Emanuel Hospital.  One suspects that their backup
power either wasn't present or didn't materialize.

  "Early on the morning of January 7th, a fire at a power substation
   left several blocks of downtown Portland, including our network
   center, without power. Our backup power lasted fr several hours,
   but the power outage outlasted our backup power, leaving our
   network, as well as our phone system, down.

   Service was restored around 2pm this afternoon."

My outage started slightly before 5:40am and lasted until 1:30.

Yes, I should add SW to the list.  But the network has not failed in 4
boot cycles, so I am just accumulating data from a functioning system
to use if/when failure rears its ugly head again.

My LAN is on the MB (ASUS M3N78-VM).  The manual says it is an "NVIDIA
nForce built-in gigabit MAC with external Realtek8211CL-GR PHY"
lspci lists: Ethernet controller: nVidia Corporation MCP78S [GeForce
8200] Ethernet (rev a2)

I have yet found out if there is a newer driver, although there have
been reports of some users having network problems with this MB, but
only with Windows and OpenSolaris.

OK, so I haven't upgraded spamassassin for a while, just distro updates. 
I just learned it has been throwing out many emails dated 2010 . 
Fortunately, there is an easy fix:

In /usr/share/spamassassin/72_active.cf :

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
##{ FH_DATE_PAST_20XX
header   FH_DATE_PAST_20XX      Date =~ /20[1-9][0-9]/ [if-unset: 2006]^M
describe FH_DATE_PAST_20XX      The date is grossly in the future.^M
##} FH_DATE_PAST_20XX
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The header line should be:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
header   FH_DATE_PAST_20XX      Date =~ /20[0-9][0-9]/ [if-unset: 2006]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

No time to do much more with that; if someone else wants to track this
down, see how prevalent it is, submit a bug report, etc. that would
help us all.   I've got about 8 days of unanswered emails to deal with!

   What version are you running, Keith?

   I have 3.2.5 installed here and haven't missed any messages ... including
the spam.

Rich, I am also running 3.2.5, and saw 95% of my messages, because
they were whitelisted sources.  However, I missed about two dozen
from unexpected but valid senders over the past 9 days (conference
chairs, a long-lost friend, etc).  

Check the  /usr/share/spamassassin/72_active.cf  file as suggested,
please.  The matching pattern is obviously wrong, even to a REGEXP
newbie like me.  The original pattern is supposed to match to all
dates between 2000 and 2099.   In fact, it matches only to 2000
to 2009.  Somebody's brain has got a Y10 (as opposed to Y2K) bug.
The repaired pattern will fail again in the year 2100, but by
then I expect we will have different ways of dealing with spam,
hopefully involving battery acid or Turkish prisons. :-)

Also, check your spam bucket;  I do so every two weeks or so, and
usually end up making a tweak or two on my whitelist.

Keith

Keith, that change would match any message from 1/1/2000 forward.
I really don't think that's what you want.

Preferrabe to run sa-update or (as suggested on the SA wiki) add:
Add "score FH_DATE_PAST_20XX 0" without the quotes to the end of your
local.cf file to disable the rule.  If you require help updating your
rules to correct this issue you are encouraged to ask for assistance on
the Apache SpamAssassin Users' list.  Users' mailing list info is here.

For those who wish to ignore the warnings at the top of 
/usr/share/spamassassin/72_active.cf and modify it by hand, the official fix
is:
  header FH_DATE_PAST_20XX Date =~ /20[2-9][0-9]/ [if-unset: 2006] 

as seen in the subversion repository:

Years ago.  My path was Windows  -> Mac -> Linux.

The Mac, although being based on BSD, does things a bit differently.

You may want to give VirtualBox a spin:

http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Works on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Solaris.  And the virtual disks are
portable between them.  So, the .vdi file you create on your Mac will
also run on any of the other OSes, too.

I usually just allow sa-update to handle that sort of thing:

   sudo sa-update -D

on centos, there is an sa-update cron job that is disabled by default.  i 
just found out about it as a result of this 2010 bug.  edit 
/etc/cron.d/sa-update and uncomment one line.

In Ubuntu, and perhaps other Debian flavors, the cron file is 
/etc/cron.daily/spamassassin
and one needs to change the line that sets CRON=0 to a non-zero value.

   Whoo-boy! I just dug myself a hole and fell in by running the above. Sigh.

   What I see as a result is:

[6753] error: check: no loaded plugin implements 'check_main': cannot scan!
at /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.10.0/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm line
164.
check: no loaded plugin implements 'check_main': cannot scan! at
/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.10.0/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm line
164.

   My Google search found one thread on this subject from 2007, but he was
running amavisd, too, and it could not find the *.pre files. No help for me
there. In /etc/mail/spamassassin/rules/ I have init.pre, v310.pre, and
v320.pre files.

   SA has been running so I am totally clueless why this attempted update
finds an error that prevents /usr/bin/spamd from starting again. Perhaps
someone here has an idea before I sign up for the sa mail list.

I had two virtual machines set up under Ubuntu. When I migrated to
Fedora I installed Virtualbox from the repos, then just dragged
the .Vitualbox folder from the Ubuntu ~/ folder to my new Fedora ~/
folder. (The .vdi files are in the .Virtualbox folder.) When I launched
Virtualbox there were my virtual machines exactly as before. I was
thrilled that it was so easy.

I didn't know you could copy the .vdi files to other OSes, though.
That's really good to know. If other virtualization tools can't do the
same thing, it's a major plus for Virtualbox.

The spamassassin wiki says that spamd needs to be restarted in order 
to pick up the new rules, so it appears that enabling updates only 
gets you halfway there.

Subject: [PLUG] MFC Printer
Message-ID: <4B4A7C87.4020309@gmail.com>

I seem to be in the market for a new inkjet MFC printer.  One with a 
Ethernet port.  It will be a supplemental printer to my trusty HP 
LaserJet 4000N.

If anyone has any recent knowledge about the state of inkjets and Linux 
I'm all ears.

1.  What is the difference between an inkjet and a thermal inkjet?  Is 
one better than the other?


2.  Which brands work well with Linux?  I've had great luck with HP in 
the past, but I'm interested in the Epson and Canon offerings as well.


3.  I am looking for a fully functional MFC printer (fax, copy, scan, 
memory card reader, color print (photo's too))  Is there any models I 
should stay away from?

So I try installing Debian on actual hardware where I previously 
installed Debian. It hung in exactly the same place. So, I will burn an 
new install disk and try again.

I considered virtualbox, and may still give it a try before paying for 
Parallels.

I would stay away from Brother MFC until after you have thoroughly 
researched them.  I had one and just after the warranty expired, so did 
the print head.  Seems it was a common problem and fixing it meant 
shipping back to Brother, on your dime.  Even while it was working I 
found its unalterable print head cleaning schedule tended to use up a 
lot of ink.

A few weeks ago I picked up a Lexmark X1240 from Goodwill.  It uses the 
Z600 drivers (instructions are online) and does well as a printer and 
scanner, though it doesn't have Ethernet.  While not explicitly 
supported, I can't complain for the price.

I am running an HP Officejet 7310 without any real complaints - and I 
have faxed, scanned, loaded photos from a camera memory card, copied, 
and printed with it.
I run Mandriva 2008 with the HP device managers, using TCP/IP having 
assigned the printer a static IP on my private address LAN (at home).
My other printer is an HP Laserjet 4M+, also working well, but not using 
the HP device manager.
Hope this helps
Regards
Fred James

PS:  I had an HP Officejet 155xi before that - also worked well, but it 
finally died.

A reminder -

Fixing spamassassin will not bring back the messages that were lost
between Jan 1 and the time you fixed it.  If they are in your spam

If you don't have a spam folder, they are gone ... :-(

I have an HP 4680 MFC but no ethernet, it is wireless though and works
perfect. HP's are really well supported under Linux so I don't even look at
other brands at this point. I did have a lexmark some many years ago and it
could never get it to work properly.

i had an HP OfficeJet 6120 (fax, copy, scan), and it worked great with 
Ubuntu - i really liked the ease of double-sided printing, and it seemed 
like a great value until the paper-handling went bonkers. Now i get 
random and persistent "paper jam" and "cover open" errrors when 
everything should be fine, and when i can print/copy/fax the paper jams 
horribly after a random number of pages less than 5.

Actually, i still have it, but it's going back into the box, as my wife 
has an older, larger 6110 that sill works like a dream (as long as we 
don't use recycled cartridges).

i researched the paper-handling problem on line a bit, saw similar 
comlaints but no solutions. Can anyone recommend a local repair shop?

Joe

Does this represent a change in HP policy/behavior? Or is it a

Joe,

   I used the Printer Place (1340 SE Powell) a couple of times and was
totally satisfied with their service and pricing. This work was on my
LaserJet 5 with duplexer. One time it jammed with a tiny piece of paper
stuck well inside. They cleaned everything and removed the paper.

Could be division dependent thing Denis. HP actively supports the HPLIP
project as I understand it, so at least from a printer/scanner/fax
standpoint it's all good. I don't if they other divisions support the
products they spit out.

That?? may not be true anymore.? The people who
did that were based across the river in Vancouver.? Last fall virtually
everyone there was laid off.

   Not to flog a deceased equine, but this goes only so far. I found that
HPLIP has native support for the LJ5M and one other LJ5 variant, but not for
the basic LJ5. A conversation with one of the HPLIP folks on this list
revealed that he had no idea why not. This means that HPLIP, at least the
version in Slackware-11.2 and -12.0, would not work with my LJ5, even when I
tried telling the tool it was a 5M. Annoying and irrational, and apparently
no one but me interested in seeing such support in HPLIP.

I can second the recommendation for the Printer Place. They're also a
good place to buy printers.

It bears mentioning that HP's printer division does not manufacture the
printers that they sell. Most lasers are made by Canon, although I
think some of the recent models are from Okidata. I think Okidata also
makes most of their inkjets, but I've less familiar with those.

The older Canon lasers are indestructible. And HP sold gazillions of
them, so after-market parts and recycled stuff is available cheaply.

When I added a recommendation for the Printer Place in SE Portland I
should have added a couple other places:

and 

http://www.printerworks.com/

It's frustrating that's for sure. I can't even call in to ask. This 
morning I got busy signals but for a little while now it's "We're sorry, 
all circuits are busy". Their website is unavailable too. My model shows 
a DSL link oddly enough, but I can't ping my gateway IP. I suspect the 
power outage too.

Try virtualbox instead of Parallels.

Message-ID: <4B48FAE3.5020203@gmail.com>

I need to update my MFC inkject printer to one that includes a ethernet 
port.

I'm looking for feedback on the following topics

1) Cartridge costs - Is there a manufacturer with consistently better 
and/or cheaper cartridges

2) Working with Linux - I want one that faxes, scans, and fully prints 
with Linux

I know about linuxprinting.org, but their database isn't searchable by 
these parameters.

Thanks,

Sean

Did you try the Parallels forum?

http://forum.parallels.com/forumdisplay.php?f=505

Also, I second Virtual box. The current version is great. You're running 
on really old hardware to be doing virtualization though. What iBook is 
this specifically?

amen - i have a > 15-yr-old LJ 5MP Postscript that keeps cranking out 
the pages. The toner cartridges are darned cheap on a per-page basis 
compared to the inkjet cartridges. Works great with the 
Foomatic/Postscript & CUPS+Gutenprint drivers in Ubuntu 9.10. PDFs tend 
to fail to print with the "recommended" driver.

Odd.  The LJ5M is Postscript, so it doesn't need any rendering drivers
(i.e. HPLIP), just a PPD.  The LJ5 would be where HPLIP might come
into play, but it's a standard PCL5e printer, with lots of driver support.

Aaron,

   I have the PS module installed in the printer (along with a JetDirect card
and an additional 8M of RAM). I was trying to get HPLIP to work with it
since that replaced the Easy Software drivers.

   The only issues I now have with printing are:

   1) From Firefox I cannot directly print a page. I must print to file then
print that file. It's probably a CUPS thingie but I've no figured out what
is causing this problem.

   2) For the current and recent past CUPS versions, I need to feed paper
upside down and backwards (i.e., feet first and on its belly) when I use the
front tray. This is how I print checks and other forms, and it went from
face up/head first to face down/feet first. Shrug. Annoying but I've learned
to live with it.

   3) OpenOffice.org's Writer no longer prints envelopes for me. The print
preview displays correctly, but the envelope passes through the printer
unmarked and the display tells me the incorrect page size is specified. It
used to work. Current OO.o version is 3.1.1; I don't recall when envelope
printing broke because I don't do it that frequently.

   It would be nice to resolve these glitches, particularly the last one. I
need to get on the OO.o mail list and ask for help there.

Another vote for VirtualBox, though it would depend on the generation of
hardware you are using.
If you have a fairly recent G4 iBook with enough RAM (1GB say) VB will be
fine.
However if you are using an older G3 iBook with 256-512MB RAM, that would
choke on running the native OS + VB.

Depending on what you want to do with it, it might make more sense to leave
the M$ beast off your Mac and just run native Linux (or OS X).

I myself run (or have run) Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian on several older Macs:
-G3 Powerbook, 400mhz, 384MB RAM, Ubuntu
-G3 Powerbook, 333mhz, 256MB RAM, Debian
-G4 Powerbook, 1Ghz, 1GB RAM, dual boot OS X 10.5 and Ubuntu

The Debian and Fedora PPC ports are still officially supported, and the
Ubuntu PPC port is now "community" supported.
Taking the virtualization issue aside for a moment, these older Macs run
Linux natively quite well.

Message-ID: <20100112070145.GA10459@gate.kl-ic.com>

The second T60 arrived today, along with the inverter board, to
go with the 2048x1536 screen already purchased.  If folks are
interested in watching, I can do that conversion at the Linux
clinic on Sunday.

The screen's EDID ROM needs a reflash for Lenovo compatability. 
Last time, I did that with a WinXP program.  It may be possible to
do that in Linux with lm-sensors related tools.  Does anyone want to
figure out how to use those tools, so we can try it that way Sunday?

It would be fun to watch the process.

If you can't get the lm-sensor related tools to work in Linux, I have
WinXP in Virtualbox. By your command.

Subject: [PLUG] Excessive LAN traffic
Message-ID: <4B4CD3C3.6040206@gmail.com>

I recently replaced my NFS server with a new Intel dual processor machine.

The moment I turned it on, I noticed that between it an my workstation 
there is a constant 25Mb/s of NFS read traffic, regardless of my activity.

My wife's workstation doesn't have this issue.

The main difference between these two workstations is that my 
workstation is running Karmic Koala.

I thought it might have been Beagle, but I stopped all the Beagle 
processes that I could and it made no difference.  Logging out did stop it.

I am having issues tracking down what the cause of this behavior is....

Has anyone else seen this type of behavior?

I haven't seen anything like this but using something like wireshark or
tcpdump should be able to tell you what is causes the thrashing across the
network.

Message-ID: <1263333338.3209.9.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

Under Linux it shows up as C-Media when I do an /sbin/lsusb.  I go to do
an alsaconf though and it doesn't detect it.  This usb speaker/mic cable
only seems to work in XP.  I got it from usbgear, it was supposed to
work in 98SE as well.  It doesn't.

It just says USB to AUDIO CABLE on it.  Has anyone gotten one of these
to work under Linux?

I seem to have an SIS video card, but I can't get better than 640x480 in
X.  Back to the sound issue, I try to open the audio control panel in
gnome and get a there are no mixer devices error.

I'm running Slackware 10.1 with the 2.6.10 kernel because my Logitech
quickcam seems to require this.  It appears that Slackware 13 isn't an
option.

I'm borderline tempted to change motherboards so I can use a normal
sound card.

As far as the video card is concerned, this is a Monorail 440BX chipset
PII 300 system where I don't know what the AGP slot can handle.  I'm
happy if I can do 1024x768.

Is this video card Linux compatible?  It just has a vga out,

I would say it's likely. I had this card:

And while I had to fight to get it to view the TV input, it always worked
just fine as a basic video card. (This was before GATOS made it into the
kernel. I don't know if it's easy now or not, because I don't have that card
in a system any more.)

I have a USB sound device that shows up as

C-Media Electronics, Inc. Audio Adapter

I often have to open up the control panel "pavucontrol" to point apps
at it.  Someday I will get around to writing a hotplug script to move
all audio player outputs to it when I plug it in.

It works great.

Yes. Lots of us (maybe not the majority, but still quite a few) like

I'm not sure about Parallels (I'm a VMware user, and have otherwise
only used VirtualBox and Virtual PC), but most virtualization packages
out there allow you to increase the amount of RAM the virtual machine
has. Have you tried increasing the amount of RAM? This often fixes
issues with hanging virtual machines.

I'd also suggest you try out different virtualization solutions. A
classmate of mine used VirtualBox on his iBook and he's quite
satisfied with it. One great advantage of VirtualBox is that it's
free. I've used VMware Workstation for a while (on Linux), and I'm
satisfied with it. You might want to give VMware Fusion--their Mac
version--a try.

A friend is in the hospital with pneumonia - tubes down the throat
and all.  His biggest complaint is that he can't communicate - he
can write on a pad if someone holds it.  He is a hardware geek,
and very bright (with ankylosing spondylitis and a lot of
autoimmune trouble).  

I would love to find a one-handed chording keyboard for him.  
He would learn it fast, and the task would keep his mind active.

Do any of you have a chording keyboard you can loan me?  I will
order one, but it will take a while to get here.

The HP series all
work, or at least I've yet to find one that doesn't. 

Having said
that...have you considered a wireless one?? WiFi connectivity for an MFC
is pretty handy.? I tote mine to where my wife wants to use it for a
project and then back to the computer room for normal use with no network
connection issues.

Though it isn't on your list of criteria think
about thermal inkjet vs normal - or the HP Pro line vs others.??
Thermal models provide water resistant printing.? It's not water proof,
but you can pour water on your finished documents, or spill coffee or drip
sweat or tears without smearing the printing.?

You may want to look into a small keyboard and arrange the keys for one
handed Dvor?k layout.  That should be quicker to learn and easier to find.

Try plugging it in and giving it a minute to try to mount.  Then run a fdisk
-l to list all the devices.  I doubt if it will find it, as it is most
likely a flaky USB to SATA adapter inside the drive.  I would recommend
taking it back and exchanging it, if it is still within the return period.

Well, i guess should have expected this: The nice folk at Printer Place 
tell me that they consider the OfficeJet (my 6120 cost under $150 new) 
"not repairable" 'cuz HP doesn't sell replacement parts, and because 
they can't provide assurance they'll be able to fix the problem 
(especially paper-handling) before their (reasonable for spendy 
printers) $88 hourly rate costs me more than the printer did new.

At least the scanning and fax features work (the latter only if you 
don't need to print a report/confirmation page).

Sigh,
Joe

since you can't make it (much) worse, you could always take it apart and 
see if you can find anything.  usually those kinds of issues are caused by 
the rubber and cork bits getting too dusty from use and there are some 
cleaners that will make them tacky again so they correctly pick up and 
hold paper the way that is needed to function.  think of it as an 
adventure.  :-)

Yes, it's time for the famous Linux Clinic again!

Bring your computer with that other evil OS and we'll install Linux on
it for you. Or bring your Linux computer and we'll fix problems. Or
just come and look over shoulders to see what Linux is all about.

We also have the latest versions of all the popular distros. Bring CDs
and we'll burn whatever you want. 

There will also be free coffee, cookies and other stuff that people
bring. And even if your tummy is too full for such things, come and
share the Linux gem?tlichkeit. 

There is room for complete newbies as well as old hands. All are
welcome.

Aside: I just discovered that the next version of Ubuntu (Lucid Lynx,
10.04) will come with a complete user manual in PDF format. Lucid Lynx
will be released on April 29. I will have the most recent release
candidate at the Clinic in case anyone wants to take it for a spin.
Lucid Lynx will be a LTS (Long Term Support) version of Ubuntu. It will
be supported on servers for five years and on desktops for three years. 

The Clinic is completely free.

The Clinic is held at Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Avenue in Portland, just
a couple blocks south of the Lucky Labrador on Hawthorne. The Clinic
runs from 1 pm to 5 pm. 

See y'all there!

Actually, I was going to ask if anyone had some rubber roller cleaner.  I
could use a squirt of it for my old printers.

Printing press operators use a lot of it, and they sell it at Avery over by
Produce Row.  Just figured I'd ask before buying a can and bringing it to
the Clinic.

Also, any recommendations for better mailing lists to post this to? I

Old issue, but hopefully there are new answers. I need a flatbed scanner

optional). I'd like to spend $50 or less. It will be used mostly to 
capture documents at around 150-300 DPI.

Thanks in advance,

I don't have any personal recommendations, but here's a very detailed 
list of hardware supported by sane-backends. A good reference or

You raise an excellent question. I've often thought why there isn't a 
place on the PLUG website where people looking to for gigs such as this 
could post a  resume, profile, work summary, etc.

I wouldn't mind hosting something like that, but it would have to be
in the LUG consciousness to be of any use.  I would assume, however,
that PLUG already would have a little space available and it would be
logical to put it there.

Aaron,

   http://www.sane-project.org lists most scanners and the degree of support
for each. More specificially, I can recommend the HP scanners; like their
printers they are well supported by linux.

   I have an HP 5200C that works perfectly for all my needs (documents, the
occasional photographic print). It's an older model with a USB connection
and should be available used for a low price. Check craigslist and eBay.

A Canon LiDE 20 or LiDE 30 will probably meet your needs.  I have a 
LiDE 20 that I got off of ebay.  It's not particularly fast, but it's 
fine for basic scanning.  It's powered by USB, so no extra adapter 
required.  Note that I have never tried to make the buttons work.  I 
suspect that might be a challenge.

Here's the sane device list:

I have an older HP S20 film and slide scanner which does a wonderful
job, but it is NOT supported in linux at all.  And I have been unable
to get it to run  in Virtual Box with various shades of Windoz.  So I
cannot recommend HP.

I've been using an LiDE 30 for several years, light duty, and it's always
'just worked', since before Dapper (I think I was using RedHat/Mandrake back
in those days).

I can echo this sentiment.  Canon LiDE 30 is excellent for light duty.

Another vote for old HPs. I have a 5300-something with an ADF
(document feeder), and it works just fine with Sane. I bought it on
eBay several years ago (it was someone's new old stock). I think it
sold for ~$20. Shipping was another $30.  :-)

And I have the LiDE 30. I can verify that it works fine with Sane. That
is, all the features of Sane work. Like Galen, I never tried the
buttons. Like the LiDE 20 it is not very fast, but has the advantage of
being completely powered by the USB port. I especially like the fact
that it is small and very lightweight. I have actually taken it to
the PSU library and used it as a personal photocopier.

At the same time I should add that when I bought it Canon had just come
out with a newer model, and the newer model was not supported. I had to
look around for a store that still had the LiDE 30 in stock. I paid $90
for it and that was a couple years ago, so you should be able to find
one for half that online somewhere.

Hmm, that's interesting. It seems that the message relay functionality 
has been disabled on tha mta. Which is a common security configuration 
for an "enterprise" mta. But this is supposed to be an internet mta.

I'm curious as to what you mean by a Google hosted domain? I wonder if 
MS is trying to be all cloak & dagger with email exchanges or if it's 
just a mis-configuration...

Thanks for all the input. I've tried several models from local staples/office 
depot style stores and while they were similar in number (CanoScan LiDE 200, 
for example), none they had worked. I need to pay closer attention to the 
specific model numbers in the SANE list :)

thanks to all who responded with good suggestions.

By the time i had time to try them out, i was able (once again) to 
connect to all four IM services i use. Between reporting the problem and 
discovering it miraculously cured, i installed the latest updates 
(including kernel 2.6.31-17) - i wonder if that had something to do with it.

The only difference between my system software on the problem machine 
and my office machine is that the personal box uses 64-bit Karmic, and 
the office uses 32-bit. Since my query, i found 1 other user on Ubuntu 
Forums who had a similar issue. Now i almost wish it would happen again, 
just to go through the recommended diagnostics....

The last real estate company I was with switched to an e-mail system

FWIW, we use /etc/ssh/sshd_config + /etc/group to handle users and
/etc/hosts.allow to handle IPs and hostnames.

For example, we created the group sshdusers:

$ sudo addgroup --system sshdusers

then added users to the group sshdusers:

$ user=${USER}
$ sudo usermod -a -G sshdusers $user

then added this line to /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

$ sudo grep AllowGroups /etc/ssh/sshd_config
AllowGroups sshdusers

and restarted sshd:

$ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart

If there are a large number of machines, then you may want to consider
using NIS or LDAP.

> differences for me.

In brief, (from "man hosts_access") the rules are this:

1) tcpwrappers stops on the first match
2) it checks hosts.allow first
3) it checks hosts.deny second
4) if no match, defaults to allow

However, you can get away with just the /etc/hosts.allow file.  In
addition, you can use a separate file containing a list of hostnames,
IP addresses, or patterns.  For example:

$ sudo tail -n +1 /etc/hosts.* | grep -v '^#'
==> /etc/hosts.allow <==
ALL : /etc/hosts.allow.list
ALL : /etc/hosts.deny.list : DENY

==> /etc/hosts.allow.list <==
127.0.0.0/29

==> /etc/hosts.deny <==

==> /etc/hosts.deny.list <==
127.0.0.2

In the above example setup, ssh will work from the localhost to all
127.0.0.x IP addresses except, 127.0.0.2.  That's because, of two
reasons:

1) 127.0.0.2 does not match 127.0.0.0/29 in the allow file
2) 127.0.0.2 does match 127.0.0.2 in the deny file

All other 127.0.0.x IP addresses do work because the default is to
allow all.  To change the default behaviour to deny, replace the last
line with this line in /etc/hosts.allow:

ALL : ALL : DENY

With that change, all IPs 127.0.0.{1,3..7} IP addresses will work, but
all others will be denied, including 127.0.0.2.

HTH.  Good luck and let us know how things works for you.

Regards,
- Robert

Message-ID: <20100116185253.26f53d05@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I have been using Fedora 11, x86_64 for about a month now. It just
occurred to me to check what fileystem Fedora installed. I recall
during the installation I told it to use the entire hard disk and just
clicked OK on the defaults. Turns out that it created a 200 MB ext3
boot partition and a logical volume of 297 GB which contains an ext4
root partition and a small swap partition.

I have several rescue CDs, from Knoppix to smaller command line only
disks. Guess what? They're all too old to be able to fix an ext4
filesystem. My very, very dim understanding is that older systems
(with ext3) can read/write to an ext4 filesystem, but the older e2fsck
won't work. I may well be wrong about the read/write - that is, I may
have it backwards.

Fedora started using ext4 with Fedora 10. Ubuntu made it optional with
Jaunty, and Karmic uses it exclusively.

It's Clinic Eve, so I am downloading some more recent rescue CDs. At
the Clinic tomorrow I will boot them and see which ones can deal with
my ext4 root partition.

ext4 is a stopgap version of ext. It adds some features that are on
the roadmap for btrfs. It figures that Fedora would be all over ext4,
even though it isn't really even intended to last once btrfs comes
out. If I were in your shoes, I would avoid it.

I finally found the forwards compatibility answer:

.. Compatibility
    The ext4 filesystem is backward compatible with ext3 and ext2,
making it possible to mount ext3 and ext2 filesystems as ext4. This
will already slightly improve performance, because certain new features
of ext4 can also be used with ext3 and ext2, such as the new block
allocation algorithm.

    The ext3 file system is partially forward compatible with ext4,
    that is, an ext4 filesystem can be mounted as an ext3 partition
    (using "ext3" as the filesystem type when mounting). However, if
    the ext4 partition uses extents (a major new feature of ext4), then
    the ability to mount the file system as ext3 is lost. 
<Wikipedia>

If you have any files over 512 MB on an ext4 filesystem you will
definitely have extents. Just one distro ISO would render your
filesystem unmountable by an older live CD.

Ext4 gives a me noticeable increase in performance over ext3 and has given
me no problems.  I concluded that ext4 is worth the risk.  Google has
evidently come to a similar conclusion:

First, the Fedora 11 install utility did not give me a choice as to
filesystems. And, while upgrading from ext3 to ext4 is fairly trivial,
you can't go the other way without reformatting and reinstalling. In
short, I am more or less stuck with it.

But after spending a couple hours reading about it I conclude that it
is very stable and safe. I notice that a lot of file activities with
Scribus and OOo are a lot faster than they were under Jaunty. However, I
can't ascribe that to ext4 over ext3 because I now have a newer kernel,
a different distro, newer versions of Scribus and OOo, and even a new
hard disk. Nevertheless, I am happy with ext4.

A couple questions about btrfs:

1) Is there any guesstimate as to when it will be declared stable and
incorporated into the kernel?

2) Will a user be able to upgrade from ext4 to btrfs without
reformatting and reinstalling?

I'll jump in here-

First, Fedora is a bleeding edge distro, upgrade cycle is 6 months (official
support cycle is 12 months).
Ext4 is on the forefront, right now.  Whether it still is on the forefront
in 5 years is, at least as far as $CURRENT_RELEASE is concerned, somewhat
irrelevant.

If you want Fedora without ext4, just choose "Custom" during the install
process, and format the partitions however you want (within the supported
parameters).  Ext2, Ext3, XFS, JFS, I think maybe ZFS, VFAT, and so on.

The aim of the Fedora project is to present the user base with the latest
and greatest at the time of release, as well as be a test platform for
future releases of RHEL.

If you don't want bleeding edge, there are plenty of other distros out
there.  No need to knock it.

Plus the aforementioned plans for Google to move to Ext4 sounds rather
promising for the future of the platform to me.

Just to clarify about Ubuntu: ext4 is the default filesystem Karmic will 
use, but you can still choose from many other filesystems if you select 
the Advanced partitioning option, as always. So "exclusively" probably 
wasn't the word you meant to use, but rather "by default."

I think it's an interesting idea, but I would be concerned about the small 
number of less than scrupulous recruiters posting a bunch of crap that would 
make it nearly useless for it's intended use.  Like nearly every job and 
resume site on the net.

It's not for recruiters to post, it's for PLUG members to post and for friends of PLUG members
who are looking for people for gigs/projects. For example, somebody on PLUG knows someone 
who is looking for help on a project, they direct them to the PLUG site with a profiles of people who
are avail for "hired gun" type work...

Personally, I like the idea.

However, the issue I see is that there are recruiters who plant bogus resumes 
in sites like you are talking about in order to find out about gigs that 
haven't been posted elsewhere.  

I suspect, dealing with people who try to game such a site will be a lot 
easier if such things are considered during the design of the site.

We have already seen a kind of bulletin board for pics on the #orlug
site.  Something similar could be done.  Of course, it would be abuse
to the beast of burden to maintain it if people were always
updating/adding/removing their resumes.  That sort of thing could be
deterred, however, by public whippings or something of the sort.

Personally I would never post my resume online. My LinkedIn profile has 
a summary of my background and experience, but that's as far as I would go.

I'm not sure if there are any laws against this in Oregon, but where I'm 
from I've heard of a couple of cases where the following scenario has 
occurred:

1. Recruiter is authorized to head-hunt for a job opening at a company, 
usually in a non-exclusive manner (i.e, the company is also accepting 
candidates directly).

2. The unscrupulous recruiter posts a fake job ad on various sites (on 
Craigslist this is the easiest) collecting resumes of people likely to 
apply for aforementioned job.

3. Now if one of those people who gave the recruiter their resume gets 
the job by applying directly for it, the recruiter claims that the 
candidate and/or employer was trying to circumvent the recruiter to 
avoid paying the finder's fee.

Clearly this is fraudulent behavior, but that doesn't help you if you 
get caught up in the mess.

The best way to avoid it is to never submit your resume if you don't 
know where it's going. Craigslist postings that don't mention the 
company name are red flags to be avoided in particular.

I apologize if this post is a bit too off-topic.

Subject: [PLUG] Reprogramming screen EDID (2)
Message-ID: <20100118061710.GA2428@gate.kl-ic.com>

Today at the clinic, we attempted to convert a second Thinkpad
T60 to QXGA.  Didn't work out as expected.

As you may recall, the screen EDID ROM needs to be reprogrammed so
the Thinkpad BIOS will talk to it.  

For the first screen, I used the WinXP that the laptop came with,
downloaded Powerstrip and registered it for $30, then jumped through
more hoops to get the special 16 bit hex password needed to /write/
to the screen.  It turns out that the software only works with the
same identical hardware - I would have to buy another copy of 
Powerstrip for each screen, and jump through more hoops.  I can
try moving the new screen to the first T60, but I would rather not
risk breaking it.

We next looked at using i2c-tools.   However, the main scanning tool,
i2cdetect, which promiscuously looks for all the I2C addressable 
components, contains this warning message for one of the options:

-   This is known to corrupt the Atmel AT24RF08 EEPROM found
-   on many IBM Thinkpad laptops.

Yikes!  We decided caution was the better part of valor, and did
not try.

But ...
It occured to me this evening that the X driver looks at the
EDID ROM as well.  Sure enough, at "address 0xa0" on the I2C bus,
the open source version of the ATI driver locates the panel by
name, and produces the bytes of the EDID ROM.  I don't know much
about I2C, but I suspect that writing the ROM is not that much
different than reading it ( Galen, correct me if I am wrong ). 
With the address, we don't need to look at the whole machine
promiscuously, just the display ROM.

So, we may be able to look at the code for the open source version
of the ATI driver, and for the I2C-tools, and build a small
program that safely programs the display without risking bricking
the laptop.  

It would be extra cool if we could put said program on a CD
( Linux or FreeDOS ) that does some testing then reprograms the
EDID automagically. 

Comments?  Anybody want to help with some code?

Okay, this is starting to get a bit like the game "heard it through the 
grapevine"

Let me reiterate for clarification how this thread evolved and what the 
relevant points are:

1. A PLUG member post about a friend who is looking for some Sys Admin 
help and wants to know if he should (A) Post it to another mailing list 
and (B) Is it bad mailing list etiquette to post his resume.

2. I tell him about the [PLUG-jobs] list. Which for informal gigs/projs 
through people who are in some way associated w. PLUG might or might not 
be the most appropriate place...

3. The Orig Poster posts to plug-jobs

4. "Jackman" responds and asks if it's good mailing list etiquette to 
respond on the list w. his resume.

5. I throw out the idea of having a place where people who are 
interested in picking-up gigs/projs could post a short summary of their 
skills/experience with contact info for people who are affiliated with 
PLUG to go look at when then need to find a 'hired gun'.

6. A bunch of people freak out about unscrupulous recruiters, laws 
around job recruiting, and their personal opinion on the wheres, whats, 
and whys the post their post their work history.

So, let's try this again shall we?

Here's what I'm suggesting, a page on the PLUG site for PLUG members who 
are interested in picking up gigs/projs with people who are somehow 
affiliated w. PLUG.

Let me try to make a few things *crystal* clear...

1. This is *not* for recruiters nor is it for *job postings*.
2. If *you* are not interested in doing this, that's fine, don't do it, 
but I'm not interest in hearing excuses, horror stories, etc...
3. This is for the people that ask someone who is an existing PLUG 
member the question
"hey do you know someone who can do x, y, z".
And the PLUG member responds, "no, but go to the PLUG site and maybe 
someone who can do x, y, z and is looking for 'hired gun' work has a 
work skill/experience profile posted"
That person looking for the 'hired gun' goes to the PLUG web site, finds 
a person or two they think might be qualified and then contacts them.

Pretty simple, useful, and harmless, eh?

So, here's what I'm asking.

A. Is anyone interested in posting a brief summary of their 
skills/experience for 'hired gun' work for people who are in one or 
another associated with PLUG?

B. Who decides whether or not we can do something like this on the PLUG 
web site.

Thank you in advance for reading this thoroughly and responding 
appropriately.

I just found out about this alternative operating system where the major

tool.  It is primarily a one man project and it looks like he intends
to keep it that way.  Visopsys stands for visual operating system.

It looks like the project is on the verge of a new release.

I know visopsys isn't Linux, but I thought it might be interesting
to someone who wants a really good partitioning tool.  The main

It appears to be pre dovecot and it uses a package called imapd.
Unfortunately, I have no idea where the home directory for imap
mail folders is set.  Pine has no problem, it doesn't seem to
try and access imap folders other than the inbox.  Evolution on 
the other hand lists every file in the user's home directory as 
a potential mail folder.

Anyone know how to get around this bug?

Another problem is that evolution doesn't seem smart enough to
realize that I use a different mail server for my private email
than I use for my public email accounts.  The effect is, I can't
send email from evolution via my private system.

Short of getting into virtual mail boxes, how can I host the mail
folders in an area that is separate from users home directories?

I'm using postfix as the mta for my private email system, version
2.0.20 precisely.

Only if I am able to easily update my data and somebody else will keep

I think it is a great idea to have a place where PLUG job seekers can
get the inside scoop on employment opportunities. These are tough
times, and the unemployed need all the help they can get. Even in good
times, all the best jobs I've had were obtained via
word-of-mouth. Only a person who is already gainfully employed would
object to such a thing. And the answer for such a person is simple:
ignore it, it doesn't apply to you.

I just started a 5-year trek through school. When I get out, I will be
looking for jobs in the Pacific Northwest because that's where a
computer programmer can expect to find a good job and the best
possible living environment (vs SoCal or the East Coast). I would very
much like to keep my finger on the pulse of the Portland job scene so
I don't come in cold.

If there is some work to be done in writing the webapp for this tool,
I can help.

Subject: [PLUG] Winmodem and VirtualBox?
Message-ID: <4B54A8EC.4000309@wescottdesign.com>

Had an "aha!" moment this morning -- I have a Winmodem, and I have 
VirtualBox with a Windows installed image, so maybe I can use my 
Winmodem to fax stuff!

No luck so far -- I can't figure out how to make the Winmodem visible to 
Windows under the 'box'.

Anyone have success with this?  I've got the 'free binary only' version 
of VirtualBox that lets me turn on USB, but doesn't have all the bells 
and whistles of the $$$ version.

Which distro are you using as your host OS? On some older versions of 
Ubuntu I've had to follow an online guide to get usbfs set up correctly. 
Here is one such guide:

http://www.arsgeek.com/2007/10/24/get-usb-devices-mounted-on-your-virtualbox-xp-machine-in-gutsy-ubuntu-710/

This is pretty dated but it may offer the clues you need.

Karmic, but as far as I know the modem is on the PCI bus, not USB -- 
should I be looking at the USB bus anyway?

Subject: [PLUG] QXGA T60 - EDID hardware reprogramming, the code
Message-ID: <20100118190005.GA3812@gate.kl-ic.com>

I exchanged email with Alan Chan, the fellow I got the T60
from, and an expert on the QXGA (2048x1536) upgrade.  He does
this with hardware; a parallel port I2C driver, and an adapter
to the display cable (along with a 3.3V supply).  I may make
a small EC board with a parallel port driver on one side and a 
display cable connector on the other.  

I'm still partial to a program that does this, if we can do
so safely.  BTW, the proper I2C port is 0x60, not 0xA0 per
the previous email.

I'm also digging into the EDID bits, and I may have found out
why the display is not suspending properly.  The new code has
bits set for features like active-off, suspend, and standby,
which the original code does not.  I suspect the driver assumes
that it can keep the panel alive in low power mode during 
suspend, when it should be saving the screen bits on disk and
shutting down properly.  That could explain quite a lot.

Sorry, I thought from your original post that the modem was USB-based. 
You shouldn't need to do anything with usbfs to make it work if it's a 
PCI card.

If somebody with spare time wants to help PLUG, help fix the wiki. 
That would be a great place for resumes and vanity pages.

Unfortunately, the wiki needs some security plugins and some TLC.
When it is properly configured, we can move the front page
pdxlinux.org content to an immutable wiki page, and re-organize
the content around that (some might disagree - debate that on 
the list).  Temporary root access would be needed to make changes
to httpd.conf and the moinmoin config files.  

If you've got the skills and the time, please contact Wil Cooley.
And if you've got less skill, but want to do something to help 
out, please add useful content to the wiki after it is repaired,
watch for vandalism, etc. 

PLUG runs on volunteer help.  The wiki is a very public way to 
help.  The next time you are looking for a job, stand out from
the crowd by showing off your skills where hiring managers can
see the results.  Resumes are marginally helpful, but demonstrated
skills, writing ability, and cheerful helpfulness are what
enlightened managers are looking for.

I double-checked, and it doesn't show up on the USB bus.

It also isn't visible to the modem software driver disk that came with 
the machine (grr).

Argh.  Maybe I just need to go buy a real modem; I've been trying to 
avoid that, as it (a) costs money, and (b) seems like getting one that 
supports faxing will be a pain.

I'd be surprised if it were.  USB, serial and parallel passthrough is
possible through virtual-hardware magick, but generic PCI passthough is
quite difficult.

Not so hard at FreeGeek (or maybe SurplusGizmos), and you might be able to
make your softmodem work anyway - FAX is actually a bit easier in software
than, say, 56k data.  See about one page down on:
http://hylafax.sourceforge.net/howto/install.php

I'd say "bring it to Linux Clinic" but the last one wasn't exactly a series
of rousing successes. :)

Maybe it was the lack of Pinguinos,

It's a Broadcom, the last time I checked (~ six months ago) there wasn't 
any support for it and I got the general impression that Broadcom is 
either hostile to Linux or at least pigheadedly indifferent.

#1 son is interning at FreeGeek -- I'll see if I can induce him to find 
me a real modem.

Subject: [PLUG] Trying to create a link
Message-ID: <20100119115614.1fce8b05@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I have never used the ln command before, but now I need to.

The problem is that the no-go version of OOo 3.1.1 that Fedora has in
their repositories removes a lot of features. Evidently Fedora thought
their users wouldn't notice. I need the features, so I uninstalled the
Fedora version and then installed the official OOo version from
www.openoffice.org.

Everything was cool when I first launched it. But when I tried to
launch it again it would not launch. From the command line I get the
error message that it can't find libuno_sal.so.3. Much googling reveals
that for some reason the link to it gets broken when the official
version of OOo is installed on Fedora. (And only Fedora.)

Unfortunately, the instructions for how to fix it apply only to earlier
versions of OOo, and the folder structure of my version is different.
In /opt/ I have:

openoffice.org
	basis3.1
	help
	presets
	program
	share
	ure-link <- Nautilus says this link is broken

openoffice.org3
	basis-link <- Nautilus shows this with a folder icon and a link
   		arrow. The link points to the above basis3.1 folder
   	help 
	presets
	program
	share
	ure-link <- Nautilus says this link is broken

First I changed directory to the /opt/openoffice.org3 folder. Then (as
root) I used mv to rename the ure-link to ure-link.old. When I did so
Nautilus suddenly changed ure-link to ure-link.old in both folders. I'm
not clear why that happened. Was it because of the basis-link folder?

Then I used "ln /usr/lib64/openoffice.org/ure/lib/libuno_sal.so.3
ure-link" to create a link to the libuno_sal.so.3 file. This created a
file in both folders named ure-link. But I must not have done it right
because Nautilus says it is a shared library, not a link. And OOo still
won't launch.

I read man ln but couldn't understand very much of it. How can I
recreate the ure-link so it points to the libuno_sal.so.3 library?

Also, if someone else has OOo 3.1.1 installed, it might be helpful to
know what your folder structure is like. I suspect that one of the
folders was created by Fedora when it installed its version of OOo, and
the other was created when I installed the real OOo. But I can't tell
which is which. Maybe I can just rename one of them to get it out of
the picture.

 libuno_sal.so.3 is a shared library, so I suspect your link worked
correctly, but you are now having a different issue. Did you check to see if
the error changed?

I've never had a need to create a hard link, which is what is created by 
default when you don't specify the "-s" option for a symbolic link. I've 
used a soft link for for pointing at the location for the file the link 
references.

My understanding is that hard links are used for to identifying the 
specific location of physical data. And they will always refer to the 
source even if moved or removed. Whereas a symbolic link will break...

Either should work fine for John's situation. Though I agree that a symlink
is technically more correct.

Thanks for the replies.

First, having created the link, I get the same error message when I try
to launch OOo.

I suspected from the beginning that the openoffice.org3 folder was the
new one. The fact that Mike has only an openoffice.org folder lends
credence to this supposition. Why I have two is a mystery. 

I also tried renaming each folder in turn and then trying to launch OOo.
Not only could it not find libuno_so.3, it couldn't even find the
program file. It couldn't find the program file regardless of which
folder was renamed. Apparently it needs both folders. Another mystery.

At this point I think it is hopelessly borked. I am going to uninstall
everything and then try again. Before reinstalling I am going to move
both the folders to a distant planet. I think I'm also going to use
Nautilus to search on openoffice* and remove every other file on the
computer, except my config folder in ~/. Maybe a squeaky clean fresh
install will get it working. 

The really weird part is that it launches right after installing it,
but the second time you try to launch it you get the error message that
it can't find the libuno_so.3 file. Apparently the mere act of
launching it causes it to soil itself.

Ah, I thought I recalled you mentioning "Fedora". I found this thread 
regarding probs w. the Fedora OOo pkg vs. the pkg from OOo.

Happy news.

After removing all vestiges of OOo and reinstalling, it launches. Not
only did it launch, but after shutting it down it can be launched
again. I even rebooted and it still launches fine.

So <crossing fingers> it appears I have fixed whatever was wrong with
it.

Strangely, I note that it recreated both folders in /opt/. But the
structures of the folders is different. That is, the ure-link is now a
folder icon, and it is located within a different folder. And Nautilus
does not report it as broken.

Subject: [PLUG] Recommended wifi router for OpenWRT?
Message-ID: <4B563F78.3000302@zenlinux.com>

Hello,

I'd like to pick up a wifi router that I can run the latest release of 
OpenWRT on, which has plenty of flash space for experimentation. Can 
someone suggest a specific model and hardware version for me to look at? 
If it's currently available on NewEgg for under $125, I would find that 
to be ideal.

Thanks,

Scott

I had already found that page, and several other similar pages. Most of
them related to older versions of OOo / Fedora so the instructions did
not match my problem.

And I just now discovered what happened - user error. You see, until a
couple months ago I lived in the Debian world, so I was unfamiliar with
using yum. 

When I installed the packages from OOo the first time I followed their
instructions and used the rpm command from within the folder containing
the .rpm packages. But there is another package in a subfolder called
desktop-integration. I distinctly remember installing it with yum
because rpm wouldn't install it.

This time around I did the same thing, but I noticed that yum was
downloading something. I quickly used yum to erase the package that it
downloaded, and then read more carefully the error line from the
previous attempt with rpm. It wouldn't install it because there was a
later package already installed. So this time I uninstalled the later
existing package with yum and then installed the one from OOo with rpm.

I get it now:

apt-get / aptitude = yum
dpkg = rpm

The whole problem was caused by using the wrong desktop integration
package for the version of OOo I had installed. And as corroboration,
Update Software now lists an update available for the package. 

I'm off to figure out how to make yum ignore that particular update,
lest I mistakenly install it some day.

What does "plenty" mean? Do you want 802.11n? The classic answer here is 
the WRT54GL. Or the WRT320N maybe? This is for DD though. I don't use 
OpenWRT.

Plenty just means I'd prefer not to buy a router model that is 
especially anemic when it comes to available disk space. I'm not exactly 
sure yet what I will be running on it, but I'd like as much flexibility 
as possible.

In my cursory Google searches on this topic it appears that not all 
hardware revisions of the WRT54GL have the same processor and work with 
OpenWRT. Is that true?

- I don't know about the "GL" series, but version 5 WRT54G and WRT54GS cannot be flashed to OpenWrt
(they have less memory, and run a version of VxWorks, rather than linux).

The WRT54GL will definitely support openwrt.  I have 3 of them.
   http://wiki.openwrt.org/oldwiki/hardware/linksys
That said, I don't know that the WRT54GL is the thing to get now.  I'm 
sure if Russell has the time, he will make a recommendation.

Why can't it? You can put DD-WRT on them. There is a method to remove 
VXWorks. The reasons not to get the non-L version is the limited memory 
and the fact that the antennas are now non-removable.

At this point however it's probably time to start looking at N capable 
hardware.

Well, I guess "can't" in most cases is more about how much time, energy, 
effort, and skill you want to invest...

As for "N", call me old school, but ol' B continues to work just fine 
for my needs. But then again, I'm one of those guys that you had to pry 
the Motorola Star-tac out of my hands too... ;-)

I have used OpenWrt on PC Engines Alix[1] boards (x86), Soekris
net4826 (x86)[2], Linksys WRT54GL[3], Buffalo WHR-G54S and
WHR-HP-G54[4], Netgear WGT634U[5].  We have some Linksys WRT54GL's
here more or less surplus.  We aren't using them so much nowadays
because our gateway devices need 8meg of flash and 32meg of RAM and
the WRTs only have 4 meg of flash.  But, depending on what you are
doing that might be enough.  If we weren't running perl on our
gateways, it would be enough.  The WGT634U's work great and have some
nice features (host USB, miniPCI slot, etc), but they were EOL'd about
5 years ago, so finding one might be a problem.

Another thing to look at are the Ubiquiti devices (NanoStation[6][7],
PicoStation[8], Bullet[9]), particularly if you don't need a bunch of
LAN ports.  You could get a RouterStation[10] and add a mini-PCI radio
(atheros-based is recommended) for probably under $125 and that has
three ethernet interfaces (one WAN and two LAN, although that is
somewhat flexible).  The RouterStation Pro[11] even has gigE.  They
all have manufacturer support for OpenWrt (but the stock firmware
"AirOS" is pretty good too, amazingly good relative to anything i've
ever seen in COTS stuff).

There are currently available consumer-off-the-shelf devices that I
know people are working on with OpenWrt, but I have not used them
myself.  We still have a supply of the Netgear WGT634U that we are
working our way through, so I use those when I need something and
haven't been motivated to look beyond those.

For maximum hackability, the Alix is awesome.  Way overpowered in some
ways (500MHz x86 CPU, 256M SDRAM, CF slot for upto numerous gigs of
Flash), but edging a little over your price point by the time you get
done.  The one we have[12] even has a 44-pin IDE header for plugging
in a laptop harddisk.

When hacking on wireless routers, consumer-off-the-shelf is not always
the way to go, and places like newegg are often not the best sources.
It can still be fun, but since manufacturers change chipsets on a whim
without bothering to change model numbers, you can easily find
yourself high-and-dry.  You have to be very careful to know what you
are getting.

I put the micro version of DD-WRT on some v6 and v7 versions of
Linksys WRT's and they "work", but there is nothing on them but the
web interface and very basic functionality.  There is a shell you can
connect to, but no commands of note to run.

OpenWrt basically made the decision that, yeah as a party trick you
could get a Linux kernel on the smaller 2M flash versions, but the
userspace was then so constrained that it wasn't worth the contortions
given what you ended up with.  So, officially, OpenWrt doesn't support
devices with less than 4M of flash.

My limited experience with 11n has not been favorable. a) it's a bit
of a spectrum pig in an already limited spectrum; and b) the host-mode
support is not stellar yet (afaik).  802.11g is still faster than most
people's internet connections, which is often what you are connecting
to anyway.

DD-Wrt isn't OpenWrt and vice versa.  OpenWrt has had a list of
supported hardware too, but the thing that often makes these lists not
so useful is that most of the devices on the list tend to be no longer
available at retail establishments.  Often times, the lifecycle of
consumer products is amazingly short.

I've been looking for the same thing.
Here is what I have found.

Linksys WRT54G version 3 or 3.1 via craig's list or e-bay
Linksys WRT54GL from any source
Linksys WRT54G-TM This is the T-Mobile Hotspot that you can find on
E-bay.  These have double the memory
    and heat sinked processor.

I would also recommend the ASUS line of wireless routers WL500g2
Premium is nice plus it can also attach a USB hard drive for
addition storage.


My recommendation.  Linksys WRT54G-TM or Asus WL500G2 Premium.

Sure, I understand--I guess I thought it would be helpful to answer the
"which router has plenty of flash space" question.

Plug Advanced Topics is scheduled for Tonight, Wednesday the 20th at
Roots Organic Brewery at 1520 SE 7th, a block from SE Hawthorn.

Dwight Hubbard of Effective Automation Solutions will give a
presentation entitled:

Automated Failure Recovery/High Availability

The discussion will include different types of high of high availability
and will go over setting up a simple highly available web environment
using reverse proxies and failover clustering.

If time is available, we'll extend this to a more complex environment
that provides highly available virtualization clustering.

Thank you Nu Tech Software Solutions for the donation of two 1U systems
for the live demonstration. Yes live! Hecklers are asked to refrain from
using water baloons.

I don't think that was me.  Or if it was, it was heavily qualified.
Or should have been.  Or was more than a few months.  The last time I
mentioned it on PLUG (near as I can tell) in a favorable light was
almost 2 years ago.

FWIW I've found the the Linksys GL's capable of running DD-WRT at
Goodwill quite often. So that might be another source you might check
into.

Message-ID: <f72d4c6a1001200954i168b22a2rb3427223ab1a4e77@mail.gmail.com>

 My network problem continues. Here is as concise a description as I can muster:

1) New PK5000 Quest DSL router cabled to my desktop, my only computer.
2) Typically I power both the router and the desktop down and up a few
times a day.
3) Failure means that pings to the router at 192.168.0.1 go unanswered.
4) Failure has thus-far occurred only at boot.  Once it fails, it
stays failed until reboot.  Once it works, it stays working until
perhaps the next boot.
5) Failures are random.  The last full run of non-failures was 10 days.
6) Power-cycling the modem does not fix the problem. In fact, this
morning after a boot which produced a failure I shut down the
computer, powered off the desktop (switch on tower) for 10 minutes
with the modem continuosly powered, rebooted and the network
functioned.
7) I have run nmap -sU, ethtool eth0, route -n, arp -v, ethtool -S
eth0, and perhaps some others. The only observation I can report is
that when the network is up ethtool eth0 has an entry "1000baseT/Full"
under "Advertised link modes" that is absent when the network is down.

I conclude that item 6) absolves the router. Does 7) mean anything?

Any suggestions for further diagnostics? My intention at present is to
repeatedly reboot at the next failure without interupting the power
until either the network comes up, or I become convinced that it is
not going to ever come up.  If the network comes up, then the power
cycling becomes a red herring.  If not, then...

Maybe force it to 100baseT full duplex instead of gigabit. Maybe auto
negotiation is having trouble?

Have you tried a different computer, or at least a different NIC?

Would love to try what you suggest, except I do not understand.  Is
this something that I can do when the network is in the failed state?

No.  But I have a borrowed NIC, still sealed  in the box. The present
network is on the MB.  Putting the new card in is on my list.  Getting
the new card functional is something I have no experience with, so I
have hesitated for fear of messing something up or obscuring the
current problem.

network barfs

Okay, so let me see if I got this straight? Networking only fails upon 
bootup and when it doesn't work you can't ping the router and you don't 
see an entry "1000baseT/Full"under "Advertised link modes"?

Okay, so lets start from OSI layer 1 and work up.

1. When networking fails upon bootup are there lights on your ethernet 
ports on the computer and on the router?

2. When you run the command "ifconfig -a", is the eth interface listed? 
Does it have an ip addr?

3A. If the eth interface is listed, what happens if you attempt to 
manually bring up the eth interface with "ifup eth#" command.

Does it say it's already configured?

root at mc-goose:~# "ifup eth2"
ifup: interface eth2 already configured

Or does is say throw an error?

3B.  If the eth interface is *not* listed, what happens if you grep 
dmesg for that interface, such as:

root at mc-goose:~# "dmesg | grep eth0"

0000:02:00.0: eth0: (PCI Express:2.5GB/s:Width x1) 00:15:58:82:11:2e
0000:02:00.0: eth0: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Connection
0000:02:00.0: eth0: MAC: 2, PHY: 2, PBA No: 005301-003

With mii-tool and ethtool you can change default settings of network 
interfaces for such things as enabling/disabling auto-negotiation and/or 
forcing the speed/duplex.

What I've discovered with auto-negotiation is the same with other 
standards, not everyone interprets or implements them the same. If you 
have Intel or 3COM NICs on both ends auto-neg works flawlessly. You get 
two different vendors on each end, especially if they're consumer level 
products and it's pretty much a crap shoot.

Nice idea, but:

sudo mii-tool -v
SIOCGMIIPHY on 'eth0' failed: Operation not supported
no MII interfaces found

According to the man page I think this means that my network hardware
does not support MII queries.  My MB is an ASUS M3N78-VM.

The manual mentions Marvell Gigabit LAN controller.

lspci -v says:

It should be clear to readers of this that my confusion at these two

Gone off Googling  Marvell Gigabit LAN and MCP78S [GeForce 8200] Ethernet

Correct.

It is up now (obviously, as it is my only communication route), but I
recall seeing lights at the computer when it was in failed mode.  On
the next failure I will make note of which lights and which color.
When the network is broken the lights on the modem are the same as
when the network is up.

I have not tried that without first running ifdown.  Add that to my list.

Unfortunately I cannot say what was going on at the time. I believe
the network was up, but perhaps this indicates a problem occurring
while the machine is up (as opposed to just during boot).  I have had
problems with Evolution locking up, requiring "killev" action.  Next
time this occurs I will check dmesg and the kernel log.

See my other post about MII-tool:

sudo mii-tool -v
SIOCGMIIPHY on 'eth0' failed: Operation not supported
no MII interfaces found

Thanks for your step-by-step.  Just what I need.

Have you tried using another patch cable, just to rule out the possibility
of it being the network cable?  If this is a wireless interface, please
ignore this post

I have tried two different cables.  I intend to try a third when the
failure occurs again.

Denis,
It isn't entirely a surprise that mii-tool fails because I haven't
used it in years, I wasn't sure what support it might have or not have
with gigabit interfaces, worth a shot though.

That said, Mike offered some good suggestions and it looks like the
interface does come up and has an IP which leads me to believe perhaps
it's a route issue. When it fails can you run /sbin/route -a (I
believe that's the correct flag, someone correct me if I'm wrong). And
post to the list so we can take a gander at it.

Thanks,
Drew-

Keith had suggested route -n earlier, so I tried it:
When network is broken or functioning it is the same:
parents at R2D4:~$ sudo route -n
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
192.168.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
169.254.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     1000   0        0 eth0
0.0.0.0         192.168.0.1     0.0.0.0         UG    100    0        0 eth0

I will look into the man pages to see if another option would be better.

I think route -n is what I was thinking of. So disregard what I wrote.
Ok .. so next thing I'm thinking of is that the PK5000 according to
the docs I pulled up is 10/100BaseT and since you have a Gigabit NIC,
I'm starting to lean towards a negotiation error of some sort or too
many errored frames.

I would try the extra NIC. As far as setting it up, shouldn't be too
hard. You should be able to disable on the onboard one in the BIOS. If
not, NetworkManager should let you configure the new one pretty
quickly.

Auto-neg probs would certainly come more into play during bootup. If in fact 
the PK5000 supports only 10/100BaseT and your onboard NIC is 1000BaseT then I 
would definitely try disabling auto-neg and forcing speed/dup on your NIC.

Here's a good write-up on how to use ethtool to do it.

http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/howto-linux-add-ethtool-duplex-settings-permanent.html

I wonder also if you can't replicate the problem by stopping and starting the 
networking daemon which is akin to rebooting as far as the NIC and tcp/ip stack is concerned?

/etc/init.d/network restart

Because if you can this would narrow the problem down to network connection 
initiation, which points to auto-neg probs...

Most of what mii-tool did has been merged into ethtool.  Try ethtool instead.

Note: if the interface could not be brought up or never brought
ifconfig won't show anything.
ip cmd will show details as long as the kernel detected the interface.
use:
ip link

sudo ethtool eth0

Settings for eth0:
	Supported ports: [ MII ]
	Supported link modes:   10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full
	                        100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full
	                        1000baseT/Full
	Supports auto-negotiation: Yes
	Advertised link modes:  10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full
	                        100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full
	                        1000baseT/Full
	Advertised auto-negotiation: Yes
	Speed: 100Mb/s
	Duplex: Full
	Port: MII
	PHYAD: 3
	Transceiver: external
	Auto-negotiation: on
	Supports Wake-on: g
	Wake-on: d
	Link detected: yes

Notice the 1000baseT/full entry under Advertised link modes.  This
entry is present ONLY when the network is functioning.  It is absent
when the network is in its failed mode.  Does this support the idea
that negotiation is a likely source of the problem?

I like the idea of trying network restart.  However, I have yet to
have a change in state (bad->good or good->bad) without powering off
the computer.   It would be ideal if I could set up a little script to
performing network restart then ping the modem, then repeat.  That way
I could exercise the initiation much faster than booting.  If no
failures are created, then it is on to powering the desktop off.

It supports the idea that the card (sorry, controller on the
motherboard) or possible the kernel driver for the card is bad.

If you are seeing the list of negotiation rates drop in failed mode
then to be able to
check this while the system is up will require the network to be down
and at least the associated
network driver for the card to be rmmod to allow the driver
initialization to be done again.

To figure out the driver for the card look for eth0 in /etc/modprobe.conf

This is a nice place for a one off script to do the down up test loop.

Message-ID: <da77481d1001202037q6be95979p5c49dd576d8a203f@mail.gmail.com>

I have a Zope/Plone 2.5 web site running on Debian on a Linode virtual host.
It has grown over the last few years, and now I need to add some more disk
space. The site is for a school newspaper, so from August - June, students
add news articles and photos.

I was also looking at the output of top, and perhaps I need more RAM as
well? Top shows I have only 5 MB free out of 368 MB of total RAM, but I am
only using 9% of my swap, so perhaps I don't need more RAM. The site does
not seem slow.

I don't think you can tell much from this output because of the usage
of the disk cache. You would need to run a command like "ps fauxw" and
examine the memory usage of individual processes.

(A)  You always need more RAM.  No matter how much you have.
(B)  The big impact of not having enough RAM is that things slow down 
with swapping.  If your computer is fast enough for you, you don't need 
more RAM badly, yet.
(C)  But you always need more RAM.

Carlos is spot on!

The other question you should ask yourself is what happens if you run 
out of memory. In terms of general sys admin approach, usually at about 
85% consistent usage of any resource you start think about the need for 
more...

I concur.  Look at what is actually using memory on your system, try
to figure out why it needs so much memory, and then try to predict
what will happen if your web traffic or other services get 10x the
load.  Will your web/app server spawn a bunch more processes and cause
you to swap out heavily?

As aluded to by others, nowadays swap is almost useless, unless you're
interested in doing hibernation.  The gap between memory and hard
drive speed is so large that swapping on a server is almost like
running out of memory.  You never want to do it when it counts.

HTH,
tim

/etc/modprobe.conf does not exist.  The man page says to look in all
the files in /etc/modprobe.d  There are no eth0 entries in any of
those files.  modprobe -c | grep eth0 comes up empty.

I had previously posted this:

This tells me the driver name.  It is not clear to me what to do with

Run lsmod if the driver is built as a module it will show up and you
can remove it from the running system with rmmod $module_name (note,
it doesn't physically remove it, just until it's reloaded either by
you or by a reboot)

  It sounds like you may have a flaky kernel module for that ethernet
chip.  The command "modinfo forcedeth" will show you the module
version.  You can check if the motherboard or chipset manufacture has
a more recent module available.  You will probably need to install the
kernel source code and software build tools to compile the new module.

  I had a similar problem with the Intel e1000 driver for a couple
years.  The kernel module wouldn't work on my motherboard for some
reason.  I had a 3com PCI ethernet card in that chassis until Intel
provided some better code.

or an easier way to calculate the same metric, just use the command 'free':

             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       4052320    4025872      26448          0     219852    1131972
-/+ buffers/cache:    2674048    1378272

here you can see that though top would tell me i only have 26MB of 4GB
free, that i actually have a total of 1.3GB used for file cache and
buffers which would be reallocated for use by running processes before
swap began to be used for anything intensive.

oh, it looks like top gives you that info too--the buffers and cached
(though listed in the 'swap' row, it is about memory i think) numbers
are there too, it just doesn't do the math of giving you the final
math to get the "free" number.

from your numbers, it looks like you could safely swapoff -a and run
without swap (but not with much headroom).

a related question:  do you track memory usage over time?  if the
server's been running for long, memory leaks may have occured that are
eating memory needlessly--programs grabbed memory to do something and
forgot to deallocate it when finished using it.  and then did that a
few, or a few hundred, more times.  not quite apples to apples, but
i'm sure i'm not the only one who has to restart my browser weekly to
reclaim hundreds of megs of active-use memory (even with the same 25
tabs open).

I would give the command that was used in that post you linked a try
and see what happens, it can't hurt.

I would try:

ethtool -s eth0 speed 100 duplex full autoneg off

You can also try the suggestion of adding to rc.local since it seem so
to be a transient error that clears itself on reboot if I recall you
wrote correctly.

What kernel version are you using? It might be possible to grok the
mod version of the NIC module from knowing what kernel it was built
into.

I also run a virtual server, with 400M of RAM.  I was considering
Plone for some websites a couple of years back, and abandoned the
idea, because Zope and Plone are memory hogs.  There are tweaks for
apache and other processes to reduce memory a bit, at the expense of
performance.  But you probably should pay for more RAM (probably a
lot more) if you want to run Zope-based apps.

Running more swap in a virtual environment is Not A Good Idea.  You
are hammering all the other clients on the box, not just you.  My
hosting service discourages it.  If I want to do a distro upgrade
(a very rare occurence) I add some file-based swap, and slow down
my neighbors, but I never do that for day-to-day operation.

Get more RAM.  It may cost a hundred more dollars per year from a
virtual service (though the physical RAM only costs Linode $10 or
so), but it will make the machine run faster, and will accomodate
future footprint increases by Plone, which will always get bigger.

My fav part of the output from the "modinfo forcedeth" command has got 
to be

description:    Reverse Engineered nForce ethernet driver

HAHA!

At this point, IMHO I think the 2 best candidates are auto-negotiation and a flaky driver. Heck the flakey driver might even be the root cause of auto-neg probs.

The fact that when networking fails, you don't see "
  1000baseT/Full" as an advertised link mode tells me that something is b0rked at a lower level.

parents at R2D4:~$ uname -a
Linux R2D4 2.6.28-17-generic #58-Ubuntu SMP Tue Dec 1 21:27:25 UTC
2009 x86_64 GNU/Linux

This is also in the modinfo's first line.

Since the failures occur much less frequently than proper operation, a
trial such as "ethtool -s eth0 speed 100 duplex full autoneg off"
would take a long time to prove anything.

A string of commands to try when the network has failed at least gives
immediate feedback.  Is network restart a possible candidate?  Do I
need to rmmod as well?  If I remove the module, what puts it back? The
modprobe man page seems to have some errors in it, so I am reluctant
to experiment.  (BTW, my system has no such command as "network").

My bad for missing it in the modinfo output. If you run the command
perhaps the network won't fail, however it's something to keep in the
back of your mind if and when it does fail again. Network restart
would be a candidate. You can either use modprobe or insmod forcedeth
to re-insert the module or just reboot the system which seems to fix
the problem so it doesn't help troubleshooting it.

You will probably need to rmmod the driver.  The process of bringing
up the interface
will load the module (or at least should).

For the network, it would be:
sudo service networking stop
sudo service networking start

Why does the bottom of the page have PLUG web page have such an old

Also the Advanced Topics meeting place is currently wrong.

Can we get that corrected?

There are several, I personally prefer using the trinity rescue kit live CD, 
since it has common options selectable in the boot menu.  And a nice wrapper 
script for the different antivirus options.

I'm not sure if it was recorded or not. But, you can find everything that was 
covered on Linux HA last night at http://www.linux-ha.org/ including tutorials.

Also, I made a comment about how Heartbeat seems to only provide failover (HA) 
functionality and not load balancing. Ultramonkey uses the Linux-HA framework 
for monitoring the Linux-directors, which are hosts running LVS and doing the 
load balancing. http://www.ultramonkey.org/3/

Mike,
Looking at the script "networking" it seems that all it does, after
checking for network mounted stuff, is run ifdown -a --exclude=lo and
ifup -a --exclude=lo.  I have run ifdown and ifup (w/o the exclude)
when in the failed state with no effect.  Does the "exclude" add
anything of importance to my testing?

I thought hardbeat was superseded by pacemaker.

The other thing I find interesting is that all of these sites seem to
have stopped being updated
and/or still using things like RHEL3.

Last night's talk had a pound reverse proxy providing load balancing and 
Heartbeat/Pacemaker providing H/A failover of the pound service.

Of course a two node cluster with one node that wont boot up isn't really that 
interesting.

Aaron Burt has volunteered to work with Wil Cooley (who hosts the
site) to finish setting up the moinmoin wiki, and make the front
page of the wiki the front page of pdxlinux.org .  After that 
happens,  "we" can get that up to date if everybody pitches in
to clean up spam, keep meeting notices current, and add content
to the other pages.

When that happy day arrives, I hope you will be one of the "we".

In the interim, I hope we can have a fruitful discussion on the
list about how we would treat the wiki, what would be out of
bounds, etc.  Some are skeptical about the value of a wiki, and
whether it will turn into a dumping ground for off-topic church
or political announcements, or even semi-on-topic arguments like
distro or editor wars..  If we want the privilege of keeping the
site up to date, we should agree on how to treat the site and 
each other.

Another way to contribute, that will help when the time comes,
is to design a set of text captcha question/answer pairs to foil
spam robots.  Two examples:  my own moinmoin wikis ask questions
about generally known time and space questions, like "how many
seconds in an hour".  Michael Rassmussen's wiki asks "when is a
good time to ride a bicycle";  his right answer is an opinion
somewhat broader than mine.  Within that range is a set of
questions that will foil a non-context-parsing robot, but will
be answerable by most somewhat literate english speakers.

   Initially, at least, have a page where recruiters can post available jobs
and another page where un-/underemployed folks can post resumes, pleas for
work, etc.

Ha, I thought it did more than that! I don't think so as it's just 
excluding the loopback interface from ifup/ifdown. Sorry for leading you 
astray... :-/

My understanding is that with Heartbeat, OpenAIS, DRBD, etc you need a 
Cluster Resource Manager for the complete solution.

Heartbeat originally came w. a primitive resource manager but it could 
only manage 2 nodes.

Pacemaker works by utilizing the messaging and membership capabilities 
provided by your preferred cluster infrastructure (currently either 
OpenAIS or Heartbeat),

Don't jump to conclusions based upon a novice like me reading a
script!  There could be stuff in there that I missed.

It sounds like the consensus here is that to duplicate what happens to
the network during boot I would need to [remove the driver (rmmod),
restart the network( ifup?) , ping ], repeat 'till bored.  Is this
correct?

Yes, that seems the correct test to run.

I'm still trying to understand what causes the "1000baseT/Full" to show 
up or not show up for "Advertised link modes"/ 10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full.

My understanding is that during auto-neg each side advertises it's 
highest capability and the 2 link partners negotiate down to a common 
speed/duplex capability.

Also, auto-neg on the link is exchanged when:
1. Link is initially connected
2. Device at either end of the link is powered up
3. Device is reset or initialized
4. Renegotiation request is made

Which means the testing you've has forced auto-negotiation to reoccur. 
Which leads me to believe that it's not strictly a auto-neg problem.

I think we really need to understand the missing Gigabit link mode 
advertisement. Why would the NIC not advertise it sometimes...?

I am glad you have focused on this.  Since it is the only thing I have
found which is consistently different between failed and working
modes, it deserves some scrutiny.  I think it is interesting that the
unused capability (1000baseT) is what is missing when in the failed
mode.  Does it mean that the negotiation failed at that point?  Is
there any way to snoop on the negotiation process?  I have wireshark,
but am not familiar with running it.

Thanks for you interest.

Hello!

I am wondering if anyone is thinking about the repercussions about the Supreme 
Court Decision today. I am wondering if it would be a good thing to move all 
my web content offshore.

Sorry if this is off topic, I just thought I would put this out there to see 
what happens.

Argh, I'm baffled by this auto-neg behavior because why does it only 
happy once in blue moon and only upon booting. So yeah, you could use 
tcpdump and filter on any traffic for that eth interface. But I suspect 
by the time you get it setup the problem will have already occurred.

What might be a simpler and possibly more effective is to use ethtool to 
restart auto-neg and tail the log file and capture the auto-neg mssgs. 
See link below for how-to. Then when the networking fails, cat the log 
file and grep for any mssgs for that eth interface.

What happens is that those of us who are too geeky to watch what passes
for news broadcasts have no idea what you are talking about and have to
respond to find out.

That seems straight-forward enough.   I will attempt to put it in a
script to allow me to do the test repeatedly 'till I see a failure or
become convinced it is not going to fail.  I am not too hopeful--the
only times the fail/working state has changed have involved removing
power from the computer (sw. on back).

Before you move your content offshore, move this thread to plug-talk.

Why would there be a need to move offshore?
Political speech is now in the market to the highest bidder, no restrictions
remain.

But what if the highest bidder disapproves of what you have to say? What if
they use their influence to shut you down?

Heck, they'd probably never notice me, but I don't like that they are being
given more rights. Corporations are not people, and should not pretend to
be.

One should not fall for the pretense that corporations are "people" and 
thus have rights (and also no liability, eh?) ... think of corporations 
as a kind of "shell company" - a ruse to shield specific people.  
Originally it was to protect the wealth and property of the individual 
investors from any liability incurred by the corporation.  But of course 
with the help of lawyers and "for hire" politicians and judges and 
assorted thugs, over time those privileges have expanded, but not the 
liabilities, duties, or responsibilities.  What is really at issue is 
the money vote - more money, more vote - and corporations are the 
current popular shell to hide behind when voting for anything 
particularly nasty.  Corporations don't do anything - the people behind 
them do.

Question: If you just use a computer for email, web, etc but don't know 
much about them or anything about Linux how would you know about why you 
should give Linux a try or where you could go to get free help/support 
from some good, friendly, Linux loving folks?

Backstory: I was helping a friend w. fire wood, got a phone call, and 
then asked here if I could jump on the web w. her computer. Ugh! I don't 
know recall which version of Win-duhs but when I tried to open up a new 
IE session, the computer threw-up all over itself. I spent about 10 mins 
or so just trying to get to my gmail. I said to her, how the heck do you 
use this thing? I told her she should let me install Linux on it. And 
she just looked at me w. a blank stare. At the moment I wish I had a 
LiveCD or my laptop to show her the brave new world of Linux.

So I guess what I'm driving at is how do we get the word out to the avg 
computer user? If you don't know someone who runs Linux or aren't 
involved w. Free Geek how would find out about it? I can't help but feel 
like if we could expand the Linux user base here that only good things 
we come out of it for everyone...

How to get the word out about Linux is a good question. I have done it on my
own. In the past year I have installed Linux Mint on around 20 computers for
people who knew very little about computers at all. They have all be very
happy using Mint. I use other distros, but I've found that Mint has been the
most trouble-free version. The more people I get using Linux, the more they
tell their friends.

It would be nice if some large companies could do some advertizing of Linux
and hopefully that will come eventually.

You can always reach me at: http://linuxpcs.net

Thanks,
Dave

   Those interested in advocacy should consider forming a SIG. There are
probably community events where a table could be set up with working
desktop/laptop/netbook displays that can be used to demo linux. A stack of
bootable CDs/DVDs could be made available, too.

   City and county Web sites might list upcoming events where a table could
be set up at no cost.

That's great! Now the disclaimer: I'm about to my crazy hat on.

The crazy thought that is running through my head is to put on a 24hr 
PLUG Linux-athon. Where people come and they donate a couple cans of 
food or something for the Oregon Food Bank and in exchange we free them 
from the chains of M$.

Why would a Supreme Court decision on political speech lead one to
moving web content offshore? AFAIK, no prohibitions were added/created
by the decision.

If the answer is political, then perhaps this topic does belong on
plug-talk. 

Thanks,

i know this question periodically shows up - but usually it is not when

anyways - need a general purpose laptop with the usual stuff on it - 
lots memory, cd/dvd/blu-ray, wireless, 500gb +/- hdd, etc.  looking for 
recommendations.  i'll probably put ubuntu on it unless there is a

Frank,

   Depending on what you need to run on the box the Toshiba Satellite
L455-S5975 (that model number just rolls of the tongue, doesn't it?) might
suit you.

   It has a Celeron 900 CPU (the -...76 model has an AMD processor), 2G RAM,
250M hard drive, wireless, cd/dvd drive, a 15.6" wide screen and a low
price. We paid $329 at Best Buy; it was on sale that day (or week) and might
be again.

   It is somewhat-happily running Xubuntu-9.10. I write 'somewhat' because,
unlike the two previous portables whose wifi came from the PCMCIA card and
had no difficulties communicating from the back to the front of the house,
this box does not consistently have a sufficiently strong radio signal. No
one knows why.

   Regardless, it's a good unit for my wife's needs and we just put up with
the changing signal strength from the den in the back of the house.

I've owned HP, Dell, Toshiba, and IBM/Lenovo laptops. My personal 
experience has been that the Thinkpad line of laptops is a far superior 
product in terms of build quality, functionality, reliability, and 
upgradeability. The T60 I'm using/abusing now I bought refurbished 3 yrs 
ago...

Although you certainly could support the corporate big box chain stores, 
but why not check out your *local* computer shop.

Pacific Solutions has 2 Lenovo latops for <$700

The show stopper for me every time I try and get friends and family on Linux
are the all in one printer-scanner-copier-free shoulder massage officejets
that they all have.  I know I can get these things working in Linux but
trying to explain how to do all this with Linux to someone who's computer
experience is comprised of mindless pointing and clicking.......priceless.

What does "lots of memory" mean? You're being cheap if you want all that 
for $700. I know you can go out and buy it, but the hardware is crap and 
it's going to break. Here's what you're going to get that you didn't ask 
for for that price. A horrible screen, and a weak processor. Why do you 
want a BluRay drive if the screen doesn't have the pixels? Also, while 
you could, I doubt the machine will have virtualization available in the 
BIOS.

dell.com/ubuntu is a good place to start. Or newegg where you can dial 
in the requirements and it presents you with a list which you could use 
to shop locally if you want.

I would save for a couple months more. The Dell Latitudes are great 
machines. You could try the Dell Outlet. I got my E6500 there and saved 
$700. 3 year warranty is standard too. You're going to have to come down 
a bit on the hard drive and BD drive to get the price you're wanting though.

It's funny how this happens. I've had many transactions w. then and 
never a bad one... As for price. It's a personal preference I suppose. 
But I will always and gladly pay more to support local bizs and keep out 
the corp one in every town America big box chain bizs.

If big companies are changing the way they do biz because of the bad 
press they get on Twitter, blogs, Facebook, etc. I can't see why telling 
your story when you have a bad customer experience with a local biz 
would be any different.

please excuse the lower case - i am temporarily without the use of my 
right hand  :(

thanks to all who responded . . .

some clarifications:

lots of memory means 2gb for a 32 bit os - 4gb for 64 bit
don't particularly "need" blu-ray but many of today's drives include it
not doing cfd or other big math but do want good performance
1600 x 900 graphics is cool - i have a 56" dlp tv so watching vids on 
computer = nop
hdd size - more = better

I'll just mention my recent Just-Works anecdote regarding printing.  I
have set up an Ubuntu install for my computer-averse 70 yo mother.
Mostly it's been sitting unused.  She lives across town.  She needs a
document printed.  I haven't set up printing on the thing.  Printer
has been sitting unused, unpowered for 6 months, minimum.  I plug it
in to the USB port and power, start up Open Office, load the document,
click the print icon, pause ... whir-whir, printed document comes
out.  No muss, no fuss.  I was kind of impressed.

I'll be honest, I would never have expected it to just work that 
painlessly. I was just researching if I could connect my Nokia phone to 
my Linux box to get photos/files off of it. Of course there's no Nokia 
suite for Linux. But a few people said Linux just sees it as a mass 
storage device and you interact it with link any other. Although, I'm a 
bit skeptical about the getting it connected via Bluetooth.

I think there's still this notion that if you want to use Linux as your 
daily computer you'll waste your life away tinkering w. it to get it to 
work w. common peripherals.

Which is ironic, because Linux supports a wide variety and large number 
of devices. So, I think there's an intersection between the distro & 
hardware that you're using that sometimes can end up in a fatal head-on 
collision. And this is what sticks in our minds, the horror stories, not 
the success stories, and makes skeptics and cynics out of the best of us.

As opposed to the Microsoft world, where smaller failures more often are
commonplace and expected, so they don't stick out particularly over the
benefits.

Is it still true that most people who don't spend much time thinking
about what OS they use mostly default to either: 1) what they use at
work, or 2) what seems like a reasonably priced box for their needs at
the nearest big box store / big online retailer like Amazon?

That was my reality, back when I bought my first computer, but back
then schools weren't using computers, students didn't have laptops,
and people weren't raised with the ubiquity of information and
electronics that exist today.  I haven't kept up with how younger
generations learn / think about these things.

I had a brief chat about Linux with a fellow at the BTA a few weeks
ago.  He was telling me about how the BTA was updating its database
system because what they had was hopelessly outdated.  The BTA (whose
office is filled with computers running Windows) contracted with a
Portland software consultant firm that, according to this fellow, is
run by a bunch of former Microsoft employees.  He said this firm has
done similiar work for a number of other similarly sized non-profits
(one he mentioned is Friends of Trees, I can't remember the other
ones).  I told him I use Linux at home.  He wondered if that posed any

those businesses get exposure and experience and realize Linux can
work for them as well as (or better than) Windows or OS X.  (Or, no

I find it works better to talk about how to solve the end user's problems with 
open source than advocate for Linux.  Ultimately most places tend to care less 
what OS they run than about getting their task done with the least hassle.

I think we'd be more effective if we focus on helping them use computers to do 
their work better instead of focusing on the open source tools we'd used to 
actually accomplish it.

Keep an eye on the office stores like staples, every month or so they clearance 
out some of their older laptops for 30-50% off their original price.  

I picked up my current laptop that way for $329, it retailed the week before 
for $725.

This is the pest control model. You put the poison out to the worker's 
(MS Win & Office) and then they take it back to the nest/home and infect 
family, friends and neighbors with it.

There are a plethora of reasons why some companies and orgs drop M$ for 
Linux / FOSS and there are just as many why they don't. I'm surprised 
every time there's some headline about a company or municipality 
switching to Linux and then after I read the article I'm dumbfounded why 
other's don't.

I think Linux / FOSS is going to work the other way around. I just found 
out from an ex-colleague that a large hospital I worked switched from 
the Blackberry to the iPhone because so many people had them and were 
using them at work that IT eventually caved in and supported them.

A lot of consumer tech is using non-M$ software. This is why I think 
it's so important to work from the outside/in or bottom/up. Besides, 
Linux / FOSS is for the people by the people!

Oh, good idea.  I was thinking advertising, but that boiled down to a few
posters on lamp posts, or finding a rich guy who likes Linux.

Having a table at such shows would be good, at least until your batteries
ran out.

I have to disagree with this. For one, if this was true I think we'd see a greater
mix of M$ and non-M$ prods at companies. Instead there's the company standard 
and big $ IT contracts.

Also, many IT people are heavily invested in terms of time and money in learning
the MS way, getting certs, jobs, promotions. If you rose to Manager, Director, or
VP of IT on the back of the M$ horse are you really going to have any interest 
in Linux / FOSS?

I just picked up a Dell Vostro 1520, and I like it a lot. I had to install
Debian from disks as the network install did not work. But other than that,
and some sound issues with skype, it works well. Look for it in the Dell
Small Business site.

I have had good luck with Sony Vaio laptops. Big box objections aside,
here's a quick check of your price range at Best Buy's Sony offerings.
A quick glance looks like they meet most of your needs.

So what kind of firewalls are those M$ companies putting in?  Most of the time 
it's a Linux system pre-configured to act as a firewall.  The same is true for 
wifi routers, vpn servers, virtualization servers, vpn gateways, heck even some 
of the printers are actually Linux servers.

I've been in some shops that tell me they don't run Linux and nearly half of 
the rack mount equipment in their computer room runs Linux and they don't even 
realize it.

The way all that Linux equipment ends up there is because it solves the 
customer's problem and they don't have to be concerned about what OS the thing 
runs, just that it works for it's intended task.

  I recently got a deal on a inspirion 14" from Dell outlet for $400. It 
was a return, but in like new shape and works great.

Okay, so some clarification is in order I think. With the exception of 
print servers I've never seen any of those appliances/devices powered by 
M$ software. Pretty much any network oriented appliance runs Linux/Unix 
but it's under the covers. It doesn't say "Linux inside". It says Cisco, 
Juniper, Checkpoint. And you don't have to actually know *nix to work on 
them.

I'm talking about in the server room and on the desktop. I'm talking 
about people knowing which version of Linux is running on all their 
computer systems. Why is is that computer stuff has Intel, MS, ATI, and 
other logos all over it but you rarely see a Tux, Beastie, or GNU mascot 
logo?

In most cases you have to actually get to the command line to find out 
which *nix is running the thing.

Although other denizens of this list have offered to hurl on my shoes for
mentioning Acer, System 76 will sell you a nice Acer whitebox laptop with
Ubuntu already loaded.  The one I got has lasted through three-four years
of moderately heavy use (it's my "get email when I'm upstairs" machine, as
well as my traveling machine).

Of course, my previous laptop -- a Dell -- has lasted long enough that
it's now fit only for Xbuntu, and is built well enough that at twice the
age it looks less shabby than the System 76 one...

You get the laptop, you get the system already loaded, and if it needs it
you get a special driver set from System 76 to make all the questionable
hardware bits play nice with Ubuntu.

You _don't_ get Windows of any sort, so if you need something with Windows
that you can dual-boot or virtualize you're pretty much out of luck.

I'm saying get the Linux in solving their problems, then point the differences 
between them once they've used it for a while.

Instead of coming in and trying to get them to change to Linux.  Get Linux in 
running the core of their infrastructure, then educate them.  Once they rely 
on Linux, it's not something new they don't understand anymore.  

Think splitting a log.  The appliance is the wedge, once the wedge is started 
the education is the sledgehammer that opens up the environment.  Without the 
wedge you're just pounding on the log with a sledgehammer which is a lot less 
effective.

These days, as long as you are using a reasonably recent
desktop-oriented distro your bluetooth stuff should "just work." That
is, you do have to set it up, but the process is a GUI that is dead
simple.

I have a bluetooth phone and it automatically connects as soon as I turn
the phone into discovery mode. Nautilus even pops up a browser window.
And the JPGs on the phone appear with a thumbnail icon in the browser
window. The phone also has a USB port, which works equally well, but
it's faster to use bluetooth than to get up, walk across the room, and
root around for a USB cable with the right connectors.

Whenever I am pitching Linux I am always careful to point out that
Windows gives you more options than the MacOS, and Linux way more than
Windows, but you have to pay a price in terms of time spent fiddling.

I have also discovered that it's usually a hard sell. I have had much
better luck by getting them to install OOo on their Windows or Mac
computer first. It's a baby step that gets them thinking about the
benefits of FOSS.

I am thinking of the possibility of holding free classes on OOo at
someplace like PCC where it will get advertised in their catalog. I
assume PCC has a computer-equipped classroom available for such things.

Blackberry Storms show up as USB mass storage after the SW update last November.
It's a major win.  Easy to populate with custom ring tones, wall papers, icons...

I have an Acer DLP projector that does a very nice job with high 
definition video.

I had it ceiling mounted in my last house, and it was connected up to my 
MythTV system.

8 feet wide x 4.5 feet tall - Crystal Clear (except up when standing too 
close to the screen - darn pixels).

It felt just like being at the movie theater, and I had some awesome 
Saturday College Football watch parties!

Being able to create your own instant replays was pretty neat when there 
was an argument about the runner going out of bounds, or getting stopped 
short of the goal line.

Hey, Jim, just out of curiosity, would you mind telling me briefly  
about the costs and configuration for your MythTV projection system?

Josh,

Here ya go: (I really got to rambling here, sorry)

Computer: ~$500-600 total at the time (I'm cheap, and wait until things 
come down in price)
  Cheapo full-size media center case - Actually looks pretty good, I 
forget where I got it.
  AMD 4000+ Dual Core processor / MainBoard combo - I don't remember the 
model
  2 GB Ram
  NVidia 6200 video card w/256MB Ram - Heatsink only, no cooling fan. 
DVI out (the cable is DVI on one end, and HDMI on the other) I use the 
proprietary driver for it.
  2- Internal 500GB sata hardisks
  1- External 500GB USB 2.0 drive
  DVD-RW (I don't remember if it is dual-layer, or single - I don't use 
it much)
  10/100/1000 Integrated Ethernet
  AC97 integrated sound (I didn't bother figuring out the audio stuff, 
stereo is fine for me, even though I think I'm supposed to be able to do 
5.1 channels)
  2- Avermedia A180 HD Video Capture cards (as long as the channels are 
on the same multiplex, I can record multiple channels on each)
  1- Hauppauge PVR-150 Analog capture card w/remote (I'm actually only 
using this for the remote control capability, but I can hook it up to a 
VCR with a coax cable, or s-video, and archive old media with it if I 
need to.)
  Several low-noise fans, and a big heat sink on the CPU - Pretty quiet 
system, no cooling issues. Makes my regular workstation sound like a 
garbage disposal....

Projector ~$550 at the time
  The projector is currently in storage, but it is an ACER PH530. (The 
replacement bulbs are about $250 - Not cheap, but they last for 2-3000 
hours of use.)

Old fashioned wall mount/roll-up AV Screen ~$100 (The little black 
string to tie to the handle was free ;) )

Operating System: $0
  MythBuntu 9.10 64-bit (MythTV 0.22-fixes) (I started out on MythBuntu 
7.04... I think.)

Configuration:
  The learning curve was (and still is) pretty steep for me. Mostly 
because I am not an TV/AV guy, the terminology is Greek to me, and I'm 
still a relative NOOB in GNU/Linux. However, I have set it up several 
different times, mostly due to Noob Linux user errors, and it isn't so 
bad, anymore.

My thoughts on it:

Major Benefits:

Automatic commercial skip!
Record up to 4 shows at once (more may be possible, but I haven't tried 
to really push the hardware to see if it can do it.)
Pause live tv
Rewind live tv
Play/Record DVDs
Video Archive/player
Music Archive/player
Automatic Martini Mixer (Don't I wish)
Endless possibilities actually.

I get HD Programming from a standard antenna, or by plugging into the 
cable outlet. I prefer to use the cable outlet, because I get terrible 
broadcast reception here.

Using the cable outlet, any of the channels that are encrypted won't 
come in because there is no cablecard on the tuners to unscramble them. 
However, I still get the major channels, Discovery, WGN, and Public 
Access channels on the cable connection. Basically, these are the ones 
that the cable company are required to broadcast in clear qam.

I could use the IR blaster that came with my hauppage card to control 
channel changing on the cable box, and record all the cable channels I 
get, but I could only record standard definition off of that, so I don't 
bother.

I can record up to four shows at a time - possibly more, but I am 
limited to only two at a time if the shows I want to record do not share 
multiplex ID's.

The MythBuntu site (www.mythbuntu.org) has some great documentation and 
setup guides.  The MythTV-Users mailing list, and mailing list archive 
are invaluable for troubleshooting various issues with either config, or 
hardware gotchas.

The only hardware gotcha on my computer system was a combination of 
being new to Linux, and not knowing that my HD capture cards needed an 
extra firmware driver to be downloaded (it is not in the linux 
distribution), and put into the /lib/firmware directory.

I have to say, this setup makes for some great TV/Movie watching, now if 
they would just come up with something worth watching ;)

Message-ID: <98afdbcd1001231037l52e2f834l6b0662713e7809bb@mail.gmail.com>

I've been trying to install Linux Mint 8 on a friends Dell Dimension 8400
desktop. It has a 250gb hdd. as sata 0 and the new 320gb hdd is set at sata
1. The BIOS sees both hdds but the Mint installer only sees the first 250gb
hdd. Someone told me to turn off the raid setting but there is not way to
turn it off in the BIOS. The Mint Forum told me to run on the live CD:

$ sudo apt-get remove dmraid

sounded like a good idea, but after running it and logging back in to the
live CD nothing happened. The installer will only see the first 250gb hdd.

Any other ideas?

That was, more or less, my entry into using Linux.  There's no
particular reason I needed to use Linux and still isn't.  But over
time, I started using more and more FOSS, for important and trivial
functions, and found it worked well, usually better than the
commercial or free/share-ware I had used previously.  So I got into
the habit of seeking out FOSS options deliberately, and went so far as
to purge all non-MS closed-source apps from my Windows system.  From
there, deciding I may as well try an open-source OS was a relatively
small (since most apps I was using by that point were cross-platform*)
and logical step.

But seriously, try booting with Knoppix or Finnix. If either of these
can see the HDD, then Mint is the problem. But if they cannot, then
it's a BIOS-level issue.

  Ethernet auto-negotiation occurs down at the physical level.  It
involves sets of "link pulses" and "fast link pulses" that are
exchanged between the partners to advertise and negotiate the link
parameters.  You need a digital storage oscilloscope to monitor the
negotiation.

Autonegotiation
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonegotiation

  It's essentially magic.  The Ethernet PHY chip handles the link and
reports the results to the higher layers.  You can't get involved from
the keyboard.

  The newer chipsets end up doing a lot of renegotiation.  The power
saving modes in the new motherboards will down speed the link to
10Full when the system goes into sleep or hibernation modes.  Laptops
are especially aggressive about down speeding to help save power.
They renegotiates back to higher speeds when system activity wakes the
machine back up.

  Any Gig ethernet port will probably also contain some power saving
modes.  You need to visually monitor the link LEDs in the back of the
card to figure out what mode your eth phy is running in.  The ethtool
command will not tell you what is really happening.

  You need to remember that some link modes will result in a Duplex
Mismatch.  You can create link problems by manually configuring an
invalid configuration.

I will give that a try. Somebody in the Mint forum told me to run Mint 7
instead. I sounds like there's a bug in the installer. I also tried Ubuntu
and it could not see the drive either. I really think its a BIOS issue, and
there's no option to turn off raid, which I think is causing the problem.

I like the way you think sir ;-)

More on topic - Can you run something like fdisk or cfdisk and see if
it sees the drive?

Hello,

Did you try looking under every "nook and cranny" in the BIOS?  In some
cases, options for this kind of thing might not be in a place that is
necessarily obvious.  It could be under some option for the hard drives, to
use them in legacy IDE mode, SATA mode, or RAID mode, or something along
those lines.

Also agree with trying another distro live CD, see if they can see the 2nd
drive.

You might also want to try Ultimate Boot CD, and run a hd diagnostic on the
2nd drive.

Or a lot of times the RAID utility isn't accessed via the normal BIOS
utility, but rather in another utility of its own. It might come up
briefly as an option (perhaps by hitting CTRL-H) after the BIOS post.

Set the SATA mode to not be auto-RAID. It's just below the SATA/PATA 
port option in the BIOS.

I just looked at the owners manual pdf file from the above link, and I 
think this is what you might need to do:

Disable RAID-Enabled Mode
1   Turn on (or restart) your computer.
2   When the blue DELLTM logo appears, press <F2> immediately.
3   Enter system setup.
4   Use the up- and down-arrow keys to highlight Drives, and press <Enter>.
5   Use the up- and down-arrow keys to highlight Drive Controller, and 
press <Enter>.
6   Use the left- and right-arrow keys to highlight Drive Controller 
RAID Autodetect/AHCI, (or possibly RAID Autodetect/ATA), press <Enter>, 
and then press <Esc>.
7   Use the left- and right-arrow keys to highlight Save/Exit, and press 
<Enter> to exit system setup and resume the boot process.

If not the owners manual pdf that I linked should help.

Good luck!

Thanks for all the information.  You have saved me from a fruitless
bunch of tests.  I do not claim to have gotten my head around all the
stuff in those links, but I have the impression that if the NIC is
misbehaving during the autonegotiation process I have no reasonable
way to find that out.

The connection has not had a failure for some days now (many shutdowns
and reboots, but no interruption of power to the modem or the
computer), even though renegotiation is likely happening often.  Also,
when failure occurs the only thing which appears to fix it is to shut
down and power down the computer.  I conclude from this that most
likely the NIC occasionally gets into a bad state during power-up.

Do you see this as an accurate assessment?

I think we did veer a bit of course. But the auto-net theory & testing 
was to figure out if it's a physical problem with the hw nic or if it's 
a software (driver, tcp/ip stack, OS) level issue.

We're still left w. the fact that thus far the only diff you've noticed 
between a working and non-working network connection is the presence or 
non-presence of the "1000baseT" advertised mode.

So, the question still remains why does everything appear to work: link 
lights, ip addr, mac addr, except you can't ping the modem/router and 
the "100baseT" is missing from the advertised mode in ethtool?

One of the things the 'MII-Tool' shows which 'ethtool' doesn't is "link 
partner" information

root at mc-goose:~# mii-tool -v eth0
link partner: 1000baseT-HD 1000baseT-FD 100baseTx-FD 100baseTx-HD 
10baseT-FD 10baseT-HD flow-control

This could be useful info.

The fact that thus far the problem only happens or is resolved upon 
boot/power hints strongly at either intermittent physical  or driver 
problem that we may never determine.

We've pretty well flogged this horse. If this were my setup, and if the 
modem/router only supported 10/100, I would get an Intel or 3com 10/100 
NIC and disable the on-board. I think at that point chances would be 
greatly in your favor that you'd never see this problem again...

I just want to make sure of something: you made a change in the
installed packages while running the live cd, rebooted the computer,
started up the live cd again, and noticed that there was no change? If
you didn't do something like chroot into the installed system, then
rebooting the live cd restores all settings and packages to the
original state.

Sorry I can't help with anything more constructive, but I just wanted
to clear that up.

Robert

I will try switching the cables and see if the 320gb is detected. If the
320gb is not detected in the sata 0 postion, maybe its a bad drive? I plan
to go back and try tomorrow. Thanks.

Message-ID: <da77481d1001241342m7ba97615i43820128fcad231f@mail.gmail.com>

I have two ide drives in one machine - drive 1 is a Windows drive and drive
2 is a Linux drive. Using grub, I can boot into either windows or debian. I
want to remove the windows drive and replace it with a larger, blank drive
for backup storage. I have a feeling if I just remove the first drive and
put the new one there, the machine will not boot, since the MBR is probably
on the first drive (it came with the machine, and I just added the second
drive for Linux). My questions:

1. How do I change grub on the Linux drive (hdb) to say "the windows drive
is dead, boot here instead, long live linux"?

2. Do I move the second drive to the first ide port, or leave it as the
second ide drive and put the new drive in the fist ide port?

Thanks!

Mark

I doubt it's a bad drive but you might turn up something interesting
if Mint decides to recognize it as the first drive and/or not see the
250GB drive as the second.

If it doesn't recognize it then at least the miscommunication between
the BIOS and Mint is consistent.

I have a GigE NIC on my T60 and was curious what ethtool would report 
when I connected it up to to  a Linksys WRT56G router.

Ethtool did report "link partner" info, which was interesting because my 
NIC was advertising auto-neg but the Linksys is not.

Here are some links discussing reinstalling grub. 
The 1st disk begins with 0 zero, not one.

 So IDE Disk 1 partition 1 is hd0,0
    IDE disk 2 partition 3 is hd1,2

I hope to try again tomorrow or Tuesday. I may also bring one of my desktops
over to their house and plug the new hdd into my desktop and see of Mint
will see it there. If it does, then I know that it's a hardware/bios problem
on their computer.

Opportunity knocks?  Maybe.  Assuming you are not going to do anything 
with the MS drive anyway ...
    the MB has primary and secondary IDE connectors, and each will 
handle a master and a slave (2) drives - that makes 4 (not counting 
floppy because that is a different connector)
    do you have space on that arrangement for another IDE drive?
... if so ...
    add the drive there and you're in.
... if no ...
    add an extra IDE connector or two (via a pci card)
    add the drive there and you're in.
... in either case, your mess factor is reduced and you can still boot 
MS - or is that something you wanted to ditch anyway?  If so ...
    add the new drive as in one of the above
    format the MS drive to give yourself even more extra Linux space
Hope that helps

an attempt has been made to access the shell service remotely on tcp

Why spend the money? I don't need the tiny (40GB) Widows drive on a Linux
backup server. It is old, slow, and small.

The 40 GBs are not enough for backups, so I have a new ide drive (250 GB)
for backups.

Can you post some of your .pinerc settings:

   smtp-server
   inbox-path
   incoming-folders
   folder-collections
   news-collections

My hunch is that your configuration wants direct file access to your 
inbox and/or folders (as opposed to, say, IMAP access to them) and 
pine is trying to launch a remote session to allow it.

Also -- are you still running Pine or have you switched to Alpine? The 
latter is the currently supported version -- and it has UTF-8 support 
so you can read your spam in the original Russian! :-)

What Linux distro are you using?  Some more recent releases (eg Ubuntu
Karmic) use grub2, a new rewrite of grub, that uses a different device
numbering scheme and has a different menu.lst format (called grub.conf in
grub2).

That said, the simplest approach is to install the new drive as the first
drive (replacing the Wx drive), and do a fresh minimal installation of Linux
on the new drive.  The installation process should find all of usable OS
installations and set up grub on the new drive accordingly.  The drawback
here is that a default installation will use all of the new drive for one
linux partition and one swap partition, so you would need to do some manual
partitioning on the new drive either before or during the installation.

There are more complicated solutions that require more detailed control of
the grub install process (as mentioned in earlier responses), which would
probably be a good exercise for you in any case.  Simply modifying the grub
info on the existing Linux drive will not work once the Wx drive with the
active MBR is removed, whether the Linux drive becomes the first or remains
the second drive.

Tony,

Thanks. After all my efforts to "fix grub", then move disks around failed. I
finally had to resort to booting with Knoppix and doing a grub-install on
the drive with the existing Linux distro which moved from hd1 to hd0. Should
have done that in the beginning....switch the drives, run a Knoppix,
grub-install, and be done with it. I am running Debian testing, and have
grub 0.97 installed.

For future reference, take a look at the Super Grub Live CD, for all of your
bootloader installation/repair issues.  The interface is not the most user
friendly (at least when I last used it), but I found it extremely useful.

  Things are much more complex than they appear.  Motherboards have
brains now.  The state of the ethernet negotiation isn't tied to the
front panel power button and the ifconfig command any longer.  Newer
motherboards have advanced power and management features like "Green
PC", ACPI, and IPMI.  These motherboards have systems running beneath
your level that have their own agenda.  Your ability to interact with
these systems is limited.

  You really don't control the motherboard any longer.  A
micro-controller called a Management Engine (ME) controls the system
power and PCI/PCIe bus.  The MEs have a tendency to do their own
thing.  They will down speed and/or renegotiate the link whenever
their programming says to.  It ain't easy being a Green PC.

  The ME actually talks directly to the NIC.  The PCIe 2.1 standard
(and above) include a serial link from the ME into the PCIe cards.
The older standards used an external serial cable.  The ME *controls*
your NIC.  It can do all kinds of interesting things, like IPMI and
LOM.  The *only* way for a user to determine the state of the NIC is
to monitor the LEDs.

  You may be able to turn off most of the ME by fiddling with the BIOS
and turning off ACPI support in the kernel.  You can tell if ACPI is
running by trying to put the OS into Sleep (S3) or Hibernate (S4).
You OS cannot go to S3/S4 unless ACPI and the ME is enabled  Turning
off ME (not really... psyc!) may cut down on some of the link problems
you're seeing.  It will also disable many of the "Green PC" features
of your system.

> Do you see this as an accurate assessment?

Pretty much...  Your available choices are:

1) Deal with it... You many have to "ifconfig up" your eth port from
time to time. :-)

2) Nail your NIC and switch port to 1000-Full.  This will only works
on a managed switch.  Only nailing one side can result in a
duplex-mismatch.

3) Install a different NIC.  I like the Intel cards.  Make sure to
replace the distro's in-box driver.  The latest and greatest Intel
Linux drivers up on Sourceforge are pretty good.

4) Open up an issue with your NIC manufacture.  They may be willing to
troubleshoot the problem and provide a fixed driver.  This would be
good for the Linux community.  Somebody has to be willing to feel the
pain so we can all reap the benefits. :-)

Once again I thank you for the information.  I have been thinking that
the thing which changes from one power-on--boot to the next is the
time from when the juice is connected to the desktop to when I press
the front panel button.  The stuff about the ME may fit in with this.
I can explore this when I feel not having a connection will not be too
painful.

With regard to your steps above.  1) I have tried ifdown/ifup to no
avail.  I have not tried ifconfig up.  When I break the network I will
try it.  2) my modem does not support 1000, and I have no switch. 3) A
new card is on my list.  4) I plan to do that, but the thought of
dealing with ASUS (the MB mfg.) makes me think of a tar pit.

Thanks.

the option you want to change is the rsh-open-timeout.  set it to 0 and it 
should stop trying rsh.

  Put a Mark 1 Eyeball on the NIC LEDs the next time you have an
error.  I suspect your LEDs will show 10-Full.  That would be an
indication that the ME went into a power saving mode and then failed
to renegotiate after waking up.

  The latest distros use a Network Manger to control the NICs.  This
is a response to the wide use of laptops and wireless connections.
The Network Manager is suppose to auto-magically switch to the correct
link as you move your laptop around.

  The ifup and ifdown scripts in /etc/networks may no longer exist.
The "ifconfig eth0 up/down" command should still work.  If not, go
into the sys-config-network GUI and unselect the Network Manager
control.

  YMMV  Redhat, Ubuntu, and Debian all do the network control things a
little different.  I like to open a second console with "tail -f
/var/log/messages" running so I can watch what's going on.

  You may be able to nail the modem to 100-Full if it has a management
interface.  Set both sides to 100-Full.  The ethernet link will come
up without negotiation, Problem solved!

  A cheap switch in the middle may also solve your problem.  The
ethernet PHY in the switch will probably be a different type than the
one in the modem.  Your system would be negotiating with a different
link partner, which may not have experience the error.

When the grub menu comes up, hit escape to stop it from booting.

>From here you can install a grub boot block on the second drive:

Hit 'C' to enter command mode, then enter the following 2 commands
(assuming the linux /boot partition is the first partition on the second
disk). 

root (hd1,0)
setup (hd1)

That would probably be all that's needed, if your Linux installation is
using UUID or LABELS to find the various partitions.  Otherwise you'll
need to change the fstab before you remove the first disk.

Subject: [PLUG] Faxing -- Solid Progress
Message-ID: <4B5F17F6.1000308@wescottdesign.com>

Thanks to advice here, and someone with a surplus modem who generously 
gave it up to me* I am now faxing.  Once I had a modem that Ubuntu could 
actually talk to the process was fairly easy and direct.  There was some 
comment in the set up lists about my modem and "bit reversing" which 
motivated me to send a test fax to my brother's shop -- but it worked, 
so all is well.

You may hear from me again on this score -- I'd like to be able to set 
things up so that there's a fax server that we can all use as a regular 
old printer, but (a) I don't know how well Ubuntu supports faxing across 
the network, and (b) it'd mostly be to support my wife's Windows Vista 
machine, which can only see my Ubuntu machine off and on.  So I may do 
this, or I may just make her come downstairs to my machine when she 
wants to fax something.

* This is a skill I really ought to learn -- I'm so much of a pack rat 
that I avoid garage sales because I snap up _other_ people's junk to 
jealously guard until the end of my days.

Ha, just another marketing dog & pony show! They really aren't
doing much for Linux/FOSS community or for the *Open* hw consumer.
It almost makes you wonder if it's funded by M$....?

  I don't know if I'd go that far.  It's easy for Apple, HP, and Dell
to get volume discounts from their suppliers.  Hell, their suppliers
trip over each other trying to give volume discounts.  It's harder to
get a volume discounts when you're only selling tens or hundreds of an
item.  Open Hardware has to start somewhere.  I'm glad these guys are
putting themselves out there.  Good on them...

  I don't see the BIOS thing being much of an issue.  It would be easy
to swap in an OpenBIOS package if they manage to get some code
running.  Open-PC might as well ship what they got.  I suspect they
based their design off the Atom Customer Reference Board and used
Intel's BIOS package.

  It comes down to a simple question.  Do you want to buy from Dell,
HP, Apple, ect. and get 0% Open Source and no chance of Open Source in
the future, or do you go with Open-PC (or some other vendor) with 80%
Open Source and a damn good chance of 100% in the future?

Speaking of openSuSE... Is it really open?

I have a customer that has been smitten by SuSE and wanted to use it for 
some somewhat embedded software I was to write for them.

Being used to using something else (Slackware), I made my first openSuse 
11.1 disk using the workstation nearest to me. Well, it wouldn't boot on 
any other machine. I took it to the clinic at Free Geek to see if there 
was a SuSE user who could show me how to get it to boot on another 
machine. After several hours of attempts - for which I am grateful - 
they also had to give up. I finally used the install disk to "repair" 
the installation to get it to boot on another machine, that is now the 
only machine it boot on.

Sort of reminds me of hardware locked software.

I get the volume discount. But, you could make a strong case for building
equally or better spec'd machine w. COTS hw that has open drivers for 
the same or less $.

I prefer to build my own desktop computer. I'm not a fan of Dell, 
because I just
see them as company who used commodity hw, created a brand (the Dell dude),
and offered a support contract, etc. Maybe they've changed, BTTBOMK they 
don't
participate in research and development of standards like IBM and HP.
Kudos to Dell for offering Linux pre-installed.

As for laptops, I'm an IBM/Lenovo guy because IMHO the build quality is 
unmatched.

Subject: [PLUG] usb mounting issues on Ubuntu 9.1
Message-ID: <4B5F3600.30003@robertmarktech.com>

All,

My ubuntu 9.1 machine seems to have a problem mounting large ntfs usb 
disks. When I plug the disk in dmesg says the following:
[12771.531292] usb 1-5: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and

But then nothing mounts. ls /dev shows /dev/sdd but never /dev/sdd1. 
Investigating further I opened gparted and saw there was a warning about 
ntfs bad sectors and a message to run ntfsresize. The output for that 
showed me:

****************************************************************************

I then run with the --bad-sectors and get:

New volume size    : 500105212416 bytes (500106 MB)
Nothing to do: NTFS volume size is already OK.

The disk mounts fine on my ubuntu 8.1 and on windows. My 64 bit desktop 
seems to be the only one with these issues. I have similar mounting 
problems with an ntfs formated WD drive as well. Works on the laptop, 
not on the desktop.

Anybody have any pointers for how to resolve this?

  Intel creates Customer Reference Boards (CRB) that they license to
their customers, Dell, HP, ASUS, whatever.  The CRB includes chip
information, CAD board design, BIOS, and other software needed to be
"Designed for Windows".

Like this...

Embedded Design Center
http://edc.intel.com/Platforms/

  The PC suppliers license these CRB boards and create their own
design.  Maybe swapping in an Nvidia video chip and a Broadcom LOM
into the design.  The final board design is cross-licensed and
copyrighted by several companies.  The design is a very company
confidential piece of information.  The BIOS firmware and other code
is also cross-licensed and copyrighted.

  The final design has around a 0% chance to become Open Source.  A
company would need to get a sign-off from every copyright holder, for
every line of code, board layer, and PCB trace.  It ain't going to
happen.

That will be hard pressed to perform like an average workstation from a 
decade ago.  The Atom churns out performance equal to about half of its 
clock in pentiums.  The 950 graphics card struggles to play youtube.

What's that for?  Is there a usb space heater option?

  The loose motherboards aren't Open Hardware either.  Those designs
are as encumbered with copyright and licensing as the box PC vendors.
Open Hardware means *open*.  The designs are suppose to be GPL'ed or
some other open license.

  I like my R52.  It's been a great little machine.

Daniel,

I'm still pretty much a NOOB in Linux, so this message may not be at all 
helpful, sorry if it isn't. (I've only been running Debian, and 
Mythbuntu, consistently for the last year, or so.)

I have a Western Digital external 500GB USB drive, on Mythbuntu 9.10 
(64-bit), and have seen odd issues with it mounting inconsistently (as 
an Ext3 drive). I think the problem had something to do with auto mount, 
but I never did try to diagnose it.

When the disk did auto mount, it showed up under /media/disk (My system 
picks it up as /dev/sdc, since I have two internal sata drives installed).

To work around it, I just mounted it in /etc/fstab, and called it a day. 
I leave it hooked up to the machine permanently, so this works pretty well.

I'm a bit confused as to the checks you are running... The disk shows in 
your dmesg output as /dev/sdd, yet the commands you are issuing are 
against /dev/sdb1. Is this because you are putting in a different 
computer to run the checks? Or, should you be issuing the commands 
against /dev/sdd1?

What is the output of fdisk -l when it is plugged in?

Does it ever show up when you issue the mount command? (as /media/disk, 
/media/disk0, /media/disk1, etc.)

Can you mount the drive manually on the misbehaving system?

What happens when you run chkdisk on the drive in Windows XP?

Hopefully, this is helpful. Sorry, if it isn't.

-Jim

from the Intel site:

"When you see the "Designed for Windows" logo, it signifies that the 
system or device meets Microsoft's standard for hardware compatibility 
with the specified Microsoft Windows operating system."

It seems like you might, but I don't interpret that to mean exclusivity 
to Windows.  Just that it meets the Microsoft requirement for the label. 
Dell, HP and ASUS (the brands you mention) all have contributed to OSS 
in various significant ways.

You can order computers from Dell with Linux pre-installed. Servers from 
HP in the same way.

  I didn't say it did.  "Designed for Windows" is just a feature set.
Linux, BSD, MacOS, Solaris x86, Plan 9, and others, also uses most, if
not all, of the features.

  All the machines I own were "Designed for Windows".  One flavor or
another...  Only one actually runs Windows.  I'd get rid of that
machine in a heartbeat if AutoCAD ran under WINE or there was a
reasonable Open Source equivalent.

  Intel is in the business of selling chips.  Creating CRB's and
writing software is *only* done so they can sell more chips.  They
would happily create "Designed for Linux" CRB's if there was a market
for them.

Jim,

The desktop doesn't seem to mount the ntfs partition, /dev/sdd1, but 
still reads form the drive, /dev/sdd. The commands I ran from the 
laptop, which didn't have an issue with the drive itself.

The drive mounts in windows fine. Chkdsk /f shows no errors and chkdsk 
/f /r output inforation supporting the bad sectors idea, but then 
returned saying it fixed them. Again though, the drive mounts fine and I 
can get everything I need off the usb disk. Same with the laptop. The 
drive won't mount on the desktop at all. I can't manually mount 
/dev/sdd1 since there is no sdd1 to mount. /dev/sdd is the only device 
that shows up, but the partition is contain within that. Much like 
/dev/sda, /dev/sd1,/dev/sda2, etc.

I'm wondering if it's something specific to the usb drivers on the desktop.

I'm defragging the drive in windows, hopefully that will help.

Even stranger is that the drive was mounting fine on the desktop 
yesterday right after I installed ubuntu 9.1, but sometime last night it 
decided to simply stop working. I plugged it in at one point while I was 
working with cairo-dock, and it didn't mount. I doubt something in 
cairo-dock would have affected the mounting of a usb drive though.

Does such a mainboard exist? I can't even find anything that says the
ASRock mobos are open according your definition.

I did come across this article from '07 where AMD released the source-code
for the Gigabyte M57SLI-S4 mobo. It also talkes about the FSF and their 
campaign
for a a Free BIOS and the LinuxBIOS proj.

http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/mainboards/display/20070223145912.html

But it's still not the same as GPL'ed or open licensed mobo ...

  Not to my knowledge, but I haven't been keeping up to date either.
I think there is a better chance of seeing an open mobile platform
than a desktop or laptop.  The PC platform is too closely tied to M$.
They are the big dog in that market.

  The Open Hardware concept still has a ways to go.  But, I ran Linux
v0.93b back in the day...  It seems to have done OK.

Ok, then I don't understand. I'm back to:

"Do you want to buy from Dell, HP, Apple, ect. and get 0% Open Source 
and no chance of Open Source in the future"

What's your point? What do you mean by "get 0% open source"? What 
problem are you addressing with this. You last response was because 
intel builds stuff for people and doesn't share their customers plans 
with other customers. All those companies contribute to OSS though. So 
where is this 0% coming from?

I just installed Alpine and it seems quite slow.  That is, it sometimes 
decides it's just going to sit and wait while I press commands.  Also, it 
takes about ten times longer to run my initial keystroke list.

Oh well, at least now I won't get all those stupid characters in messages

Yes, that seems to fix the problem.  I also went ahead and set ssh
something to 0.  As far as the alpine suggestion, I am not using pine
for Internet email in this case where pine should be sufficient.  The
behavior of pine that you get warnings and errors if you aren't using
secure IMAP is odd.  Usually, the default of an email reader is to be
insecure.  Evolution for example doesn't give you errors if you set
up plain text IMAP.

Message-ID: <20100127045456.GA4685@gate.kl-ic.com>

While it is nice to see another organization recognizing Linux
exists, it is sad that the idea of "open hardware" is interpreted
as "runs Linux" or "ships with Linux" as opposed to "here are the
schematics and mechanical drawings".

Here is a suggested "open hardware" scale:

-1) Mfr. has you killed if you run Linux near hardware.
    --example: Nobody - so far?

0)  Mfr. sues you if you run Linux on hardware.

1)  Mfr. ignores you if you run Linux on hardware.
    --example: Almost everybody

2)  Mfr. services your machine under warranty, if you reinstall
    Windows before you send it in.

3)  Mfr. services your machine even if you have Linux on it.
    --example: IBM laptops before Lenovo

4)  Mfr. provides closed source Linux drivers for one of the chips.

5)  Mfr. provides closed source Linux drivers for most of the chips.
    --example: "Open PC"?  Maybe 6?  Should be 8 ...

6)  Mfr. provides open source Linux drivers for most of the chips.

7)  Mfr. supports community open source driver projects for most of
    the chips.
    --example: Intel, sometimes

8)  Mfr. provides schematics for the boards.
    --example:  PC Engines ALIX if you ask nice
    --example:  S100-bus home computers, in the early 80's.

9) Mfr. provides schematics, layouts, chip netlists, etc ... 
    --example: Tektronix oscilloscopes 30 years ago

10) Mfr. provides all information necessary to duplicate from ore.

11) Mfr. provides all information, and permits potential competitors
    to freely duplicate or improve design.

Note:  there are separate scales for usability (Apple scores high),
    environmentally friendly (??), reliable, and repairable.

I "grew up" around Tektronix, so my expectations are (9), and I
prefer (11).  Tek did not share entirely out of the goodness of
their hearts.  They sold a lot of equipment to the military,
which wanted to be able to fix their equipment, /especially/ the
equipment needed to fix other equipment.  The military does not
demand that any more, and "Tek" means rebranded Chinese crap.  Sigh.

Sadly, we are in an era where companies are far less creative, and
far less likely to share any part of their trivial accomplishments. 
Unless we fight fiercely for freedom, eventually the patent pukes
become human cannibals, and get patents on victims running away. :-(

We cannot fully use our hardware, know its drawbacks, or drive
improvements unless manufacturers offer (10) or above.  A large
percentage of the issues we face in open source are because the
hardware does not work the way the manufacturer expected it to.
They stop fixing the design and improving the tests when it works
well enough to satisfy Windows users (who tolerate bugs more than
we do).  Hardware can be incredibly reliable, but only if we
demand it, and educate our neighbors to demand it as well.

Wikipedia states in:

Open-source hardware
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_hardware

"The term usually means that information about the hardware is open to
all. This would include the hardware design (i.e.schematics, bill of
materials and PCB layout data), as well as a FOSS approach to the
software that drives the hardware."

  How much of the above do you get along with your Dell, Apple, IBM, etc?

  How much of the above do you expect to get with an Open-PC?

I haven't seen symptoms like that. Have you tried running alpine under 
strace to see where the delays are occurring?

Also, I highly recommend Eduard Chappa's fillpara patch:

   http://staff.washington.edu/chappa/alpine/patches/${VER}/fillpara.patch.gz

(where $VER probably equals 2.00, but I don't know if you're running a 
different release). The Ctrl-J paragraph reformats are much smarter.

I have been digging into X driver code and the libddc library
learning how to do EDID programming.  It looks doable, though
I've had to dig pretty deep, and the X folks mostly stopped
writing documententation in the early 1990s ... :-(

This morning it occured to me:  although reprogramming screens
with only software is a nice capability to have, it is a dangerous
tool in the hands of idiots.  Especially the evil idiots who write
or propagate viruses.  Zeroing out EDID can Really Screw Up many
laptops, and many desktop displays as well.  Perhaps this is not
a capability I want to help facilitate, after all. 

Especially if the graphics drivers operate partly in user space. 
Perhaps somebody with far more X chops than I wants to make sure
that graphics drivers are written so that this CAN'T happen.  I
don't know how windoze graphics drivers work, but this seems
like just the kind of security-bypassing shortcut that a
"video-game-friendly" graphics driver might permit.

Back to the hardware/cable approach!

Programming Has Problems....

Any sufficiently dumbed down, easy to implement, solution creates an
inversely equal level of problems in actual use. In this case, the PHP
"session" development was initially implemented (IIRC) as a way for
coding newbies to slap together very simple way of maintaining state
on an inherently stateless medium (http), with expected levels of poor
performance, scalability, and security.

Unfortunately, the way PHP matured (if that's the right word to use)
was that a great many folks saw the simple shortcuts and used them,
rather than writing better solutions.

I'm not a developer. So this has no immediate adverse effect on me. 
Having said that, my well endowed Latitude seems to work 100% with 
Ubuntu 9.x. The integrated webcam, the illuminated keyboard and ambient 
light sensor, the bluetooth, wired and wireless, all expansion ports, 
suspend, hibernate, everything, out of the box. Aside from that, I can 
only assume the models Dell offers with Linux preinstalled that they 
work equally as well. I might also assume this is even better on the 
Thinkpad side of the fence based on years of hearing positive 
experiences from friends and online.

How much of the above to I get from Dell? Apparently it doesn't matter 
in my case. Whoever is responsible for writing code in Ubuntu seemed to 
have no problem making it work on my laptop either way.

This is the same mis-perception that I had about open hardware.
Which is that if open source sw runs on it than it must be open.
This is a much different definition that Keith L. and Steve D. have put 
forth.

Drivers can be reverse engineered. Ubuntu includes the use of
proprietary drivers, as where Debian won't include FOSS sw like
Thunderbird or Firefox just on the premise of branding alone.

Even if Dell, IBM, Intel, etc provide open source drivers it still 
doesn't make
the hardware open. It just means they decided to play nice
w. the Linux/FOSS community.

I'd say it potentially applies across the board, from the most
venerable C libraries where faults are still being found *many* years
later, to the very latest ruby gems (CPAN modules, PEAR modules, etc.
etc.) written or updated in the last 24 hours. Dijkstra had a really
great essay/rant/philosophy about it, the underlying problem being
that issues are created (or magnified) when people don't know what
they're actually doing, because they're blindly running code they
don't understand.

Frequently in security people like to assert that usability and
security are a simple trade-off.  In some specific instances this is
true, but in most cases it's simply false, IMHO.  There is often a
solution, with the right design, to provide the same level of
usability with better security.

I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, but you seemed to touch on
that assertion.

Take a look at Python and Ruby and the web frameworks written for
them. I can't really vouch for many of them, but the languages
themselves are better designed/maintained.

There is no misperception. I never said it was open. The point I was 
making was that it works in spite of that. That apparently, it was /open 
enough/.

As Keith stated:

"open hardware" is interpreted as "runs Linux" or "ships with Linux" as opposed to "here are the schematics and mechanical drawings".

As Steve stated:

"The term usually means that information about the hardware is open to

all. This would include the hardware design (i.e.schematics, bill of

materials and PCB layout data), as well as a FOSS approach to the

software that drives the hardware."

It's either open per the consensus of what the definition of open is or it's not.

You're certainly welcome to your /open enough/ opinion. Per Keith's scale of 
"openness", your definition is in the 3 -5 range. Where I think the general consensus
of 'open" hw is in the 8 - 10 range else it's a mis-understanding/perception of what "open" hw
is generally understood to be defined as...

Depends on where you're getting this consensus from. If you're talking about
people in general, I think running Linux is probably a very good gauge of
'open.' If you're talking about IT pros, possibly not quite so much. If
you're talking about Linux enthusiasts to professionals then the bar is set
much higher. Of course this list qualifies as that last part, so you're kind
of preaching to the choir.

Good luck at ever getting a consensus from 100 random people on the street
that would come even close to your 8-10 range that you talk about.

(Note that even though this might sound like I'm not for open hardware based
on your definition, that assumption would be wrong. I'm only questioning
your definition and narrowness of 'consensus.')

There's the meaning that some jargon has to the professional, and very
frequently those things mean other things to the populace at large, if they
mean anything at all. Of course this is true no matter what the profession.
(Well, I guess there could be exceptions. I wonder how much jargon exists at
your local fast food restaurant??)

Well said, and "consensus" might be a poor choice of words. As at this
stage it's not about considering opinions to come up with a definition
as that's already been done.

So it's a matter of the general populace reading what is the generally 
agreed upon definition
of "open" as it pertains to hardware and software. And then taking said 
consensus. I don't how
you could have a consensus w/o the exchange of information/knowledge. So 
you need a reference
point to begin the conversation and that has been provided.

The intention of most hw mfrs. is to retain their IP, so they attempt to 
close off access to their product
I think all I'm saying is that reverse engineering, jailbreaking, etc != 
"open" to any degree. If I was to break
into bldg w. set of lock picks, I'm not gonna say, "well, the door was 
/open enough/ for me to get in." As it was
clearly closed and the intention was to keep people out, but I was 
skilled enough to find a way in...

In four easy steps:

  1. Learn Haskell
  2. Install and learn darcs
  3. Install and learn cabal
  4. Decode the Happstack API

Sort of reminds me of Steve Martin's "You can be a millionaire and 
never pay taxes" routine. First step: "get a million dollars." :-)

Reverse engineering is legal, breaking and entering is not. 
Understanding how the lock works by taking it apart is legal, defeating 
the lock to trespass is not. But don't let that stop you from making 
horrible analogies and jabs.

Haha, yeah so I pushed/stretched the analogy a bit...But, it's not about
what's legal and what's not. It's about the intention to provide 
unencumbered/unfettered
access to your product. HW mfrs. are still closing off access to their 
work to protect their "IP".
Just because a hw mfr can't come up w. a foolproof way to close
access doesn't mean that it's "open" in any way, shape, or form. Heck, 
with most hw mfrs if you
break the seal, you void the warranty. Talk about breaking and 
entering... :-)

I worked at a business that was Microsoft all the way, but some IT
folks (like myself) had the freedom to use linux, and many servers
were linux or solaris (especially oracle servers). The servers were
never set up with AD interoperability (why have a server in a locked
room that is set up for anybody to log onto?), but some of the IT
desktops were. I personally didn't mess with it, except as a proof of
concept to make sure I understood how to do it. It took all of 10
minutes to get it working on a gentoo box with no prior experience
with it. It's not that tough.

The problem with a lot of firms is that they need software that is
only written for Windows. This was an engineering firm, where they
used a lot of SmartPlant, Benteley and AutoCAD software. Once the
constraint of Windows on the desktop is in place, the path of least
resistance is to use Windows for everything else as well. You have to
be able to support the workstations, therefore you need windows
techs. They are going to be more comfortable with AD and Exchange than
OpenLDAP and postfix. But as soon as you throw oracle in the mix, you
introduce linux servers, and probably another team of admins who are
linux guys. Then comes the turf wars and tension.

Pretty much.  A mixed OS shop, and there are very few that aren't 
anymore, the path of least resistance is a Windows server 
infrastructure.  With single sign on products, and the availability of 
linux authentication software such as Quest Authentication Services 
(used to be Vintela) that entirely replaces naming services on the Linux 
systems with AD hooks.
There are many business drivers for doing it that way, not that I'm 
advocating it, but it is just easier to manage for a business, and you 
will get all the users crying about having to remember too many 
passwords.  ;-)

I would say 90% of the shops I go to, even big *nix environments, are 
using AD or migrating to AD as their LDAP. Some of the big shops have a 
mixed LDAP (SunOne and AD), but AD seems to be winning out.

IME, small-ish environments (1-100 users) pretty much tie into AD not
because they have to, but because they're using Exchange, SQL Server,
or some other Windows server product already, and (as others have
noted), sometimes the path of least resistance (and effort) is to
install AD onto a few servers, and go from there.

Larger environments (100-10,000) users are more likely to have a mix
of AD/LDAP (i.e. a non-AD LDAP)/NIS/etc., but the thing worth noting
is not that AD has *replaced* all other Directory Services, but that
in a large number of work environments, AD is likely to be *part* of
the mix, even if it's only used for one department, or one service.

So, perhaps the assumption that "AD has pretty much taken over Dir
Services" might be better phrased as "environments that use/require
Dir Services will likely require some AD experience".

Well said. It's just odd to me that the job titles is "Linux Sys Admin"
and most of the required skills/experience are Linux centric except AD. 

I've been Linux Sys Admin in 2 smaller shops that ran a mix of MS, Linux, Unix
and neither used AD or any DS for that matter. It just seems to be a bit more prolific
than a few yrs ago and I only have a basic understanding of and a small amount
of experience with. So I guess what I'm really saying, is that it in today's tech job market
knowing and having work experience w. AD is a common requirement.

Believe it or not, there are a lot of benefits to AD in a Windows 
environment. Group Policy being a big one. If you have a lot of Apple 
clients it makes sense to get OSX server into the mix for administering 
those as well.

No luck so far on the mythbuntu IRC, so I'll try locally.

When using the ltsp-build-client command to set up a diskless front 
end, what username and password does the --mythbuntu-user-credentials

As another data point my employer, 50,000+ users, has AD and just 
completed Vintella rollout to integrate the *nix environments into it.

The *nix people, me included, are very happy with the change.

I haven't done this before, but, I think that it is talking about the 
mythtv user account. I'm guessing that it will mirror the existing user 
account (w/proper permissions) inside the bootable image.

I don't think it is the mysql user account information, as that is 
specified in mythfrontend.

Good luck!

I recruited Jeri Ellsworth.  As of two weeks ago, she was still a go.
I have no idea what she plans to talk about (I'm checking), But I
expect it to be good.

I listened to about 1/2 of her talk at Stanford in '05. She's a very down to
earth and real person whose lead an interesting life. She talks a lot
about how her friends, family, and other people supported her tinkering
and interests...

I have seen her talk, at Hackers in November.  She probably won't
be able to give you a proper title - she is very hard to fit in
one category.  But her talks are OUTSTANDING, and I expect this
to be the best General meeting speaker we have ever had.  Unless
you have an emergency, life-saving surgery Thursday night, you 
should be there, and make room for others to be there.  If you
have a school or work assignment due Friday, bring your teacher
or boss, and in gratitude they will let it slide until Monday.

And by the way, she is brainy and attractive.  Some of you may
have a geeky/loner weakness for that, and fumble into some
inappropriate behavior.  Understandable, but please suck it up
and behave yourselves.  Think of her as the smart sister you
always wanted to have, and pay attention to what she has to say.

I've done quite a bit of research on this but I just can't seem to get 
Bluetooth to work. I read some posts that say you have to compile 
bluetooth kernel support and others that say it just works out of the box.
I have looked at all the output from dmesg, lsmod, and syslog regarding 
Bluetooth and I don't see any indication
of any problems. I have the Bluez stack installed as well as other 
Bluetooth pkgs/libraries.

I've gathered all the info I could think of regarding Bluetooth. Any 
advice on what to try next is greatly appreciated!

I've never gotten bluetooth to work reliably with my thinkpad.  I
finally realized that it had to do with where they placed the antenna
on my particular model.  At the very bottom of the machine so ALL of
the hardware is between the radio, and anything you want it to connect
to.  When I got some things to support the laptop in the air, and put
bluetooth devices under it I had better success.  Unfortunately I
discovered that whenever bluetooth was active my WIFI crapped out.  My
guess is because the wifi card is right next to the bluetooth card.
Having bluetooth work wasn't worth having WIFI not work so I stopped
working on it.  I also tried an external usb->bluetooth adapter, but
didn't figure out how to turn that on without also turning on the
internal problematic one.  I think though that I might be able to
unplug the internal one, and that might solve the problem.

I've had bluetooth working on my T42, but I haven't used it for a
couple years.

Bluetooth comes it two grades, class1 and class2.  Class 1 is designed for
100m, Class 2 is designed for 10m.  Also, bluetooth uses 2.4GHz, same
as wifi, so it's natural to expect some interference.

I used it to bridge a serial port to some instrumentation that needed
to be untethered.  Worked great.

Here is an example of one of her talks
http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1053309060448851979#
Also Steve Wozniak (co founder of Apple) is admin of her facebook fanpage.

You might rethink having her as a sister if you watch that video, and
hear about how she tormented her brother with exploding capacitors as
a kid.

Do you have Bluetooth enabled in the BIOS?  If it is, do you know that
the hardware works at all?

There's also a class 3, although I've never heard of any devices that
use it because it is so low power. Most devices these days are class 2,
although my neighbor's new HP printer must be class 1 because it is
presenting a strong signal to my Thinkpad which is at least 20m
away.

I didn't see where Mike mentioned what model Thinkpad he has. But at
least I can say that Bluetooth on my T61 has always worked well,
although getting different distros to get it working has sometimes been
an issue. And, once I get the required modules working I never have a
problem with the connection. Ditto for wifi, and I often have both
working at the same time without issue. I have no idea where the module
is located, though.

During a recent voyage through various distros the only one which had
issues was Debian Squeeze. After a week I never did get bluetooth
working, although I didn't spend much time on it. I had other more
serious issues with Squeeze that eventually caused me to abandon it.
Bluetooth "just worked" when I installed OpenSuse 11.1 and 11.2, and
Fedora 11 and 12.

I bought my first bluetooth device (a mouse) back in my Ubuntu days
when the latest and greatest was Gutsy. I had issues getting it
working, but eventually I discovered a utility called Blueman that was
not in the repos. When I installed it Blueman installed a list of
dependencies, and uninstalled quite a few bluetooth packages that
Ubuntu came with. Blueman worked well and I was happy with it. 

When I left Ubuntu I was at Jaunty. I never installed Blueman on Jaunty
because by the time of Jaunty the Ubuntu developers had gotten
bluetooth working reasonably well without it. I should add that when
Intrepid was released it came with a major rewrite of a lot of
bluetooth utilities and modules. I did have an occasional problem with
my mouse disconnecting under Intrepid and Jaunty, but it was easy to
reconnect when it happened, which was about once a week. 

When I installed Fedora 11 I noticed that it came with Blueman. And I
have to say that bluetooth is working better for me on Fedora 11 than
it ever did on any version of Ubuntu. For example, I bought a pair of
audiophile headphones when I had Hardy and they worked well, but after
the upgrade to Intrepid they quit working and I could never get a peep
out of them. With Fedora 11 they work perfectly again. So does my
phone. 

As a not very scientific effort at troubleshooting, here is a partial
list of packages that I have installed. I obtained this list just by
searching in Yumex on "bluetooth":

blueman, bluez, bluez-alsa (both 32- and 64-bit), bluez-cups,
bluez-gnome, bluez-gnome-analyzer, bluez-gstreamer (both 32- and
64-bit), bluez-hcidump, bluez-libs, bluez-libs-devel (both 32- and
64-bit), gnome-bluetooth, gnome-bluetooth-libs (both 32- and 64-bit),
gnome-bluetooth-libs-devel (both 32- and 64-bit), gnome-user-share,
gnome-vfs2-obexftp, gvfs-obexftp, kde-bluetooth, libbctl (both 32- and
64-bit), obex-data-server, obexd, pulseaudio-module-bluetooth, rfkill.

Perhaps looking through the above list will help Mike find a missing
package that will get his bluetooth working.

Yes, Infrafred is enabled in the BIOS. I'm not sure if the hw works 
or not as this is the 1st time I've actually tried to use it. I presume
since the hw is being seen and there's no errors, that it should work. But I
don't know of any other ways to test it than running the commands / apps. If the
hw wasn't functional I would think I would get some very obvious errors or the OS/Kernel
would see it...?

Hmm, you might be onto something here. I run Sidux, a
distro derived from Debian Sid. I usually upgrade
at least once a month and I tend to run run
"apt-get dist-upgrade" instead of just  "apt-get upgrade".
Maybe due to that I'm pulling in "Squeeze" pkgs which
are the culprit.

~# cat /etc/debian_version

squeeze/sid

I'm running KDE and I seem to have all the requisite Bluez and KDE
bluetooth pkgs installed. I actually uninstalled most of the peripheral
Bluex pkgs in case one of them was causing the problem. 

My troubleshooting procedure at this point is:

1. See info about the internal Bluetooth device.

2. Discover external Bluetooth device.

3. Connect to external device.

Right now, I'm stuck on Step 1.

If he retaliated electronically, it would have been great fun.  As a
kid, I zapped people with capacitors out of TV set high voltage power
supplies, though my favorite targets were other geeks.  I guess this
particular form of psychopathy is embedded in circuit geek DNA. 

Meanwhile code geeks torment others with subtle bugs and really weird
U.I.s, and auto design geeks hide the oil filters in places only an
octopus can get to.  I guess geeks use the evil talents available.

I assume you have tried a live CD. If not, try one of the bleeding edge
ones like Karmic, Mint, or Fedora. I have used all of the above at one
time or another, and they found the bluetooth device in my T61 and
automatically configured it. If one of them finds it, then hopefully it
will give you more clues.

Oh, and here is a really dumb suggestion. On my T61 there is a radio
slide switch on the front. Its function is to kill all radios by
physically disconnecting them. I recall one time being unable to get the
wireless working. Ubuntu couldn't even see it. After an hour of
swearing in several languages I discovered the switch. OK, I said it
was a dumb suggestion. 

And as long as I'm insulting you with suggestions that I'm sure you've
already tried, there is the BIOS. I once had someone unable to get
sound or USB to work and it turned out that a previously installed
version of Windows had set his BIOS to Safe Boot Mode, disabling those
things.

OK, I'll shut up now. :)

There's quite a handful for common lisp: araneida, hunchentoot,
allegroserve, and the minimalist mod_lisp. I use araneida, and I find
it to be wholly enjoyable. It makes a lot of sense to use lisp for the
web. I don't write HTML; instead I write lisp forms that look a lot
like HTML, and araneida has a simple function for rewriting it as an
HTML string on the way out the door. This opens up a world of
possibilities for using lisp to generate HTML.

I would not recommend araneida for someone entering the lisp web game;
I would instead nod toward hunchentoot. I would have made the switch
myself, but I have too much code already, and I have patched araneida
to do all the things I need.

Carlos,

   That's interesting. Are the results w3c compliant, or does that not
matter?

   I suppose a side effect of your approach is job security; not too many
others able to step right in to maintain or change the site(s).

If you use hunchentoot, you can tell it to generate either HTML 4.01
or XHTML. And the lispy format you use to write your
HTML-as-S-expressions is pluggable; pick your poison. Hunchentoot is
written by Dr. Edi Weitz, who is a very fine software engineer.

Your comment re: job security is most certainly true. But I always
tell people that lisp is is over 50 years old, and if no one knows it,
it's their fault for not educating themselves in this fundamental area
of computer science. Learning lisp has catapulted me into a much
higher valence level of programming ability, even when using non-lisp
languages. For instance, I am finally learning C++ in school, and I
find all of it to be elementary. The last time I took a serious look
at it, it seemed cryptic and obtuse. (Well, I still argue that the
plethora of syntactical constructs needed to get the job done in C++
is unnecessary; simply adopt the syntax of lisp.)

Good suggestion that I didn't think of. Heck, Sidux is a liveCD so I could just
run that and see what I get.

*ALL* radios, eh? I thought it was just the wifi. But it is enabled as I'm using
the onboard wireless. I saw a few postings mention fn+F5 to toggle the Infrared.
However, when I use that key combo the wireless  LED  goes out. And the graphic 
on the F5 button seems to match the graphic on the wireless switch. Which is 
different than the graphic on the infrared port, which made think the switch 
was only for the wifi device.

Actually when I checked the BIOS there was 2 settings for Infrared. One was for
the physical port which had IRQ, and Memory settings. And the 2nd one was for something
that I can't recall now but was disabled. 

Don't ever worry about insulting me with asking dumb / obvious questions. Often times in 
troubleshooting these are the ones people are afraid to ask or make assumptions about and then
small easy problems become big difficult ones...

Or if you happen to have xsel installed
cat file | xsel -b
The xsel man page has a nice description of the three types of X
selections. -b puts stuff in the clipboard selection which is what you
were doing with the xclip command above.

Well folks, it seems we have some guests from out of town this week. Specifically, Canonical is having a meeting here with their folks from all over. This morning, I got to meet Jonathan RIddell, who is responsible for Kubuntu and is from Edinburgh, Scotland.

Jonathan is busy during the days, but would love to meet local Linux folk (especially those using Kubuntu) in the evenings. Send me an email directly and I'll forward it on to him. Maybe we can have a general meetup, drink beer, and make new friends.

I have been using Kubuntu since the days of Breezy Badger.  It would be
great to sit down and talk with Jonathan while he is in town.  My work
schedule is such that I only have time in the first half of the week or at
nights after 8:00 so I doubt if I will have the opportunity to meet him.  If
I am wrong, and a meeting takes place outside my work hours, I would gladly
make great effort to attend.

Yes, we are counting on Jeri.
I have watched some of her videos.
They are great, and I'm looking forward to her presentation.
However, I'm having a bit of trouble writing an announcement,
since I don't have a title and topic.

We have been keeping the power on, yet shutting down regularly (~2-3
times/day) and had no failures for 7 days.  Then we started powering
off the modem and the computer after shutdown, and powering up the
modem and the computer to restart (push front button 2-10 seconds
after turning on the power).  After 3 days of this we had a network
failure--same as before--no ping response from the modem.  I shut down
and restarted w/o power interruption 3 times, and each time it came up
w/ the network failed.  Then I shut down and then turned the power off
to the computer (sw. on back), leaving the modem powered.  After about
30 seconds of this I repowered the computer and restarted.  Network
came up functional.

When in the failed state I checked the lights on the NIC: speed steady
orange meaning 100Mbps; Activity slow blinking yellow meaning data
activity.  The blinking is synchronized with the blinking on the
modem.

When in a functional state the lights are the same.

I neglected to try ifconfig eth0 ifup/ifdown routines.  Next time.

That is when Dorkbot PDX meets, you might consider that for
concentrated geekdom.  At Backspace at about about 5th and Couch in NW
Portland.

Great.  I'll stick out like a sore thumb.  Hopefully someone will  
recognize me from Adv. Topics and flag me down.

EXCELLENT. I'll see you there and I'm BCCing this to Jonathan. Hopefully we will all converge at about the same time. Should be fun.

Subject: [PLUG] QXGA screen EDID with Ponyprog
Message-ID: <20100201062152.GA23313@gate.kl-ic.com>

Today I successfully compiled Ponyprog2000 for Linux, and used
a 2 transistor parallel-port circuit to make I2C signals,  and
a spare laptop screen cable to program the EDID bits on a QXGA
2048x1536 laptop screen.  The screen is installed in my wife's
T60 and working fine.

More information at http://wiki.keithl.com/index.cgi?QxGa

If anyone else wants to program a QXGA screen for a T60, contact
me and we can do it.  It is pretty fast when everything is set up.
