Most mail agents allow restrictions based on source and destination 
separately.  In a default Postfix configuration, the smtpd will accept 
mail if the recipient is local--so anyone on the Net can send mail to 
local users.  And it will relay mail to any destination, provided the 
sender is local.  This should be based on the sender's host, not the 
provided sender address, which is easy to spoof.

So to answer your question, Jeme, LAN users get full email access to and 
from the rest of the Internet, but relay access is denied to hosts 
without that LAN.  This is good.  By protecting your server against 
random spam relay, you also help keep it off of blacklists, which 
ultimately restrict your own access.

Now if you need to use your MTA from random locations, as wireless users 
do, you should use some sort of authentication, be it SMTP or POP, etc. 
  Which, unlike simple LAN relay access, can be difficult to configure. 
  I suspect this contributes something to the number of open relays, in 
fact.  SMTP authentication should just amount to a flag in the ol' 
config' file, but in my experience, it's not that simple.  So rather 
than recompile Postfix with SASL support, a lot of people probably opt 
to just open up the smtpd and hope no one seriously exploits it.

To generate a key pair, use 'ssh-keygen'.

Attached is an ssh tutorial I wrote a while back on getting set up with
OpenSSH; it should be readable for a new user. PLUG admins: this can be
added to the PLUG Howto archive if it seems useful.

For remote ssh commands, disabling host key checking and x forwarding
might speed up execution, as might use of a smallar key. By default
ssh-keygen gives you 1024 bits; this will give you a smallar key:

ssh-keygen -b 512

In the way of an example, this shows what a user's up to on a host:

ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -1 -x eel.engr.orst.edu w -h creelan

The Least you need to know about SSH (OpenSSH 3, protocols 1.5/2)
SSH Tutorial, Tyler Creelan, tyler.creelan at orst.edu
-----------

With telnet, rsh, ftp, and rlogin, network packets are sent in the
clear; your password is broadcast publicly to the network. An observer
may store your packets and obtain your password. Additionally, under
these protocols, the host you communicate with may not be the host you
think it is. A router between you and your destination may pose as the
host you are trying to reach.

The Secure SHell client 'ssh' provides:
1) Integrity (machine is actually who you think it is)
2) Authentication (more choices as to how you can be verified)
3) Confidentiality (information exchanged is kept private.)

-- Create public/private key pair(s) --

The first step in using 'ssh' is to create your public/private key pair:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 512

This will create a 512 bit ssh2 key of type rsa. You can also choose
'dsa' as your cipher; however dsa verification is slower and no more
secure; You could also use 1024 or 2048 as your key size, this will
make your public key harder to factor but slows you down while logging in.

Save the keys to the default location; hiding your keys in an obscure
directory won't make them more secure. You may decide to add a
passphrase to your key later; for now leave it blank. Copy your
fingerprint and save it in a file, store this file somewhere in your
.ssh directory for later.

Now, in '~/.ssh', you have two keys, 'id_rsa' and 'id_rsa.pub'. Don't
ever do anything with the 'id_rsa' private key; don't copy, move, or
view it; keep it private. You can do anything with the public key, but
you should avoid modifying its contents.

-- Authorizing keys --

The first basic application of your keys is to avoid typing a password
when hopping between machines on the same nfs server, for example,
stak. This is achieved by authenticating yourself:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

the new file 'authorized_keys' will store all public keys. Now
you should be able to hop from eel to flop without typing your
password; if you are still being prompted for your password, you may
need to change some configuration settings, described later.

On your home unix box, do the same thing; generate a key, store
it. Now you should have two key pairs, one for home and one for your
stak account. Ftp your stak id_rsa.pub over to your home box:

scp username at flop.engr.orst.edu:.ssh/id_rsa.pub id_rsa.pub.flop

Now add this to your authorized_keys file at home:

cat id_rsa.pub.flop >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Note; you may want to make a shell function for this; ie:

addkey() { # Authorize a public key
        if ["$1"]; then
                cp -f --preserve ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.backup
                echo "Adding key "$1" to .ssh/authorized_keys"
                cat $1 >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
        else
                echo "Usage: addkey <publickey file>"
        fi
}

Now repeat these steps only for your stak account:

scp username at your.home.box:.ssh/id_rsa.pub id_rsa.pub.home
addkey id_rsa.pub.home 

Now you should be able to ssh from home to school, and back and forth
without typing any passwords. If this doesn't work, it could be
because of your ssh configuration, or because of an OpenSSH
incompatibilty problem, which is not uncommon but can usually be resolved.

Applications such as scp and sftp use the ssh client also; you should
also be able to scp files back and forth without providing a password
either.

-- Configuration and Options --

Default ssh configuration options are stored in the file: 

/etc/ssh/ssh_config.

Copy this to create your personal default configuration file:

cp /etc/ssh/ssh_config ~/.ssh/config

To learn what these options mean, use 'info ssh'. There's a wealth of
options not present in the default config file. Remember that you can
also specify these as command-line options, to both ssh and programs
like scp. This can also be useful in scripts when using ssh to execute
commands remotely, ie;

ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -1 -x eel.engr.orst.edu w -h creelan

will remotely query eel to see what user 'creelan' is up to, without
strictly verifying the host. In this circumstance, if the machine we
connected to was not eel, and we used public key authentication, then
the impostor would not gain any useful information from our
exchange. If passwords were being used, this exchange would be
detrimental, however.

-- Protocol 1 vs. 2 --

At some point you will probably also have to create an SSH v.1 key,
for backward compatibility with machines that don't support v.2. This
means that sometimes ssh will use your v.2 key and sometimes your
v.1 key, by default it will check for both; these options are: 

PreferredAuthentications publickey,hostbased,password,keyboard-interactive
Protocol 2,1    
RSAAuthentication yes

Sometimes this doesn't work properly; or you may need to stipulate the
version when running ssh, so I keep some hosts aliased:

# ---- SSH aliases ------
alias ssh="ssh -x "
alias ucs="ssh -2 creelant ucs.orst.edu"
alias eel="ssh -2 eel.engr.orst.edu"
alias trek="ssh -2 trek.cs.orst.edu"
alias kestrel="ssh -1 12.224.122.103"
alias goshawk="ssh -1 192.168.1.102"

-- X-forwarding --

ssh also can set up Xauthority data and X-forwarding, this can be convenient:

ssh -X eel.engr.orst.edu

will establish a link with X-forwarding; now ssh will set your
$DISPLAY to something like: localhost:12.0

Unfortunately, sometimes X applications (xemacs for example) are
compiled using the local libraries and this $DISPLAY doesn't work;
sometimes this can corrected by changing $DISPLAY to eel:12.0 instead
of localhost:12.0, for example.

Generally though setting up X forwarding is additional overhead;
disable it by default and invoke on the command line as needed.

-- More ssh notes -- 
Try using the verbose setting -v, -vv, or -vvv if something isn't
going right.

If they play it right, the RIAA could actually use this as a stick and
carrot to get people to buy more of their music. If they set up an online
music service, for example, subscribers could be offered immunity from
network attacks. Conversely, non-subscribers could be targeted with
attacks since it's more probable they are infringing on copyright in
one form or another.

The RIAA might even offer a blanket-type license, covering a wide range of
media, and it could be argued that people are infringing copyright by not
subscribing to the blanket service, just as MS argued in the
Portland schools case that all computers should have an MS license
regardless of their make or model.

Incidentally, this article by professor Siva Vaidhyanathan on the
interaction between higher education and copyright is good reading:

I don't think that will happen. On the other hand, there are some really 
substantial threats to liberty on the Internet that are coming down the 
pike. It is breathtaking to think about the implications if all of it were 
to succeed.

There are some interests who seem to want to mold the Internet into a 
tightly controlled medium with much less freedom for the individual. Yeah, 
just what we need another television.

I have to say though that mass music sharing is not helpful. It is clear 
that they violate copyright laws in ways that are easy for lawmakers and 
others to understand. In terms of public policy, it can be used as a 
wedge, the camel's nose in the tent for all kinds of harmful legislation.

Well, this one doesn't have to do with the IEEE yet but perhaps it would 
be good to get them involved.

The RMS talk will be sponsored by OGI and ACM-OSU.

Would you show up for that? Would others here come see RMS? We'd want a 
decent turnout. I think that he would have somewhat broad appeal, even if 
you don't agree with everything he says.

He says his talks are a couple hours long and include a question and 
answer discussion. Presumably, we would have some sort of reception 
afterward so people could mingle and so on.

I disagree wholeheartedly.  I think it is perfectly clear according to the
letter of the law that all non-commercial speech is protected and does not
fall under the limitations of Title 17.

The various publishing industries would like you to believe that
non-commercial activity can be illegal, but it's simply not the case...
yet.  Unfortunately, so many people have been convinced by their
propaganda (like the absurd "FBI WARNING" screens and ridiculous blanket
statements like "unauthorized reproduction prohibited"), they just might
succeed in passing laws that people think are already on the books.

It's very hard to get accurate information about the publishing industries
when all of your information comes from the publishing industries (and a
damned few players in those industries, to boot).

You might want to look at Rob's message again.

You rarely have to reboot your machine.  Certainly not after editing a
flat file, even a configuration file.

Also, I wouldn't edit XF86Config-4.  Use Xconfiguratior.

Regarding your IP issue:  I have a static IP, so my experience is
limited.  Sounds like you need to set the machine to use DHCP.  One way
to do this might be to use Linxuconf (run as root), go to "Host Name and
IP Detection", select which adapter you use (probably Adapter 1) and
then select DHCP under config mode.

However more importantly I think you might want to head down to Powell's
and get yourself a book (I like Osborne's "The Complete Reference to
RedHat Linux") or at the very least do some searching on google.

I'd like a clarification on this, Jeme.

If I understand what you've been trying to pound into my head <G>, what you 
are saying below is that anyone may legally copy a VHS tape, Cassette or CD 
and give it away. That it's only when you try to sell it that it becomes

I'd like a clarification on this, Jeme.

If I understand what you've been trying to pound into my head <G>, what you 
are saying below is that anyone may legally copy a VHS tape, Cassette or CD 
and give it away. That it's only when you try to sell it that it becomes 
illegal.

Is that what you are saying?

That's always been my understanding of fair use. You get that right to use
them for yourself as well. For example: I buy CDs, but my Jeep only has a
tape deck. It is well within my rights to record that CD to tape and then
take it with me in my Jeep so that I may play it. That's where the
collective wetting of pants came into play with VCRs. Nobody was going to go
to movies anymore since you could get them at home and people were going to
make copy after copy to give away and it would be legal and the movie
industry would collapse...I'm young, but even I remember this.

The part I think is interesting is the kickbacks on media. The RIAA gets a
cut of every blank tape (vhs/audio) sold, and IIRC, they set up a similar
deal with CDs...

I'm not sure how to go about this...but I have a server at one location
running linux, and I want to mount it at another location with a win xp
machine. Is this possible without needing ftp?

Does samba work over the net?
is there something similar to a samba like service that would allow certain
ips/hosts to mount a shared resource... and be somewhat secure?

It wasn't an issue for me since SuSE had built their OpenSSH package 
from non-trojaned sources. I wonder if the anti-open source camps will 
use this as an argument as to why closed-source is more secure?

You should be able to just log out of X and have it start using the
new configuration at that point... this is if you use "gdm" and it's
configured to always restart the X server. :-) I don't know if "kdm"
offers the similar, or if Red Hat uses "gdm" or "kdm" in your
configuration.

If you don't see a system menu on your login screen, and it's "gdm",
you can:

 Log out of X;

 Exit to a Linux console with "Ctrl-Alt-F1", or if that does not work,
 try "Alt-SysReq-F1";

 Log in on the console as root;

 Edit /etc/gdm/gdm.conf, and in the "[Greeter]" section, make it say
 "SystemMenu=true".

 Type "/etc/init.d/gdm restart", and if that does not work, then try
 "killall -HUP gdm" and wait for "init" to restart it.  (It should not
 be getting run by init like that; I don't like that about Red Hat.
 I've never had "gdm" die and need to be auto restarted; I prefer to
 run it from an init.d script.)

 Now at the GDM login screen, you should have a system menu that will
 allow you to configure "gdm" through a GUI.  You won't have to edit
 it's configuration file again.  Type the root password to get in.

 Find where it says whether to always restart the X server, and set it
 so it will.  Now your X changes will take effect right after you log
 out and the X server restarts.

I don't have details on how it works ... but here is my experience.
I've got roughly a dozen system configs registered with RHN, and
was already thinking about buying a couple of 'subscriptions' so
I could be working with multiple 'up2date' sessions simultaneously.
But, finances being what they are I just kept slogging away with a
single (basic and free [as in beer]) subscription.

On June 20, it became damned near impossible to connect to the up2date
server.  So I got on the RHN web site, bought a $60 1-system subscription
and have had no problems since.  The cool part, is that by buying just
one subscription, I get to entitle 2 systems -- and, afaik, both connect
at the higher, paid-for, priority.

This book covers "Red Hat like systems" as well as "Debian".  Much of
it applies to any distro, of course.

download it and ungzip it before you can read it with "acroread".
Most people will choose the HTML, I imagine.

That may be a solution for now, but I wouldn't be surprised if there is a
bug in one or more of the programs you use that causes it to consume more
file descriptors than it should.

One way to test this would be to randomly kill processes when this
happens.  Of course, an even better approach would be to write a perl
script that ever so often tries to open a file.  If it fails with the
error code you mention then it saves some accounting information about the
machine to a log file.  Then you compare things like netstat, ps, and I
think there are commands for listing information about file descriptors.

It very well could be that the sheer number of users is causing the
problem, but it seems odd to me...

HTH,
Jason

I've been having some problems with the server that I maintain
(apache+mod_perl), and the mod_perl mailing list suggests that
I send all this information

OS
apache version
mod_perl version
output of perl -V

Funny thing is, when I type perl -V, I get back this from the server:

[colink at rock ~]$ rpm -q perl
perl-5.6.1-26.72.3
[colink at rock ~]$ perl -V
syntax error at /dev/null line 1, near "=="
Execution of /dev/null aborted due to compilation errors.

So that was strange, and I have access to another almost identical box
here at work (RH 7.2).  perl -V works fine on it.

Does anyone have any suggestions/ideas on what I'm up against?  Have I been
hacked?

Thanks,
Colin

I think if they did, all the times Micro$oft let worm-infested software

That was a good read, I don't understand much of the code, but it was
easy to see what the code does to keep the server from crashing.

As per the rpm man page, the state of first two files can't be 
determined as your permissions are not sufficent. The third is different 
from the original in that it has a different file size, md5sum, and 
modification time. Dead end? I'd check into Matt Clay's /dev/null 
suggestions.

And what about the time (I think within the last 6months) that a group
cracked the MS network and possibly got some source code....possibly
edited some source code.  How would us users know if we had trojan'd code
as a result.  We can't see the source to look for security flaws...and
backdoors.  I think if we wanted to stoop to the level of FUD that we have
plenty of ammo...but just because we can, doesn't mean we should.  Let

Do you or any of your fellow PLUGgers know how a spammer could harvest
e-mail addressees right off my server? I have a couple addresses I set up a
while ago but have never used or published, yet some spammers seem to have
discovered them. Can they actually read the /etc/passwd file to get lists of
users? How else (assuming I haven't been totally hacked) could they get this
info? Or are these just lucky guesses? How can I tell them there's no one
really there and that they are wasting their valuable time?

Could it be that they were just guessing?  Seems like they will try just
about anything.  If they were about find out about the mail server (I
don't think that would be so hard) they could then just go down a list of
commonly used user names...

Or can they actually harvest from a server?

Does that box run an SMTP server?  It is possible to get a list of names
from Sendmail if you set it up fairly loose,  I think it is EXPN or another
of those commands,  that will expand guesses to the full address.

To list the commands you can telnet to port 25 and type help

My Postfix server won't EXPN or even list commands,  so I can't give you
exact info but it's something to check for.

Amongst many others things, he wrote a very cool paper:

  <http://research.sun.com/features/tenyears/volcd/papers/14Steele.pdf>

which I found so interesting I showed it to my wife, who, skimming
through it, casually found a bug which I subsequently reported to him.
Not sure if this copy has the fix or not.

Despite that minor flaw, this guy (Guy? ;-) generates _Quality_.

That would be okay if we just wanted to talk about C.  Steele is

That's pretty much what I'm saying... with the small exception that
"commercial activity" isn't just selling, it's also promotional use and a
few other kinds of activity.

And that's not even a fringe sort of belief.  David Boies, the attorney
that prosecuted Microsoft in the famous anti-trust case, used exactly this
argument in his published brief in defense of Napster, Inc.  This argument
(and the further counter-charge of "copyright abuse" with its only remedy
of the revocation of ALL copyrights claimed by the abuser) is what scared
BMG into buying Napster and dropping suit instead of just suing them into
bankruptcy.  Until new legislation is passed to make the publishing
industry's claims true, that argument cannot be allowed to be heard in
open court by a potentially objective judge.  (The Kaplans of the world
are another matter.)

Now, I personally believe that the true faults in our copyright law as
enforced lies in the court's failure to reject the relatively recent
portions of copyright law that cover non-scientific works.  Congress
simply does not have the power to restrict the rights of the people in
that way.

It would be simpler to just use "lsof", wouldn't it?

Weird!

When I run it under strace, then it returns the right output and I
don't get the errors about /dev/null.

And I don't see anything going on that's too weird in the strace
output.

And now, perl -V is working fine by itself.

Subject: [PLUG] Local resources for finding Linux/Unix/OS jobs?
Message-ID: <20020801144325.718a749a.eli.stair.lists@attbi.com>

I've been looking for work in Portland for about 2 weeks now, and am 
not having much luck finding the job I'm looking for.  There seems to be
a dearth of typical IT jobs in the local papers as well as on Monster, Dice
etc.  Are there any local (or internet) resources that anyone knows about
that are a little more specialized, or may offer more UNIX type jobs? I'm tired 
of seeing things like "Active Directory", "Exchange Server" (makes my blood run 
cold), and other such lunacy.  I'm looking for a more diverse envinronment, 
maybe with some M$ stuff, but not a full-on cult!

Having just gone through a full run of interviews at one employer, being told 
"You're our primary candidate", "We're really looking forward to working with you", 
"we're excited about the diversity of your skills" (my favorite), I've been sidelined
for someone cheaper and less experienced.  I was actually told during the first 
interview __"We're looking for another administrator, as {name} can't be here all 
the time to reset the servers when they crash."__ 

Any ideas on better places to look?  I know that the number of M$ admins who are 
unemployed right now is staggering, but how about in the UNIX sector?

Thanks for any ideas or recommendations.

Cheers,

/eli

You aren't by chance working on a system that does user authentication 
against an NIS map are you?

I've noticed in the past that one of the symptoms of a machine being 
unable to successfully bind to its nis server is that programs will 
run correctly under strace but not by themselves. Wierd.

It's always worth keeping an eye on OHSU's IT jobs page:

  http://www.ohsu.edu/hr/tech.htm

OHSU has a fairly large, 300-person IT group, so new job postings crop
up with some regularity. Lots of Novell and Windows stuff, but some
Unix-ish stuff too.

Nope, this machine does:

MySQL
Jabber
Postfix
Apache/mod_perl
SSH
Proftpd

What gets me is the variability (doesn't work now it does), which makes
me think kernel, CPUs or memory, or hacked-ness.

The short response to your question is: if you find a better place to look,
will you share it with the rest of us?

The longer, & less flippant answer, if that the reason you can't find IT
jobs here is that there is a great shortage of them. I've heard the
opinion that while the general unemployment rate here is 7.5%, in the high
tech sector, it's closer to 25%. (And from the responses in a Linux
Networking class I took in July, I'd say this is a pretty close guess.)
The usual employers -- Intel, HP, IBM, Tektronix -- all have a hiring
freeze or are laying people off. And the other employers who announce
to the general public that they have a job open will get upwards of a
hundred resumes.

On the plus side, the Department of Transportation is hiring people to
man the metal detectors at PDX. (And the Coos Bay & Klamath Falls airports.)
Pay starts at 26K/year. I won't be surprised if a lot of ex-techies with
exhausted unemployment benefits end up working there.

There are many ways to harvent addresses, as other have mentioned,
however they also do try common names. My domains get many spams
to users that don't exist and never have existed. Occasionally,
I see a system connect and send spam to 20 or 30 common first 
names.

I had a spammer start with a at infotects.com and go to zzzz at infotects.com
before I reported it. What a huge waste of bandwidth!

Mike,

  Are there header_checks in postfix that can detect and reject unwanted
names? For example, I get a lot of spam to "undisclosed-recipients"@... and
I'd like to block that. Alternatively, if there's a place to put the few
usernames that are actually available, that would be great, too.

Thanks,

Rich

I've been told that there are a lot of underqualified people out there

that's why the high tech unemployment rate is so high.  Time to hit

legitimate mail (some from the PLUG list, others from other mail lists, and

  Would anyone be willing to take a look at this file to see what there

Please tell me you're joking. The problem is capital. Bad investments,
lots of debt and corporate theft. I didn't cause any of that because I

a google search on "syntax error at /dev/null" shows that
it's a question in the mod_perl FAQ.  the answer is not
very helpful though.

I can't duplicate your problem exactly, but if I
  chmod 600 /dev/null
then perl -V sez
  Can't open perl script "/dev/null": Permission denied

which makes me suspect that your /dev/null is no longer a
device, it's now an ordinary file.

I tried doing that a couple ways, but I still can't
duplicate your error, possibly because I have a different
version of perl or different perl modules installed.

if /dev/null is a file, then the problem will be evanescent
because many things will write to /dev/null, so any program
that relies on /dev/null having null input will have
unpredictable behavior.

The answer mentioned everywhere:
    sudo echo >/dev/null
is not going to fix any underlying problem.  So the person
who wrote the answer is either being dumb or is fucking
around.  If you do find that your problem was that /dev/null
was an ordinary file, please write the FAQ maintainer and
have the answer fixed.

Hi Jon,

Thanks for your response

Thanks.  I solve the problem now.

Yes, you are correct.  Linux is not Windows.  Occasionally I am compelled to 
reboot if I am not aware of the command for detecting the change, 
particularly X-window

Yes, in most time I use Xconfigurator.  In rare occasion I will use plain text 
editor to make a small change

"linuxconf" is not running in my RH7.3 box.  I just download  

"linuxconf-1.28r1-1.i386.rpm".  

It is for RH7.0  I fail to find it from Redhat website.  I have no idea 
whether it is the latest version.   Have you got any idea ???

I made frequent search on google and freshmeat.net.  Sometime either the links 
there are broken or the technical information are already out off date.  
Therefore I join many lists.  Everyday I read more than 100 postings and 
sumarize some of them which I consider maybe useful to me in future.

I came from Windows without any reference book on Linux.  I rely on postings 
as well as technical documents searched from Internet.  Some of them are 
quite useful.  Occasionally I drill into obsolete papers

Thanks

I think education is excellent and that everyone could use some more...but
with schools like the CS dept at OSU a lot of underqualified people still
get their degrees, and go contribute to that 25%.  I'm talking about
students that after graduation struggle to write a simple client/server
program, don't realize that C programs need a main(), the list goes on,
but I think you see my point.  I mean really, some of them are terrible.
Not terrible people, but just terrible with technology.  And yet for some
reason they get a degree in it.

I don't know if we should hold their educators responsible or the
students, but sometimes I wish for the sake of the skilled people that it
was a bit harder to get a degree.  And yes, I realize that sometimes it's
the worst students who provide the biggest contributions in the "real
world".

Has anyone else had expierence with similar?  Perhaps in a non-technical
field?

Just interviewed for a job where Windows (and Novell) and the thing.  
Hoping I get the job and then as the bugs and exploits build up I present 
the not-Windows solution.  Door, window, chimney, crawl space.  Once in 
look out.
   And no I'm really not a Windows guys.  I left a very good job with the 
Government several years ago when they started replacing the IBM 
X-Terminals with Windows 95 PCs that required a pile of other software 
just to get the functionality they had with the X-Terminals.  I just 
couldn't see myself explaining BSOD, Ctrl-Alt-Del, and the difference 
between the C: drive and the NFS mount when a user couldn't access their 
personal Word processing files, they had saved using the Windows 
default settings, while working at a remote location.

Hiring someone that is underqualified (knowningly or otherwise) is a bad
investment.  If the employees are qualified investing in them will on the
average pay off a lot better than hiring employees who are underqualified.
Perhaps it wasn't only the techies that need to hit the books.  I think
Karl's statement also applies to the consumers and the management for
example.

You didn't cause corporate theft, or debt, but you may have indirectly
contributed to bad investments.  Since you didn't have a CS degree you
were a gamble I'm guessing.  And I bet you were a pay off.  But I'm
willing to bet that on average, non-degree people doing what you do
(whatever that may be) don't pay off.  The fact that you and some others
did pay off sent a message that hiring "underqualified" people is ok, and
can pay off.

Not meant as a personal attack, just trying to illustrate that it is all
connected.  It's an economy... And when I say "underqualified" I mean in
the sense that you don't have a degree, I'm not implying that you don't
know your stuff.  I'm sure you're very competent.

Funny thing is, most of the people I've talked to that have gotten into 
IT or other such technical jobs, do NOT have a degree in CS, but rather 
Business, Psych, etc.  Provided they actually have a degree at all - I'd 
say it's 50/50, since the stuff you learn to get your degree is pretty 
outdated by the time you get into the job market.  ;)

I don't have a degree, but I've been tested to have a 4-year degree 
grasp of concepts, vocabulary, etc.  I just don't have that peice of 
paper and a $40k school loan.

I'm sure that there are some sectors of the high-tech employment 
market where what you say is at least arguably true.

OTOH, in my field -- system administration -- there seem to me to be
relatively few folks academically trained in computer science or
engineering. Of the dozen or so sysadmins who've been my colleagues
since I moved here to Oregon, only one has had a CS degree.

I realize the plural of "anecdote" isn't "data," but similar 
discussions here on PLUG lead me to believe that other IT folks come 
from similarly dissimilar backgrounds.

I'd guess it's no different in other industries where there's a real 
distinction between design and implementation:

* how many automotive engineers are you likely to find in the local 
  repair garage?

* how many structural engineers or architects do you find wielding 
  tools on construction sites?

* how many trained mathematicians work as accountants?

There seems to be a continuum in each of these fields, just as in 
computers:

  Theoretical Research <-> Engineering <-> Construction/Maintenance

As you move further to the right you are on that continuum, the less 
you'll encounter formal academic training and the more you'll find 
people trained on the job.

Frankly, I have a feeling that has nothing to do with the quality (or 
lack thereof) of our educational system, and almost everything to do 
with the people drawn to those fields and the sort of tasks they do.

Just look at how indifferent many (perhaps most) sysadmins are to
getting formal certification. Having an MSCE is almost a joke. Why?
Because you'd rather have a sysadmin with loads of on-the-job
experience than some guy with a newly minted certificate.

Here are some problems a sysadmin might encounter in any given day:

* a machine is stuck at the boot loader and won't go further
* the CEO complains that application X causes application Y to crash
* a new mail server needs to be brought online
* Jim Bob in accounting lost a file
* the network is dropping a larger-than-normal percentage of packets
* OpenSSL needs patching on a variety of machines :-(

Speaking as a person with two (non-CS) Master's degrees, and meaning
absolutely no disrespect to academic CS departments, let me ask you:
Have your classes taught you how to deal with these things? Would you 
want them to?

Actually, with 24 users on a server all running KDE, Konqueror,
OpenOffice, and whatever else, I'm not surprised that I'm exceeding the
currently set limit of 26208.  Run "lsof | wc -l" on your box and you'll
be surprised at the number of "open files" you have.
I'll take Karl's advice and increase the file-max value and see if that
fixes the problem.
Thanks,

I know that HP offers several at their Mt. View Education Center.

I also took Compaq's ASE Proliant Linux course in Cupertino if you want to go that route. The linux material was really basic and pretty much involved installing Compaq agents etc.

Well, I use sendmail and I don't know anything about postfix. Sendmail
does reject the messages I'm talking about of course, since there are
no such users. I personally use procmail to bounce mail that I
suspect of being spam, such as mail to "undisclosed-recipients".
What I do is require the sender to send me one reply before I'll
look at "suspect" mail. So far, a spam mailing system has never
replied, although I suppose it's possible.

This has essentially eliminated spam as a problem for me, although
I suppose there might be a few confused souls out there who can't
send me mail because they don't undertand the bounce message
saying that they have to "hit the reply key"

Message-ID: <2632.216.99.218.67.1028267520.squirrel@sautez.dhs.org>

Hello.

I seem to be full of all sorts of complicated issues as of late about
routes and network topology and how to route things.  So here is another.
I have Nortel VPN software that my company has me use to connect to our
network.  I have this on my winXP box. I must use this software as we have
changed the VPN stuff at work and that is what is supported.  Native win
VPN is not going to work they say.
What I would like to do is route different apps on the win box to go to
different gateways.  I haven't found a solution to that yet but have been
giving the suggestion to put the vpn on the linux box and have linux do
the routing by domains.
Does anyone know how I could acheive this?  Where I need to start to look?
 What my limitation will be?
Thanks again for the info.

Josh

P.S.  I solved the internal to external dual domain by only allowing
certain services and remapping different ports for those that they need. 
Thanks for that help.

In only one interview has my university education even been mentioned
and that was only b/c my school ( Va Tech) had just gotten clobbered in
the national championship game the day previous. Employers seem far more
interested in my experience than anything else. 

Regarding Linux in the workplace.When I started working at my current

My last (and only so far) paid computer-related job was obtained by knowing 
the right person at the right time.  My degree is in Film/Video Production 
and they wanted a Linux person to hold developer's hands.  Went through the 
three interviews and was hired.  I was able to do everything they expected 
and then some--everyone's happy.

One day I was working in the software/hardware lab writing a monsterous bash 
build script and a new college graduate (EE) was troubleshooting a new piece 
of hardware.  He didn't know how to use a multimeter.  I could tell because 
it was beeping in a way that indicated that he was trying to measure 
continuity (Ohm scale) on a live circuit.  Didn't know how to solder either.

He may have had more theory than I, but to hand someone an EE degree without 
those practical skills is criminal.

As Paul alluded to, the disconnect between formal education and usefullness 
is nothing new.  Problem is, everyone knows this, but it never changes.

BTW if you want to make films, you don't need a freaking four year degree.

In summary, it comes down to karma, plain and simple.  I'm letting my next 
job find me.

Cheers,

You're right.  Xconfigurator won't let you do everything you might want to

Don't use linuxconf it is evil.  Red Hat finally realized this and stopped 
including it.  You can do most networking adjustments by running `neat` as 
root.

You're on the right track.  I don't subscribe to very many groups, but rely 
on google heavily.  Yes, sometimes you hit a lot of dead ends, but usually 
if you change your search keywords, you'll find what you are looking for. 
Although I have be thwarted from time to time, that's when I ask PLUG.

And while not always the quick answer, finding the "obsolete papers" can be 
a lot of fun, or at least deepens your knowlege a bit.

 No, this is a problem with how PINE handles MIME messages, usually with
metamail or whatever is set up to handle MIME messages on your machine.  
The way to handle this is save, not export since PINE tries to help with
metamail to remove the formatting, it to a empty mail folder and use
insert it into a composed message use the ^R read file option. 
 There also may be a way to change the metamail option in the PINE
config section, but I haven't looked. These days I use procmail to separate
MIME attachments and other junk into separate files that I will check with
midnight commander to see if I'm interested in them.
 I long ago gave up sending spam notices to ISP's. The ISP gets thousands of
notices about spam already and you are just adding on to the pile of 
notices they get from the Internet spam cops. /dev/null works wonders
in procmail.

In the second half of the 90's, due to the demand for capable people, many
folks were pulled into jobs they were not qualified for. I remember
demanding to speak to a supervisor more than once because of this effect.

With the collapse of the tech sector, & the concurrent recession, people
lost their jobs not from their own mistakes or actions, but due to causes
beyond their control. Capable people are struggling to find work, while
incompetent people are warming chairs & drawing salaries -- all due to
the luck of the draw.

I really wish there was a magic solution that would fix this dislocation,
because I would apply it to my own condition. Blame it on being under-
qualified, on rapacious corporate executives, on the ying & the yang being
out of balance: if there was one clear cause, then I could act
accordingly.

I look in the newspapers & online I can't find jobs. People I talk to
are out of work & looking, too. It takes money to train yourself,
even if it reading books (they have to be obtained) or tinkering with
new hardware (they have to be bought). I could take on debt in pursuit
of these goals, but it's frightening to owe money when there's no money
coming in. I wish I had saved more money when times were flush, but
looking back, I was busy paying bills & paying off debt; I could have
lived like Ebeneezer Scrooge, but there comes a time when I allow myself
to enjoy the money I have earned.

When I look to what I should do next, deciding between my choices is
complicated & confusing. Looking back at what I have done, it seems so
obvious & simple. I always thought life would get simpler the older I
became; the older I get, the more I know this to be wrong, but I still
hope that this may eventually be true.

Lucky you, Kyle. I've been hoping my next job will find me as well, but I've
been hoping that since March, so I think it got lost on the way to my house.

My issue is that not only am I getting locked out because I don't have a
degree, I also don't have a certification from MS. Rackafrackin MCSE is
currently the bane of my existence. I wanted off the phone (the bulk of my
experience is technical support), but so far it just ain't happenin.

I don't have anywhere near the experience to become a *nix admin or anything
like that, but I'm also overqualified for most jobs that require you to say
"thank you for calling..." on a regular basis.

If it comes down to karma, I must have been one of the Mongol Hordes back in
the day. (:

Well, that's precisely what puzzles me about this argument. I came from a
farm town of 1700 people. My father is blind and my mother raised my
brothers and I while working full time as a substitute teacher and going
to school part time 2 hours away. So I was poor. Very poor. And I never
really got exposed to computers. Consequently, I didn't get interested in
them until I was in college and by the time I realized I wanted to
program I couldn't switch majors. I didn't have the money (because of
my family situation) to hang out in school long enough to get a CS degree,
so here I am, a computer professional with an English degree. And now I
look around at puzzlement as my colleagues have the gall to tell me I
don't belong, even though I've worked as hard or harder than anyone to get
to this point.

So when you ask if we should make it harder to get degrees, the could
imply one of two things. On one hand, it could imply that degrees should
be more meaningful and that people like me should be given an equal chance
as someone with a degree who might not actually be qualified. On the other
hand, it could imply that we should make getting a degree more difficult,
so that it's SO meaningful that employers will know only to hire those
with a degree, and ignore taking a chance on someone like me.

I say that perhaps those who do the hiring should be accountable. If those
in charge aren't accountable when they lie, aren't accountable for who
they hire, aren't accountable for letting their company go deep into debt
and finally bankruptcy, why do they get paid twice to 400 times as much as
I do? I've worked virtually 60 hours a week for the last 9 years to drag
myself and my family out of poverty and I'm supposed to contemplate my
place in the equation? What about the rich, the people who get paid
hundreds of thousands and millions to make the decisions that cost us our
jobs? When is it their turn to shoulder some of the blame?

You don't want that either. I mean, the paper is nice, but the $40k loan
isn't. My wife and I both grew up poor, so we owe $70k between us.

Same here. I've NEVER had to demonstrate that I even have a degree. I
could be making it up for all they know, because no one has ever asked me.

Yep. I've done that to a certain extent where I work. My company was very
opposed to open-source (mostly because they like the happy feeling of
having someone to call in case of an emergency), but as the recession has
hit and costs have piled up I've convinced them to use CVS, Linux, Squid,
etc. in various scenarios. It's in the door and people are seeing that
it's actually quite useful. I think that's the best scenario right now.
Find a small company that isn't a Microsoft Solution Provider or Partner
or some nonesense like that (I'm sure you've seen those companies, where
there's a Microsoft rep hovering over everyone's shoulder pushing product
24/7) and make the case as opportunities that *legitimately* could benefit
from open-source arise.

Of course. Look at the proliferation of VB programmers, for instance :-).
But that's not THEIR fault and it's not definitely the fault of people
like me who actually have the skills. The employers by and large get paid
big bucks and they're responsible when it's all said and done.

One could argue that the collapse of the tech sector was unnecessary.
Steady growth could have happened. I was arguing vociferously, as far back
as 1996, that the bubble was not based on anything approaching reality and
that it was going to be dangerous for the economy of those fools kept
playing the market like it was a craps table. And I'm fairly certain the
million-dollar CEOs and investment bankers had to know it was a ponzi
scheme too, so you'll have to excuse me if I have a hard time blaming the
poor sap who saw it as an opportunity to pick up a book and make his life
better.

It will never be true. Capitalism may be the best system man has devised
thus far, but it's a pretty crappy system. And unfortunately it rewards
lying and stealing and cheating the system. It rewards laziness in many
cases, as long as you can schmooze and have a bubbly personality. It's
basically a joke. It's not a science by a long shot. My advice is don't
blame yourself, but don't blame the guy warming the chair, because he's
just trying to make a living too.

Hello Linux folks,
One big company management is thinking about developing new 
software product for engineering applications. 
This software should include database, web and desktop interfaces.
There are two possible choices of OS for this product.
Ether they should go with Windoze or make a leap into Linux.
Windoze is less stable and more spendy on license costs and 
cost of additional software for DB and so on and so forth,
The company has commercial support from M$ and their executive
droids more familiar with Windows. 
Money is not a big issue for them in this case.

What arguments other than cost and license fees can be made to
convence
executives to give Linux a try.

Thank you in advance for all thought and conciderations or other
sources of information.

Alex

Oddly enough, that was what I was doing already during the interview process,
with the existing sysadmin (NT). The recommendation that certain 
products in certain applications can be between less expensive and free, 
when compared to similar commercial products from other vendors.  And 
outperform them, on a case by case basis.

This was received with a warm welcome both by the sysadmin and the CIO, both
of whom were interviewing.  But this just goes to show that, as with any 
management, the people in HR are unwilling to base a hiring decision on much
other than 1) outright cost of ownership of the employee (salary), and 2)
the ability to kiss ass and show them who's boss.

So, next time I come across one of those M$ jobs and the interviewing is
going well, I know to lower my going rate.  After all, it pays to be cheap.

The big 3 are Qt, GTK+, and Kylix.

Qt and GTK+ are free, both are very nice. Kylix is expensive, comes with 
rafts of features the other two don't have, especially for the enterprise. 
Kylix has 30-day free trial, and a free edition, but only for GPL apps, not 
for commercial.

Qt and GTK+  run on different compilers, they are sophisticated widget sets. 
Kylix is complete environment. Kylix and Qt provide their own API. GTK+ uses 
X as its API.

Qt is C++, GTK C, Kylix Delphi. One very cool feature of Qt is translating 
apps into other languages, it does this better than any of the others.

All three can do cross-platform, the new magic mantra is "single source 
code". Their respective Websites are probably the best sources of 
information. A Google search for product reviews turns up some decent 
articles.

I did.  ADC Kentrox called the schools and verified all degrees
as standard operating procedure.  My OGI/OGC degree was so new
the call came back as "no, he doesn't have an MS in ESE".  Kentrox
called and said there was a discrepancy, so I had to ask the OGI
Registrar to call and confirm my honesty.  The degree wasn't 
related to the field of work, but the company didn't want to
employ anyone who would lie on their resume.

Bottom Line: It's about *control*, controlling your own future rather
than having it be controlled by some proprietary software vendor.
You get to decide when to upgrade and when not to. You get to decide
what software to include with your product and what to exclude.
You can decide to fix bugs on your own rather than waiting for the vendor 
to get around to it (if they get around to it). You get the option
of enhancing the software any way you see fit without having to go
through the vendor.

FSF would use the word "freedom" here, but the word "control" I think
makes more sense it your particlar context, but they are complimentary
ideas. Open-Source/Free software gives you the freedom to control your
own future. In my mind this comes *way* before cost and licensing.

Lately, at the PLUG meetings I've attended I ask folks if they're working or not
(and if they are working, are they working at Starbuck's ).  It seems to me that
these informal surveys point to an unemployment rate among PLUGers that's
somewhere in the 30% range.  Now, it's possible that if you're not working
you're more likely to show up at a PLUG meeting because you've got the time, so
maybe it's lower, but I'd guess it's at least 15 - 20%. Given the huge loss of
capital in the stock market over the last two years (that continues to this day)
I think it's safe to assume that all the talk of 'recovery' I hear every morning
on the news is mostly propaganda to keep us from more panic selling. [When the
stock market tanked in 1929, how many people knew that it would lead to the
Great Depression?  Not many, it took a year or two for the effects to be felt by
most people.]

Anyway, I don't need to tell you it's pretty bleak out there and it's not
improving.  But that does mean that there are a lot of knowledgable folks out
there with time on their hands.  So, while we're waiting for things to improve
how about setting up some kind of free training cooperative?  People who are
knowledgable in a programming language or technique could train other people who
want to learn that language or technique.  A teacher of one class could be a
student in another.  Given the price of, say for example, those short courses at
OGI, who can afford them at $2K+/3 day course?  A training cooperative could be
a low cost/free alternative.

Then of course the question of 'where' comes up?  Maybe FreeGeek?  They've got
bunches of machines on a network.

..just an idea.

Subject: [PLUG] Transcription of Q/A sessions following PLUG speaker presentations.
Message-ID: <20020802100608.38b87944.eli.stair.lists@attbi.com>

Hello all.

I have a recommendation (RFC if you will) regarding the PLUG meetings where
there is a guest speaker/presentation.  My desire for this comes from the fact
that I wasn't able to stay for the full Q/A banter following the OpenACS
topic last night, was only able to pose one quick question, and didn't get
to hear answers to any that followed.  I wish that there was a way for me to
follow up on that, but am not going to email the presenter asking him to summarize
what went on :)  Also, there may be others who couldn't show up at all, and may
have questions about the topic that are not on the (OpenACS) FAQ.  

Especially when it regards a project that many people may be interested in on 
the surface because of listed features/capabilities/portability/expandability, there 
are lots of driving issues that we have questions about, that specifically will NOT
be on any FAQ, for reasons that the answer may not sound good, or may not have been 
asked in sufficient volume.

This is my proposition:

When a presentation is given, someone has the task of making sure the entirety
is recorded (audio).  Key points made during the presentation are noted, and
significant, if not all, questions and following answers are transcribed to
text.  This could then be either posted to the list following a presentation, or
possibly a section could be added to pdxlinux.org where each presentation given
has its own page with info from the project manager/presenter followed by the
notes taken during the meeting.  


That is the gist of my idea.  If anyone thinks it's bad, let me know.  If this
has been covered before, also let me know.  I'm new to the group so haven't been
around for any previous discussions of this nature.  I would be willing to do the
work of recording/transcribing the meeting, and anything else I'm capable of.

Cheers,

/eli

Reliability - how often do you need to reboot

You can bet your ass they know it's a Ponzi scheme. They don't loan you
their debts ( legal tender) and then ask for Lawful Money at a foreclosure
for no particular reason.

But how many of you realize that when you borrow money or use credit you are
contributing to the eventual collapse of a Ponzi scheme?
That you speed up the process by participating in Usury?
Can you really blame the banksters if you are part of the problem?

There is a better system,  it's called the Constitution of the United States
of America.
It was not capitalist and usury was not included in the social contract - it
was outlawed.

Please keep that in mind when you criticize the USA, because a lot of good
people are buried here who died fighting for a nation of law,  not of men.
For the first 140 years in this country,  a loaf of bread was the exact same
price,  two full generations.
There is a REASON for that.
It is time everyone understood why that is.
Perhaps if they did we wouldn't be in this current mess where the house of
cards is falling down hard.

 My advice is don't
> blame yourself, but don't blame the guy warming the chair, because he's
> just trying to make a living too.

Blame ignorance and not making a stand for the truth and for the law of the
land?
For participating in an unjust Ponzi scheme and not educating yourselves?
For not doing what's right but for looking the other way when lawmakers are
lawbreakers?
How many of you have the courage?
If you don't, aren't you getting what you deserve? What you agreed to?
What our parent's agreed to when they let Richard Nixon take away a silver
backing from your money without a peep?
Let's be honest,  shall we?

And those of you paying off mortgages,  how many of you are aware that only
the holder in due course can have an action against you if you default on
your loan? And that the holder in due course of that note is virtually NEVER
the bank you borrowed from?
And that you can pay off a loan with "like kind of money" by the
Constitutional common law?  Why is that important?
The bank loaned you nothing of real value, ( my deposits are not their
asset,  but their debt) yet would love to foreclose and own the land and the
house.
If you find yourself unable to pay off that mortgage,  do what's fair.  Give
the bank an IOU for the full amount of the note.
After all,  that's all they loaned you.   Nothing more.

And you can bet your sweet ass they know it full well.

Happy job hunting everyone.

Terry,

  I agree completely. One way to frame this for executives is in terms of
risk management. Using open source software they can manage and reduce their
fiscal risk, liability risk and any other risk with which they are
concerned.

The most important one of all (at least in my buying decisions it is)
-- stability.  When your product crashes, regardless of the reason, it
reflects badly on your company.  Customers don't want to know that it's
because of the MS product the platform was based on, they simply want it
to work!  If it crashes, they will blame your company, not MS, and when it
comes time to buy similar products again, they will be more likely to
look elsewhere if stability has been a problem.

This is by far the best idea I have seen on this list in weeks!

I am completely and totally in.  I know quite a bit of perl, php, and
have worked (not currently of course) as a web programmer for years
now.  

Like you said, I need to get more training but have not had the money.

I would be glad to teach some perl or help organize the coop.  I have
also been involved in coop so I have experience there.

... all my class-based computer education is either (a) programming
courses taken in the course of getting the engineering degrees,
(b) post-graduate PCC or OGI courses to learn/sharpen new skill sets,
or (c) technical training courses (e.g. Cisco ACRC) or conference

No university/college course I have taken has touched on these subjects.
(The Cisco ACRC course did talk about 'dropped packets'.)

Things that would be nice to have in a "sysadmin degree".  (Lab time
required!)

 * How systems boot up -- a multi-platform view.  There are fundamental
   similarities, and myriad technical differences.  I was fortunate 
   enough to begin with early MS-DOS systems -- you either had a valid
   boot sector and set of system files, or you didn't.  Sun hardware 
   is pretty straight-forward too.  Don't know much about Macs.  Intel
   hardware can be a real joy with the current mix of operating systems
   available:  Unix-like [LILO, grub, whatever BSD uses, Solaris], 
   Windows NT/2000/XP, Windows 95/98/Me (which will toast existing
   partitions if you're not careful during installation).  Booting from
   a network ...
   
   TTBOMK, all systems start execution at some predefined ROM location.
   It's what happens next that get's interesting.

 * Bring a new mail server on-line.  Can you say basic education on
   SPAM prevention (i.e. "no open relays"!)?  Directory management.  
   Lists.  Privacy issues.

 * Jim Bob lost a file.  Basic backup/restore principles and a survey
   of available. 

 * Network problems.  
    - required:  IP on ethernet LAN
       * fundamental wiring:  CAT ratings, IEEE standards, test equipment,
         stranded vs. solid core, building code issues (plenums), cross-over
         cables, grounding
       * Hubs/switches:  MAC addresses, 'managed' vs 'unmanaged', securing
         managed devices, the "repeater-rule", bridges and spanning tree
         (802.1d), VLAN configuration
       * IP:  addressing (network, host, netmask), network classes and
         'private' address blocks, ARP
       * basic network service protocols:  DHCP/BOOTP, NTP, DNS ...
       * routing:  "default route" is sufficient for most configurations,
         router discovery protocols, how does a host decide to ARP for the
         destination IP or the router?  [Survey of route exchange protocols
         (RIP, RIP2, OSPF, IGRP/EIGRP, BGP) and hands-on routing would be an
         advanced course.]

 * Patches.  Change/configuration (and sanity) management.  Available tools.  

 * Installations -- how to automate, and keep consistent.  (It will help with
   those future patching problems.)

 * User account practices.  Legal ramifications.  Working with HR departments.

 * The CEO -- well people skills are just constant practice.

 * Application troubleshooting ... tech support forums ....


... and I could spend a *lot* more time, but it would be best if I got back
to work here.  :-)

By the same token, I'd rather the men who perform the labor required

upgrade three machines from RH 6.2 to 7.3.

  Yes, I've done the upgrades since 4.0, and every major release (except 4.2
--> 5.0) caused something to break. When these boxes are down I have no
access to the 'Net so I can't ask for help. And, I have a hearing next
Wednesday so I need to be sure all my reports are done. Ergo, someone who
really knows Red Hat well, and can guide me to fixing anything that breaks
during the upgrade, would be appreciated.

  Off-list contact, please!

Thanks,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] How to explain benefits of Linux for corporate droids?

If you have to convince executives, speak their language: money. Give them
information in dollars and cents. Every time the server goes down, it's down
for approximately 15 minutes. During that time, there is zero productivity
in the company. Given that weekly payroll (if you can get that number) is X,
then every time we have to bring the server back up it costs us Y in lost
manhours. Total that up over the course of a typical month where we have to
bring the server up once a week, and you'll see that running windows costs
us Z each month, above and beyond the costs of licensing and hardware
upgrades.
(keep in mind I'm guessing here)

Now consider the new licensing MS is pushing, this 'software as service'
model. They want you to sign a three year contract which does not guarantee
that you will ever see so much as a security patch from them. Are you really
willing to pay them <some exorbitant sum> on spec?

We have another option: Linux. Look here <show them some sort of nice window
manager that makes everything pretty and easy to find>. This is Linux. We
can open Word documents, we can crunch number in excel spreadsheets, we can
create presentations, we can get email and view web pages, and we can
<something specific to the company here>. Not to mention that this system
will also run the <name the new sw for engineering apps here>. This
operating system is free. Fixes come out regularly. There are many resources
on the internet to help find answers to issues, so there is no need to call
someone. And if you need a real live person to assist you, there's probably
someone in the Portland Linux Users Group who has useful information or even
the fix itself. (ok, so I'm going a bit overboard here)

So there you go. With a bit of company related research you should be able
to convince them. I've seen more than one person wet their pants at the
sight of MacOS X since it's unix guts but it's really pretty and does all
the stuff people want a 'real' computer to do (office/photoshop/games).

Hope this helps,

[ Hopefully, this thread will remain locatable in our search engine... ]

Will someone please post reply containing a breif "HOWTO" for
reconfiguring the networking, first by using a text editor (call it
"editor"), then through the provided GUI interface(s) for Red Hat like
systems?


On a Debian GNU system, you edit "/etc/network/interfaces".  At the
top of the file, you'll find a comment pointing to the man pages:

  man interfaces
  man ifup

The file format is very simple and somewhat self explanatory.  For a
DHCP connection that should come up automaticly at boot, you write:

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

That's it.  Now (as root) "ifup eth0" should bring up the interface
and launch the DHCP client.  "ifup" and "ifdown" read the "interfaces"
file, and use the information provided to run the low level commands
that configure the interface (ifconfig) and set up the routing table
(route, or ip route).

For a static IP interface, you'd write something like:

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
	address   192.168.0.1
	network   192.168.0.0
	broadcast 192.168.0.255
	netmask   255.255.255.0
        gateway   192.168.0.254

Your other option, again, on a Debian GNU system, is to "aptitude
install etherconf", and let it's debconf driven interface walk you
through configuration.  You can run it again with "dpkg-reconfigure
-plow etherconf".  (man dpkg-reconfigure) If you also install the
"configlets", you'll find a network configuration GUI in the Gnome
control center.

Agreed. I'm down and I still have a job. But I'd love to spend a few hours
a week helping and learning. I'm studying for possibly taking the LPI
tests in the future.

I think that "lsof" is showing not only open files, but also open
network connections...  It seems to me that they are relevant also
though, since when you write a program, you work with a file handle
for a socket just as for a file.  All I/O is done through file
handles; it's a generic interface.

If you access:

http://www.pdxlinux.org/doc/kernel-doc-2.4.18/Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt.gz

... and read that, you'll know a lot more about it.

I think echo > /dev/null is only supposed to test /dev/null, not fix
it, in order to fix it, you have to delete and recreate the device,
according to this recipe:

  rm /dev/null
  mknod /dev/null c 1 3

I was just about to pipe in on the "jobs" thread that when you're stuck 
between jobs, check out volunteer opportunities. FREE GEEK, PLUG, K-12 
Linux, and Personal Telco all come to mind as opportunities for people 
to get hands on experience. Here's a suggestion for folks between jobs:

* Figure out how much time you can commit to a volunteer group (on, say, 
a weekly basis). Leave enough time to (a) enjoy your time off, and (b) 
continue your job hunt.

* Contact a group (like those listed above) and offer your services.

* Talk with someone at the group. Explain what you know, what you'd like 
to learn, and what you kind of already know, but need experience in.

* Think about what kind of a project would both look good on your 
resume, and help said organization.

* Sketch out a time line for that project and offer to do it for the 
organization. Make certain that you'll be motivated to do it without the 
incentive of a paycheck.

* Make a backup plan for the organization in case you actually get a job 
mid project.

* Do the project, do it well. Document it. Show other volunteers what 
you did.

* Get a letter of recomendation from the group. Put the reference and 
the work on your resume.

This is a great way to get some hands on experience, plus help out the 
cause.

Another opportunity is to take what you already know and teach it. Think 
about being a speaker for PLUG (regular meetings or advanced topics), or 
coming down to FREE GEEK and offering to teach a class of some sort. 
(Talk to Laurel if you come down.)

FREE GEEK is what I know best, since I work there, so the following 
applies to FG, but can be adapted to other groups as well.

We've been talking about doing a series of seminars that, taken as a 
whole, would form a basis for understanding a broader aspect of system 
administration. For instance on the theme of networking, there could be 
seminars on:

* Boolean logic and binary math (needed for understanding how netmasks work)

* How do IPs work?

* What are the seven layers in the OSI Network Model and what are they for?

* How does DNS work?

* How does DHCP work?

* What about encryption and authentication? A security overview?

* Etc...

Anyone wanting to teach this sort of thing ought to come by FREE GEEK, 
open (currently) noon to eight Tuesday through Saturday, and find out 
how they can help.

Right now, FG has a lot going on, so we need self directed people to 
come in and make this kind of thing happen. There's also a not 
insurmountable, but nevertheless real, scheduling problem given that a 
lot is going on at FG.

Anyway, my point is: if you're stuck between jobs make the most of that 
time. Hunker down and do something you want to do. That's got to be 
better (in at least some ways) than ending up with a job you don't like 
anyway.

I know how you feel. Hell I have a degree in computer science and up 
until the end of March I had been continuously employed as a software 
developer for the last 15 years. Now I don't see any prospects and 
things look pretty hopeless for me at this point. It's not like I 
haven't kept up with the changes either having done C++ and Java for a 
quite a few years now. I've been doing mostly Unix work for most of 
that time but now I'm starting to consider getting into Windows 
programming as their appears to be a number of jobs wanting C++ 
experience with Windows. 

Also .NET skills seem to be highly desirable so I may look at that as 
well. I can't say I really enjoy doing Windows development but I need 
to be able to pay the bills. The other side of the coin is that many 
places want web developers which is something I have never been given 
the chance to do much with since I always got put on the back-end 
server and DB stuff because of my strong Unix background. I got to do 
quite a bit of Java work with CORBA and JDBC because of that. About the 
closest I got to web development was one job I did where we used JSP 
and Java Servlets but now the Java landscape has changed greatly with 
J2EE. I've seen quite a few jobs wanting J2EE but I haven't been able 
to get my foot in the door yet.

In looking at J2EE it's a dream come true to finally have some standard 
APIs for distrubuted systems. Certainly CORBA helped here on past 
projects I worked on too. I've worked on a number of distrubuted 
systems before distributed transaction frameworks and other cool stuff 
existed and so a lot of time was spent building company brewed 
distributed infrastructures for projects. Sometimes this was done with 
simple socket programming sometimes more complex message type 
frameworks were built for this purpose. 

Now the tools are there so it's possible to spend time solving the task 
at hand rather than have to build up the infrastructure first. 
Unfortunately no employers seem to expect to have someone fully trained 
and and so not much if any consideration is give to a resume unless all 
required job skills appear on it. Back before the dot.com bubble 
started to fill I never found in any job I got that I was expected to 
know everything. Yes I had solid Unix and C/C++ development skills and 
all but it was assumed that for some of the other stuff that a 
developer would pick it up as required. Along with my Unix experience I 
became pretty good at programming on Tandem NonStop systems when I 
worked at a place where some parts of the distributed system ran on 
Tandem NonStop systems.

At least with Linux I can play with this some of this stuff for free and 
so lately I've been working with Servlets and JSP again on my own using 
Jakarta-Tomcat. 

Here's hoping for better times (soon),

Tony

I finally understand why Microsoft seems to think Palladium is a good
idea: they'll finally be on par with Unix in that you can do everything
your computer is able to do from Windows, but they're getting there in a
typically Microsoftian fashion; rather than increasing the functionality
and usability of Windows, they're reducing the functionality of your
computer to better match that of Windows.  Silly me, this isn't about
copyrights at all, it's about getting Windows to use the computer to the
fullest extent possible!!!

I think this is a great idea. I've been in a couple of meetings where a
transcription was made and they were very helpful later on. These would
be great for those who can't make it to the meeting.

There are some technical points of which to be aware. My wife
transcribes interviews captured on audio tape. If you've never done it
before you might be surprised that it turns out to be non-trivial to get
a recording that can be transcribed. Good microphones and their proper
placement are critical. The preferred medium is standard cassette as
opposed to mini cassette. It usually takes my wife 4 hours of typing to
transcribe 1 hour of audio, and that's at 85-95 words per minute. She
uses a special transcription tape player that has foot pedals for
forward and reverse. The playback speed on the machine is adjustable to
deal with low battery situations on the recording machine. There is also
a built-in backspace feature. When you're listening and typing sometimes
you need to stop listening to let your fingers catch up. When you start
listening again, the machine backs up an adjustable amount so you hear
the tail end of the part you just heard. That way you don't miss
something.

BTW, this is not a plug for the use of my wife's services, just some
observations from someone who does it for hire.

Ha!  I laugh at your puny number of open files!  BWAA!!  HAA!!  HAAAAA!!
:-)  My desktop here at work currently has 10896 open files.  But, of

  When grouping alternative headers in a procmail recipe, are they

Rich,

Take a look at the ^TO_ and ^TO shortcuts, detailed in the 
procmailrc(5) man page. My hunch is that you're trying to reinvent 
that wheel :-)

For any application "foo," you can

* get a list of man pages

  rpm -ql $(rpm -qf $(which foo)) | grep /man/

* get a list of all documentation files

  rpm -qd $(rpm -qf $(which foo))

I love subshells :-)

Message-ID: <200208022353.g72NrG7m012452@franka.aracnet.com>

Last week there was some discussion about the Sharp Zaurus.
Someone said they saw them at Best Buy for $310 and at Fry's for $330.

I tried Best Buy and they say they're out of them - the story I got there is
that a new model is coming out and they're waiting for that one to become
available before they stock it again.  I called Fry's and they have them for
$449 (too much) but currently they only have a demo model.


Anybody know of anyplace selling these for a decent price?

The big 3 are Qt, GTK+, and Kylix.

Qt and GTK+ are free, both are very nice. Kylix is expensive, comes with 
rafts of features the other two don't have, especially for the enterprise. 
Kylix has 30-day free trial, and a free edition, but only for GPL apps, not 
for commercial.

Qt and GTK+  run on different compilers, they are sophisticated widget sets. 
Kylix is complete environment. Kylix and Qt provide their own API. GTK+ uses 
X as its API.

Qt is C++, GTK C, Kylix Delphi. One very cool feature of Qt is translating 
apps into other languages, it does this better than any of the others.

All three can do cross-platform, the new magic mantra is "single source 
code". Their respective Websites are probably the best sources of 
information. A Google search for product reviews turns up some decent 
articles.

One thing that it took me a while to realize; the postfix header check 
matches are case insensitive.  They are also regular expressions; watch out
for '.', etc. characters.

`spamfilter'? I don't see *any* link to "spamfilter". Did you mean
`junkfilter'? Both the "read the README file" and "Download the current
release" links just worked for me. http://www.zer0.org/junkfilter/ redirects
to http://www.zer0.org/junkfilter/ and the README and download links are...

http://www.zer0.org/junkfilter/pkg/current/README
http://www.zer0.org/junkfilter/pkg/junkfilter.tar.gz

Of course, since I've started using spamassassin, I've no use for
junkfilter (although you may learn something by looking at the recipes).

IMO, the best resources are Infinite Ink's tutorial, Jari Aalto's tips
collection, and the `procmail' Mailing List Archives.

Sandy,

  Yup: junkfilter. I didn't see the links before because they aren't the
usual (bright blue) link color in mozilla. They're camoflaged for some

They are a pain under any OS.  In fact Linux is usually easier (but not
easy) to get stable with those products than other O$'s.

Don't believe everything those guys tell you. The real reason according
to the guys from Sharp on the Z message board was that BestBuy only
signed a contract for a limited quantity and chose not to renew. The new
model is the A300 and is only available in Japan with no US plans as of
yet. Also, it is missing the keyboard which is a huge disadvantage.
(that plus i don't read Japanese)

Amazon has them for $378 if you don't mind mail order which seems to be the best price around.
The Best price price was due to them deciding not to carry them so if
they are gone, you are out of luck I think.
I do highly recommend the unit and i think it is easy to get $400 of use
out of it.

No, and that's why I decided to save my money and just get a palm.  I love
linux...but I just couldn't afford the linux pda's.  The older palms you
can get for about $100+shipping.  I got the m130 from pcnation.com for
$225 after shipping.  Pretty nice and it does color.  It just doesn't run
linux.  If you can find one that runs linux in that price range power to
you.

Just because it doesn't run linux doesn't mean that you will be locked
into "their" software.  The palm developer's platform is free for
download.  So you can write your own programs or find them on freshmeat.

I hope that helps,
Jason

When times are bad, everyone will have trouble finding work,
over-qualified, under-qualified, or perfect matches.  Companies stop
hiring completely in times like this unless they have a funded project
that absolutely requires they bring someone new on board.  Just like
everyone else, they are afraid of the economic situation and will hold on
to as much cash as possible until they feel more confident in the economy.
It's like a giant game of musical chairs, and those of us who were left
standing when the music stops, lose (at least for the time being).
Evenutally a new game will start, and thats when you need to be ready,
because the first jobs will go to the best qualified and/or those who are
willing to work cheapest, so now is the time to pad the resume with
anything you can.  Self-study courses online, books can be obtained from
libraries (University libraries in particular) and friends, volunteer
work, giving presentations to your local Linux User Group :-) and if you
can afford it, course work at local Universities.  All of these things can
be valuable, some of them will help your resume, some will simply help
your skill set, but either way, they can help you land a job, not just
from the added skills, but also from getting out and meeting people who
might have need of your skills at their day job.

Actually, I think it is on the up swing (at least for what I do), the
search agents I use on the job boards have gone from no matches for weeks
at a stretch, to an average of at least one possible match each day.  Now
many of these are ridiculous (BSCS + 2 years min. exp., Masters preferred,

I am interested, though there might be some logistical problems given that
I live in Lebanon.  I even have some teaching experience.  Anyone want to
learn low level programming -- embedded systems, C, assembly, machine
code, ones and zeros.  In the old days, sometimes we didn't have any
zeros, so we had to program using only ones, and we felt lucky that we had
the ones,  . . .   :-)

Subject: [PLUG] Odd ping response behavior from private IP addresses
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.33.0208022145060.12184-100000@lukem.com>

I noticed something odd today.  There are several private IP addresses
that I'm able to ping from my home cable Internet connection, but the
responses come back from valid public IP addresses for two other cable
Internet users (I'm assuming they're users), but with "Time to live
exceeded" messages.

So for example, I can ping 172.16.1.5 and I'll get:

>From xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx icmp_seq=1 Time to live exceeded
>From xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx icmp_seq=2 Time to live exceeded

And pinging 172.16.1.6 will give me a different public IP:

>From yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy icmp_seq=1 Time to live exceeded
>From yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy icmp_seq=2 Time to live exceeded

Pinging other random private IP addresses results in responses from one of
these two computers.  I'm behind a firewall doing NAT for an internal
192.168.1.0/24 network, so the 172.16.x.x addresses shouldn't respond at
all (in theory).
Any ideas what's going on here?  Does someone on the cable network outside
my firewall have their boxes/routers misconfigured to answer for these
addresses?
Thanks,
~M

Yes, I'm sure it does skew the numbers....  But considering there are lots
of folks out there who are under-employed or temporarily employed (I'm in
that situation and I'll probably be back in the unemployed column in a
month or two, though I do plan to become a student by then, so maybe it
doesn't count:) I still suspect the numbers are at least near 20%.

Perhaps, but as you note, the wages are quite a bit lower now...

I was surprised to hear from a former co-worker today (a very good,
extremely fast, highly experienced C/C++ programmer) who told me that he
had been layed off this morning... but I suppose I shouldn't be surprised
at this point.

Well, the other logistical problem is again, where do you hold such
classes... anyone got any ideas?  I don't think it could all happen at
FreeGeek given their space and scheduling constraints.  Anyone know of any
abondoned offices out there full of networking equipment and computers
that nobody is using anymore?  ;-)

It may be that the cable network has devices on it that are using 
private IPs or something. I've had on occasion IPs from 10.x.x.x/8 hit 
my firewall. I have my firewall setup to silently drop all incoming 
packets from private IPs as listed in RFC1918. I'm also careful to make 
sure my firewall will not route any private IPs to the outside network 
as well.

I think you are misunderstanding what is going on here, the "time to live
exceeded" means that the packets were being routed, but weren't able to
reach their destination within the maximum number of hops that were
specified by your computer when the packets were created (quite likely
because there is no such destination), sometimes, depending on how the
routers are (mis)configured, your packet may simply play ping-pong among
the routers until the TTL is exceeded and a response is generated back to
you.  As far as anyone being misconfigured, I think that you are
forgetting that you are on a private network (your ISP's), so they can
legitimately assign use and route packets for these IP blocks anywhere on
their network, they simply should not be forwarding these packets to the
internet at large.

I am not interested in all the theory about why those of us are
unemployed are unemployed (or will be soon) rather I would like to act
and help make this idea a reality...... that being said.

Perhaps PSU or PCC would be willing to offer us some space if we were
willing to take responsibility and not use any of their personnel.  If
we conducted our business at a time when their equipment and space is
under-utilized, they might be happy to help.

Just an idea.....

Hello!

I will probably get a lot of flack from this, but here is a thought that
works in another industry. There is surely a lot of tallent out there,
everyone has a computer (in this list at least) and knows how to hook
them together - so what would be the matter with forming a group and
getting some work and doing it. I am not in the computer industry, I am
a cabinet maker I have made a living from it for over 30 years, and in
times like these there is an opportunity. The problem becomes how do you
take advantage of it, how do you see it, and how do you develop it. With
all the talent out there there should be a project (s) that needs to be
done, there has to be a way to get paid to do it. I do not know the
industry well enought to be able to give a firm direction, but there has
to be one - how about the gov't and doing something with security or
some project that someone in Washington wants to see worked on. 

Now I hear that people want to get learning under their belts so they
can work for someone else, this is a good thing, but it seems to me that
you are all competing against each other for the same work, education is
a good thing but there is time to make some bucks. How about doing this
together - as a group.

Ok now you can start a long list of messages calling me everything you
want, but I see this as an oportunity - I am just not in a position to
do anything but build cabinets and furniture for you guys once you get
rich enought to afford it. 
  Food for at least a comment,

Dale

Although free geek could hold some classes, perhaps can we use space

Hi Folks,

It is my interest to follow this thread.  Although to push Linux overtaking 
the market share of Windoz is not my mission , it is always my pleasure to 
introduce this OS to my acquaintance.

Windoz has been existing for a prolonged time prior to Linux giving its 
birth.  If I am wrong please correct me.  Windoz OS has already been deep 
rooted in most people's mind which is not easy to erase.

I have been living/jumping between Linux and Windoz worlds.  This is not my 
wish but under compulsion of necessity.  I want to migrate to Linux 
completely.  Pushing Linux to business we have to breakthrough two 
hurdles,  A) Adminstration and  B) Technology.  I shall explain in seriatim 
hereinunder their details according to my the then experience.

A) Adminstration
To convince the decision-maker (executive) to consider switching to Linux 
OS is almost a miracle, if not completely impossible.  Most people are 
reluctant to learn, dislike us, the Linux folks, possessing of exploring 
character.  He may only possess some basic know-how on Linux.  There are 
two uncertainties laid before him.  a) Can I catch up this new 
technology???  b) Can my technology absorbed thereafter be on top of other 
staffs maintaining a higher potential???.  He is worrying his position 
insecure on turning to a new world.  He needs to stay in his position 
firmly until retire without much struggling.  Another obstacle comes from 
staffs.  They hold the same attitude as the decision-make.  They want to 
stay in their job peacefully enjoying their life, only performing 9 to 5 
routine duty.  The resistance created by the decision-make reinforced by 
their staffs is not easy to overcome, even the boss.  If we try to convince 
them from cash angle they won't listen to you.  Reality in life plays the 
most important role.

B) Technology
Most applications run on Windoz.  I am not talking about Office, PhotoShop, 
Internet browser, email, etc.  We have plenty substitutes in Linux 
world.  Most, if not 100%, CAD applications for Architect, Mechanical 
Engineering, Chemical Engineering, graphics development, etc. could not run 
on Linux, even the compilers.  They are designed to run on Windoz.  VMware, 
Win4Lin, Crossover, Wine, etc. can't help.  Besides it does not bear much 
sense to pay double licenses, one to Windoz and another to those simulator 
developers, because they need Windoz to run on them except Wine.  Why not 
go back to Windoz PC ?  Wine is a wonderful tool but unfortunately still 
under development.

The above are my observation drawn from my past experience.  I don't repel 
other folks' opinion.  But I do hope that some folks on the list can shed 
me some light how to overcome such barriers which I encounter periodically.

Gotcha.  So, I'm assuming that one box has a route setup for 172.16.1.5,
for example, that points to the other box, but the other box has the same
route pointing back to the first box?

This really isn't correct, from the user perspective, Linux is really just
another version of UNIX, which predates the first release of Windows by
almost 15 years, and predates the first version of Windows that the public
actually heard of (version 3.0) by almost 20 years.  It's true that the
"Linux" implementation of UNIX came later, but only a couple years after
Windows 3.0 was released.

The reality of life in the hi-tech world is that change is the only
constant, no one can afford to simply sit and wait for retirement while
not bothering to learn anything new, unless they want to retire alot
earlier than they were planning.  Unless these people keep learning, and
regularly make the best possible technical choices for their companies,
(regardless of what products they would like to use or feel comfortable
with) they run the risk of leaving their company behind the competition,
and in business that is usually the begining of the end.  This isn't going
to convince these people to change, the reality is the odds favor their
company falling behind and possibly failing unless/until there is some
employee turnover and new people who are more open to better solutions
come on board.

I am not sure what you mean by can't help, between these environments, you
can run virtually any program ever written for windows.

While you are probably right for people who only run one or two
applications at a time, and for whom word processing is the bulk of
their work, it actually makes far more sense to use the above approaches
such as VMware for any serious power user.  Every version of Windows and
most of it's applications are notoriously unstable, and typically when
anything goes wrong it takes the computer down, losing everything that was
going on at the time.  Though many managers don't realize it, problems
like this can easily waste 10% of a power user's working time.  Each crash
takes down all applications, the user must wait for the reboot, startup
all the applications, recover the lost/damaged files, reenter any lost
data, etc.  By using Linux as the base and something like VMware
(preferably running only one application in each virtual machine), the
computer stays up, and if an application crashes the user can keep right
on working on other applications while the virtual machine is rebooting.
I didn't even address in the above, the case of people running
computationally intensive programs on their computer, many types of
analysis software might take hours to run, and unless the program saves
it's state on a regular basis, when the computer crashes, it must start
over again from the begining, resulting in long delays for the completion
of the program.

It should be noted that the applications you were referencing above,
are the types of programs used primarily by heavy duty scientific and
engineering types, and these are exactly the kind of people and software
packages that are most likely to crash a Windows box and therefore will
have the greatest amount of wasted time.  Coincidentally, these people are
usually among the most expensive people on the payroll, so the added cost
of a license for VMware or other products, really shouldn't even be a
consideration once you look at how much time they will waste from not
using it or similar products/approaches.  Based on my personal experience
with Windows crashes and the time I save using VMware (which I have been
using since before the 1.0 release), I would estimate that it paid for
itself and the time I had to invest in getting it and the virtual machines
setup and configured, in less than one month.  If I hadn't had to spend
time setting up virtual machines and installing Windows on them, I think
it would have paid for itself in less than a week, and this doesn't even
touch on money/time saved by other capabilities that it provides which you
can't do in any other environment.

Based on my experience, for any computer user doing anything more serious
than word processing, it makes MORE sense (both from a time and financial
perspective) to run their Windows software on a Linux platform in some
sort of virtual or emulated environment than it does to run it on a
standard Windows based computer.  Of course if they are only doing word
processing, OpenOffice and Linux are alot cheaper and every bit as stable
as Windows and MS-Word.

NOTE: I am not claiming OpenOffice is stable here, only that it is no less
stable than MS-Word running on Windows.  The last time I used MS-Word
(just over a year ago) it crashed on me four times in two days, despite
the fact that the box had just arrived from Dell with Win 2000, MS Office
XP, and Norton anti-virus preinstalled.  No other software products
were installed on the machine, and only MS-Word was actually running at
the time of each of the crashes.

FWIW.

Possibly, though I think it's more likely they each have a default routing
configuration that in essence says something like: if I don't have a
defined route for a given IP address/block, send it to router "x" in
case it has one.  Router "x" may in turn send it to router "y" and so on
through all the routers in a continuous loop over and over until the TTL
is exceeded.  Of course if there are only two routers, they would just
bounce it back and forth.

Great.  Thank you, Shannon.  I am now more wise in the ways of networks.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.44.0208031155360.24165-100000@eel.ENGR.ORST.EDU>

Hi Pluggers,

I've installed a Creative Labs SB Live soundcard but when I run mplayer or
xmms I still get errors such as "No Audio". The steps I took during
installation were:

1. recompiled kernel with SB Live module (emu10k1)
2. modconf'd SB Live module (success)
3. modprobe'd SB Live module (success)

Does anyone know the next step to take in getting sound support? Any
ideas?

PS:

When I try "cat demo.mp3 > /dev/audio" I get hissing output from the
speakers.

When I reboot, the card is detected correctly:
 Creative EMU10K1 PCI Audio Driver, version 0.18, 10:35:55 Aug  3 2002
 PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 00:0f.0
 emu10k1: EMU10K1 rev 7 model 0x8064 found, IO at 0xe000-0xe01f, IRQ 11
 ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, id: 0x454d:0x4328 (Unknown)
 emu10k1: SBLive! 5.1 card detected

Thanks!

Some more details on my effort to get sound working:

I ran aumixer and turned up the volume.

Speaking into the microphone seems to echo back through the speakers
properly, however when I record my voice through the microphone I only get
static and hissing:

$ dd bs=8k count=4 </dev/audio >sample.au
$ cat sample.au > /dev/audio


Xmms still returns the error "Can't Open Audio" also... Any ideas?

Did you update /etc/modules.conf? E.g.,

  alias sound-slot-0 emu10k1

I'm not sure what other module aliases have to be added...

1.  Is /dev/audio a symlink to something else?

2.  Does your user have write permission to this device?

ps 'cat'ing an mp3 to a device doesn't work for me either, so I don't
think it's something that actually works.

pps. sorry I signed up under plug at magnetinternet.com and I have to get
used to posting to the list using that name.  I already sent twice and got

Now I do - I added myself to the audio line under /etc/group and it
works great now. Thanks!

I think what Richard is proposing would be overkill for what we need.
If someone were to take notes on the Q&A at the end of meetings -- something
we supposedly learn to do in college -- & publish those, that would be
sufficient. After all, the accounts of the philosopher Wittgenstein's
lectures were recorded by people who were not trained professionals
like Richard's wife.

David Mandel used to keep & publish minutes for the PLUG meetings back
in 1995-97. Something like this is easily doable, & could be published
on the website. I do have an example online of this on the PLUG web site --

Hello plug,

My server that is running RedHat version 6.1 does not have the program on
it that will get you the hostid . It says command not found. I have
done a search for it but it does not seam to be on the server. The man
page is not on the server ether. Is there someplace that I can download it.
Or is there another command that will get me the same info that hostid
does. gethostid is not on the server ether

"hostid" is one of the GNU shell utilities. On Debian it is available in
the shellutils package. On RH it is available in the sh-utils rpm, for
example at:

http://at.rpmfind.net/opsys/linux/RPM/sh-utils.html

It doesn't seem likely this utility would be missing though...

Two questions for the list's hardware hackers:

When I boot up, my dvd/cdrom drive yields this error:

hdd: no response (status = 0x80), resetting drive
hdd: no response (status = 0x80)

Also pressing the "eject" button on the drive doesn't do anything, yet the
light on the drive is on, indicating power. When I boot into Windows,
the drive isn't recognized either. Any ideas whats wrong with
this DVD drive? I just bought it at Fry's a few months ago...

Also one of my fans sometimes starts making a buzzing racket. When you
strike it forcefully it stops buzzing, but this gets old after a while.
Are there any permanent measures that can be taken to hush up this fan?

Thanks,

Tyler

Hello Tyler,
That is what I thought but it is not on the server. The server is a Sun
Cobalt Raq3. When they made these servers they modified a lot of things
on them. They are not like a regular RedHat Linux server

Have you checked all the cables.  Resetting them may
help.  Though the non-eject symptom doesn't bode well.

Sounds like something is brushing up against the fan.
Perhaps a DVD cable?  If it's something that is brushing
against the fan, easy to fix.  If not, it may mean a
bearing is going which means the fan should be replaced.
 They're easy to fix and you don't need to buy an entire
replacement power supply.

If the drive is seen by the bios, but it won't eject even before an OS takes
over, it's toast.  That error message is for your primary IDE HD though, 0x80.

If it stops when you whack it, it's probably your case fan.  If you're handy
with a soldering iron you could buy a new one for ~$3 and replace it yourself.
Or, buy a new PS for ~$15-30 depending on type and wattage.  Do yourself a 
favor and fix it somehow before it stops altogether and you flame out :)

So, your over at a buddy's place on a Saturday night having a few brews and
pizza, when he asks you about Linux.

You pull out a CD, insert it into HIS computer and within two minutes he's
jivin' to some tunes and exploring the KDE3 desktop - dazzled by all the eye
candy! You leave him the CD, of course, so he can explore Open Office 1.01,
GIMP 1.2, Bluefish, Mozilla, Python, WINE, and lots more. And the next day
he's bragging 'cause he's running Linux, too!

What Knoppix is, is a Linux distro that runs entirely from the CD and a file
system created on a RAM disk nothing is put on the hard drive nor is the
installed OS disturbed at all.

This isn't new, of course, but what makes Knoppix different is that it is a
lot faster that SuSE LiveEval and much more modern than DemoLinux.

Lots and lots of current packages (over 900) lets you explore KOfiice, Open
Office, OCR software, scanners and digital cameras, development languages
like Python and KDevelop, too. Even if you run another distro now you can
explore some packages you before actullay installing them on your computer -
maybe Karbon 14 (vector graphics) or Scribus (DTP).

Knoppix is internationalized, too. Click the flag on the right side of the
panel to switch the keyboard from English to German to French!

And with lots of eye candy (less that a second after booting there's a
graphic) it dazzles!

Knoppix is useful for checking out the hardware before installing a distro
that has less thorough hardware detection.

Anyway, I think you get the picture. Knoppix is what I'm using to show off
Linux at its best!

You can find Knoppix at http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/ . There is a link at
the top of the page to the English language page, if you must. <g>

Come to think of it, after having re-read your problem, and my own response...
Check to see if you possibly have both your IDE hard disk and your IDE DVD drive
on the same cable, and both set to master.

Generally if that happens, nothing will work, but depending on the hard drive
it will sometimes take over and bump off the other device.  Just something
to check while you're in there.

I can see the audio recording fidelity becoming a problem for sure. If that
were solved, I think I could handle the transcription part.

They are strongly tied to the K-12 community as they are bankrolled via
OPEN (Oregon Public Education Network), i.e. Oregon Dept. of Education.
Their ability to lend out space/equipment may therefore be limited to that
arena. Their rules re: distributing equipment is certainly strict in that
regard.

I've been reading ,"Homeland Insecurity" by Charles C. Mann in the
September issue of the Atlantic magazine. He quotes much of of Bruce
Schneier's work from Schneier's books and his Crypto-Gram newsletter.
Enlightening, and darkly humorous as the antics of our government and
corporate security wardens are assessed. 
 An interesting sidebar speaks to insurance companies and their current
and future roles in forcing security on corporate if not government
activities, much the same way that I've read of the insurance industry
forcing environmental protection as its losses mount due to climate
change and cleanup bills mount.

I was getting about 2160kbps from this one:
ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/knoppix/

Very cool distro, by the way.  Everyone should check it out to easily demo
Linux to their friends (or to run Linux on a computer that normally has to
run Windows for whatever reason).  Just wait until Jeff has finished
downloading it first.  ;-)

I plan on mirroring this ISO as soon as I get one.  And it looks like my

Hi all,

I read a post a while ago about someone running Novell Directory 
Services on Linux, and now I'm considering doing the same. Does anyone 
here know of any good sources for information, gotchas, and resources 
for doing this? The person responsible for managing the users and shares 
on the current box will have to make the transition as well. Is there 
and administrative interface that is similar to the one that comes with 
Novell?

Thanks,

I just quit using Windows and that was that.  What are these problems
you have that require M$ stuff.  I also hate to mention it, there are
products that allow one to run M$ apps on Linux.  I think they are nice
parlor tricks, but I have no need for them.  

If the admin tools get any easier in linux any Click and Drool Fool
could admin it.  Do I really want a Click and Drool Fool adminning my
machines?   No. It is my experience that badly adminned M$ servers are
the biggest part of M$s problems.  They have a bunch of somewhat trained
monkeys adminning the servers of the world.  How many M$ Certified
admins have I heard say after 6 months of Linux fun say'  "Darn, I know
more about tcp/ip than I ever would have learned in M$."

I want admins that know the underlying system, not which button turns on
dhcp.

It would be way cool if there were a way to do the whole fileserver
thing with Netware client software.  Netware servers rock, IMHO.  But
they're a bit too spendy for me to dink around with on my HLAN.

Rob,  I forget if 4.10 has NDS but I have a 4 user version,  I believe it
was free from Novell.

I bet you can get the latest just as easily,  like $10 or so,  from Novell.

The "golden app" that I'm looking for, is a replacement for Quicken/MS 
Money. I've tried GNU Cash, and a couple of others. GNU Cash comes closest, 
but no cigar... yet.

The features I *NEED* in a personal financial application that aren't 
available yet in anything that runs under Linux are:

1> Prints wallet checks. These are the standard, three to a page checks 
that work with both Quicken and MS Money. I looked at the check printing in 
the latest GNU Cash. There wasn't any way to save my settings from session 
to session, and no pre-made template for my most common of check format.

2> Connects to my bank and downloads the current balance and what has 
cleared since the last connection. Sorry folks, viewing the information in 
a web browser and manually comparing that with what I have in GNU Cash just 
doesn't cut it.

It'd also be nice if I could place SimCity and/or The Sims in Linux, but 
those aren't required. I only play them once in a great while.

Anyway, I am just not willing to give up the extra time I have to give up 
when I'm not using MS Money. In this case, Linux would cost me more in lost 
productivity. Yes, Windows is better in this instance, at least for my 
purposes.

Linux is great for my servers, where I literally run them and they just work.

Subject: [PLUG] Those Woody CD's: Some help getting it installed.
Message-ID: <87ofcigqp3.fsf@bittersweet.intra.hegbloom.net>

Don't judge a book by it's cover, folks.

The quickest way to get started is to not install any device drivers
at all during the installation.  You pretty much just keep pressing
the Enter key.  Don't worry about getting your network up, etc. until
after the initial reboot.  Everything it needs to get the base system
off the CD onto the hard drive is present.  You don't have to do any
device detection at all at this stage.

Be sure and put the CD backin the drive as soon as it is done
rebooting... and after the initial reboot, during "base-config" (which
you can run again later if you like), tell it not to use the "security
patches" site, but jot down the URL so you can add it to
"sources.list" later on... by running "apt-setup" then.  (hint: try
typing "apt" and pushing TAB to see the completion list.)

First thing you do after logging in as "root":

  # apt-get install discover aptitude

That will pull in "discover", the hardware detection program, along
with "aptitude", the wonderful new package manager TUI.  "discover"
should run after it's installed, via "/etc/init.d/discover start".

If you've got a modem and need a PPP connection, and you did not
choose the "dialup system" task, then try running:

  # apt-get install ppp pppconfig

OR

  # apt-get install pppoe pppoeconf

... if you've got cable or DSL using PPPOE rather than bridged mode.
(will someone please jump in if I'm wrong here?  My DSL box is in
bridged mode.)  "diald" is also available, and should be easy to
configure, since it has been debconfiscated quite nicely.

Once you've got a network connection of some kind and have run
"apt-setup" to add the security site and some other extra sources, you
can run "aptitude" and choose what you would like installed.

The apt URI for Openoffice.org is:

# Openoffice.org (mirror at University of Mississippi)
#
deb     http://www.phy.olemiss.edu/openoffice/ testing main contrib
deb-src http://www.phy.olemiss.edu/openoffice/ testing main contrib
deb     http://www.phy.olemiss.edu/openoffice/ unstable main contrib
deb-src http://www.phy.olemiss.edu/openoffice/ unstable main contrib

... and for LTSP it is:

# LTSP -- Linux Terminal Server Project
#
deb http://termserv.berlios.de/debian stable main non-free

You can find Blackdown (Sun) Java at:

# Java from blackdown.org  (Sun Java 2)
#
deb ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/java/debian woody non-free


Don't forget to add the security site as well!

Oh, definitely. I was personally just explaining that I got mnie for $313
by getting Office Depot to match Best Buy. At the time the Beaverton Best
Buy didn't have any units. Salem did, however. So you might try Best Buy
in Salem. I think Fry's was price-matching Best Buy, so that's why their
prices might be back up. Either way it was a steal at $313 and WELL worth
up to $500 IMHO. Easily.

Redhat had to respin the ISOs due to copyright issues in one or more 
packages. The original ISOs have different MD5 checksums.

Personal opinion... Redhat should increment some version indication when 
they do this. It causes much confusion when two different sets of CDs are 
both "Redhat Linux 7.3".

<opinion>
I don't have an answer for this, but it got me to thinking about why I would
choose Linux over Microsoft products if I was building a company. 

The thing I think about when thinking about companies is that they are mostly
able only to travel in one direction. You don't see many companies that have
changed direction survive. It seems that once a company has committed to a
path, there isn't a way to turn back. The only way to change directions is to
stop. If the company doesn't have the resources to get the business moving
again, or has other paths (the company is really multiple companies) in motion
to cover for the stop, then the company dies.

The other thing I think I know about business, is that profitability is about
doing the same thing time and time again in an efficient manner. Thing being
deliver the product or service. Companies that are successful manage to do this
with more than one thing. Companies that can only do this with one thing
survive until the climate changes. I don't think they can really be considered
successful because it is probably only a matter of time before they fail.  

In order to survive the company as to be able to deliver multiple products or
services no matter what the environment is like. As I can't know what tomorrow
will be like, I have to assume that tomorrow will be worse than today and plan
for it. From the two things, I think I know about business, (I make no claim
that these are true), I would want to know that in five maybe ten years, I will
be able to use the same tools then as now, as this may be my only choice. I
base some of opinion this on Y2K. All that money was spent because the
companies with old tools still needed them to work on 1-1-00 and didn't know if
they would. Why they didn't have any other choice is irrelevant

Looking at Microsoft for the last five years, is there any tool that that MS
was making then, that has support now? How about being able to buy a five year
old product?

What is the past five - ten years like? Are those enterprise systems built with
SQL 2.0 still able to do their job or has everything have to have been updated
to SQL2000? Did that call for change the client  / database code? What would
have happened if those times were bad and the company couldn't have upgraded?
What if you couldn't afford to rebuild your enterprise code but you need more
capacity? Say you needed to put up another SQL 3.0 server, how would you if you
can't by it anymore. (I have no clue if you going from one version of MS SQL to
another requires code changes, but I would know if I was in charge of making
those types of decisions). Is MS a dead end if you can't keep paying? Is there
a company that hasn't had to entrench? It seems, from my ignorance, that the
choosing MS products could cost the company dollars, when pennies are precious,
and that would seem unwise choice.

If I gave Linux tools the same test, I think the answer would put me more at
ease than MS. Most of the tools I have seen are posted with all the old
releases. Even now we have gcc 3, GTK 2 and KDE 3 coexisting with their older
siblings. Not to mention being able to boot a generation change in kernels,
Let's see, possibility of a MS 3.1 app working in WIN2000, possibility of a 10
year old app running on my Linux box, I think the answer is in the past.

Way up at the top of this I said a company has to have multiple products or
services to succeed and that profitability is in the efficiency of delivering
those services. So if were talking backend technology the more products you can
support with less backend the more profitable you will be. So I start a
business and I have my first product. the company builds tools to support that
new product and reach the point were it can provide that product the same way,
every time. Now it need it's second product to survive a change that undermines
the first. The chances are that there is some time between the first and second
product, and there are probably new tools available. With MS it seems new and
old can't coexist. Can I run SQL6 and SQL2000 on the same box? The company is
building a new product infrastructure, it  learned from it's last deployment,
and it needs the new features in order maximize the efficiency of the second
product. The MS solution seems like it would need a new physical infrastructure
as part of the new infrastructure. It seems that a Linux solution would
leverage the existing physical infrastructure. This could help keep the cash
flow in balance as the companies expenses are going to go up during this
expansion.

So company now has the base needed to survive. The company has two product
deployments under it's belt, It wants to implement all it's has learned and a
new infrastructure to handle the increasing business. With the MS solution the
company has already spent the second budget allotment for infrastructure so it
doesn't have that option or is required to spend again. With the Linux solution
the company saved, drew interest, and can now spend even more on growth. The
company improves the efficiency of the first product using the new tools and
the acquired knowledge. The new infrastructure provides for the growth of the
current products and  the company now has a platform for a third product. This
seems more efficient as you only spend what is needed, and are in control of
the pace of your technology. The dependency of more boxes for more products
seems to be replaced in Linux by more with less.

More with less is something I haven't heard said in a while but with the new
economy, I'm sure it will come back in fashion.

I believe one of the major features additions from Netware 3.x to 4.x was
NDS. 4.11 _definitely_ has NDS; i'm 99.9% sure that 4.10 does as well.

I've got a three user demo floating around. Mail me off list if you'd like

GTK+ isn't an IDE. The entry on Freshmeat says it all

GTK+
A library for creating graphical user interfaces.

Qt is the same. It, however, does come with  a GUI, Qt Designer
http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/tools.html#designer

Kylix is an IDE, but one of only three? In Linux? Is there anything in Linux
that only has three alternatives. If life were so simple. 

The following are the free ones that mention IDE in the release entry at

Well, they could, but then the new .iso file would be the same as the
old .iso file... or assuming they can find a set of bits that had a
colliding MD5 hash value it would probably burn out as a nice shiny
coaster.

I'm running Mozilla on a Win2k box.. It recently crashed (both mozilla

checking my mail and all my account info seems to have gone missing.

No mail account, no old messages, etc. The only thing that reappeared 
when I re-entered my account info was my aquired addresses. I tried to 
import, but there is no Moz1 option and the communicator4.x didn't find 
anything.

Other symptoms are my homepage reverted back to Mozilla.org. My 
Bookmarks remained intact however.

I'd really appreciate any insights on how to import all my old mail 
back. I was excited about Mozilla being available for "that other OS"  
until a few minutes ago...

FYI, someone stated earlier on this thread that Kylix was Delphi only,
however the new 3.0 version will target C++ as well:

"Borland Software Corp is set to build on an early lead among Linux
developers, with today's expected launch of a C++ rapid application
development (RAD) environment.

Scotts Valley, California-based Borland will announce version 3.0 of its
Kylix RAD environment for C++. Previous versions of Kylix targeted Delphi
programmers on Windows and Linux.

Kylix 3.0 brings RAD to an estimated three million C++ developers on
Linux. Borland is playing in a highly fragmented Linux market, which
provides programmers with an array of open source command-line tools that
largely lack integrated features.

The company hopes Kylix 3.0's integrated, RAD-development environment will
attract those building graphical users interfaces (GUIs), databases and
web services.

"Command-line tools get the job done at a low-level, but these tools have
not been easy to use. You have several console windows open to build and
debug [an application]," said product manager for RAD solutions John Ray
Thomas.""

Hi All Guys,

Is there open source software to monitor the broadband speed?  The story is :

I am subscribing a broadband of 10MB sharing dynamic IP.  From time to time 
the download or browsing speed is quite slow.  My ISP claims that it is 
caused by the traffic of the site I am browsing/downloading.  I expect to 
find a software which can clear my doubt whether the responsibility falls 
on my ISP's shoulder or otherwise because of too many users sharing one 
line at the same time.

I browsed "goolge".  There are many suggestions, spectrum, web monitoring, 
etc.  I am not sure which one shall be appropriate to my application.

Could any guy throw me some light.  Thanks in advance.

I usually take a packet cpature using "tcpdump" (http://www.tcpdump.org)
and run it through "tcptrace"
(http://irg.cs.ohiou.edu/software/tcptrace/tcptrace.html) to get TCP
statistics on retries, throughput, round-trip time, etc.  Unfortunately,
if you don't have a firm grasp on the internals of TCP this low-level
information won't help much.

My favorite book on TCP internals is "Troubleshooting TCP/IP" by Mark
Miller.  I've heard good things about the O'Reilly "Network
Troubleshooting Tools" by Joseph Sloan, but I have not read it.

If you want to take a more "active" role and have a remote server you can
use, check out Netperf (http://www.netperf.org/netperf/NetperfPage.html)/

The quick version from my experience:

Often remote systems get congested.  When this happens you will see TCP
retries start to creep up, as packets get discarded on the back
end.  Sometimes the round trip time is very high as well, but the retries
are what really kills performance.

When your local system gets congested you will notice degraded interactive
performance to remote sites (i.e. telnet/ssh) regardless of which site you
go to.  If this is happening, you probably have a local problem.  If your
interactive response is good, but that stubborn FTP session won't go over
5k/s, odds are it's a remote problem.

Slowness on the initial connection is almost always due to lousy DNS
servers.  Try running your own caching DNS to solve that little problem.  
;-)

Many remote sites won't do more than 10-20k/s.  I see this all the time.  
All that 10Mbit connection does for them is let you wait faster. :-(

Nobody said it was an IDE. It has a command-line interface. Glade is 
available for users who want a graphical environment. Glade is not an IDE, 
but a graphical frontend to GTK. A brief visit to the home pages of any of 
the three mentioned shows a large number of options for each product.

Alex's original question was " ...graphical Linux environments to program 
desktop interfaces or web interfaces in WYSWYG mode. " Which doesn't sound 
like IDE to me. (Some people consider Emacs to be the ultimate IDE.) I could 
be wrong about Alex's intention- I mentioned the three products with 
graphical interfaces that I consider to be the best: the most useful, the 
most mature, the best feature sets, with active development teams behind 
them.

You can find zillions of anything on Freshmeat, if you don't care about 
quality.

Hi Steve,

Thanks for your detail information.

My time does not allow me to penetrate deeply into this subject.  And my 
intention is only to clarify whether the slowness is due to my ISP having 
too many subscribes sharing one line.

I use this ISP's broadband service for more than 1 year.  At the beginning 
the browsing/download speed was quite fast but now the speed is 
questionable.  My ISP pushes the burden to the remote sites.  However I 
have certain reserve whether it is on account of the increase of subscribers.

I only need a simple and easy install software to monitor the speed of the 
broadband connection, if possible, identifying the cause of responsibility.

Anyway lot of thanks for your prompt advice.

Stephen

Stephen,

Are you connecting through a Linksys Router? I have found that my 
broadband cable connection gets real doggy every couple of months. 
When that happens, I reset the router using the reset button on the 
front of the router. Speed goes back to normal automagically. I don't 
know the whys or wherefores unless it has something to do with the 
DHCP lease needing refreshing. 

I suppose that would be the same with any other router setup also.

Hi Ray,

NO, not through a router or cable modem but direct cable connection

One idea, since it seems you're running windows (at least from your
X-Mailer header), make sure you're clean of viruses.  My parents system
was acting the same, and I downloaded and installed Grisoft's AVG
software, and it found 300+ infected files.  It was infected so bad that
explorer.exe was infected, as well as a few other important files.

Hey we all know Windows just slows down after a while, performance
degradation is just a part of the life cycle of a windows box. ;-)  Have
you tried speed tests from another system besides that one?

Does this mean you're using DSL?  In any event, go here.

http://www.dslreports.con/tools and select the "Speed Tests"

I realize you're probably looking for a solution that will continously 
monitor your bandwidth, but the above link is a start.

Cheers,
Kyle Accardi

Hi Matt,

I run Window to receive/dispatch email.  Because I use Direct CD to burn 
important messages on CD-RW which works as a hard disc.  I could not make 
it on Linux box.  For this I struggle for sometimes

IE crashes occasionally.  I only use it for downloading software which I 
burn on CD-RW in udf format.  For web-browsing most time I use Linux 
box.  I run Norton on Window and the virus definition is quite 
up-to-date.  I suspect whether slowness is caused by Virus, not only on Win 
box but also on Netscape running on Linux

I use ATTBI which uses the mail server software Intermail, the problem I 
have is that the ability to keep messages on the server and not have 
fetchmail or pegasus email redownload the same email messages again. 
Is this a problem with the client software or is this a result of the
server configuration?

Keith,

  I'm know nothing about Intermail, but pine and its cohorts can be
configured to either leave messages on the server or delete them _and_ to
download only new messages. Perhaps ATTBI can tell you how to configure
their software,

No, I don't have an answer, but rather another question...

Why would one voluntarily use Novell anymore?

I spent some time in the early 90's administering a Novell network, and 
albeit my experience is quite dated, there's nothing that Novell does 
that Linux couldn't beat hands down.  I'm sure there are a lot of shops 
that have used Novell since the early years, and have too much money 
tied up in them to abandon them to a [near-]free solution...

Just curious.

First of all, Novell is a company, Netware is the product you're questioning
I think.


Novell NDS.  Regardless of your feelings of Big Red Novell Software Boxes,
they do have one of the better directory structures, feating full LDAP
support, and it's "near free" at $1 to $2 a seat.

Novell Zenworks.  Nothing compares to it from the Linux world.

Novell Netware.  Larger enterprise environments, that need a file sharing
system for an "enterprise", not a small LAN.  Samba is great for smaller
environments (I use it at home and at work for non critical tasks), but
there is still much question about how well it scales in larger corporate
environments.

Try dslreports.com.  They have servers connected to the Internet backbone 
that will download files to you and allow you to measure you connection speed 
through your ISP to the Internet backbone.

Try ntop, it's a utility that shows ethernet interface information in a format 
similar to top.  It has some dependencies, libmysqlclient, libdb, possibly 
something else.  Try that, it's easy and shows simply what you're probably
looking for.

Wouldn't that type of thing sort of defeat the purpose of a checksum?

If it's really that easy to spoof a checksum, what's to stop anyone from 
doing that, and why do we trust checksums?

Why didn't the guy that trojaned the openssh source do this to avoid 
detection if it's really that easy?

I disagree - even if you know what you're doing.  Installing and 
uninstalling apps, thrashing the swap file, putting tons of little .ini 
files into the system directory, etc...  All of those muss up your 
system.  And most uninstall programs leave stuff laying around.

Even if you scandisk, defrag and prune your registry regularly, I found 
that after about 3 months of use my 98 gaming system would have to be 
reloaded.  What a PITA

Hmm.

I have taken one hard disk with Windows on it through three different
motherboard upgrades in the past,  used it for 3 years without a problem.

There's a few more tricks to know..  but I don't have the time to go into
that at the moment!
Besides it's a linux list, huh?

I think ease-of-use comes in to play here.  With netware, it is very
simple to set up a fileserver with authenticated logins... the server
install is very quick and easy.  The client install is even better. 
Just add the usernames and you're done... and the client integrates
itself into Windows giving the user a single logon name.

Best of all... it isn't Microsoft.  Sure, it still costs lots of money,
but... IMHO... it is a good product.

Assuming you're in Linux (I know of no always-on type monitors for
Windoze), gkrellm might be a nice thing to get.  It's a very easy
compile and has all sorts of pretty graphics.  It is pretty easy on the
CPU, as well.  After running for 5 days, 17 hours, and 52 minutes, it
has consumed six seconds of CPU time.

It's one of those monitor-everything applications, including a bandwidth
monitor.  Really any other bandwidth monitor would work for you, though.

Just get a monitor of some sort (Freshmeat.net is a good place to look
if you don't want gkrellm) and start as many downloads from as many
places as you possibly can in a short period of time.  If your bandwidth
stays down around 10K/sec... then your ISP has a problem or all the
servers you are downloading from do.

I see you've already gotten a lot more advice... I like DSLReports, as
well.

  Hi Rich,
Well I tried it on Mozilla Email Client and it seems to track which
messages have already been download. I'm thinking that I will need
to change the commands/configuration for fetchmail and for Pegasus I
will have to use the manual method. I no longer use PINE for direct
connect to pop servers since it is so slow, well at least for ATTBI it is.

Well, I was able to fix /dev/null, but the whole thing (as well as other
things that happened) this weekend have made me step back and reconsider
what's going on.

Consider this:

/dev/null went bad
MySQL keeps giving me bad cache results
mod_perl loses output and variables get corrupted
logrorate fails to kill processes so my logs don't get rotated properly

I'm starting to wonder if the new box is having hardware problems.

Does anyone know of Linux bases systems diagnostics software for the
Compaq Proliant line of servers?  If I didn't have to take the machine
down that would be a bonus.

A friend of mine bought one of those "Fry's" DVD drives,  it did the
same thing.  I told him to try putting on a different port (he has an
extra Hotpoint controller), or to change from master to slave (even if
it is the only drive on the cable).  DVD's drives can be _very_ picky,
the best rule of thumb: always have the DVD drive on its own IDE port
(meaning it is the only drive connected to the cable).  Most drives
would rather be slave, but some will only work as master.

A good cleaning may extend it's life, but not by much.  Hold out for a
fan with ball bearings (it will say right on the fan "ball bearing"), if
it is your heatsink fan, it is usually much cheaper to get a new
heatsink and fan than to track down just a fan.  Be very careful if you
open up the power supply, it has hi-voltage capacitors that can pack a
good punch.


Good Luck

Last week, a few of us here opened up a discussion on setting up a

I have been thinking a lot about this, and although I have a whole host
of family committments, I am willing to set a side one night per week
for teaching a class on perl.  

This would be a class for novices as I have never taught before, but I
would like to give it a try.

What I wanted to know was if there was interest.  If enough people
wanted to attend the class -- and were willing to teach or organize a
class themselves -- then I will see about finding a location.

I am hoping that this will get the ball rolling.

Let me know.

Compaq has its own diagnostic utilities, check your docs, or see Compaq's Web 
site. Create the test floppy on a known good machine. I would use vendor 
utilities first. The most dependable results come from testing the hardware 
directly, which means shutting down and booting to the test suite. As goofy 
as your box is behaving, it seems that shutting down is not such a bad thing. 
Probably save time and hassle.

Sometimes buzzing noises are not actually the fan itself, but rather
something that isn't completely locked down inside the system which will
vibrate in synchronization with a harmonic of the fan's vibration.  If you
aren't completely sure it's the fan, you might just go through the system
and make sure all the screws holding everything in place (power supply
motherboard, drives, etc) are all tight.  Even if this is the problem,
tightening things won't always cure it since there may not actually be a
screw where the vibration is occuring

I concur...my cpu fan was making a horrible noise, after I cleaned all 
of the accumulated dirt and crud from it, it was once again silent.  If 
you don't have access to compressed air, try a vacuum cleaner hose 
attachment and some q-tips.  Use the q-tips to loosen the dirt from the 
fans, and the hose to do the obvious.

Hello,
You can re-lubricate your buzzy sleeve or ball bearing CPU or Chassis
fan.
I do it about every two years on my servers.
Just peel off a sticker from the rear side of it and apply a couple of
drops 
of light oil on the spindle.
It'll make it quiet.

This just came in to the PASA (Portland Area Systems Administrators)

who the ISP might be. Just passing it along.

1. Exit Mozilla/Netscape.

2. Symlink the Java plugin into the Netscape plugins directory, e.g.

   cd /usr/lib/netscape/plugins
   ln -s /usr/java/j2re1.4.0/plugin/i386/ns610/libjavaplugin_oji140.so .

3. Restart your browser.

Subject: [PLUG] LyX won't start
Message-ID: <20020805203217.5DD0B2FE87@joseph.doink.com>

I'm trying to run LyX on my Mandrake 8.0 system, displaying
remotely on a Redhat 7.2 system, taking a SSH hop through a
Solaris 2.8 system along the way.  All my other X applications
can run in either direction just fine, so I think my SSH and X
setups are OK.

When I start lyx I get "Segmentation fault" with no core file.
I tried starting lyx with debugging turned on for "info", "init"
and "gui", and I got:

    Setting debug level to 1,2,8
    Debugging `info' (General information)
    Debugging `init' (Program initialisation)
    Debugging `gui' (GUI handling)
    Initializing LyXGUI...
    Segmentation fault

Since I'm running 8 bit color on the display server, I set
"-depth 8" but I get just the same response.  I also tried
"-visual PseudoColor" and "-shared" with the same results.

Any ideas on how to debug this more?

Thanks....

Oh yeah, I'm trying this with lyx version 1.1.6 that came with
Mandrake 8.0 which runs just fine when executed locally on this 
machine.

How about strace?  It may give you more information.

So, obviously there is a need :)

I will try and find a place.

Meanwhile, can everyone who is indeed interested tell me a couple of
things:

1) What level programmer are you?
2) What languages do you know?
3) What skills do you bring to the table?

Subject: [PLUG] rpm installation help, please
Message-ID: <3D4F05C4.18D603C6@attbi.com>

I've downloaded ethereal-0.9.5-2.i386.rpm to my RH 7.1 system. I ran:

  rpm -i ethereal-0.9.5-2.i386.rpm

and get the following error messages:

  error: failed dependencies:
	  libpcap >= 0.6 is needed by ethereal-0.9.5-2
	  net-snmp is needed by ethereal-0.9.5-2
	  libcrypto.so.2   is needed by ethereal-0.9.5-2
	  libpcap.so.o.6.2   is needed by ethereal-0.9.5-2
	  libsnmp.so.5   is needed by ethereal-0.9.5-2

I understand that I need to install or upgrade something related to each
of the above, but I don't know where to start. Is the process the same
for each dependency? I.e., do I find the appropriate rpm for libpcap,
net-snmp, libcrypto.so.2, libpcap.so.o.6.2, and libsnmp.so.5, download
them, and run rpm -i on each of them? If they give me similar messages,
to I keep working through the dependencies until they go away?

If I upgrade the ones that are already installed (how do I tell that?)
will I break something else?

Thanks.

Yeah, it's a strange request...  It's for a magazine article and they want a jpg
of some of my code ("In order to preserve the indentation").  

So, anyone know of any tools that will take a text file and spit out a jpg or gif?

My solution to this problem was debian...seriously though, RedHat is
great, and debian (to me) is greater...You're milage may vary, but if you
like to keep things reasonably up todate, with little headache debian is
good.

That's how I always solved it.  Try sites like rpmfind.net (is that the
right URL?).  You can download all the packages you need to upgrade and
then do them all on one command line, that can help rpm to understand
you're intentions and complain less.

HTH,
Jason

Here is a seven step process.

Find a tool that takes code and generates pdf or postscript.  I can't
remember the names of such programs off the top of my head but google and
freshmeat should know.  a2ps might be your man.

Then load it (as postscript) in the gimp, now save as.

You might even be able to cut out the jpg step and give them the
postscript or pdf file.

Good luck,
Jason

This one looks fatal, I'm not sure, but something about the window
properties is not being passed on correctly.

It looks like all the rest of the failures occurred because of the first
BadWindow problem.

I wasn't going to say it first...  ;)

But to be honest, this is exactly why I also switched to Debian.  Not 
sure if up2date or apt-rpm would solve your problems, however.  You 
might give that a go if you're not willing to change distros.

I don't know of a specific tool, but I'd recommend using gif rather than
jpeg.  Jpeg wasn't intended to compress stuff like this, and will often
give less than optimal results.

Well, my solution was going with Slackware.  :-)

Compiling source tends to work better than installing precompiled
binaries in my experience.

Note that some of the failed dependencies (like libpcap) are packaged in
their own rpm...

[bigfish at kippered bigfish]$ rpm -q libpcap
libpcap-0.6.2-12

...while others (like libcrypto) are part of another package...

[bigfish at kippered bigfish]$ rpm -qf `locate libcrypto.so`
openssl095a-0.9.5a-14
file /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0 is not owned by any package
openssl096-0.9.6-9
file /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.1 is not owned by any package
openssl-devel-0.9.6b-24
openssl-0.9.6b-24
file /lib/libcrypto.so.2 is not owned by any package

...in this case, the openssl rpms. As Jason noted, www.rpmfind.net is the
best bet on finding them - but pay attention to the "Distribution" listed
(you'll want RedHat or RawHide - and note the for <processor>). If you can't
find what you need as an rpm, you'll need to unpack and install the tgz
file. rpmfind.net generally has a link to it as well (shown before the sites
having the rpms).

You should use the -Uv (update, verbose) options rather than the -i option
for upgrading packages (the exception being the kernel itself). You can find
the maxrpm book online at http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/ .

cheers,
Sandy

By the way...  if they'll accept PNG images for the mag article, then
you'll get better quality and a smaller file size than JPG (along with
less licensing muck).

This works as long as "convert" knows you have a text file. It doesn't 
work on a file with a .c extenstion but if you put a .text extension 
"convert" works quite well in this respect.

I found libpcap-0.7.1-2.i386.rpm and successfully installed it. I tried:

rpm -i ethereal-0.9.5-2.i386.rpm

again, and the libpcap error message is gone. One down, four to go.

I found openssl-0.9.6-9.i386.rpm and ran

rpm -Uv openssl-0.9.6-9.i386.rpm

The system responded with:

Preparing packages for installation...
openssl-0.9.6-9

After that, I tried rpm -i net-snmp-5.0.1-5.i386.rpm and got:

error: failed dependencies:
	libcrypto.so.2  is needed by net-snmp-5.0.1-5
	libelf.so.0  is needed by net-snmp-5.0.1-5

If libcrypto.so.2 is in openssl, did I miss something with the upgrade
of openssl?

After upgrading openssl, when I run rpm -q libcrypto.so I still get:

package libcrypto.so is not installed.

  Yup.

  You have three options here, Richard. If you run 'rpm -Fvh ...', you'll
freshen an existing installation, but not install if an earlier version is
not on the system.

  If you run 'rpm -Uvh ...' you'll upgrade an existing installation and
install the new one if there is no earlier one there. Either the 'F' or 'U'
version will replace the existing version on your system.

  OTOH, you can keep multiple versions of a library on your system. If you
want to do this, use 'rpm -ivh ...' and you'll install the new package in
addition to the previous one.

  If you think it's a PITA with 7.1, try upgrading a 6.2 system. :-)

I agree.  I use Slack as well.  It seems people have more trouble with RPM
Hell than just getting the source and installing it.  I think a lot of
people are scared of source (just as some are deathly afraid of compiling
their own kernel).  It's not as hard as it looks.

Unfortunately, the search engine at rpmfind.net does not accept regexp and
is not greedy. I'm realizing (since there are several openssl rpms) you'd
actually probably be better off going to RedHat's site...

http://www.redhat.com/apps/download/

...and doing a "By Keyword" search for openssl to get all related rpms.

You won't discover which rpm contains libcrypto.so.2 by just using the -q
switch. A simple query needs the package name as an argument. e.g.,

[bigfish at kippered bigfish]$ rpm -q openssl-perl
openssl-perl-0.9.6b-24

You need to add the -f switch to find out which rpm carries a given file.
e.g.,

[bigfish at kippered bigfish]$ rpm -qf /bin/cat
textutils-2.0.21-1

Note that you have to fully qualify the file location.  In the case of
libcrypto.so.2, it's a symlink...

[bigfish at kippered bigfish]$ ls -l `locate libcrypto.so.2`
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           19 Jan 22  2002 /lib/libcrypto.so.2
-> libcrypto.so.0.9.6b

...so you'd need to...

[bigfish at kippered bigfish]$ rpm -qf `locate libcrypto.so.0.9.6b`
openssl-0.9.6b-24

It turns out that libelf is packaged in its own rpm...

[bigfish at kippered bigfish]$ rpm -q libelf
libelf-0.7.0-2

I'm beginning to understand why the Debian fans brag about their distro. :)

Good luck,
Sandy

Sandy n Rich, a valiant effort. I hate when someone's idea of help is 
"apt-get- oh you can't? too bad!"  Those Deb packages are built by human 
hands, it doesn't take much of a search to find sad forum posts of Deb users 
having similar problems.

Ethereal is a sterling example of how not to build an RPM. I've been fussing 
with it all afternoon- it's been an interesting education. To heck with the 
damned RPMs. The machines I use it on, it was installed during the original 
Linux installation. I'm going to try building from source and see what 
happens. The libs are on my test system, but not in the RPM database- seems 
like there was a thread on this not too long ago.

Carla,

  I built ethereal from source then was sent a working rpm that's known to
work on a RH 6.2 system. It works just fine.

  When a library is built from source it's not registered in the package
database. If the rpm installation reports that dependency is missing, but
'locate' confirms it's installed, just use the '--nodeps' switch and the
rpm will install and run without complaints or problems.

  If anyone wants a copy of:

/usr1/rpm-packages/ethereal-base-0.9.1-1.i386.rpm
/usr1/rpm-packages/ethereal-gtk+-0.9.1-1.i386.rpm
/usr1/rpm-packages/ethereal-usermode-0.9.1-1.i386.rpm

  I'll be happy to push them your way as attachments; about 2.7M worth of
tools.

Rich

I would really like to see this happen as well. My suggestion would be to
put up a webpage where we can request classes to be taught, and list
classes we would be willing to teach. For example here's my list:

1. Stuff I want to learn:

OO Perl, computational geometry, anything on variant free operating
systems; AtheOS, mach, minix, plan9. Also, I haven't written anything in
html since 1996, it would be nice to take a class on creating a modern
website using php or perl.

2. Stuff I could teach:

Bash Programming
Unified Modelling Language stuff; software models.
Analysis of Algorithms, algorithmics
Cryptography; block ciphers, public key encryption.
Intermediate Lisp, Java, C, Fortran, Python, Perl.

Regarding the classes, location isn't that important provided
there's a chalkboard or display device of some kind. Being next to a
bus/MAX line is nice, too.

I solved the problem by going to a larger cursor, using the "X-Big-Cursor"
mini howto (it's included in Debian, probably some other distributions as
well).  If you prefer to go with the color scheme approach rather than the
big cursor approach, reading this howto may be of some help in creating
your own (though I'm not sure about the color handling).

See the xsetroot manual.  I changed my cursor to red with white outline
with this command:

xsetroot -cursor_name top_left_arrow -fg red -bg white

BUT, it only changes it for the root window, and not ALL applications.  I
know on a few terminal progs you can change the pointer color, etc.  Do
some more research and I'm sure you'll find something.

Everyone (sans apt-get'ers) is right--ethereal is one of the most 
frustrating packages to install/update.  Not sure that building from scratch 
would help much either.  `make` will (or should) fail if you haven't met all 
the dependencies.  There are so many security lib deps and they are being 
updated very often.

If I could find my notes from the last time I did this (using rpms), they'd 
be out of date anyway.  But when you finally do it, your grunt gets a little 
deeper.

I did a good bit of OO Perl a few years back, but I'd consider it
irresponsible to corrupt others with that knowledge ;-)  If you want to do
OO Perl, please consider Ruby as an alternative or wait for Perl6.  I
would be willing to teach another Ruby class in a month or so after I
finish my current contract.  Since you already know Perl you would pick it
up quite easily.  I taught a Ruby class out at FreeGeek in May/June.

I'm actually doing a bit of this now...  What applications of
computational geometry?  I could teach the Scanline algorithm as I'm quite
familiar with it at this point, but the application we're using it for is
probably a lot different than what you have in mind... still the algorithm
itself is the same.

I did some thinking about an ultimately unfunded problem of rapidly
computing distance to nearest surface of a set of arbitrary
scaled/translated geometric primitives (at successive steps of a
random walk).  If anyone has any particular insight into efficient
solutions, I am all ears.

Indeed.  I'd consider helping out on that one.

All of those things are cool.  Some of the things I want to learn include,
debugging techniques, how to read other peoples code, perl, bash
scripting, cryptography, netfilter/iptables, anything security or sysadmin

I'd like to add C++ to that list, make files and LaTeX.  I could also
teach a fair bit about AI and number theory/coding theory.  Or even a
solid intro to Vi and Emacs.  I know a tiny bit about the SDL and I could
help with a class about that.

Ha. Nailed it. Building from source was a breeze. Get a single big tarball at 
ftp://ftp.ethereal.com/pub/ethereal/  Do what INSTALL says. Don't forget to 
'make install' as root. Everything else can be done as an underprivileged 
user.

sheesh!

I need some help with a bash script. I need to read a file and find a
certain line in that file and then add two lines directly after that
line.
example
I need to search the file and find this line. The file is a httpd.conf file
RewriteRule ^/cgi-bin/test/(.+)  proto://servername:81/cgi-bin/test/$1 [L,R]

and then add two lines right below it.

How about something like this:

do
  if expr "$line" '.*/cgi-bin/test/' > /dev/null
  then
    echo $line
    echo "new content line 1"

    echo $line
  fi

In both Red Hat 7.2 and 7.3, /lib/libcrypto.so.2 is a symlink to 
/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.6b, provided by the openssl-0.9.6b-24 rpm.

i'm not terribly sophisticated with this operation,
but, that said:

cat httpd.conf | sed -e 's:[oldline]:[newlines]:'

Oops. There's a minor but fatal syntax error in my 'expr' invocation.  
The loop should read

  while read line
  do
    if expr "$line" : '.*/cgi-bin/test/' > /dev/null
    then 
      echo $line
      echo "new content line 1" 
      echo "new content line 2"
    else
      echo $line 
    fi
  done < httpd.conf

Note that expr's regex engine implicitly anchors all matches to the 
beginning of the line, hence the leading '.*'.

Of course, there are probably two dozen ways to accomplish this same 
thing (awk and perl would be nice tools of choice), but you asked for 
a bash script... :-)

  Some of you may recall that I've been trying to upgrade the firmware on my
HP DeskJet 2500C for several years now, but cannot do it because the only
available executable is for Microsoft.

  I've contacted HP in Boise and Carly Fiorini in California and everyone
agrees there should be a way to do this on a linux system -- and their own
HP-UX OS which now cannot be used to upgrade their printer from their
hardware.

  Recently I've read that Bruce Perens of debian fame is now the Chief Linux
Advocate at HP/Compaq/DEC. I would like to send him an e-mail on this issue
so if anyone has his e-mail address, please send it on to me.

Thanks,

If you are sure the line you're looking for can be uniquely matched by
grep,  you can do something like this:

 x=`grep -n unique_string httpd.conf | cut -f 1 -d ':'`
 head -${x} httpd.conf
 echo "line of stuff"
 echo "second line of stuff"

 x=$((x = x + 1))
 tail +${x} httpd.conf

Subject: [PLUG] Samba server can't see WinME

Hi All Guys,

I have a WinME box connected to a Samba Server (RH7.3) via a crossover 
cable as experiment.  Both boxes can be connected.  WinME can transfer 
files from the share folder of Samba Server and to the folder of the same 
but not the other way round.  Samba Server can't see the WinME box.

Your Samba box thinks IWILL is at 218.188.76.202, and your internal
address can't reach it, that seems like your problem.  Add IWILL to your
/etc/hosts file if it's not already there, and make sure your samba box
checks the hosts file before DNS.  I don't think, from what it looks like,
that it's a Samba issue.

Why don't they name it M$ zombi training program
or M$ button pusher and mouse clicker training program?

No way I'll put my kids in this "program".

Aaarrrgghh, WinMe is a networking nightmare. It doesn't even like to connect 
to other Windows machines.

This may be what you need:

What do you mean by "see" the Win box?

IIRC, the server doesn't look for win shares, only the client does. When I need 
to mount a Win share, I use smbmount.

Use the sed "a" command.  

sed -e '/reg-exp_pattern/a\          # Address/pattern to match, and "a" command
line(s) of\                          # (the backslash after the "a" is req'd.)
new text to\                         # Backslashes are required after all but 
add                                  # the last line of new text.
'                                    # (Don't forget the last single quote mark!)


sed -e '/RewriteRule .*cgi-bin\/test.* proto:\/\/servername:81.*/a\
new_line#1\
new_line#2
'  < httpd.conf


I got a bit lazy on the reg-exp expression for matching -- you can
tighten it if necessary.

Am I reading this wrong, or do you have both your boxes set up with the

Sounds like we should be out there protesting the school's corruption of

You could ask that about a lot of the right handed crap in the world...I
understand that left is a minority, but why does OSU have entire class
rooms that have NO lefthanded desks...is it that hard to make desks
without a bias...or provide 10% left handed...(It's so anoying to have an

Okay, warning..... this email is flame bait :)

My first point is this: I am really tired of how this list diverges into
MicroSoft bashing.  Yes, I do not like MicroSoft, but you know what? 
They are successful.  They became successful.  They just didn't pop out
of thin air.  They had a plan and didn't whine about their opponents,
they went out and the attacked and won.

Linux could learn a thing or two from MicroSoft.  Yes, this point has
been made here before but I make it again with respect to this school
program posting.

You people want to protest, you want to whine.  Did you call up the
school and say: "Glad you have decided to enhance your high tech program
and it is very generous of MicroSoft to help you.  If you would like, I
am sure that we in the Linux community would be happy to help by
providing our services.  We will gladly mentor the kids, come in show
them how to use Linux, show them where we work and what is used in the
real work, etc....."  A great example of this statedgy is what some
folks are doing with the Portland Public Schools.  More power to them.

This is a *nix list, and I see no reason to not bash freely. Especially as 
the majority of the bashing is fact-based. It's classy bashing, it is. Alex's 
comment was especially apt.

the wombat process and try to restart it, I get:

They did this, in large part, by breaking the law. Maybe that's why they
get bashed.... perhaps??

I don't think Linux can strongarm customers, purchase politicians to make
laws that work for them, or buy off diplomats to shill for Linux products
overseas.

Many are already doing that. Some, such as myself, held back for fear of
seeming to "come on to strong" and worry the schools that we didn't have
their best interests at heart. I still want to help, but I think it's
important to help in such a way that it doesn't seeem like you're "using"
the schools as a battleground to fight a skirmish in a larger "war"
against Microsoft. It has to be professional and it has to be conducted
with the interests of the schools put first. I'd still like to help, but I
don't think it's THAT simple when you step back for a moment.

Either way, I'll whine about Microsoft if I want. They broke the law, they
buy legislation and favor and they abuse their monopoly power. I am
supposed to like that? Do I still have to like it when I'm unable to buy
hardware that doesn't work without a DCMA-approved piece of software (i.e.
not free software)? Do I still have to appreciate their business acumen
when they control my access to the Internet, to being able to conduct
business in my day to day life? Part of the responsibility of an
intelligent, informed citizen is to ACT when it is necessary to act and to
dissent when it is necessary to dissent.

Samba Server isn't the program that is going to connect to the Winblowz
box, smbclient will be doing that.

Both machines have the same address?  This must be a typo, otherwise
they couldn't see each other.

There is the problem, your winblowz box thinks it still has the real ip
address, and is telling your RedHat box to connect to it using the real
ip address (SMB doesn't route very well,if at all).  Do you have 2 NIC's
in this box?  Is NetBIOS over TCP turned on for both NIC's?  

You could try using the ip address instead of the computer name:

# smbmount //192.168.0.2/shared /mnt/WinME -o username=stephen

If this works, then adding IWILL 192.168.0.2 to your /etc/hosts file
should straighten out your RedHat box.

So my newbie question is this:

How do you do a screen capture -- you know, make a picture of whatever is on the
screen like one could do in windoze with alt-printscrn (then paste clipboard
into something expecting .bmp)?
 - from KDE ?
 - from GNOME (& which window manager?) ?

Thanks!

A more accurate rendering might say something like

  ...whine about its opponents, Microsoft went out and, using business
  tactics that would

  * eventually lead Federal courts to find it guilty of abusing its 
    operating-system monopoly,

  * so anger its leading OEM resellers that they would testify against 
    Microsoft in court and in the industry press,

  * lead venture capitalists to reject out of hand requests for 
    funding from companies developing application software that might 
    compete on Microsoft's turf, knowing that Microsoft, if 
    interested, would eventually steamroll the market by "bundling"
    those features with Windows, and

  * actively undermine OS-independent standards and protocols 
    codified to *help* computer users rather than a specific computer 
    company,

  attacked and won.

There's no doubt that PLUG is often home to unfair Microsoft bashing, 
but to suggest that Microsoft's success has come largely as the result 
of by-the-rules competition is naive in the extreme.

This is what I am trying to write to the httpd.conf file a little more
elaborate than what I first sead in my e-mail

I keep getting this when I run the script
 sed: -e expression #1, char 233: Unknown command: ``R''
 so I figure that it is reading the first R in the first line I am
 trying to write and interpreting it as a command. Is there a way to
 make it understand that those 6 lines are to be written and not read


sed -e '/RewriteRule .*cgi-bin\/.cobalt.* proto:\/\/servername:81.*/a\

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}                ^([^:]+)

It appears as though you're looking for some way to take a screenshot of
one window.  If you're running GNOME2, then Alt-PrtScreen will work
(under any WM), otherwise the most desktop environment agnostic way of
doing it is with xwd:
$ xwd -out <filename.xwd>

And then convert it to something useful.

All true, but what gets me is that Micro$oft is taking money from the
schools to train IT minions that will be selling their O$'s to the
masses.  How can we convince the schools to pay us to train Linux
minions?  (Not that I want to take money from the schools, but I would
rather see it go to a Linux instructor than to a corporation that won't
even be providing an instructor.  Sure you get a weeks worth of
training, but after that you are on your own, Micro$oft charges for
support too.)

whew, just a little venting.

Yes, in fact I use both in Blackbox WM (as well as fluxbox on a couple
machines).  I just gave 2 examples on what to use in each window manager
because, well GIMP is part of the gnome packages (usually), and ksnapshot
comes with KDE.

I find ksnapshot is easiest and quickest to use.

While looking for a method to convert large text-ish files to tiff I came 
up with this trick.

enscript <file.whatever> -p - | \
    gs -sDEVICE=tiffpack -sOutputFile=file%d.tiff

Or something very much like it.  :-)

With my copy of ghostscript (RHL 7.2) there is pngmono, pnggray, png16, 
png256, png16m, jpeg, jpeggray, and a bunch of others.

Enscript will also do some nifty formating if you want it to depending on 
the input source type: C, SQL, etc.

  Today's Oregonian/Metro East section has a large article on the top of
page 2 reporting that the Gresham charter school (used by Gresham, Reynolds
and two other districts here) are paying Microsoft to establish a technology
center in the school. Students attend their regular school half-time and the
charter school half-time where they are trained as Microserfs to "better
prepare them for the Real World".

  Looks like an opportunity for the linux-in-education Emergency Response
Team to swing into action!

Derek's point is the real direction to go.  He notices how schools are
paying for this.  Is anyone planning on approaching the Gresham school
and offering their services?  I know there are folks with that
experience here, and I would love to see it done.  I will even help if I
can.

The rest of you continue to complain about how terrible M$oft is.  Yes,
yes, yes.  They broke the law and they have questionable business
ethics.  All true.  We need to be better than that, so instead of
continuing with the complaining what does anyone want to do about.  

Sounds like pissing in the wind to me.....

Change from single quote (') to double quote (").  It will
allow for the shell to expand "$A". 

A simple test of the different behavior:
   $ echo '$A'
   $ echo "$A"

Things can get messier though when other shell meta-characters
(e.g. '!', '`', or '\') appear in the double-quoted string.
(You'll become close friends with your back-slash key :-) )

Use double quotes around the string on your sed command line, single
quotes suppress interpretation of the $A and pass it as part of the
string literal.

I changed it to look like this
A=$(uname -n)
sed -e '/ServerName localhost/c\
ServerName "$A"\   #<-I added the double quotes
' < httpd.conf

And this is what it looks like when it writes to the httpd.conf file
ServerName "$A"
It is not filling in the variable with what is in the variable.

You need it around the whole string, replace your single quotes with
double quotes, the problem is the single quotes which supress
interpretation of the contents of the string between them.  In other
words, this:

 sed -e "/ServerName localhost/c\
 ServerName $A\
 " < httpd.conf

I think you need to ditch the backslash after $A (as it's the
last line).

Ok I removed the backslash after $A so it looks like this
A=$(uname -n)
 sed -e "/ServerName localhost/c\
 ServerName $A
 " < httpd.conf

 and I still get the

doh!, I forgot about my shell-meta-character warning earlier.
The backslash is one of them ...

  A=$(uname -n)
  sed -e "/ServerName localhost/c\\
  ServerName $A
  " < httpd.conf


Futhurmore, compare these two (identical results):

  sed -e "/ServerName localhost/c\\
  ServerName $A
  " < httpd.conf

  sed -e "/ServerName localhost/c\\
  ServerName $A" < httpd.conf
  
... to this one:

  sed -e "/ServerName localhost/c\\
  ServerName $A\\
  " < httpd.conf


The latter gives you an extra blank line.

Why not:

A=$(uname -n)
sed -e "s/ServerName localhost/ServerName $A/" < httpd.conf

Notice that you also need an 's' command for sed (before the first slash). 
As given, this will only replace the first instance of "ServerName 
localhost" with "ServerName $A". If you want all instances replaced:

A=$(uname -n)
sed -e "s/ServerName localhost/ServerName $A/g" < httpd.conf

I'm not sure why your redirecting here... You don't need to.

A=$(uname -n)
sed -e "s/ServerName localhost/ServerName $A/" httpd.conf >httpd.conf.new
mv httpd.conf.new httpd.conf

Will do that I think you are wanting.

While Don was sorting this out, it occurred to me to ask what it was you
were trying to do (I had just been looking at it from a Bash perspective)
Wouldn't it be both simpler and cleaner to do this instead:

   sed -e "s/ServerName localhost/ServerName $A/" < httpd.conf

or am I missing something?

Put this line:

xset +fp "/usr/share/xfce/cursors"

in your ~/.xinitrc

  You'll need to shut down X and restart it (not just reload it from the

Hello Russ,

I tried this
A=$(uname -n)
sed -e "s/ServerName localhost/ServerName $A/"httpd.conf > httpd.new
mv httpd.new httpd.conf

But it gave me an error message
sed: -e expression #1, char 57: Unknown option to 's'

this works
A=$(uname -n)
sed -e "/ServerName localhost/c\\
ServerName $A" httpd.conf > httpd.new
mv httpd.new httpd.conf

Count to the 57th character of the sed command, and you find that it's way 
beyond the end of the sed command. It looks like you didn't put a space 
between the closing quote and the filename.

Oh, GREAT choice.  "Alt-SysRq-F1" is how I switch to a Linux console.
You'll note that "PrtScn" and "SysRq" are on the same button.  I hope
they made it rebindable.

Nothing wrong with getting paid to do some work, mind you.  But it
just seems to me that the money ought to be getting spent to pay LOCAL
engineers and educators, rather than getting sent off to another city
into somebody else's pocket.

There's a rather large difference between running an honest business, and 
doing what Microsoft does.

I think it's a great idea to expose students to Microsoft's wares.  
It would also be a nice thing if Linux found it's way into 
dual-booting on those machines.  Then students could see a true 
comparison of both systems and end up being better informed, which is 
after all what school is supposed to be about, no?

No, schools are more and more becoming "consumer preparation" 101. I mean,
that's what we are, right? At least, that's what I'm told 24/7 by the
media. I'm either a consumer or I'm a voter. I'm never what I really am. A
human. A citizen.

Public schools were created to create workers. Nothing more, nothing less.

And as much as this entire thread is off-topic, the sad part is that
this is correct.  The public school system in America is largely based
on that developed in Britain during the industrial revolution which was
not created to educate, but to indocrinate and create a more capable
working class.  This is, of course, all based on my fuzzy memory of my
readings on the subject, but those memories tell me it's at least mostly
correct.  I would, however, love to be corrected.

Hi there, 

I was wondering if I could find an old Toshiba cdrom driver for Linux.I am trying to turn one of our old PC's into a Linux terminal for another machine.The PC used to go bi-booth Linux/windows 3.11.The CD rom is Toshiba XM-3701TM.I can hardly find
anything specific for this drive, not even mention Linux stuff. Could you offer some advice on that?

Best wishes

LOL.  Yeah, I imagine OpenSource as a caped superhero...... Faster than
a speeding windoze machine (well, most things are), able to reboot at a
single bound (not that it needs too).......

I mean come on.  Come down to earth.  Yes, yes, OpenSource is the way to

going to save the world.

Whatever......

Its like the bumper sticker: "death to all fanatics".

On an old system like that, the CD-ROM itself isn't nearly as important
as the controller it is plugged in to.  You need support for *that*.

What model is the Toshiba?  If it is a laptop (they did make desktops
back then, I know) then you can likely find a ton of information about
it and how to get things working at www.linux-laptop.net.  If it's a
desktop, things get a little more complicated.

I don't know how to get info about ISA things on there, and doubt the
controller will be on the PCI bus, if the system even *has* a PCI bus
(Win311 is *old*).  Hopefully somebody else on-list can help.

It looks like the XM-3701 is a SCSI drive.  Is there a SCSI controller 
installed in the machine?  If so, you will just need the appropriate
driver for the SCSI controller.

I understand this can already be solved in O(n) or O(log n) time. What

If they are paying Microsoft to show off their way of doing

Any of you have any contacts in Gresham or know anyone who does?

Many people believe the computer has been given too much significance in
K-12 education generally. When your mind is young it's easier to learn
languages, musical intruments, art, and mathematics, whereas proficiency
in word-processing or using powerpoint can be acquired through experience
at a later age. The latter are highly applied skills that do not
transfer as readily to other domains.

For more thoughts on this, see this interview with Clifford Stoll, author
of "High Tech Heretic":

...

Q: You do say that you are not advocating zero computing for children. How
should computers be used in classrooms, if at all?

CS: It's okay to plunk a kid in front of a computer. Just like it's okay
for kids to watch TV. The problem is that we can see, after a generation
or two, that lots of television tends to be bad for kids, and adults too.
We haven't yet learned the pernicious way in which computers work against
an education. How much computing do we need? My feeling is that up to 12
years old, the answer is close to zero. In high school, teenagers, yeah,
the graduate of a high school ought to know word processing, ought to know
what a spreadsheet does, ought to have a sense of what a data base does,
ought to know how to send and receive e-mail. On the other hand, this
isn't really tough stuff. This is a few weeks worth of instruction. Not
many semesters.

CS: One of the weird things for me is to visit schools in California and
the principal, time and time again, walks up and says: "Let me show you my
wonderful computer lab." There are rows and rows of Apple Macintoshes, and
PCs. My first question is not: How fast are they, or how many are there?
My first question is: What did this computer lab used to be? The answer is
telling: "Oh, this room? It used to be the music studio, but we don't
teach music here anymore." "This computer lab? Oh, this was the art room.
We don't teach art." "This multi-media system? This used to be the
library, but we got rid of the books and installed computers."

My experience is that Intel is hip to Linux, although I'd hope there is a 
better (shorter) url into this good site--thanks for pointing it out.

Q: Is there anyone using a recent version of Mozilla that has the actual url 
in the Location bar at the top?  I'm using 0.9.9 and most of the time it is 
blank--it is really pissing me off.

Heh, I installed RH5.2 on one of Intel's first 8-way Xeon systems.  Then 
I took a bogomips rating and submitted it.  :)

http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/mini/BogoMips-3.html#ss3.15  (near the bottom 
by 3.16)

At least, when I was still working there.  They were pretty open to 
Linux in general 3+ years ago, I can't see that they'd be any less now 
that Linux has gained in popularity.

Power point and word processing, yes.

Programming can be an art, and it's definitely a language that involves 
mathematics using the computer as an instrument, so I'd say it fits all of 
those areas.

All right, I've built many things, but never a web browser.  Usually the Red 
Hat versions work just fine, but the blank location bar and the long-missing 
ALT text for images are enough to make me do it.

 "This paper presents a new generation of attacks against Microsoft Windows,

Microsoft has known about these flaws for some time; when I alerted them to 
this attack, their response was that they do not class it as a flaw - the

Microsoft VP Jim Allchin who stated, under oath, that there were flaws in 
Windows so great that they would threaten national security if the Windows 
source code were to be disclosed. He mentioned Message Queueing, and 
immediately regretted it. However, given the quantity of research currently

Excellent, didn't know that.  While the Location bar now works as it should, 
ALT text is still broken on mousing over an image.

But just getting the one fix makes me happy--needed that today.

Subject: [PLUG] Using "apt-proxy" to minimize Apt's Internet bandwidth useage.
Message-ID: <87y9bjxkqc.fsf@bittersweet.intra.hegbloom.net>

                    <URL:http://apt-proxy.sf.net/>

I've recently discovered the excellent "apt-proxy" program.  (It is
available via "aptitude install apt-proxy".)  It acts as a caching
proxy between the actual software archive out on the Internet and your
internal Debian (or Mac OS-X) systems.  Since "apt-proxy" has been
especially designed for Apt, it's to be preferred over a Squid proxy.
It will duplicate the remote archive's directory structure and create
a local mirror containing the union of the sets of packages installed
on each of your Debian machines.

Once a package is in it's cache, you don't have to wait for it to
download from the Internet again -- your machines can grab it at the
much higher LAN speeds.  You can use the local mirror for CD image
generation also, if you wish.

Here's the relevant parts (abridged) of my
"/etc/apt-proxy/apt-proxy.conf", just for example.

it remains for an example to yourself later on.  "apt" is quite happy

Don't forget to ensure that you do NOT have "Acquire::http::Proxy" set
anywhere in your apt.conf.d, and that you have not only put that
"preferences" file in place, but understand what it does.  The above
configuration will give you a Debian 3.0 (Woody, stable) system by
default, unless you explicitly select packages from "unstable" or
"testing", either interactivly using aptitude or on the command line,
using the "--target-release" option.

The last segment in there is a demonstration of how a local
"shadowing" archive can be set up as preferred over the remote Debian
archive mirror (actually, preferred over your apt-proxy cache, taking
the above configurations verbatim).  Given a locally created archive,
perhaps managed by "debarchiver", and the appropriate line in the
"sources.list" file, you can shadow mainstream packages with custom
builds, or add new ones that are locally prepared.  This is quite the
trouble fix ticket for the busy LAN administrator, isn't it?

Perhaps next time I'll (or one of the other Debian folks will?) talk
more about "apt-build", "apt-source", "debmirror", or "debarchiver".

Some actual info would help.

Initial interface configuration
The commands you used, etc...

The tools you ar using... (ifconfig or ip)


BTW:  alias interfaces were gotten rid of after 2.0.  2.2 and later
feature secondary IPs, for backwards compat each secondary IP supports
the concept of a "label".  When you configure what would have been an
alias interface this is translated into a secondary IP with a label of
what the alias interface would be.

Well it seems one step forward...now when I left click to bookmark a page, 
it doesn't bring up the bookmark list so I can select where the new bookmark 
goes--got used to being specific and it generally kept the bookmark list 
under control.

This is so fuckin' typical with Netscape over the last ten years, it's nice 
to see that Mozilla has foregone regression testing as well.  Features come 
and go, but hopefully they return.  Damn, pass the bong.

Hi Carla,

Thanks for your response.

My problem is only Samba can't see WinME not the other way round.  WinME 
can visit Samba to retrieve files from the shared folder of Samba.  At the 
same time it can also transfer files from WinME box to the aforesaid shared 
folder without problem.

Anyway I will go through the website recommended to see whether there is 
any solution there.

Thanks

Stephen

Help me understand how this is different from rsync'ing a mirror.  I admit I 
don't have a grasp on squid either.  But isn't this just another way to 
maintain a local mirror?

I searched high and low looking for info when I wanted to recompile
Mozilla... I finally got it working with the help of the Slackware-OT
list members.  Specifically Jurgen.  :-)

I got a roughly 50% speed incrase, in launch and general things.  I
don't know how much rendering of HTML sped up, if at all.  This is over
the stock Mozilla binaries distributed with Slackware.

So here's what I did.  For starters, I set up my uuber-optimized CFLAGS,
CXXFLAGS, LIBCFLAGS, and BOOT_CFLAGS...

CXXFLAGS="-O9 -s -mcpu=i686 -march=i686"
LIBCFLAGS=$CXXFLAGS
BOOT_CFLAGS=$CXXFLAGS
CFLAGS="-O9 -s -funroll-loops -ffast-math -mcpu=i686 -march=i686 \
    -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-exceptions -fschedule-insns2 \ 
    -fexpensive-optimizations"

-maligndouble caused it to seg fault during compile, so I disabled that
(which I usually use when I make my super-duper optimized programs).

For the actual config and building, I used the following (stolen
shamelessly from Chris Kassopulo from alt.os.linux.slackware):

./configure --disable-debug --disable-tests --enable-optimize \
    --enable-crypto && make
su
make install

Just make sure you set your compile variables before running
./configure.

Hope this helps somebody, I know the optimizations really sped things up
for me over the plain-jane stuff you get by default.  The launch-time
difference in itself helped a ton.  Be aware, Mozilla is a pretty big
compile.  It requires 2GB of free hard drive space and, depending on
your system, could take a *long* time.  It wasn't as bad as my optimized
KDE compiles, though!

Note; all compiles were done with GCC 2.95.  I don't know if 3.x will be
able to do the same, although I would hope they will.

An rsync would grab all the packages.  If it didn't, you would have to
specify in advance which ones to store on the local server.

If I read the original email correctly, this essentially intercepts
apt-get requests (or debian is told to use your local server for apt-get
stuff, or both maybe like transparent squid proxying [iptables/chains
port redirects]) then checks to see if the packages is stored locally. 
If it is not stored locally, it goes to the Internet and downloads the
package on behalf of the client inside the LAN which can then use the
package.

Once the package has been downloaded once, it is cached locally so if
another client wants the same package, it is downlaoded directly from
the local server instead of going to the Internet again, which is what
you'd do without some sort of proxy/cache.

Squid does the same thing, essentially, but with webpages.  It lets you
cache them locally and with the use of squidguard you can easily filter
things out (like porn and ads).

Which reminds me of something I wanted to ask before... does the K12
LTSP(?) project provide a proxy of some sort?  If so, does it filter? 
Because the Squid/SquidGuard combo with a cron job to automatically
update blacklists ... with squid/squidgard set up for transparent
proxying ... it makes a very effective replacement for expensive
products like NetNanny or CyberPatrol.

Sure.

Yes, it's obviously a way of automaticly maintaining a local mirror.
Squid is a more general purpose caching HTTP proxy.  It is not
specificly designed for the task of proxying and caching for Apt; it's
designed for caching web pages.  Squid has it's own directory layout
for the data that it caches, where "apt-proxy" uses the Debian
ftp-master archive's "package pool" layout, so that the locally cached
.deb's are locate-able by the same path sequence as on the official
Debian archive mirrors.  Squid does have a modular architecture, and
new storage backends can be written for it, but that must be done in
C.

Correct. The advantage of "apt-proxy" over "rsync" or "debmirror" is
that you don't have to decide in advance what packages you want to
cache locally.  You don't have to write an rsync exclude list, or
generate a package set list for debmirror.

"apt-proxy" does not "intercept" the requests, and it does not really
work in the same way as a web page proxy cache like Squid does.  You
don't configure an "Acquire::http::Proxy" for Apt with "apt-proxy".
Instead, you explicitly list it in the "sources.list" file.  It
presently is not designed to work as a transparent proxy.

There are pros and cons with this approach, I suppose... I've not
thought about it enough to go there though.

There are several other Apt proxy cache projects out there.  I am not
certain which one will eventually prevail.  Probably one not even
begun yet that borrows from and refines the best feature set of
several of the others.  The big thing is apt-get install ability.  It
should be easy to make it Just Work with very little setup.  And I do
think it ought to work more like a regular web proxy...

It just occured to me that one advantage of the present "apt-proxy"
approach is that you control where the packages are actually coming
from in one place, at the proxy host, rather than in a zillion
"sources.list" files.  The "sources.list" and "preferences" can be
identical on all of your internal boxes.  You could distributed them
and maintain them using "cfengine", perhaps.

Right!  If you install quite a number of machines, this represents a
quite large bandwidth and time savings!  I've been using "debootstrap"
a lot lately, to build little "user mode linux" environments to toy
with.  Without the "apt-proxy", it would take a lot longer to run
that, pulling inefficiently over and over again across my DSL line. At
Free Geek, it will be even more important to have and "apt-proxy"
configuration up and running!  Once you've primed the cache, access is
almost instant.

How is it broken, I wonder?  Does it not pop up a balloon with the alt
text inside?  I don't think that's broken.  I think that alt text
should be shown when the image cannot be, but not in a balloon.  There
should be a separate property for the balloon text.

Ok, so what about The X Window System ?  Is it any more secure?

What if I'm running something from another host, projected here?  Can
it use ICE or something to do things in my root XEmacs?

I think it works just about as well with any Linux distro.  They all
get "Lilo" or "Grub" from the same upstream sources.

How much of the revenue that Red Hat rakes in gets put in the pockets
of the people who actually write and maintain the software that Red
Hat merely PACKAGES for distribution (and sale)?

Russ,

You're not suggesting that using and programming computers makes up for 
the loss of music and other forms of art from a child's education are 
you? As someone that did 10 years of music (mostly clarinet and 
saxophone) from 5th grade till my sophomore year in college I strongly 
disagree with your statement if you are. I don't think programming a 
computer compares to performing with other musicians in a band or 
orchestra on stage or a marching band performing a precision show on a 
football field during halftime. I know since I did all of these things 
when I was involved in various music programs in school.

I do feel that there is a certain sort of "art" and "craft" to computer 
programming but it's a different sort of art IMHO. Anyone else out 
there that was involved in band, orchestra, choir, drama, etc. in 
school? What do you think?

Tony

Red Hat users, check out rpm-update, a Python script with similar 
functionality:

  http://www.kleemann.org/rpm-update/

It's quite configurable and can be used to maintain update trees for 
any valid combination of architectures and Red Hat release numbers.

  I get warnings in my postfix daily report of a difference between
/etc/passwd and /var/spool/postfix/etc/passwe. Turns out that the former has
this user entry:

pcap:x:77:77::/var/arpwatch:/sbin/nologin

  I did not add this "user" myself so I'm curious why it's there and what

  Anyone know?

Speaking of non-sequiturs...that's a gold-medal winner. What illegal, 
strong-arm tactics has Red Hat committed? How many laws have they broken? How 
many customers have they bullied and extorted? What is your point?

Red Hat is one of the largest funders of Linux development. That's right, 
actual cash money to programmers. Can you show me where they demand royalties 
from projects they have funded? You can't- because they don't.

 When they rolled out their IPO they distributed stock grants to as many 
developers as they could find. I'm not sure what your point is- doubtless 
they have their flaws, but comparing them to Microsoft is absurd. 

Yes, they package and sell free software. They also give it away- download 
for free, dirt cheap from Cheapbytes, legally copied and distributed by 
friends. As do all of the commercial Linux distributors. If you can show me a 
gun pointed to anyone's head anywhere, I'll be quite surprised.

  We're running 0.9.6 and the URL is visible. Perhaps the font color is the
same as the background color; I had that problem with certain xfce setups.

  Long ago, about 5 years or so, I triple-booted Red Hat 4.x/5.x, PC-DOS/7
and win95. Worked just fine. Now, of course, only Red Hat is running, but I
access a couple of still useful DOS apps via dosemu and my GPS software is
used under vmware.

  More info:

  Looking in /ver/arpwatch/, it appears that this directory (and, perhaps,
the user 'pcap') are related to ethereal. Wonder if 'pcap' stands for Packet
CAPture?

You are correct sir. Pcap libraries are a requirement for ethereal. This
user also does not have a real login so it wouldn't be indicative of a
crack anyhow.

The pcap pseudo-user is added by the tcpdump or arpwatch rpms. Try

  rpm -q --scripts tcpdump
  rpm -q --scripts arpwatch

btw: 'rpm -q --scripts' is a tremendously useful query. I use it on 
uninstalled packages ('rpm -q --scripts -p blah.rpm') to figure out to 
what extent they're going to mess with my system :-)

I have also successfully simply shared via NFS my 
/var/cache/apt/archives directory on my fileserver and mounted it on the 
other satellite systems.

However, now that Karl has given me some good examples of how to setup 
apt-proxy, I'll probably migrate.  It's much easier to modify my 
sources.list file than manually grab packages because the 2.2r5 version 
of package x doesn't play nice.  ;)

It is the arpwatch demean, if you install arpwatch, it will use this user 
to send you arp info. my earlier post about "two ethn in one box error" was 
concerning this. I later found that my problem was on how I had my network 
wired up to the new router, I received email's every two minuets from 
pcap at mydomain.com until I fixed the issue.
example;
arpwatch: flip 
flop     the.ip.add.ress         the:mac:add:ress:xx 
(the:mac:add:ress:switch:from)

the issue was, I received an error that some other host had my IP address 
when I init'ed my eth0. then i would receive an arpwatch email from my 
other server telling me that the MAC address has changed for the IP 
address. I don't have enough TCP/IP knowledge to explain, but it happened 
when i had both sides of the router plugged into the same HUB with 
different IP blocks ( 10.10..1.x/24 and 209.162.208.x/24). I believe it had 
something to do with having the same subnet-mask. I thought they would 
ignore each other, my bad.

I hope I answered your question, and would appreciate any explanation of my 
TCP/IP issue.

The design groups seem to be using Linux pretty heavily.  There was
apparently a time a few years back when they were migrating to NT and
there was just too much trouble so now they use Linux and HPUX.

Sorry that I wasn't more clear.  I didn't _have_ a solution per se, I
was looking for a solution for a particular application.  If you've
got pointers, I'd love to hear about them.  I am also interested in
solutions to the related but more complex problem of computing nearest

seems to be a lot of literature on drawing such shapes, ray tracing

least, I had trouble finding much that I understood enough to tell if
it was applicable.

I think that lacks the clarity of: "stamp out intolerance" because
your formulation implies that only fanatics want death and that link
isn't as solid.

On the other hand, I think there are systematic reasons what Free
Software participants _do_ have better ethics/morals or whatever than
random proprietary software publishers in general and Microsoft in
particular.  There are self-selection biases.

So are you saying that Redhat (or any other entity) shouldn't be 
compensated for what they do?

The developers choose to give it away.

Redhat also gives away a significant amount of their work. Those that pay 
for it are CHOOSING to pay for it. The GPL specifically give them that 
right, and it's working.

I don't see any problem with this.

Redhat also creates some of the software used in their distribution. A case 
in point is the installer. They give that away too. Several other 
distributions use the same installer, or a branch thereof.

What I am suggesting is that for some people, these interactions with a 
computer replace it. For others, music is the conduit. For a third group, 
both are the sweet spot. Then there are those that do neither.

Of course, all the schools in the state could be like Creswell, and just 
cut all funding for sports.

Just a funny sidenote: a coworker of mine (former Intel coder) who is
now heavily invested in .NET called them the "Linux Taliban".  I guess
they had real problems using some poorly documented Open Source CVS
software.  Made me realize I have to be more diplomatic myself when
converting people to Linux.

It appears that he is saying the main vunerabilities are: 
 1. An unhappy employee on a restricted workstation escalating his 
privileges. I gather this may not be uncommon.
 2. Exploiting Terminal Services, such as Citrix, which can be done remotely.
I'm curious. Is 2. very common? Wouldn't this pretty much do in Citrix?

What it looks like to me, is that if you can get *any* type of login on 
a windows machine, you can run these attacks from anywhere in the world

That's a pretty serious vulnerability, in my book.  Granted, there are 
user-level rootkits for Linux as well, but this...this is just WRONG.

I thought the point was that anybody who puts 'Death to all $GROUP' on a
bumper sticker must they, themselves, be a fanatic.  The link isn't that
all fanatics want death to something, it is that anybody who wants death
to a group of people must be a fanatic.

I second Karl's response to this.

Any of the major distros should do fine.  I don't normally dual boot,
but I'm sure I've used Slackware and SuSE in dual boot systems; and
I think I've used SLS, RedHat, and Debian at times as well.

The major considerations are:

    -  Having a boot manager like lilo or grub that supports both OSs.
       (You can get around this by booting from floppies or CDs.)

    -  Having support for the non-Linux OS's filesystems in your Linux
       kernel.  You may also want support for your Linux filesystems
       in the other OS - if you trust the other OS's security - and
       you can find and afford software in the other OS to do this.
       (This isn't a hard and fast requirement, but it makes file
       transfers between the OSs easier.)


                                          Sincerely,

You have to determine what kind of interface it uses.  There is a
section in the kernel config for "non-ide cd-rom interfaces".  You have
to enable that section and pick which interface you need.

You will have to recompile the kernel to get this to work.  Those drives
are pretty rare anymore. They have not been made for many years.  (I
used to have a panasonic drive that worked off a sound blaster card.)

If you need specific help on this, contact me off list. I can help you
figure out how to make it work.

Looks like you installed arpwatch after you installed postfix.

If you are not using arpwatch, you should uninstall it.  It forces your
network card into promiscuous mode.

Tres cool. I've been fighting the same fight on my own, but haven't thought
of fiddling with the *FLAGS options. Guess I'll have to try this tonight
(set up the compile, type ``make all" & go to bed).

My last configure command was as follows:

./configure  --enable-toolkit-xlib --disable-mailnews --disable-ldap --disable-debug --enable-crypto

(I disabled mailnews & ldap because I don't see the point of them.)

One bit of trouble I had was to get Moz to access pages protected with some
level of security -- the infamous ``you need to install the Personal
Security Module" error message. This was especially annoying since I had
downloaded the 1.0 source code direct from their web site, & I was
expecting this section of code to be included. What I found I had to do
was unpack that bit of code inside the Mozilla source tree, then run
./configure with all of the switches.

Maybe that was obvious to some folk, but I spent a few weeks trying to
find the solution. And compiling Mozilla at each attempt slowed things
further.

I don't know if I'd go this far. I did a ``make all" & have been running
the binary from where the compile built it. Not entirely out of laziness:
Mozill acores for me when I try to launch it from where it gets installed.

(And if you have a solution, don't post it here: add it to the entry
under Mozilla Bug #153758).

I agree with Richard. Anything Outlook runs would have the ability to
exploit these bugs (since attachments are run by the user locally), and in
my book that is nearly as bad as a remote exploit.

It IS a remote exploit,  and it's actually worse than the kind you are
contrasting it with;  because everyone opens their email,  with a false
sense of security.

This makes any machine vulnerable,  not only those running a service and
connected 24/7...

Limitless possibilities.

Every Winblowz server comes with Terminal Server, for maintenance
(allows two remote connections), most admins enable it, for maintenance
purposes.

BTW, Rdesktop can be used by a linux system to connect to the Terminal
Server, for maintenance purposes, of course:)

Hasn't Microsoft provided some security patches for this behavior in 
OutLook? I recall my wife having a difficult time when one of her 
classmates emailed her a program and OutLook seemed to put the 
attachment in the bit bucket. We ended up using my email address and I 
saved the executable attachment from KMail instead. I don't know what 
OutLook is doing but there are times when you might need the ability to 
receive an executable attachment and don't want your email client to 
bit bucket the the thing.

I haven't really looked at OutLook to see if I can turn this behavior 
off or not. At least with Linux I can save off the file on our 
fileserver and then I can then virus scan the file with Norton 
Anti-Virus before allowing anyone else to access the file.

GnomeUI-WARNING **: While connecting to session manager:

So that seems to be a clue.  I thought crontab -e setup programs to run

I have my wife's system set up to use KDE 2.x and lately she's having a lot of
problems with it.  Applications (like Konqueror and Kmail) don't want to start,
but they start in her login, but they start fine for me when I'm logged into
that system.  I suspect that she crashed something that left some files
around,so I deleted the .MCOP* and .DCOP* files that were in her home directory,
but no luck.  I even went into .kde and some of it's subdirectories and deleted
a few things that looked safe to delete (I'm real careful in there 'cuz she
won't be happy if I lose her mail/browser configurations ;-).... but still no
luck, I can't figure out what is different about her login that's keeping these
applications from starting.

Any ideas? 

(BTW: What's all this mcop dcop stuff anyway?)

Is her PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables modified in some 
way that hose KDE? Compare them with the ones that work for your 
userid.

On startup time they're about on par with each other.

In everything else, Galeon is faster.  Things like java applets start up
about twice as fast in Galeon.  It also seems less 'heavy'.  But, there
are still a few things Galeon doesn't do.  It doesn't seem to work with
all javascript I've run in to, so for some sites I fire up Moz.  As far
as just speed is concerned, though, Galeon seems to beat out Mozilla
hands-down.

I don't know if my speeding up Moz would have sped up Galeon, because I
didn't ever even use Galeon until after I had Mozilla optimized.  I
really don't like gnome, and as such have only learned of gnome-type
applications through chance encounters.  I prefer them over the KDE sets
only because they're sooooo much faster loading up.  KDE apps all seem
to start up half of KDE with them.  Might as well just load up Win4Lin!

try your .kde directory as her (back hers up, copy yours over), if that
works you at least know where to look. Then you can manually rebuild her
settings from an empty .kde dir. (try with defaults, then copy over the
Kmail settings, if that breaks it then delv into kmail details...)

Make a backup of the folders in her home dir that start with . and the
files too.  Then delete them all.  If it works then you know that the
problem is in one of those directories and you can start adding them back
until there is a problem.  Like a binary search...Somewhat slow, but it
can save time if you're initial hypothesis is wrong.

Just becareful when you backup those files.  You don't accidentally want
to add ./ and ../ to your backup.

I guess it has been awhile since I have done this, but when I do:

usermod -G league jon

to add me (jon) to the league group, nothing happens.  I do not get an
error message, but I also am not added to the group.  League does exist
as a group, and I do exist as a user.  So, why does this not work, and
how do I get it to work.

What does 'grep league /etc/group' show?
You just about have to logout/login again to inherit
newly-added group privileges.

Caveat:  The usermod(8) manpage cautions that, as shown above,
this command will remove you from all other groups!

   -G group,[...]
       A list of supplementary groups which the user is also
       a member of.  Each group is separated from the next by
       a comma, with no intervening whitespace.  The groups
       are subject to the same restrictions as the group given
       with the -g option.  If the user is currently a member
       of a group which is not listed, the user will be removed
       from the group

(I can't say I like that aspect of this command.)

if league dosen't appear when you run "groups" as jon, you may need to
logout and log backin. If that still dosen't help, check the group file.

cat /etc/group | grep league
or
ypcat ....

If you aren't in the group file then you may have a problem with the
command line you use.. (I can never remember the commands, so I edit
/etc/group manually <duck>).

Don't delete them as root either...
rm -rf .*
is a _bad_ command when it comes to the ../ directory.
(try ls .* in your home dir as any user, and notice that it lists ../)

  I know we have some OpenOffice-1.0 users here and I'm sure you're more
experienced than I am, so I'll ask.

  Is there a way to convert the font (typeface and point size) in one, easy
step? This on a document imported from winWord, generally. That is, must I
block all 93 pages of an appendix to change from Times to Bitstream Amerigo
and from 12 point to 10 point?

  Also, is there a way to change the document's line justification from
ragged-right to fully justified again without blocking the whole thing?

TIA,

Rich

The other thing to do is to rename the .kde2 subdirectory in your wife's 
home directory to something like .kde2.save. KDE should then create a 
new .kde2 directory when it is first started up. You could then just 
find the KMail and Konqueror configuration files and copy them from the 
old .kde2 directory.

I notice too that KDE spits out a lot of messages in the 
.xsession-errors file in a user's home directory. You could try looking 
at the file and see if there are any useful error messages in it. Most 
of the messages don't make any sense but you never know.

all 93 pages since you can do it with a couple of keystrokes?

I have always just edited /etc/group manually. Is there
any reason not to do this?

Hmm.  Well, since the OpenOffice(.org) file format is gzip'd XML, I'm
betting you can zcat it through a script that'll do it for you, or you
could Ctrl-A to select all and change it.

Only human error, as far as I know. And rcs / cvs can resolve many of

Well as MS always says, back up the registry before you make any changes.

My friend had a non-networked linux box where he kept forgetting the root
password, so I told him over the phone how to make it so that root could
login without a password....He had to reinstall after that....Guess I
should have done it in person for him...

Shahms,

  I responded to Tony too quickly.

  Yes, ctrl-a does block the entire document, but then I cannot change the
typeface or point size. A click on the list widget button produces only a

  Oh, well.

Two things.
   Are you using 1.0?  I understand 1.0.1 fixes several problems but not
sure if this was one of them.
   Have you tried Edit -> Find & Replace -> [Attributes]

I don't have a document to test on but this 'kind-of' looks like where you 
need to go.
   There was also a message on the OOo [discuss] list about using a text
editor on the XML file to do a search and replace.

Hmm...I get list of fonts when I have done this in the past with OO. 
Most of my documents are less than 10 pages long though and maybe OO 
has problems with large documents or something.

The theory is that a utility program can:
   (a) lock the database files (e.g. /etc/group + /etc/gshadow,
       or /etc/passwd + /etc/shadow) to keep two simultaneous
       hand-edit sessions stepping on each other.
   (b) from accidentally corrupting the file (which, in some
       cases can keep a system from running).

In the real world, with your own desktop Linux system, "No,
there is no reason an experienced Unix admin can't hand-edit
his passwd/group files."  Production environments should
probably work with the tool sets.

If you formatted over the partiton all of the existing data will have 
been over written and is lost forever. :(

Are you sure?  I thought it simply overwrote the table that tells the 
disk where everything is/was (in MSDOS-terms, the FAT).

If recovery or rebuilding is possible, you *should* be able to access 
the data once again.

I realized that as a programmer I wouldn't be able to spot such a thing.
Does anyone know of a good website or book that teaches about these types

Also if you know of a good read about security in general I should

Formatting a partition in Linux usually entails creating a new file 
system on the specified partition. That operation overwrites all of the 
existing information that previously existed in that partition as far 
as I know. I'm not sure what information would be left to allow 
recovery of the data after such an operation occurred on a partition. 
I'm very happy if I am indeed wrong here.

I use same version of KDE. Recently, I tried to start Galeon and it just gave 
up.  When I tried it from a console window, it said: "Segmentation Fault".  
Being an old Windows user, I rebooted and it worked! Who knows?

  Yup. I just downloaded the 1.0.1 tarball but haven't yet installed it.

  Nope. But, I'm making progress ... figured out accidentally that some of
the styles are _paragraph_ styles although they cover an entire page or two.
Sigh. I suppose that those who have used nothing but Microsoft Word all of
this is "intuitive". But for old farts like me who used TDP (Text and
Document Processor) on the HP/3000 (my first document production on a
computer, in 1978) and spent 18 years with WordPerfect and the last few with
emacs/LaTeX and LyX, it's anything _but_ "intuitive". Sigh.

  Well, ... excelsior!

Tony,

  He-he-he! Sure enough. I have two appendices to this winWord doc that just
will not load into OO. One is 5.7M long, the other is 12.8M. Apparently
winWord has no problems for the agency staffers produced it on that.

Greetings all,

 I have recently completed downloading all the Debian
3.0 ISO's and will be burning what I call 'newbie
coasters'. These are just CD's with the ISO images as
files (eg /mnt/cdrom/debian-1.iso). I would be willing
to loan out these discs for anyone who wants to burn a
copy of the Debian CD's. There are 16 discs. 8 are
i386 and 8 are source. There are the usual NONUS and
normal disc 1 for each binary and source. So, that
makes a 7 disc set for i386 and a 7 disc set for
source.

[begin quasi-commercialized section of message]

I can also supply finished CD's for a charge of $10
(to cover the cost of the CD's and Sleeves, plus a $1
donation to the debian project). This is for a
complete source and i386 set, with the choice of a
NONUS or normal disc 1.

[end quasi-commercialized section of message]

If anyone is interested in either option, my inbox is
open.

Vincent Damewood

I'm also thinking about those specialized data recovery places that 
charge exorbitant rates to recover data from physically damaged or 
otherwise screwed up platters.  It's one thing if your 'format' command 
actually writes null data to the disk, quite another if it simply erases 
the pointers to files and simply claims the disk is 'empty'.

This won't work, it's not gziped XML, it's XML whose field contents have
been compressed (I don't specifically remember if it's gzip, though I
assume so).  There is supposedly a method that can be used to get
XML/text out of the file, but it's not a simple export/save-as (which it
should be) and I haven't had time to try it.

Uh... how 'bout `shutdown -r now' and then `boot: linux single'? If it's not
networked, then uptime shouldn't much matter, eh? Eventually he'll tire of
rebooting and remember the fsck'n root password *jeesh*

No, rebooting has no effect.  Like I said, they'll start up fine when I'm logged
in.  When started from her login, though, if I do it from a command line I get
something like "can't connect to DCOP server" or some such (I'm not at home to
try it at the moment).  In the past all I had to do was remove some files in her
home directory that were named .DCOP* .MCOP* and all was well, but now it's not
working...

With nothing else running, (fresh reboot, or at least fresh login) check
the running processes, sounds like one of the KDE daemons isn't running.

Hi Derek,

I think I am close NOW  !!!!!

Go back to the original state, making sure WinME able to transfer files 
from RH7.3 (Samba_Server)

/etc/samba/smb.conf
# Samba config file created using SWAT
# from localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1)

         workgroup = SEC
         security = SHARE
         guest account = IWILL

[test]
         comment = test share
         path = /test
      writable = yes
      browseable = yes
         follow symlinks = yes
         wide links = yes
         public = yes
         read only = No
         guest ok = Yes
         guest only = Yes


/etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 210.0.144.66
nameserver 210.0.144.26
search localdomain

(This is the original file when I first started Samba_Server without any 
alternation.  I have no idea what are those nameservers ????????)

But if the person in question can't remember their root password they 
won't be able to run "shutdown" since they can't su to root. I guess if 
the system in question handles <CTRL>-<ALT>-<DEL> a clean shutdown and 
reboot can be accomplished that way.

Nothing wrong with editing a file by hand IMHO. I still do this 
sometimes. For me it's pretty natural as back when I used to do Unix 
administration work "vi" and a shell prompt was the standard 
configuration tools of the day.

[snip]

No it does not, formating only creates the tables used to describe the
file system layout.  If you run a bad block scan as part of your reformat,
it - may - destroy all data on the partition, I don't know the specifics of
how the Linux block scan operates, though it is not specifically necessary
for it to destroy data.  Now of course, the new format tables and their
backup copies may destroy a small portion of your data when the partition
is reformatted, but the remainder of your data is there, the only question is
how difficult it will be to piece it together.  Unfortunately, while I
have gone through file recovery of this sort on other computers, I have
never done it on Linux (previous bad experiences ensured that I always
have very good backup systems and proceedures these days), though I have
heard of utilities to do it.  You could look around for Linux data and
partition recovery utilities, file system editors, and undelete programs.
One possible approach is if you can reformat the partition to the same
EXACT format it had before (be aware that there is an old and a new
version of ext2 format, if that was your old format, you probably need to
use the same one), then try running some kind of undelete program.
Probably most recovery methods are going to need the file system format to
be restored to what it was before by reformatting, though I suppose it's
possible that your old format may have stored it's backup tables in
different locations from your new format, in which case it might be better
to try to find/use those rather than reformatting again.

If you have the excess disk capacity available (and are running newer
kernel and tools that support files larger than 2 Gigabytes if your
partition is 2+ gig in size), you could copy the entire raw partition
to a file as a backup copy in case you mess it up, or as your primary copy
to work on while you go ahead and use the partition if you need it
immediately.  For backup copies, you will probably want to pipe them
through gzip to save space.

FWIW

  Interesting point, Richard. I wonder if any of 'em can handle anything but
a Microsoft partition. They all use Microsoft tools, after all.

That trick doesn't work in slack or debian if my memory serves (he was
using RH tho), and I was just trying to do him a favor since it was an

Hi Derek,

Further to my posting of today.

******* Problem Solved Now ********

It is CASE SENSITIVE !!!!!

#smbclient -t smbfs //IWILL/SHARED /mnt/WinME/
[password]		[ENTER]

ignoring the password then it works.

Lot of thanks for your advice, particularly, /etc/hosts file  I almost 
surrendered.

Now my next step is to test "PRINTER" on Samba_Server

Have you had any comment on following entry to be made to 
/etc/samba/smb.conf ???

[printers]
comment = All Printers
path = /var/spool/samba
browseable = yes
guest ok = yes
writable = yes
printable = yes

Thanks in advance

Stephen

Good point, Tony. You'd have to add the user to /etc/shutdown.allow and do a
`shutdown -ar now'.

Ouch. That case sensitive thing bit me several times, too. It's one of those 
things that we hear and know, but fail to grasp in application. It's stopped 
surprising me, but mostly because of the pain it has caused me. Win doesn't care, 
even when I'm careful to dilligently repeat cases, even from the M$ instructions.

Another way out of this problem would be booting from some sort of 
"rescue" floppy or CD. For my SuSE systems I usually boot from CD 1 to 
get into a "rescue" mode. This feature saved me big time after I 
installed a new kernel on one system and I forgot to create a ramdisk 
image with all of the kernel modules. 

My system was DOA when it couldn't load the module for the SCSI 
controller. :O

And about avoiding hardware vendor lock in, application lock in, etc.
Look at IBM's strategy, for instance.  Run Linux on everything.  Look
at Sun's recent change in strategy:  also offer Linux alternatives.
HP does the same.  Dell.  Compaq.  Want one OS that runs on pretty much
every box you can buy?  Simplify costs of system administration?  Your
card not supported?  A high school kid can probably write the driver.
You need a custom OS hook?  Sure, only the development/labor cost, no
OS contract required (other than maybe ensuring your support vendor
will still provide support if you muck the kernel ;-).

Have your corporate guys call IBM or HP and ask them about the benefits.
If it is good enough for (all!) the big boys to sell, it is probably good
enough for most other corporate uses...

I use MPlayer (the cvs snapshot is usually quite good -- nothing pre-0.95
is worthwhile for DVDs in my opinion).  It's pretty freakin' stable.

The dvdnav library appears to be sought by the configure script, but I
haven't determined whether or not MPlayer can actualy use it.

I also use Ogle, which fully supports DVD menu navigation.  However, my
experience with Ogle is that it is slightly unstable, a little bit slow
sometimes, and can just halt in the middle of a scene and not recover, all
the while displaying a single frame of the video without error.

I've never had any luck with VLC (Video::LAN client), but your mileage may
vary.

You can also just rip the DVD's contents with transcode and play it back
with any opendivx player.  There is some loss in this approach, however.

I found the VideoLAN client to be very simple to get set up, and it works
really well.

Xine is also very popular, but scrounging up all the pieces to make it
fully functional takes time and effort.  ;-)

Linux on Intel: A Battle IBM will Win

June 2002

Most people now know that the success of Linux is important to IBM, and have 
heard about IBM's $1 billion Linux investment. But inside IBM's Linux push, a 
key battle is being fought on the Intel Architecture. Rich Michos, IBM Vice 
President of Linux Servers, was recently asked why the battle for Linux on 
Intel is so important to IBM, and how IBM plans to win on this strategically 
important architecture. Here's what he had to say.

Question: Rich, thanks for talking to us about IBM? and Intel. Let me begin 
by asking you why the Intel architecture so important to IBM?

Michos: The Intel platform is the fastest-growing hardware platform in the 
server business, and with IA-64 we're beginning to see greater penetration of 
Intel servers into enterprise computing. This comes at a time when Linux has 
moved out of the universities, away from just doing file, print and other 
basic infrastructure work, and into the enterprise. Linux is showing growth 
that's about four times that of Windows?, and its adoption rate far surpasses 
that of any other operating environment.

Over the past few years, we've adopted open standards for many of the things 
that we do inside of IBM. We have done this at the behest of our customers, 
who have an increasing need for integration. Open standards allow people to 
do other things as well. Our ability to use the Internet is largely based on 
the standardization of protocols like TCP/IP and HTML. We see XML allowing 
applications and processes to share data. We see people utilizing Java? as 
the standard platform for application development. Now, we see in Linux and 
Intel the standardization of operating system services and microprocessors.

We also believe that as the proliferation of Intel architecture and Linux 
continues, Intel/Linux will draw more applications, and increasing the number 
of applications will further propel volumes. All the while, the relative 
performance of Intel/Linux will continue to improve vs. the other 
alternatives. So in the end, Linux on Intel is a big winner.

But it's not enough just to have an Intel/Linux play. We believe shipping 
Intel/Linux high-volume is critical to IBM. As you know, Sun is a major 
competitor of ours and they've challenged us a bit over the past years.

Now, Sun has organized themselves around a low-volume strategy that's built 
on the Solaris operating system and SPARC microprocessor technology. We think 
that eventually, as the number of deployed Intel/Linux systems runs away, Sun 
may begin to struggle to keep a competitive application stack and competitive 
pricing, even in the enterprise. This will not happen to us.

Question: What does the increasing growth of Intel architecture mean to IBM 
and to its platform strategy?

Michos: It means we intend to dominate this Intel space, and use high-volume 
strategies to get them out the door.

We were in this game early, and we've benefited by working very closely with 
Intel. In fact, we've substantially contributed to optimizing Linux on the 
64-bit Intel architecture. And we're leveraging IBM research and the many 
technologies that we've developed over the years, and applying them in the 
Intel server space to give customers compelling reasons to prefer IBM's Intel 
solutions. We don't change the microprocessor. We get the microprocessor from 
Intel, but we make the processor do more.

At the center of this effort is X-Architecture? on Intel, and Project eLiza?. 
Mainframe-like partitioning and virtualization on Intel to allow one system 
to run different operating systems, or several instances of the same one. 
This eases integration in homogeneous environments, and enables server 
consolidation on larger Intel-based systems. We've also built features into 
our implementations to greatly enhance I/O. And the adaptive, self-healing 
technologies of Project eLiza predict, isolate and manage failures to 
minimize downtime.

On systems like the x440, customers can easily plan for growth. The x440 will 
let a customer scale from a 4-way to 16-way by simply adding and connecting 
4-processor nodes. We recently announced our easy-to-use Linux Web hosting 
appliances that can be deployed in minutes, and host multiple Web sites on a 
single server at a low cost. And with our upcoming Intel-based Blades 
solution, you'll be able to put literally hundreds of processors in a very 
small footprint, all centrally managed by IBM Director. That becomes very 
compelling for hosting Web applications, and for people that are supplying 
e-utility services. It means that they can manage hundreds of the blade 
servers from a single point of control, and at a fraction of the cost of a 
server farm.

We will continue to distinguish ourselves by not only having 
price-competitive blade offerings, but we'll be able to offer world-class 
systems design and microprocessor packaging. As the volumes will go up, we'll 
continue to ride those curves.

Question: These benefits are mostly hardware and architectural 
differentiators, and that's great. But where does Linux come in? How does it 
help IBM, and why should customers prefer our Intel/Linux solutions to those 
of our competitors?

Michos: One of the challenges we've had over the years is that the world of 
application development has not centered around IBM. ISVs have been writing 
their applications on either Windows, or on UNIX?, where Solaris was 
prevalent. So it's become incumbent upon IBM to find a way to motivate 
application developers to port their applications to IBM operating 
environments. Because Linux runs on everybody's technology, including all of 
IBM's eServers, adopting Linux neutralizes the significance of the operating 
system, and helps position IBM as the platform and vendor of choice due to 
IBM's advantages in technology and support.

By developing for Linux, ISVs can spend more money on function and less money 
on porting. It mitigates any advantage that some of our competitors might 
have had in the past. As we mentioned before, high volume will inevitably 
draw more applications, which in turn will drive even higher volume. It's a 
cycle that feeds back on itself.

Another challenge we've faced has been that he who controls the application 
development environment can also do things like control partnerships for tool 
vendors, and influence the target platform. So just as we have supported 
Apache for web servers, Linux as the open standard for operating systems, and 
Java as the standard development language we have brought vendor-independence 
to the Linux and Windows application development space by open-sourcing $40 
million of code to the Eclipse project. This permits any and all ISVs to 
integrate their developer tools into a vendor-neutral platform.

Linux technical enablements like this are important and necessary, but 
enablement by itself hasn't been enough to motivate enterprise Linux 
adoption. CTOs and IT-directors are a very risk-adverse group. So to complete 
the picture, it's been necessary to back up technical enablement with 
dependable, reliable Linux service and support to let our customers know it 
will be safe to take advantages of the value Linux offers.

Our customers mustn't be confused by all the shouting going on in the 
marketplace about service and support. IBM Global Services Organization (IGS) 
has done several things that make IBM stand out. They have Linux principals 
and practices in every geography. They have a complete portfolio of Linux 
offerings. And the ATS (Advanced Technical Support) organization, the 
technical services arm of IGS and their deep Linux competency, is a real 
asset.

IGS has also recently announced an agreement with SuSE that to a great extent 
allows IGS and SuSE to interoperate as one team. We can act as each other's 
contractors, for example. And we have a two-year technology agreement with 
SuSE to tightly fit the SuSE Linux Enterprise Server product to all of IBM 
eServers.

So in many ways, though technology has helped enable our Linux move into the 
enterprise, it's the IBM brand and the solid reputation of IGS that have been 
pushing it out the door and into enterprise deployments.

Question: You mentioned Web appliances. How do you see IBM's new Web 
appliance play stacking up against the Sun Cobalt appliance servers? After 
all, Sun was first to market.

Michos: Sun's acquisition of Cobalt bought them first into the Linux server 
appliance space, but Linux is still marginalized inside Sun because they 
don't really view Linux as core to their business. They know it's a threat, 
but they haven't quite figured out what to do about it and they're sorting it 
all out now, sometimes in public. Consider that every day, for ten years, 
when a Sun rep or reseller woke up in the morning, the story has been Solaris 
on the low end, Solaris in the middle and Solaris on the high end.

Sun will more than likely leverage Linux in competitive situations when they 
have to. In numerous cases we have removed dozens of Sun servers and replaced 
them with one or two IBM machines, running Linux. That has to be very 
frightening for them.

Question: How do we plan to move our Intel solutions into the marketplace?

Michos: There are several ways that we are delivering Linux/Intel. We are 
working to move more IBM Intel-based offerings into existing accounts, 
stepping up direct sales on the Web, leveraging the partner channel to extend 
our reach into the SMB space; and working with Software Group and their 
partners to accelerate xSeries Intel sales.

There is a misconception that we can't compete on price with our Intel 
servers. Not true. Any customers who believe this should contact their IBM 
sales rep and we'll clarify that quickly.

We will be using IBM.com to move Intel as well. Last month, we launched the 
Linux Store at www.ibm.com/linux/store that will eventually host all of IBM's 
Linux offerings. It will offer the entire xSeries server line, and feature 
the top selling xSeries server on the Linux store front page. Some people 
cede low-cost Intel to Dell, but we have now become cost competitive with 
Dell in the Intel space, and have made great strides in our ability to 
deliver through IBM.com to marginalize Dell's perceived advantage in 
fulfillment.

Beyond selling more Intel into the enterprise, and selling Intel/ Linux 
directly on the Web, we're building a value net around Linux on Intel with 
our broad community of channel partners to move Linux servers through the 
channel. Let me explain how this works in practice, by using a current 
example.

One of the partners that we've negotiated a relationship with is SteelEye, a 
provider of enterprise-grade, low cost, high availability clustering, data 
replication and disaster recovery software. We did some joint marketing with 
them, and now we've begun to leverage their network of partners to help sell 
IBM xSeries? Linux servers.

They're reaching customers we never would have seen. One of our most exciting 
references so far this year is BBDO, the largest advertising agency in the 
world. It turns out we got that account through a SteelEye business partner 
in Germany that we didn't even have a relationship with.

Then SteelEye came to IBM and asked if we would help sign Champion as a 
SteelEye business partner, and so we helped them do that. Of course, that 
helped us too. So the value net continues to expand. That's how this is 
supposed to work. And we're building a team inside of IBM to help Software 
Group and the IBM xSeries business partners to collaborate even better. We're 
introducing them to each other, training them, and educating them on 
cross-incentives available through the channel.

This is adding even more value to IBM partnership. For example, consider what 
we did with ACCPAC. ACCPAC is a leader in accounting software that 
specializes in delivering country-specific accounting solutions. They have 
grafted to IBM because one of their leading competitors, Great Plains, was 
purchased by Microsoft. They've now completely enabled their application on 
Linux, and Software Group has begun driving integrated offerings with ACCPAC, 
IBM middleware, and xSeries.

So the ISV partners are starting to say, "Linux and Intel is everywhere, but 
IBM can help us drive revenue." That's music to our ears. IBM can help these 
partners deliver a truly integrated offering that customers will be confident 
in, because they know their businesses will be backed up by IBM service and 
support.

Question: Thanks again for taking the time to discuss this with us, Rich. Do 
you have any closing thoughts you'd like to share with our readers?

Michos: Yes, I'd like to leave our readers with a vision of what's just 
around the corner, a vision that we believe will drive our Intel demand 
forward even further: Grid computing.

Our support of Grid computing and the goals of the Globus project are 
starting to remove the importance of "place" from computing. If the server 
you use is on the Grid and the work just happens, you don't care so much 
where or what the processor is. But, if you are paying for computing 
services, you'll really care about price, performance, and reliability. And, 
if you are providing computing services for web hosting, as part of some 
integrated collaboration, or as an e-utility; standards, price/performance, 
and reliability are everything.

Linux plays a key role in Grid initiatives. It is standards-based, delivers 
excellent cost of ownership benefits, and provides the flexibility needed for 
application integration. Many of the notable Grid deployments to date feature 
IBM eServers, and you will see and hear more on this as the year unfolds.

As our mainframe-inspired Intel-based implementations continue to deliver 
greater value than that of our competitors, as Intel microprocessor 
X-Architecture continues to improve performance, and as software initiatives 
such as Project eLiza deliver enhanced management capabilities, IBM will 
remain well-positioned as a leader in Grid technologies. We think the value 
that Linux and IBM server technology adds to Intel will give us an edge here, 
especially when compared with competing Intel commodity solutions. So when 
Grid computing begins to drive customer demand forward, we'll be ready to 
help them.

So, as you can see, we are very excited about our strategy going forward, and 
Linux on Intel is a key element as we charge into the future.

The info page on "shred" might shed some light:

   On a busy system with a nearly-full drive, space can get reused in a
few seconds.  But there is no way to know for sure.  If you have
sensitive data, you may want to be sure that recovery is not possible
by actually overwriting the file with non-sensitive data.

   However, even after doing that, it is possible to take the disk back
to a laboratory and use a lot of sensitive (and expensive) equipment to
look for the faint "echoes" of the original data underneath the
overwritten data.  If the data has only been overwritten once, it's not
even that hard.

   The best way to remove something irretrievably is to destroy the
media it's on with acid, melt it down, or the like.  For cheap
removable media like floppy disks, this is the preferred method.
However, hard drives are expensive and hard to melt, so the `shred'
utility tries to achieve a similar effect non-destructively.

   This uses many overwrite passes, with the data patterns chosen to
maximize the damage they do to the old data.  While this will work on
floppies, the patterns are designed for best effect on hard drives.
For more details, see the source code and Peter Gutmann's paper `Secure
Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory', from the
proceedings of the Sixth USENIX Security Symposium (San Jose,
California, 22-25 July, 1996).  The paper is also available online
<http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html>.

   *Please note* that `shred' relies on a very important assumption:
that the filesystem overwrites data in place.  This is the traditional
way to do things, but many modern filesystem designs do not satisfy this
assumption.  Exceptions include:

   * Log-structured or journaled filesystems, such as those supplied
     with AIX and Solaris.

   * Filesystems that write redundant data and carry on even if some
     writes fail, such as RAID-based filesystems.

   * Filesystems that make snapshots, such as Network Appliance's NFS
     server.

   * Filesystems that cache in temporary locations, such as NFS version
     3 clients.

   * Compressed filesystems.

On the same note, if you have old ISO CD's you don't want, consider

Even if it writes null data to the disk, the original data can be
recovered if only one pass is made. (With fairly expensive equipment.) Cf.

Not necessarily. But you should get in the habit of using "vigr" and
'vipw" where appropriate to lock the files during edit and prevent
corruption.

The extended filesystems (extfs/ext2fs) (theoretically extensions of the
minix fs) do not use a file allocation table, rather like BSD
systems they employ a combination of indexing and linking. Note that of
course in Linux the kernel uses the VFS which can call whatever filesystem
you want. Cf. the link below for some details, or Avi Silberschatz's OS
book (with the dinosaurs on the cover), in the appendix on Linux for VFS
and inode info.

......

Physical Structure

The physical structure of Ext2 filesystems has been strongly influenced by
the layout of the BSD filesystem [McKusick et al. 1984]. A filesystem is
made up of block groups. Block groups are analogous to BSD FFS's cylinder
groups. However, block groups are not tied to the physical layout of the
blocks on the disk, since modern drives tend to be optimized for
sequential access and hide their physical geometry to the operating
system.

The physical structure of a filesystem is represented in this table:
Boot
Sector Block
Group 1 Block
Group 2 ...
... Block
Group N

Each block group contains a redundant copy of crucial filesystem control
informations (superblock and the filesystem descriptors) and also contains
a part of the filesystem (a block bitmap, an inode bitmap, a piece of the
inode table, and data blocks). The structure of a block group is
represented in this table:
Super
Block FS
descriptors Block
Bitmap Inode
Bitmap Inode
Table Data
Blocks

Using block groups is a big win in terms of reliability: since the control
structures are replicated in each block group, it is easy to recover from
a filesystem where the superblock has been corrupted. This structure also
helps to get good performances: by reducing the distance between the inode
table and the data blocks, it is possible to reduce the disk head seeks
during I/O on files.

In Ext2fs, directories are managed as linked lists of variable length
entries. Each entry contains the inode number, the entry length, the file
name and its length. By using variable length entries, it is possible to
implement long file names without wasting disk space in directories. The
structure of a directory entry is shown in this table:
inode number entry length name length filename

As an example, The next table represents the structure of a directory
containing three files: file1, long_file_name, and f2:
i1 16 05 file1
i2 40 14 long_file_name
i3 12 02 f2

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0208080925380.19072-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  OpenOffice appears to have copied everything bad from Word and Microsoft.
It tries to be the only application one needs for anything rather than just
a word processor (or, perhaps, a spreadsheet, too). I waste too much time
trying to write a letter and have the darned software get in my way.

  Today's case in point: my letterhead has the e-mail address,
info at appl-ecosys.com under the telephone and fax numbers. I suppose it is
because of this, I cannot block any text within the body of the letter.
When I move the pointer over text, the I-beam changes to a pointing finger
and I cannot block text or insert the cursor at that point. All I can do is
read a little window that points to a URI on my filesystem.

  I've gone into Tools -> Options -> html documents and turned off
everything I can find. I've saved the doc, exited OO and restarted. But, all
to no avail.

  I need to get this letter written and sent out this morning. It's quite
frustrating to have software that trys to be smarter than I am and won't let
me block text, insert the cursor where I want to type or be productive in
any way.

  Does anyone know how to overcome this behavior? I want OO to look at any
document as a string of text characters, not some URL, URI or anything but a
written document to be printed on a piece of paper. FWIW, the only time I
have this problem is when I use the letterhead template. If I write a report
or anything using the 'default' page layout there's no problem. So, I assume
it has something to do with the fact that I had the audacity to put an
e-mail address on a doument.

Thanks,

Rich

Rich, I don't think I know any way to help you on this problem other than
suggesting you use AbiWord, it may have a way to get around this.

I think you might want to re-evauate what you are using for the future.
Do you actually NEED OO?  Is there some reason why you have to use it?
Are you sending documents to Word users?

My suggestion is LaTeX or html.  You can find editors for both, and both
allow you to export to a format that can be used by most people.  LaTeX
lets you convert to pdf, this is nice for published things, but the person
on the other end will have read-only access unless they own a pdf editor,
which is rare.  Many html editors will export to rtf, and I think there
are command line tools for doing that also.  Or they could just view the
html as-is.

Are you looking to have a graphical interface?  LyX and Texmacs both let
you create pdf and have a pretty good UI.

The bottom line, for today, try to use a different editor.  For the
future, lets try to find a better tool.  I am very curious about this too,
I recently had a group project where we were creating documentation.  I
was sending pdf files to my group memebers because LaTeX is so easy to
use, but they were silently getting pissed because they could not edit
anything I was sending them.

HTH,

I struggled at great length with the DVD problem and concluded that Xine
was the best player for Linux.  Ogle is as Jeme describes it, pretty
flakey.  Mplayer is a cool app', and I use that for AVIs and MPGs, but
on my system (1.4 GHz Athlon), DVD playback on Mplayer is just a little
choppy--enough to be really annoying.  This may be hardward-related, as
most users don't seem to have this problem; but Xine plays smoothly
(using the same DVD lib's, I might add), so that's what I use.  If
Mplayer worked as well, though, I would probably ditch Xine.

Also, the Mplayer developers are rather cranky, especially Arpi, the
lead.  So if you ever post to their list, be prepared to get RTFM'ed.

Open Office will do many many things, if you know how, the online help is

The problem is, everyone *expects* this of a Office Suite nowadays.  If 
M$ Office has it, OUR Office Suite has to have the _exact same_ 
functionality.

In fact, there were a few emails on the sun-internal StarOffice 6 
mailing lists on just this fact.  Someone complained about a 
feature/bug/unexpected behaviour, and someone else said that it was 
there *specifically* because M$ Office does the same thing.

Sad, but true.

There is a pretty extensive list of bugs, non-bugs, issues and whatnot 
on the OO Bugzilla pages (http://www.openoffice.org/issues/query.cgi). 
If you happen to find something that you think could be a bug, just go 
here and see if you find it.  Chances are, it's been reported OR it's 
something that M$ does too.

I don't know about your problem with block selecting, it never gave me any
trouble, maybe there is something wrong with the template other than the
email address issue (which I did have problems with).  If I remember
correctly, the email address/URL problem that I had is caused by the
software automatically converting it to a hyperlink, even in non-HTML
documents.  I think the way that I fixed it was to go to their "Tools"
menu and select "AutoCorrect/AutoFormat", and on the "options" tab,
uncheck the two boxes next to "URL recognition".  At this point, the
problem still isn't cured, it only prevents future problems.  You must now
go back and delete/re-enter anything that it has converted to a hyperlink
such as your email address in the template.

As far as your block select problem, is it possible that you are trying to
select data in both a document header area and the main document itself at
the same time?  If your letter head template is setup the way mine is, the
company name, address, email, etc. is all in a document header, which is
entirely separate from the body of the document, and I don't recall that
any of the word processors I have used would allow selecting both the
headers and the document contents at the same time, and I believe it would
generally be a very bad idea if it did.

Hope this helps.

Rich,

Here is a work-around that I have to do when using M$.
I would go to whatever document stores your letterhead
and select the email address, cut, then Paste Special
as unformatted text.

I found this trick to work with email addresses and
URL's.

Jason,

  Bingo! I get Word docs and I need to provide copies that they can read in
that so-called OS. :-) (I'm cranky today because of this nonsense.) I also
get a lot of permit application templates in Word.

  I looked at AbiWord, too, but there was something it didn't support as
well as OO that is important to me. It might be the printer; I don't recall.
I did download both and try them. I now recall there was an issue with
printing envelopes. I spent a frustrating half-hour with AbiWord and
couldn't do it but did so in less than 5 minutes with OO. This was my first
exposure to both.

  I would love to use LaTeX/LyX, but have been stymied for a couple of years
on two issues: installing the half-dozen typefaces/fonts I use and
developing style sheets for letters, invoices, and the like. I would
_really_ like guidance through the very complex, involved process of making
additional fonts visible to TeX (and its child, LaTeX, and grandchild, LyX);
I'm about 80% there (but have been away from it since the very early part of
this year). Style sheets and mail merge are also of high value here. That's
how I produce invoices, marketing letters and other "bulk" mailings.

  LaTeX is designed more for academid use than business use. It can, of
course, be used for the latter, but I've not had the time, expertise or
insight to be able to turn it quickly into a productive system here.

  I've written several articles in LyX. It's the only GUI document processor
that doesn't raise my blood pressure.

  Although it's not particulary productive overall, I find myself using joe
in a virtual terminal to write. No formatting concerns, no removing my hands
from the keyboard, just look at the screen and write while focusing on the
content. _Very_ highly productive for me. The shitty part comes when I have
to import it to OO, then go line-by-line taking off the terminating LF so
it's formatted nice and pretty for printing. Of course, LyX does this very
quickly and easily; if I was really good with LaTeX I'd have emacs
keystrokes set up for inserting the markup as I wrote. But, overall, I
prefer to just write without regard for format or markup.

  In your situation I'd produce .dvi output so that everyone could work with
it in LaTeX or LyX. 

  Maybe what we need is a group session where we all install LaTeX fonts and
learn how to build customized style sheets.

Thanks,

Rich

  I did this a while ago, Carla. It's still off.

  Yes, it will do a lot, but the model is completely foreign to me; probably
because I've never, ever used winWord for anything. The concept of markups
is both easy for me to grok and to support (even if I cannot see the codes).
But, figuring out what's a paragraph style issue and what's a page issue is
quite different. Don't forget that working for 18 years with WordPerfect
forged a strong sense of how processing words should be done. OO is totally
different; not necessarily worse, just different.

  There was something I sought in the on line help earlier this week and
could not find. Turned out in was hidden in a style formatting dialog box
but there was absolutely no reference to it in the help index.

Thanks,

Rich

Richard,

  I've heard that argument too many times before. My response is that of my
parents when I was a teenager (back in the early Pleistocene) and wanted to
do something "because everyone else was doing it": "If everyone else jumped
off a cliff, would you do it, too?"

  We're letting Microsoft define the rules of the game, but trying to tell
them that our way is better. Discrepancy here! Why not do it a much better
way and sell that to the intelligent (i.e., non-sheep) out there?

  I guess it's difficult being an independent thinker in a herd of sheep.
That's been my problem all my life. Perhaps I should stop asking "why?".

  Heh! They've got a big bug there, too. I reported an issue and was asked
to post the winWord template that caused the problem. When I try to log in
to bugzilla it won't let me. I was told they were working on that problem,
too. Sigh.

Many thanks,

Rich

Shannon,

  As I responded to Carla, that's been unchecked since I first installed OO
a couple of months ago. What I think is happening is that the software
ignores the instructions and makes it a hyperlink anyway. Whenever I open
a new doc with that template, the e-mail address is light blue and
underlined: a hyperlink. But, that's been turned off from before I created
that template.

  No. I type a paragraph below the letterhead and recipient's address.
That's where I cannot block text.

  Actually, I made the letterhead the way I did in WordPerfect: part of the
document body itself. Didn't do it as a header or in a frame (as someone
else suggested). Perhaps this is what I should do once I get this letter out
the door today.

Thanks,

I would be interested in this.

I would also be happy to contribute any Plain TeX and Extended Plain
TeX knowledge that I can still access.  I used to write straight TeX
(for mathematics typesetting) before I began using LaTeX.  But many of
those neurons have surely died by now.

LaTeX/TeX would be an excellent topic for a meeting, IMHO, possibly a

I don't think you are going to be able to do this (unless you want to do a
little code work, or submit a feature request and wait) because gnomecal
wants to access the X window display environment which you aren't going to
have when running from within a cron job.  To verify this, try running
your command line when logged into a virtual console rather than from
within X.  There is one way around this, if you have an X server running
when the cron job executes, and the user the cron job executes as has
permission to connect to the X server, and you set the "DISPLAY"
environment variable for the cron job to point to the active X server,
then it should work.

Oh, I agree with you 100%.  Why should we duplicate how M$ does things 
100% of the time?  We shouldn't...  But the problem is, when people are 
migrating to OO from M$, they *want and need* that same functionality in 
order to get the job done.

AFTER we've converted those who are willing to convert, THEN we can 
start changing functionality, or they can start using something that 
makes more sense.

This goes along with the whole 'linux on the desktop' debate as well. 
Advocates want to see linux prevail, Critics say they have to have 
Windows functionality TO prevail.  People are like sheep, the'll follow 
the crowd.  If M$ does something, then Linux has to do the SAME thing in 
order for people to accept it.  The only reason Linux *hasn't* prevailed 
on the desktop is because it's not Windows.

So, OO and SO are doing what people want.  People as a GROUP, mind you, 
not the geeks who know WTF they want.  Like K in MIB said, "A Person is 
smart.  PEOPLE are dumb, ignorant and scared."  Or something to that 
effect.  You get my point.

<snip>

There's also KWord, part of the KOffice suite.  Although it is a KDE app
(less stable, starts up slower) it does do a pretty good job for what I
was doing (Engineering class papers... yeah, I know I should learn TeX
stuff)...

Just be sure and save your work in its native format often and always
before saving it as another format.  I had its filters barf out on me a
couple times, taking the whole thing down with it (most of the time that
was with KSpread, but it happened with KWord, too).

So it isn't super-stable, but it is pretty feature-rich and was
customizable enough.  It might do the trick for you....

As an engineering student, I think a TeX class of some sort would be a
good thing to have under my belt!  I'll bet you could get a lot of folks
to participate in something like that if they were aware of it.

  No apologies necessary, Carla.

  Although I'm an end user and not a professional geek, I'm _really_
discouraged by the herd mentality of those trying to move businesses from
Microsoft to Open Source Software.

  Why do we have to dumb-down and build in inefficiencies and bugs just
because that's what Microsoft does? I cannot think of any other product or
brand that markets itself as being just as bad as "the other guy". Ford
tried to ride the coattails of the reputation of Mercedes Benz some years
ago by advertising that their car (whatever model it was) "looks just like a
Mercedes!". Of course, it didn't have the same quality or reputation and
that ad campaign fizzled out.

  There are so many options in linux to automate offices that it's almost
criminal that we have to make something as bad as Word/Office to convince
folks to move. Why should they? What, other than money in their pocket, do
they gain by moving from Word to OO? We talk about stability, productivity
and control as selling points for OSS over Microsoft, then we take the most
important office application and make it just as crappy. OO is not stable,
productive or willing to share control over documents with the writer.
Rather takes the wind out of our sails, doesn't it?

  I am very interested in overcoming these two hurdles to the regular use of
TeX for document typesetting in the business environment. If the entire
process can be clearly explained for the non-Donald Knuth's among us (me,
for example) and well documented we're well on the way of offering LyX as a
business document production system.

Thanks,

Rich

have you see Bruce Sterling's speech? 

http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/301-350/00325_open_source_speech.html

"There's a noticeable lack of basic creativity in the free software world, 
that is alarming and not very flattering. People in free software still have 
a basically piratical state of mind. They want goods without working for 
them. They still have a cracker state of mind. "How can I look through that 
closed bedroom window?"

"GNU's Not Unix." Okay, you're "not Unix" ? but what are you really? Why do 
you have to live in that shadow? The shadow of this other enterprise. There's 
something basically juvenile about that. Something that is unworthy, 
creatively feeble, childish."

"
What's the real price you pay for free software? The real price you pay is 
having to bow the knee to the weird organizational model and the freaky, 
geeky social values that prop that up. If you're the user, you have to hang 
out with Linux freaks."

If you're running from KDE, KWord starts up in a few seconds. OpenOffice 
on the other hand takes nearly 10 seconds before I see anything other 
than its splash screen. I guess my system isn't very fast anymore as I 
only have 10K RPM Ultra-160 hard drives and a lowly 900MHZ Athlon. I 
guess I need to upgrade my system again at some point.

I've been slowly migrating the business I work for over to OO.  The more
closely it resembles MS Office, the better.  It's still an excellent free
and open office suite, and that's what matters most to me.  It's already
very difficult to get users to switch to something new.  If they have to
learn Yet Another Way To Do The Same Thing, then many of them will
flat-out refuse.  Now if the envelope printing in OO was the same as in MS
Office, I could eliminate about 70% of the complaints I get...

I think they do this sort of thing as it may be the only way to get 
people weaned off of MS Word. People don't like change and people used 
to the way Office works will probably complain loudly if they are 
forced to learn OO and it works differently. I know I don't mind 
learning new things and different ways of doing things but there are 
many people out there that are.

Oh and in answer to your other question, I think the sheep out number 
the non-sheep by a very wide margin.

Oh come on, Rich.  MS Office isn't as bad as you make it out to be.  It's
a very nice office suite.  Yes, there are problems and annoyances, but on
the whole it works well and most people are familiar with it.

Money in their pocket is the only real reason.  99% of users and managers
don't care about "freedom" or "stability."  We may, but we're in the vast
minority.  But if I can save my company thousands of dollars by using an
office suite that is nearly identical to what everyone is already familiar
with, then that's an attractive selling point to users and managers.  For
yourself, as an individual user, use whatever makes you happiest.  For a
business trying to save money by using free software, the more closely it
resembles Microsoft products, the easier it is (and in some cases the only
way) to break the Microsoft habit.

  LyX is your friend! Dean and I had a very good exchange on this last year.

  I use LyX for my articles and reports (that don't need a letterhead or
someone's specific formats). I can report that from my experience it has a
10-minute learning curve. That's the time it takes to read the tutorial.

  After that, there are issues that come up, but the online users guide,
reference manual and mail list are absolutely superb. LyX is, hands down,
the only GUI document processor I can more than tolerate. I actually like
the silly thing!

  I've put in equations, tables and figures with no problem. Sometimes it
was a problem to get them looking as I wanted, but then I was taught how to
do it. Herb Voss in Germany has a huge web site of LaTeX code ready to drop
into LyX that does almost everything but the shopping and laundry.

  Because you don't have to do anything about formatting output, you sit and
create quickly. Mark headings and lists from the pull-down menus and that's
all the effort it takes. And the output is stunning! It is, after all,
professionally typeset and that makes a tremendous positive impression on
those that read it.

  There are also styles for various and sundry scientific journals and many
different theses/dissertations from different universities.

This isn't something I use much anymore but at one time there were 
numerous books on this subject. TeX, and LaTEX are great for saving 
paper. The nice thing is what I saw on the screen using "xdvi" I would 
get on paper when I was finally ready to print a hardcopy. 

I can't tell you how many times Word and other WYSIWYG word processors 
have hosed me where things looked great on the screen only to appear 
not-so-great when output to paper. I really think WYSIWYG should really 
be renamed to WYSMBWYG instead (What You See Might Be What You Get) 
where a lot of word processors are concerned.

Here are some reference books if anyone is interested. I don't know if 
these books are still in print or not as I've had most of them for 4-5 
years now:

"The LaTEX Companion" ISBN 0-201-54199-8
"The LaTEX" Graphics Companion" ISBN 0-201-85469-4
"A Guide to LaTEX 2E" ISBN 0-201-42777-X

I used TeX and LaTEX though "emacs" putting tags in by hand, etc. I know 
there is a wordprocessor called "LyX" that uses LaTEX for output. They 
call it WYSIWYM which is "What You See Is What You Mean)...

This is where I pop in with my $0.02 about software design.  Layered
component based development is good.  True object oriented design (like
that found in Unix, not like that found in programming languages like Java
and C++), is wonderful here.  Make expert programs and utilities at one
layer.  Make them form a fundamental system for the processing of office
data (whatever you want to call it), make them work with the command line.
Then on top of them create a layer for using them, probably graphical.
This way advanced users can have their advanced interface, either via the
command line or special graphical tools that are known to be for the
experts.  Then have programs with an interface like OO that is known to be
for the novice, or winWord expert.  The bottom line, strong integration is
bad, independent layers that are capable of working together are good.
The next time you think of designing software, say that to yourself for a
while first.  MS doesn't get this, perhaps its marketing, perhaps it's a
lack of consideration, who knows...

I stopped running KDE a while ago simply because it is so terribly
bloated.  Sure, my system can handle it... but why should it have to? 
It seems to me a lot of KDE could be streamlined better.  On older
systems, it just takes forever to start.

So I switched to fluxbox.  About the only thing I miss is the ability to
start KDE apps as quickly as I was able to when running the full KDE
suite.  I can access things so much faster, though, and have weaned
myself off KDE apps for the most part.

Ok, I'm diverging...

Yeah, KOffice does start a lot faster when KDE already running. 
Definitely better than OO (which is just really slow no matter what, it
seems.  I can't run it over a forwarded X11 display worth beans... this
is over 100Mbps LAN).  But I always am sure to mention the loadup time
when they haven't mentioned they're using KDE.  :-)

As Rogan mentions I am willing to teach how to use LaTeX, I am not an
expert, just a user.  I use LaTeX via emacs on a daily basis, and have had
to learn little more than the basics even to do mathematical papers, and
reports with tables of content.  Gets me a grade that is at least 10%
higher than I would have gotten using word.  I must say I've never like
LyX because it has always been confusing to me.  I can't offer any help
with it...But I can with emacs.

I have a tutorial that I send to people that are curious about LaTeX, it
is 600KB so I don't like to email it, but you can find the latest version
on my web page:
http://www.engr.orst.edu/~dagit/latextutorial.tar.gz

There is a makefile in there to help with creating your documents, it has
a known bug with table of contents.  I know a work around, but I don't
know enough about make to put in an elegant solution.  If you're a make
expert let me know so we can fix this bug.

If you pluggers test it out, please send me your feed back so I can
improve it.

Also Rich, there is an archive of TeX/LaTeX templates and such at CTAN.
I have only used their site once, but it might have the business resources
you want/need.

It depends on the society.  AMS (American Mathematical Society) is (or
was, last time I looked) exclusively TeX/LaTeX-based.  They even have
a version of LaTeX named AMS-LaTeX.  The manifold theorist, Michael
Spivak, has published a nice book (in the style of Knuth and Lamport)
for those who want to do Pure Maths Typesetting with "straight"
TeX. It is called

    _The Joy of TeX - A Gourmet Guide to Typesetting with
                  the AMS-TeX Macro Package_.

He even formed his own publishing company (based on TeX) to publish
his five volume work on Differentiable Manifolds.

IEEE (my society) allows both .ps files (usually derived from LaTeX)
and .doc files (written with you-know-who's typesetting software)
and provides style files and templates for each system.

MPEG does everything with .doc files.

I don't know about Physics, Chemistry, or Biology, but I know that
LaTeX has sophisticated macro packages for the first two that allow
just about any graphic, e.g. Feynman diagrams, Organic Molecule
diagrams, to be designed.  There is also a nice Music Typesetting
package, as well as packages for Chess, Maps, &c.

Long before Linux and the "free software revolution" there was TeX and
the army of people writing all kinds of modules for it.  For serious
users it's a way of life and makes the "cult of emacs" pale in
comparison. (Well, that may be slight exaggeration).

Be aware that TeX/LaTeX is _not_ a WYSIWYG system, though there are
Linux packages out that have a WYSIWYG front end.  My (nearly nil)
knowledge of these is that they are great if you are not trying to do
anything very sophisticated.  But to get the full power of LaTeX you
must go to old-fashioned editing.  But it is not bad at all.  I can
code up a complex mathematical expression in TeX by typing in the
commands to a file, compiling it, and displaying it just as fast as my
colleagues can use "Equation Editor" in M$ Word.
And mine will look like professionally typeset mathematics rather than
the stuff that my eight grade algebra teacher would print off on the
school mimeograph machine thirty years ago.  (That's probably another
slight exaggeration.)

 :: I haven't used it at all thus far, though.  Slackware has a
 :: whole seperate diskset for it, for some reason... I've never installed
 :: it. 

There are two (or three?) major distributions of TeX/LaTeX.  I can't
remember the 2nd one but the one I use is called `tetex' and I have
version 1.0.7 installed.  Of course I simply do: "rpm -Uvh tetex*.rpm"
and it's installed and ready to use.
But since you use Slack you may have to compile.  It's not a single binary
but a whole raft of things.

In "the old days" compilation was a bear.  It probably isn't any more.
There are many, many components to a full TeX system including the
viewers, the translator(s) from .dvi format to .ps, the plethora of
fonts, and much more.  You need to worry about very little of this if
you use a tetex sub-system.

You may wish to look at http://www.ctan.org/ where the CTAN (comprehensive
TeX Archive Network) is housed. Everything (and a lot more) is there.

All good books.  And of course there's the definitive

    _LaTeX User's Guide and Reference Manual_, 2nd ed.,  ISBN 0-201-52983-1

by Leslie Lamport, who invented LaTeX (and who, I hear, now works for M$).

Finally all the above refer, many times, to the Final Authority:

   _The TeX Book_ (sorry, it's home so no ISBN number handy)

by Donald Knuth.

It's a difficult book, but if you want to become a TeXpert, it is a
must.  Everything derives from it.  Many times the above books contain
footnotes like "to learn more about such-and-such refer to pg. xxx of
_The TeX Book_.

Well, I'm hardly publishing papers.  More or less, I'm at the turn in a

That's good to know.... now if I do something in TeX, can I later
convert it to pdf, postscript, or (ghasp!) Word?

I never got in to Emacs much.  There is quite a cult following, though,
I've noticed.  "Linux is just the device driver"  "Emacs is a great OS,
but it sucks as an editor"  Although if I include those, I *must*
include "You can't spell eVIl without vi"  :-)

If it helps me get out those darned equations faster than the quite
cumbersome equation editor, I'm sure I'll fall in love with it!  I like
keystrokes when I'm typing a paper, not mouse movements and clicks.

Matt,

  OO is rather brain-dead in this department. With WordPerfect, I could
print an envelope from a letter displayed on the screen and the application
would pick up the address from the letter and put it on the envelope. Not
OO, rather than automate the process it needs to be done manually.

Yes.  The TeX/LaTeX "compiler" generates a .dvi (DeVice Independent)
file.  This is a binary file which (as I understand it) contains the
placeholders and co-ordinates for each symbol in the document but no
actual symbols (e.g. letters and numbers) themselves.  One takes
a .dvi file and then runs something like dvips which renders the .dvi
file as a postscript document.  Finally you can use, e.g.,  ps2pdf to
convert to pdf format.  I don't know if you can do .dvi --> pdf directly
as I usually deal in .ps.

My usual commandline (yes, I said commandline :-) is:

latex foo.tex; dvips -o -N0 foo.dvi;

For things with lit. references, indices, tables of contents, &c.,
there are a few more steps, all of which can be done like the above
so you just hit "up-arrow" <RET> in a dedicated xterm, or, in Emacs,
a single key chord.


I don't know about Word, but I would guess there is no converter for
this else the entire TeX community would be buzzing about it.  A good
Word converter would, in fact, allow one to do Word directly from
Linux (Lyx --> TeX --> .dvi --> Word) without having to use StarOffice
or some other albatross, or without having to go with something like
win4lin (as I do) or vmWare that lets one run Windows (and hence Word
in its native environment) on top of Linux.

As a bone fide emacs cult member I must say that LaTeX + Emacs is a
_great_ combination.  I confess that I don't use all the features of
Emacs that make Emacs+LaTeX so great, but from what I hear, it is
better than WYSIWYG in that single key chords allow all kinds of
powerful functionality "at the press of a button" (pardon the pun).
I feel an Emacs Sermon coming on so I'll stop here.

 :: keystrokes when I'm typing a paper, not mouse movements and clicks.

This is the great thing about both TeX and Emacs.  My hands rarely
leave the keyboard. The mouse become superfluous except when (outside
Emacs) I have to go bink some idiotic button in some brain-dead GUI like
Netscape.

To write the Euler Equation (evaluated at \pi) in LaTeX or TeX I
simply type $$e^{-i\pi}+ 1 = 0$$ and I'm done.  The Word User is still
trying to find the \pi symbol in the pull-down menus when I've got the
eq. sitting, pretty as can be, in `ghostview' which I've got set up to
autosense that the .ps file has been updated.  From typing (in Emacs)
to display is (for a short document) under two seconds.

Best of all, the symbols are typeset (99% of the time) in exactly
the right positions to look "professional".  My parents were commercial
printers who did a bit of mathematics typesetting.  It is a
_very difficult_ business to get it to look right.  Knuth got it right.

Finally, like Linux (and Emacs), TeX is, as a system, an amazing, complex,
elegant piece of computing machinery.

But I feel another sermon coming on so I'll stop here.

 :: I'm sure I'll compile it... but Slackware has a whole diskset of TeX
 :: binaries.

Why?  Unless there is something in Slack or tetex, itself, that will
comprehensively `make' the entire tetex package (like rpm -bb), you'd
be foolish to hand-build everything.  I just looked in my tetex rpm
(rpm -ql tetex | wc -l) and it counts 6188 separate items. Some
are directories but the vast majority are files.

 :: tagfile       tetex-doc-1.0.7-i386-1.tgz  xfig-3.2.3d-i386-1.txt

I'm guessing that stuff like tetex-bin-1.0.7-i386-1.tgz contains _many_
binaries, including the "web2c" compiler, xdvi, dvips, and much more.

Sounds like a good way to turn yourself off to LaTeX real fast.

But that's just my opinion.  As I said in a previous post, things may
be much easier now than in the mid-eighties when we did have to
compile the whole she-bang "by hand".  It was an all-day job.  Sort of
like compiling all of X "by hand" (which I all did in the old days).

This is disturbing.  I was sent a .dwg file (autocad drawing) as an

and tried to open the file with autocad.  The file was corrupt and I
could not open it.  The same thing happened when it had been zipped.
The only way it worked is forwarding it (before even opening it) to
myself on my windows box and using Outlook to save it.
Can this really be true?  Wonder why.

Maybe a bug in mutt?  You might try using a different mail program to save
the file.  I use pine and have never had a problem like this, though I
have on many occasions sent and received large (5 - 15 Meg) binary files
(executables, zip files, etc.) as attachments without problems.

Alternatively, the paranoid in me says maybe this is a new feature of
the (presumably Microsoft flavored) mail program used to send it to you,
intended to force people to use MS products to receive their email.

  The TUG -- International TeX Users Group -- is headquartered here in
Portland. But, they apparently do nothing but collect annual dues and hold
annual meetings in furin' countries to which I cannot afford to travel. I
wish there was a local users group that met regularly (once a month?). I'd
sure be an active member!

  Perhaps Sharp would sponsor space and coffee?

  For me, getting the few fonts I need in is the major issue. Heck, I could
do well with Palatino as the body text (already available) and find
something as a header text, but I need Baker Signet as the company logotype.

  After this, I want to learn how to create stylesheets so I can have a
letterhead, invoices and so on.

  There is a TON of macro packages on CTAN. I need to get past the font and
style issues resolved first.

  The LyX web site describes it as WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean).
I've put a lot of LaTeX in the preamble of docs and there's a way (called,
interestingly enough) Evil Red Text (or ERT) to write pure LaTeX in the
midst of your LyX document.

  The only real advantages of LyX over LaTeX are, IMO, 1) you don't need to
memorize and type macros, just select them from the pull down menu and 2)
it's just a mouse click to compile and view the dvi output or print a pdf
doc. The full power of LaTeX _is_ available.

  A couple of years ago I sold back to Powell's my LaTeX books, except for
one: "LaTeX for Linux" by Bernice Sacks Lipkin. That sits at my desk here.

You should not use "grep" for that purpose, because it is possible
that the "passwd" and "group" files are NOT where that information is
coming from.  If NIS or nss-LDAP are in use, for instance, the groups
a user is in may be getting filled in from sources other than the
"group" file.  The command to use is "id".

% id karlheg
uid=1000(karlheg) gid=1000(karlheg) groups=1000(karlheg),0(root),4(adm),20(dialout),24(cdrom),25(floppy),27(sudo),29(audio),40(src),44(video),50(staff),104(fwproj),105(pilot),110(cvs),111(cvsadmin),112(cvslock),113(debian),114(www),120(uml-net),127(plex86),800(Debian),1024(ksrc),128(freegeek)

In general, it's best to use a "documented api" -- an accessor program
or function -- rather than parsing or editting a file like "passwd" by
hand (or especially from a script), since there's often no guarantee
that the file format will not change in the future.  Encapsulation was
not invented for hiding proprietary secrets, but for insulating
software from changes internal to libraries or external subsystems
they rely on.

There's no way around logging out and logging in again, since the only
way that all of the processes in your environment (window manager,
terminals, shells, xemacs, dired, etc.) will have that new group in
their list is if they inherit them from "login" or "gdm".  See
"setgroups" and "initgroups" int the GNU LibC manual and the source to
"login" for more details.

> Caveat: The usermod(8) manpage cautions that, as shown above, this
> command will remove you from all other groups!

That's one of the reasons that Debian's "adduser" utility is the
command line tool of choice, at least on that platform, for adding new
users, groups, and adding users to groups.  It wraps the "shadow
suite" tools with a Perl script that makes this sort of operation a
lot easier to do.  It also ensures that new users and groups are
allocated from the UID and GID blocks mandated by the Debian Policy
Manual.

It is a little confusing, at first -- You have to rememeber that
there's both and "adduser" command and a "useradd" command.  For the
first few whiles, you should always start by typing the command and
it's "--help" switch, to make sure you have the right one.  A good
mnemonic is that "adduser" is first in the alphabet, and is the one
you should be using.

8<------------------------------------------------------------>8
adduser [--home DIR] [--shell SHELL] [--no-create-home] [--uid ID]
[--firstuid ID] [--lastuid ID] [--gecos GECOS] [--ingroup GROUP | --gid ID]
[--disabled-password] [--disabled-login] user
   Add a normal user

adduser --system [--home DIR] [--shell SHELL] [--no-create-home] [--uid ID]
[--gecos GECOS] [--group | --ingroup GROUP | --gid ID] [--disabled-password]
[--disabled-login] user
   Add a system user

adduser --group [--gid ID] group
addgroup [--gid ID] group
   Add a system group

adduser user group
   Add an existing user to an existing group

Global configuration is in the file /etc/adduser.conf.
Other options are [--quiet] [--force-badname] [--help] [--version] [--conf
FILE].
8<------------------------------------------------------------>8

So, to perform the operation that was the subject of the original
question, a Debian administrator would simply type "adduser USER
GROUP".

  LaTeX, and LyX, by default output to .dvi (DeVice Independent). Like XML,
it's rather neutral and easily converted to whatever you want.

  Like olives, it's an acquired taste. According to Bernice Sachs Lipkin,
emacs is the only software that _includes_ the kitchen sink. :-)

  Try it in LyX. Even I did it right the first time. I did need help getting
it centered horizontally, though, but was shown how to do it.

  Stay with the tetex version. It's apparently the most robust.

A segmentation fault is when a program attempts to access memory
outside of the region allocated to it by the operating system.  There
are features of the CPU that are utilized by the operating system to
implement this.  (It's part of the virtual memory subsystem.)  You
will not find much about that in the HOWTO's, but you will find quite
a lot in textbooks about operating systems.  There are several good
choices of reading material on the subject available at Powell's
Technical Bookstore.  It's not 15 days for dummies type of reading.

So anyway, what's happening is that "rpm" has a bug that is triggering
a segmentation violation.

What you can do is turn on core dumps in your shell, with, assuming
you use "bash", "ulimit -c unlimited".  Then, run the command again,
and wait for it to dump core.  Then, you type "gdb rpm core", and open
the core dump in the debugger.  Now you can type "where" and attempt
to get a stack trace showing where the core dump occured.  Chances are
that you will not be able to get any useful information, however,
since the "rpm" binary has most likely been stripped (info binutils)
and there's no way for GDB to map raw addresses to function names or
variable names.  If this is the case, which it most likely is, you
will need to get an unstripped copy of "rpm" and try again...

By the way, if you have a core file and don't know what created it,
just type "gdb /bin/ls core" and GDB will tell you it's not a core
from "/bin/ls", then tell you what program created that core dump.

I find it amusing that RPM reimplements the Make utility like that.
It's like that old adage that "those who do not study Unix are doomed
to reimplement it, poorly".  Debian's package build system is Makefile
driven.  A debian/rules script is a Makefile named "rules", marked
executable, with a shebang line that looks like:

8<------------------------------------------------------------>8
#!/usr/bin/make -f
# ...
8<------------------------------------------------------------>8

... so that it can be run like a script.

Also, packages are NEVER built as root, since once in a while, an
upstream "install" target will have a missing ${DESTDIR} or somesuch,
and wreak major havoc with the builder's computer.  So, the right way,
on Debian is to use "fakeroot", like this:

nonroot:~/src/pkg% fakeroot debian/rules binary

That will build the software, install it to a staging area, then
package it into a .deb package.

If the copy of "rm" you are using follows ".." during a recursive

Hello!

Just had a thought and I would wonder if this would work. Do you use
Varicad - I am tring it out, but I noticed that you can use it to work
on .dwg files. What happens if you try to see the file using this
program - interested because I am trying to find another program to use
instead of Auto-Cad.

Any info appreciated.

Thanks, Dale

  I solved the problem of the e-mail address being seen in OO as a URL. I
re-created the whole letter template and put the letterhead in a header on
that first page. Woo-woo! It works!

  Now I set up another style as letter-second-page and that'll have a
different header on it.

  Gee! That only wasted about an hour or two today.

Sebastian Rahtz and Frank Mittelbach are the big wizards.  The latter
is one of the designers of the advanced font scheme (NFSS) used in LaTeX.

Fonts have always been _the_ problem with LaTeX.  Knuth designed his own
(computer modern) and made TeX play nicely with them. If you're happy
with CM fonts, life's a breeze with TeX/LaTeX. If not, well ...

This was before commodity software typesetting so people were just
plain happy to have a beautiful typesetting alternative to troff
(yuck).  But being able to use generally available fonts is nearly
impossible in Plain TeX and, until Mittlebach, LaTeX.  Now its
relatively (key word) simple (as I understand) but I've never deviated
from the fonts that come in Tetex (a reasonable selection) and so I
don't know how to import Your Favourate Font and make it work.

But then I don't even know how to get TTF working in KDE, so it's no
surprise.

I stand corrrected, though if you are reduced to writing straight LaTeX in
the midst of your LyX document, to get all the functionality, then
I might be tempted to argue with you.

As for memorising and typing macros, it "just happens" after a little
while and then you find yourself speeding along just as I'm doing now
in typing this post.  I don't need to think about the individual
letters I'm typing.  I just write.  Same things happens in emacs.  The
initial period of learning is awkward (just as learning to drive a
"standard" tranny truck is awkward, but after three days you don't
even think about it.  But the mouse-clicking menu-binker will be
enslaved to pulling down menus, then pulling down sub-menues, then pulling down
sub-sub-menues, finding entries, and binking on them for the rest of
his life.  All to get \pi into his equation :-)

Maybe that's why you're having so much trouble with fonts :-)
The index of _The LaTeX Companion_ by Goossens, Mittelbach, and Samarin
contains no less than 1.5 pages of entries under "Font, (see also Character)".

I also see in Chapter 7 (Font Selection) sub-headings like:

Introduction to NFSS (New Font Selection Scheme)
Understanding Font Characteristics
Font Families and their Attributes
Encoding Schemes
Using Fonts in Text
Changing the Default Text Fonts
Standard Packages
Providing New Text Fonts
The Low Level Interface
Setting Up New Fonts,

and so on.

But, to be candid, I've not studied this section so I don't know
if  it will help.  Fonts always seem harder (to me) than they should.

By the bye, I'd love to see a nice in-depth tutorial at one of the
PLUG meetings on Fonts (for X, KDE, and or LaTeX).

  I found a quantum mechanic to work on the diesel engine for me. Only need

  Yes, and not only has the NFSS bamboozled me despite having read about it
multiple times, I've been told that it's not all that great. The manual
method is better, they write to me.

  That's probably because you spell it wrong and the purchasing wallah gets

  OK. I've printed out the fontinst tome, but it's a very slow process to
work my way through it. Different font files need to be place in different
dirctories, then magic words must be mumbled in the proper tone of voice for
LaTeX to see them. After that, it's a breeze! In the preamble put
\usefontpackage{yournamehere}.

  Right!

  Only when LyX won't do it for you. I've not yet had to go this route, but
my needs -- like Ghandi -- are simple.

  Yes. And it was horribly obtuse at the time. I read the whole thing. More
than once.

  This is almost all theory. The last part is _far_ from a simple cookbook
approach.

What a great thread this was and it got me looking back into using TeX 
on my system again. I only had the "tetex" package installed and there 
was no "latex" executable to be found on my system so I had to pull out 
my CD set and install a couple of packages. Now everything works 
through emacs again and things are starting to come back to me.

There is a program called "word2x" that is supposed to convert a Word 6 
document to either text or LaTEX. I can't seen to find any Word 
documents I can test this one as all of the ones I have are from Office 
2000 I think. When I tried to convert a Word document I get an empty 
text file and a near empty LaTEX file.

AthlonRob, why would you want to compile that stuff? The "tetex" package 
is rather large and I would just install the stuff that Slackware 
includes. When I first started using TeX 5+ years ago I used the TeX 
tarballs included with the Slackware CD set I got from Walnut Creek 
CDROM. It worked great with emacs and xdvi and ran pretty well 
considering I was using my old 486DX33 w/32MB of memory back then. I 
just don't see the need to compile anything that already exists as a 
ready to install package from a CDROM. Sure back 5+ years ago Slackware 
didn't include that many packages so there were some things I 
downloaded and compiled from the source.

For a different perspective, try reading Miguel de Icaza's paper
"Let's Make Unix Not Suck". According to Miguel, the Unix no-policy
tradition leads to "a remarkably low-quality experience for users." I
posted an excerpt below.

If we accept Miguel's arguments, it is not surprising that Microsoft
trades off application modularity for usability and a (supposedly) coherent interface.

...............

 No policies. - from "Let's make Unix Not Suck"

In the UNIX kernel, the tradition is to not implement policy. This
approach and philosophy permeates the whole UNIX system.

For instance, even X-Windows[1] avoids establishing policies for anything.

What we have ended up with is the ultimate pluggable system: the ultimate
"write your own" operating system.

Developers trying to satisfy every possible user from every possible
background, for every possible task end up making everything an optional
feature. They end up not standardizing on anything and leaving policy to
applications.

The problem is that leaving the policy to individual applications means
that each application gets to decide its policy, its user interface, its
configuration files, and its own way of doing things.

This leads to a complete lack of consistency on graphical applications. It
is not just a matter of toolkit fragmentation: even if you compare Motif
applications you will see that they behave radically different when they
have to deal with the operating system and with the user preferences and
with the environment in general.

Sure, we have the ultimate plug-and-play system, at the expense of having
a barely integrated environment.

Unix today is more of a collection of outdated and loosely coupled tools.
The result is a remarkably low-quality experience for users.

Subject: [PLUG] Mail headers in MS Outage/Express?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0208090731390.22307-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I'm running a couple of small, low-volume mail lists for an organization
to which I belong. All of the subscribers are Microserfs, except for one (at
least) who uses a Macintosh (and AOL, for goodness sake!). Anyway, I was
just made aware that at least one MS user sees only the "Reply-To; " header,
which is the mail list name, and not the "From: " header which is the
actual, individual sender.

  For those of you who live in a mixed-OS world: is there something that
users of Microsoft MUAs can do to see the actual sender of a message to the
maillist? Alternatively, is there some change I can make in majordomo to
make it easier for them?

Thanks,

Rich

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0208090759160.22802-100000@skua.ahapala.net>

I am setting up a dial-in service on one of my servers. I've got the modem 
installed and setup with drivers. (It's one of those Connexant/Rockwell 
winmodems. It works, I can dial out with minicom just fine). I've 
installed the mgetty package and read the various docs/howtos that I've 
come across but am still having difficulty.

I try to run mgetty with "mgetty ttySHCF0" or "mgetty modem" and it 
fails. It looks like the mgetty.config file doesn't have the right 
settings. Here is what I get when I comment out all but the debug line:

date host mgetty[pid]: init chat failed, exiting...: Invalid argument
date host mgetty[pid]: failed in mg_init_data, dev=ttySHCF0, pid=pid

Here is what I get when I use what I think is the correct config:

date host mgetty[pid]: init chat failed, exiting>>>: Interrupted system 
call
date host mgetty[pid]: failed in mg_init_data, dev=ttySHCF0, pid=pid

Here are my configuration lines from mgetty.config:
port ttySHCF0
   speed 38400
   modem-type data
   data-only yes
   toggle-dtr no
   direct no
   init-chat send ATQ0V1E0 expect AT send AT&K3S0=0 expect ok


Any suggestions, insights?

TIA,

IBM really doesn't get it either.  We were evaluating some cluster admin
software that they were so happy with.  Almost all of us are old unix
hands.  About 1/2 hour into the first day we all raised our hands at
about the sme time and asked where the command line equivs of the gui
were.  There were none.  They actually expected to run this java junk
over a slow dialup connection from Caracas Venusuela to Agnano Italy.

We all asked why they did not start from the command line and later put
a gui on.  They really did not understand what we were wanting and why.

At the end of the second Day, they knew though.. Big Time.

votermanagement.com and activistmanagement work fine.  Put a www in

Subject: [PLUG] Postfix "Deferred"
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20020809092906.02289398@localhost>

I recently began running a postfix log analyzer, and this raises 
questions.... :)

Part of the analysis is this:

/etc/cron.daily/0postfix-log:
Postfix log summaries for Aug 8
Grand Totals
------------
messages
480 received
405 delivered
30 forwarded
60 deferred (1016 deferrals)
45 bounced
98 rejected

The deferred total keeps going up. Yesterday is was around 960. The day 
before, 850 or so. I look farther in the analysis, and I see a list of the 
deferrals, and almost all are spamhouses that don't accept inbound mail, so 
they get "Connection Refused".

Is this just the price I pay for rejecting spam?

Is there a way to see what's in the queue and flush it manually if there's 
nothing important there? I've looked through the postfix, qmgr and flush 
man pages, and I didn't see anything there that looked like a userspace 
command.

Thanks in advance.

I'm not 100% sure about the linux version (and I don't have a convenient
test box right now to be 100% sure), but many versions of the
"file" command will show you who left that steaming core lying around on
your system.

I.e. "file core"

Which is much faster than firing up gdb on the file.

The DNS servers registered for these domains are:
AUTH101.NS.UU.NET            198.6.1.210
AUTH51.NS.UU.NET             198.6.1.162

I'm guessing that they don't have "www" listed as a valid host in their
zone files.  Once the DNS issues are resolved, make sure that Apache is
configured for both versions:

ServerName votermanagement.com
ServerAlias www.votermanagement.com

It's your DNS entries.  The "www.votermanagement.com" name does not appear
to have any "A" record in the DNS.

Don't panic about the complexity of the data below.  It's intended for DNS
experts.  To become a DNS expert a good place to start is
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/dns4/.  Also set up a caching nameserver on
your local linux box to have some place to play.  (The transition from
caching to authoritative (local private network only) nameserver is not
too hard once you've read that book.)

Some analysis:

The line:

votermanagement.com.    21600   IN      A       65.197.65.119

Is the key.  This address resolves to 65.197.65.119 because of that
"A" record present.

The "NS" section shows which nameservers are authoritative for your
domain.  This is where all the information in the "dig" output ultimately
comes from.

Now let's look at the www addresses:

-----
$ dig www.votermanagement.com

; <<>> DiG 9.1.3 <<>> www.votermanagement.com
;; global options:  printcmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 44988

;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 104

-----

Note the lack of any IP address, and dig returns the name "commented
out" with the semicolon.  That name didn't resolve.

The "SOA" (start of authority) record also lets you know which hosts were
responsible for the answer.  Again, our good friend "auth51.ns.uu.net".

The short answer:

Your ISP (uu.net) needs to add the appropriate "A" records to their
DNS.

You have to have an A record or alias in the table for www to resolve also.

Looks like the uu.net DNS server are authoritative for your domain (I'm

So if you have requested a DNS entry for www.votermanagement.com, they
definitely haven't entered it, and it has nothing to do with your
servers. They also don't have a PTR (reverse DNS) record for
65.197.65.119, and you really should have one.

I didn't check, but the same is probably true of your other domain.

You might consider hosting your own DNS, rather than relying on someone
else. It is not horribly difficult, and you get to be in charge of your
own destiny.

Russ,

  My postfix installation included a daily report mailed to postmaster by
root. It has all sorts of neat stuff.

  I think that I have finally figured out that the deferrals are outgoing
messages, not incoming. I get a lot of 'em, too. If these spam factories
cannot be annoyed by receiving bounced/rejected messages they sent to us,
then I would change the action from REJECT to IGNORE. According to
/etc/postfix/main.cf, 

# IGNORE the header line is silently discarded.

which I interpret to mean that the message is slipped into /dev/null. If I'm
wrong, then I, too, would like to know how to just throw away the rejections
that are not received by the sender so I can save the bandwidth.

I believe you can set Postfix up to check to see if the domain from 
which the sender says he's coming from exists, and if it doesn't, to 
auto-reject the message.  Because obviously, if the domain doesn't 
exist, mail isn't EVER going to get back there.

Other checks could be to see if the address matches the initial 
sent-from domain/IP (but some people use from: headers that differ from 
sending domain for their own spam-avoidance reasons), if the netblock 
matches the domain, etc etc.

I had to switch email adresses at one point because I was getting so 
much spam.  I informed my friends, watched the logs and then set any 
mail to that address to REJECT, regardless of sender.

As a further caveat, compiling the TeX & associated packages involves more

FWIW, kpathsea is a library designed to help programs manage their way

Rich, what clients show 'reply-to' and not 'from'? Or is the 'reply-to' 
address appearing in the 'from' field? On my Lookouts, there is no 'reply-to' 
field at all, have to dig into the headers, which are cunningly hidden 
several layers deep.

They might also have to configure their Lookout clients to actually 
display the from: field - at least the last time I used it, you could do 
this.  Just right-click on the header bar and (probably) select 
properties.  It's been a while since I've used Outlook - I heeded the 
warnings of my peers.  :)

"View, Options". and you see internet headers from within MS-Outlook.

Possibly you can have some of your clients look at that info and see if

  I assume it's Lookout. All he sees is the mail list name, not the actual,
individual sender. I've no idea what those fields are named as I've never
touched the stuff myself, never mind not inhaling.

Q-CAD is free and does most of the drafting stuff that AutoCAD does - 
geometry creation, editing, (like fillets) copy multiple, radial arrays,  
(like for a bolt pattern) etc. 

However, it suffers from what I call 'AbiWord Syndrome' which that means it 
touts itself ad being able to create DXF files (its own output file 
extensions are '.dxf') which makes you think AutoCAD can read them in, while 
in truth these files do not cooperate with AutoCAD at all.

But Q-CAD certainly is a viable candidate if you're looking to design some 
simple mechanical parts and need to get them to a machine shop.

Also, it's certainly -awesome- given that it started out as a student design 
project.

On the other hand, a product to AVOID is 'LinuxCAD,' which was also known as 
'EntCAD' for a short while. This is put out by a take-it-or-leave it company 
which borders on a scam operation. The license (which you only get to read 
when you actually receive the disk,) includes language that says stuff like 
'by using the software you agree not to share your experiences with it to 
others' or some MS-level BS like that. Also, that the software is sold 'as 
is' and if nothing really works (and just about nothing does) then according 
to the license you're SOL, and thanks for the $99 bucks. (or $89, if it's "on 
sale"

I bought it using a credit card, and although the guy refused to refund my 
money, (although guaranteeing it over the phone,) my credit card company 
backed out the charges when I returned the software and filed a complaint. (I 
included screen shots of the website and emphaszed what LinuxCAD advertises 
itself to be able to do, then showd that is fails to perform as advertised.) 
The guy didn't contest it. 

Meanwhile, do a web-search of 'LinuxCAD' and 'fraud' and you'll see what I 
mean ...

Subject: [PLUG] [libc6, apache, db1, apache2] Aptitude screenshot - It can downgrade!
Message-ID: <87sn1nbubz.fsf@bittersweet.intra.hegbloom.net>

Had a little problem on drizzle today...  There is a security update
for `mailman', the list manager we use for these mailing lists.  I
went to upgrade it, and...

A recent packaging of `apache2-mpm-prefork' (from unstable Sid) was
partially installed and broken, requiring a reinstall before it could
be used or purged.  (When I had originally installed it, the build I
tried to install had a bug in the postinst or something.)  The next
build fixes the problem, but the next build requires a newer build of
`libc6'.  The build of `libc6' that it requires is now built without
`libdb1' compatibility support, which is required by the `apache'
(1.3) that runs the pdxlinux.org websites.

I heard about the "libc6" problem on irc.us.openprojects.net #debian
from "/msg apt news" and the topic line.  Had I not seen that, I may
have wound up with an unrestartable apache!  I do have
"apt-listchanges" installed, but the `libc6' changelog indicates that
no packages should be broken by it whos maintainer's had not been
notified.  Apparently, Ben Collins missed Apache's dependancy on the
libdb1 compatibility.  Is there a tool that could have gotten that
list automaticly???

This set of dependancy problems was blocking me from upgrading
`mailman' or anything else on the machine.  Note that on
drizzle.pdxlinux.org, the "/etc/apt/sources.list" contains entries for
stable Woody, testing Sarge, and unstable Sid.  An
"/etc/apt/preferences" control file is used to have the "apt" tools
choose stable Woody packages unless explicitly asked to install newer
builds.  (I really love the "preferences" mechanism!  Great design!)

"Simply" removing the testing Sarge and unstable Sid entries from
"sources.list" was NOT the solution.  Doing so made it impossible to
perform the upgrade of `apache2-mpm-prefork', since it was no longer
found in the package lists.  It could not "simply" be "dpkg
--purge"'d, because it was in broken and inconsistent state.  "dpkg"
refused and said that it needed to be reinstalled before I could purge
it.

The solution was to go ahead and let the Apt system upgrade `libc6'
and `apache2-mpm-prefork', and then to immediatly downgrade the libc
and purge apach2, so that the `libc6' installed will work with
`apache' (1.3).  This is important since our LUG web sites are running
on Apache 1.3 still, and probably will be for a few more whiles.

 <URL:http://people.pdxlinux.org/~karlheg/aptitude-can-downgrade.png>

Aptitude is a true UPGRADE to the venerable `dselect'.  It is
everything that dselect was, with most if not all of dselect's faults
fixed.  The upgrade was straightforward, and the new build of
`apache2-mpm-prefork' installed cleanly and all is A-Ok.  I then went
back and used "/" to search for "libc6", pressed "Enter" over it,
cursored down, and marked the older build for install.  I pushed "q"
to go back out to the top level, and then used "l" to limit the
display to only broken ("~b") packages.

I then selected the older build of the other libc related packages,
marked apache2 for purge, and located all other packages that depended
on the new libc6, marking them for either purge, downgrade, or hold.
I initially did this by hand, but as I write this, it occurs to me
that `aptitude' probably provides a better way to do it...  I think
that I could have used "l" to limit the display to "~Bdepends" and
thus obtained the list of packages that had unmep "depends".

The operation completed successfully, with no problems at all.  "ldd
$(which apache)" shows me that everything it needs will be there the
next time it restarts, also.  Excellent.  Time for lunch.  Time
elapsed: ~ 20 Minutes.

There are two types of enumerations: correct ones, that state what they are

Carla, I just tried this link. It worked the day you posted it, but
when I went back to it today, I got the Intel equivalent of ``file not
found". A link from developer.intel.com led to the exact same URL &
exact same error message.

Is the server cedar down? Have they moved the link & not gotten around
to updating their own website? Or should we blame this on <mode=churchlady>
Microsoft??? </churchlady>

interested in this email from Don Baccus.

Those who don't know anything about OpenACS (or don't care),

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  It's going to be some time
(two-three weeks?) before I get this up.  Typical bullshit, gotta update
PostgreSQL on my server, migrate a million bird sighting records I keep
for birders in the region, etc etc before I put up my own little website
with stuff like this presentation on that server.

In the interim, though, if you or anyone else wants to play with dotLRN
as deployed at Sloan/MIT, you're welcome to log in as a test user:

http://sloan.mit.edu

user e-mail: testguest at mit.edu
password: test

Feel free to make this info visible or otherwise publicize it and I'd
especially encourage the K12-linux folks to play around with it.  As a
test guest user you only have very limited access but enough to get some
idea of what's up.

I know the LA Unified School district is already planning some
deployments (for school-parent communication I believe), and about a
half dozen universities are working to deploy as well.

They are rolling out a site re-design. Everything was there an hour ago! See

Subject: [PLUG] Linux bootup arp request?
In-Reply-To: <20020808144513.52e7953c.mike@linuxlink.com>
Message-ID: <20020809225209.30080.qmail@web14407.mail.yahoo.com>

Apparently, when you boot up a Linux Redhat 7.3 box, it sends out
an arp request to see if anyone is using the IP address it has
assigned
to eth0. If it receives a reply, it does not enable eth0.

Normal behaviour, right?

However, this particular box is plugged into a Cisco PIX dmz. When
the Redhat box sends out the arp request, the PIX actually replies
back
with the MAC address of the Redhat box. Apparently, the Redhat box
doesn't
do any checking to see if the reply has its own MAC in it or not, it
just
doesn't bring up the interface at all if it gets a reply.

This is a problem, because if the Redhat box is rebooted in the DMZ,
it
will never come up on the network until it is unplugged from DMZ, the
network services restarted, then plugged back into the DMZ.

Is anyone familiar with this issue? Does anyone know how to change
this
behaviour in Redhat?

Thanks!

Sean Harbour

	Yes, you can set the reject_unknown_sender_domain restriction
under the smtpd_sender_restrictions parameter.  Note:   This does not
hard reject mail, but rejects is for now (remote end deferes till
later).  This is to protect against bouncing mail during a DNS outage.



I am running with the restrictions shown below (and some others done
later).  However, be *very* careful with

reject_invalid_hostname
reject_non_fqdn_hostname
reject_unknown_sender_domain
reject_non_fqdn_sender
reject_non_fqdn_recipient


Alot of broken MS mail clients don't handle these things correctly, it
is a good idea to understand exactly what each restriction does, and
test it with postfix in softbounce mode first.



smtpd_helo_required = yes
strict_rfc821_envelopes = no
smtpd_recipient_limit = 256
disable_vrfy_command = yes
allow_untrusted_routing = no

smtpd_client_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject_maps_rbl, check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/they_spammed_us.hash, permit

smtpd_helo_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject_invalid_hostname, reject_non_fqdn_hostname, permit

smtpd_sender_restrictions = permit_mynetworks,reject_unknown_sender_domain, reject_non_fqdn_sender, permit

smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject_unknown_recipient_domain, reject_non_fqdn_recipient, check_relay_domains

smtpd_etrn_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject

*NO*

The line you are quoting about IGNORE deals with regexp or pcre header
checks.  An expression tagged as IGNORE instead of OK or REJECT will
cause postfix to *IGNORE* that one line while parsing the rest of the
rules.  It allows you to do a more specific match against what would
be a false positive later, and ignore that one line without suspending
the rest of the filters.


If you change that rule to IGNORE, if that is the only rule that spam
is being rejected for, it will no longer be rejected.


BTW, look into the local_recipient_maps setting if you are receiving
alot of mail for non-existant users (and trying to send hundreds of
bounce messages to spammers bad return addresses).

That was the first thing that came to my ind too.  But everytheing else looks fine on the system.  If it was hacked, the hacker went through many pains to make sure I wouldn't see his tracks.

Today I logged back in and still, the .bash_history file size was 0.  So I blew it away. and then logged out and back in.  I executed some commands and then logged out and back in again.  Now my history is working properly again.  However, I am still stumped as to why it had the problem in the first place.

  Thanks, Christopher. I got that figured out after I sent the message.

  I need to read, again, how to implement local_recipient_maps. It'll do
what I need.

Any chance the file had read-only permissions on it? I tried this before 
and when there is no owner write permission on .bash_history, the file 
isn't updated at all. If the file is empty, it stays empty until owner 
write permission is set on the file.

Hi Stephen,

I have RH 7.2 and 7.3- I installed this with no trouble at all on the first 
try. Have you perhaps done a customized installation that left things out? I 
would first remove the RPMs you installed, then install gcc from your Red Hat 
disks. Use a graphical installer, like Kpackage, it makes it a lot easier to 
find things. Be sure to also install gcc- c++, and libstdc++ devel, all under 
Development.

Also install Ghostscript, under Publishing, this driver needs it.

# rpm -e [rpm name]

removes the rpm, append --nodeps if it whines about dependencies.

# which gcc

tells if it is installed

# gcc --version

shows which version is installed.

You probably know this, 'make install' must be done as root.

hope this helps!

Carla

Does anyone know how to turn this misfeature off?  In KDE2 I have a CD-ROM

Any suggestions?

I should add that so far Google has failed me.  This seems like a pretty
simple problem, the likes of which Google solves for me dozens of times a
day.  I even figured out how to create a CD icon, but it does not have any
option to turn off automounting.

Here are my failed Google attempts:

kde3 cdrom disable automount
konqueror disable automount
kde3 cdrom mount
redhat cdrom mount (this turned up a Redhat 7.3 doc that says that KDE
does not auto-mount CDs at all...)
+ others

Any ideas?

When you locate an RPM via "rpmfind", is there any guarantee of the
source of that rpm, as in, who built it?  Is there any quality control
or security control going on with that?  How do you know it's not a
trojan horse or just a poorly packaged rpm?

Good point.  They ARE built by human hands... not by quick and dirty
autowraps around the upstream makefiles that neglect silly things like
FHS (Filesystem Heirarchy Standard), stripping binaries, and <gasp>
policy compliance.  (well documented and public policy that is open to
modification through a defined process)

One of the biggest complaints I've heard about non-Debian
distributions is that the packagers often don't take the time to
ensure that files get installed to the correct locations, and things
like that.

Another gripe I have about RPM packages is that the documentation gets
installed with a version number appended to the directory name, like
"/usr/doc/trojanhorse-0.0.1-2", rather than as
"/usr/share/doc/trojanhorse".  With the version number appended like
that, each time you upgrade the software, the URL to the documentation
changes.  You have to update your bookmarks!

Perhaps if you run into trouble you can download the source and diff
from Debian, and see what they did.

I you do not put software and libraries under package manager control,
later on, when you update your machine, the package management system
does not find any dependancies on that library, and removes it.  It
does this to keep cruft from building up in your lib directories.

When you do need something, perhaps even a specific version of
something, you can use (oh, right, only on Debian) "equivs" (search
for it) to create a quick (5 minutes) pseudo package that declares the
dependancies for you, to keep the package manager from uninstalling
that library on you.

You can also use "aptitude hold" to put things on "hold" status, to
keep them from getting upgraded automaticly...  The man
apt_preferences mechanism also provides a way to pin a package at a
specific version.

<mass snippage>

Most Linux users test a number of distributions, and choose the one or ones 
that meet their needs. There are many features other than package management 
to consider. A whole flock of  'gee, too bad you don't have Debian!' posts 
are unhelpful. When a person has a problem to solve and can't get a job done, 
it's annoying to be told "oh you don't have the right Linux, if you did your 
troubles would be over." It's like the inevitable twit who rolls up when 
you're changing a flat tire- chock-full of advice on tire brands, but won't 
actually get out and lend a hand. 

A solution was posted that didn't require the original poster to switch to a 
different Linux and re-install their entire system, and there were several 
other posts with useful bits as well.

I guess the same way "you know it's not a trojan horse or just a poorly
packaged rpm" when you get it from the producer of the distribution of which
it's a part...

Check your ~/.kde/Autostart directory. There's an auto-mounter that gets
launched from there when you log in.

Yes, I am terribly impressed by your apt-cache printouts you have sent
today.  I mean geeze, who knew?

In recent years, Slackware users got the reputation as being the kind of
folks to answer every problem with 'get Slackware'.  Now I can see it
has moved to another distro.

You should realize, Karl, that Debian is *not* for everybody.  Slackware
isn't for everybody.  RedHat isn't for everybody, Mandrake isn't for
everybody.  Your multitude of apt-xxxx posts here have done nothing but
to say, "Hey, RedHat user, you're the biggest F'ing moron in the whole
world for not using Debian.  I am cool because I am using Debian.  See
what I can do with my Debian?  Aren't I cool?"

I've never actually wanted to filter out a poster on a mailing list
before... but geeze, you're making me want to look into it now.

Have a nice day.

Speaking of Slackware, slackware.com has been down for days. Anyone know why?

Anyone know where to buy a thin client locally or if it's possibly to just
take a desktop without a hard drive and do a wireless thin client? I need
to (ASAP) move where I compute from my office to somewhere else in the
house and I can't move my computer. Any ideas? All I want to do is export
display from my desktop.

It's probably simpler to use a desktop/laptop WITH a hard drive, install
linux on there, and use it as a simple X server.  I'd suggest using plain
ol' cat-5 wiring unless you already have all the wireless equipment.

What is the problem you're trying to solve?  What OS is on your desktop
that can't move?

It's looking that way. Looking cheaper too.

Well, cat-5 would definitely be easier, except that I do already have the
wireless AP. So all we're talking about at that point is buying another
card.

The problem is this. My wife needs the office. Which means I need to
relocate. There's no where in the house to relocate, that isn't a LONG
ways a way in terms of running cable. So my thought process was this. If I
have to be wireless, I'd rather not be wireless with my desktop. Reason
being that it's secure, stable and used for LOTS of stuff including SSH
server, web development server, java development, etc. So I frankly don't
want to mess it up trying to get a wireless card running on it and I'm
frightened about the idea of it being exposed wirelessly.

So, if I bought a thin client or a cheap PC that connected via wireless, I
could take THAT PC and connect to my desktop, using SSH, etc. That way the
data all remains on the desktop and the connection of the workstation
where I'm processing said data, to the data repository, is relatively
secure. The only thing slightly insecure would then be web surfing, etc.
Email, Usenet, programming, all of that would still be taking place on the
desktop via SSH.

So that's my thought process. I was thinking thin client would be cheaper
than PC, but I can't find anyone who sells thin clients and everywhere
online they're upwards of $350. So I'm thinking at this point it might be
cheaper to do a build-my-own box as cheap as humanly possible, slap Linux
on it and do it that way. Just so long as I can get the wireless card
running fairly easily.

I'm also looking at wireless (802.11a to be exact) but don't like the 
insecurity of it. Using IPSec over wireless would be the key, then
there'd be very little insecurity and no need for SSH. However, from
what I hear it may take some hours to get IPSec setup.

Okay, it's been twice in two months or so that I've come to find a 
particulat screensaver halted.  System ignores keyboard altogether,
and has dropped off the LAN (Destination Host Unreachable).

Only thing I didn't try was serial port login, but this workstation isn't 
set up for that--I think.  Anyway, was forced to do a hard reset--thank you 
ext3.  First thing I did was rpm -e xscreensaver.

Q: Cannot find any damning evidence in /var/log/messages nor /v/l/secure. 
Any ideas where I might find a clue.  I thought X kept a log in the user's 
home, but it's not to be found.

I really suspect the screensaver, but on the otherhand, how could a 
screensaver go so wrong as to bring down networking (lock up the kernel?)

I have a ThinkNIC, like so

http://www.thenicstore.com/nic/learnmore.html
$249, no HD.  Runs Linux off a CD.  Mainly a web kiosk, but there is (or 
was) ssh, xterm, citrix client, etc.  Of course you could burn your own CD 
and put what you want on it.  I just installed a 20G laptop drive.

There's a decent Yahoo group (if there is such a thing) here

grep xscreensaver /var/log/*

Might not be a bad idea.

Your X log should be in /var/log/XFree86.0.log ... although I would be
surprised if it had a lot of information.  If the system dropped off the
network, it was likely not caused by xscreensaver.  xscreensaver
shouldn't even be able to kill the system if it wanted to.  Since it
shoudln't ever be run as root, it is a fairly safe program.

The fact that you dropped off the network would imply the crash was
further down than just the screensaver layer.  Think like kernel
problems.  :-\

Since it sounds like your system is crashing outright, have you run 
Memtest-86 to see if you have any bad memory? I had some spectacular 
crashes because of a bad DIMM in my system. I have LILO setup so I can 
choose to run Memtest-86 rather then booting Linux so I can test my 
system's memory. Since the bad DIMM was replaced I haven't had anymore 
crashes.

I've also had X crash and/or hang outright but Linux keep running and 
the box was still reachable from the network so I could login and and 
kill X and then get back to running X from the consol again.

Likewise, no log entries of value.  My conclusion is that it is a hardware
failure.

My failures usually involve some OpenGL application running (game or
screensaver.)  So I had been thinking that the combo of an Athlon CPU, an
NVidia card (2MX) and heavy graphics use was doing it to me.  I recently
detuned my BIOS from AGP 4X to 2X; that seems to have helped considerably.

What are your hardware specs?

PIV 1.9GHz
512MB SDRAM
ATI Radeon 7200
Asus P4T-E MB

I'll run memtest, guess I'm in denial.  Wondering if this is all since I 
installed the latest RedHat Kernel (2.4.18-3).  Usually roll my own, but 
seldom get everything working as well as theirs.  Whether it the soundcard 
or usb, or whatever.

I have had lookups (that I still blame on X or something running on X) that 
I have been able to ssh in and kill gdm--not this this and that makes me mad.

I've had the same problems "for the longest time" with  that same vid.
card (ATI Radeon 64DDR+VIVO).  The drivers seem to be quite buggy, and
considering that ATI isn't (or hasn't been) very helpful with supporting
the linux/DRI driver it's not surprising.  I haven't had any problems for
quite a while now, though I'm not sure if it's due to the updated drivers
(XF4.2,kernel 2.4.19) or the fact that I've stopped trying to play any OGL
apps.  Whatever it is, my system is rock-solid now even with the kernel
compiled with -O3 -march=pentium3 -mmmx -msse -mfpmath, although I shouldn't
have said that....

Have you tried using the snapshot drivers from dri.sourceforge.net?  Also,
if it does it with enough regularity to make testing this worthwhile, try
disabling agpgart in the kernel and just running X non-DRI.

I don't know about the others, but you can set the these ones with stty if
you don't like the defaults.  I found this to be useful on HP-UX...

Or just get an old used laptop and use the Linux Terminal Server project 
code.

In my experience, "network computers" are more expensive and less flexible 
than just building it yourself.

NCD used to make the ThinSTAR line that worked pretty well, but they sold 
it off to someone and they are mostly dead at this point.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.44.0208101340510.17673-100000@eel.ENGR.ORST.EDU>

I've investigated some into the Center for Advanced Learning, the charter
school being built in Gresham. As you recall, the Oregonian reports how
the new school will pay Microsoft to become a Microsoft IT Academy [3].

Listed below are members of the committee that will decide the new
school's Information Technology curriculum. Would Pluggers be
interested in drafting a letter to the committee offering assistance in
the teaching of free software? It seems we could contribute a lot to such
a program; lesson plans, introductory courses for teachers, technical
assistance, and teachers themselves. We could also offer for a
representative of PLUG (David, Karl, etc) to be present at one of the
committee meetings to answer questions or propose ideas.

Assistance from our community could encourage the steering commitee
to incorporate more free software material into the curriculum than they
might otherwise. The charter school is also hiring technical instructors
and PLUG could serve as a good staff resource.

Listed below are members of the IT curriculum planning committee, as well
as contact information for Jim Buck, the committee facilitator. If David
Mandel or anyone could contact Jim that would be great. I personally plan
on contacting Morgan Anderson, the representative from Intel, and reporting
back with more information.

Subject: [PLUG] LILO and installing multiple distributions
Message-ID: <20020810223357.40567.qmail@web13302.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,
After playing around with slackware for awhile, I have decided to give
redhat7.3 distribution a try. 
 
I was amazed when installing slackware7.0, the ease that LILO was setup and
installed for my dual boot system.  I have three drives (C: and D: Windoze98,
E: Linux).  My concern is how the installation of redhat 7.3 (no, I don't want
to use grub) will affect my multiboot startup.  I want to retain my windows and
slackware distributions as well.  I would create another partition on my
E-drive for redhat.    
1. Has anyone had any problems with LILO under such installations of multiple
distributions? Whose "lilo.conf" file would have precedence?
2. How would using the new ext3 file system affect the current ext2 filesystem
I have under slackware 7.0 - including the FAT32 partitions?  
3. Just to make sure, may I use the same partition (mount point) for swap space
I have allocatated under slackware for redhat?  

Many thanks
-dennis

You would think so, but X has just a little to much access to the kernel,
I have had a number of system crashes over the years that were due to
problems with X.  My most recent was just a couple days ago, I setup a
"new" system (old parts from around the office) to use as a test bed,
installed the latest stable Debian, as soon as gdm starts up, it takes
the system down (at least five times in a row).  Having had previous
problems with gdm and system stability, I switched the system to using xdm
(no packages were installed/uninstalled, all I did was make a one line
configuration change to use xdm as the default instead of gdm), and it
boots/runs just fine every time.

Correct me if I am wrong, but a lot of the editing shortcuts are based
on what your default editor is.  In your case, the default editor
appears to be emacs but if it is vi then the commands would be
different.

You are correct. Emacs is the Bash default, so a user savvy enough to change 
the default editor will know the keybindings will change too.

Subject: [PLUG] laptop config problem
Message-ID: <200208101741.58806.kyle_hayes@speakeasy.net>

Hi folks,

Anyone with Linux laptop config experience out there?

Here's what I've got:

Panasonic CF-62 
Pentium 133
32MB RAM
1.2GB HD
SCSI CD-ROM (yes!)
Optical Drive (yes!)

This thing was top of the line about 6 years ago.  The optical drive makes 
it weigh more than the usual boat anchor.

The PCMCIA controller is by Ricoh, but is listed as revision 0.

I'm trying to make this thing into a nice little portable X-terminal.  
That's about all I think it's worth these days.  Even my firewall has more 
memory.

I've been beating my head against the wall trying to get the PCMCIA system 
to work.  I'm using SuSE 8.0 which offers the "new" in-kernel PCMCIA or 
the old (Dave Hinds') pcmcia-cs package.  I've tried both.  Everything 
else seems to be fine (I'm not happy with the X color depth, but I think 
it's a solvable problem).

I think I've got the memory ranges correct in the PCMCIA config.opts file.  
However, the interrupts are a serious problem.  When I insmod the 
pcmcia_core stuff and the i82365 modules, no PCI interrupt routing table 
shows at all.  Generally this means that Linux has no idea where and what 
the routing table looks like.  This table is needed to route the 
interrupts from the PCMCIA cards to the PCI interrupts.

I have a new Realtek 8139 (8139too.o driver) that is recognized by the 
driver.   However, it always aborts saying that there is no interrupt or 
that "Region #1 is not MMIO...".

The core modules, when inserted, will show interrupts only if I manually 
pass them on the command line.

I've gone through the PCMCIA HOWTO many times and it strongly appears that 
the PCI interrupt routing mechanism on this laptop is totally unknown to 
Linux.  The recommendation is to start trying PCI interrupts until one 
works :-(

An added difficulty is that I have no known way to get to the BIOS on this 
beastie.  I have to keep a small Windows partition on it to run a little 
program that lets me set interrupts for the PCMCIA slots etc.  I've tried 
that, but Linux still doesn't see them.

I've gotten close a few times where cardmgr actually will beep when I 
insert a card, but the driver never works.

Does anyone have any ideas.  I've been working on this over the weekends 
for several weeks now and I'm not closer than when I started.

Best,
Kyle

Not quite.  I mean that your editor is irrelevant.

The shell movement commands are set in the shell options (SHELLOPT), which
can be viewed with `set -o`.  Two of those options (which are mutually
excusive) are "emacs" and "vi".  "emacs" defaults to on (leaving
"vi" off) in an attempt to standardize editting and movement across the
GNU system.

One can switch their shell to the vi editting style by issuing the
following command:
set -o vi

The lilo.conf which has precedence is the one on the distribution from
which you last ran the lilo command.  This does not necessarily mean that
it will override lilo on the other distribution, each one could (depending
on how they are configured) simply modify things relating to their own
boot/root partition and leave the other alone, though most likely in their
default configurations there will be some collisions between them.

Don't know, I've been using reiser and don't know the effect of ext3 on
ext2 file systems.

Swap partition formats are pretty generic and while there have been a few
minor format changes over the years, I believe the new kernels can handle
all the old format variations, so as long as both distributions are
running roughly comparable kernel revisions (both from the same major
revision number), or the distribution that was used to format the swap
partition uses an older kernel version than the other distribution, you
shouldn't have any problems sharing it between them.

over 2 hard drives:

Scroll down to Multi-booting Linux Distros.

Works like a charm.

Hi,
After playing around with slackware for awhile, I have decided to give
redhat7.3 distribution a try. 
 
I was amazed when installing slackware7.0, the ease that LILO was setup and
installed for my dual boot system.  I have three drives (C: and D: Windoze98,
E: Linux).  My concern is how the installation of redhat 7.3 (no, I don't want
to use grub) will affect my multiboot startup.  I want to retain my windows 
and
slackware distributions as well.  I would create another partition on my
E-drive for redhat.    
1. Has anyone had any problems with LILO under such installations of multiple
distributions? Whose "lilo.conf" file would have precedence?
2. How would using the new ext3 file system affect the current ext2 filesystem
I have under slackware 7.0 - including the FAT32 partitions?  
3. Just to make sure, may I use the same partition (mount point) for swap 
space
I have allocatated under slackware for redhat?  

Many thanks

 I once had a similar problem w/ .bash_history, it turned out that my
chmod for the file was 000, in other words I had no read and write 
permissions for it.

click "OK"
No Printout

 From "Test" dropdown list select "A4 Postscript TestPage" and the click "OK"

No Printout

Changed the model to HP DeskJet 690C and conducted another TEST but still 
NO RESULT

(Remark : I am not allowed to make change to this model")



I think the problem comes from "ghostscript-7.05-2.i386.rpm".  This version 
is not suitable.  However I have no idea to find out the packages for 
generating the dependencies for the installation of

ghostscript-7.05-16.i386.rpm

and

ghostscript-7.05-17.alpha.rpm

Which is the correct mailing list of "www.linuxprint.org" for posting "HELP"

The following entry showed up this morning. I'm concerned that it's a message 
indicating that my server relayed mail, which I don't want it to do. I've hacked 
the addrresses slightly. I can send mail from that server, that's why sendmail is 
installed on it. I haven't sent an e-mail from it for quite some time.

I'm trying to install Linux onto a 500 Celeron system and keep getting
kernel panic errors. I have tried to use several different
distributions, all of which give the same message. I did manage to get
an old version of MDL for 486 to install but I only have 320x200
resolution(quite unworkable as far as viewing pleasure is concerned). It
also appears that a Redmond Linux disk is loading properly. These are
disks that I downloaded and burned and have used them to install on
other machines.
Any clues?

Perhaps the kernel you are attempting to install was built with
compiler switches instructing the compiler to use op codes for a
specific model of CPU that is not compatible with the one your machine
uses?  Given that other Linux disks boot and work fine, I would say
that's what it might be.

Try a Debian install CD.  I have a copy if you want it.

Looks normal to me... since "mail.isp.com" is likely the mail server
where "mikedela at isp.com" receives his mail.  RTFM Sendmail (Bat Book
or online) and you'll find information about what that log entry
means.

Alex,

Does the kernel get to recognizing the hard drive?  
Where exactly does the kernel panic?

A little more information please.  Linux works on almost anything, even 
Celerons.

Go grab a copy of memtest86, and see what it says.

I'd been having some panics of my own recently that I thought might have 
been my scsi controller, but I finally found my old memtest disc while 
cleaning up my desk and decided to plop it in.

Lo and behold I had tons of errors right after the 256M boundary.  Go 
figure.

Give that a go.

Is the kernel you are running patched in any way?

Recently I was having lockup problems.  I had patched my kernel with
EVMS, XFS, and the preemptible kernel patch.  The preempt patch is
what did it, since it did not contain any fixups for the EVMS or XFS
code that are not part of the standard kernel.

I am trying to take on old Pentium 100 (NEC) running Win 95a and put Red Hat
7.1 on it in a dual boot configuration. The CD ROM isn't bootable, so I'm using
a "disk driver" to get the ball rolling.

The CD start whirring and the intstalll appears to be going down, but after
a couple of minutes I get the following:

"...waiting for X servre....

Gdk - error ** Fatal IO error 104 (connection reset by peer) on X servre :1


install exited abnormally

sending termination signals

sending kill signals

disabling swap

unmounting filesystems
  /mnt runtime

..."


Any ideas what might be happening?

Thanks again in advance Linux community.....

Well, the answer may have been found! Seems that I may have thousands of
errors with this sdram. Two 64Mb sticks and it looks like I may be
replacing both of them. I guess you can't ask for much for $27 and free.

It sounds to me like RedHat's lovely X-based install won't work with
your system.  No matter what you do, it is going to run very slow on a
Pentium 100.  Very slow!

What you need to do is do the text-based install thing.  I think there's
a choice when RedHat boots (there was back when I tried it last).  If
not, I'm sure a RH expert here will have an idea on what to do.  :-)

Good luck!

Just type "text" at the prompt and hit Enter for the curses-based installer.

I normally refrain from "me too" responses to mail list postings, but I 
find myself agreeing with Rob's sentiments.  These postings of Karl's are 
an example of religious zeolotry that grates on my nerves.  Never in the 8 
years of using Internet services have I kill-filed anyone.  And I am 
seriously considering this.  Which truly would be a shame as Karl is 
obviously a sharp guy and does contribute many good things to the PLUG 
community.

A great place to start is the Linux Documentation Project:

  http://www.tldp.org/

In particular, this multi-boot howto might be of help:

I figured it out. I believe the compiled in modem initialization doesn't 
work for this modem so you have to specify the init in the config or on 
the mgetty command line. My specification of the init chat was 
syntactically incorrect but when I passed the init via the command line 
the modem and mgetty would listen for the call.

Message-ID: <200208121236.58714.satimis@writeme.com>

Hi Carla

!!! PROBLEM SOLVED !!!!

New Printer installed.  It is not necessary to update "ghostscript".  
Procedure as follows:

On KDE

K_Start -> System -> CUPS Printer Configuration

to start "Common UNIX Printing System - Konqueror window" and then click 
"Manage Printers"

- click "ADD Printer" -> "Add New Ptinter"
- Fill_in
Name   DJ690C (Name_of_your_printer you expect to display)
Location   /dev/lp0 (zero, not capital 'o')
Description   HP DeskJet 690C (Description_of_your_printer)

- Continue -> Continue
-Select   
Device   Paraport #1 for DJ690C

- Continue
- Select
Make   HP

- Continue
- Select
Model    HP DeskJet 690C Foomatic+hpijs(en)
                                                     ^^^^^
(It is important to find out the applicable printer driver from HP website)

- Continue
Printer DJ690C has been added successfully

- Click "Printers on ESP bar
- Click "Print Test Page"

That is all, printer installation finished.

Hoping that other folks on the list can read this message understanding the 
step-by-step procedure to install a new printer on KDE environment.

Thanks

Stephen

 I checked the permissions when it was messed up and a ls -al showed me that the permissions were 600.  So I did have read/write permissions to the file.  Anyway, it is back to normal now.

There's /dev/zero and /dev/random, but no /dev/one.  Does anyone know
of an easy way from the command line to generate a stream of 0xff bytes?
Clearly it would be easy to write a program to do this, but I wonder
if there is an existing tool that will do what I want.

Subject: [PLUG] Printing speeds
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0208120855130.3473-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Back in the happy days when WordPerfect/8 worked as it should (i.e., up
until earlier this year), printing a processed bunch of words was a quick
job on my HP LaserJet 5. The printer is capable of 12 pages per minute
throughput and that's the speed at which WP docs were printed. Now that I've
switched to OpenOffice, print speed is back down to the level of my LaserJet
4P, about 3-4 ppm.

  It seems to be a function of the application feeding postscript output to
the system and ghostscript then translating it before handing the output to
the printer. Which brings up the question of what -- if anything -- I can do
to increase printing speed.

  If a postscript card is still available for the LJ 5, would that make a
difference and increase throughput? Are there other options available to me?

TIA,

Rich

This came up within the last two weeks at either alt.os.linux.slackware,
the TACLUG list, or this list....

I believe the final outcome was if you want it, it would be pretty easy
to add it to the kernel and manually make the device file.  Google might
help find the final outcome, I dunno.....

What is the kernel panic message?

My guess is that you have bad memory or some other hardware problem.

Get a copy of memcheck86 and see if the memory is working correctly.

Thanks everyone. In the end, crunched for time, I bought an x86 box at
Fry's for $250. It's up and running wirelessly now. Of course, it's got
some free space and it's a secondary PC, so I'm tempted now to try
FreeBSD.. hmmm....

How do you set the default editor?  I thought these worked directly from

Note the last two lines.  I don't know DNS too well, but when I ping
www.christianecology.org, I get IP 206.168.68.228, one of the servers at
fone.net; though christianecology.org gives the correct IP.  Even
wierder, on Friday, it was the exact opposite.  So I'm growing dubious
of the admin in charge of this domain, and I was hoping someone here
could check his work.

He says it's a caching issue, but in the first place, he also said the
last changes were made before the weekend; and second,
www.christianecology.org was working before and should not have been
changed.  I now get the wrong IP from at least two different DNS
servers.  Can someone confirm this?

Thanx.

Kpackage supports apt-get. I've never tried it, so I have no idea how well it 
works.

Any package manager is constrained by the availability of someone to build 
the packages. For example, new KDE releases do not find their way into Red 
Hat RPMs very quickly, they put more energy into Gnome.

Any more I build from source, for me it is less hassle. I've actually had 
fewer dependency hassles with tarballs. I don't go looking for off-the-wall 
or obscure apps to play with, but stick with quality, well-known apps, so 
that may have something to do with it.

It seems to me distro-centric package managers are a good thing. In theory, 
you get packages tailored for your distribution. As Linux matures, this 
should evolve into a dependable, polished process.

I has always been a snap for me to upgrade an ext2 to ext3.  I think that
you can even read an ext3 as an ext2 if you just ignore the journal.  The
directions to convert between ext 2 & 3 are on the web, just google it.
You can even do it while the partition is mounted.  I believe the command
is tune2fs, and you give the -j option, something like that.  I don't
think FAT32 can get in on the action.  Just leave it alone.  BTW, you may
need to recompile your kernel to make sure it supports ext3, and you may
want to update /etc/fstab, again, check with google.

My understanding was that it is basically just a partion of the disk you
don't care about, and that the data is not kept between uses of the OS.
So even if they had different formats they could just reinitialize the
partion when they boot up (in the worst case).  But I may have missed
something.

You are correct, the swap partition contents are irrelevant once you
reboot, though it hadn't occurred to me to just reformat it on reboot
if there are compatibility issues, not sure if this is a good or bad
idea, but it would certainly work.

Does perl count as an existing tool?

perl -n0e 'print ~$_' < /dev/zero  might work.

Beable is a linux kernel module to provide a /dev/one. Requires tweaking
for a 2.4 kernel it seems.

http://www.bitclean.com/download.shtml

Wouldn't it be easier though to write a script to write out binary 1's? Or
read in your zeroes via dd and perform bitwise negation?

$foo=readpipe("dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=4"); print ~$foo;

Here's info on decompiling Microsoft Help Documents into html. This may
be useful if you prefer to read Microsoft SDK stuff on a non-Windows

The following page contains some info how to install MSHelp2 SDK without VS.NET:
http://www.helpware.net/mshelp2/h2faq.htm
You can decompile help files (extract HTML etc) using compiler included in
the SDK (hxcomp) with -u option.
If you have VS.NET there is a special help project type for decompilation.

To all,

Regarding giving a user account to acces their files in the linux box, where
do I edit the file permissions and restrictions for their files.  Where do I
set the ownership of the file.  Another thing about the root account, there
were three of us who knows the root passwd.  If  I log in as root and one of
them or both of them log in also as root would I be able to determine if how
many has login as root.  How would is send a message to them.
	Hope anyone could help me!
	Thanks

GETTING THE MS .NET DOC TO WORK ON LINUX
========================================


1. Get the Help SDK and extract it to a temp directory.
http://download.microsoft.com/download/VisualStudioNET/Install/2.1/NT45XP/EN
-US/VSHIK.exe

2. If you don't have VS.NET get this, too and unzip it to the same
directory. http://www.sojdr.com/vshik/patch_vshik_setup.msi.zip

3. Change to that directory and run "patch_vshik_setup.msi.vbs", a
VB-Script. Then run Setup.exe

4. Create a new directory with at least 250 MB on your HD.

5. Change to it and type

"C:\program files\Microsoft Help 2.0 SDK\hxcomp.exe" -u C:\program
files\Microsoft.N
ET\FrameworkSDK\Docs\1031\cpref.HxS

at the command line. Your path may be a bit different.

This can take some time.

6. You will have some files in it and a sub-directory called "html" as well
as "Scripts".
Copy the file dtue.css in "Scripts" one dir level higher, that it is one dir
above "html".

7. Rename it to style.css

8. Copy the php-script convert.php (I've attached it again) in the same
directory and run it (not with Browser, of course!).
This can take 25 minutes.

9. Your done. Move the html directory and the style.css to another location
(or to linux) and point your Browser (Mozilla works well) to
"html/cpref_start.htm"

NOTICE: Most links will work, some not, because they don't point to html
files, but MS HELP 2.0 commands.
However, they are not the important ones.

ALSO NOTICE: While you perhaps might extract the html, MS will not like to
see the result copied somewhere and modified .They have coprights on it.
So don't do it (or don't tell them ;-)

I open another xterm and use the w command agian

Now to answer back

$ write revans  pts/0

On pts/0 I get 

Message from revans at localhost on pts/1 at 23:04 ...
what

control c to end the conversation at one end. Another control c at the other
end to stop that sesion.

I don't think this can work in a three way conversation. You could have two one
on one conversations but the two others involved would not know what the other
was writing. If you want a three way conversation you will have to run some
type of server. There are many servers that can do this and the merits of which
type of server to use for this senario is beyond my experience.

ytalk, an updated multi-user version of talk, can handle 3-way
conversations. Plus it's backwards compatible with talk. write is nice,
but not as intuitive as *talk, plus you don't get to watch people type in
realtime. Of course there's always "wall", and if you're already logged
in as root, why resist the urge? :)

echo "LAST WARNING-User accounts being reformatted in 1 minute, move your data NOW." | wall

Someone's going to admonish you for this, so I might as well take the
first stab. There are two problems here.

1) You don't need to share root's account to give users root privileges
2) You or the users may be logged in as root for no legitimate reason.

Instead of sharing an account, you can use programs like "sudo".


Hope this helps.

Hello Folks,

There will be a Linux install Clinic this Saturday at the new Riverdale
High School! The twist this time is that you get to help us install
computers. ;-) 1:00 - 4:00 pm.

I'm sure we'll still have time to work on your projects too so bring
along your computers for installs and help with Linux configurations.

The new location is at 9806 SW Boones Ferry Rd. in SW Portland. In
simple terms we are actually on SW Terwilliger just before Tryon Creek
park and the Lewis & Clark law school.

Yahoo maps can tell you better than I.

For those of you using Tri-Met you can get to us on the 39 Lewis & Clark
line.

I'd like to understand Sun's position better. My (weak) understanding is 
that they make most(all?) of their profit on the service agreements on 
their large, powerful systems. With the x86 architecture pushing the 
speeds that it is, Sun is seeing quite the competition from this front 
with clusters of these processors. Now I hear that Sun is coming out with 
some x86 based workstations. Are they really going to compete with the 
likes of Dell, HP/Compaq, Gateway, and everyone else? Are they going to 
get sales for these from their current customers that have big Sun iron 
and service agreements? In addition, Sun is introducing a linux 
distribution (http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t272-s2120751,00.html), 
which is an "enhanced" RedHat 7.2. This will be included with their Linux 
server offering and be available for free download. They say in the story 
that support is the issue they are solving.

So, I see Sun's high end market shrinking. I see Sun trying to get into 
the low end x86 market. And, I see them jumping into the Linux distro 
fray.

What are your thoughts?

Well, I work at Sun, and so - I do have a bit of insider information.  I 
can't share it, unfortunately...  This is, after all, a public list.

However, what I can say is that Sun is doing quite well in the high-end 
server market, and that any offshoots are simply positioning to get the 
maximum amount of market penetration.  If you have Sun on the high-end, 
you can also have Sun on the low-end, and everywhere in between.

a. Yes, and speedily at that :-)

b. http://www.freebsd.org/

If you've got a decent DSL or cable-modem connection to the Internet, 
you won't need a CD. Just grab the images for the installation disks 
and do the installation over the Net. On any FreeBSD ftp mirror, take 
a look at the installation README:

  .../releases/i386/4.6-RELEASE/floppies/README.TXT

Grab the floppies; do a dd; reboot; install!

Has anyone ever gotten squirrel mail to work with the rpm on mandrake?

I got it up... but I can't seem to get passed the login.

 can connect WinXP for files sharing
Message-ID: <5.1.1.6.0.20020814002012.00b85e98@pop.net-yan.com>

Hi All Folks.

I encountered following problem

WinXP can't connect Samba_Server but Samba_Server can connect WinXP for 
files sharing

WinXP box and Samba_Server are connected directly via a crossover cable as 
experiment.  Firewall of WinXP is off and ipchains on Samba_Server also off.

(Remark: The WinXP box has been tested via direct connection with a 
crossover cable to a WinME box/Win98 box for files transfer.  No problem found)

Static IP address
Samba_Server (RH7.3)    192.168.0.1
                   Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0
WinXP                   192.168.0.2
                   Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0

On Window Exploror. SEC and M40G shown up under MSWindows Network.  But 
IWILL disappears

Thanks for the input. I totally understand your NDA responsibilities and I 
agree with you on the market penetration, that's the name of the game.

I have not tried SHARE. You might try setting that to USER and then make 
sure you are logging in to the XP box with the same username and password.

The hostname command returns the machine's own host name, In this case the 
line with 127.0.0.1. The second field should be a Fully Qualified Domain 
Name (FQDN) and the third the host part like this:

127.0.0.1	server.abcxyz.com	server

Does this mean you use FreeBSD? I'm trying it out right now on my second
computer. Trying to see if there are any pros/cons to using IT as a

Just get the source at squirrelmail.org, it's all PHP files with a Perl
based config...easy to setup.  I have it working on my server and use it
as my primary e-mail client.  Works great.

I need to round a floating point number up to the next

Here's my first attempt:

if (int($score) != $score) {

Is there a more clever way?

Yes, ceil(). That wasn't obvious in the Perl books

  Makes sense to me. Since the sun _does_ set on the British Empire now,
they left an empty niche, So, Sun stepped in to fill that void. "The sun
never sets on a Sun server."

Ed,

  Back in the Old Days, before BCD and large-integer math, we just added 0.5
to the float value, then rounded. I believe that the standard C library
rounds up; truncate would "round" down.

Well, I'm finally getting back to working on this. (Had to take
advantage of the weather to refinish the decks.)

The machine in question is running RH 7.1 from the K12LTSP disks of
about a year ago.

Ok. I'm giving Carla's suggestion a try. I've got the tarball and I'm
reading INSTALL. Step 1 says to be sure that I have GTK+ and GLIB
installed. When I run gtk-config --version and glib-config --version I
get the following:

1.2.10

INSTALL tells me that I need versions 1.2.0 or above, so these should be
all right. But, INSTALL goes on to say that Red Hat users will need to
install a "gtk-devel" .rpm. rpm -q gtk-devel says "package gtk-devel is
not installed." I went to rpmfind.net and got gtk-devel.rpm. When I try
to install it with:

rpm -i gtk-devel.rpm

I get 13 conflict notices. They all say that some file "conflicts with
file from package gtk+-devel-1.2.10-ximian.10." I'm guessing that when
they said I needed a "gtk-devel" .rpm, they were being generic and that
the 1.2.10 version of gtk+-devel is OK.

I moved on and ran ./configure. I get the error message "UCD SNMP header
files found, but sprint_realloc_objid not found in SNMP library." One of
INSTALL's options is to run ./configure with "--without-ucdsnmp." The
description says, "If 'configure' finds a supported version of the UCD
SNMP library on your system, the SNMP dissector will be enhanced to use
routines from that SNMP library. Use this switch to avoid using the UCD
SNMP library even if you have it installed." So, I re-ran ./configure
using --without-ucdsnmp and it completed. 

Do I care about this? Should I try to find and install whatever is
missing so that my "SNMP dissector will be enhanced?"

Since ./configure --without-ucdsnmp completed, I'm assuming that the
gtk+-devel package was suitable for this project.

I went ahead and ran make. INSTALL helpfully says, "Hopefully, you won't
run into any problems." Apparently, there weren't any problems. There
were a couple of warnings, but I ran ./ethereal and was able to capture
some traffic between my various machines. I ran make install, and make
install-man. I logged back in as an ordinary user. As expected, ethereal
runs, but won't capture packets unless I su to root before running it.

Thanks to all for all your suggestions, and especially to Carla for
encouraging me to try installing something from source.

In some ways, a BSD system will look and feel exactly like Linux. Most 
of your normal activity as a user won't be visibly affected.

When it comes to system administration, however, there are some fairly 
huge differences. Probably the best place to start is the FreeBSD 
Documentation Project:

  http://www.freebsd.org/docproj/

Among its offerings, the best complete introduction is the FreeBSD
Handbook, available in a dead-tree edition from amazon.com and for no 
cost online:

  http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/index.html

Also, let me take an opportunity to plug "The FreeBSD Corporate
Networker's Guide" by local author Ted Mittelstaedt:

  http://www.freebsd-corp-net-guide.com/

It's not really intended as a general introduction to FreeBSD, but it 
includes some nice stuff for admins looking to replace any existing 
Windows infrastructure with FreeBSD.

To avoid this headache next time, I'd suggest grabbing the matching 
-devel.rpm from your distro instead of the wild world of rpmfind.  And 
definately install the same version of both--they weren't being generic.  As 
you saw, bad things can happen.

I'm going to give cfengine a whirl and grabbed the latest release from 
http://cfengine.org . The source compile is giving me the following error:

checking Berkeley DB Version... configure: error: This release of cfengine
requires BerkeleyDB 3.2 or later

This system is the RedHat Limbo beta and it has:
db4-4.0.14-11
db4-devel-4.0.14-11
db4-utils-4.0.14-11

Which is the BerkeleyDB. I can't quite figure out how to get cfengine to 
work with this. I tried looking at the configure script but it looks greek 
to me.

Any hints on getting past this?

thanks,

The essential difference between GNU emacs and Xemacs is that the Xemacs
team refuses to get proper copyright clearance for their submissions and
simply trust that their GPL status will hold out while various developers
go their separate ways while submissions to the GNU emacs project are
signed over to the Free Software Foundation and assured to remain Free for
all time.

The interesting side-effect here is that while XEmacs is free to lift code
from the GNU Emacs tree, GNU Emacs cannot do the same in reverse.

Personally, I'd go with GNU.  They won't do you wrong.

See my message from Saturday.  It's unrelated to your default editor.

However, many utilities and tools do gather some information from the
EDITOR and VISUAL environment variables.

Just to make something fairly clear, there's not a single x86 server
manufacturer that can compete with Sun systems for plain old reliability
and durability.  Even the few NEBS compliant systems you CAN find that run
an x86 architecture will fail when dropped from a few feet.  You can
launch a Sun out of a goddamn cannon without dropping an instruction.

You can either try

a. installing the db3 and db3-devel rpms (from limbo or another Red 
   Hat release), or

b. hacking the cfengine configure script to look for the db headers 
   and libs in whatever location the db4-* packages install them.

Personally, I'd try a. before b.

Not really, that I know of.  I use GNU Emacs myself.  I think XEmacs
had better font support for a long time, if that matters to you.  I am
not sure how much of a difference there still is today.  XEmacs has
had something of a reputation (deserved or not, I can't say) with
being less concerned about the quality of patches that got in.  That's
basically all I "know" about the distinction (besides some technical
legal issues).

Thanks Jeme, that's the product knowledge I just don't have. What about
all the x86 linux clusters I keep reading about? They seem plenty 
powerful. Are they used for totally different situations than the Sun 
systems? Are they more expensive? less?

Mostly the issues are political.  Technical aspects have slowly emerged
from that.

I tend to use which ever one was released most recently.  In this case I
feel that emacs21 is "ahead" of xemacs21 or whatever number they are on.

When I was working a contract at Boeing, we had our, as of yet unused, 
production server die several times from hardware failures. Generally 
I've been pleased with Sun's reliability and this was the first time I 
had ever seen a hardware failure on a Sun machine.

Where can I get one of these computer launching cannons?  There have been

Those clusters are based on cheap, expendable hardware.  Probably less 
than $500/box.  I spec'ed out a relatively modest Ultra 10 on the Sun 
Store, and it came to over $2500, even with my 45% discount.

In my experience, Sun hardware is used in cases where reliability is of 
crucial importance.  24/7 high-availability servers and the like.  Like 
Jeme said, 'Shot out of a cannon...'  They're definitely not 
consumer-level boxes.

Note that the "assignment" to FSF isn't really the important part of
this, it is the "getting your employer to sign off" part that is
important in the "Free for all time" category.  That's what gives you
the right to put it under the GPL to begin with.  The FSF is just
being conservative and using its refusal to take patches/contributions
without the assignment as a motivator for getting the important
document signed.  At least, that's how I've always understood the
issue.

XEmacs was formerly Lucid emacs and developed largely or in part by Jamie
Zawinski.  On his site he says:

"Before Netscape, I was primarily to blame for Lucid Emacs, the next
generation of the GNU Emacs text editor / development environment / lisp
system / religion. Lucid finally managed to go bankrupt, and lucid.com was
melted down for scrap metal shortly thereafter. You can find the latest
version of lemacs, now called XEmacs, at www.xemacs.org. (Click here for
further evidence of why cooperation with RMS is impossible.)"

Okay, one more question. I setup a second computer to export the desktop
from my main computer. That's the computer on which I installed FreeBSD.
When I export X in SuSE it fires up a bunch of libraries. Will it be
possible to export to FreeBSD or do I need to isntall those libraries? Can
I install those libraries? Also, I bought a couple apps (Quanta Pro, Star
Office for SuSE). Is it easy to install Linux apps on FreeBSD or is
compatibility for commercial software like that pretty low?

I haven't used XEmacs in a number of years now but I did use it when I 
first starting using Emacs. It had all the pulldown menus and other 
stuff which made it easy to use and learn. Later on I switched to emacs 
as I didn't need all of the extra pulldowns and stuff even though emacs 
has its fair share of drop down menus now.

Since many of my jobs over the years have required me to use a Windows 
machine I tend to now favor GNU emacs since it runs under both Windows 
and Unix. It even handles Windows textfiles properly with the CR/LF 
line terminators. I've seen some mixed environments get screwed up when 
someone edits a Windows textfile on Unix and lines are terminate with 
LF characters only. 

With emacs it didn't seem to matter what platform was used to edit the 
file as it seemed to do the right thing on either platform from what I 
remember. I did most of my editing from a Sun box since all of our 
files were in Clearcase and the Sun box was also our view and VOB 
server.

I guess where there might be a problem is if the file was originally 
created on Unix but was used on Windows.

I wanted something different. I wanted to round up if there
was a fractional part, regardless of the value of the fractional
part. My code (in Perl) did that but there's a POSIX function
called ceil() that did it without the additional test:

$score = ceil($score);

Sorry about the date there, I had to roll my system back to the 18th to
fool a program into working for me.  ;-)

Sure, I should just buy it, but they want $70 for it.  And that is with
a student discount!

I smell a device driver/kernel patch....Maybe it could be completely
usermode....or just hack glibc.  Maybe you would have a config file, like
~rob/.clockrc and when executable x asks for the date, you return a
specific date, with current time.

Any ideas on the easiest way to hook into the system calls to accomplish
this?  Of course applications could probably just create a file and test
the date if they want to get around this, so it might take some careful
thought to fool a "smart" program....or perhaps you could change the
system call for checking the date of a file too.

The fun you could have confusing make...

FreeBSD is capable of using RPMs...the support isn't the greatest, but it is 
pretty cool....what do you mean as far as 'exporting'? you can do the old X 
display stuff, and run the apps on the remote box....or you can get those 
apps working under FreeBSD....

I'm not sure about StarOffice on FreeBSD, however I use OpenOffice (FreeBSD 
4.6) pretty regularly...it works pretty well

Apart from the above politcal considerations (on which I will not
comment) there are several fundamental technical differences between
the two, including how each renders fonts.  From what I understand
(and this is entirely from evesdropping on the various newsgroups)
Emacs 21, which just came out a little while ago, has moved
significantly toward Xemacs in its functionality in various areas.

Take a look at 

http://www.xemacs.org/About/XEmacsVsGNUemacs.html

to see the technical differences from the xemacs developers point of view.
This link is with regards to Emacs 20 but they appear (from my 5 second scan)
to say things about Emacs 21 as well.

My general feeling is the xemacs is (a bit) more technically advanced
but that emacs is (a bit) more solidly built.

You can also google on `emacs xemacs' and get a boatload of links
to peruse.

Dean

P.S. For what it's worth I use Emacs.  I tried to switch to xemacs a
year ago but I carried too much Emacs baggage with me to be
successful.  For a newbie, or for someone coming back and not (yet)
having a zillion little emacs-isms built into his fingers, it
probably doesn't make much difference.

Subject: [PLUG] Printer Install Help Please
Message-ID: <3D59880F.1DEF5514@attbi.com>

Flush from my success installing ethereal, I decided that I would
finally try installing a printer on one of my Linux machines. I recently
purchased an HP 656c based partly on finding it on the linuxprinting.org
supported list and mostly on the price (really cheap). I'm running RH
7.1. 

I started by trying to use Webmin. Very nice, but it didn't allow for a
USB connected printer.

I went to the linuxprinting.org web site and found a lot of unreachable
pages. I found a mirror site in Portland and started reading. In the
quick start section they recommend following the distribution's
instructions, so I went to the Red Hat site and started reading:

http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-7.1-Manual/getting-started-guide/printconf.html

Very straight forward, until I get to the part where I'm supposed to
select the printer driver. The 656c is probably too new to be on that
list. Taking things one step at a time, I applied the selection with
PostScript queue on local device /dev/usb/lp0, giving the queue the
alias, hp656, and watched lpd restart. I ran a test page, knowing that
it wouldn't be right. It did print some text starting with:

%!PS-Adobe-2.0
              %%Title: testpage.fig
                                   %%Creator: fig2dev Version 3.2.3
Patchlevel

So, at least I know that the computer is talking to the printer.

I changed the driver to "Text Only Printer" and tried printing a two
line text file. It sort of worked. I had to press a button next to a
flashing led on the printer for it to actually start printing, but I did
get what I expected.

I found a reference to the sourceforge site that has the hpijs driver:

http://hpinkjet.sourceforge.net/

I followed the instructions at:

http://hpinkjet.sourceforge.net/install.php#download

1. Download and install HPIJS

2. Verify HPIJS is present
   # hpijs -h
   
   Hewlett-Packard Co. Inkjet Server 1.2
   Copyright (c) 2001=2002, Hewlett-Packard Co.

3. Verify your version of Ghostscript to see if IJS support is present 
   # gs -h | grep ijs
   cdjcolor cdjmono cdj550 pj pjxl pjxl300 uniprint ijs stp bj10e bj200

In order to get #3 to work I had to upgrade ghostscript to 7.05 from
5.50. I used:

rpm -U ghostscript-7.05-2.i386.rpm

They tell me that's all I need to do to install hpijs:

  This completes the HPIJS installation. Please see the Usage Example
for more   information.

On the Usage Example page they say:

  The following command will print a postscript file to the lp0 spooler. 
  $ lpr -Plp0 tiger.ps

I created a .ps file by printing a simple web page (just one line of
text) to a file from mozilla. Then I tried:

  # lpr -Php656 mozilla.ps

I went back into printconf to see if the HP 656 might have shown up, now
that the hpijs driver was installed. Not there.  

So, where do I go, now? Is there some way to get printconf to see the
new driver? Or is there something else I'm missing? I looked at rpmfind
for printconf and found different ones for RH 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3. The one
for RH 7.1 is a newer version than the one I have (printconf-0.2.15-2
versus printconf-0.2.12-1). The package html file lists a number of
printers, but the HP 656c is not among them. The package html file for
the RH 7.3 version does not list the printers. Should I try to use the
version of printconf packaged for RH 7.2 or 7.3 on my 7.1 system?

I have the Sybex book, Mastering Red Hat 7.1. It has a section on
printconf, but nothing on what to do if your printer is not on the list.

Thanks in advance for all the good ideas I know I'll get.

Now there's a good way to open a flame war.

I use emacs because in my line of work I find myself working on a large 
variety of operating systems, some of which don't do X11. By using emacs 
instead of xemacs it makes it easier for me to hop from one OS to another 
and take my editor with me.

If I worked exclusively in X11 environments I'd certainly give xemacs
a spin.

I would first try the newer version listed for 7.1.  Failing that, grab the 
latest one (presumably for 7.3) and do a rpm -F

Looks like only printconf-gui requires printconf (don't remember that being 
a seperate package) so grab both of those for 7.3.

Don't know the changelog, but printconf has been updated often over the last 
few years.

Software Flaw Puts Multiple Operating Systems at Risk
REPRINTED FROM: Computerworld
AUG 12, 2002    ARTICLE ID: 1531

by Jaikumar Vijayan

Hole in protocol leaves wide range of vendors exposed


A security hole in software that's used by numerous technology vendors to
transfer data between different systems could allow attackers to run
malicious programs or cause denial-of-service problems on unprotected
servers, according to warnings issued during the past two weeks.


The vulnerability affects the Unix operating systems sold by companies such
as Sun Microsystems Inc. and IBM, as well as Red Hat Inc.'s versions of
Linux and Apple Computer Inc.'s Mac OS X Server software (see box). In
addition, Microsoft Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. said they're investigating
whether their operating systems are at risk.


Developers at MIT said the flaw also affects the widely used Kerberos
authentication software, which was developed at MIT and is designed to let
end users securely log onto remote systems. A patch is available on the MIT
Web site.


"This vulnerability was one that pertained to such a large number of
software distributions that we felt it was pertinent to issue an advisory,"
said Jeff Havrilla, a member of the CERT Coordination Center at Carnegie
Mellon University in Pittsburgh. "The problem is large enough that pretty
much every single major operating system vendor has reported being affected
by it."


The vulnerability involves a communication protocol that was developed by
Sun and is based on its SunRPC remote procedure call technology. The flaw
exists in a program function distributed as part of an External Data
Representation (XDR) library that's used by Sun and other vendors to provide
platform-independent methods for sending data between disparate systems.

Publicized Last Month



The problem was first publicized by Internet Security Systems Inc. (ISS),
late last month. ISS said it had found Sun Solaris and the open-source
FreeBSD and OpenBSD versions of Unix to be vulnerable to the hole.


CERT issued an advisory last week and broadened the warning to include other
vendors, as well as popular applications that are compiled using the flawed
library. Those include MIT's Kerberos 5 software, the DMI Service Provider
daemon for remote desktop management and the Common Desktop Environment's
Calender Manager service.


According to the security research organization, the vulnerability is caused
by an integer overflow in the XDR code that can result in improper memory
allocations. Attackers could take advantage of the flaw to cause buffer
overflows that would let them execute code on systems, CERT said.


No exploits have been reported so far, Havrilla said. But it won't take long
for attackers to develop tools that could let them use the hole and scanning
software that looks for vulnerable systems, he added. Until patches become
available from vendors, Havrilla said, users can mitigate their exposure by
disabling the affected services where possible.

Does anyone know if this is related to the debian security patches they
have been sending out in the last couple days?  Seems like I saw one for
SunRPC and an integer overflow could lead to root exploit.  Sounds like
the same thing to me...

Let me guess-- ECache parity error?  Me and several of my sysadmin buddies
all had a number of these failures with the Sun 400/450MHz SPARC
processors.  Sun kept coming out to replace them, and the engineers
definately knew that something was wrong, but the problems persisted
without any official comment from Sun.

This was across 6 different companies with systems purchased over about a
2 year timespan (1999-2001).  I personally witnessed the failure of about
10 CPUs with the same problem over those two years, and among my friends
this count goes into the hundreds.

My guess is a major engineering defect, but again, Sun never confessed.  I
do know that their external cache (the Ecache in the above error) is not
ECC protected, so it's quite possible that they just had a nasty run of
chips with higher-than-normal alpha decay in there.

Has anyone tried their example3.c?  I was following along to make sure I
understood everything, but I don't have an x86 w/linux to test it on.  I
tried on HP-UX and Solaris machines and they output 1, which should be
wrong.  When I get home tonight I will try it on my amd under linux, but
it seems like this example should work under most versions of unix with
modern hardware.  (Of course there will always be exceptions.)

Thanks,
Jason

The Sparc chips/boards are not my *BY* Sun, but rather by a 3rd party 
vendor.  They go through a fairly rigorous burn-in process before being 
shipped to customers (thus the high cost as compared to a similar x86 
chip), but some failures are intermittant.

We had a pretty bad issue a while ago that was 100% the fault of the 
board vendor.  Bad solder paths and such.  More info than that I 
probably shouldn't go into.  :)

Of course, I could cite similar examples from when I worked at the Xeon 
testing lab at Intel.  ;)

Sorry. I wrote that e-mail in stages, and not in a linear way. That
group of lines got out of place. Yes. It did print. It gave the results
similar to the test page, i.e. several lines of text printed with LF's
but no CR's.

Had to upgrade both printconf and printconf-gui. Didn't help.

  Interesting, Jeff. In today's "Oregonian" (Business Section) there's a
little piece about a major security hole in Microsoft's Internet Exploder.
(So, what else is new, right?). At first, I thought that's what this story
reported.

  The Microsoft flaw was confirmed by Symantec so perhaps it is the same
problem.

Hey Brian,

AFAIK, Mandrake should support laptops. Some things to check (that
really shouldn't be distro specific except for the location of the init
scripts):

  - Do you get any beeps when you insert the card? You should get two
    beeps of the same tone. If the second tone is lower than the first,
    that means there was some configuration problem when setting up the
    card. 'chkconfig --list pcmcia' should show whether or not the
    pcmcia init script is configure to run on boot.

  - If you get no tones, is cardmgr running? This is the application that
    actually does the module loading when a pcmcia card is inserted. It
    should be started out of /etc/init.d/pcmcia.

  - What shows up in /var/log/messages when you insert the card, if
    anything?

Good luck!

Could be ...

I suspect the Oregonian was referring to this:

  * "SSL defeated in IE and Konqueror"
    http://theregister.co.uk/content/4/26620.html

  * ... BugTraq thread
    http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/286895/2002-08-08/2002-08-14/1

And, BTW, Konquerer is already fixed ... (in the CVS tree anyway)

It's not, the Microsoft problem (which also affects Konquerer) is related
to its handling of SSL certificates. The above flaw that Jeff quoted is
the buffer overflow vulnerability in Sun's RPC xdr_array code, which
exists in both glibc and kerberos' kadmind, so you should be seeing
advisories from your vendor for both of those packages.

  Red Hat's bugzilla sent a message earlier this afternoon that a fixed
version of glibc is available for download.

Subject: [PLUG] SSH Key Authentication
Message-ID: <1029304295.15559.29.camel@duron>

Hey everybody-

I'm trying to use SSH Key authentication (RSA) to log on to my school's 
server without the use of a password.  The keys work well on my LAN, but
won't work on the school's system.

Warning:  This is a long email with a lot of (likely useless)
information in it.

I'm running Slackware 8.1 at home on everything except the three Windoze
machines.

The school is runnins Solaris, SunOS 5.8.

My system is running OpenSSH_3.2.3p1, SSH protocols 1.5/2.0, OpenSSL
0x0090604f... and theirs seems to be running 3.4p1.  My actual server is
running 3.4p1, not to worry.

On my system, I'm logged in as rob.  On their system, I'm logged on as
gro.

I generated the keypair (which works great on my LAN and between users
on this box) with the ssh-keygen -t rsa command.  I ftp'd (ascii mode, I
was sure) id_rsa.pub over to the school's box and moved it to
~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 (as I did on local boxen).

I enabled a ton of debug output (-vvv) when I connected to see if I
could figure out what was wrong.  I couldn't.  Here's the pertinent
info, I think:

debug1: service_accept: ssh-userauth
debug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT
debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password
debug3: start over, passed a different list publickey,password
debug3: preferred publickey,keyboard-interactive,password
debug3: authmethod_lookup publickey
debug3: remaining preferred: keyboard-interactive,password
debug3: authmethod_is_enabled publickey
debug1: next auth method to try is publickey
debug1: try privkey: /home/rob/.ssh/identity
debug3: no such identity: /home/rob/.ssh/identity
debug1: try privkey: /home/rob/.ssh/id_rsa
debug3: no such identity: /home/rob/.ssh/id_rsa
debug1: try privkey: /home/rob/.ssh/id_dsa
debug3: no such identity: /home/rob/.ssh/id_dsa
debug2: we did not send a packet, disable method
debug3: authmethod_lookup password
debug3: remaining preferred: ,password
debug3: authmethod_is_enabled password
debug1: next auth method to try is password
gro at odin.pdx.edu's password: 

Any ideas?  I can provide the full debug output if you want it.  It's a
little longer, though!

I did email consultants at pdx.edu in hopes they could help... but every
time I've emailed them in the summer in the past, my emails seem to have
gotten lost.  :-(

On the remote system are the permissions set correctly for 
/home/rob/.ssh/* ?

/home/rob/.ssh should be u+rwx only.

/hone/rob/,ssh/authorized_keys and identity should be u+rw only.

Hmm... ssh can be so tricky. So you tried:

ssh -2 gro at odin.pdx.edu

and it doesn't work? Perhaps your authorized_keys file is corrupted; check
that each line corresponds to one key. What's in the .ssh/config or
/etc/ssh/ssh_config files? How does it compare to those on odin?

What happens if you generate a dsa key and use that? An rsa1 key?

What happens if you generate a key on odin, authorize yourself, and try to
connect to odin from odin?

HTH,

Tyler

Just to make sure we're on the same page:

1. If you do 'ssh-add -l' on your machine, the key in question
   shows up as listed, right?

2. You invoked ssh with the '-2' option?

3. The perms for ~/ on the school's machine disallow write access to 
   anyone but you?

4. The perms for the ~/.ssh/ directory on the school's machine are 
   0700?

5. The perms for ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 on the school's machine are
   0600?

Subject: [PLUG] CUPS Setup
Message-ID: <3D5A8413.5B618AB8@attbi.com>

I'm trying to get my HP656c printer working. I decided to look into
CUPS. Yesterday, I had communication between the computer and the
printer using printconf. Today, the printer just sits there with it's
green led on.

Where do I look, next?

Here's what I did this morning.

I found an article describing CUPS at LinuxPlanet: 

http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reports/2913/1/

Following the directions in the article, I installed CUPS and started it
successfully. Then, using Mozilla connected to the web admin tool at:

http://localhost:631/admin

where I tried to add my HP 656c. The first screen asks for a Name, a
Location, and a Description. Eventually, I found a reference to Location
in the CUPS Software Administrators Manual, and based on what I read,
put "/printers" into the Location field.

The next screen asks for a Device. To my surprise, it lists:
USB PRINTER #1 (HEWLETT-PACKARD DESKJET 656C) as one of the options, so
I selected that one.

The next screen wants a "Model/Driver for hp656c," which is what I typed
for the Name in the first step. There is a list box labeled "Make" that
includes HP. Selecting that leads to another screen with a list box
including 3 options:

HP DeskJet Series CUPS v1.1 (en)
HP LaserJet Series CUPS v1.1 (en)
HP New DeskJet Series CUPS v1.1 (en)

I selected "HP New DeskJet Series CUPS v1.1 (en)," and tried to print a
test page. I'm told, "Test page sent; job ID is hp656c-1, but nothing
prints. I tried modifying the configuration by selecting "HP DeskJet
Series CUPS v1.1 (en)," and tried again. Again, nothing printed. I tried
a couple of times on each. I went to the "Jobs" screen and saw, "No
Active Jobs." I clicked on "Show Completed Jobs," and found four of
them, with ID's hp656c-1, hp656c-2, -3, and -4. The "State" listed for
each is:

  cancelled at
  Wed Aug 14 08:46:25 2002

(That was for -1. The other 3 are similar, with successively later
times.)

If I click "Restart Job," I get:

  Error:

My local config file is all commented out, so I'm going with defaults. 
It is different, however, on the server.  I just enabled X11 forwarding.

The odin config file is:

Host *
        ForwardAgent yes
        ForwardX11 yes
        FallBackToRsh no
        StrictHostKeyChecking no

I wonder if StrictHostKeyChecking no is the culprit?

My authorized_keys2 file looks good.  For the rsa1 test, below, I
symlinked it to authorized_keys1 and authorized_keys, just in case.

> What happens if you generate a dsa key and use that? An rsa1 key?

Wow, I've never seen Odin take so long for anything except when I
compiled fluxbox (gotta have a nice wm when you vnc in, yanno).  It took
a good 10 seconds!

No luck with a DSA key... and no luck with the RSA1 key.

I tried it with all of 'em, RSA, DSA, and RSA1.  Same thing, I was
presented with the password request.

It does, odin must have key-based authentication disabled, but not
explicitely disabled.... or something.

No, I'm not using an authentication agent.  I just created the keys with
no passphrases.  Not the safest way to do it, but I'm not using the keys
to store any kind of secrets.  :-)

This is correct, although I'm sure root could come in and do stuff.

Correct again.

I think the config file on Odin is just messed up, but we'll see what

This looks normal, try to connect with an alternative protocol (like
using ping or use nmap to scan the ports).  The more likely scenario is
that your mail server failed to restart (for some reason, might of even
been a race condition; in which case just try restarting the server --
/etc/init.d/exim restart, or whatever your mail program is).

Good Luck

Based on the debugging output, the exchange is obviously looking in the
wrong place for your public key - in ~rob/.ssh rather than ~gro/.ssh.

I've never tried using keys with different user accounts, but that's
where you need to start looking for the problem.

Maybe try "ssh -l gro ..."?

I did do the ssh -l gro, for sure.

The /home/rob/.ssh/idneity, id_rsa, and id_dsa are the private keys it
is looking for to match up with the public ones that are up on the
server, in the authorized_keys2 file.

the name is the only field here that "matters" it is what the printer
will be known as to CUPS, the other two are simply text fields to help
the end-user with a "what" the printer is and "where" it is (in
situations like say, an office with many, many printers). What you put
in those two doesn't really matter as it is simply for your own
edification.

It looks like you're missing reasonable print drivers. I highly
recommend going to http://www.linuxprinting.org and reading around there
for a bit.  I'm not sure if they have RPMS (I'm also not sure if that's
what you need in the first place), but I promise you they have proper
CUPS drivers for your printer.  Look it up in the database and read
about which drivers work best.  That site should also have good
instructions on installing and configuring each of the availible drivers
under CUPS, LPRng and, I believe, xpdq.

Yeah, at the moment I'm not sure where this is "configurable" (I think
it might either be a compile time option or a even an #ifdef), but the
reasons behind this are mostly diskspace: in order to restart a print
job that has completed, CUPS needs to keep a copy of that printjob
around, which is probably not very secure nor very sensible for most
installations.

I'd say look at the cups error logs (by default in /var/log/cups/) but,
um, they're possibly the least helpful logs of almost any program I've
seen (with the exception of debug = 10 Samba log files ;-( )

So, location here would be, "On the desk in my office." Sigh.

Yesterday, I downloaded and installed hpijs-1.2, following the
instructions on the Sourceforge web site. I was hoping that CUPS would
either have its own version of hpijs or that it would look for the one I
installed. I'll do some more reading and try to find some way to make
use of the driver.

That makes sense. I wasn't sure if something else was holding things up,
since it said that the jobs were "cancelled" (that's the way they spell
it!)

Thanks for the insight. I'll keep digging.

I do believe that was the problem. Wow I didn't know it hit so many 
other companies. This wasn't a company wide problem at Boeing since it 
was our internal customer that decided what sort of hardware and 
software our project used. I guess if any other groups bought Sun 
systems around that timeframe they may have been hit as well.

You know, when I was learning Technical Writing, one of the first
things I got my knuckles whacked on was using a possibly unfamiliar
acronym without defining it in first use.

Consider yourself whacked.

Sure, you gave a URL reference, but that's a sign of laziness.

Remembering that this is the Portland Linux and *Unix* Group, I'll
also say that I'm using OpenBSD on stonehenge.com because I'm not
interested in defending against root-exploit-of-the-week-script-kiddy
stuff that Linux seems so commonly known for.

I'm not saying that OpenBSD is that much more secure... I think the
fact that it's a smaller installed base makes it a smaller target. :)
But OpenBSD does have security as a strong driving priority.

I've occasionally wondered if the OpenBSD reputation is mostly just
hype and self-promotion.  Most of the people you hear repeating the
better "security" claims have never actually audited any code
themselves, they are just repeating what they have heard.  So, I
wonder about the basis for the claims and how solid that basis
actually is.

What part of the install did this error occur?  As a first guess, I
would say delete all the partitions on the hard drive that you will be
using for the install.  What I mean by this, if you have a swap
partition, a root partition and a data partition, and you want to
install on the root partition, but keep the data partition, then you
should delete the swap and the root partitions (leave them as free
space) before doing the RH install, but don't delete the data partition.

You know, a good writer knows that he can't explain everything and

the blanks.

OK, it may be personal only for me then.  I've been on this list a
long time, and attend SAGE conferences (in fact, I'm enroute back from
SAGE-AU down under right now).  But I've never heard PASA defined
here.

Just a datapoint.

Redhat 7.3 over Debian!?  That's blasphemy, my son!  ;)

Does the Debian install work fine on the current hardware?  If you're 
reinstalling because it's segfaulting or having other issues, chances 
are you've got a hardware problem (as evidenced by the panic).

Here's my mantra:  Memtest86 (http://www.memtest86.com/)

If that's not it, find a dos-bootable disk and fdisk prior to 
installation, then let the RH setup do it all for you.

Hope that helps.

Well many of the exploits occur in the installed applications not the 
operating system itself. Keep in mind that OpenBSD runs these same 
applications as Linux does so they both could be vulnerable.

I have OpenBSD on one system and I think what makes it very secure for 
the most part is that the system, after being installed, has virtually 
no services running. SSH is about the only service running on the box 
by default. 

As soon as other services are enabled the box probably becomes less 
secure although with proper IP Filtering setup access to running 
services can be controlled. I was contemplating OpenBSD for my 
gateway/firewall system but the when I tried to upgrade from OpenBSD 
2.9 to 3.0 I got a system that wouldn't boot so I had to level the 
system and reinstall 3.0 cleanly.

I don't know if the install process changed or what but I would really 
like to be able to upgrade a system so I can be done it 20 minutes or 
so. Now that I have 3.0 running I guess should try upgrading to 3.1 and 
see if it upgrades my system properly. 

I don't mind having to reconfigure the system since, for my purposes, I 
only have to restore a few text configuration files. I keep my 
configuration files under revision control so I can slap them back on 
my newly installed system with very little effort.

This is slightly anomalous, I think the default is "yes". Other than that

Message-ID: <20020815043134.C37B9178F1@medulla.enet.sharplabs.com>

I built mozilla 1.1b today from the .src.rpm and am trying to get
various plugings to work.  To check out the video plugin I go to:

http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html

and click on video/demo index on the right of frame.  When I click on
a video I can see the .MOV data loading into /tmp/plugtmp but as soon
as the helper app (in this case several instances of xanim according
to `ps') starts up, the files in /tmp/plugtmp just disappears and the
thing just hangs.  I can back out of the page but I can't get the
videos to play.  `xanim' seems to work just fine from the command line.

Anyone know what I can do to find out if it's my problem or mozilla's
(or xanim's) and how to fix it?

Relevant rpms:

rpm -q xanim
xanim-28010-16mdk

rpm -q mozilla
mozilla-1.1-0.branch.2mdk

rpm -q plugger
plugger-4.0-2mdk


Like so many things in Linux, I'm a dim-wit when it comes to plugins.
I really don't know much about MIME types, plugins, &c.

Here's another problem:

I go to:

http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/index.pl

and the top central picture is just blank.
I click on it and I get a dialog box which says:

   This page contains info of type (application/x-java-vm) that
   can only be viewed with the appropriate Plug-in.

Clicking "OK" makes the diag. box disappear.  Great!  Where is the
plug-in for java?  Shouldn't it be on my Mandrake 8.2 system?
What rpm's should I see if I have?

Thanks for any help.

I found a second email address to email them, so maybe I'll have more
luck with this one.

Odin is runninig SunOS 5.8, which I *think* is Solaris 8.0.  Richard
might pipe in and let us know what it really is.  There's no
/etc/solaris-version file like so many linux distros put in place.  Oh
well....

It doesn't say Solaris anywhere... just SunOS still:

I'm pretty sure Solaris and SunOS are one in the same.

I believe that SunOS 5.8 = Solaris 8.

Here is some cool trivia about the two that I just found:
http://www.math.umd.edu/~helpdesk/Online/GettingStarted/SunOS-Solaris.html

And to find out what versions match up:
http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/solaris/versions/

So I guess you are running solaris 8 as you say.

Correction:
For Tri-Met users, it looks like the 38 goes right to our front door.
I'm not as sure about the 39. 

This should make it much easier for those of you with computer cases on

SunOS vs Solaris tends to cause lots of confusion. Here's how I understand it.

SunOS was what Sun originally had.

Solaris was what Sun bought, and merged with SunOS.

They merged the version numbers too.

Solaris 2.6 reports "SunOS 5.6".

Solaris 7.0 reports "SunOS 5.7"

Solaris 8.0 reports "SunOS 5.8"

and...

Solaris 9.0 reports "SunOS 5.9" (Surprise!)

Originally, there was something with the 2 and the 6 in 2.6, but that 
caused more confusion, so Sun chose to drop the 2, and just go with version 
7.0 for the next release, i.e. Solaris 7.0. Originally, Solaris 7.0 was 
going to be Solaris 2.7.

Mostly, I think it's marketing mayhem.  Marketing folks (droids?) think a 
higher number tells folks that it's better. That's also why Mandrake jumped 
versions a while back. Had to be a higher number than the competition.

I really hate it when a company plays the "version game". It reminds me 
of the play on versions Microsoft played with NT. When NT first came 
out it was rightly a 1.0 version but Microsoft named it version 3.1. I 
guess they jumped versions as a 1.0 product might be perceived in a bad 
way by customers.

I believe they did something similar with Word for Windows as well where 
it jumped from like 2.0 to 6.0. I guess they had to do that to make 
their product appear as mature as WordPerfect. Heck I used WordPerfect 
5.0 back in the late 80s under PC-DOS so WordPerfect was rightly way 
ahead in versions since it had been around for a quite some time 
compared to Word.

I think I got the versions right I'm a bit fuzzy on this stuff after all 
these years.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.44.0208150020330.3569-100000@eel.ENGR.ORST.EDU>

This question is probably more for Karl than anyone else, but lets see...

On my computer I haven't cleaned apt's cache in a very long time, 1.4GB
worth of .deb's in fact.  I have only a puny dial up connection and I
recently borrowed a friend's broadband to update my installation.  Now I
want to upgrade my roommates computer.  Essentially I want to use the
/var/cache/apt from my computer to upgrade his computer.

Is there an easy way to do this?  Could I somehow set my computer to act
like a debian mirror to his computer?  We have a 100Mbps network here in
the aptartment...

Is this is just foolish let me know and I'll just find a way to update his
computer via broadband or something like that.

Thanks,
Jason

Kyle,

The "Blaster" screensaver crashes my system every time.  I'm running an
S3 Savage video on Debian Woody (2.4.19).  After disabling that screen
saver no more crashes, also able to get it to crash by running it in
demo mode.  Have also seen references to others having this problem with
this screensaver.  Some sort of bug in XFree 86.

I'm forwarding this to the Mid-Willamette Valley and Eugene groups,
since Salem is relatively close to them.

Also, this is the same night as PLUG's Advanced Topics Meeting.
PASA and the Advanced Topics Meeting are often on the same night.

Rich,

Have you looked at the Linux printer website? Here's the list of HP 
printers. I don't know which Laserjet 5 printer you have but it talks 
about some of the drivers being "slow".

"uname -m" and "uname -a" (deleting any info you think is sensitive)? 
I'm including a hardware-specific case statement in a shell script and 
I realized I don't have access to an Athlon for testing :-(

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0208150841370.31476-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I downloaded a bunch of data from an agency web site by printing the
information to a disk file. This gave me the .ps version that I converted to
a text file with pstotext.

  On of the data fields is the decimal longitude, a numeric field preceeded
with a dash (because every longitude west of the Prime Meridian is a
negative value). But, in my text file, rather than having just a
dash/negative sign, the character is encased in a white rectangle.
Obviously, it's not a vanilla dash.

  How can I identify the hex code for this character? And, how would I
specify that code in a search-and-replace operation (in joe or emacs, for
example)?

  In the meantime, I'm digging into my awk references to learn how to
specify the beginning and end of alpha strings so they can have double
quotes around them (to make a CSV file).

TIA,

Rich

  Thanks, Tony. I've not looked there for several years; not since I
researched a tabloid-size color inkjet that would work with linux.

  The CUPS drivers work OK. I think the delay is having ghostscript
translate from PostScript to HP's PCL. I see the display say "PROCESSING
JOB", and a page or two comes out, then it thinks again before the next
couple of pages print.

  Anyway, I ordered the PostScript SIMM and I'll put that in when it
arrives. That should eliminate the translation step and bring the speed back
up. While this is now an "orphaned" model because the company is pushing its
latest and greatest. But, at 12 ppm, it's quite adequate for me. A couple of
years ago I bought the last available duplexing unit I could find anywhere
in the country. Now I can print double sided and that saves a ton of paper.
I expect the PostScript module will bring back the speed and then I'll have
all the printer I'll need for quite some time.

Don't try to identify it, leave it out of the equation and focus on
the characters that you want to keep.  This perl filter should do the
job:

perl -pe 'tr/\x10-\xFF/-/;' input_file > output_file

This changes all characters above 128 (hex 10) to a dash.

I don't have any data to test it on, but if you'd send me a copy
I'd be glad to.

perl -pe 's/(\w+)/"$1"/g' input_file > output_file

\w is perl's shortcut for A-Za-z0-9_

if that doesn't work, replace it with \S, which is perl's shortcut
for anything which isn't whitespace.

SunOS ecola 5.8 Generic_108528-15 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-80

I recently took a Solaris Sysadmin class, and IIRC the point number is 
the Solaris Version number.  So x.8 = Solaris 8, X.7 = Solaris 7, etc.

Don't ask me what the 5 stands for.  ;)

od is the command-line utility I typically use for such things. Try

  od -ab filename.txt | less

Then you can use perl for the search and replace:

  # replace spaces with '%'
  perl -pe 's/\055/%/g' filename.old > filename.new

What I've done is simply share via NFS /var/cache/apt/archives, and then 
mount it on the other machine.  You'll have to add an entry to 
/etc/apt/atp.conf however:

Debug
{
  NoLocking "true";
}

So that dpkg won't write a lock file and then complain when it can't 
have exclusive access to the shared directory.  Just make sure you don't 
upgrade from two different machines at once.  :)

It's a Duron and not an Athlon, but I don't thing there is anything in

The original SunOS went up to version 4, so uname on a SunOS 4 machine 
reports 4.blah. E.g., on a SunOS 4.1.3 machine:

  [heinlein]$ uname -sr
  SunOS 4.1.3_U1

When Sun released Solaris, it bumped up its internal numbering scheme 
to 5.blah.

  # Solaris 2.5.1
  [heinlein]$ uname -sr
  SunOS 5.5.1

  # Solaris 2.6
  [heinlein]$ uname -sr
  SunOS 5.6

  # Solaris 8
  [heinlein]$ uname -sr
  SunOS 5.8

Regardless of the product name ("Solaris 2.6" or "Solaris 7"), the 
uname reporting has stayed fairly consistent.

Although this doesn't answer your question, I recently noticed a definate
slowdown in printing when I shifted from RedHat 7.2 to RedHat 7.3.  (On
the same hardware).  I came to the same conclusion as you-- that
Ghostscript was slowing things down.

I used to print at about 1 page per second ("enscript"-ed text pages), but
now it's down to about 1 page every 3 seconds.

I would think this would help a lot.  It'll probably look better too,
since sometimes the Ghostscript fonts are just slightly off from the Adobe
fonts.

The only other option I can think of (which I have not tried) is using a
different output format from Ghostscript (i.e. PCL2 vs. PCL4) and see if
that speeds the processing any.  The output driver you're using might just
be really slow.

The hackerly option is to build a profiling version of Ghostscript, track
down where it's spending its time printing, and optimize the code.

I hate to sound stupid, but what do I do at that point?  Running apt-get
upgrade won't do anything special yet... Are  you suggesting that I mount
the  files from my computer as the /var/cache/apt/archive on his machine?

Do I need to do anything to make his machine have the package list or can
it build that automagically.

Thanks,
Jason

When you run an apt-get update;apt-get upgrade it will a)  get a new
package list, b) look at files in it's archive (which you have
generously mounted using nfs, c) figure out which files it doesn't have
and only download newer files.

Have you looked at the method "autoconf" uses to determine a processor's
Athlon-ness?  It might be overkill for a simple shell script, but it
probably works in a fairly portable manner.

Yes, and SunOS was a BSD derivative.

I'm not aware that Sun bought Solaris (could be, I just wasn't aware of
it). I do know that Solaris was an attempt by Sun to move from BSD to a
SVR4 Unix. SVR4 was supposed to be the great re-unification of the Unix
world. Rumor is that you could hear the screams of the SunOS admins from
space. ;)

  I tried this as 's/\255/\045/g' and ended up with a file of all dashes

That works, except with versions prior to Solaris 7. Solaris 2.6 (the 
immediate predecessor to Solaris 7.0) reports as SunOS 5.6. There was never 
a version 3, 4, 5 or 6 of Solaris.

The "5" in SunOS 5.8 means it's SunOS version 5.

and a simple "i686" from -m.

It's odd that od shows 255, when all of the other numbers are in octal.

If you want to replace the 255's, I think you need something like
's/\0377/\045/g'

I'm usually working with hex numbers, so I have an alias that uses od.
alias hd='od -A x -t x1'

uname -m
i686

Note that I have modified my rpm system config files to force athlon switches
to get used in compilation, as well as the name "athlon" to appear in
the .rpm's built from .src.rpm's.

Had `uname' given "athlon" instead of i686, none of the changes to rpm config
files would have been necessary.

I re-built the kernel, gcc, and glibc, with these changes, but
`uname' still gives the i686 moniker.

Mostly I've rebuilt things to get whatever benefit I might gain by
having the "athlon" switch turned on in gcc-3.2.  Still, I'd sure like to
know where `uname' gets the i686 from.

Maybe there is a better way these days, but I use the "hexdump" command
along with a format file which contains the following lines (to give me
my preferred dump format):

"%06.6_ad "  16/1 "%02x "
"\t" "%_p"
"\n"

then I just enter the command:

  hexdump -f <format_file_name>  <name of file to look at>

this will display the file as a series of lines, each starting with
a number giving the current byte offset into the file (in decimal),
followed by 16 hex integers representing 16 bytes from the file, followed
by the same 16 bytes displayed as ASCII text (with "." used for
unprintable characters which your funny dash might be considered).
Using this, you can read through the file using the right hand column of
ASCII until you find the area you are looking for, then you can look at
the corresponding byte values to see the hex codes for any unprintable
or unusual characters you are interested in.

[snip]

For emacs, you use ^Q followed by the value of the character code in
your current radix setting (defaults to octal on my system)
Radix setting can be changed by modifying: read-quoted-char-radix which
can be set under "editing" -> "editing basics" configuration options.

So to specify an arbitrary character with a value like 0xF2 with your
current "read-quoted-char-radix" set to 16 (hex) you would use:

  ^QF2

in your current context (character insertion, search and replace, etc.)

I agree that having a Postscript printer is the way to go. I've had the 
HP 4P for nearly 8 years and I can't yet justify buying a new printer 
until my HP dies or it's too expensive to fix. I only seem to be 
averaging about 1000 pages a year on the thing and so far the only 
expense has been toner cartridges and paper.

I did get a Lexmark color printer that has a Postscript engine in 
hardware so I would be assured I had a color printer that worked with 
both Windows and Linux. I also have a Lexmark Z11 that is supposed to 
be partially supported under Linux but when I tried it all I got was a 
bunch of "gibberish" on the paper so I've given up on that printer.

You guys aren't thinking in octal, that's 255 OCTAL, which is 0xAD hex,
which also corresponds to the "-" character (0x2D) with the high order bit
set.

I've seen some information that shows that SunOS 4.1.4 = Solaris 1.1.2

Screams could also be heard from the users that had enjoyed very stable 
systems under the BSD derived SunOS as well. My wife was working for 
Sprint at the time Solaris rolled out and they had a number of system 
crashes under early versions of Solaris. It was a painful transition to 
say the least.

Yeah, I've heard the same. I wasn't doing SunOS work back then, but 
one fellow colleague told me that it took a loooonnngg time for him to 
accept the BSD -> SysV transition. I'm sure that was as true within 
the Solaris engineering group at Sun as it was for SunOS users.

  My ASCII code table shows the hyphen as 0x2D (Decimal 45), so why's the
high order bit set when translated from ps to txt? Well, that's rhetorical
as I'd have to examine the pstotext code from gs. Anyway, is there a way to
turn off that one bit so the '-' looks like all the other characters?

Thanks, Shannon,

  On the subject of the Grand Unification Theory as applied to UNIX, doesn't
it appear that linux has assumed that role? Not that it incorporates all the
differences among the various proprietary ones but it is being adopted by
all the brand name vendors. Now, if only the linux distributor packagers
would adopt the LBS/FHS or whatever it's called now ...

My guess would be that it was already set in the ps file and that the text
conversion does little more than strip the postscript code and reformat
whatever text there is, even if it uses weird characters.

simplest thing is a straight character substitution with the tr command:

   tr \255 \55 <current_file >fixed_file

The rumor that I've heard is that Sun wanted SunOS to scale more to
multiple processor systems, but when they looked at the re-architecting
that needed to be done to the BSD kernel to support multi-processors and
saw that most of that work had already been done in the SysV kernel, they
decided that it'd be quicker/less effort to adopt SysV. That FreeBSD is
the only BSD just now starting to support SMP (AFAIK, but I don't follow
the BSDs that closely), while Solaris scales well to 16 or more processors
(or so I've been led to believe) gives some credence to that rumor,
but it very well could be a complete and utter figment of my imagination.

I, for one, don't think it is at all off topic. If it's unix, it's all
good (well, maybe except for SCO).

I just tried another FreeBSD install, and am currently stuck. I wanted
to do an ftp install, but the install floppies have support for a very
limited number of ethernet cards, and don't include the Intel eepro
that I have in the box in question.

I then downloaded & burned 4.6.1-RC2.iso, but the installation died
towards the end with a final error message of "Can't copy /kernel".
I'm thinking it might be a bad image.

Granted, I've not put much more effort into finding out for myself,
but do any of you know if there's a way to load extra ethernet drivers
during an ftp install?

I did just now try OpenBSD, and the install was pretty painless and
actually just auto-detected the eepro.

Thanks,
--Stafford

I consider myself lucky because I was using HP/UX at my job at the time 
and didn't have to experience the pain. When I finally was exposed to 
Solaris at a job my workstations had Solaris 2.4 on them and it was 
quite stable and I didn't have any stability problems.

Having been in the situation where I had to support code that ran under 
Solaris, HP/UX, AIX, and IRIX, I felt it easier to maintain the code 
since all platforms supported System V signals and IPC mechanisms. It 
made it a bit easier to maintain the code so it ran correctly under all 
four environments. I don't want to think about what it would have been 
like to support both System V and BSD in the same code. Maybe it could 
be done in less work than what my insticts are telling me.

There were a number of subtle differences among the various Unix systems 
where the Unix APIs were concerned. I recall differences where on one 
systems structs were created from the heap while on other systems a 
struct was static and would be reused if the function that created it 
is was called again. 

With good documentation and man pages I found it possible to have code 
that ran on all of the systems and the things that were diffent used 
#ifdefs and liberal use of comments explaining why something was being 
done differently for one OS compared to another, etc.

I hadn't heard this either, though I do know that at about this time, Sun
bought Interactive UNIX (a System V implementation) which at the time was
the #2 x86 UNIX distribution (behind SCO).  The reason I heard for the
purchase was this was the simplest way to get a complete set of UNIX
device drivers for the x86 platform in order to complete their Solaris
port to the PC.

My mistake. Then I'll ask away. Thank you.

#1 - I've dabbled in Linux for year. I only made the switch full-time as a
desktop OS about 10 months. My reasoning, in part, was that doing so would
force me to learn it better.  After using it for a while I'm a little put
off by the complexities in configuration files and directory structure
introduced by the various distros. And after trying out FreeBSD this
weekend on an extra machine, I REALLY like what I see. However, since part
of my motivation for what I choose as my desktop OS is learning, I
consider this like a bet. I don't want to bet on the "wrong" horse, become
skilled at FreeBSD, but have the market shift increasingly to Linux.

So question #1 (and hopefully this doesn't lead to an ugly long thread) is
what everyone thinks the future is for Linux vs. FreeBSD. I know skills
are tranferable, but the bottom line is that since I have limited time I
will inevitably get to know one better than the other. I know Linux has
the *buzz* right now, but I get the feeling, especially with the
popularity of Mac OSX, that as corporations get more comfortable with the
PC-based Unix-like OSes, FreeBSD may pick up steam. Thoughts on that?

#2 - Is Java support straightened out yet? Last time I checked you
couldn't compile Java as fast as you could on Linux. Has this changed or
will this change soon?

#3 - Does anyone run wireless with FreeBSD? I can't get the OS to create
an interface (wi0) for my wireless card and I'm not sure why.

Thanks,

Preston

I second that. Having BSD critters poking around would be good for the
local ecosystem. Diversity is one reason why Unix developers rely on 
standards rather than a marketing department for guidance. :-)

My hope is that Linux and FreeBSD will both continue to survive and
thrive. They each benefit from advances in the other, and in my opinion
you can benefit more from being OS "multi-lingual" than concentrating on
one.

Of course. But the inevitability is that I will only have time to *focus*
on one. And I don't need a server really. So my idea is to have one
desktop sitting in the kitchen running 1 OS and 1 sitting in my office
running the other. The one in my office is obviously my primary OS, not
the recipe/family computer, so it seems to me the one downstairs should be
Linux, the one upstairs FreeBSD. That's what seems logical. But I'm just
checking before I commit *more* time to FreeBSD, which is what will
happen.

So the man wants some opinions, eh?

First, my guess is that Linux will continue to increase its user base &
be more popular than BSD -- Free-, other, or all combined. My reasoning for
this is that all of the major advantages *BSD has over, say, MS -- that
it is less expensive, more reliable, comes with the source code -- are the
same that Linux has. Unfortunately, the *BSDs do not have a user base
close to the size Linux now has, which means finding people as skilled
in any BSD is more difficult than for Linux, & outweigh the advantages
any of the BSDs profess.

Second, BSD will not disappear from the computer world for the same
reason that Linux never will: as long as at least one copy of the source
code exists, & is hacked at by one motivated user, it has the potential
of being rediscovered & starting a new life after a long, cold winter.
No proprietary OS has this ultimate survival plan.

What I feel will happen is that BSD will become more hobbyist-oriented,
the OS for the self-described computer cognescenti, the same sort of
folks who originally embraced Linux & developed it in the pioneering
days. This will keep BSD in a fairly good state of maintenance.

On the other hand, BSD will be of value in terms of strategic deployment
thru a business. Because its internals are different enough from Linux,
it can be useful in building firewalls or an ecommerce web server, where
security is an important consideration. Also, since OpenBSD & NetBSD both
support non-Intel architectures, BSD will be valuable in giving new life
to old hardware that are considered obsolete (e.g., the hardware doesn't
run the latest release of Bloatus 1000 with its 100GB disk & 20GB RAM
requirements), & allow them to be used to meet needs too low on the list
to otherwise justify buying equipment.

(Here, I hope BSD doesn't go into a death spiral, & become marginalized:
because BSD developers are still supporting older hardware architectures --
Sparc, Alpha, MIPS, PPC, Motorola 68xxx -- this provides competition to
prod Linux volunteers into continuing to support the same architectures.
Loss of either camp in this area would end this rewarding competion &
accelerate the destruction of still useable, but slower, computers.)

Now does this mean you shouldn't learn FreeBSD (or one of the other flavors)?
Many of the jobs that advertise for Linux skills, also are looking for
skills in one or more operating systems, & FreeBSD does get mentioned.
I'd say that if you like FreeBSD better than Linux, then learn it, while
keeping a weather eye on how it varies from Linux. And all the while
laugh whenever RMS's peevish argument that ``it's properly GNU/Linux"
comes around again.

Subject: [PLUG] Problems using LDAP for login authorization...
Message-ID: <20020815165711.21cf692f.eli.stair.lists@attbi.com>

Hello all,

I'm having an issue getting a client to use an LDAP server for login 
authentication.  In a nutshell: LDAP server (RH 7.3) is running slapd
providing passwd,groups and shadow.  One set of clients (actually LTSP
diskless clients) work fine, authorize against the LDAP server OK.  The
problem system is configured correctly (ldap.conf,nss_ldap,pam_ldap),
and I can do an ldapsearch, run gq or Directory Administrator with the
credentials it uses for auth.

What happens is this. 
If the client is _NOT_ configured with "ldap" in any fields in nsswitch,
I can boot, log in, su etc just as if everything were configured normally
(i.e. without LDAP), EXCEPT that it makes a BIND to the ldap server
(shown in /var/log/ldap on the server).  The login/su whatever completes
fine as if it were merely checking the flatfiles.  

When I set "ldap" for passwd, groups and shadow in /etc/nsswitch, I get
logged in as my current user (estair) fine, and it auths against the ldap
server.  However, I cannot su to any other user.  If I try to su root:
the correct password segfaults, the incorrect password says "incorrect
password".  Below is a snip of the log.  If anyone can shed some light on
where my glitch is, I'd be greatly appreciative. 

I'll be more than happy to supply more details, log entries, config files,
etc. if it would help.

Cheers, and thanks for any input guys (and gals:)

Because of our backup needs (need something we can haul off-site), I

  Well, the PostScript SIMM arrived today and installed just fine. So I now
have 14M of memory and ps capabilities.

  I'll see if it does print more rapidly now. But, I wonder ... I suppose
that I need to go into the CUPS setup somewhere and let it know that there's
a PostScript printer attached so output should not be fed through
ghostscript first.

  The duplexer shouldn't slow printing down, should it?

Well, to the CUPS stuff,

I really don't think so, the size difference has to do with the way a
Gig is calculated.  The system, displayed with fdisk, uses 1024 Megs for
each Gig (which is correct for block devices), but the drive
manufacturers use 1000 Megs for each Gig (which is correct for the
metric system), because it makes the drive look that much bigger (they
may do the same for Megs as well).  If you can call up cfdisk, it will
display the actual number of bytes, and will show all partitions,
whether it can properly recognize them or not,and free space.

What level of hot-swap are you looking for?  If you want true hot-swap
Will your workstation have redundant drives (at least) so it doesn't get
stupid when the drive is removed?  Are you planning on redundant SCSI
cards so the inevitable bus reset that hits when the drive is removed
doesn't interrupt/cancel the I/Os outstanding to the other drive?

Are you only looking for "warm swap"?  This is where you quiesce the I/O
to that drive (i.e. unmount everything), remove the device from the kernel
("echo 'scsi remove-single-device 0 0 1 0' > /proc/scsi/scsi" for ID 1),
and then remove the device.  You might be able to avoid the SCSI bus reset
in this case and save yourself a card.

Unfortunately, my experience with hot-swap hardware vendors is limited, so
I can't actually give you the info you were looking for.  ;-)

  -- Steve

PS: Be sure to check the actual sustained media-to-interface transfer rate
on the drives if performance is a concern.  Ignore any "burst" or "cache

know of is the Seagate Cheetah XP15, rated at 51-69MB/s
media-to-interface.

Subject: [PLUG] LDAP login/authentication problems, unable to log in.
Message-ID: <20020815191821.3fc60e68.eli.stair.lists@attbi.com>

Hello all,

I'm having an issue getting a client to use an LDAP server for login 
authentication.  In a nutshell: LDAP server (RH 7.3) is running slapd
providing passwd,groups and shadow (using OpenLDAP 2.0.13).  One set of 
clients (actually LTSP diskless clients) work fine, authorize against 
the LDAP server OK.  The problem system is configured similarly 
(ldap.conf,nss_ldap,pam_ldap), and I can do an ldapsearch, run gq or 
Directory Administrator with the credentials it uses for auth (root OR
proxyuser).

What happens is this:
If the client is _NOT_ configured with "ldap" in any fields in nsswitch,
I can boot, log in, su etc just as if everything were configured normally
(i.e. without LDAP), EXCEPT that it makes a BIND to the ldap server
(shown in /var/log/ldap on the server).  The login/su whatever completes
fine as if it were merely checking the flatfiles.  

When I set "ldap" for passwd, groups and shadow in /etc/nsswitch, I get
logged in as my current user (estair) fine, and it (seems) to auth against 
the ldap server.  However, I cannot su to any other user.  If I try to su 
root:  with incorrect password says "incorrect password", and the client log
shows:  --(the LDAP log on the server is listed at the end of this email)--
~~~~~~~~
Padmasambhava su: pam_ldap: error trying to bind as user "uid=root,ou=People,dc=homeunix, dc=net" (Invalid credentials)
Padmasambhava su(pam_unix)[7031]: check pass; user unknown
Padmasambhava su(pam_unix)[7031]: authentication failure; logname=estair uid=501 euid=0 tty= ruser= rhost=
Padmasambhava gconfd (estair-6978): GConf server is not in use, shutting down.
Padmasambhava gconfd (estair-6978): Exiting
~~~~~~~~

A correct password segfaults the su attempt, and returns to a user shell.
(log output for that from the LDAP server shown below also)

I'll be more than happy to supply more details, log entries, config files, 
try anything out, etc. if it would help.  It seems to me to just be a 
permissions issue with doing an auth, although I don't see how given what 
I have for access. I really can't get a grasp on how nss_ldap and pam_ldap 
interact, even after reading the LDAP-HOWO, LDAP-Ipmlementation howto and 
the Admin. guide, there isn't enough "clear" documentation of how it all 
works together (at least for ME to understand the whole).
Once I work this out, I'm sure I'll get it though.... :)

Cheers, and thanks for any input guys (and gals)

To all:

I am running a RH 7.2 in our mail server.  My problem is whenever I delete a
user using "userdel" command, the folder of that user being deleted is still
in the home directory.  How do I delete a user at the same time deleting all
the files and folders associated to it.

I think "warm swap" would work fine for this application.  I don't
want to have to reboot though, that's the main thing.

And lightning fast is not necessary, just run-of-the-mill fast and
reliable is what I am looking for.

You probably should run "apt-get autoclean" now and then, to purge old
ones that are no longer listed in the Packages and Sources metadata
files.

Mise en place:

# apt-get install apt-proxy

... on the first machine.  After you RTFM...

Edit the "/etc/apt-proxy/apt-proxy.conf", and add something like:

8<------------------------------------------------------------>8
add_backend /main/					\
	$APT_PROXY_CACHE/debian/			\
	http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/

add_backend /non-US/					\
	$APT_PROXY_CACHE/non-US/			\
	http://non-us.debian.org/

add_backend /security/					\
	$APT_PROXY_CACHE/security/			\
	security.debian.org::debian-security/		\
	non-us.debian.org::debian-security/		

add_backend /openoffice/ \
	$APT_PROXY_CACHE/openoffice/ \
	http://www.phy.olemiss.edu/openoffice/
8<------------------------------------------------------------>8

You might like to adjust other things in there, of course.

Then, run, as root, "apt-proxy-import /var/cache/apt/archives".

On the other machine, you use URL's like this in
"/etc/apt/sources.list":

8<------------------------------------------------------------>8
deb     http://apt.intra.hegbloom.net:9999/main/ stable main contrib non-free
deb-src http://apt.intra.hegbloom.net:9999/main/ stable main contrib non-free

deb     http://apt.intra.hegbloom.net:9999/non-US/ stable/non-US main contrib non-free
deb-src http://apt.intra.hegbloom.net:9999/non-US/ stable/non-US main contrib non-free

deb     http://apt.intra.hegbloom.net:9999/security/ stable/updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://apt.intra.hegbloom.net:9999/security/ stable/updates main contrib non-free

deb     http://apt.intra.hegbloom.net:9999/openoffice/ testing main contrib
deb-src http://apt.intra.hegbloom.net:9999/openoffice/ testing main contrib
deb     http://apt.intra.hegbloom.net:9999/openoffice/ unstable main contrib
deb-src http://apt.intra.hegbloom.net:9999/openoffice/ unstable main contrib
8<------------------------------------------------------------>8

And that will cause the other machine to pull through the apt-proxy.
It will only go to the Internet for packages not already in it's cache.

I've been using this for a couple of weeks now, and am finding that it
works very well.  You can perform installs using it also.  During the
install, after the reboot when you are setting up Apt, where it asks
for the hostname, give something like "apt.intra.hegbloom.net:9999" as
the hostname, then when it asks for the directory on the server, tell
it "/main/".  I've been selecting "edit sources.list by hand" and
typing them in, including the "security" one through the proxy, then
saying "no" when it asks about whether to use security.  Also say no
to useing non-us, and add that by hand too, as shown above.

I think userdel -r will do that.  Read the entry in man userdel to be sure 
that is what you wanted to do.

In nsswitch.conf, what's the order of things for passwd, shadow, and 
group? You should have 'files' listed before 'ldap':

passwd: files ldap
shadow: files ldap
group:  files ldap

If 'ldap' is listed prior to files, then your system won't (I think) 
have access to system-level accounts in /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, and 
/etc/group.

If you're using sendmail, you could put something like this in your
/etc/aliases file for a deleted user we'll call bob.

   bob: "|/path/to/program/no-such-user"

This will pipe the e-mail message to standard input of the 'no-such-user' 
program, which could be a Perl script or something that generates an auto
reply. You might be able to use the vacation program for this purpose.

Subject: [PLUG] Can I use linux driver code for 'doze?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0208160855530.8233-100000@tpol.peak.org>

We have a wireless network at home.  The router and all machines but
one run Linux (LEAF on the router), and the cards are old Aviator
PCMCIA cards that use the modules ray_cs.o.  Though the manufacturer
dropped the card years ago, it still works with the latest kernel
thanks to the magic of open source (and somebody's hard work, of
course.)

Now the problem.  My brother had to get a new computer for school, has
to run windoze (teacher training!), and the machine won't work with
anything but XP.  For which there are no drivers available for the
wireless card.

Does anybody know how hard it'd be to adapt the Linux driver to work
on XP?  I'd have expected somebody to have done this already (maybe
somebody with some skill on the platform :-), but can't find anything
on the web.

Any other ideas?  Or should I just go blow $150 on a pair of "modern"
cards?  (One card would be for the router.  I don't think our old
cards are 802.11 compatible.)

Thanks,

Quick and dirty hack:
Without too much work you should be able to scp the files from you machine to 
his.  Place them in the appropriate directory and have him update.  Then when 
he goes to download packages it should recognize that all the files are there 
already.

More elegant, but not reasonable for one update:
If that doesn't work go read Karl's email that was posted on

It should show you how to set up apt-proxy.

Seems that I heard that Sun bought technology from someone, DEC I think, which
was the basis for the UE10K. And DEC had bought that technology from Cray. I
wonder if that technology acquisition was at all related to their acquisition
of Solaris?

The technology behind the E10k was purchased from Cray.  Cray had 
purchased SGI's server division about 2 weeks before Sun aquired Cray, 
and I believe Cray had also purchased Floating Point Systems prior to 
that.  Some of the people I work with used to work at FPS.

Looking at the Sun Timeline, Solaris was a joint venture between AT&T 
and Sun (1987).  I don't have an external URL, unfortunately. :(

You could also use sendmail's redirect feature if you know the user's
new address.  Again in /etc/aliases

bob:	bob at somewhereelse.com.REDIRECT

This will cause mail addressed to bob to be bounced with

  551 User not local; please try <bob at somewhereelse.com>

To enable the redirect feature, you will need to have FEATURE(`redirect')
in your sendmail.mc file.  It's possible that this is already turned on.
If you need help changing sendmail.mc, post to the list again.

If you do decide to make changes to /etc/aliases, you will need to run
the newaliases command in order for your changes to take effect.

That's the way I'm leaning. It just feels good to muck around with config
feels and have them be a little more sensible, a little less complex. It's
a good feeling to have very little (relative to SuSE 8) software installed
and thus just pick and choose what I want from the start. I know, I can do
this with Linux as well, but even the best installer makes this a long
process and in the process of installing stuff you need stuff you don't
want often gets included.

I'm having a problem with X not refreshing correctly under FreeBSD, but
I'm sure I'll be able to work that out. Either way, I like how much closer
I feel to the OS and how much cleaner it is.

I'd also be interested in any technical pros/cons to FreeBSD.

While I think BSD is fine along with Linux, keep in mind that you don't 
have to do a "kitchen sink" install with SuSE. There are options for 
more minimal installs that doesn't have X or KDE so it's pretty 
barebones. I prefer this setup for firewalls where I want only a 
limited amount of functionality.

I am working on an OpenBSD gateway/firewall system but I haven't gotten 
around to getting all of the IP filter stuff in place. On top of that 
the IP filtering package changed in the last version or so of OpenBSD 
so I need to go back and rework my firewall rules to work with the new 
firewalling rules. There are some cool new capabilities with the new 
rule system that I want to use.

In my first trials of OpenBSD, I installed X and everything and it 
didn't feel much different than Linux. Probably the biggest shock to me 
was starting out when a "csh" (C shell). I had to install "bash" from a 
package since I like its ability to edit commands which is something 
that the basic "csh" doesn't support. There is "tcsh" that supports 
editing commands like "bash" does but I still prefer to use "bash" for 
my shell.

Hi Eric, 

A great resources for this question would be the Personal Telco Project.

There is a wealth of knowledge on the wiki web site at
http://www.personaltelco.net/

and a active Wireless mailing list that you can find information on
here:
http://lists.personaltelco.net/mailman/listinfo/


To give some answer to your question however I would have to say that
I'm sure there would be many issues with the GPL in trying to adapt the
ray_cs open source driver to a windows platform. And I don't know if
your card it to old to be supported here but I found this link to some
windows drivers for Aviator Cards.. http://www.raylink.com/software.htm

On a Debian system, it's "deluser", the counterpart to "adduser".
deluser can also remove a user from a group.

Billy,

Since you are running Redhat, and Debian has NOTHING to do with what you
asked, here's an actual answer for you:

userdel -r

-r removes the users home directory

Karl has just been added to my killfile.

I hope you re-think the killfile, as this knowledge is still useful.

with ldap first... if I have only ldap, I cannot log in at all to my box.
The way it's set up (files ldap), the nis-test user on the LDAP server shows
up in KDM, but I can't use it to log in, just like I can't su to that user.
When I do, the correct password segfaults, and the incorrect one is incorrect.

I can't figure out why that would happen, it obviously is correctly 
authenticating, otherwise it wouldn't know the diff between right/wrong pass.
I can find nothing on google, openldap.org, or anywhere else on this. 

The thing that makes it so difficult (for me anyway) is that there are two
mechanisms installed for using LDAP (nss_ldap and pam_ldap), which is the 
recommended way of doing it.

This is not an entirely fair assessment, many answers are not distribution
specific and are of value to people running other flavors of Linux, but
it is always a good idea to specify the distribution you are using so
people will realize that the answer may not always apply to their
distribution.  Many of us on this list (myself included) have answered
questions with something along the lines of:

   You might try XXX, that's how I do it on my systems which are running
   <enter your favorite distribution>

and I think that many people have been helped by these responses.

As it happens, the "userdel" command you give above is also included in
the Debian distribution, so had he picked this command instead of the
other, the answer would have been a useful response.  It is very difficult
to be sure which commands and features are distribution specific, and even
those that are today, won't necessarily be tomorrow.

When I inteviewed for a job at Sun back in 1998, it was with the
group who assembled the E10K. One of my interviewers (who had been
with the product from its FPS days) explained that the history of
the E10K was that it was first FPS, then bought by Cray, who then were
bought by SGI.

SGI had their own high-end servers similar to the proto-E10K, so in a
break with the rest of the computer industry (which is to discontinue
the product, & thereby force hundreds of people to scramble for new
jobs), they sold the division to Sun. And SGI proceeded to follow their
own drummer, thereby taking their stock price to the levels it enjoys
today.

A slightly different history from what Richard wrote.

You're probably right, the timeline I was looking at wasn't complete, 
and the more accurate one is up in the lobby - too far to walk just to 
answer a question. ;)

Anyway, I didn't think DEC had anything to do with it, which was my 
point.  Other than that, you can discount me entirely. :)

Being a former SGI employee, Geoff's recollection is correct.
SGI bought Cray and then sold the rights to the E10k to Sun.
I may disagree about that being SGI's downfall. It was most
likely about their lack of direction, i.e. getting rid of 
IRIX and becoming a total Linux vendor, and then changing that back.
Also Rick Belluzo being president and now being a Microsoft, uh, employee.
On second thought, he's not even a Microsoft employee any more. Their stock
might go up.

Interactive was sold to Kodak for a brief time on their way to Sun.  The 
company I worked for at the time used a mix of Interactive and AT&T, but 
Interactive had been less than helpful so we started using SCO instead.
When Sun bought what had been Interactive they had SunOS and wound up 
mixing the two.   (Or they had Solaris and Interactive was called SunOS 
for a bit.)  I just remember the Kodak bit the best.

That would be cool.  Maybe hack bash to prepend pwd to the front of each 
command?  Of course, this would screw up history recall if you used that.

Segmentation faults are the GPFs of the UNIX world.  They mean that an
application has tried to follow a pointer to memory outside its allocated
memory space.  This is almost always due to a program bug.

The best thing you can do is to get a stack trace of the core file ("gdb
qcad core", at the prompt enter "bt") and send the results to the
developers.  You might ask them if they want it first.  ;-)

For what it's worth, I've seen a lot of Qt bugs that cause segfaults.

In my quest to get my Panasonic CF-62 to work with Linux, I've started to 
think that getting a laptop made a little more recently would be a good 
idea.  

I've heard that there are a few places in the greater Portland area that 
have used laptops.  FreeGeek isn't one of them.  

The goal is to turn this laptop into a portable X-terminal so that my wife 
and I can share our current computer.  Space and other reasons preclude 
another computer (power being one).  I definitely do not need anything 
new.  However, I want one that is lightweight and has a good, clear 
screen.  

Does someone have any experience with used computer places in the area?  
I've done some searching, but only found broken links to places that do 
not appear to exist anymore.

Best,
Kyle

Used laptops seem a little iffy.  No one wants to give a warranty and they 
have often seen hard use.  Maybe Computer Renaissance does?  The store 
"Stuff", wanted $1300 for one with no return whatsoever, I wished them good 
luck.

A year and a half ago I bought the cheapest new Toshiba I could find at 
Circuit City ($800).  Only disappointment is the screen resolution and 
clarity.  I'm thinking a factory refurbished IBM Thinkpad would be a good 
way to go.

My favorite[1] bit of Interactive Unix was the existence of the
Microsoft copyright statement mixed in with all the other copyrights
that got displayed on boot.

[1] Favorite, in a sick, cynical, "so _that_'s why this is so painful to
    use/admin" way.

And you can also say: "Hey, that deluser thing sounds like a cool tool!  I wonder if it works on my distro?"  And then you ask Karl: "Hey Karl, is deluser an executable that I could recompile, or perhpas a script that you could give me?" And then you find out that deluser is just a PERL script, and you think: "Hey, I've got PERL on my distro, I bet deluser will work!" So you get the deluser script from Karl and he also provides you with the man pages so you can find out what other cool things it does.  You hack at it jut a little and Voila! it works!  Your distro of choice now has deluser.  And an answer that was not specific to your distro just made life easier for you.  And then you might think: "This is a really neat tool.  It would be great if this were in an RPM" so you do it, and share it with your friends.  And that is good, because that is the Linux way of doing things, and the beauty of the GPL.

And if you don't want to bother Karl with questions about getting the deluser script, you can go to http://people.pdxlinux.org/~pacopablo/deluser.html and read how to get deluser and adduser to work on your system.

DSL can't beat their price for what you get.  As for buying a cable modem, depends on how long you are planning on having cable internet.  AT&T switced the pricing recently so that owning your own modem only shaves $3 off of your bill instead of $10.  However, I have been seeing in the ads, that you can get a cable modem for around $40 after rebates (but you have to sign up for service there)  Also, if you haven't already signed up for the service, if you call AT&T you can get service for $19.95 for the first 6 months.  The trick is to tell them that you saw the offer.  They can't tell you about any offers, but if you tell them about an offer, then they can usually give it to you. (That is what I did).  Good luck.  I've been fairly happy with AT&T.

 Well the lease cost is $3 a month, the only benefit is that if the modem
dies then AT&T will replace it. You can get cable modems for between
$75-150, but the warranty is usually 3 months so if it dies you 
are stuck with the repair or rplacement cost. 
A year long lease is $36 so if you buy a cheap cable modem for $75 
and it last for two years then you have broken even. 

http://www.solutions4sure.com/ has cable modems for sale.

I signed up for cable when it was first offered by TTI. I took the modem
they offered, a COM21, or some such. Some months ago I started having
trouble that AT&T solved by replacing the COM21 with an RCA modem. Last
night I talked with a friend who lives in the same general area and who
started with TTI when I did. Last week he had to have his COM21 modem
replaced. The tech who came out and did the job said that AT&T is
turning off all the COM21's.

At one point I was thinking about buying my own modem to save a few
bucks a month. After learning that all modems are not alike, and that
the service won't work on some of them, and that which one is supported
can change, I decided that I would probably never buy a modem, but
always use the one supplied by the cable service. Plus, the price break
went away, as John pointed out.

Message-ID: <3D5E7187.70707@spamcop.net>

Can cron jobs be configured to run on the Nth specific weekday of each 
month?

I'm trying to set up an email reminder system that tells people about 
regularly scheduled meetings. For instance, the third Thursday of each 
month.

The third Thursday of each month would always have a day of the month 
range between 15 and 21 and a day of the week of 4. But this would run 
every Thursday as well as on the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th, and 
21st.

 From man 5 crontab:

Besides the Nth specific weekday problem, I also need to be able to run 
jobs on the last specific weekday, which will be either the fourth or 
the fifth, depending on the calendar.

If cron doesn't do it, what will?

It used to be that you could save money in the long run by buying your own
modem, however, ATT has decided that if you have purchased a modem you have a
monetary commitment to them and won't be switching to DSL any time soon.  So
they charge you a little more than if you get it from them.

You will need to price it out to see what makes more sense.

Motorola 4100 - Some have problems with the USB, so I would recommend
ethernet over USB (the MSO's don't like that answer, because they usually
shell out 5 bucks for a NIC, when they figure your USB ports cost them
nothing)

COM21 - I know people who love their modems and some who hate them.  They are
not completely DOCSIS 1.0 compliant (they will work on a system that has a
SNR a little higher than it should)

SA - There have been some problems with some of the firmware, but SA has been
good about resolving it.

I just learned that Seimens will be selling a line of modems @ Fred Meyers.
I met with the manufacturer the other day (not Siemens) and I was impressed

It's a little convoluted, but you could run a cronjob on the 14th of the
month which would launch an "at" command to run on the next occurance of
the day of the week you are interested in.

[snip]

For this one, the easiest ways I can come up with are:

1-Use cron to run a shell script every week on the day of the week you are
  interested in, then have the script test for whether or not it is the
  day you want by checking if there are at least seven more days left in
  the month, and if there aren't, then run the job you are interested in.

2-Use an approach similar to the one for your first question, but
  using multiple crontab entries, one for months that have 31 days, one
  for months with 30 days, and one or two for February (not quite sure how
  to handle leap years), set the entries to launch an "at" command to run
  on the next occurance of the day of the week you want, one week before
  the end of the month for each of these.

No, not without help.

We've got a regular mailing at work that goes out every other week; 
the only way to accomplish that trick is to have the script 
use 'at' to schedule itself to run again in 2 weeks.

In your case, I'd probably have a cron job that runs every Thursday,
but have the script (or whatever) check to see if the current date is 
within the acceptable range, e.g.,

  today=$(date +%d)

  if [ $today -lt 15 -o $today -gt 21 ]; then
    # don't need to run today
    exit 0
  fi

  # rest of script  

Alternatively, you can use a more complex check with something like
the Perl Date::Manip module.

This one is also fairly easy to solve using GNU date. Just do 
something like this every Friday (or whatever):

  monththisweek=$(date +%m)
  monthnextweek=$(date --date'+ 1 week' +%m)

  if [ $monththisweek -eq $monthnextweek ]; then
    # there are more of this day in the month; don't need to run
    exit 0
  fi

  # rest of script

Ah! I guessed that it would be something akin to FBO, which in the

City may get free Microsoft makeover

 N.O. would be used as a model

08/16/02

By Tara Young
Staff writer/The Times-Picayune

In a move that the city's chief technology officer said will make New
Orleans a "city of the future," Mayor Ray Nagin has entered a preliminary
agreement with Microsoft to update computer systems for City Hall and the
Police Department free of charge.

The only requirement the computer giant has made of the city is that New
Orleans let Microsoft use it as a model for marketing the system to other
governmental bodies once it is up and running, said Greg Meffert, the
city's technology officer. Eventually, he added, the city will have to
purchase software from the company, but he said it would be a "minuscule"
expense.

Microsoft officials could not be reached late Thursday, but Meffert said
work on the system will begin within two weeks. Meffert estimated the city
will save $100 million by accepting "the gift" of Microsoft's help and
software. Because these services are considered a gift, the city won't
have to publicly bid the project, he said.

The news comes one week after the administration canceled a $1.5 million
contract awarded last year to modernize the Police Department's
record-keeping. Meffert, who has been working for weeks on the Microsoft
deal, recommended the contract cancellation after saying the job could be
done for less than $100,000.

Microsoft Chairman and CEO Bill Gates and his entourage began to take New
Orleans seriously after an impromptu meeting held at a Xavier University
ceremony in mid-July, said Patrick Evans, Nagin's spokesman.

Meffert met again several days later with Microsoft executives at the
company's sales and marketing conference in New Orleans to discuss the
prospect of jointly developing and marketing software for other cities and
municipalities.

"The carrot for them is that they can work with an actual city to develop
this system," Meffert said. "They were extremely excited."

New Orleans police will be using a system Microsoft developed for the
state of Oklahoma. Dubbed the Offender Data Information System, the system
can link dozens of law enforcement agencies, jails and court systems. A
virtual crime-fighting tool, the system also provides officers with online
mug shots of suspects, warrants and other data. In Oklahoma, the system is
expected to expand into accident reporting, video arraignment and
automated pawn-shop-ticket tracking.

"It gives them a lot more weapons in fighting crime," Meffert said.

The New Orleans Police Department uses a system that holds 1 million
records and is in imminent danger of meltdown, city officials said. Backup
copies of most records exist on paper, but a crash could erase key data.

Few details were available Thursday concerning the system being developed
for City Hall records, but Meffert said it will be more efficient than the
current system.

"The systems that we are using right now . . . Elvis was still alive and
singing when they were made," he said.

Hmm,  does a 10 G  drop count? I work with a VOD appliance that is based on PC
hardware that can survive a bit of abuse. The funny thing is the hard drives
are mounted upside down. I always thought that wasn't a good thing to do, but
their testing showed that that was the position that survived impact the best.

I thought most car computers were also 16 bit x86 boxes? Seems they would have
to be survive if not launching from a canon, at least teenage drivers. 

I think that the need to have a server survive physical abuse is generally not
addressed by PC based server manufactures because that market is driven by
price. Sun is able, well maybe was able to, sell higher cost servers.  It will
be interesting to see what effect their X1 offering has on their market as well
as 64 bit x86 chips.

Anyone looking at the Apple servers?

It seems to me I read about Sun planning to build Hammer (Opteron, K8)
based servers for the lower-end server market.  At the very least, it
was a rumor.  I'd love Sun if they sold Opteron-based Linux-running
servers.  They're already in the 'like' department due to their
anti-Microsoftness.  :-)

The new chips are supposed to be able to scale well to two CPUs now
(well, at release) then up to 8 CPUs and perhaps beyond within a few
years.  Preliminary numbers would seem to indicate such systems would
kick the crap out of Xeons at significantly lower prices.  AMD's largest
obsticle currently is just getting people (OEMs, Teir 1 if possible) to
stop buying Intel chips because they are Intel chips.  They're slowly
gaining support, though.

You can browse specs in /proc/ide/ideX (where X=0,1 for primary and 
secondary controllers).  There seems to be some debate as to whether this 
info will stay in /proc in the 2.6 kernels, but for now, it's there.

Looks like Gnome provides a tool called `hwbrowser` that decodes the /proc 
entries and makes it easier to read.

Not sure what you mean by "create destroy point".  Mount points?

This can be a bit tricky. If you've got an ATA (IDE) drive, then the 
hdparm utility will list all sorts of cool info for you, e.g.,

  hdparm -I /dev/hda

If you've got a SCSI drive, there's no quick fix (as far as I know). 
You can use fdisk to display the geometry:

  [root]# fdisk -l

  Disk /dev/sda: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 4425 cylinders
  Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 bytes

Then do the math yourself. On my drive, there are 4425 cylinders, each 
of which has "16065 * 512 bytes":

  # using binary
  [root]# perl -e 'print ((4425 * 16065 * 512) / ((2 ** 30))'
  33.8972210884094
  # using powers of 10
  [root]# perl -e 'print ((4425 * 16065 * 512) / ( 10 ** 9))'
  36.396864

In other words, its capacity is either 33 GB (using binary counting)  
or 36 GB (using the base-10 method of counting favored by marketing
departments the world over :-).

> b)  available size

This is pretty dependent on any given drive's partitioning scheme...

> c)  partition

On GNU systems, "df -h" will tell you what you want to know.

> d)  its spec

Do you mean what the factory says the drive should do, or how well it 
actually performs?

Message-ID: <1973.216.99.218.67.1029743025.squirrel@sautez.dhs.org>

Hello, I have set up a DNS server to handle some domains.  I have been
succesfull of getting it all to work with www.domain.com and
ftp.domain.com and it response to mail.domain.com.  Apache and proftpd are
working fine.
However when I added the normal virtual domain entries to postfix they
don't work for outside mail.  I can send to the new domain just find from
the same server but if I send from another server the mail server just
tells me that the domain for the user doesn't exist.
I can not also ping domain.com  I can ping www.domian.com.  and if I use
nslookup and set the server to the DNS server it can not resolve
domain.com also.
Do I have my DNS setup wrong?  Is there a setting I need to set to allow
for just the domain to be resolved?  Or is Postfix missing something.  I
do run postfix chrooted and have added my new DNS server(itself) to the
resolv.conf file inside the chroot.

I didn't mean to imply that this alone led to SGI's downfall. God
help us when a time comes that keeping good & useful technology alive
& in development will lead to the inevitable death of a high tech
company. (Although I suspect many are run as if this were irrefutable

Well, I guess ``lack of direction" is another way of saying ``marching
to another drummer." After all, isn't that what Apple claimed to be
doing thru most of the '90s when everyone wondered what exactly they
were doing?

Hmm. This leads to a theory I had about Microsoft many years ago: that
since they had such a large chunk of the software market locked up, they
would inevitably get fat & lazy thus could not help but find that a
younger, more imaginative generation wouldl push them to the side &
perhance out of business.

Of course, this never quite worked out as I thought. On one hand, MS
is always finding new ways to shove more product into the pipeline &
thus make it appear that all is well -- whether or not they are engaged
in technically abusing their monopoly.[*] On the other hand, it appears
that many PHBs are being drawn to jobs at MS -- the kind of PHBs who
are at best ineffective, but usually cause all sorts of damage & loss
of income, yet have mastered the art of ``failing upwards" -- that is,
they emerge from each disaster they have created at still another job
with more pay & more power.

Geoff

[*] It always seems that whenever I am arguing with a MS apologist, &
have the apologist on the ropes, she/he responds with the excuse that
``technically" MS may have done something wrong -- a magical little word
that allows them to continue living in denial of the fact Microsoft is
not the perfect company with the perfect product they fervently believe
is the case.

I've seen competing services for 39 to 49 a month.
I chose Verison because of a very poor history of service from AT&T phone
service.
Verizon has been on the ball and prompt with all issues. Plus I got the
modem free.
768 down 128 up 49 a month after 3 months. first 3 were 29 a month.

 Well the lease cost is $3 a month, the only benefit is that if the modem
dies then AT&T will replace it. You can get cable modems for between
$75-150, but the warranty is usually 3 months so if it dies you 
are stuck with the repair or rplacement cost. 
A year long lease is $36 so if you buy a cheap cable modem for $75 
and it last for two years then you have broken even. 

http://www.solutions4sure.com/ has cable modems for sale.

This is a special invitation to anyone who would like to shape the
knowledge of Linux newbies.  We're not looking for commitments at
this point, just wisdom.  Of course if you want to brain dump at our
meetings, that would be welcome. :)

BLUE group will be meeting this Tuesday, 8/20/2002. (NOT Monday,
sorry about the site glitch...) The purpose of this meeting will be
to flesh out the direction of the group as a whole.

The primary goal will be to flesh out the "Canon." The Canon, is
supposed to be a long term list of repeating topics, about once every
year or so.

He're the working list:
* Installation
* Everything you *THOUGHT* you needed MS Windows for, accomplished w/

Linux.
* Security, including anti-virus.
* Utilites
* System Maintenance and Upgrade. RPM's etc.
* System automation. scripts, etc.
* Networking. Broadband and Samba and Routers.

We're meeting at the usual place this month, Round Table Pizza 10150
SW Beaverton Hillsdale Hwy. It's on the corner Beaverton-Hillsdale
Highway and Western Ave., behind the KFC.

I'm writing a script where I want to figure out what month it will be X 
weeks from today. If it were one week from today, I could use date like 
this:

date --date='+ 1 week' +%m

This stores it to a variable (X):

X=$(date --date='+ 1 week' +%m)

But what if the 1 in the above statement is itself a variable?

Y=1
X=$(date --date='+ $Y week' +%m)

I get this error:

date: invalid date `+ $Y week'

How do I proceed here?

If you have ~/<mail dir>/inbox defined as your mailbox (mine is:

  (setq rmail-file-name "~/.mail/inbox")

then that is where your moved mail resides.  If you simply edit this
file no mail is moved.

If you hit C-g while editing your inbox, mail is moved (typically from
/var/spool/mail/<your username>).  If you start rmail (w/, e.g., M-x rmail)
then mail is also moved and your inbox is "found" (emacs-ese for "edited").

If something goes wrong during the move (like your home dir fills up)
you can usually find the moved mail somewhere in your home dir because
`movemail' does an indirect copy from /var/spool/mail/<your username>
to ~/.mail/inbox via a backup file.

For the details do (w/in Emacs):

 C-h i m emacs <RET> 
 C-s movemail  <RET> <RET>

and start reading.

You also may get a hint about where the missing mail is by doing something
slightly more general than your search:

You also may get a hint about where the missing mail is by doing something
slightly more general than your search:

find ~ -type f | fgrep -i "mail"

and picking through the output for the backup file.

But I'd read the info page above before doing the latter.

Or double quotes.  Single quotes (apostrophes) hide/prevent variable 
expansion.

X=$(date --date="+ $Y week" +%m)


Btw, I had a similar need coming up and hadn't thought too much about how 
to s similar 'calculation'.  Thanks!

You need to use double quotes instead of single (noninterpolating) 
quotes around "+ $Y week".

$Y doesn't expand because it is enclosed in single quotes.

This works (on my machine):

Y=1
X=$(date --date='+ '$Y' week' +%m)

Have you ever seen the following calculations?  They may be useful to you
for finding a particular day of the week or year:
http://webexhibits.org/calendars/week.html

There a bit of history, then towards the bottom are some equations that
compute various calendar related things.

You can find other such goodies on google.  The search I used was:
number theory calculate day of week

Marvin, did you? (Try it, I mean)?

If it works I'd be mighty surpised since $(Y) will be just as enclosed
in quotes as $Y was.  Which means it won't expand.


<Rant on> I'd sure like to see people take the extra 5 seconds to
          actually test their proposed solutions instead if misleading
          people down dead-ends.  Especially when the proposed solution
          is trivially easy to test.  It is extremely frustrating to get
          17 solutions (as I did on another list with my recent xinerama
          problems) 16 of which were utterly useless, misleading,
          "solutions" from people who didn't even bother to read the
          problem statement fully.  (Thanks to the one or two who
          took the time to write a thoughtful answer.)

          It is actually better to not answer a question than to get a
          a non-sense answer that a newbie will believe as correct.
          He then tries it, bombs out, and says to his friends, "This

What a nice response to a rather nasty reply!  So nice, in fact, that
my conscience prompts me to apologise for my rather testy e-mail

Unfamiliar?  You don't know what PASA means??? Yeah, I know.  I put this 
together while running out to an on-site call.  For those who haven't 
figured it out, PASA stands for Portland Area Sys Admins.

Of course, the superabundance of acronyms in the technical industries leads 
to things like this, from a Cisco whitepaper on DSL:

<blockquote>
CPE represents any combination of end-user PCs or workstations, remote ADSL 
terminating units (ATU-Rs), and routers. For instance, a residential user 
may have a single PC with an integrated ADSL modem on a peripheral 
component interface (PCI) card, or perhaps a PC with an Ethernet or 
Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface to a standalone ADSL modem (the 
ATU-R). In contrast, business users will more often connect many end-user 
PCs to a router with an integrated ADSL modem or a router plus ATU-R pair.  

At the ADSL POP, the NAP deploys one or more DSL access multiplexers 
(DSLAMs) servicing the copper loops between the POP and CPE. In a process 
called subtending, DSLAMs can be chained together to enhance ATMpipe 
utilization. DSLAMs connect locally or via an inter-central office (CO) 
link to a local access concentrator (LAC) that provides ATM grooming,  PPP 
tunneling, and Layer 3 termination to local or cached content. A service 
selection gateway (SSG) may be colocated with the LAC, so customers can 
dynamically select destinations. From the LAC/SSG, services extend over the 
ATM core to the NSP or IP network core.
</blockquote>

What amuses me about this is that they leave lots of more obscure acronyms 
undefined, while painfully spelling out the meanings of acronyms one finds 
in newspaper adverts, like 'PCI' and 'USB'.

Shucks.  I thought I'd picked a time that didn't conflict with anything 
else, but I keep forgetting about PLUG-AT.  Is there anything on 3rd

This sounds like a job for
VMware. 
VMware network card is just a standard driver. Nothing special. You must
configure your Linux host correctly first. 
I wonder if they still have the free demo?

Subject: [PLUG] Can I use linux driver code for 'doze?


We have a wireless network at home.  The router and all machines but
one run Linux (LEAF on the router), and the cards are old Aviator
PCMCIA cards that use the modules ray_cs.o.  Though the manufacturer
dropped the card years ago, it still works with the latest kernel
thanks to the magic of open source (and somebody's hard work, of
course.)

Now the problem.  My brother had to get a new computer for school, has
to run windoze (teacher training!), and the machine won't work with
anything but XP.  For which there are no drivers available for the
wireless card.

Does anybody know how hard it'd be to adapt the Linux driver to work
on XP?  I'd have expected somebody to have done this already (maybe
somebody with some skill on the platform :-), but can't find anything
on the web.

Any other ideas?  Or should I just go blow $150 on a pair of "modern"
cards?  (One card would be for the router.  I don't think our old
cards are 802.11 compatible.)

Thanks,

--Eric House

Well, he mentions that the new machine won't run anything but XP.  I 
find that hard to believe, myself, however...  Why not FIPS a smallish 
partition for linux and see if it won't install anyway, just to see?

If there are no other options, you'll probably have to get newish cards 
like you mentioned.

Not a bad idea!

VMWare is kinda slow, though.  Win4Lin running Win9x would be a lot
faster and cheaper... but Win4Lin has no NT support.

VMWare costs $99 if you get the student discount (IIRC).  Otherwise it
is a lot more.  Win4Lin also offers a 10% student discount if you email
them and ask 'em about it.

VMWare has a 14 day free trial, I think.  The Win4Lin folks will do the
same for you if you ask them about it.

Subject: [PLUG] Meeting this Wed semi-canceled
Message-ID: <1029794230.23655.47.camel@rheingold>


Due to a dumb mistake on my part, the PASA (Portland Area Sys Admins)
meeting scheduled for this Wednesday in Salem at Advanced Corporate
Solutions is canceled.  I was gravely mistaken about the time; they had
intended 8:30 AM--not PM.  So, I assumed everyone who RSVP'd probably
wouldn't be able to make it and canceled.  They are, however, very
interested in having a meeting in the future, possibly October.

However, I'd still like to have a meeting.  Instead of going directly
for beer, I could put together a short presentation about what I'm doing
with Naked Ape Consulting that would be of interest of local sys
admins.  I would, however, need someone to host it, since my office
space (my home) would not be appropriate.  Be warned--it will be
assembled in a rush and I'm not a practiced speaker.

Or, we could not and leave the space open for the PLUG-AT meeting, which
I assume will be happening this month.

                Get off of the train at 60th Ave exit.
                Walk north on 60th to HALSEY ST.           about 4 blocks
                Walk west on HALSEY to 59th                      1 block

      The Netule Project is a project to build a family of special
      purpose Linux distributions.  So far we have built:

          FW-I  -- A firewall distribution
          EM-I  -- An Email server distribution
          WM-I  -- A Web server distribution

      and we would like to build distributions that are even more
      task oriented in the future.

      The current distributions are a mix between Open Source and
      Closed Source software.  I'm going to talk about what we have
      learned in building these distributions and why we why we
      would like to open the Netule Project completely.

      But mostly, I would like feed back from the group about:

          -  How can we make this project more attractive to
             the Linux community?
          -  How tightly should the project be organized?
          -  How should the project be organized in general?

      I don't expect this talk to be highly technical, but who knows?
      Mostly, I expect it to be interactive.  Be prepared to
      contribute ideas.

  PMFJI, but what about one of the little distributions on cdrom? Fire up
one of those and see what it shows without disturbing a thing on the hard
drive. In my naivety, this situation looks perfect for this tool.

So there are tons of web-based calendar things on Freshmeat.  I'm in a rush, 
so maybe someone knows one that has the features I require:

 o Publicly or anonymously modifiable
 o Ability to schedule recurring events
 o Has a good security record (yeah, I know, it's web-based and most have a   
really lousy history)
 o Perl, PHP, Python, or Zope; prefer no SQL db requirements (I can deal 
with the db if necessary, but I'd rather not)
 o Not too much of a PITA to set up

Nice to have:
 o Allow people to subscribe to get reminders via e-mail
 o Export to allow Evolution to import
 o Export to RDF for Evolution's summary/web sites/etc.  Actually, this 
would probably be the most preferred of the options.

the network can ping each other readily, can the floppyfw box see neither of 
the inside boxes?
Do I have the config scripts wrong?The floppfw box is sending OFFER and ACK 
calls to 10.42.42.100 . I have the inside DHCP set as;
SUBNET=10.42.42.0
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
DHCPD_FIRST_IP=10.42.42.100
DHCPD_LAST_IP=10.42.42.253
As per floppyfw config sample. Is this wrong?

 Well it is an interesting idea, the problem is how much resources 
do they have to enforce copyright and trademark laws against violators?
 Also they will run into problems trying to hunt down Asian spam 
where finding out who called is impossible with ISP type
phone cards.

a)  I also tried 'user" but it did not help.

b) Yes in the same user's name but without password.  There is no 
password.  This is an experiment.

Now I download "Samba-2.2.5-1" from Samba.org website and upgrade samba 
application

# rpm -qa|grep samba
samba-2.2.5-1

# service smb start
Starting SMB services: [ OK ]

Only "smb services" indicated. "nmb service" disappears. Is it correct for 
version 2.2.5-1 ??? Kindly advise me whether I need to have it reinstall 
!!!!!!!!

Thanks in advance

Stephen

 The same as any DHCP setup that uses attbi. 
In windows take a look at ipconfig and
Linux /etc/resolv.conf or /etc/dhpc?

Well at least for Mandrake, the pcmica config scripts rely in the
hotplug package which is installed when usb hardware is detected.  This
is a problem, when as in the case of my laptop there is pcmcia hardware
without USB.

The solution is to manually install the hotplug package.

Try a password and once you've set it on the XP machine run smbpasswd on
the smb server to synchronize the passwords. I've also found the DOS
prompt to be very helpful where the wizard is not. You can use the "net
view" command to see if the share is visible to the XP machine and then
try mapping it to a local drive with "net use g: \\samba_server\share".
This will at least give you an error message to work with.

The DIAGNOSIS.TXT file included with the samba package gives about nine
steps that really help figure out where the problem is. Give that a try.

Sorry I can't be more specific.

"SMB services" includes the nmbd. You can check to see if nmbd is
running with the ps command (ps ax | grep nmbd).

Call their customer service.  They have a misconfigured UBR.  Make sure you 
talk with their tier two. 


Explain that your "CPE is getting a 10 net address instead of public IP"  
Hopefully they are smart enough to figure it out.

the 10 net addresses should be getting assigned to the cable modem.

  It also appears to be too much of a hassle for every end user.

  I've downloaded a copy of Washington's anti-spam statute. After the dust
settles on the current budget circus in Salem (that's what we get with term
limits, but ...) I intend to package it as a legislative concept for the
next session (starting in January) and will lobby my local legislators (and
others I know) to sponsor it. Actually, the heavy work will wait until after
the November elections.

  If anyone wants to assist in this effort let me know off the list.

Once upon a time, at least a couple of years ago, I saw an email on the
kernel mailing list that mentioned this very thing.  I think the person
had a patch or module that could warp the system time as seen by a
particular process.  I wish I could remember more details.  If you are

That's good to hear about.  I should check on sourceforge also to see if
there has already been an attempt.  So far the very little research I have
done about it was about exploits.  Changing the behavior of a few select
system calls is useful if you plan to root a box, so there are some people
who are experts on this sort of trick.  But I think it maybe a useful
thing to bring into the main stream of the kernel.  If done correctly it
may even allow for normal users to test operating system functions without
having to modify the kernel directly.

I don't plan to spend a lot of time on it, unless someone else is
interested, but it is a fun learning oppurtunity, and project for now...

Well, if you're going to gripe about that, then I'm going to gripe
about the long long quote of entire messages with single phrase
response.  What is this, AOL?

It's best to edit out all but the particular part you are responding
to, then, leave one blank line below that, and enter what you have to
say.  There is no need to keep quoting and requoting what has gone
before; only the pertinent segments need be quoted (and correctly
attributed to the person who wrote it).  The record is the email list
archive.

You could also look at the kernel boot messages with "dmesg", wich are
probably also logged after boot in /var/log someplace.

I wonder if you mean "snapshot volume"?  Check out the EVMS project at
IBM.  The patches and tools are available in Debian also.  If you use
snapshot volumes, be sure an also apply the VFS lock patch, and if you
use XFS, be sure an apply the patch you'll find on the EVMS
sourceforge site.

  When I open the pine mailbox containing one of these thingies it takes a

I think Netscape has this option also.  But ... vVard is defined in two
parts:

	RFC 2425, MIME Content-Type for Directory Information and
	RFC 2426, vCard MIME Directory Profile

I did a quick search using google and found this site at the top.

I'm sure most anything is possible.  I don't seem to remember getting 
any of these (has to do with the company I keep - not many MSers ) so I 
can't say if I've seen the behavior you describe.  I too use pine.

Russ, at first I thought the term was a bit harsh too, but I went to
www.dictionary.com and read the following:

bigot

A person who is religiously attached to a particular computer, language,
operating system, editor, or other tool (see religious issues). Usually
found with a specifier; thus, "Cray bigot", "ITS bigot", "APL bigot", "VMS
bigot", "Berkeley bigot". Real bigots can be distinguished from mere
partisans or zealots by the fact that they refuse to learn alternatives
even when the march of time and/or technology is threatening to obsolete
the favoured tool. It is truly said "You can tell a bigot, but you can't
tell him much." Compare weenie.

[Jargon File]


According to that definition, I think bigot is really the best descriptor.

bigot

n : a prejudiced person who is intolerant of any opinions differing from
his own
Source: WordNet  1.6,  1997 Princeton University

Hey, they said it not me...(and I realize not listening is different from
intolerance, but they are similar).

ATT made it so only one computer can get access out from their DHCP

you want access with.  Looks like it's time to start NATing your

Hope this helps

I'd disagree, simply because it's not a matter of something being 
obsoleted. There's no advantage (IMNSHO) between Debian, Redhat, SuSE, 
Turbo, etc.

Also IMNSHO, giving an answer that does not apply to the distribution in 
question is the mark of a zealot.  It's as bad as a wrong answer, because 
you've just answered a question that wasn't asked. We've had discussions 
here on this list about giving distribution specific answers when the 
distribution is known and the answer doesn't apply to that distribution. If 
I ask a question about how something is installed with RPM, and Karl pipes 
up with "apt-get...", that doesn't help me, and is a waste of bandwidth. 
Almost as much as this message is a waste. Putting "iff debian" in the 
subject just makes it that much more of a zealot post. If your instructor 
at PSU asked a question on how to do something in Solaris, and you gave the 
correct answer for HP-UX, but it was wrong for Solaris, would this not be 
counted wrong on a test?

When I become a bigot because I refuse to listen to someone, something is 
wrong. I've a fairly open mind, but some of the things that are way out 
there just don't deserve my time. If I'm a bigot because I refuse to 
consider them (and I did consider them at one time...) then something is 
really really wrong with our political correctness... Moreso than I've 
thought in the past.

Again, Honor diversity, even if it disagrees with your diversity.

I think the part about it being obsoleted was a minor, minor part.  None
of the other definitions of bigot included it.  I picked the definition
because it applied to technology, and the quirks that us geeks have.
Perhaps I misunderstood it.

I got to OSU, but the point still holds, yes it would be wrong.  But this
isn't about exams and many times RH users have talked about this and that
and I thought, "gosh, but I use debian, how would I do that?" and before I
can ask, Karl told us.  The other thing, is that it was the simplicity of
solution (eg, apt) that made me want to try debian.  After I was using it
I found other reasons, such as moral (RH is a corporation, debian is more
GNU and FSF oriented).  But if people like Karl hadn't spoken up I would
have missed out on a lot in the past.

This nice little gem showed up in my mailbox today.  Looks like at least
one spammer has already started trolling the PLUG list for names.  This
was sent to my Sneakemail address used for the PLUG list.

It was my understanding that the PLUG list was kept private.  Is this not

What kind of restrictions are there on such an account?

I've been looking for some sort of permanent POP3/SMTP account.  It
looks like I'll end up setting up my own server with a dyndns (even
though it is a static IP) DNS setup.  I don't want to register a domain.

Ok, just ventured off-topic.  How does one go about setting up a drizzle
account to play around in Debian?  :-)

You don't need kernel hacks to do this; just a loadable library.  In fact, I 
can't actually think of how to do this in the kernel, but doing it through 
a preloaded library should be fairly straightforward.

A quick search on Google turned up this little gem:

This isn't entirely true.  You can create your own library with just the
functions you wish to replace, and use LD_PRELOAD to force your program to
use your custom version of these functions, but only if the program you
are running is not statically linked to the functions you are trying to
replace.  Most free software developers will use dynamically linked,
shared libraries because it makes their executables smaller, allows the
library functions to be updated without rebuilding their code, and there
is no major reason not to.  On the other hand, it has been my experience
that most commercial software developers/vendors will go with statically
linked programs because they often don't care that much about executable
program size on PC's, and static linking ensures that every customer is
running with the same, known version of the libraries, which makes
technical support and finding/fixing bugs much easier.

Of course, some vendors do use shared libraries, so it might work for this
particular case.  For a quick and dirty example of this:

====== libfaketime.c =========
/*  Override date/time related library function(s) */
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

time_t time(time_t *tloc)
{
   time_t RetVal;
   struct tm FixedTime;

   FixedTime.tm_sec = 0;      /* Current time 00:00:00 */
   FixedTime.tm_min = 0;
   FixedTime.tm_hour = 0;
   FixedTime.tm_mday = 1;     /* 1st day of month */
   FixedTime.tm_mon = 0;      /* January */
   FixedTime.tm_year = 102;   /* 2002 */

   RetVal = mktime(&FixedTime);

   // Return the time value
   if (tloc) {
      *tloc = RetVal;
   }
   return RetVal;
}
======== End of File ==============
To create the library, put the above code in the file "libfaketime.c"
and run this command:

   gcc -shared -Wl,-soname,libfaketime.so -o libfaketime.so libfaketime.c

Now to test it execute this line:

  LD_PRELOAD=./libfaketime.so date

this will run the standard Linux "date" command, forcing it to use the
dummy library, and will print out the fixed time value hard coded in the
library instead of the system date/time.  This should work with any
program that uses the "time" function and is dynamically linked, however,
there at least a couple potentially serious limitations:

   1 - If the program expects the system time to change during execution
       this may cause problems (though of course a more sophisticated
       version could be created which provides some kind of time
       increment).
   2 - There are other platform specific date/time functions which the
       program could use instead, though a good programmer won't unless
       there is a real need for it, since "time" is the POSIX standard
       routine and ensures portability.  Unfortunately, in my experience
       there are alot of bad programmers out there :-(  Of course if they
       used other routines and didn't statically lin them, they could be
       added to the library and overridden as well.

Just that you mind your P's and Q's and don't expect it to be a
supercomputer with infinite bandwidth.  No cracking, DOS or warez type
activity, mind you don't leave heavy processes running un-niced, etc.
If you opt to create a website in your ~/public_html directory, please
limit it to a business card and download area type site... and if you
think it will get slashdotted, we'd better do some advanced planning!

Other than that, you will have a non-root account on a Celeron 433MHz
with 128MB RAM and a 20GB hard drive.  The disk is managed by the EVMS
volume manager (LVM compatible volumes) and has reiserfs filesystems.

You may run "aptitude" if you like, to browse the plethora of packages
available in the Debian trove, and you may look anywhere in the entire
filesystem that the standard Unix user/group/permissions will allow.
(If I accidently set bad permissions on "/etc/shadow" you can crack it
if you like, but no fair doing more than saying "tag you're it" with
that.  Don't sabatoge the box while you're root if you find a way in,
in other words.)  Aptitude runs fine as a non-root user, you just
won't be able to actually install anything.  All of the other features
should work though.  I will install software on request provided there
is adequate disk space.

X forwarding will work with SSH, and you may run XEmacs that way if
you like.  It would be interesting to see how many people can work on
the web site at once that way...  Screen is installed, and the default
shell is Zsh.  Your home directory will be fairly well populated by
the skel copy when it is initialized; I hope you like the setup.

 % xemacs /usr/sbin/{add,del}user

If there's a root exploit you want to try, go ahead, but please don't
break anything and tell us how you got in and let's get it fixed
pronto.  Do NOT EVER use pdxlinux.org as a base of operations for
"security scanning" anything but your own computers, please, etc. etc.
Common sense should tell you what's ok and what's not in this regard.

Well, the account does come with an email address, though I'd prefer
it be, like the people.pdxlinux.org/~loginid web page, for light use
PLUG / LUG / Linux related activity; it'll be your "@pdxlinux.org"
address.  You may read it there via Squirrelmail, IMAPS, or use a
.forward file.

Email "karlheg at pdxlinux.org", and send me your SSH Protocol 2
"id_dsa.pub" or "id_rsa.pub" along with your login name, full name,
and a daytime telephone number.  I will create the account then email
you.  After you log in, you must "echo PASSWORD >
~karlheg/Drop_Box/LOGIN && chmod o-rw ~karlheg/Drop_Box/LOGIN" then
let me know about it so I can set the password for email access.  The
password is optional if you are going to use a .forward.

What's wrong with being a zealot?  (The Mark of the Zealot!)

Ok, so what's the word for someone who trounces on and attempts to
stiffle and repress anything regarding anything not deemed politically
correct or in keeping with their corporate image or business plan?

It's weird (weird and mounted for a trophy) how whenever Debian was
mentioned on the PLUG list, for quite a while, some of the more
verbose Red Hat "advocates" would attack the person mentioning Debian
GNU/Linux.  The first thing that came to my mind, as you may recall me
saying in an email to the list, was that perhaps they are selling Red
Hat to their customers, and are angry that anyone would present an
alternative.  Perhaps they are afraid to look bad or look pompous and
arrogant in the light of other viewpoints?  But that of course, is
conjectural, preliminary, and mostly the spinning of my own mind going
on skant evidence.  Right?  I mean, I'm probably just inventing a
character in my mind as a simulation or stand in for the people I
don't really even know.  And the way _that_ character thinks is not
necessarily the way the real person I'm attempting to simulate does.
(You're all just a bunch of ascii text to me anyhow.)

So, uh, what's the big spy secret that Red Hat ad campaign hinted at?
Is it anything to do with the rumored NDA that some are rumored to
have signed?  Y2k f00f sed.  Don't ask don't tell.

Sure, but no formal ban on Open Response was ever ratified by the
cabal.  (TINC) Just because you may have decided one way or another on
some issue that you saw as pertinent, does not mean that everyone else
holds the same set of convictions.  (Just because a corporate
marketting department says that public opinion is such and such does
not make nor prove the fact.)

Hmmm... perhaps I have been typing gobbledygook apt-get gobbledygook
apt-get and have merely hallucinated and deluded myself into beliveing
that I was engaged in intelligent discourse.  If I am elected no one
will ever have to do their laundry again!  - if it GLISTENS, gobble
it!!  An INK-LING?  Sure -- TAKE one!!  Did you BUY any COMMUNIST
UNIFORMS??  We're consing, right?

What about the several times where someone was struggling to build
some peice of software from scratch, and I offered that they might
find it useful to grab the source from Debian and see what the package
maintainer did?  Was that not a pertinent reply?

The gist of the "apt-get install ..." responses is: Why are you
spending your time building things from scratch (that are not part of
the distro you chose first try at this newfangled Linux thing) and why
are you wasting time hunting down stuff to meet software dependancies,
and why are you spending money that's probably not ever going to be
lining the pockets of the actual software developers?

Why not just join forces with us, share the toolset, share the
software, get in here with the biggest and best distro, the most well
organized and, most importantly, _republican_ project
(http://www.debian.org/devel/constitution).  Become a part of it if
you have qualifications and would like to do so.  Have a say in the
policy thing no matter what.  Let's have your two cents worth.  Any
ideas or suggestions?  Need anything special for your favorite
organization's computing infrastructure?  (Independant consultants are
available; let your fingers do the walking; and they pay no ad fees.)

You could have just typed "apt-get install ..." or "apt-get source
..." and been done with it in short order, because the package builder
and maintainer took over from where the software author left off, did
all the systems integration work for you, so you don't have to.  That
work is finished once and for all, so you can get on with YOUR
projects.

(The more free time you have the more you can contribute back to the
cause.  Finite time and effort are worth more than infinite money...
Don't just report a bug -- fix one, if you can, now that you have some
extra time...  and the tools that enable you to do so.  It's in your
hands, not tucked away at some distant corporate office.  Hoe a row.
Pick up a hammer and see.  Fix that damned paper wasting website ad
printer.)

It's not "corporate" against "non-corporate" or "commercial" against
"non-commercial" either... go there if you dare...  (and if you want
to wear a leash to work go ahead for all I care).  There are people
who are Debian volunteers who work for corporations and universities.
They might even have short hair, maybe are clean shaven, and they work
for major bigcity corporates.  They get PAID to work on Debian.  (I
don't want to hear <troll> the usual non-sequitur "doesn't give a
shit" bullshit about how Debian are a bunch of starving artist freaks
or somesuch.  We're NOT starving.  And we're not quitting either.)

Depends on how much stock Portland State Usury owns in the "Rote
Learning Template Corporation" perhaps.  Maybe they have a class
library for that?  A non-sequitur licence?  They won't sell you unless
you wear the leash to class.

In real life, you must apply your knowledge and experience to new
situtations.  You must assimilate and adapt in order to survive in
today's high tech buzzword job market economy.  Buck up biff.  $60.00
for a silly certification test and you think you're a god damned Linux
expert now.  Wee haw.  Ain't choo sumthin, college boy!  You wora

and that gives them the right.  Of course, it was for the greater
benefit of the corporate commonwealth, thank you here's your gold

"political correctness"?  What a gag.  Please explain to the class

Down with slogans!

Do you contradict yourself by claiming to be "open minded" yet
attempting (unsucessfully) to repress mention and elucidation of
alternative view points?  Or does "open minded" not imply also
"tolerant and encouraging of other points of view and ways of not
inventing here"?

Mighty white of you to have at least once considered my point of view.
I remain <sarc /"ever so humble"/ in my opinion, and am looking
forward to hearing your cork popping rebuttal.

Freedom is Quality.  Quality is Freedom.

I prefer RedHat, but I manage systems running Debian, SuSE, Turbo, Caldera, 
and Immunix. Along with FreeBSD, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, and Tru64. I've got 
enough experience with each of them to know that each has it's pluses and 
minuses, and that one is not inherently *better* than the others. I don't 
have any problems with most corporations, so Redhat works for me.

Maybe I'm using the word wrong. I'd say a zealot is about the same as a 
bigot, as defined earlier in this thread. i.e., devoted to the cause beyond 
reason. In other words, even if debian was proved inferior, a zealot would 
still push it as the best thing since sliced bread.

I don't think it was debian being attacked. I think it was the same old 
argument. A debian specific answer to a non-debian question is still not a 
correct answer. *IF* the generic or "other distro" answer accompanied the 
debian specific answer, that would be one thing.

I can't answer that, as I don't know. I'm a Engineering SysAdmin, not a

I realize that. But I thought it was generally recognized that confusing 
the already flustered newbie folks with answers that won't work in their 
environment was detrimental to the proliferation of Linux in general. As a 
former On-line Tech. Support Engineer, I am sensitive to how folks perceive 
the help they get on-line.

And I don't have any problem with that. I think you (as well as others on 
this list) have a wealth of information to offer. It's this one little 
sticking point that I have a problem with, and that's those distro specific 
answers to (not) solve the problem on another distro.

I'm only singling out debian because debian users seem to be the only ones 
that do this.

You know, that's funny. But now your attacking. For your information, I 
don't have any "certifications", "licenses" or even a college degree. I did 
go to college, and have two years of schooling... for Auto Mechanics. Wow, 
that really helps in the Computer Industry, doesn't it.

Actually, I'm a big proponent of "Political Correctness, isn't." That's 
what the "Moreso than I've thought in the past." was supposed to convey.

You know, this isn't about debian vs. (distro of choice). It's about 
answering a question correctly, so the poor guy can use his computer. If 
he's already got RedHat on his system, and wants to keep it, an answer 
specific to any other distro isn't going to help.

A policy on this that I've always stuck by is to let the admin know in
advance of any attempts.  This saves him/her from running around trying to
figure out who's hacking their box.  It also eliminates using this as an
excuse after a "real" attempt.  ;-)

Hi Matt,

You might need to dig a little deeper about what aspect (or
functionality) of Project that you need to replace.  Like most Micro$oft
Suites, a large portion of the software is not needed (or used) by most
people.  In searching for free replacements, you should focus on the
jobs that need to get done instead of replacing the whole Suite.  I
think you will have a much better chance of succeeding that way.

Only about $0.02 worth.

Yep. I acquired a valid IP address between 4:00 and 5:00 yesterday 
afternoon. It's on the 12.241.0.0 subnet, which afaik hasn't been part 
of the attbi network to date. In fact, the attbi admins haven't even

You're confusing things.  A vCard is a special attachment that has contant 
information in a well-defined (by RFC) format.  It could be easy to "fake" 
such a thing.  A digital signature is a vague term, and could be something 
as simple as clicking on a button on a web page.  A CRYPTOGRAPIC signature, 
OTOH, can either be self-originated (as PGP signatures are) or they can be 
gotten from a Certificate Authority (as S/MIME signatures are) and they are 
almost impossible to fake, current CPU power being what it is.

BTW, I'm posting with Knode, is my PGP sig working as expected?

Odd. I don't think I had any outages since last week 
when it was down for a day. (Thursday?)  It had gone 
down around 1:30 am. (I run a couple cron scripts at 1am 
and 2am that download some stats. The 2am didn't get out)
I noted it when I left in the morning, but didn't do 
anything.  Got home around 2pm and saw an AT&T truck out 
front.  Apparently, the house across the street had 
commplained.  I got added onto the service call (It was 
a neighborhood problem) and a couple hours later 
everything worked fine.  Since then, no problems. (well, 
with my cable....)

I agree that the debian answer might not have been correct for Red Hat, but I don't think that it was an entirely useless answer either.  It brought to light another way of accomplishing the task.  It also led me to research how to port the debian tool over to Red Hat (well, Mandrake, but now it will ok on Red Hat too.)  I think that the debian answer was good because it informed the new user.  It is up to the new user to decide how to use the information received.

I have not been an On-line Tech Support Engineer, but as one who has had to call tech support for various reasons.  I wish that they would treat me as someone who has a brain (not to say that you did, but this has been my experience with tech support). I welcome advice that they give me.   A, "Hey, you might want to try this in the future" would be great.  Once again, I don't think that posting an alternate way to solve the problem in a different distro is bad.  It gives the user options.  The user should be able to decide which option they want to choose.

But his answer did help me solve the problem on a non-debian distro.  As I posted before, if you want to user adduser and deluser on Red Hat or Mandrake or any other distro, check out the page that I put up. 
http://people.pdxlinux.org/~pacopablo/deluser.html
Just because it is specific to another distro, doesn't mean it can't help me.  Especially in the Open Source community.

It CAN help.  This is Open Source.  People are encouraged to find new and different ways to do things.  If it's not available yet, go make it!  Isn't that the beauty of Open Source?  That we have the option of doing what we want?   I'm not saying that we should only give non-distro specific answers.  But I do think that non-distro specific answers are relevant and can be helpful.

      The Netule Project is a project to build a family of special
      purpose Linux distributions.  So far we have built:

          FW-I  -- A firewall distribution
          EM-I  -- An Email server distribution
          WM-I  -- A Web server distribution

      and we would like to build distributions that are even more
      task oriented in the future.

      The current distributions are a mix between Open Source and
      Closed Source software.  I'm going to talk about what we have
      learned in building these distributions and why we why we
      would like to open the Netule Project completely.

      But mostly, I would like feed back from the group about:

          -  How can we make this project more attractive to
             the Linux community?
          -  How tightly should the project be organized?
          -  How should the project be organized in general?

      I don't expect this talk to be highly technical, but who knows?
      Mostly, I expect it to be interactive.  Be prepared to
      contribute ideas.

Out of the non-linux do you have a preference?  As a user I prefer Solaris
over HP-UX, and Tru64 never gave me grief, but it did give our ONID
sysadmins here at OSU some grief.

I don't think it helps in a literal sense, but I bet the trouble shooting
skills and the ability to learn hands on helped you a lot.  The ability to
look at a multidimensional problem and mentally ignore the parts that
work, so that you can focus on a solution.  Fixing thing is a skill,
regardless of the domain.

I've never worked with HP-UX, but I greatly preferred AIX over Solaris, 
Digital UNIX (v4 back then), IRIX, SCO OpenServer, BSD/OS.  I really loved 
the LVM, JFS, and SMIT, and it ran on some really sweet hardware.  IRIX was 
kinda cool too, as a workstation, and the SGI hardware rocks.  NeXTSTEP was 
nice as a workstaion too...

Subject: [PLUG] need some font help (Mandrake)
Message-ID: <20020821195752.D1B07178FF@medulla.enet.sharplabs.com>

I'm trying to get the whole complement of ttf fonts working
on my Mandrake 8.2 system.  So I did:

Mandrake Control Center --> System --> Fonts --> Advanced Options --> Add

and I added the windows 98 font directory on a remote machine that
I have NFS-mounted on the current machine.

Then I binked on Get Windows Fonts and the Font installer did it's thing.

It created two dirs in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/drakfont

namely `ttf' and `Type1' and stuffed these full of fonts.

It also auto-modified /etc/X11/fs/config

adding the last two lines to the catalogue:

          catalogue = /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc:unscaled,
          	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/drakfont,
          	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi:unscaled,
          	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi:unscaled,
          	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc:unscaled,
          	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1,
          	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TTF,
          	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo,
          	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/pcf_drakfont:unscaled,
          	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/mdk:unscaled,
          	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/mozilla-fonts:unscaled,
          	/usr/share/fonts/default/Type1,
          	/usr/share/fonts/ttf/big5,
          	/usr/share/fonts/ttf/decoratives,
          	/usr/share/fonts/ttf/gb2312,
          	/usr/share/fonts/ttf/japanese,
          	/usr/share/fonts/ttf/western,
          	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/drakfont/ttf,
          	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/drakfont/Type1


I'm not sure what else it did.  I brought down X and restared the fontserver,
then restarted X.

Now when I do

Mandrake Control Center --> System --> Fonts --> Font list

I see a bunch of new fonts listed, some of which have a "(microsoft)"
after their name.

Problem is that when I bink on any of these  (microsoft) fonts it
says "The selected font is not available" and no font displays
in the window.

Interestingly, it appears that most (all?) the (microsoft) fonts in the list
have an identically named font followed by "(unknown)" just under it in
the list.

So, for example, I see in the list:

tahoma (microsoft)
tahoma (unknown)

Binking on the (unknown) version shows a font.

Is this normal?  Why do I see know (microsoft) fonts?
What's going on?

Well, I find that Solaris has the best help (for a non open source product) 
and in some cases, the documentation Sun provides on the web are better 
than the how-tos I've used. Solaris also seems to be much more stable than 
HP-UX and AIX, even on their own hardware. Tru64 is pretty good. I fear 
that it's on it's last legs, after Compaq and now HP get through with it. 
If HP was smart, they'd migrate the HP-UX users to Tru64...

Agreed, that's a good way of seeing things.  In this vein, I suppose 
it's not that odd anymore that I work on my own cars and my own 
computers.  I don't need to take my computers to the 'shop' to get a 
driver issue fixed, nor do I need to take my car in to have the oil 
changed (or the transmission, for that matter).

Now I have to figure out just *why* I'm weird though...  Thanks alot.  :P

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.44.0208211417150.22861-100000@eel.ENGR.ORST.EDU>

Sorry for the OT post, but I'm desperate...I googled but that didn't help
me.

The problem is that we install from an image.  Saves us a lot of time,
blah, blah, blah.  Well the image tries to map network drives, it is an
artifact from the setup process.  The normal users that will be logging on
do not need them.  The network drives require a password to map, since
they are shares that us administrators use.  It only asks to map the
drives the first time a user tries to login, so I *could* login as all the
users, but that would be lame.  What I want to do is make it *not* try to
map those drives anymore.

I have tried logging in as the configuration account, letting it map the
drives and then disconnecting them, but it didn't solve the problem.

Any clues?

Thanks,
Jason

Well, I'm sure you've already figured out that A) you perception of what
is "generally recognized" might possibly be incorrect and B) something
that is generally recognized is not necessarily the belief of all people.

Personally, I don't think you've made any compelling case for the argument
that answers relevant to other operating systems and distributions is
detrimental to anything at all, so long as those answers are clearly
labelled.  I also think Karl made a strong counterpoint (to your
non-point) when he wrote that a solution in Debian serves to show a user
or administrator how the Debian system provides simple solutions to
problems that have complex (or merely convluted) solutions in other
environments.

Now, I don't run Debian on most of my boxes (just one).  I prefer to do
things manually pretty much all the time when it comes to my home
systems.  But I recognize that I need to regularly re-invent solutions
already embedded into other systems.

When I ask a question, I try to make clear which types of solutions are
important to me.  For example, I will often mention that I am not
interested in non-Free software.

I think people using this list as their personal helpdesk could benefit
much more if they asked WHY people choose one solution over another when
presented with multiple options.

Quite frankly, when I see these Debian v. Red Hat discussions on this
list, I am stunned by how few people actually support Red Hat on technical
merits.  Usually the argument is simply reduced to "Diff'rent strokes for
diff'rent folks" and the Red Hat users urge the discussion dropped.  I've
yet to hear anyone argue that Red Hat is actually superior to Debian in
any way.  Instead, Debian supporters are branded and their arguments
dismissed as zealotry.

By the way, "zealot" has a couple of meanings.  The first is merely a
person with enthusiasm in a particular pursuit.  I think Karl was owning
up to that sense of the word.  There is another sense in which the word is
used to describe FANATICAL devotion.  I don't think anyone here would
argue that Karl's devotion to Debian is uncritical.  That is to say, I
think he has made a critical choice and devoted himself enthusiastically
to the cause.  Honestly, I would say that Debian supporters are probably
some of the MOST critical of the Debian system and that's what pushes it
to such a high standard.

Can you run a post-install script that does something like

  net use [blah] /delete

Alternatively, can you find out where that share gets stuck in the 
registry and remove it during the post-install process?

I haven't checked the latest Debian, but I would say Red Hat is easier 
to install and worked with all my hardware.  This may of changed with 
the woody release.

I've been playing around with different distributions on my Sony Vaio 
PCG-F580.

Ones I've gone through the entire install and used for at least a few 
days: SuSe 7.3, SuSe 8.0, Redhat 7.3, Mandrake 8.2, Gentoo 1.2

Of these, only Redhat installed correctly.  Mainly due to my pcmcia NIC. 
SuSe needed tweaking of a conf file before it would work, but probably 
needed the second least amount of work to get running the way I wanted 
it too. (For some reason, Mandrake gave me trouble, but I don't recall 
what now.)
On the other hand, having the Redhat site busy for updates all the time 
means I haven't done any patches. (Though, I'm betting I'm missing some 
mirror...)
With SuSe, that was easy.  Their update tool works flawlessly for me. I 
happen to like SuSe a lot and will be keeping my main server running it 
for some time.

I'm going to go back and load Gentoo again.  I found that distribution 
to be a fun delve into the nuts and bolts. Plus I do find running at the 
cutting edge to be a bit of a thrill.  The only reason I threw Redhat on 
was because I knew it would be a quick load and I was pressed for time 
when I reloaded. (I had a couple problems with X and sound. Just enough 
to be a pain.)

I might try Debian again just for to check it out again.

-Mark

Because, speaking from the people I know, Red Hat people either a) Don't 
know enough to argue one way or the other or b) Know enough not to bother 
arguing.  My current attitude is this, copped from someone on Kuro5hin: 
"Winning an argument on the Internet is like winning a gold medal in the 
Special Olympics: You might be the champ but you're still a retard."

I'll give it a whirl.  Yeah, it's acting weird.  The first time I typed
it, it seemed to work, but I tried it on the other shares with no luck.
It says the share doesn't exist, but net use lists it.

If I can fix it on one machine I can just update the image we use.  The
mapping happens before the user sees the desktop, so it would have to be a
permanent solution, and for all users...

I did find in in the registry, under HKEY_CURRENT_USER and HKEY_USERS, do
you think I should delete it?  I don't want to screw up the registry...

I know...me too.  Windows administration is so weird, a lot of the time

The knowledge base is good, but really hard to grep.

I don't understand that second statement.  Are you saying that you just
assume that nobody will listen and give creedance to reasoned, critical
arguments?

I haven't yet reached that level of cynicism and I hopefully never will.  
I am truly sorry that some people have.

Oddly, mine does seem to be configured to send me copies of my own posts
(which makes sense, since this is very new behavior).

I'll look into it further.

Routing was _not_ okay during the _whole_ outage.  I got a "support
call" from my father who lives on the West Side (Cedar Hills).  When I
talked to him, around 1 or 2 pm, he had no WAN (cable) link light.
DHCP went out for him in the early morning hours (circa 1 or 2 am) and
everything was back to normal at about 4 pm.  On the East Side (NE
Portland), I never saw a burp the whole time.  Maybe my dhcp-client
was busted ;-).

Watch your quoting, sir!

The above statement was written by karlheg at hegbloom.net, NOT
AthlonRobNF at cs.com.

Your editting has given an extremely misleading attribution.

Please submit a correction to the list to confirm this and be careful in
the future.

Those of us who work in digital information have an obligation to the
highest standards of data authentication considering how malleable our

I can only say, AT&T was having routing problems extending FAR beyond AT&T
Cable Modem services.

We had major routing issues here at work, which caused much traffic having
to be rerouted.

I also saw a few people who said they got new IP addresses, and I was one of
those also.

To avoid avidity, perhaps?  The modern world tempts man to fritter away his 
energies in a thousand directions; the Internet now allows one to fritter 
away life on a scale not known before...

[...]

Personally, I am pretty tolerant of this kind of thing.  If you look
carefully at the quoting, it is clear who said what.  The "mistake"
was leaving the who-said-it line in when all of their text had been
snipped.  There is always the previous posts in your own or a public
archive to check if you want to know for sure.  Personally, I'd rather
see people make this kind of mistake than not bother trimming down
quoted text at all.

Yes, the positioning of the lines does have the effect an "optical
illusion", but it was almost certainly unintentional and I think there
is at least as much burden on the reader to read carefully.

Subject: [PLUG] [mod_perl 1.2x] Intermittent code execution errors
Message-ID: <20020821162043.C25432@dalsemi.com>

PLUGgers,

This is a copy of my email to the mod_perl list. If any of you have
ideas as to how to go about debugging this, or suggestions for other
things to try, I'd really appreciate it.  I've been working on this for
about 4-5 weeks in my spare time in the evenings and I'm stumped.


[This is an update from my earlier posting which was entitled
"mod_perl has Alzheimers?".  Since then I've read through the
mod_perl guide, searched the mailing list archives, and done a
more thorough job of analyzing the debug output.]


I recently got a new server for our website, and installed RH7.2 on
it and shipped it off to the colo.  Since then, I've been getting
lots of 404 server errors, so I added debugging code to the stacked
content handler (a modified version of Apache::NavBar).

Here's the debug output from a "good" process.  There are snippets of
code down below so that you can understand the flow. The code itself is
attached to the email.

  NavGraphics(30165): conf_file = >/etc/httpd/etc/Sunset6.template<
  NavGraphics(30165) time=1025358762
  NavGraphics(30165): exists
  NavGraphics(30165): plate not cached
  NavGraphics(30165): plate
  NavGraphics(30165): before new
  NavPlate(30165): new </etc/httpd/etc/Sunset6.template>
  NavPlate(30165): after fh
  NavPlate(30165) ref: Text::Template
  NavGraphics(30165): after new Apache::NavGraphics::NavTemplate=HASH(0x8270b7c)
  NavGraphics plate(30165): Text::Template
  30165:/home/httpd/html/index.html:Text::Template:

The handler sees that it's cache is empty (it was just spawned), so it
calls new to create a new entry in the cache, which calls new for
Text::Template to get the templating object.  The template object is
returned to the handler and information from the page is used to
populate the object.

Here's the debug output from a newly spawned "bad" child.

  Graphics(30166): conf_file = >/etc/httpd/etc/Sunset6.template<
  NavGraphics(30166) time=1025358762
  NavGraphics(30166): exists
  NavGraphics(30166): plate not cached
  NavGraphics(30166): plate
  NavGraphics(30166): before new
  NavGraphics(30166): after new Apache::NavGraphics::NavTemplate=HASH(0x82689a4)
  NavGraphics plate(30166):
  30166:/home/httpd/html/Ministries/index.html::
  [Thu Aug  1 10:27:18 2002] [error] Can't call method "fill_in" without a package or object reference at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/Apache/NavGraphics.pm line 48.

This is similar to the "good" child, except notice that there's no
output from the templating object code (which was prefaced NavPlate).
However, "something" is placed into the cache and is returned to the
handler, but it isn't a Text::Template object.

Here's the debug output from a "bad" child on it's second request:

  NavGraphics(30166): conf_file = >/etc/httpd/etc/Sunset6.template<
  NavGraphics(30166) time=1025358762

  NavGraphics(30166): after new Apache::NavGraphics::NavTemplate=HASH(0x82688a8)
  NavGraphics plate(30166): 
  30166:/home/httpd/html/Web/WebPolicy.html::

As above, except now the object is cached.  However, the caching code
correctly determines that the cache doesn't contain a Text::Template
object and tries to create a new object.  However, it fails.  There's
no debug output from the new method, and whatever is created by new
doesn't contain a Text::Template object.  Interestingly though,
something different from last time is returned, which indicates that
the call to new did something.  And if you print out what it did
return, you find the text of the template instead of the template
object.

As a stopgap, I tried making a second call to new if the first call to
new failed to return a Text::Template object, it also fails with no
debugging output so it appears that no calls to new will work in a
"bad" child process.

Here's the relevant sections of code from the module:

##The PRINT method for the Apache::OutputChain handler
sub PRINT {
  my $self = shift;
  my $r = $self->[0];
  my $bar   = load_nav($r);
  my $plate = load_plate($r);

  local $_ = join '', @_;
  my ($header, $content);
  ($header,$content) = m#<HEAD>(.+)</HEAD>.*<BODY.*?>(.+)</BODY>#si;
  my $thash = {
   'left_nav_java'    => $bar->java,
   'header'           => $header,
   'navigation_table' => $bar->table,
   'content'          => $content
  };
  warn join ':', $$, $r->filename, ref($plate), "\n";
  if (ref($plate) ne 'Text::Template') {
    warn join '', "NavGraphics($$) PRINT: >", $plate, "<\n";
  }
  my $result = $plate->fill_in(HASH => $thash);
  if (defined $result) {
    $self->Apache::OutputChain::PRINT($result);
  }
  else {
    warn "ERROR: $Text::Template::ERROR\n";
  }
  return OK;
}

##The template object caching subroutine
##Note the warn statements and their order
sub load_plate {
  my ($r) = @_;
  my $conf_file = $r->server_root_relative($r->dir_config('MyTemplate'));
  my $mod_time;
  if (-e $conf_file) {
    $mod_time = (stat _)[9];
  }
  else {
    $conf_file = '';
    $mod_time = 0;
  }
  
  warn "NavGraphics($$): conf_file = >$conf_file<\n";
  warn "NavGraphics($$) time=$mod_time\n";
  warn join '', "NavGraphics($$): exists ", exists $TB{$conf_file}, "\n";
  
  return $TB{$conf_file}->template()
    if exists($TB{$conf_file})
    && ($TB{$conf_file}->modified() >= $mod_time)
    && (ref($TB{$conf_file}->template()) eq 'Text::Template');
  warn "NavGraphics($$): plate not cached\n";
  warn "NavGraphics($$): plate $TB{$conf_file}\n";
  warn "NavGraphics($$): before new $TB{$conf_file}\n";
  $TB{$conf_file} = Apache::NavGraphics::NavTemplate->new($conf_file);
  warn "NavGraphics($$): after new $TB{$conf_file}\n";
  warn join '', "NavGraphics plate($$): ", ref($TB{$conf_file}->template()), "\n";
  return $TB{$conf_file}->template();
  
} 

##The new method for Apache::NavGraphics::NavTemplate
package Apache::NavGraphics::NavTemplate;

sub new {
  my ($class, $templateFile) = @_;
  warn "NavPlate($$): new <$templateFile>\n";
  unless ($templateFile) {
    warn "NavPlate($$) Empty templateFile sent\n";
    return bless { 'template' => '',
                   'modified' => 0 }, $class;
  }
  my $fh = Apache::File->new($templateFile) || return;
  warn "NavPlate($$): after fh\n";
  my $template = Text::Template->new(
                                   TYPE   => 'FILEHANDLE',
                                   SOURCE => $fh,
                                   DELIMITERS => ['{{', '}}']
                                 )
    or warn "($$)Problem with template: $Text::Template::ERROR\n";
  warn join '', "NavPlate($$) ref: ", ref($template), "\n";
  return bless({ 'template' => $template,
                 'modified' => (stat $templateFile)[9] }, $class);

}

The spawning of a bad child appears completely random and load
independent, which probably means that it isn't a memory problem.
However, I had the memory of the machine scanned and I've been able to
duplicate the problem on a completely different machine.

I've tested and seen the problem on:

RH6.2, with updated mod_perl and apache rpms (I forget the exact versions)
RH7.2 
  mod_perl-1.26-2 (from rpm)
  apache-1.3.22-6 (from rpm)
  mod_perl-1.27   (compiled from source)
  apache_1.3.26   (compiled from source)
RH7.3
  apache_1.3.26   (from rpm)
  mod_perl-1.27   (from rpm)

At this point, I don't understand why the output from warn in the "new"
method aren't going to the log file, or why Text::Template is returning
the template code instead of an object.  The debugging examples
from the website are pretty daunting, I could generate 100 Mb's of
log files with no errors, only to find that when I restart the server
that a "bad" child is started right away (which happened the night
before last.  I put about 240K hits on the server with no errors.
Then I made a few modifications to httpd.conf, restarted the server
and got an error right away.  Changing the config back to the original,
however, didn't make the problem go away).

Has anyone seen behavior like this, or have suggestions on how to
make the debugging a little easier?  Should I just wade in and see
what happens?  Is there some other combination of software that I
should try, like a different version of Perl itself?

Thanks for your help,
Colin Kuskie

"Very funny" (charmed, I'm sure), and very in character.  I guess if
you don't want to hire someone you don't have to.  By the same token,
I don't have to work for someone I don't want to work for.  Or pay
tuition somewhere I don't want to be a student.

So you subscribe to the "philosophy" that the user is a moron who must
be given only the bare minimum amount of information and given that in
simple words, and that they are easily confused due to poor reading
skills?  That all of the users are "non technical"?  Perhaps it takes
one to know one?  I think that this so called "philosophy" is one of
the most detrimental barriers to entry that exists in the computer
industry.  It is insulting.

It's better to expose them to new things and to teach them to write
their own homework assignments and how to follow through and find
answers for themselves.  Then the task for the experts is to document
everything sufficiently and make that documentation available.

The thing is, that in the real world, they will always encounter "non
standard" configurations and setups (like Red Hat's).  They must learn
to adapt, and to do so from the beginning.  The other thing is that
just because you use Red Hat and that you buy into the marketting BS
about how "Red Hat is synonomous with Linux" doesn't mean that
everyone else buys that advertising claim or that everyone else uses
your favorite brand of Linux.

You cannot PROVE that Red Hat is the most popular distro or that there
are more copies of it installed.  And for that matter, where and who
has installed what brand of Linux is probably more pertinent wrt "best
distro" than number of installs or especially number of copies sold.
Note that I am trying to be very careful not to make any false claims
regarding the relative popularity or fitness of the Debian
distribution.  It's a cavet emptor and see for yourself situtation.  I
am NOT the marketing department.

But they present an alternative solution, another angle, and the
similar howto information for users of the Debian (or slackware or
whatever) distribution.  You are free to ignore the non Redhatlike
centric responses if you like.  Just hit "next message" and get on
with your lives.

Perhaps it does help.  Cooking on the line in a restaurant actually
provides plenty of analogs to what can go on inside a multi processing

But my answers are technically correct!  And the poor guy is using
Debian rather than spending grocery money on Red Hat CD's.  Rich man

Do the cartoons and soft round cornered GUI provide the illusion that
it is easier to install?  Does the simple and elegant TUI of the
Debian "boot-floppies" install really make it seem that hard to
install?  Does the Red Hat installer speak 8 or 10 languages?

You don't NEED automatic device detection when you are installing
Debian from a CDROM.  You can install the base Debian system without
ever loading any driver modules.  After the base is installed and the
post install reboot, you simply type:

# apt-get install discover aptitude

... and at that point you will have hardware auto detection and a
wonderful TUI for software installation managment.

# apt-get install etherconf

... and you'll have network configuration, which you can change at any
time with a simple (once you learn of it):

# dpkg-reconfigure etherconf

Is that an i386 arch CPU?  What is it?  Will it hibernate (suspend to
disk)?  If it's capable of it, I know how to make that work under
Linux.  All of the tools required are part of Debian, but not in the
default installer...  I have a static copy of "lphdisk", which is
required to format the hibernation partition.

Would you like a Debian 3.0r0 (Woody) CDROM so you can try that also?
I can burn one for you if you like, no charge.

PCMCIA should work just fine in the Debian installer.  I've tested it
on my laptop, and had no trouble at all.  It Just Works.

There are a lot of Debian mirrors, and I've never had any trouble
getting through on donated bandwidth.  They have a brand new security
build system set up, and security updates are out very soon after the
upstream patches become available.  You can subscribe to the
"debian-security-announce" mailing list to be promptly notified when
update packages become available on the mirror network.

Does SuSe ship documentation or tools for creating your own update
server, for the case where you need to shadow their versions or to
provide packages of software they do not package?  How does their
update technology operate, I wonder...  and how does it compare to
"Apt", I wonder?  (the similar wondering about Red Hat's)

Debian "unstable" is very near the cutting edge.  With "apt-build",
you can build from source, configured with optimizations for your
particular CPU.  If a Debian package fails to autobuild, it's
considered a bug!

Email me (karlheg at hegbloom.net) and I'll burn you a CD.  Anyone else?

<sigh> if 2k natively had su, then I could do it without so much loging in

No, but until someone proves they are more capable, a simple answer is 
usually the lowest common denominator. I gave the folks who knew what they 
were doing more technical answers, but it's even MORE of a turn off if the 
users come back saying, "Huh? What's that mean?"

Obviously, you don't work with folks just starting out in the technical 
fields. I do. Insulting me won't work. I know what I can do, and you trying 
to figure it out through my techniques is laughable to say the least.

Everyone starts out a newbie. Trying to explain to a newbie how to do a 
technical thing, in the most technical terms will confuse them.

Now you are attributing things to me that I have not said, do not believe, 
and are false. Yes I use Redhat. Mostly because that's the distro I'm most 
familiar with, and changing just isn't that important to me. It does what I 
want, and works well.

Did I pay for it? Nope. I downloaded the isos, and burned 'em myself.

>You cannot PROVE that Red Hat is the most popular distro or that there

[much diatribe deleted]

Where did this come from? It's not even germane to the conversation. In 
fact, I said, in a previous message, "There's no advantage (IMNSHO) between 
Debian, Redhat, SuSE, Turbo, etc."

I did say that *I* prefer Redhat. That is purely MY preference, due to MY 
experience, and MY familiarity with what's out there. If I need to, I can 
use just about any distro out there. My choice of Redhat has nothing to do 
with anyones motives or anything like that.

Is your perception the only one that's right? Is it just possible that you 
misperceived my intent? You claim I "sound like" something, I apologize for 
sounding that way (granted, I only implied that it wasn't my intention) and 
you fire back with another barb.

Who spends money on RH cds? Only folks that don't know you can get them the 
same way you get debian cds. The only distro's that I know of that don't 
allow you to download the actual ISO they ship is SuSE and TurboLinux. 
There may be others, but those are the ones I've run into.

I'm using my own mirror of redhats updates, and a nifty perl script called 
autorpm. As of version 2.x of autorpm, it follows dependencies. I gather 
the files for the mirror with the perl script "mirror".

Subject: [PLUG] Moving Files
Message-ID: <3D642BB0.A6B7F009@attbi.com>

I understand that using mv to move a file from one directory to another
doesn't actually move the contents of the file, but just changes the
information about where that file is stored. (At least I think I
understand that.)

I have a system with two hard drives, an 8 GB drive that was in the
system when I installed RH 7.0, and a 40 GB drive that I added later,
with the intention of storing all the mp3 files I will create from my LP
collection.

Until I get around to recording all those LPs, I'm using the space for
temporary backups of other systems. I have another machine with a 12 GB
drive running Win98 which talks to the RH machine via Samba. I started
backing up a large number of files, intending that they go on the 40 GB
drive. To my dismay, I discovered that I put them on the 8 GB drive, and
pretty well filled it up.

If mv doesn't actually move files from one place to another, what tool
do I use to put the files I accidentally stored on the 8 GB drive onto
the 40 GB drive? Would I use cp to move them to the 40 GB drive and then
delete them from the 8 GB drive? Or is there a better way?

Thanks in advance.

Some of you deal with Windows workstations, so hey, is this on topic?

If nothing else, it gives good meat for the anti-microsoft chatter.
Microsoft rated this as a "CRITICAL" security risk for clients, and I think
that indicates some of the risk they associate with this particular problem.

Impact:     Three vulnerabilities, the most serious of which could

Max Risk:   Critical
Bulletin:   MS02-044

Microsoft encourages customers to review the Security Bulletin at: 
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-044.asp.
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Issue:
======
The Office Web Components (OWC) contain several ActiveX controls
that give users limited functionality of Microsoft Office in a web
browser without requiring that the user install the full
Microsoft Office application. This allows users to utilize
Microsoft Office applications in situations where installation
of the full application is infeasible or undesirable. 

The control contains three security vulnerabilities, each of
which could be exploited either via a web site or an HTML mail.
The vulnerabilities result because of implementation errors
in the following methods and functions the controls expose: 

 - Host(). This function, by design, provides the caller with
   access to applications' object models on the user's system.
   By using the Host() function, an attacker could, for instance,
   open an Office application on the user's system and invoke
   commands there that would execute operating system commands
   as the user. 

 - LoadText(). This method allows a web page to load text into a
   browser window. The method does check that the source of the
   text is in the same domain as the window, and in theory should
   restrict the page to only loading text that it hosts itself.
   However, it is possible to circumvent this restriction by
   specifying a text source located within the web page's domain,
   and then setting up a server-side redirect of that text to a
   file on the user's system. This would provide an attacker with
   a way to read any desired file on the user's system. 

 - Copy()/Paste(). These methods allow text to be copied and pasted.
   A security vulnerability results because the method does not
   respect the "disallow paste via script" security setting in IE.
   Thus, even if this setting had been selected, a web page could
   continue to access the copy buffer, and read any text that the
   user had copied or cut from within other applications. 

The patch does not set "kill bit" on the control, for reasons
discussed in the FAQ.

Mitigating Factors:
====================
Overall: 

 - In the case of the web-based attack, an attacker would need
   to force a user to visit the attacker's Web site. Users who
   exercise caution in visiting web sites could minimize their
   risk. 

 - In the web based attack, If ActiveX controls have been
   disabled in the zone in which the page were viewed, the
   vulnerability could not be exploited. Users who place
   untrusted sites in the Restricted Sites zone, which disables
   ActiveX by default, or have disabled ActiveX controls in the
   Internet zone could minimize their risk. 

 - In the case of HTML email based attacks, customers who read
   email in the Restricted Sites zone would be protected against
   attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Customers using
   Outlook 2002 and Outlook Express 6.0, as well as
   Outlook 2000 and Outlook 98 customers who have applied the
   Outlook Email Security Update would thus be protected by
   default. Also, Outlook Express 5.0 customers who have chosen
   to read mail in the Restricted Sites zone would be protected
   by default. 

 - In the HTML email based attack, Outlook 2002 customers who
   have enabled the "Read as Plain Text" option available in
   SP1 or later would also be protected.
 
Host() Vulnerability: 

 - The attacker's code would be limited by restrictions on the
   user's account. Users of non-privileged accounts would limit
   the potential damage from a successful attack. 

LoadText(): 

 - The attacker would need to know the full path and name of the
   file. In addition the file would have to be viewable in a
   web browser. 

Copy()/Paste(): 

 - The vulnerability could enable an attacker to access only to
   information in the Windows clipboard. The information in the
   clipboard is unpredictable and this vulnerability gives no
   means for an attacker to target and retrieve specific
   information. Further, it is possible for the clipboard to
   be empty, which would yield an attacker nothing. 

 - The security setting in question is not enabled by default.
   Thus, the vulnerability does not present a threat to the 
   default installation.

Risk Rating:
============
 - Internet systems: Moderate
 - Intranet systems: Moderate
 - Client systems: Critical

Patch Availability:
===================
 - A patch is available to fix this vulnerability. Please read the

When mv(1) is instructed to move a file (or directory) from one filesystem
to another, the data will be copied to the destination, and then deleted
from the original location.

Aha! I just reread my notes from when I installed the 40 GB drive and I
see that I ran mkfs.ext2 -c/dev/hdd1. So that created a separate file
system. Now I understand that mv is moving files between file systems.
It is so transparent in day to day use that, since I haven't done this
too often, it seemed like I was dealing with one file system. I think I
get the distinction, now.

Since I can hear the disk drive clicking away, and the command prompt
hasn't returned, I can assume that a large block of files is actually
moving.

Thanks, Don.

Open Explorer, navigate to C:\winnt\system32

Hold shift key, Right click an application, such as regedt32.exe  - and
choose "Run As".

I don't use it much, but the theory is it helps prevent logging in and out
for admin tasks (or in this case the other way around?).

Hi Dick,

I use "mc" (midnight commander) to move files/directory including its 
files.  It is simple and quick.

  I believe, Dick, that this holds within a filesystem. However, if you move
a file across a filesystem boundary (i.e., from one partition to another),
it is moved physically as well as logically (in the inode).

  I've run out of space on one workstation and moved files to a different
partition on another workstation (or just to a different partition on the
same workstation) and df shows the change in percentage used.

Karl - I've been trying to get ACPI going in Debian for a while now and
can't figure out; all the documentation I can find is several years out
of date. Where did you figure this stuff out and can you post a howto of
some sort?

Thanks,

That is indeed what occurred. 

Before mv:

Filesystem           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda1              8222624   7804608       328 100% /
/dev/hdd1             38464340   6960524  29549912  20% /home/mp3

After mv:

Filesystem           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda1              8222624   3817744   3987192  49% /
/dev/hdd1             38464340  10947392  25563044  30% /home/mp3

It's another one of those nuances that I'm slowly getting used to.

  Several years ago Eric put it all in perspective for me. Linux is made up
of little pieces, and each little piece is very easy to understand. The
problems arise because there are thousands of little pieces. :-)

  This advice has served me well. There are time, however, when several
little pieces need to be well understood all at once, and there are other
issues requiring my attention, too.

The conversation as you see it.  (hint: I was leading it in that
direction. ;) And there ARE FOR CERTAIN specific advantages to one
distribution or the other.  They each have their strong and weak
points.  There is more than one packaging format, more than one
package creation and build methodology, more than one software
configuration toolset, etc.

There are likely aspects of each that have merit over any other's way
of doing the similar, and aspects of each that are just wrong or lame.
Debian's runlevel configuration is poorly done, as of the present.
(It will be much improved by the dependancy based setup mandated by
the LSB.)

No.  Good point by the way. ;-) "perception" and "reality" are not one
and the same 6 times out of 7.  Unfortunately, not everyone seems to be
aware of that, as we all know.  (in any context; not this list's)

Just say ouch.  Sorry; I've probably been yelling at and pestering the

Heh. I think it speaks a couple dozen.  The GUI is pretty good.  It's 
just a fancier version of their text installer.  When I said easier, 
there were just less things to tweak to get it running the way I wanted 
it to.

I haven't tried to hibernate.  I may have to test it out, since it's 
certainly working better with the battery than SuSe did.

Thanks for the offer.  I'll probably just do the net install CD.

It probably will.  The only funky thing is it's that LinkSys 10/100 card.

Yea, I've been seeing that.  Gentoo has a similar setup.
I haven't looked into the updates nearly as much of the different
distributions.  I looked into Gentoo's more just because of the
extra interest and the extra effort needed.

Ok, I promise to give Debian another try.  Maybe I'll do some benchmarks 
between Gentoo and Debian.

IMHO, Mr. Project isn't even a few years close to being a MS Project
replacement.  I'm hoping for a vendor like Turbo Project to make a Unix
variant.  This website had available project management software sorted
by Operating System (Linux was under "other platforms" at the bottom). 
http://www.infogoal.com/pmc/pmcswr.htm  Within that listing, this one
looked like the best (only?) one for linux:
http://www.infogoal.com/pmc/pmcswr.htm and you can download a redhat
version for 30 days free.  I checked it out and thought it was usable,
but would squirm at paying the $450 price tag.

Message-ID: <3D647A59.600@pacifier.com>

Hopefully, some folks have more experience with all-in-one devices than I.
Apparently this particular printer/fax machine needs to be configured using 
Windows tools.  Namely, telling it to route incoming calls based on 
distinctive ring.

Printing over the net works fine, haven't tried scanning/faxing yet. 
Question is: How much functionality is part of the Linux driver vs. just 
letting a Windows client with the right software fully exploit the features 
of the device?

Example: the Linux driver (being developed by HP, yea them) doesn't yet 
support pc faxing.  But should one expect pc faxing to work if using a 
windows client on the net?  How would samba know where to spool an incoming fax?

Currently using lpd, but would CUPS offer more functionality in this regard?


Thanks,
Kyle Accardi

It never works correctly for me, for example, today I discovered that you
cannot use it on shortcuts.  So like you said, you have to navigate to the
file first.

I guess an approach that would be more like the su I'm familar with would
be to use something like terminal server and connect to local host as
Admin.

I just accidentally sent this from my data.lm.ro address... sorry if 
this gets duplicated!

Hey all-

I registered a dynamic dns address last night and linked it up with my
IP... a friend helped me get Postfix up, running, and secure.

So, in hopes I would be able to cancel my CS2K account, I started moving
my lists and stuff over to the new address (athlonrob at data.lm.ro) ...

They have *all* worked except for the PLUG list.  I had another dynamic
dns record linked to my IP which I tested with real quick.  It came
through until Postfix denied it (trying to send to the wrong domain).

However, the tries with data.lm.ro never even hit postfix.

Is PLUG filtering against this domain or something?  Everything else has
worked.  If it is being filtered, what are the reasons and can it be
un-filtered?

I'm kinda lost and would like a little bit of info  :-)

Yes, of course, that's the point.  It's a trap to get rid of the Linux

I think that "load_plate" is returning undef, and that:

... (or one like it?) is dropping the above error in your logs.

Is it subrequests that trigger it?  Did I get that right?  I wonder if
that "load_plate" function does something different then?  Where did
"load_plate" come from anyhow?

Sure, it does not move the file's data or change it's inode (look that
up), it only changes or moves that directory entry for that inode.

One way of answering this question for your self would be to RTFS
"mv", which is in the "fileutils" package.  (If you are running a
Debian GNU system you can use "apt-get source mv" to grab it really
quick.)  You might also check the man page to rename(2) (say "man 2
rename" to read it, provide you've got the devel man pages installed),
the system call that actually renames a file.

What you will discover is that "mv" will check and see if the two
files are on the same device or not.  If so, it will use "rename(2)",
and if not, it will copy the file then remove it from the old
location.  Most people use "cp" or "tar" for this sort of task though,
since it's a little safer.  You'll know it's copied for sure before
you remove the old copy of the file from the other disc.  Every now
and then cross device "mv" will lose a file for one reason or another.

Though "cp -a" will work fine, preserving hard links, ownership and
permissions, it is generally much faster to use "tar" to copy large
numbers of files from one spindle to another.  The general formula
is... ("#" means root prompt, "%" means user prompt)

# (cd /source && tar cpf - .) | (cd /dest && tar xpf -)

Please RTFM "tar" (say "info tar") to find out what those switches do.
The reason this is faster, especially when you are copying files from
one device to another, is that now there are two processes running, a
reader and a writer, each on a separate spindle.  With "cp -a",
there's only one process doing both the reading and the writing, so
there is less parallelism.

You can speed up the copy a little more, especially when the two
devices do not operate with the same sustained data throughput speed,
by using a program like "buffer" (apt-get install buffer) in the
pipeline, like:

# (cd /source && tar cpf - .) | buffer | (cd /dest && tar xpf -)

You can also copy files from one machine to another by piping the tar
(tape archive) through a secure shell pipe, like this:

% ssh -e none root at datahost 'cd /source && tar cpf - .' | (cd /dest && tar xpf -)

 Question!  Does anyone who has studied queueing theory (isn't that
            what I need to learn to know this answer?) know where the
            "buffer" belongs in that pipeline for optimal throughput?
            Please discuss.

To copy an entire host to a tarfile, I use this (and got PAID to
develop it):

"make-tarball"

#!/bin/bash
find / -print0 |
 grep --invert-match --extended-regexp --null-data --file=/root/make-tarball.exclude-patterns |

It doesn't have the jog dial, but my Sony Cybershot acts like a 
harddrive when I plug it in the USB cable. No problems with any of the

Hmm? I just recently looked at the LSB and it appeared to me that it
required SysV style run-levels. I've wanted a dependency based setup for
quite a while after hearing David Parsons and Richard Gooch propose them.
Pointers to where the LSB currently does or will require this in the
future appreciated.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled flame-war already in

I got squirrel mail working great... :-)

however... some emails... mainly threaded emails...like the ones here in
PLUG don't parse within the 30secs before it errors out.

Any thoughts on what might cause this?
is there a setting somewhere that might prevent it from erroring out?

What might make a text email take so long to parse...if at all...

 HPOJ 0.90 is out!  Sat Aug 10 11:41:50 2002

On August 7th, exactly one year after the last release, David Paschal from HP 
has released a new version of his low-level driver package for HP's 
multi-function devices (HP OfficeJet, PSC, PhotoSmart, LaserJet with scanner, 
Sony IJP-V100).

The new HPOJ 0.90 is vastly improved against the old one. The most important 
new features are:

    * All models with scanner scan via the SANE infrastructure now.
    * Access to the drives for photo memory cards is supported in all 
appropriately equipped models (most PhotoSmarts, PSC 950, OfficeJet D145/155).
    * Configuration program now also auto-detects devices connected on the 
parallel port. It sets up all device types: parallel, USB, JetDSirect.
    * Tons of bug fixes.

Everyone who had problems with HPOJ 0.8 is encouraged to update. Most problems 
will disappear this way.

Happy printing, scanning, and photo card reading!

If you find the answer, but it comes to you off-list, could you post 
it to PLUG? We just implemented SquirrelMail at work, and it'd be nice 
to head off that error before it rears its ugly head around here :-)

David and Richard (and others, now) have differing ideas of how to do
things (shocking, I know). Richard's description is here:

  http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rgooch/linux/boot-scripts/

Alas, I can no longer find where David Parsons described his ideas, I
don't *think* they got implemented in David's Mastodon Linux, but I
haven't looked closely enough to know for sure:

  http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Mastodon/

Apparently, one of the conectiva guys is working on something similar,
also, based on his advogato entries:

  http://www.advogato.org/person/epx/

He claims to have submitted something to the LSB about it, so maybe
that's what Karl was referring to. Alas, google doesn't find a project
page for their initscriptsNG software.

All the words are english, I can understand it, but I'm not going to be able
to draw any conclusions from it when it's taken out of context and I don't
have access to the other paragraphs.

In my experience Unix/Linux man pages require reading possibly several pages
before the answer becomes apparent, because you have to understand all the
different functions and pieces individually before you can understand how
they work in a whole.

If you want documentation that says, "I have this this this and this, and I
want it to do that" then email "plug at lists.pdxlinux.org".  or am I way off
base here?

That makes a lot of sense. I feel the same way, too. Learning this
little piece about moving files has been fairly straightforward. I'm
still working on printing, though. (It has to wait for me to get some

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.44.0208221026170.26297-100000@eel.ENGR.ORST.EDU>

I've been considering getting DSL since cable is not an option at my
apartment.  I have to use qwest (ick!) and I think I will use peak (a
local ISP that uses RH) for my isp.

I called qwest and the only dsl modem they can offer me (since I qualify
only for their lowest end service) is the actiontec 1520, which is a usb
modem.  My router is a 486 running linux, and so it doesn't have usb.  I
know the cisco 678 to be compatible with qwest.  Does anyone have a dsl
modem like the cisco 678 that they would be willing to part with?  I could
possibly do a trade with a cable modem, or just buy it from you.

Thanks,
Jason

If you've not gotten anywhere with the world's experts in mod_perl on
the mod_perl mailing list, I'm not sure what you expect to gain by
posting here.

It's a bit like going to a car repair shop and saying to the mechanic
on duty: "you know, my doctor couldn't help me with this pain in my
back, but maybe *you've* got some advice".

OK, maybe I'm just being cynical.  But that's how it lands for me.

I'd say stay with the mod_perl list.  Either you don't have the
problem refined enough for *anyone* to help you, or *that* list will
be the solution, eventually.  Plus, if you solve it *there* you'll
help a much more apropos audience for future reference.

Yes, I saw this, but haven't tried it yet--they don't mention faxing.

I have been unable to find any info on fax support with samba.  I know 
there's hylafax, but that uses the modem, correct?  Not sure what to call 
what I'm looking for.  Some kind of fax daemon that works through samba?

If anyone has some better google words, I'd love to hear it.

I agree, but there are a few caveats:

1) I've been posting to user/developer forums for almost a decade, and
this is the first time I've received absolute silence about a problem.
Even when I was a newbie learning perl back in '93, Larry Wall,
yourself and Tom Christensen would at least say "Go read this man
page."

2) I know there are mod_perl users here on PLUG.  I'm hoping that my
problem will trigger something like "Hey, I ran your code and had no
problems.  I use mod_perl xxx, Apache xxx, perl xxx" and so on.

I understand, and in general would agree with what you're saying.
However, have _you_ actually read my post?  The problem I'm having
doesn't exactly lend itself to minimization.  It's completely random
and load independent.

There's a "Consulting for Dummies" book. It covers a lot of the basics. Pricing 
is more about confidence and polish in my opinion than much else. One of my 
favorite answers is "I don't know, but I can find out/ know somebody who does" 
People are happy with the answer and I don't have to be a know-it-all in all of 
the areas I get asked about. (the best phone systems, how much data does their 
external payroll system  backup on their local PC...)

That's also assuming that QWest used the same DSLAM in your CO that they 
use in the CO's that work with the Cisco modems. There are at least a 
couple of types of DSL out there, and unfortunately, the equipment doesn't 
cross over.

Just playing devils advocate. I haven't researched this at all, and the two 
modems may do the same job. I just figure that if the Cisco would work, 
Qwest would be willing to sell you one, if they're still distributing them.

Ok, ok...

Sometimes, I've found that you have to wipe the partition table. fdisk can

Robby,

  I've run a consulting company for the past nine years. Environmental, not
computer, but the principles are the same.

  First, go to the library (or Powell's) and check out the books on computer
consulting and consulting in general. Second, set up a business name and
register it with the Secretary of State. You don't need to incorporate or
get fancy now, but a registered business name helps prospective clients gain
confidence in you. Depending on where you live, a local business license is
a worth-while investment. Third, pricing is dependent on the value you
deliver to clients and what others -- with similar levels of knowledge and
experience -- are charging for similar services. Don't forget, the state is
in economic straits and money is tight for almost every business. Finally,
start small and work up as you gain a reputation among clients.

  The biggest difference between consulting and any other marketing/sales
position is that we're selling the invisible. Track record and reputation
are everything.

HTH,

Rich

Thanks I'll ask them that.  Do you know anyway I can talk to someone
knowledgeable when I call them?  I always end up talking to people that
"just work there" if you know what I mean.  No disrespect to them, but
they never know enough to answer the tough questions.

I couldn't descern that today.  At first he said the 678 wasn't
compatible, but then I asked him if I bought one if it would work with the
service and he said, people use their own all the time.  And I said even
the 678 with the service you are offering me...and he said I think so...

Maybe I should just give up and use windows and only connect one computer
to the internet...while I'm at it I would sign up for MSN...oh wait,
that's a BAD idea....

Not sure with qwest. What you might try is when they can't answer a 
question with a definite answer, ask them to find out or connect you with 
someone who does know.

Ditto to registering a name, but don't underestimate the importance (or
ease) of incorporation.  It's not a crucial first step, but don't let
yourself get more than a year or two into being a consultant without
doing it.  Sole proprietorship is a losing proposition, long term. (IMO,
YMMV, etc.) 

Also, get an accountant as soon as you make any money at all.  You'll
need one.

> we're selling the invisible

Oddly enough, the very title of a book I was going to recommend.  If you
get just *one* book on marketing a service business, it should be Harry
Beckwith's _Selling The Invisible_.

FWIW,

I just left Qwest for Covad (which is much cheaper and working great

series).  Anyway, this means I have a 8 mo.old Cisco 678 I'm willing to
part with.  I'll sell you it for $20 which is way lower than what I've
seen it used in stores for ($100) and way, way lower than what Cisco
will sell it to you for.  If it doesn't work, I'll buy it back.

Well, I used to do OfficeJet support for HP.
So, basically what you want to do isn't possible. You cannot fax over
the network without the HP windows software. But, as far a settings go,
if you connect it to a windows box, set the distinctive ring or rings to
answer, and disconnect it from the computer, it will hold the settings. 
You can also access the parameters menu using *# (press together, then
release), then push 1,2,3. I don't remember which parameters to change,
but I could probably get a list. You won't have to mess with that if you
install the software on a windows box temporarily anyways.

In order to PC fax, you just have to hope the linux driver will some day
support that. However, by that time, the false paper jams will probably
have frustrated you so much that the machine will be in pieces :)

Oh, on a side note, PC faxing with the windows version cannot be done
over a network anyways. At least, not with the OJ600.

The 678 should work. Just verify that the DSL circuit you will be
getting is DMT, and it will work. The 678 is cool. NAT and port
forwarding capabilities, just like any router. There's different ways to
configure it, depending on whether or not you have a static IP.

I just now read your post (it had expired from my mail box), and I
think I know why I didn't remember it.

You've got a difficult problem.  You are pulling in a lot of other
modules, and you have some interesting issues.  But it's not something
that stands out for me as "Oh duh, just do this".  And I bet that's
what most people said on the mod_perl list as well.  So we all glaze
over, and move along.

But I'll stand by my first statement.  If there *is* an expert who can
help you, it's there, not here.

And this may be a problem that requires the waving of cash to help.  I
know that it'd take me at least a half hour just to stare at all the
relevent code, to ensure there's no "oh duh" factor there.  And that's
generally a lot more than you can expect from a volunteer mailing
list.

I *understand* that it's important to you.  But the fact that you
didn't get an answer on the mod_perl list is the most relevant clue
here: your problem is HARD and will require an EXPERT that's not yet
willing to do it for FREE.

Good luck.  But use the right forum.

  Being incorporated 1) implies stability and longevity and 2) gives the
impression of a larger company. A sub-chapter 'S' corporation is ideal for a
single individual.

  And find one who knows self-employed, service businesses. I'll recommend
my accountant in Gresham if asked: she's worked for me for eight years and
is worth every penny of her very reasonable rates.

  Yup. After reading too many product-oriented marketing books, this _is_
the one to buy, read, and re-read at least once a year.

Yeah, this is something I still need to do.  Any idea what to expect in

Paul,
If you setup virtual domains in apache and say have the default domain be
something other than your primary all of this logging will go to that domain
log when they hit your IP.  This is how I have mine setup right now.  I
don't know of other solutions except firewall filtering.

Let me know if you want specific examples of the httpd.conf.

I'm doing this for a friend and am not familiar with the machine.  He had 
set the distinctive ring once with windows software, but it has since 
"forgot", he didn't think you could do it through the panel--good to know 
that's possible.

So you can't fool windows into thinking it's a local device?

Any recommendations on all-in-one makers/models that work in a mixed linux 
and win environment?

This is probably a linux box, so

grep -v '.exe$' access_log > niceclean_log

would probably work in general, no? :)  Takes care of all
current and future problems with Windows executable files.

Dunno, but increase the max_execution_time variable in your system's
php.ini file.  Works for me (running squirrel for several thousand users
at work, on, er, less than bleeding-edge hardware, I am intimately
familiar with this annoynance =/ ).

If I may snag this subject line for a truly OT question . . .

The Voters Pamphlet for the 17 September Special Election arrived at
our house today, & thumbing thru it I noticed that one candidate for
City Commissioner stated the following udner Occupational Background:
``Unpaid Consultant to Businesses, Bartender, Waiter, Security."

Hmm. ``Unpaid Consultant to Businesses" -- would someone like to
explain how this is anything other than another way of saying he
``complains alot in the stores & restaurants he's in"?

Well, you can install a "generic" driver, like the DJ550c and tell it to
print to the network path of the OJ600, but not faxing. The reason
printing works is because print sharing is enabled on the "server"
computer. Hmmm.....
I'm curious now. If you install a fax driver for the OJ600, then change
the print path to the server i.e. \\server\OJ600  ...and share the fax
driver on the server....it might work. But that doesn't help with the
linux issue.

Your best bet is to get a jet-direct print server, and a model that
works with it. You can then scan from any computer on the network using
a web browser. You are still left with no easy way to fax though (from a
linux box). The jetdirect just plugs into the network, and then the
printer. I don't know if you have linux workstations, or if you just
wanted to run this through samba... But, if its all windows
workstations, a jet direct will allow you to print, scan, and PC fax
(send only) from all (windows) computers. From linux boxes, you can
print, scan ...I doubt faxing is possible unless you are really l33t.
You would have to make/modify a fax driver for linux I believe.
The best model is the G85. The scanner rocks. There is the new D series,
but I don't know much about them. 
I'd recommend the jet direct 170x if you only need one parallel port.
They are $150-$170. The G85 can be purchased used for $250.
Disclaimer: I don't work for HP anymore. :)

Hope that helps.

Message-ID: <1030059785.14021.7225.camel@dereklinux>

Hi All,

I'm having some strange behavior when trying to play audio CD's.  The
behavior seems to be dependent on the software (all pre-compiled
debian-sid packages), but it is acting like a hardware problem (PIII
550, 256 Megs, SoundBlaster AWE 64, and a Delta 48x CDROM). On the other
hand, it almost seems like a permissions problem, but not quite.  I'm
just looking for ideas on how to go about troubleshooting this.

As a normal user that is in the disk, audio and video groups

If I use Workman (usually a pretty stable player) it will play the first
5 to 30 seconds of a selected track, then stop and won't start again,
though it still thinks there is an audio CD in the drive.  If I eject
the CD using the software button, then stuff the CD back in, I can play
the first 5 to 30 seconds of a selected track.

If I use FreeAmp, it won't even eject the CD, and it doesn't recognize
that there is a CD in the drive.

If I use XfreeCD, it won't even eject the CD, and it doesn't recognize
that there is a CD in the drive.


As root,

If I use Workman it will play the first 5 to 30 seconds of a selected
track, then stop and won't start again, though it still thinks there is
an audio CD in the drive.  If I eject the CD using the software button,
then stuff the CD back in, I can play the first 5 to 30 seconds of a
selected track.

If I use FreeAmp, (first, I have to eject the CD a couple of times with
the software; until it stops pulling itself back in -- however, this is
behavior for FreeAmp that I've seen on other systems) it will play most
of the tracks most of the way through, some will actually play all the
way through.  There doesn't seem to be a specific cutoff time, but some
of the tracks will just stop playing and the player will move on to the
next track.

XFreeCD plays nicely until about track 9, then it just stopped, claimed
no disk is present, then after sitting for a little, started playing
track 9 again.  It played the entire track 9 and went on to the next and
played to the end, then claimed that no CD was in the drive.

Any ideas?

There may be a pop3 server already installed. Run ntsysv and if it's 
installed, you'll be able to see it in the list. If it is, you can 
enable it by putting an 'X' in the box, save your changes and exit. Then 
to start it, run '/etc/init.d/xinetd restart'.

Your description sounds like maybe some other program is accessing
the drive at the same time you are trying to play the CD.  Is it possible
that there is some automatic program configured to run when you insert a
CD (detect disk type, mount the disk, play the music, etc.)?

Good question.  As far as I know, there is no such critter.  I don't use
Gnome or KDE (blackbox is so much faster) and I haven't installed
anything that would do that.  The relevant line from fstab reads:

/dev/cdrom      /cdrom          iso9660 defaults,ro,user,noauto        
0       0

The noauto part should disable any attempts at auto mounting, if I read
the manual correctly.  Is there somewhere else such a beast may be
lurking?

I just read about new Linux HP drivers being written that supported a
ton of those integrated things.  I don't remember where I read it,
though.  :-\

It was something like "A year after the last release, XXXXX from HP has
released a new set of HPOJ drivers" ... might be worth a google.

Good luck.

You were missing something  :-)

I couldn't subscribe, it wouldn't connect to my server at all.

Somebody else mentioned exim bounced 'cause my MX records were messed
up.  While it was sorta my fault (I entered my IP in as a MX record,
didn't need to) Exim is really being kinda picky about it.  Nobody else
had a problem.

Anyway, I'm here now, under the proper email address.  :-)

Since the '.exe' wouldn't end the line, no. This would probably work:

  grep -v -E '\.exe\>' access_log

where the \> token functions like \b in Perl.

Thanks for the help on these issues; I decided to retire the cd drive and
buy a new fan.

Another hardware question for sysadmins; is it okay to stack harddrives
right next to each other? Since I only have two bays there's not much
choice, but there's virtually no space between my two hard drives and it
gets awfully hot there. What happens if hard drives get too hot? Is it
possible in a desktop environment?

I apologize.  I have really dropped the ball on this.  I was suppose to
hear back from my contact at PCC but nothing came of it, and then I got
too busy with other things to work on it.

I still would like to do it, but still need to find the space.

I am not sure that putting up a web page would help much, but if you
want to start something that would be cool.  My hope was that it would
grow organically.  No plan, but just people taking the initiative.

However, if someone wants to make things more formal, I would support
that.

That all being said, I still want to see if we can do this thing.  I
will continue to press my friend at PCC and continue to find a space
somewhere else.

It is possible for them to get too hot.  (Especially if they are a type 
that run hot normally, like the old Seagate Baracudas.)

I had one drive start to hallucinate because of overheating.  It caused 
some "interesting" problems.  (I got a file with a null (0x00) in it. Ted 
Tso was quite amazed over that one...  Took a bit to fix.)

There are fans that you can get that will help cool the drives.  You can 
also get heat sinks and other things to help cool them down.  Many 
computer stores have them. Pacific Solutions on SE Powell is where I get 
them.  Other places may be closer to you.

I wouldn't stack two right next to each other if I could avoid it at all. You 
might try a 5.25" to 3.5" adapter to mount a drive in a CD-Rom drive space. I do 
that a lot. Most PC stores have these gizmos if you ask.

The pop3 service only have private subnet address.  Can I make it available
for public use, in order for other users to access their mail using MS
Outlook when they're out of the country.

Hope you can help me

There may be a pop3 server already installed. Run ntsysv and if it's
installed, you'll be able to see it in the list. If it is, you can
enable it by putting an 'X' in the box, save your changes and exit. Then
to start it, run '/etc/init.d/xinetd restart'.

Hello Linux fans,

The co-op sounds like a very cool idea. 

You should consider using the (free) Xenternet community service to
organize it. I made Xenternet precisely for this sort of thing.

At www.xenternet.com, you can create an online community that has its
own threaded discussion board, events calendar, and news
articles. There is a 3 level moderation system. Group access can be
made public or private. Pictures with captions can be attached to all
content.

For example, check out the Portland Tech events calendar:

http://www.xenternet.com/calendar_show.php?groupid=44

Also check out the screen shots at:

http://www.ajlavin.com/products.php

If you require additional functionality I might be interested to
implement it.

Xenternet was made using PHP, PostgreSQL, XML, and XSLT, and runs
under Apache on Linux 2.4.

Tyler,

  That's the way many cases are designed. If the case has places for extra
fans (in addition to the power supply and CPU), put them in there.

Tyler,

As mentioned in another message think about mounting them, or at least one
of them, in the 5 1/4" bays.  Also well worth the money are bay coolers
(CyberGuys.Com).  These are for 5 1/4" bays and have two or three fans and
a dust filter on the front.  Be sure to sufficient exhaust fans also.  
Getting more air in than is going out is just pressurized heat.  :-)

Oh yeah!  I you're running a pretty hot system system, 1+ GHz, fast video
card, etc. you should also look at putting in round drive cables verses
the flat cables normally using in desktop systems.  (Again CyberGuys.Com  
:-)  They will let the air flow much better and help prevent hot spots in 
the case where the flat cables could force air to circulate in a small 
area.

I did some snooping...and testing all the plugins in squirrelmail.
apparently it was the address_add plugin.

Someone else on the squirrelmail list had that problem...no known fixes
yet. I just disabled the plugin... works fine now...
it would get stuck on url parsing...

I found that I could use abook_take plugin instead of the address_add
plugin. It scans through every email address in the email and lets you add
any one of them to your address book.
....and it doesn't give me a parsing timeout error. :-)

Hope that helps for anyone who may be using squirrelmail...or are
considering it. I really like this application.

If you have a firewall to a broadband connection, just redirect port 110
from the public IP to the private IP.  This should allow access from outside
the private network.  There may be some security issues to deal with but it
works.

You might also take a look at a new case - in particular one of those 
Luan Lui (or whatever they're named) all-aluminum cases.  I believe they 
have two 60mm fans in the front of the case, and the HD's are mounted 
directly behind them, with a 1-2mm space between the drives for airflow. 
  I don't have one myself, but a friend of mine showed me his, and it 
looked pretty slick.

Another option would be to take the extreme box builder route from last 
year and route the cables so that they run flat against the MB side of 
the case.  If you don't want to spend the $$ on the round cables, 
anyway.  ;)

I've got one fan in the front of my case bringing in cool air, and the 
PS + an 80mm at the back sucking out the hot.  Unfortunately the box is 
in a corner, so it gets pretty warm - took me a while to get it so that 
it wouldn't lock up due to overheating on moderately warm days.

Lian Li cases are pretty nice :) it's a bit eerie having a metal case that
is warm to the touch, but they are very well made and look spectacular.

On a related note, has anyone been able to get the onboard heat sensors to
work on a tyan tiger MPX mobo? I'm dying to see what temp. my cpu's are
pushing, but lmsensors dosen't appear to support this chipset. (or I've
overlooked something).

Thanks :)

apt-get remove plug?

or

M-x unsubscribe.

It would help if you could include the error message and kernel version
next time.

If you have RH you might try this instead of the apt-get:

rpm -ef subscription.rpm.

D'oh!  I wish you'd have reminded me about this when I was looking for 
calendars the other day...

http://pasa.portland.or.us/webcal/webcal.cgi?function=webmonth&cal=pasaevents&year=2002&month=08

I'll try to add the events I have here when I get a chance.

Okay, here goes:
 o Recurring events
 o Able to schedule not only first/second/third day, but also first & last 
(webcal doesn't have 'last', which makes scheduling PTP and PACUG 
difficult).
 o Click on date to add event, instead of selecting 'New Event' and trying 
to remember the date.
 o Export in RDF, so Evolution, websites, etc can get a feed from the 
calendar.

You might also take a look at the cases from Enermax or Antec.  They have 
some cases that I'm told are just rebranded by them but with their very 
good power supplies.  They come stock with several fans, with slots for 
several more and they're thermal-controlled, so they slow down when the 
temp is low enough.  I just built a mail server for a customer with an 
Antec PLUS880 (http://www.antec-inc.com/en_plus860.html) and it's very 
nice.  The drive bays have a latch and click out and have a space for a fan 
mount.  I added a fan and the 2 10,000 RPM Ultra160 Seagate Cheetahs stay 
very cool.

PC Club on 82nd (I believe there is one in the west somewhere too) carries 
the Enermax cases which are very high-quality like the Antec and some of 
the aluminum ones.

BTW, PC Heidens has gone out of business.

Subject: [PLUG] Network snag
Message-ID: <3d667110.7be6.0@pcez.com>

I apparantly forgot how to get a Linux box to connect to the Internet, am seeking
counsel to get my box back online.

I reinstalled Red Hat 7.2, and now can't reach the Internet (not a HUGE shock!).


I can successfully ping 127.0.0.0.1 but attempts to ping my default gw or even
"localhost" generates a "Network is unreachable" message.

I am pretty sure I have /etc/hosts and resolv.conf set correctly.

This file currently looks like  /etc/sysconfig/network:

NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME=(my hostname...)
GATEWAY=(my ISP's default gw here...)


And /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts

ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=static
IPADDR=(my IP address here...)
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=(my ISP's default gw here...)
BROADCAST=(not 100% certain what this should look like)
NETWORK=(should this be my default gw with a .255 at the end?)
USERCTL=no

What am I overlooking?

This is fine,  as long as the machine is directly connected to your ISP ( no
firewall box in the middle )

This should be your IPADDR with .255 at the last octect

In pine it appears (although I have yet to test it) that you can scroll
down to the bottom of the message body, and hit enter when it highlights:
[ Note: This message contains email list management information ]

Then you gives you unsubscribe as an option.

Oops,  I mean a 0 as the last octect,  and broadcast will have .255
typically

Like this:
NETWORK=192.168.0.0
BROADCAST=192.168.0.255

No, the network is the very start of the address block, not the end. 
With a netmask of 255.255.255.0 the last part of your network should be
a .0 (But, where should I put the period to end the sentence?).  

The Broadcast is the very end of the address block, in this case, it
will be your ip address with .255 on the end.  (Your gateway address
must have the first three parts the same as your ip address.)

Well, is your network card working?  Is its module loaded?  Do an
/sbin/lsmod and look for something that looks like your network card.

As others have said, heat kills.

I've had really good luck with parts from http://electroseller.com. They 
ship free on a lot of their stuff, and sell the cables, and aluminum cases.

(If I sound a might wound up about this, it might be because my

Be very careful when you install GCC 3.2.  If you have any kernel
drivers that are provided by a third party, such as nVIDIA drivers, they
must be compiled by GCC 3.2 if the kernel is compiled by GCC 3.2.

This means that if you move to the Redhat 7.3.94 (Null) beta, your
nVIDIA drivers from nVIDIA will no longer load.  They do not have a GCC
3.2 driver set out yet.  I found out about this the hard way.

GCC 3.2 is going to be a rough upgrade for all concerned.

Okay, so I apt-get'ed the freenet6 client, got it working, went to the 
freenet6.net page, and got a login and everything is all peachy keen.

Now...why use a ipv6 tunnel?  I looked around the site, but there wasn't 
really any *why* listed for the project.

Granted, ipv6 will be a good thing, but only when *everyone* starts 
using it.  Is the freenet6 project trying to increase awareness and get 
people used to using ipv6 address space so that the transition (when it 
happens) will be seamless, or...?

That said, I either compile in or make a module for ipv6 in every 
install.  Now if only my switches and ISP used 'em.  ;)

I think you got it.  I'm not expert, but what you said is my
understanding, when I took a networking class they said slow painful
transition was planned for ipv6.  So right about the time we switch to
metric, ipv6 should really be taking off :)

So you have ipv4 and ipv6 coexisting in all your kernels?  Cool, now I
need to get off my bum and do that.

Yeah, this one has lasted me about siix years now and only cost me $2
(on sale).

I think, however, that it is time for a new keyboard.  The i key repeats
itself.  The o key sometimes stopps working until I slam down on it
(just the o key) with such force that my finger hurts.  And it is very
clicky.  VERY clicky.  They hear me on the second floor when I type.

So, I'm going to Fry's today oor tomorrow to buy myself a new keyboard! 
Oh, look at that, the o key is repeating just like the i key does.  Are
there any suggestions for a decent keyboard that'll last me a while? 
Sure, keyboards are things most people spend $10 on and never worry
about, but I want a decent keyboard that'll last me another six years.

:::looks in wallet:::

$27 there, and somebody owes me $10 cash, so the budget for this
adventure is $37.  I require the oversized (2.5 keys length?) backspace
key and under the enter key need it set up like:

/ SHIFT (1.5 keys length?) \

Not any of those with the \ key hidden somewhere.  I also need my
Windows key between CTRL and ALT on the left side.  I don't care about
much else... I woudl think the winkey placement is standard now,
though.  I want a *real* keyboard, too, not one of those Microsoftian
'contour' ones.  Flat and straight, please.  :-)

Do y'all have Keyboard buying tips/suggestions/good brands?  I would
definitely appreciate some input!

Ok... question....

Do the nVidia drivers not compile or something?  They are literally the
easiest compile out there.  Even if there were modules available
(precompiled) for my distro, I certainly wouldn't use them as they take
about three seconds to compile and install.

Was your only problem that the precompiled drivers won't work or that
you couldn't get the tarballs to compile?

That's interesting that GCC 3.2 does that to the kernel.  I wonder why
it is.  Off the top of my head, I can't think of a single reason why
that might be.... oh well.

You're not actually compiling the driver.  The driver itself is shipped
precompiled and the "compiling" you're doing is only of the external
interface; the code that depends on kernel symbols.

Avoid any keyboards with quiet touch in the name.  Dell makes some like
that and they last about 6 months not years.

Logitech makes keyboards that I really like.  Nice feel and I assume that
with logitech they would last a long time, I know their mice do.  I don't
know how well X supports all the extra buttons, so you could save some
money by getting one of the more "basic" logitech models.

IBM keyboards are loud but they probably last the longest.  I bet that's
what you had :)

Generally, I have been pleased with generic low end cheap-o keyboards.
The one I've had for the last 3 years cost me $4 and it is pretty much a
generic keyboard.  Dell, compaq, packard bell, and microsoft keyboards are
crap almost always.  The other nice thing about cheap keyboards is that
they often allow you to remove the keycaps more easily than the expensive
ones.  This is a useful trait if you plan to learn to type in dvorak (I
HIGHLY recommend doing so if you type for 1 hour/day or more, check here
http://www.engr.orst.edu/~dagit for instructions).  Also, radio shack
currently has an "interesting" keyboard for sell.  It is indestructable
according to them.  You should try it out, definitely try before you buy.
It is one piece of clear rubber, and strange to type on, but should last a
long time.

It's refreshing to see someone else that cares as much about the keyboard
they use as I do...

The only keyboard that has kept me consistantly happy is the Avant Prime 
(http://www.cvtinc.com/kybdfeatures.htm). It weighs in at over five pounds 
and has the best mechanical tactile feel of any keyboard I've ever used. Best 
$150 I ever spent (yes, my keyboard cost more than my monitor...).

  About three weeks ago I replace my old Gateway omni-key board (the one
with the function keys on the left -- where they belong -- rather than on
the top) because it, too, had a malfunctioning key. I considered getting a
Happy Hacker keyboard, but decided the price was too high. So, I went to
Office Depot.

  For $11 (maybe it was $12) I have a Belkin keyboard that has the specs you
listed. It works just fine, but I doubt that it, or any other keyboard for
that matter, will last six years. I remapped the caps lock and control keys
so they'd be where they belong, and the control key is already a teeny bit
sticky.

  I realized that I don't use function keys too often in linux, but I sure
use the ctrl key a lot so having the former out of the way on the top is not
too bad (I'll eventually get used to it). My solution was to buy cheap and
plan on replacing more frequently.

I hate to say it, but my MS Natural keyboard is going on 8 years now. I 
bought it in 1994 when they first came out because my hands were hurting 
after typing. My hands no longer hurt during or after typing, and the 
keyboard is still functioning perfectly. Some of the keycaps have lost 
parts of the letters due to wear, but they still work right.

Most keyboards can be disassembled and cleaned.  Also check Wacky Willy's 
for good used keyboards.  I think $10? which seems a bit much for used, but 
many are heavy duty like they don't seem to make anymore.

I have a keyboard problem.  Only need one but have about a dozen.  Of course 
sometimes you just can't resist: like the Earthstation-I 
(serial/parallel/vga/arcnet).  Had one as a kid that had mechnically-linked 
shift keys so they both moved like a typewriter and very deeply sculpted 
keys, miss that one.

Just curious if you guys have had specific experiences where you
lost work (or whatever) because of not being incorporated. I almost
incorporated (as opposed to sole proprietorship) a couple of years
ago. My accountant advised against it at that time just because it
made it a little bit harder to move money back and forth between
me and the business (and he didn't see any advantage.)

I planned to incorporate the first time I actually *lost* a contract
because of being a sole proprietorship. Even though a number of people
have told me they wouldn't hire me if I wasn't incorporated, every
time (so far :-) this has turned out to be *wrong* and the contract
went through.  The issue generally turned out to be EAO and Liability
insurance, which I have (1M), and of course a separate Federal Tax
ID for the business.

Since business is pretty bad right now, I'm kind of curious whether
or not there is something to this, and just looking for more info.

I've read about mapping those 'extra' keys to different functions, but
it's not something I'm terribly interested in.  I can do all that kind
of stuff already with bbkeys.

I don't want something as loud as I have now!  I don't type terribly
fast (80WPM on a good day) but when I really get going it is almost
deafening... lol

I have a PC Concepts keyboard right now.  It was the cheapest thing I
could find back when I was strapped for cash and needed a new keyboard.

Actually, I'm using a PB keyboard on my server right now.  It has served
me well for quite some time.  One in a million kinds of things.

Naw, I type with QWERTY and QWERTY alone.  I type on *way* too many
computers to learn a different typing style.  I do PC repair type stuff
in my free time.

Besides, I've been typinig on QWERTY since I was a wee little one.  :-)

Hmmm... gonna keep with a traditional plastic keyboard, at least until

Well, if you do a lot of typing, as I do, then you need a good
keyboard.  If it weren't for my i and o keys, this one would probably
last me another six years.  :-)

I appreciate the input.  I think, unless somebody else has ideas, I'll
probably go with a Logitech... however much Logitech $37 can get me.

I get some catch phrases fading in and out in the black bar, a little
bit off-center.  Ok, way off-center.  It's definitely a java applet.

I'll bet the java is what is hanging NS 4.78 (did you know NS 4.8 was
released?)...

I'm in Galeon, compiled around Moz 1.0.

If anyone actually gets this working, I for one would appreciate
it if they would post a "howto" including the exact sequence things
they did. I realize that's probably a tall order, since by the
time it works - one doesn't usually remember everything one did.
But, I can ask :-)

It's ok to admit it. I happen to think that Microsoft makes some pretty

Redhat Linux 7.1+ and galeon 1.0 something.  Kind of hangs because I don't 
have java configured correctly and turned on.  Keeps wanting to go a java 
installation page.

Mike,

  This cannot be measured. If you don't get a project it's almost impossible
to learn the real reason why.

  Regarding moving money around: that's no problem at all. Set up an account
for your S-corporation distributions and you can write yourself checks
whenever you like. It's very clean -- as far as the IRS and state are
concerned. Functionally, the money's yours, but by keeping it in two
different pockets you can legitimately charge business expenses without
anyone thinking they're personal. Unless, of course, you're from Enron,
Adelphia, WorldCom, ....

  It cost less than $100 to incorporate and get official registration. You
lose the home office deduction on your personal taxes but you gain business
expense and other deductions on that side.

  When you go looking for a professional, can you list all the criteria --
honestly -- that you apply? There's a lot of subjective, emotional aspects
to our decisions and a little thing like an "Inc.", "LLC", "PC" after your
business name may make that difference.

  If you can quantify the number of people who did not call you because you
were not incorporated you'd have a solid basis for making a decision. :-)

> or not there is something to this, and just looking for more info.

  Every edge helps. Ask yourself this question: Why should someone hire me,
rather than a competitor?

  Won't load and display using mozilla-0.9.x, but will with opera-5.0.4.
Shrug. I'm finding a bunch of sites that won't load with mozilla but will
with opera. Of course, I keep cookies and java off on mozilla, but cookies
are on in opera.

s:/QWERTY/Microsoft

This argument sounds familar... :)

The issue can be condensed to what is called "exploration vs.
exploitation" in AI research; does an intelligent agent devote time to
learning and performing optimally, or just try to do well with what he
already knows?

You see this conflict reflected in many ways; some people explore too
much, devoting excess time to learning instead of getting the job done,
whereas others exploit too much and try to do stuff without adequate
preparation. I guess a balance is best.

Most gnu/linux users, I think, are "exploratory", and devote a lot of time
to learning; conversely in my college CS classes the majority of students
suffer from being too "exploitative".

So anyway, if you argue against Dvorak for being non-standard and
difficult to learn, don't complain about Windows users making the same
argument... the underlying action is choosing exploitation (getting
the job done, poorly) over exploration (learning how to do it better).

PS: Like Linux/Windows, it is possible to learn both Qwerty and Dvorak! :)

Some reasons to incorporate (based on my experience):

  1 - If you ever get work through an agency/job shop, some of them will
      only take you on as either an employee of the agency (W-2), or on a
      corp-to-corp basis (some require various types of insurance as
      well, but some don't).  I have personally encountered a number of
      agency based jobs where a sole proprietorship was out of the
      question, and I have had a couple of customers who might not have
      hired me if I hadn't been incorporated (I can't say for sure, they
      were seriously concerned about the contractor tax issue but since
      I was incorporated, after some discussion they went ahead with
      hiring me).  Some agencies won't even do corp-to-corp though
      these seem to be getting fewer.

  2 - Some companies will only hire through a corporation (yours or an
      agency) in order to try and head off any claims by the IRS that you
      are their employee, followed by a big tax bill and fines.

  3 - Some tax deductions are much easier/safer to take as a corporation
      than as a sole proprietorship.  Some deductions may only be
      available to you as a corporation.

  4 - If you are making a large income from your business, or wildly
      varying income from one year to the next, you can often save a
      large amount of money in taxes if you set things up correctly.

  5 - Liability!!  As a sole proprietor, if you are sued over your work,
      everything you own is up for grabs, so you can lose your house, car,
      bike, and latest Linux CD's :-)  As a corporation, so long as you
      are careful to follow all the rules and keep a strict separation
      between your business and personal life/finances/etc., it is
      very difficult for anyone to successfully go after your personal
      assets as a result of things you did for them through your
      corporation.  There are some exceptions (like theft), but done
      right, you should be pretty safe.

NOTE: If you do decide to incorporate, you will almost certainly want to
      look into Subchapter S tax classification.

Some reasons not to incorporate:

  1 - Alot more paperwork (a good accountant can relieve you of some, but
      not all of it).


My personal feeling is that unless you have liability concerns, if your
business net and salary/wages from the business are less that $10,000 a
year, it's probably not worth it, but once you start getting into the
$30,000 and beyond range, the tax differences can become really
significant.  If you are doing this as a sideline and have a full-time job
as well (or your wife does if you are married), incorporating may be
worthwhile at significantly lower business income levels, because you will
presumably already be in a higher tax bracket from your other income.

You can pick up a good qwerty keyboard just about anywhere
for under $20.  Fry's has an extensive line-up.
If you want to get a Dvorak, get one with hardware key mapping
so you don't have to reconfigure the systems you plug it into.

Subject: [PLUG] Time for a new keyboard....  (OT?)


Yeah, this one has lasted me about siix years now and only cost me $2
(on sale).

I think, however, that it is time for a new keyboard.  The i key repeats
itself.  The o key sometimes stopps working until I slam down on it
(just the o key) with such force that my finger hurts.  And it is very
clicky.  VERY clicky.  They hear me on the second floor when I type.

So, I'm going to Fry's today oor tomorrow to buy myself a new keyboard! 
Oh, look at that, the o key is repeating just like the i key does.  Are
there any suggestions for a decent keyboard that'll last me a while? 
Sure, keyboards are things most people spend $10 on and never worry
about, but I want a decent keyboard that'll last me another six years.

:::looks in wallet:::

$27 there, and somebody owes me $10 cash, so the budget for this
adventure is $37.  I require the oversized (2.5 keys length?) backspace
key and under the enter key need it set up like:

/ SHIFT (1.5 keys length?) \

Not any of those with the \ key hidden somewhere.  I also need my
Windows key between CTRL and ALT on the left side.  I don't care about
much else... I woudl think the winkey placement is standard now,
though.  I want a *real* keyboard, too, not one of those Microsoftian
'contour' ones.  Flat and straight, please.  :-)

Do y'all have Keyboard buying tips/suggestions/good brands?  I would
definitely appreciate some input!

Message-ID: <20020823232742.50647.qmail@web10508.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi

I frequently buy Linux distros from Linux Central
(.com).  They sell just the distro for a really low
rate.  Example: you can get 7 disks of Debian for $14.
 3 disks of Red Hat 7.3 cost around $7.  

The only problem is that the shipping is a little too
expensive.  

Would anyone know of a place here in the Portland
Arean that sells distros only?  

Thanks

Don

That pretty much sums up my experience with Netscape's Java on UNIX.  It's
been that way since Java first went in to Netscape.

Turns out that if you force it, it works.

The advice I've gotten is basically:

1) If you're doing it for tax purposes, you'll usually wind up
as a S-corp anyway, so the tax benefit is nearly nil.

2) If you're doing it to limit liability, you can't protect things
*you* do personally behind a corporate shield.  If you have others
working with you, then yes, a corp prevents you from personally
biting for their stupidity, but nothing is going to prevent you
from being responsible for *your* actions.

Take that as you wish.  I wasn't inc'ed until I had others flying
under the Stonehenge banner.  I was a sole-prop for about 10 years.

Not to me.

1)  DVORAK works in most any operating system, including PalmOS which
doesn't even use a keyboard by default.
2)  Learning Linux would essentially have no effect on Windows usage,
minus the occaisional cp instead of copy while learning DVORAK well
could have quite an effect on my use of systems set up for QWERTY.

I'm not arguing against DVORAK at all.  I'm simply saying I'm not going
to learn it right now as it would take keyboard fixing (I'm not going to
learn to type on a keyboard by hitting the WRONG letters), and basic
training.  Right now, with QWERTY, if I think I, I hit I.  If I learned
to do the same with DVORAK, I would have to think I, think DVORAK or
QWERTY? and then hit the proper I.  Because I *do* work on many systems
set up for QWERTY, I cannot justify hampering my QWERTY-skills by
learning a new keyboard/typing style because three people say it works
better.

> PS: Like Linux/Windows, it is possible to learn both Qwerty and Dvorak! :)

It is possible to run both Linux and Windows, looking like Linux or
Windows, on the same (single) computer, thoough.  It isn't possible to
have both a QWERTY and DVORAK keymap on the same keyboard, though, is
it?  If you switch from one to the other, your keys will look wrong,
unless you pry each of them off and put it in the proper place (except I
noticed A was in the same place).

No thank you.

And why am I defending my typing style here?  Sheesh.  :-)

Careful, this is a myth, according to my sources.  More and more,
even if you are very careful to follow all the rules, there's one
thing that case law has pointed time and time again:

    If *you* do the work, *you* are liable.

Piercing corps to get at the actual actors is routine now.  So,
beware.

I would do that, but I prefer paying the full price for a distro I'm
going to use full time.  How better to support it than to give the
company money?

Although, I wouldn't give RedHat money, and I don't think Debian takes
money, so for those two cases, I have no problem...  :-)

Many PLUGers will give ya a burned copy in return for a blank CD-R. 
Can't beat that price.  If you're in the Newberg/Sherwood general area,
I'll burn you Slackware 8.1... and I don't need/want a CD-R in return. 
But if you like it, you should buy it!  :-)

They really do suck, you should stick with the closed-source drivers,
they're far superior in performance and features.

You needn't. I'd wager nearly all PLUGgers are plunking QWERTY *raises
hand*. It is, however, an interesting topic (albeit not exactly linux

It's not a myth, but it isn't bulletproof either.  In most cases that I
have looked at, the people who got nailed, got it because they did
something to pierce the corporate shield.  Usually this means they did
something illegal, or they mixed business with personal.  I am not
implying that this is the only way, sometimes all it takes is a bad judge
or a lousy attourney,  In either case, you are still MUCH safer as a
corporation than a sole proprietorship, since as a corporation the law
assumes that you are not personally liable until proven otherwise, where
as a sole proprietorship, the law assumes you are personally liable, no
proof required.

This depends on how much money the corporation makes, how much you pay
yourself as salary and a variety of other things that are mostly up to
the person running the corporation (within certain limits).  I have saved
an enormous amount of money in taxes since switching from sole
proprietorship to S corporation.

My wife looked into what was involved with incorporation. It seemed like 
the most popular state is Delaware from what I recall. They have fairly 
lax rules governing corporations with regard to board meetings and a 
bunch of other stuff. I've worked for several small companies on the 
west coast over the years and they were all incorporated in Delaware. 
I think you pay some sort of registered agent in Delaware so you 
technically have a office within the state or something to that effect. 

I don't recall how much it cost to incorporate but seemed to be pretty 
cheap and there are a lot of websites put up by agents in Delaware that 
can be used to setup a corporation.

  Most of us are not so large that the breaks related to Delaware
incorporation are worth while.

  In 1994 my accountant charged me $84 to fill out and file the papers. The
corporate stamp and the bank deposit stamp _were_ expensive. I pay $30 per
year to retain registration with the Corporate Division of the Oregon
Secretary of State's Office.

  Every so often I write up minutes for the annual meeting (which I usually
hold over a cup of coffee some morning when I think of it). I print the
minutes and put them in the corporate binder.

  No big deal.

This statement seems to be just for kewl RH bashing.. Do you realize how
much money they put back into our community.. How they help support some
of the best kernel hackers around.. (read: Alan Cox) I mean come on..
How much code they offer up for better performing applications and
better performing kernels..  

But I guess now it's cool to hate Red Hat. That must be it..

I agree.  RH is the most successful commercial distro so naturally
there's a backlash against them, I suppose.  RH has quite a few developers
on staff and contributes a lot of code to various open source projects.
But ooooohh...  they're a commercial company so that automatically makes
them the anti-christ, doesn't it.  Sheesh.

I wouldn't give RedHat money because I don't believe they put out a
product that comes even close to what I want from a Linux distro.  I
think most RH users here would find the same were true if they worked
out things on another distro... although I'm sure there are applications
where RH would be the best way... in which case, *do* pay them money.

RedHat wouldn't notice if I paid them money (and what is it... like
$60-90?), while I knoow at least Slackware would probably notice if I
bought it.  Slackware, being a one-man company.

JMHO....

If you like the keyboard you have, why not pull it apart, clean it up,
and give it another few years of service?  It might take an hour or
so, but there are worse ways to spend an hour than caring for a
reliable tool.

A bowl of warm, mildly soapy water, a small screwdriver to pry the
keycaps off with, patience, and a sense of meticulousness have helped
when I've done this in the past.  Slosh the keycaps in the bowl of
water, rinse well, and give them plenty of time to dry.  Compressed
air is useful, too.

I wouldn't think twice about doing this for my own keyboard.  Aside
from the avoidable risk of moisture in the electonics, the thing I
should do, but don't, is apply some type of lubricant to the few
moving parts as I reassemble it.  Not knowing what type of grease they
use in the factory, I'd rather leave them dry than apply something to
them that will deteriorate the plastic.

Of course, your mileage may vary.  And a single lost part can render
most of the rest of your efforts moot.

Good luck -

Please don't use the term "anti-christ".  We should not confuse real-world
evil with ancient mythological mumbo jumbo.

Red Hat has taken something truly progressive that could be a gateway into
a new world of abundance and sharing and compromised it down to something
palatable to the Capitalists.

We have already shown that our community yields superior tools available
to a greater number of people than any market could possibly produce, yet
there are those among us who still believe it is necessary to inject
greed, selfishness, scarcity, and exploitation.

Now, Debian has produced far superior software and greater distribution
capacity (and I've yet to hear an argument to the contrary) while still
holding strong to essentially progressive ideals.

Change the name of the driver in XF86Config or XF86Config-4 from
"nvidia" to "nv".  You may have to disable the GL extension or reinstall
X due to the NVIDIA_GLX package overwriting the GL code in X.

Well, I like the layout of the keyboard and that it has lasted this
long... but it is too clicky for me.  The Keytronic Lifetime Basic looks
like it is exactly what I was wanting....  It (and the keyboard layout I
want) can be pictured here: 
http://filebox.vt.edu/users/alrobin2/keyboard/keytronic.jpg

I'll see if Fry's has any tomorrow and see how clicky they are (if they
have any).  The review I read said they weren't clicky at all.  If they
don't any of those, I'll try a Logitech and Microsoft.  Friends on the
Slackware list I'm on said keyboards were the only decent things
Microsoft makes... so I'll see.  :-)

after editing fstab you may issue the command:  mount -a
this command reads the /etc/fstab file and mounts what is not mounted and 
possible to mount.  If you don't have a floppy in the drive it won't mount 
it.

After editing the XF86Config, exit X.  If you are using xdm or init 5 or X 
login window you must do the init 3 then init 5 to stop X and restart it.
If you had started X from a console window after logging in, then just exit X 
by CTRL-ALT-<backspace>.  This kills the X server and brings you back to the 
text console.  Then just startx.

Message-ID: <20020824053422.82132.qmail@web10507.mail.yahoo.com>

 

Gosh:

I have nothing against Red Hat.  I think they have
done a wonderful job since 1994 when I first got
interested in Linux.  Infomagic used to include RH on
their 5 CD sets of Linux.  Red Hat has just grown and
grown and grown.  They make a superior product.  I
haven't tried Slackware for around 6 years or so. 
They used to make a good product, but not to my taste.
 (Thanks, Rob for the offer of a CD of Slackware 8.0) 
The strangest one I tried was Yggdrisal (spelling?). 
I don't believe you can beat Red Hat for ease of
install and automatic detection of hardware.  Things
have come a long way.  

In a lot of ways I am still a fossil.  I like to
tinker and Linux is great for that.  Even if I do buy
the Red Hat distros via an inexpensive alternative
route, I still wind up buying support just like
everyone else when I need it.  I have bought RH 5.1,
6.1 and several earlier distros direct from RH.  I
suppose I could just download the distros via FTP in
an ISO format and burn them.  They are on a lot of
servers.  My CD burner though only supports 650 MB
formats and the ISO's are around 700 Mb (including
Index).  So I find it easier to buy them than I do to
burn them.  (I just don't feel like buying a new
burner.)    

I think it is a good idea to support your favorite
distro and I have done that in the past.  I will do it
again in the future.  We are talking a public product
and there is nothing wrong with getting the distros
anyway you can.  I did send Kevin money for a Kevin's
Red Hat Uber Distribution (KRUD) at www.tummy.com.  It
sounds intersting.

I discovered that you can download an ISO of a boot CD
for Debian and then download the rest of what you need
from the internet.  That is an exciting new way to get
the distribution (for me).  I am going to try it
tonight.  There are a few things I don't like about
Red Hat 7.2 so I am going to try something new.

Thanks for all the response.  I didn't mean to be
stirring up any kind of argument.  I think we all need
to work together for the good of computing in general
and Linux specifically rather than shouting
irresponsibly about one distro or company over other
companies.  Any person or entity who is furthering
Linux is furthering something we all love.  The more
boxes with penguins there are in the world will create
a broader customer base for better software.

Thank you for listening.

Don

This statement seems to be just for kewl RH bashing..
Do you realize

much money they put back into our community.. How they

some

How much code they offer up for better performing

But I guess now it's cool to hate Red Hat. That must

Yeah... I have an IntelliMouse Explorer (1.0) and really love it.  It
was just that guy's opinion that keyboards were the only good things.  I
also have a ForceFeedback Sidewinder joystick that rocks.  I haven't
looked in to Linux support for that yet, though... but are there even
any games in Linux that support it?  Probably not.

You do realize that one truth that MS has proven time and again is that 
the best product doesn't necessarily get the most use (read "market 
share"). It's the product that has the best marketting that generally 
gets the most eyeballs, and those eyeballs translate directly into sales.

I'm not saying it's right, wrong or indifferent. What I'm saying is 
that's the way things work in the world economy we currently have.

Geez, that sounds like MS created the QWERTY keyboard. We've had QWERTY 
keyboards for many decades longer than MS and been around.

Before I bought my nvida card I looked around, the box said, linux
support, it was a good card so I bought it.  I was disappointed when I got
it home and found out it was propriatary support.  I do like to play
games, and I haven't seen anything comparable with the geforce in
price/performance that has good linux support.  I really want open
drivers, but I don't have the will power (when it comes to video cards) to
get something else.  I feel bad, but AFAIK my options are fairly limited.
In fact games are the only reason I still have windows, I don't use it
much, but during the breaks it can be fun to reboot and play diablo 2 or
NWN, or ...

sad but true,
Jason

I think it is cool to be suspicious and question the activites of people
who have material wealth as a major motive.  Or in other words, becareful
of corporations.  Yes, RH does a lot of good things and you mention some
of them, but we can still be cautious.  Perhaps it sounds (or is) too
critical at times.

I don't give RH money because I don't directly use their product, and I
don't even feel like I have enough to give to debian, which I do use.  And
money isn't the only way to give back to the open source and free software
communities.  Being on plug and trying to help people benefits the
community too.  Just using the software and giving a bug report or bug fix
helps.

I don't think the statement was meant to bash RH.

If I use text editor to edit fstab on KDE can I use the desktop icon to 
mount the floppy???  Or I have execute those commands on Konsole window ???

>After editing the XF86Config, exit X.

If I use text editor to editor XF86Config-4, whether exit X to text-mode 
(Ctrl+Alt+F2) and then change back to X (graphic mode) with (Ctrl+Alt+F7) 
???.  The new settings would be executed.

Thanks in advance.

Well... the corp gets taxed at your rate if you're an S corp, but that
doesn't make it a non-benefit.  By splitting your income between two
entities (the corp and you) you can pay a lower rate overall.  Just as
importantly, it becomes a lot easier to avoid the dreaded AltMin tax
when you can split your income.

It's probably the case that there is little tax advantage for household
incomes less than $70-80K.

There are, however, other perks to incorporation, such as the ability to
set up your own 401K, to buy health insurance with pre-tax dollars,
etc.  Again, the benefits scale with income.  If you're not going to
save more than $3K a year, a SEP IRA is all you'll need and a sole prop
can get one of those easily.

An excellent point.  Making a distinction between the actions of the
principal owner and the actions of the corporation can be subtle and
subject to interpretation. All small biz would do well to be aware that
incorporation does not make one bulletproof nor make one's own assets
untouchable.

I don't think any of us were implying that.  MS Luser and QWERTY have no
connection.  In fact the support in windows2000 for dvorak is really good.
You can toggle between them with a keyboard shortcut.

The reason I brought it up in the first place, was that I was just trying
to pass on a cool thing I learned.  Dvorak made my hand aches go away.  I
thought that was worth sharing with other typists.

I'm sorry if my advice has caused anyone to feel inferior or persecuted.

I use mount -a as a trouble shooting tool.  After editing /etc/fstab, run
mount -a and you can basically double check your work. About 99% of the
time you can detect a typo at that time.  Instead of 3 months later when
you upgrade your kernel.

I would like to add that a lot of setting for X can be expeiremented with
useing xset.  I like to try things out before they go into the config
file.  xset is great for that, most of the time.

Stephen,

  I've no idea. I've never run KDE and I'm completely unfamiliar with all
its toys and gadgets.

  The only X desktop I've run -- since I discovered it after a couple of
weeks with xfwm, xfwm2 and afterstep -- is Xfce. For me, it's perfect. I
never log in directly to X because there are times when I just want to check
mail or do other tasks that would be done on the command line in any case.

  So, I have a command line when I log in and I use the 'startx' command to
load the gooey. Again, this suits my preferences and is not advocated as the
Right Way for anyone else.

  Back to your question: I presume that a 'konsole' window is KDE's version
of an (x|a|e|term/rxvt); that is, a virtual console with a command line in
which to type. I may be completely wrong, because I'm not a RHCE or SysAdmin
or any other kind of computer professional, but I don't think that you can
have the system pick up changes in your Xconfiguration without stopping X
and restarting it so it reads all the preference files.

  In Xfce, a left-pointer click on the root window (i.e., background) pops
up a menu. One of the choises is to Quit xfce, and the submenu from that
offers a choice to restart xfce. This I can do without shutting down X or
closing any open applications. Convenient. Perhaps KDE has the same ability.

HTH,

  I have no intention of igniting a vitriolic tempest here, but I really
would like to understand the emotional basis for this recurring theme on the
PLUG mail list: my distribution is better than your distribution.

  For the past four or five years I've seen this over and over again;
sometimes it gets quite annoying, sometimes only takeing up space in the
mail file until deleted. But, the defenders of one distribution attack
others with equal intensity. Reminds me of the rear windows in pickup trucks
I see: Ford trucks have a decal of Calvin pee-ing on a Chevy or Dodge logo;
Chevy trucks have a decal of Calvin pee-ing on a Ford logo, and so on.

  Why?

  What possible difference does it make what distribution any of us use? As
a matter of fact, those who are most zealous in defending their
philosophical favorite are actually exhibiting behavior that is inimical to
the linux/*BSD/UNIX/etc. way. We see examples of this constantly on this
mail list.

  For example, someone -- including me -- will post a question on how to
achieve a certain task. Answers pour in from the audience showing how it can
be done via shell script, perl, python, grep, awk, sed, emacs, vi, scheme,
and so on. Why? Because there is more than one way to solve any computer
problem on a unix-type system. Even the linux kernel, as I understand it,
has selected the best parts of SysV (SVR4) and BSD (4.3?) to create another
Way to Computing Nirvana.

  So, the bigotry/zealotry/hatred for and against certain businesses
contradicts this base. Those who rail againt Corporations, "suits", the
un-pure and lower castes only exhibit naivety, ignorance or blindness to the
world in which we all live.

  I do not expect to change anyone's beliefs. But, I would very much like to
understand why we see so many messages on this same theme.

Off-list responses welcomed,

Rich

  Can you say, "typewriter"? The QWERTY layout came about to slow typists
down because the arms on a mechanical typewriter would become jammed if you
typed too fast. I know this from experience, having used mechanical
typewriters in the '50s and '60s (that's 1900, not 1800).

I'm allowed to believe they're mumbo-jumbo, personally. If I believe the
Bible is mythology largely, just like the tales of Greek Gods, isn't that
still allowed? I know this country is sliding quickly towards a theocracy,
but last time I checked it was okay to hold a belief counter to the

That's not at all what I was implying. I was merely trying to indicate that

If you still have the source laying around, try `make uninstall`.
It's always nice when that works, but not all programmers are nice that way.

Why do you assume it's an emotional basis?

This is more example of what I've been trying to describe for the past
year (seemingly every time these arguments arise):  Red Hat users try to
dismiss the argument as emotional, merely preferential, and irrelevant.

It's not a theoretical, "My dad could beat up your dad" argument and it is
only Red Hat (and Red Hat-like) users who try to say so.

Personally, I think this is because Red Hat users do not have a strong
technical, ethical, and moral reason for choosing the software they use
and, therefore, have a very hard time understanding that some people DO
have such a foundation for their choices.

This whole approach to the discussion is just a defense mechanism to avoid
actually discussing the system on its merits, which are few.

>   What possible difference does it make what distribution any of us
> use?

I think that's exactly the question Karl has been trying to answer all
along and has been completely ignored.

There is a system out there that gives people freedom on an individual
level.  There is a distribution that is developed and maintained with
higher ideals than greed and selfishness.  Using such a system builds a
stronger, more empowered community.  Using such a system for development
brings unparalleled consistency to software packaging and
configuration.  Working within such a system gives a person a better
understanding of how people can interact without competition, greed,
exploitation or other destructive forces and that might carry over into
other aspects of that person's life.

The Red Hat user's response to all this has been something like, "I'm not
sure if that's true.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Yeah,
but maybe not."  There is no counter-argument proclaiming that using Red
Hat actually makes the world a better place.  Hell, there's not even the
counter-argument that Red Hat is technically superior, easier to use (in
fact, it's fairly apparent from the number of rpm questions that at least
the package management system is NOT as easy to use or technically
advanced as Debian system), or on higher ethical ground.  Instead, there
is merely the argument that we shouldn't have the argument.

What "way" is that, again?

And for small tasks such as this, there really isn't any difference in
which method you choose.  The speed, efficiency, and efficacy of each is
mitigated by the simple fact that it's still going to take less than two
seconds no matter which method you use.  However, in larger questions of
architecture, the relative differences become more relevant and a bigger
sticking point in the decision process.

How many hours have YOU spent tracking down rpm dependencies?

And, of course, your example also totally avoids any ethical consideration
of the issue at hand.  All of the utilities you described above are
available in GPL-compatible variants and available to all people
everywhere without conditional restriction or imposed control.

It might be naivete, but it's not ignorance or blindness.  Many of us
believe that the world in which we all live is on the fast track to
destruction; be that destruction environmental, social, or otherwise.  The
systems used in this world to which we willfully turn a blind eye have
evolved in such a way so as to incorporate criticism, protest, and even
outright dissidence without changing those aspects criticized, protests,
or dissented.

Working within the system is, unfortunately, the only choice in certain
arena (until, of course, the revolution comes and people get off their
asses all at once), but software is thankfully is not one of those.  We
can develop Free Software and the community outside the destructive
systems of power.  And because the Free Software community is based on
basic ideas of freedom and communication, any attempt by the power
structure to restrict our community is a shining and obvious example of
our that structure works against the people to protect itself and
therefore can be used as ammunition for evangelizing and bringing about
greater revolt against the powers that be.

Mostly because the discussion is quickly derailed from actual merits of
the software system (quality, philosophy, usability, etc.) and into this
meta-discussion of who useless the discussion is.

Yes, but do you CARE if it's right, wrong or indifferent?

Do you want think there is a right way?  Do you want to make a little

Economy is the science of scarcity.  Free Software is abundant.  We don't
have to worry about the world economy.  (Now, bandwidth is a scarce
resource, but that's another issue.)

We can take our community outside that world and construct a new one that
is better.

This behavior isn't just coming from the RH users.  Not IMHO.

RH ships with a modified kernel, with more device drivers..  And a lot of
rpm's are optimized for newer computers.  These are two technical reasons
to use RH over other distros.  There are more reasons, some consider it a
defacto standard.  I don't use RH, but if I did, I know I could lay those
on the line as technical reasons.  BUT, the counter argument would be that
you can download the RH kernel and use it on other distros, that you can
install RPM on other distros.  It's free software, we could create a plug
distro which is a RH/debian hybrid...how cool would that be! :)

Is this about technical merit?  I feel it is closer to an emotional
argument.

Does using RH make the world a worse place?  You're either part of the
problem or solution, right?  Use RH supports open source, so I think it
does help make the world a better place, maybe not as quickly as other
approaches, but it's not evil.

I think you have to becareful about lumping the overall ease of use, with
the ease of use for specific utilities and programs.  I don't want to
argue about apt or rpm, but yes I would say apt is easier to use. BUT, RH
comes with many programs to help people do many command line tasks.  Well,
so what, so do other distrobutions?  In RH they are usually graphical,
making the transition from a more "user friendly" OS easier.  I remember
back when I was new to all this that RH won me over compared to slackware
because of that.

Shouldn't the argument be "how can we (users of distro x) make our
distribution better?".  I mean really, since it is all free software, then
we can merge features to satisfy user groups.

I think the man has a point.  We pluggers should be devoting our energies
not toward converting everyone to our distro, but to helping linux users.

And yes, I realize that I should never have replied because now I'm
encouraging this thread to go on even longer...And no I don't use RH and

I'm not a RedHat user and I'd be a FreeBSD user if Linux had not won the
"hype war".  I use debian and have been playing with Mandrake.  Bu I can
find no "strong technical, ethical, [or] moral reason for choosing" one
Linux distro over another, at least the major distro's, for general
workstation use.

If one want's a strictly moral or ethical choice and one finds making
money selling free software objectional, I think you'd have to go with
debian or one of the minor distro's. Frankly, what RedHat, Mandrake,
SUSE and others are doing would appear to be within the original intent
of the GPL, it is certainly within the letter. If somebody did not want
RedHat to include their software in it's package they should have chosen
a different License or not released it at all.

Having done software development in UNIX since 1978, I am of the opinion
that, the technical differences between the various free UNIX
distributions are trival.

I just got back from Fry's.  I was really hoping they would have a
better selection than they did.  The only Logitech keyboard they had on
display was a $50 one... way more than what I needed.  The only
Microsoft ones they had on display were the wavy ones... while I did
find myself able to type quickly on it just right there without any
practice, I'd rather stick with a traditional one and save a little desk
space.

They had but one with the exact layout I wanted.  I guess when I do my
DOS stuff (DOSSLACK is still needing lots of work...) I'll probably be
hitting shift instead of \ a lot.  Oh well.  At least I'm not hitting \
instead of enter!  :-)

It's an Inland Pro Keyboard 4000.  It cost $20, so if it only lasts a
year, I'll be able to justify getting a nicer one (maybe one of those
Microsoft Office keyboards, they've gotten rave reviews).

It's got a fairly soft sound to it and the keys almost feel like they're
padded... they don't stop so abruptly at the bottom of the stroke.  They
take a little more force to push down, though, I think... so that might
cause problems ... or might not.

Well, there's all you ever wanted to know about Rob's keyboard!  :-)

Someone once told me--I've never researched this--that the reason that there 
was almost no carpal tunnel injuries with typewriters is because some force 
was required to press the keys and that the advent of "soft-touch" keyboards 
don't give your fingers enough excercise: muscular resistance.

This is interesting. The ``ancient mythological mumbo jumbo" you mention --
the symbols, allusions & trope of the Judeo-Christian religion -- are part
& parcel of Western Civilization. Just as Buddhism is integral to Japanese
culture, Taoism to Chinese, & Hinduism to Indian. In other words, one
doesn't have to believe in the ideas this complex of symbols embraces, but
avoiding its contribution to our language impoverishes your ability to
communicate. According to the literary critic Northrop Frye, no major
literary work of Western Civilization since about AD 300 fails to use
this background either explicitly or implicitly. (And the exceptions draw
upon an alternative set of -- in your terms -- ``ancient mythological
mumbo jumbo".

And would you also object as vehmently to some using the term ``karma"?
Say in the phrase, ``So-&-so's karma finally caught up with him?"

I find nothing here but sloppy assertions & emotion. How has RH
corrupted ``something truly progressive"? Is it for reasons other than
they are a business & have been paid money for developing Linux?

How has RH injected ``greed, selfishness, scarcity, and exploitation"?
You can still download their isos -- including source code -- from their
servers, they pay numerous developers to work on Linux code, and they
have donated money & labor to support computers in the North Carolina
school district. Am I missing something in how RH operates?

Has RH not abided to the terms of the GPL? And is following the GPL that
important? Linus doesn't appear to think so, otherwise he wouldn't be
using BitKeeper to manage his code.

I appreciate the offer.  It is indeed very kind, but the location is a
little out of the way.  For others, it may be fine and if someone wants
to teach a class out there, go for it.

However, I am not willing to make the trip out there for this, and I am
worried that others might feel the same way.

What does this mean?  You choose a GNU/Linux system over FreeBSD because
there are more magazines bout GNU/Linux?  I don't get it.

Technical:  While the underlying technologies of operation are similar in
every important respect, the package management and configuration systems
in Debian are far more advanced than those in Red Hat.  Building and
maintaining packages and managing dependencies is cleaner and easier with
the Debian system.

Ethical:  Debian is a community-based project.  The purpose of Debian is
to both create a strong and versatile Free Software operating system (or
set of operating systems) and a strong and versatile Free Software
community.  Debian draws hard lines between packages which are Free and
non-Free.

Moral:  Decisions regarding the Debian project are not made by those who
personally benefit more than the community at large by those
decisions.  There is no power structure within the Debian project that
allows the few to exploit the many.  The Debian project does not accrue
capital based on its monopoly of existing capital.  The Debian project has
no secrets.

Selling software isn't a problem so long as the people who buy it have the
right to redistribute.  The problems with corporations are more closely
related to the manipulation of "public" stock, the wage slavery of
hundreds or thousands of workers, and the consequential accrual of
inordinate wealth by the few.

I absolutely respect the right of Red Hat to exist.  I just think it's sad
that people use their system when there are alternatives with greater
benefit.

I would argue that the only non-trivial technical difference between the
various common distributions is the package management system.  Certainly
the tiny differences in filesystem layout and configuration file location
or format is trivial (unless we're talking about a system that uses binary
configuration files, which would be a non-trivial difference in my book).

Would that be a classic of the "instant classic" variety?  It's less than
a month old.

I personally think this article is funny because it points out, as The
Onion often does, the anti-intellectual bias and non-critical acceptance
of our lifestyles and culture.  I suppose I can see how a non-critical,
anti-intellectual person might think it's making fun of analysis and
criticism, but I don't think that's the point at all.

I couldn't really tell you. All I know is in the /boot directory there 
are two kernels. One named "vmlinuz" and the other "vmlinuz.suse". 
There is only one set of 2.4.18 modules that are used by either kernel.

I've never built an RPM, but I've heard that Debian is not "far more
advanced", it's just that the people making .debs put a little more effort
into making them work well, whereas RPM builders, on the whole are
slightly more careless.  But then again, since you've mentioned many times
that you don't use any packaging system, but instead build from source,
I'm wondering if you are able to provide any details as to why .debs are
"far more advanced."

I don't think any of the other distros are really any different in this
regard.  They all want a strong community.  And Red Hat complained
recently about licensing restrictions on StarOffice.

That "sounds" counter intuitive to me. Carpal Tunnel Syndrom (CTS) is a 
Repetitive Stress Injury (RSI) and a Cummulative Trama Disorder (CTD). 
According to one article 
(http://continuous-speech.com/carpal_tunnel.html) CTS has been described 
and studied since at least 1863. The carpal tunnel release surgery has 
been common since the 1950s.

According to other papers I've read (sorry, no online reference), the 
drastic increases we've seen in the last 30 years is due to the vast 
proliferation of computers. Prior to this time, CTS was seen mostly 
among professions where repetitive hand motions were used. Typing is 
only one of these. Factory workers on an assembly line were also 
aflicted. Mail handlers at Postal facilities have been aflicted 
practically since the inception of mail service. I've also seen reports 
that playing a traditionally shaped guitar can cause CTS.

According to this (http://www.lunnflutes.com/ho6.htm), many musicians 
suffer from CTS. Pianists and guitarists among them. I suspect that CTS 
has been with us since the invention of the piano, and probably much longer.

The thing is, more people are using keyboards, both musical and digital. 
  Because of this, more people are getting CTS, so we hear about it 
more. It's more mainstream than it was previously.

Of course, I'm not a doctor, and I'm just going by what reports I've 
read. YMMV, so take everything I've written here with a $1.55 and you 
can buy a cup of coffee at Shari's.

That's usually screamed at a pilot just before they plow into the ground

And you should ask yourself, "Why is that?"

I think the reason is at least two-fold:  First, the Debian project
maintains an official repository of packages that have been checked and
rechecked by committed members of the community to ensure that the
packages adhere to the strict guidelines in the Debian documentation.  
Second, the Debian project uses specific package maintainers who are
committed personally to the success of the project while Red Hat packages
are either produced by wage slaves or hobbyists whose primary motivation
is just to bust out something that works "good enough" for a majority of
installations.

This concept can be generalized into the idea that people working for
wages do just enough to get by while people who work for either love or
necessity do as much as they possibly can.

Also, the superiority of the system is not merely in the packages and
their structure, but the package management tools that allow, within the
Debian system, a user or administrator to download, install, and configure
a package and all of its dependent packages with a single command.

Yes, they all WANT a strong community.  Surely the strong community is
good for Red Hat's profits.  That's where morality comes in.  To me,
ethics is a determination of right and wrong and morals are a
determination of motivation to do right or wrong.

The question then is, "What are they doing about it?"

Debian is structuring itself AS that community of involved human beings
who are committed to building a great system for the sake of having a
great system and making it available to all people for all time.

Red Hat is complaining about licenses because a good office package would
boost their saleability and, hence, their profits.

Which stands on higher ground?

> Just out of curiosity, do you have a job?

Nope.

> Or would that compromise your beliefs?

As I've written a thousand times, the entire reason we should be looking
toward alternatives to the structure of our current economy and society is
the inherent, required exploitation of a system based on greed,
selfishness, and fear.  Note the word "required".

I wrote just today that it's unfortunate that we must work within this
abusive, destructive system in some (perhaps many, certainly too many)
capacity in order to simply maintain the struggle against it.  Therefore,
it is necessary, from time to time, to allow a capitalist to exploit my
labor for his personal profit so that I can simply sustain myself.

To put it bluntly, it is necessary for the vast majority to find some way
to please the wealthy minority in order to continue to survive.  The most
reliable way to please the wealthy is to help them accrue more wealth.

Sick, isn't it?

Tony,

  Isn't that the purpose of having to reboot several times per day? The BSOD
was built in to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome. However, ... I suppose that
rebooting often can be considered repetitive stress, especially if you're
working on a tight deadline.

No...No...No...I bet BSOD's do alot of damage to the fingers given how 
hard most people would be pressing the keys because they just lost some 
important work. One has to wonder about the amount of high blood 
pressure and other stress related diseases caused by the instabilities 
of Microsoft's product offerings occurring at the wrong time.

I've certainly been there when Word decides to puke and a document that 
I had spent many days working on was mostly lost. I was very stressed 
out having to work alot of extra hours to put the document back 
together again to meet a scheduling deadline. I've tried to work around 
this problem by saving often and also having Word do autosaves at very 
short intervals.

Yep.  If you wish a users to be able to mount the floppy add "user" to the

Ctrl-Alt-F2 just switches you to a text console.  The X server is still 
running on the seventh console.  You are switching to different sessions and 
not stopping and restarting the X server.  You must do one of the following 
to get the X server to stop and reread the configuration file.

<sniping some links & history for further study>

This all seems likely.  Sorry, it was heresay on my part.  The only thing I 
could think of is the extra muscular effort required to "pull" your fingers 
from the key as opposed to letting it "bounce" off.

Seems strange that in 2002, with all the so-called science availble, that we 
are still suffering with such primitive input devices.  As much as I like my 
scroll mouse, it is terribly uncomfortable in my big hand (both hands are 
the same size).  Haven't tried a trackball yet only because I don't want to 
shell out $50+ for something that I might hate.

What kind of mouse do you have?  You might see if you can locate an old
IntelliMouse Explorer 1.0.  If they say it doesn't work, say you'll give
'em $5 for it, because there's a design flaw which is fairly easily
fixed in 'em.

The main drawback of the IME 1.0 was that it was so big you had to
really wrap your hands around it.  While uncomfertable for most folks,
you might find it meets your needs exactly.

I've been using my current mouse, without cleaning or anything (except I
did scratch out the M$ logo on the back  <G>) since about three months
after they were released... maybe two years ago?  It's a good mouse,
built to last!

As far as I'm concerned, there's only one decent trackball, the Logitech Trackman 
Marble, it has eveloved into the Trackman Marble Plus model, which has a scroll 
button. I've even purchased spares. Don't bother with the later one that has a 1 
1/2" diameter ball, I can't even start to use it as well. I have a big hand, too, 
but it's bigger than my left hand. The trackman marble only comes in a RH (right 
hand) model. 

I only use a mouse when I have to.

Yes, this was the one I've been hearing good things about for years.  Seems 
the marble is always missing on the display units which I'm sure is great 
for sales.  Are the models bearing larger marbles (!) still avail, or are 
you glad you bought spares?

This here's a IntelliMouse 1.2A (shiped with a Gateway computer).  It's the 
largest wheel mouse I've seen.  Always keeping my eyes open, though.  What 
is the design flaw?

Well, my PHB (and on up the chain) had an epiphany (can I say that without
getting flamed?) - and we ported our release from Alpha to linux. But try
getting support from our IT group for running linux on our desktops or from
home... NOT. I refuse to use LookOut. Only limitation is not being able to
accept meeting invitations - I consider that a good thing :)

The soldering connecting the cable and/or it's connector to the board
inside the mouse has come loose on a lot of these things.  It causes the
mouse to apparetnly just die, when in fact it's just a bad cable.  If
you pop the sucker open and do a little soldering (very little) it'll be
in tip-top shape again.  :-)

You should be able to just 'make install' over the old PHP install (add
any specific configure options for your environment, of course).  If
you've made changes to your php.ini, then you'll want to backup those
changes somewhere.  Everything else, including your httpd.conf should stay
the same.  As per the instructions you followed below, I recommend setting
'register_globals = Off' for security reasons (it's the default now
anyway).  You'll then use the $_POST, $_GET, and $_COOKIE arrays instead.

It's size is one of the main reasons why I like the mouse, my big-ish
hands tend to swallow most other mice.  That and the fact that I never
have a set of rollers and mouse ball to clean, and that it's
ambidextrous (being left handed sucks when manufacturers try and go ergo
on you).  My only wish is that it was wireless but unfortunately their
wireless optical is ergo for right handers and I haven't felt like
spending the cash on a Logitech.

I used Goof-Off(tm) (my favorite solvent) for a much cleaner appearance!

I too use this trackball and love it. The thing with trackball is that 
they come with right, left or center balls. These can also be classified 
as either 'thumb' or 'finger' balls. I prefer to use my thumb for the 
trackball, and therefor, I use a left ball, for my right hand. My 
so-to-be-ex-wife preferred to use her fingers, so she had a center ball 
trackball, from MS.

It took me a while, but I realized that among the changes I made to my Linux

But I wonder; if a box has a misconfigured eth0, or if eth0 is not up, would
it be totally impossible for a cracker to gain access to that system while is

Not at all.

Misconfigured NIC: you could be hacked, depends...

Down NIC: you could be hacked from serial port or local user (which includes 
physical access).

You can root any Linux box if you can type ctrl-atl-del and reboot to single 
user mode.  Of course, there's trojans as well.  Basically, being 
un-networked makes you more secure, but not totally.

If you're in RedHat, you'll have to use RPM and might run into some
dependency problems requiring you uninstall other programs that rely
upon KDE in order to remove KDE without it being forced.  I think these
dependency things Debian's apt package system is so good at means in
debian the packages would be automagically removed, likely with
warnings... although I only installed debian once to try it out.

I'm sure others will chime in with specific instructions for RH,
Mandrake, Debian, SuSE, or whatever.  But in Slackware, pkgtool would be
your best bet.

I'm sure Jeme and Karl could help you out with that problem... <ducks>

Barring that, I'd make a list of what was dependant on kdebase and start
removing them.

rpm -q --whatrequires kdebase

should be a place to start.

On the subject of new cases, air flow and hard drives getting too warm...

If a case is in order, I would suggest getting a ChiefTech case.  Mid-sized tower, space for two 80mm fans up front and two 80mm in back (three if one counts the P/S fan).  This is the case one sees Antec and Endermax buying, modifying very slightly (such as adding USB ports to the front and tossing in their own P/S unit), slapping their name on it and selling it for even more that before.

I've got one of said cases, and it is a Very Good Thing(tm).  I installed Panaflow fans I got from Wacky Willys, moved the case a few feet down from the desk to the floor and watched my system temps drop over 5 degrees C.

One of the front intake fans sits in front of one of the two removable 3.5" bays, perfect for helping keep hard drives cool.  The bays appear to be able to hold three 1/4 height drives.  Myself, I'd not put anymore than two for heat reasons.

I did see a nice mid-tower at Fry's.  It has space for a single 120mm fan in the front and back.  CFM potential there.  It was also one of those all aluminum cases, which of course made it more expensive than it should have been.  Give me a nice steel case anyday.  Sturdy, not nearly as expensive, and one isn't afraid to use it as the occasional foot rest.

More so, actually buying distros (I think I've bought like 5, all told, RH
6.2, 7.0, 7.1, Mandrake 8.1, Suse 8.0), especially from Red Hat, puts
money back in the pocket of developers contributing to projects that
benefit the entire community. To be against that, simply because Red Hat
is a company is obviously nonesense.

Subject: [PLUG] Anybody using cdrecord or csound
Message-ID: <3D6900BC.505321E9@computer-arts.net>

If anyone is using either cdrecord or csound I'd like to compare
notes.

WRT cdrecord, I've gotten to the point where I can burn .wav files
that I've created onto a CD, and next I'd like to figure out how
to write out the "text" information describing the CD (the cdrecord
-useinfo and -text options.)  I haven't been able to figure out
how to get this to work. Probably because I can't find anything
that documents the format of the ".inf" files.

WRT csound, I'm just getting started with this and I'd just like
to know if anyone else around here is using it.

-Mike

  OK, I'll throw in my opinion on this weekend, off-topic thread. We've been
using the Kensington Orbit trackballs here for the past four or so years.
Ever since using a mouse gave me a bad case of tendinitis in my right elbow
(cured, by the way, by acupuncture).

  One unit failed about three years ago; the replacemnt and the other
original one work flawlessly, with a periodic cleaning of dog fur and dust
from the bearings and rotating rods.

  This is a two-button model with a large ball at the top, center. It's
extremely comfortable to use and permits very fine control. Trackballs that
require the use of the thumb are depending on the finger with the least
fine-motor control of the five (for most of us) fingers. That's the reason
you'll learn to never pipette anything in a microbiology course with your
thumb over the top of the pipette: can't control the outflow. We work these
trackballs with the second and third fingers on the ball and the thumb and
fourth finger on the buttons. Quite natural.

Aluminum cases have the advantage of acting as a heatsink (more so than
a steel case), since aluminum conducts heat very well. They are quite
expensive, but they also tend to be very well engineered (I have never
seen a case as preciesly made as my lian li). While you may be loosing
some "sturdyness" it is negligible, and they serve quite well as footrests
:) perhaps better, since they radiate heat in all directions ;).

Well, I don't know about knopper.net, or even where that might have come
from, but knoppix.org is working just fine here.  Did you try
www.knoppix.org or www.knopper.net?  I've never heard of that last one.

Subject: [PLUG] How to handle relay attempt
Message-ID: <1030310294.29806.507.camel@lana.manymoons.net>

I noticed that following in my mail log:

Aug 24 04:55:57 lana sendmail[2618]: g7OBtub02618:
from=<net2845mike at filnet.es>, size=0, class=0, nrcpts=0, proto=SMTP,
daemon=MTA, relay=1Cust176.tnt1.san-fernando.ca.da.uu.net
[67.227.10.176]

It is obvious that someone is attempting, but failing, to relay mail
through my machine.  

What is the best protocol for handling this?  If I read this correctly,
someone witha  filnet.es address is trying to attempt to send mail
through my machine from 1Cust176.tnt1.san-fernando.ca.da.uu.net.  I have
also noticed attempted to scan my machine from this IP (67.227.10.176). 
I wonder if the person administrating the machine is aware of this, or
is responsible for it.

Any advice would be greatly apprecated.

Since that is a UUNet address, your best bet is to send an email, with
the log entries, to abuse at uu.net.

  I find some attempts like this, but all -- so far -- are rejected by
postfix. However, I also see, in /var/log/messages, where someone has
attempted to crack in via ssh. For those attempts, I send a message to both
abuse at ... and postmaster at ... telling them someone from their IP address has
attempted to crack into our network and I provide a copy of the log record.
Quite often I get a reply telling me they've found and fixed the hole in
their system.

  Same thing with spam that gets through postfix. I have a two-sentence form
letter that I use when forwarding a copy of the offending mail -- with full
headers turned on -- to both abuse at ... and postmaster at .... Except for
originators in Asia. They don't pay attention in any case so I just add the
IP address (or address block) to the badip file that postfix checks. Much
peace of mind -- mine -- ensues.

I read this a little differently. I thought Mike was pointing out that with
little thought, Jeme insulted some people. Just as you were insulted that you
would not be allowed your beliefs, others were insulted that their beliefs were
ridiculed. I assumed Mike's point was "let's not insult or build walls as a
group".  I read your post to say the same thing.

The only way to respect your religious opinion and Mike's, is to not have the
issue broached in the first place. We are usually a good group because we all
agree to respect each other and only talk about the charter of the group. The
charter isn't official, its what we all agree is acceptable to each other. That
is why we see these periodic flare ups. We are re-learning the boundaries that
a acceptable to the group as new and old, join and leave, the group. 

The only issue with this informal demonstration of community, is when we have a
rouge that won't accept the lack of formal boundaries.The only course is to use
inaction to become action. When we have a rouge, and the person posts out of
bound, ignoring the post is the only action that will force the rouge to
either, stop posting or post within the boundaries. 


With all respect to everyone

Well, I received both of Preston's posts in this thread, but oddly never
received either of the posts to which he was responding.  I've been
waiting to receive the original posts to respond, but it's been a couple
of days and they're not forthcoming.  Can anyone tell me why?

This is so close to how an anarchist system SHOULD work, it hurts.  The
one tiny detail that you don't seem to grasp is that ignoring the rogue
poster doesn't AND SHOULDN'T make him stop or change his behavior.  The
behavior simply becomes irrelevant.

Of course, that only holds for non-destructive behavior.

And in response to Mike, whose message never reached me (replies should 
probably go to plug-talk)...

Yup.  I'd call the anti-christ Mumbo Jumbo.

First, what the hell does the Koran have to do with the anti-christ?  
Seeing as how the Koran doesn't include Christ as a divine figure, the
anti-christ has no meaning in that context.  So that's totally
meaningless.

Second, what does it mean to say that something is a "major book" and how
would that make the concept of the anti-christ NOT mumbo jumbo?

Third, did you just pull those numbers out of thin air?  (He chokes back
the more natural metaphor.)  The only real numbers I could find on the
subject was the breakdown here:
<URL: http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0904108.html >
This page gives estimates of about 53% for Christianity and Islam
combined.  And given the earlier statement that Islamic people have no
anti-christ and my anecdotal experience which informs me that many
Christians think the anti-christ is just so much ancient superstition, I'd
say we're talking about a fairly small minority indeed.

> Had you considered that most people would find your comment offensive?

No, I figured most people would agree that the anti-christ is an object of
superstitious fear and see the difference between that and the real danger
of greed and economic warfare in our civilization.

Those who would be offended are certainly in the minority.

Now, you want offensive?

Although I don't agree with some things you've said in this thread
(speaking personally as an evil SuSE user), I agree with this. I look at
the use of "anti-christ" as being a rhetorical cousin to those things
which invoke Godwin's law. If you say someone else thinks X is the
"anti-christ" then you've essentially said you won't take the time to find
a better way to explain concerns people have with X company, that might
actually be legitimate in nature.

This is interesting. The ``ancient mythological mumbo jumbo" you mention --
the symbols, allusions & trope of the Judeo-Christian religion -- are part
& parcel of Western Civilization. Just as Buddhism is integral to Japanese
culture, Taoism to Chinese, & Hinduism to Indian. In other words, one
doesn't have to believe in the ideas this complex of symbols embraces, but
avoiding its contribution to our language impoverishes your ability to
communicate. According to the literary critic Northrop Frye, no major
literary work of Western Civilization since about AD 300 fails to use
this background either explicitly or implicitly. (And the exceptions draw
upon an alternative set of -- in your terms -- ``ancient mythological
mumbo jumbo".

And would you also object as vehmently to some using the term ``karma"?
Say in the phrase, ``So-&-so's karma finally caught up with him?"

I find nothing here but sloppy assertions & emotion. How has RH
corrupted ``something truly progressive"? Is it for reasons other than
they are a business & have been paid money for developing Linux?

How has RH injected ``greed, selfishness, scarcity, and exploitation"?
You can still download their isos -- including source code -- from their
servers, they pay numerous developers to work on Linux code, and they
have donated money & labor to support computers in the North Carolina
school district. Am I missing something in how RH operates?

Has RH not abided to the terms of the GPL? And is following the GPL that
important? Linus doesn't appear to think so, otherwise he wouldn't be
using BitKeeper to manage his code.

I agree that the symbols, allusions and tropes can be used throughout
western civilization with reasonable expectation of understanding,
acceptance, and even resonance.  I don't disagree with your sentiment here
at all.

My qualm here was with his choice of metaphors.  The anti-christ,
according to the superstitions of the Christians, works toward evil ends,
rejoices in evil, and simply IS evil.  In the real world, very few bad
things are so straightforward.  The idea that any thing in the real world
could be as purely evil as the anti-christ is, of course, absurd and
therefore causes readers to dismiss the concept that corporations could be
evil at all since they're obviously not the anti-christ.

It's late and I hope that makes sense.

I'm sure there's a proper rhetorical term for that kind of association,
but it escapes me at the moment.

> (And the exceptions draw upon an alternative set of -- in your terms

I don't disagree with anything you wrote, Geoff.  I feel you misunderstood
my intent.  I can't tell you right now who is at fault in that
misunderstanding, if anyone.

> And would you also object as vehmently to some using the term

First and foremost, I would hardly call a one line objection "vehement".  
I was objecting to his rhetorical method, not his choice of terms.

A mumbo jumbo is a great evil to be feared because of superstition or
religion whereas a corporation is a great evil to be fought because of its
degradation of human interaction and debasement and devaluation of life.

I would say that's because you don't understand economic and class
warfare.

> How has RH corrupted ``something truly progressive"? Is it for reasons

Red Hat, Inc. has corrupted the truly progressive Free Software community
by developing, encouraging, and marketting an alternative community that
compromises the ethics of the purely anarchic social structure of Free
Software in favor of the greed and exploitation based hierarchical
structure of corporate America.

I would say that the inception of Red Hat, Inc. was an unavoidable part of
this struggle between the old and new worlds.  Red Hat is no more or less
evil than any other commercial operation.  The truly disappointing (and
destructive to any hope of a progressive revolution) thing is that some
would choose this compromised alternative over one of the many that carry
higher ideals.

> How has RH injected ``greed, selfishness, scarcity, and exploitation"?

By working for profit.  By restricting access to paying customers.  By
keeping wage slaves.  By selling shares on the stock market.

You're missing all the ways in which Red Hat, Inc. is like every other
profit driven corporation beholden to investors.

> Has RH not abided to the terms of the GPL?

I think a fair argument can be made that Red Hat's relationship with
certain hardware vendors is responsible for the potentially GPL violating
code included in the Linux kernel source.

Absolutely.  The GPL is that unique thing in our community that prevents
us from being exploited.

Linus is an amoral twit.  He has practically no ethics whatsoever beyond
his own personal happiness.

I've written a hundred times that this whole world would be a better place
if Linus had just handed his copyrights to the FSF in 1994.

I've been looking for some time for a PS/2, three-button, top mounted

I'd especially like the old style with a large ball mounted on a flat

Does such a thing exist in this age of marble madness?

As I said earlier, I think using the term "anti-christ" shows a lack of
ability to communicate. It's the rhetorical cousin to comparing someone to
Nazis or Hitler, in mhy opinion. It shows that the person using the term
doesn't have the ability at the time to come up with a meaningful way to
explain his opponents position. It's very easy to say "All you people
think Red Hat's the anti-christ." Rather than to say something more
meaningful.

Secondly, I'm not sure how ancient the tradition of the anti-christ is. My
understanding is that Revelations was included into the New Testament
somewhere during the middle ages, by the Catholic Church. It didn't used
to be part of the Bible originally.

Anyway, other than that, I agree with the rest of what you said. I just
think using "anti-christ" is kind of weak. Getting offended or bothered by
it is silly, but it's still a weak term to use.

???

That's a huge assertion to make without more explaination. Not that I want
you to explain that "mumbo-jumbo", but it just doesn't make sense as
explained there.

It's called pragmatism. It's not evil. In fact it's sometimes necessary to
make true progress.

I'll agree regarding the stock market, because I think the stock market is
a ponzi scheme designed to shake down the average investor (or at least,
that's how it's operated now). The rest of this, is "mumbo-jumbo". :-)

And your argument sounds like a foreign language to me. I consider myself
extremely liberal, but a lot of what I just read doesn't make any sense to
me in the current context. Maybe that's just because you sling rhetoric
without explaining why "Linus is an amoral twit".

Yes, it's pretty pitiful. I made a filter that deletes Jeme's posts on 
arrival, and manually delete every post that replies to any of his insulting 
nonsense. It is fast and easy, and an amazingly large number of interesting, 
relevant messages remain. 

It only takes one troll, and other people taking the bait, to derail and 
spoil a discussion.

Okay then...here's a question:

drivers?

Matrox?  ATI?

nVidia is *the* king of the win32 gaming world.  What card is the king

The new matrox parahilea(sp??) is pretty good and even more expensive.
The new nvidia geforce 4 ti4600 has about the same MSRP, but the matrox
card will cost you a lot more in practice.  I don't know how good the
matrox drivers are, or if they are open source. But I think they are...
Anyone have that card?

I'm the guy who started this thread and my question
still isn't answered.  

Is there a place in the greater Portland area where I
can buy just the distribution of say Red Hat or Debian
for a really low price?  I like to buy them from Linux
Central but the shipping cost is too high so I am
looking for alternates.  Red Hat from Linux Centeral
costs $7 and Debian costs $14.

I am new to the list and I don't understand how a
simple yes/no question could have devolved into
something that has dominated this list for the last 4
days.  

Let's keep our discussion on Linux technical issues
and leave the philosophy to others.

This is interesting. The ``ancient mythological mumbo
jumbo" you 
mention --
the symbols, allusions & trope of the Judeo-Christian
religion -- are 
part
& parcel of Western Civilization. Just as Buddhism is
integral to 
Japanese
culture, Taoism to Chinese, & Hinduism to Indian. In
other words, one
doesn't have to believe in the ideas this complex of
symbols embraces, 
but
avoiding its contribution to our language impoverishes
your ability to
communicate. According to the literary critic Northrop
Frye, no major
literary work of Western Civilization since about AD
300 fails to use
this background either explicitly or implicitly. (And
the exceptions 
draw
upon an alternative set of -- in your terms --
``ancient mythological
mumbo jumbo".

And would you also object as vehmently to some using
the term ``karma"?
Say in the phrase, ``So-&-so's karma finally caught up
with him?"

I find nothing here but sloppy assertions & emotion.
How has RH
corrupted ``something truly progressive"? Is it for
reasons other than
they are a business & have been paid money for
developing Linux?

How has RH injected ``greed, selfishness, scarcity,
and exploitation"?
You can still download their isos -- including source
code -- from 
their
servers, they pay numerous developers to work on Linux
code, and they
have donated money & labor to support computers in the
North Carolina
school district. Am I missing something in how RH
operates?

Has RH not abided to the terms of the GPL? And is
following the GPL 
that
important? Linus doesn't appear to think so, otherwise
he wouldn't be
using BitKeeper to manage his code.

I agree that the symbols, allusions and tropes can be
used throughout
western civilization with reasonable expectation of
understanding,
acceptance, and even resonance.  I don't disagree with
your sentiment 
here
at all.

My qualm here was with his choice of metaphors.  The
anti-christ,
according to the superstitions of the Christians,
works toward evil 
ends,
rejoices in evil, and simply IS evil.  In the real
world, very few bad
things are so straightforward.  The idea that any
thing in the real 
world
could be as purely evil as the anti-christ is, of
course, absurd and
therefore causes readers to dismiss the concept that
corporations could 
be
evil at all since they're obviously not the
anti-christ.

It's late and I hope that makes sense.

I'm sure there's a proper rhetorical term for that
kind of association,
but it escapes me at the moment.

> (And the exceptions draw upon an alternative set of

I don't disagree with anything you wrote, Geoff.  I
feel you 
misunderstood
my intent.  I can't tell you right now who is at fault
in that
misunderstanding, if anyone.

> And would you also object as vehmently to some using

First and foremost, I would hardly call a one line
objection 
"vehement".  
I was objecting to his rhetorical method, not his
choice of terms.

A mumbo jumbo is a great evil to be feared because of
superstition or
religion whereas a corporation is a great evil to be
fought because of 
its
degradation of human interaction and debasement and
devaluation of 
life.

I would say that's because you don't understand
economic and class
warfare.

Red Hat, Inc. has corrupted the truly progressive Free
Software 
community
by developing, encouraging, and marketting an
alternative community 
that
compromises the ethics of the purely anarchic social
structure of Free
Software in favor of the greed and exploitation based
hierarchical
structure of corporate America.

I would say that the inception of Red Hat, Inc. was an
unavoidable part 
of
this struggle between the old and new worlds.  Red Hat
is no more or 
less
evil than any other commercial operation.  The truly
disappointing (and
destructive to any hope of a progressive revolution)
thing is that some
would choose this compromised alternative over one of
the many that 
carry
higher ideals.

> How has RH injected ``greed, selfishness, scarcity,
and 
exploitation"?

By working for profit.  By restricting access to
paying customers.  By
keeping wage slaves.  By selling shares on the stock
market.

You're missing all the ways in which Red Hat, Inc. is
like every other
profit driven corporation beholden to investors.

I think a fair argument can be made that Red Hat's
relationship with
certain hardware vendors is responsible for the
potentially GPL 
violating
code included in the Linux kernel source.

Absolutely.  The GPL is that unique thing in our
community that 
prevents
us from being exploited.

Linus is an amoral twit.  He has practically no ethics
whatsoever 
beyond
his own personal happiness.

I've written a hundred times that this whole world
would be a better 
place
if Linus had just handed his copyrights to the FSF in
1994.

It's not distro-bashing, it's ideology-bashing.

I've been looking for some time for a PS/2,

trackball.

I'd especially like the old style with a large ball
mounted on a flat
base.

Does such a thing exist in this age of marble madness?

As I said earlier, I think using the term
"anti-christ" shows a lack of
ability to communicate. It's the rhetorical cousin to
comparing someone 
to
Nazis or Hitler, in mhy opinion. It shows that the
person using the 
term
doesn't have the ability at the time to come up with a
meaningful way 
to
explain his opponents position. It's very easy to say
"All you people
think Red Hat's the anti-christ." Rather than to say
something more
meaningful.

Secondly, I'm not sure how ancient the tradition of
the anti-christ is. 
My
understanding is that Revelations was included into
the New Testament
somewhere during the middle ages, by the Catholic
Church. It didn't 
used
to be part of the Bible originally.

Anyway, other than that, I agree with the rest of what
you said. I just
think using "anti-christ" is kind of weak. Getting
offended or bothered 
by
it is silly, but it's still a weak term to use.

Preston

That's a huge assertion to make without more
explaination. Not that I

It's called pragmatism. It's not evil. In fact it's

I'll agree regarding the stock market, because I think
the stock market 
is
a ponzi scheme designed to shake down the average
investor (or at 
least,
that's how it's operated now). The rest of this, is
"mumbo-jumbo". :-)

And your argument sounds like a foreign language to
me. I consider 
myself
extremely liberal, but a lot of what I just read
doesn't make any sense 
to
me in the current context. Maybe that's just because
you sling rhetoric
without explaining why "Linus is an amoral twit".

Yes, it's pretty pitiful. I made a filter that deletes
Jeme's posts on 
arrival, and manually delete every post that replies
to any of his 
insulting 
nonsense. It is fast and easy, and an amazingly large
number of 
interesting, 
relevant messages remain. 

It only takes one troll, and other people taking the
bait, to derail 
and 
spoil a discussion.

Short answer: no, I do not know of a local outlet for low-cost CD sets.  
However, you can get disks from other PLUGGERS, I seem to recall that a 
couple did answer your post, offering to give you disks. I can burn a 3-CD 
Red Hat 7.3 set for $5, including shipping. 

Cheapbytes does Debian for $9.99 plus shipping.

If you can't find a suitable local option, you might want to try 
www.cheapbytes.com.  For example:

Unofficial redhat 5 cd set $9 + $6.50 UPS Ground (or $5 US Mail)

Debian 3.0 x86 binary 8 cd set $18 + $6.50 UPS Ground (or $5 US Mail)

Be aware that these are strictly the CD's.  No manuals, support, etc.
They do sell the official versions of Redhat, Suse, etc., but of course
it will cost more.

Sheesh, done cutting for the last hour. Doesn't anyone know how to clip
text?

Anyway, where in Portland? I have a Cable line and a burner, so I'd be
happy to burn a few ISOs for you for free, if it was easy to meet and get
the discs and send them back or whatever. In fact, I think I have some Red
Hat 7.3 discs burned that I don't need anymore (in addition to some
FreeBSD 4.6 disks I don't think I'm going to use for now).

The Matrox cards tend to have faster 2D. The nVIDIA has faster 3D.  Both
have proprietary libraries needed for full use.  (The Matrox libraries
are less obnoxious.)  The main reason for the Matrox Hardware
Abstraction Library being closed source is that there is one bit in the
library that controls Macrovision(tm).  They don't want that information
getting out.  (Even though I have the exact location somewhere in this
mess...)

One bit to rule them all and in the darkness bind them...

I downloaded a bunch of source code the other day that came as a .gz

is supposed to be a directory with files in it.  If I use "ark", the KDE
archiver, I can extract them correctly.  
But I don't want to rely on KDE.  I should be able to tell (or at least
extract to the correct format)using standard tools.  What am I doing

This is the URL of the site where I downloaded the .gz file.

  No. But, you can get a copy of the RH cds at the linux clinic and someone
will probably offer a set of debian discs for free.

gunzip will unzip the file into a "tarball". tar is the utility to break 
the tarball into the folder and individual files you seek.

tar -xvf filename.tar

Multiple, small tools all doing their part is the Unix Way.

tar -xvzf filename.tar.gz

will unzip and untar in one step, FWIW.

I am assuming here but if the file you downloaded is a .tar.gz file, try this

tar xvfz file.tar.gz

This should gunzip and untar it into the appropriate directory structure that 
you are expecting.

If it's already gunzipped.  Try tar xvf file.tar and it should create the 
filestructure and files you are expecting.

Yeah, that's what I needed...tar.  But the extension of the file I
downloaded was not .tat.gz.  It was just .gz.  The only clue is the file
name I guess.

"file" is a very good tool for this sort of thing, it will tell you what a
file is, regardless of the extension (within the capabilities of it's
database).

$ file testFile.tar.gz
testFile.tar.gz: gzip compressed data, deflated, last modified: Sat Nov 10
15:23:37 2001, max compression, os: Unix

$ gunzip testFile.tar.gz

$ mv testFile.tar tstfile
`testFile.tar' -> `tstfile'

$ file tstfile

But, does anybody know how ATI's drivers are?

nVidia and ATi are always very very close in terms of performance here
lately... we know the nVidia drivers are non-GPL drivers, what about
ATI?  Matrox is good for business use, I guess, but really they don't
have the 3d performance to compete in today's gaming market.

...from where you're sitting.  I don't mean that as an insult, I just mean
that, given a certain critical framework, it's a fairly straightforward
recognition of the obvious.

However, I did say that I wasn't choosing my best words.  It was quite
late.

It's fairly simple.  Red Hat's purpose for being is to "increase
shareholder value" while doing all the same stuff that the community could
(and does) do for itself without the extraneous fatcat fattening.  Red Hat
then pushes this on people through marketting and an agressive PR
campaign.  All this adds up to folks who could be part of a progressive
system [as] outside the destructive Capitalist economy [as possible]
being, instead, little more than "software consumers".

And for an idea of how they corrupt the Free Software ethic, see their
page on software patents.  I don't fault them for their paltry
justification of their hyprocritical stance.  We all know how hard it is
to explain everything about a complex situation in a document read
casually and in short time.  However, they do go on to invent a new,
misleading term "Open Source/Free Software" (great idea, since people
think it means two different things already) and define it to mean
software licensed under ANY LICENSE RED HAT ISSUES.

So Red Hat is an undemocratic organization unaccountable to the community
that simply assumes the power to define and redefine important terms at
will (whatever will can be attributed to a beast made up of hundreds of
self-interested parties acting under selfish, greedy motivation) and use
those terms in the popular media as if they have commonly accepted
definitions.

Pragmatism is an agent of evil.  Pragmatism is a type of situational
ethics that allows one to justify their evil as somehow less evil than it
would be in other circumstances.  I personally believe that a situation
can make an evil perhaps necessary, but no less evil.

But anyway, this isn't a matter of pragmatism AT ALL.  There are
organizations who provide the same or better services to the Free Software
community who do not make the same compromises to the existing power
structure.

The single effect of the stockmarket that makes it both the most
destructive to life and freedom and a most desirable to the powers that be
is the removal of accountability and motivation from the hands of those
who manage or maintain a "public" company and replacing all ethics and
morality with greed and profit motive.

Nearly every company that lends its name to stock traded on the market
modifies its mission statement so that the primary verb is "to increase
shareholder value" (in one form of the words or another).  The primary
motivators go out the window at that point.  If the board of such an
organization decides to make a major decision based on something other
than a consideration for shareholder value, they can be sued into
submission to the will of the profiteers.

That aside, you don't see how the up2date system increases scarcity (to
pick one of my other above statements at random)?

> The rest of this, is "mumbo-jumbo". :-)

I guess you're using the second sense of the word meaning "unnecessarily
overcomplicated"?  I guess this because I don't see any superstitious fear
here.  I have real-world rationale for each of those statements.

Did you read his book?  Do you listen to him in interviews?  Do you read
his arguments on the kernel dev list?

He repeatedly states that he has no particular moral drive and his ethics
depend almost entirely on what is fun or easy.  He is a situational
ethicist at best and amoral at worst.

So I'll grant you that "amoral" was assuming the worst, but it is a
reasonable assumption given his comments.  And I'll also admit that "twit"
was just vitriole.

And that's totally OK!  I mean, it's disappointing and all, but it's great
that you didn't assume I wasn't making sense (all the time... you did
assume that a couple of times, I think) just because you don't have the
framework in which to couch my arguments.

Anyway, you're exactly right.  The language of class and economic warfare
is foreign to most Americans.  Every institution in our civilization is
driven by the overriding economic and political system.  All evolved
systems are somewhat resistant to change and self-protecting.  The concept
of class or economic warfare within that system is destructive to the
system and therefore not acceptable subject matter.

And so we are told to believe that our society is classless and since
there is no ruling class, there is no systematic method by which the
ruling class maintains its power and subjugates the other classes.

I do apologize for the insulting "twit" comment, but I really did think
that people understood that Linus was not involved in Free Software for
any ethical or moral reason whatsoever.  Even the title of his book show
that his hedonism overrides any consideration of the greater societal
effects of his actions.

If I was in the market for such a thing, I think I'd start at the

Remember, the more you are willing to accept proprietary drivers, the

Hello

Having a problem with kppp all of  sudden.


Stopped working..

I am using a 56k modem

I can dial up and connect...

I can ping both IP numbers on the ppp link.

I cannot ping the nameserver IP numbers in /etc/resolv.

I cannot ping anyone outside.

It had worked .....and just stopped???

Kmail with neither send or receive mail.

I get an error message indicating it can't locate the 
pop or smtp server.



Any Ideas???

TIA

Marvin

I've seen this myself - sometimes people rename them to .gz even though 
they're a tar archive ONLY, or vice-versa.

Instead of running them through file or whatnot, I just try to either 
gunzip or untar them individually.  So far, it's worked 100% of the 
time.  YMMV.

Isn't it great how we can automate ignorance?

At least when you're manually deleting a post, you know you're missing
something and you're making a choice not to know every time.  With an
automated action, you can completely forget that you've got your head in
the sand.

I've often said that mass communication has one truly socially destructive
aspect:  It allows a person to communicate with like-minded people to the
near exclusion of all others.  It started with the telephone and has only
been exacerbated by the internet.  Why talk to your next door neighbor
when you can call someone that's already a friend?  Why discuss things
with the entire community when you can build a Yahoo Group that can be
moderated down to the people who all have the compatible opinions?

Until folks started bashing MY ideology, the discussion was completely
on-topic.

Richard asked WHY we get into repeated and essentially identical arguments
about distributions every few months and I made an attempt to show that
the reason for the repetition is a total failure to come to any rational
conclusion because Red Hat users work very hard to dismiss the argument as
irrelevant and simply a matter of preference and so the real discussion of
technical or ethical consideration is buried and no resolution can be
made.

  Unlike another operating system that shall go un-named here, there is no
hard and fast rule for extensions in linux compressed files. By
_convention_, files compressed by the 'compress' utility end in .Z, those
squished by gzip end in .gz, and Tape ARchived (tar) files end in .tar.

  When a bunch of files are both tarred and gzipped, the creater usually
names the resulting file as either .tar.gz or .tgz. But, the file could be
named *.herman and it would work as well.

HTH,

Well, I'm not really in the market...yet.  But I have both a nVidia 
GeForce2 MX400 (AGP) and a Matrox G200+ (PCI).  I think if I were doing 
*just* desktop stuff, I'd definitely go with Matrox.  But the 3D front 
is much more complicated, especially in Linux.

On the win32 front, it's MUCH more cut-and-dried.  3D?  nVidia, hands down.

take a look at the parahilea(however you spell it), it is better than all
but the geforce 4 ti4600, which is currently nvidias best card.  Matrox
comes in a close second.  This notion of nvidia as the king and matrox

You could, if you are sadistic about it, embed terminal control codes into
the file name.  (I did this once on accident).  It can be a lot of fun,
maybe the file name is *.herman^H^H^Htoo.  Under normal conditions with ls
it would display as *.hertoo.  But if you try to open the file you will
find that it doesn't exist, neither would *.herman.  Finally one day I was
in dired mode in emacs and saw the real filename.

Ah the joy of file names.... :)

CRIME meeting 05/12/2002 @ 10AM @ Verizon Airtouch

Speaker(s): Gene Kim, CTO Tripwire

Subject:  "An IT Safety Metric: Why Is It So Difficult To Maintain
Control?"

Directions: C.R.I.M.E. meets in the Verizon (Airtouch) Cellular building (Take I-5
South to Carmen Drive. The building is on the West side [Tigard side] of
the Freeway). The meeting room is in the back of the building. The talk
begins at 10:00 a.m.The street address is 15575 Sequoia Pkwy, Tigard

Topic:  The job of security practitioners is bad enough trying to detect bad
guys, but what happens when forces conspire to make the task of
remediation and recovering almost impossible?  Rapid capacity expansion
and "break/fix" cycles often lead to loss of repeatable builds.  This
talk describes how the loss of production controls, configuration
management, and change control leads to configuration drift and the loss
of what is a "known, good state." We also describe how to measure it,
and recover it before you need to.

To measure an IT organization's ability to avert "unbounded security
remediation" efforts, Kim and Dr. Spafford developed the IT Safety
Index. We present case studies to display the various attributes of
Level 0 to Level 5 organizations to show how basic capabilities map to
an IT organizations ability to provide business continuity and security.

Gene's Bio:
As co-creator of the original Tripwire software and co-founder of
Tripwire, Inc., Gene Kim now serves as Vice President and Chief
Technical Officer. While his major responsibility is Tripwire products
and development of future technology, his stamp on Tripwire can be seen
everywhere, from new products and business development, to sales and
marketing. Kim also frequently serves as the company evangelist,
speaking at industry events and contributing articles on
security-related topics. 
Kim co-created the first version Tripwire software in 1992 when he was a
student at Purdue University working under security luminary, Dr. Eugene
Spafford. Tripwire worked so well it was quickly embraced by the
security community and eventually became a part of best practices for
computer security professionals around the world. After earning his B.S.
in Computer Sciences from Purdue, he earned an M.S. in Computer Sciences
from the University of Arizona. Kim also spent summers at the
Supercomputing Research Center (now known as the Center for Computing
Sciences) in Maryland working with many of the country's best computer
scientists, engineers, and mathematicians on high-performance computing
techniques for the National Security Agency. Following that, Kim worked
at Intel and then at Infinite Pictures where he met Wyatt Starnes. He
and Starnes formed Tripwire, Inc. in 1997 to create a dramatically
enhanced version of Tripwire that would protect data and network
integrity for Internet-driven businesses.

I see these all the time - when I actually see something come into my 
server and it disallows the relay, what usually happens is it rejects it 
and then sends a 'message not sent' mail back to the original sender.

What you're seeing here is postfix trying to send that message - and it 
can't find the tld for the domain that was in the original sender's FROM 
address.

Well, you must be reading different review sites than I am.

First, ATi's 9700 chip is beating the pants of nVidia's Ti4600.  Then
the Matrox isn't up to GeForce3 standards yet.  It's a good business
card.  But, really, you don't get the gaming performance out of it.

Games are "barely playable" with all three heads enabled.

I've never gotten ACPI to work either.  APM does work though, on my
laptop.  The computers I have that are new enough to come with ACPI
are both dual CPU machines, and they hang at boot when ACPI is
enabled.

Oh really?  For some reason I thought they mandated that...  Guess
not.  It's that the init scripts are supposed to contain specially
formatted comment headers that contain that dependancy information.

I disagree.

The misuse of the terms ``fascist" & ``Nazi" have so blurred the meaning
of these words that they have become empty & pejorative words. Anyone
from an offical in a police state to a person enforcing common etiquette
can be called ``fascist." (As a point of Fascist trivia, not all Fascists
were anti-Semitic: there were Jewish Fascists in England before Hitler
came to power in Germany, & Italian Fascists -- the folks who coined
the term -- didn't explicitly persecute Jewish Italians until Hitler
forced Mussolini to do so. At the same time, not all Fascists seem to
embrace the ideal of civil obedience & law & order: look at the
proclamations of contemporary neo-Nazis.)

Anytime someone starts clearly throwing cliched insults around is a
clear sign that this person has stopped thinking & is lashing out with
emotion.

The image of ``Antichrist", on the other hand, is still a fresh & precise
one. He is a human so evil & opposed to humanity that Tolkien's Sauron or
Melkor pale in comparison, who is supposed to emerge in the Last Days
before something like Jeme's long-awaited revolution occurs.

Granted, caling someone the Antichrist, or Sauron or Melkor without any
explanation why possibly betrays a likewise lack of reasoned thinking,
but the original statement merely was describing how a certain organization
was perceived in a short, easily-understood sentence. Much like one of
my favorite lines from the late magazine _Spy_, where the negotiating
methods of a pair of Hollywood agents were described as not
``good cop--bad cop, but bad cop--Antichrist".

It dates to AD 75-100, when the Book of Revelations was written. Maybe a
generation earlier. Higher textual criticism theorizes that this work is
based on a lost Jewish prototype.

I'm taking the rest of this discussion between Jeme & me offline for
everyone else's benefit.

Did anyone mention that you can get a copy of any Distro CD for the
price of the media at FreeGeek? (In other words, bring the needed blank
CDs, & it's free; otherwise it's a dollar a CD IIRC).

BTW, be careful with buying CDs on the Web. I tried to get a copy of
the Debian Distro for Sparc from one company, never received the disks,
sending email only got me an autoresponse, & their clearing house billed
my credit card even though they told me the charges would be reversed.
Yes, I am contesting it with my credit card company.

Too you, perhaps. To me, someone who doesn't really believe in the
"Antichrist", the term is is silly and almost comic-book-like in its
mythological overtones. I don't read "Left Behind" so maybe I don't
understand the seriousness of this evil that's sure to come anytime now,
but when I hear that term I take the person who spoke it less seriously,
precisely because I don't take the source very seriously either. You could
have just as easily said "Dr. Evil" for all I'm concerned.

I suppose I should read the howto though.  ;)

DAMNIT!  Why did I receive Preston's reply, but not Geoff's original
message AGAIN?

If anyone has any idea why this is happening or any evidence that it's
happening to anyone else, please let me know.  My mail logs are totally
clean.  Near as I can tell, there is no attempt to deliver some of these
messages to my server.

I apologize to Geoff, but I can only reply to the portion Preston quoted.

Geoff, I hate to say this, but you still seem to be missing the point.

Even if everything you write is absolutely true (and I don't think it is,
but that's no matter at all in this discussion), that only makes my point
stronger.

Corporations and profit-driven actions are not evil in that same sense.  
They are not directly and obviously anti-human and so a comparison to the
anti-christ is inappropriate and misleading and just shows the ignorance
and laziness of the person making the analogy.

Preston was right when he said that such a reference is the action of a
person who either does not understand or cannot be bothered to properly
consider the opposing view rationally.

This whole thing is a comment on rhetorical style, not superstition or
mythology.

Subject: [PLUG] GCC 3.2 and the kernel warning
In-Reply-To: <Pine.GSO.4.44.0208261001010.16407-100000@eel.ENGR.ORST.EDU>

Matrox drivers are open-source, although not for Parthelia ("coming
soon", according to Matrox web site). So it remains to be seen whether
Matrox will provide open-source 3D-accelerated drivers (I don't know if 3D
acceleration is enabled in Matrox drivers for G450 and below, but I don't
think it matters, the 3D performance of these cards is pathetic).
Parthelia, despite very impressive and expensive hardware, still
underperforms GeForce 4, although not by much. The difference is small,
so, if they provide a 3D driver, I'd consider switching to Matrox, for the
convenience of having an open-source driver.

Your next choice is ATI. Radeon 8500 is decent, and Radeon 9700
outperforms GeForce 4 Ti 4600... with their Windows driver. Open-source
drivers don't do a good job of 3D acceleration.

So, for now, you have a choice: if you want to have a good 3D-accelerated
card, and have the freedom to accomplish what you need, go with NVidia.
If your believes do not allow you to pollute your system with close-source
drivers, then a small inconvenience of not being able to have decent 3D
performance is a small price to pay for ideological purity (besides, what
are you going to run on that fast 3D card, most 3D card are for games, and
most 3D games are not open-sourced either).

What does /sbin/route show?  Does it list your default gateway when ppp is
up?

IMO, they already did when they stopped making the three button MouseMan (M/N M-CQ38).

No scroll wheel getting in my way, playing the part of a proper third button on the teevee.

Nice, wide-bodied mouse.  Designed to fit the curve of the hand (fits mine damn near perfectly).  I could work for hours, and often have, with one of these babies.  Gimp, occasional game of Quake I/II/III, UT, juggling Xterms, etc.

Unlike that hell-spawn of a mouse I was given to use, damned wheel mice.  Middle button made /way/ to narrow for a proper middle button (*spit* wheels).

I think I'm going to cry when the current one finally dies (already wore out an old bus mouse).

Actually, I have found tests run comparing an aluminum case and a steel case.  The two performed about the same.

So, I'm still not sure myself if they really do or not.  I've not tested it myself, mainly because I lack the extra dosh to purchase such a thing.  For now, I prefer to stick with my steel cases and spend the money I saved over the aluminum cases on some nice Panaflows.

Gotta love Wacky Willys for that.

Which probably rules out permission problems on your serial port, but
you might as well check them; I find them easy to break.

Out of curiousity, which version of the Linux kernel are you using?
And -- assuming kppp is a GUI frontend for pppd -- which version
of pppd are you using?

???  You need to be a bit more clear here.

Are you talking about squid log rotation?

general cache object high-water/low-water flush params?

per object class  high-water/low-water flush params?

general cache object keep times?

per object class keep times?

memory pool flush params???

They are all in squid.conf, most are within the default config with
fairly detailed descriptions.

Also, squid version matter, from 2.2 to 2.4 there was a fair amount of
change, versions before 2.2 handle cache control *alot* differently
(more closely tied to the original Harvest Cache project code).

Did you check to see if it shows up in the web archives? If you have an
account on drizzle (I don't), take a look at the mailman logs. By default,
they'd be in /home/mailman/logs.

Subject: [PLUG] OT: Levity
Message-ID: <3D6B9EE5.6BB61449@attbi.com>

I promise not to do this very often, but since things seem to have
gotten a bit intense of late on this list I decided that a little levity
was in order. Thus I forward on to you the decipherings of ancient
scrolls, recently discovered, that tell:

How the Internet Began

In ancient Israel, it came to pass that a trader by the name of Abraham
Com did take unto himself a young wife by the name of Dot.  And Dot Com
was a comely woman, broad of shoulder and long of leg. Indeed, she had
been called Amazon Dot Com.  

She said unto Abraham, her husband, "Why doth thou travel far from town
to town with thy goods when thou can trade without ever leaving thy
tent?"

And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short
of a camel load, but simply said, "How, Dear?"

And Dot replied, "I will place drums in all the towns and drums in
between to send messages saying what you have for sale and they will
reply telling you which hath the best price. And the sale can be made on
the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS)."

Abraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the
drums. The drums rang out and were an immediate success.   Abraham sold
all the goods he had at the top price, without ever moving from his
tent.

But this success did arouse envy. A man named Maccabia did secret
himself inside Abraham's drum and was accused of insider trading.   And
the young men did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly
take to camel dung. They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich
Dominican Siderites, or 
NERDS for short.

And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the
deafening sound of drums that no one noticed that the real riches were
going to the drum maker, one Brother William of Gates, who bought up
every drum company in the land. And indeed did insist on making drums
that would work only with Brother Gates' drumheads and drumsticks.

Dot did say, "Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by
others."

And as Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or as it came to be
known "eBay" he said, "We need a name that reflects what we are."

And Dot replied, "Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators."

"YAHOO", said Abraham.

And that is how it all began. It wasn't Al Gore after all.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0208271057520.4093-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Last month I asked twice about this problem with 1.2.0 on the lyx users
list. No responses. Today I upgraded to 1.2.1 and I still have this problem.
Perhaps someone here can point out the source of the problem.

  This is what I see when I try to invoke lyx:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ lyx
lyx: error in loading shared libraries: lyx: undefined symbol: __dynamic_cast_2

  The 1.1-x versions worked flawlessly here, but these won't. I rebuilt the
src.rpm on my RH 6.2 box, but something's still missing -- even thought I
don't get any errors during the build or install steps.

Thanks,

Rich

What's the output of ldd?  i.e. of lyx is located in /usr/bin then what does it say when you do:
[rshepard at salmo ~]$ ldd /usr/bin/lyx

  Another thing: I searched google for the dynamic_cast symbol and saw a
whole bunch of broken programs reporting the same thing. According to one
message, this my indicate that the runtime needs libc-2.2 rather than
libc-2.1. But, I thought that rebuilding on the local system avoided
dependencies like this.

Just a thought based on another thread in the last couple days...what
version of gcc did you use, and what version of gcc did they use?  You may
need to make sure that libc and lyx have used the same gcc version.  It
would be frustrating if that is true.

good luck,
Jason

Subject: [PLUG] Help with SCSI CD-RW drive
Message-ID: <3D6BD286.56B33E15@computer-arts.net>

I have a YAMAHA CRW4260 scsi CDRW drive that I'm trying to get working
on RH 7.2, Kernel 2.4.9-34. The scsi controller is a SYMBIOS 53c815.

When I boot, it *appears* that both the scsi controller and the CD
drive are detected properly. I've included what I *think* is all
the relevant output below. 

One more point. This is not the only CD on the system. There is an
IDE read-only CDROM which is properly detected and does work.

Anyway, assuming the Yamaha CDRW is being detected, I can't figure
out how to access it after I boot. If there is an entry in /dev
for anything on the scsi, I can't find it. There is no /dev/scsi
and "scsi_info /dev/scd0" says there is "no such device"

Other possibly pertinent data ...

The CDRW drive did work, with a Tekram SCSI controller on a different
build of (Mandrake) linux. I switched to the 53c815 because I can't
figure out how to get my current kernel to recognize the Tekram

Any ideas appreciated,

-Mike

Have you followed the CD-R CD-RW howto?  I think you have to make the /dev
entries next.

Here is one link to the CD writing howto:

The link above has a script for creating the /dev entries, assuming it is
working correctly.  I have never used scsi w/linux.

This part probably means you have already followed the howto, if so then
I'm sorry, I don't know how to help you...

Try removing iscsi from /etc/init.d and see what happens.

ok, I'm no expert, but I believe that you'll have to upgrade to libc-2.2

The reason being (and someone correct me on this) is that the API changed slightly.  somethings were deprecated, something were added, etc.  The reason that it didn't complain at compile time, is probably because the symbol doesn't get resolved until run time (ie dynamically linked).

I hope that my explanation is fairly close to accurate.  Is there a major reason for not upgrading your libc?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.31.0208271528090.24002-100000@lorien.wv.mentorg.com>

First thing to check is this:
cat /proc/scsi/scsi
This should show something like this:
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
  Vendor: Yamaha  Model: ...
Host: scsi1 .....

You should see one "Host" for the actual SCSI controller, one for iscsi,
and if you use ide-scsi for your ide CD, one more for that.
And you should see all devices on all SCSI hosts, including the CDRW.

If you don't see that, your controller or your CD were not recognized.

If you see that, the next step is to do
cdrecord --scanbus

Now you should see something like this:
scsibus0:
   0,0,0     0) 'Yamaha ' ...
where the numbers are channel, ID, and LUN.

If you don't see this, there is a problem with the generic device driver,
sg. Check lsmod, you should see "sg" module loaded unless you compiled all
this stuff into the kernel. If you see the autput like above, cdrecord
should work for burning the CDs, using the 3 numbers it gave you for the
CDRW.

You should also have the sr_mod module loaded, although usually its
autoload is triggered by trying to access the device. So now you actually
need to know the device. It will be /dev/scd0 or scd1, depending on which
CD is first. When you did cat /proc/scsi/scsi, you can just count them
from the top, the first CD is scd0, and so on. But you need those modules
loaded to access the device. Try to load everything manually first:
modprobe sr_mod sg
then if it works, add this to your modules.conf:
alias scsi_hostadapter <scsi>
alias scd0 sr_mod                    # load sr_mod upon access of scd0
pre-install sg     modprobe <scsi>   # load <scsi> before sg
pre-install sr_mod modprobe <scsi>   # load aic7xxx before sr_mod

where <scsi> it the module for your SCSI card.
If you have more than one SCSI CD (in your case it means if your ide CD is
on ide-scsi), you need to give some thought to the order. It'll be scd0 or
scd1 above, and you need to decide what you want to load first, ide-scsi
or scsi (and if you use initrd to load scsi modules, or some of it is
compiled into the kernel, you may not have a choice, go with whatever
order you end up with).

I'm clueless.  I would like to know for future reference how to debug
this.  It would be a very useful skill I imagine.

I think someone already recommended one tool that probably already checked
this, but what about LIB_DIR and LDPATH (I'm not at a linux box so I can't
be sure I typed those correctly, use env in bash to print out all of your
enviroment strings.).  You may need to change something in the enviroment.

Of course, my disclaimer here is that I don't know what is going on.  But
I would like to learn how to fix this as well, and so I am just suggesting
things I would try inorder to learn more...

I think the thread said that gcc 3.2 had issues, so I would bet you're
fine.

Wish I could help.  Let me know if you solve the problem.

My wife is considering taking a job in Corvallis. I'm trying to find out
what I would be able to do if I moved there. So as part of that it would
be nice to talk to someone from Corvallis or talk to people on a mailing
list or something from the LUG there. Partly to get a feel for whether or
not there are Linux jobs there, or what the tech market there looks like
in general.

Anyone have any idea? I tried looking up the lugs online and emailing a
couple people, but those emails bounced.

  Yup. It's in a shared lib.

Jason,

  I searched on google for this symbol name and found a bunch of programs
that broke with the same load error. Apparently the API changed between
libc-2.1 and -2.2; the latter is what's needed.

  The OS upgrade is scheduled for tomorrow morning.

Thanks,

Rich

This seemed to do the trick. The Yamaha drive is now recognized
properly, and (as Fedor mentioned) "cdrecord -scanbus" now reports
it properly. CDPlayer comes up as soon as I put something in the
drive and tries to read it (which is NOT what I expected or wanted,
since I'm trying to use it for data :-) But I assume I can figure
out how to turn that off. 

Do you know where the documenation is for "iscsi".  My system
doesn't have a man page for it, and I'm curious what it is.

iscsi is scsi over IP.
Normally it should not affect you, other than it might change the number
of scsi host, what was scsi0 can become scsi1 for example.
If you need iscsi but must have real scsi loaded first, you can ensure
it.
The reason CDPlayer comes up is probably because you use Gnome or KDE or
something similar which thinks it knows better what's good for you, so it
runs the autostarter in background. The autostarter is typically broken,
so it brings up CDPlayer on data CDs, or keeps polling audio CDs after you
start playing them, killing play every 5 seconds, or does something else
like that.
Under Gnome it's called "magicdev". Under KDE, I thinks it's "autorun".
Every now and then I have to troubleshoot someone's PC where CD does not
work. I begin by uninstalling magicdev and the other one. Usually this
concludes the troubleshooting process.

Thanks. I suspected something like that, but I didn't know the
details. I'll take a look at "magicdev". You've probably saved 
me AT LEAST an hour of just trying to figure out what was doing it!

Thanks again,

-Mike

PS.. I have no idea why I even use Gnome. All I do is end up
opening xterms and typing commands in them :-)

The first thing to do is look at the apache logfile, and see what it 
says when that script is run. Could be permissions, or the apache on 
your system may not be configured to run files with the .pl extension. 
-OR- you may have the file in the wrong place. I'm sure there are other 
possibilities too.

The apache log will reveal more information about what's going on.

Since you provided so little detail, I am not sure this question is
valid, but what did you get when you ran it from the command line.  My
guess is that you don't have one of the Perl modules installed.  The
error message from the command line will tell you for sure.

It sounds like you've got two things going against you.  The first is that 
the GNU C++ libraries are in a little more flux than the C libraries and 
there were incompatibilites between several of the versions in the last 
couple of years.  Second, 2.96.X was a compiler that the GNU GCC team said 
should not be used, but RH did anyway.  Not sure why.  It generates 
binaries that are not compatible with binaries from other versions.  So If 
you've got a mixed system with old C++ libraries that were made with GCC 
2.95.X and code you've compiled with GCC (g++) 2.96.Y, you are probably 
going to have problems.

Dynamic cast is a newish C++ feature.  I am somewhat shocked that it would 
be implemented as a named function rather than being inlined directly in 
place.  Weird.  My guess is that GCC/G++ 2.96 supports dynamic cast and 
the old library doesn't.  

I believe there are compiler flags that will turn off support for this 
stuff, but you'd probably have to change code then.  It is harder to keep 
binary compatibility with C++ libraries than C libraries in general.

Best,
Kyle

Sounds like the #! line of the script is pointing to a place that is
different than where your perl interpreter is actually located.  If this
is the case, you can change the line or put a sym link in its place
pointing to the place you do actually keep it.

Billy,

The pflogsumm.pl is the Postfix log summarizer. My understanding is that
isn't a CGI script to be run via mod_perl on your web server. Just log in
as root and:

% perl /path/to/pflogsumm.pl /var/log/maillog

It has a few other options, but I'd consult the docs; conveniently, they
are embedded in the code as comments.

% perl /path/to/pflogsumm.pl --help

may elucidate as well. I run this out of cron to get a handle on the
previous day's mail usage. Enjoy,

Step 1:

type 
	file /var/www/cgi-bin/pflogusmm.pl

It should tell you something like 
pflogusmm.pl: perl script text executable

If this is true then type 

which perl
You might get something like

/usr/bin/perl

Now edit the file pflogusmm.pl with your handy editor like vim, pico, emacs, 
joe, gedit (whatever)

On the first line might be something like

#!/usr/local/bin/perl

If so change the /usr/local/bin/perl part so that it matches the output of 
which perl command you ran above

like

#!/usr/bin/perl

Save the file, and see if this works.

Sean

If you have a way to remotely login in your machine you could probably 
just kill X and then you could go back and login again. I have managed 
to lockup X once in a while and have telnet'ed in and then killed the X 
process. The rest of the system was still running fine but in my case 
my X process seems to get stuck in some loop and starts consuming 80% 
or more of the CPU time and my entire desktop is frozen.

This sounds as if you are asking the same question in a new thread. 

What is the deal?

Can you enlighten us about what you have tried so far, what has worked,
what has failed?

It's not hung, it's just busy loading up all the cool shit they bloated
mozilla with. Give it a few hours, it'll come back :)

No, it probably won't.
Check system logs, they may have some messages from just before the
freeze. But if you just reset the machine, they may not.
Try this: before calling mozilla, go to a text
console (Ctrl-F1), log in as root, start tail -f /var/log/messages there.

Then, go back to X, start mozilla, and immediately go back to text. If you
can do it before mozilla freeses X, you'll be watching the system log as
it scrolls by. May be mozilla does not freeze everything, only X, then you
won't notice anything wrong. Until you switch to X, that is :)

In any event, I'd suspect video drivers, especially if everything locks
up not just X. You did not mention what video
card you use, and what drivers? Some AGP video cards like to do this kind
of stuff on some motherboards, you can try disabling AGP (set AGP page
size to below 32M and it's disabled in your BIOS). With closed-source
NVidia drivers, you can disable AGP from software too, other drivers may
have this option.

ok, check this out....what are the permissions of the file? 755? it

may apply.... 


the first line in /var/www/cgi-bin/pflogsumm.pl.... the shebang line, 
it probably says something like #!/usr/local/bin/perl.....or something
to that
extent....does that point to your perl executable? what is the first
line of the perl script?  does the perl script print a "Content-Type:

if these points have already been covered, please excuse my

It has been my feeling for a while now that because C++ is OOP, it causes
people to think about the design longer, causing people to write a better
design, but because the langauge is more complex than most programmers are
used to, it can lead to very complicated, hard to maintain code.  If you
screw up in the implementation (ie. in c you have a buffer over flow) then
you have shot your foot.  But if you screw up the design (ie. in c++ you
misuse a language feature to express some OO concept) then it can have far
reaching consequences down the line.  I know C++ has many improvements
over C, and it really does help conceptualize some problems, but it is a
VERY complex langauge that allows you to do many things you shouldn't be
doing...And you can create bugs which "don't make sense"...

Many times, simple is better and less is more.  Not saying c++ is a waste
of time, I just wish it wasn't so complex.

Google is your friend and RTFM.

"Running Linux" by Matt Welsh et al is very good, and the manuals for your 
distribution. All of Red Hat's manuals are available online, if you don't

I thought some of you might be interested in this. I'll be interested 
to see how the new dependency tracking/suggestion stuff works out.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Date: Tue, 27 Aug 2002 19:00:34 -0400
From: Jeff Johnson <jbj at redhat.com>
Reply-To: rpm-list at redhat.com
To: rpm-list at redhat.com
Subject: Final test release of rpm-4.1 ...


There's a complete version of rpm-4.1-1.01 available for testing at

	ftp://ftp.rpm.org/pub/rpm/test-4.1

I've included source and binary packages compiled for all Red Hat platforms.
All the packages are signed with the BETA-GPG-KEY, also present at the
above URL.

AFAIK, this *is* rpm-4.1, but there's always something that needs fixing
at the last minute.

If you have the time to install and try out rpm-4.1, I'd appreciate any
bug reports at

	http://bugzilla.redhat.com

Here's a short summary (again) of features that have been added. See the
CHANGES file in the src rpm for more details.

1) Header signatures and digests can (if configured) be verified when
   retrieved from the rpm database. See /usr/lib/rpm/macros for comments
   about how to configure %_vsflags_install et al macros.

   Note: this is only mechanism, a better/configurable security policy
   is gonna be needed in rpm somewhen soon. Suggestions/patches/audits are
   very much appreciated.

2) The rpm database permits concurrent access. That means that it is now
   possible to run rpm in %post scriptlets.

   Note: What still remains is to find out whether there are deadlocks
   (there are), and whether the deadlocks can be avoided or otherwise
   handled gracefully. I'd really like to support (at least read)
   concurrent access to the rpm database, but it's gonna take a lot
   of careful (i.e. reproducible) testing to achieve that goal. Any
   and all help is appreciated. What's very promising is that the
   problems are deadlocks, not segfaults, but reproducing deadlocks
   is gonna be quite challenging.

3) The rpmdb-redhat package (which contains an "everything" rpm database),
   if installed, will be used to provide suggested solutions for unresolved
   dependencies. Try installing the rpmdb-redhat package from Raw Hide if
   interested.

4) /usr/lib/rpm/rpmcache has been added to the rpm-devel package. rpmcache
   can be used to create a custom rpm database to provide suggested solutions
   for unresolved dependencies. See rpmcache(8) for some hints about how to
   use.

5) /usr/bin/rpmgraph has been added to the rpm-devel package. rpmgrapgh
   will generate dependsnecy graphs of packages for display by graphwiz.
   See rpmgraph(8) for details. If nowhere else, there's a graphvix source
   rpm that can be compiled to display the output at
	ftp://people.redhat.com/jbj/graphviz-1.7.14-1.src.rpm

There are several goals in rpm-4.1:

1) new, header-only, digital signatures and digests for packages.

2) verifying header signatures/digests when the header is read.

3) replacing the internal representation of headers with smaller data
   structures to reduce memory footprint.

4) enriching and stabilizing the rpmlib API.

Both 3) and 4) are gonna be quite painful for developers, as the
entire rpmlib API has changed. What's good is that I can now expose
more of the internals of rpmlib more or less opaquely.

What's bad is that everything has changed. I'll be happy to answer questions
or help with porting (assuming time available) as needed.

Below is a short description of the signature changes.
==========================================================================
DSA/RSA signature verification using RFC-2440 OpenPGP V3
packets is now implemented directly in rpm. The signature,
if available, is always verified when reading a package, and failures
are always reported.

Signing is done with gpg/pgp helpers as always, and both a new,
header-only, as well as the Good Old header+payload signature
are generated. In fact, all of Red Hat 7.3 was signed with rpm-4.1,
so both signatures should be present in 7.3 packages.

What's also new is pubkey management using --import. Basically
	rpm --import RPM-GPG-KEY
(or any ascii armored OpenPGP pubkey) will wrap the binary OpenPGP
packet in a header, and install much like any other package.

Here's what you see if you have not yet imported the correct pubkey(s):

bash$ sudo rpm -Uvh /B/7.3/rpm/4.0.4-7x.18/i386/*
warning: /B/7.3/rpm/4.0.4-7x.18/i386/popt-1.6.4-7x.18.i386.rpm: Header V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID db42a60e
...

Here's what the Red Hat pubkeys look like when imported:
==========================================================================
bash$ rpm -qa | grep pubkey
gpg-pubkey-0352860f-3c3cb5e4
gpg-pubkey-db42a60e-37ea5438

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
==========================================================================

For the extremely security conscious and the overly curious, I note the
following limitations:

	1) there's no attempt (yet) to verify the signature on the
	pubkey before verifying the package signature.

	2) there's no attempt (yet) to implement any trust model using
	OpenPGP packets. All imported keys are considered trusted.

	3) only V3 signatures are implemented ATM.

If that's not to your taste, then you can export the signature from a
package and verify using gpg outside of rpm. For example, here's a
short script that verifies good old header+payload signatures of
a package using gpg:

==========================================================================
#!/bin/sh

for pkg in $*
do
    if [ "$pkg" = "" -o ! -e "$pkg" ]; then
	echo "no package supplied" 1>&2
	exit 1
    fi

    plaintext=`mktemp $0-$$.XXXXXX`
    detached=`mktemp $0-$$.XXXXXX`

# --- Extract detached signature
    rpm -qp -vv --qf '%{siggpg:armor}' $pkg > $detached

# --- Figger the offset of header+payload in the package
    leadsize=96
    o=`expr $leadsize + 8`

    set `od -j $o -N 8 -t u1 $pkg`
    il=`expr 256 \* \( 256 \* \( 256 \* $2 + $3 \) + $4 \) + $5`
    dl=`expr 256 \* \( 256 \* \( 256 \* $6 + $7 \) + $8 \) + $9`

    sigsize=`expr 8 + 16 \* $il + $dl`
    o=`expr $o + $sigsize + \( 8 - \( $sigsize \% 8 \) \) \% 8`

# --- Extract header+payload
    dd if=$pkg ibs=$o skip=1 2>/dev/null > $plaintext

# --- Verify DSA signature using gpg
    gpg --batch -vv --debug 0xfc02 --verify $detached $plaintext

# --- Clean up
    rm -f $detached $plaintext
done

My first troubleshooting suggestion would be to tar up ~/.netscape/ 
and ~/.mozilla/ and save them out of the way, delete the original 
directories, and then restart mozilla.

If it works properly, then it's a configuration error (though it 
leaves unanswered the question about how mozilla could lock up a 
machine in the first place).

Otherwise, I'm fairly stumped. I'd probably start with mozilla.org's 
bugzilla database, looking to see if there are known problems with 
your video card/driver.

As I said before, pflogsumm.pl is not a cgi script to be run out of a 
browser. Run it from a terminal as root, and I'll bet you'll be in business.

Carla was on the right track. Start w/ the basics. Think about getting a 
book (O'reilly's Running Linux?) or finding some things on the web to 
get you started, particularly w/ file ownership/permissions issues. Use 
Google frequently. Do a little more experimenting. Lather, rinse, repeat.

http://www.tldp.org/ has some good docs on a variety of topics.

Thanks Tony and Fedor. I'll try the term window strategy and the tenet from my 
wife's machine if I'm not quick enough getting back to the term. BTW it is a 
Voodoo3 3000 AGP on a Soyo K7VTA-B motherboard. I just had to remove a 64M 
mem chip to return as it wouldn't let me install anything but Debian and then 
I couldn't get X to run in Deb. PC Boost is replacing the chip which I bought

Here is a brief section from the introductory chapter of _On Lisp:
Advanced Techniques for Common Lisp_ by Paul Graham, now out-of-print
but the copyright has been recovered by the author and it is now
available online at <http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html>, from
Section 1.1 Design by Evolution:

  [...] And if you're not sure yet what kind of program you're
  writing, it's a safe bet to write it in Lisp. Whatever kind of
  program yours turns out to be, Lisp will, during the writing of it,
  have evolved into a language for writing _that_ kind of program.

  If you're not sure yet what kind of program you're writing? To some
  ears that sentence has an odd ring to it. It is in jarring contrast
  with a certain model of doing things wherein you (1) carefully plan
  what you're going to do, and then (2) do it. According to this
  model, if Lisp encourages you to start writing your program before
  you ve decided how it should work, it merely encourages sloppy
  thinking.

  Well, it just ain't so. The plan-and-implement method may have been
  a good way of building dams or launching invasions, but experience
  has not shown it to be as good a way of writing programs. Why?
  Perhaps it's because computers are so exacting. Perhaps there is
  more variation between programs than there is between dams or
  invasions. Or perhaps the old methods don't work because old
  concepts of redundancy have no analogue in software development: if
  a dam contains 30% too much concrete, that's a margin for error, but
  if a program does 30% too much work, that _is_ an error.

  It may be difficult to say why the old method fails, but that it
  does fail, anyone can see. When is software delivered on time?
  Experienced programmers know that no matter how carefully you plan a
  program, when you write it the plans will turn out to be imperfect
  in some way. Sometimes the plans will be hopelessly wrong. Yet few
  of the victims of the plan-and-implement method question its basic
  soundness. Instead they blame human failings: if only the plans had
  been made with more foresight, all this trouble could have been
  avoided. Since even the very best programmers run into problems when
  they turn to implementation, perhaps it's too much to hope that
  people will ever have that much foresight. Perhaps the
  plan-and-implement method could be replaced with another approach
  which better suits our limitations.

For another introductory look at Lisp, see the recent document:

Thanks Rich.  I looked at this many years ago (well at least a few years) 
and it was a pain to install.  Found an RPM for my RHL release and away I 
went.  I'll get back to REALLY using my PalmPilot now.

Message-ID: <3D6CF0F5.8060508@sun.com>

I just wanted to share my first experience with the Knoppix CD.

I downloaded the .iso last night, and got my ide cd-burner working in 
the same timeframe.  My first test cd happened to be the Knoppix ISO, 
and it worked perfectly.  Yay for that!

Since my machine already had linux on it, I decided to traipse 
downstairs and see how it would work on the wife's laptop.  After 
futzing with the bios to make sure it would boot from the CDROM first, 
Knoppix came right up, detected *everything* on the machine (even the 
wireless network card!) and sat there looking pretty spiffy right from 
the get-go.

Let me just say that I am mightily impressed.  That is _the_ slickest CD 
I have ever had the pleasure of booting.

Now, if it only had a 'clone this cd to the first available hard disk' 
option.  ;)

I sent the disc with my wife to try out on her work machine today.  I 
want to see if she can do her Word/Excel/etc stuff via Knoppix instead 
of using M$ stuff.  If I can wean her from it even a little bit, I'll 
consider my life complete.  ;)

  Glad you like it. I found it when Judd released it and have been using it
ever since. I sent him $20 to say "thank you" because it's so darn useful to

Thanks Russ, that was cool.  I use lisp whenever I can actually.  I took a
class about AI and we used lisp for everything.  Quite useful, and quite
good at evolutionary design.  Have  you seen haskell?  It has some cool
features too, and in someways (a lot of ways) should be considered the
lisp of the future.

The reason I use c and c++ is because they are so widely used and so well
known.  I figure if I ever work as a programmer, I will need to be
experienced at c/c++ above all else.

You might also want to try coldsync.  It has the advantage that it can be
used from the command line (ie. you can put it in a script or cron).  I
haven't got it to work for my palm m130 yet (I think coldsync is the only
one that supports the m130), but I don't see any real reason to bother.
I figure by the time I care, the support for the m130 should be ready :)

<snipped stuff about Lisp's flexibility>

Lisp isn't the only language that gives you this kind of flexibility, in
general you can say the same about dynamic languages as a class of
languages - you could say similar things about SmallTalk or Ruby for
example.

The previous poster is right, you have to be a lot more careful about the
up front design in C++ because it'll be a lot harder to change the
architecure later.  As an analogy you can think of working with C++ like
sculpting in marble and working with the dynamic langauages like sculpting
in modeling clay.  Some might argue that having to pay more attention to
your design up front is a good thing that C++ forces you to do.  Others
(in the agile design camp) will argue that you can never forsee all of the
requirements upfront and it's best to just consider change a part of
reality and get used to it.

  Hehehe! My son received his degree in CS and thought the same thing. Ended
up working for the banking and insurance industries writing an maintaining

  You'll probably end up supporting VB. :-)

Subject: [PLUG] Undelete
Message-ID: <20020828162730.GA18547@boora.com>

OK, so a coworker deleted a file of spamassassin rules.  Since it's the
only linux box in the office it isn't backed up at the moment and she
wondered if it's possible to undelete.  A quick search revealed that mc
has an undelete command and debian offers a "recover" package.  The mc
option seems easiest.  But I don't know for sure.

But I'm having trouble following directions for mc.  The man page says I
need to ch to /#undel/hda2.  But it doesn't exist. I also read that I
need to unmount the filesystem first.  Right now mc is still "loading
deleted inode information" so perhaps that directory will exist when it
is done.  But about unmounting.  This machine serves as our ftp site and
all our incoming mail goes through here to be cleansed by spamassassin
before going on to exchange.  If I need to unmount /dev/hda2:  Will these
services be disabled till I mount again?  How do I browse the directory
for deleted files?  How exactly do I perform the whole unmount/mount on
the main filessytem?  It is the only one besides the swap partition.
I'm a little nervous cause it could wreak havoc.

Any other advice?

I'm in the process of loading Debian on one of my machines. I'm in the
Configuring Mozilla-browser phase. I don't know if this will shed any
light on your problem, but here's what they say on this screen:

Sometimes mozilla hangs since plugins (e.g. flashplugin) lock /dev/dsp.
You can use dsp wrapper to resolve it. 'auto' will decide which dsp
wrappers should b used according to the sound daemon running. When no
sound daemon is detected, mozilla won't use any wrapper. This setting
will be saved into /etc/mozilla/mozillarc and can be overridden with
your ~/.mozillarc.

Subject: [PLUG] NFS mounting cdrom from Linux to Solaris
Message-ID: <20020828165543.GA32718@rauhaus.org>

I have an odd problem with cdrom volumes nfs mounted from a Linux box on
to a Solaris box. Occaisionally files, directories, and even the entire
volume will dissappear temporarily from the nfs mounted partition.

I thought it might have to do with the way Linux does either caching or
handles spinning up and spinning down the cdrom drive, so while I needed
to access the nfs mount on the Solaris machine, I've tried keeping the
drive in use on the Linux side:

cd /cdrom
while true; do
	ls -lR .
	sleep 30
done

But even that hasn't completely made this problem go away. Any magic
switches, either for mounting the cdrom volume on the Linux box, or nfs
mounting it elsewhere, that might help?

Thanks,

Make certain you are running the latest versions of all the nfs stuff.

I occasionally mount my cdrom from a Solaris 8 box, but I haven't
encountered the problem you are describing.

Hi, PLUG users.  I'm a newbie to the list and Linux in general.

I'm running RedHat 7.3 and I have a question about Wine.  When I
navigate to my Windows directory on my other drive, I tried as a test
to run notepad.exe.  But I get this error:

[Solrazor at dhcppc1 hda1]$ cd windows
[Solrazor at dhcppc1 windows]$ wine notepad.exe
X Error of failed request:  XF86DGANoDirectVideoMode

  Serial number of failed request:  182
  Current serial number in output stream:  182
[Solrazor at dhcppc1 windows]$

The card in question is a Real3D Starfighter AGP with 8 megs of
video RAM.  It's actually made by Intel and is back from the 3DFX
era (coincidentaly, there is also a Diamond Monster 3D II Voodoo 2
card in here).  I believe the card made be causing a separate problem
with color palletes.  At that XF86 site, I couldn't find anything written
about it.

What does this mean and what do I need to do to resolve it?
A search on Google of this error didn't turn up anything useful. :\

Having worked on large C++ projects and had a hand maintaining C++ code 
over the years I would have to agree. I've seen horrible things done in 
C++ that made it very difficult to maintain and even debug a system. 
I've been doing more Java work recently and I'm sort of wondering where 
things are going to go. I see J2EE being very big using Java and Java 
being much less complicated that C++ avoids many of the pitfalls I've 
seen in C++ projects. I see Microsoft's .NET initiative where they're 
toting C# and so wonder where C++ is going these days since much of the 
trend is towards these sort of interpretive virtual machine 
environments.

The one thing that I've found with Java is that on even large projects 
we've had fewer problems and better stability much more rapidly than 
what I've seen on C++ projects. I was involved with a "alpha/demo" 
release of a Java product that was installed at a customer's site and 
it ran for many months without any major problems. I don't think 
something like that would have been so easy with C++ even through the 
team doing the work had considerable experience with large C++ 
development projects.

Certainly Java performed rather sluggishly on older systems that were 
slower but I've worked on some rather complicated Swing/AWT based GUIs 
and when running Java applications on a 1+ GHz clocked machine the 
performance appeared as smooth as a natively written application. I got 
the same comment from the analysts and users that were involved with 
the project as well so it wasn't something I was smokin or anything. :)

GRUMP! I want to look at the Knoppix CD but can't get connected to their
site.  I've tried, both Galeon and Netscape and even lynx.  The main
site www.knoppix.org is (as far as I can tell) just a redirect to

timeout.

Is this site up reliably and I'm just in a black hole?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0208281653020.925-100000@petrol.whirlycott.com>

(I hope this is to the right list, if not I apologize.)

The Nelsonville, Ohio, Public Library has recently announced that they
will be migrating to Koha, a GPL'd library software system
(<http://www.koha.org>) which is written in Perl.  They have decided to
contribute to the ongoing development of Koha and have released an
RFP to solicit bids to work on full MARC support for the 1.4 release,
the RFP is available at
<http://pate.eylerfamily.org/geek/MARCRFP.txt> (a copy is also
included below).

I'd encourage interested parties to read carefully through the RFP and
to join the koha-devel mailing list
(<http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/koha-devel>).  It may
also be worthwhile to join the #koha channel at irc.katipo.co.nz to
discuss the project in general or MARC support specifically.  If you
know anyone else that might be interested in responding to the RFP,
please feel free to forward it as appropriate.

Further background on Nelsonville's announcement is at
<http://www.linuxpr.com/releases/5053.html>.  For more information,
please feel free to contact me by email at info at koha.org.

thanks,

REQUEST For PROPOSAL -- MARC 21 record support for Koha (www.koha.org)

The Nelsonville Public Library invites all interested parties to
submit proposals in response to the following request.  Proposals may
be submitted in any format, but should carefully answer all questions
in the request.  Proposals should be sent to Stephen Hedges, Director,
Nelsonville Public Library, e-mail nelpl at athenscounty.lib.oh.us, fax
740-753-3543, mail 95 W. Washington Street, Nelsonville, Ohio 45764.
Proposals are due no later than 8:00 A.M. Eastern Daylight Time,
September 30, 2002.  Any responses made in proposals from interested
parties may be incorporated as part of a final agreement.

BACKGROUND
The Nelsonville Public Library is a public library system consisting
of seven libraries serving the residents of Athens County, Ohio, USA,
with 36,000 active borrowers and over 250,000 items in the
collections.  The library has made plans to switch from its current
library automation system to Koha, but only if Koha has certain
required capabilities.  Among these is the ability to store and
retrieve item records in MARC 21 format at the (Full) National Record
Level.

Accordingly, the Library is seeking proposals from parties who are
capable of modifying the current Koha code to provide this capability.
Proposals will be evaluated by a committee of five Library staff
members, and a contract will be negotiated with the submitter of the
successful proposal.

Please note that the Nelsonville Public Library does not expect to
fund the entire development process, but is instead offering a
financial reward to encourage development of Koha to be able to handle
MARC 21 format.  Nelsonville Public Library may elect to share some of
this financial burden with other agencies as it sees fit.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Nelsonville Public Library realizes that several people/groups may
wish to combine resources to fulfill the requirements of this RFP.
The Library is aware of the special nature of Open Source software
projects, which encourages wide participation in the development
process, and is thus amenable to proposals which divide the work
between parties.  In such a case, however, the Library prefers to
receive only one combined proposal, with payment going to only one
person or organization.  If no acceptable combined proposal is
received, then the library will entertain partial proposals from
several persons or organizations that can demonstrate a plan to
coordinate their efforts toward achieving the intended goal.

SELECTION CRITERA
Proposals will be evaluated on the basis of cost, qualifications of
the programmer(s), time to delivery, ease of integration of the
proposed code into the current Koha software, and ease of upgrading
the delivered software to incorporate future changes to the MARC
formats.

The Library also intends to share information from proposals with the
current Koha development team, in order to better judge the
compatibility of the proposals with the overall Koha development
plan.

REQUIRED INFORMATION
- How will you modify current Koha tables and/or scripts to accomodate
MARC 21 National (Full) Level Record Requirements?  (See
http://lcweb.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/nlr/).  Please provide enough
detail so that the committee may judge the viability of your plan, but
do not submit sample tables and/or scripts.
- Who will undertake this work?
- What are the qualifications of the person(s) doing this work?
- How have you been involved in previous Koha development?
- How long will it take to complete this work?
- How much will you charge for this work? (in US Dollars, please)
- How will you coordinate your work with the existing work on MARC for
the 1.4 release of Koha?

I've never had a problem with the site, and it doesn't appear to be
redirecting when I use it.  By the way, I'd also like to toss in my 2
cents about Knoppix being great.  It's a great way to demo Linux for

Is it possible, given a main source file and a dyn. linked library to

so that the dyn. library does not need to be
present at exec. time?

And I'll be snarky enough to add that if you don't have a grasp of
even the very basics of Unix/Linux usage (as your posts seem to
indicate), then you certainly shouldn't be attempting to set up
and administer Internet-connected servers (hopefully yours are
internal only).

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.44.0208281731340.18548-100000@silver.CS.ORST.EDU>

Can anyone reccomend a pcmcia storage device, preferrably solidstate? A
pcmcia compact-flash reader would do it, but I would like to hear some
success stories under linux before splurging on one.

It would be nice to have a large ammount of storage, 512mb would be a nice
number, but 128mb might do it, I suppose a few gigs would be prefferable
( I doubt compact flash will go that high, other options? USB is not a
good alternative in this situation.)

The purpose is for flight logging of an unmaned autonomous(sp?) craft.

Thanks!

In my experience, it just works. I've had no difficulty getting the
kernel to recognize CF cards via a PCMCIA adapter under either RedHat or
Debian. On my ancient P166 laptop, they're seen as /dev/hdc.

The Portland State Aerospace Society (a rocketry group) uses a 128MB CF
card for the root filesystem of the Linux-driven flight computer. Check
out <http://twiki.psas.pdx.edu/twiki/bin/view/PSAS/LvTwoCompactFlash>
for more details. The lead FC developer is here on the PLUG list (say
hello, James!). Perhaps he'll chime in with real details.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0208282030030.29256-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  It seems to me that previous Red Hat upgrades kept the configuration
options in a file so that all packages to be upgraded/installed need not be
re-selected if the upgrade was aborted and restarted. But, selecting
'upgrade' on the RH 7.3 cdrom #1 makes me select the packages each time.

  While my expert help today was absolutely invaluable, there was just one
problem after another. Imagine, 500M free in /usr was not sufficient for the
upgrade! I certainly got a thorough education in the use of parted to resize
and move partitions. A great tool, but it was too bad we needed to use it.

  Anyhow, I gave up for the evening when the cdrom had a corrupted file that
wouldn't install. Tomorrow is another day and the contest continues. Is it
only the kernel sources that permit 'make config' and let you use the same
options time and again? It would sure save a ton of time if I didn't need to
reselect the packages for a fourth time but could use a saved configuration
file.

Thanks,

Rich

I don't think it did that, if the upgrade is restarted you do it from
scratch. But it does know what you currently have, and a typical upgrade
will just take the list of installed packages and upgrade them, so you
should not have to select anything as a part of the upgrade.
If you want to change your system configuration significantly, do it after
the upgrade. Aftermy upgrades, I used to go through the upgrade log, see
what packages I have, remove those I don't really want, check
configuration files it updated, and did other cruft removal (there is
nothing in the upgrade process itself which makes it necessary or any
easier than at any other time, but since I was already doing maintenance,
it looked like a sensible occasion).

However, I have to say that after RH7.1 I stopped using upgrades at all.
I now use apt-rpm to upgrade all myu RedHat boxes. Get it from
http://apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org/ or from freshrpm's, edit the sources file,
you can add your RH7.3 CDs to the "repository" (it has a command for
that), and upgrade away.

Subject: [PLUG] First Time Debian Install
Message-ID: <3D6D9FBB.53FC9434@attbi.com>

I started installing Debian via the Internet (cable connection) on
Monday. As someone mentioned, I could have left a chicken in charge of
most of it since it primarily consisted of hitting the Enter key. The
process did take a long time, though. The installation continued through
all of yesterday and probably a good part of last night. This morning it
was waiting for me to tell it to continue. It finished before lunch
time.

When I logged in for the first time, it was from an 80 x 25 terminal
screen. I ran startx and found myself looking at KDE, even though that
wasn't what I checked during the installation. I had some things I
needed to do with Windows, so I tried to log out and halt Linux. I'm
used to the logout options provided by Red Hat 7.0 and 7.1, which
include halt. Halt was not an option. I wondered if I had to be logged
in as root in order to halt, so I tried to log in as root. I was
informed that logging in as root is not allowed from that screen! So, I
logged back in as an ordinary user, su'd and ran halt. That mostly
worked. Everything shut down, and I got "Power down." on the monitor,
but the machine never powered down.

Lilo happily allowed me to start up Windows. I did what I needed to do,
and rebooted into Linux. This time, I was given a Gnome login screen,
and it was Gnome into which I was put. Again though, no option to halt.
I guess I've got some more reading to do. (Actually, I know I've got a
lot of reading to do.)

There are a number of things that are not the same as what I've come to
expect when I start up either of my other two RH systems. I suppose some
of that is configuration related and some of it is convention related.
But, this is intended to be a learning experience, so time to start
reading.

Any recommendations for things to read that will help me understand what
I should expect (regarding the difference between the way things look on
Debian vs RH) other than everything on the debian site?

Lol, I love the way you phrased that.  I should get a stuffed chicken and
use that at work to signal to people that I am "working" on their computer
and that I will be back when the install is finished :)  Or maybe even a
rubber chicken, because when I'm trouble shooting I could swing it around
me head...

did you use tasksel, aptitude or dpkg?  Or did you pay attention? I didn't
the first couple times.  I guess I'm just suggesting that you may have
installed without realizing it, I haven't used the new installer, but the
2.2 installer was pretty good about only installing what you ask for.

I bet you need to change the kernel options.  Becareful with the kernel
options for power management, I have found a reproduceble bug with the
config scripts, where you enable a lot of the power management features,
save the config, load it up again and turn some of them off.  If the build
fails back up your config, make mrproper and then reload your config.  I
can get more detailed if you want.  I would fix it if I knew how...

HTH,

Subject: [PLUG] Advanced Topics Meeting on Netule - Follow up.
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0208290004450.11165-100000@sco302.DavidMandel.com>

This note is primarily for people who attended the Advanced Topics Meeting
last week.  I'm trying to get some feed back on things.

Also, I want to thank everyone.  You gave Dale and I a lot to
think about.  From my point of view, the meeting was very worth while.

(1)  Was the meeting location acceptable?
     I'm trying to get a feel for how much I want to use it
     for things like this in the future.  I know parking is tight
     in the neighborhood.

(2)  A couple people ask me to post my slides.
     I will post my slides on the net sometime next week.

(3)  The big question people had was, "Why should I help?
     What is in it for me?"
     This is a good question.  The theory is that if successful,
     it should lead to name recognition and consulting gigs.
     I certainly willing to talk to anyone about how to make
     this happen.

(4)  Several people proposed virtualizing the individual Netules
     using something like User Mode Linux.  We have considered
     this.  In fact, Karl Hegbloom has looked at this in detail.
     I even had a slide on this, but I didn't show it.

     I think Netules probably could be virtualized using UML,
     and there could be many many advantages to this.  This would
     isolate the Netules from the hardware, make the systems
     scale better, and make them easier to backup and replicate,
     and this is only the beginning of the advantages of using UML.
     Right now, time and resources are a concern.  If they weren't,
     I would definitely take this approach.  Indeed, one could
     consider the whole Netule project as a way of building root
     file systems for UML.

                                          Sincerely,
                                          David Mandel

So what do you Lisp lovers, students, and educators think of:

 <URL:http://www.teach-scheme.org/>
 <URL:http://www.drscheme.org/>

(DrScheme is also available through Debian; the one in "unstable"

I think they are right; that is, I agree with their arguements in
favor of Scheme as the programming language for introducing computer
programming.  C++ is way too complicated and only gets in the way.

IIRC, "dynamic cast" is part of a newer ISO C++ standard now supported
by GCC 3.2.  Am I right?

YMMV, but I would just log in as root and run "aptitude".  Then I
would search for the "kde" task package, open it, and select
everything under it for "purge".  Perhaps first I would run, from the
command line:

# aptitude markauto '~slibs'

... to ensure that it will auto uninstall most of the no-longer-used
libraries also.

To save a little more space, you might install the "apt-localepurge"
package, and configure it to purge all foreign language translations
that you are not ever going to use.

If you would like a Debian CD, just let me know, and I'll burn you
one.

First, when you finished the install and were given a console for login,
the init scripts installed by the recently configured packages had not
run, so certain first-time-run options hadn't yet taken effect.  When you
rebooted, the init script that fires up the display manager was run and
the display manager has a default session/window manager configured.

If you're using gdm, you will find that it's fairly easy to ensure that a
menu bar exists on the login screen that has a Shutdown and a Reboot
option.  I'm less familiar with xdm as a display manager.  You certainly
don't want Halt as a logout option from your X session as a regular user
and you probably don't want to run most session managers as root.  Best to
setup an .xinitrc in /root that runs a very simple window manager and
that's all for those very few times when you really must use X as root.

Good golly.  I think it's just time to start becoming familiar with each
package's configuration options instead of relying on some package
maintainer to select what they think you need.

I think perhaps it would be more appropriate to use one of those drinking
birds and let it just peck the enter key all through the install.

Why do you say that?  Certainly you would not want a remote console or
terminal for security reasons, but if I'm sitting at the connected
display, I'm probably within reach of the power and reset switches, or I
can just switch to the text console and give the three finger salute. 
The only thing one gains by not putting reboot and halt options on the
logout popup, is inconvinence.

  Thanks, Fedor. The reason I wouldn't be comfortable letting the installer
see what's there and doing its thing unmonitored is that certain critical --
or useful -- packages are not detected and marked for installation. And,
almost all KDE and Gnome packages _are_ marked for "upgrade" although
they're not on the system now. Makes no sense, but that's the way it is.

  I will certainly grab this and give it a shot. I'm now downloading another
copy of the disk 1 iso because the other one has an apparently corrupt
package that won't install. I _thought_ I had checked the md5 sum before
burning it onto a disk, but I must not have done so.

  Excellent advice that I will take.

After a successful Red Hat 7.3 installation, there'll be a file named 
/root/anaconda-ks.cfg that can be used to duplicate your installation. 
(Of course, then you'd have to learn about kickstarting a host, which 
takes a bit of time.)

Sadly, I don't know if there's any way to save a configuration 
mid-stream.

Paul,

  The boxes are set up differently here. For example, I do development work
on only one box so the other workstation and the notebook have fewer
packages installed.

  Ah, well. What I did discover is that the TUI (the "text" install option)
is faster than the GUI (default) option. Much quicker package
selection/deselection and faster running overall.

  One of the most important lessons I learned from Cooper is the value of
'parted' to edit partitions from within linux. It may not be quite as slick
as PartitionMagic, but it's free and it works.

  For whatever reason, /usr didn't have sufficient room. So through magic,
smoke and mirrors and several hours of waiting for the machine to do its
thing, punctuated by moments of blind panic when we thought we had lost a
partition or two, we shrunk /usr2 by 5G and added that space to /usr. A very
useful tool that I hope I don't need to use again. :-)

Many thanks,

Rich

How do I configure pine or mutt to flag folders when they contain new
mail? For example, I sort PLUG-related email into a plug mail folder under
pine, but I can't tell when that folder contains new mail without actually
opening it. This becomes tedious when dealing with many folders. Is there
a way to configure the client so it lists when new messages are there,
and (even better) how many new messages? ie:

plug(3)  spam(4)  foo-list(19)

Any ideas?

In pine, you add an incoming-folders directive to ~/.pinerc, e.g.,

incoming-folders="plug" mail/mailinglists/plug,
 	"spam" mail/spam,
	"foo-list" mail/mailinglists/foo-list

Then once you're done reading your inbox, just press the Tab key. pine 
will cycle through your incoming folders, giving you the option to 
visit them if they contain new messages.

I'm looking forward to the day when LVM or EVMS comes into common use.
When that happens, juggling partitions in this manner will be a thing of
the past.

In-Reply-To: <1030234291.32738.497.camel@lana.manymoons.net>
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0208290904390.11165-100000@sco302.DavidMandel.com>

    A training cooperative is an interesting idea, but I think it
would have to be a bit more involved than some of the postings
would lead one to believe.  Basically, I don't think one can do
an effective training cooperative without charging.  People need
to get paid for their facilities if they are used very much,
and the instructors should get something as well.  The truth is
it costs money to maintain space and equipment, and it generally
costs an instructor a bit of money just to teach a class.  On the
other hand, I don't think one needs to charge the sort of rates
most commercial training companies charge which seem to run from
$30 per student hour for low level classes and well over $50 per
student hour for higher level classes.  For example, PEAK in Corvallis
ran a pretty decent training program that charged $10 to $15 per
student hour for many years.  (They have since closed it.)

    As far as facilities,

    -  I would be willing and interested in using the area we
       used for the last Advanced Topics Meeting for a training
       cooperative if it made financial sense to me.

or

    -  I'm sure MicroSharp would be interested in some sort of
       an arrangement.  Potentially, they have space for multiple
       class rooms.  Unfortunately, they are in East Vancouver,
       but they are close to main roads.

    Likewise, I think we could make deals for furniture, white boards,
projectors, and so on.  Some of these would be pretty poor to start
with, but that is life.  (By the way, Allen Montgomery from Alliance
Internet Solutions is loaning PLUG a projector for four months.
It has some problems, but it is nice to have.)

    I guess, I think a good goal would be to charge $15/hr retail
with some sort of discount available so most "PLUG members" paid
about $10/hr.  This might be broken up as:

              $5/hr to any reseller who signed someone up.
                    (However, discount cards would be passed out at
                    PLUG meetings, so meeting attendees could sign
                    up without this fee.  Or something like this.
                    Also, the discounts would be available to other
                    Open Source Groups like the Eugene and Mid-Valley
                    Group.)
              $5/hr to the instructor.
              $5/hr for facilities and PLUG.
                    (most of this would go for things like paying for
                    broadband if it is at my house and equipment.
                    Maybe PLUG could eventually afford a projector.
                    Maybe PLUG could afford to get 501(c)3 status?)


    Ok, I'm a bit unsure about all the details, but this is the
general idea.  Is this something that would interest people?
Or is this a dumb idea?

I guess a lot of people were thinking that it should be free so that folks
who are out of work can afford it.  Most classes out there (like the two
or three day classes out at OGI) charge something like $2000 - there's
no way people who are not working can afford this.  They may have the
money, but since they don't know when they'll be working again they want
to save it. If it's cheap enough for people who have no current income,
then charging may make some sense.

Charging people for the class would place pressure on the teacher to
make it high quality. Since we don't have a lot of
time to dedicate towards teaching, this pressure might not be welcome.
Charging by the hour might also pressure the teacher to keep the class
under an hour and could discourage questions. Personally, I would also
feel discouraged from teaching subjects that I enjoy but am less
knowledgeable in.

So generally I would prefer a free class, both as teacher and student.

You're right, payment creates pressure, but at those rates I wouldn't feel much pressure as an instructor OR a 
student. Pay the instructor a couple of grand a day, and I'll expect a halftime show and an escalator. I'm for 
the form that David has proposed, it generates the needed capitol to make it run, without overly taxing those 
who have it to share (facilities, knowledge, hardware)

Count me in as a student.

Hello Linux folkz,
Does somebody know about any PCI GPIB cards 
which will reliably work with Linux?
I need to solve some equipment control problems at work.
Therefore I have to pick up the proper GPIB card with 
known protocol and existing Linux driver for it.
May be somebody could share his/her experience of using
GPIB interface with Linux.
Thank you very much in advance for any thoughts or sources 
of information.

We use National Instruments.  They come with Linux drivers, and
if you use Perl, then there are some great drivers that you can
use for data acquisition.  At work, we dual-booted our lab machine
to see if they worked, and that machine hasn't run Windows since.
We can even run experiments remotely from our desktops by logging
in via ssh.

Perhaps the teacher should decide on this, or simply accept donations

It also seems that this cost would be at least partially dependant on the
location and topic..

I would also prefer a free class, or if not possible, costs that fit the
expenses for that specific class.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.44.0208291430470.23738-100000@eel.ENGR.ORST.EDU>

I wanted to share a tip I learned, and then ask others if they have
similar tips they would like to share.

My tip is to use Galeon to browse the web, it seems faster than mozilla,
but supports the same things (I think they use embeded gecko or
something).  I have mine set so that when I middle click on a link it
opens in a new tab in the same window, but doesn't get focus.  This is
nice, because I can continue to read the page I'm on (works well when
searching with google), and when the tab turns blue (meaning it is loaded,
but unread) I can go look at it.  Galeon has another nice feature called
smart bookmarks.  I have google, google linux, and debian searchable
from the top of any galeon window.

My only complaint about Galeon is that sometimes when I launch it, it asks
if I want to restore my last session.  But I think I can turn that off.

Does anyone know of a good filter proxy for blocking banner ads and
pop-ups?  I just found one called Yet Another Filter Proxy (YAFP), but I
haven't had a chance to test it.

I'm interested to hear the advice of others.

Has anyone gotten so sick of web browsers that you use a script where wget
downloads the page, and they you convert it to ps and use ghostview? (The
thought has crossed my mind several times...)

In galeon you can go to the settings menu and uncheck "popups" and choose 
"load images from current server only". This should quiet it down quite a 
bit.

I'll give that a try, I don't allow pop-ups, but I had never thought about
the second option as a way to block banners.  There is a program I use at
work called proxomitron (great for windows users) that blocks the image if
the image has certian characteristics, such as shape and size.  This
catchs most if not all banners.  Proxomitron uses perl I believe, but I
don't know how one would port it to linux.  That is why I was considering
YAFP.  Perhaps I should contac the Proxomitron author and see if I can
convince him to use the gpl and make a linux port.

I'm using a combination junkbuster -> squid proxy at home.  Junkbuster 
is an opt-in filter, meaning you have to manually add the things you 
want to block.  However, most ad banner cgis and urls are pretty 
similar, and/or come from the same place, so only a few entries will 
catch 90% of the ads.

My wife likes to use IE under XP, so she doesn't have the option of 
turning off popups or other Bad(tm) things.  I have to do all that on 
the packet-pushing side.  Lucky me.

She DOES like how junkbuster can block out an ad and put in a custom 'ad 
blocked' page/image/url.  Keeps the page layout workable - some ad 
blockers replace the ad with a 1x1 .gif.

And some people stick their junkbuster block files out on the web so that
you can download them and get a healthy head start.

And since you also asked about mutt...

In your .muttrc, you designate which folders receive mail with the `mailboxes'
command...

   Linkname: The Mutt E-Mail Client: Configuration
        URL: http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/manual-3.html#ss3.11

Also of interest in this regard is `status_format'...
   
   Linkname: The Mutt E-Mail Client: Reference
        URL: http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/manual-6.html#status_format

...to control the information displayed on the status line of the index
menu.

It is a General Purpose Interface Bus.
HP has developed it a long time ago to operate 
with test and measurement equipment.
It has a protocol which is some what similar to USB. 
Initially it was named HPIB. 
When it has became an industry open standard, 
its name changed to GPIB.
Currently about 85% of test and measurement tools are
using GPIB protocol.
Hope this helps.

I'm trying out gnome after using KDE for a long time.  Gnome-terminal
differs from konsole in one big way.  When I edit a file in vim or use
mutt to view my mail, the text from the program stays on the screen
after I've terminated it.  In konsole, it just went away and you were
back to how you started.  Is this a feature?  How can I emulate konsole
behavior in gnome-terminal?

Not a proxy-based solution, but Mozilla users can look to should check out
BannerBlind. It filters based on banner size, with many presets available.
It did a semi-decent job w/ default settings, and could probably do much
better w/ a few custom sizes added.

I was shocked how clean the web looked afer using this for the first time.
More like the web of yore, before the dark times, before DoubleClick.

I never noticed the difference before... but you're right.

A regular console does the same thing (not resetting), this must be a
konsole feature.

You can run konsoles in gnome just fine by running konsole as if it were
any other application.  I like the gnome-terminals, though.  They're
what I use here in fluxbox and even when I'm in KDE or GNOME, which is
quite rare.

I'm not certian what you mean, and I don't have a konsole arround (so
mabey I shouldn't be answering this email...).  But, you could create an
alias that runs "clear" after vim or mutt.

That being said, I reccomend rxvt for a console, it is _very_ fast, and
as far as I can tell it has all the features of gnome-terminal.

  Has anyone mentioned junkbuster? We've been running it for a few years now
and it works _very_ well.

My recommendation is rxvt, or eterm (eterm's and aterms can be transparent
or translucent).  I used gnome terms for a long time, but I know prefer
rxvt.

I think the screen blanking can be set in your environment...check the
bash prompt howto, I know I have seen it somewhere, but I can't remember
where...is there a terminal howto?  Maybe that is where I saw it.

I think a couple people mentioned it, I don't think anyone here except
Randall Schwartz (sorry if I misspell it) has used YAFP.  I guess he
indirectly wrote the program.  The reason I was curious about it instead
of junkbuster is that YAFP claims to have a few features that junkbuster
lacks.  I do want something that can be setup as a proxy.  If it works
well then I'm going to set it up so that all http trafic on my network can
go through it.

I'll have to give both of them a try.  And maybe even borrow your config
files if that is ok.

One feature of gnome-terminal that I like is the ability to ctrl+click
or right click on a url and be able to open it in the browser.  Is there
a way to make rxvt do that?

I just highlight the link then go to galeon and middle click.  That causes
the URL to be loaded into the current galeon window.  I don't think rxvt
has a concept of web browsers.  Now I wonder how hard it would be to
implement that...

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0208291936120.1041-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Has anyone seen a situation where the presence of xfs and/or xfstt causes
the boot process to hang when trying to load these daemons?

  While it's not happened before today, it certainly became a major PITA all
of a sudden. (I was rebooting because I built the 2.4.19 kernel and tried to
boot with it as a test. Something's wronng with the installation of that
kernel, and it was when trying to boot with the old, 2.2.19 kernel, that it
started to hang.)

  Here's another wierd thing. During the POST check before booting, the
system reports that the floppy drive test fails. I press the F1 key to go on
and the floppy drive is perfectly usable. So, I've not thought too mauch
about it, especially as I don't reboot too often.

  Today, I commented out the nfs-mounted filesystems in /etc/fstab, and now
the floppy disk failure error does not appear during a boot! I have the X
font server problems, however, just to keep me on my toes.

  FWIW, trying to upgrade the other workstation (caddis, to those of you who
know of my network) to RH 7.3 kept failing when the upgrade program tried to
install 'chkconfig'. This happened twice, on two different medium brands,
but with the ISO from the same mirror source. Using yet another disk 1, from
a different ISO source, I specified to NOT upgrade 'chkconfig' and the
process ran to completion.

  But, packages I specifically excluded from upgrade -- the KDE and Gnome
packages -- were installed anyway! This is the most troublesome upgrade in
five years. I have expert consultation here, but it's an ongoing challenge.

Sigh,

Rich

Have you tried Opera?  It is very fast, and you can easily turn popups
on and off.  I have never used either of the proxies mentioned here, but
with Opera if you need a popup (because sites DO use them for legitimate
reasons) then they are easy to activate.

Of couse, it does not block banner ads, but then I have never had a
problem ignoring them.....

For some reason I  was thinking it was windows only, I'll have to sick
apt on it.  I remeber being more than impressed with the speed, but I
hated the MDI interface.  I'll have to give it another try.

With a good proxy you can save the bandwidth for the things you really
want to download.

David,

A distribution is more than the software.  A distribution needs to have also 
(in no particular order of importance and some points may be redundant):
1.  A viable mailing list for support, 
2.  Training for both the installers/supporters and users. 
3.  User community/target market.
4.  Documentation.
	Howtos
	Quick Step intallation instructions
	Detailed man pages
5.  Purpose or niche.
6.  Sponsor or support organization willing to organize the other points.
7.  Be fun to use. (Why not just work, to start with?)
8.  A unique mascot.(I can supply a picture of my dog with antlers)  87)

Does the font server have nfs mounts in its configuration?  I bet xfs is
hanging due to broken/hanging nfs mounts.

Message-ID: <000001c24fe3$dad5cb50$6401a8c0@robbert>

I'm having an issue upgrading Mozilla 1.1.  I downloaded the RPM from
Mozilla.org and tried doing an RPM -ivh mozilla-1.1-0.i386.rpm and get
the following

Error: failed dependencies:
	Mozilla-nspr = 1.1-0 is needed by mozilla-1.1-0

So I downloaded mozilla-nspr-1.1-0.i386.rpm and tried the same rpm
command on it.  I get the following error

Error: failed dependencies
	mozilla-nspr = 0.9.9-12.7.3 is needed by mozilla-0.9.9-12.7-3
	mozilla-nspr = 0.9.9-12.7.3 is needed by
mozilla-nspr-devel-0.9.9-12.7.3
	mozilla-nspr = 0.90.9.9-12.7.3 is needed by
mozilla-nss-0.9.9-12.7.3

I tried adding -U to do an upgrade, but got the same error.  Anyone out
there have an idea that I can use to upgrade Mozilla and deal with the
dependencies.  I'm guessing I'm missing a switch on the rpm command.

First, do a:

rpm -qa | grep mozilla

to see what mozilla packages you have installed.

Then d/l the updated ones to match. Followed by

rpm -Uvh mozilla*1.1-0.i386.rpm

That will match all of the mozilla rpms you d/l'ed that are v1.1-0 and
will update all of the mozilla rpms at once. If multiple packages are
dependant on each other, you have to upgrade them all at once, rather than
one at a time.

Sweet! That's one of the better tips I've gleaned off of this list.
Many thanks, Paul.

I would also share with you that I use the following in my .pinerc:
initial-keystroke-list=l,
    CR,
    ;,
    p,
    n

I'm not sure if there's a better way to do that, but essentially it hops
to the first entry in my folder group list (the ones that get incoming
mail), opens that group, then selects groups that contain new
messages.  That way, I get a little X next to the names of all the folders
that contain new mail.

> Now another question - I use vim in place of pico for my pine compose

That I don't know, but I have a related question:

On this list a while back, folks were describing how they use vim as their
editor from pine and are capable of doing more robust quote formatting
than pico handles by default.  This interest me immensely.  Can someone
share that info?

Thanks.

While we are on the topic of email clients, I started using mutt today (and enjoy it so far, I previously used pine).

One question though: I want to have mutt open my inbox with any new messages from the mail spool copied there automatically. 
It currently is opening my mail spool, then prompts me to copy read messages from the spool to mbox (which is not my inbox..). 

Any pointers would be great, I'm really not sure where to start to get this to happen (any search terms?).


Thanks,
Rogan

Galeon uses gecko. In fact, if you use a redhat system, it requires

I use the middle click part of mozilla too. It's slick.

Subject: [PLUG] 3ddesk, sawfish, hotkeys, Microsoft Natural Pro USB
Message-ID: <87fzww7qhm.fsf@bittersweet.intra.hegbloom.net>

Has anyone else discovered "3ddesk"?  <URL:http://desk3d.sourceforge.net/>

Here's what I've done with it...  It's really cool to switch desktops
with a hotkey and watch the OpenGL rendered "flip" from one screen to
the next.  It's almost as if the glass of the monitor spins around
pivots at the top and bottom center, flipping from one side to the
other to show a different virtual desktop.  I can push a different
hotkey and it stays in the 3ddesk mode, where the mouse wheel flips
from one to the next until I find the one I want, then I click the
wheel and there I am.  Works best on a fast computer, of course.

I've got one of those Microsoft Natural Pro USB keyboards that has the
extra buttons along the top of it (and two USB ports).  I installed
"hotkeys" so I can use those buttons, and wrote a keyboard definition
for it.  I've turned the "Back", "Forward", "Stop" and "Refresh"
buttons into controls for the "3ddesk".  I can also control XMMS and
the sound volume from the keyboard.

I've also written some simple hooks for the Sawfish window manager
that make 3ddesk work a lot more smoothly.  I've got 4 workspaces
configured, that are one screen or viewport each, but I think it would
work fine with other configurations.  In my "~/.sawfishrc" is:

8<------------------------------------------------------------>8
(defun 3ddesk ()
  (interactive)
  (system "3ddesk --mode=flip &"))

(defun 3ddesk-acquire ()
  (system "3ddesk --acquire &"))

(defun 3ddesk-acquirecurrent ()
  (system "(sleep 1 && 3ddesk --acquirecurrent)&"))

(add-hook 'enter-workspace-hook 3ddesk-acquirecurrent)
(add-hook 'add-to-workspace-hook 3ddesk-acquirecurrent)
(add-hook 'remove-from-workspace-hook 3ddesk-acquirecurrent)

(bind-keys global-keymap "W-Button2-Click" 3ddesk)

;; NO!  You'll regret it.
;; (add-hook 'workspace-state-change-hook 3ddesk-acquire)
8<------------------------------------------------------------>8

Placeing 3ddesk-acquirecurrent on those hooks makes it grab a snapshot
of the screen right after changing desktops, so that it always has a
reasonablely current picture of each virtual screen, even if I use the
Gnome pager to change screens.

I tried that, then typed pine and it loaded up, opened my INBOX and
prompted me:
Enter comma-delimited list of numbers (dash between ranges):
^G Help
^C Cancel    Ret Accept

I'm not sure what is going on.  Any ideas?

if I type my usual pine -i then it just ignores the above commands, is
that right?

Does anyone know if emacs has a feature for automatically doing word
wrap?  I want the functionality of M-q.  I have word wrap turned off
(for coding) and that may be the problem.  Is there a way I can pass
emacs a command line switch to turn on word wrap? That would be great
since I am expeirementing with emacs as my alternate editor in pine.

PS the frightening part is that emacs starts up much faster than vim!

Launch an "xterm" (a recent one, from XFree86 4), then hold down the
Ctrl key and hold down the middle mouse button.  You'll see a popup
menu, and down near the bottom of it, you'll see "Enable alternate
screen switching".  Try using "less" on something with and without
that menu item checked.

Now, look at the man page for "xterm" and the one for "terminfo",
searching the xterm page for the string "alternate screen" and the
terminfo one for "ca_mode"...  You'll see that there is a control
sequence that switches to an alternate screen, and another that
switches back.  There is a document that describes all of the xterm
control sequences in <URL:http://www.pdxlinux.org/doc/xterm/>.

I do not know how to make "gnome-terminal" behave that way, but do
know that "multi-gnome-terminal" does support the alternate screen.
Apparently "screen" does not have that "alternate screen" feature, at
least not with the termcap mine is using.

You installed a LOT of software if it took that long over a cable
connection!  It must be really loaded!

Perhaps the X Desktop Environment task pulled in KDE for you?  If you
"apt-get install aptitude", you can use "aptitude" to unload the stuff
you don't want.  Once again, I highly recommend it in preference to
"dselect" for package management.

I'm not sure what you are saying happened here, in that I don't know
what screen you are on when you try to log in as root.  You had run
"startx", but I don't know if you did that as "root" or as yourself.
When you use "startx" rather than an X login manager, you do not need
the "halt" option on a logout menu.  The "logout" there is to log out
of X, back to your text mode shell.  Once there, you can use
"Ctrl-Alt-DEL" or "halt" to shut down the computer.

I can't imagine why it would not allow you to log in as root from the
text console...  the X login managers do have configuration options to
disallow root logins, and are shipped with somewhat parnoid security
settings.  For "gdm", you must edit "/etc/gdm/gdm.conf", find the
"[Security]" section, and change "AllowRoot" to "true", then restart
"gdm" with "/etc/init.d/gdm restart".  After that, log into X as root,
and look in the "System" menu (underfoot) for the "GDM Configurator".
(For KDE's X login manager, log into X as root (IIRC it will let you
do so by default), and use the control center to configure the KDM.)

If you have more than one X login manager installed, you can switch
which one is run at boot with "dpkg-reconfigure gdm" or
"dpkg-reconfigure kdm".  You may also reconfigure your X Server the
same way: "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86", for instance.  Do this
as root from a text console with no X login manager running.
("/etc/init.d/gdm stop"; and don't do that if you are logged into X or
it will blow away your session.)

The reason it did not power itself off is that you do not have the
"apm" module loaded.  Try "modprobe apm" and see if "halt" shuts the
computer off after that.  If it does not work, then try "apt-get
install apmd", and try the "halt" again after ensuring that the "apm"
module got loaded AND the "apmd" was running.  If it worked without
the apmd, you probably don't need to run it, and you can "echo apm >>
/etc/modules" (make certain you use TWO ">") to ensure that the apm
module will be loaded on boot.

(I've had some trouble on a few machines in the past where the APM
stuff pegged the CPU meter and I had to reboot to get control back, so
keep an eye on that in case it happens.  I think it was with a custom
built kernel and I selected the "make idle calls", AFAIK IIRC YMMV.)

It smiled but was not really happy, no doubt... <grin>

Once you fix the "AllowRoot" option and restart "gdm", you can, as I
said before, use the GDM Configurator and turn on the system menu that
offers shutdown and reboot.  Note that with "gdm", there is nothing
preventing anyone with access to the console from halting that
computer...

Can you be more specific?  Is it the "green lights" thing, or
something less "cosmetic only" in nature?

The Debian Policy Manual is somewhat helpful.  You'll find it
available as a package if you like, or read it on the LUG web server
at <URL:http://www.pdxlinux.org/doc/debian-policy/>.  Another good
source of information is the "linuxcookbook" which you may install
yourself or read at:

<URL:http://www.pdxlinux.org/doc/linuxcookbook/cookbook.html#SEC_Top>

Also, you may like to install "discover", for hardware auto-detection,
"hotplug", for USB support, and of course "aptitude", for software
installation management.  You may also find "gkdebconf" helpful, along
with the "configlet-frontends".  Perhaps you will also like to install
a newer kernel-image as well; you'll find several to choose from when
you learn to use "aptitude".

How well does it handle the case where a package has been renamed,
split up, or versioned (to allow, for instance, both python2.1 and
python2.2 to be installed during the transition period) since the
previous release?

Interactively, M-x auto-fill-mode.  I am sure the right thing in your
.emacs would turn it on for the appropriate mode, but I don't know
off-hand what that is.

I'm pretty sure there's a xine plug-in for DVD descrambling.

However, I generally use MPlayer or ogle.

I'm pretty sure we just had a thread on this subject in the last six
weeks.

How much information does that "kickstart" file contain?  Does it know
how you've configured those installed packages, your networking, etc,
or does it merely contain the list of packages to install?

With "dpkg", you can say "dpkg --get-selections", and get a list of
the packages that are installed as a specially formatted ascii text
file.  That file can then be used as standard input to "dpkg
--set-selections", after which you may run "apt-get dselect-upgrade"
to match that package list.  It looks like "aptitude" also might have
at least the rudiments of this sort of ability.

There is an "autoinstall" package that comes from Progeny.  It's not
really "right" yet... it's still somewhat prototypical in many ways,
and fails to work on some hardware since they used a nonstandard
floppy disk format for the boot floppy.  (It's initrd is too big to
fit with a kernel on a 1.44 MB diskette, so they used a larger
diskette format ala "superformat".)

The cool thing that "autoinstall" does is to get a dump of the
"debconf" database on the machine you want to clone, and then preload
that on the new box, and run the install with DEBIAN_FRONTEND set to
"noninteractive".  One problem is that not all packages have been
debconfsicated...  There is much work to be done in this area.

Yes; it works very well.  I'm useing EVMS and XFS together on two
machines.  All of the kernel patches and tools are available in Debian
for both, except for (this may have changed) a critical patch for XFS
that allows it to work correctly with EVMS.  That patch is available
at the EVMS sourceforge site.  You must use the "VFS-Lock" patch if
you plan to use snapshot volumes with journalling file systems.

Yes.

For one of several reasons, the CR openned the folder called INBOX instead
of a folder collection.  Inside a folder, the select operation (;) does
not have a properties option (p), but it does have a numeric selection
option (n).  So you're selecting messages in a folder instead of folders
in a collection.

So maybe you forgot the first command (l) or maybe you don't have folder
collections defined.

The -i switch starts up in the folder index screen.  That's not the screen
from which those initial keystrokes were intended to begin running.

Experimenting with emacs as a mail editor will perhaps lead you to
useing "vm" or "gnus" as your mail reader.  I think you'll find "vm"
to be superiour to Pine.  ("apt-get install vm" if you use GNU Emacs;
it's part of XEmacs already.)

(defun add-to-hooks (hook-fun hooklist)
  "Add HOOK-FUN to each hook variable in HOOKLIST"
  (mapc #'(lambda (mode-hook)
	    (add-hook mode-hook hook-fun))
	hooklist))

(add-to-hooks #'auto-fill-mode '(text-mode
                                 message-mode
                                 ;; ... add more mode names here ...
                                ))

You'll still need to use "M-q" now and then.

Ever notice that "M-q" is the keybinding that completely EXITS
Netscape Navigator?

Subject: [PLUG] autofs executable map for automount of floppy
Message-ID: <87d6s04mdo.fsf@bittersweet.intra.hegbloom.net>

I was trying to use a static automounter map for removable media, and
ran into a snag.  I wanted it to, if the diskette is a Windows disk,
mount it with the "uid=0,gid=25,umask=002" options, so that the
diskette will be writable by GID 25 (floppy).  But if it's a Linux
native file system disk, I want to mount with options appropriate for
that file system.

I was trying to use a static map with "-fstype=auto" and a set of
options that was the union of the option sets for all file system
types that I'd want to mount.  That setup does not work!  It fails to
mount ext2fs diskettes, erroring on unsupported mount options.  I
reported the problem in:

<URL:http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=128616&repeatmerged=yes>

Today I came up with a solution.  Here it is, for all to use and
enjoy...  The "autofs" automounter supports an executable map.  It
runs your script, handing it the "key", and your script prints what
would be the right hand side of the static map.

Now I can put a diskette in the floppy drive, and access it at
"/mnt/rem/floppy".  One second after nothing is using the diskette, it
is umounted.  The "sync" mount option ensures that even if somebody
ejects the diskette before it's truely umounted, the data will still
make it to the diskette before the light winks out.

It sucks that we must use floppy drives that have a physical eject
button on them, rather than one that only _requests_ an eject, like on
a Zip drive or CDROM.  On those, the eject button should not open the
drawer until the disc is really umounted.  (and then we need an easy
(gui) way to discover what is keeping a disc active and thus un
umountable)

It includes

* supported languages and default language
* keyboard and mouse hardware info
* X configuration info (video hardware, default resolution/depth)
* network info (dhcp or static addr/dns/gateway/netmask)
* md5 version of your root password
* firewall/iptables info: disabled, low, medium, high
* authorization configuration (nis? ldap? shadow? md5?)
* timezone
* which bootloader (lilo? grub?) and where it's installed
* local disk partitioning
* package listing

The idea is that, given this kickstart file, you could re-install Red 
Hat to the exact same state if the need arose.

In general, the kickstart facility is one of the things I really like 
about Red Hat. At work I keep two unaltered trees for, say, Red Hat 
7.3 on an nfs fileserver:

* linux/7.3   -- the original 7.3 installation tree
* updates/7.3 -- all the patches, updates

Then I have a tree for locally built rpms

* local/7.3

I've written a Perl script that copies the original installation tree 
into a parallel <version>-current directory, i.e.,:

* linux/7.3-current

The script then scans that tree, making note of all the rpms 
(including those specific to athlon, i686, and i585 architectures). 
Then the script scans the updates directory and, when it finds an 
updated package in updates/7.3, it moves the new package into 
7.3-current and deletes the previous one.

I haven't yet written into the script similar functionality for
scanning my local rpms for updates, so I still have to do that by 
hand. :-(

In any event, the 7.3-current tree ends up with all the latest updates 
plus all my latest local packages (cfengine, xfce, aterm) plus a 
couple third-party packages (java, the ICA client).

Red Hat has a plain text file that allows you to create/edit named 
package groups that you see at installation time, so I have a couple 
groups, one containing non-standard packages that we install on 
desktop machines and one for infrastructure servers.

Once the updates are in place and the package-list file ("comps") is
edited, my perl script uses Red Hat's anaconda tools to regenerate the
installation images -- so any new installation from the 7.3-current
tree is fully patched and includes local and third-party packages.

Thanks, Karl. I hadn't seen anything about the VFS-Lock patch (not

galen,

  I don't know. Wouldn't have thought to look, either. But, I certainly will
look today!

  I've scanned the man pages for xfs and xfstt but I still don't fully
understand the role they play. I've both of them shut off in run level 3 and
I can see no difference in the appearance of X. Where can I read more, just
to satisfy my curiosity?

Many thanks,

Jason,

(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)

  If you want your default-major-mode to be something else, modify as

Does EVMS currently require using XFS?  What if I want to use ext3?  Are 
you using dump for backups?

The font server was originally designed with large installations in mind.  It
allows admins to install fonts once, and make them available to many X
servers.  For your small setup, you may be better off just duplicating
fonts on each machine.  As you have noticed, XFree86 can be configured to
look for fonts from a font server, as well as directly.  Have a look at
the "Files" section of XF86Config.

For more info on font servers, check out
man xfs

galen,

  I cannot locate any configuration files for xfs or xfstt. According to the
xfs man page, one can construct a configuration file and pass that path/name
to the executable upon inocation, but I find nothing that looks like such a
file.

Thanks,

Rich

  How can I take a mozilla bookmark "folder" and make it a top-level one?
Somehow, I managed to move a top-level bookmark tree under another one and I
cannot figure out how to move it back up one level.

I have this in my .emacs file:

(add-hook 'find-file-hooks 'turn-on-auto-fill)

This is pretty all-encompassing, and turns on word-wrapping for every
buffer without exception.  I occassionally have to do a
'M-x auto-fill-mode' to toggle it off.

If you're willing to use `aspell' and have `ruby' installed, another
alternative is spellcheck.vim - http://www.vim.org/script.php?script_id=131

This would be better handled by a procmail recipe. Simply set the DEFAULT
environment variable to point at your mbox. You can then instruct mutt to
use your mbox as your mail spool by setting `spoolfile' in your .muttrc to
point to it... http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/manual-6.html#spoolfile

It would be the second one I think.  I double checked and l is in

so screw up my procmail recipes?

Unfortunately for me, I use pine on a computer that a) is running
solaris, and b) I don't have root on.  But I can ask for vm if it
isn't here already.  I tried using gnus once on my computer to test it
out, but it only wanted to check news.  I think I tried vm once too.
Will it move things to a different place than pine has been using?  I
really hate it when I test an email program and it screws up my mail...

Thanks, I'll give that a try.

That's ok, I just wanted to a replacement for pine's C-j.

It's been so long since I used navigator...I forgot that it existed.

Gnus can use multuple email backends, af many types, I think at least 
one of these will interface with your procmail/pine setup. www.gnus.org
has reasonably clear documentation on setting it up, or in emacs:

I did use mutt, with vi as my editor and it did not linewrap, and I didn't pay
enough attention to the line length (that's a task for today, get vi to wrap 
lines for in email..)

Dan's instructions are crystal clear. I'll add one more useful thing.

You can also do:

rpm -Uvh <package_list>

where <package_list> is a file that contains the paths to a collection
of packages you want to install.

This has the advantage that you can put disparate packages in the list
whose names don't necessarily reduce to a nice shell globbing
expression like "mozilla*1.1-0.i386.rpm".

I don't remember what the path names are relative to.  Full pathnames
will always work.  Also the package names, alone, will work if
<package_list> is in a common directory with the packages it names and
that directory is the current directory.

It may be that the package names simply need to be relative to the
current directory.  Or they may need to be relative to the directory
in which <package_list> sits.  The rpm man page is less than clear
on the use of <package_list> so I'm giving you what I've discovered
on my own.

Yes you can do this by going into Konqueror and changing the file 
association. Once in the file association setup, look for the "html" 
file type under "text". Use the "add" feature to add "galeon" and then 
move the "galeon" entry to the top of the application list so it is 
used over Konqueror. That should make any KDE app that opens an HTML 
filetype use galeon rather than Konqueror.

You may have to shutdown all instances of Kmail and Konqueror to get the 
new settings to work. I tried it for kicks and initially Kmail was 
still using Konqueror. I finally shutdown Kmail and all instances of 
Konqueror. I restarted Kmail and it was using "galeon" rather than 
Konqueror to open HTML links.

I may have just done a very stupid thing.

On a mandrake 8.2 system I just did:

chmod -R o-w /usr/share

Don't ask why.

Lot's of disk crunching (expected).

Then all the icons on my desktop flashed, (unexpected)
like when you install a new mandrake package
that automatically updates your menus and icons.

Have I just irreparable broken my system?

All you did was make it so that "other" doesn't have write access to 
anything on /usr/share. Doesn't really sound bad to me. That's usually 
they way you want all files and directories to be in /usr/share 
otherwise anyone could create a file or another directory somewhere in 
the /usr/share filesystem hierarchy.

You define them in the .pinerc.

Not at all.  A folder collection is merely a logical collection of mboxes
for pine's own purposes.  There is no change to the filesystem.

Here's a section from my .pinerc:

# List of directories where saved-message folders may be. First one is
# the default for Saves. Example: Main {host1}mail/[], Desktop mail\[]
# Syntax: optnl-label {optnl-imap-hostname}optnl-directory-path[]
folder-collections=IN mail/[IN.*],
    ROOT mail/[ROOT.*],
    OUT mail/[OUT.*],
    SAVE mail/[SAVE.*],
    ADMIN mail/[ADMIN*],
    WEB mail/[WEB*],
    ALL mail/[]


Dig?  I have mboxes called IN.whatever, OUT.whatever, SAVE.whatever,
WEB.domain, ROOT.host.domain, and so on.  You'll see there's also a
collection called ALL that contains every mbox.

My procmail filters put mail in IN.whatever based on different rules.  So
there's an IN.plug and an IN.plug-talk and an IN.jeme.brelin (for this
address, but not from a mailing list) and so on.  The OUT.whatever boxes
are set as the default FCC for different roles are addresses.  I also use
roles in pine pretty extensively and the ability to set a default role by
folder, but also select a role manually at compose time is the number one
reason I haven't been able to switch to mutt.

Woops, so you did...

User-Agent: Mutt/1.4i

...I missed that, sorry. As for line wrapping, if you're truly using `vi'
and not `vim' (poor guy), then in your .exrc you'd need to `set wrapmargin='
to some value...

    wm=<*>                  | wrapmargin - In append mode vi automatically
                            |   puts a <lf> whenever there is a <sp> or <ht>
                            |   within <wm> columns from the right margin
                            |   (0 = don't put a <lf> in the file, yet put it
                            |   on the screen).

Hopefully `vi' is actually brining up `vim', in which case in your .vimrc
you could `set textwidth=' to the number of characters you always want for a
line length. `vim' offers a host of formatting controls. See...

   Linkname: Vim online doc: usr_25.txt
        URL: http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/vim2html2.pl?page=usr_25.txt#usr_25.txt

One handy tip with `vim' that parlays with `mutt' is to include this
autocommand in your .vimrc ...

au FileType mail set textwidth=76 formatoptions=t

There are plenty of other ways to skin that cat. I'll leave the RTFM and
Googling as an exercise for you :)

cheers,
Sandy

Is this what you're looking to do in `mutt'?

In your .vimrc file add:

map Q !}fmt --prefix="> "
map W !}fmt

The Q is for formatting quoted text, handy if the text has 'long line,
short line' syndrome. The W is for formatting your reply. Make sure the
block of text you want to format is surrounded by one or more blank lines
- more than once I've accidentaly formatted my entire reply including
the sig! =:-0

Not quite.

I need to set both FCC and From: based on one of several criteria:

The currently active mbox (what am I doing right now)

The From: or Reply-To: address of the mail to which I'm replying (who do I
want them to think I am)

The To: address of the mail to which I'm replying (who do they think I am)

The subject line of the message (for certain mailing lists and other weird
situations where the From: address and mbox are not predicatable)

I would also like the ability to change roles at compose time.  Ideally, I
would be presented with a list of options, but that's not strictly
necessary.  I can simply memorize a list of role names.

This is all functionality of pine that I use all the time.  I'd love to
use a truly Free mail client, but I have had little success with mutt in
doing some of the more complex things with roles and the learning curve on
gnus caused me to roll downhill really fast.  I know that's no excuse, but
that's all I've got at the moment.

Subject: [PLUG] Erratic FTP Failure
Message-ID: <200208301515.35907.mcintoshrt@attbi.com>

Hi,

I'm running a small home network that is using FreeBSD 4.3 for some local 
services (http, ftp, mail, smbd, atalkd, name resolution).  Roughly 60% of 
the time the FreeBSD box has ridiculously slow upload rates (via ftp, atalkd, 
and smbd) and eventually stalls the transfer without getting past < 500KB of 
the job.  Downloading data from the server is nice and zippy, however.  
Pinging the server produces normal results - no errors or losses.  Checking 
/var/log/messages shows no errors.

 Here's the output from netstat -i;

Due to the high input errors noted on sis0, I suspect a bad cable connection.  
Would anyone else agree with this?  Or am I running too many services on the 
minimal hardware for this machine (network consists of two other systems 
which regularly use the server)?

32 MB RAM
Pentium 120 MHz
20+ GB storage

Thanks In Advance,
Robert

Bah! That's the old way... a la `vi'. ViMmers do...

  nmap <C-J>      gq}
  vmap <C-J>      gq

Thus, Ctrl-J reformats (Justifies) the paragraph (starting at the current
cursor position) in "normal mode", and reformats the selected text in
"visual mode". And if you goof, just 'u'ndo it (`vim' supports multiple undo
levels, unlike `vi').

This mapping has the added advantages of (1) not spawning another process,
and (2) not overriding the default mappings for "Q" (Switch to "Ex" mode)
and "W" ([count] WORDS forward - motion command)l.

As for quoted text, you can specify what leading characters are to be
interpreted as a comment via "set comments". Here's what I use...

set comments=b:#,:%,fb:-,n:>,n:)

That automatically takes care of formatting quoted text, unless you've done
"set paste" (which is handy in and of itself). For more details, while in
`vim', do...

    :help format-comments

Did you go check it out?  Here is the link:

The author gives you credit and mentions an article you wrote.  So I
sort of assumed that you might have used/tested it at least once :)

Thanks Tony for the reply.

Yeah, I know what it does. And I would have agreed with you before I
did it.  The operative word in your post is "usually".

But the fact that my desktop "refreshed" (icons blinked, panel
refreshed) as the permission changes were being performed made me
think (with that feeling of nausea in the pit of one's stomach):

"Uh-oh.  Does Mandrake or KDE keep their system menu/desktop stuff in
/usr/share and do they requre it to be open so that they can easily
update menu libraries when packages are installed or deleted by
ordinary users?

Are all my menus going to be hosed from now on?  Have I, at the push
of a <RET> key (I'm a commandline kinda guy) just cost myself hours
of pain, toil, and tears? ..."

So ran the train of my morbid thoughts.
I guess time will tell.

I did a quick scan of my SuSE 8.0 system and I couldn't find a single 
case of where any file or directory was writable by "other". Maybe 
Mandrake is different but all of my KDE stuff goes into /opt and I 
didn't see that any KDE related in /usr/share.

 Venezuela's Government Shifts to Open Source Software

According to government sources in Venezuela, the South American nation
has announced an official policy that exclusively calls for the use of
open source software in that government.

The announcement, made on Wednesday, stated that from now on, all software
developed for the government must be licenced under the GPL. The entire
policy was summed up in this statement by Dr. Felipe Prez-Mart, Planning
and Development Minister: "Open source whenever possible, propietary
software only when necesary."

[snippage]

Rey also outlined additional details of the plan. Besides the government's
GPL requirement, the policy requires that the official accounting
application for Venezeula must be a GPL'ed application. The policy also
states that the government will openly combat software piracy by purging
all unlicensed copies of software from its offices.

Additionally, the policy also outlines a new Internet access program where
all machines would be Linux-based and held under community franchise.

[snippage]

In an interview (in Spanish) with LaRed.com, Prez-Mart outlined one of the
big reasons why this policy was announced. According to Prez-Mart, the
government and the people of Venezeula were increasingly concerned that
over 75 percent of the funds for software licenses went to foreign
nations, 20 percent to foreign support agencies, and only 5 percent to
Venezuelan programmers.

The amazing thing is that open source is not automatically a preferred
choice for anyone anywhere.

Unfortunately Mandrake is sufficiently different from SuSE that
such a comparison is probably not useful (but thanks just the same).

And unfortunately KDE under Mandrake goes in /usr with a boat load of
it in /usr/share.  For example, heres a small snippet from the "A's":

  drwxr-xr-x    8 root     root         4096 Apr  1 10:11 applets/
  drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root         4096 Aug 26 19:27 application-registry/
  drwxr-xr-x   17 root     root         4096 Feb 22  2002 applnk/
  drwxr-xr-x   14 root     root         4096 Aug 26 19:28 applnk-mdk/
  drwxr-xr-x   11 root     root         4096 Aug 26 19:28 applnk-mdk-simplified/
  drwxr-xr-x  150 root     root         4096 Apr  1 13:21 apps/

Each of these have reams of KDE .desktop and other files in them.  And
that's just the A's.

Mandrake tries to be very sophisticated when it comes to KDE and
menu/desktop updates when you install/de-install their packages.  Lots
of little perl scripts get fired off behind the scenes that do lots of
little magical things. It actually all works remarkable well---until
some Dolt comes along and does a global permission change on a major
system subdirectory!

So far I have not seen any adverse effects, but I'm just using the system
right now.  I guess I'll find out next time I install an rpm or
restart KDE.  I'm almost afraid to try.

Yes, I'm feeling adventurous, and because of that I've begun the process
of trying out Debian. I've still got RH 7.1 on the laptop, and still
have ethereal working there. Maybe I'll give that a try after I get the
desktop machine looking better with Debian.

Hi, Dean!

  My RH 6.2 system has directories with 755 permissions (just like your
example below) and files with 644 permissions.

  I'll bet that what you saw was the OS blinking when it said to itself,
"Huh? There ain't no other permissions besides read; what's the guy want me
to do?"

  By removing write permissions that did not exist before it is almost
certain that you did nothing to the system but momentarily confuse it.

  Enjoy the holiday! I'm barbecuing a brisket tomorrow: up at 3 am to fire
the pit. Then ~12 hours of slow cooking.

I tried having auto-fill mode turned on automatically for

I added that stuff to my .emacs, but it never happens.  I noticed that
when I edit email the major mode is Fundamental, so I added
fundamental-mode to list, and it still doesn't work.  What am I doing
wrong...

And I already deleted the other posts to compare with.

Ok how about the other way around.  I have the following in my galeon config 
to use kmail as the mail program, but I'm not very happy with the results so 
far.

kmail --composer  -s "%s" --body "%y" %u

Anyone have anything better?

Subject: Venezuela's Government Shifts to Open Source Software

So M$ tried but they couldn't buy Peru. Here's a quote from the article

P?rez-Mart? outlined one of the big reasons why this policy was announced.
According to P?rez-Mart?, the government and the people of Venezeula were
increasingly concerned that over 75 percent of the funds for software
licenses went to foreign nations, 20 percent to foreign support agencies, and
only 5 percent to Venezuelan programmers.

My reading of the emacs info pages lead me to think that the
add-to-hooks call should look like this instead:

(add-to-hooks #'auto-fill-mode '(text-mode-hook
                                 message-mode-hook
                                 ;; ... add more mode names here ...
                                ))

Note the addition of -hook to Karl's example.  Also, I don't think
there is a 'fundamental-mode-hook, which partially torpedoes that for
you.

I think a reasonable solution is to indicate a default mode for new
buffers and then make sure auto-fill is on for text-mode with the two
following lines:

  (setq default-major-mode 'text-mode)
  (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)

but you can set 'default-major-mode' to something other than
fundamental-mode.

Is there a way I could pass a variable on the command line?  Then just
enable auto-fill-mode if the var is set?  Since pine starts a new
instance of emacs for every edit, then that might work really well.

It looks like this will work for you:

  emacs --eval "(setq default-major-mode 'text-mode)"

Hmm.  Actually, that didn't work when I just tested it.  What did, for
me, was making a file, say, special.el:

  (setq default-major-mode 'text-mode) 
  (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)

and then using:

  emacs -l special.el message-file

You can even byte-compile the special.el into special.elc, though it
isn't clear to me why you don't want to just put the two lines in your
.emacs file.

On my RH 6.2 system, the font server config file is at /etc/X11/fs/config
I found it with this:
  locate xfs

I feel it's my duty to point out that Venezuela is not simply adopting the
so-called "Open Source" software, but requiring FREE Software.

The intent here is to benefit all people everywhere for all time.

Don't say I didn't warn you.

galen,

  I didn't follow up the 'locate' with a package query. I see in this file
what the man page lists as a sample file, but there's nothing about nfs in
there.

Many thanks,

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0208310653110.9866-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Each morning when I come to log in on the workstation I see where the SCSI
bus has been queried for devices and the details of the tape drive revealed.
This information is posted to /var/log/messages and printedon the screen. It
happens only when there is a scheduled backup.

  In the daily run-parts report I see the same information presented as
"kernel errors".

  I would very much like to understand why this appears in 1)
/var/log/messages, 2) the cron.daily report and 3) on the monitor. I'd also
like to know if there's something I can do to eliminate this behavior. If,
as I suspect, this is normally written to /var/log/messages, I also suspect
that it's _not_ normal to have it appear on the monitor and in the run-parts
report.

  Here's an example from /var/log/messages:

The file governing what messages get logged and where those entries

See the syslog.conf(5) man page and edit the syslog.conf file

  Ah, yes!

  Thanks, Paul. I'll have plenty of time today to futz with it as the
brisket went into the barbecue pit at 6 am; dinner's scheduled for ~6 pm.
Lot's of time to get caught up and do end-of-month work.

Rich,

I have a couple of systems that have the same 'problem' and some that
don't.  The ones that don't have BusLogic PCI/SCSI cards, the ones that do
have other cards.  (Mostly Adaptec 29xx cards.)  I believe it has to do
with a setting on the SCSI card about a sleep-mode/ bus-reset/ power-down/
some-such-thingy but the problem systems are 24/7 so I can't explore them
right now.  Only one of the BusLogic systems is under my direct control
and I've never had this problem with BusLogic SCSI cards.
   It would be interesting to know which chip set the SymBios is using.

Btw, I think you're using the same backup software I am, BRU, o we can't
blame it.  What about asking the BRU people (Tolis Group?) to see if
others have reported this issue and if they worked out a solution.  
   They've always been good to me.

How do I collect user input using bash? For example, if you wanted to
collect three strings at the command line and store them as variables:

$./myscript.sh

your name: foo bar
number of oranges : 34
number of apples : 6

Any ideas?

  Yes, I've been using BRU for about 5 years now. The folks there have been
outstanding and have helped me diagnose hardware problems in the backup
system. The fellow who used to be the vice president (under EST) was very
active in the floppy-tape mail list and helped a bunch of us get those old
tape drives to work in linux, and with BRU, of course.

  It's not a problem, per se, only a bit of sloppiness I'd like to clean up,
if possible. Nothing's hurt by it.

Finding the package of 'automake' might be a good bet.  Since you didn't 
list your distribution, here's what I did under debian:

$ apt-cache search automake

automake1.5 - A tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles.
automake1.6 - A tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles.
autoproject - create a skeleton source package for a new program
autotools-dev - Update infrastructure for config.{guess,sub} files
autobook - GNU Autoconf, Automake and Libtool Book
automake - A tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles.

Finding whatever package under your distro that has those files would be 
a good place to start.  If you already have them (or think you do), try 
to 'locate' them and edit your $PATH.

Well, if you don't have GCC installed, install it.  You *need* GCC to
compile things under Linux.

What distro are you using?  Getting it might change depending on the
distro.  :-)

Paul,

  Here's the relevant (and topmost) lines from /etc/syslog.conf:

# Log all kernel messages to the console.
# Logging much else clutters up the screen.
#kern.*                                                 /dev/console
kern.*                                                  /dev/tty12

  Notice that I commented out the /dev/console destination. I've no idea
what /dev/tty12 is; perhaps that needs to also be commented out.

  I don't see any directions for kernel messages to go to /var/log/messages,
but they sure end up there, too. Ergo, I must be misunderstanding the file
or I'm missing something really simple.

Thoughts?

It's the console you get by mashing Ctrl-Alt-F12, I believe.  At least it
is on my system.

something like:
kern.debug                      /var/log/messages

should send all kernel messages to /var/log/messages.  I think

kern.*                          /var/log/messages

would work too.

I recall it saying that there were over 8000 packages, but that I should
start with a smaller number. It offered me a few more than the 439 (I
think) that I took. That seemed like a smaller number to me at the time.
I guess I should have started with even less.

I believe the installation used tasksel. I think the only other option
was dselect, which I think it suggested I not use as a first time
installer.

I just ran apt-get install aptitude. I couldn't find anything in the
documentation that explains how to see what packages I have. In my
quest, I ran aptitude without any options and discovered interactive
mode. Nosing around in there I found the Packages view in the menu. This
appears to be one way of discovering alternative tools. For example,
browsers are collected into one group, and I see several I've never
heard of. More reading is in order.

Thanks for the help.

  Install the development environmnent for whatever distribution you're
using. You have no compiler (gcc -- cc is the original name) and no autoconf
or automake tools. Something's seriously broken, Dirk. You're missing a lot
of packages/tarballs.

David,

  I suspected as much, but never use that terminal. I see the kernel
messages -- only for the scsi bus -- on virtual console 1.

  I'll add one of these, but I wonder why they're not there but kernel
messages still appear in /var/log/messages. Strange!

Recently in the #orlug chat room, we were wondering how to find out if
our NIC is in Full Duplex mode or not.

Well, I found this: http://more.sbc.co.jp/slj/doc/commands/mii_tool.asp
which is the man page for mii-tool.
And this VERY good info about it:
http://www.stonesoft.com/document/art/2185.html
I was very please to find out that I have mii-tool on my Mandrake 8.2
laptop.

Here's what I did:
su
mii-tool (it told me that I'm operating at 100baseTx-HD)

So, then I typed:
mii-tool -F 100baseTx-FD

Now, mii-tool said that I was running in Full-Duplex mode, but my switch
said otherwise. I got the other light on my switch to light up by
messing with what my NIC "advertises".
mii-tool -A 100baseTx-FD

Ta-da.
Hope this is helpful.
If you don't have mii-tool, you can get it here:
http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/ftp/extras/mii-tool.tar.gz

Now if I could just get my wireless card working, I'd be one happy
person :)

I was on a text console when I logged in as rsteff, and when I ran
startx.

Hmmm. When I logged out of KDE, I didn't get out of X, but was at the
KDE login screen.

Didn't get back to a text console. Also, couldn't get to a text console.
I tried <ctrl><alt>F1, (and all the other function keys up through F8)
but all I get is a beep. Must be another configuration thing. What do
you call this one, and where do I change it so I can switch between
consoles?

There it is (GDM Configurator). One of the options is "Show the 'system'
menu, (for reboot, shutdown etc.) For now, I'm more familiar with Gnome,
so I'll just work with that. Later on I might try KDE.

I have to agree with Brian on this one. I can see the advantages for
systems that are out where the "public" can access them, but not for the
one in my office at home.

Again, thanks for the help.

You don't need autoconf or automake.  Those are things used to create

Dirk,

  This is an important lesson for all, and one worth having in the archive.
Even if you don't intend to write a single line of code in any compiled or
intepreted language, you need the development tools installed. Lots of
applications need them.

  Sometimes you need the development version of a tool set, in addition to
the tools themselves, in order to compile/install an application at a higher
level of abstraction.

  That's why we all have a dozen or two languages languishing on our hard
drives.

Good luck!

Rich

  Oh. In this case, I would probably put the cdrom #1 in the drive, run
'init 6' from the command line and get back to the install/upgrade program.
I'd select 'upgrade', let the software check for packages to upgrade, tell
it you want to select among those, then go to the "Development System"
section and pick the ones you want. The installer will then find the
dependencies those need and install the whole bunch. Usually.

After running apt-get install apmd:

No APM support in kernel

Does this mean I left something important out during the initial
installation, and that I need to recompile the kernel?

You will need to recompile your kernel, or at least compile the apm modules.
The easiest thing to do, is use "make menuconfig" to enable apm as a module
(APM is under the General Setup section in 2.4.17), then enabling the
aspects of APM you need.. I would start with just "Use real mode APM BIOS
call to power off", but others may have better advice.

Once you do that, exit menuconfig (saving your settings when prompted), then
do: 
	make dep && make modules && make modules_install

Assuming all that goes well, you will now be able to do the modprobe and
start apmd.

Mostly cosmetic, I think.

One non-cosmetic thing is switching between virtual consoles. I can go
from X to one of the other consoles, but I can't go from that console to
anything else. Before I reconfigured gdm, I couldn't switch between
consoles at all -- I'd just get a beep. Now that the system menu is on
the Gnome login screen, I can switch to another console. I guess that's
a paranoia level security thing. <ctrl><alt><del> didn't work, either.
Makes sense. If the keyboard is in a public space, and you don't want
the public shutting things down, you wouldn't want them to be able to
switch to another console. (You can always lock the box itself in a
cabinet to prevent manual power interruption.)

Someplace, I read that I should use the left hand <ctrl> and <alt> keys
with the function keys for switching between consoles. On my keyboard,
the left hand <ctrl> and <alt> keys don't produce any effect.  Right
hand works for switching into another console in Linux, but doesn't want
to switch back? I tried all combinations of left and right hand
<ctrl><alt>F1-F8, including just F1-F8, and just <ctrl>F1, or <alt>F1
(through F12, actually). I get the X screen back when I reboot, though.

A similar thing happens in Windows -- left hand <ctrl><alt><del> doesn't
work, but right hand does. (It's an older keyboard, Precision
Instruments model KB101MC. It's really comfortable, so I stayed with it
through two machine upgrades.)

 Anybody have this problem? I can't seem to get Linux (Mandrake 8.2) to see

Here's the story: I got a USB Hub. I moved my mouse to a different USB port,
because the cord for the hub was short so I needed to move the mouse to a
lower port so that the hub could sit on top of my box. Mouse still works in
windows (after re-recognizing). When I fired up Linux, Harddrake informed me
that my USB mouse was gone. I can't see it in /dev/USB (I'm using devfs).
I've tried running mousedrake, but apparently that only configures the
software side (GPM + Xwindows). Any clues?

grep for it in /proc/bus/usb/devices and see if Linux sees it at all.

Does it work when plugged in to the USB hub?  Does the USB hub work
plugged in to the port the mouse is plugged in to?

The way the cursor responds to the mouse being moved seems strange. If I
move the mouse very slowly, the cursor doesn't move at all. If I move
the mouse quickly, the cursor moves, but it's harder to get it where I
want it. I've played with the settings for Acceleration and Threshold in
the Gnome Control Center, and while the speed of the cursor changes with
changes in the Acceleration setting, the cursor still doesn't move when
I'm moving the mouse slowly. The cursor also seems to "stick" to various
controls as I move across them. This is a very annoying behavior I'd
like to find a way to turn off.

Apt has a way to get kernels and install them, but I have never tried
it.  I got to www.kernel.org, and grab the latest stable kernel.
Should be something like 2.4.19 or 2.4.20.  Once you have that, I
usually put it in /usr/src/linux-x.x.xx, and then type
ln -s /usr/src/linux-x.x.xx /usr/src/linux

Then you can go into /usr/src/linux and do make menuconfig, or make
xconfig.  You may want to get some help with the kernel options.  I
usually configure from scratch, but it took me a while to get to the
point where I could make a kernel with all the features I wanted on
the first try.  #orlug would be a good place to get help with the
config.

HTH,
Jason

That still didn't work for me...It sets it to text mode, but
auto-fill-mode is not set.  I've tried all the suggestions you have
made (thanks for helping me!), but it still doesn't set the
auto-fill-mode.  Do you have anymore ideas?  Is there a way we can
debug this?  I'm not real familiar with elisp.  I know lisp, but not
the emacs-centric parts of it.

Right, I have done that, I was just thinking what if I use the global
auto-fill based on the value in a varible that I set at the command
line.  The problem I'll probably run into is that pine doesn't seem to
pass the --eval commands properly, and I need to look in the archive
to find how to do the global thing (it's a lazy saturday :).  I guess
even if pine doesn't pass --evals I can just put it in a file, so
that's a non-issue.  I should probably just put the global auto-fill
in a file and load that...

Thanks again.  No big deal if this doesn't get resolved.
Jason

Once you get the kernel-source downloaded, look at the debian.README.gz in 
the doc/kernel-source-X.XX/ folder it will give pretty good instructions on 
what to do.

Also copy /boot/config to your /usr/src/linux folder, that way you are 
starting from a known good configuration.

Try apt-get install kernel-source and it will give you a list of kernels that 
you can download for installation.

I think I'll put this one off until I've read more. I can always hold
the power button in if I want to power down. This machine usually stays
on all the time, anyway.

Meanwhile, I'll devote my time to figuring out how to make the user
interface comfortable. From the experience I've had over the last year
and a half, I'm satisfied that the part that's under the hood is
superior to Windows. And I am comfortable with the command line for
administrative stuff. Now, I've just got to find the right settings for
the screen, and the mouse, and I'll be closer to abandoning Windows.

Thanks for the ideas.

There's html2ps.  It's a perl script.  I've never used it, so I don't know
how good a job it does.

You might want to be sure your firewall rules filter ipv6 as while as ipv4. I
had left the ipv6 module in the default  SuSE kernel loading after I toasted
the networking by disabling everything but net-pf-1 / unix. I have ATT cable
and need DHCP to work and it took a while for me to realize that the net-pf-17
/ af_packet module was needed for DHCP. I was playing with a lot of things when
I broke DHCP and wasn't testing the changes one at a time. Once I figured out
what I did, I disabled the net modules that I don't use.  

I haven't figured out how to keep SuSE from configuring IPv6 other than by
disabling the ability to load the module. There is probably a better way to do
this but this works. The following is what I did in /etc/modules.conf. YMMV  

alias net-pf-1 unix
#alias net-pf-3 ax25
alias net-pf-3 off
#alias net-pf-4 ipx
alias net-pf-4 off
#alias net-pf-5 appletalk
alias net-pf-5 off
#alias net-pf-6 netrom
alias net-pf-6 off
#alias net-pf-10 ipv6
alias net-pf-10 off
#alias net-pf-11 rose
alias net-pf-11 off
alias net-pf-17 af_packet

I will download the new nmap and load ipv6 tomorrow to see if SuSEfirewall2
blocks the scans. I'll post my findings if someone doesn't beat me to it. 


Thank you
Russell

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hello everyone,

I am pleased to announce that Nmap version 3.10ALPHA2 is now
available!  This version has some cool stuff that I couldn't add
before due to stability issues.  In particular, IPv6 is now supported
and the codebase has been migrated to C++.  Due to all the changes,
there may be portability problems.  But I have lightly tested it on
Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and Windows.  If it does not compile/work for
you, please let me know (including details on the OS you are running).
A patch is even better :).

The IPv6 support is currently limited to the most important options
such as -sT.  I may add raw packet scans (ICMP6 pinging, UDP, SYN,
etc) if there is demand.  The protocol is actually pretty fun!	Not
only do I feel like a king with my own /64 allocation
(18446744073709551616 addresses!), but it can be useful for bypassing
certain firewalls.  Check out this host that has a bunch of filtered
IPv4 ports, but is wide open via IPv6.	Pay special attention to port
111 (SunRPC).

Note that this may have changed, since I notified the Kame folks last
week.  But I'm sure this is a common mistake.

Here are the CHANGELOG entries since 3.00 (ALPHA1 was a dev-only
release):

Nmap 3.10ALPHA2

o Fixed compilation and IPv6 support on FreeBSD (tested on
  4.6-STABLE).	Thanks to Niels Heinen (niels.heinen at ubizen.com) for
  suggestions.

o Made some portability changes based on suggestions by Josef 'Jupp'
  Schugt (jupp at gmx.de)

o Fixed compilation and IPv6 support on Solaris 9 (haven't tested
  earlier versions).

Nmap 3.10ALPHA1

o IPv6 is now supported for TCP scan (-sT), connect()-style ping scan
  (-sP), and list scan (-sL)!  Just specify the -6 option and the IPv6
  numbers or DNS names.  Netmask notation is not currently supported
  -- I'm not sure how useful it is for IPv6, where even petty end
  users may be allocated trillions of addresses (/80).	If you need
  one of the scan types that hasn't been ported yet, give Sebastien
  Peterson's patch a try at http://nmap6.sourceforge.net/ .  If there
  is demand, I may integrate more of that into Nmap.

o Major code restructing, which included conversion to C++ -- so
  you'll need g++ or another C++ compiler.  I accidently let a C++
  requirement slip in a while back and found that almost everyone has
  such a compiler.  Windows (VC++) users: see the README-WIN32 for new
  compilation instructions.

o Applied patch from Axel Nennker (Axel.Nennker at t-systems.com) which
  adds a --without-nmapfe option to the configure script.  This si
  useful if your system doesn't have the proper libraries (eg GTK) or
  if you think GUIs are for sissies :).

o Removed arbitrary max_parallelism (-M) limitations, as suggested by
  William McVey ( wam at cisco.com ).

o Added DEC OSF to the platforms that require the BSDFIX() macro due
  to taking ip length and offset fields in host rather than network
  byte
  order.  Suggested by Dean Bennett (deanb at gbtn.net)

o Fixed an debug statement C ambiguity discovered by Kronos
  (kronos at kronoz.cjb.net)

For those of you running Linux/x86 w/a recent version of rpm
(www.rpm.org), you can install/upgrade to the newest version of
nmap/nmapfe by executing these commands as root:

rpm -vhU (nmap url)
where (nmap url) is one (or both) of these:

http://download.insecure.org/nmap/dist/nmap-3.10ALPHA2-1.i386.rpm
http://download.insecure.org/nmap/dist/nmap-frontend-3.10ALPHA2-1.i386.rpm

I've compiled gphoto2 so I could download pictures from my digital 
camera and originally wanted some sort of GUI that worked with it. But 
after having had my camera for couple of months now and have take 
several 100 pictures I'm not sure what I would use a GUI for with 
"gphoto2". I only use "gphoto2" to download the pictures from my camera 
and that's it. Once I have all of the JPEG files on disk and can view 
them with a variety of utilities. 

My favorite "viewer" right now is the Konqueror browser in KDE 3. It has 
an "Image Gallery" feature that will scan through an entire 
subdirectory creating thumbnails of each image and generating an 
"images.html" file. The HTML file allows me to see each thumbnail and 
when I click on a thumbnail the corresponding JPEG file is opened in my 
browser.

I'm not saying a GUI wouldn't be nice but after initially thinking I 
needed a GUI with "gphoto2" I find I don't really one. I tend to take 
high resolution (4 megapixel) images which are too large to post on a 
website or send through email so I use a command-line utility called 
"convert" to scale my JPEG images down to a more reasonable size. With 
a simple shell script wrapper around "convert" I can scale entire 
directories of images with a single command.

I always like trying to things out with "gphoto2" and so I would like to 
hear from anyone that has a GUI working with it since I've only used it 
from the command-line.

Hello to all. When trying to install RedHat 7.3 over a Debian  hdd I receive the 
following error message;

How do I clear this to install the new distro  
Thanks, Dirk

Someone please confirm for me this;
If fdisk shows that I have only 76G on an 81G hdd , then something is locked 
up on the disk somewhere, somehow, and I won't be able to install anything 
successfully.

While checking for bad blocks on my hdd during another attempt, this time of 
a Debian 2.2 install, I have;
Kernel Panic: Free list corrupted

This after successfully doing same on hda1, and hda? the swap. I was 
attempting on the large hda?, which was the largest ext2 on the drive.

We're starting ATT broadband on Monday. Should we buy their modem or one 
of our own? If our own, where and how much should we pay? Or can any 
 DSL beat their price [$48/month] and service?
Thanks, Dirk
