Subject: [PLUG] Trouble with 2.6.27.39 kernel...
Message-ID: <1259658052.3142.4.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I'm trying to replace a 2.6.10 kernel on a Slackware 10.1 system
with a 2.6.27.39 kernel.  Well, I think I have a usable initrd.gz
and kernel now, but I haven't been able to boot successfully.
In the old days, you used to say root=/dev/sda6 for example
if that is the partition on your scsi disk that holds root.
I get a warning not to do that in the boot messages and it
doesn't work.  What is the new method of setting the root?
Do I need to boot with the old 2.6.10 kernel and label the
root partition with an ext3 file system label?

I did the following mkinitrd incantantion:

mkinitrd -c -k 2.6.27.39 -m jbd:ext3 -m scsi_transport_??:aic7xxxx 

... maybe I'm forgetting something...

Like I say though, I think I have the initrd and kernel image that I
need to boot.  I just don't know what the new method of specifying
the root filesystem is.

Grub and Lilo handle booting differently.

These are the lines I have. I don't need an initrd so that line is omitted.

image = /boot/vmlinuz
  root = /dev/sda2
  label = Linux
  read-only

Did you run lilo -v after you compiled the new kernel and initrd? I believe
make install when compiling the kernel auto adds the line entry to
/etc/lilo.conf now so that shouldn't be an issue.

I neither use lilo nor grub.  I use freedos 1.0 and 
loadlin with a directory that holds the kernel and 
initrd files:

loadlin.exe 2_6_27.gz initrd=initrd.gz root=/dev/sda6

and the above command fails with a kernel panic and a
warning that my method of indicating where the root 
is is deprecated.

I suspect the kernel should work with Slackware 10.1.
I grabbed an unzipped copy of /proc/config.gz from
the old 2.6.10 kernel and fed that into the 2.6.27.39
xconfig script.  In essence, I should have built the
same kernel with the same modules and any new 
dependencies should have been satisfied.

Do I label the root partition as ROOT and set 
root=LABEL=ROOT or something similar?

I don't use loadlin so I have no clue but a quick google search turned up
this.

I think your first sentence is key. "I don't understand". You act as if 
there is no value in the products and technologies you listed.

Without even stepping foot inside their door you already have the best 
fit for their needs? And you said "saving money" and "custom solution" 
in almost the same sentence. This is too vague regardless of platform, 
and comes with it's own set of liabilities.

You make it sound so simple. :) Can you offer a practical example of 
what you mean by the above, and how maintenance fits in?

Don't get me wrong. Microsoft does things that confound me to no end. 
I'm only a Linux hobbiest, but all my edge appliances run OpenBSD, and 
all my web/db/app servers run FreeBSD. I'm fine to recommend and 
implement OSS where it makes sense.

I replace kernels in Slackware 9.0 and 12.2 all the time and never need 
an initrd. Keep it simple??

The public is so conditioned by the last 15 years of Microsoft that they
can't think straight and are too lazy to look for other choices.

I do what I can to get new users to try Linux. I've used at least 10
different distros and the best one for new users is Linux Mint. I would say
that 3 in 10 clients that I help with their computers will give Linux a try.

Burn copies of Linux Mint 8 and give them out anyone who seems interested.
If we all can get one new user a month to use Linux, the computing gods will
smile on us. :)

I think it probably has a lot to do with the "known" factor as well.  It may be better or faster or more secure, but all those things are invisible mostly to the end user.  They have already mapped out the costs for the lifecycle of the hardware and probably aren't interested in making radical changes until such a time as it becomes necessary.  On a somewhat different and anecdotal note, I know one local business  who when offered a FOSS solution said that they did not want to run that "communist" software.

Unfortunately, after landing on the linux mint website, I found, to my 
dismay, that they have no 64 bit version available in the latest 
release, codenamed "Helena".
Perhaps some kind soul can recompile and pass it along to them?

So what!  The 32 bit works just fine. 95% of the public could care less if
its 32 or 64 bit.

Don't let that get in the way of getting others to use Linux.

Jobs are created by entrepreneurial people who start businesses
(or who start bureaucracies within government).  They usually
have goals that have little or nothing to do with what kind of
software they are using.  They just need tools that do their
job, preferably with low risk.  

In case you haven't noticed, Portland has one of the highest
unemployment rates in the country.  Arguably, this is because
there are too many workers and not enough entrepreneurs.  What
jobs there are go to the lowest risk people - with demonstrated
track records, but not so old that they won't take orders.  Yes,
people with LOTS of experience are having trouble finding work,
too.  5 to 15 years of experience is probably the sweet spot.

If you can't "get a job", perhaps that means that you should be
creating them.  Finding a real-world problem that people will pay
to solve, and solving it.  Then hiring others to help you.  Chances
are, you don't want to go through that difficult and risky process. 
Well, welcome to Portland, where nobody else does either.

Providing open source solutions for problems, with demonstrably
much lower risk and lower effort for users/employers, would be
a good business.  Unfortunately, for most software people, the
failure occurs with the demonstration.  Microsoft succeeds
because they have good sales people peddling a marginally
acceptable product.  When members of the open source community
learn how to sell (and that starts with selling yourself) then
we will knock Microsoft off its pedestal.  

Open source software creation offers a great path to do this,
because you can write programs that solve problems and put them
out there for others to use and improve.  If you do it right,
you will develop the entrepreneurial and managerial skills and
the demonstrable track record that others are looking for. 
You might have to push a broom for a few years while you do 
the software work for free.  That is, earn the same amount that
Linus Torvalds earned over the first five years of Linux.

So - learn how to sell yourself.  There are books about that.
It involves replacing a lot of bad habits.  Once you learn how
to do that, perhaps you can develop an open source app that
trains others out of their job-repellent habits.  Programmer,
program thyself.

The fact that it is a rant is that it's oversimplified, nonsensical, and not very practical. 

Small-med biz's seem to use the std. MS suite (Windows, Exchange/Outlook, AD) with out much thought. And I get it as I was there
once. For many years I had to have MS Office, because MS Word/Excel were the penultimate apps. And I thought MS Win was the only viable
desktop OS. I paid for them ea. time a new vers came out and never got my money out of them. The biggest problem I have with MS prods is the 
kitchen sink feature set. I think it's safe to say that most people don't use a 10th of the feats.

It seems to me that for the most part there's not a lot of consulting that happens when small to med bizs implement MS prods. They buy it,
install it and set it up. When I said "customization", what I meant was to consult w. bizs. Understand their biz, work flowa, data needs, 
etc and then propose a solution that fits their needs. It might be that commercial closed source prods are the best solution for them. 

I want to live and work in a community that thinks about why and how they do things. What I'm getting at really is the process, or my 
perceived lack thereof, of selecting and implementing software for a biz. My personal approach is to look for the FOSS solution first. If it 
doesn't suit my needs or there's just a set of features that I just can't live without then go seek out a commercial closed source prod

Maybe I'm living in my own fantasy world, but what I envision is a bunch of independent IT consultants working together to provide solutions
for the bizs in this town. Such that maybe 1 person does the server / desktop OS, virtualization. Another person designs and implements the network. 
Another person does web dev. And another person puts in Asterisk VOIP. I like this vision of Portland and I will continue to walk around this
town with my rose colored glasses on...
 
As for saving money, I mostly mean around licensing fees and buying the new vers every time it comes out whether you have a justified need
for all the new whiz-bang feats or not.

I don't hate MS, but I stopped drinking their kool-aid a long time ago. Maybe I'm drunk on Linux/FOSS. It's not perfect by any means. But it
it makes so much sense to me and I believe in it.

I am part of a team with 21st century technology.  Last week I walked 
around the Portland SC09 supercomputer show, and spoke to lots of 
"high-power" people.  Many ran my badge for the email address.  Never 
heard a word back from anyone.

I suppose they thought I was a high-tech "lookie-loo"

Oh, btw, you need to have absolute commitment to your goals.

This is exactly why it has become so frustrating after a few years of trying to get a foot hold in the Linux/FOSS world. Over the past few yrs,
I've picked up a few small projs and worked for a few small startups as a Linux Sys Admin. But I've found it very difficult to move past this
point. I was hoping that having significant network engineering experience would offset those other short-comings, but it hasn't been the case. 

Each time I apply for a Linux Sys Admin job posting I fall short mostly because I don't have x many yrs of "on the job" experience w. a 
particular distro (Red Hat, Suse) or my lack of "on the job" scripting experience w. Bash, PHP, Perl.

My own guess is that most people not aware of/interested in things
technological don't view the computer or the software it runs as being
integrally involved in "why and how they do things."  All the
non-profits I've been involved with in the area are using Microsoft
products.  These are agencies that always go begging for money, devote
considerable resources to fundraising (some get government funds, some
do not), and in general are as likely to have laid staff off over the
past year as your typical small-to-mid-size for-profit business.
Almost all are passionate and clear-eyed about what they do, what they
see as their missions, and continually are re-examining and revamping
procedures, policies, structures, messaging, and everything else about
the "why and how" to accomplish their goals -- everything, that is,
except the technology they use.  If you ask them, "technology" means,
broadly, what social media websites/apps-of-the-month they might use
to help them help their clients or constituents or help them find more
donors.  That's as much as they think about it; Linux or FOSS isn't on
their radars.  I know of only one non-profit that got a computer from
Free Geek, and the guy who runs the non-profit promptly put out an
email appeal for funds to buy a Microsoft license for the box.

And, honestly, I can't think of a good reason why Linux/FOSS should be
on their radars, except that it would provide a generally better user
experience (IMO, of course -- not everyone would agree with that).
Unless or until someone comes along and shows them how much money they
could save using FOSS, or shows them something valuable they could do
with it that they can't do now, there is no reason for them to bother
with the time and expense of replacing their technology
infrastructure.

Recently, I started volunteering at TPI (Transitions Project, Inc.),
which runs three shelters in Portland.  On Sundays, I go in to the
shelter on Glisan and open up the resource room, which has four
Windows boxes the guys staying there can use.  (It's a 90-bed men's
shelter that provides housing for up to four months; 60% of the
residents are veterans.)  The computers are pretty slow -- they are
machines previously used by TPI staff that otherwise would have been
discarded -- but they work.  TPI could definitely get better machines
from Free Geek, but since resumes have to be in .doc format, I'm not
sure how much good that would do the residents.

What's stopping you from contact them?  Do you want to sell your product
or service, or are you satisfied with standing on a shelf next to every
other person whose badges they scanned?  Do you want to stand out, or
stand outside?

I sell pre-paid legal service plans, kind of like insurance.  But that
alone doesn't help me make money.  I have to go out and sell the
product, actively, putting me and my product in the foreground, because
customers will never come to me in the volume I need to make any
substantial income.  If I offered my badge for email scan, I would most
certainly get contact information from that person and add them to my
calling schedule.

And you are correct that one must be absolutely committed to their
product.  If you don't love it you will never convince anyone else to
love it.

So you've written the abstract for your business plan, although it needs 
a bit of cleaning up to be really diplomatic.

Where's the rest of it?

Note that if you really want to do a good job you'll probably have to 
develop some of that Microsoft expertise.  This is good and bad -- good, 
because these are perilous times and having the M$ expertise means easy 
money, bad, because you have to choke down all the training, good, 
because then you have the ammunition to counter what M$ says, bad -- 
well, you get the idea.

Mike Connor's post got me thinking.

His post was really about back-end and server stuff, while mine is about

If I ever decided to pursue more $$ and start hiring minions to do the

Linux-only shop.

Has anyone done the experiment (lately) of asking a bunch of experienced

On to my real question:

I really hate Windows.  I really, really hate the fact that I need to 
have it up and running sometimes (I have yet to fully break free from my 
accounting software which uses Explorer for navigation, and some 
microprocessor debugging tools only work under Windows).

It's about time to upgrade the Ubuntu in my work desktop; I'm thinking 
of wiping the whole thing clean and doing a fresh install, then 
installing VirtualBox (for which there's a native Ubuntu install!!) in 
which to run Windows XP for that dang accounting program and for those 
few proprietary chip debugging environments that just have to have Windows.

So:

Does anyone have any experience with VirtualBox?  How'd it go?  Any 
gotchas?  Anything I should know before I just start happily installing 
software?  Is there a way to import an already-working hard drive image, 
or do I just have to install Windows fresh in a new virtual machine?

http://www.possepdx.org , the Portland Open Source Software
Entrepreneurs, is an attempt at just that.  Members include 
multiperson shops Open Sourcery and Prostructure, a few open-source-
using businesses (like mine), and a few independent contractors.

POSSE suffers from (three guesses) poor marketing skills.  It
is difficult for an outsider to find the website and find
needed skills (Hint: google for "Portland Linux consultants"
and see what shows up).  They need to fill the roster with more
open-source-friendly businesses ( advertising, web hosting,
accounting, real estate, ... ) and develop some community, and
market themselves outside of the programmer geek community.
But hey, what they've done so far isn't bad for Aspie geeks.

It would not be difficult to set up a webpage that is mostly
a roster of available open source skills, a one-stop-shop for
contractors and consultants.  I maintain one of these for the IEEE
Oregon Consultants:  http://www.eeconsult.org/localconsultants.html
After repeated attempts to get POSSE to clone the mostly
automated process, I muttered "Software people.  Sheesh!" and
moved on to more productive activity.  But if someone from PLUG
wants to pursue a consultant's list, as part of a more usable
PLUG website, it would be a Good Thing.

There are lots of resume-building open source projects out there. 
Working with Wil Cooley to upgrade the PLUG website (or migrate
it), adding a web page of available PLUG members, helping local
businesses upgrade to open source, etc. would be great ways to
improve the hiring environment.  I've done a lot for PLUG because
I realize that it needs doing, and most of the other members are
too busy watching TV to do anything.  If the "I want a risk-free
paycheck" zombies killed their TVs and started doing some of
these unpaid jobs, this would lead to more paycheck Linux jobs. 
Guess who would be the most attractive and visible candidates?

This is exactly why it has become so frustrating after a few years of trying to get a foot hold in the Linux/FOSS world. Over the past few yrs,
I've picked up a few small projs and worked for a few small startups as a Linux Sys Admin. But I've found it very difficult to move past this
point. I was hoping that having significant network engineering experience would offset those other short-comings, but it hasn't been the case. 

Each time I apply for a Linux Sys Admin job posting I fall short mostly because I don't have x many yrs of "on the job" experience w. a 
particular distro (Red Hat, Suse) or my lack of "on the job" scripting experience w. Bash, PHP, Perl.

Are the everyday gen biz apps really that unfamiliar? Thunderbird, Firefox, Open Office are pretty darn similar not to mention IMO easier
because they don't throw a million feats at you.

Also, most desktop Linux distros look and function awfully familiar to MS Win. Now some other apps like Gimp, Scribus & Dia might have a bit 
of a learning curve.  

There has to be a decoupling from MS apps and a re-education. word processing != MS Word, Spreadsheets != Excel, Email != Outlook/Exchange.

I think what got MS where they are is by getting these everyday gen biz apps into as many work places as possible. And then the worker ants 
take the poison home to their friends and family.

Has anyone done a study on what feats most people actually use with MS prods? 

I'm not against MS per se. I'm against group think, default behavior, and this notion that there can't be viable alternatives. At my last 
"corporate job", I walked past dev & QA comps and saw them running FreeBSD, CentOS, Slackware, Debian/Ubuntu. I thought it was awesome...

I've been using it for a couple years, and generally speaking it works
quite well. I have a Win 2K guest and several Ubuntu guests, and they
all run happily.  The only issue I've had was related to VBox upgrades
(had difficulty reading drive images created by an older VBox
version).

The VBox GUI is pretty easy to use, and there's also a command-line
interface. Documentation is good, too. Make sure your host system has
plenty of RAM.

You'll need the VBox kernel module on your host system. Debian
provides the source in its own package, which can then be compiled and
installed via module-assistant. Also, the more RAM you have, the more
guests you can run simultaneously.

I don't know if there's an actual "import" feature, but I suppose you
could create a fresh drive image and Ghost your old Windows drive onto
it.

I would be really interested in hearing about your experience. Also, if you need a quiet person to carry stuff, move things, connect things,

And here I thought I had been so careful about proofreading my reply.
That should have read:

I use VBox.  You will find that the OSE version, included in the 
standard repositories, doesn't include USB support.  "Full" versions are 
available at virtualbox.org, and there is an Ubuntu repository.

Your current HD image only works in its current hardware environment.  
Mounting it in Vbox, which I don't believe is possible, puts it in a 
different environment.  But you could mount the image in Linux, add it 
as a VBox share (tools inside), then map it to your guest OS.  Or, you 
could back up your HD image using either a cross-platform tool or 
Windows backup, then restore from within the guest OS.

Keep in mind that XP requires at least 384MB dedicated RAM, so your host 
machine should have at least 1GB installed.  More if you want to 
actually do something outside the running guest.  Also, assign at least 
14MB to video if you want to switch to full screen mode.  Other than 
that, it's a pretty painless process to create a guest OS and boot from 
an install CD.

Let me add my $ .02 worth.

I run VBox in Ubuntu 9.04.  It runs  WinXP Pro in order to use Quicken.  
The laptop has 3 gig of memory.

The initial setup (a couple of Ubuntu vers. back) required some fiddling 
around to get USB up and running.  I think that is not the norm with the 
newer versions.  The 320 gig USB hard drive is a little slow getting up 
to speed once Win is running. Other than those few niggles VBox has run 
hassle free since I installed it, including the latest VBox maintenance 
upgrade.

I am far from any type of expert.  Others on this list will be able to 
offer much more guidance/advice.  Just wanted to relay my experience.

I too run VirtualBox under Ubuntu.  On Virtualbox, I run win2k, ecco,
quickbooks and quicken.  I take great care, to limit my vulnerability to
gotchas, so I backup each app's data to an external drive every time I use
it.  I don't email or web browse from win2k, so I don't even run virus
protection.  Since I am so careful, vbox has worked perfectly; I've never
had to use my backups.

The last time I set this up, my external usb drive wouldn't work on the
ubuntu apt-get version, so I downloaded the binary version from
virtualbox.org.  I've downloaded that a couple of times, and It installs
without much trouble.

Good Luck.

Several people have replied saying "it was hard to get USB up", and one 
has replied "you have to pay $$ to get the version that supports USB in 
the guest OS".

So -- does "hard to get USB up" mean that it's hard to get USB working 
in the _host_ OS, and there's no chance at getting it going in the 
_guest_ OS, or does it mean that you found a way to get it working in 
the guest OS, too.

('cause if I want to run those chip debuggers I mentioned, I'm going to 
have to have USB).

Thanks again.

VirtualBox works great in Ubuntu. I have Windows 2000 and Windows XP installed
as virtual machines. 

I recommend the open source edition (OSE), because it works fine and makes me
feel better. However, I have heard from others that some features don't work
for them in the OSE version. 

You will have to reinstall Windows in VirtualBox; I'm pretty sure it can't use
a disk image. If I'm wrong about that someone else will chime in, I'm sure. In
any event, installing Windows on VirtualBox is no more difficult than on a hard
disk.

As you noted, VirtualBox is listed in Synaptic, so just install it. When you
launch it the buttons are pretty clear, like click on "New" to create a new
virtual machine. There are dialog boxes with Forward and Back buttons to walk
you through the process.

When you get to the end of the dialog boxes your virtual machine will be
created, but Windows won't be installed yet. To install Windows just start your
virtual machine. This will give you a black window on your desktop that looks
just like a DOS black screen. Put the Windows install disk in your CD drive. In
a few moments the Windows installer screen will come up in the virtual machine
window. From there on the Windows installer will proceed exactly the same as if
you were installing it on a hard disk. That is because the magic in VirtualBox
creates a virtual C:\ drive, so Windows thinks it has a hard disk to install
itself on.

Once you get Windows installed you need to install the Guest Additions. The
Guest Additions allow seamless use of the mouse and allow you to change the
resolution in your virtual machine window. 

Either before or after installing Windows you need to go into the configuration
panel for your virtual machine (with the virtual machine not running) and
create shares for the folders on your Linux machine that you want Windows to be
able to access. Windows will see these as network shares. 

The only thing that doesn't work automatically is USB drives. You have to
insert the drive, let VirtualBox get its serial number, then enable it for the
virtual machine. From then on Windows will see it as soon as Linux does. There
can also be issues with other devices like scanners and cell phones. 

Printers have to be installed in Windows the same as if it was a standalone
operating system. Once the printer is set up in Windows you can print to it the
same as from a regular Windows installation. I mean the Windows driver will do
the imaging for the printer and the data is sent directly from Windows to the
printer. For example, on more than one occasion I couldn't get a PDF to print
from Adobe Reader 9.1 on Linux, but it will print fine from Adobe Reader 9.1 on
Windows because Windows processes the file with its own driver.

I recently discovered another cool thing. I have been installing different
distros lately. I discovered that my virtual machines and all their settings
are in a ~/.Virtualbox folder. So after I install a new distro I install
VirtualBox, then copy this folder from my old disk. When I launch VirtualBox in
the new distro, there are my virtual machines. I started them up and they were
identical to what I had previously. 

I have read a lot of discussions about the relative merits of VirtualBox v.
VMWare. The bottom line is that VMWare has more features that would be useful
if you are running a server. But for desktop users VirtualBox wins because it
is dead simple.

Download the free version for your distro...I think you said Ubuntu.  
AMD64 if that is your version of buntu...

http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads

This page has the setup you need for most of the popular linux distros.
USB required a little tweaking several versions back.  It was not 
difficult to do nor was it hard to find the forums discussing how to.

I have not used VirtualBox, though I intend to try it soon.  However,
I have used Qemu pretty extensively, since back when it was quite
unstable, and have had pretty good luck with it lately.  Note that
VirtualBox borrows a significant chunk of code from Qemu (from what I
understand).

Qemu does not have the USB restrictions of VirtualBox.  However,
that's no guarantee that every USB device will work in a guest.
Recently I was doing work with some cryptographic USB devices and I
could not get them to work in a Windows VM.  Windows saw the device,
but wouldn't play nice with it for whatever reason.

However, more common USB device types might be easier to deal with.
Of course if you're doing something exotic with USB, then there's
always the Qemu source to hack on to make it work.  Compiling from
Qemu development sources isn't too difficult.

Under Debian, you can install the qemu package for the base VM system,
or install the "kvm" package which is basically just qemu set up to
use the Linux kernel's kvm module.

I can't answer that definitively at the moment because I am on a new install of
OpenSuse 11.1 on a different hard disk and I haven't installed VirtualBox yet.
But I know that my Jaunty installation uses the OSE version and I could swear
that I had Windows seeing my thumb drive.

Also, I think the non-open source version is also free.

I should add that if you create shares on your Linux drive Windows can write
its data files directly to your Linux drive. The only files I leave in the
virtual machine are the Windows and application installation files. If I write
a letter in Windows I save it to my ~/ folder. Since all data that I create in
Windows is saved in my ~/ folder it gets backed up automatically when I back up
Linux. For that matter, the ~/.Virtualbox folder is also in your home folder,
so the whole virtual machine will also be backed up when you back up your home
folder.

Go ahead and install it. If you mess it up, just delete the virtual machine and
start over.

Message-ID: <1259707349.3156.6.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I'm still having trouble getting 2.6.27.39 to work with SLackware 10.1.

My initrd is created with this invocation:

mkinitrd -c -k 2.6.27.39 -m scsi_transport_api:aic7xxxx:jbd:ext3

I tried unzipping and mounting the initrd image, the modules are
there.  Looking in modules.dep I don't notice any other dependencies,
but maybe I am still missing something.

The aic7xxxx module loads and it says the partitions on the scsi
drive are sda1 sda2 < sda5 sda6 >.  So why when I get a kernel
panic does it say the only options are sda1 and sda2?  It looks
like the kernel isn't recognizing extended partitions at the
mount root stage.  What would cause the problem of not 
recognizing extending partitions?

Hi Mike,

 From the sounds of it you're interested/looking for a job in IT, 
particularly system administration. When I graduated from college 
(2003), Linux was just starting to establish itself in industry, and 
from my perspective back then there were only a few niches where you 
could potentially have a career working exclusively with Linux:

1. Kernel development
2. Compiler (gcc) development
3. Sysadmin/IT

I had some decent Linux sysadmin skills working for the university while 
I was finishing my degree, and assumed that was going to be my default 
career.

It turned out that having a solid background in sysadmin skills, 
especially knowing how to customize Linux distros to act as appliances, 
set me up well for jobs working on embedded systems. While I have 
occasionally had to do some serious C development and customization of a 
kernel module or two, the vast majority of my time has been spent 
leveraging my higher-level OS knowledge and working with scripting 
languages and web technologies (particularly for user interfaces).

I just wanted to suggest this as another possible avenue you could be 
looking down in terms of finding work you can do exclusively with Linux. 
Best of all, many single board computing platforms are cheap enough to 
collect and start working on side projects of your own to build these 
skills and build a portfolio of sorts of interesting things you have 
worked on.

If there is some way you could bring in to an interview a device or demo 
project you have worked on, whether it is a commercial product or not, 
you are sure to make big impressions on a potential employer.

Just some thoughts,

Scott

I have yet to attend a POSSE meeting, but hope to soon. Thanks for 
reminding me about them.

I thought I would throw out here that I am very interested in meeting up 
with folks doing or considering startups which make use Linux as a core 
technology; particularly in the embedded space. I've only lived in 
Portland not quite a year now, and miss many of the interactions I had 
with friends who were doing startups back East. I have personally also 
set up an LLC, spent a year building a product, and never got past the 
point of having a handful of beta users, so I can sympathize with a lot 
of the stresses and uncertainty that this endeavor creates.

Scott, thanks for your thoughts. Embedded Linux systems are of great interest to me. With my Networking Engineering background I know
that many network equip vendors are running Linux now. I've tinkered around a bit w. DDRT and OpenWRT. Robotics is also interesting as I have
a background in electronics too. 

I once thought about building a bunch of Linux boxes running diff distros, networking them together, and then start tinkering with all the neat
apps and tech. Maybe I should do this and create a web page documenting the stuff I've done.

Big hint is, don't use the old root= option with loadlin or your
2.6 kernel won't boot.  Why this is is beyond me.  

Now If I could just figure out why I'm getting an IO error from 
card manager for my ISA pcmcia card adapter.

Another mystery has popped up.  When I try to compile source
code for a realtek 8180 wireless card it looks at the kernel source
directory and then it deletes the source code and errs out.  Same
thing happens with qc-usb-0.6.6 source code.  Is the source deleting
because these drivers are kernel options now?

So I'm back at 2.6.10, groan.

Is there much going on with POSSE these days? I remember stumbling across it 2 yrs ago when I landed in Portland and it didn't see much
activity on the site except for the occasional tumbleweed...

Scott - I would be very interested in meeting up to talk about startups or just to geek out on Linux projs. Maybe something more informal
and hands-on than the PLUG meetings and more about what you can do w. Linux than happens at the Linux Clinic.

I'm game. Let's let things settle for a few days and see if anyone else 
is interested, and think about how we can get something moving. I seem 
to recall there are other hardware hacking/hands-on groups (Dorkbot?) in 
the area and that might be a good venue to jump into.

I'm interested in meeting with all who want to promote Linux usage to the
general public.

I can hear the moans and groans of disgust already. However, I use 
Tweetdeck and run a keyword search on Linux to keep up w. what's 
happening in the Linux-sphere. Is anyone else actively using Twitter for 
this? Are there particular people or orgs that you follow?

I used to use RSS for this but I didn't like any of the apps nor 
managing all the feeds. I also subscribe to quite a few Linux groups on 
Linkedin, but there's a high noise to signal ratio.

There are many people who share your fantasy; and I believe there are
and have been quite a few groups around doing this very thing.  Of
course, there are many different ways of organizing these.  Some of
the groups specialize in serving a particular industry.  Others serve
a broader customer base in a more limited geographic area.

In any case, if you are interested in doing something like this I
would check around to see if you might fit into some existing group
such as POSSE or OpenSourcery or one of many others; and if you can't
find an existing group then I would suggest getting together with a
number of other potential independent IT consultants and starting
something.  Also, although you might first explore this with some
potential independent IT consultants I wouldn't restrict it to
potential independent IT consultants for very long; because you will
also need people with marketing and sales and finance skills.

Subject: [PLUG] automatic running of ntpdate
Message-ID: <f72d4c6a0912012013n628ad0ccn8dc90cd636e71c21@mail.gmail.com>

Related to my long dialog about ntpdate, I found two types of entries in syslog:
Those caused by a script related to if_up:
Dec  1 10:30:05 R2D4 ntpdate[3316]: step time server 74.207.251.121
offset 0.407052 sec

And those of an unknown cause:
Dec  1 12:00:21 R2D4 ntpdate[6823]: step-systime: Operation not permitted

The first type is the default invocation in ubuntu. It invariably
reports an offset of in the order of .5 seconds.  Yet when I run the
command from a terminal the offset is near zero.  This seems strange.
One possibility is that ubuntu does not set the hardware clock to the
system clock on exit.  How can I explore this?

About the second type,  I am trying to find what precipitates it.
What does it mean?  I have searched for files in /etc containing the
text ntpdate, but have come up with nothing which seems to execute
ntpdate except /etc/network/if-up.d/ntpdate.  I thought that the noon
time was significant, but an identical entry appeared at around 1829.

Ideas on how to crack this nut?

>From my research, the 2nd entry can be caused by 1 of 2 things. Either another ntp daemon is running when ntpdate attempts to step the 
system time. See below:

ntpdate will decline to set the date if an NTP server daemon (e.g., ntpd) is running on the same host.

Or if you're using ntpdate on a virtual server.

With decently fast hardware, you don't need a bunch of boxes - you
can do this with virtual machines, just like the Big Kids that 
develop distros.  I think it would be way cool to build a host
with virtualized guests for every major distro out there.  It
might need a terabit of RAM, but that would be cheaper and lower
power than all the separate boxes.  At very least, you could
load perhaps 16 virtuals at a time, and smoke test software
in a lot of different distros automagically.

True. I wasn't implying they would all be physical. Maybe a few physical boxes with a 
handful of VMs on ea. What's really nice about VM Ware is their community contributed 
appliances. I don't think Virtual Box supports this. Also, with VM Ware you can have 
comparable physical networking functionality between VM's with Cisco's dist. virt switch 
or Vyatta.

You can do it all on Linux with KVM, libvirt and virt-manager without vmware.
While you are at it setup a NAS box serving up iSCSI for the storage.

When I do a twitter search, the RSS link at the bottom of the page
drops nicely into Google Reader.  I'm probably following ten different

Most websites appear pretty inactive. Even the PLUG website sees a rare
update. The real action is on the mailing lists and at the meetings. You
just have to get out there to see it.

I'm guessing 8 GB might be sufficient for 16 virtuals - for one of those
"bare metal" servers such as VMware ESXi 4.0. This assumes no heavy RAM
intensive apps such as X11. 

And are there more than 8 distros worth testing on such a box? (what
comes to mind: RHEL, Fedora, SLES, openSUSE, Ubuntu, Mandriva,
Slackware, Gentoo, maybe Xandros)

I would vote for a BSD or two and even (gasp) opensolaris as well.  have a Gnome, a KDE, Xfce, a *box, maybe even ratpoison for DE/WM.

ntpd is not installed. I searched in synaptic and found nothing
installed save ntpdate and ntpdate-debian containing the letters ntp.
Besides, doesn't the 2nd type log entry mean that the executable
ntpdate was launched? By what? A virtual server?  I have to confess I
have no idea what this means.  I do have VirtualBox, but not running.
I assume you mean something more esoteric that VB.

BTW, the time offset in the log this AM is near 1 second.  So my idea
that the kernel is not setting the hardware clock on shutdown is
looking more plausible.

hah, if people started testing their apps with ratpoison (which is all
i use these days), i'd have a lot less "fun" figuring out how to make
apps behave well when all their WM_HINTS and geometry specifications

I can't offer much without context (i.e. what's $local?), and from previous
discussions, your network setups are often baroque.  That said, that
doesn't look right.  You're NATing the dest port but not the dest IP, so
I'd imagine the packet still gets routed instead of hitting the proxy.

Kernel version shouldn't matter here - it's an ordinary NAT operation.

Did you follow a current HOWTO on tranparent proxying?  Did you search the
web before asking?  When did you last attend a PLUG meeting or clinic?

Thanks,

   I swapped the wireless radios in the Toshiba Satellite from Realtek to
Intel. After the system booted the network icon told me there are no wired
or wireless networks available. My assumption is that the system did not
automatically recognize the hardware change so it's still loading the
Realtek driver rather than the Intel one, a Pro 3945A/B/G.

   Do the ubuntus have a menu selection that I can invoke to have it seek new
hardware, recognize the new wireless card, and load the correct driver? Or,
do I do this manually with modprobe and/or an entry in /etc/rc.local?

Subject: [PLUG] Virtualbox kernel issue
Message-ID: <20091202121138.77bd0556@mailhost.pdx.edu>

After three days of struggling OpenSuse (most pathetic package management
ever), last night I gave up and installed Fedora 11. All has gone well and no
problems with Gnome so far.

I am trying to get Virtualbox installed as it was on Jaunty. I started by
copying the ~/.Virtualbox folder (18 GB) to my new ~/. Then I installed
Virtualbox. It's not in the Fedora 11 repositories, so I downloaded the RPM
for 3.0.8 from Sun. I tried 3.1.2 and 3.1.0, but the downloads failed
repeatedly. I'm sure 3.0.8 will be fine.

Then I launched Vitualbox. After the Sun license agreement it offered to
migrate my settings from the older version that I had been using on Jaunty. And
when it finished, there were my virtual machines, exactly as before. Yay!

But the bad news is that Windows 2000 won't start. The error message is that I
need to do #/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup. And when I issued that command I got:

Makefile:147: *** Error: unable to find the sources of your current Linux
kernel. Specify KERN_DIR=<directory> and run Make$

Now I'm stumped. 

In the past (Ubuntu days) occasionally Virtualbox would refuse to run a virtual
machine until I installed new Virtualbox headers (or something) because there
had been a kernel update. It was easy to fix - just open Synaptic, search on
Virtualbox and there would be the vbox kernel file. However, Fedora doesn't
show such options; probably because I installed it from the RPM.

The kernel I am running is 2.6.29.4-167.fc11.x86_64. If I search the filesystem
I find four files with the kernel numbers located in /boot:

System.map-2.6.29.4-167.fc11.x86_64
config-2.6.29.4-167.fc11.x86_64
initrd-2.6.29.4-167.fc11.x86_64
vmlinuz-2.6.29.4-167.fc11.x86_64

There is also a kernel-2.6.29.4-167.fc11.x86_64 in /etc/ld.so.conf.d, and a
folder in /lib/modules. 

If anyone is running Virtualbox on Fedora, I could use some clues.

If you have a proxy service on the same machine then your rule looks 
mostly correct w. the the exception of the missing "-i 
incominginterface", "-p tcp" options.

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i incomminginterface -s sourceip -p tcp 
--dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port proxyport

If you have a proxy in different machine then you're not using the 
correct rule:

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i incominginterface -p tcp --dport 80 -j 
DNAT --to proxyip:proxyport

Have you actually installed the kernel source files?  What is in /usr/src?

Hello

I run VirtualBox on Fedora as both host and guest OS (WinXP as other host or
guest, as well as several other Linux flavors)

In Fedora, you probably want to install kernel-devel and kernel-headers
packages, as well as gcc.
It needs all the extra libs and includes from that to compile the vbox
modules.

You can do this to see if you have them already:

rpm -qa | grep kernel

Mine has:
kernel-xyz
kernel-headers-xyz
kernel-devel-xyz
(xyz being the current version number)

There is a lot of stuff in /usr/src, but nothing that looks like a kernel
source file. There is a vboxdrv-3.0.8 link to another folder. 

I also looked in Add/Remove Software, but couldn't find anything that looked
like a kernel source to install. The Add/Remove Software GUI is not easy to
find things in unless you know exactly the name of the package you are looking
for.

I didn't have the kernel-headers, but I do now. I also installed gcc. But the
setup command still fails.

Someone on a Fedora list said he fixed the problem by installing the OSE
version of Virtualbox instead of the one from Sun. However, he didn't say what
repository it was located in and I do not find it in my default repository list.

As I mentioned in another post, you want to install the kernel-devel and
kernel-headers RPMs.

Do this:

sudo yum install kernel-headers kernel-devel

Yes I did search the web and quite frankly most HOWTOs I hit are old or
they are for the 2.4 kernel.

Subject: [PLUG] Restart CUPS on Fedora 11
Message-ID: <20091202154300.2d93a985@mailhost.pdx.edu>

All my printers are networked via ethernet. I have an ancient desktop Laserjet
4 Plus whose IP address is 192.168.0.15. I can ping it fine. But I can't seem
to send a print job to it.

First, I migrated all my printer setups from my old Ubuntu hard disk. I did
this by copying /etc/init.d/cups/cups.conf and the entire contents of the ppd
folder. I also restarted the computer. The printers appear in the Printer
configuration window. I can send a test page to it from any of the three
drivers that I have installed, and the test page appears in the print queue.
However, in the print queue it is listed as pending.

The printer is enabled, accepting jobs. I can't find anything wrong in the GUI
for the driver properties. However, looking at top the cupsd service is not
running. I thought you started and stopped CUPS with

/etc/init.d/cups/ ./cups stop/start

But that does not work, and there doesn't seem to be any executable files in
the folder anyway. I know in top when it is running it is listed as cupsd, but
that doesn't work either.

I have also restarted the computer, but the cupsd service is still not running.
I think it is supposed to start automatically whenever an app sends a print job
to a printer, but I'm not sure about that.

I really need to get my printers working ASAP.

find /etc/init.d -name "*cups*"

the results should give you something you can then run with a "start" at the
end to get it going, for example:

/etc/init.d/rc5.d/S09cups start

if the results of the find command are null, then you likely don't have cups
installed.

good luck.

the no server suitable for sync error is most likely the result of the
configuration file for ntpdate.  check /etc/default/ntpdate and ensure that
the line:

NTPDATE_USE_NTP_CONF=yes

is set to:

NTPDATE_USE_NTP_CONF=no

and then try ntpdate sync

If you are using ntpd then disregard this message

I think you missed my summary of this issue, posted on Nov. 30.  Here
it is repeated.

To recap:  I wanted to keep my system clock reasonably correct.  I
understood that ubuntu runs ntpdate at boot by default.  It was not
happening.  Two reasons:

1) /etc/default/ntpdate has a line NTPDATE_USE_NTP_CONF=yes, which
causes ntpdate to go to /etc/ntp.conf for the server list.  ntpd is
not installed,( again, the default condition), so /etc/ntp.conf does
not exist.  Changing the statement to NTPDATE_USE_NTP_CONF=no causes
ntpdate to use the server list following in
NTPSERVERS="ntp.ubuntu.com".

2) My dsl modem was blocking port 124, so ntpdate could not reach any
servers.  Option -u on ntpdate forces use of an unprivileged port, so
servers can be reached.

I learned some stuff about ntp servers, my modem, anacron, and ubuntu.
 I never tested whether the default server ntp.ubuntu.com actually
worked, since I had expert advice on choice of servers.

Thanks to all who helped me navigate the maze.

Make sure to use the latest version from www.virtualbox.org via Apt (
http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads) or building the vboxdrv will
irritate you to no end.  I would not recommend using the package that comes
with Ubuntu.

I have been using Virtualbox for a long time and am very happy with it.
There may be times when VirtualBox and even VMWare are not able to properly
load mass storage drivers (IPods for example).

Sharing your local filesystem folders/directories into Vbox are really easy
and does not require the extra trickery as VMWare.

If you can manage to get your current Windows image backed up or snapshot to
a valid Vbox image then you should be able to import it fairly easily.

There is a trick to get USB devices working and identified properly in
VirtualBox on Ubuntu and Debian, the solution can be googled pretty easy.
Here is a useful link for the USB devices being greyed out (
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=341740&page=4).  Also make sure
that your user account is added into the vboxusers and usbfs groups.

This AM the log showed an offset of 0.366 seconds, so it looks like
the hardware clock was reset.  Is it possible that the hardware clock
is reset (on shutdown) to the nearest second?  That would account for
the offsets bouncing around, but staying under 1 second.

I think Mike got you the right answer, but iptables's basic features on 2.4

Thanks for the suggestion. I couldn't find the kernel-headers in the Manage

Unfortunately, I still can't get the vboxdrv setup command to work.

I meant, first cd to /etc/init.d/cups/ and then do either ./cups stop or ./cups

Well, the ./cups start command did not work. But the service command did the
job. I just printed a test page and all appears well.

However, there remains the question why CUPS stopped in the first place. I had
rebooted the computer, so if it starts on boot, then it should have been
running. Or if it starts only when the user sends a print job, it still should
have been started when I sent numerous test pages to the printer.

By sheer coincidence the Fedora Update Manager popped up just before I checked
mail. There were 35 updates, and two of them involved CUPS. I had just applied
the updates, and a few minutes later did the service command.

Here's an excellent article on system clock, hardware clock, and NTP.
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareClock

What I gleaned from it:
The OS stores(shutdown) and retrieves(bootup) system time from the hardware clock. 
At bootup after the system clock is set per the hw clock, it's going to query an NTP 
server via ntpdate for a more accurate time setting.

Although the hw clock can keep time, it's not as accurate as any level of stratum (1-4) clock.
It "free runs" w/o a reference source. So I would expect small stepping like this to occur,
especially if you're only syncing the time once a day.

* Interesting factoid: A GPS receiver can be used as a Stratum 1 clock source.

on my jaunty system which has the Sun version of Virtual box I do:
> uname -a
Linux gauss 2.6.28-16-generic #57-Ubuntu SMP Wed Nov 11 09:47:24 UTC 2009
i686 GNU/Linux
(I then check /usr/src)
> ls /usr/src
(and see the directory)
linux-headers-2.6.28-16-generic
(and so my Virtual Box installs)
(you will probably need it for other packages, so persevere; find the rpm
that furnishes the directory corresponding to uname -a)

Data:  ntpdate runs during boot and logs an offset of something from
.3 to .9 seconds.  A short time after boot runing ntpdate from the
command line reports an offset of .00##--something close to zero.
Shutdown and reboot shortly later, ntpdate runs during boot and logs
an offset of something from .3 to .9 seconds. Repeat as desired.

I take this to mean that 1) the hardware clock was not synchronized
better than 1 second on shutdown, or 2) the hardware clock gets bumped
during the shutdown/reboot cycle, or 3) the hardware clock is unstable
in the extreme, or 4) the system clock gets set to the rtc to within 1
second on boot.  1) and 4) seem to me to be effectively the same
thing.

I vote for 4), because I find in the logs:
Dec  2 17:58:46 R2D4 kernel: [    3.906800] rtc_cmos 00:08: setting
system clock to 2009-12-03 01:58:34 UTC (1259805514)

If it were set more accurately than the nearest second why would it
not show in the log?

Yes, I found out that my dansguardian exceptions were disabling the
filter.  I rectified that.  I added the incoming interface to my 
redirect rule, though I don't know why that is needed.

I did read something about doing this a different way and a patch
for the 2.6 kernels, but I haven't found out anything more.  I
think the new approach involves using the mangle table somehow.
It was on I think kernelhq.org, so I'm sure this other method 
is legit.

Message-ID: <962ef3c60912022159u2b159d00he9f307627411e570@mail.gmail.com>

I'm looking for pointers to locate/setup a shared/collab. multi-user
system much like "Dynamo" I've stumbled across.
( Academic demo vid: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8dzK0Q1r5g )

It seems they used to have a Java & C++ download available but I can't
locate it (and it ran atop Windows anyway).
Archive.org was frustrating and their domain has long since gone to the jackals.

I know you can make multi-seat X on 1 box - but those that I'm aware
of are more like separate terminals.
Specifically being able to control multiple independent cursors on the
same screen is what I'd like.

[Also I'm not really looking for a "Surface" as the wireless
keyboard+mouse setup fits better for my intended use
than playing hand-hockey on a table. The logical interaction yes - physical no.]

Why wouldn't the output from the NTPDATE command be close to zero shortly 
after ntpdate just adjusted the system clock to an ntp server? It's a 
highly accurate clock source and the system clock doesn't drift as much as 
the hwclock.

If you don't believe the hwclock is unstable, just run the "hwclock"
command a few times in a row and you'll see the drift:

root at mc-goose:/var/log# hwclock
Wed 02 Dec 2009 11:22:27 PM PST  -0.859939 seconds
root at mc-goose:/var/log# hwclock
Wed 02 Dec 2009 11:22:28 PM PST  -0.094328 seconds
root at mc-goose:/var/log# hwclock
Wed 02 Dec 2009 11:22:30 PM PST  -0.719333 seconds
root at mc-goose:/var/log# hwclock
Wed 02 Dec 2009 11:22:31 PM PST  -0.281826 seconds
root at mc-goose:/var/log# hwclock
Wed 02 Dec 2009 11:22:33 PM PST  -0.625572 seconds


The  System  Time  is the time that matters. The hwclock's purpose 
is to keep time when Linux is not running. The System Time is initialized by
the time from the hwclock when Linux starts up, and then never use the hwclock again. 


Here's some debug output that shows hwclock after 
reboot:

root at mc-goose:~# hwclock -D
hwclock from util-linux-ng 2.16.1
Using /dev interface to clock.
Last drift adjustment done at 1259827578 seconds after 1969
Last calibration done at 1259827578 seconds after 1969
Hardware clock is on local time
Assuming hardware clock is kept in local time.
Waiting for clock tick...
...got clock tick
Time read from Hardware Clock: 2009/12/03 00:08:18
Hw clock time : 2009/12/03 00:08:18 = 1259827698 seconds since 1969
Thu 03 Dec 2009 12:08:18 AM PST  -0.666495 seconds

I did find some info that the hwclock doesn't make adjustments for 
drift < 1 sec. 

"A  small  amount of error creeps in any time hwclock sets the clock, so
it refrains from making an adjustment that would be less than 1 second.
Later  on,  when you request an adjustment again, the accumulated drift
will be more than a second and hwclock will do the adjustment then.

It is good to do a hwclock --adjust just before the  hwclock  --hctosys
at system startup time, and maybe periodically while the system is run-
ning via cron.

The adjtime file, while named for its historical purpose of controlling
adjustments  only,  actually  contains  other  information  for  use by
hwclock in remembering information from one invocation to the next."

I totally agree.

Anyone looking for opportunities of any type need to get out and talk with
people in person.  And they need to talk with engineers and line managers
and people who actually do the work of an organization  - not people in HR
departments.

It always has been that way and always will be.

P.S.  I don't mean to bad mouth HR departments.  They do valuable work;
but they aren't where new jobs are created - especially interesting jobs.

Well, to some people those HR jobs *are* the interesting ones. People who
love working with people and figuring out the puzzle that is human
interactions.

But don't worry, I personally wasn't offended. I just know some wonderful,
very smart people who work in HR, and I know that they love their jobs and
all the problems and rewards that come with them.

But I also agree that for me, the HR department is not the interesting part
of it. Just being devil's advocate, I guess?

It takes all types.

I'm sure David will correct me if I'm wrong. But I think what he meant was that
HR for the most part doesn't "create jobs/work". They're mostly tasked w. filling
new reqs. It's the line managers, engineers, and project managers who create 
jobs/work. I always try to deal directly w. the hiring manager if I can.

What do people know about this project?  Apparently, the goal is to
extend the Linux kernel so that it is possible to run some Windows
programs natively.  I found out about it checking on the ReactOS
forums to see if anything positive had been posted.

One of the complaints about Linux is that it doesn't support 3D hardware
acceleration very often.  Why hasn't a company come out to design 3D
video cards specifically for Linux?  It seems like there is a real
business opportunity here.  I'm not an EE so I wouldn't be the one
to design video cards for Linux, but I'm sure someone is.  Owning a
licensed copy of Dirk Dashing and Rick Rocket, it is certainly 
possible to write games for Linux that people want to play.  I'm
thinking though that 3D hardware acceleration would be great for
CAD and CNC software as well.

I'm a little concerned about the idea that Linux should be able to
run Windows software natively.  I wonder if the efforts to have
Linux pretend to be Windows wouldn't be better spent writing 
replacement software that is meant for Linux in the first place?

I admit I was a bit spooked and skeptical about this when I had 1st 
heard about it. Mostly because of the way bloggers were painting the 
picture. 

My current understanding is that it's a seperate Open Source Project
to create a new kernel, not extend the existing one, by
porting key feats of the Win kernel into the Linux kernel.

I would venture to guess this would be offered as a separate optionally 
kernel for quite a while before potentially becoming the new mainline kernel.

One of the biggest barriers to mainstream Linux adoption is being happy
with Linux/FOSS alternatives to MS Win apps or the the inconvenience of 
having to run apps in WINE.

To the best of my understanding, the problem isn't with the 
video cards, but with the drivers. Many vendors don't provide
open source drivers, which isn't a problem for some distros that 
provide proprietary drivers. Unlike Debian, which is militant
about only putting unencumbered sw in their repos.

So what Linux users are left with is devs trying to build FOSS drivers by
reverse engineering proprietary drivers. There always a few steps behind
and the driver 3D functionality isn't an exact replica of the proprietary
driver.

find your cups.log and see if it says anything interesting.

and/or, look up how to enable a service to start on boot for your current
distro. maybe it just isn't set up to on yours.

Have you looked at https://help.ubuntu.com pages?

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessTroubleShootingGuide

I'm fairly new to using Ubuntu so I'm still learning the system but I was able 
to upgrade my laptop from Ubuntu from 9.04 to 9.10.

You are right it is the drivers.  With most hardware, I find the open
source drivers eventually far outstrip any closed source proprietary
ones (thinking network, disk, etc) because the open source ones
integrate properly with other changes in the kernel and are actually
maintained over the years to get the bugs teased out.  Most commercial
drivers are updated a few times (at best on Linux) and then dropped.

However with 3D hardware, it is a bit different because the hardware
is changing so fast.  This has long been a frustration of mine, but I
am more optimistic now that Linux will catch up significantly over the
next few years.  Mostly, because of the progress I see in the open
source ATI drivers after AMD released the specs.  No, 3D support still
isn't there in many newer cards, but there are a couple of parallel
projects working on it, sharing code, and there seems to be momentum.  

Until nVidia releases their specs, I'm buying ATI myself.  If other
Linux geeks do the same, perhaps nVidia will eventually feel some
pressure to do that.

Denis,

You might want to look in to using adjtimex(8) and hwclock(8) to keep
your hardware clock reasonably accurate for those times when you can't
be connected to the Net.  I used them with my first laptop.
Essentially, you create a correction factor for the hardware clock
and store it to disk.  Then you use it to periodically adjust the
values in the hardware clock.  (Much simpler than trying to adjust
the hardware! :-) )  I found that the hardware clock became about as
accurate as my digital wristwatch -- about a second of drift per
month.  Good enough for most purposes, I'd think. It does take time to
get the thing trained (I wound up leaving my laptop running for a week
at one point), but it does work.  I also had to modify the bootup and
shutdown scripts slightly so that things ran the way that I needed.  

Just a thought.

Lots of errors, frequently repeated as I tried to send test pages. For example:

copy_model: empty PPD file!
Unable to execute /usr/lib/cups/backend/hp: No such file or directory
Stopping job because the sheduler could not execute the backend. 
Unable to execute /usr/lib/cups/backend/hp: No such file or directory
(/usr/lib/cups/filter/foomatic-rip) crashed on signal 13! 
(/usr/lib/cups/filter/pstops) crashed on signal 13! 
[cups-driverd] Bad driver information file
"/usr/share/cups/model/foomatic-db-ppds/Kyocera/ReadMe.htm"!

The last one is really interesting, because I don't own a Kyocera printer. And
I don't understand the empty PPD file message because the PPD files all look
fine in Gedit. The rest I don't understand at all.

Google informed me that CUPS starts on boot, and then nods off until a user
wakes it up.

The last time I did this was when I did my first new install of Debian Testing
a month ago. I asked on the CUPS e-list and received these instructions:

---------
> Can I migrate the printers installed in Jaunty to a new, fresh install
> of Debian testing (Squeeze)?

You could try the following steps:

(1) make shure your new installation has at least all the filters and 
backends of your old CUPS installation. If not, install the missing ones
(maybe it is sufficient to copy the binaries over, but there is no 
guarantee).
(2) stop the running CUPS
(3) copy your old /etc/cups/printers.conf to the new installation
(4) copy the complete contents of your old /etc/cups/ppd directory to the 
new installation
(5) start your new CUPS
(6) see what happens.

It might be that you need to do some tweaking afterwards, but the bulk of 
your old work should have been retained.
-----------

With Squeeze I followed the above instructions and all my printers just worked.
So now with Fedora 11 I did the same thing, but something has gone slightly
awry.

On the list of today's festivities is making sure the rest of the printers are
working.

This is very interesting.  But I do not think that the "-0.nnnnnn
seconds" numbers represents random noise in the Hardware Clock's
time-keeping.  The man page does not explain what that final number
means, but I think it is a refinement of the displayed time--the
displayed time is only to the nearest second.  I cannot believe that a
quartz crystal oscillator could have deviations in the order of a
second over a time of a few seconds.  Another test shows something a
little different:

sudo hwclock --show ; sudo hwclock --show; sudo hwclock; sudo hwclock --show
Thu 03 Dec 2009 09:52:59 AM PST  -0.347595 seconds
Thu 03 Dec 2009 09:53:00 AM PST  -0.987145 seconds
Thu 03 Dec 2009 09:53:01 AM PST  -0.987157 seconds
Thu 03 Dec 2009 09:53:02 AM PST  -0.985207 seconds

Notice that when the time of invocation of the command is predictable,
the seconds are stable to the order of 0.002 seconds.

I believe the offset displayed by ntpdate is due to hwclock not making
adjustments < 1 second, as you pointed out.

For my system, since I run ntpdate at boot, and I boot at least every
day, I should be fine.  if I wanted to determine the drift of my rtc,
I would stop running ntpdate at boot for a week or more, then check to
see how far the rtc had drifted.  My suspicion is that it is
reasonable, since only recently have I gotten ntpdate to run at boot.
I noticed the problem when the clock was off by about 5 minutes after
6 months.

All fixed.

The problem was that Fedora 11 did not install any printer drivers. Apparently
Debian Testing did. Furthermore, even after installing the driver from
Add/Remove Software I discovered that the drivers I had just installed were not
the same drivers as I had used before. So I had to go into each printer and
change the drivers.

In a way it was good because it made me delete a couple printers that I never
use, and re-label the rest so I could keep track of them more easily. Now the
label in the CUPS GUI utility matches the internal names, so when I want to use
lpr I can tell more easily what the name of the printer is for the -P option.

I also discovered a couple cool little Gtk tools. One is a print job manager
that is much nicer than the one from CUPS. The other is a GUI front end for the
lp command. I can just select the printer from a drop-down, and browse for the
file I want to print. All the rest of the options are just clickable too.

I don't use net-snmp, but I have used snmp quite a bit and have
a fairly solid grasp of it.

Your Linksys WAP probably supports v.1, v.2, and v.3 of the SNMP protocol.

5.5 is the rev of the net-snmp software not the SNMP protocol itself.
And the current net-snmp package supports the original SNMPv1, 
Community-based SNMPv2 (i.e. RFCs 1901-1908), and SNMPv3 (i.e. RFCs 
3411-3418).

Just out of curiosity what are you hoping to gain by collecting snmp 
traps from your Linksys WAP? I ask because I personally can't think of 
any good reason I would want to spend the time and effort to set this up 
for my WAP except for maybe wanting to tinker w. SNMP. Which isn't to me 
really all that interesting anyway...

Message-ID: <20091203213722.12a50ea6@mailhost.pdx.edu>

In Rhythmbox on my desktop I have a playlist of over 50 classical music stations
around the world. I wish to use the same list with Rhythmbox on my Fedora 11
laptop. 

There exists a rhythmboxdb.xml file in ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/, but it
contains every song that you have ever played, including local mp3 files. At
the very end it has the list of radio stations with the header "iradio" at the
start of each entry.

I need to delete everything except the "iradio" entries and save the file as a
new XML file. I can open the file in OOo Writer, but Writer can't figure out
how to save it as an XML file. Ditto for Gedit.

Is there a simple XML editor that I can use for this task? Alternatively, is
there a different music player that can import this playlist?

Emacs and vim are both excellent choices.

I use Bluefish editor for this kind of stuff. I believe Banshee replaced 
Rhythmbox
as the default music player in Karmic. It has a Rhythmbox migrator which 
can import your Rhythmbox collection, including ratings, play counts, 
and playlists.

According to what I read, Rhythmbox is no longer being developed. I installed
Banshee, but I can't find any way to migrate Rhythmbox collections. There is a
File > Import Playlist, but it is looking for some kind of file other than
an .xml file.

Hmm, it's my understanding that the rhythmboxdb.xml file is for the rhythmbox database?
Is this file not meant to be imported into other music players, but just for backup/restore
purposes?

Is this what's generated when you an export from Rhythmbox? 

Everything I read about importing in Banshee makes it sound so dead simple. I don't get it?

Yup. Rebooted. Logged in. No metacity.

This is Fedora 11 with Gnome 2.26.3.

Since the last time I rebooted and logged in (a couple hours ago) I tried to
get Rhythmbox to see the playlist file from Rhythmbox on my desktop computer
(unsuccessfully), installed Banshee, uninstalled Virtualbox from Sun, installed
Virtualbox OSE. Virtualbox OSE would not start any guests until I rebooted. So
I rebooted, and then I landed without a window manager.

This is the fifth time this has happened.

(1) and (2) were Debian Testing, (3) was Fedora 12, (4) was OpenSuse 11.2.

But Virtualbox OSE does start my guests. One problem solved, bigger problem
created.

As soon as I send this I'm going to uninstall Virtualbox OSE and reboot.

I haven't worked much with SNMP traps (they don't do much that I've found
useful), but you might start with pulling SNMP data.

A good start would be "snmpwalk -v2c -c public <router address>"

You might also try "snmptable -v2c -c public <router address> IF"

Good luck,
  Aaron

As far as I can tell, you just can't export a playlist from Rhythmbox. There is
the rhythmboxdb.xml file, which contains the data, but nothing else can read it.

That is, I can open the rhythmboxdb.xml file in a simple text editor and see
the URLS and names of the radio stations. Considering the time I've spent, it
would be faster to copy and paste twice for each station into Banshee.

But before I do it I want to be sure that Banshee can export its playlist file
in a format that other media players can read. Once burned, twice cautious.

Having deleted Virtualbox OSE and rebooted, I still have no window manager. So
it wasn't Virtualbox OSE that caused it.

I don't remember if anyone asked this before -- what happens if you
run metacity from a terminal in X when you don't have a window
manager?

You *may* need to find the metacity binary and specify the full path,
but I doubt it:  If you get something like "command not found", then
you need to find the binary.  ('locate metacity | grep bin' should
help to find it).

OK, here is the .xsession-errors file right after logging in. All I did before
opening this file was open a terminal and start metacity.

---------

I opened the ~/.autostart/xfconf-migration-4.6.desktop file. Here are its
contents:

Some notes:

The word "migration" may lead people to incorrect assumptions. This is a brand
new installation of Fedora 11 after reformatting the hard disk. The only config
files I copied from old disks were .openoffice.org, .claws-mail,
mozilla, .easytag, .scribus, and .Virtualbox. I did not "migrate" any other
configurations from previous distro installations.

Shortly after installing Fedora 11 I removed the Tomboy notes icon from the
panel. I have no idea why gnome-panel is throwing a warning about it. I have
rebooted dozens of times since without issue.

If anyone has any ideas, I'd sure like to hear them.

I can start metacity just fine from a Gnome terminal, as long as X is running.
In this case gnome-panel was still running, so all I had to do was click on
Applications > System > Terminal, then type the command "metacity" and hit
Enter. That is how I am functioning at the moment.

In the past I lost both metacity and gnome-panel. 

Considering that this has happened after installing five different distros, I
really need to figure out what is causing it. Or at least, how to repair it.
Reinstalling from scratch after two days of configurations and installing
applications is getting old.

I just succeeded in getting Rhythmbox on the new Fedora 11 installation to read
the playlists from Rhythmbox on my desktop computer. It turns out that the
rhythmboxdb.xml file needs to be in ~/.local/rhythmbox/, not in
~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/.

Yes, I know this project well, it is developed since 2005 by several
Chinese, one of them is Mao Decao,
a famous operating system professor in Zhejiang University, has
written one popular thick book to analyze
linux kernel in Chinese, he is also the leader of the whole developer team;
one of another developer of this team I have also met in Shenzhen when
I was still in China;
the project is mainly sponsored by Insigma, also a Chinese company
based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang University;

quote from wikipedia, the word "Longene" in Chinese is also the name
of a kind of excellent tea in ancient times;

"Linux Unified Kernel, also known as Longene[1][not in citation given]
and informally as LUK, is an operating system kernel intended to be
binary-compatible with application software and device drivers made
for Microsoft Windows and Linux.[2] In order to accomplish this, key
features of the Windows kernel are ported to the Linux kernel."

the Linux Unified Kernel project is licensed under GPLv2, a good open
source project, welcome to hackers all over the world~

http://www.longene.org/
http://www.longene.org/en/
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Kernel
http://www.insigma.com.cn/

I'm currently doing experiments to get its source, compile and run
several common win apps on popular linux distros, its running
performance is definitely much better than userland wine emulation;

and Longene also has a goal to run win drivers .sys file natively,
that did not achieve yet, and maybe more difficult than just wine
emulation; at Longene development early stage, it has many reference
to WINE, ReactOS, and NDiswrapper projects, which are all GPL
licensed, so the ecosystem works well;

I have a plan to write a detailed article to collect all these steps
involved and some of its internal features and principles;

In Rhythmbox on my desktop I have a playlist of over 50 classical music stations
around the world. I wish to use the same list with Rhythmbox on my Fedora 11
laptop. 

There exists a rhythmboxdb.xml file in ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/, but it
contains every song that you have ever played, including local mp3 files. At
the very end it has the list of radio stations with the header "iradio" at the
start of each entry.

I need to delete everything except the "iradio" entries and save the file as a
new XML file. I can open the file in OOo Writer, but Writer can't figure out
how to save it as an XML file. Ditto for Gedit.

Is there a simple XML editor that I can use for this task? Alternatively, is
there a different music player that can import this playlist?

I'm not saying I know anything, but I would not make the assumption that
Virtualbox is not causing the issue just because it doesn't fix itself when
you uninstall it. It is entirely possible that some config file is mucked
with by Virtualbox that is not un-mucked when uninstalling.

Well, that's news to me - my clean install of Karmic includes and 
defaults to Rhythmbox, but not Banshee. The former is a buggy mess, 
although it's goode enough for subscribing to podcasts. i haven't tried 
Banshee in a couple of years, i hope it's in better shape now. i 
revisited Songbird a few months ago, and still am not impressed.

...guess i'm feeling unusually opinionated this morning.

Have you checked to see if you still have gnome installed? When you
uninstalled Rythmbox and Virtualbox from your system, your RPM package
manager might have removed gnome with those packages...especially if it was
an automatically-installed package (or whatever the RPM equivalent is). If
you still have gnome installed as stated by your package manager, it might
be a good idea to reinstall it, as some shared files might have been
clobbered when either removing Rythmbox and Virtualbox or when installing
Virtualbox OSE.

Wes suggested the same thing, and it also occurred to me. 

In the Debian world I would just open Synaptic, select Gnome and all its
components and mark them for Reinstall. 

In Fedora I have two GUIs: Add/Remove Software and Yumex, the latter being a
bit more featureful, although it throws up a little popup every so often saying
it can't get a lock - even if started right after rebooting. I ignore the popup
and it seems to work fine.

However, neither gives me a "reinstall" option. I can uninstall, and I can
install. Uninstalling Gnome wants to uninstall a very long and scary list of
other packages, including things like gdm. I don't want to end up unable to log
in. Maybe it would be safer to do this from Xfce. (Having been through
this four times before, one of the first things I did was install Xfce and take
it for a spin to make sure I had a desktop I could log in to.)

I am not very familiar with yum at the command line yet. Perhaps that would be
a better way to "reinstall."

I should also add that it is interesting that I had installed Virtualbox from
Sun yesterday and had no problem with Gnome. But that version of Virtualbox
gave me so much grief getting the vbox kernel module installed that I finally
gave up on it. I uninstalled it and installed the OSE version instead (which
"just works"). The OSE version is from the fusion repo. The About screen says
it is 3.0.10_OSE r5409.

Also, while fixing the problem is a primary concern, it would be awesome if I
could figure out the exact cause. I haven't filed any bug reports about
this because, from past experience, I know the response will be "unable to
reproduce." But now I finally have a serious suspect. Not enough evidence yet
to arrest the dude, but more than sufficient to get a search warrant.

I tried Banshee last night.  The nicest thing I can say about it is
that it has a pretty interface.  :-(  It froze up twice.  The first
time so badly that I had to restart my X server.  :-<  So I uninstalled
it; I don't need the grief.  I've never much liked Rhythmbox or Amarok
-- both of them are buggy.  For my purposes (which admittedly are not
John's), Sonata works just fine for playing music.  Gnomad2 allows me
to create new playlists on my Cowon D2 (though I have yet to get it to
see the external SDHC memory card).

Just a side note: if you're looking at alternatives to rhythmbox, I'm a
big fan of exaile (exaile.org). I like the interface and there are a lot
of plugins you can get for it.

I don't think it has any way of automatically importing your music or
settings from rhythmbox, though.

The popup is caused by Fedora's automatic update feature.  Yumex tries
to run Yum, but the updater is using it, so it pops up the little
notice.  If you keep Yumex running long enough, you'll eventually see a
popup from the updater, complaining that it can't run Yum.  :-)
Jealous software, what a concept.  :-)

There is a "reinstall" option for the yum command line.  I think that's
only for single packages, though.  For updating major blocks of
packages, like Gnome, the "group*" commands are your friends.  :-)

I am using Debian unstable with KDE and the mouse is giving me trouble. It
moves around just fine, but it will accept clicks either in an application
or for destop operations like changing windows,but not both. If I close the
application it goes back to working with the desktop, but if I open another
app it will switch.  I thought restarting X had fixed it, but the problem is
back.  The keyboard is working fine.  Any ideas what is going on?

Hmm interesting, I've experienced similar behavior w. Debian Sid/KDE. It only happens 
a few times a week. I assumed it was the physical USB connection. Unplugging and plugging 
back in my USB Logitech Trackball always fixes it. I'm going to pay closer attention to it 
now someone else is seeing it too.

Message-ID: <5f6af5080912041500j7d5a8614sd310a789b5313fc4@mail.gmail.com>

I have a preference question. I bought a Western Digital 280 gig disk and
put vmware images on it for my team at work. I use Ubuntu as my main OS
though, and most everyone else uses Windows. I left the original format as
NTFS. The other day the cat graciously pulled the power plug on my desktop
and I had to plug the usb drive in about five or six times before it
automounted in Ubuntu. During each attempted mount I got to see these in
dmesg:


[1881626.372625] usb 1-5: device descriptor read/64, error -62
[1881626.664589] usb 1-5: device descriptor read/64, error -62

[1881628.300720] usb 1-5: device descriptor read/64, error -62

I suspect it's probably some special feature of NTFS and the usb disk not
getting unmounted properly, as I've seen this before with other NTFS USB
disks.

I'd like to reformat the drive to a better FS, but I can't force all the
Windows guys to have to get special software just to read the disk. Does
windows only read FAT32 and NTFS? Is there a better shared FS to format the
drive as that eliminates this problem?

thanks,

Not any shared FS's that I'm aware of. There is a driver/software component
that will allow you to use EXT2/3 FS on a drive and read, mount and write to
it just as if it were a native FS mount. It installs once, you assign a
drive letter to the device and you're good to go. I'll dig up the link for
it if that seems of interest.

Seems a bit drastic, its a bit disturbing, but I am not feeling like
going off the deep end. And would that even fix my problem? How are
mouse clicks for applications handled differently than mouse clicks
for say the taskbar in KDE? What are the layers lying above the usb
driver? If I cat /dev/psaux, the clicks are showing up, but the
application is just not responding to it.

since ratpoison has no clickable elements, there are only application
clicks to contend with.

and speaking as a longtime ratpoison user, i don't click much anyway,
except to copy and paste.

Can you reproduce this behavior in another window manager?

These error are from the USB driver not being able to read correctly.  I had
similar issues during booting trying to talk to a USB flash device.
Nothing to do with the
file system that is on it.

Yes, that does it!. I installed openbox and its task manager tint2.
This shows none of the mouse problems and is actually kind of nice.
Maybe kwin is the problem.

Ignore that previous message. As soon as I sent it, my mouse problems
came back. So  a totally different window manager is sort of like
restarting X. It fixes the problem for a few minutes and now it's
back. Maybe it is some kind of looks usb connection problem.
I will check.

Thanks. I had used the groupinstall command before, but had forgotten it.

1) Reinstalling Gnome made no difference. I still have no window manager after
logging in to Gnome. 

2) I read the man page on yum, but didn't figure out how to know the name of
the groupinstall package. How did you know the package would be "gnome desktop
environment"?

I made a launch menu item for metacity to make it easier to start it after
logging in. I didn't make one for gnome-panel because without the panel I
wouldn't be able to access the launch menu. Luckily this time the panel did not
die.

I'm off to see if I can find a bugtracker page for Virtualbox OSE. Also for
Gnome.

I don't know if this is the right place to make an announcement like this,
but it couldn't hurt any.

I've been interested for a long time in writing a program that automates the
application of certain design patterns to a software project (ex. changing
the implementation of a plain-old method into a Strategy Pattern). I don't
want to attempt such a massive project on my own and, to my knowledge, the
closest anyone has come to implementing a design pattern automation project
are the authors of the GoF add-in to StarUML.

Would anyone here be interested in joining me in starting such a major
endeavor?

I've been using Fedora off and on for the last few years and figured out via
Google that the Fedora folks call the desktop stuff for the most part
$gnome/kde/moblin desktop environment as the package group.

Well, unplugging and plugging in the mouse fixed my problem also. I
thought I had covered this angle by plugging in a second mouse. With
the second mouse plugged in I had the same problems. The trouble is
that I had not touched the original mouse and its bad connection
caused problems for the second mouse.

Thanks everyone for the suggestions. I might even give ratpoison a try.

Subject: [PLUG] Boot slackware 13 using loadlin...
Message-ID: <1259993386.3306.7.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

Has anyone gotten this to work?

I have a serial ATA drive I wasn't using, so I decided 
to install freedos 1.0 in the first 500 megs and use 
the rest of the drive to install Slackware 13.  I was 
lazy, I told setup to install everything.  Obviously, 
I didn't set lilo up because I intend to use loadlin.

Which kernel exactly do I need from the /boot directory
on my slackware partition?  I am not running an smp box.
I see generic and I see huge.

The problem I'm running into is that loadlin fires up and
the kernel decompresses followed by the system resetting
and booting back into freedos.  I installed freedos with
just the base group plus gem.  Do I need to use the load
without drivers option in freedos or do I need himem and
emm386?

What I'm after is seeing how Slackware 13 works before I
go and try to squeeze it onto a 4 gig scsi hard drive
replacing Slackware 10.1.  I need to make sure that the
Realtek 8180L pci card on that box will work among other 
things.

Why not just use Lilo? It certainly provide a lot less headaches. Huge is
the the kernel Pat recommends for default installs. Generic doesn't include
as many of the modules IIRC but you'll need to decompress and read the
config file for the kernel. Do you get a kernel panic or stack trace before
it reboots and freaks out?

As far as I know, there are no OS Skype clients because the protocol
remains a trade secret.  I think I recall reading something to this
effect on their company FAQ.

Yes, the protocol is closed so there isn't an OS alternative client
that you can use to communicate w. Skype clients. Supposedly you can do
this w. Ekiga and a SIP trunk but it's not free.

However, Skype did saw they were going to OS the client.

release date yet.

I was a big user and proponent of Skype at one point and the people started
calling it spyware. I never found out if there is more to it than just rumor...

I'm leery of installing lilo because I have a Linux system
I don't want to mess up on another hard drive, a parallel 
ATA hard drive actually.  The system I'm studying this for
is a PII 300 that runs freedos and uses loadlin to load
Slackware 10.1.  I installed XOSL to that system where lilo
would possibly create a conflict.

As far as kernel panic or stack trace before reboot, it 
reboots too fast so I have no idea.

There are a bunch of standards-compliant H323 clients out there for
all platforms:

http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Open+Source+VOIP+Software

With so many good choices out there, why do people insist on using the
most crappy one? Marketing is truly evil.

Make the change at the other end.

Because people like me cannot make sense of that listing.  Do I need a
Proxy? What is SIP? What is (UA)?  Which one of the 22 SIP clients
will work for me and my Grandmother?  Are all 22 equally "good
choices"?

Some sort of hand-holding is needed if the none-technical users are to adopt it.

Naturally I would not hand that list to someone's granny. I would
simply say, "get ekiga".

I'll second that.  The windows installation was a little bumpy several 
months ago when I talked my brother through it.

Anybody looked at skype through a network monitor lately?  It turns your 
firewall into a firesieve.  Try explaining this to a windows user...

And how does one install Ekiga on Windows?  There is the "windows-only
husband" one has to contend with.

Yes, that pages lists Ekiga under Windows, but clicking through I
haven't found a Windows download:

http://www.ekiga.org/index.php?rub=5

Also, how does one do the equivalent of SkypeIn and SkypeOut with
Ekiga?  Looking on the website, but haven't found anything.

SkypeIn and SkypeOut are the method of getting on and off the skype
network mostly to landline and mobile phones.
When you purchase SkypeIn you get a phone number anyone can call.

Why not try to use google talk or a real voip service like sipphone or
callcentric.

I didn't realize that Google Talk works on Linux.  A quick check still
shows that it's Windows-only:

http://www.google.com/talk/

So that's not going to work.

Skype is an service and client software which works with Linux,
Window, and Mac OS X.  It ain't perfect, in fact, I think it has
several shortcomings.  But for the core services (VoIP, receive/send
landline or mobile connections) it works pretty well on all three
platforms.  I know of no other service that does that.

Skype takes a just a few clicks to install on Windows and OS X.  And
Skype on Ubuntu takes about as long once you setup the Medibuntu
repository:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu

I'd be more than happy to switch to Ekiga or other Open Source package
and service if I could get the same functionality as I do from Skype.
Or if there was a way for Ekiga to talk to Skype.  Is there?  Seems
like what's needed is the VoIP equivalent of Pidgin.

- Robert

Thank you, I had no idea what SkypeIn and SkypeOut were.

You can set up asterisk as your own personal PBX, and use ekiga as the
IP phone. I am about to do this myself. A service is required to route
calls onto and off of the phone network. This service can be had for
around $10/mo. Looking at all the various plans right now. Here's a
list of providers:

What you're really talking about is having a tel # on the pub

tel network and being able to place calls out to the PTN.

This is called a SIP Gateway. Apparently there's quite a few

apps the provide SIP to Skype connectivity.

http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Skype+Gateways

I know all the info is a bit overwhelming, even for me, and I 

have a background in Telco/ISP level VOIP systems.

I've wanted to build an Asterisk box for many years and play 

around w. all these neat FOSS VOIP apps.

Apparently, Skype is working w. Asterisk on "Skype for Asterisk"

commerical offering.

http://blogs.digium.com/2009/02/23/skype-for-asterisk-update/

If anyone is interested in all these, I would totally be into having

a "session" on building an Asterisk box and testing out the many

FOSS VOIP apps and services.

There is a couple all in one variants.
http://www.trixbox.org/

There are dozens of these at http://www.rpath.org/ui/#

There is a re-write of asterisk project called freeswitch which gets
rid of the deadlock issues one developer
found but the community would not allow to be fixed.

This morning I made major progress. 

I could swear that it was someone here who suggested creating a new user, then
polluting the new user with configs from my real account. And I did create a
new user back then. The new user had metacity just fine. And I copied all my
Gnome configs to the new user, and the new user still had metacity.

But that was OpenSuse 11.2 or 11.1. I just tried it again on my new Fedora 11
installation, and got the same results - the new user still had metacity. But
then I copied my .local folder to the new user. After copying my .local
folder to the new user, the new user lost metacity.

That's the good news. The bad news is that the .local folder has lots of stuff
in it and I can't figure out which file makes metacity start on login. Or maybe
the problem is a file that is missing.

But I'm *that* close. [Don_Adams_voice:Off]

You are getting to the meat of the matter. Ekiga (or any
standards-compliant softphone) cannot interact with skype because
skype uses a completely different, proprietary, closed source
protocol. That is the issue in a nutshell. It's exactly the sort of
thing that an open source champion should fight against by eschewing
it in favor of an H323 solution. So what if it's more work? It's a
one-time effort, and it'll make you more knowledgeable. Besides, it's
only more work if you want to communicate with ordinary phones. It is
very easy to make SIP-to-SIP calls.

Ekiga is the VoIP equivalent of pidgin. Both are gnome utilities.

Making direct SIP-to-SIP calls using ekiga or any other standard SIP
client is free and very easy to set up. If ekiga doesn't install
easily on windows, use a different softphone. Several of them are java
applications. They should be very easy to get going, even easier than
skype. There is no installation - just download and launch. SIP
Communicator is one such java softphone.

With open sorce, you can position yourself anywhere along the
convenience/functionality spectrum. You just can't call someone who
insists on using skype. Hopefully I have managed to dispel the myth
that skype is the only softphone that the average person can
handle. That is what "they" want you to believe, but it is
crap. They'd love it even more if you ditched linux in favor of
windows just so you could run skype. (I have never been able to get a
webcam to work with linux skype, while the same webcam/computer combo
works with ekiga.) There is no reason not to get Mom, Granny, et al to
grab a second softphone so you don't have to pucker up and plant a wet
one on skype's fat ass. Just send Mom this link:

I don't know if this is the right place to make an announcement like this,
but it couldn't hurt any.

I've been interested for a long time in writing a program that automates the
application of certain design patterns to a software project (ex. changing
the implementation of a plain-old method into a Strategy Pattern). I don't
want to attempt such a massive project on my own and, to my knowledge, the
closest anyone has come to implementing a design pattern automation project
are the authors of the GoF add-in to StarUML.

Would anyone here be interested in joining me in starting such a major
endeavor?

my message didn't get to the group because I didn't get a copy of my message

I did, but the results were inconclusive.

The results of diff are hard to read and understand. Finally, I just did diff
--brief and figured I would look at the files in Gedit or something myself
manually. Even that didn't help. And sometimes diff lied. For example, it said
two small text files were different, but when I opened them in Gedit and
compared them line by line they were identical, at least as to content.

And I did chown -R everything to the respective users.

I also have a .local folder in the home folder of my old Jaunty installation. I
have it on the old Jaunty hard disk and on another hard disk as a backup. I
looked at it with an eye to just copying it over. But it is very, very
different.

I have some time this afternoon. I'm going to start by googling on the .local
folder and see what turns up.

Diff  pays attention to whitespace (leading/trailing spaces, tab vs. spaces)
unless you tell it not to.  See 'man diff' for the -b, -w, -B command line
options.

Subject: [PLUG] rtl8180-0.21 source...
Message-ID: <20091205205052.of2ndnlshr4k8ksc@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

The source doesn't want to compile in Slackware 13.  Strangely enough
following the installation instructions, typing make in the rtl8180-0.21
source directory deletes the source code.  I've had this happen with  
the quickcam usb 0.6.6 source code too.

Any idea what is causing this strange deletion phenomenon?

I really want to figure out how to use the newer version of Slackware
as 2.6.10 on Slackware 10.1 stopped working again.  It seems to stop
working every time I try to log into the web page on the Linksys WAP11
version 2.6 that it is linked to.  This is why I have been wanting to
learn how to use snmp, to get another way into that wireless router.

As far as using loadlin to boot Slackware 13, it appears to be impossible.
Apparently, it doesn't work because the kernel is too big.

On the subject of Slackware 13, is there a tool that is nicer than pkgtool
to help me remove unnecessary packages to get the size of my install down?
Eventually, I need to install this to a 4.0 gig hard drive.  I'd like to
install with KDE, but I realize that may not be possible.

I have an Alvarion PC-DS.11b card I need to support, don't recall what the
driver is under 2.6.10 or if I had to download source for that as well.

As Tony pointed out diff pays attention to whitespace - in some cases that is
very relevant.  

Consider using context diff, the -c option, to be presented with the most 
human readable diff output.

Subject: [PLUG] EDID editor for Linux?
Message-ID: <20091206180549.GB2837@gate.kl-ic.com>

I finally got the time to build some Frankenstein QXGA (2048x1536)
T60 Thinkpads.  Part of the process involves writing new EDID
screen configuration information to the QXGA panels so the
Thinkpad BIOS does not glarf (I imagine X could be fooled to
read EDID from a file).

There are some freeware Windoze (but not open source) tools out
there for rewriting the EDID information, but a quick search did
not reveal anything for Linux.  Does anybody know of a Linux app
that *writes* EDID information to a display?

Thanks for all the suggestions. I finally nailed it.

The ~/.local-original/share/applications folder for the new user had only two
files. My ~/local/share/applications folder has many entries. I don't know what
they do. Some appear to be part of the Applications menu, but others clearly
are not. And I also have launchers in Applications that are not reflected in a
file in this folder. 

However, I was especially interested in a file called metacity.desktop. I noted
that the new user's original folder did not contain this file. I tried to
rename it, but Nautilus would not let me. I certainly own the file and have rw
permissions for it, but Nautilus just wouldn't let me. No matter, as root from
the command line I renamed it metacity.desktop.old. Then I rebooted. And after
logging in metacity launched as it is supposed to. Everything else seems to be
working normally.

I have no idea what rogue process created this file.

It is a text file that can be opened with Gedit. Looking at the contents I see
nothing that says "don't launch metacity for this user." 

If any of the Gnome users on this list have such a file, it would be
interesting to compare notes. I feel an obligation to file a bug report, but I
in order to make the bug report useful I need to figure out what is the purpose
of the file, what created it, and where it went wrong.

John,

I don't have that file in Ubuntu 9.10.  The only thing close is 
"gnomecc.desktop".

Hope your disappearing desktop is solved!!

If it were me, I would create a script to notify me via email and text
message as soon as the file is created. that should give a hint as to what's
creating it, as I can think "what happened in the last 5 minutes?"

I would put it in crontab and have it run once a minute.

It's a config file that tells the desktop environment (Gnome, KDE,
etc.) how to present a menu entry for an app, which icon to use, how
to launch it, etc.

John,

I do have the ~/.local/share/applications folder, and the metacity file
is in it.  It's a simple text file.  The contents are:

[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Metacity
Type=Application
...
<many lines of the form "Name[<language-specifier>]=Metacity">
...
Exec=metacity
NoDisplay=true
X-GNOME-WMSettingsModule=metacity
X-GNOME-WMName=Metacity
X-GnomeWMSettingsLibrary=metacity
X-GNOME-Bugzilla-Bugzilla=GNOME
X-GNOME-Bugzilla-Product=metacity
X-GNOME-Bugzilla-Component=general
X-GNOME-Autostart-Phase=WindowManager
X-GNOME-Provides=windowmanager
X-GNOME-Autostart-Notify=true
Name[en_US]=Metacity

Nautilus shows the filename as "Metacity", but ls shows it as
metacity.desktop (note the capitalization).  Changing the name from the
command line (mv metacity.desktop metacity.desktop.orig) changed the
name as shown by ls.  Nautilus, however, still showed it as Metacity.
Changing the name with Nautilus, to Metacity.orig, showed the name
changed there.  Just to be stubborn, ls showed the name as
metacity.desktop.orig.  A little digging showed what is likely the
reason.

The last line of the file is "Name[en_US]=Metacity".  If I change the
filename using Nautilus, that line changes to
"Name[en_US]=Metacity.orig".  The actual filename, as shown by ls, does
not change.  It seems pretty obvious that this line is what Nautilus is
reporting as the filename, at least on my system.

Now, as to why Nautilus didn't want to let you change the name of your
file, I'm not sure.  Check the SELinux context for the file, that may
be a problem.  For that matter, check the context for the parent
directory.  I've had trouble occasionally where I couldn't change a
file, even as root.  The security context turned out to be the
trouble.  Here are the directory listings from my system:

[dales at valeron applications]$ ls -d --context ../applications
drwxr-xr-x  dales dales unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 ../applications
[dales at valeron applications]$ ls --context metacity.desktop
-rw-rw-r--  dales dales unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 metacity.desktop

Now that I think about it, SELinux contexts could be a problem waiting
to bite you.  If you're bringing files into Fedora from another distro,
they almost certainly don't have the right security contexts, assuming
that they have any at all.  Nautilus can set the contexts for you.
Move to your /home directory and right-click on your user directory.
Select "Properties" and select the "Permissions" tab.  Make sure that
your folder and file permissions are set correctly (they probably
are).  Then, at the bottom of the panel, you'll see a line "SELinux
Contexts" and a string widget.  Make sure the settings are right
(again, they probably are, but if not see mine, above), click
the "Apply Permissions to Enclosed Files" button, and you should be
good to go.

That said, I *strongly* suggest reading up on SELinux.  I found the
man pages to be dry and rather rough going, but their info is good to
have, since Fedora uses SELinux as part of its security setup.
O'Reilly has a book on SELinux which is easier reading than the Linux
man pages.

Anyway, I hope that helped.

The string widget on my Nautilus is just a drop-down, but "User home directory"
is what it was set to. I did click on the Apply Permissions to Enclosed Files
button, on general principles.

I have brought in only a handful of config files from other distros
- .openoffice.org, .scribus, .rhythmbox, and the like. But no config files
 relative to the desktop or OS.

Having said that, I have copied several dozen GB of data from my old Ubuntu
disk. These are just data files. The interesting thing is that I did so by
dragging and dropping with Nautilus. And I got constant error messages about
lack of permission.

The interesting thing is that it was always certain kinds of files, but not
always. For example, when dragging a folder containing files for books on Mani
and Kim that I did for a PSU professor, I could copy some PDF files, but not
others; some TIFF images, but not others, etc. I kept looking for a pattern,
e.g., were the non-allowed PDFs files that I did not create myself? But there
was no obvious pattern.

It does, although it gives me a lot of work to do. :(

Subject: [PLUG] trying to understand the interplay between video cards and 3
	monitors in linux
Message-ID: <498756ed0912061829n12efc40bxe6b8b1a3f0968100@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I want to build a system for the first time.  I'm a bit fuzzy on how
video cards and 3 monitors work.  I will be asking my questions
pretending money is no object.  What I mean by that last statement is
that I want to get 3 30" monitors, the LG W3000H, which costs
$1,159.99 at newegg.com

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824005115

but realistically, I will maybe buy one 30" LG W3000H, and use two
existing monitors that I own.  For the purposes of answering my
inquiry, please pretend that I will  have three 30" W3000H monitors.

According to the specs of the W3000H monitor,

http://www.lge.com/products/model/detail/w3000h.jhtml

it's recommended resolution is 2560 x 1600, and it's connection is
DVI-D (Dual Link).

I want to run the three monitors at "full blast", i.e. 2560 x 1600.
So, presumibly I need two video cards like the

 ASUS EN9600GT SILENT/2D/512MD3 GeForce 9600 GT 512MB 256-bit GDDR3
PCI Express 2.0 x16 HDCP Ready SLI Support Video Card - Retail
Silent V-Cool Heatsink with Dual DVI Output

whose specs are:

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121324

This card has 2 x DVI ports and supports Dual-Link DVI.  So I guess if
I get two of these cards, I'll have 4 x DVI ports, and I can hook up
the 3 monitors mentioned above.  Is that true?

Will I have enough "power" to run the 3 monitors?  The Memory Size is
512MB?  Will the monitors run at "full blast" so to speak.  I
understand I'll have to configure some sort of xorg.conf file, but
what I'm really interested in knowing is if these two video cards
working somehow together will be able to power the 3 monitors.  The
max resolution on the individual card is Max Resolution  	2560 x 1600.
 Since one monitor's resolution is 2560 x 1600, does that imply that 3
monitors running at 2560 x 1600, won't work with 2 video cards whose
individual Max Resolution is 2560 x 1600.  Do I have to get more video
cards, or do I have enough?

These video cards I'm talking about use the NVidia chipset ?  Do I
have to use the SLI technology from NVidia to run the two video cards
together?

Furthermore, I'm leaning towards NVidia because they seem to work
better in Ubuntu linux.  However, from what I can tell,
ATI is ostensibly, more open source, but their implementation of their
open source drivers are bad.  Since I'm new to this stuff, I am
leaning toward NVidia, and hoping it'll "just work" when I finally try
to install ubuntu linux.  Should I be dissuaded from this, i.e. should
I go with ATI, or to avoid headaches, should I stick with NVidia?

I cited specific components, i.e. monitors, and video cards above.
What I want to do is build a system that runs ubuntu linux with 3
powerful monitors  ( my eyes suck....)  and I figure I need two video
cards working together  ( and I don't know if I have to take into
account NVidia's SLI technology, and/or ATI's Crossfire technology )
somehow.  I want to know what kind of components I need, so that I
don't have to worry that I bought the wrong, or not powerful enough,
cards.  I really don't want the hassle of having bought my video
cards, and monitor(s), and then having to return them because they are
not fully supported under linux, and/or not powerful enough cards.

Anyone who has gone through this "hassle" of trying to get 3 monitors
to work in ubuntu linux, please steer me clear of "bumps in the road".

Thank you,
Victor Soich

This is done a bit more elegantly with the Kernel file system daemon:
http://freshmeat.net/projects/kfsmd/

I wanted to know what was producing cruft in my home directory at one
point, and I wrote up the process here:

The program would favor more of the former approach than the latter
approach.

For example, let's say we have a class called Cls1 that has a method called
SquareRoot( aRealnumber ) that was implemented as a standard, plain-old
method. Using this program to apply a strategy pattern would ideally
encapsulate the plain-old method into a member of a new Strategy
class---let's call it StandardSquareRootStrategy::SquareRoot( aRealNumber ).
This new Strategy class would inherit from an abstract class called
AbstractSquareRootStrategy. Furthermore, this program would rewrite Cls1 to
include a new attribute called "SquareRootStrategy" complete with accessors
and mutators that would have a type of AbstractSquareRootStrategy
(*not*StandardSquareRootStrategy!) and would rewrite the constructor
to properly
initialize the new attribute with an instance of StandardSquareRootStrategy.
Finally, the Cls1::SquareRoot( aRealNumber ) would be rewritten to call
this->SquareRootStrategy->SquareRoot( aRealNumber ).

In short, this program would ideally turn 15-20 minutes of tedious and
error-prone work into 5-15 seconds of easy, less error-prone code
generation.

The biggest problem with this grand vision is how grand it is and how much
would be asked of a mere program to do. I'm also not sure where to begin
with such a massive undertaking as modifying a source code tree in such
extreme and potentially destructive manners. The first thing I would look
at, though, is how Visual Studio 2008 implements its refactoring tools.
Another avenue is to use ANTLR and StringTemplates to do all the heavy
lifting of lexing and parsing the target language into an intermediate
representation and writing the modified code to disk.

Sorry, I'm afraid you're stuck with the proprietary version.  Note also
that if your wife wants to ring her sister, VoIP -> landline termination in
Istanbul costs $0.0275/min.  (Cell is 12 cents more.)  I can hook her up
with a calling-card if she wants to try it.

BTW, is there a VoIP/Asterisk/streaming-media user's group in Portland?

Sorry, that page is a bit misleading.  The official Google Talk voice
client runs only on Winders.  The protocol is Jingle (sorta), which is open
and runs lots of places: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingle_(protocol)

But you're right, Skype does "easy voice/video chat" very well.

Subject: [PLUG] Thinkpad T60 QXGA
Message-ID: <20091208052913.GA7740@gate.kl-ic.com>

I purchased a used T60 from Ebay, modded for 1400x1050.  A few other
mods by the original owner, which I consider a plus. 

I also ordered a Seagate 500GB SATA hard drive, a SATA ultrabay,
and most importantly an aftermarket 15.0 inch QXGA LCD display
panel, 2048x1536.  AFAIK, these are the highest resolution laptop
displays available, and they match my 4x3 inclinations.  I am
curious about what they will do with my 1024x768 projector.

I may need to run Windoze to rewrite the EDID information (sigh) but
after that it should run Linux fine.  Some hardware in common with
John Jordan's T61.  

If this works, I will build a second Frankenstein T60 for my wife.
If anyone else wants to join in that build, consider purchasing the
pieces.  It is also possible to swap a T61 system board into the
15.0 inch T60 case, which gets me a Penryn processor and more RAM. 
Unfortunately, I'm told the T61 case only works with a 15.4 inch
screen, and there isn't a QXGA LCD panel in that size.

It would be nice if a manufacturer sold what I want new, but at 
least I can cobble together the laptop I want.

I'm in the middle of my Big Computer Upgrade, with Ubuntu 9.10 (up from

without getting out of Linux.

I _thought_ that I could have access somehow to the host filesystem from 
VirtualBox -- but that doesn't seem to be the case.  What gives?  Am I 
missing something?  Is the free-as-in-liberty version not capable of 
this, but maybe the free-as-in-beer one is?

I see there's a hack to get into the VirtualBox disk images -- but it is 
well and truly a hack, and not something I want to base a business

At worst, I'm hoping for some _mild_ hack like using putty to ssh into 
the same dang box from Windows to move files around.

I don't know any amazingly tricky VM-ish ways to do this, so I just share a
directory using Samba.  Recent Ubuntu versions handle this nicely - pick a
directory (say, your home folder), right-click it and use "Sharing Options"
to share the folder.  Ubuntu will ask to install Samba (it calls it
"Sharing Service" in the dialog) and once that's done, Bob's your uncle.

It's easy in the VirtualBox gui app (i rarely touch the vboxmanage 
command-line tools):

- select your VM definition from the list and click Settings
- select "Shared Folders", the last item in the list on the left
- click the icon with the + on it or press the Insert key
- browse to the folder you want to access, click OK, and it should show 
up in the list.

Now start your VM, log in, and open Windoze Explorer.

In WinXP, you should see an entry names "VirtualBox Shared Folders" 
under My Network Places\Entire Network - you folder should appear as 
"\\VBOXSVR\<folder-name>". You can map this folder to a drive letter.

In Win7 (and Vista, i suspect), it seems that you can't browse it in the 
current VBox, but you can open an Explorer window and simply type 
"\\VBOXSVR\<folder-name>". Drive mapping doesn't work (for me), but 
that's minor.

Easy - no Samba or explicit sharing from the Linux side required. i rely 
on this for Quicken & Turbotax (at home) and for testing sw i develop 
(at work).

Thanks Joe -- I didn't see that on the panel at first (I had to scroll 
down -- d'oh).

After installing the Virtual Box client upgrades everything went well.  
My accounting program doesn't see the drive, but I think the fault lies 
with it, not with Virtual Box.

This should help:

BTW, are you sure the EDID EEPROM is writable?  If I were designing an 
LCD monitor, I'd probably try to write protect the EDID info to 
prevent errant software from screwing it up.

Is there something special about that display or laptop that requires 
this? I've done a higher-res display upgrade on an HP laptop once and it 
was plug and play. How is this different than plugging in an external

Thinkpads have stuff in the BIOS to verify that it is an Official
IBM Screen or something.  I'm sure X will find it, but the BIOS
parameter-setting firmware probably won't.

It looks like i2cdump and i2cset are the right tools out of that. 
Thanks!  I will need to wrap them in a script to write the whole
record to the EEPROM - and yes, I will read out all the information
first, and make sure I am writing what I think I am writing.

Indeed, it seems that most of the i2c hardware is writable, including
the registers in your RAM sticks and who knows what else.  Apparently
the i2c bus permits major and permanent mayhem, not just to the
display, but to the whole machine.  I think I will practice on some
expendable hardware first.  

While researching this, I have seen desperate emails from people
looking for help programming the EDID EPROM on their laptops.
Some bit of rogue software already did, and they need to restore
the original code.  Looks like one more set of memory that needs
backup and recovery tools, as well as intrusion detection.

Hi all,

I want to build a system for the first time. ?I'm a bit fuzzy on how
video cards and 3 monitors work. ?I will be asking my questions
pretending money is no object. ?What I mean by that last statement is
that I want to get 3 30" monitors, the LG W3000H, which costs
$1,159.99 at newegg.com

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824005115

but realistically, I will maybe buy one 30" LG W3000H, and use two
existing monitors that I own. ?For the purposes of answering my
inquiry, please pretend that I will ?have three 30" W3000H monitors.

According to the specs of the W3000H monitor,

http://www.lge.com/products/model/detail/w3000h.jhtml

it's recommended resolution is 2560 x 1600, and it's connection is
DVI-D (Dual Link).

I want to run the three monitors at "full blast", i.e. 2560 x 1600.
So, presumibly I need two video cards like the

?ASUS EN9600GT SILENT/2D/512MD3 GeForce 9600 GT 512MB 256-bit GDDR3
PCI Express 2.0 x16 HDCP Ready SLI Support Video Card - Retail
Silent V-Cool Heatsink with Dual DVI Output

whose specs are:

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121324

This card has 2 x DVI ports and supports Dual-Link DVI. ?So I guess if
I get two of these cards, I'll have 4 x DVI ports, and I can hook up
the 3 monitors mentioned above. ?Is that true?

Will I have enough "power" to run the 3 monitors? ?The Memory Size is
512MB? ?Will the monitors run at "full blast" so to speak. ?I
understand I'll have to configure some sort of xorg.conf file, but
what I'm really interested in knowing is if these two video cards
working somehow together will be able to power the 3 monitors. ?The
max resolution on the individual card is Max Resolution ? ? ? ? 2560 x 1600.
?Since one monitor's resolution is 2560 x 1600, does that imply that 3
monitors running at 2560 x 1600, won't work with 2 video cards whose
individual Max Resolution is 2560 x 1600. ?Do I have to get more video
cards, or do I have enough?

These video cards I'm talking about use the NVidia chipset ? ?Do I
have to use the SLI technology from NVidia to run the two video cards
together?

I remember seeing it a couple days ago (or was it yesterday?). Your
original post made it. Maybe no one on this list can afford 3 monitors
at $1159.99 each, and therefore are not in a position to help. Just a
theory - it certainly holds true for me.

I can tell you that you can use NVidia TwinView to set up 2 monitors
on one card very easily. Too bad you didn't post this question a month
ago, or I would have been able to give you a sample config. I was
using it on my work machine, which is now gone (or actually I am gone
from it). But it was easy. Check out

Hey Victor - I saw your orig post too, but I didn't have any experience 
to draw on to offer you any advice. Glad to hear you were able to scare 
some up...

I currently don't use ubuntu, don't use dual-monitors much less three, 
not knowing anything about the "hassle" of setting this up I didn't 
bother responding.

Do not be afraid to joust a giant just because some people believe in 
windmills.

Well, the newer video cards can behave differently in Linux than the
ones that I've used, so YMMG.  I'll give you my experience.

I used three videos the last time I was fully operational with five
monitors.  They were all 17" CRTs from the second hand store -- I'm
not really a big spender. :)

I had an nVidia 5200, 7200, and 7800, all with CRT+DVI out.

Originally, I had some serious problems with the two 7 series cards,
but they seem to have corrected the problem in the later driver
releases.  Moreover, the latest driver releases won't support all
three, so I had to step back a few to get full coverage.

The documentation that comes with the nVidia driver package (also
available online) is VERY good.  For the most part, you just follow it
and the pattern already set forth in a stock xorg.conf.  The problems
I remember are that the results from lspci are in hex notation and
xorg.conf expects decimal notation for the PCI bus addresses (or maybe
it's the other way around).  A=10, B=11, etc.  The nVidia
documentation will tell you how to specify what output on the card you
want to use.  Lots of trial and error.

I highly recommend you either don't use a window manager or use a very
simple one (like twm) for testing.

In terms of behavior, new video cards (both ATI and nVidia) have
special driver options that allow you to treat two cards as one (like
mega TwinView).  It allows you to use accelerated applications across
all displays.  I don't know anything about that, though -- I can't
afford those cards.

Otherwise, there are basically two modes, Xinerama and normal.  In
Xinerama mode, the window manager understands all the monitors to be
one big desktop, but video acceleration generally doesn't work.  In
normal mode, each screen (TwinView laws apply) is seen as a single X
Screen (word choice?) and can't leave it.  If I remember right, you
can get full video acceleration on each screen without tweaking.
Xinerama and normal modes both allow the mouse to travel across all
the screens freely, but keyboard focus will follow the mouse from
screen to screen in normal mode.

I personally like normal mode, but it takes some getting used to.
There are some problems with Xinerama which modern window managers are
supposed to address, but don't seem to.  For example, the maximize
function is only supposed to increase a window to the size of the
screen, not the entire desktop space.  Some window managers, like
fluxbox, like individual screens and their configuration files allow
screen specific configuration.  I like and use fluxbox.

If there's something I didn't address, just ask and I'll do my best.  Good luck!

Evidently I'm one of the few that feels claustrophobic with fewer than
three monitors. :)

At work, I use five monitors (sometimes six) and the workstation
across from mine uses eight (sometimes nine) for systems monitoring.

BTW, if anyone knows how to accelerate across multiple video cards on
the cheap, send me an email.  I tried Chromium
(http://chromium.sourceforge.net/), but couldn't get it to work. :(  I
haven't found anything else that attempts to address this problem.

If you give me a week or two, I'll send you my xorg.conf.  I'm
currently getting out of school and I'll be switching back to Linux.
Our Microsoft supported university insisted on forcing us into .NET
development tools without warning and I never got the chance to make a
careful backup. :(

Is 15 degrees fahrenheit too cold for the typical linux router built using an
old computer?  I imagine the cold is good for hard drives and it keeps  
the electronics cool.

Has anyone had favorable results with the RealTek 8180 wireless driver in
recent 2.6 kernels?  I'm getting a very weak connection that likes to stall
a lot where I'm wondering if it's poor drivers on the Linux end or problems
with the Linksys WAP11 that it goes through.  I've gone from 2.6.10 adding
a Realtek 8180 driver as a third party deal to 2.6.27.39 where the wireless
card is supported by the kernel directly.

How far can I be from the AP outdoors and still have a strong connection?
I know wireless in general isn't unstable because I have an ad-hoc connection
between my laptop and the router using Alvarion pcmcia wireless cards.

My RealTek card is branded as a Zonet ZEW1300B I believe and linux identifies
it as a RTL8180L chipset card.

I'm beginning to wonder if I had a pcmcia orinoco card that could hook to my
existing antenna if that would work better than the RealTek card?

In my opinion cooler is generally better. My money would be on the realtek
card and kernel module combo. Signal strength with an AP depends on several
factors including RF interference for whatever devices sit nearby, does it
go through walls etc. I believe the upper limit on an older model like that
is going to be 100 meters but Russell would know better than I would I
assume.

The temperature shouldn't be a problem, but keep the humidity in check.  Too
low and you can get static issues.  Not good.

My experience with wireless strongly suggests that:
 
 a) when it works, it works; and 

 b) when it doesn't, it doesnt.

This leads to the general advice: 

 c) when something works, keep doing that; and 

 d) when something doesn't work, try something different.

Only slightly more seriously, I don't have any experience with realtek
and I have had bad luck with the old 200mW 802.11b prism radios (sold
under several labels, mine are senao I think) with recent kernels.  I
tend to use Atheros radios these days.

For fixed (i.e. non-laptop) wireless, there are some really good
options these days, mostly from a company called Ubiquity Networks.
Not too expensive, better-than-commodity quality, including some
high-power options.

Hello,

A few folks are getting together tomorrow evening in NE Portland to 
discuss embedded Linux development. More are welcome!

We'll be meeting at 6:30pm on Thursday, 12/10 at the Staccato Gelato on 
232 NE 28th Ave:

http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=232+NE+28th+Ave,+Portland,+OR&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=44.793449,76.464844&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=232+NE+28th+Ave,+Portland,+Multnomah,+Oregon+97232&z=16

The location is just north of the Laurelhurst Theater. Reportedly they 
have free wifi and the location should be conducive to discussion.

The purpose of this meeting is to share ideas, knowledge, and opinions 
about embedded Linux development, brainstorm ideas for a possible 
project to collaborate on, and whatever else comes up. Since the group 
is just forming, there are many opportunities for taking it in other 
directions.

Please drop by if this sounds interesting to you!

I'm considering joining, especially now since they're offering a get 
one, give one offer. Where if you join, you can give a free membership 
to a student. By a quick look at the benies it seems like you get quite 
a bit for supporting a good org.

I have a few questions.

1. For those of you w. memberships.
How do you feel about LF efforts?
Do you feel like your money is being put to good use?
Do you make good use of the membership benies?

2. Are there any students on the PLUG mailing list who would be 
interested in being a benefactor of this offer?

Thanks, Scott!  That's great to hear!

If y'all decide to have any more meetings and/or start a mailing list,
please let PLUG know.  I'm very sad I won't be in town for the meeting, but
I have some background in building Linux-based appliance machines and I'll be 
working with smaller embedded systems soon.

Lol.  Yeah, they do.  It's a Personal Telco node and it's running
embedded Linux (OpenWrt on a Netgear WGT634U), so that's a good choice
of location!  If the wireless stops working, let me know, that's one
of the nodes we are beta testing a new firmware on.

Hey Scott, thanks for the pointer. i got completely fed up w/RhythmBox 
pegging my cpu and locking up (perhaps due to the size of my library).

Installed Exaile from their deb repo, and was up & running with my music 
lirary, streaming readio, and podcast subscriptions in under 30 min. Sweet!

the podcast support is a little weak, but so far no crashes :-)

removing rhythmbox now...

I justified my membership with the fact that I'm planning on buying a
laptop soon, and the membership discounts for HP, and Lenovo more than
pay for the membership.  Dell also has a discount but it's not as
good.  It's annoying that I can't seem to find any computers I can buy
through the discount at HP, or Lenovo that have linux preinstalled,
but perhaps part of the reasoning for giving discounts to linux
developers is that perhaps that those people who have trouble getting
some feature working with their laptop on linux will fix it
themselves, and they will get more free developer time than the cost
of the discounts.

Some more info:

1:  It is roughly 71 feet from the sidewalk pad in front of the
    pump house to the cantenna hanging on the side of the next
    building.

2:  It is about 10' from the edge of the pad to where the linksys
    router is at.  Figure 15' to be safe.

3:  The straight line from AP to cantenna is probably around 72.5 to
    73'.

4:  It appears that the RealTek card on the Linux side likes to 
    disassociate itself from the AP.

5:  The well is in a seperate room in the pump house and the building
    is wood, so the wireless signal should have no problem traveling
    through the walls.

6:  Because of the well, it isn't practical to bury an underground
    Ethernet line between the pump house and the next building.  It
    isn't practical to run an aerial line either.

Before I think, oh I'll just go to Ebay and get a new wireless card
such as an Orinoco gold card, I want to know if I'm close enough to
get a good connection.  I'm also concerned that my Linksys router
in the pump house is flaky because I'm having trouble accessing the
web page on it.

Humidity is going to be problematic because the signal has to travel
through the open air between these buildings.  It might even be a 
problem inside the buildings themselves.

Do you mean at the RF layer? If so, consider Wifi is subject to the
brightest light problem. Meaning if there's a stronger signal on the 
same channel the card will drop it's current connection and try to 
connect to another AP w. a stronger signal.

I have 3 wireless cards (Linksys, Netgear, and Orinoco Gold) that
I'd be happy to let you borrow for testing. The Orinoco card
Also have you done any wireless surveying? Orinoco used to have
a free wireless tool for Winduhs. I've used Kismet and Wellenreiter 
(Linux) in the past for this but wasn't very impressed with them for 
this purpose. Although this app is Freeware it's for Winduhs.
http://www.metageek.net/products/inssider.

Airmagnet, which is a commercial Winduhs app, is the best I've ever
used for this kind of stuff. It will overwhelm you with the amount
of info it provides about the wireless enviro being surveyed.

Wireless = radio, radios are frequency sensitive devices, and 
frequencies shift with temperature.

Is 15 F a problem?  I dunno.  That's what testing is for -- do you think 
your router was tested at 15F?

Not to mention the fact that wooden walls -- particularly wooden walls 
with condensation -- aren't all that transparent to radio in the GHz region.

Could you put an antenna on the outside of the pump house?  Maybe even a 
Cantenna?

I've got about a 50 foot run between a Cantenna on the outside of a 
metal building and a router in my house; it's quite reliable except 
during heavy rains when I sometimes have to go around resetting things 
to get the network up and running again.

There's good scientific data on the effects of snow, rain, clouds, and fog
RF waves. Not so much with temperature & humidity. I have noticed when either
my wireless cards or my laptop w. built-in wireless get hot my wireless connectivity
seems to degrade. What you really need to do is get db readings at diff temps. Maybe take
one at midnight now during the cold snap and one next week at 12 noon when it's supposed
to be in the 40's...

How did you seal the coax connections?  All outdoor RF connections
should be waterproofed with something like this:

  http://www.invictuswireless.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=TACTAPE

  http://www.fab-corp.com/product.php?productid=1734&cat=0&page=1

We typically wrap electrical tape over tackytape, because the latter
will flow in high summer temperatures and the electrical tape holds it
on the connector where it belongs.  Water in RF connections == bad
news.

Good quality wifi antennas are inexpensive these days ($30-$70).
Home-brew antennas are susceptible to RF leakage that you aren't
likely to be able to see without a spectrum analyzer, so if you don't
have one of those, it's a gigantic crapshoot.

If I needed to bridge an airgap, I would not walk, but run and get two
of these:

  http://www.invictuswireless.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=NS2

In fact, I just ordered another one of them today.

If you specify bank: as having a directory "current", then that
directory needs to exist.  Your vault directory would be contained
within "../current".  Within that vault directory, you need to have a
subdirectory "dirvish" containing the "default.conf" file.  OTOH, if
you want "current" to be your vault, _it_ contains
"dirvish/default.conf", and is _not_ in the bank specification.  Your
"runall:" entry specifies the vaults you want to back up.

Other than that, the files look okay.  I should warn you, though, that
I am not a Dirvish expert by any means.  I got it to work, and I'm
happy with it, but it was a bit of a trial (not to mention trial and
error) to do so.  One thing that I did when I created my config files:
I put lots and lots of comments in, to tell me what each entry did,
what the options were, and sometimes _why_ they were.  :-)  Trust me,
it helps immensely when I have to modify something.  :-)  If you think
it would help, I could post my configs.  Sometimes having a working
example can be useful.

Hope this helps,

Thanks for the info.  Price wise, I can pick up 100' Cat 6 
shielded patch cables for about $35 a piece.  If I go to the 
expense and trouble of encasing them in electrical conduit 
that I bury, there shouldn't be a problem getting a signal 
between these buildings.  I don't like that I'll have to 
worry about electrical and water lines and I don't like 
that the ground is frozen hard right now, but there are 
advantages to going this route if I can.  One possibility 
is adding a second Cat 6 cable for phone service.  Obviously,
I can't bury an Ethernet cable right now.

An option I'm toying with is to get a matched set of Linksys 
WAP11 version 2.6 AP's and replace the flaky RealTek card with 
a network card.  I then need a short crossover patch cable 
that is all weather and I'll need to build a weather proof box 
that will allow a wifi signal to go  through it which I will 
mount on the outside wall of the second building 
(A metal barn).  Even outdoors if they are properly protected, 
I think that these AP's will be able to link to each other
across a 70-80 foot air gap.  The advantage of going from a 
wireless card on the Linux box to a network card hooked to 
an AP in extender mode is that I don't have to worry about 
Linux being compatible with a wireless card.  Well, I can 
also hook two APs back to back with the outside one in 
extender mode and the inside one in AP mode which will allow 
me to move the computer in the barn to a better location.

BTW: Does anyone know what kind of connector the antennas are 
screwed onto on Linksys WAP11 access points?

If you mounted the AP outside in a plastic case of some sort, you really 
shouldn't have range probs. 

Have you disabled "roaming" on the client? 

Also, you might want to consider what mode you're running, as in b, g, or n. 
What I've found is that if I'm running mixed on the AP and a client connects in 
b mode the AP will knock down the speed. Also, if you're running g mode, I've
experienced a slower speed connection at the same distance than if I was running 
in b mode.

In other words, at longer distances I'd take a slower stable bit rate of 11Mbs w. b mode
than a possibly faster but less stable connection.

Dale,

   I tried following the HOWTO Web page and find it inconsistent and
ambiguous. That's why I wrote for review of the files.

   I don't care what the bank and vault names are, as long as it works. I can
change the bank name to dirvish, since the HOWTO suggests that I need a
directory by that name containing the default.conf. As for vaults, I'm
backing up only the one host, and I want all partitions (except /proc since
that's generated on the fly, I believe) included.

   If what I have works, both files are so short that comments may well be
superfluous. I've been a firm believer in commenting directive files since
trying to figure out what I did in a FORTRAN program (on punch cards) a few
months after writing it, and having forgotten my logic and reasoning after
not running the models for a while.

Thanks,

Rich

Every time we get a heavy rain and my internet craps out in my office I 
think that I should bury a cable run.  To date I've been concerned about 
lightning discharges, which can (I am told, maybe) be picked up by long 
runs and cause problems.  The best information I've been able to get is 
that common commercial practice with a long run between buildings is 
optical fiber, and optical to Ethernet transceivers are spendy.

The connectors are reverse SMA -- all the dimensions are SMA, but the 
gender of the inner connector part are reversed from the gender of the 
threaded part.  They're hard to get, but not impossible (I think DigiKey 
had them the last time I looked, but I could be wrong -- I stopped 
looking when I saw the price of a Cantenna).

optical transcievers aren't very expensive (< $100), and fiber cable was 
actually cheaper than copper for a while (not sure if it still is).  and 
that is certainly the way to get long distance and rf/lightning immunity. 
you just need to be careful about how you get the cable run through a 
conduit, you can't pull on fiber like you can copper.

When I'm not cooking up fancy algorithms or writing software that 
embodies them I'm designing electronic hardware; the basic ground rule 
of any analog circuit design is that you've got to design it for the 
temperature range you want it to work over, test it over the temperature 
range you designed it for, then test samples off of your manufacturing 
line to make sure that everything is still doing what it's supposed to.  
Fail at any one of these three efforts and you're selling your customer 
a crap shoot.

And all that design and test time costs $$.  Unless the FCC has 
temperature requirements no one is going to test -- and the FCC 
generally only really _requires_ you to test for compliance, not operation.

Places like http://www.l-com.com/ (formerly hyperlink), wlanparts.com,

antennas you'll ever want or need.

The other advice is, don't waste your money on Linksys if you really
care about it working.  Ubiquity is only slightly more expensive (if
at all), but it's an order of magnitude better quality.  Also, any
wifi antenna you can find in a "store" is going to be crap compared to
the alternatives.

My primary laptop is a 14" T61 with SXGA+ (1440x1050).

It's an early Lenovo acquisition model with Lenovo left of the T61 on the inner
lid, and IBM on the top lid and lower right palm rest.  Hopefully the T400's
carry on the great linux support the T's have provided me all these years.

Clicking on the shut-down icon or selecting that option from the application

Using DRBD to Build High-Availability Clusters on Commodity Hardware

Charlie Schluting of LINBIT will explain how DRBD works and how people
currently use it, with enough information to get you started building
your own clusters.

DRBD stands for Distributed Replicated Block Device, and as the name
implies, allows you to replicate block devices over TCP. DRBD is
extremely flexible due to the fact it is a block device, and as such is
used in a variety of situations. At the most basic level, you can
replicate data between two servers to provide synchronously replicated
storage redundancy for either failover or disaster recovery purposes. In
active/active mode, you can also run GFS, OCFS2, or other clustered file
systems.

Topics that will be covered:
- How it works, history, and future exciting news regarding mainline
kernel inclusion
- How it is used: HA-iSCSI, HA-NFS, Virtualization, Apache, Samba, etc.
- Cluster Resource Manager options and recommendations, and news about
the confusing changes in the Linux-HA / Clusterlabs communities.

And the majority of the time will be spent on:
- Example cluster configuration: hardware setup, installation and
configuration, and cluster manager integration.

Come with questions!

Oh, I quite agree.  They *are* confusing, which is why I stuck all those
comments in my config files.  I don't want to have to wade through the
documentation (*gark!*) again.

Okay, I can see that.  The point I was trying to make was that if you
specify a directory in your bank: line, that directory has to exist, or
dirvish will fail.  I'm not certain that dirvish expects the dirvish
subdirectory to exist.  I suspect it does, though, so I built my file
structure that way.  For grins, here's what my dirvish file structure
looks like:

/mnt
`-- Backups
    |-- eddore
    |   |-- eddore-boot/...
    |   `-- <other eddore partitions>/...
    |-- musicdata
    |   `-- oggvorbis/...
    `-- valeron
        |-- <other valeron partitions>/...
        `-- valeron-home/dirvish
            |            |--default.conf
            |            `--default.hist
            |--<image_directory>
            |  |--index.bz2
            |  |--log
            |  |--summary
            |  `--tree
            |     `--<backed-up filesystem(s)>
            `--<other image directories>

My banks are /mnt/Backups/{eddore,musicdata,valeron}.  The vaults are
the next level of directories beneath those (i.e., eddore-boot,
valeron-home, oggvorbis, etc).  The vaults are listed in the runall:
entry.  (Eddore and valeron are my desktop and laptop, respectively, and
musicdata is a portable USB disk drive containing my ripped CDs.)  When
I run dirvish-runall, it executes the command "dirvish --vault <vault>"
for every vault listed under runall:.

Obviously, your setup would be much simpler, since you're backing up
your entire filesystem into one vault.  Note that dirvish creates the
default.hist file in the dirvish sub-directory.

If there are errors, dirvish will write the log and an "rsync_error"
file into the relevant image directory.  These can be very useful in
troubleshooting.  Also, I found that the strace command, especially
"strace -e trace=file" was my new best friend.  :-)

You've probably got ssh set up already, but if not, make sure that you
do.  I know the docs say that you won't need ssh if you're backing up
locally, but I found that dirvish wanted ssh there, even though I was
backing up locally.  There may be some subtlety I've missed, but it's
no big deal in this case.

Anyway, I hope this helps.

When you do a dist-upgrade from one Ubuntu to the next modifies the Grub
menu.lst file so you can still boot to the old kernel. I do this with my
desktop because the update from Intrepid to Jaunty changed the menu.lst file on
only one of the two RAID disks that it is installed on. I could fix it but I'm
too lazy. Jaunty runs fine with the old kernel.

If Ubuntu hides the Grub menu when you boot you have to hit Esc to see it.

If that doesn't resolve the issue, I don't have any other suggestions. Except I
can add that Ubuntu is famous for failing to shut down properly. Usually it
just hangs the user at a black screen, but I have read of the recycling login
window also. I'll bet you can find a lot more suggestions on the Ubuntu forums.

Well, if you can't shutdown the system using the icon, open a terminal and
type sudo /sbin/halt

Before you do that, take a look at the log files and see if something
forced it to go to a login screen rather than a halt/reboot.

Tim,

   This is apparently an Xfce4 change from the earlier versions. Now, when
the icon is clicked, the login screen (GDM) pops up with a bar along the
bottom of the screen. At the extreme right end of that bar is a white disk.
Clicking that brings up a menu to reboot, shut down, suspend, or hibernate.

   Apparently, these unmarked, non-discript icons are not sufficiently
intuitive for me to know what they do, nor that I want to click on it to get
to the shut down menu item.

Thanks,

Rich

This is also great because the stamp will eventually become hip, like

Carlos,

   There you have the solution! We start the buzz that linux is organic,
sustainable, does not contribute a carbon footprint, cures global warming,
ends global hunger, and supports corporate social responsibility. Before we
know it _everyone_ will demand linux on their hardware.

   Great idea!

Carlos,

   There you have the solution! We start the buzz that linux is organic,
sustainable, does not contribute a carbon footprint, cures global warming,
ends global hunger, and supports corporate social responsibility. Before we
know it _everyone_ will demand linux on their hardware.

   Great idea!

That is GREAT news.  You can be sure I'll be pinging everyone I buy
computers from, assuming they don't sell it with linux pre-installed.

It's strange that I can't find mention of this on the web, except for
one guy claiming it was in a newsletter and also stating that he can't
find it anywhere on the web.

No - for that to happen, linux will have to cure baldness, take
inches off the waistline, and be advertised on TV by major Hollywood
celebrities.  Makes its own gravy!  Ick ...

And tonight, I will have nightmares of overweight geeks waving
distro CDs and dancing to jingles, while cheese sauce is poured
over Tux.  To forestall that, I will go watch Zombieland at the
cheap seats, so I can have non-linux-related nightmares instead.

Maybe it's "The Loongson-2 MIPS Lemote Yeeloong Netbook", from Lemote
Corp, Changshu, Jiangsu, China,

http://www.osnews.com/story/21530

Richard Stallman had highly praised Lemote Yeeloong as the first

This came up in conversation, so I thought I'd share it with the rest of the PLUG community.

http://specialtyjobmarkets.com/

This company currently offers 26 specialty job boards. Some are totally free, and some are 
traditional recruiting services. Only people in that specialty bother to post their resumes. 
Candidates do not spam managers, managers select candidates.  

All of these job boards in are in high paying fields. For historical reasons most of our job 
boards are in software specialties. More recent job boards are in the life sciences. Healthcare
is a growing area. International business is our newest focus.

Right you are.  There are three screen sizes of Thinkpad T61, in
various resolutions.  Here are the sizes and areas in inch units:

                           X      Y     Area
Standard  14.1 in  4:3   11.3    8.5    95.4
Wide/Runt 14.1 in  8:5   12.0    7.5    89.4
Wide/Runt 15.4 in  8:5   13.1    8.2   106.6

The T60 has these three sizes:
                           X      Y     Area
Standard  14.1 in  4:3   11.3    8.5    95.4
Standard  15.0 in  4:3   12.0    9.0   108.0
Wide/Runt 15.4 in  8:5   13.1    8.2   106.6

The basic unit arrived with today, with a 15.0 inch 1400x1050
screen.  I am still waiting for the QXGA replacement screen,
15.0 inch 2048x1536.   The T61 does not have a bezel that works
with the QXGA, though it appears possible to substitute a T60
bezel and screen on top of a T61 main chassis.

My next step is to install my distro on a new 500GB Seagate on the
T60 (with the lower resolution display) and see if it works.

The only comment I have is probably irrelevant to what Keith is putting
together. 

I have a T61 and I recently discovered that the internal Intel SATA controller
is SATA-2, but Lenovo throttled it to 100 MB/s. The official explanation is to
ensure compatibility with PATA drives in the Ultrabay, in case anyone does
this. In reality, the controller would handle the issue and throttling the
SATA-2 controller was unnecessary. Another bad design decision. Nevertheless, I
am stuck with a recently acquired new SATA-2 drive that runs at only 100 GB/s.

This does not affect later Thinkpads, and I don't know if it affects the T60.

Perhaps start by working in familiar terms. Linux SME server offers a
workgroup server that can drop into many offices and creates several
opportunities along the way. The (Google) site appears to be down right
now but you can find it at: www.smeserver.org or search for "Linux SME".

I can put you in touch with a purveyor of it in Salem if you like.

Something to look at.  I've also heard stories that some Thinkpads
have slowdown problems with some very large SATA drives.  I'm booted
to my distro, installed on a Seagate SATA-2 500GB drive, and I will 
run speed tests in the morning (a cheesy C program that writes lots
of bytes to a file, then reads lots of bytes from the file).

Keith loaned me his glasses and pony tail and I started thinking...

Might a local (most of the stuff you find on Calagator) user group open
house be in order? PLUG, Ruby, Perl, Smalltalk, Drupal, POSSE, Hackathon
and on and all could all come together in one venue where each can
perhaps have a table and tell a about their group at more or less an
open mic. From there a mini conference about scheduling, Calagator and
the QUEST FOR THE ULTIMATE VENUE could take place.

Here, you can have 'em back. Thanks Keith.

100GB/s, that's the drive I want!   Seriously, for a single laptop drive of
the type that spins platters, you are not limited by a 100MB/s interface
because the drive itself is only capable of transfer rates of  60MB/s or
less.

But if the data your processor needs is already in the drive's cache,
then the fatter the pipe the better, as there's no need to wait for it
to come off the platters.

Any particular reason for rolling your own rather than using bonnie?

well, we just had a thing kind of like that, although less focused on
pitching groups, but it was an open house and many of the groups were
represented, including the calagator gods themselves!  the winter
coders' social was a great deal of fun and happened on tuesday

but that said, there's certainly room for another similar event!  the
challenge will be not stepping on anyone's user group meeting...

Are there many novice devs at these events? I was a Comp Sci major once upon a time, a time of 
Assembler, Basic, Pascal, and Fortran. But those dinosaurs are extinct now in the modern world 
of object oriented and interpreted langs...

   I know of a small company doing spatial analyses and all their code is in
FORTRAN. If you want to be modern, you can probably learn Object COBOL, or
use one of Microsoft's "visual" languages. :-)

   My son was a CS/Math major, and worked in the insurance and banking back
end industries writing COBOL code. Hated it.

i'm no rockstar coder, compsci degree notwithstanding.  there were
actually people there who weren't coders at all--and not just
significant others.  everyone there was some kinda geek though, even
if not a Geek of CompSci.  but it's a very welcoming crowd.  the beer
was free (thanks http://www.myemma.com!) and the potluck food was
divine.

i think i had the most fun playing word games, not talking shop,
though daniel johnson and i did discuss methods for heating his house
via some kind of supercomputing grant for a fair while =)

Subject: [PLUG] Progress Report -- Desktop Sharing on Ubuntu, Not
Message-ID: <4B228926.1070809@wescottdesign.com>

I wrote quite a while ago with problems with sharing my desktop under 
Ubuntu.  It looks like it ought to work, I have the remote server set up 
so that it should share the desktop all the way, yet the best I can get 
(and intermittently at that) is a view of the desktop that happens to be 
open on my machine -- this is not helpful for doing the occasional bit 
of work on the computer in my office when I'm physically up in the house.

Someone suggested using ssh.  This works after a fashion -- I can 'ssh 
-X' into the remote machine, and if I have remembered to turn off 
Thunderbird I can get my mail.  Trying to do simulation runs with Scilab 
is a disaster -- Scilab uses OpenGL, and either the way that it uses it 
or something about OpenGL disagrees with my laptop, and it will do so 
through an ssh connection even worse than on the laptop itself.

I recently upgraded both of the machines in question to 9.10, in hopes 
of improvement -- it made no substantial change (although I now have OOo 
3.1, so it's not a total washout).

Remote desktop connections with Windows, at least on a fast network, are 
easy and seamless for the user.  It sure would be nice if Linux could 
offer the same thing.

Have you looked at wrapping VNC inside of an ssh connection?  You can use
something like:

ssh 5912:timslaptop:5901 tb at laptop.local

and then connect using VNC and connecting to localhost:5912.

I'm going off the top of my head for the commands, so you might have to
play with it a bit.  Of course, this does require you to run VNC Server on
your destination computer.

Oh goody.  More dinking.

Part of what burns me is that this is Ubuntu.  It's supposed to be the 
Linux that's easy to use.  If they put the @#$% thing on the menu, why 
aren't they making it obvious what you need to do to make it work?

issues of how to share the desktop aside (i second the vote for VNC,
but that won't do what you want in terms of using your already-running
desktop remotely), GL apps are notoriously hard to do well
remotely--hell, SGI invented a proprietary protocol to do remote-GL
and even it wasn't particularly speedy, though at least it worked
between two SGI's (caveat, last time i used this was in 1999.)

if you're using hardware-accelerated GL to run scilab on your desktop,
it seems highly unlikely to me that you'll be able to attach remotely
and meaningfully interact with the display.  non-GL programs should be
fine once you get the sharing working.

scilab itself has instructions for disabling hardware acceleration to
get around rendering problems at the cost of speed (and if you end up
using VNC, the suggestions here will effectively happen automatically
since VNC is a software-only display, no hardware access used):

http://wiki.scilab.org/Graphical_issues_with_Scilab_5.0

While windows may Just Work with remote view of GL-type programs, I
can't believe the speed would be usable for something nontrivial.  Is
that really the case?

dunno, it's always worked fine for me.  these directions are pretty
explicit, perhaps they will help:

http://www.ubuntugeek.com/share-your-ubuntu-desktop-using-remote-desktop.html

(in which i found out that vino (the thing that lets you share your
desktop, rather than just attaching with standard VNC to an entirely
virtual remote display that is separate from what you see on the
console) is actually just a wrapper around VNC after all--i had no
idea!)

Because I know I can count on friends like you to tell me about
nifty programs like bonnie :-)  

The relevant results for /usr/sbin/bonnie++, as an ordinary user
with no command line options, for my SATA desktop (7200rpm), the
SATA T60 (7200rpm), and my old PATA T30 (5400rpm), in MB/sec, are:

                       	DESK	T60	T30
Sequential Block Read:  70.2	73.9	41.5
Sequential Block Write: 55.8	65.9	35.1

... and a derived number:
Read speed KB/RPM-sec:	 9.754	10.257	7.684

The speed difference between the desktop and the T60 surprises
me a little,  but the desktop uses a WD "green" harddrive that
may be suboptimal for Linux.  Sure is quiet inside that sound-
dampened case, though, quieter than the laptop!

The main difference seems related to the drive rotation speed.
I'd be curious about other folk's results. 

Keith

P.S. as an aside, the 500GB Seagate ST905003N3A1AS-RK notebook
hard drive ($90 from Frys) lists Windows, Mac, or *Linux* as 
system requirements.  No picture of Tux with the windoze and
mac symbols on the side, but a great first step nonetheless.
I guess they assume we can read ...

Subject: [PLUG] gnome window content display problems,
 Intel video on DellD620, Karmic upgrade
Message-ID: <4B22A5F2.3080403@easystreet.net>

**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
i upgraded my Dell D620 (work) laptop Jaunty from to Karmic (32-bit).

Video hardware according to lspci is: Intel Corporation Mobile 
945GM/GMS/GME, 943/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)

kernel 2.6.31-16

i had the "white screen of death" problem after the upgrade, which was 
fixed after installing xserver-xorg-video-intel from the recovery console.

Now i have a really frustrating problem of window content not displaying 
properly in lists and tabs. Specifically:

- lists, such as in the "Processes" tab of System Monitor, or Nautilus 
windows in list view, or the list of apps in Startup Manager, don't 
display correctly. They generally apprear blank, and i need to drag the 
mouse over the content area to display the contents - and the display 
doesn't "stick" reliably. It seems like the content area isn't updating 
properly (System Monitor updates the Processes tab frequently, so the 
display blanks shortly after i move the mouse over it to force things to 
display).

- Some apps that support multiple tabbed documents (gedit, gnome 
terminal) display ok with only one doc/tab, but show the same behavior 
as lists as soon as a second tab/document is opened.

Googling hasn't turned up anything. Suggestions most welcome. i'd like 
to avoid a clean install on this machine.

poe is quite nice.  it lets you use the standard ethernet twisted pair 
connection to deliver power to small bits of hardware (voip phones, waps, 
etc).  you can get a poe switch to provide power, or poe injectors to add 
poe to a single run.

a thing to consider--did you tune with hdparm at all?  i detune my
(bedroom, caseless) fileserver drives so they'll be quieter (hdparm
-M), but i've gotten severely enhanced (like, double) results after
playing with some of the other settings.  i guess i have no idea if
they have as much effect on SATA drives as they did on PATA drives,
but i bet they still have some effect.  might be worthwhile if you're
going to the trouble of doing comparative studies anyway =)

sadly i don't have enough free disk space on this machine to run a
test right now :/

Subject: [PLUG] Embedded Linux meet-up summary: 2009-12-10
Message-ID: <4B22BEEF.30708@zenlinux.com>

Last night I was pleasantly surprised when seven other folks showed up
at Staccato Gelato for the first PLUG embedded Linux meet-up. We had a
diverse range of interests represented, from the "curious, wanting to
learn more" camp to folks working on embedded projects at various levels
  - from x86 appliances to low-power ARM/PowerPC devices to
microcontroller projects. There was also some discussion about

Announcements:

Maemo.org is holding its first bugday next Tuesday, 12/15. Drop by the
#maemo-bugs channel on the FreeNode IRC network to get involved.

http://blogs.gnome.org/aklapper/2009/12/07/maemo-org-bugday-dec-15th-1800-0300-utc/

Project Ideas:

I'm going to start a second email thread shortly to describe some of the
project ideas that were discussed. It would be great to see if any of 
these ideas could take off.

Note: I'm currently following-up on some info from the attendees to make 
sure I have the right info on this list, so that email will likely go 
out later this weekend.

Group Resources:

Absent any objections, our plan is to use this mailing list for embedded 
Linux discussions until it becomes apparent that we really need a new 
mailing list resource. This should help keep our actions visible to 
other potentially interested members of PLUG and encourage growth during 
our establishment.

At some point we may also need a few other online resources, such as a 
wiki or source code repository. In most cases there are plenty of free 
resources out there (e.g, SourceForge/Google Apps/GitHub) for open 
source projects. I think it's best just to play this by ear and get 
things set up on an as-needed basis.

Upcoming Meetings:

I'm not sure if Staccato Gelato is going to work as our main meeting
location, as the place filled up with some families later in the evening
and it became pretty challenging for everyone to hear each other. My
feeling for now is to hold off on scheduling another meet-up until a
clear meeting agenda arises, and then figure out where to host it.

In the meantime, I think I was somehow tricked into doing an upcoming 
Advanced Topics presentation on OpenEmbedded. :) So keep an eye out for 
that.

Just beware that not all PoE powered devices are IEEE Standard 802.3af
PoE.  Lots of devices I deal with are something called "passive" poe
where there is no handshaking protocols, and the end devices are
typically expecting less than the "standard" 48V.  For example,
virtually all of the Ubiquiti gear uses "passive" PoE in the range
from about 10-24 Volts or something (from memory, please check).  The
Nanostation comes with a little injector that just puts a nominally
12V DC power supply on the ethernet cable (two wires +12V, two wires
ground).  There is some resistive voltage loss in long runs of
cabling.  It is not uncommon for people to use 15V or 18V in
situations like that.  In anything under about 100 feet, the supplied
12V adapter is going to be just fine.

http://qce-ga.sourceforge.net/

The 0.6.6 driver works with the 2.6.10 kernel, but I can't get it to compile
with the 2.6.27.39 kernel.  I type make all and the next thing I know  
the source has deleted completely.  I hate to drop down to the 2.6.10  
kernel,
but I really want the camera to work where it looks like I need a new
release of the driver for newer 2.6 kernels.

On a side note, I went ahead and ordered two Invictus wireless outdoor b/g
WAPS.  It was spendy, but I figure this is a better bet than trying to come
up with a Linux compatible wireless card to replace the flaky RealTek 8180l.

I can run the 2.6.10 kernel, but if I don't have to I don't want to.

Has the driver being rolled into the kernel recently under a name I don't
recognize?

Subject: [PLUG] tracking/accounting for memory use
Message-ID: <86my1prqvk.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I've got a problem tracking down where memory is disappearing to on an
embedded linux platform.  I know basically about caches and buffers
and such and have looked at /proc/meminfo and /proc/slabinfo and kind
of understand about how slabs work.  However, I don't know what
numbers in /proc/meminfo are supposed to add up to what in a way that
is going to give me clues where the memory is disappearing to.

A little more detail.  We've got a bunch of Netgear WGT634U devices
running a customized OpenWrt scattered around town and we collect data
from them every 5 minutes or so via SNMP.  We have Cacti graphs of
memory utilization, e.g.:

  https://personaltelco.net/graphs/graph.php?action=view&local_graph_id=253&rra_id=all

We are running NoCatAuth (a captive portal system that uses Perl),
OpenVPN, OLSRd and SNMPd.  The WGT634U has 32 meg of RAM.  After a
reset, we usually have about 18 megabytes in free+cache+buffers.  Over
time, that total tends to degrade down to about 14 meg (or less), at
which time we become more susceptible to running out of memory during
forking (e.g. the NoCatAuth software forks 10 processes for every
authorization).  Typically, we see the failure in NoCat which causes
it to die (breaking our node in the process), but sometimes other
programs die instead.  Usually, the system stays running and we get
alerted and we can log in and fix it, but with 30-50 of these and a
1/week failure rate, we have to fix a few every day, which is
annoying.

When I have looked, it did not *seem* that our userspace programs were
growing fast enough to account for the degradation in
free+cache+buffers, but maybe I was looking at the wrong thing.
Busybox ps is only giving me VSZ and not RSS.  Can someone suggest a
robust way of tracking memory usage?  I am particularly interested in
figuring out and accounting for what userspace is using, and what the
kernel is using, to see what exactly is growing so that I can make it
stop!

Grateful for any pointers.  Thanks!

OK.  I seem to need to embarrass myself in some public forum before I 
can get things like this working.  Thankfully, this list provides the forum.

Ubuntu, in it's infinite wisdom, has provided a mutually incompatible 
set of features: the whiz-bang "desktop effects" feature, and vino, the 
VCN wrapper to talk to a remote desktop.

So, with desktop effects turned off I can remote into my desktop in my 
office (I'm doing it right now from the comfort of my family room 
upstairs) and use already-opened programs.  This, in turn, means that I 
can leave Thunderbird on all the time so I can go back to responding to 
email promptly.

Whee hee.  This has been a terrible week money wise (I've been too sick 
from a cold to really get any significant paying work done) but boy I'm 
getting some long standing ankle-biter level computer problems resolved!

Now I just need a faster network...

This isn't what you want to hear, but I would be concerned about an 
18/14 difference between life and death.  Are you sure that your problem 
isn't heap fragmentation, instead of lack of raw memory?  Heap memory is 
a notorious cause of problems in embedded system, and a notoriously 
popular resource among desktop programmers (which is one reason why 
embedded programmers tend to sneer at desktop programmers).

If the kernel has different flavors of heap it may be that it's running 
out of one and not another, and you can shake the cereal down in the box 
a bit by reapportioning how it uses them.

Hi Joe,

I'm running the exact same laptop and video card hardware as you. I have 
not had any of the issues you described, and I have a fresh install of 
Ubuntu Karmic on my machine.

I do not have an xorg.conf file to share, as apparently everything is 
working in auto-detection mode. If you would like to compare other 
config files with me, feel free to ask.

Are you running the desktop effects? If so, try disabling them and see 
if you have the same problem.

Scott

Which suggests PoE systems aren't all to one standard. I know they come
in different speeds, and have suspected (haven't researched) whether
different PoE adapters of the same rated speed are compatible.

In addition, they can't be connected to surge suppressors, as the signal
used over the power line is filtered by such.

However, I have a pair of 200MBps PoEs at home, and it doesn't matter
that they're connected to different circuit breakers. Though as I
understand it, 85MBps PoE connections over different circuit breakers is
slower than 10Mbps Ethernet.

It sounds like you're confusing power line communications with power over
ethernet. They're basically polar opposites of each other.

that looks like a perl script, and that error message looks to be from

#!/usr/bin/perl

but i could be wrong.  free to try tho :)

Chris,

   I think you're absolutely correct! Let me try ... yes, you are.

   Now there's another error:

Undefined subroutine &main::seppuku called at /usr/local/sbin/dirvish line
223.

   This came from the dirvish site tarball. So, tomorrow I'll see if there's
another copy of the script that's error free.

Much appreciated,

Rich

You're missing the first two lines, and it looks like line three got
truncated:

#!/usr/bin/perl

$CONFDIR = "/etc/dirvish";



#       $Id: dirvish.pl,v 12.0 2004/02/25 02:42:15 jw Exp $  \
$Name: Dirvish-1_2 $

(I don't know why there's such a gap between lines two and three.  I
split line three with the backslash, since autowrap makes long lines
like this turn into gibberish.)

Re: Surge suppressors as they relate to a PoE connection, anyone have
experience as to whether they are compatible? If they use the same
MOVs/arrestors as on the 120V power line then it wouldn't be a
concern, ignoring HF effects.

Not interested in deploying them, just curious.

The kernel allocates things in blocks (slabs) of like-sized objects to
minimize fragmentation.  So, no I don't think fragmentation is my
problem.

I think my problems with NoCatAuth were due to rapidly forking from a
~4meg perl process putting pressure on the memory system.
Empirically, this was more likely to trigger failure when the
free+cache+buffers was at or below 14meg.  This was a symptom of the
memory leak.  Patching over the symptom could slow down the problem,
make it take longer to manifest itself (in fact, I found a way to do
that too, see below), but I really wanted to find and fix the
underlying problem.

Tim> If the kernel has different flavors of heap it may be that it's
Tim> running out of one and not another, and you can shake the cereal

I think I have identified the problem with the gradually eroding
free+cache+buffers.  As usual, formulating the problem for others
helped to get me thinking clearly about what was happening and what I
was seeing.

Basically, busybox ps only shows VSZ which is the size of the process
in virtual memory.  I was NOT seeing substantial changes in VSZ.  All
of that virtual memory isn't allocated physical memory until it is
actually needed.  What was putting pressure on the memory was growing
RSS (Resident Set Size), which was not readily visible to me.  When I
installed procps and used its /usr/bin/ps, I saw that one of my
processes was indeed growing substantially RSS-wise from the initial
warmup after boot over the course of a few days.  Restarting the
process recovers the memory.  Luckily it is a program that can easily
restore its own state, so restarting it once a day (until its apparent
leak is fixed) is not a hardship.

Setting /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory to 1 (always overcommit), I
seem to have solved the problem of NoCatAuth dying while forking
children.

Still perhaps slightly early to declare victory, but I'm feeling
pretty good about it right now.

Anyway, thanks for letting me ask even if only because it helped me
figure it out myself.

Dale,

   Isn't this interesting? This is from the tarball (or ZIP file) downloaded
from the Web site. All I did was copy it without the .pl extension from the
original directory to /usr/local/sbin and chmod 755.

   That was all in there.

   Blank lines are ignored.

   There's still the error on line 210 I need to fix. Haven't gone yet to the
main site to seek a working copy of the script.

Thanks,

Thanks, Scott - my clean install on different hardware has no problem, 
the "white screen of death" on intel on-board video i ssurprisingly 
common on upgrade installations.

i should have added that the problematic symptoms persist without any 
desktop effects at all, and even in a "failsafe Gnome" login.

Given your experience, i'll probably just bite the bullet and do a clean 
install, especially now that i remembered an old external USB drive in 
my closet that's big enough to back up my home dir with all its

Message-ID: <20091212210640.GA26556@gate.kl-ic.com>

Rich and others interested in dirvish:

Go to http://www.dirvish.org/mailman/listinfo/dirvish and sign up
for the mailing list.  Or just look at the list archive, which you
can search using google "site:www.dirvish.org/pipermail your_query"

It is a low volume list, a couple dozen emails a month, about 300
subscribers.  Almost everybody on the list joined to ask dirvish
questions, then hung around to answer other people's questions.
Some people sign up, ask questions, then unsubscribe a month or
two after dirvish is running.  So far, very low flamage and asshole
content.

Dirvish is the kind of tool that is somewhat hard to understand and
set up, but after you do, it just disappears into the background.
Paradoxically, that means that some of the six month users are better
at answering newbie questions than many of the people that have been
using it the longest. 

Some of us have not done any major configuration in years, beyond
copying and modifying an initialization script or two that we
built in /usr/local/sbin .  It is a lot easier to set up and
maintain if you build a few shell scripts to personalize it to
your site.  Some of us share some of those scripts on the wiki
at http://wiki.dirvish.org/index.cgi?ExampleSystems .

Message-ID: <20091212212630.GB26556@gate.kl-ic.com>

The most significant attraction of Linux/Unix for me is how easy
it is to do "cheap programming" - shell scripts, perl scripts, etc.
I am a mediocre programmer, but with Linux and a little bit of
knowledge I am able to automate many small tasks.  This usually
means that I forget how to run some commands, because I have buried
them in scripts in /usr/local/bin or ~/bin .  Since I can *read* the
scripts later on (especially if I add a few lines of comments) that
is actually an automated way to remember stuff without wasting a 
lot of attention on it.

Many PLUG members seem to spend most of their time in GUI-land. 
Which is good, if all the visual metaphors are consistent and the
right tools are available.   But it is much harder to automate
small hacks that way - you become dependent on others who are
skilled with gtk or qt and c++, who spend days to months polishing
their creations with check boxes and options.

So, I'm curious ... how many of us know enough to write quick shell
scripts?  How many of us know how to write quick 5 minute GUI hacks?  

Perhaps I can help teach some scripting, and learn some GUI hacking
from others.  The real value of open source systems is that they
empower us to create, not just consume.

I do both. But my GUI hacks are generally webapps. This is because I
am a web developer, and I have a convenient web container for such
occasions. I am interested in playing around with ncurses at some
point. Being a product of the 80s, I have an affinity for plain text
output.

Most of my work is in scripts.  I do other programming when needed.
Not much GUI

Don't know what I can lend to the group until the discussion get
narrower.  There are probably better script
jockeys than I but I get the job done when needed.  Current work is
scripts inside of Makefiles for build
automation and rpm creation.

I would like to know about basic shell scripting. At the moment I know next to
nothing. 

I would attend a class for beginners. Having said that, maybe it would be
possible to do a web-based class. Moodle? Exercises for the student to do? A
professor who will check for questions several times a day? Or does this
already exist somewhere on the web? If not, could the creation of such a
web-based instruction program become a PLUG project?

I can do simple things in BASH (pipelining commands) and I understand conditional logic such
as for while next if. I've attempted to learn Perl a few times but to no avail. I've done 
a few tutorials with Ruby & Python.

I'd be greatly appreciative of anything I could learn about scripting for general 
Sys Admin tasks. Although I don't have much to offer in exchange...

Keith,

   I was about to do this.

   This is part of my confusion. The HOWTO specifies /usr/local/sbin, but the
install.sh script puts the executable in /usr/bin/. Sigh.

   Yes, I had only a partial tarball. This morning I downloaded it again and
all the requisite files are now present (with owner.group of keith.keith in
the tarball). Running the init script fails 'cause dirvish is now looking
for the main binary in /usr/local/sbin, but the install script suggested
/usr/bin as its default. There's a lot of ambiguity that I see here, not
only in the location of the executable scripts but what should be in a
vault.

   I'm off to subscribe to the mail list and read the wiki.

Thanks,

Rich

   A GUI-based approach to writing shell scripts. Isn't that oxymoronic?

Good reminder!  Actually, what little "GUI" stuff I've written has
also been webapps, simple respond-to-webform stuff for my websites. 

Which leads to a question:  is there an easy way to run some subset of
webscripts locally on a machine, without the complexities of apache? 

Ideally, it would consist of some programs on the machine that 
respond to html requests on special ports by running small scripts
in /usr/local/web (for example), wrapping those scripts with enough
html stuff to talk to the browser.  The browser might have a plugin
so that when it sees a request for a naked word "URL" it tries the
program hanging on the local port before it looks on the rest of
the web.

As an example, I could type "bacon" into firefox, and it would go
to port 8088 (say) and ask the program watching the port to look
for /usr/local/web/bacon, wrap it as needed, and run it.  If there
is no /usr/local/web/bacon or ~/web/bacon, firefox does its usual
thing with barewords, which in my setup is do a google search for
the word bacon.  

That would allow me to run local scripts, perhaps with some graphic
content, via the local browser.  Then I could deploy the same or
similar scripts through apache on a real website.  Democratized
small webapps?

Actually, John, you are one of the people I was thinking about when
I wrote that.  The best way to learn bash script basics is by doing
it.  Perhaps we can do "script improv" night at PLUG advanced topics
(this would actually be remedial advanced topics) where folks bring
in some small tasks they want to automate and we automate them.  

Two easy ways to get started with scripting, though.  

1) look for some small shell scripts on your system that do something
you understand, and learn to read them, using google to help you
figure out what each line or word does.  There are probably thousands
of 10 line or less bash scripts on your system to look at.

2) Make some of your command line interface calls into scripts.
That is, use vi to write a two line text file that does something
that you do regularly, and store it in your personal bin directory.

For example, the contents of /home/john/bin/fredspy might be:
-------------------------
#!/bin/bash
/bin/ls -tr /home/john/spyvideos/fred/
-------------------------
With /home/john/bin in your PATH, and with that script "chmod"ed
to 755, typing "fredspy" on the command line will list all the files
in the directory ~/spyvideos/fred/ (presumably videos from the
secret spycam you've hidden in fred's house).  

That is a boring example, but I do short scripts like that a lot,
to save typing and to help me remember how to do something.  Often,
my scripts are small mutations of scripts I previously wrote.

For extra bonus points, can anyone write a short script for John
that will help him do task 1?  Probably "find" feeding "grep"
(for /bin/bash) with some additional filters for short length
scripts or scripts with lots of comments.

Keith

I guess I would have to argue that apache is a fairly simple tool to
use, especially for running web utilities like the ones we are
describing here. You can almost get away with the default
configuration, if you're willing to put all your scripts into one big
DocumentRoot. There are even smaller HTTP servers, but apache isn't
all that big, and it's rock solid.

You could get your "bacon" URL scheme to work by using a local DNS
server. Just have BACON be a CNAME for the host. Then configure apache
on that host to have a vhost entry that matches "bacon". The request
will make it to the host, and apache will know what to do with it once
it arrives there.

Writing a socket listening program from scratch is more of a pain than
it is worth. It is much, much easier to use an existing, stable,
well-tested daemon. Apache is a great tool for this. Did you know that
you can run a /bin/sh script as a CGI?  Anything that is executable is
fair game. Let apache do the work of marshalling requests, and save
your efforts for the actual scripts.

Speaking of apache/HTML, I would really appreciate it if someone could
point me to the HTML CGI verbiage needed to call a function to return
the _initial_ contents of a user-changeable text/numeric box. I found
many many functions for calling a function on this, that, the other
thing, butterfly flapping its wings in Central Park, etc. etc. etc.
NOTHING that would provide initialization at runtime (initial page
load) via a CGI call, static HTML page.

I looked around for a couple weeks on and off and then gave up. What
did I miss? Shirley there must be something...

TIA,

i do small bash scripts, with a bit of sed, all the time for managing my 
personal stuff (i have a bunch of rsync scripts), and for cleaining up & 
massaging text (much of it xml and csv) at work. i'm a java developer by 
trade, but use a lot of scripting tools (esp. Ant) to manage various 
aspects of the development lifecycle (build, deploy, etc.)

i'm definitely interested in learning more about Bash (O'Reilly's Bash 
Cookbook is great), and Python. Never took to Perl, as much as i love 
the *ix shell environment for doing "just good enough" to get things 
done. Having to work on a Windows command line is pure pain (though 
Cygwin helps).

well, what you describe can't be done.  but maybe you're not describing 
what you want adequately?  you can possibly accomplish your goal by 
putting html fields of type hidden into your form to track the original

I won't do those things. There is not enough motivation to do it unless I need
to get something done. 

You are 100% correct that "the best way to learn bash script basics [or
anything else on the computer] is by doing it." I do have a couple very
simple scripts that I concocted for things I needed to do. I created them
mostly by copying and pasting examples suggested in forums and e-lists. But
once I got them working I was no longer interested. 

The advantage of a class is that it provides structure. I want to know
scripting, but won't get around to learning it on my own. But if I commit to a
class there is a bit of shame involved if I fail to show up, fail to do the
homework, fail to contribute in class, and so on. Everyone needs a bit of
structure like that; it's what keeps schools in business.

If we create a web-based class it would need some kind of structure too. That
may be difficult to create, and might be a good reason for abandoning the idea.

Years ago in Portland there were two main vocational schools competing for
insurance training. One was traditional live instruction and the other was
cassette tape based. The traditional school had a continual dropout rate of
~20%. The tape school's dropout rate was always over 80%. 

You can teach a little bit of scripting a tiny bit at a time with something
like an improv night, but if you want people to really learn scripting you need
something more formal.

   As I continue reading dirvish documentation before trying a dry-run I
learn the benefits of maildir to mbox germane to snapshot backups. 'Tis
better to back up new messages individually than the entire mbox file for
each day's change. So, while mbox has served me well there's now reason to
change formats.

   A Google search turns up many scripts, including mb2md. But what I've not
seen is a guide to what else I need to do so the conversion works with my
locally-installed MTA: postfix.

   I would appreciate pointers to learn what I need to adjust before or after
running the mb2md script on each ~/mail/* file.

   Let me add, too, that we're currently using POP rather than IMAP, 'cause
It Just Woiks. If I should switch from POP to IMAP while I'm doing all this
changing, please point me to stuff to read ... again in the postfix context.

I know enough to write quick shell scripts, but I don't often do it 
unless it's for some unique twist to a makefile.

Define GUI hack!  Can I, in 5 minutes, even _find_ where Scilab or 
OpenOffice keeps it's UI code to change things to my liking?  Nope.  Do 
I have the courage (or foolhardiness)?  Nope.  Or do you mean there's 
GUI things that are there for me to hack?

Probably 10 or 11 years ago, I took a web based Linux class at Clackamas 
Community College. As I recall, it included a fair amount of scripting. 
I don't know if it's still offered, but perhaps that, or one offered by 
one of the other community colleges, might fit the bill. Of course, they 
aren't free (as in beer).

Another idea might be to build our own class around something like this 
free (as in beer) tutorial download:

At work, production crews can't program, but [shell] scripting is not
"real" programming by department standards.  As much as I'd like to
truly do some application programming to make my job easier, scripting
is all I can get away with for now.  I would be miserable without the
shell and the ease with which I can automate tasks.

I've written the following (as examples):
DOS scripts generators
directory tree generators with file count statistics
size limited file copies (e.g. 300MB at a time)

I was hired because I knew how to manipulate DOS, but that's like
getting hired to cauterize wounds with a steel poker.  bash (and other
scripting languages) make life so much more humane!

Rich,

Should you change your mind, the switch from POP to IMAP was relatively 
painless.  I deleted the POP account and created the IMAP account.  I 
use Gmail and had to enable IMAP.  Even this self taught truck driver 
did it...

To the best of my knowledge on a new install of Slackware, Alsa is the default
sound engine but it's usually not configured.

You have to be root to run it. If not is should be in the alsa-utils pkg.

There you go. We have a textbook.

It needs a lot more exercises. And the examples are not well explained - I had
no idea how they worked. But that is the purpose of an instructor.

here:

http://www.xaraxtreme.org/Developers/xara-xtreme-for-linux-build-instructions.html

I have gotten through the instructions down to the ./configure command, but
then it fails because apparently it is looking for wxwidgets 2.6.3. All I can

wxBase 2.8.10-5.fc11
wxGTK 2.8.10-5.fc11
wxGTK-gl 2.8.10-5.fc11

There is an i586 and an x86_64 package for each of the above, and I have
installed all of them.

At the end of the ./configure command I get:

checking wxWidgets version... ./configure: line 8071: wx-config: command not
found not found
configure: error: wxWidgets is required. Try --with-wx-config.

I tried adding --with-wx-config, but got the same error message.

Back in my Ubuntu days I could tell Synaptic to "force-version" and, if the
older version was still in the repos, I could install it instead of the latest
and greatest. But I can't figure out how to do that in RPM-land.

Need suggestions.

Never mind, I finally got it working. 

I found a different build here:

http://www.xaraxtreme.org/Developers/develeopers-source-code-a-building.html

The "not stripped" binary version works. No need to compile and suffer any
further. :)

Ok, say you want to do a debugger using a web browser. You have a box
with, say, memory or register contents. How do you initialize that box
with what's currently in the item of interest?

Bruce,

   I appreciate that imap allows one to read mail stored on a server using
multiple devices, but I have no current need for that. There are only two of
us here with mail accounts. My wife has no need to read or write mail when
she's away from the house, and I use my laptop and ssh to the serve when I'm
away on business. Nothing I do is so critical that I need e-mail access all
the time. If something needs my immediate attention I can be reached by cell
phone when away from the office.

   Thanks for the encouraging comments.

Rich

i think what you want is:
Reg1: <input type="text" name="reg1" value="deadbeef"><br/>

which makes an input box prefilled with deadbeef.

of course with a cgi you would get the real value to put there.

Subject: [PLUG] Embedded Linux Project Ideas
Message-ID: <4B252D49.9070405@zenlinux.com>

As I mentioned in a previous post, this email thread is intended to
track potential embedded Linux projects to pursue. Below I will list to
the best of my recollection/notes what people came up with at the
meeting, but we are also welcoming ideas from people who did not attend
the meeting. If this email thread gets too long I'll happily migrate it
to a wiki page.

Please feel free to correct me if I'm inadvertently including any
misinformation below.

*** Personal Telco Project/OpenWrt ***

The Personal Telco Project is quite active and doing lots of work with
wireless routers and the OpenWrt Linux distro. Russell Senior has a 
number of projects people could jump in on, including:

* We need to bring up a bootloader (either u-boot or redboot) on a 
PePLink WINTI board (from the SkyPilot SkyExtender devices)

* We'll need to add support for the WINTI board to OpenWrt

* We are currently working on debugging a memory leak in OpenWrt (seeing 
it on both Netgear WGT634U and Alix)

Another idea that was mentioned was taking some of the OpenWrt-capable 
routers that have a USB port and turning them into home wireless 
automation control devices through the addition of a USB to serial port 
adapter and the required software. Many home lighting systems are 
serial-based as well as other sensor devices.

http://www.personaltelco.net/

http://openwrt.org/

*** Open Source Board Support Kit/SDK for MikroTik RouterBoard ***

Michael Dexter mentioned that he would like to see the development of an 
open source board support kit and SDK aimed toward students using an 
open hardware single board computer. Michael will need to confirm this, 
but I believe the hardware platform he had in mind for this was the 
MikroTik RouterBoard:

http://www.routerboard.com/pricelist.php?group_id=11

One might consider taking the Linux from Scratch tutorial and adapting 
it to include details about a particular board.

http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/

*** Thermostat which Accounts for Humidity ***

Michael also noted that an idea he would find useful would be a 
thermostat system which takes into account the humidity level, to create 
a more consistent human comfort level. This would be more of a low-level 
project involving some hardware hacking.

*** Microcontroller-based Garage Door Control System ***

Galen talked about how useful it would be to have his garage door close 
automatically after a certain amount of idle time (e.g, 10 minutes) to 
eliminate nagging worries of whether he remembered to close the garage 
door upon leaving for work. This would be more of a low-level project 
involving some hardware hacking.

*** Handheld Public Transit Tracker ***

This is a pretty ambitious project, but one that might also have some 
commercial viability. Currently smartphone users enjoy mobile 
applications that allow them to see the status of public transit lines 
in the immediate area (e.g, when the next bus is coming and how to get 
to the stop). There are many people who could use this kind of mobile 
application, but do not want or cannot afford a smartphone. What kinds 
of devices are out there (such as the Nokia N810 and Clarion MIND) which 
have embedded GPS chips and web access that could be used to develop a 
proof of concept application like this? Once that is done, the next step 
would be to "cost" the device into the minimum hardware necessary to 
perform the service (e.g, a touchscreen is not likely a requirement, etc).


These were some of the ideas thrown around during the meetup last 
Thursday. The intention of this email and email thread is to see if any 
of them "stick" enough that at least a couple of people are willing to 
start working on them.

Please add your own feedback and/or suggest ideas of your own!

The lack of open source hardware designs was something discussed at the 
embedded Linux meetup last Thursday. I stumbled across this blog post 
which is quite relevant to the discussion:

http://antipastohw.blogspot.com/2009/03/introducing-open-source-hardware.html

I have no idea of the status of the project otherwise.

This is a project for company use and doesn't have much
public/community application, but I would gladly appreciate
development assistance, paid or otherwise.  No official name yet; I've
been referring to it as the Moonman Delivery Management System.

It has three components:
Field Computers
Data Manager
Web Server

The field computers will either be Hawkboard or Beagleboard SBCs
running linux with a GPS Receiver and a Barcode Scanner.  Their job is
to be issued a chunk of the master database (or whole thing depending
on space) and then to direct the operator to various destinations
using audio prompts.  No visual display.  All user input will be done
by entering command codes via the barcode scanner.  When a delivery is
made, the operator scans the deliver command code, the item, and the
customer ID from the delivery roster (printed off the web, via CUPS,
etc).  Think of it is a newspaper delivery on steroids.  The cost of
the items beind delivered and the possible speed increases justify the
cost of the system.

The job of the Data Manager is to link up with the field computers and
to update the master database with what the field computer collected
or modified.  As a side, this could also include GPS mapping
information collected while wandering about.  Linking should
(hopefully) be done via the device USB port on the SBC.

The Web Server will provide a slick user interface for the
technologically challenged.

I'll be doing the development myself, but I'll be publishing on
sf.net.  If someone wants to help with the coding (like web, which I
just can't do) and get paid for it, make me an offer.  I'm currently
waiting on the delivery of a Hawkboard to start the brunt of the
debugging and testing.

Thanks!

This sounds great!

However, looking at the Free Geek class calendar I don't see it scheduled.

A guide as such is probably not warranted; open the postconf man page
from section 5 (not 1!) and search for 'maildir'.

Most likely due to lack of interest. I can't imagine too many

If that's the case, and we have a few people from the list interested in
taking such a class, maybe we can fix it.

If the Free Geek person conducting the class is no longer available, Keith
has already volunteered. But if that doesn't work out, I could do it.
hopefully Free Geek still has the curriculum and class materials in a box
somewhere, as that's the part I can't do.

Subject: [PLUG] Nautilus sees files, but cp does not
Message-ID: <20091213133059.5765da83@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I am trying to tidy up my migration from Jaunty to Fedora 11. The Fedora
installation is on a brand new hard disk, and the Jaunty disk is in the
Ultrabay adapter for my Thinkpad, all nicely mounted.

For some reason Nautilus refuses to let me drag and drop certain files, yet
does allow others. For example, in my ~/Desktop/ folder on the Jaunty disk are
three PDF files:

App Ling Fall 08 Newsletter.pdf
App Ling Spring 07 Newsletter.pdf
App Ling Spring 09 Newsletter.pdf

Nautilus shows the first and last of these three files with a big fat X on
them, like they're owned by someone other than me, but the middle one is fine.
Nautilus will let me drag and drop the middle one, but not the other two.

I have no idea why - all the files in my old home folder should have the same
ownership and permissions (the old Jaunty me). If Nautilus thinks the owner of
the files on the Jaunty disk is different it should refuse to let me copy any of
them, not just random ones.

I could change the ownerships and permissions on the Jaunty disk, but I don't
want to do that just in case I decide I want to put the disk back into the
computer and boot to Jaunty. Instead I thought I would just copy the offending
files as root, then chown them to the new Fedora me.

That's where things are weird. The cp command does not even see the files that
have the X on them. Using tab for the above three files displays only the
middle one, as though the others don't exist. And I'm doing it as root. Man cp
doesn't tell me anything useful.

I also discovered that I cannot run Nautilus as root. The command #nautilus
throws up a page of error messages and then quits.

I could use some enlightenment and suggestions.

I just e-mailed Free Geek with a request for further information. They won't be
open until Tuesday 11 am. Hopefully soon thereafter I/we will get a response.

Not exactly what you describe, but Lynx has a "simulated CGI" mode.
Doesn't help much since you cannot get much more out of a Lynx session
than you can with standard I/O or dialog/whiptail/zenity, but at least
it demonstrates that the idea isn't so far out.

I guess depending on what you really need, you could have scripts
writing to a named FIFO and have Fx read that; it would be one-way
generated content only, but I can imagine uses for it.

It works too; I just tried it with:

$ mkfifo /tmp/Test
$ while (:); do date > /tmp/Test; done

Now I look at 'file:///tmp/Test' in Fx and see the date, reload to see
it updated, etc.

You could also do something with a local HTTP proxy, I think.

Your FIFO idea is interesting, but it doesn't simulate the interactive
nature of a real CGI environment, it just simulates a file. A CGI
environment is interactive and can accept information from the user
and respond to it.

The original poster isn't actually looking for a simulation...they
just want a lightweight HTTP server. An example that comes to mind is
Sinatra, which is an extremely lightweight web framework for Ruby,

  http://www.sinatrarb.com/

If you view that URL you can see in about 15 seconds how you use it.
There is probably a language neutral web server that does things with
similar ease. Maybe somebody can suggest something.

Another temptation may be to rig the browser to simulate the server
component itself, perhaps using some extension or plugin. This would
be bad, as it has a huge potential for scary security threats.

This is a similar thing for Python:
http://bottle.paws.de/

In the simplest case, you can have it run it's own web server and map
URLs to Python functions in just a few lines.

Yes. Exactly. Precisely. But what does _that_ look like?  It's been
way too long to recall anything about this issue so please forgive if
it's absurdly obvious, but I have to skedaddle at the moment. I'll be

Wil,

   After reading the man page and
<http://rimuhosting.com/knowledgebase/linux/mail/Postfix mbox to Maildir
conversion> I still have a couple of questions they don't answer. At least I
don't see the answers there.

   In /etc/postfix/main.cf I have:

# DELIVERY TO MAILBOX
#
# The home_mailbox parameter specifies the optional pathname of a
# mailbox file relative to a user's home directory. The default 
# mailbox file is /var/spool/mail/user or /var/mail/user.  Specify
# "Maildir/" for qmail-style delivery (the / is required).
#
#home_mailbox = Mailbox
#home_mailbox = Maildir/

# The mail_spool_directory parameter specifies the directory where
# UNIX-style mailboxes are kept. The default setting depends on the
# system type.
#
#mail_spool_directory = /var/mail
mail_spool_directory = /var/spool/mail

and my mail is delivered to /var/spool/mail/rshepard where alpine sees it as
INBOX. I also have a directory ~/mail/ which contains the mbox files for
individual mail lists and other categories where I save messages.

   My two questions are:

   1) Do I create ~/Maildir and uncomment that line in main.cf in addition to
~/mail, or as a replacement for it?

   2) If the above is 'yes,' do I create that directory prior to converting
the mbox files to maildir directories?

   I'm running cyrus SASL, not dovecot.

I don't know any GUI hacks =) I spend more time in a shell than I do in GUI
land so I guess I'm different from others on the list. I learned on
Slackware which at the time and to a point still requires more use of a
shell than say Ubuntu or Potato Soup or whatever Debian is called these days
;-) I write plenty of little maintenance scripts here and there for things
dumping mysql databases and simple tar backups and the like.

Can you post the output from listing the folder?  For example:

foo={absolute path to ~/Desktop on Jaunty folder}
ls -la $foo/App*

No, the ls command doesn't see the files with the X on them in Nautilus either.
Neither does mv. As far as I can tell they are completely invisible to any
terminal command.

However, in the process of installing Fedora 11 I installed the Xfce4 desktop
as well as the Gnome desktop that I normally use. Because of issues with Gnome
(abundantly documented here) I wanted something else that I could log into in
case Gnome blew up on me again. Xfce installed Thunar file manager. And root
was able to launch Thunar. And Thunar as root was happy to drag and drop the
obstreperous files. 

I'd still like to know WTH is going on with the terminal window. The files
really are there. I am not making this up.

Have you tried running an ls -a command in the affected directory as root?
If running the command as root reveals the hidden files, it is possible that
the directory containing the two troublesome files doesn't have read
permissions set for non-group members. If that is the case, running chmod
o+r <yourHomeDir>/Desktop as root should fix the problem. Alternatively, you
could either change the group membership of the folder in question (with the
-R option enabled if you want to apply group membership changes recursively)
or add yourself to the group the folder is a member of. If you choose the
last option, you'll need to logout and login for your permissions to become
effective.

Hope this helps.

I became root with su. The ls command as root failed to see any of the files
that Nautilus showed with an X on them. That includes ls -a, or any other ls
option. 

Because the files in question had spaces in them I tried typing them with the
tab auto-completion. But the tab auto-completed only the one file that didn't
have the X on it in Nautilus.

The mv and cp commands also failed to see the files. 

There were not just two files. I mentioned two just as examples. My old ~/
folder had 38 GB of data in it, comprised of many thousands of files. Nautilus
displayed about one in 15 with an X on it, and in each and every case, the X
files were invisible to the terminal. The logic behind which files had an X on
them in Nautilus completely escapes me. In the three files I cited as examples,
all three were PDFs downloaded from Portland State by me (the old Jaunty me,
that is). According to Nautilus the Properties tab showed the permissions as
identical for all three files. WTH?

I'm beginning to wonder if I have stumbled into a bug in Nautilus. Wait ...
it's not just Nautilus, but the command line as well. Maybe the filesystem? But
the filesystem is ext3. A bug in ext4 would be credible, but not ext3.

I know a lot of people use a separate partition for ~/, but I have never seen
the logic of that for a laptop. I have just one disk. If the disk crashes I
lose everything anyway. And I'm not ordinarily into installing new distros
alongside my main distro. If I wanted to do that I'd use Virtualbox.

That does remind me that it's about time to do a full system backup, now that
my migration to Fedora is pretty much finished.

Subject: [PLUG] QXGA T60 looks fantastic
Message-ID: <20091214031632.GB796@gate.kl-ic.com>

I finally got time to put the 15 inch QXGA (2048x1536) screen
in the T60.  I wussed out and used the original WinXP with the
$30 Powerstrip program to write the new EDID to the display.
I couldn't find enough documentation on the Linux i2c-tools
to feel comfortable with risking a display on them.  Maybe on
the next machine.

The windoze drive is safely in storage, and a 500GB Linux
drive is in the machine, working fine.  I am typing this email
on it.  The characters look like they are out of a high
resolution laser printer.  Now to copy all the files from
my old T30, and build another T60 QXGA machine for my wife.

BTW, I name my machines after Nobel Prize winning physicists.
This one is named "kao", after Charles Kuen Kao, 2009 winner 
"for groundbreaking achievements concerning the transmission
of light in fibers for optical communication".

The whole package cost approximately $750, with a used T60 from
Ebay, A 500GB Seagate SATA drive (plus a spare) from Frys,  and
a new IdTech IAQX10N panel from BIGeSTOCK.com .  An Ultrabay 2nd
hard drive tray is slowly making its way from Hong Kong, apparently
by sampan.  

Now to order more AC adapters, and a couple of port extenders.

According to the GNOME Nautilus user manual (
http://library.gnome.org/users/user-guide/stable/gosnautilus-550.html.en), a
red x by a file means that the user that owns the nautilus process doesn't
have read permissions to the file.

So having said that, this could indicate either a bug in GNOME Nautilus or
an unclean filesystem. Have you run fsck.ext3 on the affected filesystem (be
sure to specify the force check option...I think it is "-f")?

It's not a red X, it's a white X. Also, I told Nautilus to use List View
always. (I know how to read; icons are not necessary.) There is a small
icon next to the text entry, and that icon is what has the white X on it.

I can't find anything in the documentation to explain a white X, but if you
right-click on the file, and then on Properties > Emblems, a white X appears to
mean unreadable.

"Unreadable" suggests you may be right - a file system corruption. Heaven
knows, the Jaunty disk has been popped in and out of the Ultrabay a lot in the
past couple of weeks. So I unmounted it and ran fsck -f -v on it.
(Un)fortunately, there were no errors:

A corrupted filesystem would certainly explain the random invisible files. I
wonder if there is something stronger than fsck -f. But having said that,
Thunar had no problem with the "invisible" files. I wonder if I can install a
different terminal.

I'd go off to see if I can find a Gnome/Nautilus bugtracker, except that I get
the same strange results from the command line (gnome-terminal).

The more I investigate this the more haywire it seems.

I forgot the punchline - if others also want to build a QXGA laptop,
contact me.  We can build a few at the January Linux clinic, or even
this month's clinic on the 20th if you order the parts quickly.  You
will need a 15 inch standard screen Thinkpad T60 (ebay?) and an
IAQX10N screen (try bigestock.com).

The upgrade will not work with a 14.1 or 15.4 inch display.

If the Thinkpad has a 1600x1200 or a 1400x1050 15 inch display, then
you probably have the proper backlight inverter board.  If it has a
1024x768 15 inch display, you will need to get a 42T0076 or a 42T0079
inverter board.  These are about $10 used on ebay, or $40 new from
acsparts.com .

OK, I installed a different terminal. And it sees all three of the example
files I posted earlier, using the ls command or any other command. As root it
also allows me to copy them to wherever I want.

It shows the permissions for the two offending files as -rw------- and for the
one that Nautilus lets me copy as -rw-r--r--. The Nautilus Properties dialog
box shows no differences for the permissions, but it is a GUI that does not
display all possible information. If gnome-terminal would display the offending
files it probably would have shown the differing permissions as well.

I am not sure if gnome-terminal's failing to display the files is by design
or on accident. Either way, it is wrong. If the file is there it should list it.

Did you check the permissions of the ~/Desktop folder? That might help
explain some eccentric behavior.

BTW, in the offending terminal program, what output do the `alias'  and
`wheris ls' commands give? It's a long shot, but your ls command might be
getting aliased in such a way that it doesn't perform correctly under normal
usage circumstances.

I tried to order two of them thinking I can link them
together between the two buildings with WEP turned on.  
Well, turns out that invictuswireless.com can't fill 
my order.  I asked how long the delay might be and if 
the shipping charges can be reduced since it will take 
longer to get it to me.  I missed the phone call 
unfortunately, but I got an email message.

I found a crude trick to keep the RealTek wifi card 
associated with my WAP11.  I run a script every ten 
minutes to detect if the link is down by trying to 
ping the router in the next building and in the event 
there is no link, I restart the wireless card.  
Surprisingly, this works.  Thing is, the link is the 
weakest most useless wireless link I have ever worked 
with.  It usually says link quality is 96/100, but I
seriously doubt it ever is.

The ground frozen hard, I'd hate to try and dig a trench
right now.  Thing is, if I can't pick up outdoor rated
high quality wireless access points I might have to 
consider a plan B.

Maybe on Monday I'll have some more information about my
order and more options to consider.

Subject: [PLUG] Ethernet suddenly died
Message-ID: <20091214021757.fea69eb0.johnxj@comcast.net>

I was searching on eBay in Fedora 11, and suddenly the ethernet stopped
working on my laptop. Meantime, the desktop computer continued to
stream Radio Clasique from Paris, so it was not the fault of Comcast.
All lights are blinking except the ethernet port on the laptop and the
other end of the cable on the switch. Those lights are lit up, but not
blinking. I have reseated and even changed all the cables, but still no
connection.

On the Gnome panel the network icon has a red x on it. If I click on it
everything is grayed out.

>From the command line ifconfig -a shows the ethernet. But "ifconfig
eth0 up" does nothing.

I have rebooted three times and ethernet is always off when I log in.

>From the command line dhclient executes without error, but accomplishes
nothing. Also, sudo "NetworkManager restart" executes without error,
but there is no change.

Looking at /var/og/messages shows about 30 pages of mesages during
thelast boot. There is a block of half a dozen messages starting with
NetworkManager every so often. Sometimes it appears it is turning the
device off, but then it appears to be connecting, then off again, and
so on. The mesages are written in Geek, so I could not understand them.
For example, the following is typical:

NetworklManager WARN nmsignal_handler() Caught signal 15, shutting down
normally NetworkManager <info> (eth0) now unmanaged
NetworkManager <info> (eth0) device state change 2 -> 1 (reason 36)
NetworkManager <info> (eth0) cleaning up ...
NetworkManager <info> (eth0) taking down device

The next group of messages leads one to think that eth0 is functioning
normally. It would be really helpful to the end user if device states 1
and 2 were defined, not to mention reason 36. There are lots of other
device state changes and reasons in other groups of messages regarding
netowrking, all use vague numbers so you have no idea what they mean.

Here I was thinking Fedora may be a keeper. I can handle the odd bug,
but suddenly disabling eth0 is just not acceptable.

Never mind. Two flaky cables in a row. Problem fixed. Apologies to Fedora.

I wonder what the signal to noise ratio is which I think would affect the
signal quality and the cards ability to keep an association with the AP even
if the link quality is good. Why not invest in a cheap USB wifi adapter or a
cheap non realtek wireless PCI card? I've had very good luck with the
broadcom based Linksys gear as well as Atheros based stuff.

Do you have a laptop? Maybe try walking the length between the 2 buildings
with some type of wireless survery/wireless discovery software and figure
out why the disassociation is happening. If you don't have the facility to
do so, I can come out at some point in the near future and give it a shot.

Subject: [PLUG] Nautilus sees files, but cp does not

I am trying to tidy up my migration from Jaunty to Fedora 11. The Fedora
installation is on a brand new hard disk, and the Jaunty disk is in the
Ultrabay adapter for my Thinkpad, all nicely mounted.

For some reason Nautilus refuses to let me drag and drop certain files, yet
does allow others. For example, in my ~/Desktop/ folder on the Jaunty disk
are three PDF files:

App Ling Fall 08 Newsletter.pdf
App Ling Spring 07 Newsletter.pdf
App Ling Spring 09 Newsletter.pdf

Nautilus shows the first and last of these three files with a big fat X on
them, like they're owned by someone other than me, but the middle one is
fine.
Nautilus will let me drag and drop the middle one, but not the other two.

I have no idea why - all the files in my old home folder should have the
same ownership and permissions (the old Jaunty me). If Nautilus thinks the
owner of the files on the Jaunty disk is different it should refuse to let
me copy any of them, not just random ones.

I could change the ownerships and permissions on the Jaunty disk, but I
don't want to do that just in case I decide I want to put the disk back into
the computer and boot to Jaunty. Instead I thought I would just copy the
offending files as root, then chown them to the new Fedora me.

That's where things are weird. The cp command does not even see the files
that have the X on them. Using tab for the above three files displays only
the middle one, as though the others don't exist. And I'm doing it as root.
Man cp doesn't tell me anything useful.

I also discovered that I cannot run Nautilus as root. The command #nautilus
throws up a page of error messages and then quits.

I could use some enlightenment and suggestions.

To rewrite that in script form:

true && (
set -x
ls -la ~/Desktop
) >& output.txt

The advantage of putting the ls command in this script wrapper is that
the only thing the questioner has to post is the contents of the
output.txt file.  With the contents we can all verify that the command
was correctly entered.  That's what the 'set -x' does.  In addition,
we see its output along with any error messages.  That's what the
"(...) >&" construct does, grouping all the commands into a single
output stream.  The "true &&" is there so that the opening parenthesis
is more visible.  So with this wrapper we can view exactly what was
done and how, as there's always a chance that the command was
incorrectly typed (e.g. ls -1a)

It also provides us with a means to see if the questioner can follow
instructions.  If they can type in a few lines of a script and send us
the output file, then there is a good chance of successfully resolving
the issue.  If not, well, that's a different issue.

this is my favorite method of problem solving as well.  it's amazing

I just received word from Michael that the board he was referring to was 
actually the Open RB:

This is an open hardware design (the MikroTik is not). Sorry if I 
confused anyone.

I collect info on log running process usage to look for memory leaks
by using /proc/$pid/statm.

Here is a snippet of perl code that expect an array of process names
to look for and store the info in a rrd database.

foreach my $prog (@progs) {
	foreach my $prog_pid ( `ps -C $prog -o pid=`) {
	   if ( $prog_pid =~/(\d+)/ ) {
		my $file = "/proc/$1/statm";
		open(PROG_MEM, $file) if -r $file or next;
		while (<PROG_MEM> ) {
			if ( /(\d+)\s+(\d+)\s+(\d+)\s+(\d+)\s+\d+\s+(\d+)/  ) {
			  my $rrd="$prog.rrd";
			  create_rrd($rrd) if not -w $rrd;
			  RRDs::update("$rrd","N:$1:$2:$3:$4:$5");
			  my $err = RRDs::error;
		  	  die "Error updating rrd file($rrd): $err\n" if $err;
			}
		}
	   }
	}
}

I still think that it is a bug somewhere.

Last night when I temporarily lost my ethernet connection I rebooted. Just now
I tried the ls command again, and now it is showing all of the files as it is
supposed to. It shows all of them whether I am jjj or root. 

There must have been a gremlin somewhere yesterday. The disk must have been
mounted at least read, else Thunar would not have been able to copy the files. 

In each and every case of a file that did not appear with the ls command (or cp
or mv, or tab auto-completion) the permissions were -rw-------. All files that
appeared were -rw-r--r--.

I used the GUI to mount the drive. That is, on the Gnome desktop it appeared as
Places > 136 GB drive. I just clicked on it and Nautilus demanded root password
to mount it. I entered root password and then Nautilus displayed the contents.

After mounting it I tried to drag files to ~/, but some would not copy - always
the ones that had a white X on them, which I later discovered were -rw-------.
From past experience I knew that I cannot launch Nautilus as root; at least not
from the command line. But I also knew how to copy files with the cp command.
So I opened gnome-terminal, switched to root, and started with cd:

[jjj at Devil8 ~]# cd /media/afba6df9-befb-4643-a209-841c2476a989/home/jjj/Desktop/

Then I tried:

[jjj at Devil8 Desktop]# cp App\ Ling\ F (tab here to auto-complete because it's
a PDF with a long filename with lots of spaces)

And the tab failed to auto-complete. So I manually typed in the filename and
the destination ~/Desktop/<same filename>, but the cp command said there was no
such file. So then I did:

[jjj at Devil8 Desktop]# ls -la *.pdf

This command showed very PDF file in the folder except those that I later
discovered were -rw-------. The file I was trying to copy was one of the ones
that did not appear. Subsequently I tried to use mv, but got the same results.
In other words, the -rw------- files were invisible in the terminal. 

Then I tried a different terminal. In fact I installed a different terminal,
just for this occasion. I got the same results in the different terminal. In
retrospect I should have used Ctrl-Alt-F2 to leave X and then try it again, but
it did not occur to me at the time. But since I got the same results in two
different terminal emulators, at least we know the problem is not in
gnome-terminal.

The Nautilus window was still open, so I right-clicked on one of the files with
a white X on it, then Properties > Permissions, and ditto for one of the
files without a white X. Nautilus doesn't do a very thorough job of
displaying permissions, because I couldn't see any difference. Remember, I
couldn't see -rw------- from the command line because the files were not
appearing in the terminal.

At that point I had been shaking my head and uttering increasingly vile oaths
for too long, so I posted about the problem here.

While waiting for suggestions from the list it dawned on me (again from past
experience) that Thunar does launch as root from the command line. So I
launched Thunar, opened a separate window for the Jaunty disk, and was able to
copy all the -rw------- files by dragging and dropping. That gave me the
practical results that I wanted, so the rest is trying to figure out what went
wrong. 

Whatever was wrong was cured by rebooting and remounting the disk. Last night I
got:(1)

[jjj at Devil8 ~]# cd /media/afba6df9-befb-4643-a209-841c2476a989/home/jjj/Desktop/

(1) I had to emulate the above because rebooting wiped out the contents of the
terminal from last night. But I remember clear as a bell that no -r-------
files appeared and that the ls command showed exactly seven PDF files.

This morning I get:

I have no idea why, but at the moment my vote goes for a bug. Stuff like this
just shouldn't happen. I'd love to file a bug report, but against what? Plus, I
don't know how to reproduce it.

The 1000 1000 are the id numbers of the owner and group that the owns the
file.  Since it is a number, and not your name, "jjj", that will be a
problem.  You should do a "sudo chown jjj.jjj * "after you move them to your
home directory.

Files with spaces and other special characters can be a problem.  You might
try ls A*.pdf and then add characters after the A until you get it down to
the one file you want.

What channel is it running on? Are there others in your vicinity also on

Cool.  Google says it's an ARM9 Kendin KS8695 - I took Doug Hall's ARM
embedded class at PSU, and I've got some ARM stuff to hack on.
That one could be mighty interesting.

Ubiquiti gear is great, but the one thing they haven't worked out is
their supply chain.  You are often waiting on a boat from china or
somewhere.  There are a good half-dozen or so places that sell these
things and they tend to all run out at about the same time.  Invictus
had run out (someone ordered 100 of them) the day I placed my order.

Whatever Invictus tells you about the delay, it'll be a wild guess.
Ubiquiti's shipping forecasts have a history of slipping.  It's also
not really Invictus's fault, so frankly I wouldn't expect a discount
just because you are inconvenienced.

If you are in a gigantic hurry, you could trade money for time and
substitute a Ubiquiti Bullet (I just got a 2M-HP recently) and add a
panel (or other) antenna.  The Bullet doesn't come with a PoE injector
or adapter, so that would be extra.  Something like:

  http://www.invictuswireless.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=24-13P
  http://www.invictuswireless.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=POEK24
  http://www.invictuswireless.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=BulletM2HP

$79+$17.50+$30.95 for each end.  With that power, you could bridge
miles with line of sight.

Oh.  Looks like he's got the NanoStation2 Loco in stock.  Those would
probably work as well. The Loco version is 100mW instead of 400mW with
the regular NS2, but if there are no trees in the way, you should be
okay over a few hundred feet.  Cheaper too.

Well, I'm asking about the value=<CGI script invocation output>
syntax, substituting ReadReg(reg_param) for "deadbeef".

<sheepish> Ok, so I've been putting off firing up the ol' search
engine and digging back in to this issue. I've gotten on the ball and
have apache set up for fiddling around with it now. </sheepish>

Glen: Sorry old chap, I was asking about static HTML. I was working
with an embedded 8051 with zero extra RAM so it all had to come from a
fixed source in flash ROM. Thus the need to invoke a CGI script for
the initial text box value.

I'll get back with the answer I think I was asking when I know what it
is. I think.

yup.  for the past couple of years, flash has worked really poorly on
my 64bit machines (i got worse results with the native 64bit version
than the 32bit version, and in opera as well as firefox).  they're all
varying versions of ubuntu, but sometimes the audio just disappears
(well, it never starts, more like) or gets stuck in a
techno-music-like-stutter of a half second or so of the actual audio
stream.

most of the 'missing audio' problems are attributable to something
else having /dev/dsp open and not sharing, so i can often fix by
killing that process, killing the plugin/nspluginwrapper PID, and
reloading the page.

youtube is most likely to work well, every other site that uses more
than one flash widget (usually multiple banner ads) are most likely to
show problems.  though actually, my problem is most often the flash
player hanging (and freezing the entire browser, though the browser
recovers after i kill the plugin) entirely rather than video
continuing without audio in the middle of doing something.

it's gotten so i browse without plugins enabled most of the time.  sigh.

i just chalked it up to "flash on 64bit linux doesn't work well".
perhaps this isn't the case, but i've never found a good solution,
despite trying many workarounds as suggested in the ubuntu forums.

After some initial euphoria with the QXGA 2Kx1.5K T60 laptop
(two page 12 point text in OpenOffice looks wonderful!), I am
running into font problems, mostly browser related. 

Google gadgets are clipped.  Some flash content comes in Really

are tiny.  I imagine I will find fixes, but the original incentive 
(making cleaner looking, easier to read characters for old eyes)
is not happening the way I had hoped.

The pixels on this thing are 0.15mm.  Crazy small.  An iPhone is
0.16mm, and an 11.6 inch WXGA 1101 EeePC is 2.3mm.   

Yes, I can use a magnifier like kmag, or bring the machine up
in 1024x768 screen mode.  The  Ctrl+ "view larger" on firefox
does expand pictures, but some things ignore that.

Hopefully, in a week or two, I will find some fixes, probably some
hidden firefox configuration parameters.  Meanwhile, I can think
vengeful thoughts about all the young programmers writing unscalable
apps.  Someday, their young eyes will get old, they will no longer
be able to see their own apps, get fired, and live in the gutter :-/

under centos, there is a setting under the font preferences in details 
that lets you set the dpi.  maybe that will accomplish what you are 
looking for?

Perhaps you can play with the DPI setting by adding this to
~/.Xdefaults:

Xft*dpi: 92.0

I have noticed that fonts look different with different video
drivers. The fglrx friver makes fonts bigger than the radeon driver,
for example.

opera does a much better job than firefox of scaling the page,
graphics, layout, and plugins included, to any size.  firefox has been
catching up lately, but it's still no contest.  i use a monitor from
6' away every day and while i did ruin my eyesight doing it on a 14"
greenscreen in the 90's, my eyesight has not degraded in the past 8
years since i got a decently sized monitor (just 21"), picked a font
that is larger for all my apps (took some doing to get stuff like
menus in opera/firefox to use the bigger font, but i don't use all
that many apps, really), and found that opera scaled every damn thing
including flash videos when i make the page bigger.

anyway, while i am an evangelist for opera (disclosure, they used to
give me schwag since i ran a user group for them in austin, but it's
been a long time since that was true), it actually does perform far
better when you have a monitor that's got pixels too small or is too
far away from your face.  worth trying, methinks, before you ditch the
monitor.

For reasons I have not researched, but are certain to exist, RH family
distributions (eg, Fedora) assign uid/gid for new users starting at 500,
while Debian family distributions (eg Ubuntu) start at 1000.  My Karmic
uid/gid is 1000/1000, while my Fedora uid/gid is 500/500.  This adds a
hiccup when migrating from one family to the other and retaining files from
your home directory, or any files that you own anywhere.

As a point of (maybe) interest, OS X assigns the first new user to (uid/gid)
501/20, where 20 is group 'staff'.

That is very interesting. Indeed, all the files in ~/ on my Jaunty disk are
1000:1000, and everything in ~/ on my new Fedora disk are 500:500.

Not that it really matters. After getting all the data files from the Jaunty
disk to the Fedora disk I just did "chown -R jjj:jjj ~/*" and the copies are
now owned by the new me.

A more interesting question is why a few of the files on the Jaunty disk are
-rw-------, while most are -rw-r--r---. All the files in ~/ on the Jaunty disk
were placed there by me, not operating as root. For example, the three files
that I cited at the start of this thread are PDF files that I downloaded from
the web page for the Applied Linguistics Department at PSU over the course of a
couple of years. I am the one who downloaded them, not root. And there are many
more such files in ~/ on the Jaunty disk that are also -rw-------. Why?

I originally asked for 3 day shipping, but I talked on the phone
with Invictus and asked for normal shipping instead.  He agreed 
that that makes more sense given the delay.  I could have canceled 
the order, but he didn't know anything about ethernet over power 
line where I'm concerned about how EOPL affects the electrical 
wiring.  A point to point link using 2 Nano 2's should work 
beautifully.  If only I didn't have to wait 2-3 weeks for the 
shipment from China to come in...

The nice thing about going the wireless route is that I'll be able
to roam between the buildings and be on line if I want when the 
weather is nice.

Someone suggested I could buy a cheap USB wireless card, but this
route even though it is a bit expensive has a greater chance of
working.  Getting 2 Nano's, I don't have to worry about Linux
compatibility.

I will hopefully hear about the order again in 2 weeks, but if I
don't I don't.

Sadly, no.  That is used with the "font size" in picas to choose which
font set to render for many apps.  The browser and flash seem to ignore
all that, except for the menu bars.  When I get time, I will play a bit
with gnash and see if it handles the rendering better than flash.

Ah, yes.  This has bit me once or twice, but since I'm pretty much a
Fedora guy, I'd forgotten it.  Happily, you've gotten the problem
fixed.

Perhaps you used a different application to download those files?
Other than that, I have no idea.  In any event, having a file with
permissions of -rw------- doesn't mean that root downloaded the
file.  It just means that only the file owner can read or write it.  My
own preference for most files is to make them -rw-r-----.  Since there
are no other users on my system, who cares if my files aren't world
readable?  Closing off group permissions, as Jaunty seems to have done, 
just makes the files a bit more secure, is all.  Honestly, I wouldn't
worry about it.

I read the page. What does it have to do with the current situation?

Bear in mind that all three of the files that I cited as examples were
downloaded by me to my ~/Desktop/ folder from the same website using Firefox. I
fail to see what umask has to do with the fact that the permissions are
different for two of the three.

I have never used anything but Firefox in all the time I have used Linux. The
period was over a couple years, so there may have been different versions of
Firefox, however.

The weird part is that it is only about one file out of a dozen. A lot of them
are PDFs, but the PDFs include files that I created myself and files that I
downloaded, yet other PDFs (that I created with the same applications at the
same time) were -rw-r--r--. Just to show how illogical this is, two were .prn
files created within a half hour of each other from Adobe Reader on Windows
2000 running in Virtualbox. One was -rw------- and the other was -rw -r--r--.
WTH? What was Jaunty thinking?

Well, since root-Thunar copied the files to my new folder and chown happily
made the new Fedora-me the owner, the problem is resolved. All that remains is
curiosity about how this mess was created in the first place.

Good idea!

Indeed, opera scales page rendering /almost/ perfectly.  I've got it
scaled to 150%.  It seems to throws in some unwanted vertical space
in the flash on some web pages, but compared to what firefox 3.5.5
was doing, it isn't bad.  I also had to go into opera:config and 
increase a bunch of font sizes.  So it handles some stuff that
firefox does not.

Firefox handles google maps better (at least so far).  Right click
brings up a google maps menu in firefox, and brings up an opera
menu in opera.  Probably some config stuff to take care of there.

I haven't set up printers yet - firefox print rendering is sometimes
bad, I hope for better out of opera.  

Bottom line, I use both browsers, and learn which website works best
with each.  Thanks for the suggestion!

Keith

The umask in effect at the time of the file creation or download would affect the permissions.
That's why I pointed you to the page - so you would know there is something called a umask. 
See /etc/login.defs (or /etc/default/login.defs) to find out what your system sets.

Here is the response from Free Geek.

I should add that, as long as I am in the class, it can be scheduled for any
time the instructors and students wish. I am a Free Geek keyholder, so we don't
have to worry about whether Free Geek is open.

John,
Hello there! I am Free Geek's Education Coordinator and I am thrilled to 
hear that there is interest in the Bash class on the list as well as the 
fact that there are two people interested in instructing!

I would like to schedule a meeting with the people interested in 
instructing to talk about class logistics at Free Geek.

We are getting ready to offer a C class as well. Would anyone be 
interested in hearing more about that class?

Thank you for getting in touch!

Did you reach Sarah? It appears she has not been there for some time. I

Note this funding to support embedded projects:

http://elinux.org/CELF_Open_Project_Proposal_2010

The CELF Open Project Proposal is a process whereby members of the
public can submit to the CE Linux Forum ideas and proposals for projects
that they think should be worked on to enhance embedded Linux.
Each year, CELF spends money on contract work to improve Linux for use
in embedded systems. Some of the projects we have sponsored in the past
include Linux-tiny, DirectFB enhancements, smem, and Squashfs mainlining.
Usually, our process involves querying forum members about their desires
and building a project list from that. This year, we are opening up the
process and asking for your ideas and proposals as well.

I write a lot of scripts for various things and sometime integrate GTK/QT/Web 
interfaces with them.  

I really like the idea of doing an advanced topics on scripting.  I wonder if 
this would be an opportunity to work with some other groups like the Portland

I'm a current free geek tutor, and  I will see Laurel on Thursday when I
go in for my regular class so I can ask her what would be needed and
report back here.

I've worked for a number of years as both a Linux sysadmin and an adult
education tutor specializing in Linux/Open Source so I'm also happy to
help with/teach this class.

Paul, does it make sense for you to keep a list of people interested in the Adv Bash Class,
and then giving that list to Laurel instead of each of us emailing her individually?

Subject: [PLUG] cups problem, fixed
Message-ID: <20091215215225.GA9473@gate.kl-ic.com>

I'm slowly moving stuff over from my old laptop (running a RHEL5.0
equivalent) to the new pixilla one (running RHEL5.4 equiv.) .  I
copied over my /etc/cups directory, and was having problems with
the lpr family of tools:
  
-> lpq
-  lpq: Unable to connect to server

BTW, lpq connects through a few softlinks to /usr/bin/lpq.cups.  
This ain't your grampa's port 515, Bunky!

Without any error log messages anywhere that I could find.  Sigh.
It turns out that it is trying to connect to /var/run/cups/cups.sock
which the older machine did not use ( it only used localhost:631 ).

After much frobbing, wailing, and gnashing of teeth, the fix turned
out to be to add these lines to the file  /etc/cups/cups.conf :

- # Only listen for connections from the local machine.
- Listen localhost:631
- Listen /var/run/cups/cups.sock

All the above is for the record, so that others with this problem
can find a possible solution by googling,  and so the writers of
the cups code can find new ways to make life difficult.

Since we have some hardware hackers on the list.

I saw this article about the price difference between laptop and lawn tool lion 
batteries.  Which got me thinking, how difficult would it be to build a cheap 
garden tool battery into a laptop power cable.

I'm no a hardware hacker, but I would almost bet money that a lawnmower
battery is not going to be built to the same quality specs as that of a
laptop battery. For example, I suspect that a lawnmower battery doesn't
necessarily need to have the same strong voltage and ampre output regulation
that a laptop battery does (it is after all just powering a motor, right?)

There may be other differences between laptop and lawnmower batteries that
may not be immediately apparent. However, I have found one rule to be
true---especially when it comes to hardware: *you get what you pay for*.

If you're getting it for low power equipment, like laptops, netbooks,
or (heaven forbid!) SBCs, 12V and 5V regulators are cheap and easily
to use (http://tinyurl.com/yas4y33).  This is exactly what we're
planning to use in our delivery computers -- 5V regulators in the box
with a pigtail to the power source.

Preferred pigtail connectors: Anderson Power Poles
(http://www.powerwerx.com/anderson-powerpoles/).

If you're carrying a laptop bag, anyway, I don't see why this can't be
practical.  I like the whole idea of being able to swap out batteries
without shutting down, too.

It'd be nice to see the article.

A couple remarks off the top of my head:
* My laptop takes 19V, most power tool batteries are less than that.  Which
  means a DC-DC converter with 5-15% power loss.  Add to that the loss in
  the laptop's internal power supply.
* Hopefully you can find a good way to hook up to the battery w/o damaging
  the charging contacts.  Otherwise, you're buying/making a charger as well.

All that said, power-tool batteries can be a pretty good deal, especially
when you already have the tools and charger.

   Except, with computer hardware by the time you get it home it's obsolete
and the price has dropped 50%.

You can power a 19V device with 18V without worry.

I wish I had more to contribute on this subject. I am keenly interested in
others' comments though.

Some laptops have this capability built-in. It may not be within your budget
though.

I do this with my Dell Latitude D800 and I can play video games on battery
power all day long if I keep swapping.

Of course, if I'm in a full-screen game, I can't see the battery charge
indicator, but I can develop good habits or set a timer.

On a related topic, I have often been interested in investigating the
possibility of using some hack to switch my servers over to DC power
with DC UPSes.  I don't even know what hardware is out there for this,
but since this related topic came up, I thought I'd see if anyone else
has looked into it.

To illustrate the ridiculous waste most setups produce on typical
UPS configurations, we have:

    |
    | AC
    |
    V
--------------------------    DC (12V?)   -----------
| UPS                    |<-------------->| Battery |
| (rectifier & inverter) |                |         |
--------------------------                -----------
    |
    | AC (imperfect, non-sinusoidal, etc)
    |
    V
----------------------------
| Computer PSU             |
| (rectifier & converter?) |
----------------------------
   |           |
   | DC 5V     | DC 12V
   V           V
---------------------
| Mobo & Drives, etc|
---------------------


It sure seems like converting from AC to DC just once, before we even
get to the battery and computer, would be a good idea:


    |
    | AC
    |
    V
---------------    DC (12V?)   -----------
|  UPS        |<-------------->| Battery |
| (rectifier) |                |         |
---------------                -----------
    |
    | DC (12V?)
    |
    V
---------------------------
| Computer PSU            |
| (regulator & converter) |
---------------------------
   |           |
   | DC 5V     | DC 12V
   V           V
---------------------
| Mobo & Drives, etc|
---------------------


Google and others are achieving power savings in server environments
by eliminating excessive AC/DC conversions:
  http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2009/11/27/facebook-follows-google-to-data-center-savings/

But I'm not sure what hardware is out there for the Average Joe.  I
have run across one or two power supplies with built-in batteries in
the past, but I would wonder if that's the best way to go... might be
harder to replace those batteries without replacing the whole PSU and
there might be some nice gains in moving some of the heat source
(AC/DC conversion, battery charging) outside of your server cases.

In any case, has anyone researched this more than I have?

I can't say that I've researched this any more than you have, but the
tendency among the people I've met is to go all 12V, especially among
ham radio operators.  Most ham radio equipment operates off of 12V,
anyway, and you can get 12V power supplies for PCs
(http://www.mini-box.com/DC-DC).  It makes even more sense when you're
highly mobile, like [retired] RV dwellers.  If you look in the right
places, you can find just about anything you want in 12V form.

If you're really that concerned about saving power, just buy equipment
that doesn't need lots of power first.  Atom-based PCs use something
like 50W (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16856167032
at 12V), VIA systems are around 30W, and OMAP (http://beagleboard.org/
at 5V) systems are in the 5W range.  An obvious disadvantage is in
certain areas of performance, but I haven't met many gamers that worry
terribly about cutting power consumption. :)

As far as the UPS, goes, however, it's typical to just run a battery
charger to a battery and then run your equipment off the battery.
Depending on your level of expertise, you can create any variety of
control circuitry to make sure you're not charging the battery when
it's already full.

Nice.  This is a good start.  I suspected such items existed,
particularly for the PC-in-your-car crowd

Well, yes, I already do have a VIA processor for one server and I try
to find ways to keep my power consumption down otherwise, but it just
seems like cutting power supply waste is a good way to save without
compromising performance.

Yeah... I had high school electronics, but I remember very little.
I'm sure it wouldn't be /hard/ to rig something up like this, but I
don't know that I'd want to trust my servers to my lack of expertise.


Thanks for the tips,
tim

That seems to make sense, I imagine people will still need to sign up
again when we get the course going but a record of interest would be
useful.

I've created a wiki page here:
http://www.gatheringstorms.org/wiki/doku.php?id=bash_course

for people to sign up and express interest.

Its a wiki page so feel free to add links notes etc as you see fit.

I've thrown away two battery powered lawnmowers. Bought each one new, the
battery lasted until shortly after the one year warranty expired. A new battery
cost half the price of the lawnmower.

A lead-acid car battery with a laptop converter sounds like a much cheaper and
more reliable idea to me.

I didn't actually speak to her.  I normally leave her an email.   I didn't
realize she wasn't there, but communicating with her was haphazard at best
when she was.  I'll find out if they have another event coordinator, or
whether or not there is an events contact.

Subject: [PLUG] DSL Northwest support
Message-ID: <f72d4c6a0912161243l21085028xbfbd1e95f2289888@mail.gmail.com>

There have been occasional inquiries here about isp choices.  I
recently had problems connecting, and 'tho suspecting my modem, I
emailed dslnorthwest's support to ensure that they had no problems.
Their response:

Denis,

Thankfully we have not had any outages with our part of the network in
a very long time.

If you find you need to power-cycle your modem frequently in order to
get it to sync up to Qwest (solid DSL light) it is likely the modem is
failing.  If power-cycling the modem does not cause your modem to sync
(the DSL light only flashes) then there is likely an outage with
Qwest.

You may call Qwest at 800-247-7285 anytime to troubleshoot if it
appears to be a Qwest issue.  Otherwise, feel free to call us at
503-279-9375 during our office hours from Our 8:30am-8:00pm, M-F;
10:00am-3:00pm, Sat.

Regards,
David

Now maybe those here with more knowledge than I have would not need
the help they provided me, but I appreciated the usefulness and
completeness of their response.  It has been rare that I have needed
to contact their support, but when I have, this type of response is
typical.

I haven't run 64-bit in a long time, but I constantly have this
problem with Firefox, Chrome and Opera.  Firefox also has a problem
with the way spawned applications inherit *all* of Firefox's open file
descriptors, whether you need them or not.

     https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147659

This is why you might have to close, say, Okular or Acrobat, in order
to get access to your audio devices.

The flash audio-corruption thing bugs me continuously though.

>>> Yes. Exactly. Precisely. But what does _that_ look like? ?It's been

In my (limited) experience with CGI, the CGI part has all boiled down
to printing out valid html to some output stream.  Some of my initial
apps just did this sort of thing:

print("<html>\n");
....
print("</html>");

Obviously, there are macros to help with all that, and frameworks that
obviate the need for extensive use of macros everywhere... but, if
we're assuming no javascript, then any dynamic content needs to be
generated with the entire page, so:

print("<input type=\"text\" name=\"reg1\" value=\"" . getReg1Value() .
"\"><br/>");

(where '.' is string concatenation)

Whatever language you're using probably has an API for generating
input fields that should be used instead of pure printing, but from my
meager understanding, that's essentially what you need to do.

After writing that out, I have suspect I've interpreted your question
wrong though....  If you need to have the field update in response to
user activity without reloading the page, then you need some form of
javascript, or you *do* need to reload the page, inserting the updated
values (faking the AJAX part).  In the later case, you'd need to pass
the parameters necessary to determine the next state in via the user's
request that is generated based on whatever action they took... eg:
say the user clicks on a button to display register 2's content.  Then
you would need to provide that information either as part of the url
or as part of the payload (eg: in a POST request).  Via url, you could
just append a query parameter to the url, eg: "?regId=2" and then use
that variable in the cgi to generate the proper output, showing the
content of register 2 instead of 1.  (Once again, there are probably
APIs to help with this too, but they will be specific to your language
and framework choice.)

Anyway, I hope I'm not off the mark :)

You want to run a CGI on an 8051?  Cool!  I still can't believe what folks
do with those little buggers.

   A pointer here will help: I want to use my USB turntable to digitize
records. Audacity will do the job, and I want to be sure that the mixer is
set properly before I begin. What do I read to know what to turn on? I see
"LFE" but don't know what that means. Does the mic channel need to be on for
all sound input?

   The audacity tutorial tells me to set the mixer, but not how to set it for
recording.

Subject: [PLUG] Chmod question, before I mess things up
Message-ID: <20091216153156.1fd963e7@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I'm not terribly familiar with permissions, but after reading man chmod
and a couple web sites, I think I have figured how to do what I want.

The computer is a Thinkpad with Fedora 11 x86_64.

This computer has two users: jjj (me) and jxj (an alter ego for me
that I can log in as when I mess up my own login). I created them
both. Both jjj and jxj are members of the group jjj.

At the moment all files and folders in /home/jjj/ are owned by jjj:jjj.
The only files in /home/jxj/ are configuration files.

There is also a root account. And both jjj and jxj are members of the
sudoers group.

I wish jjj to have full read, write and execute permissions to every
file and folder in /home/jjj/. I wish jxj to have the same access to
the same files because, if I ever need to log in as jxj, it will be
because I need to fix something in jjj's account. Others need no access
at all (except for root, of course).

So I am planning to do:

# cd /home/jjj/
# chmod 644 *

I think that will make every file and folder in /home/jjj/ -rw-rw----. 

First, will that command accomplish what I want? 

Second, there are a handful of files that are executable; will that
command make those files no longer executable? 

Third, does what I intend to do make sense for a standalone desktop
computer in a house occupied by only one person? (Other than
connecting occasionally at places like PSU or Free Geek, the only
outside connection is through a router to Comcast cable.)

Actually, chmod 644 * will change the perms for all the files in 
/home/jjj to:
-rw-r--r--

I guess, in as much as it does what you want to do...
But why not just create a group, put both users in that group, and then 
set the file perms for the group level.

Yes, that's pretty much where my quest ended.

The answer to my original question, which Joe got in one, was You
Can't Do That (i.e. call a CGI script from within HTML directly for
the initial text box contents). Need at least javascript.

I don't know about want, but it's what the Silicon Labs eval board and
demo software had going on. Looked like it would work, if you don't
mind paying $$$$ for the full Keil compiler package. The folks I was
doing it for didn't have the dough so I wasted a month of my time for
nuttin'.

The WIZnet W7100 looks like the best of their old TCP/IP controller +
MAC + PHY with an 8051 along with 64K RAM and 64K flash thrown in for
good measure. If I had to do it again that's where I'd start. Or if I
really wanted another family of uC maybe the W5100 to offload the
TCP/IP stack and network goodies. Currently less than $7 / $5
respectively on their website (www.ewiznet.com).

Disclaimer: I haven't bought or used any of their stuff yet, but the
articles in Circuit Cellar look intriguing.

   Huh! I run Slackware and can use the RCA-plugged speakers or the USB
headset.

   How kewel! There are so many entry points (audacity, alsamixer, etc.) that
the most parsimonious search term skipped right past me. My IT (Innovative
Technologies) is on sale at Fred Meyers for $60; that's 2/3 the price of a
low-end ION. And it does come with a winduhs version of audacity which the
above page is a good indication it will work with linux.

Many thanks for the pointer, and there goes the weekend. :-)

Oh! I guess it needs to be 664 to be -rw-rw----.

That's a problem. 

At first I thought I could just figure out how to make the ls command
display only files with the x set. I haven't succeeded in figuring that
out yet, but I did do ls -l on the main ~/ folder. I discovered that my
files are a bigger mess than I thought. As a rough guess, about one in
ten files is set to be executable, including just ordinary data files.

There really are just half a dozen in my home folder that need to remain
executable - a few shell scripts, and binaries for things like XaraLX, Acroread,
and so on. Even if I got ls -l to display only the files that are
executable it would be a very long list because of all the files that
are set to be executable and shouldn't be. Nautilus informs me that ~/
contains over 60,000 files. If one out of ten is executable, that is a
lot of files to look through manually.

The group jjj already exists (created automatically by Fedora during
installation when I set myself up as user jjj). When I created jxj I
made him a member of jjj also. So setting the permissions for the group
jjj might make more sense.

But then I need to do something about umask. Because in the future when
jjj creates a file the permissions will be wrong.

It is difficult for people on the list to understand what a mess the
permissions on my files are without looking over my shoulder. The next
Clinic is only four days away. I am wondering if this might make a good
thing to get help with there. Maybe a mini-tutorial on permissions.

If you don't need the IT turntable after you convert your vinyl,

   Close, but no nicotine gum. Continued below ...

   No.

   Yes.

   Anything makes sense if it does what you want.

   Quick review. There are three categories of users: the file's owner, the
file's group, and everyone else. From left-to-right in the view when you do
a long file listing of a directory are three characters for the file's
owner, three characters for the file's group, and three characters for
'other'; that is, neither owning the file or belonging to the group that
does. You can have accounts as jjj and jxj, and have both belong to a base
group called 'users' (or whatever your distribution uses). No other user on
your system (at the keyboard or logging in remotely) will have access to any
files unless you explicitly provide that permission.

   For each class (owner (u), group (g), other (o)) there are three
permissions: read (r), write (w), and execute (x). Each class represents 1
byte (7 bits). So, read permission is worth 4 bits (50 cents), write
permission is worth 2 bits (yes, a quarter), and execute permission is worth
1 bit. These values are additive.

   You can express permissions in two ways: by character or by digit. If you
want to give the user and group both read and write permissions, and
everyone else read-only permission you add the appropriate bits. For the
user 4+2, for the group 4+2, for the world (other) 4. This means you
describe the permissions in chmod as 664.

   What you have above, 644, means the file's owner has read/write
priviledges, everyone else has read-only priviledges.

   To add execute permissions, add 1 to each value. For a shell script (or
other executable binary) you probably want default permissions of 755. That
is, the user can read/write/execute, group members can read/execute, and so
can other users.

   You're better off setting your security with firewall rules and
restrictions on ssh logins; permissions have a lot more protective value if
your laptop acted as a server and had a bunch of different users in
/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow who could log into it. As a rule of thumb, make
default permissions 664 for regular files and 755 for executables.

HTH,

Rich

It sounds painful. I'm not sure what would be more or less painful at 
this point. Reinstall or install Fedora in a virtual machine, diff your 
home dir listings, and then try to fix it up.

find is your friend:

   $ find . -type f -executable -maxdepth 1

and to chmod 660 on the whole bunch:

   $ chmod 664 $(find . -type f -executable -maxdepth 1)

   That's not necessary, Mike. It'll be easy enough to clean things up
manually, with the use of shell wildcards and simple scripting. :-) Two
lessons in one!

   BTW, I'll be at the clinic with my wife's Toshiba Satellite so I can learn
what libraries are missing so she can watch her DVD movies on either of the
installed movie players. (I'll let her chose the one she prefers; options
are good.)

   I've built and applied patches but am not a hacker so I've never modified
any. Out of the box has always been good enough for me.

I guess I'd just like to get a general understanding of the kernel, 
modules, variables, etc. Every once in a while I want to do something on 
my Debian box and
inevitably I have to  enable/disable something in the kernel or build a 
kernel with a module loaded. For instance, I want to disable IPv6 
support. Does any of this make sense?

I'm here at Roots now (545 weds), and the big room is available.
It is behind the double doors on the south wall of the main area,
behind the "NOT AN ENTRANCE, EMPLOYEES ONLY" sign.   I will return
at 630 or so with sign makings, and put up a PLUG sign.

I think ISPs are much like any other biz. Last year around this time I 
lived w. a friend. He attempted to transfer his Comcast service from 
Beaverton to S.E. PDX. It took weeks of intermittent service, phone 
calls, techs coming on site, equip swap out, cable repair to get finally 
get internet connectivity working reliably. You would think they're the 
most incompetent ISP in all the land.

Where I'm living now there's been a short-lived outage or two and some 
occasional slowness. Nothing that I wouldn't expect from any other ISP. 
We've had more troubles w. Linksys routers and wireless connectivity....

Sure does. The first step is to get the kernel source. Most binary
distros don't give you this by default. Many distros have their own
kernel patchsets which alter the kernel from its original form. I
suggest going to http://www.kernel.org/ and downloading a vanilla
kernel, at least as an initial exercise. Then run "make menuconfig"
and browse through the entire tree of configuration options.
Familiarity with this layout is a must if you want to build your own
kernel.

As root, run "lspci -v". The output of this command is crucial to
configuring the right settings for hard drive, video, ethernet, sound,
i2c sensors, etc.

Simplify the task by avoiding the need for an initrd image. To do
this, the kernel must have the ability to read the root filesystem
without loading any modules. This means you want to build hard drive
support into the kernel, as opposed to building it as a module. (In
menuconfig, hit "y" instead of "m".) If your root filesystem is on a
SCSI disk, this must also be built into the kernel. If using software
RAID, build it into the kernel as well. Same goes for LVM.

Audio, ethernet and video drivers do best as modules. There are
systems in place to find and load these modules; let them do their
thing.

Once you have built a kernel, subsequent kernel builds are much, much
easier because you always start with your previous config. If you are
performing a minor version upgrade, the config will not change at all.

Thanks Carlos. How to's are fine, but I was really hoping someone whose

Yes, I can see that now, and it does make sense to me. And thanks Rich,
for the explanation.

Finding the files that need to be executable remains a problem. Just to
show what a mess things are, here is a short excerpt from ls -la on my
main ~/ folder:

-rw-r--r--.  1 jjj jjj  11968 test_pdf_form.pdf
-rw-------.  1 jjj jjj  1552141 thinkpad_ultrabay.pdf
-rwx------.  1 jjj jjj  2240700 ubuntupocketguide-v1-1.pdf 
-rw-------.  1 jjj jjj  4822994 ultrabay_adapter_40y8746.pdf 
-rw-rw-r--.  1 jjj jjj 20839 Baker03.odt 
-rw-r--r--.  1 jjj jjj  70 VLC_radio_playlist 
drwx------.  4 jjj jjj  Website

I note that all my directories are executable. Perhaps there is a
reason for that. But there is a PDF that is executable. Why? There is
an OOo Writer file that is -rw-rw-r--, where most plain data files are
rw-r--r--. Why?

Every folder on my computer has a similar m?lange of permissions for
data files. 

Also, just now I created a test file with Gedit. It appears as:

-rw-rw-r-- 1 jjj jjj 5 Test.txt

So apparently jjj's umask in Fedora 11 is to create files that are
-rw-rw-r--. And apparently jjj's umask when he (I) used to use Ubuntu
was -rw-r--r--. I can change the permissions on the older files to
-rw-rw-r--, but what happens if the (now) me downloads a file instead
of creating it de novo? Will it be -rw-rw-r--? What happens when I do a
dist-upgrade to Fedora 12 - will it change my umask? I want
things consistent and predictable. Once I clean up the mess I don't
want to proceed to create a new mess.

I know. I don't live anywhere near Portland, therefore I can't help

John,

   None of the above should be executable. All you'll do with the .pdf files
is read them; they can be 444 without harm since no one can directly write
to them. The .odt file is an OpenOffice.org text file; also with the proper
permissions.

> drwx------.  4 jjj jjj  Website

> I note that all my directories are executable. Perhaps there is a
> reason for that. But there is a PDF that is executable. Why?

   'Cause you cannot cd to that directory unless it's both writable and
executable. I always forget the exact relationship, but either w or x lets
you cd into the directory, the other allows you to list the files in there.

> There is an OOo Writer file that is -rw-rw-r--, where most plain data
> files are rw-r--r--. Why?

   No particular reason. In the second case only the owner can write to the
file, but anyone can read it. It all depends on who you want to read and/or
write to that file.

> Every folder on my computer has a similar m?lange of permissions for

   Make all directories and executable files 755; other files 664.

   1.) Ignore all this unless you have nothing better to obsess over. You're
getting so wrapped up in insignificant details (at your level of use) that
you're missing the big picture.

   2.) Look at 'man umask' to see default perms on new files.

   3.) The permissions won't change or affect anything if you change
distributions.

   www.kernel.org has great information and a Google search on 'building
linux kernel' will surface many excellent tutorials and explanations with a
range of details.

I've been using Comcast cable since approximately 2000 and I don't
recall ever having an outage. Installation took an hour or so and "just
worked." About a year ago my modem died. After replacing it I had to
call tech support for them to flick a switch or something to recognize
it. The first person I talked to couldn't get it connected. I called
back half an hour later, and the second person I spoke to fixed it up
in a matter of minutes. Other than that minor issue, I have had
flawless service from them. 

I think getting a good ISP is pretty much a crap shoot. If it works,
count your blessings. If it doesn't, dump 'em.

It also doesn't *really* matter that they are, though.  If you should
try to run a pdf as a script, you'll just get some error, or nothing
at all. (shell vs. a double-click in some file browser.

An earlier post eluded to this, but I don't think it's been spelled
out:  To make a your file read/write by any member of the jjj group,
use:

  $ chmod g+rw somefile

That will not *remove* permissions, it will just add the bits
necessary to give groups (g) read (r) and write (w) permissions.  For
directories, use:

   $ chmod g+rwx somedir

because you will want directories to be searchable too (the
"executable" (x) bit makes directories useful -- you almost always
want it if the directory is also writable.).

You can apply those commands to everything in your home directory with:

$ find ~ -type f | xargs chmod g+rw

and

$ find ~ -type d | xargs chmod g+rwx

Disclaimer:

It's always *possible* to mess something up royally, especially when
using find and some other command.  I think that's pretty unlikely,
and you seem to have backups of everything you ever do, so this can be
fixed by analyzing those :).  I would suggest trying these commands
out on a sample directory tree, to make sure they do solve your
problem.

You will also still need to set your umask so future files are created
as you wish.

I am not an expert, but something I have found handy as a starting point 
is /proc/config.gz.
If you have a running kernel that you want to modify AND
If it was compiled with a few flags enabled...
CONFIG_PROC_FS=y
CONFIG_IKCONFIG=y
CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC=y
Your kernel will produce a proc pseudo filesystem where there will be a 
/proc/config.gz file.
This is a compressed record of the configuration that the kernel was 
compiled with.

zcat /proc/config.gz > somefile
will get you a copy of the configuration in somefile.
If you zcat /proc/config.gz > .config
in the /usr/src/linux directory, the .config file will be in the right 
location for "make menuconfig" or "make xconfig". I prefer xconfig. You 
can also examine and edit the .config file with your favorite editor.

I recommend this as a good place to start and can save a beginner many 
attempts to get everything needed to boot and run. You can then 
experiment and change a few things at a time. Kind of like wading in 
from the shallow end.

Be sure to mention you think fiber-to-the-premises is essential and
you are tired of paying perpetual rent, which public ownership of last
mile can rectify.

The survey ends soon, so respond now.

   Here's a script John can use to explore his home directory (as well as
others). It is from chapter 5 of the ORA book on the bash shell. I call it
'showme.sh'. RUn it by making it executable ('chmod a+x') and specifying all
files in the directory. For example, ./showme.sh *

------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

finfo ()
{
     if [ ! -e "$1" ]; then
         print "file $1 does not exist."
         exit 1
     fi
     if [ -d "$1" ]; then
         echo -n "$1 is a directory that you may "
         if [ ! -x "$1" ]; then
             echo -n-n "not "
         fi
         echo "search."
     elif [ -f "$1" ]; then
         echo "$1 is a regular file."
     else
         echo "$1 is a special type of file."
     fi
     if [ -O "$1" ]; then
         echo 'You own the file.'
     else
         echo 'You do not own the file.'
     fi
     if [ -r "$1" ]; then
         echo 'You have read permissions on the file.'
     fi
     if [ -w "$1" ]; then
         echo 'You have write permissions on the file.'
     fi
     if [ -x "$1" ]; then
         echo 'You have execute permissions on this file.'
     fi
}

for filename in "$@" ; do
     finfo "$filename"
     echo
done
--------------------------------------------------------------

   Two lessons in one: permissions and shell scripting.

John (et. al.),

Another piece of random noise about finding out stuff.   The 'file' command
will tell you sort of thing a file is.  Executables and shell scripts
should generate a message that contains 'executable', even if it does not
have executable permission set (at least on my Debian based system; I should
expect RH based systems to do the same).  Binaries will have 'ELF' in the
message, for current  distributions.  Scripts will have 'script' in the
message, and usually something indicating the language (perl, python, bash,
etc.).  Attached is a result of applying 'file' to a slice of /usr/bin.  I
can write a script to use it to identify executables and modify the
permissions accordingly, but that exercise seems appropriate as
homework/research 'left to the reader'.

Thanks for pointing this out, Russell. Having seen positive outcomes
from MHCRC advocacy in action at $DAYJOB, I can't stress how important
this is.

Please take the time to do this.

You really want to use the kernel source from your distro and not the
generic source. Each distro makes changes to their kernels that may or may
not be needed by userspace tools.

BTW, you do not need to recompile the kernel to disable ipv6.

In /etc/modules.d/aliases make the following additions/changes:

 alias ipv6 off
 alias net-pf-10 off

Once you reboot, ipv6 will no longer load.

Does this cover other areas outside of what is listed like Hillsboro
and Beaverton?
All points west instead of east.

   It's the Mt. Hood Cable Regulatory Commission who is having the survey
run. I don't remember the cities listed, but I think the most western is
Portland.

This is exactly what I tried to do however, the "alias net-pf-10 off" statement is not in 
my /etc/modules.d/aliases file. The post I read referenced another aliases file, maybe 
aliases.conf ?, which I don't have on my system. So do I just add the "alias net-pf-10 off"
statement to my /etc/modules.d/aliases file?

I presume MHCRC mainly wants to hear from constituents, i.e. residents
of "Multnomah County and the Cities of Fairview, Gresham, Portland,
Troutdale and Wood Village":
http://www.mhcrc.org/content.asp?n=about&s=about_mission

The survey does ask the locale of your residence and workplace, so I
assume they can filter responses appropriately regardless. Sorry I was
unclear about the purpose of the survey before.

The cable regulator for "points west" appears to be MACC:

Yeah, their jurisdiction is limited to Multnomah County:

  The Mt. Hood Cable Regulatory Commission negotiates and enforces
  cable service franchise agreements; manages the public benefit
  resources and assets derived from the franchises; and advocates on
  behalf of the public interest on communications policy issues at
  local, state and federal levels.

  The MHCRC serves the communities, residents and local governments of
  Fairview, Gresham, Portland, Troutdale and Wood Village and
  Multnomah County, Oregon (its member "Jurisdictions").

FWIW, my Karmic system doesn't have either. Neither does LinuxMint. sidux
uses 'alias.conf', while lenny, mepis  and Hardy use 'aliases' (which looks
almost exactly like the sidux aliases.conf).

Again, FWIW, the manpage for modprobe.conf (man 5 modprobe.conf) indicates
that 'aliases.conf' is the one to use.

Note that the manpage for modprobe.d is supposed to be the same as for
modprobe.conf.  It's implemented as a link in /usr/share/man/man5, but the
link may be dangling on some Debian systems, due to someone's indecision
about whether man pages are assumed to be .gz files or not.

   On Slackware it's noted that /etc/modprobe.conf has been deprecated and
/etc/modprobe.d/.

   /etc/modprobe.comf reads:

# /etc/modprobe.conf (old location for Linux 2.6+ config)
#
# The use of this config file is deprecated. 
# Instead, create files in the /etc/modprobe.d/ directory 
# containing modprobe options.
#
# For more information, see "man modprobe.conf".

   I assume this holds for all distributions.

Bring your laptop or your CPU, we will have displays, keyboards,

If you bring a windows machine, we can exchange it for a lump

If you haven't taken the survey yet - get going.  It ends soon.
As surveys go this one is pretty well put together and asks minimal 
demographic questions.

I was especially pleased by the ability to back up at any time and 
update or modify answers given on a previous page.  It worked great.

Keith's formal announcement reminded me that I needed to update the
distros that I have on my USB drive. I have every Ubuntu imaginable,
but needed the Karmic versions. I also discovered that the latest
OpenSuse that I have is 11.0, so I'm getting 11.1 and 11.2. I'm also
adding Fedora 11 and 12. And I need to get the latest Mint and
Slackwares, just in case someone wants them. I'll add the Debian
netinst CDs as well.

It is my policy to make sure I have all the variants for each distro
release - 32- and 64-bit; Gnome, KDE and other desktops that the distro
offers, CD and DVD versions, and cutdown versions like Xubuntu.

If anyone needs a distro and has poor bandwidth at home, come on down
and I'll burn it for you. It takes only five minutes to burn a CD on my
computer. And if you want a distro that is not on my regular list, just
holler and I'll download it for you. I get up to 3MB/s at home, so it
doesn't take me long.

I'll bring a Sidux cd and my Thinkpad T60 running Sidux and KDE 4.3 for 
demo purposes. I switched to Sidux because Ubuntu was sluggish, the 
video driver would go haywire, and Debian stable was just too far behind 
for personal desktop use.

I'm pretty happy w. it. I even got Nepomuk (Social Semantic Desktop) and 
some "Plazmoids" running.  However, the majority of them don't work and 
I can't seem to get Google gadgets working...

I want the cell phone jammer. I want it installed in my car. When the
idiot ahead of me won't hang up and drive, I just push a button.

OK, below is a "ls -Rla > list.txt" of the USB Drive (edited).

If I didn't include a distro that you would like a copy of, let me
know. The USB drive still has 35 GB free.

Notes:
GRML is one of my favorite rescue CDs. It is text-only, Debian based.
It auto-mounts all partitions that it finds, loads all the tools you
need like fsck and e2fsck, and even mdadm, and drops you to a root
command line. 
I also like Slax for a rescue CD; leaner than Knoppix.
I didn't include Knoppix 6.2 because apparently it now comes on two CDs.
I didn't include later versions of PCLinuxOS because apparently they
think 64-bit Linux is not ready for serious work. Bah.
Ubuntu: I kept all old versions in case someone needs to do a
dist-upgrade from one to the next. 
Apparently there is no 64-bit netbook remix of 9.10. I also couldn't
find 9.10 Xubuntu, Kubunu, or Edbuntu.

I was trying to imagine some fun things I could do with an old 10GB Ipod
classic that has been sitting around my place gathering dust so instead of
taking the ipodlinux route I decided to try something different and believe
it or not this old Ipod is now functioning as a USB based boot device for
Knoppix live (not an OS install).  So now I have an arsenal of ways to
impress my unsuspecting family members over the holidays.

Here is what I did.

First mounted the device (varies according to every system, which USB port
etc).  In my case the Ipod mounted as /dev/sdb1 -> /media/usb0.  So I umount
the device and then fdisk:

fdisk /dev/sdb
p
d 1
n
p
1
<series of enters>
t
6 (FAT 16)
a
1
p (make sure it looks right)
w

then mkfs on the device

mkfs -t ext2 /dev/sdb1

now mount the device

mount /dev/sdb1 /media/usb0

I tried for days to create a chroot usb boot OS using syslinux and grub and
because the systems the device was connecting to varied so much, I was
finally forced to dig up a tool that does all the work for you and I must
say it is a pretty decent app called "UNetbootin" at
http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/.

Once you download the Linux binary, locate the file where you downloaded it
do and make it executable (chmod 700 unetbootin-linux-377) and then start
the app and you should get a minimal gui that allows you to choose what
build to install and to what device.  There are a couple of dependencies for
this application to work (mtools and p7zip-full).  Download the most recent
Knoppix .iso and then point the iso location in the app to the Knoppix .iso
recently downloaded.

Now simply connect up the Ipod to USB, reboot your system and choose to boot
from USB and wait for your friends to cheer you on with golf style applause.

How does Gentoo Livecd compare to Sabayon? Sabayon's claim to fame is 
that it will "transform a computer into a powerful Gentoo Linux system 
in less than 5 minutes." I eventually got it to run on my Thinkpad T60, 
but it was pretty sluggish and spontaneously lock up.

Message-ID: <4B2BFF45.9090700@gmail.com>

I manually copy a resolv.bak file to resolv.conf to overwrite Comcast's 
DNS servers and their bulls*&! domain search crap. However, it would be 
great to automate this.

Any recommendations on where to put a script and how to initiate it? 
Could I just make it part of my run level 3 scripts? Sigh, my ignorance, 
it is profound...

   When I travel and use a hotel or coffee shop connection /etc/resolv.conf
is re-written to their specs ... automaticlaly. I keep a backup copy of the
default file, /etc/resolv.conf.office, and just copy that to
/etc/resolv.conf when I return. You can put that in /etc/rc.d/rc.local, or
write a shell script that does the copy and run it manually as desired.

The "right" way is to have your own subnet, complete with its own DNS
and DHCP services. resolv.conf is written by the DHCP client, using
DNS data that is supplied from the lease.

Get onto your router and see if there is a way to tell it which search
domain and DNS server IP(s) to hand out when it creats DHCP leases.

Yes, I've tried this but with the Linksys router I can only add 3 static 
DNS entries and I don't see a way to stop/change Comcast's search domain 
auto population.

Maybe I could get more control of DNS info with OpenWRT?

When I connect to other networks I'd still like to use my own list of 
DNS servers. So, I still want to automate the resolv.conf overwrite.

Thanks Rich. Putting "cp /etc/resolv.bak /etc/resolv.conf" in 
/etc/rc.local did the trick!

Once upon a time, I configured dhclient.conf on a debian box to ignore
the domain-name-servers provided by the dhcp server.  Unfortunately,
the box is unreachable at the moment so I can't tell you exactly how I
did it.  Reading the manpage for dhclient.conf or googling on that
might help.

Yeah, I thought this was the answer too.  I think you're referring to 
this stanza in dhclient.conf?

request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,
        host-name, netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope, interface-mtu,
        rfc3442-classless-static-routes, ntp-servers;

However, much to my chagrin I still got Comcast's DNS info. Granted, I 
didn't specify static DNS entries in the Linksys config. So maybe the 
Linksys just referred to the DNS info in the cable modem and ignored the 
dhcp client request info?

I think you're on the right track here. I found this info:

http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using.html

which suggests adding a prepend domain-name-servers line to your 
dhclient.conf with your desired DNS servers.

He's got Mint, but I might be curious about Scientific Linux, too.

And no Mandriva?  That's what I use and I find it better than Ubuntu.
It's available at kernel.org and 2008.1 through 2010.0 are all great.

I've never tried Gentoo or Sabayon, other than running a live CD for
half an hour to poke around. And I'm sure it was a long time ago.

Mint is there, although only version 8. Keith is the only one I know of
who uses Scientific Linux, but if y'all want it at the Clinic, I'll go
get it.

Ah, Mandriva. 

It has been documented here more than once that I have a personal issue
with the Mandriva organization. I'd sooner do business with Bill Gates.

I have no objections if people like Mandriva and use it. Just include
me out.

Holy ISOs, batfolk. The 32-bit version of Scientific Linux is 5.0 GB and
the 64-bit version is 5.2 GB.

Well, at least their server seems to have plenty of bandwidth, so I'll
go get them.

   It's all the technical jargon. You know, all the big words to obfuscate

I installed SL with three CDs.  I saw the 5GB version, too, but when I was
studying up on the installation I found something that said you only need
the first three of seven CD isos.  It may even have even been somewhere on
the SL site.

Coincidentally, this issue came up at ptp nodes today.  Someone was
ignoring our DNS configuration and they weren't able to resolve any
hostnames and even get to the splash page of our captive portal.  So,
ignoring DHCP supplied DNS *might* be shooting yourself in the foot in
some circumstances.  My initial thought was to just intercept all port
53 traffic and direct it to our nameserver.  That could either
transparently solve the problem or potentially create other ones.
Something like (untested):

  iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to 10.11.x.x:53

For my purposes, overwriting resolv.conf in rc.local is the best 
solution and it shouldn't hamstring me as the DNS changes occur after 
network configuration has occurred. I'll test it on a PTP node this 
weekend to confirm.

I would expect that most captive portals do something like this.

I think there's more to understand about how all this works. Because 
when I configured my conf file not to request DNS info in DHCP 
communications to my Linksys router, I still got DNS info from the 
Comcast modem upstream. I'm going to create static DNS entries on my 
Linksys and then make changes to the dhclient.conf request stanza and 
see what I can figure out...

I haven't been to a clinic in a while, but the last time I was there I
helped someone with a netbook.  They were installing EasyPeasy.  I
have used EeeBuntu on my ASUS EEE 701.  There are a few other netbook
focused distributions around as well, but I don't recall their names.
Mr Google will know.

I have gotten around this by changing the DNS server on the router to use
openDNS.

When you are using some other DHCP you can append or prepend stuff to
this and still use their local (possibly caching) dns servers.

Depending on which distro you have, it will be something like
/etc/dhcpc.conf or /etc/dhclient.conf
or on my centos 5 box /etc/dhclient-eth0.conf using
append domain-name " domain1.com domain2.com ";

The spaces are important.

Coincidentally, I was just reading about OpenDNS and then I decided to 
just install djbdns and dnscache-run. I was frustrated w. Comcast's DNS 
and was pointing at U of O's and Verizon's (4.2.2.1, 4.2.2.1) DNS.

But now, after using dnscache, I think my DNS troubles are over. It's 
impressive how responsive web surfing is right now!  I always suspected 
that DNS played a role in sometimes sluggish and intermittent internet 
connection. Audio & video streaming without any buffering right now... :-)

Another simple option is "chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf" which will stop
the dhcp client or any anything else from changing that file till you
chattr -i it.

We recently purchased a MacPro notebook. I have most of my music and

/share1 and /share2. I have both of these in /etc/exports, and nfsd is 
running. However, I am unable to mount_nfs them from the Mac. I very 
likely could have something incorrect with my exports file. I think I 
also have to tweak my Belkin router. Interesting that my network printer 
was found effortlessly by the Mac, and sees it as psc2500 at debian.Belkin. 
I could use some pointers.

192.168.1.0/24 network as well.

Let me try and draw a crude diagram of what is going on...

dodo and condor are part of goose as they get their root file

BIG NOTE IS THAT GOOSE HAS 3 NAMES ;-)

Please note that dodo   is on $ network, boots via goose (192.168.4.2)
or gw2-s1.w2.robinson-west.pri.

=======================================================================

Can you see the problem from this diagram?  Question is, should I
renumber to get Bluejay to stop conflicting with the server on the other
network or should I go the double nat route?  

I'm thinking of using 192.168.5.0/28 on Dodo, NAT box 1, and on the
Minnesota side, NAT box 2 will need to use say 192.168.5.16/28.  So I
can map web to 192.168.5.2, goose to 192.168.5.3, and xerxes to
192.168.5.4.  On the Minnesota side 192.168.5.18 can be mapped to
192.168.1.35.  I am not currently source nat'ing on Dodo (except for the
route to goose) where I am concerned that it might screw things up.  I
want to route from Minnesota through either web or xerxes depending on
which one I am using at the moment.  So I source nat on dodo to either
192.168.3.17 or 192.168.3.1.  Let's say that the source from Minnesota
is 192.168.5.1.  The source from Scappoose going to Minnesota will be
say 192.168.5.17.  I'll have to check to see if I will be SNATing on the
Scappoose side from 3.x or 1.x.  The problem is, I have more routers
involved than the double nat HOWTO has.

Do you get an error mssg on the Mac when you attempt to mount the nfs 
share?

How about any nfs mssgs in syslog on the Debian box?

I found this write-up on easy GUI-based NFS share access from a Mac OSX 
client using Avahi / Zeroconf / Bonjour.

Most of the online materials I've found that discuss setting up an OSX 
client for NFS shares go through the cumbersome process of configuring 
via NetManager. The downside I discovered to this, particularly for 
iBooks, is that the Finder will rather ungracefully hang when I'm out 
somewhere else and it tries to access the shares defined for my local 
home LAN. Plus, the NetManager settings are essentially hard-coded in a 
way, so any time I make changes to my server setup, I have to replicate 
them in my iBook's NetManager configuration. How tedious.

I stumbled across a much more elegant setup a while back (incidentally, 
when researching how SMB broadcasts its presence) -- use Avahi / 
Zeroconf / Bonjour. Avahi is the Linux daemon; Zeroconf is the spec; and 
Bonjour is what Apple calls its implementation (formerly "Rendezvous"). 
Setting up Avahi on your Ubuntu NFS server to broadcast announce your 
NFS shares can greatly simplify GUI access from your Macs, and also 
potentially simplify how your /etc/exports file is organized. There are 
a couple useful links here in one of my previous posts which you should 
read.

Once you get Avahi installed and running on your Ubuntu server machine, 
open a terminal and cd over to /etc/avahi/services. There shouldn't be 
much of anything here to begin with, so start off by typing in sudo vim 
nfs.service (pick your editor of choice; I just like vim ). Any config 
files for announcing services via Avahi *must* be in this directory (or 
linked to from it) and *must* have the extension service. Now type in 
something like this:

Code:
<?xml version="1.0" standalone='no'?>
<!DOCTYPE service-group SYSTEM "avahi-service.dtd">
<service-group>
<name>Zephyrus Shared Music</name>
<service>
<type>_nfs._tcp</type>
<port>2049</port>
<txt-record>path=/data/shared/Music</txt-record>
</service>
</service-group>
The black text should be identical on your end; change the blue as 
needed to suit your own setup. Also note the underscores in the <type> 
tag -- these are required. The port is the NFS port used when you've got 
the [font=courier]insecure[font] option specified in your /etc/exports 
file, so that might need changing. And obviously you'll need to specify 
your own path to your NFS share. One caveat here is that, as best as I 
can figure, you can only specify one share per service file. The Avahi 
daemon for Linux is still a young project, and documentation is limited, 
but I expect better docs and software to help configure daemon options 
will appear in due time.

Once you've got your service files in place, restart the Avahi daemon by 
typing in sudo /etc/init.d/avahi-daemon restart. Then go to your Mac 
machine, open a Finder window, and click the Network globe thingy in the 
upper left. You should now have a "My Network" folder here, which will 
contain whatever NFS shares you've specified. And the nice thing is that 
this is a purely dynamic setup -- automount takes care of mounting 
automagically via the special Network folder, and the the Finder won't 
hang now when you go somewhere else and happen to accidentally try to 
access a non-existent share, unlike the NetManager setups I've often 
seen described online when researching how to do this.

I mentioned earlier that this can simplify your /etc/exports file 
somewhat. The trick here is the <path> tag. As you see further above, my 
exports file just shoves out the whole /data directory. Meanwhile, my 
Avahi service config file here only broadcasts one subdirectory, so 
that's all the GUI user will see (you can also see these via Konqueror 
by typing zeroconf:/ into the address bar). That's also all the GUI user 
can access.

But -- the whole /data share is still available for anyone to mount via 
the CLI, so be forewarned that this simplified /etc/exports file 
approach is not a good way to limit access to any sensitive data. You 
will need to spend some time setting up proper file permissions to 
ensure that no one who shouldn't can mess with your files. For instance, 
one of the subdirectories I advertise via Avahi is a user's documents 
folder, at /data/[username]'s Docs. Although anyone on my LAN can see 
this directory in any zeroconf-enabled browser (like Konq or the 
Finder), I've set up permissions so only certain users can actually open 
the directory to see the contents -- anyone else just gets an error that 
they don't have the required permissions. In this case, I did this by 
typing in sudo chmod 750 /path/to/directory. This way, the owner (the 
first digit) gets full read/write/execute permission, group members (the 
second digit) get read-only and execute (needed on a directory so you 
can open it), and anyone else (the last digit) can't do anything to it 
(except root, of course). Another useful trick for directories shared 
within a group is the setgid bit, which I've set on the above-shown 
Music folder by typing in sudo chmod 2770 /path/to/directory. The 2 on 
the front ensures that any files or directories created within this 
directory are created with the same group ID as the directory itself 
(after the 2 come the usual user, group, and other permissions). Note 
also that any binaries executed with the setgid bit set will run with 
the permissions of the file's group, so make sure to choose an 
unprivileged group when setting up your shared groups. Wikipedia has a 
very useful article on file system permissions, particularly the section 
Notation of traditional Unix permissions, which I'd recommend reading.

I don't understand your network nor the logic behind it. It seems to me 
that either you don't understand networking very well or
just love to design overly complicated networks for S&Gs. NAT was 
originally a hack to solve a very specific problem with the scarcity
of IPv4 address space. There are certainly some good reasons for using 
NAT such as:

- Internet load balancing
- Intranet server/workstation load balancing
- Firewall IP masquerading
- Port Forwarding
- Overlapping IP Address space with a VPN*

 From the info you provided, the last one seems to apply. A lot of time 
in commercial enviros your stuck w. the ip addr space and so you employ 
NAT has a hack. But I don't see any reason why you *have* to do this 
with your network.

If you have routers in your network why use different ip networks in the 
private addr space. You have the whole 10 network (10.0.0.0 to 
10.255.255.255) and also the 172.16. network (172.16.0.0 to 172.31.0.0).

It's your network so feel free to do whatever you want. But if you'd 
like other people to help / advise you, you should consider designing
your network simpler so that it can be easily grokked. If however, your 
goal is security by obscurity, carry on...

You understand something about it and this is a very rude comment.

The reason I have to consider double nat is that the person I want
to connect with is using the same RFC1918 network that I am using.
The alternative of course is to reprogram my end so it doesn't
overlap the other end, but that is a brutal solution that requires
me to go through multiple firewalls, dns servers, and check in 
other places.  The hope is that double nat is a reasonable solution 
that will be less error prone and easier to pursue than network
renumbering.

A more helpful comment than I don't understand anything is I
don't understand this or that.  Frankly, that is the truth.
If you couldn't tell from my diagram that the same ip network
is in use in 2 networks that are supposed to be connected
together, you are blind.  Granted, my diagram is crude because
it is trying to show a bit more information and like I said I
didn't explicity show all connections (but they are labeled).
The diagram is also crude because my information about the
other end is limited.

The reason NAT exists is the scarcity of address space and it
also exists to allow one to build isolated networks that have
some external connectivity to other networks.  Load balancing
is a routing issue, not a NAT issue as far as I can tell.
Having multiple Net connections and having to pick one is
most definitely a routing and not so much a NAT issue.

I don't try to create the most convoluted network designs I can
come up with thank you very much.  The reality is, I have a very
real world realistic set up.  Network root and growing a network 
complicate topology rather quickly.  I made a bad assumption up
front that I should use 192.168.1.0/24 for my network.  Network
root tends to create loops in networks.  What am I supposed to
do?  Am I supposed to add a dedicated server for network root
to avoid creating loops?  I have enough servers as it is.  One
of the reasons my network root servers are on a different network
is that I wanted them to be hidden from the Net (for the most
part).

It's quite simple, the remote site was using the 192.168.1.0/24 network
before I was, but I didn't realize this when I initially set up my
network.  At some point in time, I decided to add a second private
network in segments booted off of an existing server.  These are the
192.168.4.0/28 and 192.168.4.16/28 networks.  There are more segments,
but they aren't important to the problem at hand.  The only reason
I talked about those 2 segments is that the first segment provides
an alternate route to 192.168.1.0/24 that I don't want to use.  I
want to work everything through the routers on the original part
of the network.

Even if I were to go all out and try to use DIA to create a less crude
diagram of my network, I wouldn't be able to post it to this list.

Telling the other end, the Minnesota end, that they have to renumber to
fit into my private network so that no subnet boundaries have to be 
crossed is imposing a lot on them.  It generally doesn't work that way.

No, I have dhcp enabled on the Belkin router. All the clients, wireless 
or hard wired run dhcp. The network printer is the only exception. I am 
willing to change this.

Yes, my initial comments were rude and not helpful. I apologize for that.

But I've designed, implemented, and supported large networks with 
switching, routing, vlans, vpns, firewalls, and wan circuits they were 
never has hard to grok as yours.

Maybe it's the diagram. There's a lot of extraneous info in your diagram 
that makes digesting the info difficult. Physical boundaries, individual 
host names and ip addresses aren't all that useful. However, including 
the vpn link with network endpoints would be very useful. Providing 
which devices route traffic for which networks would be useful.

If I were diagramming this network I would do it from the view point of 
the network and not by the host or physical location because the 
interesting info is how traffic goes from 1 network to another network. 
Not where things are physically and what the physical connections are. 
Routing happens between networks, this is what you want to know.

You could always create a better diagram in Dia and send it as a file 
attachment. I don't think file attachments are banned on the PLUG list?

Here's what's not clear to me:
1. I only see 1 router (Netgear) and I don't know what it's route table 
looks like.
2. I'm not sure how all the servers see the network. Are they all just 
pointing at the Netgear via a default route?

My other 2 cents:
1. Troubleshooting network problems w. NAT or double NAT can be a real 
pain when trying to keep track of the NAT'd and local ip addr.
2. I'm going to attempt to diagram this network myself so that it makes 
more sense to me.

Okay, a couple of points:

1) The FVX 538 is implementing a parallel and independent way to 
   access the Internet through a shared DSL modem on a bridged 
   subnet.

2) Web, Goose, and Xerxes are gateway, mail server/proxy, gateway 
   respectively.  This is the original network's means of accessing
   the Net.

3) 216.151.30.105 is the gateway at the ISP, Opus.

4) 216.151.30.111 is the broadcast for the global subnet.

5) 216.151.30.104 is the network address for the global subnet.

6) 216.151.30.110 is currently not used.

7) The FVX 538 is connected to a 192.168.0.x class C subnet that
   serves one of the rooms in the house in Scappoose.  I want the
   original network to be able to instant message at least with
   that subnet.

8) The FVX 538 is implementing a VPN tunnel to Minnesota and
   presumably there is a similar router on the other end taking
   caring of the far end of the tunnel.

9)  I don't want the non 192.168.0.x clients excluding dodo to
    access the Net through the FVX 538 period.  These hosts
    should only be allowed to go through the tunnel.

10) I am going to try to link a DIA diagram that should help.

In a nutshell, I want to be able to route from the original 
network in Scappoose, it uses black lines in the DIA diagram, 
to a host on the other side of the VPN tunnel implemented by
the FVX 538.  Green lines denote Internet subnet links.  A
dotted black line indicates a link from Dodo to the FVX 538.
A blue line indicates a 192.168.3.0/28 or 192.168.3.16/28 
link.  So, out of the tunnel through the dotted black line
cross a blue line and from one the gateway machines on the
original network go where you need to go.  I am planning on
exposing goose, web, and xerxes.  Possibly more hosts in the
future, but not now.

There is also the problem of making 192.168.0.x and 192.168.1.x
link together ( Scappoose side both networks ).

This problem makes my head hurt.  Renumbering my side may not be
such a bad idea after all.  I detect a few errors in the HOWTO
I mentioned by the way.  The hardest part to figure out for
double nat is what the source nat rule needs to be.

Okay, so the DIA diagram only deals with relevant machines on
the Scappoose side and does NOT cover the Minnesota side at all.
Right now, that side is a black box to me.

For a directory, only the 'x' bit is really unintuitive; the meanings of
the other usual permission bits are:
 o 'r' - List contents - read the contents of the directory file
 o 'w' - Create or delete files or links within the directory; that is,
write to the directory file
 o 'x' - Access the directory, including changing into it and opening
files with it in their path

And then there are POSIX or NFS4 ACLs...

A good way to test things like this is to create yourself a sandbox, so
that you can find out if what you're planning will screw things up or not.
You could just make yourself a directory like '/tmp/test', copy or create
a handful of files there, and then play around. It's a lot easier to learn
these things with hands-on practice and faster than waiting around for
responses from a mailing list.

As you've already been told, no, and particularly surprising would be the
effect of removing the executable bit from your directories.

Here's a script I wrote a while ago because I was having to do this
repeatedly and it was easier to give someone else sudo access to run it
than to teach them the correct chmod command:

I think this piece is complicating matters. It seems you've got multiple 
NICs these boxes
on different networks? Which in the absence of a router and switch/hub I 
understand. But if you could
centralize your routing it would make this a lot less painful.

How do you mean?
A router has a leg into both networks so hosts can communicate
across net boundaries?
Or do you mean by putting them on the same network by making the
subnet smaller such as 192.168.0.x / 22

Okay, so the picture is getting a lot clearer. Thanks!
Unfortunately, I can't seem to open the attachment.
When I attempt to open my box sees it as an ASC file?
I tried to rename it to DIA file.  Dia the sees it as a supported file
type but errors when trying to open it.

A long time ago I learned the benefits of using ls as a test bed,
especially before doing something like rm or rmdir, and even more
especially when using wildcards. 

I have learned a lot, and I now understand the basics. However, I
decided to wait until the Clinic tomorrow.

Subject: [PLUG] Anyone know of "lossy" version-control software?
Message-ID: <49963.192.168.1.18.1261280111.squirrel@nakedape.cc>

I am looking for something that, as far as I have been able to find, does
not exist. I want a version-control package that intentionally and
programmatically destroys revisions.

Before I explain further, let me provide some background use-cases. We
maintain a lot of data automatically and usually do a plain-text dump for
back up and in some cases we stuff these dumps into Subversion, primarily
for ease of roll-back in case something should break. For example, we have
LDIF dumps of our LDAP tree; text dumps of our Cyrus IMAP mailbox list;
generated /etc/group files that are stored and distributed via Subversion,
etc. At other times, when I was subject to Windows DNS admins, I stored
periodic snapshots of DNS zones with RCS.

The problem with keeping this data in a traditional VCS like Subversion is
that I don't actually need all of those revisions. I really need hourly
dumps for the last few days for roll-back purposes. It is sometimes nice
to have a daily or weekly dump to use for data-mining purposes, to answer
questions like, "When did we start setting this attribute like this?" or
"At what rate has our mailbox list grown?" Having snapshots every 5
minutes for a couple hours wouldn't be bad either, but it's not really
feasible if they exist forever. If you think of the way rrdtool maintains
numerical time-series data, then the idea should seem pretty familiar.

So what I want is some sort of archival or version-control software that
can be configured for the programmed destruction of old versions and
keeping selected samples. Back-up software sort of does this and many
packages will backup to a file, but it seems like overkill to have to

Part of the problem is that I just don't know what to call something like
this. "Round-robin archive" sounds good, but that's what rrdtool calls its
archive files. "Rolling-archive" also sounds right, but from what I can

SCM" leads only to snide comments about VisualSourceSafe.

I have used CVS and Subversion enough to know that getting them to throw

There is xclip:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/xclip/

I use it sometimes but it does not always seem to work quite right. Or at
least, the X clipboard/cut buffer standards are enough of a mess that I do
not always understand why it does what it does.

A few months ago I cleaned out my basement and sent a whole pile of Sun
Ultra 5s to Free Geek. You might check with them or on eBay; you should be
able to pick up an old POS like that for $20 or so.

Perhaps you should not be using subversion or cvs for the task.
Maybe something more like dervish with code added to delete older revisions.

Subject: [PLUG] Anyone know of "lossy" version-control software?

I am looking for something that, as far as I have been able to find, does
not exist. I want a version-control package that intentionally and
programmatically destroys revisions.

Before I explain further, let me provide some background use-cases. We
maintain a lot of data automatically and usually do a plain-text dump for
back up and in some cases we stuff these dumps into Subversion, primarily
for ease of roll-back in case something should break. For example, we have
LDIF dumps of our LDAP tree; text dumps of our Cyrus IMAP mailbox list;
generated /etc/group files that are stored and distributed via Subversion,
etc. At other times, when I was subject to Windows DNS admins, I stored
periodic snapshots of DNS zones with RCS.

The problem with keeping this data in a traditional VCS like Subversion is
that I don't actually need all of those revisions. I really need hourly
dumps for the last few days for roll-back purposes. It is sometimes nice to
have a daily or weekly dump to use for data-mining purposes, to answer
questions like, "When did we start setting this attribute like this?" or "At
what rate has our mailbox list grown?" Having snapshots every 5 minutes for
a couple hours wouldn't be bad either, but it's not really feasible if they
exist forever. If you think of the way rrdtool maintains numerical
time-series data, then the idea should seem pretty familiar.

So what I want is some sort of archival or version-control software that can
be configured for the programmed destruction of old versions and keeping
selected samples. Back-up software sort of does this and many packages will
backup to a file, but it seems like overkill to have to setup and configure
Bacula or Amanda just to manage a handful of files.

Part of the problem is that I just don't know what to call something like
this. "Round-robin archive" sounds good, but that's what rrdtool calls its
archive files. "Rolling-archive" also sounds right, but from what I can tell

I would just use GNU/Screen for this.

Copy and Paste
To switch to copy mode, use:
ctrl+a [: Enables copy mode.
Now you can move the cursor around. To start highlighting text, press 
space or enter. Once you're done with highlighting, press space or enter 
again. This will copy highlighted text to a buffer. To paste it, use:
ctrl+a ]: Pastes buffer.

You may also paste from or to a file, to do so:
ctrl+a <: Reads paste buffer from a file.
ctrl+a >: Writes paste buffer into a file.

I'm thinking backup software is the direction you should lead your
search in.  While many featureful backup packages may be a pain to
configure, you should be able to find dozens of lightweight and
flexible ones out there.

For my home use, I use rsync as my backup tool, wrapped up in shell
scripts.  It's primitive, but the --only-write-batch option is nice
for storing incrementals based on some previous snapshot.  I'm pretty
sure there are other packages out there that have taken this approach
and made it more fancy, rdiff-backup being one example
(http://rdiff-backup.nongnu.org/).

Of course this might require some wrapper scripts, but you might end
up with exactly what you want, rather than something close.

Good luck,
tim

Not sure this is what you mean ... when viewing text on a terminal 
window ...
    high desired text
    copy with <Ctrl-Shift-C>
... to paste into a text file using vim ...
    enter insert mode in the manner appropriate to the situation
    paste with <Ctrl-Shift-V>
... to paste into a GUI application such as OpenOffice Writer ...
    paste with <Ctrl-v>
Hope that helps

Free(ish) accounts on DEC Alpha systems running NetBSD at

in and login with "new".  Or maybe you meant something running
Linux?

Yes, I have multiple links where the diagram if the plug list
hadn't screwed it up shows that.  You can count the links
in the diagram and that shows the number of networks that machine
is hooked to ( treat the Net as one network ) which equals the
number of interfaces in that machine.

192.168.0.x/24 network was implemented by my brother for the Office
which was split off of the original network.  Dodo is acting as a
router.  Dodo has one leg in the 192.168.0.x/24 (or theoretically
it will have a leg to there) and two other legs to three other 
networks.  192.168.3.0/28 and 192.168.3.16/28 are accessible 
through one leg and 192.168.4.0/24, the network dodo boots over, 
is available on a third leg.  The diagram would help as it 
shows all of the switches, the FVX 538, the Linksys WAP11 between
web/xerxes and dodo, and the DSL modem.  The diagram also 
differentiates the links in different networks by color.

My brother's network is the FVX 538, a Netgear switch/802.11g
appliance, my other brother's computer in the Office, and a 
printer in the office.  The link from the Office to the server 
room, a wired line, was taken off of the original network to 
create this isolated network.  The routing is not centralized 
and that is confusing, but it can't be helped.  The Office 
network has to be reliable because it is being used by a 
business.  I just want to be able to go to the business VPN 
from the original network and I want to be able to instant 
message computers in the office from the original network.
I think that the FVX has the only static address in the 
192.168.0.x network and that everything else in the office
network is assigned by it randomly.  This could be a problem
because how do I instant someone on a computer that has a
random IP address?

In some ways it would be nice to say let's start over and go from
a parallel routing situation to a singular routing infrastructure,
but I don't think that's an option.  To some degree, the business
network has to operate independently of the original network.  This
is why my goal is to only allow instant messaging between Office
computers and original private network computers, at least initially.

I am going to put the DIA diagram on my global ftp servers because it
appears to be one of the only ways that I can get it out to people
reading the plug list that want to study it:

ftp://ftp.robinson-west.com/pub/robinson-west_com.dia

           or:

ftp://ftp2.robinson-west.com/pub/robinson-west_com.dia

The hardest part of making a diagram, finding the right
tool to diagram with and learning what to diagram.  I
don't diagram every single host, only the servers/routers
and maybe a printer.

Okay, I'll take a look at it and see if I can offer up some useful
advice keeping in mind all your connectivity requirements. I must say,
this is the 1st time I tried to do a network diagram w. Dia and it was
extremely painful compared to Visio...

One of the great things about diagramming networks is that
you can play around with different ideas and design the network
to be meet your reqs, be flexible, scalabe, reliable, fast, easy
to troubleshoot, etc.

And then you can come up w. an implementation plan.

It's too bad you live so far out and don't come to PLUG events, because
it would be great to have a whiteboard brainstorming session w. you. I 
really
dig this kind of stuff, alot! :-)

Check out the rm_older_than function in git-home-history. Might be a
good place to start:

I don't have experience with running virtual machines and am not
sure if my hardware will support that very well.  The most memory
I have is 1 gig in a machine.  And that machine may be used as
a server in the future, so I'd have less in an alternative machine.

Also returning to the question about copy/paste, someone
suggested xclip.  I downloaded it and built it, but so far am
not getting it to do what I want.  I've tried:

cat file | xclip

and

xclip file

and

xclip -i file

and then pasting what is in the clipboard.  But it pastes
something I had previously put in the clipboard by
clicking on copy.  I'm using Fedora 12.

Sounds like you want the "make backups using rsync" tool that was described at
Advanced PLUG a few years ago.  Can't recall the name though.

Generally, my rule of thumb to keep me out of trouble is that if a snapshot is
triggered by a human because a logical change has happened, a version control
system is appropriate.  But if a snapshot is triggered by a time passing, then
a version control system is *not* appropriate, and I should be looking at a
backup solution instead.

Message-ID: <da77481d0912211049r28507f3bhd64a0106eb2be245@mail.gmail.com>

I have a dual boot machine with two physical drives - Windows XP Pro and
Debian testing. I need to replace the Windows drive with another drive to
add more space to the Debian drive. Instead of just chucking the Windows
drive drive (only 40GB and the machine only has space for two hard drives),
I thought I would virtualize it and run it in virtualbox on the Debian
machine. I am having no success in (1) finding a lot of information on how
to do this and (2) actually accomplishing the task.

I have tried using vmware vcenter converter 4.0.1. I have the client running
on one Linux machine (hammerhead), the Windows source on another (basenji),
and the destination folder is a windows share on a third machine (goofy).
After struggling to get it to run, it dies within a minute with an error:

FAILED: Unable to create a VSS snapshot of the source volume(s). Error code:
2147754758 (0x80042306).

It is able to find the client and source folder with no issues. Googling the
error code and message did not give me any good results. I had one warning
on the config setup screen - "Unable to locate the required Sysprep files.
Please upload them under /var/vmware-vcenter-converter-standalone/sysprep/xp
on the Converter server machine." I found the .cab on the Microsoft site and
put it in the required location, but I still get that warning.

My questions -

1. Anyone know how to get VMware converter to work? My assumption, after
some reading, is that virtualbox will be able to import the output from
vmware converter.

2. Other suggestions for recipes to virtualize a physical Windows XP drive?

Thanks!

Mark

P.S. The other reason I want to make this work, is that I have a new laptop
with Windows 7. I planto install Debian and virtualize the Windows 7
partition and get rid of the dual boot. This excercise with the Windows XP
drive is my test bed to see how to make it work. I am not sure if there are
any extra gotchas to virtualizing Windows 7.

Are you referring to rdiff-backup maybe?

 From the features page:

"rdiff-backup saves those changes in the form of reverse diffs, so you 
can recover the older form of the file."

"For instance, suppose last week you deleted half of some document, 
thinking that what you had written was garbage. Yesterday, your backup 
event ran, saving these changes. Today you realize that you were on to 
something and want what you deleted back. With rdiff-backup, the newer 
version would indeed be present, but in a special directory 
(rdiff-backup-data/) there would be a file that recorded this change. 
Running rdiff-backup on this file recovers the version from a week ago."

I haven't seen rsnapshot mentioned yet. It's my favorite backup tool and 
can be used to save the last X snapshots of data.

I am interested, but I note there was some confusion about the
content. I think some were expecting a beginning class and others were
expecting an advanced class.

I assume when the details become confirmed this will be clarified.

How can I make this happen?

I'm thinking I want to delete the default route.  I'm thinking
it comes from dhcp during boot.

what DOES happen when the destination is 192.168.1.0/24? Can you provide a
traceroute?

I don't know what "table 3" means, but I'm pretty sure that if it doesn't
show up in "ip route list" it's not going to be effective.

>From the ip(8) man page:

...
Route tables: Linux-2.x can pack routes  into  several  routing  tables
identified  by  a number in the range from 1 to 255 or by name from the
file /etc/iproute2/rt_tables main table (ID 254) and  the  kernel  only
uses this table when calculating routes.
...

On my system, ip route list gives the same output as ip route list table
254. I would expect the same result on your system.

If I understand things correctly, when fwmark 0x3 is seen
routing table 3 should be used and when fwmark 0x2 is seen
routing table 2 should be used.  

If I do:

ip rule add table 2
or
ip rule add table 3

then this table will get used and ping works.  

I can't hard wire the route, sometimes packets will come from
web and sometimes they will come from xerxes.  Which
is why I have mac_route added to the firewall:

[root at dodo firewall]# cat mac_route 
iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -m mac --mac-source 00:02:E3:02:C8:8F \
                   -j MARK --set-mark 3

iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -m mac --mac-source 00:40:F4:2D:AF:5C \
                   -j MARK --set-mark 2
[root at dodo firewall]# 

The following is route_web.bash:

#!/bin/bash
#
PATH=/sbin:/usr/bin

# Get line count PREROUTING -t mangle...
line_count=`iptables -nvL PREROUTING -t mangle|wc -l|tr -d ' '`
let line_count-=2

if [ "$line_count" == "2" ]
then
      iptables -t mangle -I PREROUTING 3 -j MARK --set-mark 2
else
      iptables -t mangle -R PREROUTING 3 -j MARK --set-mark 2
fi

The following is route_xerxes.bash:

#!/bin/bash
#
PATH=/sbin:/usr/bin

# Get line count PREROUTING -t mangle...
line_count=`iptables -nvL PREROUTING -t mangle|wc -l|tr -d ' '`
let line_count-=2

if [ "$line_count" == "2" ]
then
      iptables -t mangle -I PREROUTING 3 -j MARK --set-mark 3
else
      iptables -t mangle -R PREROUTING 3 -j MARK --set-mark 3
fi

The following is the portion of the firewall that manipulates the
routing tables:
                  ...
     export lan_net="192.168.1.0/24"
                  ...
             export w1nweb="192.168.3.18"
             export w1nxer="192.168.3.2"

ip route flush table 2
ip route flush table 3

ip route add $lan_net dev eth0 via $w1nweb table 2
ip route add $lan_net dev eth0 via $w1nxer table 3

ip rule add fwmark 2 table 2
ip rule add fwmark 3 table 3

As far as traceroute, Network is unreachable doesn't seem traceable.

Another routing table can get used, the problem is that the MARK
applied to packets in the PREROUTING chain of the mangle table
never seems to trigger use of the appropriate table.  I'm beginning
to wonder if there is some sysctl option breaking this or something
similar.

Wow, this is just a ton of info to take in and make sense out of. It
hurts my brain trying to parse it all.

If I had my druthers, I would love to run an app the would ping, trace, and
visually map all the network connectivity. I've been looking for one, 
but thus
far haven't found one that does exactly that.

Each time I look at the diagram, I can't help but think if you replaced 
all the
switches w. routers and off load the routing that would somehow 
magically make
everything better.

But maybe not, maybe because of your traffic requirements maybe 
implementing
VLANs would make the most sense. I say this because with VLANs you can 
create
networks based on MAC address, protocol, or ip address. And with 802.1 q 
tagging
a single host can participate in many different VLANs.

Man, this is just one of those problems that's just going to eat away at 
me...

Subject: [PLUG] Help Resizing Windows 7 Partition for Debian Install
Message-ID: <da77481d0912221828k108c44bdhad25f192dc60dec1@mail.gmail.com>

I have a new Dell Vostro laptop and I want to add Debian to it. It has
Windows 7 Home Premium on it. When I went into the Windows 7 disk manager
all I could get was 1/2 of the C partition - 143 GB for Debian, and it
reserved the other 143 GB for Windows 7, even though it is only using 16GB
of the disk!

Is this some evil trick by Microsoft to keep people from dual booting, or is
there some reason Windows 7 needs all 143 GB for itself when all the files
on the disk amount to 16GB??? What am I missing?

Can I just use gparted to resize the drive the way I want it - 40GB or 60GB
for Windows and the rest for a real operating system like Debian? ;-)

Thanks!

Mark

Subject: [PLUG] Discussion topic - Choosing to run Gentoo vs Debian or Red
	Hat
Message-ID: <4B31A486.7080001@gmail.com>

I recently had a tech interview w. an organization that runs Gentoo on 
all its
servers. Part of the interview was to login into a test box, build a 
LAMP server,
install some software and upgrade some stuff.

This was my first time ever doing anything w. Gentoo and I was quite 
surprised by
how different it was than say Debian or RH. Not to mention the lack of good
documentation or what I call "build guides" that you can follow and will 
help
you build out a server. Granted, they're never perfect but can usually 
get you
85% or more of the way home.

So, my questions for discussion are:

1. Gentoo's claim to fame is that by compiling each package for the
specific architecture that performance gains are realized.
Has anyone found this to be empirically true?

2. If I were making the decisions on which Linux distro to run, I would 
choose
one which I think would more people would tend to have experience with 
and that
has a greater mindshare such as Debian or RH.

3. Does anyone have significant experience working on or supporting Gentoo?
If so, what has your experience been?

RHEL, Ubuntu and SuSE are the only commercially supported distros that I'm
aware of. I guess it's a matter of the support the org is looking for and
what your specific needs and experience is.

Drew,

Thanks! Windows complained with a chkdsk operation, but now my Windows  7 is
snuggled down in its 40 GB space.....where it belongs! ;-)

Are they still interviewing? :)

I can't tell the difference, but I'm not running any CPU intensive
stuff that gentoo generated via its package manager.  Anything that
/is/ CPU intensive will probably be compiled by myself.

While not a question, I will comment.  I will agree that familiarity
can have performance gains.  Nevertheless, the most ridiculous
technologies have become commonplace and even traditional.  I will
mention the use of .NET development tools here at work.  While our
developers are familiar with .NET tools and they're easy to learn, I
am definitely NOT impressed with the quality of work derived from
these tools.

I like Gentoo.  I haven't used it in a professional environment,
however.  The whole compile time issue would keep me from using Gentoo
unless, of course, someone paid me to use it. :)  I like Debian, also,
and I would use it in a heartbeat.  My only problem is that you can't
really tell it what NOT to install, but I doubt space is really an
issue on modern systems.

As you can see, routing table lcl_xer and routing table
lcl_web both have routing rules for 192.168.1.0/24.
Oddly enough, the logging rules in the mangle table
never trigger.  When I try to ping 192.168.1.1 I
just get an error that the network is unreachable.
This is not in the advanced routing howto guide
folks.  The kernel is 2.4.22 and yes I checked
for MARK support and yes I did compile it in.
It appears that the kernel not seeing a route in
the main table doesn't produce any packets.

Yes they are, and it's a great organization, The Open Planning
Project. Their fine work includes the Trimet trip planner software.

My preference is Debian. I think it has a great pkg mgmt system, it's 
very stable,
and there's tons of docs / how-to's. Also, many other distros are 
derived from it. It's what I
cut my Linux teeth on and I haven't found a compelling reason to use 
another distro outside
of general curiosity...

Subject: [PLUG] Transmission v. Vuze
Message-ID: <20091222214950.2d28d81d@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I have long used Transmission, even though it is lacking in features. I
like Ktorrent better, but it doesn't work well in Gnome. A couple times
in the past I tried Azureus, but could never get it to work. That was on
Ubuntu. Now I am on Fedora 11 and decided to try it again. After much
hassle I finally got 4.0.0.3 working. (But don't suggest updating to
4.3 because the updater just crashes.)

So here I am trying to download a file by torrent with my newly
installed Vuze. Vuze can't get the tracker to respond. I left it
trying for an hour with no luck. 

So I stopped the torrent in Vuze and launched Transmission.
Transmission also failed to get the tracker to respond, but in spite of
not getting a response from the tracker, Transmission started
downloading the pieces. That was half an hour ago and it has downloaded
half the file, at a rate of 200 KB/s. 

I am very muy mucho confused and Google isn't helping. How can
Transmission download the pieces without communicating with the
tracker? If Transmission doesn't need the tracker, why does Vuze just
sit and do nothing until it gets an OK from the tracker?

I'm guessing Vuze doesn't support DHT which doesn't require a tracker.

well, I'm glad you included more information, but like Mike, your situation
is now way over my head. I agree with him that it would be in your best
interests to attempt to simplify your network configuration. but, if this is
the way you need it to be, then you should be prepared for this kind of
consequence that occurs naturally as a result of complexity.

Why not just add a route statement in one of your startup scripts? It's a
kludgy hack but it gets the job done.

The "network unreachable" message is always indicative
of a routing problem. This likely means that whatever interface
packets destined for 192.168.1.0/24 network are going out, the
next hop doesn't have a route to this network.

Remember how routing works. It does a logical and of the subnet network and
subnet mask, If it's determined that the destination is not a local 
network. Than a route
table lookup begins. The longest match will win and then the packet gets 
sent out
that interface. The packet arrives at the next hop. That router does a 
lookup and says,
no good, you can't get there from here, and then sends a network 
unreachable mssg back.

I think you need to invoke the powers of tcpdump to
figure out which interface packets for that network are egressing. And 
you'll also
see the network unreachable mssg reply from the next hop.

Also, if you have a mis-configured network mask somewhere in there
that could also be the culprit.

Sometimes the Vuze tracker status column will say just "OK," and other
times it will say "OK-dht." I assume that means that it does support
DHT. 

I just discovered something that my solve my problems. Apparently Vuze
is set by default not to allow more than three torrents to download at
a time. It took me several hours to figure that out. Once I set it to
"unlimited" the other torrents were suddenly able to find the trackers
and immediately started downloading.

If I do:
 
	ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0

and even if I do:

	ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 dev eth2 via 192.168.4.2 metric 2

this seems to get things working.  Even the marking of
packets seems to be working.  One would assume you
don't need a route in the main table, but I guess you
do.  I did add a MARK rule to the OUTPUT portion of
the mangle table which seems to be necessary to route
locally generated packets properly.  Confusingly enough,
locally generated packets never seem to go through
the PREROUTING portion of the mangle table which makes
no sense at all.

I have pine on this Fedora Core 1 machine by the way,
the stock Postfix, 2.0.11, doesn't work with it.  
Grabbed the source to postfix-2.0.20 and did a make 
followed by a make upgrade.  It works now.  

I wonder what other bugs are lurking???

I found it to be true on my SPARC, but not so much on x86 boxen.

Seasoned Gentoo admins are harder to come by than Debian/RH/SuSE 
admins. If your local Gentoo guru is hit by the proverbial bus, it'll 
take that much more time for the replacement admin to come up to 
speed.

> 3. Does anyone have significant experience working on or supporting

I've only maintained a few Gentoo systems, two at home and two at 
work. All are now retired.

The big upside for me was flexibility. To install openssh-server on a 
Debian system, for instance, you've got to install several X11 
libraries as dependencies. If you don't want X on your system, and you 
don't want to compile your own sshd, you're out of luck in a 
mainstream distro. With Gentoo, it's no problem!

On the other hand...

a) It's VERY easy to get a Gentoo box into an idiosyncratic state
    with all sorts of mismatched package levels. I think a really
    good Gentoo admin could avoid that sort of mess, but it would
    take a lot of discipline and planning.

b) Package updates can be very disruptive, and those disruptions
    occur far too frequently. All of a sudden, for instance, you'll
    get a major version bump that requires reconfiguration and
    recompilation of lots and lots of packages. I don't think I
    would run Gentoo in a production environment unless I had an
    extremely accurate testing environment for staging changes.

c) Broken packages were far more common in Gentoo than in
    other distributions. That may have changed, but I grew to
    dread updates.

In short, my assessment is that the time required to build, test, and 
deploy Gentoo packages wasn't worth the mild speed gains and packaging 
flexibility it could provide.

YMMV.

I have been out of practice on Gentoo for a while now, but found (especially
on older/slower hardware) that side by side it did seem to run smoother and
quicker (once you finally got it running smoother/quicker). For most common
desktop applications and users, I doubt most would notice the difference
without searching for it.

However, if you're talking a cluster deployment, conceptually, a 1%
improvement is a free machine for every 100. If they can get 5% improvement,
and deploy 1000 machines... And then consider the TCO of cooling and
electrical consumption saved over the life of the machines. I would suspect
that any shop deploying enough machines to REALLY make a difference is going
to be doing a custom image with whatever distro they use, and in every
distro I've tried, you can build the kernel and all apps from source if you
really want to and can figure out how. The difference with Gentoo is that
level of customization is the default option, so even a non-guru Gentoo
admin can compile just about anything if they can find documentation, and
since of course the organization keeps their documentation up to date... ...

You can also do Gentoo deployment with distcc and/or build binaries to
redeploy on other machines. I can't remember where I saw it (perhaps Ohio
Linux Fest a couple years ago) but talked to some guys who had a small
Gentoo build cluster and repository and had all the machines set up to see
if there was an existing compiled binary in their own repository before
requesting compiling.

This isn't really related to your original question, but I've frequently 
encountered problems getting torrent downloads started, and find they 
can hang indefinitely. A workaround that seems to fix this pretty 
consistently is to let transmission start the download, see that nothing 
happens after a minute, and then pause and restart the download. That 
usually gets it going for me.

issue showed up.  I have a work-around, but I am curious if anyone
here has ideas as to why Qwest programmed it as they apparently did.

The issue:
I set up the DHCP server parameters to use static dns addresses of
69.64.224.66 and 69.64.224.67.
Sent a DHCP request, the modem responds with its own IP (192.168.0.1)
as the primary DNS and what I had entered as the secondary.  A DNS
request to  192.168.0.1 fails.  A DNS request sent to 69.64.224.67 or
69.64.224.66  works fine.

I have had many email exchanges with Actiontec about this.  Trying to
get them to say why this made sense did not get very far.  Their very
first response seems to be the most clear:

"Honestly not sure why its programmed this way.
The DNS is resolved by the WAN connection with Qwest so the primary
DNS is 205.171.3.65 and secondary is 205.171.2.65  The PK5000 holds
these settings in memory and relays them by using its Gateway IP as
the primary.  Same is true if you set static DNS servers in memory.
The PK5000 and in fact all Qwest DSL Gateways, show the gateway IP as
the primary DNS."

Yet later response from Actiontek said:

"The PK5000 itself is NOT a DNS server or redirection device. There is
no programming in fact to do a DNS redirection internally. It cannot
do that at all.
It simply takes the DNS servers configured statically in the DHCP
server settings, or takes the DNS servers provided by the ISP and
broadcasts them as part of its DHCP server services."

The best guess I can come up with is that it works when Qwest is the
ISP.  I am not using Qwest.

Finally a email from Qwest support said:

"Qwest Broadband Technical Support was unable to create an email
ticket based on the information you provided on our web site."

I suspect this is because I was forced to say that my OS was "other".
They do not want to talk to me.

Comments?

It shouldn't matter who you are using. Every actiontec I've ever used has
tried to do this gateway redirection resolution juju and sometimes it works,
sometimes it fails. It shouldn't however, if configured with static DNS on
the internal nat'd side instead of getting it through the WAN side DHCP
service, then it should work correctly on the LAN side. If it's not working
like that, that indeed is rather weird.

It sounds like you're more interested in knowing why the Actiontek
DSL modem is setup this way than a workaround.

But, in case you do want a workaround to this retardedness you could try 
the following:

In the '/etc/ppp/peers/dsl-provider' file, comment out the "usepeerdns" 
line,

This way your resolv.conf file won't be overwritten and you can point at 
whatever DNS
you want to.

I just did away with all my DNS troubles by installing DNS cache.

Thanks to Mike I now understand a bit about DHT. Both Transmission and
Vuze are DHT-enabled, but Transmission does a better job. That is,
Transmission starts the download immediately as soon as it finds
someone in the swarm, even if it cannot get the tracker to respond. I
have downloaded entire files with Transmission without it ever
connecting with the tracker. Vuze does the same thing, but it never
downloads anything from someone in the swarm until it connects with the
tracker. On the other hand, Vuze seems to do a much better job of
connecting with the tracker.

I used Ktorrent for a long time instead of Transmission because it had
a lot more features. However, the recent versions have some nasty bugs
when run in Gnome, so I abandoned it in favor of Transmission. However,
now that I have used Vuze for a couple of days I notice that it is so
similar to Ktorrent that it is uncanny. The user interface is virtually
the same. Unfortunately, it also has a few bugs, although they are not
critical. I'm going to stick with it for a while.

Thanks Tim! What I take away from this that in certain applications
a small, 10% or so, performance gain can be had w. a custom build.
However, in some cases Ubuntu performed just as well if not better.

I thought it was odd they chose Ubuntu to compare against. I would think
Debian testing, RHEL, or Suse would be a more appropriate choice.

I've run Debian stable and now testing on my laptop for about 3 yrs. Gladly
trading some of the conveniences of Ubuntu for speed, as it always seemed
sluggish to me compared to Debian.

Ubuntu seems like a good choice to compare speed with to me, as it has
somewhat of a reputation of being slow compared to other distros. it's the
trade-off for usability.

Sorry, deleted the original email, hijacking this one.

Being a gentoo "enthusiast" (to put it mildly), I have deployed it in
production environments. I have laid out a few items of interest
here. The tone is not meant to be persuasive; I only mean to describe
the similarities and differences (mostly the latter) of a gentoo
system.

Gentoo is based on FreeBSD. I have never used FreeBSD, so I can't say
how well the non-linuxy parts of gentoo follow the BSD standard. One
thing is the hiding of runlevels. Being linux, gentoo has runlevels 0
through 6, but they are glossed over with ones called boot, default,
nonetwork and single.

Another difference is the initscripts. Gentoo has its own interpreter
for initscripts called /sbin/runscript. Among its features is the
ability to calculate dependencies, so that it is not necessary to
place the initscripts in any particular order by namimg them with the
numbers 00-99.

Initscripts that require configuration have files in
/etc/conf.d/. This is where you tell apache which optional modules to
load, where you configure network interfaces, choose a console keymap,
a timezone, etc.

System-wide environment variables are set in /etc/env.d/. The command
"env-update" causes all the data in this directory to be copied to a
single file called /etc/profile.env, which gets sourced by
/etc/profile.

And then there's portage, the package management system. I believe
this is a feature that closely follows the BSD way. Won't get into it
here; it's a broad topic. All the stuff about USE flags and CFLAGS
deserves more explanation. One key difference is the portage tree,
which is a copy of every build script needed by every package
available for gentoo. Every gentoo box has a local copy of the tree,
which is kept up to date with an rsync-based utility. It is trivially
easy to turn any gentoo box into a local mirror.

I might be missing some other differences, but I can't think of them
right now. In most other respects, gentoo is very much linux. In fact,
it is a lot like debian when it wants to be, just not the apt
part. For instance, the whole common lisp setup is copied from
debian. Apache is handled in the usual way, as is PHP, postgresql and
mysql. Once you get a basic gentoo box built, and get the LAMP
components installed, configuring them is just like debian, or at
least more like debian than redhat.

The gentoo handbook is a very good piece of documentation for building
a gentoo box. It is comprehensive and very well QAed. I would follow
it to the letter. You do not need a gentoo boot disc to perform a
gentoo build. My favorite boot medium for a gentoo build is a finnix
disc.

In a production environment, I update gentoo boxes once a month if I
have the luxury. I am loathe to go longer than 3 months because things
can get complicated if you wait longer than that. There are no gentoo
releases, no version numbers. There is only up to date, or not. Each
new update added to the portage tree causes the gentoo build to be
newer and a little different. After 3 months, things can get so far
afield that upgrading becomes messy.

I have made assumptions that the bogus dns address is in fact returned
by the PK5000.
Initially I set in the PK5000:
DSL configuration
STATIC
Primary DNS 69.64.224.66
Secondary DNS 69.64.224.67

If /etc/network/interfaces contains iface eth0 inet dhcp, then
/etc/resolv.conf ends up after boot with 192.168.0.1 as the primary
and 69.64.224.67 as the secondary.  I have assumed that the PK5000 is
responsible for this.  Maybe not.  What other stuff on my system could
be doing this?  Is there a way to test it to confirm that it is in
fact returning these addresses?

A visiting geek here fixed things by installing resolvconf and
changing  /etc/network/interfaces to contain:
iface eth0 inet static
  address 192.168.0.70
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  gateway 192.168.0.1
  dns-nameservers 69.64.224.66 69.64.224.67

Now the dns addresses are correct, at the cost of a static IP.  (This
is not a problem for my one-machine system.)

Mike asked:

DSL modem is setup this way than a workaround.

True.  I have a work-around.  I am asking the WHY question.  Is there
any way that this (presumed) behaviour can be considered correct?

In researching this problem, I found many threads from people w. DSL
service having DNS problems. The common theme in all of them is the
"peerdns" setting that is in various interface config or dhcp scripts
depending on the Linux distro.

It seems that this is at the heart of the issue.  If you do a Google 
search on
"DSL peerdns" you'll see a lot of threads on this.

The "peerdns" setting seems to be specific to DSL service and people 
seem to
have the same problems not just with Qwest nor with just the Actiontec
modem. As DSL is provided by a Telephone company it doesn't surprise me that
they get this wrong. I've worked with Telephony folks and most of them 
don't
understand TCP/IP.

Subject: [PLUG] Mayor Adams makes pitch to software community
Message-ID: <4B33CF66.3070305@gmail.com>

I just heard about this. Maybe as per usual, I'm the last one to know 
about such things.
But I thought I'd share in case I'm not...

A few interesting quotes from the article:

"Portland plans to develop a strategy for nurturing the regional 
software community early next year, and is doing business with a pair of 
local startups in an effort to promote the city's software community,"

"The city, in conjunction with other local agencies and governments, 
plans to launch an app contest next month to spur developers to create 
mobile apps with useful, local information. It's modeled by Apps for 
Democracy in Washington, D.C. City CTO Mark Greinke said the city has 
set aside about $25,000 for the contest and plans to award no more than 
$1,000 per app. The goal, he said, is to use the money to spur interest 
among developers -- not to finance entire apps."

Message-ID: <da77481d0912242130q7460dbfv6f72db2ab8aab703@mail.gmail.com>

I just installed Debian stable (2.6-amd64 kernel) on a machine. I had to
remove the kernel module for the Ethernet card and add a different one. The
new module compiled etc and works. However, I had a problem preventing the
old module from loading. There was no modprobe.conf file, but instead a
directory modprobe.d with a lot of files in it. However, I could not find
the expected alias line with the bad module's name. I finally googled a
solution, and I am curious if this is the new way to disabling a kernel
module:
I created a file in /etc/modprobe.d/ called 00local. That file has one line:
install r8169 /bin/true. This prevented the module r8169 from being loaded.
I grepped all of /etc/ looking for r8169 and could not find where it was
being loaded. I am so confused....

G'night and Happy Holidays to everyone!

Did you customize the kernel and rebuild it? Then why not remove the
bad module from the kernel config entirely, and recompile. Then it
could not possible load. Or am I misunderstanding how debian works?
Did you need to rebuild your kernel to get the new nic driver, or did
you install the module via some other means (apt)?

I'm running Debian Sid w. 2.6 kernel and I just edit
the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf when I don't
want the onboard Intel sound card driver to install so I can use
my usb headset or speakers instead.

/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
# This file lists modules which will not be loaded as the result 
of                    
# alias expansion, with the purpose of preventing the hotplug 
subsystem                
# to load them. It does not affect autoloading of modules by the 
kernel.               
# This file is provided by the udev package.          

If I understand the part about "alias expansion" above, I would presume 
that means
if a module is listed in the modules.alias file for the current running 
kernel than it will
get loaded. Did you check this?

/lib/modules/2.6.32-1.slh.4-sidux-686# ls
build   modules.alias      modules.dep      modules.symbols
kernel  modules.alias.bin  modules.dep.bin  modules.symbols.bin

You could also try rmmod command in the event that modprobe -r didn't
work for some weird reason.

I just downloaded the module source, the kernel headers etc. and used make
to build and install the module. I did not rebuild the whole kernel. I think
I have to learn about the blacklist file under modprobe.d

Hello!
I am running a dual boot system Kubuntu 9.10 I think and Windows 7, they are 
on the same disk. Since this is a desktop machine I just let the install go to 
default and I ended up with a partition of about 250 for each. Everything 
works great, I do use the Windows 7 system as I have moved to a 64 bit 
processor and I am to lazy to set up wine on a 64 bit processor to run 32 bit 
programs. So far there has been no problem.

Just a note,

This  appears to be a relatively common issue.  Google is your friend.   Try
starting at the link below.  While the keyboard might not be the same, the
solution should be general enough to cover your situation.

You should be able to, but it's pretty low-level stuff.  Check out the
man pages for showkey(1), loadkeys(1), dumpkeys(1), keymaps(5), and
xmodmap(1). Note that I've only used showkey to look at the scancodes
from my (cheap and cheesy Belkin) USB multimedia keyboard; I've not
yet tried to change my key mappings. 

At any rate, those man pages should get you started.

   I use keymaps to swap the left ctrl and caps lock leys. They're
implemented in the console with loadkeys and in X with xmodmap.

I'm running ltsp 4.2 on CentOS 5.3.  I am wondering if it supports the
mouse that comes with the Logitech MK700 keyboard/mouse combo?  So far,
I haven't been able to get it working at all.  I've tried modifying lts.conf,
but I'm not sure what to put in it.

I mentioned earlier that I was having trouble with a new dsl modem's
behavior as a dns server.  That has been resolved by avoiding dhcp.
This was accomplished with the help of a visiting geek (my son).
Resolveconf was installed; dns addresses set statically,

As best as I can determine, everything is working fine.  But I seek
some understanding.  The resolv.conf contains some entries which make
no sense to me.  The visiting geek is no longer interested in these
questions, as it is no longer broken.  So I appeal to you.

resolv.conf:

# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)
#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
nameserver 192.168.0.1
nameserver 69.64.224.67
nameserver 69.64.224.66
search domain.actdsltmp

I expect that the nameserver 192.168.0.1 entry is left over from
earlier dhcp responses.  (Visiting geek's Debian machine has only the
two valid nameserver entries in his file--he had not run a dhcp
client.)  Why does it persist in this file? And why does it not break
dns searches occasionally?  If I run dig repeatedly, only the
69.64.224.67 address seems to get used.  If I force use of
192.168.0.1, it fails, as expected.

What does "search domain.actdsltmp" do?  Is domain.actdsltmp a valid name?

Should I attempt to clean up this file?  If I should, how might that be done?

Thanks for any education you can throw my way.

192.168.0.1 is most likely the IP address of your DSL router. I never
used resolvconf, but if it's writing this file, then I'll bet that
there is some sort of DNS server running on the router. Run the
following command from a root shell (it will take a long time to run):

   nmap -sU 192.168.0.1

If you see UDP port 53 listed as open, then there is a DNS server
running on the router. (If you see port 68, that's the DHCP server.)
If this is true, it would be in your best interests to get it working
properly, and use it instead of going directly to the ISP DNS
servers. The local DNS server should be doing lookups on behalf of all
users on your LAN, and caching the results for faster speed and less
internet chatter.

The "search" line is for when you attempt to resolve a
non-fully-qualified hostname. For instance, my local domain is
pippiandcarlos.com, and this is reflected in my resolv.conf file as
"search pippiandcarlos.com". If I try to "ping ns", it will be
converted to "ping ns.pippiandcarlos.com".

I hate to be a party pooper, but I still feel that using resolvconf
and static IPs is a bandaid that will continue to peel off when
wet. The right thing to do is to get your own DNS and DHCP servers
(the ones on the DSL router) working properly. Of course these DSL
modems are notoriously crappy, and it is quite possible that fiddling
with its configuration will have no effect. That's why I use cable and
my own linux box as a router/firewall. Cable modems do not contain
router/firewalls; they simply pass the connection through. The last
DSL modem I had was an Actiontek which did not respond to any of my
attempts to configure it. Qwest refused to replace it. They told me I
could buy my own. Customer exits stage.

Correction: DHCP is on UDP port 67, not 68.

from reading the resolvconf manpage (
http://www.clab.it/cgi-bin/man/man2html?resolvconf+8) I infer that it causes
the resolv.conf file to no longer be used, meaning the data in that file is
now irrelevant. Resolvconf appears to store its data somewhere else, but I
didn't read long enough to find out where.

The "search" entry would have come from your DSL modem and is there because
whatever ISP originally configured it wanted it there.

I have to say I agree pretty strongly w. Carlos on this. And unlike your
"visiting geek", problems are always interesting to me until things work 
the
way that I understand that they should work.

With that said, the config file /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
on Debian should control your DNS destiny...

To the best of my knowledge you have a few options to control what
info you get from the DHCP server when you send a DHCP request.

1. Make sure the following requirement line is commented / deleted:

    #require subnet-mask, domain-name-servers

2. In the "request" stanza below you can remove "domain-name-servers":

    request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, routers,
    *domain-name-servers*, interface-mtu,rfc3442-classless-static-routes,

3. In the event that the above doesn't stop the overwriting of your
resolv.conf file with bad DNS info you can add this prepend statement:

    prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;

4. You can make the resolv.conf file unchangeable by setting the
    "immutable" attribute:
    
    chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf

5. Last but not least you could make the resolvoconf script itself 
either unreadable
    , rename it, or hack it

   /etc/dhcp3/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/resolvconf

This is not necessarily true. In my current field of work, I talk to a lot
of people using home-based internet connections, and some of them do have
Comcast cable with a router/modem device. I will say that they are typically
far better than the Actiontec DSL modems, but they still don't always do
what I want.

Further, many (if not most) DSL modems can be configured for "bridged" mode,
which turns off the router part and makes it act like just a modem, as you
describe about cable modems.

Thanks for all the information and advice.  Unfortunately, Carlos'
comment about dsl modems applies in my situation: an Actiontec modem
from Qwest.  So attempts to change its dhcp behavior will not bear
fruit.  My use of resolvconf is a sensible solution to a
less-than-perfect state of affairs.  Mike's suggestions seem a better
solution, and I will study those, but until then, resolvconf is my
ticket to functioning.  (To settle the question of what this modem
can/cannot do, from Actiontec I received: "The PK5000 itself is NOT a
DNS server or redirection device. There is no programming in fact to
do a DNS redirection internally. It cannot do that at all.")

With regard to the /etc/resolv.conf file, it is a link to
etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf, which is maintained by resolvconf.

Now, to get to the unanswered questions in my post:

Why does the presence of "nameserver 192.168.0.1" in resolv.conf not
break dns searches occasionally?

Should I attempt to clean up this file?  If I should, how might that
be done?  Since  a dhcp client in not now running on my machine, the
bogus entries, once gone, should stay gone.

I can only theorize that the resolvconf program handles its contents
differently, if at all.

Easy pal, no one is trying to steer you wrong. It can feel like that
if you remain fixated on a solution that isn't necessarily the
best. The best solution: get off qwest, go with a cable provider that
uses a pass-through modem, and use your own router/firewall (a $30
hardware job or a linux box).

But to stick within the confines of your situation: It is quite
possible to do DHCP without rewriting the resolv.conf file. Gentoo
allows a line like the following to be placed into /etc/conf.d/net:

   dhcp_eth0="nodns"

This produces the required behavior of leaving resolv.conf alone. It
does so by adding the appropriate command-line option to the DHCP
client. I use pump. It has this option:

   -d       --no-dns                Don't update DNS resolver configuration

Every distro has its own way of configuring custom options for startup
services like DHCP. Which distro are you using? Once we know that, we
can figure out where the -d must go.

Once you achieve this, you can write the resolv.conf file any way you
like, and it will remain so.

Or, if you don't want to turn DHCP back on, simply edit resolv.conf
right now in an editor, and it will stay put as long as you aren't
running any services that can change it, like resolvconf. Simply turn
resolvconf off. It has performed its duty of sniffing out the qwest
nameservers for you; its work is done. It doesn't need to redo this on
every boot.

I think you mentioned a while back you're with DSL Northwest. If this is 
still true, then you're putting too much emphasis in the Qwest part. 
DSLNW is your ISP. Call them and ask for your modem to be put into 
Bridged mode if that's what you want. Some ISP's are willing to do this 
(or even have this as the default) and some aren't. This will allow you 
to use your own router appliance or computer as your 
router/gateway/firewall. Qwest has nothing to do with this part. They 
only provide the copper. The ISP will provide the modem for whatever 
phone company the customer is with, but they have control over how the 
device configured.

Sorry if I'm not tracking, I didn't want to go read all history here.

Subject: [PLUG] FVX538 and IP assignments...
Message-ID: <1261966969.24185.28.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

The FVX538 has a DHCP server and it works okay, but the addressing
scheme is a random one.  Uge!  Is there any way to fix the IP 
addresses and still assign them from the FVX 538?  Can the FVX 538
support dynamic DNS updating so I can name the darn addresses 
regardless of what they happen to be at the moment?

I'm trying to use the FVX 538 in a different sort of way.  I 
DON'T want to access the Internet through it and I don't want 
to be able to.  I DO want to access the systems on it's private 
LAN and systems in private LANs connected via tunnel.  I am 
also trying to connect the FVX538's LAN to another LAN.  

I think I plugged into the wrong port choosing one of the LAN 
ports instead of the DMZ port, but maybe I didn't.  It seems 
that the DMZ is only intended for hosts which possibly serve 
the Internet that cannot go through NAT.  A downside of the 
DMZ on the FVX 538 is that networking between LAN and DMZ is 
blocked.

How does dynamic dns work?  Does the DHCP server send a MAC/IP 
address pair?  This is the information I need to assign the 
same name to the same computer regardless of the IP assignment 
if I write a program to generate the zone files.

Can the FVX 538 support assigning static routes to other private
networks via one of the statically configured hosts on the LAN 
segment?

I've tried google, but my situation doesn't seem to be covered.

Not to hijack the thread, but ... comcast and "best solution" don't
belong in the same sentence, at least not without an odd number of
emphatic negations.

I had one of those modems, and as I remember it the problem has
something to do with it trying to support ip6, and failing.  Turning
off ip6 support in linux was one solution.  A work around that I used
was just installing bind on my computer, setting resolve.conf to use
127.0.0.1 as my name server, and hard setting the DHCP client to not
use the DNS servers it got.  Though I think I had some problems with
roaming and needing to use the DNS servers at work that resolved names
local to the office.  If I was setting it up again today I would
probably make wpa_supplicant use a mapping to use different network
settings depending on what network it connected to.

Subject: [PLUG] Troubleshooting DHCP...
Message-ID: <1261976074.25196.15.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I'm trying to replace a 10BaseT DLink hub with a 100 Base TX DSS 5+
switch.  DHCP doesn't work anymore.

The server is on one end connected via an FA311 netgear card.  From
there, a 100' Cat5e cable runs to the switch in the attic.  Then I 
go to Cat5 STP cable for an additional 90' outside, underground,
and back above ground into the next building.  The diskless machine
that boots via floppy is on the far end.  A 190' run made up of a
100' and a 90' run seems to be within the range limitations for
100BaseTX.  Then again, the cable is shallowly buried and could
be getting weathered.

I see DHCPDISCOVER and DHCPOFFER, but nothing past that.

Dec 27 20:32:36 
goose dhcpd: DHCPDISCOVER from 00:02:e3:02:46:37 via eth2
Dec 27 20:32:36 
goose dhcpd: DHCPOFFER on 192.168.4.17 to 00:02:e3:02:46:37 via eth2

The other diskless machine on another nic off of the same server, dodo,
boots just fine by the way.  Is something obviously wrong in my dhcp
config file or am I looking at a problem with the switch?  DHCP worked
when I was using a 10BaseT hub which makes me wonder if the line can't
support 100baseTX.

Have you verified you have a solid link between switch and hub? Have you
verified the switch sees the hub at 10mb? Auto-negotiate can fail and at
times forced or turned off. Plenty of reasons why it might not work beyond
DHCP.

It could be a problem with autoconfiguring the speed, and duplex of
the connection.  I've had two switches decide on different modes, and
thus get a broken network.  When one side is a dumb 10 megabit hub it
doesn't try to negotiate, so you never have to worry about that
problem.  If you can force it into different modes try that.

I forced the server to half duplex using ethtool, but I can't force the 
client to go to half duplex.  Put the 10Mbit dumb hub back in, dhcp
worked like a charm and the machine network booted no problem.  I wonder
if being a switch it was blocking the dhcp replies?  I should in theory
be able to pull the hub and replace it with a crossover coupler.  I'm
starting to think that the switch I was trying to use is bad or maybe
I need a 100 megabit per second hub instead.  Thing is, I use another
DSS5+ switch with a linksys wireless WAP11 plugged into it that
configures via dhcp no problem.  I'm not sure what the issue is here.

Just to double check, 190' is within the range limitations for
100BaseTX, right?

Did you remake the initrd image?  

Depending on your settings it's possible the module is getting loaded by 
initrd before the normal module loading takes place.  This is more common with 
scsi modules but I've had it happen with ethernet cards on some distros that 
support running with root of an NFS server.

Yes, up to 300' in the accepted range. I don't think Daniel nor was I
referring to the client/server but the switch itself. Most switches are auto
sensing the link speed and do just fine, without knowing what kind of switch
it is and what capabilities it has, it's hard to say what count be causing
the problem. Could be VLAN's, could be auto sense not working, could be an
ACL .. but without knowing what hardware it is, hard to say.

Switches don't block broadcast protocols like DHCP. Routers do and if 
DHCP traffic
has to traverse a different network than a DHCP proxy must be configured.

However, there are a couple of cases where dhcp requests/replies could 
be inadvertently
blocked.

1. The DHCP client and dhcp server are on different VLANs.

2. Spanning Tree port configuration is another. With regular spanning 
tree (8021.d),
the switch port could be in blocking mode while the spanning tree is 
being mapped out and
therefore any DHCP traffic will not pass thru the port. As best practice 
we always
configured the switch ports with rapid spanning tree (802.1w), so that 
spanning tree convergence
happened faster and didn't impact dhcp requests.

No VLANS are in use.  I am running DHCP 3 server on CentOS 5.3 listening
on an actual Netgear FA311 network card with an actual Cat5e UTP cable
running 100' into the attic where at this point I go to a 10BaseT hub
and from there I continue on with a Cat5 STP cable outside, underground,
back above ground, and into another building where I terminate at
another FA311 network card in my diskless server.  I tried to replace
the Dlink hub with a Netgear DSS5+ 5 port switch.  I guess my switch is
faulty.  It seems unlikely that the cables themselves didn't handle
100BaseTX transmission okay.  Obviously there was some networking from
the diskless client to the server at 100BaseTX, but somehow the switch
broke DHCP.  Put the slow dumb hub back in, works just fine.  Trouble 
is, I want the higher speed because I'm extending with 802.11g outdoor
access points.  I'm thinking of getting a cable joiner that also acts
as a crossover device and using that instead of a hub or switch.

It is possible that the switch is faulty, however my experience with
auto-negotiation is that each vendor (hub, switch, network card)
interpret and implement the N-WAY standards differently.

Does the D-Link hub support auto-negotiation? That could explain why
the hub works and the switch doesn't. If the hub doesn't support 
auto-neg then
both ends of the connection will fall back to 10mbps half-dup and all is 
well.

If auto-negotiation isn't configured the same on both the switch port
and NIC then there will be duplex mismatch errors.

A telltale sign of duplex mismatch is Ethernet errors such as
Frame Check Sequence errors, late collisions, and runts.

You can use  the 'ethtool' command to look at Ethernet interface error 
counters.

Here are some steps to follow:

1. Boot from a linux CD (knoppix, finnux, etc).

2. Mount the root filesystem:

    cd /mnt
    mkdir sda3 (assuming this is name of your root partition)
    mount /dev/sda3 sda3

3. cd into the root filesystem mount point, and then mount the boot
    partition (if your /boot resides on its own partition):

    cd sda3
    mount /dev/sda1 boot

4. Just to be safe, mount /dev and /proc:

    mount -t proc none proc
    mount -o bind /dev dev

5. chroot into your root filesystem:

    chroot . /bin/bash
    source /etc/profile

6. Run the command "grub" to enter the interactive grub shell.

7. Once in the grub shell, type the following grub commands:

    root (hd0,0)
    setup (hd0)
    quit

8. Type "exit" to exit the chroot.

9. Unmount all mount points you have previously mounted:

    umount boot dev proc
    cd ..
    umount sda3

10. Reboot. Take the CD out. Enjoy!

I'm a new Subversion user, so be gentle.

OK.  In Subversion you can check out a bunch of files, which creates a 
working copy.

But I know you can also grab that same group of files without Subversion 
setting up the working copy, which is handy when you're releasing code 
from a tag and don't intend to ever, ever change it.  I've done it.  
I've found how to do it in the documentation.  It's probably dead 
simple.  But I can't find it!  Augh!

Any clues for the clueless?  I know I can just do a check out and 
manually delete Subversion's tracking files, but I'd really rather 
remember how to do it 'right'.

Thanks.

This is called doing an export of the code. So instead of doing an svn 
co you do an svn export.

Thanks.  I have no trouble with the hard parts -- it's the easy parts 
that trip me up.

While it was a simple question, I don't think it was a stupid one. If 
you don't know the term to describe something, that makes it a lot 
harder to find your answer online.

I'm a git newbie myself and I know I've asked a lot of questions like 
this to folks on IRC.

In my google search and a search of Netgear's web site I don't find a DSS5+5.
I do find a D-Link DSS5+5.

Also the link lights on the switch are for just one set of wires.  You
will need to check
the link status on both ends.

On a hunch after verifying that it still works when I use a 10Mbit hub,
I replaced the hub with a crossover coupler.  That is, I used something
that is almost equivalent to a 100Mbit hub with 2 ports.  It isn't
working where I'm seeing the same symptoms.

What could be making this work at 10Mbit but not at 100Mbit?  The first
line in the first building is 100' of Cat5e UTP cable, the second line
is 90' of at least Cat5 STP cable.

I'll have to check the lights on both ends.  It just seems odd, I have 
a Netgear FA311 nic on both ends so they should be able to talk to each
other.

I have a new Netgear switch, but I don't want to open it unless I can't
get this working.

I wish I had some way of verifying that the line can operate at 
100 Mbps.

I'm wondering if the Cat5 STP cable is having problems.

If I were working on this problem, the 1st thing I'd do is use the 
ethtool command
to look at the physical Ethernet statistics on both sides. If there's 
any problems at the physical layer
you'll see them reflected in error counters.

Trouble is, the other end doesn't boot if this doesn't work.  I was
seeing packet errors on the far end though before I tried to reformat
the etherboot disk.

So boot the other end, then switch the hardware.

  Can you boot that machine off a "Live" CD?  It would give you a lot
more tools to work with on that end.

I did something similar recently. Started by using xev to get the
scancodes, then used xmodmap to set keysyms. These exist for all of the
multimedia keys on my keyboard (e.g. XF86Mail, note these are arbitrary,
yhou can bind any key to them so for instance I've got the calculator
key bound to XF86Terminal). I then use xbindkeys to launch applications
on key press. Within that I use another package called xte to simulate
mouse events. This enables me to have the volume knob act as a scroll
wheel (for use with Ardour) but you might find it useful for the various
rocker/scroll switches if they aren't doing anything.

I have to give svn learnability points for `svn help` listing all of the 
possible commands (unlike `git help` which barely scratches the surface 
of what you see in `git-^I`.)

Message-ID: <da77481d0912282009n1a1c6b6ck94cb52eaa73dcff3@mail.gmail.com>

One of my daughter's has a Mac and it has a neat feature that allows her to
switch languages for her keyboard so she can type in Spanish in openoffice.
When she switches to Spanish, a nice keyboard map appears on the screen so
she can see where the special characters are located (i.e. the n-tilde is
right next to the L key). This does not switch all the menus etc to Spanish.
It just switches the keyboard to a Spanish keyboard. The display of the
Spanish keyboard on the screen is really important.

Is there a way to configure Debian so there is a little country flag in the
tool bar so I can switch my keyboard from English to German and get a small
keyboard map for the German keys?

Thanks!

Mark

Haw! Actually yes, if you use KDE. I'm sure GNOME has a locale
switcher too. Even XFCE4 might have something like that. It's been a
long time since I used anything so user-friendly though, so...

If you want to switch locales and keymaps the old-fashioned way (not
tested on debian):

1. Make sure glibc has support for the locales you need. Type "locale -a"
    to check. If not, add the locale to /etc/locale.gen (or debian
    equivalent), and then run locale-gen.

2. Once you see your desired locale in the output to "locale -a", set
    the following environment variables (this example is for German):

    LANG=german
    LC_CTYPE=de_DE.utf8
    LC_MESSAGES=de_DE.utf8
    LC_PAPER=de_DE.utf8
    GDM_LANG=de_DE.utf8

    I always use utf8 locales. You could use iso-8859-1 if you wish,
    but I don't recommend it.

3. Tell Xorg about your desired keymap. If you're using xorg-1.6 or
    higher, you'll need to set the keymap in your HAL policy file. My
    /etc/hal/fdi/policy/10-X11-input.fdi looks like the following:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <deviceinfo version="0.2">
        <device>
            <match key="info.capabilities" contains="input.keyboard">
                <merge key="input.x11_driver" type="string">evdev</merge>
                <merge key="input.auto.repeat" type="string">500 30</merge>
                <merge key="input.xkb.rules" type="string">xorg</merge>
                <merge key="input.xkb.model" type="string">pc102</merge>
                <merge key="input.xkb.layout" type="string">de</merge>
                <merge key="input.xkb.variant" type="string">nodeadkeys</merge>
                <!--<merge key="input.xkb.options" type="string">grp:alt_shift_toggle,grp_led:scroll</merge>-->
            </match>

            </match>
        </device>
    </deviceinfo>

    "input.xkb.options". This can be used to toggle between keymaps. I
    never use it, so my setup is incomplete for that purpose. You can
    google for this info.

    Also notice the option "input.xkb.variant". This turns off "dead
    keys". For Spanish, you probably do not want this line, since
    you'll need dead keys to do all those squiggly things over certain
    letters. Dead keys are when you type a tilde or backtick, and
    nothing appears. Then when you type the next key, it appears with a
    tilde or backtick over it. It's for characters that require two
    keystrokes.

4. Get a Spanish keyboard, or get a 102-key keyboard and some Spanish
    keyboard stickers. Actually I don't know whether you really need a
    102-key keyboard for Spanish. You do for German. Best to study a
    graphic of a Spanish layout closely.

I think #3 is really what you're after. You don't want all man pages
and every locale-aware program to start outputting in Spanish. You
just want to be able to type Spanish characters, oy?

For permanent setups, iIt is also a good idea to set the VGA console's
keymap. I have no idea how this is done in debian. In gentoo, you edit
the file /etc/conf.d/keymaps. It contains instructions in comments,
and is very easy.

I forget to say I use gnome. There must be a better way than fooling with
with the console to set this up?

Actually, I found the solution for gnome by looking through the menus,
except it does not paint a nice keyboard layout on the screen. Add the
keyboard-indicator to the gnome panel and then edit the keyboard preferences
to add a German/Spanish keyboard layout. No cute flags, just letters (USA,
DEU, etc) and no keyboard layout on screen. But close.

Thanks!

I think once you have the keyboard layout set, you just need to use
the assistive technology to get an onscreen keyboard. KDE and GNOME both
support this.

If you add the "Keyboard Indicator" applet to the GNOME panel, you can 
right-click on it and select "Show Current Layout". Is that what you're 
looking for?

I'm not sure if we have what you need, but go here:

http://ipa4linguists.pbworks.com/FrontPage

And check out Mapping Your Keyboard. There is a Linux link to
Tavultesoft.

Some of the other pages may be useful as well, as there are lots of
other ways to enter non-US-English characters without remapping your
keyboard.

I'm not sure if it is appropriate to post this here or not, but given the
current job shortages and that this is linux related I thought I would throw
it on the list.

http://www.google.com/support/jobs/bin/answer.py?answer=171451

The temp to hire is normal, everyone here went through it.

The posting pertains to OTA positions available but they are looking for a
OT2 aswell, which is a more technical (linux/scripting/hardware) position,
it's just not posted.

Feel free to ask me any questions you may have and no I am not a recruiter,
I am long time lurker and technician at the DC :)

There is a section in the general to build for memory limited systems.  This
should cut down on the size.

If you are doing nfsroot you could also boot this off the network.

1. Fan continuously runs
    - I did download some ibm-acpi fan util, but the fan continues to

2. The fan has become annoyingly loud.
    - Has anyone replaced the fan or taken apart the laptop to clean it

I don't know, has anyone?  ;)

Ok, more seriously, from a small sample of laptop repairs of various
makes I have to give IBM/Lenovo mad props for freakin' awesome repair
manuals available to everyone. Give it a search and you should easily
find it online.

Good luck!

I can't select my sound card in alsaconf because alsaconf doesn't 
list it even though I know I have a module for it.

I have a DR sound ISA sound card or I guess an OPTi931 sound card.

admin at condor:~$ ls alsa/
alsa-driver-1.0.9rc4a/         alsa-lib-1.0.9rc4.tar.bz2
alsa-driver-1.0.9rc4a.tar.bz2  alsa-utils-1.0.9rc4a/
alsa-lib-1.0.9rc4/             alsa-utils-1.0.9rc4a.tar.bz2

As you can see, I grabbed recent source code for ALSA.

I'm running a 2.6.10 kernel, have to because later kernels
don't work with my Quickcam color camera, the cheap one.

(CONFIGURE OPT0931/-1 (LD 0

As you can, the above piece of my isapnp.conf file suggests that
the card is an OPTi931 as well.

Is the driver for this sound card simply not functional or is there
a trick to get alsaconf to try it?

I'm also having trouble with alsamixer not working as the following
shows:

admin at condor:~$ alsamixer 

alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such file or
directory
admin at condor:~$ 

I have another similar computer that sports Monorail 3D audio which also
identifies as an OPTi931.

My T60 fan does run all the time (when it is not suspended).  But not
loudly .  According to gnome-sensors (in the panel) and ibm-acpi, the
fan is running at 3279rpm and the CPU is at 46C, the load average is
0.1 and the machine is idle except for this open xterm.

Not on the T60, but on older thinkpads.  This helps the fan work
more efficiently, hence slower.  And the cruft can also get in
the fan blades and make noise.  It may be possible to blow the
cruft out with compressed air - access is under the keyboard,
IIRC, you must remove that to blow the stuff out the side exhaust.

what driver are you using with it?  I'm hoping there is something
faster than the radeon driver...)

stp is actually more of a problem for long runs than utp is.  do you have 
the shield grounded at just one end?  if not, you could have a lovely 
ground loop going on.

I think 10Mbit ethernet requires 2pairs, 100mbit requires 4 pairs, perhaps
you broke a pair or two during installation.

See http://www.derose.net/steve/guides/wiring/#phone .

I used this guide to run reliable 10Mbit Ethernet and an analog phone line
through 8 pair Cat 3 buried under a driveway.  My run is only about 50 feet,
however.

10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX only require 2 pairs.  There was a version of 
100Mbit that required 4 pairs(100BASE-T4), but I believe it is 
obsolete.  Anyone still using 100BASE-T4 would almost certainly be 
aware of that fact.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_over_twisted_pair
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Ethernet#100BASE-T4

Gigabit ethernet(1000BASE-T) requires 4 pairs.

I believe the following may useful and/or interesting:

100BASE-CX (STP) is only spec'd for 25 meters (82 feet). (Same for
1000BASE-CX, 25 meters.)

100BASE-TX uses two pairs UTP, Cat5 or better, 100 meters.

1000BASE-T needs four pairs UTP, also Cat5 or better, 100 meters.

1000BASE-TX uses two pairs UTP but requires Cat6, 100 meters.

Note that most gigabit stuff is 1000BASE-T. I believe the original
plan was that two pairs would be cheaper than four but 1000BASE-T won
out due to compatibility with legacy wiring, which pretty much is four
pairs anyway.

In its typical configuration, 100BASE-TX uses one pair of twisted wires in each direction, providing 100 Mbit/s of throughput in each direction (full-duplex). Which means that the link could be good, but the cable wouldn't support full-duplex mode. So in theory the NIC might support full-duplex but the Ethernet cable w. a broken wire doesn't. And then you have a duplex mis-match between the 2 end devices. You drop in the 10-base-T hub, which most likely doesn't support auto-neg / full-duplex and it magically works. If I recall, the Orig Poster said he did see Ethernet errors...

I upgraded the oil to synthetic from sewing machine, as mama's sewing
machine oil is likely to be vegetable based and evaporate much faster than
synthetic.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux and driver blues...
Message-ID: <1262244382.3732.27.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I have qc-usb-0.6.6 source code from Sourceforge for my cheap web cam
and it works with the 2.6.10 kernel, but I don't think it works with any
later 2.6.x kernel.  On the ReactOS forums, it has been suggested that
Linux lacks a coherent driver model so that every driver has to be
ported every time a new kernel comes out.  Is this true?  It has been
suggested that Linux doesn't do well with proprietary drivers from one
kernel to the next.  I have yet to see ReactOS use anything that Linux
can't use without crashing, so maybe the ReactOS community is being a
bit premature to be knocking Linux.

On my PII system with the built in ISA sound card,
I found that turning the Monorail 3D Audio on causes Slackware to crash
during boot.  Turn the audio off in the bios, Slackware boots like a
charm.  Why did Monorail integrate junk into an otherwise decent Pentium
II motherboard?  Why didn't they integrate a standard sound blaster?

Where is the Linux kernel going in the future as far as drivers are
concerned?  It seems right now like a lot of stuff is broken.  I
hate to see stuff break between an old release in the current
stable kernel series and a newer release in that series.

I guess it is a lot to ask that someone fix the driver for an ISA sound
card since ISA has been gone a long time.

Concerning hardware not working with Linux.  Say I know an EE and know
about a business that could potentially make PCI cards.  Is it possible
to make say sound cards and release the design without defeating one's
opportunity to profit from the work?  Is releasing a hardware schematic
with the hardware under a license that says, "you are not permitted to
use these schematics to build the hardware without explicit permission
from the manufacturer," a reasonable way to do business?  If the
schematics to popular hardware exist and are free for the owners of said
hardware, someone will probably write a Linux driver for it.  For that
matter, someone may write a driver for Syllable, Haiku, Freedos,
etcetera.

Great link, Mike. :)  Man, this is _exactly_ what I've been wanting to find for the Free HW aspect of the global Free SW, HW Culture group, BerkeleyTIP.

All u free hw folks, come discuss this at this weekend's global meeting, via VOIP, Sunday Jan 3. Announcement to PLUG hopefully shortly, (ie as soon as I can create time.).

First, let me just say that I am as ignorant as anyone about the Linux 
Device Driver Model. So I
Googled and read this post
[http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/publications/linux-driver-model#Linux_Device_Driver_Model]
on the Linux Foundation web site. I would encourage you as well as the 
people on the ReactOS forums to
read it as well with the goal of being able to have intelligent and 
useful conversations regarding it...

Some key points:
"Linux today supports more hardware devices than any other operating 
system in the history of the world. It does this using a development 
model significantly different from the familiar Windows device driver 
model."

"The Linux driver model is different from the Windows model many IHVs 
are used to. But it is a consistent and compelling approach, and has 
been successful at supporting nearly the entire universe of computer 
hardware. Moreover, the vast majority of all IHVs have adapted to Linux 
and have thriving businesses that work with the Linux driver development 
model."

I've personally run into a driver issues with my ATI video card and 
Intel 3495 Wi-Fi chipset. Yes, it can be frustrating to have to compile 
drivers from source or go read threads and install different drivers, or 
try different hacks. I don't connect a lot of peripherals such as 
digital cameras, cell phones, iPod, PDA's, and such to my Linux laptop. 
I'm sure if I did there's a good chance I might be a bit more frustrated 
w. the lack of driver support for these types of consumer electronics 
devices.

Subject: [PLUG] Community Colocation Project?
Message-ID: <4B3CF1D0.7010809@gmail.com>

It's that time of year when I start to get all those crazy ideas for 
projects to take on in the
new year. When I lived in the Bay Area for a short time I discovered 
with much glee the
San Francisco Community Colocation Project [http://sfccp.net/node/1].

"It is a community-based provider of Internet connectivity services for 
non-profits, community groups and open source, free software 
initiatives. Our primary goals are to provide affordable connectivity 
and a space where online free speech and privacy are protected. Our 
'colo facility' provides proper mounting, power and internet uplink for 
rack-mounted servers that are required for hosting websites, e-mail, 
databases and other related technologies. These types of facilities are 
the backbone of the Internet."

I figure with Portland being the Open Source WHQ, an abundance of 
talent, lots of community-oriented folks, and small bizs / NFP's galore 
this is as good of place as any to try and follow SFCCP's lead. I know 
some good people who started small bizs last year and had to choke down 
the web site hosting costs. I'd love to be able to support new small 
bizs w. free web site hosting for 3, 6, 9, or 12 mths. That's 
potentially a few hundred $ that could be better utilized in getting the 
biz off the ground. And then hopefully the would become a "supporting" 
member and donate to the cause.

So, what do you say? Anyone interested in getting together and talking 
about this???

I've been using SpeakEasy DSL (with a static IP Address) for a few years
now.  Other than Verizon problems (but they were available on Quest at one
point as well), I've been okay.  It's been fairly reasonable for me at
around $60/month.

Robert,

   I've no idea what that package includes, but I've been an
Aracnet/SpiritOne customer for more than a decade now and recommend them
without reservation. For my DSL line, Verizon connection between here and
downtown Portland, and 2 domains (with a static IP address) I pay about
$30/month (paid annually). They host our Web site (and keep it secure) while
I host our mail server.

   The few times I've needed tech support they've been right on top of the
problem; they know linux since that's what they run. Their Admin is
outstanding.

   Other ISPs are good, too, but I know only Aracnet and have no desire to
change.

Rich

Thank you for the link, it was very informative.
I too am impressed for the most part by what Linux does support.
I especially found the get involved with LF if you are an IHV
interesting.

I've run hardware names through google adding Linux to 
to find out if it works over the years.

Hmm, interesting search results. I recently started using the
[http://www.google.com/linux] for any Linux oriented
searches.

The search results were mostly the same on the 1st page
with your way, which is how I used to do it too.

But even on the 2nd page the search results start to diverge greatly.
I think the search results stats below tell the story:

http://www.google.com/linux = Results 11 - 20 of about 20,300 for intel 3945
Google for "intel 3945 linux" = Results 11 - 20 of about 190,000 for 
intel 3945 linux

More search results means differences in ranking & relevancy...

I've been working on learning how to do Linux Device Driver
development so though I am not an expert I might be able to help with
some of these questions.

Because there became a USB standard for webcam interfaces most newer
webcams can just use a generic driver.  This killed most of the
incentive to write drivers for webcams because it was easier to just
go get a random new camera at the store than to spend many hours
figuring out how to reverse engineer the proprietary protocol of some
random old camera.  That said one person personally made Linux drivers
for over 100 webcams, but these never made it into the mainline kernel
because the code needed too much cleanup to be considered high enough
quality to be part of the official sources.  Ubuntu decided to add
them anyways for the sake of making peoples lives easier, but because
they didn't make it into the mainline kernel if some change upstream
broke a webcam driver it probably didn't get fixed.

I think I only ever saw one motherboard that included a sound blaster
on board.  I think it cost something like $700 when it came out in
1998.

ISA was always a mess as there is no way to safely, and consistently
verify that the card installed matches the driver you are trying to
use.  You pretty much have to manually configure it.  PCI, and USB
don't have this problem as the spec has a way to ask the hardware what
it is.

There is a open hardware project for graphics.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Graphics_Project

With graphics there is the additional problem of even if you design
the circuit board the chips themselves may not have documentation.

Though many electrical engineers could design a decent sound card.
There are many Digital signal processors, Analog to Digital, Digital
to Analog, and opamps on the the market.  Sound card driver problems
have more to do with the complexity of what they could potentially do.
 With many inputs, and outputs, digital encodings, and effects that
could be applied in a rats nest of patching inputs through effects,
and then to outputs.  It's getting there though.

Intel has been funding development of Linux drivers for most of their
products.  Wifi, Ethernet, Graphics, and USB.  The first USB 3.0
driver is the Linux one making it a major technology where Linux was
actually leading the way instead of playing catch up.  Written by
Portland resident, and intel employee Sarah Sharp.
