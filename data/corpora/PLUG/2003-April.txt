... Combined.

No problem. Hehe, that's why I pointed out that I use
tar to keep permissions. It actually does store the
user name and group name of the files in archives (not
UID and GID), and you can use the --same-owner and an
other couple of flags to extract the files exactly as
they were on the system that tarred it. Thus making
lots of fun is the user doesn't exist on your system.

Peace,
Vincent Damewood

Russell,

checking for GLIB - version >= 2.0.0...

  I had previously updated pkg-config and glib -- then ran /sbin/ldconfig.

  Several years ago I ran into this same problem trying to upgrade gtk+/glib
from source (because there wasn't a RH package for the newest version). Some
place on the system there's an environment variable, or old binary/library,
that doesn't get updated or erased when I 'make install' a new glib version.

  I searched my mail archives and partitions for this information but didn't
find it.

Wow, I didn't know that. So putting this all together, if I want to back
up a file-system to CD-R, I should tar it  first and then ?mkisofs? of
that one file and cdrecord it?

  I need a win98 printer driver for _any_ color, PostScript printer. I want
to print maps from my legacy, Windows GIS to a postscript file, then convert
them to pdf for inclusion with reports that are e-mailable. Doesn't matter
what printer it is since output is not to a physical device.

  If you know of a Web URL that holds this, please point me to one. Or, mail
me the driver you have. I've looked on the HP site but they make it very
difficult to find something that will work.

Has anyone been able to download the Redhat source RPM discs for Redhat 9 
yet?

Redhat network servers are pretty much unusable at this point.

I have the install discs, but I need the source RPMS.

Anyone?

Many of the Rawhide SRPMS match the version numbers of the Shrike binary
rpms...  that's not exactly an answer to your question but if you just
need a specific SRPM or two it may do the trick.

That has just the install ISOs.  (Unless there is another link I don't 
know of.)  

That is how I got the install discs.

Review man apt_preferences.  I've not tinkered with it much myself but
that man page outlines lots of cool options.  You need to create a file
called preferences in your /etc/apt directory.

At a small press conference in Nepal, attended by two Sherpas and a Yak, as

the Redmond company had acquired Linux.

http://www17.tomshardware.com/column/20030401/index.html


In a move that is bound to humiliate many people who take things too
seriously, Microsoft announced that it has purchased Linux today. When asked
for comment, Bill Gates was heard to say, "Now let's see them say something
bad about me on Slashdot."

Subject: [PLUG] Waking a sleeping hd?
Message-ID: <3E8A820E.7060306@pacifier.com>

How?

Got tired of the drone of the laptop's drive so I started playing with 
hdparm -y which reported that it was "issuing standby command" but there is 
no change in sound and an immediate query (-C) reports "active/idle"

So I issue 'hdparm -Y /dev/hda' and it goes to sleep, although
'hdparm -C /dev/hda' reports that the drive is in standby.  It's nice and 
quiet, but it won't wake up.  I can still use the machine for some things 
like this VNC session, but can't touch a file for instance.  (It's amazing 
the things I can do from cache w/o the drive running: cd, ls)

The man page claims that the IDE driver will automatically issue a reset 
when needed, but apparently not in my case.  Question: is there a way to do 
this manually?

I've disabled apmd since it was causing periodic dirt-naps.  I'm guessing 
it's a bios/hardware-specific issue.  Toshiba anyone?

After a couple of days of ripping MP3s at home, I turned to change disks
tonight and found:

Error Code 26
Error while locking file
Make sure the WAV amd MP3 dir paths are correct and that you have
permission...

I didn't change anything in the setup from the CD it just ripped.

I checked the ripperX page on sourceforge, no help. I checked for
unloved users on the system, none there. No folder size limitations on
the system. Moved the rest of the MP3s some place else, Re-pointed the
creation paths, all no help.

Even Googled the error code nomenclature.

It just now occurs to me that I ran up2date earlier today, but I'm sure
I've ripped a couple of CDs since then...

Mike

Any suggestions?

Kyle,

Here's the recipe I used with some success back when I was using IDE 
drives; I just had it tucked away in rc.local:

# hdparm magic:
# -c 1    = enable 32-bit i/o support
# -d 1    = enable dma transfers
# -k 1    = keep settings through resets
# -m 16   = set multiple-sector i/o
# -u 1    = set interrupt-unmask flag
# -S 241  = power back drives after 30 min of inactivity
/sbin/hdparm -c1 -d1 -k1 -m16 -u1 -S241 /dev/hda

I admin a list -- not PLUG but another non-profit organization -- that has
been majordomo for several years and is now mailman. I don't have much
experience with mailman and wanted to ask a few questions.

1. The list is an "announcement" list only. Before the moderators, which
were the only people who sent to the list, would put the following at the
top of messages:
Approved: password (where obviously password is the password of the list).
Then the moderator could send the announcement out.

2. Now, in mailman, I have set a couple of moderators. How do they send
out emails to the list?

3. What are some basic differences between the function of majordomo and
mailman?

I am going to read some documentation as well but I wanted to get some
feedback from people who have experience using one or both of these
programs. Thanks.

Neil

After you login to the admin page for your list, go to the Privacy 
options page. From there, scroll down to the 'General posting filters' 
section.

What you probably want to do is set things so that

* Must posts be approved by an administrator? == Yes
* Restrict posting privilege to list members? == No
* Addresses of members accepted == <list of accepted e-mail addresses>

I think that's the right recipe.

I think that's right, too.  I've found the best way to configure
mailman is to use the command line tool for outputting the config
for a particular mailing list because the comments inside are
more helpful than the web interface.

Have you tried upgrading to 2.1 yet?  I found the instructions
rather vague.

If members send to it everyone will unsubscribe becasue that will be way

I need to block members -- except moderators -- from sending any messages

su - mailman

./bin/config_list -o my.config listname

Use your favorite editor to find the following lines and read
the documentation for them:

moderated = 0

member_posting_only = 0

posters = [ 'me at home', 'myFriend at hisHouse']

./bin/config_list -i my.config listname

Now, only me at home and myFriend at hisHouse should be able to post, kind of
mimicking multiple moderators but without the explicit approval.

  If you cannot download the config file and work on it at home, ask them if
they'll mail it to you, then replace the mofified version.

The web interface and command line interfaces are identical in function
but usually named slightly differently.  I don't use the web interface
much, if at all, so I couldn't tell you exactly where it is...

Okay, log into the admin interface for the list.

Hi all,
?
I have to admit that I am a Microsoft Engineer, but I?m slowing getting over
it ;)
?
As we move away from M$ products into the Linux world we find ourselves
facing a bit of a dilemma. I am hoping that one of you kind people can point
us in the proper direction to resolve the situation.
?
We have a Redhat 8 box residing in a DMZ that we intend to utilize as an
anti-spam relay/gateway into a secure Exchange server. Sendmail is running
smoothly and SpamAssassin appears to be properly analyzing and tagging
inbound messages. Our concern is that when we place a .forward file in the
users? home directory, messages are forwarded into the Exchange box without
being processed by SpamAssassin.
?
How might this situation be remedied so that inbound messages are analyzed
by SpamAssassin prior to being forwarded to Exchange?
?
Regards and thanks in advance for any assistance.
?
Russ

hmm, I don't know the answer to the spam assassin question.  But have you 
considered using the /etc/mail/aliases file instead of .forward files?  
Especially if this is a DMZ box.  You probably don't want to have a lot of 
user accounts on the box.

Have you considered postfix instead of sendmail (two bugs in one month, 
grumble, grumble)?  

There is a howto for what your trying to do using postfix instead at
http://postfix.state-of-mind.de/patrick.koetter/mailrelay/

You can call SpamAssassin during the SMTP-negotiation phase using 
MIMEDefang in combination with sendmail's milter interface.

* MIMEDefang: http://www.roaringpenguin.com/mimedefang/
* Nice HOWTO: http://www.rudolphtire.com/mimedefang-howto/

You can ignore the stuff in the HOWTO about building sendmail with 
libmilter enabled; Red Hat does that for you.

Using this technique, SpamAssassin gets called before inbound messages
get passed off to a local delivery agent.

If users do their forwarding with a ~/.procmailrc file instead of a
~/.forward file, then fowarding will happen after the message has
been processed by any system-wide filters. The user's ~/.procmail 
file would look like this:

   :0
   ! user at somewhere-else.com

The trick is to make sure that the global procmail file (/etc/procmailrc)
never saves email to $DEFAULT, thus bypassing the user's procmailrc
file. Instead the global file must allow all "good" mail to fall through 
to the end, in which case the user's procmail file will take over and
handle final delivery.

Nice.  Would be a great signature block.

There was a couple of threads about this on the Spamassassin list.  I 
think they were completely bypassing any need for forwards.  The 
Spamassassin box accepted mail for the domain, processed it then passed it 
onto the exchange server.
   The Spammassassin-talk list is hosted at sourceforge.  I'd hope a quick 
search would turn up the thread(s).

I've found that

  DEFAULT="! user at somewhere-else.com"

also works nicely.  And then you can be SURE that it *does* save
mail to DEFAULT. :)

(I might be slightly off on the syntax... maybe you don't
need the !)

I don't think that's quite it, but I believe there is a syntax for setting 
a forwarding DEFAULT. The problem is that it doesn't do much good in the 
system-wide /etc/procmailrc file where you don't know where each user 
wants their mail forwarded. In order to do what the user really wants 
(forwarding, sorting mail in to different folders, whatever) you have to 
fall-through to the end of /etc/procmailrc so that the user's 
~/.procmailrc can take over. This can be a real pain to do in procmailrc
syntax. In my view this is a flaw in procmail. There should be a feature 
like this: 

   :0
   $FALLTHROUGH

This would cause the remainder of /etc/procmailrc to be skipped and
processing would pick up with the user's ~/.procmailrc file.

Terry,

  The message was ambiguous. It took me quite a while to understand it. When
I read that RH is stopping errata support for 6.2 and 7, but one could get
upgrades to 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 8.0 and 9.0 I realized that the '7' meant 7.0,
not 7.x

  If you're administering a 7.x where x > 0 then you're OK. Or, like me, you
could start thinking about switching to another distribution. :-) Only when
it's time to do an major upgrade, of course.

According to this page (http://www.redhat.com/apps/support/errata/) all versions of RH 7.1 through 8.0 don't EOL until 12/31/2003. 

So you have at least 7 months or so before they quit making updates. 

Maybe by then, Apache 2.0 will be usable.

This was, indeed, a useful description.  Now the hard question.

Can anyone surmise what consequences I might face if I try to 
update a 7.2 system to this 9.0?

I feel like I should have the "latest", but I don't want to spend the next
week undoing/fixing things so they work again...

Don't know what exactly I'm worried about, but always a little nervous
about such a big jump...

Message-ID: <1049338828.3060.26.camel@sparticus.coopnkass.com>

Friends,

I've just returned from the capitol building. I first met with Rep.
Kitts (R) regarding this bill. He indicated the following:

  * IT certainly has taken it "in the chin" during this economic
downturn

  * We need to do more to help the IT community in Oregon beyond R & D
tax credits

  * He looks forward to hearing my testimony tomorrow morning

Our meeting was brief. If any of you know an Intel representative who is
at liberty to discuss this bill, please have them give Rep. Kitts a call
as Intel is in his district; I understand that Intel is officially
neutral on this issue.

Secondly, the Department of Administrative Services will testify in
favor of this bill. This testimony will prove very valuable as they are
prepared to shed light on savings, enhanced functionality, and reduced
vendor dependence by using Open Source Software.

Finally, I am told that the Business Software alliance _will_ be
testifying in opposition of this bill. If some of you could do some
research on the BSA and send me links of articles outlining their
practices, motivation and case history I would be very great full. This
will give me more time to coordinate our efforts without needing to
worry so much about theirs.

I will be working late into the night preparing for tomorrow morning's
hearing. I will keep you updated as I know more.


Sincerely,

Terry,

  This lets me raise the concern I had when I read the e-mail this morning.

  Based on Red Hat's lumping 7.0 with 6.2 suggests to me that there were
_major_ changes from 7.0 to 7.1. And, that the releases from 7.1 forward are
similar enough to be supportable through the end of this year.

  So, my question is whether an upgrade of all your boxes to 7.1, .2, or .3
would be equally as painful as an upgrade to 8.0 or 9.0. And, if the changes
between 7.0 and 7.1 were so significant, why didn't they warrant a major
number change rather than a minor number change?

I updated from 7.0 to 7.2 using apt-get, there was very little work

Well, this isn't the discussion I wanted to have, but here's the history
as I understand it.

7.0 was going to be the first system with a 2.4 kernel, but 2.4 took a lot 
longer than expected, so 7.0 had a 2.2 kernel and 7.1 was the first to
have a 2.4 kernel. That's the split between 7.0 and 7.1.

The reason that 7.1 was not called 8.0 was because it was binary compatible
at the application layer. The kernel version generally does not impact binary
compatibility, except for really big things like the transition from a.out to
ELF.

Red Hat's pattern until now was to roll the major number when there was
something that broke binary compatibility, usually something very basic like
a new version of glibc, gcc, or both.

As for upgrading my boxes. It would just be a big pain in the backside
irrespective of the size of the leap, and for no good reason other than to
follow with along with Red Hat's grand plan for making money from bug
fixes. These boxes are all doing their respective jobs perfectly well.
Taking them out of service for upgrades makes no sense if I can avoid it.

Terry

I think the RH plan is that servers run the "enterprise" versions. 
http://www.redhat.com/software/rhel/
Now that they've introduced binary incomparability with their "desktop"
version, it makes marketing sense.

So what makes Linux enterprise, other than a company wanting to sell it for a
few hundred dollars? The kernel; the tools; the file structure; or is it the
five year, "we will support it" policy? 

RH is now pointy hair compatible and will be sporting the PH logo on the new
releases.  
 /\	   /\  (TM)
/  \----/  \

Be sure to act now to reserve your place in a RHPH certificate program.

Thank you

a few hundred dollars? did mine ears deceive me?

You are off by an order of magnitude...

Yes, that's right, Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS runs for, take a deep
breath, $1500. Or $2500 for the "premium" version.

And even the "standard" version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES is a
killer: $800.

Only when you get down to the "basic" version, or the client versions,
do you find prices in the "couple hundred bucks" range.

They've had a enterprise version at least since 6.2, never seemed to catch 
on though.  It included some commercial apps.

As a long-time RH user, I'm dismayed.  However it will be interesting to see 
if this works for them.  Whatever the price for their enterprise version, 
it's cheap if I'm an enterprise.

As a hobbist, I probably upgrade every 1-2 years anyway.  Not a biggie, but 
the forced obselence does sting a little.

Hey, if it flops, seems like RH knows how to adapt and would support the 
trailer park versions longer.  But if it does flop, that won't bode well for 
Linux in general.  No matter if you like RH or not, this is the Linux acid test.

*IF* I understand the changes correctly, then an update will work,
*ONLY* if most (all?) of your installed software is replaced with newly
recompiled versions that work with the new threading model. 

Redhat has made a VERY large departure from previous versions with this
release. Almost nothing from previous releases will work with this
release. Hense, that's why they are sunsetting all previous versions at
the end of this year. It would be a major pain for them to maintain two
code bases. 

It will be interesting to see if this gamble on their part pays off. At
this point, my servers are running RH 7.3, and my workstation is running
Mandrake 9.1. 

I have no short term plans to upgrade my servers, as RH still does not
offer all the functionality in 9.0 that's available with 7.3. Apache 1.3
is (as of this writing) much more extended than Apache 2.0.

I can't justify upgrading until Apache 2.0 supports most everything
Apache 1.3 does.

I like having the latest too, but that has to be balanced against
usability. 

> Don't know what exactly I'm worried about, but always a little nervous
> about such a big jump...

Especially since what they changed effectively breaks many things.
Recompiling lots of software will take a long time. If you run any
commercial software (closed source) I can almost guarentee it'll need
to be recompiled for the new system. 

Now, I could be WAY off base here, but what I'm relaying here is what
I'm hearing from many early adopters.

All this talk of EOLing software bugs me. I have a set of perfectly
good reasonably well working RH7.2 systems. I really don't want to be
constantly upgrading entire systems -- that's one of the reasons I
stopped having any thing to do with RedmondSoftware. What is anybody's
preference for a distro that doesn't seem to have this particular
"Feature".

Other than the apt-get feature of Debian, and the fact that it's
layout on the FS is way different than what I'm used to on RedHat...

How do distro's stack up regarding ease of upgrade. I'm starting to
think LFS is a better solution!

Subject: [PLUG] modem access restrictions
Message-ID: <20030403000344.E26214@defiant.ncplus.net>

Howdy!

My neighbor and I are sharing a fone line / modem access to the
internet (at 28.8k max d/l speed). The modem is on my linux system,
and he's connected to it thru a cat6 cable. He's paying for the fone
line, and we're using my system as a firewall. He does alot of wget
lookups after he goes to bed, which is 4 hours before I go to work. I
haven't been able to get him to put his wget tasks on a cron to run
after 1am when I go to work.

I tried to setup a throttle function, to limit his consuming of
bandwidth during the evening hours when I try to use the system. He
responede by seting up his own tools to essentially bypass my limiter.

So, now I'm thinking of building a script that I'd run when I'm on the
system, that will disable his ability to 'see' the modem temporarily,
until I run it again and 'normal' settings are restored. Any ideas on
simple but effective 'fixes'?

Thanx!

 Error 778
Message-ID: <EX-20030327-102150-0005@exchange.fiserv-missive1.fiserv.net>

DAve,

IPSEC client software tends to be very specific to the vendor for example Checkpoint's client (http://www.checkpoint.com) will not play nice with Cisco (http://www.cisco.com) same with Netscreen, etc. With the exception of Cisco this is because of the way the clients are for example Free S/wan can talk nicely to Checkpoint and that is what I do. :) IPSEC is *the* standard it is what all the big boys use it is what security auditors look for it is tested and secure as opposed to PPTP which is, of course, not. 

This is why is seemed so odd to me that you where talking about PPTP to a firewall/vpn box simply because the only people who use PPTP are people who are trying to use something MSian for a firewall/vpn box. So as far as getting winders to talk to PPTP on a non-winders vpn box I am sorry but I got nothing. It looks to me like Astaro has a client (http://www.astaro.com/php/statics.php?action=remoteipsec&lang=gb) and if I had decided that I like them enough to deploy them. And as an aside I *really* hope you are not going with them just because the OS that their stuff runs on happens to be Linux and they do look interesting I'm certainly going to read more. I would use their client. In general the best client to use for any given VPN box is the client that that box comes with. This is true for a number of reasons. 

1. You are not going to run into nearly as many *weird* problems. 

2. While all the vendors out there claim to be IPSEC they are all really IPSEC plus. If there is an expection to this rule I have yet to find it. Therefore with the clients you get goodies like being able to enforce "security policies" for example with the Checkpoint client we cut off all traffic to anybody except us when the VPN is on. Various things like that.

Ray,

    The Linux server is a firewall running Astaro Security Linux - which
is a very refined, cut down Debian variant.  (Well, there actually isn't
much Debian left.)  Astaro is a large firewall distribution, a bit
like Smoothwall, but much better and much more expensive.  It includes
packet filters, proxy servers, virus scans, IPSEC VPN, PPTP VPN, decent
reporting functions, etc.  Unneeded services have been removed to the
point that there are only about 100 commands left.  Most services run
in chroot jails.  It is pretty nice.

    My client wants to support a variety of Windows clients on the
VPN including Win 98, Win ME, Win 2000, and Win XP.  However, most of
the clients are Win 2000 or Win XP.  I have recommended getting IPSEC
client software for all the PCs or possibly using the IPSEC that
comes with Win 2000 and Win XP, but my client is reluctant to switch
from PPTP for a number of very good reasons.  At this point, it looks
like we will install PPTP and gradually migrate to IPSEC - which of
course is much better for several reasons - like it is relatively secure
and PPTP is not.

    In any case, what IPSEC client software do you normally recommend on:

                 Win 98
                 Win ME
                 Win 2000
                 Win XP

Do you recommend MicroSoft's IPSEC on Win 2000 and/or Win XP or do you
recommend something like SSH Sentinel or is there something more
OpenSource than this?

                                                     Dave Mandel

Well thanks for all pointing this out, but it doesn't do me one

Wow, sounds like a disfunctional relationship.  I'd pull his line.  It's not 
the programatic answer you're looking for, but is completely un-bypassable.

What's his interface to your modem--serial port?  nic?  Either should be 
easy enough to make disappear if shear reason fails.

My first disc 1 was bad, it would skip one of the Xfree86 RPMs.
Regenerated disc 1 and everything is fine. I did NOT have to select
auto update during the install. So far so good on 5 machines.

I don't think that's quite it, but I believe there is a syntax for setting
a forwarding DEFAULT. The problem is that it doesn't do much good in the
system-wide /etc/procmailrc file where you don't know where each user
wants their mail forwarded. In order to do what the user really wants
(forwarding, sorting mail in to different folders, whatever) you have to
fall-through to the end of /etc/procmailrc so that the user's
~/.procmailrc can take over. This can be a real pain to do in procmailrc
syntax. In my view this is a flaw in procmail. There should be a feature
like this:

   :0
   $FALLTHROUGH

This would cause the remainder of /etc/procmailrc to be skipped and
processing would pick up with the user's ~/.procmailrc file.

"Forced"? There's nothing forced here. It simply means that Red Hat 
will no longer be paying people to do work that the rest of us get for 
free.

I just don't get the griping. Red Hat has to pay its developers, and 
to do so, it's got to make a profit. Does anyone seriously expect that 
Red Hat can maintain long-term support of older distributions that 
generate no income?

If it's in your interest to maintain an older version of Red Hat 
Linux, then grab the source packages and keep up with the security 
patches. No one is forcing anyone to upgrade. If you're willing to put 
in the work, Red Hat 6.x and 7.0 can be kept running for years to 
come.

Red Hat is merely saying that it's working on other projects now --
projects that allow many kernel and application developers to do
trivial things like eat and pay their mortgages.

                        Aspire to Crudeness -- Issue 37

  April 3, 2003

     _________________________________________________________________

   First of all, some of you wrote nice letters to economist Peter
   Passell, inspired by his "Why Open Source Stifles Innovation" article
   that I replied to in the last ATC. Here's one that Michael Bacarella
   sent:

     One mistake that is very commonly made in discussions of the
     software industry is the extension of shrinkwrap software
     development to encompass the entire industry.

     Shrinkwrap software just does not matter. Or if it does, it's
     nothing worth discussing. There are few vendors that can make money
     at it, and it's basically because they have a monopoly. Anyone else
     is selling a gimmick or entertainment content.

     Many believe people who write code spend their time developing
     shrinkwrap software. This is a myth; these developers are in the
     minority. Scan the help-wanted section, and you'll find that 95-99%
     of the ads for programmers are NOT to work on shrinkwrap software.
     Few of the people who do work on shrinkwrap software, consequently,
     ever contribute to free software. That's because free software is
     very tightly associated with custom software systems, not
     shrinkwrap software.

     Companies don't hire programmers to develop shrinkwrap building
     blocks; they're hired because they have (or soon hope to have) a
     ton of information and need to have it processed in a way that is
     unique to their individual business. Shrinkwrap software just
     cannot address this need.

     Some traits typical of custom software systems:

     * One or very few buyers.
     * The buyer often has nothing to do with software industry or even
       IT in general.
     * The buyer is uninterested in reselling the software system;
       they're not shrinkwrap software vendors, they don't know how to
       market it, and it's really not the best use of their time to try.
     * The buyer pays for on-going maintenance, support and enhancement
       of their custom developed system.
     * Competitors do not gain a significant edge if they obtain this
       software. Custom systems are just that, custom--crafted to each
       company's unique needs.

     Of these projects (which far outnumber shrinkwrap software
     projects), items like software licensing are rather irrelevant to
     the bottom line. What is relevant though is if the buyer can find
     ways to decrease their costs ("transaction costs" is a nice way to
     put it, kudos). Additionally, the buyer does not want to depend on
     the developer indefinitely (hit-by-a-bus principle). This situation
     has GPL written all over it.

     For the custom software developer, the GPL is a warm hug of
     industry cooperation. The feeling that you are going out into the
     world not alone, but with the support of your peers. Only this is
     not forced by gunpoint (which is required to be pinko-commie), but
     agreed to by all involved parties in an unspoken way for the
     purposes of mutual gain. It's very much a trade association, but it
     takes so long to realize that it's far more useful than any
     "official" trade association can be. And all you have to do is
     contribute back, which as we know, can have substantial positive
     effects (adoration of peers, bugfixes, etc.).

     Seems pretty pro-business to me.

  NVIDIA

   Some NVIDIA folks called to boast they're offering a whole separate
   software update and dependency tracking infrastructure to keep their
   proprietary driver stuff up to date--like I'm supposed to thank them
   for a workaround for their own pigheadness.

   Basically, the problem is this: they don't want to publish source for
   a driver because they think they're more likely to get sued for patent
   infringement. This is probably true; there are certainly enough bogus
   software patents out there.

   So, there's something lurking beneath the surface of the proprietary
   binary-only NVIDIA driver that's raw meat for a patent lawyer. The
   fact they release binary-only will slow the lawyers down, but not stop
   them. I wonder which company will try first. Hey! Lawyers! Deep
   pockets! Go get'em!

   One other interesting point about the whole binary-only modules thing
   is the easiest way for the Forces of Evil to subvert Linux security
   would be to distribute a proprietary kernel module to make /dev/random
   a little less random--not enough so you would notice in daily use, but
   enough to make crypto apps use keys just weak enough for the NSA to
   crack.

Technical quibbling, but to be clear RH pays it's developers out of income not 
profit. Profit is revenue minus expenses and the developers are expenses. With 
$300 Million in reserves (last i checked) RH can get by indefinitely without 
profit.

They do need to generate income, though, like you said, and otherwise i agree 
with your line of reasoning.

  I just received an e-mail, supposedly from M$ and addressed to "M$ user".
It contains an .exe attachment that is supposed to completely patch all
previous, current and future vulnerabilities in Outrage, Lookout Express,
Word, Excel, and whatever. They even provide URLs with "microsoft" in them
for warm fuzzies.

  The headers reveal that the message came from a server in Israel, so I
forwarded the message to their "abuse at ..." address.

  If any of you are interested in seeing a copy -- and/or playing with the
attachment -- I'll forward it to you. I strongly suspect that the gullible
who blithly run the executable will find their system compromised in one or
more ways.

Yes, but the counter argument is that Red Hat, in dropping support for 
these versions that are still in fairly wide use (well, not 6.2 probably, 
but certainly 7.0) is that they are contributing to a less secure 
Internet. While it's certainly still possible to apply the lastest patches 
as you described, it's also more difficult. Some less disciplined, less 
skilled, or resource constrained system admins will just give up. For the 
most part these sys admins are just hurting themselves, but they are also 
hurting the rest of us by providing platforms for worms to advance 
themselves etc.

And from here on out it just gets worse, as cash-strapped businesses, 
governments, and non-profits continue to use the basic Red Hat edition on 
their servers. A year after initial release Red Hat will stop providing 
security updates for the basic edition. Are all those servers going to get 
upgraded yearly in order to remain secure? Not likely.

My view is that Red Hat should continue to provide security fixes for
the typical life cycle of the hardware on which the OS runs. One year
is just *way* too short. A year is nothing. I've got uptimes longer than 
that.

A google search on Stefania Casalegno turns up many hardcore-porn links. It 
would be nice to give some warning when posting a link as nasty as the one in 
your post.

I have grown quite fond of Spamcop and 
news.admin.net-abuse.email. The subject line is puzzling, I wonder if someone 
is misusing your email address- could it be the spammer "Stefania Casalegno" 
uses spam filtering? Or it's a tactic to get you to read the spam.

Here is what Spamcop says, as you can see the originating IP is an open proxy,

You're right, it looks like an attention-getting ploy. I don't get why pr0n 
sites need to spam, isn't that something people go out of their way to find?

But there are so many of them...  Have to get people to your site somehow.

I got the same spam.  I deleted it after seeing the web site link.  Pretty 
obvious what it was.

I get all sorts of spam with various misleading headers all the time.  I 
just delete them and go on with my life.

Unfortunatly, most of the legal solutions that have been proposed have had 
some nasty side effects that are worse than the spam.  It is what happens 
when you get people who do not understand something trying to make rules 
about it.

According to another page on the same site, there is a bill with similar

Senator Starr.  The web page listing the "Super-DMCA" bills that are being 
considered or have already passed in state legislatures is

http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/superdmca.html

and the text of SB 655 is available at

http://www.leg.state.or.us/03reg/measures/sb0600.dir/sb0655.intro.html

I haven't read the bill but it could be worthwhile to muster some resistance.  
I am mostly worthless on this account since I just moved to the state but the 
very admirable support that HB 2892 is getting leads me to believe that the 
Open Source community here is a political force to be reckonned with.

There's so much competition.  They need to stand out from all the rest.  
I mean, I'd never heard of suicidegirls.com (don't click now) until WillieWeek

I could do that, but the natural progression from there is a place I
don't want to go at the moment. Since I can't get him to think outside
of his box, I need him to see real thruput when he's at the keyboard
(and I'm either asleep or at work) and for me to see real thruput (at
his lack thereof) when I'm at the keyboard and he's asleep.

nic. I could change the ip of the box it's on, but then I'd have to
change the references to it in my workstation too. I was hoping for a
clever iptables command, or somesuch. I know what the ip's are of his
workstations.

Run a "ps auwx | grep ppp" and see what is launching ppp.  From there you 
should be able to see where the dial script is coming from.  (There are a 
bunch of ways to start ppp.  Some easier to identify than others.)

I might be misunderstanding your question, but I'll give it a shot anyway.

 

If you want to change the number people dial to gain access to your company
network (and from there, to the Internet), there should be no change at all
needed on the server's config files. The place where changes are needed is
on the client side. Are your employees all calling from home with Linux
machines, or some other OS?

 

Instead of plugging the modem into the telephone patch-panel jack for the
phone number 555-1212, just move it over to the patch panel jack for the
number 555-1215, for example. If you have a PBX or some other switch-board
beyond just a jack for each phone line, things get more complicated and
you'll need to check with someone who understands your particular phone
system. I've worked with a couple of small PBX systems and I can tell you
that every brand is different.

If I remember correctly, those data are usually set in a file named

  Darn! I had the same problem with the computer I bought from Carla. You
use "c" at the grub prompt to get to the command line then ... I no longer
have the details.

  In essence you need to get to a boot prompt then edit /etc/shadow to erase
root's password (I think that's the second field).

  Perhaps Carla remembers the details. I don't have them written down
because -- for reasons neither of us could explain -- it just would not work
for me. Sigh.

Who summoneth me?  <brimstone puff>

It's a lot of steps, and it works for everyone but Rich. This is how to 
recover a root password in Debian, without a rescue disk. Having a rescue 
disk is better. Hopefully your filepaths are not too different:

As regular user, open /boot/grub/menu.lst and 
write it down, you want the kernel and root lines. Don't use mine. If you 
can't log in at all, and don't know to use GRUB to figure out your kernel and 
root lines, let me know:

## ## End Default Options ##

title           Libranet GNU/Linux, kernel 2.4.19
root  (hd0,2)
kernel  /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.19 root=/dev/hda3 ro

restart machine, when Grub menu appears hit 'c' to get the command prompt
type the root line as you copied it and hit return
type  the kernel line as you copied it, then add this to the end:

init=/bin/bash

and hit return
type boot and hit return

It will boot normally and stop at a command prompt, and will not ask for a 
login. Remount in readwrite:

# mount -o remount,rw /

Using your fave editor, open /etc/shadow. At the top is the line for root's 
hashed password.

root:$1$uz4Kua9u$D/5ySgWS19.dNjNMlRnRO.:12037:0:99999:7:::

Delete the bit between the first set of colons:

root::12037:0:99999:7:::

Now, remount as read-only:

# mount -o remount,ro /

Now sync the filesystem:

# sync;sync;sleep 10;sync;mount -o remount,ro /

Restart init:

# exec /sbin/init

Now when you log in as root, it will not ask for a password.

Slick n quick! Have fun!

Isn't it 'e' at the prompt? Anyway you need to start up in single user
mode (run level 1?) and then use passwd root to set the password.

I would think that the username and passwd are on the box itself. Look
in the /home directory for current users.

To change passwords, do "passwd user", and it will ask you for a
new pass.

To add new users, do "adduser" and fill in the blanks.

The funny thing about the Internet, is that you find pr0n when you really

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0304031854300.5867-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I think that I shot myself in the foot: on the new notebook installation
(slackware-8.1) I had not yet set an alias for 'rm' to be 'rm -i'.
Naturally, the keyboard layout is different on the notebook than on the
workstations.

  So, I go to remove /etc/*~ and my little finger hits the [Enter] key
rather than the tilde. Ker-chunk! All gone. And, unrecoverable. Sigh.

  Well, I _was_ going to upgrade to 9.0 anyway, but this is a bit sooner
than planned. My question to you SysAdmins is this: without /etc/fstab will
I have to repartition the hard drive or will fdisk keep the information and
let the system recreate /etc/fstab?

Thanks,

Rich

I'm glad you brought this up--I read that in the article, but it
handn't sunk down to the reality of all my hand-built software...
You know--somethings are standard in distributions, so you build
it yourself, and /usr/local grows....   I see now that all of this
would have to be redone.

Maybe it's not that urgent after all...

  Well, ... yes. All the config files are gone. I'll see if the upgrade
replaces them all, then I can re-figure out what needs to be done manually.

  Now I know: first thing to do is make an alias for 'rm -i'.

...it probably is better than building your own neural net.. Bayesian
nets (especially if you can build a naive bayes on top of some
informed network) usually kick ass compared to other off-the shelf
learning algorithms. 

Spam also has so many unrealted traits (which is why
spamc/spamassassin work) that even naive bayes nets will do a very
good job compared to many more complex methods (neural nets being just
one example).

I haven't experimented with spam filtering algo's myself
though.. personally I'm more into music classification, but the same
theory applies.

Some years ago, I was having trouble getting linux installed. I forget
what distro it was. A young guru (very smart kid) insisted that debian
would solve all my problems. So, I got the 4 CD set and installed it.
Just as broke as previous attempts, and none of the helps available
anywhere I could find provided any suggestions as to what was what.
Nothing that I read matched anything on the debian fs layout, and I
got really frustrated with it. So, for a really long time, I wanted
nothing to do with it. And more recently, when I ask a question, and
get an answer like "just use apt-get ####", I tend to stay frustrated.
Usually when I ask a question, I want enough data to know _why_
something works a particular way, not just that it works.

That said, I might consider debian now, but I have alot more
experience with the "standard file system" that the rest of the
community proposed some while back; and I'm not sure that debian
follows that. If I really end up with a completely new approach, then
debian is as good as any other (just as much work to re-learn). There
are certainly many good things about debian; and I really don't know
all that much about it. It's just enough different from a RH system,
that cluttering my mind with inappropriate data has been something
I've avoided. Now that I'm considering a different approach... that
data isn't so inappropriate.

> (fwiw, redhat is standardizing the filesystem layout in the newer
> versions, so that may be somewhat unavoidable.)

I think a standard fs layout is very useful. It's also handy for
knowing where to find certain tools and to know what is a system tool
and what is a user tool, and what tools are critical, etc.

The problem I'm having is that when I finally get tired of a missing
feature in the word processor or the spreadsheet, I go out to the web
to see if an upgrade is available. I find that there is, but that the
tools required are not part of the distro I have, so then I have to
upgrade abunch of stuff. The RPM doesn't work because it depends on
some file I don't have, but fails to tell me what I need to get to fix
that. So, I end up downloading source, and recompiling to run on the
system that I have. Then I find that I can't get there from here
because I'm still on a two year old kernel, which won't work with the
new files. The chicken and the egg continue to fight!

So, I'm looking to get away from RPM's and maybe avoid apt-get for the
same reason, and build a system that can be upgraded more sanely. I
like the argument for slackware that was posted earlier. And Jeme was
promoting LFS as a completely distro independent solution last year;
which at this point could be very appealing!

At this particular moment, I'm just trying to gather some level of
intelligent info on the choices, and the experiences of the group,
that help me make a decision that isn't just a different path thru the
same garden.

Thanx!

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0304040652110.13576-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I am learning more than I ever wanted to learn about the importance of
files in /etc. I have really outdone myself this time and I don't know how
to recover the system.

  When I went to reboot my Toshiba Portege last evening to re-install the OS
(I inadvertently deleted all of /etc becuse I hit the [Enter] key before the
~ key) it stopped part-way through the process. Here's what the screen
shows:

	The system is going down for reboot NOW!
	INIT: Switching to runlevel: 6
	INIT: No inittab file found
	INIT: Sending processes the TERM signal
	INIT: Sending processes the KILL signal
	INIT: No more processes left in this runlevel

and there it stays. Keypresses produce only their ANSI codes on screen. When
I power off, then power on again, the system doesn't do a POST, then look in
the attached floppy drive for the boot floppy. It just restores the state it
was in when shut down.

  I tried holding down the [Esc] key while powering on, but that made no
difference. I was trying to get to setup so I could turn off the auto-start
feature. Removing the pcmcia card attached to the cdrom drive produces a
beep; reinserting the card produces another beep and the drive spins before
again becoming comatose.

  I'm stuck in mud over the wheels on this and I need some expertise to pull
me out.

TIA,

If your computer doesn't post, like you say, then that should not be an
OS issue, but rather hardware.  It isn't until after POST that the OS
kicks in.

  Fixed the problem. Stepping back a bit allowed me to see the solution:
take off the battery for a couple of minutes to let the setup drain (no mess
on the desk, either), then reinsert and turn on the power.

  It booted from the floppy and I'm on my way to getting a productive system
again. Whew! Not what I wanted with my morning coffee. But, ... I did get a
telemarketing call at 6;30 am from a used-car-salesman-voice selling
contractor's supplies! I told him we ain't one of 'em.

Perhaps the owners of the produce store?

Cooper, et al.:

  The article noted that the industry is lining up heavily to fight this
because they perceive the purpose to "encourage" FOSS rather than
proprietary software. In the negotiations for language change, work for
language that's neutral and puts both open source and proprietary software
on a completely equal basis. This has two advantages.

  First, it prevents any challange to the law and makes it much easier for a
majority of legislators to pass it and have Gov. Ted sign it. Second, the
many advantages will be obvious -- or easily seen -- when both routes are
laid out side-by-side. Open source software doesn't need an perceived
advantage in the statute's language.

Stealing from the farmer is very different from taking what the farmer
is giving away.  I sure hope M$ isn't planning on using weapons of mass
destruction to ensure license compliance, I don't think the US military
has the budget to invade Redmond.

It looks like the expected amendments are getting applied to HB2892.
This is encouraging as it stands a much greater chance of passing if it
doesn't force the state to raise taxes to fund the removal of all MS,
IBM, SunOS and SCO applications that are installed in Oregon's extensive
inventory. As we can all probably imagine, rewriting all "proprietary"
apps to POSIX spec and standard libraries would have a dramatic
budgetary impact on all of us.

Subject: [PLUG] Urge support for HB2892
Message-ID: <20030404090709.A9424@patch.com>

Dear Ms. Rosenbaum,

This morning I read the coverage of HB2892 that is currently under consideration.

I urge you to support this bill.  I have been an IT professional for almost 20 
years.  Currently I work for Columbia Management Company as a network engineer.
Previously I have worked for companies as large as US Bank and as small as 
a 20 employee consulting firm.

In my experience the biggest roadblock to using open source software is inertia. 
Once that inertia is overcome an unbiased comparison can be made and the benefits
of all competing products can be weighed.  

We use open source software __where appropriate__ and enjoy considerable cost savings.
However, the cost savings are not just in license fees.  We have found that products
handle a greater workload on smaller, less expensive, hardware platforms.  It is 
easier to implement automated monitoring, so that a human being can concentrate 
on other tasks.  

If you were able to hear the testimony of Paul Nelson, you are aware that this 
category of software can be used in the public sector environment successfully.

HB2892 only requires that open source software be considered.  This is an element
of due diligence.  Corporate lobbyists that claim it gives an unfair advantage to 
open source software are (rightfully) doing their job to gain as much business
for their employers as possible.  Unfortunately their employers are not the 
citizens and voters of Oregon.

For future reference, the toshiba laptops I've worked with were _very_
difficult to TURN off. pressing the power switch invariably put them
to sleep (they can do this in hardware, I don't know what sleep stat
it is but it appears to keep the ram powered up while everything else
is quiet).

To turn them off I've had to hold the power button for some
innordinate length of time, longer than your typical 5-second ATX
thing, it seems.

Anyhow, this could explain the behavior you saw, and the solution you
came up with fits. The system won't post when you turn it back on
because it wasn't actually off.

Subject: [PLUG] HB2892: Consideration For "Mabrey's Muslix" Bill
Message-ID: <1049478780.4492.2359.camel@sparticus.coopnkass.com>

The following is an email I sent earlier this morning to Rep. Mabrey:


Dear Representative. Mabrey,

I would like to respond personally to two of your questions during our
committee hearing for HB2892.

Your first question asked effectively, "if I am procuring breakfast
cereal for the state's prison system and I had a choice of trusted brand
names, such as Post or Kelloggs, why would I ever choose "Mabrey's
Muslix?" 

The answer, Representative Mabrey, is that in the real world, "no one
ever got fired for buying Kelloggs." The truth is that IT decision
makers are often compelled to choose a particular cereal not because it
is the most nutritious or is the best value, but because it has brand
recognition. 

Second, you followed up your question asking, "if I know that Kelloggs
brand cereal is reliable and someone asks me to try a relative unknown,
such as "Mabrey's," why would I ever want to do that?"

As a 10 year cereal industry veteran, I know exactly where you are
coming from; I would never risk my production data on an unknown brand
of cereal. 

Fortunately, "Mabrey's Muslix" is actually _very_ well known and backed
heavily by IBM, Hewlette Packard, Sun Microsystems, Oracle, and many
others in the breakfast cereal industry. Further, "Mabrey's Muslix,"
powers the fifth largest "prison system" in the world!

Moreover, many prominent "prison systems" use "Mabrey's Muslix" in their
production environments. Amazon.com, Morgan Stanley, and Intel to name
just three. Here are three references to a long list of "Mabrey's"
customers:

   * http://news.com.com/2100-1001-275155.html?legacy=cnet

   * http://www.vnunet.com/News/1138359

   * http://www.zdnetindia.com/techzone/linuxcentre/stories/78512.html

Personally, I found your questions very pertinent to the matter at hand.
While we used a tongue-and-cheek analogy, these issues are very serious.
I tell you truthfully that I would not have backed HB2892 had I any
doubts that we could dramatically increase the effectiveness of the
State's IT system while at the same time significantly reducing costs.

Representative Mabrey, I encourage your support of HB2892. Oregon will
surely benefit by saving the state millions while at the same time
generating revenue for local Oregon businesses.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0304040950110.13948-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  When I installed Slackware-8.1 the 'pcmcia.dsk' had no problems
identifying and using the external cdrom drive connected via pcmcia card.
Now, however, as I try to install 9.0, the drive is seen as the pcmcia
module is loaded, but the drive is not seen when the installer wants to find
the packages to install.

  I've gone through the base.i, install.1, install.2, and pcmcia.dsk
floppies, and formatted/mounted the partitions twice now with the same
results. And, I don't know where else to ask for insight. With the pcmcia
card the drive is supposed to be seen as an IDE/ATAPI one and that was just
fine before.

  I suppose that as a last resort I could re-install 8.1, then upgrade to
9.0 but that's a chunk of time I'd like to avoid if possible.

Thoughts, anyone?

hmmm, maybe I'm blind, but I don't see how the bill in it's original
form requires, or encourages the rewrite of any software currently in
use.  It addresses _future_ purchases.

I am concerned that the bill will get watered down too much.  I think
that FOSS needs a powerful salesman, just like all the other solutions. 
The other solutions have the cost of selling bundled into the price of
the software.  FOSS does not, I think it is appropriate for the public
by it's proxy the government to level the playing field by acting as a
salesforce for FOSS.

At first glance, Section 1, paragraph 2, sub-paragraph d and e seem to
be fair mandates - I believe they are. Unfortunately it puts the state
in a situation where there will be no additional purchases of MS
platforms. This will force all of the applications that have been
developed in that environment to be rewritten to open standards. There
are many ( MANY ) applications in the states inventory that rely in MS
front, middle and back-end platforms that will require rewrite in order
to comply with this language.

Here's the excerpt:

  (d) Avoid the acquisition of products that do not comply with
open standards for interoperability or data storage; and
  (e) Avoid the acquisition of products that are known to make
unauthorized transfers of information to, or permit unauthorized
control of or modification to state government's computer systems
by, parties outside the control of state government. + }
 

The effect on MS is not the only issue here. What about the huge volume
of CICS, TSO, MVS and like mainframe apps that we all rely on? The
impact there is more than money, it comes down to the fact that no
company has been successful at recreating mainframe apps in a
client/server environment and been able to sustain the requirements.

There you have it!

It's been a long time since I last used Slack, but the upgrade should
be able to handle it. Your partitions haven't changed, however you will
need to be able to tell it which partition is mounted where - i.e.
that /dev/hda1 is mounted on /, /dev/hda2 is /home, /dev/hdb1 is /tmp.

I disagree, the cost of converting software is a reason to buy
proprietary software.  The law does not require the use of FOSS, just
that it be considered and the be a reason for not using FOSS.

Rich,

Surefire way to protect vital directories, alias or no...

[bigfish at kippered tt]$ alias rm
bash: alias: `rm' not found
[bigfish at kippered tt]$ touch -- -i
[bigfish at kippered tt]$ touch this that the other
[bigfish at kippered tt]$ ls
-i  other  that  the  this
[bigfish at kippered tt]$ rm th *       # oops, I really meant to do `rm th*'
rm: cannot remove `th': No such file or directory
rm: remove `other'? n
rm: remove `that'? y
rm: remove `the'? y
rm: remove `this'? y

pathname expansion is your friend :-)

Stafford,

  If only Murphy left it that simple. I re-created /etc/fstab, but the
owner.group was '0.0'. I couldn't change that to 'root.root' 'cause root
wasn't a user: no /etc/passwd.

  Then, when I tried to reboot from the slack floppy the system couldn't
reboot because there was no /etc/inittab!

Sigh,

Bingo... give that man a ceegar! My index.html was the guilty party (had
both of the above). Neither weblint nor W3C's parser flagged that. Nice

But the law does prohibit the use of software that functions as is
described in sub-paragraphs d and e of Section 1 paragraph 2 ( if it
does not prohibit this then why does it contain this language? ). This
fact, in effect, forces the state to buy platforms that do not act like
this, thus removing Windows from consideration. Once it's determined
that Windows is not an option, the application components are going to
have to be upgraded to an environment that incorporates fair and
reasonable practices.

Again, I agree with the spirit and language included in the bill. I'm
only speaking up to raise awareness that, while it is the right thing to
do, it is not going to be very budget friendly.

I think you are reading too much into this, even the BSA and ISC guys

In reality, "avoid" == "don't consider" == "prohibit purchasing" which
goes back to the need for some minor language changes.

Message-ID: <1049495555.6444.376.camel@sparticus.coopnkass.com>

Friends, 

First, I cannot stress enough how proud I am of all of you who have
taken an active roll to see this legislation get first to committee and
now to a work session! I am not exaggerating when I say had it not been
for your active support, none of this would have been possible. Thank
you all again! 

Okay, so many of you are dying to know: we made it to work session! This
is historical. This means that the Representatives for the General
Government Committee feel that there is sufficient interest in the bill
to warrant further action! Again, I am very proud. 

Basically, Ken Barber started testimony with what I felt was a crisp
representation of the bill. His words were powerful and I could tell
that he felt very deeply about this issue. It showed. I'm telling you,
Ken was in rare form. 

Secondly, There was testimony from a representative of O'reilly
discussing how critical it is for government to use open standards. Good
stuff. Thanks are extend to the O'reilly team for their support. 

Third, I kind of "took one for the team" and testified on Open Source
Security. I covered the idea that Open Source developers write code in a
particular manner because their heart was in it, and that the code that
they do write is under intense scrutiny as it develops. I also covered
the idea that an application cannot be truly secure unless it's design
is known to all and yet is still difficult to exploit. 

Believe me, I would love to have testified that as a 10 year IT veteran,
that I have tracked IT trends and can testify that some proprietary
vendors (Microsoft in particular) are definitely not nice guys, "and
here's why..." 

I listened to the audio stream when I came home and I am confident that
I did a good job. The reality is that my testimony was easy to make: it
was the truth. 

After the first panel (we testified in groups of three), the "education
squad" came ready for bear. 

They made a fantastic presentation; Eric Harrision (Lane School
District), Paul Nelson (Riverdale High School), and Quentin Hartmen
(Multnomah Ed. Service Dist.) really were the engine that moved our
testimony forward.

Others supporters followed. There was no shortage of interest in this
bill.

After we had finished our testimony, the Initiative For Software Choice,
the Computing Technology Industry Association, and the Business Software
Alliance testified as a panel. 

The Initiative for Software Choice testified among other things that 
"No law rule or regulation stands in the way of Oregon Software
procurement professionals from obtaining the most appropriate software
for it's needs."

That may be true, but that doesn't mean that we're necessarily dealing
with a level playing field in the Software marketplace. Imagine Ford
Motor Company had a monopoly on the auto market. While there's no law
prohibiting Government agencies from buying another brand of car, the
reality in the market place is that everybody buys Ford and ships
taxpayer dollars to Dearborn Michigan in the process.

The Business Software Alliance testified that, "...And [Oregon's
thriving technological innovation] is in no small part due to the fact
that this body has wisely and successfully chosen to let market forces,
not legislative mandates, drive that innovation."

Is that why Intel laid off 4,000 workers last spring? Is that why we
have so much competition in the Operating System and office productivity
suite markets?

Finally, the Oregon Department of Administrative Services testified.
They basically said first that they support "the concept of using open
source software, and does so today, but is unable to support the bill
without changes to the measure's language."

I look forward to working with the Department of Administrative Services
to address any concerns they may have.

Over the weekend I will post the opponent's written testimony on our web
site.

I will keep you posted.


Very Truly Yours,

Eric works with me here and the MESD, not sure about Hartmen, but I'm
guessing he's the Lane Schoold District guy ;-)

Congratulations Cooper! It's a lot of work and a lot of time to get 
legislation passed. Getting it to a work session is a big step, that means 
business. Of all the many bills introduced each session, only a small 
percentage get this far. Well done.

  Judd's suggestion works! I used the boot/root/pcmcia disks from 8.1 and
the cdrom drive is recognized as /dev/hdc. I'm now installing the packages
from the 9.0 cdrom.

  I'll send a note to P at rick about this and hope that he keeps the driver
from 8.1 that was removed from 9.0 for future releases.

Excelsior!

It says "Avoid", avoid indicates a dispreference, not a prohibition.

I disagree, my experience with government procurement is that they read
this language very carefully and read it in the most favorable light
towards the procurement of the system most favored by the procuring
agency.  Avoid means you need to say why you picked it, they won't have
to try hard to come up with a reason.

This bill if passed would not actually require any change it the
software purchased, since you can always come up with an excuse.  The
pratical effect of this biilo would be two fold, it would give "cover"
to any agency that chose and open source product so that when the
inevtable problems occur and some MS flack won;t be able get people
fired for chosing some <insert derogatory label here> instead of the
"industry standard well proven..." product from Redmond Washington.

Second it will and a hoop to jump thorough so that sometimes it may just
be easier to chose a FOSS product than the crap from MS, to offset the
effort of learning about the alternatives and educating you boss.

Sorry Brian, that is not at all correct, no matter how you attempt to
twist the language the fact remains that to avoid is to not extend
consideration. The only saving grace is that the language in the bill
does stipulate that communication to entities outside of state control
is "unauthorized". The very fact that MS does disclose that their
operating system does communicate like this, and you agree to this by
using the product, then it might be construed as "authorization" and
therefor not subject to these mandates. This is, at least, as sketchy as
confusing "avoid" with "not preferred".

I too have a some recent experience with government procurement. In
fact, I am the one that purchased the Linux dist for use on the ODOT
mainframe. It will be arriving next week.

There is one more benefit to this bill. Whether it passes or not, it is
forcing MS to rethink their business practices, fix their garbage OS and
lower the cost. This is having a positive impact that's much bigger than
any of us.

According to Merriam-Webster (you know, the dictionary people):

avoid  	1: To make legally void.
	2: VOID, EXPEL
	3: a: to keep away from : SHUN
	   b: to prevent the occurrence or effectiveness of
	   c: to refrain from
	4. to depart or withdraw from : LEAVE

Will you be requiring additional clarification on this one or shall we
move on?

Has any one done a virus scan on it yet. I saved off my copy and I'm 
going to try scanning it with Symantec AV later from my Win2K laptop to 
see what it might be harboring.

Tony,

  I can't save any of the M$ binaries to the ext3 filesystem and I have no
virus scanner so I do nothing with these things other than report them as
spam.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0304041937440.15016-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  When I run 'fdformat /dev/fd0H1440', is any filesystem put on the floppy
disk? It's a low-level format so I assume not. But, when I try using
                         /sbin/mkfs -t ext2 /dev/fd0
I get a bad blocks report.

  What I'm trying to do is copy a bunch of linux files (e.g., /etc/skel/.*,
~/.bash*) to a floppy both for storage and for transfer to a portable. But,
the floppy disk comes out of the box as vfat filesystem and it screws up the
filenames as well as changing owners and permissions.

  What am I doing wrong here?

TIA,

I always just use mtools and leave the floppy with in its "native" msdos 
format.  ext2 just isn't suited for removable media, IMHO.  Maybe it's 
better now, but I used to get kernel panics when ejecting a mounted ext2 floppy.

I would just create a tar file containing the desired files, and then
use mcopy to put the tar file on the floppy.  That saves messing
about with creating and mounting other filesystems on a floppy.

Kyle,

  I tried the mtools, but they didn't want to work for me in moving
.bash_profile and files such as these. I end up with .bash_p~.1.

galen,

  D'oh! Another evening and my brain slows down. Sure, tar 'em. The mtools
are a bit flaky in RH 7.3 here, but I'll see what I can do.

Many thanks,

There is always the extravagent step of umount'ing them before
ejection, of course.  

Another option would be to tar them to a tgz and then use mtools to
copy _that_ file, unpacking at the other end.

I've heard of that but it seems to go against nature.  I came in after 
washing machines & disk packs and always thought the folks had it right when 
they invented the eject button.  Plus why waste the time reformatting a 
floppy disk to ext2?  I'll have to look into the filename truncation, don't 
remember it being a problem, but it's been awhile since I've needed a floppy 
for anything.

Redhat used to distribute for for some RISC chips (7.1 on Alpha, 6.2 on Sparc)
I presumed I was the only one buying the distributions though, so they
gave up... I think Debian is your best bet for a cross-platform Linux
distro these days.

  Has anyone useful dot-files to be placed in /etc/skel so they're added to
each new user's ~/? How about handy or cool aliases and other tips?

  I'd like to benefit from the collective wisdom and experience here as I
get ready to install linux on a couple of new boxes. These would also be
handy if placed on the Web site as a benefit for all who stumble over them.

For what it's worth, SuSE in the s390 build is labled SLES7 and SLES8.
Redhat also builds and markets an s390 and z/Series version in the 7 and
8 versions. It's doubtful that many will use these builds since they run
exclusively on the IBM mainframe environments and are pretty expensive
to support. For example, SuSE supports the SLES builds through a web
site ( not adequate for prime-time ) and Mainline offers 3rd party live
support agreements with the total support+OS package prices around ~42K
annually. Redhat builds AS for the z/Series and s/390 platforms and
fully supports it in Basic and Enterprise packages ( 12x7 or 24x7
support respectfully ), and the cost is ~15K annually.

  With Red Hat, a user's initial group is a group with that username as in
'tux.tux'. In Slackware, all new users are placed in an initial group of
'users', as in 'tux.users'.

  Does this difference make any practical difference?

You actually using version 1.0.8-11. I was having similar issues with
this version too and they seem to have gone away after I upgraded to
1.2.2.

Yes, it does.  It allows finer control of group access.  I was used to
the old Unix way of having the primary group be 'users', but this way
allows you to things like the following:

There are accounts andy, joe, sally & thelma.  You can assign joe and
sally to the groups for andy.  Then they will have access to andy's
group-accessible files, but thelma will not.

I've had the Inbox of Evolution seize up when trying to read (or delete)
a particular email (some M$ viral thing).  To fix it, I opened my mail
file in a text editor, after deleted the offending email, Evolution
would run just fine.  (Try doing that with a proprietary format!)  If
you back-up your email file, you don't have anything to lose.

(:-) Sorry about that, I really should learn to read some day. When
yours stalled did it partially draw the from-subject-sent region and
leave it with what looks like an erased horizontal smear thru the
middle? Does RH 8.0 have 1.2.2 as an RPM?

Don't think that's my problem: I deleted all my mail folders and tried

Did you try moving your evolution directory out of the way completely? 
Seems like if its user specific, a total user reset should fix it.

Ok, I upgraded to evolution 1.2. I still have the exact same trouble. I
moved the whole evolution sub dir. to another place, and let it start
from nothing. I still have the exact same trouble.

Relevent facts:
  RH 8.0
  Evol. 1.2
  Symptom:
    It starts up and freezes without displaying the mail view. I can
still  do many other things, but it will not display any mail stuff. It
only partially draws the subject-content panel.

It works fine for another user!

Where does this thing send it's log messages?

  I understand this from using RH for almost 6 years. What I gather from
your response is that for a small network it probably makes no difference.
As a matter of fact, on the current network I created a 'users' group
specifically so that we could share files.

Yup.  Now that I'm retired and the network consists only of my wife
and I, I use 'users' to simplify sharing.  Although for only two, I
guess either model would work.

The next question of course is why in billy blue blazes the two of us

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0304051717000.18855-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  On the newly installed distribution on my notebook, the network is up and
running, but I cannot reach all other hosts.

  When I ping by hostname I can reach "caddis" (192.168.55.2) and router1
(192.168.55.4), but I cannot reach "salmo" (192.168.55.1). I cannot find the
glitch. The message returned by "ping salmo" is:
	ping: unknown host salmo

  The other direction works: pinging lemna from salmo.

  /etc/hosts is the same on all boxes (transferred by floppy disk). Isn't
this where host names are resolved to IP addresses? Where else should I look
for this problem?

Thanks,

Rich

  Well, a reboot made all hosts reachable. Sigh. Somehow, I just don't think
of rebooting after all these years on linux. :-)

Have you run 'killev' and 'oaf-slay'?

I believe RH also ships a PowerPC distro for IBM pSeries (nee RS/6000). 
The binaries work on Macs but the kernel and installer are specially
built for pSeries.

When I have my work laptop I use at work at home and on our network we 
have 7 systems going sometimes and they're only two of us in the house. 
I have an 8th system which was my OpenBSD firewall test system at home 
but I took it work to use as a print/time server for our Linux and 
Windows systems in the office. 

One of the problems with Linux and the BSD operating systems I'm finding 
is that they allow older systems to remain useful years after they are 
incapable of running a newer versions of Windows. This has led me to 
have a rather large cache of useful systems running in my house.
Realistically we only have 3 or 4 systems going at any one time although 
if I'm doing some upgrades or other things I'll have 6 machines going 
at once.

Similarly here. There is her desktop, my desktop, the laptop, the
firewall and the crash machine.  Five active machines doesn't count
the well controller (an old NEC 75 MHz laptop) or the previous
firewall machine sitting idle on the floor.  :-) I guess I'll give it

Yeah.  I've tried to reform over the years, but I fear I'm still an
unreconstructed Unix sysadmin.  [I used to be a Control Data mainframe
system programmer, but I don't generally admit that to anyone!]

Sounds like characters from some MUD or Lord of the Rings. Ans=no.

But when ev came up just now it came up with my addr book showing!

I had switched users so this probably inadvertently did what you suggested.

I will never reveal what caused my problem unless I get really drunk at some PLUG debriefing at the lucky Lab.

Message-ID: <86pto05i6g.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I am experimenting with user-mode linux on a headless box that I am
secure-shelled into.  I am having trouble figuring out the linux
command-line to give me a console.  When I "boot", I get a bunch of
normal boot messages, but then:

   INIT: Entering runlevel: 2
   Starting system log daemon: syslogd.
   Starting kernel log daemon: klogd.
   Starting internet superserver: inetd.
   Starting deferred execution scheduler: atd.
   Starting periodic command scheduler: cron.
   INIT: Id "0" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes
   INIT: Id "1" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes
   INIT: Id "2" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes
   INIT: Id "c" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes
   INIT: no more processes left in this runlevel

The 0, 1, 2, and c are all from the uml's /etc/inittab.

A separate xterm would be nice, but I'd be happy just getting the
console on the xterm I am launching the uml from.  I've tried various
permutations from the uml website:

  <http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/input.html>

but really I am just flailing at the moment.  Anyone with some clues?

Look at the control mconsole option.  Once you get the uml running you
can log in using ssh or what ever protocol you started.

Subject: [PLUG] Help with gnome-libs-1.2.13 make error
Message-ID: <20030405221020.E32374@defiant.ncplus.net>

Howdy!

I decided it was time to upgrade gnumeric. So, I went to the web, and
found that the new one definitely had all the features I was tired of
doing without. I downloaded the RPM, but it was built for something
newer than RH7.2; so I decided to download source and build it.

It wanted lots of other stuff, so I got that stuff too. I started
building and installing said stuff. gnome-libs-1.2.13 is the latest
stable version, and it wanted one newer than I had, so I got this too.
The configure script got satisfied after 3 attempts (and building
other stuff), but the make file is unhappy with a call to dbopen.
dbopen is on my system, but the compiler complains of an 'implicit
declaration of function `dbopen`'. The output from the build is
included below. There are alot of other failures too, but I think
fixing the first one will do the trick. I just don't know where to
look to get this working.

I've made a little progress.  I can now ping the uml interface, but
can't telnet or ssh to it, probably because the image I am using (a
Debian-3.0r0.ext2.bz2) doesn't provide daemons to answer.

Progress, anyway.

[... time passes ...]

I was able to install ssh on the debian image (actually, a bigger one
I created with dd, mke2fs and rsync) using the handy: 

  dpkg --root=/mnt -i foo.deb

[... more time passes ...]

Had a little trouble getting passwords squared away.  Sshd wasn't
happy with empty ones, finally booted with "linux ... single" and set
the passwords and now I can slogin!

Woohoo!

I am currently apt-get upgrading my uml image!

Cool.

Tony,

  Whether or not you squeak is up to you, but I've used MagicPoint for
presentations for several years and it works great. It may not have all the
bells and whistles of PowerPunt, but you write the script as an ASCII text
file and can display it in another virtual terminal simultaneously.
Presentation, of course, is full screen.

  At a meeting last year a co-presenter couldn't find a Windoze portable for
her presentation so we sat down at a table and I created hers (from the hard
copy) in mgp. Then she used my notebook for her talk. IIRC, the text file
was about 4K in size. Her ppt file was about 1M in size.

I had the same problem, and figured out that my uml root_fs inittab was
trying to spawn gettys on ttys that didn't exist. You can confirm that
by loopback mounting your root_fs on your host machine, something like:

mount -o loop /usr/local/uml/root_fs /mnt

Then you can "tail /mnt/var/log/messages", and that should show you what
is wrong. I ended up changing the tty device names in the root_fs
inittab to ttys that actually existed. When you get them right, you'll
have an xterm pop up on your host system for each tty that has a getty
on it in the uml system.

Yeah, that's what I did to "fix" it.  In my case, I just commented out
all the ttys and made sshd work instead.

Ah yeah.  I'll investigate further.

Message-ID: <86znn32pu0.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

In playing with user-mode linux, I've been thinking about how to
configure my name servers.  In the past, I've run two separate servers
on two separate machines, one for "outside" with the public IPs and
another one for servicing the inside machines and giving "inside"
answers to queries.

I'd rather stick to one physical machine these days, since I lost my
airconditioning.  Question I am pondering is whether to use the
Bind9's view feature, or run a user-mode linux on the same physical
machine to serve the inside machines.  Opinions?

You can also override this with command line parameters when you start
the uml, I use something like this to start the file "root_fs":

linux eth0=tuntap,,,192.168.0.50 con=port:9000 con1=tty:/dev/tty11 con0=tty:/dev/tty12

which directs the boot message stuff to tty12 (<ctrl>+<alt>+<F12>) on
the host, first console to tty11 (<ctrl>+<alt>+<F11>), and the rest
redirected to port 9000 on the host.  To login, just "telnet hostname
9000", even if the tuntap network isn't working.

This was one of the things I tried when flailing, but I never got it
to work for me.  

Part of my problem was trying to understand where the handle "con1"
(et al) came from and how to translate that (if necessary) in other
contexts.

That's a pain, it shows all the system users, not just the humans. With all 
the specializing unix commands floating around, seems like there ought to be 
one that lists only the human users.

It didn't start working for me until I assigned con0 and con1
elsewhere.  I think that con0 has to be able to push out text to
something that will act like it is being displayed, port 9000 doesn't
qualify until a telnet session is started.

Maybe direct it to a serial port (or parallel port)?

The only real drawback that I've come across using user-mode is the lack
of control over the user-mode by the host kernel.  I can't figure out a
way to have the host shutdown the user-mode when the host gets the halt
or reboot command.  I've also come across some issues with the clock and
PHP, but that shouldn't have any effect on a DNS server.

  'who' tells you who's logged in on a specific machine. 'less /etc/passwd'
lists all users.

$ awk -F: '{if ($3 >= 500) { print $1 }}' /etc/passwd

Assuming system users are those with UID < 500.  Or in a networked
environment, which may be using NIS or LDAP:

getent passwd |awk -F: '...'

This assumes that the user has a directory in /home but you can adapt
this command to suit your environment:

  cat /etc/passwd | grep /home | awk -F : '{ print $1 }'

  ssh -l root uml-host-ip /sbin/halt 

If the host can secure shell to uml's root without a password
(i.e. with appropriate uml /root/.ssh/authorized_keys), that seems to
work.  Then just have that in the "stop" portion of your
/etc/init.d/uml-foo script, just like you start and stop other
services.

Or what about selection by UID_MIN?  On my system, the human accounts are >=

Yes:
  axp = DEC Alpha
  ia64 = Itanium, Intel's 64-bit CPU
  ppc = PowerPC, a RISC chip co-developed by Apple and IBM, in the   
        family of IBM's POWER architecture

An HP-9000 is a PA-RISC processor; I dunno if there are any current
distros for it.

Debian. Debian runs on the following architectures: The Dec ALPHA
(that's the ev5 and ev56, not the new alpha), the ARM processors that
you see in lots of handhelds, the PA-RISC,
(http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/hppa/install), our friendly x86,
the Itanium (ia64), the Motorola 68k, MIPS, DEC MIPS, the PowerPC, the
s390, and the SPARC.

And, of course, NetBSD runs on it.

Then again, NetBSD runs on some toasters.

I'll take a stab at this, since it's been low traffic-

Record it as a wav file with something like the "sound recorder" under
sound and video under the little red hat on my toolbar. (RH8.0)

Next, use an MP3 compressor like ripperX. Under the configuration tab,
there's a checkbox for "make an MP3 from an existing wav file"

All,

In keeping with release schedules as "early and often," I have updated
the HB2892 page. You may now find my testimony written testimony and the
opposition's written testimony there.

Also, you may hear Realplayer audio of the General Government Committee
hearing on HB 2892 here (special thanks to Paul Nelson of Riverdale High
School for this link):

http://www.leg.state.or.us/listn/archive/archive.2003s/HGG-200304030813.ram
  
I have a meeting this morning but will update the page with the
proponent's testimony when I return. There's plenty of proponent
testimony, believe me!

Finally, just so you know, the Oregon Dept. of Administrative services,
while testifying officially that they are "against" this bill, are
actually saying that they oppose only some of the language in this bill,
_not_ the bill itself.

You might look into "gramofile" it is intended to be used with records and
tapes, provides mechanisms for enhancing the captured audio and automatic
detection and splitting out of individual tracks.  I don't recall if it
generates MP3's directly, but that can be easily handled with a shell
script if not.  One warning, it appears to be broken when run on SMP
systems.

Actually Redhat starts them at 500, not 501.

I think I must learn this awk, that's a lot simpler than what I've been

As far as I know, you do have to have the subdomains listed in the
domain for a browser to find them. 

If you have the domain "domain.com", and you put a webpage there, the
browser finds it, and apache sends it. 

If you then set up apache to serve "subdomain.domain.com", it knows
about it, but the browser won't, until you put "subdomain.domain.com" in
your dns. The reason is that as far as the 'net is concerned,
"subdomain.domain.com" doesn't exist until it's listed in your dns. 

Hope that helps.

If you use views, you only consume one IP address. If you run
two DNS daemons, you use two IP addresses - since both need to use
UDP port 53.

Of course, if you use the same BIND daemon for both your authority
server and your recursive name server, you run the risk of
cache poisoning. The best solution (with BIND) is to run two BIND
daemons (one in a UML if you choose) and have one devoted to
the authority server function using views for inside/outside
answers. The other is your recursive name server.

Apache will handle all of the mapping sub domain to particular points in your 
web tree (if configured correctly).  The issue is that the client needs DNS to 
tell it what IP address to associate with a subdomain host name so that it 
can send the request to apache to process.  

The client cannot assume that (for example) www.subdomain.domain.samp
is at the same IP address as www.domain.samp.  So a DNS entry is required.

If you do not have the dns information correct for the subdomains, how is 
anyone going to know which IP addresses they resolve to?

It is possible to default all of the subdomains to a single IP, but I 
forget how to do it.  (I try not to deal with Bind, unless I absolutly 
have to.)

Talk with the people who maintain your DNS tables.

Until DNS is resolved, you can hack the domains into /etc/hosts and test 
things from the same machine.

Computerworld has an article that mentions that Rhode Island and Hawaii
are getting into the act:

http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/os/story/0,10801,80053,00.html


<snip>
Sharing can be especially helpful if your software needs are different from
those of most organizations, notes Jim Willis, director of eGovernment at
the Rhode Island Department of State.

His office used open-source software to design a repository for the vast
library of content, which ranges from rules and regulations to the minutes
of municipal meetings, that the State Department must keep on hand and make
available to the general public. A colleague from the state of Hawaii heard
about Willis' work and e-mailed to ask his advice about a similar project.
That got Willis thinking that states could help one another by sharing the
open-source software they had modified for special state uses. "We're now
trying to set up [an online] repository of which state agencies are using
open source and for what projects," he says.

Although the details have yet to be ironed out, Willis plans for the states'
open-source repository to be available to everyone, so the rest of the
open-source community can benefit -- and contribute. The plan is for
Rhode Island and Hawaii to jointly create and maintain a Web site that
will archive the documentation of the work each state has done on its
open-source software. The hope is that in the future other states will
also document their work.

"Documenting our practices with the intent to share them with others
has threefold benefits," Willis notes. "We learn from the experience of
other states, we share development resources with other states, and we
have better internal documentation of our own practices. All this for
the effort of articulating our practices and documenting our internally
developed software such that it makes sense to others."

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0304071611290.6719-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  My CUPS installation has started acting flaky. One of the symptoms is
having a printer stopped -- for no discernable reason. When I try to start
that printer (it's name is 'laser5'), it starts, but then a new printer,
'laser5@' is created -- stopped. Every time I go through this another '@' is
added. I've stopped with a phantom printer called 'laser5@@@@@@@'.

  Has anyone encountered this before?

Thanks,

This is actually a project for school, so my friend has control over the DNS 
server and tables.  I just thought that it was possible for 
subdomain.domain.com to be sent to the domain.com entry and have apache do 
the thinking of where to find the page.

Just trying to find a shortcut of some kind :-D  Thanks to all for their 
responses, I have learned a lot from this thread and the others I have seen

O'Reilly press "sed & awk"  it's part of the UNIX Power Tools series.
The book retails for 29.95 but I bet you can find it used at Powell's
for a better price. It's a good place to start.

Oh yeah - and Solaris8 starts UID's at 100 ( just to make sure that
there's no consistency ).

That's okay, I've got at least ... er, lets see, 192.168.0.0 to

I guess Bind can do that too:

  view "external" {

In addition to the freely available documentation, I've been using the
original _The Awk Programming Language_, by Aho, Kernigan and
Weinberger for years.  It's probably the book I take off the shelf
most often.  I'm somewhat flabbergasted that Amazon wants $57 for it
these days.  It must have been about $20 when I bought it new 15 years
ago.

Put a hold on those packages.

  # aptitude hold kernel-uml kernel-doc 

ought to work, if you've got aptitude.  If not, you can do it in
dselect, but I am not sure there is a command-line that does it for
dpkg or apt-get.  Maybe I'm wrong.

  Wow! Someone else who also uses the epinominous AWK book. I, too, bought
mine in 1988 when it first came out and I don't think it was that expensive.
No price on my copy, though.

There are actually a few steps to making this work, like making aliases
to your Ethernet interface that respond to the new IP addresses. 

Can you browse the webs directly by IP? Can you ping the IP from
somewhere else?

More info and the relevant parts of httpd.conf, please.

You don't "need" additional ip addresses for domains. I have two domains
(dimstar.net and undernet.us) both pointed at my one ip address. 

In addition, I have several subdomains (mail.dimstar.net,
www.dimstar.net, ldp.dimstar.net, oregon.undernet.us) that are all
pointing at the same IP as the main domain name.

Put a hold on those packages.

  # aptitude hold kernel-uml kernel-doc 

ought to work, if you've got aptitude.  If not, you can do it in
dselect, but I am not sure there is a command-line that does it for
dpkg or apt-get.  Maybe I'm wrong.

Subject: [PLUG] smtpd failures
Message-ID: <20030408170412.GA2768@boora.com>

I'm using smtpd to route mail through spamassassin and then to Exchange.
Lately, we've been noticing entries like this in the log:

Apr  8 10:08:16 zipper smtpd[30814]: smtp connection from
UNKNOWN at UNKNOWN(206.102.12.9) MAIL FROM: <astadler at glumac.com> RCPT TO:
<harper at boora.com>, allowed by line 235 of /etc/smtpd_check_rules
Apr  8 10:08:16 zipper smtpd[30814]: Recipient <harper at boora.com>
Apr  8 10:08:16 zipper smtpd[30814]: Read failed from client fd
(Connection reset by peer) - Abandoning      session
Apr  8 10:08:16 zipper smtpd[30814]: write failed: (Broken pipe)

That mail never makes it to the recipient.  Does anyone have any clue
what that might mean.  The sender can usually send to others in the
office so I don't think the problem is on their end....but who knows.
The line UNKNOWN at UNKNOWN is harmless too, lots of mails DO get through
when logged this way.

I keep forgetting that most people have no need to have their
recursive name servers available to the outside as I do.

That should do it if it works as advertised. I'm still nervous
about one daemon handling both functions so I usually separate
them, have them run as non-root, and chroot them to their own
directories. Paranoid? Maybe.

I have a Postfix server handling mail requests from the outside that then
relays all mail to an internal MS Exchange server.  I'd like to save 24

recover email over the past day.  Any suggestions on how to do this with
Postfix?

"Connection reset by peer" indicates that the Exchange box is dropping
the connection for whatever reason.  Do you have logs on it that you 
can check?

Don't the messages go into the retry queue and get delivered later?

It never gets to Exchange.  I believe the "peer" is easystreet sending
on our mail.  They do keep retrying....and getting rejected.  What does
"fd" mean?  I removed all my rules in smtpd_check_rules and now things
are flowing ok.  Sounds like a syntax error.  I'm closing in on it.

The 'client fd' is the file descriptor used to read from the tcp
socket.

The puzzling part is the 'Connection reset by peer' error, which
typically indicates that the remote application halted operation
unexpectedly. You'd see that if, for instance, the remote MTA died in
the middle of sending the DATA portion of the message.

You see an analagous messages in web logs if a remote user presses her 
browser's Stop button before it downloaded the whole page from your 
server.

Wow, I thought you could only do mail.domain.com and mail2.domain.com
and www.domain.com. I didn't realize that apache would also do
www.otherdomain.com at the same IP.

Very cool.

It looks like it's running as I understand you want it to right now.

I got to three different sites just now, www, dev and inc.

Does it look like you're getting what you wanted at 2pm?

Have they even released the ES product?

The "Advanced Server" product was a hacked version of 7.2.  (2.4.9 
kernel.)

The "enterprise" code seems to be pretty conservative when it comes to 
versions.

Redhat 7.3 is running 2.4.18 with modifications.

Redhat 8.0 is running 2.4.18 as well.

Redhat 9 is a weird beast and runs 2.4.20 with a bunch of backports from 
2.5.x.  (Enough that it is kind of both and neither.)

If your code works for any of the stock 2.4 Redhat kernels, you should be 
OK.  I would especially test if you run with the Redhat 9 kernel, as it 
has the most knarly changes.  (nptl thread library and scheduler changes.)

Mike

Right now those three is what I have right now.  But each one has to be 
added to the DNS before they can be reached.  Adding DNS entries and 
reloading DNS whenever the instructor decideds on adding more virtual hosts 
can be annoying and time consuming.  So I am trying to find a dynamic way of 
doing it.  I don't suppose the following example will work ?

<VirtualHost 192.168.1.4>
   DocumentRoot /www/*.liquidwire.org
   ServerName *.liquidwire.org
</VirtualHost>

Have *.liquidwire.org point to 192.168.1.4 in the DNS.

Say my documentroot is /var/www/, could possibly add foo.liquidwire.org and 
have foo.liquidwire.org work without messing with DNS.  I haven't had a 
chance to try it out, just thought of it actually hehe.  Any comments ?  
(This is the first time I have used apache so I am a little slow with it)

Thanks for your responses

Apache doesn't care if the names exist in DNS or not. It's the browser
that will have the problem finding the site if it doesn't exist in DNS. 

If you point your browser at somename.firewire.com, and "somename" isn't
listed in the "firewire.com" domain table, the browser doesn't know
where to find it, so it gives up.

Short answer: There isn't a shortcut. You must add them to DNS.

  It depends on what you call their "ES Product".  They have a new "enterprise" offering that doesn't appear to be available.  That seems to be the stuff getting press from Oracle.  

  The "Enterprise AS" offering appears to be a re-licensed version of their old high-end enterprise offering.  The "Enterprise ES" seems to be the same stuff without the clustering tools.

  It's hard to tell...  I'm having trouble parsing technical information from the marketing BS on their web site.  It doesn't help when they don't return calls or emails.

  That's what I'm looking for... I just need a stable 2.4.x based release and security patches.  I don't want to rebuild these beasts every year when RHN drops support for the release dejure.

  I've run the modules and apps on 2.4.18 kernel in RH 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0.  They all seem to work OK, except for hotplug!  I have to disabling hotpug in RH 7.3 and 8.0.  The "thunk" to userspace causes huge delays when I configured devices.

  I'm building production systems right now.  Testing on the "2.[56].x" kernel will have to wait for a free day in the lab.

You can wildcard hosts in a domain using a different DNS server.

Perhaps you could use procmail to save a backup.. i do this on a per user

there.

If you look in ftp://updates.redhat.com/, you can find source files hidden 
in their Enterprise section. (In a directory called AS21.)

If not, I can get you a copy.

The FREE GEEK class is well under way. The model is that we spend a few 
weeks covering the basics in a lecture style kinda way, and then we 
evolve into a workshop, where the homework is actual work that FREE GEEK 
needs done.

We are currently in the workshop phase which will go on for as long as 
it takes to complete our project, which is reimplementing our java/jsp 
database application in PHP.

People who want to play catch up and get some hands on experience are 
welcome to drop in.

Tuesdays, 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm at FREE GEEK.

Russ has got it. If you want to type an address in the address bar and
have it go there, it must be in the DNS tables. Lots of sites, including
my credit union, do not have their DNS set to do this. Try
http://www.ptcu.org and http://ptcu.org. the latter does not have a DNS
entry, so you can't get to it without the www.

If you have access to /etc/hosts on the machine doing the browsing, you
can add it there and avoid the of-site DNS lookup, but that's the only
way I know of.

Most of what you say is true. However, the Web server still needs to
know the name if you're doing name-based virtual hosting. Using your
example, if www.ptcu.org is a virtual host and you don't also tell
the virtual server about the name ptcu.org, it will not work even
though the DNS has both names. If you're running Apache, you'll
need to have these in your virtual host configuration:

ServerName   www.ptcu.org
ServerAlias  ptcu.org


If your Web server is running www.ptcu.org as the main server
(not a virtual host), then what you say is completely true.

Message-ID: <40646.12.47.207.251.1049926595.squirrel@webmail.pdxlug.org>

Is there a way to redirect a user to a specific location based on who they
authenticate as?

For example, Bob goes to mysite.com and is prompted with a typical
htaccess login box.  He logs in as graphics/password and is taken to
mysite.com/graphics.  But if he logs in using accounting/password, he's
taken to mysite.com/accounting.  If someone goes directly to one of the
URLs, then it would also prompt them for a login, of course.

Thanks,
~Matt

  I'm giving up on getting dosemu running on my system. This means that
after 18 years I'll have to give up my text-based management system (tbms)
which let me do sequential, full-text searches on "notes". Sigh. Incredibly
useful tool. So, ... I need to develop a linux-based replacement.

  I have three databases to translate. In order of importance they are: my
scientific literature reference library database, my recipe database and my
random notes database.

  For the literature reference db, rather than using bibtex, I think it
would be more practical to use XML tags and a dtd to let me
add/view/modify/delete individual records.

  Has anyone a suggestion of a format to use, or an existing wheel that does
not need re-inventing?

Thanks,

Rich,

DocBook has an entire bibliographic subset:

  http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/bibliography.html

I'm not into editor wars, but the psgml mode in emacs makes DocBook 
editing much simpler than it might otherwise be.

Also, I understand that the OpenOffice.org 1.1 beta can spew DocBook, 
but I haven't tried it.

My bias is to go with the XML schema for DocBook, not SGML. In the 
short run, you won't be able to use the Jade tools, but I think the 
tool support will be better for XML in the long run.

I'm heavy into DocBook XSL stylesheet customization these days, so I'm 
probably way more into this stuff than I ought to be...

  Thanks, Paul! I forgot about DocBook. Either BibioEntry or BibliMixed will
do quite nicely. Trying to follow the Web pages, and get the information I
need is quite the challange! Two word followed by another link. Sheesh!

  I prefer emacs to vi so you won't get any cheek from me. :-) I'll have to
dig out the info on invoking psgml mode.

  I much prefer writing in emacs; OO.o is used for letters, invoices and

  I'll take down my DocBook book and read it again. Quite forgot about it,

  Nah. If you make a nice stylesheet for printing a bibliography please send

Yes. You'd have to have some script (perl, python, php or ???) examine
the environment, and react accordingly. 

I use these variables on occasion:

$user = $ENV{REMOTE_USER};
$userip = $ENV{REMOTE_ADDR};
$userhost = $ENV{REMOTE_HOST};

Subject: [PLUG] HB 2892 Update
Message-ID: <1049995147.5038.3146.camel@sparticus.coopnkass.com>

Friends, 

I attended the meeting yesterday at the Capitol meeting to help hammer
out a compromise on HB 2892, the Open Source bill. 

Proponents of the bill comprised Rep. Barnhart, Ken Barber, Paul Nelson
with Multnomah ESD, and myself.

Opponents comprised of a representative of Microsoft, the Initiative for
Software Choice, legal council, and the Dept. of Administrative
Services.

The bill is currently in the amendment phase. It seems that there is
sufficient need to warrant a bill over simply modifying the current
Oregon statutes. 

It turns out that language already exists in the Oregon Statutes
discussing "Open Systems." It was expressed that in this area of the
bill simply modifying the existing Oregon Statutes may prove more
flexible in the long term. Statutory recognition of Open Source, in
conjunction with the bill itself, was deemed by DAS as the most
appropriate way to achieve the desired "leveling" affect.

DAS has offered to propose the amendments that we discussed. I am
pleased with our current progress and look forward to reviewing DAS's
proposed amendments.

Finally, Rep. Krummel took a few moments to oversee our progress. He
"laid it down" and expressed that he really would like to see a level
playing field and open standards with the State's IT procurement
process. Those of you who live Wilsonville are lucky to have him. 

I will keep you posted including a complete transcript of the DAS's
proposed changes to both the Oregon Statute and the bill itself.


Very Truly Yours,

Sorry to correct you again, but Paul Nelson is with Riverdale School
District, Eric Harrison (also present and a proponent of the bill) is
with the Multnomah ESD.

So, Microsoft had two representatives present? ;-)

Also, from what I've heard, while the DAS is "officially" against the
bill in its current form, they are generally for an amended bill that
makes it easier to get Open Source (or any products without a vendor)
purchased through the regular channels (which currently have no concept
of Open Source mostly because the purchasing process focuses on
comparing offers from *vendors* without regard to comparing *products*
that don't have any real vendor behind them).

Still, the most important thing that will (hopefully) come from this
bill is the mandate on providing data in an open format.  I, as a
citizen, feel I should not be required to purchase a proprietary product
to access information made available by the state.  As a government, it
is their duty to provide the information in a format that is accessible
to all its citizens, regardless of their philosophical leanings or (more
importantly) economic standing.  I'm sorry if the Microsofties feel that
this will somehow damage their "competitive advantage" by eliminating
the possibility for vendor lock-in in public institutions.  But that's
the way the cookie crumbles; as a private institution, you have no right
to use the state to coerce the public into purchasing your product.

Is there any way to find out which representatives have already cosponsored

Subject: [PLUG] Redhat 9 install on Asus P4GE-V
Message-ID: <003701c2ffd8$2ab810c0$e300a8c0@launi.com>

First off here is the error:
CPU 0: machine check exception 0000000000000004
Bank 0: A200000084010400

My hardware in test mode is all new:
Asus P4GE-V
2  512M DIM DDR PC2100
Western Digital 80GB drive.

I get this error when installing RH 8 (my download and burn), 9 ( a friends
download and burn) and Mandrake 9 from home burned CDs.  I have tried text
mode and still get the error.  The error consistently locks the computer
when the install goes to format the drives or is writing the packages to the
disk.

At first I thought it was memory, so I exchanged it, no joy.  I yanked out
all network cards and have only one hard drive. I removed my DVD-CDR and
used a plain old CD, no joy. I have switch memory to different banks and
tried one module, no joy.

So I thought it was the main board and was about to exchange it when I got
the idea to try my original WinNT disk.  Well to my surprise it installed.
Well then I tried my DVD for Mandrake 8.1 Pro-Suite and it installed.

My Mandrake 9 CDs installed flawlessly on my IBM A21p so I know I can
download and make ISO CDs that work.  I also had my RH 8 installed on this
box in a software RAID but I wanted to try RH 9 and change the RAID
configuration so the RH 8 disks worked once, but now it fails.

My questions: 

What does the error mean?
Is are there incompatibilities in home burned ISO images that affect
hardware?
Suse says that their disto works on this MoBo, should I try that?
Will commercial CDs of RH 9 work?

I'm going bonkers with this and have spent about a week futzing with this
box on and off.

Looks like a memory error. When you switched the memory to different
banks, did the error move?

If not, I'd suspect either the memory slot on the MB, or the chipset on
the mainboard.

It could be a flaky connector on the MB.

Not to my knowledge. However, I have run across ISOs that only seem to
burn properly at 4x and lower.

This S3 is for some unknown reason showing up as an Ethernet card.  It
is in fact a VGA card that is supposed to be the second video card in a
box.  I have no clue what is happening, or if I can just ignore it and
use it.

Sure looks like memory to me.  If the error is exactly the same after
you swapped memory sticks, maybe you have bad cache?  Have you run
MemTest86?

Not that I've come across, and I cannot imagine a scenario that would.

The commercial CD's will work about as well as the ones that you have
burned, there may be some _very_ old drives that the commercial pressing
will work on that the burned copies won't, but that is an all or nothing
deal, either it works, or it doesn't.

Good Luck,

ntpd runs on my RH8.0 workstation, but the time drifts over an hour a
day.

It starts at boot, is running whenever I check it, but the clock varies
wildly. I can have it log in manually and it corrects the time, but it
won't do it automagically.

/etc/drift said 0.00.

How can I fix this? There's no man file for it, and I need the clock...

Your ntpd is probably not syncing to a remote clock. Run ntpdc and 
type 'peers' at the prompt, e.g.,

[heinlein at pecos heinlein]$ ntpdc
ntpdc> peers
     remote           local      st poll reach  delay   offset    disp

If all you see is the LOCAL peers, then you're not in touch with any 
remote servers.

Mike,

  Are the secondary standards against which you sync still running, and are
you still connecting to them on a regular basis?

Kelly,

  The most important -- and meaningful -- thing to do is find your
representative and senator, then send each an e-mail (or letter)
beginning with the words, "I strongly support HB-2892 and I want to to
support is as my {representative|senator}".

  I was testifying in support of a bill at a senate hearing this past
Wednesday and discussing the process with one of the trade association's
lobbyists. The key is to make a loud noise. The louder the noise (i.e., the
more constituents from whom a legislator gets input) the greater attention
paid. Constituents -- not professional (or amateur) lobbyists -- vote.
Politicians are genetically selected for perpetuation of their elected
office. So, they pay very close attention to those who can re-elect them.

  If you've already done the above, send another e-mail with the same
starting sentence and add, "I want to remind you to continue supporting this
legislation as you focus on all the important issues that come to your
attention." Doesn't hurt to let them know you're paying attention.

It's just a hack: the clock can sync with itself just in case remote 
peers are unavailable. In /etc/ntp.conf, I declare the local host to 
have a high (i.e., low-priority) stratum number:

  server          127.127.1.0
  fudge           127.127.1.0 stratum 10

That way, ntpd never loses touch with all peers. There's always one 
around, even if it's itself. :-) Once the remote, higher-priority 
servers are contacted again, ntpd will re-sync with them.

I think what Rich meant to say here was: 


"I strongly support HB-2892 and I want you to support it as my
(Rpresentative/Senator)"




Proper English with good Grammer(things I sorely lack in) make a much
bigger impression than sending an email like:

"Hi Ya'll, we'uns wants youse to suppert this hyar bill thing what
makes Micorsoft look stupid."


Now, I can duck and cover for the coming responses.
Otherwise, the rest of Rich's post is VERY true. The more noise a
Politician's constituency makes on an issue, the more likely they are
to look at it. Unless, the opposition has made more noise.

That supports the mainboard theory. Could be a dirty memory slot. Could
be something more.

I have seen Windows of all flavors install on hardware that is known
defective. I've then seen these same systems run for several weeks, and
then fail with some BSOD. 

The fact that Mandrake worked says that it may be an intermittent issue.
You may have a memory slot that just meets specs, and then thermal
expansion sets in, and it has a problem. 

There are many reasons this could be happening.

Thanks for the feedback. I tried Win2k Advanced server and it locked up so
I'm going with the theory that a memory slot is bad on the MoBo.  I'm
yanking it now.

I hope that this fixes things.  Now I know why ENU no longer builds or test
computer systems.  After I get Linux going I think I will do a system burn
in before I put any real data on it.  Are there a set of Linux tools that
can test stuff like WinStone?

  That's appropriate: defective software on defective hardware. Made for

And I've spent an entire day (might have been two, except I got lucky at
the last minute) installing Windows NT 4 on a P4B (I think, don't
remember right now) motherboard because the IDE drivers that shipped
with NT didn't work correctly (i.e. were horribly horribly broken) and
were too dumb to fall back to PIO mode long enough for me to install the
correct ones from the CD-ROM that shipped with the motherboard. (Yes, I
manually disabled DMA, but it didn't help)

NT would install fine (well, after a really long time and a lot of
interaction from me; Windows is easier to install than Linux? HA! Never
has been, never will be) because the install drivers and the "working"
drivers were different.  Boot it up, any heavy disk activity would hang
the machine.  So you think, well, wait to install the server software
until you've updated the drivers.  All well and good except for one
small fact: installing the drivers involves heavy disk activity and
would hang the machine.  The problem was doubly bad installing from the
CD-ROM ;-).  
Compounding this irritation was the fact that the machine hung halfway
through installing IDE drivers, meaning that any future boot would
involve a BSOD very early on and without IDE drivers, recovery was
essentially impossible. This, inevitably, lead to another NT install
with the bloody mandatory format!!!! (why do NTFS filesystems take
FOREVER to format? ext2, ext3, ReiserFS, etc. take almost no time at all
unless you check for bad blocks).

So, sure, Windows might install on defective hardware, but it seems to
have a problem doing so on perfectly adequate hardware.

Bah, compile GCC, that typically requires GCC be compiled at least
twice; once with the system C compiler and once with the resulting GCC
(and frequently once more after that to make sure GCC compiled GCC
compiles itself identically).

XFree86 is another huge one.  Glibc is kind of fun, just don't f-up the
install ;-)

Recompiling your kernel is a good acid test, especially if you've got big
and fast enough hard drives that they aren't such a bottle-neck. The
Folding at Home client taxes CPU and memory fairly well without much of a video
or network load and I just saw a really good installation script for it at:

Subject: [PLUG] Redhat 9 install on Asus P4GE-V

First off here is the error:
CPU 0: machine check exception 0000000000000004
Bank 0: A200000084010400

My hardware in test mode is all new:
Asus P4GE-V
2  512M DIM DDR PC2100
Western Digital 80GB drive.

I get this error when installing RH 8 (my download and burn), 9 ( a
friends
download and burn) and Mandrake 9 from home burned CDs.  I have tried
text
mode and still get the error.  The error consistently locks the computer
when the install goes to format the drives or is writing the packages to
the
disk.

At first I thought it was memory, so I exchanged it, no joy.  I yanked
out
all network cards and have only one hard drive. I removed my DVD-CDR and
used a plain old CD, no joy. I have switch memory to different banks and
tried one module, no joy.

So I thought it was the main board and was about to exchange it when I
got
the idea to try my original WinNT disk.  Well to my surprise it
installed.
Well then I tried my DVD for Mandrake 8.1 Pro-Suite and it installed.

My Mandrake 9 CDs installed flawlessly on my IBM A21p so I know I can
download and make ISO CDs that work.  I also had my RH 8 installed on
this
box in a software RAID but I wanted to try RH 9 and change the RAID
configuration so the RH 8 disks worked once, but now it fails.

My questions: 

What does the error mean?
Is are there incompatibilities in home burned ISO images that affect
hardware?
Suse says that their disto works on this MoBo, should I try that?
Will commercial CDs of RH 9 work?

I'm going bonkers with this and have spent about a week futzing with
this
box on and off.

The '5.0.0.0' local address is the key: ntpd is unable to reach the 
remote hosts.

For troubleshooting, make sure

* you can ping those hosts

* your client has permission to sync with them:

  ntpd -q time.nist.gov
  ntpd -q clock.via.net

* you don't have a packet filter rule that's blocking ntp traffic

Typically, you don't need to be root to run ntpdc.

Mike,

You probably executed "su" instead of "su -", which means that your root 
session didn't pick up root's environment and, hence, didn't have /usr/sbin 
in its path.  See the su man page for more info.

I now return you to your ntpd thread.

Mike, Note that the "reach" column has a value of 0.  This means that you
are not actually contacting those servers.

You should see something like:

       remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset    disp
  ==============================================================================
  *stjohn.mainecoo prowlingtabby.m  2 u   30 1024  377    84.18   -6.820    2.58

the 377 indicates full connectivity.  If your clock is too far off you won't 
be able to synronize with the remote servers.

  But, ... but, ... but ... the IP addresses don't look right, there is no
'*' to indicate the primary/working standard, and the strata are so far out
to be nonfunctional. I don't think that ntp will check a standard with a
stratum that high.

  Also, _if_ you're really trying to sync to the primary standard at
nist.gov, then the stratum is 1, not 16. Secondary standars have strata of
2.

One of the non-typical cases being if you've set up pub-key
authentication.   Has anyone actually spent the time reading through the
docs to figure out how to do this?  It's been far to the bottom of my
TODO list for a while.  It seems like the sort of things that's
straightforward once you find a step-by-step tutorial, rather than a
reference.

Uh, how?  What benefit is there in syncing with itself?  Surely clock
A and clock A are _already_ in sync.  I think this needs a little more
explanation.

This is a followup to a private email I sent to Launi last night...

After getting to work this morning I consulted the Word of Intel (a.k.a.
Intel SMD, Vol. 3).  Turns out the MCE Status register might be indicating
a bad microcode patch checksum, rather than just a bad processor state and
fatal error (the IA32_MCx_STATUS register seems to indicate a simple status
error 0x4, which is the bad uCode patch error).

This could explain why NT loaded, but not some of the newer distributions.
The newer kernels may be trying to load a bad microcode patch into the
processor during boot.

Tried something older than RH8, or compiling the newest kernel on a
different box and booting it off a floppy?

Right. Somewhat unusually, ntpd can be (and often is) simultaneously a
server and a client.

In the typical case, you're doing two things with the local clock
fudge:

1. telling ntpd-as-server to activate the local clock and set its 
   stratum

2. telling ntpd-as-client that the local ntpd-as-server is the 
   fallback choice.

ntpd is typically configured to keep a drift file that constitutes
ntpd's best guess as to how the local hardware clock gets skewed over
time.

The drift file is written, but not consulted, when ntpd acts as client 
to a higher-stratum server.

When no remote server is available, ntpd will sync back to itself, but 
local-ntpd-as-server will consult the drift file, which presumably is 
a good guess as to local skew, so that local-ntpd-as-client can get 
the benefit.

In other words, the local ntpd-as-server, aided by the drift record, 
ends up being the "remote" peer for ntpd-as-client.

That's my understanding, anyway.

For years I've been scratching my balding head over the problem of
saving old emails, so they can be referenced and searched.  It's hard
enough trying to convert one's email archives for use with a different
client; but now I find myself wanting to receive email here on my
workstation and onto my laptop as well (you know, via WiFi while sipping
coffee somewhere).  Of course I can leave incoming mail on the server
long enough to grab it with both clients, which I do.  But what about
sent emails?  How can I keep all those archived in both places?  I
probably search my sent mail as often as any other.

Having just installed Spamassassin, I have much of the postfix
configuration still fresh in my head.  Is there, then, a postfix
solution for doing this?

The two clients in question are Mozilla on my lap and Sylpheed on the
workstation; so the mailbox formats are different, to begin with.  From
what I learned installing spamassassin, perhaps I could use a postfix
filter to save my outgoing mail somehow, or forward it back to myself
maybe (so it becomes inbound mail).  It may be nice to save it on the
server, since that would be a more permanent and reliable
archive--except that then I'd be archiving all my spam and attachments,
and there would be little organization to it.

So I'm just looking for suggestions.  Anyone ever tried this?

Thanx,

I am in search of a similar mechanism, having recently suffered a hard
drive crash and lost some of my email, mostly those sent from my desktop
and not on my server.  If it were in both places, I'd be safe on both
ends.

I believe this is a good job for imap, though I've never investigated
it.  Anyone?  I don't really know the pros and cons of imap vs pop, but
I'd like to.

I keep all my mail on my server and access it only through IMAP, using
Cyrus IMAP on the backend.  This lets me access mail through any MUA
that supports IMAP, which is almost all of them.  MUA will also let you
use a folder on the IMAP server as your 'outbox', so that's also stored
centrally.  IMAP also has an "off-line" feature, which lets you download
the mail, disconnect, then sync back up later.  Of course, you need an
MUA that supports it too.

If you can rely on a network connection, just read/send all your email
from one place that can be ssh'd from remote locations.

One related thing I've discovered over time is that I don't like
relying on normal "outbox" stuff.  I prefer to bcc myself a copy of
outgoing mail for the reason that it gets a set of full headers.  A
lot of my earliest outbox stuff (which wasn't bcc'd) suffers from
missing Date headers which makes sorting chronologically
dissatisfying.

My friends,

Just when I start to feel I'm grabbing hold of Linux, I do something *very*
silly...

After having made extensive modification the /etc/mail/access file, I
erroneously entered the command hash /etc/mail/access > /etc/mail/access.
This of course toasted the access file....  d'oh!

Question: Is there a slick way to "reverse-hash" the access text file from
the access.db file, or do I need to recreate this file from scratch?

Quite embarrassed,

Ah, interesting!  I've actually never used IMAP, so I didn't know it
worked that way.  This actually sounds like the solution I'm after
(though I expect another configuration ordeal).  To have a single mail
store on my server sounds ideal.

But Mr. Senior has reservations.  Can we get some more opinions on the
POP3 vs. IMAP debate in this thread?  Can I run both at once with the
same postfix install?  Is IMAP slower on the client than POP?  Is the
date header thing really a problem?  I'm willing to install Cyrus if
it's worthwhile.

Thanks agin',

Very ideal. I didn't know there were people out there still using POP3. 
Sure I suspected there *might* be, but I still can't fathom why.

The MTA (postfix) has nothing to do with the MUA.  You can happily run a
pop3 and imap server together, provided they're set up correctly ;-)

IMAP tends to be faster on the client because the client doesn't need to
download all of the messages all at once.  In fact, I doubt if I've
*ever* downloaded the bodies of 75% of my PLUG mail, simply because the
subject didn't interest me.  IMAP is designed in such a way that the
typical IMAP client only downloads the message headers, waiting to fetch
the bodies until you're actually ready to read them.

Cyrus is certainly worthwhile, given that the other popular option is
from Washington University and therefore falls under the old axiom
"avoid software produced by UW or WU."
(And yes, pine does qualify as its authors have routinely ignored
security complaints, but I digress).

There are other IMAP options that may be more suited to your
environment, Cyrus works best on a dedicated mail server without user
accounts, while some of the others require user accounts be present.

Please, lets all make the world a better place and kill off POP3.

Thank you, Cooley and Shepard, but this sounds a little like overkill,
especially since my laptop only runs Win98.

What I really want is a central, server-base mail store, rather than a
GUI client making guest/ghost appearances over ssh.

Again, more comments on POP vs. IMAP would be useful.

I _usually_ use a GUI, even remotely (X11 over ssh).  Flipside is that
I don't have to (emacs has a text-mode too).

And anyway, if you are flung way out at the end of a tether you
shouldn't be surprised if you have to make some compromises.

Yes you could in theory, have you ever tried to run, say, evolution over
ssh?  Makes outlook look speedy.

I run evolution and access the server via imap, I even store sent-mail
in an imap folder, so everything is on the server.

Well put, Shahms.

I've been using Courier-IMAP at home. It reads mail stored in maildir 
format, which Postfix and Exim both support. I use Fetchmail to pull 
mail off my ISP's POP3 box and deliver it to my mail server to avoid 
using a POP3 client. IMAP clients are plentiful, including a few 
web-based mail clients that don't suck, such as Squirrelmail. Most can 
use SSL tunneled IMAP / IMAPS.

Once you get used to IMAP, POP3 will give you a nasty rash.

As this is my main objection to IMAP, I have to ask: can you reference
any clients that do this?

I find that it's much more convenient for me, since I generally read all
of my email (or at least skim it) and since I don't generally have a
particularly fast connection to my email servers, that it's far more
convenient to tell Evolution to go get all my email, and come back to it
10 minutes later, rather than having it get all the headers, then having
to wait 20-30 seconds per email. 

IMAP is, however a more intelligent protocol (or implementations are
more intelligent), as when I was using IMAP, I never had the problem of
a client downloading the same email twice from the server, which I get
all the time with POP3 (proxies REALLY confuse most pop3 implementations
unless you always access your email from one place through the proxy)

I used to run X11 emacs over ssh on a 33kbit modem and it was
tolerable, though it took a while (~2-5 minutes, IIRC) to start up.
With broadband, I hardly notice I'm not local.

I do the same thing with pine, though I have two imap stores: one at 
work and one at home. I just tell pine "when sending mail as work-me, 
keep an fcc in {work}sent-mail; when sending mail as home-me, keep an 
fcc in {home}sent-mail."

It just works.

Also, I use the UW imap server, which stores mail for me in plain old 
mbox files...

well emacs is not evolution.  I don't use emacs, but I suspect that
emacs does not use a lot of x bandwidth with decorations.  runinig
evolution over the internet to my home machine 144kbps connection is
intolerable, (minutes to come up).

By "this" I assume you mean off-line support.  Evolution (at least 1.2;
I don't recall 1.0); Netscape/Mozilla (I think).

Ken,

Do you disagree with the amendment itself or just because we did not
specifically discuss the word "published" in the meeting?

For the latter, I am afraid that the written amendments were submitted
late yesterday afternoon and I had received them only earlier today.

If you have an issue with the word "published" in section 8(f), please
let me know.

Okay, so it's one of those "hands down" things, then.  Good.  I'll have
install Cyrus and then to try to get Evolution running.  (No success a
year or so ago, but maybe this time.  If not, then Mozilla will do.

Okay, this spurred me to try again with my setup.  The idea is to have one 
machine sync to the outside, then all others on the lan sync to that one.

For some reason, I cannot reach my server by name--even with an entry in 
/etc/hosts.  My ntp.conf file uses the ip addy anyway, but when I run peers:

ntpdc> peers
      remote           local      st poll reach  delay   offset    disp
=======================================================================
*LOCAL(0)        127.0.0.1       10   64  377 0.00000  0.000000 0.00095
=philo.localdoma 5.0.0.0         16 1024    0 0.00000  0.000000 0.00000

somehow it resolved the name, but as you can see, no connection.

My version of ntpd doesn't have -q, but since I can't do 'host philo', it 
wouldn't work anyway.

Main question: how the hell do you get the machines to resolve by name? 
This used to work until I upgraded one of the machines.  Presumably, my 
gateway router is handling the internal dns stuff, but shouldn't a direct 
entry in /etc/hosts override?

When I ntpd -q, I get no return. I mean that the terminal never comes
back...

I chose no firewall at setup, and don't seem to find iptables on this
PC, is there smething else that would preventing that port? (the
firewall passes it, other machines get out and the clock updates when I
go to the place to set up a new time server (right click the clock and
select "adjust date and time)

I don't know where to go from here.

Never mind about syslog.conf.  I Read The Fine Manual.  And I lied: I
_had_ figured syslog out before, and then promptly forgot about it.
However, when I na?vely tried sticking:
 
   kern.debug<tab>-/var/log/kern.debug

in there, and kill -HUP'd syslogd, that didn't seem to do the trick
for me.  Nothing is showing up, so I guess there must be another knob
somewhere.  Hints anyone?

Ken,

I apologize if I have offended you. I encourage you to take a look as
DAS's standards document here:

  http://spr.das.state.or.us/standoc.pdf

>From this document you can clearly see that their "Selected Standards"
for Operating Systems are, "GUI, DOS, Windows 98, and Windows 2000;"
their "standard" productivity suite includes "Office 95, Office 97, and
Perfect Office." While the document does not address document standards
directly, it is reasonable to assume .doc, .xls, and .mdb on the client
side, and NDS, Exchange database, etc. on the server side.

What I am proposing is not a huge amendment. This "single word"
amendment calls only for the standard to be published to qualify as
"open."  This helps ensure that the State's data is protected over the
long term; it means that a developer 10 years from now can use a tool
(or build one) that can read the data because the data conforms to a
published standard. 

Further, a system that conforms to a published open standard is less
likely to contain code that "phones home," potentially compromising the
security of the State's data. It still allows the flexibility for
"cookies," for example because they are documented as a standard by the
W3C.

This is important to me, Ken, because I have had to walk into my boss's
office before and say, "we can't make a simple but critical change to
the production inventory tracking system because the software vendor
doesn't support our platform anymore, our consultants can't change the
system without the source code and the company has refused to release it
to us under any circumstances."

Again, I stress that I support the rest of DAS's amendments so this
should not be a "show stopper." I am confident that together we can see
this to a beneficial outcome. 


Sincerely,

Playing devils advocate here, because I believe in what I perceive to be
happening with OSS. 

Be very careful with that word "open" and make sure it is defined
specifically. 

When I read this message, I looked at it, and the first thing that came
to mind was, "That's what you put on a resume, when your salary is open
for discussion." 

In other words, in certain contexts, someone, somewhere could take that
"open" to mean that it's not defined. That any format is acceptable. 

Now, it's entirely possible that I'm reading this wrong, and there's a
subtext that I'm missing. If that's the case, please disregard this. 

And thanks for listening.

There are things that bug me about Sylpheed as well. It does however
handle IMAP pretty well IMO. It's one of the few clients I've seen that
allows you to completely remove local mailboxes, which has always been
one of my main pet peeves about most mail clients when I'm using IMAP
exclusively on them. 

Unfortunately as far as I know it does not support offline IMAP.

Russell,

Take a peek in iptables(8) and look for the LOG target along with the 
attendant --log-level and --log-prefix options.

If, by way of a trivial example, your INPUT table's default policy is
DROP, then your rules might look like

  iptables -A INPUT -p all  -i lo -j ACCEPT
  # other accept rules
  iptables -A INPUT -m limit --limit 12/m \
           -j LOG --log-level INFO --log-prefix "DROP: "
  iptables -P INPUT DROP

This particular LOG rule limits the number of log entries to 12 per
minute, to avoid a DOS based on log flooding. YMMV.

I encourage all to seek enlightenment from Webster. In this magical book
you will find many definitions for the word "open", all of which are are
arranged in order of precedence. In the case of the word "open", there
are at least 3 definitions that directly relate to Open Source within

Yeah, I know about the LOG target.  I want to know where the
CONFIG_NETFILTER_DEBUG printk's are going.  But, also, thanks for
bringing up the LOG target, because it made me think of a way I can
look to see what is going on ... but it doesn't answer my original
question.

I am beginning to think that there is a problem in recent 2.4.x
kernels (including 2.4.21-pre7) between the netfilter stuff and
"advanced routing" (? la policy routing).  It appears that DNAT'd
connection replies are getting routed _before_ their source address is
translated back.  This breaks source address based routing rules (see
iproute2's "ip rule from <foo> table <bar>").  Normal source address
based routing works fine, but DNAT in that context seems to break.  My
understanding is that the DNAT'd connections should be translated
before routing takes place, both inbound and outbound.  Trying to
drill down to find out what is going wrong.  I thought it was working
before, but am now wondering if maybe it just worked for me by
accident.

Application is in the context, young apprentice, and one that contains
language such as "Published Open Standard". In the event that further
interpretation is needed, what is an honored judge to do? Look it up
(and yes, we have seen them do just that).

I'm in the market for a TV card (with frame grabber (?)) to watch and 
capture video input and possibly a new Video card as my current one is 
getting to the 'vintage age' in computer years and may not handle the new 
and interesting stuff I'm playing with - plus maybe multi-headed.
   I went looking yesterday using google but a lot of the information on 
TV cards is 'vintage' :-)  So hopefully someone has some cutting edge 
(not bleeding) suggestions.

The absolute best would be a multi-headed (2) video card with TV input and
an onboard frame grabber chip.  The next best would be a multi-headed
Video card and a TV card with onboard frame grabber chip.  While I'm
wishing the ability to handle HDTV would be sweet.

Heck if you want to enlighten and correct my (mis)conceptions on the topic
I'd appreciate that also.

Ah, I see now.  E.g., in net/ipv4/ip_nat_rule.c:

   #if 0

   #else
   #define DEBUGP(format, args...)
   #endif

They are being defined away.  If I _really_ want to see them I need to

Judges do not always ``look it up" in a Webster's Collegate dictionary.
Most -- if not all -- will consult Black's law Dictionary. My copy --
admittedly an old version -- has two definitions for the word ``open":
as a verb --

``To render accessible, visible, or available; to submit or subject to
examination, inquiry or review, by the removal of restrictions or
impediments."

and as an adjective --

``Patent; visible; apparent; notorious; not clandestine; not closed,
settled, fixed, or terminated. Pratt v. Bloggs, 171 Ky. 106,
186 S.W. 901, 902; Dale v. Hartson (D.C.) 289 F. 493, 495."

Black's also provides definitions for the terms ``open a case",
``open a credit", ``open a street or highway", ``open bids", ``open court",
``open fields or meadows", ``open season" & ``open theft."

Does the proposed bill provide a definition of the term ``open source"
that means substantially software that is provided with the source code,
& the user is allowed to modified that source code to her/his benefit?

These kinds of linguistic nitpicks are necessary, I'm afraid, because people 
who oppose laws spend a lot of time and legal talent looking for nits to 
pick, and loopholes to exploit. That is why significant portions of contracts 
are given over to definitions.

Thanks again to everyone who is working on this legislation.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0304121539190.30064-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I understand that linux -- as with all unices -- can operate in both
peer-to-peer and client-server network modes. For many -- if not most -- of
the end-user apps we use here (e.g., OO.o and gnucash) the client-server
mode is more desirable because there's only one copy of the executable
installed and everyone works off of that. Easier to maintain and so on. In
prinicple, at least.

  However, a lot of end-user apps have their binaries installed (by 'make
install' or by a package manager) into /usr/bin and /usr/lib. I don't know
how, in this case, to make those binaries executable on other hosts. What I
end up doing is installing (and upgrading) a copy on each host.

  Trying to export /usr from the "server" host doesn't work well because
there's no way of nfs-mounting it on another, client, host. And I don't know
of a way to install the OS _without_ /usr/bin.

  I'm sure that I've missed something very simple all these years, but since
I just upgraded gnucash from 1.6.6 to 1.8.2 on two machines the question
came up again: just how is such an application installed once and used
across the network?

TIA,

Rich,

Do you want to the application to execute and display on each 
workstation, or is it within bounds for it just to display?

If the latter, then just use ssh, e.g.,

  [workstation]$ ssh -f serverhost soffice

Or, with less security

  [workstation]$ telnet serverhost
  [serverhost]$ export DISPLAY=workstation:0.0
  [serverhost]$ sofffice

If the former, then you either

* install the binaries, libs, and resources on each machine
* install the binaries, libs, and resources in a nfs directory

The situation is tough when you're dealing with just a couple hosts. 
On a larger network, it's easier to justify the time needed to build a 
package (deb, rpm, ...) of the app in question. On a two- or three- 
node network, it's harder to justify the packaging time.

  Perhaps, Geoff, you have blazed the path out of this thread and Cooper's
Conundrum!

  Perhaps the bill could exchange "source" for "standards" and require the
equal consideration of open-source and proprietary software, where open
source is defined as "rendered accessible, visible or available; submitted
for, or subject to, examination, inquiry or review by anyone not in the
emply of the provider by the removal of restrictions or impediments".

  Would this suit everyone ... here?

Paul,

  If two of us are working simultaneously -- on different data files,
obviously -- then it needs to execute twice, no?

  In this case it comes as a RPM package. But, the package installs into
/usr/bin.

  I've had this discussion with a couple of folks vis-a-vis Slackware. In
that distribution (I suppose it's true with Red Hat, too), everything on the
installation cdrom goes into /usr. As a naive, non-professional SysAdmin I
would like to have all end-user apps optionally installed either into
/usr/local or /opt (if such a partition exists). That way either /opt or
/usr/local could be nfs-mounted across the network and not affect the
underlying GNU/linux kernel and utilities.

  Wonder why it doesn't work that way. In slack, even AbiWord is installed
in /usr rather than /usr/local. Sigh.

Just a dreamer,

Rich

Linux will typically share code in memory so it's run twice but not using as 
much memory as if it was actually run twice.  Did that make sense?!

You can telnet/ssh to a machine on the LAN and run the app there with the 
display being on the PC in front of you.  So, it's running on the Server and 
being displayed on the Client.

You should also check out the Linux Terminal Server Project (www.ltsp.org).

Your post brings up one of the primary disadvantages of Peer-to-Peer 
networking - maintaining seperate copies all over the place.  Client-Server 
computing gives the huge advantage of central administration (typically in 
one place, not many). Thin clients are the epitome of this model where the 
client doesn't even need its own hard drive.

Subject: [PLUG] Renew IP address
Message-ID: <1050195975.1219.2.camel@localhost.localdomain>

What is the command to renew my ip address?  I have a computer that I
set up on a 192.168.0.0 network and will be switching it to a
192.168.1.0 network.  These addresses are coming from a cable/dsl
router.  I've had trouble in the past switching computer between these
two routers and have had to set IP address statically.  Service network
restart does not do it.  I understand there is another command that does
the same (equivalent to windows ipconfig /release ipconfig /renew).

Any help is greatly appreciated.

  I've noticed that sometimes 'restart' doesn't work in Red Hat init scripts
even though it is present. I've not used the 'service' command, but I have
found that '/etc/rc.d/init.d/network stop' followed by
'/etc/rc.d/init.d/network start' usually clears the constipation and bits
once again freely flow.

Can't imagine that "restart" does something different than "stop" "start"
The script /etc/rc.d/init.d/network case statement does the same thing

  	restart|reload)
         	cd $CWD
         	$0 stop
         	$0 start
         	;;

Unless a matter of microseconds makes a difference to the hardware--
not to rule out the metaphysical space that occupies a CPU's thoughts 
bewteen 2 subsequent calls.


/sbin/service is a small shell script that does what you typed above with a 
little sanity checking.

I take it the question is how to renew the dhcp lease.  Maybe `killall 
dhcpcd -HUP`  (substitute the name of your dhcp client.)  When this starts 
driving you insane, you can

# grep -r 192.168.0.0 /etc

To see where your old unwanted ip is hiding out. and start fumegating.

Turns out my dhcpcd (1.3.22pl1-7) doesn't come back from a HUP.

Right. If a large portion of the app's functionality comes from shared
libraries, however, then the amount of memory needed for the second
instance is relatively low.

In fact, I'd be really surprised if even your lowest-powered 
workstation couldn't support multiple users working at the same time.

Hmm. I guess I don't get it. What's the hassle of doing 'rpm -F' on 
two machines. It sounds like a really easy solution to the problem.

For simple binaries, that's easy to do. rpm supports installation in 
non-default paths via the --relocate option.

Some apps, however, have a difficult time with relocation; just about 
any package that installs stuff into /etc falls into that boat.

There's a long discussion to be had about the merits of system
installation versus completely modular installation -- but I'm too
tired right now to launch it...

ifdown eth0

ifup eth0

these should read from a file called /etc/network/interfaces, where the
interface should be defined like this for dhcp:

iface eth0 inet dhcp

Rich,

Here's a suggestion.  You could build and install the desired apps on the 
server using source and configure them so that their components are installed 
in nontraditional places.  For the purpose of this example, let's say that 
you install the software and associated libraries, man pages, etc. under 
/usr/local/remote_apps so that executables are in /usr/local/remote_apps/bin, 
the libraries are in /usr/local/remote_apps/lib, and so forth.  For software 
built using the common configure/make combination, you can configure these 
locations when you construct the make file using the configure script.  Type 
"./configure --help" to get a list of the arguments to configure for the 
given app.  Typically, you would want to set the prefix when running the 
configure script using a command like

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/remote_apps

Once you have built the software and installed it in a nontraditional place, 
then you can export the nontraditional directory tree to the remote machine 
without disrupting the remote machine's operation.  In my example, you would 
export /usr/local/remote_apps and mount it on /usr/local/remote_apps on the 
client.  Then users can use apps from the server on the client by simply 
adding /usr/local/remote_apps/bin to their paths.  Also, if you need to build 
software using shared libraries in the nontraditional location, e.g. 
/usr/local/remote_apps/lib, simply add the nontraditional library directory 
to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig.  (Of course, if you do this on a client 
machine, you'll need to mount the remote directory tree first.)

This is also very rarely possible to do with rpm packages.  Some rpm packages 
are "relocatable", which means that you can specify a root for the 
installation that differs from the default location during an installation, 
upgrade, or freshening.  See the INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS section of the 
rpm man page for more information.  However, rpm builders almost never make 
their packages relocatable.

Debian or Slackware packages probably have similar facilities.  But I am 
completely ignorant on this topic.

Of course, one of the keys here is centralizing software installation.  If the 
users currently have the capacity to install software on their own machines, 
this could annoy them since they'll have to wait for you to install software.  
You also have to have enough bandwidth and processing power on the server to 
handle the expected level of activity over the nfs mount.  And the apps will 
run slower (or at least load slower) even under the best circumstances due to 
the latency of the nfs mount.  Furthermore, the architectures of the client 
machines have to be compatible with the architecture of the build machine or 
you have to build executables and libraries specifically for the client 
machines.  However, despite these caveats, I can report that there are places 
that very successfully use this technique

I hope that this helps.

Hey, that's cool, I now know how to search a man page. That'll make
things a lot easier.

Here's what it took to make me happy:
# .bashrc

# User specific aliases and functions

# Source global definitions
if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
        . /etc/bashrc
fi

Rogan- That looks very cool. It must work differently on your machine
than it does on mine, because it refuses to show me the directory
structure for me, which was the main goal. I did steal the time idea,
though.


Thanks again
Mike

I always alter RH's /etc/bashrc because I too like the full path in the 
prompt (most of the time) by just changing the W->w.  This way all users 
benefit from my preference--of course, I'm the only user.

The only colorization I do is for root's prompt. In /root/.bashrc

# Make root prompt noticable
if [ `id -un` = root ]; then
     PS1="[\[\033[1;31m\]\u\[\033[0m\]@\h:\w]\\$ "
else
     PS1="[\u@\h:\w]\\$ "
fi

Message-ID: <20030414022238.GA3878@sthelens.dimstar.net>

I'm moving my mail server from RH 7.2 to Mandrake 9.1. Most everything
appears to work, except procmail isn't reading (or using) my
~/.procmailrc. I get the following error in my logs:

procmail[5160]: Suspicious rcfile "/home/russj/.procmailrc"

I've googled, and found many pages tellimg me to set the permissions
properly. Some say 644, others say 640... I've tried both, as well as
744, 733 and a couple of others.

No change in the message above. 

There is another user on this system using procmail as well. 

I looked at her file, and it's perms are 744, and she doesn't get the
message. So, I tried setting mine that way, no go. Her .procmail is
being used, as I checked the log file. 

Nothing I do appears to make a difference, and I can't see why mine
isn't being used, but the other users is... 

Any ideas out there?

One more try, and I'm replying to this so I get some mail... :)

I just googled AGAIN(!) and found where your home directory can't be set
to allow your group to write... I checked, and this is set 755 on the
user that works. I've set mine like that... Now I'll see....

I have no idea how to approach this and so far I have seen no one who
has had this problem.

When printing from Abiword, the hardcopy prints out in a cursive,
italics style font I don't recognize.   This happens no matter what font
I choose for the document, what size, or what style.

Anybody have a clue where to start on this one?

That fixed it... 

Make sure the permissions on the file .procmailrc, and the directory it's in, only
allow the user (not the groups, and especially not everyone) to write.

Jason,

On the MUA front, I have been using squirrelmail
(http://www.squirrelmail.org) since testing it for a client last year. I
access it from https to utilize SSL and I find it very nice. My drafts,
sent and trash are kept on the server. I have broadband at work and home,
but ovet spring break I checked mail from my sister-in-law's AOL account
and it was a champ. It was sure nice not having to set up any IMAP account
info and then remove it.

Make sure you give security a good thought if you are accessing your mail
over a insecure network such as the internet.

Keith

Subject: [PLUG] Problem of NO ROUTE TO HOST in sending emails
Message-ID: <3E9ACC50.8080402@icare.com.hk>

Hi all folks,

Just join this list.

I encountered problem in sending emails with KMail and Ximian Evolution

I have 2 PCs running RH7.3 and RH8.0 respectively, both suffering the
same problem in sending email with KMail and Ximian Evolution.  The
"sent-mail" box of KMail has record indicting that the email has been
sent but never sent. /var/log/maillong said "No route to host"

Ximian Evolution entercounters the same problem.  But Mozilla Mail is
different  It works correctly in sending and receiving emails   The
settings of "Send/Receive mails" are exactly the same throughout KMail,
Ximian and Mazilla Mail.  All use the same broadband provider with
dynamic ip address.

I have been playing around with "ntsysv" to select/deselect "sendmail"
with no possible solution.  The only discoveries were

1) when "sendmail" was activated, the RH7.3 box took long time to detect
it at starting the PC.
2) Deselecting "sendmail" could not hinder "Mozilla Mail" sending
emails.  It still works without problem in sending/receiving emails.

Also I have been playing around with /etc/resolv.conf adding an IP
address of the ISP although he only provides dynamic IP address,
including disble iptables and ipchains but no solution found. However
any changes made did not affect "Mozilla Mail" at all.

Any advice?

Thanks in advance.

B.Regards
Stephen Liu

What program(s) are between Abi-Word and the printer?  What does the
print command look like when you print something correctly?

I used "lpr -Plp1" (in case your fonts are screwy, that is
"ell-pee-ar-space-dash-capitol-pee-ell-pee-one") in the Custom location,
with the printer setting, Generic PostScript, the text came out in the
specified Times Roman on the remote printer specified as lp1 (or
"ell-pee-one") in my /etc/printcap file.

Give us more information!

Hello Linux folkz,
My dad's using Mozilla as his MUA.
He can read and write e-mail messages in German, English and Russian.
However, when he tries to print any Inbox message in Russian or
German the printed output looks like pseudo characters except headers.
Though, he can print all e-mails in English without any problems. 
Could somebody please give me a hint how to fix this problem or what
to check in configuration files.
Many thanks in advance.

Not sure what else there is to say.

I am using RH7.3, Abiword 1.0, the printer is lp0.

When I preview the print job, it comes out as printed.  Which is to say,
it previews in the wrong font just like it prints in the wrong font.

However, when I change the "lpr" command in the print window to lpr
-Plp0, I get an error message saying that lp0 does not exist even though
that is what my /etc/printcap shows as my printer.

New info:

I tried "lpr -Plocal" and that printed but still in the wrong font. 
Strange that it is local, but it is what it is.

Alex,

  Make certain that the appropriate type faces are installed on his machine.
I don't know the numeric designations, but I do know that there is a
Cyrillic type face available. Also, it may require unicode capabilities
being enabled.

Does anyone know of a good utility for managing image files?
Something that lets you look at the images as thumbnails and is
tied to a database so you can pull up image sets based on
various criteria.

  Neither. They are foundary specific. I know that they're available as
TrueType fonts for Windoze and I know that there are Adobe PostScript Type1
fonts available, too, because folks using LyX and LaTeX write in many
languages, including Hebrew and Arabic.

I'm still tweaking a backup script.

So far I'm good with:
mkdir -p /home/ofsbu_`date +%y%m%d`
cd /home/ofsbu_`date +%y%m%d`

This makes the dir I put the files into and gets the files in the
correct dir. Works like a charm.

Now, I want to compress the dir into a single file with the date and
name intact. I've changed the script to drop the date and then compress
it with the date in the filename, but no workee.

I've tried zip but it won't let me specify the date as a filename:
zip -mR9 ofsbu-`date +%y%m%d`.zip ofsbu/'

Is there a way to make zip put the date in?

Is there a better way to do this?

My favorite image viewer is called feh.  It has a thumbnail mode.  But
tied to a database?  I'm not sure what you mean by that.  Upon what
criteria would you be looking for images?  If by file attributes, such
as size and extension, just use find.  find + feh = fun!  For example:

feh -FZ `find . -iname *.jpg -a -path *toon* -a -size +15k`

There's an RFC , I believe 1519, that defines Private class C
networks in CIDR notation.  How is 192.168.0.0/16 a supernet for class C
networks?  I believe that the latter idea of classes was based on ranges
of  octet bound numbers where the current idea is based on how many 
bits are in the subnet mask.  This isn't completely correct through 
because certain numbers are known to be special such 
as 192.0.2.0/somenumber which is supposed to be used for test 
nets and 0.0.0.0/0 which is a broadcast special address.  Help.

Will ipv6 have private addressing?  Is ipv6 addressing going to
support ipv4 addressing as the lower half of an ipv6 number?
How does ipv6 with 128 bit numbers not pose a problem for the
routing infrastructure?  Will ipv6 be used at the home level or
just on backbones, at research locations, and on certain
campuses for training?  Is ipv6 restricted to hex notation
for addresses?  Will ipv6 need CIDR or is it more flexible for
getting the correct number of hosts for a particular network?

Michael,

I don't really understand your question.

192.168.0.0/16 is the total boundary of the IANA-unassigned range that 
may be assigned to private networks (along with 10/8 and that funky 
set in 172.16/12 or whatever it is).

If you want a class-C-style network in the unassigned range, then just 
pick one, e.g., 192.168.33.0/24.

Has anyone tried an online course for Cisco training?

What references electronic and print are most helpful?

What does the training and certification cost?

What does it cover?

Would you fo it again?

Are there classes in the Portland area?

What level of knowledge is required to complete the training and in what 
areas?

Any other comments?

Of the course options, are there accredited verses non accredited options
and how does one choose?

How long does getting Cisco certified take?

If I use this 192.168.0.0/16 or 172.16.0.0/12 in a firewall for class A and
class B can I use them to block all private class B and private class C
nets?  I read about the old classes and it seemed that they were only
defined by the netmask.  Yet, not any old number that could be considered
a class A, B, or C network by merit of having the correct netmask is
equal?  There seem to be special nets that could have the netmask
of a Class A, B, or C network or is this not true?  Can I write any dotted
quad number, based on ipv4 syntax, and given the netmask for a Class
A, B, or C network it won't be outside of those classes?  Is it correct to
say that there is a loose idea of classes, superseded by VLSM, and 
another idea of ranges of numbers that are supposed to be used for 
certain types of nets?

192.168.nn.yy where n is the variable part of the
network number defines the private range of class C?  
However, there are other ranges of class C also.  How 
are the other ranges of class C defined?      

I know a class C network is defined by a 24 bit netmask.  
I'm trying to understand how to use supernetting to refer 
to multiple Class C nets as it is used in a firewall I'm 
looking at based on iptables.  I'm trying to learn iptables
coming up from ipchains.

The class B boundary blows my mind.  16 in binary is 2^4.
But CIDR notation is the leftmost bits that are 1 I think meaning
that 172.16.0.0/12 would refer to this: 

11111111 11110000 00000000 00000000.

The latter doesn't appear to be the binary representation of 172.16.0.0 at 
all and if I remember right the upper bound is 172.31.xx.yy for class B 
private networks.  What am I missing here?

The latter I have done.  Trying to figure out a firewall scheme though knowing
the broader picture of how addressing works is important.  For one thing there
are martians, XMAS tree packets, NULL packets, spoofed packets...  I believe
the firewall I'm looking at has the philosophy of know the addressing and only
allow addresses being used by you to stop illicit traffic.

I sure hope ipv6 addresses make more sense!  Couldn't something similar
to Novell addressing that doesn't seem to have problems be adopted for
the Internet without abandoning dhcp, dns, private/public addressing, etc?

I think the answer is 'yes.' Here's what I did back when I was using 
Linux/iptables for my home firewall:

# ------ snip -------

iptables=/sbin/iptables
if_ext=eth1
any=0/0
unassigned="0.0.0.0/8 10.0.0.0/8 127.0.0.0/8 169.254.0.0/16 172.16.0.0/12"
unassigned="${unassigned} 192.0.2.0/24 192.168.0.0/16"

for net in ${unassigned}; do
  $iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $if_ext -s $net -d $any -j DROP
done

# ------ snip -------

Is that what you're asking?

">" is a redirect to file.  In the shells that I know (bash and csh) it
redirects standard output STDOUT to a file.

the "/" on ofsbu was there from your example.  It really does nothing
except make it very clear that you're dealing with a directory and I
think it's completely optional.

CIDR = Classless InterDomain Routing

The key word is "classless".  Classless routing allows us to do cool
things like supernetting, subnetting, and non-standard'netting. :)

The RFC defines the 192.168 space as a supernet: 192.168.x.x is really
what it is saying.  This means that 192.168.47.0/24 and 192.168.0.0/24
are both in a private range.  If you saw 192.168.0.0/16 in a routing
table, it is most likely a summary route (all 192.168.x.x routes.. go
this way).

Looks good, question is how do you allow legitimate
local nets now that A,B, and C are blocked entirely ?  
Do you add a specific allow for, i.e. 192.168.33.0/24,
to the PREROUTING table ?  Is spoofing were you lie
about the source address to get past a firewall or 
through a router ?  Wouldn't the latter be a malformed
packet and thrown out anyways ?  Don't the source
and destination addresses in any ip packet have to be
on the same net ?

The machine in question was dual-homed, so I trusted the interface 
plumbed to my LAN (on a 10.x.x.x subnet).

It would probably be best to forget all about classful networks, as
the classful boundaries don't really mean anything anymore. But
a quick Google on "ipv4 classful boundaries" reminded me:

      Class A networks: Describe the range of networks from 1.0.0.0/8
through 126.0.0.0/8.
    *
      Class B networks: Describe the range of networks from 128.0.0.0/16
through 191.255.0.0/16.
    *
      Class C networks: Describe the range of networks from 192.0.0.0/24
through 223.255.255.0/24.

That's the binary representation of the netmask. 

A "0" in the subnet mask means we can have a "0" or a "1" in the host
number. So:

10101100 00010000 00000000 00000000	172.016.000.000
11111111 11110000 00000000 00000000	255.240.000.000
10101100 00011111 11111111 11111111	172.031.255.255

So we get 172.16.0.0 through 172.16.255.255.

If you want to block all Martians, then you'll need to keep up with Rob
Thomas's Bogon List. Note that this includes networks that haven't been
assigned to registries, but may be in the future, so you need to keep up
with the updates to it as new networks are assigned so as not to block
what turns out to be legitimate traffic.

    I'm surprised there isn't something like DNS queries to find out whether
    or not a historically unassigned net is a martian or not today.

    Is there an area where I could use user defined chains and put all my
    Martians in there so that it's easy to change the Martian list later 
    without flushing other rules?

    Does a user defined chain have to be associated with a particular
    table in iptables?

    BTW: Is there a way to deny smtp connections to any client I
              can't do a dns query on.  This would probably stop a lot
              of spam.

Don't know what would do that, but it sounds like another interesting
project.  You could probably manage something with text files and a
little script fu, but it would be a definite hack.  Like, make a text
file next to each image, as "my-friend.jpg.txt" in the same dir' as
"my-friend.jpg", fill those with your descriptions, and then your script
could grep them.  But there's got to be a better solution.
 I'd probably just put a table in my database for this and make a
servlet interface, but that's just me.

Message-ID: <20030415000106.8333.qmail@goose.robinson-west.com>

The default io address that etherboot seems to expect for an ISA ne2000 is 
0x300.  I have gotten etherboot disk images from www.rom-o-matic.net.  I am 
wondering if there is a way to chage the io default.  The kernel options are 
just that, kernel options for after etherboot initially detects the network 
card.

Has anyone had success with flash cards or putting etherboot into the flash 
bios?  Right now I use floppies, thing is that requires having a disk drive 
where the etherboot program is designed for going into a rom.  Choosing 
the local option when using a disk doesn't work unless the floppy is 
ejected first and I want to take the disk drive off a machine in some 
cases.

Does the FA312 have flash capability?  Does anyone make predone
etherboot roms for the D-Link de220pt ISA ne2000 clones?  There is
an open source eeprom programmer, I'm wondering if anyone makes
and sells it at a reasonable price as many folks sell cantennas?

This looks like Abiword is not configured to access printable fonts.  I
seem to recall that there is a fontification how-to for Abiword, but I

The thing is, until I changed from RH 7.3 to Mandrake 9.1, it worked
fine... 

So procmail on RH (from RH) evidently doesn't do that... Or it's a
relatively new feature... 

I suspect the former, since RH gives each user their own group.

Howdy.

Last week, Pacifier upgraded their mail server to a cluster. They
also upgraded their bsd shell server to a sunOs, and changed the
logins to it. ie: my login used to be brucek, and now it's
brucek.pacifier.com

Any how, the fetchmail script doesn't work anymore. And they claim not
to support linux - meaning that they can't even tell me what they
changed so that I can fix my end.

Anybody else using pacifier to fetch mail from? if so, do you have any
clues as to what I need to do to start getting my mail again?

For the interim, I'm logging into my shell account and reading
messages online in pine, so I can get your answer.

TIA,

Subject: [PLUG] iptables gateway firewall working, what do I need to do...
Message-ID: <20030415091131.8949.qmail@goose.robinson-west.com>

to migrate to a RIP2 environment so that my two Internet 
gateways can automatically substitute for each other?  
Ordinarily to open a gateway I set the default 
route to the external address on that gateway instead 
of the lan address of a substitute gateway.  All workstations 
behind need to know which gateway to point to since 
there are two to choose from now.  If a gateway is down, 
the default route of lan connected hosts needs to change 
to an available substitute. 

I guess I need to get more than one ip for this to work although
I wouldn't mind a manual switch so that essentially two gateways
are up, but one always has a broken connection.  It wouldn't be
perfectly automatic, but throwing a switch isn't a big deal.  Using 
a manual switch, wire changer, I guess both gateways could be 
configured with the same ip on their external interface since they 
wouldn't be simultaneously media connected to the DSL bridge.  
On the other hand, $5 a month for the extra ip's to permanently 
connect my two gateways simultaneously is probably a better 
idea.  Not to mention, doing the latter would allow me to have 
a backup dns server for robinson-west.com for the first time.

I'm running Redhat 7.2 on two identical P-III's using a 386
as my backup gateway.  I don't know if I can put 7.2 on the 
386 which currently runs 6.2 within 20 megs of ram.
If I set the X server up as a gateway how do I firewall X,
tftp-server, and ltsp from the outside world?  Can dhcp
funciton on a dual homed machine?  Is dhcp 3 production
and does it support redundancy?  Can samba wins
servers be made redundant or is it better for me to
distribute an lmhosts and password file to all clients?
Maybe I should move my samba domain controller to my
mail machine even though I fear I'm loading all the
services onto it.  Is there a safe way to tie the processing
power of my two identical servers together so that load
balancing is less of a concern without compromising
firewall integrity by having raw processing somehow
end up on the Internet?  

Now that I'm looking at two gateways how do I test for and
prevent loops?  A loop being where traffic goes out one 
gateway and comes back in the other.  Lan traffic should
go direct to the server, not out onto the Internet first.

porting/adding/whatever NetWare to linux, or vice-versa. As a non-sysadmin
who used netware back in the Pleistocene of microcomputers, I am curious to
know what benefits NetWare brings to a linux network in a business

  In my naivety I acknowledge that NetWare did (does?) things like file
sharing very well. But, adding it to a natively-multiuser/multitasking OS
seems to me to be carrying coals to Newcastle.

Pop3 is pop3, so it SHOULDN'T matter what OS they are running on. Is it possible that the dots in your new user name need to be escaped?

  I'd greatly appreciate having one of you rpm gurus explain this error
message to me as I tried to upgrade from VMware-3 to VMware-4:

[root at salmo /home/rshepard]# rpm -Fvh VMware-workstation-4.0.0-4460.i386.rpm 
VMware-workstation-4.0.0-4460.i386.rpm: read manifest failed: Success

  Why do I get a "success" when the read manifest (whatever that is) failed?

Only the shell login name changed, pop3 mail is the same as it ever was.  If 
you've got a virtual domain through them and get your mail another way then 
I have no idea.

We have a Netware 6 server that is doing file sharing.
Netware 6 supposedly can work in SMB/CIFS, NFS and
AppleTalk protocols. Tomorrow our Novell consultant
will be attempting to get all this working, which
would allow my Linux box to connect via NFS, our Mac
users to connect via AppleTalk, and Windows clients to
connect without needing the Novell client installed on
their systems.

Obviously, 'read mainfest' was designed to fail and did so successfully...

I take it the package did not freshen.  Suspect a damaged download.  Try 
'rpm --checksig VMware-workstation-4.0.0-4460.i386.rpm' which may tell you 
if the md5 sum matches (what I'm not sure).

Scott,

  Does Netware do anything that linux doesn't do as a server? Other than the
expense you've already incurred for Netware, is there a technical advantage?
Again, I'm just curious, not challenging anyone on this.

Message-ID: <00f901c3036c$ef7f6240$1f01a8c0@ot.onsitetech.com>

Hello,

We've lost our Python programmer and need another.  We've already started
interviewing but we need a broader pool of candidates.

We've been building a large GUI application in Python that uses wxPython and
connects to a server via XML-RPC (server is written in Perl, but Zope may be
an option).  Most of the interface is already built, we just need the final
features added and we anticipate a couple of months of work.  However, we
have other Python projects planned, so this position should be considered a
temp-to-hire position.

Required skills:

1.  Python
2.  OO design

Desired skills:

1.  wxPython and PIL (Python Imaging Library)
2.  Perl.  We're primarily a Perl shop, so it's helpful if
$programmer->can('communicate')
3.  XML-RPC
4.  Database normalization
5.  Design patterns
6.  Zope
7.  Threads

You might notice that our "required" list if fairly small.  We believe that
a strong programmer who communicates clearly can learn what needs to be
done.

If you're interested, please submit a resume and code sample to
jobs at onsitetech.com.  Resume format can be text, HTML, pdf, or MS Word.

Cheers,
Ovid

Not to forget Novell's NDS. This is the first major x.500 Directory
Services database that hit the market (it first shipped in the very
early 90's with Netware 4). It's the most extensible, stable and
reliable of all of the "production" x.500 based services on the market.

Just had a discussion with a coworker that was left unresolved due to
lack of experience on our part.  Is it possible to hide email addresses
on your web site by using a php or javascript script to buidl the
address?  What if all email addresses come from a text file?  Are those
crawled too?  If your whole site is generated dynamically can it still
be harvested?  Can google index it?

  Do you have a robots.txt file on your home page? It's _supposed_ to let
you control what bots can see and what they cannot. Of course, my copy --

Yes, see Slashdot archives.

I'd guess that most spiders only parse HTML, and not more unusual
formats like ASCII, PDF, doc, xls, etc.  But ask yourself this, how
hard is it really to do MIME-type detection and custom backend
processing on the spider?

> If your whole site is generated dynamically can it still
> be harvested?  Can google index it?

The spiders follow links just like users do, so any content on your website
that can be reached by a link can be searched/indexed.

This behavior is exploited by the spider honeypots/SPAM traps to tie up
resources on the spider's computer.

Note that this is also something that can be used to protect email addresses.
Suppose you have to make a list of email addresses available on the web but
you don't want them to be easily searchable.

You provide a 2-page solution via CGI or other programmatic method.
Page 1 is a list of names with radio buttons (all default off) and a
submit button.  A human will select a name and press submit and get an
email address.  A spider will probably just follow the submit link,
which can be a frontend to a SPAM trap.

It's a little less convenient to your users, but it provides a measure
of protection for the people with email address on the site.  It also
doesn't scale very well to a general purpose email address solution.

There's a story on /. today about how one of the 'Super DMCA' bills
recently passed in Michigan has made certain security research illegal and
caused that research to move out of state.  You can find more info about
the situation here: http://www.securityfocus.com/news/3912

The EFF is tracking these bills in several states. Here in Oregon
Senator Charles Starr is sponsoring SB655 (See:
http://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/states/ )

There is some speculation that these bills might even make firewalls and
NAT illegal as well as anonymous posting.

You might want to drop Senator Starr an email at
sen.charlesstarr at state.or.us and ask him about it.

Regrettably, the robots.txt file is ignored by spammer's email harvesting
programs.  The robots.txt is a "keep off the grass" sign that they're not
obligated to respect.

One strategy, if you don't want the overhead of PHP or JavaScript, is to do
a static replacement of all email addresses with their HTML entity
equivalent.  For example:

  not at home.com

You can convert that to:

&#110;&#111;&#116;&#64;&#104;&#111;&#109;&#101;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;

If you want to convert an entire mailto link, it looks like this:

<a
href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#110;&#111;&#116;&#64;&#104;&
#111;&#109;&#101;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#110;&#111;&#116;&#64;&#104;&#111;
&#109;&#101;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>

Believe it or not, your web browser will still recognize that as a valid
mailto: link, allow you to click on it and will still display it correctly.

If you want to utilize this technique, but don't want to change a bunch of
HTML documents, here's a bit of code that can do the following (WARNING:
the following is a couple of minutes worth of work and should be considered
*pseudo-code*.  Back up your work).  It takes a directory as an argument and
recursively travels through the directories beneath it, converting all email
addresses below the __DATA__ tag to their HTML entity equivalent.

Aack!  That was such a poorly worded email.  My major booboo:

That should have said "... don't want to change a bunch of HTML documents by
converting to PHP, writing extra PHP or Javascript code ... blah, blah,

One day I'll learn to proofread.  I promise :)

Netware handles Groupwise, which is why we use it.
Eventually I would like to find an open source
alternative to Groupwise, if one exists, one that
would be as good or better than Groupwise. If
Groupwise were gone, then I would work toward
migrating the file services to a Linux SMB server.

Netware works just fine, but I don't know very much
about administering it, so to simplify our network and
avoid a large learning curve, I'm working toward
getting rid of it.

Right now we have several NT4 servers, two Netware
servers, and some Linux servers. One Netware server
was turned off last week, after we migrated its
services (only MTA) to our remaining Netware server.
If everything continues to work well on the new
server, then I'll set up the old Novell box with Linux
instead.

I'm gradually removing responsibilities from some of
the NT4 boxes and putting those responsibilities on
Linux servers instead.

  Ah! I wondered about that as a lot of spam comes to "info at ..." which

Specific Netware feature(s) I'd like to see replicated elsewhere: 

1)  Deleted file restore is awesome - don't have to go to tape to restore a
file, just browse out to the diretory, select salvage files, voila.  Saved
many man hours in many jobs for me.  You look the hero as the sysadmin, and
it's simply built into the Netware OS.  To get the same sort of thing for NT
or Unix requires buck$, from what I've seen.  If someone can show me similar
functionality, I'd be ecstatic to see it.

2)  File permissions - It's so easy to modify permissions, restrict
permissions, etc.  No one else seems to have been able to make it so easy,
and yet advanced control features also.  (allow permissions to inherit or
restrict inheritance of permissions as you go down a folder)

Non specific to Netware:  They do have a nice directory services... Zenworks
management of M$ O$'s is pretty nifty.

>From what I have seen of the Novell marketing plan - (granted, they don't
pay attention to us anymore, as we haven't bought anything in 2+ years, so I
don't hear from them often anymore) - they don't care so much if you run
Netware - they just want to layer their other services over whatever
platform you are running.  example, they wanted awhile back to make NDS
(Novell Directory Services) work on UNIX/Linux, so they did.  They want
people to use Zenworks, regardless of what file server you are using, so
they made ZENworks work under NT and I believe planned to do it under Linux,
also.  (LINK HERE: http://www.novell.com/products/zenworks/sysreqs.html) 


One of the more odd things I've noticed lately was that at one of the
Netware brain trust events, they are having a seminar on how to make Apache,
Mysql, PHP work while running on Netware.  While I don't completely grok why
someone would want to do that, hey, it's neat that it's happening.

  I just read an article from LinuxWorld that Novell is
porting/adding/whatever NetWare to linux, or vice-versa. As a non-sysadmin
who used netware back in the Pleistocene of microcomputers, I am curious to
know what benefits NetWare brings to a linux network in a business
environment.

  In my naivety I acknowledge that NetWare did (does?) things like file
sharing very well. But, adding it to a natively-multiuser/multitasking OS
seems to me to be carrying coals to Newcastle.

A curious mind wants to know,

Subject: [PLUG] Setting up backup qmail server...
Message-ID: <20030415231345.10455.qmail@goose.robinson-west.com>

Do I need to set up imap accounts with the same usernames and user id's 
as my original mail server on the backup box?  Do I need to use NIS or ldap?  
I'd prefer to have both of these boxes work autonomously and not depend on 
each other for authentication, otherwise I defeat the idea of a backup.

How do I configure the backup server to attempt relaying mail recieved to 
the original mail server where I want the mail to be read?  I prefer to relay 
through the local network connecting my servers instead of the Internet.  I 
also want to relay backup mail server generated mail to my mailhub also.

I'm thinking that backup mail exchangers should not allow reading of the
spools they are holding though I am not certain what common practice is.  

If I understand correctly, a backup exchanger attempts to send messages 
recieved during a main failure to the primary exchanger which should recieve 
them as soon as it is back up.  What concerns me are mail overflow 
situations, situations where the main goes out of service simply 
because it is recieving too much mail.  The backup in this case may 
make it difficult to get the main back up since it will likely be flooded 
with mail also that it will relay to the main as soon as the main comes
back online.  I guess the main when it comes back up should not
accept mail until the backups have completely emptied.  At this time
the backup, being emptied, shouldn't accept new mail either?  The 
mail capacity of my site with the backup the way I'm thinking is two 
mail servers worth.

I'm using qmail.

Novell, for the longest time, was a staunch supporter of the IPX
protocol. Only with Netware 5 did they finally get close to out of that
protocol and even then it was still - in most installations - required
internally to the server. Not connecting to an IP network with native IP
throws up a giant roadblock to those would-be crackers with an eye on
cnn.com. There were a few known exploits associated with the
BorderManager product (Novell's proxy/firewall product offering) but
they were short-lived since the folks in Provo jumped on those issues
straight away.

Also, the product followed a strict adherence to certain code practices.
For the most part there was only one compiler that would allow properly
built NLMs, and only those NLMs that were built on this compiler were
honored by the OS. For the life of me I can't remember the name of that
compiler (senior moment I guess). This practice put virus, worm and
root-kit(ish) code to a non-existent state on Netware - the compiler was
very expensive. I do know that they have backed off on that a little in
NW5 and up with the allowance for .DLL code (but there are still strict
code practices so not just any M$ junk DLL will run). Of course, all of
this just rat-holed Netware, who wants a server that requires this much
overhead to run applications.

Another thing that kept them tight was the BSD style of "install
nothing, give no rights". Adding users meant that the user had nothing
until you gave it rights. Adding the OS meant that it was a pristine
environment, you had a file server without permissions until you added
services and data.

I have heard from many sources that Netware's security
record is impressive.  Yet I know someone who works for U.S.
Fish & Wildlife that says that Netware was dumped for NT
because of number of users or Netware didn't integrate well
with Windows or something.  I tried to take a Novell course
at PCC but 98 and Novell just don't get along and the materials
for the course were contradictory where one chapter would
say one thing while another chapter would say the exact
opposite.  The course seemed to be more geared toward a
political than a practical approach, a waste of money.
Instead of focusing on a specific way to answer questions
I really wish the course would have focused on understanding
the Novell Netware 4.7 environment more.  At the time the
concern was about Netware 5 and I think the quality of
education slipped. 

Ironically, Netware 5 is touted because it use the ip
protocol where I thought the point of using Netware
was to get away from the ip protocol with all it's
inherent security protocols.  Look at the complex of
a good netfilter firewall when your lan uses ip and
it's no surprise there's good reason to use a 
different protocol for your lan.  Just think, all the
RFC's, 1517,1518,1519.1520, which talk about
renumbering lans because of routing issues 
could be ignored.  With Netware only one
box needed to be special to be able to go out
on the ip networks.

There has been some question as
to whether or not Linux users need Novell integration
and I for one have wondered why Novell didn't open source
NDS.  At least if Novell licensing was cheap enough I bet
it'd go a lot further than NT.  Netware, NT, and exchange etc.
have been around long enough that I would hope to see
an open source standard for providing the same services
develop.  Just the valuable services that are worth keeping
thinking specifically of exchange server, whatever that is.
On the other hand maybe integrated software isn't the way
to go.  There's something to be said for simple programs
that are well defined and perform their tasks correctly.

What's the GUI front-end to cdrecord/mkisofs for RH8 and up these days?
Anyone have an open-source product that they really like (or ones that

xcdroast is the one I use.  If you have redhat 8.0, you might want to get 
a current version of the program.  (They ship a pretty old one.)

Cheap enough? Try free up to 250,000 users:

http://www.novell.com/products/edirectory/promo.html

While I dont' know the restrictions of use for their promo, I'd say the
promise is there that it's pretty cheap.


Does Linux need Novell integration?  No.  But, open systems play better, and
when Novell works hard to stay compatible with other solutions, I think it's
a win-win situation.

Was Netware 4.7 a typo? I've been through 4 revisions of that OS and can
tell you that I have not had that experience (but then, I never took an
instructor led course, it was all hands on and challenge).

Actually, NDS is based on the x.500 spec, as is LDAP, so in a sense it
is available - just undeveloped in this world, but it's gaining ground.

Another point too, Novell's market share here on the west coast has been
hammered pretty hard by Bill and his minions but the concentration of
Novell users in the mid-west and east is still pretty strong. Opening
those installations to Linux and open-source, that is both stable and
compatible, would be a real boost for the Linux community (not to
mention regaining some ground for Novell).

I personally like gcombust, I'm sure it's somewhere in some RPM.  It's a
gtk project, so you need those libraries, but it works well.

Mixed feelings on gcombust.  Not sure if it comes with RHL 8(.0 ;-) but I 
have it on my system and can't remember long enough ago as to how it got 
there.

My issues could be with my hardware.  A SCSI CD-R bought 5-6 years ago.  
Gcombust always reports I can't determine the size of the drive.

But I do use it and have never taken the time or effort to look for 
something else.

Mike Neal studied a lot of Netware but he said to just stick with Linux now.
I'd like at some point to either adapt the Netware protocol philosophy prior
to 5 and develop an open source protocol replacement for ip that works 
under Linux and any other OS that wants it or get a different kind of Novell
training.  I like online do it yourself better.  I need to know in a short 
period of time why I'm studying something and enough about shortcomings,
etc to not come out the other end with nothing useful.
 
I still think the licenses are too expensive for Netware and the failure
to advertise/develop Netware as an OS agnostic product will probably
prove fatal for the environment in the future.  Caldera Openlinux was an 
interesting notion, but Novell should have developed a product that 
brings Netware to a standard Linux environment.  There is good stuff
in Netware but Novell as a company is probably no better than Microsoft,
an intractable problem.

It would be interesting to develop a different operating system than Linux 
with Linux as the inspiration that is geared toward workstation use with the
intention of having Linux as the server.  The reasons to do this are: be able
to use a network filesystem that is better than samba or nfs, have a
workstation system with better networking than Windows, and achieve 
simpler configuration than Linux.  Develop a lan networking protocol and 
use that with your workstation Linux-like OS removing all ip stuff.  Get X 
working cleanly and steal one idea from 98, a graphical device manager.  
Don't borrow the having to reboot all the time issue.  On top of this, 
develop your workstation targeted Linux-like OS to be network bootable off 
your Linux server so that you don't have to have a local hard drive to use 
it.  This is where a network filesystem that intelligently uses a ramdrive to 
read a file out of that it needs to retrieve quickly really starts to matter. 
Especially when net speed is limited to 100 mb/s.  Abandoning ip allows
using a better networking protocol and securing ones lan can be made
easier with an intelligent plan and the absence of the ip junk.  
Abandoning samba abandons the myriad of issues that it inherits
from trying to support Windows networking.  Abandoning the need for a
local hard disk makes the system more valuable than Windows giving it
flexibility.  Intelligent use of a ramdisk makes this system better than an 
LTSP solution, unless there's a way to use a ramdisk enhanced network
filesystem instead of NFS.  Most importantly is for your linux-like
workstation OS to be small footprint and open source.  It would be wise
to solve the different header files for different versions of the same library
and other similar compilation/upgrade issues which seem to have gotten
out of hand.

Thanks Folks! Since RH finds it inappropriate to ship things like Mesa
and libglut in their dist's I find it really difficult to get a lot of
apps running, without jumping through many hoops. Just getting tired of
manually doing the mkisofs/cdrecord thing an it looks like xcdroast is
first on the list.

Thanks again,

It worked for me, but I started in the days of NW286 so it was a natural
progression (crap, I am having a senior moment)

Your right on all accounts here. Remember though, SCO purchased the ATT
code from Novell. Interestingly enough, they didn't sell most of it.

Huh?

$ rpm -qa|egrep -i '(mesa|glut|redhat-release)'
XFree86-Mesa-libGLU-4.3.0-2
glut-3.7-12
XFree86-Mesa-libGL-4.3.0-2
redhat-release-9-3

Mesa, glut, and OpenGL stuff is on my 7.3 box too.

Hello,

I'm in search of a good used laptop with at least:

600+ MHz processor
256 Mb memory
DVD drive
a working battery

that will run linux (probably Gentoo).

If you have or know of such please let me know.

Thanks,

I bought a reconditioned Thinkpad TP600 directly from IBM
which quite happily runs RedHat 7.3 and will probably
even more happily run Gentoo. They insist on shipping
them with Windows, but it wouldn't hurt to ask them
again, maybe someday they will change their policy.
The only real problem I have had with it is that 
I ran the system for a long time plugged in to the 
wall and this really kills the battery life. 
So if you are using it this way it is a good idea 
to remove the battery.


Here is where you can find them

Sony Vaio's do a pretty good job with Gentoo.  I've got a PCG-F580 that 
does very well with it.  Though the battery kicked the bucket a little 
while ago.  So you might be able to track one down.

For the uninitiated what is Gentoo compared to Redhat or Debian, Mandrake or
Slackware?  What are gentoo's strengths?  How does one get Gentoo?  What
size Linux distro is gentoo?  Does gentoo adhere to Linux standards base?

No, they didn't change the login for the mail server, altho I tested
that too. They are on imap now tho.

And the domain name of the shell server: shell1.pacifier.net

And the critical point: the IPs have changed yet again.

So, maybe someone can fill me in on the security issue of advertising
an IP address.

Subject: [PLUG] graphical calculator and a tip on the Pacifier problem...
Message-ID: <20030416073743.11364.qmail@goose.robinson-west.com>

I was asked about a graphical calculator like the one under Windows 98 for 
kde on a Redhat 7.2 system.  My sister used bc but it's not as easy for simple
financial stuff.  She also wants quicken but a google search turned up that 
there is no Linux version and that there is some Java substitute, but you 
have to buy it and convert your data files.  Trouble is people feed their
Quicken stuff into TurboTax.  Is there any replacement for TurboTax under
KDE or better yet GNOME.  I say GNOME is better as it seems that gnome
applications don't have to have gnome unlike KDE apps.

About the pacifier problem.  How about using some sort of port scanner or
ethereal?  Probably don't want to do this, but isn't there a safe way legally
to find out by what ports are open that it's imap now instead of pop, etc.?
As far as the login changing can't the ISP tell you about this in more detail?
If they don't support connecting Linux to their network who does?  I see no
problem with supporting Linux but evidently a lot of companies do where I
hope this changes in the future.  For one thing, Linux is the number one
infrastructure OS on the Internet today ( unless BSD has that spot ).

I would think you have to advertise an ip address for a server.  This is what
a DNS record does, right?  Is the ip one is connecting from normally non
resolvable, "hiding" the ip, or, is this hiding something different?  I've 
run into a lot of notices on the Internet that I need to stop advertising my 
own ip for better security.  Seems like security through obscurity to me.  
If you have an Internet ip you can be connected to even if you
are harder to find than a name that can be resolved by an Internet
nameserver.  Maybe the notice is about having open ports.

I've not tried this with nfs or smb so I'm not sure it works with network

http://www.m-arriaga.net/software/libtrash/


>From the README file in the tarball
-----------------------------------------
libtrash is a shared library which, when preloaded, will intercept
calls to a series of GNU libc functions and make sure that, if an
attempt to destroy certain files is made, these won't be permanently
destroyed but rather moved to a "trash can".  It also allows the user
to mark certain directories as "unremovable", which means that calls
to functions which would result in the loss of files under these
directories will always fail, leaving those files untouched in their
original locations.

(This last feature is meant as a higher-level substitute for ext2fs'
"immutable" flag for use by those of us who rely on other file
systems. An important difference is that libtrash allows
non-privileged users to use this with their personal files.)

The GNU libc functions which can be overriden/"wrapped" are

- unlink();
- rename();
- fopen() / fopen64();
- freopen() / freopen64();
- open() / open64().

You can individually enable / disable each of these "protections"; by
default, only calls to the first two functions are intercepted.


libtrash works with any GNU/Linux program, both at the console and
under XFree86, and operates independently of the programming language
the program was written in. The only exception are statically linked
programs, which you probably won't find.

So that calls to the different GNU libc functions are intercepted,
you must "preload" this library. This is can be done in two ways:
either edit /etc/ld.so.preload or set the LD_PRELOAD environmental
variable.

It's not RH8. There's a possibility that I hurt something in the past
few months, I'm pretty hard on this machine, but I didn't have a need to
rpm -e anything and those packages don't exist here.

Most interesting, must be something in the original installation that
excluded these. No worries though, the source exists.

Removing the battery also removes the surge protection
that the battery gives you.

Thanks, I will do that. I do have a compact surge protector
I bought for another purpose that will do quite well
for protecting my laptop.

This has been my "Golden BB" for several years. I'm addicted to keeping
my finances on my computer, and in turn, reconciling what my bank and my
computer say on a fairly regular basis (several times a week). 

For me, the important part is having an app that will connect to, and
download the transactions from, the bank, automatically. So far, only MS
Money and Quicken do this. Unfortunately, both are Windows only. 

The only way I can do this, is to run VMWare with some form of Windows,
and then run the financial app of my choosing inside that. I suppose I
could dual boot, but that means I have to shutdown my linux box, and
then, what's the point? 

I've heard noises that Quicken will run in wine. I've never been able to
get anything other than notepad and solitaire to run in wine. Even those
were unstable, and didn't seem very reliable. I just wouldn't want to
trust my financial data to something that crashed while running notepad.
At least VMWare doesn't crash.

Check out Budget Computers in Beaverton. They are just off of Canyon and
217.
They have a good variety of used laptops from lease returns. They even have
a Linux guy working there. I bought my IBM T20 from them. It had 1.5 years
left on warranty.

Redirection is your friend. :)

*/10 * * * * /command/to/run >/dev/null 2>&1

What this does is pipe the output of the command (standard out or
STDOUT) to /dev/null and the output of standard error (or
STDERR) to the same place.

I've heard noises that gnucash is almost there with your bank download
requirement. It works in Germany and it works with the OFX protocol. Which
banks use OFX today? I don't know. Check their web-page www.gnucash.org for
details:

- OFX Import:
    GnuCash is the first free software application to support the Open
Financial Exchange
    protocol that many banks and financial services are moving to use. The
development of
    OFX and HBCI support has also resulted in an improved transaction
matching system that
    more accurately picks duplicate transactions.
- HBCI Support: 
    GnuCash is the first free software application to support the German
Home Banking 
    Computer Information protocol which includes statement download,
initiate bank 
    transfers and direct debits.

Probably not, as Cisco has discontinued the 600 line. I wasn't able
to find one when I was looking.

I ended up getting the "Qwest approved" replacement, the Actiontec 1520
or something. It works, seems ok. Has a slot for a pcmcia wireless card
but I haven't tried that.

I'll often redirect to a file without appending so you can see the results
of the most recent run.  This generally doesn't use much disk space, and
it can be really helpful when troubleshooting.  For example:

*/10 * * * * /command/to/run >/var/tmp/run.cron.txt 2>&1

If it's the same place I'm thinking of, they also have an older guy
working there who acted openly hostile when I told him the pcmcia nic I
was looking to purchase was for a laptop running Linux.

While some banks allow for a manual OFX file download, it pales in
comparison to the simplicity of Quicken's downloads.  Intuit makes special
arrangements with a number of banks to support direct downloads in
Quicken's special format.  This means that the end user doesn't even need
to visit each Bank's website-- Quicken does it for them.

I run Quicken in VMware mostly since Windows patches break Quicken 2002
rather badly.  This allows me to run a heavily firewalled copy of
unpatched Windows used only for Quicken.

My big gripe about Quicken is that it doesn't make it easy to do
accrual-based accounting.  If your March gas bill gets paid in April, it
blindly assumes you had no gas payments in March, and a really harsh
payment in April-- which makes the reports inaccurate.  (Don't even get me
started about the mysterious ways in which Quicken calculates some of its
reports.)

At some point I plan to use Quicken for data retrieval, but export to
GNUCash for reporting.  This has been "planned" for quite some time, but
if I ever actually do it I'll be sure to pass along how well or poorly it
worked.  ;-)

One of my customers has one and the wireless works okay with the right
card (I think you have to get an Actiontec).  We had some strange
problems when we tried to change the DNS addresses DHCP handed out.

  I've signed up at the Cisco on-line University.  It's all been recently redone.  It looks like pretty good info.

  Cisco prints tons (literally) of books.  Powell's (Technical) carries new and used copies.  The student manual for the CCNE is pretty much mandatory.  I've been told that the test is taken directly from the book.  There's a lot of additional information on the web.  

  Several people recommended that I pick up a couple of routers on eBay to play with at home.  It helps build up "finger memory" by doing actual configurations.

  You are not required to attend training.  You just need to pass the test.  I'm actually doing self-study.

  Cisco networking stuff.  See the study guide.

  I attended the first two weeks of the PCC course.  The course was set up for *very* entry level students.  I dropped the course after the in depth introduction into making CAT-5 patch cables.  It was a little basic for my needs.

  The Cisco office in town has also been sponsoring a study group.  I attended a couple of times, but ran into a schedule conflict.

  It depends... there are "Boot Camps" that claim CCNE in 5 days.  The PCC courses take several semesters.  It depends on what you start with.

Subject: [PLUG] Adding a Type 1 font to XFree/Gimp
Message-ID: <1050533564.8461.48.camel@ida.dylanreinhardt.com>

Hi all,

I've got a Type 1 font I want to use in Gimp.

>From what I gather, Gimp simply uses whatever fonts X makes available,
and thus there should be no difference between "installing fonts in
Gimp" and "installing fonts in X".

Here's what I've tried (per various docs):

1. Put the file (_grg____.pfb) in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1
2. Run type1inst to re-create the fonts.scale file.
3. Examine fonts.scale and note the addition of this entry: 
_grg____.pfb -adobe-graphite mm-regular-r-normal--0=0-0-0-p-0-iso8859-1

4. Run /usr/X11R6/bin/mkfontdir to create fonts.dir
5. Examine fonts.dir, see same entry as in fonts.scale.
6. Restart X
7. Launch Gimp

Having done that, I attempt to use the font... Gimp has it listed, but
also says it is not available.  It won't, for example, show a preview.

I also tried the above, using mkfontscale in step #4.  Didn't help.

Gimp seems to be looking for some other file that is slightly different
from the font.scale entry.  It appears this one difference is due to the
point size requested.

I've looked at Type 1 fonts that *do* work and they seem to follow this
same pattern of looking for a slightly different file name than what's
in fonts.scale.  In all such cases, slocate is unable to come up with
files of those names.  

Other details:
 - File permissions are 0444.  
 - XF86Config *does* reference this directory
 - Also tried xfs to no avail
 - XFree86 4.3.0 r1 on Gentoo

Does anybody know what (probably obvious thing) I'm missing?  

Thanks in advance

Dylan

The advice should've been not to have a secondary MX if your primary MX
is always available.

The reasons spammers target secondary MX servers are:
1. They hope the policies are lenient on the secondary (usually due to
   not having authoritative account information held locally).
2. They believe the secondary will not be faster due to most mail routing
   through the primary.
3. They don't think anyone examines the logs on the secondary.

The reasons to have a secondary MX anyway are:
1. Scheduled or unscheduled maintenance on the primary MX.
2. Network outages.
3. Too much load on the primary.

Of course, you can just make the remote site queue until the primary MX
is available, but some consider that practice taking advantage of
spool space on the sending servers...

Subject: [PLUG] Setting up backup qmail server...


Do I need to set up imap accounts with the same usernames and user id's
as my original mail server on the backup box?  Do I need to use NIS or ldap?
I'd prefer to have both of these boxes work autonomously and not depend on
each other for authentication, otherwise I defeat the idea of a backup.

How do I configure the backup server to attempt relaying mail recieved to
the original mail server where I want the mail to be read?  I prefer to
relay
through the local network connecting my servers instead of the Internet.  I
also want to relay backup mail server generated mail to my mailhub also.

I'm thinking that backup mail exchangers should not allow reading of the
spools they are holding though I am not certain what common practice is.

If I understand correctly, a backup exchanger attempts to send messages
recieved during a main failure to the primary exchanger which should recieve
them as soon as it is back up.  What concerns me are mail overflow
situations, situations where the main goes out of service simply
because it is recieving too much mail.  The backup in this case may
make it difficult to get the main back up since it will likely be flooded
with mail also that it will relay to the main as soon as the main comes
back online.  I guess the main when it comes back up should not
accept mail until the backups have completely emptied.  At this time
the backup, being emptied, shouldn't accept new mail either?  The
mail capacity of my site with the backup the way I'm thinking is two
mail servers worth.

I'm using qmail.

The Backup mail and Backup Gateway machine is a 7.2 Redhat box
which I am currently building.  The gateway is a 386 so I don't want
to put a backup mail site on it because it is too slow, I run
6.2 on it.  The Mailhub is also a 7.2 Redhat box.  I am running 2.2.14
and 2.4.20.  The problem on the 386 is the DI30 tape drive, otherwise
I'd run 2.2.20 or newer.

I don't have two ip addresses yet but I'm planning on getting a block
of eight soon out of which five are usable.

Well, 'talk' may be a bit inaccurate.  This will be more of a show & tell.
I'm planning to bring circuit boards for some of the various projects
we have worked on over the past few years.  In particular, I'm hoping
to bring an example of the O-gauge model train we worked on.  Questions
will be encouraged, as I won't have much of a formal presentation.

I've seen a product called DataVision used for open source reports.  It's
a java based program as well.  Not sure if it will be able to connect to
your database.  Scares me to know a database is running in java.  hehe.

Give it shot, I heard datavision is pretty buggy since it's new.  You
should be able to go to your favorite search engine and put in datavision
to get the site's url.

If you like GUIs, there's Kugar (part of the K-Office suite). I haven't
tried it yet, but it's sitting happily on my Knoppix boot CD, where I can
try it out without having to install it on a hard drive anywhere. There are
probably others, but that's the first one that jumps to my mind.

If you don't like GUIs, there are numerous languages that can be used for
report generation, including perl, python, and ruby, just to name a few.

No. It is support for the IPX protocol that is included in the Linux
kernel source tree - not NCP. You can configure a Linux box to route
IPX packets but without additional software, such as mars-nwe, Linux
cannot speak NCP.

Also, don't confuse the ability to mount NetWare volumes as support
for NCP.

Finally, NCP is still the native protocol for all versions of NetWare,
including all versions beyond NW4.

Cooper... chill out, dude.

It is not appropriate to carry this discussion onto a bunch of LUG

The companies who create dictionaries do so based upon words that people
use.  That is dictionaries do not create or define the language.  People
define and create the language.  When a new term is coined and widely used
passed a certain threshold, dictionary makers start putting it in the books.

Dictionaries are reactionary reference guides rather than definitive
reference guides.  Thus, being not definitive, it probably wouldn't hold in
court.

Look again Ed, NCP is in the list of Network File-Systems in make config
for the 2.4.20 kernel (I only assume that it works, it's rather unlike
this community to add modules that intentionally don't). You might want
to take a look, it does describe that as the component to "Mount Netware
volumes".

True, NCP is still in use for all current versions of Netware but the
NW4 version was the source that our linux kernel piece was based on
(this was released as experimental in version 2.2.<something>, I
discovered it when building an RH6 box a few years ago. I can not
testify to how well it works since I have never had a need to use it but
I do remember the tissy that Novell threw when the source was released. 

Oh yeah, after working with the Netware OS since the early 80's I don't
think that I'm apt to confuse NCP with IPX.

Hey list--I've set up a small mailing list in my sendmail alias file, and 
I'm wondering how to get the thing to put the list address in the 
'reply-to' field of emails.  Right now if bill at coho.net sends a message to 
the list it goes out to list memebers as 
from: bill at coho.net
to: list at xyz.org
and folks who respond to the email have to 'reply to all recipients' in 
order for the email to go back to list at xyz.org.  How can I set the 
'reply-to' field of the emails so that just hitting 'reply' sends a 
message back to list at xyz.org?  I set the list up in my aliases file, 
with owner-list and list-request defined in the the 
standard way.  I'd prefer a solution that doesn't require more software, 
since this is a 10-person list for a class and I have no need for list 
management software like majordomo.

Am not sure why you're suffering more spam at your secondary- are you
saying that the ISP's box is doing secondary MX?  Meaning you don't
administer that secondary mail server?

As for Postfix, my secondary mx is using all the same anti-spam tools that
the primary mx is using.  The only difference I can think of is a lack of
user accounts on the secondary which prevents rejecting mail based upon
unknown local user.  However even when that happens I think nobody
receives the spam, anyway.  Isn't there an option to not send
undeliverable mail to userx, for example?

Regards

Just had a discussion with a coworker that was left unresolved due to
lack of experience on our part.  Is it possible to hide email addresses
on your web site by using a php or javascript script to buidl the
address?  What if all email addresses come from a text file?  Are those
crawled too?  If your whole site is generated dynamically can it still
be harvested?  Can google index it?

Subject: [PLUG] Motherboard problems? Watch the capacitors!
Message-ID: <1050556367.4768.28.camel@mach3.intra.zeutenhorst.com>

I have been having a lot of problems with motherboards lately and have
been trying to find out why. This time it turns out there is a serious
problem that affects a lot of manufactures.

Leaking capacitors have become a serious problem and are affecting many
different motherboard manufacturers and their consumers. The following
web site has a lot of information: http://www.careyholzman.com/

All would be advised to inspect their motherboards for swelling caps.
They may cause intermittent problems as the dialectic compound degrades.

Intel and IBM have both extended the warranty on some of their server
grade motherboards because of this issue. I have two ABit motherboards
that I lost to this (one where the cap exploded).

The funny part in all this is a report in Passive Component Industry
Magazine claims that capacitors produced by Taiwanese companies are
liable to sudden failure as a cheap chemical used in their manufacture
was based on an incomplete, stolen process.

A scientist working for Rubycon Corporation in Japan left the company
and began working for Luminous Town Electric in China, where he
developed a copy of a Rubycon electrolyte used in the manufacture of
low-ESR aluminium electrolytic capacitors. Unfortunately, some of his
staff defected, taking the formula with them, and began to sell a
cut-price electrolyte to many of the major aluminium electrolytic makers
in Taiwan - the magazine claims as many as 11 companies were affected.

Not until your own mail server goes down.  It's true that remote sites
are supposed to queue the mail for a while, but that doesn't mean they
do.  With a site of your size, it probably doesn't matter much, because
you're not handling mail from lots of different people.  If you were,
however, it might be an issue.

I just asked this recently of a group I respect, and the answer is
that if your system is offline less than 4 hours a quarter, you
probably don't need an MX.  If your system is offline every night,
then you do.  In between, it's a judgement call.

Or put another way, if you have two paths to the backbone and an
ASN'ed machine in the same cardcage with a UPS, you can avoid the MX.
If your only connectivity is a cable modem or a DSL to your house, get
an offsite MX.  (And then *it* should have two paths to the backbone
with an ASN'ed machine nearby.)

This may have changed recently, but in our tests, nearly all spammers
are doing literal scraping, such that "merlyn at stonehenge.com" will be
noticed, but "merlyn&#64;stonehenge.com" will not.  Thus, you can
write your email links as:

        <a href="mailto:merlyn&#64;stonehenge.com">mail me at
        <tt>merlyn&#64;stonehenge.com</tt></a>

and it all works, and displays properly, and yet it's invisible to the
spammers.

(The CPU to de-entitize a page is not worth it for the spammerscraper,
given that so many pages are still coded in the normal way providing
the spammer with their millions of addresses anyway.)

The other thing if you have control over the email address is to
violate the "normal" email address rules that every believes.  For
example, I have an email address of fred&barney at stonehenge.com that
has been widely published in usenet and on the web.  And yet it has
*never* gotten a spam.  Sure, I've gotten a lot of spam to
<barney at stonehenge.com>, which I've blackholed.  But they don't seem
to get that the ampersand can be part of the email.  Hooray for us!

(Go ahead, send email to fred&barney at stonehenge.com - it's an
autoresponder.)

This php line would work:
<?php include 'header.html'; ?>

The problem with this method is that you have to either change all of your
files from .html to .php, or setup the php parser to parse .html files.  If
this isn't an option I would suggest looking into SSI, it should work on a
properly configured Apache.

Generally anything not in the usual form of <name>@<domain> doesn't get
spammed.  As more people hide their E-mail addresses in alternate forms,
this is likely to change.

I'm a big fan of places like http://www.sneakemail.com or
http://www.spamgourmet.com that offer unique E-mail addresses that forward
back to your real address.  Each time I need to enter my E-mail
address (site registration, USENET post, etc.) I'll create a new
address.  This is extra nice since you can then find out which address
gets spammed and hence, who it was that leaked your E-mail address.  If
the abuse is bad enough, the address can be completely disabled.

Couple this with the latest SpamAssassin and you get a winning
combination.

Well, if you have php installed... you can do this

<?php include("http://www.domain.com/header.html"); ?>

Body body body

<?php include("http://www.domain.com/footer.html"); ?>

  Thank you, Phil & Robby. What I neglected to mention is that I do not host
the Web site here; I let our ISP do that and provide the security for all of
us.

  I suppose I can ask the techies if they would support this.

Besides the PHP answers given already, you can also use mod_perl with
any one of a few dozen templating systems (mod_perl is often already
compiled in to the apache within linux distros these days).  I prefer
Template Toolkit as the most full-featured, with a tutorial on using
it with Apache at <http://www.tt2.org/tpc4/index.html>.  TT can also
be used from CGI scripts or even from a static "build my site from
these pieces" tree, if no dynamic content is needed.  Then you don't
even need mod_perl!

I got so tired of junk SNAIL mail that every time I subscribed to a magazine, I would spell my name slightly differently. Then I would know who sold my name. :-) This sounds like the same idea.

Yep.  Exactly the same idea.

I'll add bogus "apartment" numbers to my address for the same purpose.  
By far, most of my junk mail comes from my USPS change-of-address form.

I try to keep my name the same since I read about a court case where
someone was suing a junk mailer for misusing his identity by sending him
junk.  He knew who it was since they had a typo in his name.  
Unfortunately the court ruled that since the name with the typo was wrong,
the identity they were using was not his and hence, he had no case.

I wish I could find a link to the story, but Google seems to have failed
me.

Subject: [PLUG] HB2892 Update: Bill Moves Forward!
Message-ID: <1050596788.4474.1.camel@sparticus.coopnkass.com>

Friends, 

I am pleased to report that the Department of Administrative Services
submitted HB 2892's amendments and the Bill is moving forward! 

The leadership at the Information Resource Management arm of DAS, in
conjunction with members of Education system and Open Source community,
made a good bill even better. 

Specifically, DAS indicated that if the finer points of IT procurement
guidelines were placed in the Oregon Statute rather than law, the State
could react quickly to the ever-changing technology landscape. 

I find this ideal as it allows the State a greater degree of flexibility
while dealing with IT issues that are both complex and fast moving.

On the technological side with regard to Open Source, the leadership at
DAS really gets it. Over the past six months, DAS has both evaluated and
actively used Open Source in the State's IT infrastructure. Further,
they seem to have an awareness for the potential pitfalls with regard to
sometimes unreasonable software copyrights, patents, and End User
Licence Agreements.

We kept what are perhaps the most critical lines of the bill:

    "(2) For all new software acquisitions, the person or governing body
    charged with administering each administrative division of state
    government, including every department, division,agency, board or
    commission, without regard to the designation given the entity,
    shall consider acquiring open source software products in addition
    to proprietary software products."
    
Did we lose the justification piece? Not really. See, as many of you
know the idea is to _level_ the playing field, not to exclude
proprietary software. If we require justification only in the case of
proprietary software, that could potentially push out a vendor simply
because Open Source would not require justification for procurement. The
truth is that there are justification mechanisms built in to the State
procurement process. Currently, a study must be completed before any
software purchases over a certain monetary threshold are made. 

I am thoroughly impressed with everyone's efforts on HB 2892. I tell
you, when Republicans and Democrats alike sit down in a non-partisan
effort for a common goal, it's a good thing. 

The proof is in the pudding. You may find the proposed amendments to
HB2892 in PDF format here: 

 http://www.mwvlug.org/legislation/oregon/HB2892_proposed_amendments.pdf
    
These amendments refer to the PDF version of HB 2892 here:

  http://www.mwvlug.org/legislation/oregon/hb2892.pdf

HB 2892 is scheduled for a committee work session today.

Meanwhile, if the bill passes into law DAS will define, during a public
rules process, the terms of "open systems" and "open standards." DAS
will hold public hearings and listen to input from the public on these
issues. To participate, one should join the "interested persons" mailing
list. I will provide details for joining the list upon request.

Also, I understand the opposition is _very_ interested in seeing this
bill disappear. It seems they are pressing very hard in their desire to
keep the status quo. As I understand it, one of the members of the
opposition visited Rep. Barnhart's office and "sternly" said, "make this
thing go away."

Let's keep up the support for this bill; we've a long way to go and it's
only through your support that this can be a true success!

Finally, I want to thank all of you who have written with your support
for our efforts. It really makes a difference.

I'll keep you posted.


Very Truly Yours,

Rich,

The answer is highly dependent on what web server software is running 
on the machine that hosts your site.

In Apache land, server-side includes are the easiest approach:

  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/howto/ssi.html#includingastandardfooter

Most webmasters allow user-supported pages to use SSI, but you'll need 
to check it out with your admins.

I haven't looked at Template Toolkit, but another of the same sort of 
thing is Mason (http://www.masonhq.com/), which would definitely work
for what Rich wants to do.

Is this still a problem to this day? 

I know there WAS a problem, about two years ago. That's when I bought a
set of 21 abit motherboards. 18 of them died within the two year
warrenty period. The other 3 lasted until 2 months after warrenty
expired, and Abit refused to honor the warrenty, even though these MBs
had classic symptoms of the defective caps. 

At the same time, I've purchased MBs from many manufactures (Abit, ASUS,
Intel, Soyo, MSI, and others) that haven't shown any sign of failure. 

It was my understanding that the bad electrlyte problem was relatively
short lived, and only affected a few manufactures. 

I suspect that any MB purchased within the last year is probably fine.
Boards purchased 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 years ago may be suspect. 

But that's just my guess, based on the following paragraph from the IEEE
article:

Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with a low equivalent series resistance
(ESR) are high-capacitance components that generally serve to smooth out
the power supply to chips. Throughout 2002, they have been breaking open
and failing in certain desktop PCs. Motherboard and PC makers contacted
by IEEE Spectrum have stopped using the faulty parts, but because the
parts can fail over a period of several months, more such failures are
expected.

Yeah, SSI is your best bet for server-side.  If you can't even get that,
however, this can be done with JavaScript includes.  It's relatively
kludgy, but it'll work if your audience is running JS-enabled browsers.

Well... In HTML 4.01 (at least) there's an <iframe> (in-line frame) tag,
which makes it sort of a client-side include, without the framey-ness of
regular frames.  But not all browsers support it, AFAIK, and might not
even be rendered consistently.

And they aren't behind a security firewall that strips JavaScript.

If the answer for something essential is "JavaScript", you asked
the wrong question.

How would a firewall strip JavaScript, as you say?  Isn't a .js file
served just like any other Web file?  Are you telling me some firewalls
block HTTP requests based on file extensions?

A JavaScript file has MIME type of 'application/x-javascript'.  Plus,
it's possibly to actually strip JS (at least, partially) from HTML. 
Look for Junkbuster and Prixoy, which are web proxies that do just that.

Remember the "problems" DoubleClick has had with security and privacy?

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A39211-2003Apr16.html

Homeland Security To Fill Privacy Post


By Brian Krebs
washingtonpost.com Staff Writer
Wednesday, April 16, 2003; 3:45 PM


The former privacy officer of Internet advertising giant DoubleClick
will be the Department of Homeland Security's first privacy czar,
Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge announced today.

The administration will appoint Nuala O'Connor Kelly to the privacy
post, where she would be responsible for vetting proposals or programs
that involve collecting and using U.S. citizens' personal information.
O'Connor Kelly currently serves as a Commerce Department attorney.

O'Connor Kelly, 34, will report to Ridge.

The privacy rights community generally views O'Connor Kelly as a
consensus builder, but it is too soon to say how much influence she
will have in protecting Americans' privacy rights, said Ari Schwartz,
associate director at the Center for Democracy and Technology.

"One of the things we liked (about her job) at DoubleClick was that she
worked hard to build relationships with the privacy community and to vet
their new policies with these groups," Schwartz said. "There is still
some question as to what level of access will she have, and whether she
will be able to speak her mind internally and publicly on privacy issues
or will she simply be giving the agency line on everything."

Don't ever get a job any place that has really sensitive info on your 
computer. I'd love it if my accountant, doctor, and lawyer told me 
that their firms had such a firewall, which I'd trust way more than IE 
(or even Mozilla) when security was really on the line.

What's more important: rollover graphics or system integrity?

It's 4 hours 18 minutes,to Bellingham with no stops. The fest starts 10.00AM,
so you need to leave around 5:30AM. The fest ends at 5:00PM; dinner in
Bellingham puts you leaving at 5:30PM if you run for the border, 6:00PM because
you'll need to by gas, so your back in Portland about 10:30PM.	

Are people really planning on doing that?

Add at least an hour and a half each way for Albany.  I'm considering going up 
the nite before and sleeping there to return the next day after the morning

Subject: [PLUG] Trouble with ip readdressing and mail...
Message-ID: <200304171716.AA53543166@mail.opusnet.com>

I upgraded to a bigger subnet through my ISP and had to change numbers.
Unfortunately, even though I've changed my domain registration so that
the new address of my domain name server is known and have deleted
the old record of 209.210.202.166, a number of sites don't seems to be
updated  I've noticed that I can't subscribe my email to pluglist
under the new set up either.

My new name server address is 209.210.202.171.  I intend to raise
a backup at 209.210.202.170.  My domain name is robinson-west.com
where at least many of the whois databases seem to be updated

I can send email to myself: michael at robinson-west.com from Portland State
accounts and this ISP account.  Actually, the CS lab at PSU isn't
updated on how to resolve my new subnet, but if I use nslookup and tell 
it the new number of my nameserver to look me up with I get a positive 
query from there.  Is a similar reason why I can't resubscribe my own
private email address to this list?

Maybe I should try subscribing  michael at ip-address where
ip-address is the number of the server that I normally put
a name for there.

I guess if the plug subscriber isn't looking for my nameserver
at the right address there should be an absence of dns requests.
How can I detect that?

I think register.com said 48 hours, maybe more time is needed.

[tosha]$ mozilla &

It brings up another copy of the browser as it's setup on 'rufus' with the

The only way I can get the local setup to run is to exit from rufus' mozilla.

Point taken, sir, but I wouldn't agree that client JS should be killed
off just because of IE's security problems.  It's useful for more than
rollovers:  client-side form validation, for instance, saves a lot of
hits (and hence a lot of waiting).  Are you throwing out the baby with
the bathwater, or is a really secure JS sandbox just a pipe dream?

Mozilla uses X to determine if another mozilla session is already
running and connects to it if possible. It doesn't matter if it's
running off of another machine. 

You can disable this by starting the second session with the --no-xshm
option.

I've been told many corporations strip JS at the ingress firewall,
simply because nearly all security exploits of browsers have related
to JS somehow.  Good for them.  JS is dumb.  "Let *me* drive, darn it!"

Firewalling in general is a blunt tool, but I agree that a complete
ban on JavaScript can disable some useful tools. Each business would 
have to decide for itself what the best policy is for any given 
network.

Then again, maybe the courts will tell us that blocking JavaScript 
and/or images is a violation of the DMCA and that firewalling will 
get you a fine or jail time. Stranger things have happened.

I took a look and the only thing I see that is a little questionable is 
mail.robinson-west.com is a CNAME entry instead of an A record.  Was this 
how you were doing it before?
   Also the MX records indicate your nameserver is your mail server?

There are concerns about the accessibility of JavaScript, as well.
Some screen readers aren't JavaScript-enabled.  And even for the 
ones that are, there are various gotchas that you have to beware of.

Cooper,

Can you reconcile your report with the Oregonian's today in the business section 
titled "Open Source software bill stalls on opposition"? Where they say that the 
  House General Governement Committee passsed over the bill for discussion?

What's going on?

The General Government Committee dropped HB 2892 from discussion very
abruptly. In fact, I am told that parties attending the discussion came
to the work group conference room and were told at that time that there
would be no work session.

All of these events occurred within an hour of my writing the update.

There is still a chance that this bill will move forward and I'm not
giving up. 

I'll keep you posted.

All, 

I am confident that with a strong showing of support from each of you
that we can make this bill move forward.

Let us not forget that it is not the industry trade groups that have to
live with bad IT procurement practices resulting in wasted taxpayer
dollars as a result of Administrative tunnel vision for proprietary
software. 

It is we.

Please take just a few moments to write to your representative about
this very important bill. Also, if you have not made an appointment with
your Representative, I encourage you to do so. I would be more than
happy to coordinate this if you would like.

You may write to your legislator here:

  http://www.leg.state.or.us/writelegsltr/writeset.htm

HB 2892 has received national attention; let's show 'em what we've got!

It is critical that we push this bill to the committee vote stage. If we
can achieve this goal, the awareness for Open Source will skyrocket as
it is likely to then go to a vote on the House floor. Oregon businesses
and IT professionals nationwide are counting on us to bring this bill to
the forefront. Let's make it happen!


Very Truly Yours,

But only sometimes.  Like the script that prints out "The time is:"
followed by the user's local system time.  Makes me wonder how many

I'm trying to dump FPSE. In the process, I'm needing to populate my cgi-bin 
directory.

I'm playing with a script called form_procesor.pl. I get errors while trying to 
submit a form:

>From /var/log/httpd/error_log:

headers: /var/www/cgi-bin/form_processor.pl

All of the owners are apache.apache and permissions are 755.

I've got perl and mod_perl installed. Verified with rpm -q.

Any clues?

It's not launching in the first place. Can you run it successfully 
from the command line?

Hmm.  The exec failed.  Are you sure you have the right #! line
on the CGI script?  Does the script work from the command line?

Mike> I've got perl and mod_perl installed. Verified with rpm -q.

mod_perl makes no differences to CGI.  It's either CGI, or it's mod_perl.

Any idea what the opposition was?  Are the Micro$oft lobbyists swaying
commitee members?

from the command line:
cgi-bin]#  form_processor.pl
bash: form_processor.pl command not found

If I run it ./form_processor.pl, I get bad interpreter: no such file or
directory.

I know it's there, Ican see it with ls -al, it's 775 apache.apache.

It came packaged with cgi-lib.pl, same user, 755.

The first line of the script says:
#!/usr/bin/perl

I have an executable there, too.

Where next?

Mike

Are you sure?

Does it run with "perl formprocessor.pl"?  Or generate the same
"bad interpreter" error?

Subject: [PLUG] Open Letter regarding Bill 2892 on Open Source Software
Message-ID: <3EA043B7.8060808@hevanet.com>

Fellow Pluggers,

I'm asking for your help, open source style, with the crafting of a letter to my 
representatives. Once revised, it will be published into the public domain 
through Creative Commons (http://old.creativecommons.org/license/publicdomain-2 
) That allows anyone else to basically sign on and say "Yeah, what he said", or 
to rewrite the pieces you disagree with.

Mostly I'm asking for people to point out any factual errors. I am also open to 
hearing other comments.

Thanks,

David Pool

ps Once again that website for finding your representatives is:
http://www.leg.state.or.us/findlegsltr/findset.htm


Dear ________,

I am writing to you to express my concern over an article in today's Oregonian. 
The April 18th business section has an article by Jeffrey Kosseff ?Open-source 
software bill stalls on opposition.? (also online here 
http://www.oregonlive.com/business/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/business/1050666959318260.xml).

To quote Mr. Kosseff, the bill would ?would require state agencies to consider 
open source software when purchasing computer programs?. Please note that it 
doesn?t require the use of Open Source, just the consideration. The point is we 
are trying to achieve a level playing field.

It is VERY IMPORTANT to me that this bill receive a fair hearing and the support 
of my representatives. So much so that I have gone through the trouble of 
tracking you down to tell you about it (a first for me).

A few points for you to consider:

1) Again quoting Mr. Kosseff, ?Microsoft...(has) squared off against a 
grassroots group of open-source programmers and school districts pushing for the 
bill.? . Microsoft is a convicted Felon, found guilty of excercising monopoly 
power, illegally. They have roughly $30 billion in reserves. Thus: the 
grassroots folks and school districts could use a helping hand to level the 
playing field.

You can read about the findings against Microsoft here: United States of America 
vs. Microsoft (http://usvms.gpo.gov/ms-findings2.html)

2) The National Security Agency (NSA) has adopted the Open Source operating 
system Linux due to security concerns. To quote their website
?Why was Linux chosen as the base platform?
Linux was chosen as the platform for the work because of its growing success and 
open development environment. Linux provides an excellent opportunity to 
demonstrate that this functionality can be successful in a mainstream operating 
system and, at the same time, contribute to the security of a widely used 
system. A Linux platform also offers an excellent opportunity for this work to 
receive the widest possible review and perhaps provide the foundation for 
additional security research by others.?

If the NSA trusts Open Source, I believe it would be imprudent of Oregon to fail 
to atleast consider it as an option. I realize that as a legislator, you may not 
keep up to date on technology issues, but numerous people have experienced 
security problems (viruses) and bugs (crashes) using Microsoft products. It 
might be prudent for Oregon to consider what our nation's foremost security 
authorities are doing.
http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/

3) Oregon is a hotbed of Open Source development. There are thousands of local, 
high-wage jobs that depend on the success of Open Source. If the legislature is 
unwilling to flat out direct development projects towards local Oregonian 
programmers instead of sending millions of dollars up to Washington, I beg of 
you ? atleast consider the possibility!

In these budgetary times, I believe it is an outrage that this legislature is 
unwilling to atleast consider possibilities for saving money. I would not be 
surprised if the very idea of saving money for other uses like funding schools 
or police, for example, were to come up as an issue in upcoming elections. If 
nothing else, I'd appreciate knowing where you, as my representative, would 
rather spend our money?

For information on Oregon Open Source activities, please consider that all of 
these local groups are dedicated to Open Source software:

meets monthy in Portland drawing up to a hundred users per meeting and 
maintaining a mailing list that runs much higher.

http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2003/

K-12 Linux ? An initiative to run Open Source software in schools
http://k12linux.org/contents.html

The point is that Oregon's Economy supports a lot of Open Source developers. For 
the most part, they are focused on computers, not politics or elections. Please, 
help them get consideration, at the very least. Please do what you can to see 
that law-breaking monopolists don't scuttle this bill before it's even 
considered in the light of day!

Thank you for your time,

David Pool, Oregon Resident

I called my district Rep and asked to speak with him (Max Williams).
His assistant allowed me to leave a number that he could get back to me.
She said Max wasn't on the General committee though.

So I called up the office of Jerry Krummel (503-986-1426).  He chairs
the General government committee.  Again, an assistant took my name and
phone number.  Said he would be able to get back to me between 3pm-5pm
since session was in.  

I doubt either one will call me back, but I have more faith with local
rep's than I do getting a hold of my state federal rep's.

Is the file in unix format, or DOS format? 

If it's in DOS format, you'll get that error too.

I think the appropriate question is whether or not mr. Williams believes he has 
any ability to talk to or influence members of that committee.

Can anyone break this list down into 'friends' and 'foes' of the bill?
( Jerry Krummel falls into the 'friends' catagory, right?)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0304181311520.18604-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I'm attending a very small portion of the Open Source Software Convention
in July.  I'm also bringing the better half since she has never been to
Portland.  The Convention rates at the Marriott seem a little high so I'm
looking for alternative motels.  Near downtown or a Maxrail stop would be
great.  It has been 5 years since I was last in Portland so my memory of
what's avaiable is a bit hazy.

Suggestions?

Well, here is my report.  No, I didn't upgrade a 7.x -> 9.0.  I decided 
to move my dual Celeron RedHat 7.2 box to the attic as a server, and 
start over with a new machine. :)

I left all my 7.2 config on the old box as-is, so if I need to log in
and "do work", it will still function the way it was.  Now my desktop is
a RedHat 9.0 (also dual boot XP) FIC IceCube - P4 2.26GHz.  The RedHat 9 
install went just fine, and I have /usr/local mounted from my 7.2 box.  
So far, I've only had to recompile one app.  We'll see how it goes, but
as far as a standalone machine, everything checks out so far.

For details on the IceCube, see http://www.fic.com.tw/product/sff/mini/ice-cube.aspx

It's written in DocBook using the <qandaset> stuff. I'd be happy to

Either way, I think it'd be a nice service to our guests...

Thanks Paul but for me the beer directions isn't necessary.  I've drank my
way to and through many if not most of the place down town.  Not that I
drink to excess but I did spend most of a week several times a year in
Portland and the meeting coordinator figured the time after meetings was
for team building.
   Wait a minute, maybe I did drink too much. :-) What's the name of the 
movie theater where you can buy beer and watch bad movies?  And it had a 
retaurant next door that made killer artichoke and mushroom pizzas.

Well enough of this.  I'm still looking for good but reasonably priced 
accomodations.

Message-ID: <20030419002531.GA13679@subtend.net>

Behold!  Representative Jerry Drummel, at 16:52PDT, calls me back.

I spoke with him for about 10 minutes.  To summarize:

* He scratched out the discussion of the bill in the general committee
  because he wasn't happy with the amendments.  Two issues:
   - Issue with the "where as" clauses.  I didn't know what this meant.
   - Issue with parts of section 2, did not go into details

* He has been working with Barnhart and and Ken Barber since the bills
  creation.

* He is the one who invited Riverdale and the MESD down to testify.

* Once the bill is finalized and approved through the General committee,
  he would be a yes vote.


He also made a interesting comment about school districts in general (I
mentioned I worked for Tigard/Tualatin SD).  He said that if the bill
wasn't watered down, and specifically said "you must purchase open
source software over proprietary software", school district
administrators would be pissed off because the state would be telling
them what, and what not, to purchase.  

Even if this bill passes, it will be a long journey towards the path to
enlightenment. :)  Education of the procurement people will need to be
done.  School educators will need to be educated on the benefits of
considering open source to proprietary software.

This is also a good opportunity for the unemployed to get out there and
implement open source solutions at half the cost of proprietary software,
with a reasonable amount of profit.

So, I don't think the bill is dead, just standard government
bureaucracy.  I've never had a representative call me back though, which
was impressive.  Then again, maybe I'm easily impressed when it comes to
legislature.  I did mention multiple times throughout the conversation
that this bill was important to myself, and many people known and
unknown to me.

Next I'm going to try and get some response on SB655.  The evil Oregon
"Super" DMCA.

Message-ID: <001201c30618$d3298040$7013693f@dslonly.net>

To the whole group working effectively on HB 2892:

I am usually just a lurker on this listserver.  In the past I have received amazing help and education on setting up my own linux boxes.  I am currently a 2nd year law student just up the road from the folks at Riverdale.

My reason for stepping in is that I want to give a heart-felt thanks to all of you that have worked and are continuing to work on the passage of HB 2892.  Two summers ago I sent emails to the Portland city commissioners concerning the use of Linux/GNU instead of proprietary software in general and got a cursory response from some and no response from others.  You folks have shown what it really takes to make this happen.

I cannot help for another three weeks or so (end of the semester and finals approaching), but if this thing is still alive and kicking, I'd like to help (could be useful to have a politically savvy (IMHO) law student on your side).

Please keep up the good work and don't let high-paid lobbyists, wherever they come from, stop you.

One suggestion from today's flurry of emails is to contact your local rep even if they are not on the "general committee" to see if they have any leverage there.  Also, somebody should contact the technology columnist at the Portland Business Journal. It's a gamble because they tend to be pro-business but they also tend to be pro-fiscally concerned especially on the school funding front.  It wouldn't hurt to approch the leadership of both parties in the legislature.  They have the real power.  And, maybe even somebody in the Governor's office since he is obviously not willing to raise any new revenue and would welcome any savings.

My 2 cents.

I've looked at documentation on RIP which seems to be what I need.  However, 
the example in an OSU networking text uses private addressing on the 
redundant gateways dropping to one Internet gateway.  What I need is 
something that will work where the redundant gateways both have a direct 
Internet connection.  They are both dual nic machines.  With RIP there is
evidently a broadcasting issue.  You don't want to broadcast onto
your service providers network.  If I understand correctly, the gateways and 
other routers broadcast their routes which the workstations and terminals
receive via a listening daemon.  The idea as I see it is to listen for the 
routes and update routing entries dynamically.  Can I controlling the 
broadcasting with iptables?

Wouldn't the obvious thing to do be setting the secondary up with 
the same rules as the primary.  Network filesystems 
are popular but I wouldn't want to use them from the primary 
because the event of the primary going down would take the 
secondary out as well.  The best way to set a secondary up from 
what I can see is with the same rules as the  primary and with
the ability to substitute the secondary for the primary.  The latter
may mean that people have to set up another imap account
unless there is a way to transparently have one imap server
address go to the exchanger currently serving the mail.  If
the primary is out it would be the secondary.

The more I think about it the more I realize there should probably 
be a set of redundant network file servers behind gateway/Internet/mail 
servers which distribute authentication services and protect data 
used on the outside boxes.  If you put these cross server 
authentication services on your outside boxes there is the problem 
of having to be able to distribute information from 
a server that is live.  This becomes a problem when none of 
these machines are dedicated to be up for authentication.  If 
you distribute the same information from all of your servers 
you have just defeated the point of distributing authentication
information and probably could have done it more easily by 
manually programming each server's password file to be the same.
More servers means more power though I guess this can be
alleviated by using older computers.  The other issue with
distributed authentication is that it is common to have some
accounts that are unique on each server that shouldn't be
available on all.

With the logs the easy solution is remote loggis available, but some consider 
that practice taking advantage of
> spool space on the sending servers...
ing.  There is one
thing I really don't like about this though and that's having the logs
from multiple machines dump into one set of files on the log server.
I would like to have each machine's logs in seperate files or at
least have the log files sorted so that in chronological order 
there would all logs from machine A ... followed by all logs from m
achine N.  This probably involves turning logging off, sorting the 
logs, then restarting the log daemons.  With the latter approach,
the end of the log would always be unsorted.  It would be nice 
instead of turning logging off to dump to a temporary log during the
sort.  Then one would only sort the original log files once and
afterwards not dump to them directly, but dump to a temporary
instead.  With two sets of temporaries that are recycled over
time, logging would never have to be suspended except when
space is exhausted.  One temporary gets sorted and appended 
to the main logs while the other catches new logs.  Many 
references say to put all logs into one file but this is ugly 
because there are different types of logs which are easier 
to see in their own files and the log file gets very long very 
fast.  I've seen emailers which probe logs, I'd much rather 
figure out how to get a perl script to put graphics based on 
the logs such as histograms, pie charts, etc. on a private 
lan management web site.  The easier it is to see important 
events in the logs the more likely an administrator is to take 
needed action reducing the security risk of providing any 
service over potentially malicious networks.

I don't know about the speed issue.  The cool thing to do 
would be to have a mail server stop accepting mail when 
it's jammed and open up again when it is say 20% free on 
spool space.  I would think that speed is a spammers 
friend as they can send more junk to you unless the 
purpose of spamming is to cause DoS.  At the end of the
day connections for spammers can possibly be refused,
but what's to stop their flood of requests from taking away
all your bandwidth anyhow?  One doesn't have to be 
accepted to send a connection request.  This seems like
an area where a network authority severing the spammers
connection to the Net is the only solution.  There's
something called tarpitting where you allow conenction
but the connection goes into a black hole.  I guess you'd
have to allow the spammer to flood the tar pit though which
probably means that the ISP has to do the tar pitting.

No need to. You should be able to control the networks that RIP

You don't ever want to put your mail spool on a network filesystem, with
the possible exception of some of the clustering, replicating
filesystems, but I haven't investigated those enough to know.  (And in
practice, it's rarely necessary.)

No.  There's no need for the MX hosts to also host the client mail
spool.  Usually the load on MXes is caused by processing that need not
be done on the client spool server, such as spam and anti-virus
scanning.  If your load is that much, you're better making the MXs
separate from the client spool, fed into the client spool via LMTP.  If
client access is such a high load, there are solutions for distributing
that too, such as the "Murder" component of Cyrus IMAP.  (A "murder" is
a group of crows.)

No, you really don't want to do that.  The work of adding a user in a
non-distributed environment increases linearly by a factor of the number
servers; the likelihood of missing a step also increases highly; and the
likelihood of effectively disabling the account across the network is
abysmal.  At 3 servers, it's already tedious.

> More servers means more power though I guess this can be
> alleviated by using older computers.

I don't think this is necessarily the case.  Some of those big old
harddrives take more power than newer ones.  But I don't know much about
power, so I might be wrong.  At any rate, in the trade-offs you're
considering, power is not so much of an issue.

Not really.  There are mechanisms in both NIS and LDAP for controlling
the host that a particular account may be active on.

No need for this.  There are syslog replacements that will do just what

The MX host has to do that.  Postfix does it by default.

Comment out the lines in syslogd.conf that go to local files, while
leaving in the line(s) that send to remote hosts?  Of course, all those
services that don't use syslog can't do this.

Ok, where do I look for the client RIP2 daemon for Windows of various 
versions, Mac G4, and Linux?  I probably want source and I have gcc 
for Windows so I can likely produce a fairly reasonable executable on 
all but the Mac.  Have I over simplified in saying that routers and gateways 
broadcast whereas clients listen?  Do routes that are specific to a gateway 
need to be broadcast from solely that gateway?  Under Redhat 7.2, what 
config files do I look at for implementing RIP2?  I guess there's an 
/etc/gateways file though that might be for gated.  I don't need gated for 
distributing multiple Internet gateways to a lan where there are no 
intervening routers between the gateway router and lan hosts?  Is 
gated only needed where multiple routes can translate to circular 
routes if one isn't careful because of needing to go to more than one
router on a trip between point A and B?  

I have to support Windows 98SE, 2000, Mac OS X, and Max OS 9 with my
new routing scheme that will automatically switch which router is used to go
out on the Internet in every applicable workstations'/private network hosted 
servers' routing table when one of my two gateways is taken down for some
reason.    Do I take the default router out of dhcp, a dhcp 2 server, when I 
get RIP going on my network?  Why is it so important that RIP affects the 
routing table instead of the routing cache?  Does 7.2's routed
work and does it implement RIP2?

RIP1 seems like a mistake, what's broken and should I use source instead
of binary rpm's for RIP2?  Where do I get the source from for RIP2 server
and client?

No, that's pretty much the way RIP works.

I'd try Zebra (http://www.zebra.org); I don't know about MacOS 9 or
Winders, but Linux and OS X should be fine.

It's in /var/lib/rpm.  Copy it off somewhere else, and/or copy it
someplace "obscure" and set the immutable bit and encrypt it with GPG.

Well I've been blacklisted by a german relay between my mail server
and one my sister wants to reach.  What does it mean to be an open relay
and how can I fix it?  This hasn't been a problem before, I've renumbered
and I've added a second mail exchanger ( actually it's just a second mail
gateway to the same mail server as the other one ).  The changes have now 
taken affect from the changeover in numbers.  Maybe the blacklisting 
happened in that period when the changeover was occuring.

my email is michael at robinson-west.com and it the ip of one of my gateways,
209.210.202.171, that's blacklisted.

That's a really weird deal, they must be super-aggressive. How do you know 
you're being blocked? What kind of information do they give you? Do they have 
a FAQ? How does this prevent your sister from doing whatever?

Start at http://relays.osirusoft.com/ for more information on testing open 
relays, and finding out who is blocking you. But the best thing is 
information specific to whoever is blocking you. I didn't find your IP listed 
anywhere.

They told me to add a rcpthosts file to my qmail server or run a patch
to only allow relaying for valid pop3 or imap users.  I think rcpthosts 
controls the domain allowed for sender or receiver of email where
all other email is dropped.  They gave me an email that said to go
to a website and recheck.  Maybe I got off the blacklist, it's a list
that is evidently updated within minutes or hours of correcting
the problem according to the faq on the web site I was referred
to.

I was sent a message like this:

This mail has been requested by 209.210.202.170.
To retest 209.210.202.170 please visit the following link(s):

http://relaytest.kundenserver.de/retest.php?id=17749489&lc=6daf6437768115aa

You don't need to reply to this mail to retest 209.210.202.170,
just visit the links above.

where the link above only works once.  I know I was being blocked because 
qmail was informing me that it couldn't send my sister's emails and I was 
being sent information about being blacklisted, the message above.

According to their faq they don't mind breaking NOKIA cell phones that are
too old to support some kind of improved smtp.  This whole anti smtp servers
that allow other sites to relay email through them policy doesn't make much 
sense to me.  Who's to stop spammers from forging their from address or 
doing other things to cause mail to go either directly or indirectly where 
they want it to go?  I've had a lot of people send email to my domain to 
an invalid user account and I know these aren't people I'm familiar with 
where the from address is an invalid yahoo account.  It's hard to see how
to stop the spam I get because the from is always changing and it would
be extreme to block all of yahoo.com.  Specifically the spam aimed at me
gets to me because of double bounce where qmail can't bounce a 
message properly sending it to the admin instead.  With forging possible
I don't see how going after open relays helps.  I guess the only reason
so many sites don't like open relays is that open relays can't be held
responsible for spam since it may be difficult to track the source.

Blocking open relays will stop a sizable percentage of spam, possibly as much 
as half, though it's hard to get good numbers. Spammers are evil bastards who 
expend considerable energy finding ways to steal resources from other people. 

According to the faq at http://relaytest.kundenserver.de/faq/admin/1.html, 
they relay-test every server that tries to send them mail:

"Why do you test my host?

We're testing every host who is trying to send mail to mx.kundenserver.de. 
Since much spam is being received via unsecured mail servers, we're testing 
every host who tries to send mail to our mail cluster to verify that these 
servers have a correct and non-abusable configuration."

I think this is a reasonable policy. The more aggressive RBLs that list open 
relays go out and test anyone and everyone, not just people who try to send 
them mail. Some of our local ISPs, such as Easystreet and Aracnet, will not 
provide connectivity until they test your mailserver.

Forging return addresses or other parts of mail headers are fave spammer 
tactics, but you can still follow their backtrail, they can't hide it 
completely.

Hi all,

<disclaimer>
Sorry if this is off-topic, because it's not 100% linux related (okay it's
not even 50% related), and it's my first post here... so here goes.
</disclaimer>

I am looking for computer geeks (I mean "geek" in the most endearing way, as
I am one) to work at a growing company that just moved to Hood River, OR.

Here's the deal:

We're very linux friendly; alas the product is targeted at Windoze(gasp!)
users since that's the only way to make it in consumer electronics these
days:(  You can check out our website at www.streamzap.com and you've got to
cut us some slack for selling on www.thinkgeek.com and opening up our
hardware specs to an open source linux developer who made drivers for our
product (on SourceForge).  I hope to add at least RH linux support in the
near future as we grow and can afford to do so.

I'm looking to hire for the following position:

***Tech Support / QA / all around guru***

-Play with gadgets!
Test our product on all possible Windoze platforms, with every possible
program... break it, find bugs, (optional: fix them if you can).  Research
and buy the latest video/sound cards/motherboards/etc needed for testing.
Can you even imagine the size of that n-dimensional testing matrix?!! ;)

-Help people!
Save our poor customers who have to deal with above said bugs. (E-mail and
phone support).

-Know everything about hardware and software
Build systems, LANs, set up and admin Apache, MySQL, for our staging web
server; play with Mac OSX, linux, etc.

-Dabble in a bit of everything
PHP, HTML, JavaScript, Flash, MySQL for our website... VC++/MFC/Win32 for
our device drivers.  Experience not required in any of these technologies.
A desire to learn and tinker with several of them is absolutely required.

Salary range is about $24K + medical/dental, so you can look at it as either
a good paying tech support job or an entry level developer job (lots of
opportunities to branch into development).  Hood River,OR is about as
beautiful and laid back work environment as you can get.. see
www.gorge.net).

Please pass this along to anyone you know who might be interested!
Please send resumes and a brief e-mail intro to jpeskin at streamzap.com

Thank you!!
Jonah

Well the playstation II can run Linux.  One would be surprised where open 
source software can be found.  There are many ways to get Linux to consumers.
One is to choose a distribution that is started from Windows.  Another way is 
to have customers run vmware or wine and place certain win apps they "need"
on a Windows system running on virtual machine while having Linux underneath. 
The last is one I really like, network boot X so that Windows customers can 
easily use both environments.  Trick here is to convince customers to use 
PC's that are compatible with both OS'es.  X-Windows is your friend for many 
programs.  If KDE and GNOME are too heavy, use something lighter.  Check 
out www.ltsp.org, very interesting.  My advice is to not write any program in
a way that makes it difficult to port it to Linux.  What is good for 
enterprise is good for a desktop system in general also, expect Linux to take 
more market share from Windows.
  
Windows is hurting the consumer electronics market because the PC
is gaining a reputation of being a piece of junk.  With open source you
can see under the hood and fix things.  Windows is bloated, Microsoft
is trying to maintain compatibility with a line of systems that were never
intended for today's computing needs resulting in severe growing pains
seen by many today in the form of blue screen of death.  There are some
Windows problems that will probably never get fixed and Microsoft is
creating a tremendous opporunity by changing how Windows is accessed
and functions so often for a better designed, more reliable, more powerful
system like Linux to make a real dent in the desktop market.  I see nothing 
wring with writing proprietary applications for Linux as long as the 
libraries that could be considered part of the operating system that 
it needs to function are kept open source.  I think many folks make 
the mistake of the underestimating the desire for solid commercial 
applications that work out of the box on Linux within the security 
and design peridiems of the Linux operating system, source 
code or not.  Indeed, many programs which have been proprietary 
in the past and succeeded have seen their source code released 
where it wouldn't surprise me to find someone discovering a way to 
make money off an open source program through documentation
sales or other means.  My advice is to move toward not supporting
Windows at all.  This move will save you so much money and 
headaches that you'll probably increase your profits.  There are 
many ways to affectively deploy Linux for someone who uses
Windows and maybe isn't a computer genius, go for it.

Just a thought, does the Nintendo run dos or Windows?  How about
the Mac?  The Palm Pilot?  An enhanced wrist watch?  Writing 
software to run under Linux and open sourcing as soon as you
can to build your reputation is a good idea.

Trying to send an email maria at m-a-schmid.de from my michael at robinson-west.com

Doug Palin's Log: StarDate 0419.2001:
> How does fetchmail connect to get mail, eg what protocol?

Here's the entry from .fetchmailrc:

poll mail.pacifier.com proto imap user brucek fetchall fetchlimit 300

Prior to the upgrade, the proto was pop3; and about a year ago, it was
imap. I had done a query some years ago, and pacifier was reporting
that it supported imap4, so I set the proto to imap. Then about a year
ago, it got wierd and tech support told me that they only supported
pop3; but that they intended to upgrade their servers soon and imap
would be supported then.

There's another entry in .netrc that handles the login/password issue.

In this case, the culprit was that the IP for mail.pacifier.com had
changed. I suppose that I shouldn't have that IP in my /etc/hosts
file, but for historical reasons it has been there for along time. It
originally got there because the IP was listed on the settings page,
but the new settings page doesn't show IPs. Something about security
issues -- but not well explained, since I can't figger out what the
security issues are.

So, on the third fone call to tech support, I got someone to tell me
what exactly had changed at the time of the cluster transition, and it
turned out to be the IP address for mail.pacifier.com . I fixed that,
and mail started flowing again.

I should re-read the DNS setup rules again, so that I better
understand how to avoid this issue in the future.

I also asked tech support to put up a 'linux users' web page that
lists all the details that WE might need. It's seldom that linux users
need help configuring their specific tools; but having the appropriate
ISP specific data in a place that said users can find certainly helps
us setup our tools correctly.

Thanx,

Hey Michael,
Adding rcpthosts to /var/qmail/control is a big part of stopping qmail
from being an open relay. There is one more thing though: Since qmail
runs under Dan Bernstein's tcpserver it uses tcprules to secure the port
25 connection. The rules are compiled into a .cdb file and read into
tcpserver with the -x option. Normally the rules are placed into
/etc/tcp.smtp and compiled with `/var/qmail/bin/qmailctl cdb`. You might
want to look into the /etc/tcp.smtp file and make sure that the only
entry is one that looks something like <10.0.0.:allow,RELAYCLIENT="">
where 10.0.0. is replaced with your internal network address. Once that
you have finished with tcpserver then you can be certain that you not an
open relay.

For more info, see Dan's notes at http://cr.yp.to.

The only known foe is Donna Nelson (R-McMinnville).  Rep. Mabrey 
(R-The Dalles) was mildly opposed but wanted to know more before 
making up his mind.  Rep. Barnhart was going to talk to him.

Jerry Krummel (R-Wilsonville) is an enthusiastic supporter -- but 
has to declare a conflict of interest because he's a sales rep 
for a Linux-based product.

Kelley Wirth (D-Corvallis) and Floyd Prozanski (D-Eugene) are also 
enthusiastic supporters.  Brad Avakian (D-Beaverton) is mildly 
supportive.

That leaves Rep. Derrik Kitts (R-Hillsboro).  No one knows where 
his head is at on this bill.

I'm assuming, for the moment, that HB 2892 is dead and am prepared 
to move on with putting media spin on the whole thing that will 
help our cause, and then retiring to fight another day.  However, 
if Krummel, Barnhart et. al. are able to ressurect the thing (it 
IS Easter weekend, right?) I'll be very pleased.

I am currently running for Portland School Board, and one of my

costs and strengthen the schools.

Last year, many of you were involved in an effort to convert many of the
systems in the schools and throughout the district from Windoze to
Linux.  I am wondering if you might want to share with me your
experiences -- for those involved -- with working with the District, how
well-received you were, what could have been done to make things easier,
and how much money was saved (if any).

If you are currently employed with the District and don't wish to give
your name publicly, you can contact my off-list and I will not reveal
the source.

Thanks.

then there's mailgraph, mailstats, LogReport, Logrep and Isoqlog, and

Never have I had to recompile Perl.  Maybe you just need to build a CPAN
module?  I'm using pflogsumm with no "extra" modules, AFAIK.

Well, it wouldn't run, 'cause it said it required Date::Calc.  So I
tried to install that with the recommended perl command, and that
choked, because I don't have the perl headers.  There was a message
saying I should recompile perl.  My eyes glazed over, and then I turned
away from that dark, forboding path.  But it was a problem I've had
before.  I've looked for a perl-dev type package, but there isn't.

The only known foe is Donna Nelson (R-McMinnville).  Rep. Mabrey 
(R-The Dalles) was mildly opposed but wanted to know more before 
making up his mind.  Rep. Barnhart was going to talk to him.

Jerry Krummel (R-Wilsonville) is an enthusiastic supporter -- but 
has to declare a conflict of interest because he's a sales rep 
for a Linux-based product.

Kelley Wirth (D-Corvallis) and Floyd Prozanski (D-Eugene) are also 
enthusiastic supporters.  Brad Avakian (D-Beaverton) is mildly 
supportive.

That leaves Rep. Derrik Kitts (R-Hillsboro).  No one knows where 
his head is at on this bill.

I'm assuming, for the moment, that HB 2892 is dead and am prepared 
to move on with putting media spin on the whole thing that will 
help our cause, and then retiring to fight another day.  However, 
if Krummel, Barnhart et. al. are able to ressurect the thing (it 
IS Easter weekend, right?) I'll be very pleased.

* EFF Opposes State Level "Super-DMCAs"

Some States Pass, Others Consider Copyright Legislation

San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) last week
released a detailed analysis of the dangers posed by digital copyright
bills in individual states.

The product of stealth lobbying efforts by the Motion Picture
Association of America (MPAA), these new measures are aimed at
criminalizing the possession of what the MPAA calls "unlawful
communication and access devices," but are so broad that they
could ban critical security and privacy tools online as well as
restrict what machines you can connect to the cable, satellite, and
Internet lines in your home.

Because the bills are more extreme versions of the nationwide Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), pundits refer to them as "super-DMCA"
legislation.

Even before these activities crossed activists' radar, seven states
(Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Michigan, Oregon, Pennsylvania and
Wyoming) had already enacted them into law. Similar bills have been
introduced and are currently pending in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,
Massachusetts, Tennessee and Texas.

"The 'super-DMCA' measures represent special interest legislation that
dramatically expands the reach of the federal DMCA, which has already
put fair use, innovation, free speech and competition in peril," said
EFF Senior Intellectual Property Attorney Fred von Lohmann.
"Communication service providers -- meaning ISPs, cable companies, and
providers of digital entertainment services -- can use this
legislation to restrict what you can connect to your Internet
connection and cable or satellite television lines and can ban a
variety of tools critical to protecting the anonymity and security of
Internet users."

EFF strongly opposes these state super-DMCA bills as unnecessary and
overbroad. The proposed bills represent the worst kind of special
interest legislation, sacrificing the public interest in favor of the
self-serving interests of one industry.

* Electronic Frontier Foundation Supports Unlicensed Spectrum

Asks FCC to Broaden Wireless Broadcast Realm

San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) recently
supported a spectrum policy proposal from the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) and asked the FCC to acknowledge its First Amendment
obligation to allocate additional spectrum for unlicensed use.
Unlicensed use of spectrum would permit the expansion of wireless
communication, including Wi-Fi-style technology.

EFF asked the FCC to adopt the policy proposed in Notice of Inquiry
02-328, "Additional Spectrum for Unlicensed Devices Below 900 MHz and
in the 3 GHz Band." In this notice, the FCC seeks comment on the
allocation of additional spectrum for unlicensed use, similar to the
allocation that makes Wi-Fi devices possible. The Commission proposes
to carve spectrum for unlicensed use out of unused TV station
frequencies, which would dramatically increase the "open" spectrum
available for technological innovation.

"Spectrum regulation is a form of speech regulation," said EFF
Outreach Coordinator Cory Doctorow. "We support the Commission's
proposal to make more spectrum available for unlicensed applications
like Wi-Fi, moving us closer to a world where we all may speak over
the airwaves."

The FCC traditionally justifies regulating spectrum use on grounds of
scarcity, arguing that if anyone were allowed to broadcast, the
resulting chaos would create so much interference that no one would be
heard. The success of Wi-Fi and other uses of the unlicensed 2.4GHz
band demonstrates that unlicensed use models allow far more speakers
than the FCC's old "command-and-control" model of spectrum allocation.

* Editorial: Finding a Better Way with P2P

An edited version of the following editorial, written by EFF
senior staff attorney Fred von Lohmann, appeared in the Daily
Princetonian on Monday, April 14. The editorial appeared a few days
after Princeton undergraduate Daniel Peng was sued by 16 major record
labels for running a LAN indexing tool on the Princeton campus
network. Similar lawsuits were filed against three other
undergraduates at Renssalaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and Michigan
Technological University (MTU).

These lawsuits are only the most recent examples of the lengths to
which the entertainment industries are willing to go in their campaign
against what they call "Internet piracy." Increasingly, we are facing
a stark choice -- either continuing on our present course, with the
entertainment industries demanding and obtaining the power to
re-architect the Internet, or choosing a path that gets copyright
owners (and artists) paid without compromising our freedoms. The
following editorial explores a possible alternative.

~ ~ ~ ~

Finding a Better Way with P2P
Fred von Lohmann

Suing college students. Forcing ISPs to rat out customers. Petitioning
Congress for unprecedented vigilante powers. Deploying armies of
lawyers to sue technology companies. Threatening universities and
corporations. Demanding that ISPs disconnect tens of thousands of
Internet users. Hiring electronic enforcers to monitor computer users.

None of these efforts by the recording industry has put a single
nickel into the pockets of a musician. And none of these efforts has
slowed the spread of peer-to-peer ("P2P") file sharing. More Americans
have used file-sharing software than voted for the President. 

But we are paying a price. Responding to pressure from the
entertainment industry, the University of Wyoming is now monitoring
and recording all university Internet traffic. One hundred Naval
Academy cadets have been disciplined for file-sharing. Investment in
innovative P2P companies has dried up. Some members of Congress,
addled by a steady diet of propaganda and campaign contributions from
the entertainment industries, have suggested that the answer might be
to expel, or even jail, college students. Music fans are frustrated
and alienated from the musicians they love.

The hysteria over P2P has gotten out of hand. While protecting
copyright is a worthwhile endeavor, suing college students will not
get artists a penny more in royalties. Conscripting cash-strapped
universities to act as muscle for the entertainment industries is
absurd. Putting entire universities under constant surveillance is
simply unacceptable. 

There is a better way.

The problem is not P2P file sharing. In fact, file sharing is a
remarkable innovation that has enabled a world-wide community of music
fans to build the greatest library of recorded music in the history of
the world. 

The problem is that artists are not getting paid. It is time to
address the problem. 

The right answer is obvious: we need to collect a pool of money from
Internet users and agree on a fair way to divide it among the artists
and copyright owners.  There are many ways to do this.  One
interesting way is with something copyright lawyers call a "compulsory
license."  It might work something like this: Internet service
providers (including universities) might add a flat monthly surcharge
to the fees they charge for Internet access. Part of these fees would
be remitted to the record labels, while some would be paid directly to
the artists (who today frequently are victims of unfair contracts and
crooked royalty accounting). The fees would be divided up fairly,
based on popularity on the file-sharing networks, measured with
sampling methods like the Neilsen ratings that respect our privacy
while tabulating the P2P "charts." Having paid the fee, fans could
engage in private, non-commercial file-sharing without worrying about
being hunted down like criminals.

That's only one possible way to get artists paid; there are many
others to choose from. Systems like this are already in place in a
variety of other areas. Anyone can record a cover of a song, without
having to ask permission from the song-writer, so long as they pay a
standard fee per copy they sell. In the cable television arena, cable
networks do not have to ask for copyright permissions in order to
retransmit over-the-air programming. Instead, they simply pay a fee to
those who own the copyrights in the programs. Webcasters, similarly,
are allowed to play whatever they like, so long as they pay a fee set
by the Library of Congress. 

The university environment could be a testing ground for alternative
compulsory licensing models. In exchange for standing up strongly for
their users' privacy rights, universities could begin negotiating for
experimental campus-wide blanket licenses for file-sharing. 

After all, the reality is that file-sharing is almost certainly going
to remain a fact of campus life. The debate should be about getting
artists and copyright owners fairly compensated, not about how many
students should be expelled or how to install surveillance equipment
on campus networks.

Foundation (www.eff.org), a membership-supported nonprofit

All right people, if you haven't been paying attention, this is the part of the 
battle where Microsoft scuttles Bill 2892 in a back office deal and then we 
apply our own political pressure to bring it back to life.

This is the crucial leverage point. Cooper and Ken have carried the ball this 
far, but they are no match for Microsoft. If you ever thought about getting off 
your duff to promote Open Source/Free Software, NOW IS THAT TIME!

Heck you don't even have to get off your duff. Just send the letter below out to 
everyone you know in Oregon, then follow its advice and send the second half to 
your representatives and the committee members.

If you understand this issue - express yourself. This is a far more important 
element of representational democracy than voting. You can actually make a 
difference.

Do it. Sources tell me TODAY is the day to make your voice heard.

Dear Friends,

There is a Bill stuck in the Oregon legislature that could save the state budget 
MILLIONS of dollars by considering Open Source software like the Linux operating 
system. According to Friday's Oregonian, Microsoft lobbyists have managed to 
scuttle this Bill in closed door sessions.

Source: 
http://www.oregonlive.com/business/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/business/1050666959318260.xml

Microsoft has $30 billion to spend, we have nothing but your support. We need 
that support now, just to get the Bill considered openly and honestly.

IBM, Google, Amazon, Yahoo - all use Open Source software because it saves them 
money. Merrill Lynch uses it too (and they understand money). Here's a direct 
quote from Merrill Lynch:

"'...when modifications or repairs are needed, an open-source software customer 
can solicit for competitive bids, where a commercial software customer would be 
forced to turn only to the software's creator. That's an attractive proposition 
for a business."

Source: http://weblog.kestrelworks.com/archives/000199.html

It would be a travesty of justice to let Microsoft get away with this ploy. Our 
Schools need these $Millions far more than Microsoft needs more profits.

Please consider sending the letter below to your representatives. You can locate 
your representatives here:

http://www.leg.state.or.us/findlegsltr/findset.htm

Of course you can tell everyone, if you really want to send a message:
Full Senate http://www.injuredworker.org/Senate.htm
Full House http://www.injuredworker.org/House.htm

Thanks for your support. If we pull together, we can do great things in Oregon!

PS Send this on to your friends, too!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Elected Official,

I am concerned that Bill 2892 appears to have been waylaid in the House
General Government Committee(1). This bill would ask Oregon government agencies 
to consider using Open Source software alternatives, potentially saving the 
state millions of dollars.

Because the bill allows the Government to choose commercial products when that's 
the best choice, I don't see why the committee is preventing the
legislature from considering this bill. (Yes, I understand that Microsoft is
lobbying heavily against it).

In these budgetary times, I think it's wrong to not consider options for saving 
money that could be better spent on schools and healthcare.

Please use your influence to get this bill considered in the light of day,

Name
City, State

Since so many of us are out of work, why don't we fight back
by having some of us run for office?

It's a good idea!
But in order to run for an office
you'll have to have our own party 
or a support group with some kind of
unique and revolutionary program to attain
more voters without spending a fortune on
blabery advertisements.
Why don't we create our own political
party or movement to back up our ideas?
It could be named for example Open 
Source Freedom movement.

I think a political party should not be focused on
a particular issue. It should be broader and
embraces a philosophy that tells citizens/voters
what to expect from the candidates when the
issues are different. For example, I know what
to expect from the Pacific Green party and can
to predict what their stand on an issue is even
when the issue is not focused on environmentalism.

I first became aware of Bochs when I read about it on
this list. It might be a useful application for me,
although apparently not really easy to install.

Does anyone know whether it will work with the UPGRADE
version of Win98 (as guest OS)? At some point I
imagine the installation will look for proof of
ownership of Win95, which I have.

Without knowing anything more about your system, it sounds like you
might have a minorly broken Perl installation.  But you don't absolutely
need the Date::Calc package; I think you can disable whatever it does. 
(At least, I've ignored the notices and used it without it, to no
apparently ill effects.)

I just heard back from my Rep. Kate Brown. She says she is hearing a lot of 
interest in this bill. Keep it coming!

Subject: [PLUG] Bringing pine back to the foreground in X
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0304211527370.10124-100000@caddis.appl-ecosys.com>

  I use `joe' as the default editor in pine. Every now and then I accidently
hit ctrl-z rather than ctrl-x. The former sends pine into the background
while the latter exits the editor.

  When I make this error on the console, a simple `fg' brings back pine with
no loss. However, when X is running and pine's running in a virtual
terminal, entering `fg' does nothing.

  Does anyone know why? And is there another way of getting pine back
without losing the message in progress?

TIA,

Rich

Well for Scappoose School District I put a sound card into a machine
that I essentially donated and installed the drivers.  It was a 98SE system
and the driver tree was disgusting, but the part that bothered me the
most about the job was the proprietary nature of this Compaq.
I wonder if Linux could even be installed to it.  I am concerned that
XP is designed to be incompatible with LILO also.  I'm concerned about
integrated video cards in various motherboards that don't have that
great a set of features where their features can be matched in Linux
compatible alternatives yet they aren't Linux compatible.  The moral
of the story is that schools have computers that could be designed
to be Linux friendly yet they likely aren't and this is because these
machines are either offloaded on schools or they get in there by
other means, corporate donations perhaps?  If a manufacturer
puts something out that hasn't been ported to Linux maybe it should
be labeled so that those who don't want a non Linux ready machine
can more easily avoid it.  At first a soundblaster live which is supposed
to work supposedly on any PCI system was tried but it didn't work so
I put in an ISA card instead and upgraded my own system.  
Unfortunately, the system stopped working some time after I put 
the sound card in.  I volunteered to do this.

If you had to change numbering addressing for your site is likely to be 
broken for 24 to 48 hours after the change.  Remember to go to your domain
registrar and update the information about your site.  If it's your ISP how
easy, just check with them.  Update your domain registrar information, update 
your dns servers for your domain both private and public servers, and update
the ip assignments on your routers and gateways.  Your ISP should be able
to tell you shich number is the gateway.  Make sure your domain name 
registar has updated the Internet whois databases to point to where your 
name servers are now.  Remember that it takes usually 48 hours for that 
change to kick in.  If your clients are looking for your nameserver in the
wrong place, they won't be able to connect.

kill only works for PIDs (Process Id) because you only want to kill 1
process

killall matches by name, so the command you really wanted was

killall -HUP syslogd

We change ISP a couple of months ago. We only notice the problem when some
of our users complained, that they cannot access the webmail. We can access
and view the page within our network. It is only our mail server that is
having problem, our web server is up and running.

I called the main number, got transferred once and
spoke to someone. I told her that I'd be happy to
help organize volunteers from the 700+ people in
Oregon on the mailing lists I help maintain for BizNix
and PANUG. She sounded delighted and said she would
pass it on. I never heard back. I assumed that they
weren't really interested and the stories about how
PPC was just trying to intimidate Microsoft were
true.

Hmmm, does your mail server have a direct ip from you ISP or do you need to 
port forward to it from your web server?  IMP uses imap if I remember right 
so maybe imap is working from inside your network but not outside because the 
permissions don't allow the outside ip of your web server to connect to it.  
Does IMP work from inside your network?  I can't remember if webmail IMP 
config sets the actual ip it is being hosted at or just the hostname.  Maybe 
your web server is missing part of php that is needed to open imap 
connections.  I had trouble with IMP so I gave up on it.  At this point I'm 
planning on secure imap connections.  Another way to provide an off laptop or 
off workstation client like IMP is to provide X terminal support through 
a secure IPSec tunnel.  Maybe check out www.ltsp.org and look into 
that option if IMP proves too confusing to fix.  It might be slow for a lot
of other things over the net but it should be fine for email, especially if
you use a lite window manager in place of kde or gnome.  A site to look
at that micht help is www.openna.com.  Maybe look for Securing and
Optimizing Redhat Linux Ultimate Edition at www.tldp.org.  Redhat isn't
being advocated by me as "the best," though it's seems fairly reasonable
if you compile most of the software you want to use from other sources.  
Redhat seems to work a lot better for example when you use 
www.kernel.org source code. :-)

Take one server at a time, there's no point trying to fix 
IMP if it doesn't really need fixing because the actual problem 
is with the mail server.  What mail server do you use?  I use qmail 
because I couldn't figure out Postfix and my original sendmail 
server eventually broke down.  Qmail is a lot faster than 
sendmail and you can read the help files in the source code 
to install it fairly easily.  There are even migration hints for 
sendmail users though I've never tried that myself.  The only
thing I haven't implemented is Maildir as it seems fairly 
complicated though I guess there's no need for converting 
if you don't put mailspools on nfs shares which apparently isn't
all that great an idea anyways.  Which brings up a possibility,
if using maildir make sure your imap client isn't for the old
mailbox format.

For troubleshooting this I'd look at the log of changes from
the pre change environment to the current one first.  Check
the firewall closely, I think with both ipchains and iptables that
there are tools to check if the ports are open that IMP needs
to make it's imap connections successfully.  I've seen many
recommendations for ethereal and I like iptraf.

A quick thing to check if your IMP is a secure page is whether
or not the page itself can be accessed by your clients which 
may suggest an apache config file error.  With IMP one
gets php errors when something is broken that IMP needs
though I found it very difficult to troubleshoot with these
errors myself.

Check firewalls on both mail and web server, either firewall
misconfigured could be causing all your problems.

If you can get the equipment maybe create a simulated internet
with two machines and use three more to simulate your web
server, mail server, and a single client respectively.  The test
network only needs to troubleshoot the larger one so lower
power machines are probably fine.

I got the same reply which makes it look like buck passing to me.
Better to write Kitts and remind him of coming elections, including
his.He can push the bill to the floor, if his willing to back the move
over Krummel, otherwise, he's just taking up space.

Sounds about right.  Portland Community College has or had
a deal with Microsoft that involved the donation of a lot of equipment
but of course this meant for PCC that officially it has to be a Windows
shop.  I told Heckman once that my interest is becoming a Linux
systems professional which I got criticized for roundly though it was
interesting that he claimed he has had some experience with Linux
before the conversation ended.

Some people are playing a foolish game with Microsoft.  Perhaps
they don't want to change or this is a manifestation of some company
can be held responsible and more importantly sued.  The latter is petty, 
but quite possible.  Another possibility is that funding has been so 
uncertain for so long for Oregon schools that behaviors and attitudes 
have adapted in unfortunate ways.  There may not be much concern 
about wasted money because schools are a sacred cow which have
wanted, and in some places sadly needed , more for a long 
time.  What's telling is that we haven't heard about any administrator 
cuts of any kind yet  even though we've seen school days and 
teachers, etc., hit the chopping block  Are we flooding our schools with 
reform programs resulting in more administrators and high overhead?  
Is the money distributed right throughout Oregon's public school system 
on a statewide and per district level?  No if too much is going to IT or 
other overhead.

The politics of Microsoft have clearly invaded the public sphere 
where Microsoft dominance is accepted perhaps because of the harsh 
methods it used to get where it is, using the work of others of course, 
still in evidence today.  Amazing considering Microsoft is classified as 
a monopoly and should arguably be taking action to improve it's 
own reputation and status.  This political interfence in my opinion 
is unacceptable for a general focus academic environment that needs 
to focus on computer science and the related fields within that which 
span far more than an operating system owned by one man.

Requiring public institutions to consider open source alternatives may be the
medicine that's needed.  Perhaps it will provide the political cover to choose
alternatives to Microsoft.  What I'd really like to see is new donation laws
regulating the strings that can be attached and I'd like to see Microsoft's
software licensing practices reviewed by the courts in light of how XP 
violates people's right to privacy with it's ability to collect any 
information from a system it is installed on.  Companies with tons of money
shouldn't influence the choice of software anymore more than the
brilliant individual with very little or no money.  The cost of buggy software
is quite high and individual discomfort with computers because of
privacy or other abuse will only have negative impacts on the high tech
sector as a whole.  I doubt many people are going to want to vote from
a Microsoft Windows workstation, so far it hasn't happened yet.

If the government would seperate the application and operating system
divisions of Microsoft and not allow these new companies to enter into 
exclusive secret agreements with each other it would go a long ways 
towards opening things up.  This should have been done already.  
Oh well.

I think the best approach to promoting open source in public places is
to develop an impressive presentation and gain an understanding of what
our officials expect, want, and need in their offices.  Windows compatibility
and integration is a lot of work, so flick Redmond.  There are a lot of ways
to deploy Linux to be affective in different venues and for varying needs.
IBM is helping with their Linux ads, perhaps it's only a matter of time before
the software culture will change.

I work closely with PPS. When the big "MS audit" news hit, they
were literally flooded with requests to help.

I don't know what PPS's volumes were, but I know that MESD was
getting hundreds of requests per day at the peak.

Don't take it personally if your request fell through the cracks.
I certainly did not have the time return the thousands of emails
and phone calls I received...

Bad assumption. PPS has a large number of Linux servers and workstations.


As I've posted in the past, the *best* way to help schools with open
source software is to join a school-oriented project and help with
development and support. Here's a huge list of projects:

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0304220836160.20071-100000@caddis.appl-ecosys.com>

  OK, experts. Here's a real puzzle for you. What might make port 25
unreachable from one machine but not from another machine on the same
network?

  Postfix-2.0.7 worked just fine. I freshened the rpm to 2.0.8 and outgoing
mail stopped: smtp could not reach port 25 and the connection timed out,
deferring all outbound messages. Spent most of yesterday building
postfix-2.0.9 and BerkeleyDB-4.1.25 and upgrading postfix to that version.
Outgoing mail worked again -- for a few messages -- before port 25 once
again became unreachable. This time it was the queue manager (qmgr) that
showed up in /var/log/maillog.

  The postfix experts appear to be baffled by this and I'm certainly beyond
my understanding here. But, it's quite frustrating and distracting to me and
I'd _really_ like to resolve this ASAP. Your help is greatly appreciated.

  Synopsis: I can ping and traceroute my external IP address from both
hosts. The IP address is also reachable externally and all incoming mail --
including spam -- has no problems making it in. nntp, http, ftp, ssh and
other services work from the one workstation. The _only_ thing not working
is outgoing mail from that machine. This host is running sendmail and I can
use it to get mail out.

  This should be an interesting challenge to you. I hope that you can help
me to resolve the problem early today.

Many thanks,

Rich

It's very strange response from Rep. Wirth.
To me it looks like some kind of under table negotiations between
corruptioners or mafia clans. 
I could recognize four mafia clans mentioned in Rep. Wirth response.
First clan is an "opposition from some of the big high-tech
lobbyists".
Second clan is "members of the majority party (Republicans)".
Third clan is "few influential members of the House leadership".
Fourth clan is Rep. Wirth clan he belongs to.
With what mafia clan from listed here we should associate ourselves if
any?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0304221018500.21313-100000@caddis.appl-ecosys.com>

  Something here has badly broken and not even the folks on the
postfix-users list -- or Wietse -- can identify the problem. Here's a
synopsis:

  Postfix-2.0.9 running on host 'salmo'. When I'm logged in on 'salmo' (my
workstation, too), I can no longer send out mail. It's deferred beause the
connection times out at 'appl-ecosys.com'. This started last Thursday
afternoon.

  When I also log in on host 'caddis', as I am now, I can invoke pine and
send out mail with no problem, as long as it is addressed to an individual
or a mail list. When I try to send mail to all subscribers to a mail list I
maintain (all 88 of 'em), that, too, is deferred. I think that's because it
has to go through majordomo on 'salmo' and, therefore, also postfix. In
caddis' /var/log/maillog I see a reference to mail.appl-ecosys.com which is
a synonym for salmo.appl-ecosys.com.

  Why would port 25 be unreachable from one host but not another? I suspect
it has something to do with how postfix sees 'myhostname' and 'mydomain',
but I really don't know for sure.

  I recall from a year ago when I first installed postfix that I had to run
the 'hostname' command and change it to the FQDN 'salmo.appl-ecosy.com'
before postfix would start and run. Afterwards I changed it back to just
'salmo' because that's what all the other software expected to see.

  Is there a postfix guru here who can help me track down this problem and
get it fixed? It's taking a _lot_ of my time and frustrating everyone
involved.

Thanks,

Rich

You can check this assumption by telneting to port 25 from each box to the SMTP

Russell,

  That's part of the problem. On the host with postfix installed (and on
which I do my work), I cannot telnet to port 25 at my external IP address.
>From the other host (the one on which I'm writing this), I can. Anyone on
the outside can, too.

  Could it be a firewall problem that keeps one internal host from reaching
port 25 while allowing another to do so?

  Let me amend this: I now cannot telnet to port 25 from this networked
host.

  Firewall problem?

  I want to reboot the firewall machine but I would feel much more
comfortable having someone check my configuration on floppyfw-2.9.1 before I
do so. I've all the config files (current version and new version) tarred up
and ready to be checked for consistency by a different pair of eyes.

  Any volunteers? Please?

Can you telnet to port 25 on some other machine with a mail server?
telnet  mail.aracnet.com 25 
would be a good test.

Is there an smtp server running on this external machine you are
trying to access?

Message-ID: <1051037000.1775.22.camel@sparticus.coopnkass.com>

Dear Friends,

Never have I been so proud to be a member of this community. By your own
initiative, you have written, called, and met with your Representatives
regarding HB 2892. During this crucial phase, I ask you to continue to
push for this bill; I cannot stress enough how critical this is; a
strong showing of public support will make the difference, guaranteed.

As many of you know, much activity has surrounded HB 2892 in the past
few days. Last Friday, the Oregonian ran a front-page article in the
Business section with the headline, "Stiff opposition derails
open-source measure." Industry group Lobbyists from Microsoft, the
American Electronic Association, and others have worked hard to "make
this Bill go away."

Guess what? Thanks to all of you who have written and called, this bill
has _not_ gone away. I thank each of you who have taken the time to
write or call your Representative or Senator in support of HB 2892.

Further, you can be sure that myself and others will continue to work
diligently toward the passage of this bill. There is no question that I
will do my very best to see this bill pass into law, and I won't give up
on this bill without a fight, of that you can be certain.

There is every chance that we can continue to move this bill forward
through hard work and continued vocal support of this bill. I am not
exaggerating when I say that your support can very well make the
difference. Please take just a few moments to write to your
Representative or Senator in support of HB 2892. The Oregon Legislature
has a web page that lets you automatically write your Legislatures here:

  http://www.leg.state.or.us/writelegsltr/writeset.htm

For those of you who are now just getting up to speed with HB 2892, you
may view HB 2892 itself, the Bill's amendments, and several news
articles here:

   http://www.mwvlug.org/legislation/index.html

Also, here is a brief overview:

HB 2892, or the "Open Source Consideration Bill" is a bill currently in
the General Government Committee that calls for the consideration of
Open Source Software whenever State agencies make IT software procurment
decisions.

HB 2892 is an important Bill for several reasons:

   1) HB 2892 will likely save the State of Oregon millions. The
Department of Administrative Services (the central purchasing arm of
the for Oregon) estimates that there are over 53,000 PC's and over 2,300
servers in use by State agencies. This does not count machines used by
Oregon counties or cities. Clearly, if these computers ran software
that do not carry recurring fees or usage restrictions, the State will
definitely see a fiscal benefit. I call to critics of this statement to
both the verbal and written testimony of Oregon educators and to Q3 2002
SEC filings from Amazon.com; they claimed a savings of 17 million in
just one quarter!

  2) This bill helps level the playing field for companies competing for
Government IT contracts. As many of you know, Microsoft controls over 90
percent of all of the PC Operating systems and the desktop Office Suite.
This bill encourages competition by requiring the State to consider Open
Source when procuring software for the State.

  3) This bill will help businesses in the State not only with the
leveling of the procurement playing field discussed above, but also
because the focus is now more on services rather than costly software.
Further, the money that the State saves in licencing costs could be used
to enhance service to the public or to create jobs by helping Oregon
business. This, I think we all can agree (except the industry trade
groups) is preferable to sending license fees out of State.

Critics of the bill argue that this legislation is simply not necessary
because there exists today an open process by which the State may make
it's software purchasing decisions.

Yeah, right.

While there is no official law that says that the State cannot choose
one software product or another, as the old saying goes, "nobody ever
got fired for buying Microsoft." Those who are experienced in IT can
tell you that, like many other fields, managers are often apprehensive
to change their habits, even if the alternative offer more benefit at a
reduced cost.

Secondly, it has been my observation that as many businesses consider
Open Source solutions, the Business Software Alliance seems to have an
uncanny knack for dropping by with a "Software Assurance" audit at just
the right time. We know that this happens in Government too, as
evidenced by the BSA's "random" audit threat to Portland School
Districts last year.

That is definitely not an open marketplace.

Further, Jim Craven, lobbyist for the American Electronics Association,
on Friday told the Oregonian, "Our concern with the bill is the mandate
to state purchasers that they 'shall' do this or 'shall not' do that."

This is basically a falsehood. It implies that "shall consider" equals,
"shall procure Open Source." This Bill simply asks for the IT decision
makers of Oregon to consider Open Source while they are making IT
software purchasing decisions.

Oh, by the way, when you go out to the American Electronics
Association's web sight and search their member directory, guess who we
find:

   Microsoft
   MN - Bloomington    Division

   Microsoft
   TX - Austin    Division

   Microsoft Corporation Bellevue Sales
   WA - Bellevue    Division

   Microsoft Corporation Boise Sales
   ID - Boise    Division

   Microsoft Corporation Denver
   CO - Denver    Division

   Microsoft Corporation Ft. Lauderdale Sales
   FL - Fort Lauderdale    Division

   Microsoft Corporation Orange County
   CA - Irvine    Division

   Microsoft Corporation Portland Sales
   OR - Portland    Division

   Microsoft Corporation Sacramento
   CA - Sacramento    Division

The list goes on. You may view the member list for the American
Electronics Association on their web site here:

   http://www.aeanet.org/default.asp


There's still a long way to go. If you have not written or called your
representative please take a moment to do so; during this precarious
moment with the bill, I'm not exaggerating when I say that it is you who
will make the difference. Keep up the good work!

HB 2892 is clearly a non-partisan win-win bill for the State of Oregon.
It saves Oregon money, it promotes open standards, and it gives the
State more control over public data.

I'll keep you posted.


Very Truly Yours,

Some distros don't install telnet anymore..unless you specify it..for
security reasons.

Rod,

  Downtown hotels are more expensive than those on the fringes. The ones I
could suggest in the Gresham area are not on the MAX line. A google search
might be useful.

Subject: [PLUG] HB 2892 - Fight for what you believe (fwd)
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0304220224190.19654-100000@sco302.DavidMandel.com>

I have been sort of quiet about HB 2892, but I done some things
behind the scenes.  I don't really know how the group feels
about this bill, but I suspect most of us favor the bill.
Given this assumption, I have written a number of letters
which make it sound like the group supports HB 2892.
I also tryed to testify at the committee hearing a couple
weeks ago, but couldn't because of time limitations for
testimory.  I don't know if any of my letters have done any
good, because I sure haven't gotten much feedback, but ...

Finally, I want to make a couple recommendations for people
writing letter and doing other things to support this bill.

    (1)  HB 2892 has nothing to do with Microsoft.
         Many of the representatives don't understand or believe
         all the bad things Microsoft has done.  Thus, bashing
         Microsoft is likely to be counter productive.

    (2)  Why do we need HB 2892?  Won't it give special breaks to one
         particular type of software?
         The big name industry groups are claiming that they simply
         want a level playing field, so the state can purchase the
         best software.
         We Open Source people are not addressing this argument at all.
         Saying that Open Source software is high quality and/or cost
         effective isn't relevant.
         Instead, we must argue that:
             -  Open Source is so special that it is in the public
                interest to give it a special break.
         or else
             -  Open Source software uses such a different business
                model that we need HB 2892 to get equal consideration.

    (3)  Many of us make our living creating and supporting Open Source software.
         The opponents to HB 2892 have tryed to portray the Open Source
         community as unemployed idealistic socialists who write
         software in a spare time.  We have a Republician legislature
         which is very friendly to small business.  I would like them
         to see the Open Source community as consultants and writers
         and high tech businessmen who make their living from Open Source
         software.

    (4)  Open Source Software needs to be considered because
         it can save the state significant money.
         I think our legislature and our governor understands
         budgets and will probably be proposing a tax increase.
         Can they expect the citizens to pass such an increase
         when the state is wasting money on things like software
         licenses they don't need?

    (5)  Finally, there are all the issues around Open Data and
         open access to state records.
         I think this is extremely important, but I haven't been
         pushing arguments along these lines, because I'm not sure
         they would influence many of our current legislators.
         However, I may be wrong about this.

                                          Sincerely,
                                          David Mandel

Subject: [PLUG] HB 2892 - Fight for what you believe

All right people, if you haven't been paying attention, this is the part of the
battle where Microsoft scuttles Bill 2892 in a back office deal and then we
apply our own political pressure to bring it back to life.

This is the crucial leverage point. Cooper and Ken have carried the ball this
far, but they are no match for Microsoft. If you ever thought about getting off
your duff to promote Open Source/Free Software, NOW IS THAT TIME!

Heck you don't even have to get off your duff. Just send the letter below out to
everyone you know in Oregon, then follow its advice and send the second half to
your representatives and the committee members.

If you understand this issue - express yourself. This is a far more important
element of representational democracy than voting. You can actually make a
difference.

Do it. Sources tell me TODAY is the day to make your voice heard.

--------------------------------

Dear Friends,

There is a Bill stuck in the Oregon legislature that could save the state budget
MILLIONS of dollars by considering Open Source software like the Linux operating
system. According to Friday's Oregonian, Microsoft lobbyists have managed to
scuttle this Bill in closed door sessions.

Source:
http://www.oregonlive.com/business/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/business/1050666959318260.xml

Microsoft has $30 billion to spend, we have nothing but your support. We need
that support now, just to get the Bill considered openly and honestly.

IBM, Google, Amazon, Yahoo - all use Open Source software because it saves them
money. Merrill Lynch uses it too (and they understand money). Here's a direct
quote from Merrill Lynch:

"'...when modifications or repairs are needed, an open-source software customer
can solicit for competitive bids, where a commercial software customer would be
forced to turn only to the software's creator. That's an attractive proposition
for a business."

Source: http://weblog.kestrelworks.com/archives/000199.html

It would be a travesty of justice to let Microsoft get away with this ploy. Our
Schools need these $Millions far more than Microsoft needs more profits.

Please consider sending the letter below to your representatives. You can locate
your representatives here:

http://www.leg.state.or.us/findlegsltr/findset.htm

Of course you can tell everyone, if you really want to send a message:
Full Senate http://www.injuredworker.org/Senate.htm
Full House http://www.injuredworker.org/House.htm

Thanks for your support. If we pull together, we can do great things in Oregon!

PS Send this on to your friends, too!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Elected Official,

I am concerned that Bill 2892 appears to have been waylaid in the House
General Government Committee(1). This bill would ask Oregon government agencies
to consider using Open Source software alternatives, potentially saving the
state millions of dollars.

Because the bill allows the Government to choose commercial products when that's
the best choice, I don't see why the committee is preventing the
legislature from considering this bill. (Yes, I understand that Microsoft is
lobbying heavily against it).

In these budgetary times, I think it's wrong to not consider options for saving
money that could be better spent on schools and healthcare.

Please use your influence to get this bill considered in the light of day,

Name

Turn on "regular expressions" then use $

Now be careful, you want to make sure you select first, and have clicked
"current selection only."

But want you really want is a "reformat" command.

So I looked in help.  No luck.

Then I said, hey I am running the beta!  I can record macro.

So I opened a new doc.
I typed some text with paragraphs.
I hi-lighted the text.
I select tools->macro->record
I hit CTRL-F for find.
I entered $ in the find
I entered a space in the replace
I clicked on regular expressions.
I check selection only.
I hit replace all.
I hit save.
I clicked stop macro.
I saved as "Standard->Module1->Reformat"
I then clicked Assign.
I went to keyboard.
I went to CTRL-T in shortcut keys
In function I selected Openoffice BASIC Macros->Standard->Module1
I selected Reformat
I clicked modify.

It works.  Please note though, this does not take into consideration
paragraphs that end in . needing two spaces to follow, or lines that end
in spaces, or what not.  This is like Join in vi.

A better macro would select the current paragraph.  Right now it will
probably reformat the whole document if nothing is selected.

I was looking into this software to replace wuftpd but it appears to cost 
money.  I don't want to put wu back as evidently it's security problems
are substantial and few seem to think they are being fixed.  How do I 
serve an old chrooted wu-ftpd archive using say sftp or http?

Do you have tcptraceroute installed?  

Something like:

tcptraceroute mail.host 25

This should tell you where the packets are being held up anyway.

Good luck

  Thanks to a fellow named Don at Black Sun Communications, somewhere on the
right coast, the problem is solved.

  Turns out that in /etc/postfix/main.cf there are two 'relay' variables. I
had them set (believing that was the right thing to do based on all my
reading last year prior to installing postfix). Versions from 1.x through
2.0.7 couldn't care less what those variables had stuffed in 'em. However,
2.0.8 and up _do_ care that they have _anything_ in them for my small
network. Commenting them out and restarting postfix worked like a massive
enema on the mail queue and all's working again as it should be.

  I'd still like someont to check my configuration of floppyfw-2.9.1 before
I take myself off the 'Net with a misconfigured set of iptables.

Thanks,

Rich

ncftpd is really nice and dos not cost money if you're willing
to live with a 3 concurrent session limit.

I'm trying to get a Linux Samba server to allow access
to groups in the Domain. I tried "valid users =
@groupname" but that seems to only allow groups from
the local /etc/groups file. The docs talk about Unix
groups and NIS groups, but I couldn't find mention of
Domain groups. I would think this would be a
fundamental part of being part of a domain.

How does one give access to a Samba share to groups on
the NT Domain?

  What controls this? What service (other than init) should I restart to get

It's been almost 3 years for me but I chose Linux over FreeBSD because
FreeBSD, at that time, only supported one processor. For most folks
running small servers or a workstation that would be cool but it was
unacceptable for the application that I was building. With that said, 3
years is a really long time and things have likely changed. One thing
that I did notice in testing though, both platforms were only as stable
as the application :).

I run a single CPU system using OpenBSD as a stateful firewall for my 
home network. I've got dual NICS with one NIC connect to my cable modem 
and the other NIC runs into an 8 port switch. The default install is 
very secure with SSH being the only means to login into the box. 

I'm using Linux for my primary  workstation and other severs within my 
network. I don't need an SMP box for a firewall so using one of the 
freely available BSD OS's can be a reasonable choice. I've found 
OpenBSD's packet-filter "pf" rules much easier to understand and write 
than the sometimes clunky "iptables" or "ipchains" commands that Linux 
uses. I say this after running a Linux-based firewall for 4 1/2 years 
on my home network.

Something else to keep in mind is that what do you do if you ever need 
to run any sort of commercial applications under BSD? I haven't looked 
into it but I've had the need to run Oracle and BEA's WebLogic and 
since I was using Linux this wasn't an issue. I don't know if any of 
the BSDs can run these things. They might but I've never looked into 
the binary compatibilities or emulations that might be available under 
BSD.

For a dedicated file or print servers a BSD box with Samba works quite 
nicely in an office environment. I've got my old firewall test system 
with OpenBSD on it pulling print server duty at work now.

I've been using FreeBSD 4.6 since January.  Prior to that I ran SuSE for
about 3 years, and Slackware for 2 years before that.

Main things that I've noticed -

install process is a bit primitive, compared to current Linux distros I'm
familiar with (reminded me of the first Slackware install I did).  Disk
partitioning not as straightforward as Linux fdisk.

FreeBSD attempts to put tight controls on what gets installed where on the
machine.  'Core' system files go into /usr/bin or /usr/sbin; *all*
additional applications go into /usr/local.  This way the base system
files can be completed wiped and reinstalled without affecting later
user-added files.  If you use the 'ports' collection to add software,
everything should be added according to FreeBSD's rules.  (Tradeoff, of
course, is that very cutting-edge stuff will take a while to get ported.)

In general, the standard way to add or update files on the system is by
compiling from source.  There are utilities that make it a one-command
operation to add/upgrade any single ported application, or base system
files, or indeed the entire system.  FreeBSD has its own package database
mechanism that tracks software versions. Needed dependencies can be
resolved, downloaded and rebuilt automatically.  Because things are built
from source, dependency hell seems to be rare.  If you install via the
ports collection, applications are (in theory) guaranteed to get installed
in the right location.

FreeBSD has a Linux 'emulation' mode, and binaries that run under Linux
often run under FreeBSD.  No guarantees there, though.

Hardware support seems OK, though I'm not a very cutting-edge hardware
person.  SMP is supported.

In general, the impression that I've gotten is that FreeBSD is pretty
tightly controlled, and things seem to work together well.  I've upgraded
things much more frequently since I've been running FreeBSD, because the
process is so simple and because it rarely causes problems.  One thing
that did cause me problems was moving to XFree86 4.3 from 4.2 - X simply
wouldn't run after that, and I had to go back to 4.2, which I reinstalled
off my install CDROM - haven't spent the time to investigate that yet.

Documentation is adequate.  The man pages are good, but it's often not
easy to know where to look in the man pages.  There aren't any documents
filling the 'HOWTO' niche (or if there are, I haven't found them yet).
The handbook
(http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/index.html) is
good for an introduction to the system.


I've been satisfied with FreeBSD so far, and will stick with it for a
while.

I have to wonder about the bill in its current form. When it was first talked
about, the proposal seemed right on the money in that any non-free software
purchase required justification. It seems everywhere I've worked, I've had to
justify all purchases and have had to have an approved budget to charge against
meaning at least to levels of justification and buy off. I've never however had
to justify a free solution to purchasing as it was never purchased. I've had to
justify a free solution to a technical review, and a business practices review
( ROI ), the same as any non-free solution. But no purchasing checks and
balances where involved.

As free alternatives are available and widely know about in company management
levels today, it seems that a company that does spend money on software, would
want to verify why, in a business sense. It seems like it would be prudent and
necessary to make sure the companies interests are being served by making sure
a check is installed to make sure all avenues are examined before money is
spent and there is someone accountable for saying so.  Why should the
government be any different? 

Isn't the bill this simple: We need a purchasing check in the State government,
so the purchase requester has to go on record as saying that this is the best
investment at this time and that all know avenues have been explored? 

Thank you
Russell

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0304222235560.28281-100000@sco302.DavidMandel.com>

I planned on going to the Linuxfest in Bellingham on Saturday,
but had to cancel for personal reasons.

I reserved a exhibit booth for PLUG at the event, but I won't be
there to man it.  If anyone is going to Bellingham and want to do
anything with this booth, please feel free to use it.
Originally, I thought I would use it to demo Knoppix since people
on the LinuxFest mailing list have been complaining about the lack
of things for new Linux users.  However, maybe it would be useful to
use it discuss House Bill 2892, since this is getting national
interest.  In any case, it doesn't matter to me - because I
won't be there.

Subject: [PLUG] iptables curiosity with user defined chains.
Message-ID: <20030423060517.3135.qmail@goose.robinson-west.com>

I got a nifty idea to create two user defined chains, one for input rules and 
another for output rules, needed for a web server.  So I flush these chains
first in the init script that starts apache and proceed to propragate the 
server rules into them flushing them again when I stop the server.  I
also put lines in to cause my INPUT and OUTPUT chains in my firewall
to add these chains to their rulesets.  The only problem I've noticed 
is that the way In have it set up stopping the firewall and trying to
restart the web server first will cause it to try to flush a nonexistent
chain and then add rules to it.  If I create the user defined chains
in my apache script can I have a jump statement to an undefined chain
or should I not delete user defined chains in the master firewall script?!?
Maybe firewall stop should be a deletion of all chains followed by a flushing 
and recreation of the ones that are supposed to exist for my other scripts.
With opening the ports when I start apache I'm a little tighter 
than if I set these ports to be open all the time in my master iptables
firewall.  Now if only I could figure out how to put prerouting and forwarding
rules into user defined chains.  One of the nice things about using custom
chains is that it makes it easy to pull transient rules out of your main
firewall.

This is what I came up with for right before I compiled apache_1.3.27.  The

to the ones above which I can't seem to duplicate:

     CFLAGS="-DDYNAMIC_MODULE_LIMIT=0 " ? turns off module support ?

     --enable-rule=SSL_SDBM                               What was this for?
     --disable-rule=SSL_COMPAT                        I think this is enabled.

For mod_perl I used mod_perl-1.27 and for mod_ssl I used 
mod_ssl-2.8.14-1.3.27.  The instructions I've been looking at
are in Securing and Optimizing Redhat Linux Ultimate Edition.
One thing I forgot to do in httpd.h under the apache source tree
is increase the server max from 256 to 1024.  Would I have to
start over fresh to fix that mistake or can I change the header
file and just run make again?  Apache's compilation and
installation would be a lot easier if someone would create a
series of menuconfig like, I'm thinking the kernel, scripts for it.
It's so much easier to see all the options and tag the ones 
you want with a tool like the latter.

Subject: [PLUG] Upgrade kde or switch to gnome?
Message-ID: <20030423081655.3573.qmail@goose.robinson-west.com>

I am using the kde that comes with Redhat 7.2 and I am wondering what 
specifically needs to be done to get a newer version of kde hopefully with
fewer kmail, etc., bugs installed maybe in a different directory?  How many 
programs will need to be upgraded that are kde specific etc. and is there
a quick way to find out?

There has been some suggestion that I go to gnome instead because gnome
doesn't depend as much on tons of packages and it supposedly reconfigures
better than kde.  I've also heard that there are problems with using kde 
commercially where gnome has no issues at all that way.  How do I migrate
kde mail spools to some other software under gnome?  Suposedly a lot of
gnome progams don't need gnome to run which is a plus.

I have a minimum no X 7.2 box that I can probably take the package list off
to see which ones I don't have to consider in an uninstall.  As far as kmail's
address book and various kde data is this in a few spots I can easily find?
The easiest would be to pull the data off, uninstall kde, and compile a new
version from source probably.  Is it true that a new version of kde can be 
installed in a seperate tree and if so how can I switch between new and
old version to see if the new version works before dumping old?

All of the directory paths that you mention here can be put into
Apache's config-layout file at the root of the source tree. I find that
adding these here and using --with-layout instead a much easier way to
remember settings and it's nice to minimize the chance for fat-fingering
the configure script.

It's been a long time since I did a mod_perl in DSO, I build it in
statically when I use it, is there a need to do an --add-module option
for libperl.a still or did that go away?

The --server-uid, gid and max can all be set/reset in httpd.conf if you
don't care to add it to the configuration at compile time.

Give Konstruct a try:
http://konsole.kde.org/konstruct/

I'm using it right now and installed it to try out the new KDE 3.1.

It's a tool that fetches and builds (compiles) all the KDE packages and
their dependencies (not all of them, though).  It installs into:
~/kde3.1.1 by default, so uninstalling is just a matter of removing that
directory.

Hey, Dan, just the guy I was looking for.  My wife has a computer form
her school (WinXP) which of course belongs to some group? there. We have
my computer running Samba which a Win98 can see and use fine. The WinXp
can see the Samba share, but when it tries to log on, it says it already
tried that user(same user on both Win computers) and it didn't work.

Before my disk crash, I had this working, but I don't remember what I
did differently. Does this ring any bells.

I think (I'm not sure) that you have 30 days to evaluate
the software using more than 3 concurrent connections.
If you like it and you plan on using more than 3
concurrent connections, you pay the money. If you can
live with a 3 connection limit, you don't pay the money.

Yes, but he says that you're breaking the law if you use a
firewall. Even with Oregon's DMCA law, that's not the case
because the law states:

"...for the purpose of facilitating in any manner the theft or
disruption of communication services,"

Clearly, a firewall does not involve theft of data and
it does not disrupt communications between consenting
parties to the communication.

I'm not saying that Oregon lawmakers are not idiots for
passing the law, however. The author of this article may
be one.

But Open Source is not $Free.  Generally we are not talking about
secrataries downloading aps.  We are talking a dept, issuing a RFP, or
an RFQ and a number of suppliers sending in Proposals or Quotes.  This

"Yes" with some caveats for suitability and such.  This is actually
where the problem is given that most OSS doesn't have a vendor behind it
to respond to RFPs or "put in the lowest bid."
HR 2892 essentially tries to recognize that fact and include the
"vendorless" OSS in the purchasing process so that it can be evaluated
on a "value for money" basis, rather than not at all as is frequently
the case at present.

  That's interesting, Russell. I discovered that ^z did suspend pine so now
I know what key I hit by mistake when I do this with a virtual terminal
under X. That works. However, when I'm at a shell prompt I also cannot
switch consoles.

To me an RFP  being issued means that there are not enough resources in house
to do what the RFP is asking, otherwise why bother with the expense of an RFP.
Without a vendor responding with a OSS solution, what good does looking at OSS
do, if there isn't anyone implement?  `

Now I'm confused, what is this bill trying to do? What issue does it solve?

Thank you
Russell

Hello Stephen,

I personally run a pretty fair number of different Operating Systems,
hardware, etc... Everything from MacOSX on a dual G4, Irix 6.5 on an
Indigo2, Solaris 9 on an UltraSparc, RedHat linux on x86, FreeBSD on
x86, and Windows where it is required for some random task. With all
these choices, I use FreeBSD for my router / gateway / firewall system.

I think a fair assessment is as follows:

FreeBSD is in my experience much more stable and faster than most linux
distros. Installing and upgrading software is extremely easy with the
ports system, though sometimes it takes a while for the latest version
to be added. Upgrading your entire system is fairly simple, and
compiling your own custom kernel is a lot easier than, say, RedHat is
(IMO). Pretty much anything to do with networking seems to be a great
deal faster and infinitely more stable on FreeBSD than Linux. I also
feel that the firewall rules are much easier to understand / implement.
Most linux apps will run on FreeBSD and work just fine under the linux
emulation layer, but if you have a need for a commercial application to
be actually SUPPORTED, then you really need to stick with Linux, most
likely RedHat. One large drawback from my perspective is that the Sun
J2SDKs are not native to FreeBSD. In order to run these, you have to run
them under Linux emulation... Which can be a huge pain in the butt.

I think FreeBSD is a much better way to go in general whether it be for
a workstation or a general server. It is a very robust and stable
system. However, if you have need for either the latest in Java
compatibility or commercial application support, you will want to stick
with something else (Sun or RedHat generally).

Anyone with experience in any of the *BSD's have any thoughts on the

Thank you all for your replies.  I am reading the handbook atm on 
freebsd.org.  I plan on setting up a small router (firewall) / web / samba 
server on my home lan.  I know how to do all of that in Linux (slackware), 
so I shouldn't have too much trouble hehe.  From what I have been reading, 
it looks like how device drivers and system software are set up that will 
get me for a bit.  Have to get used to them.

I will keep my eyes open for some kind of howto archive on freebsd, those 
were my life saver in my early Linux days.

Cheers. =)

  A couple of thoughts for your consideration. First, for your firewall
consider OpenBSD. From everything I've read -- including Mick Bauer's new
book, "Building Secure Servers with Linux" -- that's the most secure *BSD
out.

  Second, read the above book before putting your servers on the firewall
box. Instead, make your firewall box triple-headed (i.e., three NICs) and
put your public servers on a separate box, on its own NIC, and separated
that way from the rest of your lan.

Yeah I know but I was hoping to get an 'insiders' perspective :-)  I'm not
totally cheap but hoping for a little better than $125/night.  Of course
when my wife and I end up in Seattle we go for the outlying areas but then
we have a car and a place to park it or my son to play chauffeur.

Message-ID: <Law15-F69wNdZynfLz800014c76@hotmail.com>

Thanks Rich, payday I think I will invest in that book, the reviews on 
amazon seem to be in favor of it.  Never thought of having three nics in the 
firewall server.  Is the idea to have the public servers on their own boxes 
plugged into the firewall directly, and have the other nic plugged into a 
switch for the lan, and have teh third plugged into my cable ?

Sounds very logical, never really thought about that before.  How similar is 
open bsd compared to freebsd ?  Are they like slackware compared to redhat, 
or are the kernels developed by separate groups unlike the linux kernel ?

Thanks agian for the help Rich

I'm not a big fan of going to BSD myself.  I think in part that there's a 
notion that BSD is a full source tree for all your utilities, OS, etc. and 
that this is therefore better.  I think it very likely that much of the 
software will be the same and I wonder what the factions are going to
be like.  Also, what licenses does one get into with BSD?  I'd rather
have a finished widely accepted standard for what a Linux system has,
vendor neutral, to study from and another set of documents on where 
Redhat strays as well as good Redhat alternatives for say graphical
programming under X.  Gentoo seems worth looking into.  Forcing 
compiles from source solves a lot of problems installing programs, 
however, how many problems are caused by optimizations that turn 
out to be more trouble than they are worth or hardware designs that 
are proven foolish.  Compilation is an interesting tool and using program 
design to implement optimizations in a more portable manner is a 
good tools also.  It takes time to compile a whole entire system where 
just because you can compile it doesn't mean your pre compilation 
decisions are going to be wise for your needs or easy to make.
GNU is building a standard environment for what a person should see
in a source package, how about BSD?  Linux is Posix compliant,
is BSD?  Linux is also clustering ready, I don't know about BSD.
The other thing with BSD is that developement could be stymied 
compared to Linux.

All,

I came across a recomendation of Lucent wireless cards in the archive from a
year ago. I was wondering if anyone had used the Lucent Agere ORiNOCO and how
difficult it was to setup on Redhat.

thanks,

If you want to stay in the cheap, why not consider either of the two
AYH hostels in Portland. They both have good bus access to downtown
where the conference is.

Here are the entries from a directory:

I have plenty of friends who use and are happy with Easystreet. However, if
you want to NAT multiple boxen and/or run a non-commercial server on your
DSL line, you'll need Easystreet's Enthusiast account. For 1.5M/128k you'll
pay them $39.95/mo (does not include Verizon/Qwest charges). That's why I've
got an Aracnet (aka SpiritOne) account. They don't require a different class
of account in order for me to NAT my 4 boxen (including my web server). I
pay $23.45/mo (actually, $117 for 6 mos. at a whack) for 1.5M/128k (Enhanced
Bronze plus)...

    http://www.spiritone.com/services_dsl_verizonpricing.htm

I've had very few problems during the ~3 years I've had DSL w/Aracnet.

If you're in Qwest territory, you're going to pay through the nose at either
ISP :-\

I'll add I have a New Edge Networks DSL plus we resell(?) the product and
I've yet to hear a complaint about the quality.  Sometimes getting an
install can be a lengthy process but it's to be expected for non
shared-line SDSL (business grade).  The shared-line ADSL sold to the
masses (consumers) usually has no CIR or QOS guarantee.
   We have more problems with the wire owners and the upstream bandwidth 
providers than with New Edge.

I'm an Easystreet customer and I have to say that the service is great.
When there is a problem, and Easystreet problems are very rare, they
take ownership, jump on the issue and stays on it until it is corrected.
They have a very competent staff and will treat you right. 

For the most part, the service at Verizon (the DSL wire provider) is ok
but getting them to own issues is a little more tricky.

I am happy with the service I have received over the

I'm curious if Comcast is offering to not raise your

cable or if it is an across-the-board rate increase.

If you sign up for cable service with them, you get basic cable free then.
Actually you pay ten for the cable then they discount the other $10.

I am also thinking of switching, but my question is about the modem that
Qwest is now using. Is there any after market modems that you can just buy
and not have to rent?

As some one else said, if you sign up for even basic cable
at $10/mo., they will discount your cable internet by $10,
so essentially the internet is the same price, or the cable
TV is free....  depending how you look at it.

But, I have satellite TV, and don't need, don't want Comcast
Cable TV, and am furious that they show up on the scene after
the ATTBI buyout and say "Welcome to Comcast.  Please fork
over $10 more to pay for painting over the ATT logos on our
trucks and repainting the Comcast logo."  So far, that's the
only difference I've seen.

I like the internet service--it's fast and reliable, but I
am ticked at the price hike. If it had been $2 or $3, I
probably would have ignored it (ATTBI just raised it $2-3 6
months ago), but ~25% price increase is bogus.

Worst part is I'm in an area of Salem that still does not have
DSL service, not from QWest anyway.  I know of no other 
telcos who would provide the basic wiring/switching, so I'm
faced with paying up to Comcast or going back to 56k--YUCK!!

Any other anti-Comcast sentiment I can ride?

Don't know if this could be the "SignorSeal" reg key thing. You might
google on that to get the full story.

You might try nuking the WinXP user and recreating it. It "just

The Orinoco Gold PCMCIA card and Orinoco Mini-PCI card I've used w/
Redhat 8.0 and Redhat 9 both worked "out-of-the-box", I just plugged
in my ESSID and my WEP key (futile, I know) in "neat" er,

I would rather pay a bit more for DSL, since its fairly stable in pricing
for some time, about $54-55 w/modem rental.
Anyhow it is bribary to sign up for cable service.

If you are buying a new wireless card I heard here

that one of the Cisco cards was particularly good.

This is all FUD.  You know not of what you speak.

It's like me saying

        I'm pretty sure OpenBSD won't give you cancer.
        What about Linux?  Huh?  Where is the *hard evidence*?

Please to not be spouting such nonsense.

I make no false claims about OpenBSD, nor derisions about Linux.

I do claim that OpenBSD is more secure than Linux, as borne out by
openly available data.  Yes, part of the reason is that Linux has a
large market share, and hence a better target for the script kiddies.
But part of it is also just a fundamental difference in development
philosophy.  And since I want to be able to sleep at night, I
appreciate both of those contributing factors.

Is it a big deal that I can't get the latest gadget for OpenBSD as a
simple source or binary RPM?  No.

Do I care that I don't run Linux binaries out of the box?  No.  But
I've read manpages that say that with a bit of work, I could run a
Linux binary if I chose.

And maybe that lets me optimize for security, and not gadgetry.  It
all depends on what you're optimizing for.  Others may chose gadgetry
or compatibility over security, or be willing to keep their system
behind a separate firewall (running OpenBSD :).  Not me.

I'm in the process of switching from Qwest (business class) DSL to 
Speakeasy.  My history with Qwest goes back to being one of the first
installs in Portland.

If you are looking for Linux friendly, WiFi Friendly, host server
(including games) friendly, with two static IPs by default and 1.5mbit 
down 768 up.  Speakeasy is a great way to go.  Modem is free after
rebate, so you own it.  Customer service is killer great.

Yes, I do get $50 if you sign up and tell them I refered you.  
Yes, I like them very much and would refer them even without the 
cash.

The best thing I've seen so far are the prism 2.5 chipset cards (Netgear
seems to be sticking with that chipset, so far) and the hostap drivers.

I can't tell you about a RedHat setup, but it acts just like a network
card with an extra layer of control.  I had to download the hostap
drivers, compile them against my kernel headers, install them, and
configure the modules for loading on boot.  The rest of the
configuration is done just like a network card, with wireless_ extras.

I rarely recommend purchasing from Fry's, but in this case, their return
policy makes it worth while.  The card makers have changed chipsets on
their cards, but didn't change the model number.  I bought two cards
(identical model numbers) that where supposed to have the prism chipset,
but only one of them worked with linux.

Good Luck

Ryan,

Maybe something you can pass on to your bosses:

The whole concept of Transedge frustrates me to no end.  As an ISP being
based in Vancouver and a wholesaler for New Edge we not only have to
compete with Qwest DSL and the price comparing that goes on and having
to explain to customers why it really isn't cheaper, but then we have to
compete with Transedge directly after we pay for each circuit monthly,
after we pay for an aggregation circuit, and the high cost for DSL
installation.  Something needs to be done that promotes the local ISPs
first before Transedge goes and grabs the customer.  Qwest does this, I
don't understand why New Edge doesn't.  I could be mistaken but I surely
have not received one DSL referral from New Edge.

Thank you,

  Yes. The ideal solution, according to Mick, is to have two firewalls with
a switch (or hub) in between. The public servers (http, ftp, smtp) are then
between the two firewalls and isolated from both the internal network and
the nasty world of the 'Net. Of course, for those of us with SOHO or home
networks that's overkill.

  So, putting the cable modem into one firewall NIC (eth0), the public
server on the second (eth1) with its own subnet, and the rest of your lan on
eth2, with a different subnet, you gain a measure of increased security
compared with the servers on the firewall.

  I'm definitely the least knowledgeable person to ask. I've not used any of
them. What I do know of openBSD is that each binary is given a security
audit before inclusion and the whole distribution is oriented toward maximum
security. I'm starting to learn the differences between Slackware and Red
Hat, but I haven't dug deeply yet to really know all the ways they differ.
Give me a couple of months and I'll make sufficient mistakes to learn all
about Slack.

  When I get the new server/workstation built it will replace my current
one. I'll put the guts of the current one in a smaller box and make that the
public server. I'll take the other hard drive from it and put that in my
floppyfw box and install openBSD on it as the firewall. With three NICS. If
it's good enough to recommend, it's good enough for me to use here. :-)

  To get from your house to your ISP you may not have a choice. I've had
GTE/Verizon and have been very highly satisfied with them on all counts. My
ISP is Aracnet/SpiritOne, but there are many other fine ISPs in the area.

Generally the same licenses you get into with Linux, as there's very
little in the way of medium or large projects that compile on only one.
The BSD License is just as major a license as the GPL, and many projects
that are commonly used under Linux are licensed with the BSD license.
Linux's TCP stack is based on BSD's (as is most of the world).

references: BSD License:
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php

A few projects you might have heard of licensed under the BSD license:
TCL (scripting language that spawned/is related to TK, a widget toolkit)
Webmin (a web interface I use to admin my Linux boxen)
Enlightenment (a window manager, rather well known)
Blackbox (another window manager, also rather well known)
Freetype (truetype font replacement, used by most Linux dists)
SWIG (used by Perl, Python, Ruby, etc to provide access to modules
written in C/C++. If you use any scripting language, you probably use
SWIG)

That's just a brief list culled from the first five pages of
www.sourceforge.net 's list of BSD-licensed projects.

Note: BSD is an OSI-supported license, in other words, it is indeed Open
Source.

Yes, and the GNU tools are mostly platform agnostic*: that's why you
have to write Debian GNU/Linux, because GNU is NOT the same thing as
Linux. GNU tools compile on Linux, as they compile on BSD, and others.
BSD is Posix compliant, clustering ready (has native cluster solutions).
And I'm not sure what "that development could be stymied compared to
Linux."

reference: Here's FreeBSD's cluster mailing list:
 http://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-cluster 

FreeBSD has a 4 stable version and a 5 stable-experimental version,
which is the coming version but has only been out a year or so and is
therefore still in more active development. In fact, FreeBSD is far more
conservative than Linux in releases--stable to FreeBSD means proven
stable in production environment, unlike Linux where 2.4.0 is "stable"
(ever run it?) FreeBSD has run many gigantic sites: Hotmail was Apache
on FreeBSD before Microsoft converted it to Win2k. In fact, the
benchmarks generally show FreeBSD with Apache to be faster and more
stable than Linux with Apache.

While on the topic of *BSD, you should check out OpenBSD, the most
secure operating system in the world (1 remote root exploit in 7 years,
compared with Linux: many). NetBSD, the most portable operating system
in the world: they say if NetBSD doesn't run on it, and it's capable of
computation, it will soon. In fact, the motto of NetBSD is "Of course it
runs on NetBSD"

They're separate kernels and development spheres, though generally very
similar, so they shouldn't really be lumped together quite as much as
they are, and they certainly shouldn't be dismissed quite as easily as
they are. FreeBSD is a good replacement for Linux for the hardcore.
OpenBSD makes the most fabulous firewalls, as security really isn't a
concern, and if you happen to have an interesting system lying around
that you can't get anything else to run on it, NetBSD will probably run
on it.

While we're on the subject of "Is *BSD good enough to be taken
seriously," one major company has clearly shown that the answer is yes:
Apple. MacOSX is largely based on the *BSDs, especially FreeBSD, and
Apple is now the largest Unix software company in the world. MacOSX is
fabulous, for those who haven't tried it, though it takes some getting
used to if you're coming from Linux.

Oh, and since you mentioned Gentoo: Gentoo brags about emerge: it's what
makes them special in the Linux world. But emerge is just a port of the
portage system of FreeBSD to Linux. Gentoo on Linux is pretty much
FreeBSD a few years behind.

* in fact, Debian too is somewhat platform agnostic. Debian is the only
distribution that will actually run the HURD, which is GNU's kernel,
still in experimental stage. Actually, the HURD has been in experimental
stage since before there was a Linux. Linus's announcement of Linux
mentioned that it wouldn't probably be useful for anything because the
HURD would be out "any day now."

There's no reason why Debian couldn't build a Debian GNU/FreeBSD system,
though they haven't yet.

There is a Super 8 hotel out by the airport.  They have a shuttle that runs

the link: http://www.super8.com/
 or if you actually want to talk to someone.  You can call them at
1-800-800-8000.
It is about a 10 min shuttle ride to the airport, and I am not sure the time
by MAX into downtown.  There is also a car rental place right down the
street from the.  I do not remember which one though.

That's my input.

What has made openbsd more successfull than Linux security wise?
When it is said that openbsd is more secure than Linux is this overly
simplistic in light of many people straying from vendor choices for 
server programs to more secure alternatives: remove most servers 
and replace dangerous ones like sendmail and telnet with postfix or 
qmail and ssh respectively?  It's common to upgrade the kernel and
a person can do a lot to follow security problems as they come up
where Linux is getting better about this with time.  Clearly BSD has 
been around a long time but Linux still took popularity that it never
seemed to grab.  Linux must have some things BSD doesn't.
I thought 2.4 was bust at first but I'm now at the 2.4.20 level starting
to appreciate it more.  I would like to see the methods of adding drivers
to the kernel become straight forward enough to where a patch for
a non standard device for say 2.2.14 can easily be moved to a newer 
kernel.  I've outlived criticism of gcc's inline assembly where I am
suspicious of some Linux criticisms as the words of people who are
uncomfortable with it or simply don't know enough about it.  I imagine
every system has it's problems where security auditing is something
that can be done to any open source system easily.  Linux uses gnu
tools and perhaps other stuff from BSD land so perhaps these 
systems can be alike where they really ought to be.  Myself I am
not exciting about the thought of yet another operating system,
yuckk.  And about MacOSX, it isn't any smarter about failing to read
a disk than Windows 98 is.  I think Linux is the only system that is
capable of not crashing in that case compared against these
other two.  I suffered from severe pull down fatigue in MacOSX
and I couldn't find stuff.  Applixware was no wordperfect where
ultimately printing proved impossible because instead of an HP
6MP I only have the HP 6P on a Jetdirect 170X box.  No I don't
have Mac drivers for the network box that work on the Mac, a G4
system.

What I'm more curious about is can openbsd and Linux integrate well
and is openbsd perhaps a good system for building small network 
bootable utility images over trying to come up with a Linux initrd
system?

What does no CIR or QOS gurantee on standard DSL mean?  
I would think since DSL is always on that there has to be some
thouroughput guarantee, especially since it is compared to cable 
as the option where you get the quoted speed and not  
shared bandwidth with an unknown number of other people.
It is interesting that there are so many different DSL speeds
where some people seem to get better deals and others
worse.  It's evenmore complex than that, some folks will
have great download but less upload speed than even I 
work with.  In Scappoose you can't get a megabit without
taking out DSL service on two phonelines which because
of the phone company requires ordering phone service,
think $30 a month per line, twice.

> What has made openbsd more successfull than Linux security wise?

Every line of OpenBSD code, and I mean the kernel and all the stuff they
certify, is security audited by folks who know what they're doing. Many
eyes may be okay in practice, but a few good eyes has proven to be even
better. OpenBSD has only had one remote root exploit since its
inception.

It's true that once you start installing random stuff on it, you can
make it insecure, but that's true of anything. Linux dists frequently
come out of the box with security configuration issues (like RedHat's
many default passwords) or actual holes (like the various kernel, tcp
stack, and daemon buffer overflow mis-codes) that aren't easy to fix.
OpenBSD comes with none of these.

That said, I don't know anyone who uses OpenBSD as a workstation, or
even as a server for many services. Most people I know use it as a
firewall or a server for a few important services.

I don't think popularity is really a good way to judge worth. If it
were, we'd all be drooling over Longhorn.


>  Linux must have some things BSD doesn't.

At the moment, mindshare. Other than that, I'm not sure you can really
argue that the Linux kernel is fundamentally a whole lot better than any
of the BSD kernels. AFAIK the NUMA patches haven't made it to the BSDs
yet, but they will, and the same may be true of the 2.5 stuff
(preemptible kernel, low latency, etc).

Linux kernels don't tend to be very stable at 0-4pl. Admittedly, I've
only used the 2 series, but ... *shrug*. Makes RedHat's .0 instability
less unforgiveable.

Amusing story: a bad disk showed up the other day with important
documents on it. Linux refused to read it, MacOSX refused to read it,
WinXP and 2k both refused to read it, and then all of a sudden Win98
read it like a charm, saved the files off of it, and then went about its
business.

I like Knoppix for this. =)

I doubt I'd use OpenBSD for that. It seems like the wrong type of nail
for that hammer. But FreeBSD, or doing Linux without initrd should both
be usable. You can read ext2 with just about anything non-Windows, but
if you're using odd filesystems I'd check first. I'm only just gearing
up to move to XFS on Linux from EXT3, and I haven't checked out what
filesystems the BSDs support.

Subject: [PLUG] samba and profiles...
Message-ID: <20030424081203.4228.qmail@goose.robinson-west.com>

Does anyone know with samba 2.2.0 on up how to get profiles to go in a 
subdirectory as opposed to the root of a user's home directory?

What is the purpose of the latter profiles?  Can they be restricted from 
creating a bunch of links to programs that don't exist if you log in on
different Windows boxes as the same user via samba?

One of my idea has been to network boot dos and via msclient or lanman
for installation of dos/Windows systems as well as backup.  Seems a
lot of cards aren't supported though.  There's the netware option, perhaps
one of the few options that will let me do what I want.  Ultimately though, 
a network bootable Linux system that gets a machine on the network 
with the ability to mount the local drives and dump them to a network 
tape server is the answer.  The latter will especially work well if this 
network booted system is password protected where these passwords
are synchronized with clients' Linux account passwords on the server.

One gotcha I'm running up against is getting an de220pt on an io address
of 0x2A0 to detect by etherboot.  The latter only detects cards on io 0x300.
There is a kernel option parameter via dhcp but the etherboot program 
itself needs to know that the card is elsewhere.

Knoppix seems awfully large to tag with mknbi-linux and I think for making
netbootable Linux systems that your choices are limited to initrd or NFS
systems.  I've heard of putting the Linux kernel into bios or perhaps putting 
etherboot into bios but I don't know how to do this safely let alone
whether or not there is enough room in there.  I don't know how to get the 
boot process to use etherboot shoved into the extra area in the flash bios
chip let alone avoid blowing away dos/windows support in the process
of getting etherboot into there.
  
Has anyone created a netbootable image of Knoppix?  What usually goes
on the cdrom would have to be on an nfs share or in a ram disk and I
imagine that there is probably too much there to fit into ram.  I have a 
network bootable of Tom's Root Boot but it doesn't seem to support samba
shares and I don't enough know if it will allow to mount nfs shares to dump
backups to.  Not to mention, Tom's has a really weird tar command.

If I could install etherboot to bios it would save me having to get a 
netbootable nic or build a card to put etherboot on.  It would be nice if
a could pick up a pci card to put a program like etherboot on.  A lot of
cards have what are know as flash bioses where I think this is the
same thing.

2 things:
append="console=ttyS0 console=9600,8,n" should be somewhere your
syslinux.cfg file.  I put mine in the global area when running serial
consoles.  The ttyS0 could be ttyS1 is using com2.

Does your bios support serial redirection so that you can see the BIOS
boot messages?

I believe the serial console is already working properly.  At first
I was booting my kernel without passing any arguments, and it was failing
to print anything.  Once I passed 'serial' to the kernel, I started 
getting all the messages.  My problem seems to be somewhere around the
place where /sbin/init does a fork-exec of /bin/runinstall.  Unfortunately
I can't find the source code for the yellowdog 7.3 installer.

My 'BIOS' is little more than a tftp loader, and is strictly serial.  There
is no video card in the system.

My stonehenge.com runs mail, news, and the GNU Emacs editor in which
I'm typing this message, all on an OpenBSD box (in Texas :).  Again, I
want to sleep at night.  I want to be able to go away for a week, and
not come back to find my box had been rooted by an exploit made public
the night before.  I want to go 4-6 months between rebooting, and not
rebuilding my kernel every weekend to patch the latest hole.

Another approach would be to use your NIC's PXE (Preboot eXecution
Environment), if it has such, or netboot see the HOWTO at

http://cui.unige.ch/info/pc/remote-boot/howto.html

I know the title says it's for Linux remote booting, but there's info on
dos/windows booting and backup options there, too.

I haven't made any comparisons, but I'm using a Cisco Aironet 340 card
under Debian without problems. Pretty fun to run Kismet and find all

I'll second or third the DSL-Only recommendation, as long as you are
fine with pretty bare-bones service. My ISP bill from them is 17.99
a month, with another 29.99 to Qworst for 640/256 transport.

For a more "full featured" experience for a bit more money, Easystreet
seems to have a really good reputation, and their head tech manager
person (I forget his title) seems like a super good guy.

Regardless where you go for DSL, support a local ISP with your business!

I'm impressed with the quality of the discussion on this
subject. It's been remarkably objective except for
Randall's comments about sleeping at night, which could
have provoked a holy war here but didn't.

I like both Linux and xBSD. I can build secure systems
with both. This recent exchange got me thinking though:

Does xBSD have the equivalent of Linux UML?

I find UMLs exceptionally useful and, frequently, that
would dictate my choice.

There is an equivalent. It's called Jail (and upcoming Jail NG). There
is a fairly old article about it here:
http://www.samag.com/documents/s=1151/sam0105d/0105d.htm . Keep in mind

Message-ID: <B17BD2D33A303B41844F115DF0104AC4855DE3@CSCCMAIL.tmhq.centerspan.com>

As far as the first question goes, this is how I do it on my system
(just conf excerpts):

[global]
logon path = \\ROUTER\profile\%U
profile acls = Yes
        
[profile]
path = /usr/local/samba/profile
browseable = No
read only = No
profile acls = yes

I am using 2.2.8a however, and I don't know if the "profile acls"
keyword works in 2.2.0. I think it does, but I'm not sure. Either way,
the login path and the profile share are really what you need. I think
the profile dir under the homedir is mostly for windows9x clients... I
believe that's what they use by default. I don't know of any other
reason for it.

Does anyone know with samba 2.2.0 on up how to get profiles to go in a 
subdirectory as opposed to the root of a user's home directory?

What is the purpose of the latter profiles?  Can they be restricted from

creating a bunch of links to programs that don't exist if you log in on
different Windows boxes as the same user via samba?

This is great information. Thanks.

I see that Jail allows an independent process tree to be
established, thus providing the insulation needed if I
were running daemons that I don't trust, but it appears
that the Jail does not provide an independent file system
for the independent process tree. Is my understanding
correct?

I hope I am not too out of bounds for asking this or that it's
a long beaten dead horse . . .

I am finding myself having to get a cellular phone (after surviving
10 years without one) because I am going into business for myself.

After some cursory research, it seems to me that the three biggies
are Qwest, Sprint, and AT&T?

I guess all of them suck in their own ways. My question, which one
sucks the least? Which has best reliability or coverage?

I have heard so many negative things about Qwest that I am almost
ready to ignore that one and look at the others.

I am hoping to get something that is digital (which does provide
a little more security by obscurity) and that would allow me to
use a modem (for credit card terminal use).

Thanks

  I've been a very satisfied customer of Air Touch, now Verizon, since 1996.
Their service has been outstanding and I have no desire to change. Currently
my plan gives me 300 (or 350) minutes per month, no roaming charges anywhere
in the 12 Western states and toll-free long distance anywhere in the US from
anywhere in my "home" area (the 12 Western states). For this I pay $35/month
(plus taxes). My fiancee's plan ($20/month) gives her 75 minutes of local
calling in the non-expanded home area and no long distance.

  My latest phone with them (I think it's the third one I've had) is a
Kyocera QCP-6035. This is a tri-mode phone with a built-in Palm Pilot PDA.
Or, it's a Palm Pilot PDA with a built-in cellular phone. You may be able to
get one for a very good price as the replacement model will be out next
week. It has color (whoopie-doo!) and cosmetic changes.

  What made the expense ($350 net for me about 16 months ago) worth while is
convenience. I carry only one belt decoration rather than two separate ones
and I have all 900+ phone numbers (that's 900 addresses with multiple phone
numbers for each one) and several years' appointments, etc. with me.
Exceptionally handy for the self-employed.

  Verizon Wireless has been very good for me. I call them periodically and
if they have an upgrade in service for the same price they'll move me to
that new plan. I've never had a problem with them or their coverage. There
are spots around Vale and in the Cascades (as well as more remote areas)
where there's no cellular coverage. Period. By anyone. That's where I use
the satellite phone.

Subject: [PLUG] Printing via CUPS on a networked host
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0304241710070.5620-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I'm completely puzzled by this. Cannot print across the network from the
"client" workstation. Not from the command line nor from any application.

  /home is nfs-mounted on this box and exported from the server where the
laser printer is physically attached. Attempting to print a file with the
command:

	$ lpr -Plaser5_non_ps <filename>
results in an error message about a missing symbol in /lib/libssl.so.2.

  I presume that because the xterm is displaying an exported/nfs-mounted
directory, it's CUPS on the other machine being invoked. Am I correct?

  But, OO.o, sylpheed and mozilla are installed locally on that host. Cannot
print from them using the CUPS client. I seem to be stymied by what's going
on here. Should I see a cups or cupsd process in the process list of the
client host, even when no print job has been requested?

  A pointer to help me figure out what's going on here would be greatly
appreciated. FWIW, printing used to work just fine from this box.

TIA,

Rich

Interesting information though it looks more complicated than I want
to deal with if I try and set remote boot Windows up for Windows users
to be able to backup their own systems.  I don't want to dabble in the
Windows registry without professional training and the less software
I have to pick up from some obscure site the better off I am.  I have
etherboot working and I have made Tom's root boot netbootable
using etherboot.  Same is true for a dos and 98 boot disk where I
have added a few tools I'd put on a bootdisk intended for creating
partitions to install these operating systems to.
  
What I want to know is how to take a no package group selected custom
install of Redhat 7.2 and fix it for network boot.  This means that things 
like hard drive testing and temp directories created during bootup as well
as the kernel need to be looked at.  The home directory should be an area
on a backup dump disk on the server whereas the temp directories should
either be ram disks on the client machine or a file on the server side.  This
system should have no mail anything, has anyone ever taken the mail
facilities out of Linux entirely?  Linux runs most everything hardware wise
where the time I could spend on PXE would be far better spent learning
about Linux.  I have a partition on my workstation to develop this custom
system on.  The only reason for 7.2 is that it has the 2.4 series kernel
and recent hardware device support though any modern Linux distribution 
where programmability is the key could be chosen.  Redhat 6.2 could be
good enough, though 7.2 is easier to install with extras left out and is
newer.

I've lost interest in netbooting Windows and Dos.  PXE seems necessary
to be able to support the network cards out there, but looking at it it 
becomes obvious why Linux is so much better for networking applications as 
Linux is not designed with rigid assumptions about a local hard disk, etc.
and the kernel itself is largely used to get the various hardware devices
going  It looks a lot easier to prepare Linux for netbooting than Dos/Windows
where dos/windows don't look easy enough to be worthwhile and 
getting a usable Linux system available via netboot is more useful to 
me.

A netbooted Linux system with samba client support, tar, bzip2, 
dd, dump, restore, broad filesystem support, and md5 summing 
for example is a good start.  I can and have created netbootable 
images of 98 and dos for formatting and creating local partitions 
( though I need password protection through a third party program
perhaps run by autoexec.bat or a pre booted Linux system that
has to authenticate you to the server before allowing network boot
of 98 and Dos systems. )  If I could come up with a Linux system
that just has the ability to authenticate users to a server and trigger
a second network boot I would not worry about passwords after
that in dos, windows, or further Linux network booted systems.

If I can avoid getting away from etherboot that is preferred because
that makes the client side so easy.

I get the above all the time, the rest left off.  It looks like someone is 
trying to email to a non existent account on my domain and I'm receiving it
where it can't be bounced to the address they specify.  I'd like to not 
receive it in the first place though I imagine the sender can send it from 
many different hosts which I may not want to block, especially
since the source can be forged or it could be valid for other senders.  I use 
qmail server.  There has to be some way to block emailing to accounts that 
I don't host or at least a way to have messages to non existent accounts 
turned around and sent back to the sender or destroyed.  I don't want to 
get messages like the above in my admin account anymore if I know the 
message is junk.  I haven't removed any valid accounts let alone one 
named sonya.h and noone who has a right to receive messages on my

Not sure on the swat front, but you don't need to go to 3.x versions. 
You should be fine if you install 2.2.8a which address the various 
exploits.  I think most of the distros have the updates available.

Howdy.

A really good friend of mine (not computer literate) just bought a new
eMachine (2.3GHz, DVD, etc) and attached it to a cable modem. It came
with WinXP on it; and she prefers Netscape over IE/OE.

I went to the gpg sight, and downloaded the win binary, and also got
gpgrelay, which is supposed to handle gpg encoding for programs which
don't understand it. Altho netscape will open signed docs, I'd like it
to open encrypted docs, so that we can exchange truly private email.

Anyhow, I tried to set it up, and altho the gpg binary runs as
expected from a command line setup, it doesn't seem to do the
automatic stuff, and she won't run extra steps; so I'm hoping someone
out there has some experience with this and can point me in a useful
direction.

More coverage of our plight on slashdot:

http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/04/23/2143227

Technically, Oregon is not Washington. Daniel Phillips is among the many folks 
who have been following the progress of a bill in Oregon (HB 2892) to encourage 
open source software, and he points out this Register story (picked up from 
NewsForge, actually), writing "Apparently, moving Oregon's open source bill 
forward comes down to convincing the house speaker."

Reader PotatoHead fleshes that out just a bit: " Despite reports detailing the 
demise of HB 2982, this bill continues to be a topic at the Oregon Legislature. 
We have broad support for HB 2892, but need everyone to continue showing support

  I want to replace my old floppyfw box with one containing a hard drive and
running OpenBSD. I suppose that I could take out the existing motherboard
and CPU (the latter is, I think, a 200MHz Pentium) with a mixed bag of SIMMS
I had in my parts box (64M RAM in all). The 2M vRAM video board is also
adequate for a box that sits headless until time for a reboot. The only
thing I _don't_ like about this is that I need to plug in both keyboard and
monitor to reboot it (a BIOS thing).

  Using these parts also leaves me naked while the new box is built and
tested. I'm not comfortable about that.

  What would be a reasonable minimum hardware setup (specifically, what size
hard drive) for a firewall box running OpenBSD for a SOHO network?

Thanks,

Rich

Rich,

I'm running OpenBSD 3.3 (beta) on a SPARC, so the overall distribution
size might be mildly different from what it'd be on an x86 box. My
installation is pretty bare; it occupies just under 500M:

  /      27M
  /tmp    2K
  /usr  460M
  /var   12M

I have /home mounted via NFS (yeah, yeah, I know...), but I don't do 
that much stuff on the BSD box that would require a lot of home 
directory space.

Unless you're planning on doing a lot of work on the firewall box 
itself, any hard drive bigger than 1G will probably do you just fine.

  Thanks very much, Paul. The only thing I intend to run on that box is the
firewall rules. I just ordered a copy of the book on building firewalls with
OpenBSD. That's all that'll go on there. When I replace my current
server/workstation I'll put the guts of that in a smaller box and make it
into a server for dns, smtp and, perhaps, ftp and http. _If_ I want to fuzt with
security on the latter two.

I don't have any past experience with OpenBSD, but I understand that 
the packet-filtering stuff has undergone some fairly significant 
changes of late. If the book doesn't specifically deal with the 
version of OpenBSD you install, you'll definitely want to double check 
the pf.conf(5) man page before implementing any ruleset suggested in 
the book.

  Yes, sir! :-)

  The book is listed on the OpenBSD Web site as a good resource. But, many
tech books are obsolete by the time they're published. The only thing I know
for sure is that the rule system is supposed to be much easier to understand
deeply than are netfilter and iptables. Shrug. As long as I can get it to
work properly ....

  Right now, however, I have to figure out why, when I connect my
Slackware-9.0 notebook to the network I can ping the other hosts but cannot
mount an exported filesystem, scp from it, sftp from it or anything else.
Hmmm-m-m. Back to the TCP/IP Administration book.

  Besides, I hafta' get back to income-producing work.

Thanks,

  To follow up on my response to your response to my response to this
message, the book describes the installation of 2.5 and explains the
principals and practices of setting up a firewall. While a new copy sells
for $45 I found a used copy for $15 (with shipping). Since 3.3 will be
released next Thursday, I thought that would be an appropriate price.

  Do you have any spare SPARC hardware -- low end -- sitting around? I'd be
just as happy to build a firewall from that. I cannot imagine that sniffing
at packets and shuffling them among three NICs after examining a set of
rules is too compute intensive and would become I/O or CPU bound.

My understanding is that 3.3 is substantially different from 2.5, 
though other PLUG folks with better BSD chops might be able to provide 
a fuller discussion of the issue.

You can always get it for free off the Net. The entire 3.3 base
distribution is only ca. 150M. IMO, the only reason to pay for a copy
would be to support the development effort.

> Do you have any spare SPARC hardware -- low end -- sitting around?

Not at home. There used to be a pile of Classics at work, but they've 
all been claimed. The only low-end hardware I've got sitting around is 
x86 stuff and a cranky Alpha.

  According to a lot of industry pundits I've read, WS03 is already pretty
much finished. Linux is taking its place.

Interesting: the "front door" for IIS 6.0 is a kernel driver:

  The new kernel mode driver, HTTP.SYS, is a single point of contact 
  for all incoming (server-side) HTTP requests. This provides high 
  performance connectivity for HTTP server applications. The driver 
  sits atop TCP/IP and receives all connection requests from the
  IP/port combinations it is configured to listen on. HTTP.SYS is also
  responsible for overall connection management, bandwidth throttling,
  and Web server logging.

I can see where there could be some big performance benefits, ala the
Linux khttpd, but I'm just not the sort of admin that likes to think
that crashing the web server can mean bringing down the kernel.

I don't know enough about the Windows kernel's privilege levels to 
know if that's really dangerous, but it certainly sounds scary to me.

Actually, MS has released the "final" build to manufacturing already. In my

Hey, this may be a safety feature.  If the kernel is down, then they
probably can't exploit holes in the server to spread viruses :)

OK, I have heard this from a few of my friends and would like to know where
this is documented.  I recently replaced my battery in my A21p which held up
for about 3 years.  It was holding 3 hours new then slipped to 2.5 then to 1
and finally 3 minutes before I replaced it.  

I always use my laptop with the battery plugged in at my docking station and
then yank it out when I want to roam around my house (wireless).  I though
that nickel metal hydride batteries were not prone to over charging?

I don't think it's an issue of overcharging - the charging circuitry
should prevent that anyway.  I believe that the issue Nickel metal hydride
batteries is what's referred to as 'memory' which means that if you don't
fully discharge them they begin to lose their ability to hold a charge.

However, don't most laptops now have Lithium ion batteries?  I don't think
that Lithium ion batteries have a memory problem.

With a properly designed charger, it shouldn't be a problem.  Of course,
there's no way for a consumer to know whether any given laptop has a
'properly' designed charger.

Thinkpad batteries are Li-ion and have a micro built-in that does the
chargeing, they do not overcharge (unless you have a buggy bios).  They
do like all battries have a limited number of charge-discharge cycles. 
It is my understanding that it is best to let them stay topped off.

AOL gets a whole lot of spam.  I know they block mail that originate from 
home smtp servers, such as with DSL or Cable hookups.  It sounds like this 
is the next step from trying to reduce spam.

Steve,

Do you know if there is anyway to remove yourself from getting blocked?

On AOL's site they don't give any recourse for dynamic ip users, it simply says
AOL "will not accept connections from systems that use dynamically assigned IP
addresses."

You'll probably need to define what in sendmail-ese is called a 'smart 
host,' which would typically be your ISP's mail server. All your 
Internet-bound mail gets relayed though the smart host.

It's a pain, because you're at your ISP's mercy when it comes to speed 
of delivery, but at least the spam-fearin' folks at AOL won't balk at 
your mail. Oh, it's also a pain if you're on a laptop and connected to 
a remote network, because your normal smart host won't relay mail for 
you.

cs.com          smtp:smtp.comcast.net

Of course, if you're not a Comcast customer, you'll want to change the smtp server. Don't forget to restart Sendmail for the change to take affect.

Have a nice weekend,

Just read an article in Linux Journal (May 2003) "Kernel Mode Linux" which 
allows a patched kernel, to run user space programs in kernel space.  He 
doesn't say what you can't do, but says he's benchmarked Apache.

Sounds safer, almost to good to be true.

Does Lithium Ion avoid the problems of being overly charged or discharged?
Many who believe in the memory myth think Lithium Ion batteries don't have
this problem though they are more expensive.  I guess they hold a greater
charge per cell than Nickel Metal Hydride.

The others beat me to it ... you can set postfix, sendmail or whatever smtp

That seems like the only way that I see it for now.

lot of help.  The shop I'm referring to uses dial up connection and pc 
anywhere over the satellite so that what is on one directory at one place can 
be manually mirrored at the other.  Since the satellite is broken for ftp 
connections via Windoze, the modem has to transfer the data.  Course
my brother's debian system he's setting up one of the laser machines with
ftp's through the satellite just fine.  Debian seems really reasonable, I'll
have to give it a try myself sometime and see if I want to switch from Redhat.

Does anyone use a satellite connection with a Linux router?

I have 'seen' a few DSL contracts before I started to work here and of 
those one guaranteed 10 CPS the others hand none.  Always on and sharing 
it with backbone connection with 2000 others will tend to cut your 
bandwidth right down.  Qwest tends to over sell their circuits (as an 
ISP).  When we resell Qwest DSL (we're the ISP) we don't guarantee the 
speed ... we can't!  Just today we bounced at least 10 Qwest DSL lines 
(take them out of the router and put them back in).
   Whereas with New Edge I can only remember bouncing 1 or 2 of them and 
that was after a serious electrical storm.

Interesting.  You know DSL is very distance limited because of the
frequencies it operates at and doesn't amplify.  Most DSL providers get
antsy at around 17,000 feet and if memory serves me right 1.5M is 3,000
feet.  To get your 1.1M it may take two lines.

I have my qmail server though the only way I can send mail through it now is 
to network boot myself up as an X terminal.  If I want a Linux workstation to 
be able to send mail out I need a relay?  Is the idea that mail server A sends
to B which relays to C?  Do you merely have the to and from in the headers
of your message being sent out or does some kind of header rewriting happen
or how does this work?  Do multiple addresses get inserted into a header as
it passes through relays which would represent the intermediate destinations?
Should I think envelopes like tcp/ip where perhaps headers and the message
are encapsulated inside another set of headers, etc.?

Actually, according to the "documentation", NiMH batteries are NOT
supposed to have memory either. NiCads on the other hand, have memory,
and will lose life if you don't fully discharge them between charges.

Lion batteries also are reported to NOT have a memory. 

Of course, I'm reading this from battery manufacture website, so YMMV.

Not really.  You have to have an external protection circuit to prevent
overcharge or overdischarge, as well as overvoltage (which causes Dell
laptops to get toasty) or undervoltage.

Theo de Raadt had a "falling out" with the author of IPFilter, which was 
completely independent of OpenBSD, regarding making modifications to the 
source code.  As I recall, the OpenBSD folks insisted on modifying the code 
in the course of their characteristic security audits and other development 
activities whereas the author of IPFilter wanted complete control over any 
modifications.  A flame war ensued, the end result of which was the removal 
of IPFilter from OpenBSD and the creation of a completely new firewalling 
package written for OpenBSD by the OpenBSD developers.  I believe that this 
occurred during the transition between 2.8 and 2.9 in the middle of 2001.  
So, you might expect substantial differences between the firewalling code in 
2.5 and 3.3, although I believe that the OpenBSD folks at least initially 
maintained compatibility with IPFilter to ease the transition for their 
users.

I built firewalls using OpenBSD 2.8 and 2.9 but haven't done so more recently.  
So I can't tell you how large the differences are without trolling through 
some documentation.

Food for enquiring minds. ;-)  Enjoy,

Mark

Message-ID: <20030426001544.8843.qmail@goose.robinson-west.com>

I have a partition on my server with the files of my old anonymous ftp 
server, not any wu-ftpd program fragments left over.  I want to export these 
using proftpd though I am confused as to how the config file is targeted at a 
certain directory let alone what user and group should be selected for
proftpd.  Am I missing a comprehensive reference on how to configure 
proftpd available through the www.proftpd.org site?  All I have found there
is a sample configuration that isn't entirely explained.

One thing I need to figure out is what accounts to generate for this server 
and whether or not they should be login accounts etc. I also need to 
determine what user and group ownership plus permissions should 
be placed on the files I want to make available via anonymous ftp.

I'm fairly confused about the install locations also.  Does this program 
work with any state, sysconfig, and prefix settings or do I need to use
specific settings for Redhat 7.2?  Installing outside the normal paths
makes backup and isolating the specific files for this program easier.

Actually this site: http://www.batteryuniversity.com/parttwo-33.htm
seems to indicate that there is something similar to the mythical 'memory'
problem with both NiCd and NiMH.

Here are some excerpts:

"The word 'memory' was originally derived from 'cyclic memory'; meaning
that a Nickel-cadmium battery could remember how much energy was drawn on
preceding discharges. On a longer than scheduled discharge, the voltage
would rapidly drop and the battery would lose power. Improvements in
battery technology have virtually eliminated this phenomenon.

The problem with Nickel-cadmium is not so much the cyclic memory but the
effects of crystalline formation. The active cadmium material is present
in finely divided crystals. In a good cell, these crystals remain small,
obtaining maximum surface area. With memory, the crystals grow and conceal
the active material from the electrolyte. In advanced stages, the sharp
edges of the crystals penetrate the separator, causing high self-discharge
or electrical short.

When introduced in the early 1990s, Nickel-metal-hydride was promoted as
being memory-free. Today, we know that this chemistry is also affected but
to a lesser degree than Nickel-cadmium. The nickel plate, a metal that is
shared by both chemistries, is partly to blame. While Nickel-metal-hydride
has only the nickel plate to worry about, Nickel-cadmium also includes the
memory-prone cadmium plate. This is a non-scientific explanation why
Nickel-cadmium is affected more than Nickel-metal-hydride.

...
Crystalline formation is most pronounced if a nickel-based battery is left
in the charger for days, or if repeatedly recharged without a periodic
full discharge. Since most applications do not use all energy before
recharge, a periodic discharge to 1 volt per cell (known as exercise) is
essential to prevent memory.

 ...

Simple Guidelines
* Do not leave a nickel-based battery in a charger for more than a few
days, even on trickle charge.
 * Exercise Nickel-cadmium every 1 to 2 months and Nickel-metal-hydride
every 3 months. Running the battery down in the equipment may do this
also.
 * Do not discharge the battery before each recharge. This puts undue
stress on the battery.
 * Avoid getting the battery too hot during charge. The temperature should
only rise for a short moment at full charge, then cool off. "


So the recommendation seems to be somewhat similar to the
old recommendations for avoiding the 'memory' problem with NiCd cells (but
apparently for different reasons than the old 'memory' theory.)

Did you perform an upgrade of RH 9 over 8?  If so, how did it go?  I've

and reinstall.

No, I finally did a clean install of RH9 as I couldn't get RedHat's
installer to leave certain partitions the way I wanted.RH 9 works fine
other than getting grub to boot the Win 98 drive.

What files did you backup?  I'm not sure how to backup my Evolution

Ed, where's your memory?  You wouldn't have Windows.  You'd have NetWare.

Yes you can... in Postfix I added the following.. and I think I need to

If I want to run proftpd as a non root user what sort of accounts do I need 
for this, do they need shell access, should they be system accounts?

The special ftp user for anonymous access doesn't need shell access?

I want to make sure that this ftp server only supports downloads from an 
anonymous archive rooted at /chroot/ftp/pub.  There should be no writing
of any sort allowed and user logins should be denied.  I have found that user 
logins do work, ughh.  Do I need the proftpd accounts?  What do I need to
do to my firewall or ftp file under xinetd.d to make this service available 
on my outside interface?

This is a lot easier to set up than wu-ftpd, thanks guys :-)

The ftp user should probably have /chroot/ftp as the home directory, and
it _needs_ to have /bin/false or /dev/null as the shell.

Change the shell, see above.

Yes, but the shell shouldn't function.

The firewall needs to be set up to forward the appropriate ports.

Well, kidding aside, NetWare's significant performance edge
was achieved with numerous other techniques besides kernel
mode. Directory caching and (especially) hashing played a big
part when there were large numbers of files in directories
and/or the entire file system. In the early days of NetWare
and PC architecture, elevator seeking algorithms played a big
part as well though this eroded as disk seek times improved
and drives became so large that translation mode was needed,
which, of course, made elevator seeking difficult to do.

The NetWare kernel was always being profiled and
time-critical portions of code were tuned - often with
assembler. The NetWare file system, like those used with
Unix/Linux, didn't lose significant performance from
fragmentation.

NetWare with processes running in user space would still be
a lot faster than Windows.

Well I can set up a anonymous user for ftp setting home directory 
to my ftp archive and using redhat's -r command to suppress 
copying in /etc/skel.  However, trying to set the shell to /bin/false 
doesn't work for some reason.  How do I disable ordinary user 
login so that only anonymous login is available?  Isn't there an 
option like anon only or something?  Maybe the login account 
needs to have a shell.  The documentation says that unlike 
wu-ftpd there is no way for users to execute external 
commands.  Maybe there is a compile time command that
is needed or something in the config file to allow ftp to be a 
false shell account.  I'm fairly stumped right now.  It surprises
me that I haven't seen instructions in the documentation on 
how to set up users for this program.  I think the program itself
chroots the user but how is this possible without setting up
an environment with the proper libraries, etc?!?!?

Like I said before, try using /dev/null as the login shell, instead of
/bin/false.  I ran into the same problem.

Also, does this affect people who actually have MX records that resolve to

I use DynDNS so my MX is always pointing to my server regardless of its

If you want to spend a little more up front and save yourself a good
deal of time, you might try one of my SnapGear LITE boxes:

http://nakedape.cc/products/hardware/snapgear

It's got a fairly-easy-to-use web interface running an embedded Linux
2.4 kernel.  Tiny fans, a box just slightly larger than an 8-port hub or
switch.  You can spend your time later figuring out how to set up a VPN
between it and your laptop for when you're travelling...

Thanks for the help on this, I've been pretty busy to get back to it.

The error came because I had not correctly configured the script.It needd 
configuring internally, and I didn't catch that the first few times through the 
sparse docs.

I've abandoned the form_processor script because it would not allow multiple 
domains. I'm playing with formail now, it allows each form to tell the server 
which server it belongs to in the form itself.

Thanks again all.

Yes, the last one was a WinXP question. Surely some of you out there
have learned how to deal with non-linux questions in your immediate
universe, as a part of dealing with folks of reasonable importance to
yourselves. But if that was the only question that didn't get
answered, I wouldn't made this statement. At the very least, someone
could have pointed me somewhere that I could get a solution to my
questions.

I really try to do good homework before posting questions. There are
just a whole lot of times when said homework gets no useful results.

Is it possible for this bill to be explained in simple concrete terms? What are
issues this bill will resolve and how it will do it? I'm interested in the
mechanics of the bill as I seem to have completely misunderstood it. I haven't
seem any post on how in practice this bill will work. 

I believe the school district is a government body, and there are some on the
list involved in schools; how would this bill effect your use of opensource? 

My issue with this is that I want to support a bill that will work. My
understanding of that this bill now, suggests it doesn't do anything.  

Thank you
Russell

Subject: [PLUG] Installing Windows 95 on a slave drive
Message-ID: <20030428202958.95530.qmail@web14203.mail.yahoo.com>

I have installed a Mobile Dock by inClose as a slave drive
(hdb1).  I also have two trays that fit into the Mobile
Dock with which I can switch the hard drive that is
inserted into the Mobile Dock.  In one of the trays I have
the hard drive I use to backup my master drive, so it has
an ext3 filesystem.  In the other tray I have the hard
drive on which I want to install Windows95.  I have been
trying to follow the instructions in the Debian GNU/Linux
Bible by Steve Hunger, the User's Guide by Progeny Linux
Systems, Inc. (sections 13.3.2 and 13.3.4) , the
Linux+Win9x+Grub HOWTO, and the man pages for update-grub,
mount and umount. Before I made changes my /etc/fstab file
included the following lines:
/dev/fd0          /floppy     auto           user,noauto   
     0     0
/dev/cdrom     /cdrom      iso9660     ro,user,noauto     0
    0

Then I added:
/dev/hdb1       /slave       auto           defaults       
       0     2

I also edited the /boot/grub/menu.lst file to include the
following stanzas:
title Windows 95
             map (hd0,0) (hd1,0)
             map (hd1,0) (hd0,0)
             root (hd1,0)
             makeactive
             chainloader +1

title Windows Boot Disk
             chainloader (cdrom)+1

title DOS Boot Disk
             map (hd0,0) (hd1,0)
             map (hd1,0) (hd0,0)
             chainloader (fd0)+1
Then I entered the update-grub command.  I included the
Windows Boot Disk stanza because the HOWTO states "If your
Windows install CD is bootable, you'll need to have a
'Windows boot disk' section which chainloads to whatever
your CDROM device is called.  There wasn't any example for
that stanza so I guessed how it should be written.  I don't
know if the CD on which I have Windows95 is bootable. 
Neither do I know if my CDROM drive is bootable.  I took
the drive from the computer I had been using for Windows95
and put it into the Mobile Dock, hoping that I would be
able to just select Windows 95 from the grub menu and start
Windows 95.  That didn't work.  Figuring that I might have
to reinstall Windows 95 I put the drive back into the old
computer to check if there was anything I really needed to
backup.  On startup I got a message that there was no boot
sector on the hard drive.  I guessed that Linux had
replaced the first sector and decided it was too late to
try to backup anything on the drive.  Then I put the drive
back into the Mobile Dock and used cfdisk to create just
one partition.  I did this partly because in the old
computer I had installed Western Digital's EZ Drive (due to
the limitations of the old bios) when I switched from a
500MB drive to a 3 GB drive.  I thought the EZ Drive
software might cause problems so I wanted to get rid of it.
 Another bit of history that might be relavant is that I
had installed a CDROM drive on the old computer.  I think
doing that made changes to my config.sys file.  Anyway, I
was able to boot Windows, and log onto the Internet, but I
couldn't read my documents, so I figured I had destroyed
the data with cfdisk. A lot of other stuff was missing so I
reinstalled Windows 95. Then I started getting the
message"The following file is missing or corrupted:
C:\MTM\MTMCDAI.SYS and "There is an error in your
config.sys file on line 6", followed by the lines:
C:|>rem----------------MTM ATAPI CD-ROM-------------
C:\>rem   by Windows setup - C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND\MSCDEX.EXE 
/D:MTMIDE01 /M:10
C:\>rem----------------MTM ATAPI CD-ROM-------------
I figured this was related to having installed the Mitsumi
CD-ROM drive on the old computer.   I had hoped that I
would be able to read my documents again if I installed my
Office 97 software again, but I started having problems
when I tried that.  Later I discovered that the Office 97
CD looked damaged, but I don't think that was the only
problem.  The main problem was that the computer would
freeze after a few minutes if I tried to install from a CD.
 I thought the solution might be to reinstall DOS 6.2,
because that had been necessary a few years ago when I
reformated the hard drive on the old comuter and
reinstalled Windows 95.  I was able to reinstall DOS 6.2
and Windows 3.1 from floppy disks, but I couldn't get
access to the CD-ROM drive.  I removed the lines in my
config.sys file that I think had been added when I
installed the Mitsumi drive in the old computer (the two
rem--------MTM ATAPI CD-ROM lines and the line that was
between them, but left the [COMMON] line that was between
them).  Now I can change from the A drive to the C drive
and look at the files and directories on those drives, but
I can't change to the D drive.  If I try to read my Windows
95 CD while in Debian it doesn't work.  I appologize for
such a lengthy post.  I'm not sure what information is
relevant.  I'm not even sure of the sequence of all the
steps or all of the details.  If you can help it will be
appreciated very much.  Thanks for at least reading this
far.

Gave it a shot, no dice.  I don't know not setting a password for ftp
if logging in as ftp works.  One possibility I'm looking at is chrooting 
the home directory of the ftp user to the anonymous archive I'm setting 
up by setting it to,"/path-to-archive/ . /pub."  On top of that I'd set the
permissions of everything in the archive so that the ftp user can only
read the files there.  If there are no login scripts and you can't write or 
append to your home directory or anywhere else, what damage can 
you do?  Maybe the latter is what you're supposed to do for proftpd.
I don't know what happens if I want to place suid scripts in the archive
for people to download.

I'm guessing that your Windows registry has links to software and/or DLL's
that aren't linking or aren't installed.  Did you reinstall 95 from scratch?
Is 95 on an extended partition or a primary?  Each primary partition changes
your drive lettering but extended partitions don't.  The other tool that might
be needed is xosl, see www.xosl.org.  This tool is important because it can
hide partitions for you and allow booting off an extended partition also.

95 has the unfortunate shortcoming of thinking it needs to be the first 
system on the first partition of the first hard drive.  I believe xosl can
fix this issue though ;-)

If your data is only on your hard disk then your probably toast.  Hint though,
fdisk doesn't destroy the data when it erases the partition table.  If you 
haven't put a different partition on the drive and proceeded to install
to it or even format, you can recreate the deleted partition and all
your data will be there.  It would not be unlikely that you would need a
boot disk to install dos back to your MBR with though.  

The confusing hard drive lettering is one of the reasons
why it's a good idea to use DVD-R, CD-R(w), or tapes for backup.  The other
option to play with is creating a server that is filled with raided together 
hard disks for the sole purpose of storing backups.  The latter generally has
a short shelf life and probably costs a lot, however, there's no media 
swapping and backups are fast.  The advantage of a server here is avoiding
weirdness on your desktop box.

My brother who was a 95 tech recommends service pack 3 or higher.
Whether your running Linux or Windows it's a good idea to get a true
ATAPI cdrom.  Hopefully, hardware manufacturers and OEM's will
realize the need for quality standards compliant equipment soon.
I've noticed that some of the newer cdroms have stronger lasers
or something.  I guess it's important not to scratch the printed side
although the non printed side has a plastic layer over the media and
can be polished if a cd won't read.  In old cdroms the lasers wear
out.

Hope this helps some.

A lot of people have said something about Windows dropping DLL's
too, don't know what this is about but it may be connected to the I
need to be the on the first drive... problem.

Hm, looks like the Plug meeting will cover this in sufficient detail. If not, 
perhaps we can talk about it over a beer afterwards.

Here is one possible path that may work. Others
may have easier ways to solve your problem.

Make sure the system boots to linux.

Look in your boot logs in /var/log (or use dmesg) and 
make sure that the kernel is finding all of the hard
drives you have mentioned when it boots.

Take all of the drives out of the system except the one
you want to install Win95 on. Make it the only disk
on the primary ide connector.

Install Win95.

Make sure it boots. (Ok, forget this, win95 will
make sure it boots many! times during installation :)

Take the Win95 drive out, put your linux disk back in 
it's place and put your Win95 disk back where you 
want it.

Now make sure it boots to linux again and find out
where the Win95 disk is /hdb? /hdc? /hdd?

Then edit your grub.conf accordingly and boot 
to Win95.

Ken,

    I'm a bit frustrated at the moment.

    Several organizations like the AEA have been claiming to represent
thousands of companies who oppose this bill; whereas in fact only a few
of the members (if they actually exist) strongly oppose this bill and
some of the members may even support this bill.  As a result, I have
tryed to throw PLUG's support behind the bill.  True, this is a bit
strange.  PLUG doesn't generally take political stands, and PLUG hasn't
taken a vote to see where members (who ever that is) stand; but this
is an issue of interest to the Open Source community and there seems
to be general support on the mailing lists and in my discussions with
PLUG members for this bill.

    In any case, I attended the hearing on the bill a month ago, but
didn't get to testify because there wasn't time for all of us supporters.
I did send in written testimony, but I don't even know if it got into
the record - let alone if anyone actually read it.  I have also
written to a number of legislators and written to a couple papers
including the Oregonian.  I certainly haven't gotten much response.
In fact, the only response I have gotten has been nice response from
Melissa White in Rep. Kelly Wirth's office.  Altho Rep. Wirth has a
very different political philosophy than mine, she seems like a
very good legislator and I will probably vote for her in the future.
(I guess I've also talked with Andy Giegerich of the Portland
Tribute a couple times recently.)  But, other than this ...  NOTHING!!

    I guess I'm frustrated.  I don't think our legislators understand
this bill.  They don't understand how much money this bill could save
the state.  They don't understand that Oregon has a growing Open Source
industry which could benefit from this bill.


                                          Sincerely,

  Not silly, Paul, but yes. Root should not be allowed to ssh, but I tried
anyway.

  I don't know. One of the reasons for writing was to get beyond my limited
expertise and learn where else to look. :-)

  Hold on, I'll go wake up root from his late afternoon nap .... Well, he
was grumpy but this is what he said:

[root at salmo /home/rshepard]# /usr/sbin/lsof -i :22
COMMAND PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME

Many thanks -- more later on /etc/ssh/ssh_config

Rep. Mabrey,
It is my understanding that this bill is being held up by, literally, ONE
lobbyist who seems to "own" Karen Minnis:  Jim Craven of the American
Electronics Association.  AEA claims to have thousands of member companies
but their work on this bill is for the exclusive benefit of only
one of those members.

What can I/we do about resolving this problem with the democratic process?

Could I suggest that the whole proprosed bill be put up on the plug web site.

It may be better to take this to an initiative since that is the best way to 
show broad voter support and it avoids having either party in the legislature
taking credit.  Right now, especially with Kulongoski's slam of Mannix at the 
end of the governors race where the margin of error was easily within
the margin of victory, I'd say there is going to be trouble with the 
political climate in Salem.  As far as lobbyists coming out against the bill, 
the only way to compete is to build not only a base of support but a base 
of support educated about the bill.  The best way to educate people about
the bill is to put the text of it up where all can see it.  My other 
suggestion is to look for industry proponents of this bill since it is going 
up against an industry opponent.  Noone right now wants to be seen as
hard on industry at a time when many who could invest in Oregon are
reluctant to do so and our economy is the weakest in the nation.  

Explain how support of open source by companies is good for those
companies in the long run.  It's interesting that government supported
the developement of Unix to ahieve a standard system for heterogeneous
environments in order to reduce training costs and increase productivity,
yet today there is a real question as to whether or not the option to maintain
an open standard for those latter mentioned reasons is indeed a viable one
anymore.  Why companies develop products that interoperate and how 
open source helps with this is what the legislature needs to
understand.  There also needs to be an argument that collaboration through
open source doesn't hurt companies the state depends on.  This can't win if 
it is simply a proprosal to save money when corporations come out and say 
that those savings are coming out of them.  At this time, the state 
desperately needs many corporations to remain here even if it means not 
giving open source a fair shake in the minds of many legislators.

Is open source a political issue?  If it is presented that way I doubt any 
bill will get through.

  I recently purchased an Orinoco Gold PCMCIA card for my RH 9.0 based laptop.  The card, hotplug, and Red Hat's network config tool all work flawlessly.  Hotplug even recognizes when I switch between PCMCIA Ethernet, WiFi, and modem.  It simply "does the right thing" (tm).  I'm very impressed...

  I bought the Orinoco Gold card to replace a Linksys card.  The Linksys was giving me trouble.  I was experiencing signal fade problems and software hangs in the kernel modules.  I haven't seen any problems with the Orinoco card.  The Orinoco card also has a jack for an external antenna.  Now, I can purchase a few more RX Db's if I need them.

Unfortunately, the problem with PLUG supporting this legislation -- or
any legislation -- is that it could endanger our standing as a non-profit
organization. IANAL, but as I understand it, non-profit organizations
trade their right to express political opinions in return for exemption
from taxation. That was the problem that Bill Sizemore encountered --
well, that & being a sleezeball.

And to say that we can get around this because PLUG is not a formal
non-profit, then it renders PLUG about as convincing a body as any
imaginary group -- say, the Left-handed Bilingual Protologists Who
Worship marsha Brady as Their Goddess.

I have put a notice on our website concerning this house bill, but tried
to put it in a very neutral manner so that there is no suggestion of
PLUG expressing a partisan stance about it. Because as sure as the sun
will rise tomorrow, I know someone at Microsoft will learn about it, & use
that fact against us in pursuit of their goal of ``MS Windows everywhere,
& everyone rendering something to Microsoft."

If I'm being too timid about this, I'm willing to listen to persuasion.
I want this bill to pass -- but not at the cost of a greater Microsoft
victory.

I don't see what difference it makes what we call ourselves, we are first 
and foremost a bunch of taxpayers and concerned citizens.

PLUG is not a non-profit organization, whatever opinions are expressed on 
the webpage are guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.  Period.  Whether or 
not all pluggers are for the bill or not is another matter.

I say don't sweat it, put up the info along with pov and advertise the hell

I personally think you are on the right track Geoff. 

Governments are designed to move slow. This is generally a good thing.
Slow moving governments are (theoretically) resistant to the
"public-whim-of-the-day". A short-term-blast of public opinion may
create a sudden, slight shift - but the next "whim" is just as likely
to cause a slight shift in the opposite direction.

If you want long-term, lasting results it requires gentle, constant pressure.

If you guys are in this for the long-haul, take your time and learn who the
players are, what influences them, what their biases are, what their vices
are, where they are strong and where they are weak.

I have had a couple "15 minutes of fame" when dealing with public agencies. 
It took several years worth of gentle, constant pressure for every 15 minutes
of progress. It's the nature of the game. 

Think chess, not hockey.

For those of you who are feeling frustrated by the slow progress, keep
in mind the cover of the Guide: "Don't Panic".

-Eric

Here's a suggestion.  If you want to relate a sense of support for the
bill from PLUG, and as PLUG's informal status precludes taking a
formal position, why not just have a show of hands at the next
meeting, someone can count them and report _that_ when desiring to
testify to something quantitative or qualitative about the sense of
PLUG "members" on the subject.  It isn't PLUG taking a position, it is
simply reporting a fact.

Message-ID: <20030429060754.72709.qmail@web14204.mail.yahoo.com>

The main reason I want to be able to use Windows 95 is for
using the Internet. Some websites, for example job
application websites, have online application forms that
can only be used with Word. Also, I don't have the plugins
installed on my Linux drive that are needed to view some of
the graphics. for example the Java plugins. Also, I want to
continue to learn about Windows because that is important
at my job. My boot sequence was a, c, scsi, so I decided to
try c,cdrom,a. That didn't make any difference, so I tried
adding the lines: map (hd0,0) (hd1,0) and map (hd1,0)
(hd0,0) to the Windows Boot Disk stanza. That didn't make
any difference either. I still got the error 23: Error
while parsing number. I thought maybe "cdrom" was the wrong
name to use in the chainloader line in menu.lst, so I
entered ls -l /dev/cdrom. I was expecting to find a
symbolic link to hdd, but I found a link to /dev/cdrom0,
which linked to /dev/scd0. I entered cat /dev/scd0 and got:
Attached scsi CD-ROM sr0 at scsi0, channel 0, id0, lun0,

cat: /dev/sdc0: no medium found. I don't understand whether
this means "cdrom" is the wrong name in the chainloader
line in menu.lst. I still can't access the cdrom from
either the floppy drive or the slave drive (hdb1). How
should I write the menu.lst so that I can install Windows
95 from my Windows 95 CD onto my slave drive?

Evidently what you need is a tool called xosl.
It has the ability to hide the partitions of all but the operating system 
you want to run so that you have the illusion of working with a 
common environment even though you may in reality be using a 
drive as C: which is the seventh partition on your slave.  I've 
also heard that xosl has the ability to support cdrom booting 
where the idea is to set your bios to boot to C only which will 
bring up xosl.  The site to check out is http://www.xosl.org.  This
tool allows moving Windows 98 to an extended partition for people
who say want to run two 98 systems or 98 and NT or 98 and dos...

Subject: [PLUG] Screwed up Mircosoft networking and samba...
Message-ID: <20030429074259.22977.qmail@goose.robinson-west.com>

Is samba being designed in such a way that it can be compatible 
with Windows without becoming a disgusting piece of code itself?  
If Microsoft doesn't know how to do cross subnet browse list 
collation properly what else is strange?  For moving away from 
Windows completely I wonder if there is a better alternative to 
samba and CIFS world that hopefully is both GPL and non tcp/ip 
based?  I'm admittedly confused by Microsoft's failure to implement 
NBDD and how a domain master broswer is a gross patch.  What 
kind of things is Microsoft trying to add to X.500 and DNS?  Is 
it just me or should Microsoft scrap their own networking and 
use a standard implementation that works?

Security wise is it best to distribute an lmhosts file to all machines 
in a domain group as opposed to implementing wins?  What is
the common approach to the name resolution end of samba?

I sure wish the networking code in Windows could flat out be
replaced.  That would be hard considering that Windows programs
aren't written to a full featured sufficiently flexible API capable of
hooking to any base, lower level protocol, placed under it.  
Imagine Windows 95/98/ME with an open source networking 
code replacement for the standard code Microsoft puts out with
common Windows applications working on top of this replacement.

Netware would probably be a good choice though I don't think there's 
any free program like SAMBA for a netware style network.  It sure would
be cool if an open netware project would start up.

  I get winWord docs -- particularly as .dot templates -- from agencies and
use them in OpenOffice.org. Works just fine.

  Don't know about java-script as I keep that turned off in both browsers I
use (mozilla and opera). Java itself -- of which java-script is not a part
-- runs very well on linux. The reason I run two browsers is that mozilla is
locked down and opera is a bit more open -- and reports itself as IE-5.0 for
those sites that want to be fussy.

  I did have an interesting Web experience a couple of days ago. I wanted to
read an investigative report written by Tom Knudson and published in the
Sacramento Bee. The company had set this up with "Macromedia Flash" which is
not available for linux. So, I could not read the article in either mozilla
or opera. However, lynx worked just fine. No, I couldn't view the pictures
or listen to the sounds (I don't have a sound card or speakers in any case),
but I got the information. There's almost always a way with the abundant
linux tools and choices.

In the interest of smooth communication between linux and other OS, I'm
going to try to answer this.  NetBIOS is not a "connection type" like
TCP/IP or IPX, it is a communication protocol, more like ftp, or http. 
The difference is that M$ uses this proprietary protocol in a way that
hides it from the user.  Without NetBIOS, winblows boxes can't share
drives and printers or access Samba servers (this can be a good thing,
btw), however, the winblows box will still be able to access web pages
and other TCP/IP services.  You're firewall box won't care if NetBIOS is
enabled, or not; though some firewalls don't block the broadcasts that
NetBIOS does during WINS elections.  

Steve Gibson at grc.com has a lot more information.

HTH,

Yes.

It was on a primary partition, but since then I've formated
the slave drive.  Now I have DOS 6.2 and Windows 3.1 on the
slave drive.

I gave up on trying to preserve my data.  Now I'm just
trying to get my Microsoft software reinstalled on the
slave drive so I can start over.

That wouldn't allow me to have a drive for Windows would
it?

The cdrom in the old computer is a Mitsumi.  I think it is
an  ATAPI. The one in the Linux computer is a Toshiba.  I
don't know if it is an ATAPI or not, but due to my
financial situation I will stick with what I've got for
now.

If you are thinking about my comment that my Office 97 CD
looks damaged then polishing won't help.  The non-printed
side looks corroded, like frost on glass.  I tried to wipe
it off, but it seems to be under the surface.

I'm a little confused about grub.conf.  I typed info grub
and got nothing.  I looked in /boot/grub and found
menu.lst, so I've been editing that file and entering
update-grub.  Update-grub is in my info.  I'm not sure I
even need to enter update-grub after I've edited menu.lst.

Can anyone recommend a good sound editor for Linux? I set up a SuSe 8.1
box for a friend who does part time work recording lectures at various
churches. After recording them, he has to edit them to clean them up and
sometimes to compress them to fit on a CD so that the church can
distribute them.

Currently he has to reboot MSWindows to do this but would prefer to stay
in Linux. The features he needs include good quality configurable speach
compression, the ability to remove misc pops, click, background noise,
etc. while still keeping the over all quality of the lecture. Also to be
able to adjust the level and tonal quality of questions from the audience
so that the person who listens to the CD can understand them. His work
usually is better than most of the commercial services the churches have
tried.

Any suggestions for software like this in Linux? I haven't found anything
on the SuSe disk set. I haven't had time to explor the internet yet.

I can vouch for audacity.  Get the latest build from the sourceforge site 
since what comes with your distro may be older and missing some recent good 
features.

You can now auto-scroll in realtime while recording.  There are no level 
meters, though.  If the recordings will be made while someone is present to 
bump up the recording level during the Q&A, that can be done on the fly. 
Might want to use a hardware-based automixer if recordings are un-maned.

Audacity will export to wav, mp3 and ogg.  The later two required external 
libraries.

Cheers,
Kyle Accardi

Message-ID: <20030429204650.GB4308@sthelens.dimstar.net>

What do people use the print pictures?

I have an HP inkjet color printer. While I was using windows, I used
Paint Shop Pro to print my pictures. 

Now I'm using Linux, and I find that just about everything I use (The
GIMP, XV, EE, several others) prints washed out and at a very large dot
pitch. 

The images I'm printing at 1600x1200, which should be plenty for
printing to a 8 1/2x11 sheet of paper. I've proved it by installing
Paint Shop Pro in my VMware windows machine, and they print fine there. 

So, what do you use that works?

  I don't have a good answer, Russ. I've noticed that with both the GIMP and
OO.o the colors appear much lighter than when printed with my legacy GIS in
the virtual win98 "machine". I also bought Easy Software's PrintPro
specifically to get a solid driver for my HP DeskJet 2500C. The resolution
is fine here, but the colors are washed out.

  Perhaps we can both learn something useful here.

dunno on redhat, but there's bound to be an equivalent, because flash is

Everyonce in a while xine will freakout on a file, displaying it in
random psychodelic colors and all pixelated. Once that happens I've
had to reboot (restarting X dosen't fix it, nor does killing
everything, logging everyone out.. I don't even thing going to
runlevel 1 then back to 2 did it) to get _any_ video playback to work,
then mplayer will play it with no problem.

Rep. Minnis,

I just received the enclosed forwarded email from Mr. Kveton. I too
wonder exactly what Mr. Craven meant by, "...[we are trying to] ensure
that there is funding to open and keep opn [sic] the new Kelly
Engineering Center on your campus."

As there seems to be no clear connection between the Kelly Engineering
Center at Oregon State University and HB 2892, it is at least plausible
to take Mr. Craven's remark as a threat.

Do you, Representative Minnis, support Mr. Craven's efforts with respect
to HB 2892?

The Flash tarball for Linux from the Macromedia web site works fine on my 
Mandrake boxes too.  I've used it under 7.2 and 8.2.

I create a directory under home called profiles and create a directory for

Maybe the earlier suggestion is for NT or something.

I'm able to select media size, media type, and resolution; as well as
scale the image, and adjust the image settings -- including a button for
adjusting the color.  I think I just doubled the saturation (from 1 to
2) and it made a huge difference.

The highest resolution available is 600x600 DPI.  This does glossy
prints that look pretty good.

Thanks Jeff, my kids have been bugging me about some cartoon network

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0304291931530.3136-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  To continue from last evening, I went through /usr/local/etc/sshd_config
and /usr/local/etc/ssh_config on the "host" (the workstation to which I want
to connect via ssh from my notebook). I also went through
/usr/local/etc/ssh_config on the notebook.

  Then I ran 'ssh-keygen' on both, creating the DSA key pairs on the
notebook and re-creating them on the workstation. I tried to use scp to copy
the public key from the notebook to the workstation, but nothing happens
until I use ^c to get the shell prompt back.

  Next I tried 'ssh -vvv salmo' from the notebook and saw that it was trying
to connect to my external IP address's port 22. Aha! Thar lies the problem.

  When I'm out of the office I want to dial into my shell account at my ISP
then ssh into my network. But, when I'm here in the office with the notebook
connected to the ethernet lan, I want to use the internal IP addresses.

  Where are these addresses stored, and do I need to change them manually
depending on location?

TIA,

Are you not using dhcp at home?  Either way, how about creating a small 
script (or X launcher) for both kinds of connections?

from_road.sh
#!/bin/sh
# I'm on the road
/usr/bin/ssh -f me at myisp.com xterm


from_home.sh
#!/bin/sh
#I'm home
/usr/bin/ssh -f mylan xterm

In the "connecting from" machine, look in ~/.ssh/known_hosts.  You'll
see:

  connecting-to-hostname,ip ssh-rsa AAAHURKINGKEY...

Just duplicate the line and edit the ip for the duplicate (ie have one
for the external address and one for the internal address), and I
think it'll work for you.

The mplayer documentation is really pretty good (once you find
it.. IMO, it's been intentionally hidden.;) ).


This section talks about getting the gui:

  To follow up on my own post, this morning I tried 'ssh -vvv 192.168.55.1',
specifying the internal IP address rather than the host name. It worked
after I responded that this host is OK despite not having a listing in the
~/.ssh/known_hosts file. Now, of course, it does.

  So, is there a place where I could assign the host name to both the
internal and external IP addresses and select the one to use depending on
where I am?

Thanks,

  Thanks, Russell. I tried this but without success. I made two copies of
the key, on one I changed the IP address to the external IP address and on
the other I changed it to the hostname (not the FQDN). No go.

  In /etc/hosts.allow the last set of directives are:

sshd: .spiritone.com
sshd: .appl-ecosys.com

  Could the order be why ssh looks for the external IP address? I obviously
don't fully understand just how ssh is attempting to contact the host.

This is describing a name resolution problem, not an ssh problem.  You
need to find out how the name is being resolved to an address.  Is there
an entry in /etc/hosts?  Or is there a DNS server somewhere that is
doing the resolving.  The easiest fix I can think of is to have two
names listed in hosts, one for internal access, one for external access;

servername external.ip.address
servername2 internal.ip.address

Then when your outside the office, you would "ssh servername" and when
you are inside the office, you would "ssh servername2".

If you need to use the same name to access the server, then you will
need two hosts files, which will then need to be rotated into /etc/
depending on if your in the office or out.

Good Luck

Message-ID: <4058.216.99.218.67.1051716642.squirrel@sautez.com>

Hello all. Hope all is going well.

I was asked to offer smtp services to some of my users. Currently I don't
allow any smtp only pop and IMAP.  Mostly because I didn't want to rely or
setup any mail sending server agent.

As I'm trying to now add this I have heard of a few options.  One is pop
first then allow from that IP smtp services for some amount of time.  I
also think there is authenicated smtp.

Can someone point me in a direction to look for a way to configure my box
to somehow authenicate users then allow them to send email via my server?

Thanks for the help.  I hope you all enjoyed the lightening storm last
night.  I did.

Josh

  I suspect that this won't work. When I use the local IP addresses I can
get into the two workstations, when I try their names ssh resolves them to
the external IP address. Perhaps it's using the DNS server at my ISP.

  What puzzles me about this situation is that I regularly ssh between the
two workstations, addressing each by host name, 'salmo' and 'caddis'. Since
we're all on the same lan here, I don't understand why I cannot do the same
from 'lemna'.

  Could this have anything to do with where sshd is running -- or not
running?

Thanks,

POP-before-SMTP is a huge kludge. Just say no.

Authenticated SMTP is the way to go. I know sendmail and postfix both 
support it; I don't know about exim or qmail.

It all depends on what mail server you're running: sendmail? postfix? 
Let us know, then our advice will be more useful.

Josh,

  Postfix supports pop-before-smtp. There have been several threads on this
on the postfix-users mail list. I've not read any of the messages, but the
postfix Web site probably has details. Or the mail list archives.

  This MTA is very easy to set up and it is a drop-in replacement for
sendmail.

qmail supports Authenticated SMTP and on Gentoo it's suported out of the box, though I think it's out of the box everywhere (not sure, can't find any patches that would be aplied to it though on Gentoo).

Qmail does support auth-smtp but only with a patch. If you want something to 
do everything, IMAP, POP, and SMTP with auth-smtp support, mysql support and 
lots of other stuff built in check out:

I set this up on my server at work and love it.

In general, yes... However, a good friend of mine runs jails that he
creates virtual filesystems for... He makes an image of a fresh jail,
starts it up, configures it how he wants, runs it normally, and
periodically saves it back to the image file. He also runs read-only
images so that when he shuts down the jail, it goes back to the original
configuration. It's really flexible.

This is great information. Thanks.

I see that Jail allows an independent process tree to be
established, thus providing the insulation needed if I
were running daemons that I don't trust, but it appears
that the Jail does not provide an independent file system
for the independent process tree. Is my understanding
correct?

If you check out "Life with qmail-ldap" there is a listing of patches at the
bottom, and it also talks about how to install them (just in case).  One of
the patches is auth-smtp, a pop before smtp patch is there also, and the
like is here: http://www.lifewithqmail.com/ldap/#SMTP%20AUTH

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0304301100420.8744-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  What tool(s) are available to me that identify blocked characters in an
ASCII text file?

  For example, I printed a Web page then ran the .ps file through pstotext.
When I look at the resulting .txt file with the pager, less, I see "<AD>"
highlighted where a '-' should be. The same file in the editor, joe, shows a
white-blocked '-' at the same character locations.

  I'd like to do a global search-and-replace for these in the file (and I
get other characters in other files, too) but I don't know how to specify
them.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Actually, that's apples and oranges. DHCP will assign an IP. /etc/hosts
is for looking up other hosts.

Sounds to me like a combination of errors in /etc/resolv.conf and
/etc/nsswitch.conf. 

I'd compare those files on the working box with the same files on the
non-working box.

In vim, you'd copy the character into a buffer, then go into command history
editing so that you could paste the buffer onto the command line.

I'm guessing that in emacs you can do something similar, and don't know
enough about joe to say one way or the other.

In less, <AD> probably means hexadecimal character AD.  If your editor
supports 8 bit characters, just figure out how to type it in and there
you go.

Colin

p.s. You could also build a perl/sed/awk/python/shell script that does
the transliteration for you. That way, as you learn about new characters
that you don't like, you can just extend your filter to fix them, too.

Russ,

  Oh. I thought the /etc/hosts file assigned an IP address to each host on
the system.

  /etc/resolv.conf is the same because I copied it from the RH workstation
to the slack notebook. I just tweaked the workstation's /etc/nsswitch.conf
to match that of the notebook. Same results when trying to 'ssh salmo'.

  If typing the entire quad-dot address wasn't so inefficient (and required
only when working on the notebook) I'd just shrug it off and live with it.
But, the inconsistency begs for a solution.

Thanks,

  In emacs they just show up as regular hyphens! No indication that they are
different from ones I type in.

galen,

  Reading the man page I almost understand the syntax; I read that x is
supposed to have a [SIZE] specified and -A should have something, too.
Regardless, if I run this, does it facilitate my changing of the hex chars
to decimal chars? That's the end point I'd like to reach.

Thanks,

Rich

I don't run postfix myself, so I'm just shooting from the heip when I 
say that it looks as if these docs have the gory details for Postfix 
1.1.x:

* http://postfix.state-of-mind.de/patrick.koetter/smtpauth/

It looks as if things have changed in 2.x, but you'll need an

If you run ping salmo on both the laptop and this machine, what are the
results?

What's actually in /etc/hosts, and what is the "hosts" line in
/etc/nsswitch.conf?

So, if memory serves, the results you are getting is it resolves to the

Josh,

  That's where the postfix-users mail list comes in handy. Wietse _always_
has helpful -- sometimes quite sarchastic -- comments, but he's keeping on
top of things.

  Bingo, Russ. I wonder where I got the syntax with the comma. Certainly
does make a difference! Now it works from lemna.

Thanks for the lesson!

  Next question: the dsa authentication fails and the session falls back to
my password. Is this because I don't have the *_pub file from lemna appended
to the one on salmo? I think I didn't do that because I didn't have
communications between the two.

And perhaps I will need to go over and subscribe to it if things start to
become a bit hairy.  so far I have had little need with my postfix server.
 It has run quite well for a long time.  Multi domains and multi users are
easy to add maintain.  I have enjoyed it over sendmail.

No, not directly.  It's just a way to confirm the value of the bytes in
a file without getting tripped up by fonts and such.  Don't worry about 
-A.  That's just the offset within the file.  I'm content with the default
size when printing the offset.  I specify a size of one for the data
in order to avoid big/little endian issues.

If you need to
change all occurrences of a character to a different value, you could use
od to confirm the value of the character, then tr to make the change.
If you tell od to output octal, it will make using tr easier.  Change
the -t argument from x1z to o1z.  When using tr, don't forget to use
quotes around the arguments to prevent the shell from messing things up.

Subject: [PLUG] Retrieve P4 sSpec programmatically?
Message-ID: <20030430162826.S21119@kudzuforest.com>

Here's one for the group.  I bought a P4 2.26GHz a couple weeks
ago, and not paying attention, slapped the thermal compound and
heatsink on top of it without reading all the cool numbers on the
top.  Now, I would like to know which sSpec I have so that I can
be aware of core errata and things like that.

In Linux (2.4.20), it properly identifies the CPU as follows:

processor       : 0
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
cpu family      : 15
model           : 2
model name      : Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.26GHz
stepping        : 4
cpu MHz         : 2265.641
cache size      : 512 KB

Is there any way to go from this info (family 15, model 2, stepping 4) to
something like the Intel sSpec or core stepping that Intel uses on their
website?  Or is there another program that will read and decode the 
CPUID info?

Thanks,
Brendan

Here's a .fetchmailrc recipe:
	poll myserver with proto IMAP
	    user 'myuser' there with password 'password' is 'mylocaluser' here
	    folder blurfle

Also, there's a Tk program called "fetchmailconf" for writing .fetchmailrc.

Yeah, okay, I've been looking at that page for several days. :)  If you filter
out only the 2.26GHz speeds, there are 7 sSpec# listings.  Some are boxed CPUs
or boxed/oem.  My CPU is an OEM, so that limits it to 4.  But I've looked at all
four, and I can't make the connection between the core stepping (B0 or C1) to
what Linux reports (4).

Can anyone narrow it down a little more for me?  Is there a way to know (or
determine) the exact sSpec programatically?

it kinda depends on where you were in the install process. Sometimes
it's a pain in the ass, unfortunately. The best suggestion I can give
you (other than aptitude, which someone else suggested), is

dpkg --configure -a

which can sometimes solve your problems for you.

apt-get -f install

also can fix stuff. But it may just demand you upgrade glib. I had this
problem the other day when debian unstable updated libstdc++ and it
broke EVERYTHING (it was astonishing just how much stuff was broken, and
how apt-get refused to remove mozilla-mailnews because it said it was
too broken to remove, please reinstall, but reinstall just broke).

Eventually, I have to admit, I had to force a remove and then reinstall
the stuff I needed from stable. Here's how you can force a remove:

dpkg --force-all --remove <pkg>

BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THAT. --force-all is VERY dangerous. It's better to
try it without the --force-all and see what errors there are, and see if
you can come up with another way around it before going with
--force-all.

It's really useful, I discovered, to have stable, testing, and unstable
in your sources.list and then have the following line in apt.conf:

APT::Get::Default-Release "testing";

(or whatever your default release is)

Because then, if you want to install something from stable, or unstable,
you just do this:

apt-get install package/unstable		or
apt-get install package/stable

dpkg is your friend. dpkg-reconfigure is really your friend. =)

Is anyone here a fan of the Lars Larson show?

Is it true that he doesn't particularly like Karen Minnis?  Is it
true that he pillories Republicans when they raise taxes, or fail
to reduce spending?

I've never listened to his show (before today), so I'm not
familiar with his format.  But from what I've heard about him, it
seems that he would be interested in discussing how a Republican
leader (Karen Minnis) killed a bill that would save Oregon's
taxpayers millions of dollars every year.

Does anyone here know him?  Would anyone here be able to get him
to talk about this bill on his show?

Thanks,

Ken Barber
