I got them from Tigerdirect out of Florida.

As far as why did I ask on a Linux list, because I'm only concerned with
whether or not they will work on a Linux based machine.  As far
as your google is always the answer attitude, Google has a lot of cruft
where external sata cages were very hard to find in the first place.
Most places want to sell you USB2 external drive enclosures.  I also
went on vacation, so I didn't have all the time in the world to Google
this question where I'm sure I am not the only one who would appreciate
having an answer.

The product looking at the box really doesn't have an identifying name.
The product is merely identified as, 
(3.5" SATA to e-SATA HDD ENCLOSURE), which is about as useful as saying
it is an external hard drive cage.

These enclosures have an on/off switch, so I'm wondering if hot swapping
is at all possible under Linux?

As far as pushing Google, Google is one company and frankly a defacto
Monopoly when it comes to which search engine people tell you you 
should use to figure things out.  Never mind that there is increasingly
controversy surrounding Google, consider Google books for instance.
I don't particularly like Microsoft and I'm not into Bing, but Google
needs to be taken down a notch or two and competed with aggressively.
Google should not be considered synonymous with Linux, especially now
that Google wants to come out with Chrome, their own OS.

Issues aside - I have purchased enclosures that stated a 500GB limit
and have successfully used larger drives in them, albeit they were USB
enclosures. I surmise it might be an issue with power draw perhaps so
they are just playing a game of CYA?

Message-ID: <1277974487.9602.61.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

How often does someone say, use Google to get the answer for your Linux
question?  The suggestion isn't to use Yahoo, Dogpile, Bing, drop in
some other obscure search engine.  The suggestion is to use Google as 
if Google has become the defacto standard for answering Linux questions.

The whole point of Linux mailing lists is that community is built up and
perhaps just perhaps, the question related to the question being asked
might get answered.  By asking about serial ATA enclosures on a Linux
list I am asking beyond my question if external SATA is worth pursuing
on a Linux based system.

A search engine has a hard time answering a question behind a question
unless there is a valuable programmed in expectation.  Search engines
are not intelligent and they never will be.  Expectations can be
statistically helpful, but they do not always lead to presenting what
the researcher wants/needs.  A human being with creativity has a much
better chance than a computer of making a useful presentation to
someone.  A thing to be aware of is that Google has advertisers who pay
money which puts pressure on Google to produce hits for those
advertisers even if that is nonsensical.  

Google does not equal Linux.  Linux is a phenomenon outside of Google
that predates Google and one which will hopefully outlast it.

Google may not stay free.

Google's chrome will likely be pushed by Google instead of Linux.

Google's book plans, are the freedoms associated with paper back books
that are taken for granted going to be lost in the e-book world?

I've used Google a lot to do Linux research and I must say that Google
is not always a good tool.  Sometimes you get bogged down with old
information and junk.  A lot of the HOWTOs haven't been updated for
recent changes and in general this kind of documentation seems to be
lapsing.  Use Google or use my wiki seems to be the mantra, but there
are problems with that.  First off, search engines have trouble getting
the right information in front of you at times whereas wikis can be
destroyed by malicious people injecting erroneous information or
removing correct information.

Search engines are impersonal and have limited utility.  They cannot
give you a sense of community whereas being on a mailing list where
there are other real people on the list can.

"Google" has become an adjective, thus why it is used.

I do agree with your point though.

Michael -

At various times I know I have told you to Google it or used
lmgtfy.com and at no time have I tried to be rude about it. I'm not
going to take sides and get into a flame war.

That said, in my own personal experience with using Linux and we're
talking 11 years now, when I needed to know something I was always
told to research it, of course research has been turned into Google in
this day and age. People at the time when I started out gave me a very
important piece of information. That is, they were more than willing
to help you if you were willing to help yourself. I'm not saying that
you don't. I'm not making value judgements. Just stating my own
experience.

I don't know how to Google the particular problem of, is this particular
eSATA enclosure truly limited to supporting 500GB drives?  The name of
the product on the box is not identifying.  I am looking for a needle in
a haystack here.

My point here is NOT to start a flame war.  I think Google dependency
should be discussed BEFORE it becomes a problem.  I want to see static
Linux documentation improve.  Wiki's are fine as long as you can check
out a non compromised version of what's on the Wiki.  The attitude it is
on Google needs to be put aside when people want local documentation in
electronic form of high quality.  People can run their own servers where
they can serve the documentation locally.  The documentation, the fine
manuals, should be locally accessible even if they are in electronic
form.

I guess I'm going to have to figure out how to ask this TigerDirect
outfit my question.

Three points...
 1) Google is not synonymous with Linux searches, it is synonymous with ALL
searches.  I believe it has even made it into the dictionary as the verb
"googleit"

2) The question you are asking is not Linux related AT ALL which, I am sure
is why you were asked why you were posting your question to a linux forum.

3) If you want a reasonable answer, ask a reasonable question.  Include
model number, manufacturer, etc.  You say that there is no manufacturer
listed, so at least include Tigerdirect's part number so we can see what you
are talking about.  It is near impossible to answer you're question when we
don't know the hardware you are referring to.  I searched Tiger direct's
site for "(3.5" SATA to e-SATA HDD ENCLOSURE)" and had about 8 hits, all of
which had manufacturer names listed.

My point is, give us details and be polite, and you will find people are
much more likely to help.

I told you what one to buy, and I told you I had a couple with 2TB 
drives in them. *shrugs*

Or just put the drives in them and see what happens. It's not like 
they're going to blow up. TigerDirect is just going to echo what's on 
the box.

I think Google has become the defacto standard  because hands-down they've
the best search algorithm right now. Also, Google has a "Linux" specific
search, www.google.com/linux. I went there and did a search on "Paris
Hilton" thinking there wouldn't be any results. Boy was I wrong and I was
surprised to learn that she release her own Linux distro called
"Tinkerbell"

Sure, I think that's the whole point about mailing lists is that they
consist of well informed, helpful, experienced, and often times very

Sure, a search engine is not itself intelligent. However, hopefully search
engine algorithms are written by intelligent people. If the "semantic" web
ever becomes a reality, search engines might be more adept at understanding
what info us humans are truly looking for.

I've toyed around w. a semantic desktop search app for Linux called Nepomuk.
It's definitely an  huge and intense undertaking, but it works and it's
pretty neat...

The impossibility of creating an artificially intelligent computer
capable of fooling anybody communicating with it over the web or
via telephone that it is a person is at the heart of what it means
to be human.  Even to simulate an ant's intelligence takes a 
ridiculous amount of electrical and processing power.  The prize
for creating a computer system that the majority will mistake for
a human being has never been claimed and probably never will be
claimed.

Further on search engine dependency, imagine that you are standardized
on the 2.6.32 kernel and that you run the latest version, 13, of Fedora.
You update without creating your own local archive of the updates.
Fedora 16 comes out, you have data tied up in Fedora 13.  Linus has
moved on to the 3.0.0 kernel.  Fedora 16 is substantially different 
from Fedora 13.  What will google help you research?  Is Google going 
to be as helpful to people trying to support Fedora 13 compared to
people wanting to migrate to Fedora 16?  What if for whatever reason 
you can't migrate?  Maybe you have Pentium 4 era systems where Fedora 
16 requires as a bare minimum a quad core computer.

Google, invariably, is going to change for searches on Fedora when 13
reaches end of life and the 2.6 kernel reaches end of life.  Most people
probably want information on the newest kernel and the newest releases
of Linux.  For those who need to support yesterday's Linux for who knows
how long, is satisfying both groups with the same search engine really
practical?  If the HOWTO's fall behind, and they do, there is a lot of
inaccurate dated information.  Try to use the NFS HOWTO's these days.
The use of mknbi-linux and mkelf-linux is pretty much dated.  Took me
a long time to figure out that a pxelinux boot can only handle 
untagged kernels.  Fedora is considered a bleeding edge Linux distro,
but even old releases of CentOS can be in use past EOL.  I have CentOS
4.x servers even though CentOS 5.x is the currently supported system.

Sadly, Google doesn't seem to be able to narrow search results based on
the specific version of a Linux distribution that you want to search on.
Perhaps Google is running into problems like, is he/she searching
for Fedora 13 because he/she thinks that is the current release or does
this person really want information pertaining to that dated release?

Don't be so sure of that.

IMO, the answer to your product question comes from the spec sheet for
the product in question. That should be available from the manufacturer.
I assume that is not Tiger Direct.

If the name of the product on the box is truly "not identifying," then
you may be out of luck. There is more than one kind of eSATA enclosure
on the market. 

If you're looking for the experiences of other Linux users with eSATA
enclosures, they may not apply to the enclosure that you're thinking
about purchasing from TigerDirect. So any experiences that you get from
us or from other online searches may not apply to that product. 

So to answer your question, you really do need the spec sheet from the
manufacturer, assuming that can be identified. Perhaps TigerDirect can
help you with the name of the manufacturer.

If a spec sheet is not available from the manufacturer's Website, I'd
think you'd want contact info  for the manufacturer. 

Then you'll need to make your own judgment on whether to trust that
information. If the spec sheet / other manufacturer info confirms "only"
500GB, then bigger drives are at your own risk.

The credibility of Google as a company is not relevant to that question.
But FWIW, as a Linux person, I'd trust Google (who uses Linux) over the
major alternatives: Bing and Yahoo (now affiliated with Microsoft
searches).

If you have to go through this much trouble to find information for the
specs of one product, it may not be worth it. But that is based on your
judgment on the value of your time.

Thanks,
Mike

Subject: [PLUG] Munin, comcast, bits, bytes oh bother.....
Message-ID: <4C2E05C1.4090502@gmail.com>

I'm writing a plugin for munin to monitor my monthly bandwidth usage.

Comcast has a "250GB" cap in place, that I've blown through 4 out of the
last 5 months.  June was 346GB according to Comcast.  The second day of
July and I've already used 4% of my cap.

The plugin looks at my outside facing interface, adds upstream and
downstream bytes together and divides by the uptime.  This gives me
bandwidth usage for a daily and a monthly average and let's me look at
see what direction it's trending.

My question.  ifconfig provides bandwidth in bytes and normally I'd just
multiply by 8 and get bits and be done with it.  However Comcast in
their infinite wisdom has decided to display the "bandwidth" usage in
bytes too. So I really want to show "bandwidth" in bytes so I'm looking
at apples.

There is a scaling value in munin if you are looking at memory or
traffic you can stipulate 1000 or 1024 as the multiple.  I'm leaning
towards using the 1024 value to show bytes, but it just seems "wrong".

On every router/switch/dslam/bit/byte shop I've worked at or on it's
always been 1024 but I wouldn't count out Comcast to be *different*

So have it output both.

What's the main cause for your overage? Not that you have to defend it 
to me, but I'm always looking for better answers to give people than 5 
people in the house streaming Netflix all the time. Also, I believe that 
Comcast business has no caps, and doesn't seem to cost much more.

As Hulu and Netflix competition gets heightened with recent 
developements, and other HD VOD choices come available, I find it ironic 
that data caps are also on the rise. With AT&T's laughable new 2GB limit 
on smart phones and the iPad, which boast mobile apps for VOD, it seems 
to slow progress once again.

Message-ID: <20100702185700.GA32493@gate.kl-ic.com>

As others have said, without an identifiable manufacturer you
won't be able to find out history on a particular model.  That
said, there should be /something/ on the unit to identify it.

The various log files and ls<foo> commands and all the zillions
of files in /proc and /sys can tell you which chipset the
enclosure uses.  No, I can't tell you which files or commands,
you will have to spend half an hour researching that yourself,
but Linux squirrels away a lot of configuration information.
Then find another product that uses that chipset, and learn
about it.

For size - just try a large drive (borrow one from a friend)
and see.  There is nothing in the specs of eSata interfaces
that impose an arbitrary constraint at 500GB. 

The limit may actually be power - larger drives consume
slightly more power to keep the heads moving and spindle
turning, all other things being equal.  But all other
things aren't equal, so some big drives consume less
power than some small ones.  

Another limit is their Windoze driver, which may have some
size-related flaw.  Chances are, they pirated it.  The
Linux driver won't have he same size flaws, though it might
be incompatable with some non-standard idiosyncracy of a
particular chipset.  Another limit is interaction with
the motherboard chipset or boot process.  For example,
there are ways to support more than one eSata drive in
an enclosure on a single eSata cable, but only some
motherboards support this.

The "manufacturer" may not know what they are doing, a common
problem with "Happy Family Mixed Vegetable Brand" Chinese 
electronics, manufactured in the kitchen of some Kowloon 
restaurant after the food customers leave.  They may have
made some enclosures from bits and pieces for sale in the
Shim Shui Po electronics street market, tried them with four
or five drives, and the enclosure did not work with a 500GB
drive, for some reason.  They assumed that it was the size
that broke it, rather than the power or data rate or some
other idiosyncracy.  The name brand companies don't know
much more, but at least you can give them bad reviews and
warn others.

All that said, even name-brand equipment made in China often
has manufacturing flaws or gray market components.  The cheap
stuff from no-name shops almost certainly does - indeed, the
name-brand manufacturers may be selling their test failures
this way, making more money while damaging the reputation of
the no-name competition.  I would not trust a no-name
enclosure with any valuable data.  Sometimes cheap equals
garbage, and you take a big risk buying this stuff. 

Spend money, learn from mistakes, check the reviews before
you buy next time.  A great place to buy stuff is Newegg.
Most items they sell have customer reviews, and many of
their customers run Linux.  Before I buy something like a
drive enclosure, I check the Newegg reviews, even if I
(rarely) end up buying it someplace else.

D00d. Every single question you had was answered on the link you just 
posted, which is where you bought it from even. A guy on the first page 
says he put 2tb drives in one and had no trouble. You acted like you did 
have any brand/model information on it and the page you bought it from 
had all that. You get everyone on this wild goose chase helping you, and 
the info was there the whole time.

Respectfully, I can't trust that conflicting reviews answer my question.
Some people say that these don't work at all in the reviews.
I still wonder why the box says up to 500GB drives.  I assume that a
multi terabyte drive will work, but I'll have to test that.

Here is a link to the manufacturer's web site where you can ask them
directly.

http://sabrent.com/#itemID=0&section=Contact&itemName=

It has been my experience that these types of eSATA enclosures are "dumb"
devices.  This means that there are NO active devices in them and they
simply provide a case, SATA to eSATA adapter and power supply.  They should
support any drive that the chipset on your motherboard supports.  This
should also include hot swapping, assuming you are using a recent kernel.

All the information about manufacturer's name, model number, etc are located
in a yellow box at the bottom of the page of the link you provided.

Manufactured by: *Sabrent*
Warranty provided by: *Sabrent*
Limited Warranty: *12 months parts; 12 months labor *
Mfg Part No: *EC-ESTK*
UPC No: *857161001175*
Box Size: ( Length: 8, Width: 10, Depth: 2 )
Shipping Weight: *1.4500 pound(s)


*Hope this helps,
 Jason

If it is happening at POST than modifying your kernel will not help.  I
would recommend checking the grounding on your system (motherboard screws
are tight, proper power cord, etc) and check for any BIOS updates that may
be available.

It seems that you withheld what you already knew about the drive. The
effect was to maximize attention, and waste our time. That, IMO, is
--disrespectful--.

Now that you've provided more complete information, a Google reveals
http://www.amazon.com/Sabrent-EC-ESTK-3-5-inch-Aluminum-Enclosure/dp/B000I6JQGU 

with 4 x 1star reviews (nothing higher), including one that directly
addresses your capacity question. I note that question was also
addressed by at least one of the replies to you. 

The review also questions whether or not it is actually a true eSATA
enclosure.

If you don't trust those reviews, contact the manufacturer. It is your
choice whether or not to trust their answers.

Thanks,
Mike

I didn't withhold information, I just didn't realize the obvious about
how to get it.  I wish I could answer the capacity question without
buying a 2 terabyte drive as I'm a bit cash strapped at the moment.
As far as getting people's attention being rude, if that's the case
then the people who feel that way shouldn't be on a Linux mailing 
list.  I'm not the only person who has asked simple questions on here
and I do not feel that a culture of don't get our attention by asking
any obvious questions is a healthy one.  This culture will discourage
asking any questions whatsoever.

The "obvious about how to get it" is generally known as a "cursory glance". Your initial query provided no information at all. It took you nearly a day to look at either the box they came in or the website you bought it from. It took any of us nearly a minute to look up the information you were so reticent to provide, just to find your answer for you.

Believe it or not, it is extremely rude to request that we look up answers for you while complaining that you have to use a search engine. You're not the first person who has asked for help on this mailing list, and you won't be the last.?Did you notice how you eventually got your answer? This mailing list isn't what needs changing.

Hey folks.  My name's Kyle and I've been running a Linux OS for a few years
but I'm still a newb by all standards.  A few weeks ago I started a Linux
class at PCC and the instructor included an article about posting to Linux
user group mailing lists.  I know that sometimes I have to remind myself to
really try to answer my own questions before I go to my
more knowledgeable friends and ask them to spare their valuable time.  The
good news though is that it has almost always proven to be an invaluable
learning experience.

Hi

It is OK..

You asked a question......

If people didn't like the question.....  They should just delete it..

This list should be to help people..

Both parties should be respectful of the  other..

Peace

Later, you revealed not only the P/N and link from TigerDirect, with
your concerns about the reviews.

i.e., you already knew things that you didn't tell us until days later.
That is withholding information.

In part, I actually understand the concern w/r/t googling (as a verb),
as not all searches are equal. 

If you had told us about your efforts to search for an answer online,
then others would have been able to help more efficiently.

But I count nearly 30 messages on this topic, most of which have been a
waste of time, because you withheld information.

It should not take a couple of dozen messages before you reveal the
information that allows us to help you. People who cry wolf too often
are rightly ignored.

Good link Kyle.  Apropos to the current thread:

   Still, treating experienced users like hackers, in the ways we
   recommend here, will generally be the most effective way to get useful
   answers out of them, too.

   The first thing to understand is that hackers actually like hard
   problems, and good, thought-provoking questions about them. If we
   didn't, we wouldn't be here. If you give us an interesting question
   to chew on, we'll be grateful to you; good questions are a stimulus
   and a gift. Good questions help us develop our understanding, and
   often reveal problems we might not have noticed or thought about
   otherwise. Among hackers, "Good question!" is a strong and sincere
   compliment.

Looks great.

Since our history indicates that keeping the website info current is a
challenge, perhaps it would be prudent to minimize the things that need
regular attention.  Maybe one person to keep one item up-to-date, and an
auto reminder sent to that person at the appropriate frequency.  Is that
practical?

The calendar is a good idea, and I like the calendar in the corner,
even if it's not functional yet. The dates for each event should show
in a different color and be links to that event. In the case of the
Clinic the date can just go to the Clinic page, because there are no
speakers or programs to describe.

Lots of editing needed, but overall the design looks great.

Overall style looks great. I like the calendar idea, too.

Building the site in Wordpress should make it easier for the keeper of 
the site to allow certain other volunteers to work on limited parts of 
the site, too.

If I understand your feedback request correctly, you are looking for 
input on style at this time. When you get to cleaning up content, if you 
want additional editorial comments, please ask. I have noticed a few 
things on the history page that might benefit from tweaking.

Great work. Thanks for all the effort to date and the willingness to 
continue.

this should be pretty easy to convert to a WP template, and i'd be happy 
to do that. i'd also be happy to volunteer for ongoing maintenance. i'll 
explain my take on WP momentarily. as i stay pretty on top of the 
mailing list, with consent of the community, the relevant information 
like meeting dates and topics can be transposed to the site w/ no need 
to change current habits.

since there seems to be a general consensus that a calendar would be 
beneficial, i'll start that next.

Denis: regarding the updating of content, i set this up so far so that 
the changeable things (i.e. meeting info) are contained in a separate 
txt file and included in the home page automagically. for automatic 
notification of the upkeeper, i think the mailing list is probably good 
for that.

regarding WordPress. it is a really nice CMS for getting things set up 
quickly and making maintenance easy for groups that will be 
co-maintaining. if an honest assessment of the likelihood of multiple 
persons volunteering to help maintain and stick with it seems to merit, 
i say go for it, if not, i'd sooner see a static site with the variable 
content separated from page layout and managed by editing a few text files.

wordpress has a habit of slowing down after time, is subject to SQL 
injection (though the WP team does an excellent job of trying to prevent 
this), and is subject to occasional random MySQL corruption...

just some cons to bear in mind along w/ the benefits. thank you all for 
your input, i'll send another update looking for review of the copy 
after i've finished updating the last section and implementing the calendar.

Message-ID: <4494532D-4216-4B06-97FB-4BFBD9E5DF91@berkholtz.net>

I'm looking for inexpensive options to build a DRBD based redundant storage array; two arrays each connected to their own server that uses DRBD to keep data synced.

Anyone have experience with these DNF brand DAS enclosures?
  http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=130405183471

The DNF enclosures look very much like some IDE-based EonStor systems that I installed many years ago. The EonStor systems are still in service, and have proven to be extremely reliable little workhorses. So, assuming that DNF is an OEM of EonStor... I'm looking for SATA based DAS options which can accommodate 12+ of the newer 1-2TB drives. I cant figure out if the DNF brand SATA systems support anything larger than their included 400GB drives, and I've had no luck finding manuals or manufacturer contact info.

I'm also toying with instead using two of these...it may be a better choice, although I was hoping to keep the existing servers in their original chassis:
 http://www.norcotek.com/item_detail.php?categoryid=1&modelno=rpc-3116

For what it's worth, if you're needing very high capacity, but lower-I/O, storage options, this  ~$8,000 67TB system would be a very nifty candidate:

David,

   A few thousand hits on Google with the search term "HP C4795 linux". One,
on a Ubuntu forum, found a solution:

Not sure this is any help ... running Mandriva 2008 with an HP OfficeJet 
7310 All-In-One ... all is well ...
    Printer
    Copier
    Fax (from computer as well)
    Scanner (from computer)
    CF Card reader
... I use HP Device Manager version 10.0 (HP Linux Image Printing, 
version 2.7.7)... pretty cool in all.

The only issue is that the non-printing margins are a little greater 
than expected, but I get around that on an as needed basis, as it 
normally is not a problem.

Message-ID: <20100703201420.7725fe8d@mailhost.pdx.edu>

A recent post alerted me to the existence of Lubuntu, of which I was
heretofore unaware.

I am happy with my Fedora 11 laptop the way it is, but seeing a new
distro makes me curious. I went to the Lubuntu site, but nowhere could
I find how big the ISO is (unless I download it), how much RAM it takes
to run Lubuntu, or why it is a better choice than Xubuntu.

While I am not personally interested, at the Clinic we quite often are
faced with a newbie wanting to install Linux on a computer with limited
resources, e.g., < 256 MB RAM, hard disk with only 4 GB, and so on.
When faced with such a scenario we usually whip out a live CD for
Xubuntu, although occasionally Puppy and DSL have their day. If Lubuntu
is a viable alternative, I'd like to know.

I am hoping some Lubuntu devotees will shine some light in my
direction.

Thanks for that link. That does help a lot.

While the stuff about Lubuntu was certainly interesting, even more
interesting were the comments about Xubuntu. I know there are Xubuntu
users here who use it precisely because of its lighter footprint. But
is it really? According to the above article straight Ubuntu uses less
memory than Xubuntu. Can that be true? In my own experience at the
Clinic I have tried to install Ubuntu on older hardware and it failed,
yet Xubuntu installed and ran fine. I question the veracity of that
article with respect to the comments about Xubuntu.

I also note that the article never mentioned what happens in Ubuntu,
Xubuntu or Lubuntu when the user launches OOo or plays a DVD. Or, God
forbid, tries to write a letter in OOo Writer while watching a DVD and
occasionally surfing with Firefox. Does smoke come out the back of the
computer?

It uses truly lower resource intensive apps such as: Kazehakase browser
Sylpheed-Claws email app.

http://www.fluxbuntu.org/js.html#

The downsides are:

Linux newbies might struggle with using the Fluxbox window manager as it's
not anything like Gnome or KDE desktop.

It looks like the latest stable ver. is 7.x, so they're a bit behind on the
dev curve. Also since it probably has a much smaller user community, getting
help when you need it might be a bit harder...

I'm a big fan of LXDE based operating systems in general. There's a RC
of Linux Mint 9 using LXDE out right now.
(http://www.linuxmint.com/blog/?p=1429) The ISO is 592MB.
(http://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=60)

Haven't tried it yet, waiting for a non-RC release, but it looks promising.

Lubuntu is faster than Xubuntu. I've installed it on an 7 yr old Compaq
desktop with 480 RAM and 1.4 ghz cpu and it's very responsive.
http://lubuntu.net/blog/lubuntu-1004-now-available-download
it's a 521MB live Cd.

Thanks for the work, Nathan. It's a nice, clean look -- albeit quite 
wordpress-y -- that's easy to understand at a glance.

That's a very good discussion to have! A dynamic site (ala wordpress) 
is most appropriate when the content changes frequently and/or there 
are multiple editors. Otherwise, site-maintenance chores -- security 
updates, database cleaning, testing of templates with new updates -- 
disproportionately outweigh data-maintenance chores.

My assessment is that the PLUG web site has historically been largely 
static, with meeting announcements the only content that changes on a 
regular basis. I'm not sure how many folks update the content, but my 
impression is that it's only one or two over any given timeframe.

If that assessment is correct, a static site seems the lower-cost 
solution. Perhaps the site could be committed to a git or svn 
repository. PLUG contributors could do commits, with commit messages 
going to the site maintainer(s) who would review the changes and then 
push them to the live site.

On the other hand, if PLUG members were willing to do things like 
summarize problem-solved threads on the mailing list as articles and 
post them to the site, then a full WP implementation becomes 
worthwhile. My only warning is that few things scream "rot and decay" 
like a blog with no article newer than six months old...

Any favorite tools for extracting/converting a pdf image to another 
image format?

My brother-in-law sent me a pdf that is all image. It has a newspaper 
article from the 1960s. It comes as two separate pdf files which must be 
read alternately, since the the top half of the page was scanned to the 
first pdf and the bottom half to the second. I want to try rearranging 
it into something more readable, but the first trick is to get at the 
images.

There is a useful utility called pdfimages which extracts images from
pdf files. It is part of the Debian package xpdf-utils.

one possibility that's occurred to me while thinking over the feedback, 
is that the landing page and several linked pages whose content won't 
likely change stay static, with either one or several persons dedicated 
to upkeep.

to complement this, dynamic pages like 'articles', 'resources', 'faq', 
'meeting minutes' could be kept in some kind of wiki, which makes upkeep 
broadly accessible, is in the spirit of open-source collaborative work 
and would promote community engagement, as well as lessening the burden 
of upkeep for statically designed pages that are more frequently updated.

my suggestion for something of this sort would be DokuWiki, a solid, 
stable wiki with diff support, that doesn't use MySQL, requiring only a 
webserver supporting PHP. (you're probably noticing a trend in avoiding 
mysql here... this comes from my work experience supporting webhosting 
customers and watching all the joy involved in saving a 
corrupted/compromised database)

if this sounds like a good way to mix static, low-maintenance site 
design with community involvement and contribution, i'm all for it, and 
wide open to discussion on alternative wiki solutions or other proposals...

happy 4th of july all!

Also, try Okular. You can select areas and save them to the clipboard
as images or as text (if the PDF has text, which apparently yours do
not). Once you have the images you can rearrange them with something
like Scribus, then export a new PDF.

I just spent a couple hours taking Lubuntu for a spin via the live CD.
My computer is far from the target for Lubuntu - it has 4 GB of RAM and
a 320 GB hard disk. Still, I wanted to check it out.

The good news is that it does seem to be more responsive than Gnome. (I
have always preferred Gnome.) The bad news is that there seems to be a
problem with daughter windows in some applications. An application pops
up a daughter window, but the window manager fails to give it a title
bar or any way to move it, minimize it, or close it. I was using
whatever window manager comes on the live CD; I did not try installing
any alternative window managers.

While it was running I installed OpenOffice.org 3.2.1, Scribus 1.3.7,
and Inkscape, the Gimp, Firefox, and a few other apps, all from the
repos. All seemed more responsive, in spite of the fact that I was
running from the live CD. 

I tried to copy application configuration files from ~/ on my hard
disk to see if my custom settings for the above applications would
still work, but the file manager faced me with a very confusing scene.
It listed "210 GB partition," which must have been my hard disk. The
weird part is that my hard disk is 320 GB, and all of it is one
partition. Gparted shows it as 288 GB. And when I looked in "210 GB
partition" I found a strange assortment of folders that I had never
heard of before, yet the folders that were supposed to be there
(filesystem folders) were missing. I tried going back to /media, which
showed the partition, but when I looked in the partition I saw the same
thing. From the command line I also got the same thing. It's as though
the live CD mounted the hard drive, and then hid most of the contents,
and made up new things.

Other than the fact that the file manager can't figure out the size of
a partition and lies about what is in it, it appeared to have all the
functionality I get from Nautilus.

My computer currently runs Fedora 11, x86_64 / Gnome, but I have Xfce
installed as insurance. I see that LXDE is in the Fedora 11 repos.
Perhaps I should install it and then take it for a run with all my
installed apps. Who knows, LXDE may convert a long-time Gnome user.

Dick,

   An alternative to what others suggested is to use pdftk to burst the pdf
file into individual pages. You can reassemble it in a new order if you
wish, or use 'convert' to copy them to a different graphic format.

   You can also take the separate pages and run them through jocr (the
optical character recognition software), clean that up, and do whatever you
wish with the resulting text file.

Yes, that is the plan: to cut the image up into smaller pieces and 
rearrange them into something more readable on the screen. I assumed I'd 
use OO Writer, since that's what I'm most familiar with. But a page 
layout tool is probably more appropriate. Thanks for the suggestion.

That sounds like it would be useful for a different kind of pdf file, 
one with multiple pages. Mine are two separate files, each with a single 
image of 1/2 of a newspaper page. However, it's good to know about 
another tool for doing things my way when confronted with a pdf.

I do plan on trying that at some point. I may have to cut the images 
into a dozen or more pieces to make it work, but it might be worth the 
trouble.

Thanks for the ideas.

Russ,

   I called Dell Tech Support and learned that either F2 or F12 works, but
not until the logo screen appears. I'm used to holding down the BIOS access
key while pressing the power switch. This doesn't work that way.

   Now to run fdisk manually since cfdisk won't run ("Bad primary partition 2:
partition ends in the final partial cylinder.") This is not as easy as my
Toshibas or ThinkPad.

Thanks,

Rich

F2 should take you to the BIOS, but F12 should ask you what device to boot from.

I use F12 as this is a 'just for this boot' type thing.

Trouble is, how do I get autounmounting to work?  I have a zip 250

Dear Rich, 

If I remember right, on my Dell e1405, the logo screen was disabled by
default.

> key while pressing the power switch. This doesn't work that way.

The first time I got to the BIOS screen took some trial and error, along
with some repeated clicking of F2. 

(On my Dell, the F2 gets to the BIOS menu, the F12 the boot menu. But I
think F12 works only if it's pressed once at the right time. If I
remember right, when it's pressed twice, it toggles back out of the boot
menu.)

Thanks,
Mike

Never heard of doing it that way. Every machine I have ever worked on 
would say to press a certain key to enter setup, or I would just wait to 
see the OEM logo and be quick about it. In fact, I'm suprised your 
method works, as this would simulate a stuck key and usually generate a 
keyboard error.

   I installed Slackware-13.1 on my new laptop yesterday, but the screen is
totally blank and unresponsive after the system boots. I vaguely recall this
happening years ago, but have no recollection of the fix.

   Does this have something to do with the frame buffer and the default
1024x768x256 resolution/colors?

   Where do I interrupt the boot process so I can fix the situation?

Add a 3 to the boot command in grub or lilo to boot to text mode. Then you can make adjustments to you X config. 

Alternatively, you could try to get to text mode by pressing ALT-f(1-6) to go to those consoles.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux friendly 802.11n Wireless Access Point
Message-ID: <4C3370C5.2060208@mailswamp.com>

Hello Linux folks,
I've got Cisco Linksys WAP4410N wireless access point.
It works kind of intermittently with my new Toshiba Satellite A665-S6067
laptop which runs openSUSE 11.2
It lags and crawls when I try to reach any web site and then resumes
normal operation while I'm navigating within that site.
The lagging and crawling repeats again when I'm going to a new web site,
and so on and so forth.
It doesn't matter whether my laptop configured with DHCP or static IP.
Initially I suspected a faulty WAP hardware and tested my notebook with
another WAP4410N device.
The results were the same as with the first WAP.
Funny enough, this WAP expresses to the lesser extent but similar
behavior when it is used with a laptop running MS Win. 7
The notebook's wireless  RTL8172 chipset is not a culprit because it
works perfectly at my workplace with expensive
corporate WAPs (way over my price range).

Could somebody please recommend, based on the personal experience, any
stand alone (No router/firewall,  No DSL/Cable modem)
plain 802.11n Wireless Access Point which works flawlessly with Linux
and doesn't cost an arm and leg.

Thank you in advance for any suggestions or hints,

Alex

Your description screams of DNS problems. Try setting your local DNS
configuration statically to 4.2.2.2 and 4.2.2.3 just for testing, and see if
the problem goes away. If so, you won't be fixing anything by replacing the
WAP.

However, if you don't want to troubleshoot further, what are you going to do
with the WAP4410n when you replace it? If you're selling cheap (since it's
broken, right?) I might make an offer.

   Hmmm. OK. Later. I don't believe it comes up in X by default. With
Slackware one needs to manually invoke kdm/gdm in one of the init files.

The problem with lagging and crawling
did not disappear with setting DNS to:
4.2.2.2 and 4.2.2.3 did

However, I find it quite amusing that when I'm browsing in text mode in
Links, all sites are opening momentarily without any delays.

Browsing in Firefox is still sluggish though.

Try:

  ping -c 100 -n 4.2.2.2

(see if you see any packet loss), and:

  wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.34.tar.bz2

(to test throughput)

One anecdote.  I've encountered 802.11n only once, about a year ago
two Cisco/Linksys N routers plugged in to each other by the GeekSquad
(wrongly, i'll add), somehow seemed to nuke the RF environment.
Unplugging them, and plugging in my 11g device, the RF environment
becomes functional again.

Can someone recommend a tool that can scan source code and detect that other

I've looked at some commercial solution but just wondering if there is open

I had been thinking of the Cisco/Linksys E2100L, but my research
suggests that it's a rebranded WRT160NL. And per its Amazon reviews, the
WRT160NL appears to suck rocks.

But your suggestion w/r/t Netgear is making me look at the WNR3500L,
which at least looks a lot better w/r/t Amazon/Newegg reviews. Thanks!

Thanks,
Mike

Hi Russel,

This ping -c 100 -n 4.2.2.2
gives me between 10 to 19% packet loss.

wget gives me throughput around 367 KB/s

Try the ping to your access point's ip addr (probably 192.168.1.1 or
192.168.0.1, unless you changed it).  If you have modern network
tools (i.e. iproute), this should work:

  ping -c 100 -n $(/sbin/ip route | grep default | cut -d' ' -f3)

That will demonstrate that the packet loss is on the local rf media.

Apologies in advance for continuing to hit the mailing lists with 
requests for feedback, but i'm really getting to the point where 
community input is preferable for the last few bits.

*ahem* this one's a scorcher, ye been warned.

2 quick things, only one of which requires feedback.

quick one first: the calendaring solution has been set up and is 
functional, rather than using a third party solution ala google calendar 
(oh how i loathe to trust a 3rd party w/ critical functionalities), i've 
instead written a php script to generate the current months calendar, 
and compare the dates to a simple csv file containing event info, 
finally setting a tooltip for event days. i do plan to turn these into 
links eventually, but for the moment i'm keeping that one back until the 
wiki is set up and ready.
if you wanna see it in action, same url as before: 
http://nathanewilliams.com/projects/pdxlinux/
if you happen to wanna look at teh codez:
http://www.badgerbait.net/offtopic/php-calendar-from-a-csv-file (note 
this site's been getting hammered by spambots, so may be a little slow 
tonite)


second: here's a cleaned up (lots of dead links) and slightly fleshed 
out (as much as prior knowledge and a cursory google search could) 
version of the NW Linux Groups/Businesses list from the current site's 
resources list. if you know of a group i've left out, please add their 
info at the url below, and i'll add to the list before updating the site.

http://pastebin.org/384933

alternatively, this could go into a wiki article, but then i don't know 
what i'd put into side-nav... maybe a local it jobs rss feed or something...

thanks for your continued patience and advice/opinions folks, we're 
almost there w/ the site.

Hook up an external monitor. Also, try the function key + display key 
(fn+f8 on my Dell) to see if anything changes. I had this problem on my 
old HP laptop.

Nathan,

   It looks very good. However, I urge you to change the text color to black
(or a very dark grey) to increase the contrast against the white background.
What you have might be perfectly clear and readable to young eyes, but not
to older ones. Regardless of application (web pages, presentations) always
chose high contrast between background and text (and avoid dark backgrounds,
too).

I am not aware of such a tool. One alternative could be to use Microsoft RPC
via Samba tools to instruct the 98 machine to shut down from your Linux box
when the UPS detects power loss.

Seconded.
I tend to avoid sites that I can't read.
If need be I can use stylish to fix such sites, if there's something
worth reading there.   But that means I have to go through extra
effort just to read it the first time.

I prefer white backgrounds with yellow text myself :-p Sorry just had

Hello folks,
Just to let you know who had similar problems with Linksys WAP4410N
wireless access point as described below.
The culprit was an original buggy firmware which can be updated to the
latest one:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps10052/index.html
The firmware upgrade solved all the problems with lagging, crawling and
packet loss.
Thanks to everyone who responded and tried to help.

   If you want really unreadable, use bright cyan on light gray. I've seen

No response via the network either?

Maybe not the case here, but I had a system which would stop at a blank 
screen while trying to start X and it turned out to be a full disk.  I 
guess it starts trying to write the log after initializing the driver.

Nathan,

Thanks for redoing the website for us.

No apologies neccessary.  You are doing us a great service, and I think you
have every right to all the polite and thoughtful assistance from the group
that you desire.

I think the website looks great, the calendar tool tips are cool too.  I may
have chosen the google calendar option, because it would be easier for
untrained personnel.  But we aren't in the linux group for an easy time, so
I say do it your way.   I'll be happy to see and use the new website.

Thanks again for all your efforts.

-- Pat

I don't have a copy because the only place to get it so far is by
buying Linux Magazine, and I don't want it badly enough to go to
Powell's to get a copy. And too cheap to buy the copy anyway.

But I understand there is practically no difference between 6.2.1 and
6.3. They use the same kernel. Apparently 6.3 includes some additional
apps that are missing in 6.2.1, Apt-get should take care of that.

I'm downloading the 6.2 DVD as I write this, just 'cause I otter have
it. But I remain curious what your burning need for 6.3 is. Have I
missed some massive improvement in 6.3?

This brings up something that's been bugging me. Why do people still use version numbers? Doesn't a decent package manager make distro versions irrelevant? I guess it makes sense if you want to keep a LiveCD around, but those aren't even that hard to make these days.

The website looks good, even in elinks!  I've got one design question
relating to the FAQ page though.  When I visit the page the first
thing I notice is a large block of grey and not that it's a page full
of questions and answers.  What made you decide to go with expanding
and contracting boxes as opposed to having all the questions on the
page with an outline at the top, similar to the old site?  With the
current design, the questions are a bit difficult to read and there's
no way to simply scroll down the page to read through everything
(except in elinks, which again looks great).

Cheers,

Message-ID: <1278573780.2607.2.camel@localhost>

I couldn't get ibus-chewing and some other update to install on my
Fedora 12 system running on a Pentium 4.  Well, yum downgrade of ibus
and a few dependencies followed by an update got me around this.  I have
a theory that the updates came out such that installing these updates
was impossible dependency wise.  So for anyone else who gets stuck,
try yum downgrade of the problem package(s).

Dirk Dashing 1.1.1 is seg faulting after I applied the latest updates to
Fedora 12.  Anybody know what the cause is?

Subject: [PLUG] autofs...
Message-ID: <1278582568.2218.22.camel@localhost>

Does autofs auto unmount removable media drives as well?

I've been struggling with bash to count seconds off of the date command
to try and get syntax right before tackling file access times, can't
remember how to get that value by the way.  The thought is, if a file
isn't currently being accessed and it hasn't been accessed for say 6
seconds, then the user probably wants some media to be unmounted.
Clearly when the unmount happens, the link to the auto mounted media
will disappear.  Isn't autofs supposed to take care of unmounting media
for you though?  I thought the --timeout=6 for example in auto.master
indicates how long a device can be mounted and not accessed before it
should be unmounted.

So my auto.master looks like this:

/.autofs/zip        /etc/auto.zip250 --timeout=6
/.autofs/cdrom      /etc/auto.cdrom  --timeout=6
/.autofs/bernoulli  /etc/auto.bern   --timeout=6
/.autofs/floppy     /etc/auto.flop   --timeout=6

And my auto.zip250:

# zip 250 drive
zip		-fstype=auto	:/dev/hdd4

And my auto.cdrom:

# cdrom 
cdrom		-fstype=auto	:/dev/hdc

And my auto.bern:
# bernoulli
bernoulli	-fstype=auto	:/dev/sda4

And finally my auto.flop:

# floppy drive
floppy		-fstype=vfat	:/dev/fd0

I should mention that I'm trying to export this media via samba to a
Windows 98SE box.  I'm wondering if samba is interfering with the
unmounting?

I have a directory called file_vault which is samba exported that
contains soft links to the directories that will exist when the media is
mounted.  Every time I access file_vault remotely, the media mounts.

Oh, strangely enough the drives have to seemingly be loaded at boot or
else the appropriate device files won't exist.

I would be happy with an intuitive way to send the unmount command from
the Windows 98SE box via the mouse.

Samba or NFS references to the mounted media will prevent it from
being un-mounted.

you need to add "do" after the semi colon.

I'm afraid there are multiple issues with this.

1. in Bash, you do not use the $ when setting the value of a variable. Also,
you don't need to tell it you are setting the value of the variable; you
Just Do It.

  all="cat list"

2. A "for" loop begins with a "do" command and ends with a "done" command.

  for x in $all;do 'cat msg2 | mailx -s "Test Message"' $x;done

3. You have single-quotes around 'cat msg2 | mailx -s "Test Message"' which
is going to tell Bash to treat the whole string as a single word. There is
no command named "cat msg2 | mailx -s "Test Message" that I am aware of.

  for x in $all;do cat msg2 | mailx -s "Test Message" $x;done

4. I'm not sure this is going to do what you think it's going to do. With
these commands, you're telling Bash to send an email to two addresses: "cat"
and "list" as specified in the variable $all. I assume you have a file named
"list" which you are trying to use the cat command to read. Try this:

  for x in $(cat list);do cat msg2 | mailx -s "Test Message" $x;done

I haven't tested it, so there could be plenty that I've missed. I expect the
above should at the very least provide a much more interesting error. :)

Shouldn't
   set $all="cat list"
be
   set $all=`cat list`

Tim,

   Doesn't seem to make a difference. No error shows up there. Even adding a
'done' to the end of the for loop doesn't help. I'm still missing something
very elementary, yet essential.

If you run your script like:

sh -x path_to/script

You should get a better idea of what is not working.
I think that someone answered earlier.

all=`cat list`

or the bashism version of this

all=$(cat list)

   Ah, so. That has not penetrated before now.

   Seems to have worked ... because it has worked.

Many thanks!

Where's Randal when you need him for calling out a UUOC?

While we're prettifying, how about:
for x in $(cat list); do mailx -s "Test Message" $x < msg2; done

If you want to un-mount the media then with NFS you would simply un-export it.
This assumes that no other machine has NFS references to it or you
still won't be able to
un-mount it.

Samba doesn't have such mechanisms show you would have to stop the service.

That said any media that you want to share should probably be copied to disk
as an image and then loop mounted removing the need to tie up the
physical device.

Also autofs for media is normally used to allow the local user of the
machine access
to the physical devices without the need of root access.

For remote media access I would probably go with WebDav.  Mount it up
through the a web server.
I haven't tried it but it would remove any external references
preventing the media from being un-mounted
via autofs.

Not sure you can, as the file system is being accessed, so autofs will keep it mounted. 

Historically, it's bad practice to export remote file systems. It can cause bad things when the remote source is not available.

I *think* you'll want to put quotes around $x (it's generally a good
idea, anyway):

for x in $(cat list); do mailx -s "Test Message" "$x" < msg2; done

to keep it from doing odd things if any of the addresses you're
mailing to have spaces (eg: '"Plug" <plug at lists.pdxlinux.org>')

Rogan,

   D'accord. I build the lists using only the user at domain.tld to avoid spaces
and inconsistencies. The addresses come from the alpine addresses so I use
cut to extract the third field and write that to a new file.

Subject: [PLUG] Need help finding a replacement laptop CPU fan
Message-ID: <4C3655C9.6040601@gmail.com>

 Hi everyone.

The cpu fan for my Toshiba A105-S4774 is starting to make sounds that
tell me it needs to be replaced. I can take care of cracking the case
and replacing the cpu fan myself. The problem is that I don't know where
to look to find a replacement fan for a laptop.

Does anyone know where I could find a replacement laptop fan for my
Toshiba that is powerful enough to cool an Intel Core Duo T2400
<http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=27235&processor=T2400&spec-codes=SL8VQ,SL8VU,SL9JM,SL9JZ>?
Would Freegeek's store sell something like that?

Thanks in advance for your help!

Yes, FreeGeek would be a great place to look.  They have loose parts as
well as gutted laptops you can buy and take parts out of.

Failing that, you could check SurplusGizmos in Hillsboro or Norvac in
Beaverton.  Though at that point, I'd recommend looking online.  There are
companies that sell discount laptop parts; you can find the part number and
then search for it to find 'em cheap.

hi Dan,

Thanks for your comments. i chose accordion menus because i think it's a 
bit of a modern and sexy effect, and it lets all the questions show up 
right at the top. i did code it the way you describe (questions at the 
top with bookmarks to the corresponding answer section), but this only 
shows up if you're in a basic browser (elinks) or if you have javascript 
disabled in the browser (try disabling js in firefox, and you'll see 
what i mean). <noscript> ftw!

re: legibility, these comments are extremely useful, please keep 'em 
coming. i already heightened font contrast site-wide based on Rich's 
comment, i think this may have led to the decrease in contrast for the 
text on the faq menu as that text is on a different colored background. 
i'll clean that up and increase contrast and font legibility for that 
page specifically tonite.

regarding the accordion menu, if we'd rather have the old style, it's an 
easy change to make. i'd also thought of maybe putting the FAQ section 
into the wiki instead, but hadn't gotten around to it as i already had 
the FAQ page finished. discussion around that idea is welcome, and seems 
to make sense at first consideration.

thanks much for your feedback, together we'll make this site truly awesome.

regards,

nathan w

p.s. as a general update, i've set up the home-page to display an rss 
page of recent activity in the wiki, and will be tweaking it some tonite 
to show dates and what-not. this should improve visibility for the wiki, 
and help indicate that the group is very much alive and active, 
addressing the concern that static pages can be a bit ambiguous as to 
how active a group like PLUG is.

once i've got that tweaked the way i like it, i'll port it to all 
'static' pages.

That was it, compiled fuse and ntfs-3g from source and now I can do what

I'm having trouble figuring out the correct invocation of samba's net

I have a Radeon HD 3450 AGP card that randomly stops sending a signal
to the CTL monitor and worse than that, I think the card is slow.

I need a 4x AGP card with HDMI capability that will work solidly with
my CTL 220UW monitor under Linux.

*Most* NVIDIA cards should work very well under Linux. NVIDIA has
dropped active Linux support for older GPU's and I'm not sure if the
6200 is included although the open source Nouveu(sp) driver should
take care of it for you. I would research a bit to just make sure.

Message-ID: <1278937086.6531.1.camel@localhost>

I have Dirk Dashing 1.1.1 full version and Rick Rocket full version and
I don't like the way the menu entries are set up.  First off, the
uninstall links don't work unless you are root so I want to remove them.
Second off, I seemed to have messed up the Dirk Dashing menu so that the
link to the hints sheet is gone.

Is there a tool to fix up the menu with or do I have to manually modify
files?  Which files do I have to change?

I don't know the correct params either. I did some searching and found
mention of a tool named PowerOff, which can be installed as a service and
allows remote access via network connections (such as telnet). Telnet itself
isn't exactly scriptable, but netcat is, so there may be something workable
that way.

Best of luck.

Subject: [PLUG] named errors  with "Bad cache, hit",
 "Unable to fina DNSKEY" etc. with Bulgarian servers
Message-ID: <4C3B44CE.90802@gisnet.com>

Recently, I started seeing errors like the following (see below) in the 
named section of my Logwatch log. Googling for help on it turned up 
another message with the same symtom, but the only response was "run rpm 
-q bind dnssec-conf unbound and tell us what it says. Since there was no 
follow-up, I still don't know what's happening or what to do about it. 
Looking at which servers that are affected by this makes me wonder if I 
should care. With names like btc-net.bg, ekk-bg, powernet.bg, comnet.bg, 
icon.bg, etc. they look like spammers to me and maybe I should just 
ignore them. I just  don't like to see line and lines of error messages 
in my logfiles every day that I don't understand.

Anyway here's my system details:
[root at www ~]# uname -a
Linux www.gisnet.com 2.6.30.10-105.2.23.fc11.x86_64 #1 SMP Thu Feb 11 
07:06:34 UTC 2010 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

And here's the results of what they asked that other guy:
[root at www ~]# rpm -q bind dnssec-conf unbound
bind-9.6.2-4.P2.fc11.x86_64
package dnssec-conf is not installed
unbound-1.4.4-2.fc11.x86_64
(unless I _need_ to install this, I just as soon not. I'm trying to 
limit the files on my system to just the ones that I need.)

Next,  before I put  a copy of my named.conf file in a public forum, are 
there any security issues I need to know about before I do something dumb?

And finally , this all started just a few days ago, and it's happening 
to other people too. As far as I know, I don't have any reason to have 
anything to do with these busy Bulgarian servers, so is there an easy 
way to just stop them at the door before they even get far enough to 
trigger these errors?
TIA,
- Bill Thoen

Probably nothing to worry about, just remove any security stuff from
the named.conf and post it

Answers to your question are in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 6th results.

As regards your second question, a search for "linux windows rpc" yielded
a page titled, "Remote Shutdown of a Windows Computer from Linux".

I'd ask why you're asking trivial Windows questions on a Linux list, but
that belongs on PLUG-Talk.

With all due respect, I'm not asking about the WINDOWS command.  I'm
asking about the samba net command on the Linux server.  If it were
trivial, I would have figured it out already.  I know there is a NUT
client for Windows XP and later, but it is NOT for Windows 98SE.

It's discussed in the "Remote Shutdown" article I mentioned.  With all due
respect, please read what I wrote, and then look at what I referred to.

No.

The site for the Windows NUT client (search result #1) specifies which
versions have been tested with Windows 98SE.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/winnutclient/

That is presumably the official site for the Windows NUT client and
there is no mention of Windows 98SE anywhere.  Unless you can point
me out to a Windows 98SE version of NUT client, I need the net
invocation on the Linux side or I'll need to try something else.

I googled this before I asked on here.

Thanks Drew, but it all looks like potential "security stuff" to me. So I
think I'd better do some reading up on 'named' and its comfiguration first
so I have some idea what's what. At this point, I know so little that I
probably wouldn't understand the answers you could give me anyway.

And like you said, it's probably not a serious problem.

I already planned on going to the exhibition hall. But apparently there
are other cool things I can do without having to pay. (Although a
modest donation to Linux Fund is not outside the realm of possibility.)

My schedule is flexible. So what times/events/exhibit hall should I put
in my calendar in order to maximize fun and contribution?

I googled the error itself and found some issues with RHEL and one of
the packages being broken but you're at a patch level beyond the one

Definitely would be nice to know what you find out though.

Well Aaron, only an OLD version of WinNUT works which is not obvious
from the web site.  I tried the latest version and practically gave up.
Only when I searched for the old versions link did I get to some
information about what versions work and realized that I need the
2.0.0a... version of WinNUT.  The maintainers of WinNUT should improve
their web site and they should reconsider dropping support for 98SE as 
a lot of people still use it.  People look for WinNUT because of the
lack of commercial support for Linux and Windows 98SE mixed 
environments these days.  Granted, a lot of people run 98SE using
vmware or virtualbox now bypassing this issue entirely.  The 98SE
machine in this case is only a 600 mhz PIII, that is too slow to
run 98SE on top of say Linux emulated.

We're looking into a problem with VOIP phone freezing and have several hundred
phones doing debug level logging to a Solaris box.? Analysis shows
between 1000 and 1500 messages a second being logged.

However after
a few hours we see a backwards drift in timestamps - as if the syslog server
is falling behind.?? I also see that syslog is resolving IP
addresses and writing FQDN to the log.

The man pages only reference
to buffering is that if syslog is sent a HUP it will attempt to flush all
pending messages.?? There is no reference about controlling the DNS
lookup.

Questions:
what is available to control or monitor the
queue and queue size?
how can I turn off the DNS lookup?? (though I
realize the results will be cached)

Cool problem!  I used to have fun working on VoIP equipment.

So timestamps in logged messages are falling behind current-time?

Do you suppose the UDP receive queue is filling up with messages before
they hit syslogd, or syslogd is backing up behind the disk I/O?

At your message rate, you're receiving a lot of bits.

Ah, the joy of Solaris manpages.  You might find other settings in
/etc/default/syslogd or /etc/netconfig or /etc/net/transport/ but I think
Solaris syslogd behaviour is pretty much set in stone.

Have you considered using syslog-ng and/or a more powerful (Linux- or
OpenSolaris-based) log-server?

Yikes!  Russell Senior noticed this:

http://blog.oregonlive.com/thebeerhere/2010/07/craig_nicholls_closes_the_door.html

Roots Organic Brewing is closed.  

We will not be having an Advanced Topics meeting on July 21st
anyway - go to the OSCON parties and BOFs! - but we will need
a venue for AT starting August 19th.  Personal Telco is also
looking for a venue for their meeting Wednesday July 14th.

I like Lucky Lab Northwest, but transit is erratic.  Any other
suggestions?  We need beer, somewhat quiet, beer, a place for
a projector and screen, beer, transit, beer, a place to park,
beer, no room fee, and beer.

Free as in freedom, not free as in beer, so we can pay for the
beer.  Perhaps we can use a meeting room at a public library
or a church, and sneak in the (sacramental?) beer.  

We've got to stop putting our meeting places out of business.
Tip bigger next time.

Keith

If fun is having your phone freeze up.? Yes, we're
having a bit of it.

I
suspect syslog processing of messages is the culprit.? 
iostat
applied after I sent my original message showed no glut of traffic
generally the system load is very low
renicing the syslogd process with
-18 had no effect.
dtrace is not available on this system

/etc/default/syslogd - bah more useless than the
man page.? "uncomment the following default line to change
behavior" the line being "LOG_FROM_REMOTE"
/etc/netconfig
- nothing appropriate
/etc/net/transport - does not exist on this
system

Scheduled for after close of business tonight.? A Linux based system
will be logging. 

It would still be nice to figure out where the
syslog bottleneck is.? It is neither keeping up with the task or exerting
a load on the system.? That's not right and it bugs me to not know what
is going on.

Yikes is right! Seemed fine last night for the functional programming
group meeting!

I called their main line which had a message from May. Not going to call
Craig yet if he's mid-moving.

Let's all brainstorm venues. :( Thanks for the suggestions so far.

To give credit where credit is due, I heard about it fom gepr (Glen
Ropella) on his twitter feed.  Personally, I think credit is overrated
(i.e. the fact is the important thing, who happened to stumble on it
somewhat less so), but he and I have disagreed about that in the past,
so I'll err in his favor here. ;-)

Contributions are always welcomed and I invite you to carry the card!

If you want face time, the Community Leadership Summit and BoF's are
priceless as you are directly engaging the biggest contributors in the
community. If you have *any* questions about *any* aspect of open
source, you will probably get the most-informed answer available
anywhere on Earth. I deem that priceless. The hall way conversations are
also in the same category but less scheduled.

>From there, the expo hall is always fun and there is a free reception
there Wednesday night at 6PM.

Finally, the Linux Fund party Thursday will rock and if you're looking
for awesome work, consider arriving at 7PM for the Rackspace Meet and
Geek event.

While not a help line... anyone is welcome to call me in case of
emergency: 503-789-8978

Actually, we are looking for a venue for our last-wednesday-of-
the-month meetings, including this month's Annual Members Meeting,
which is July 28th, not July 14.

We typically have weekly meetings as well, but the location of those
floats from place to place and they are sometimes cancelled
altogether.

And Multnomah is under construction for a while. It's an un-fun bike

Crazy idea but... I'm talking to a few people about the possibility of a
venue that is 100% ready for meetings and streaming (Root's lighting was
brutal) *and* is profitable.

Maybe we can do a BoF session at OSCON.

Maybe we can get the large local tech companies on board. This is *not*
a question however of using their say... Hillsboro cafeteria once a
month. This would be a a purpose-designed space to meet the *demand*
here in the community.

We all seem to agree that MAX, bike and car access are important.

Sigh. Another challenge!

It looks like the wrong "Multnomah", and the minimum purchase
is $600 + $90 tip.  About 5x what we spend for a smaller meeting.

Pete Lancashire suggests Lucky Lab Killingsworth, which looks
like a good possibility.  Has anyone checked it for screen
friendliness, and free/quiet on Wednesday night?   Perhaps we
ought to perform a beer test there this Wednesday.

While noodling around on google maps, I found the Polish Library
Association Building about a mile south.  Perhaps we can use
that venue for our Polish-language PLUG meetings.  Witam, jestem

one room with a close-able door looks like it would seat 30 or more ?
I've never taken count

plus Max is one block away and Concord the other street LL is on is
now a bike access or what
ever has the bike markers that showed up last month are.

don't know if that makes it any more friendly

There is mention made on that website of "The Broadway Grill &
Brewery", but kind of obscurely.  1700 NE Broadway (near my house!)

Heh, I don't remember the argument (so much for my hypothesis that we 
learn through argument, eh?); but I'm pretty sure the GPL is all about 
applying credit where it's due!  If I didn't mention that before, I 
should have. ;-)  Surely you're not a heretical LGPL fan...

Their second location is the Broadway Grill & Brewery (though the 
brewery part is the Old Market in Garden Home).  At least that was the 
case the last time I went there.

http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=11740558933248022338&q=Broadway+Pub,+portland,+or&hl=en&cd=3&ei=kd08TIblKZPQoASDsuy_Bw&dtab=5&sll=45.529377,-122.652971&sspn=0.014221,0.055768&ie=UTF8&ll=45.572476,-122.707329&spn=0,0&z=13&iwloc=C

It's not clear to me that they have a meeting room appropriate for us, 
though.

As much as the new Lucky Lab on Killingsworth would appeal to me
(because it's about ten blocks from my house), there is no meeting room
at all. Plus, like all Lucky Labs, it is deliberately designed to be
noisy.

Russell,

They may have changed it since you last been there.

What use to be Rue's deli on the East end Lucky has put a door, or put
the door back.
There's a sign over the door saying the room can be reserved, can't
remember the details.

http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=5520+N+Concord+Ave,+Portland,+OR+97217&sll=43.65477,-79.385061&sspn=0.038874,0.06566&g=46+Howland+Ave,+Toronto,+Toronto+Division,+Ontario,+Canada&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=5520+N+Concord+Ave,+Portland,+Multnomah,+Oregon+97217&ll=45.562674,-122.68483&spn=0.002351,0.004104&t=h&z=18&layer=c&cbll=45.562677,-122.684968&panoid=XMWKTXbLvItASoPVxYmXcw&cbp=12,201.18,,0,5

Still show's it being the Rue restaurant , but the room is the East
1/3 of the building. The place when built
was originally three businesses.

As to being noisy, I do agree there.

-pete closer then 10 blocks

It was the Roux restaurant. The building stood vacant for years until
the Roux turned it into a fancy restaurant. Perhaps too fancy, as the
Roux failed only a year or two after opening.

As for the room on the east end, it is an appropriate size for us, but
I don't recall seeing doors to close it off from the rest of the place.
(Someone correct me if my recollection is wrong.) If it can't be closed
off it would be very noisy. Also, I don't recall seeing any walls that
were white, so we'd have to bring a screen. 

But on the plus side, LL/Killingsworth is not doing a huge business.
Any day during the middle of the week that east space is surplus area.
I'm sure they'd love to have our business. And, even though it is not
as busy as their other locations, LL seems overall profitable, so it's
not so likely to close down.

Subject: [PLUG] Sunday 18th is Clinic Day!
Message-ID: <20100714212250.382b6591@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Yes, your favorite Linux activity is this Sunday, July 18th. The famous
PLUG Linux Clinic will be at Free Geek, 1741 SE 10th Avenue, Portland
from 1-5 post meridian?.

Bring your ailing Linux computer and we'll fix it. Or bring your Linux
computer that you need help understanding. Or bring your computer with
an evil OS on it and we'll install Linux. Or just come and look over
shoulders to see what Linux is all about.

We have all kinds of distros.* We have mice, keyboards and monitors,
so generally all you have to bring is the box. We also have coffee and
generally someone brings calories as well.

*At the last Clinic we ran out of blank CDs. I keep forgetting to stop
somewhere and buy a spindle. And I'm almost out at home as well. If
someone who is coming to the Clinic will buy a cheap spindle of 100 I
will personally reimburse you and donate half the spindle to the Clinic.

I happened to be there today, and inquired.  There is a door.
However, there is also a fee for your garden variety group.  The fee
is $75 (with a dedicated bartender), or $50 (without a bartender, but
a maximum of 20 people).  It might be possible to negotiate a
different arrangement, but no guarantee.

I did not investigate wall colors, so the need for a screen is an open question.

Subject: [PLUG] Locale Issue
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1007150629310.5701@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I'm trying to have text properly display in virtual consoles, alpine, and
my small-file text editors (joe or jed). Here's an example from the
attempted build of a python program:

scheduling/gcspmodule.cc: In function ???void run_solve(ProjmanProblem&)???:
scheduling/gcspmodule.cc:61: error: ???Search??? has not been declared
scheduling/gcspmodule.cc:61: error: ???stop??? was not declared in this scope
scheduling/gcspmodule.cc:61: error: incomplete type ???FailTimeStop??? used in
nested name specifier

   When I run 'locale' I see this:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ locale
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE=C
LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"

LC_ADDRESS="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ALL=

   Paul's tried helping me fix this within alpine (for which joe is the pico
replacement) but I've no idea why the locale is not allowing accented
letters to properly display. Further, I have no clue where to seek expert
help other than by asking here.

Subject: [PLUG] Really bad DELL experience...
Message-ID: <20100715192635.4wb1re4mj6sso04w@web.robinson-west.com>

I tried to order an Inspiron mini 10 Ubuntu 9.1.0 mobilon 2.1 Dell laptop.

The keyword is tried.  The laptop came without an operating system.   
The laptop came without media.  To make matters worse, sending the  
laptop to the shop to be diagnosed for hardware problems, it came back  
to me without an operating system and without media.

DELL tried really hard to push me into installing Ubuntu 8.04 telling me that
9.1.0 is not supported and that they can't send me media for it.  I  
asked why I couldn't send the laptop back in to have the proper  
contractual version of Ubuntu installed.  DELL still insisted that  
they cannot install that going even further suggesting that I could  
download the generic version and install it myself.  Hello, I don't  
order a DELL laptop with Linux pre installed just to turn around and  
install Linux on it myself.

DELL ran my mother around Elmer's barn for 5 hours and brought her to  
tears.  Finally, I got tough and said basically, you have three  
options.  Option 1, take the laptop back into the shop and install the  
contractual version of
Linux on it.  Option 2, send me media to install Ubuntu 9.1.0 (mobilon  
2.1).  Option 3, take the laptop back and refund the purchase price at  
your expense.

I asked DELL if there is an official site I can download the copy of Linux
that is supposed to be on the laptop from, they said that there isn't one.
My concern is, generic Ubuntu will not be set up for this laptop  
specifically.  I have the UPS label and the laptop packed to go back  
now, but I wonder if I can get the appropriate software if I shouldn't  
reconsider?  For now, I'm trying to shop at the local computer store  
again for an Asus mini laptop.
I'll have to do the fdisk install Linux number possibly, but at least I
won't have to put up with DELL.

Warning to anyone considering a DELL Inspiron Mini 10 with Ubuntu  
9.1.0, DELL will not provide media for that version of Ubuntu and in  
all likelihood, DELL will not install that version.  If you want to go  
around Elmer's barn for 5 hours with DELL, that is certainly up to  
you.  I don't know if I'll ever buy
another DELL computer.

Thank you Drew.  

I guess I'm still going to return the OS'less laptop.  Denying DELL
business after what my mother was put through is the least I can
do.  The thing that bugs me the most is when she was told that DELL was
making a special exception by offering to refund her.  Something is
really wrong when the company that is legally hanging out insists that
the person with the problem is you.

Nothing against Indians in general, but everyone I talked to was
probably from there.  If there is prejudice because I can get paid
more to do the same thing here in the states that they are doing in
India, I am capable of appreciating that.  If DELL's Indian workers 
ruin the company's reputation, the Indians responsible are not 
helping to solve the wage issue.  The work will simply come back to
the states if Indian workers demonstrate an inability to respect
American customers.  Americans aren't going to stop using computers
because of prejudiced tech support workers over seas.  If there truly
is a culture of prejudice, I hope it clears up over time.  I really am
not interested in being the enemy of a nuclear power like India.

I really wonder if some of these tech support jobs should come back to
the states anyways with the way the economy is lately.  People need
jobs so bad that supposedly 90%+ of Americans say that the economy 
is in poor shape.

Maybe in time and in better economic times prejudices will fade.
Someday hopefully, we will all realize that there is only one 
human race and that everyone is part of that one human race.

Given your previous posts, this doesn't surprise me. You and searching 
the internet just don't seem to go together:

I can understand a Windows user being upset about this, and yeah, they 
shouldn't have done this, but you're like the first Linux guy I've ever 
met that is having a fit about having to install it. Most prefer it.

Oh, here's Chromium too in case you want to play with that on your Mini:

?! What the #$%^? You're OK with installing on an ASUS which doesn't 
provide the Linux ISO you want any more than Dell does? You make the 
biggest issues from the smallest problems.

Okay Mogerly, you go ahead and be happy with DELL selling you a 
computer with Linux "pre installed" when there is no installed 
operating system.  You listen to DELL tell you that they won't 
install the advertised Linux system because they "don't support 
it," and then listen to them push installing an older version of 
Ubuntu Linux, 8.04.

I would rather fdisk and reinstall on an Asus laptop then put up 
with DELL selling me a "Linux pre installed" laptop that they won't
install the advertised version of Linux onto.  DELL didn't argue 
for 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, but indeed DELL argued for 
5 hours.  DELL's argument that they can't come up with media to 
install Ubuntu Mobilon 2.1 from is complete nonsense.  That Ubuntu
Mobilon 2.1 is in the contract and they refused to install it, that 
is bait and switch.  You don't dilute the DELL name by advertising 
Linux Ubuntu 9.1.0 Mobilon 2.1 pre installed and then refuse to 
install it.  The inaction on DELL's part even when the machine was 
in the shop getting the hard drive replaced defies reason.  DELL 
could have and should have installed Mobilon 2.1 when the hard 
drive was replaced.

This is a very big deal.  DELL broke the law and then tried to get me 
to accept an inferior solution.  Took Drew a few minutes to find the
OS that DELL was supposed to install on this laptop, but DELL couldn't
tell me even after 5 hours of being on the phone with them.

I'd rather repurpose an ASUS laptop with Windows 7 pre installed for
Linux than fight with DELL.  The way DELL handled this laptop order,
everyone lost.  This is the one of the stupidest things a computer
builder can do.  DELL alienated a long time customer and lost
money to boot via 5 hours of telephone run around.  DELL may need to
reconsider who it hires for tech support and customer care.

Mogerly, I am not incapable of using Internet search engines.  I do not
need your expletives after witnessing my own mother brought to tears by
the run around and rudeness of some of DELL's employees.  There is an
old saying, "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything
at all," that I think applies in your case.  If the you can't use search
engines comment applies to the WinNUT issues I ran into, I explained
that the answer wasn't obvious.  It wasn't obvious that I needed to look
at the page for older versions of WinNUT to get a release that would
work.

OK, so I'm not on dial-up, but I have a local ISP's service and I buy 
their lowest speed; I pay $15/mo to quest to lest 'someone else' provide 
  ISP services, and they are Opusnet. My level gets me 56K up / 26K down.

I haven't had any problems; iirc I called tech support maybe once with a 
year and a half.

But I am looking for faster service, and a Comcast guy gave me a sales 
pitch while I was shopping for something else at Best Buy.

I don't watch TV and so I don't need any cable services.

What does the PLUG community feel about Comcast?
If I want higher speeds, who else should I look into who is Linux- and 
privacy- friendly?

Your suggestions?

Pros:
  * download speeds are zippy
  * pretty good uptimes
  * comcast is making money, so your service provider won't go broke
  * IP addresses are fairly stable, even on "dynamic" accounts

My experience is that the network is solid. Downtimes usually come in 
bunches and are typically the result of Comcast shuffling IP 
addresses. I've had the same IP address at home for several months 
now.

Cons:
  * no choice for backend ISP
  * restrictive terms of service, esp. for inbound traffic
  * as comcast thrives, the provider market shrinks

Comcast wants you to be a bandwidth consumer, not a service provider. 
There are currently no blocks on, say, inbound ssh traffic, but 
Comcast's terms of service don't rule out such a block in the future.

I would refine that to say

A bandwidth consumer would

I too bad they sent you an OS-less laptop when you were expecting one with
OS installed.  I'm surprised that would happen without you requesting it.

If you want to get it working, you could bring it to the Linux Clinic this
Sunday.  Maybe you can help other folks too.  And then we could actually
see the face of one of PLUG's most prolific posters.

I think it's pretty clear that his goal is to end up with what he agreed
upon. Dell has clearly failed to hold up their end of the purchase
agreement, based on what information Michael has provided. Then, they failed
to make it right, and insisted on trying to force their customer to fix the
problem himself (and not very nicely, considering his description of his
mother's reaction). I'm pretty sure I would be making the same choice if I
were in his position.

However, I have had largely good experiences with Dell in most of my
interactions with them... far more positive than with other large companies
I've talked to (HP, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, to name a few). So if this
had happened to me, counting the positive experiences I have had, I might
not be making the same choice. Nonetheless, I think returning the OS-less
laptop is a correct choice given the circumstances.

That said, there are obviously other correct solutions. To each, his own.

Your 5 hours with no solution vs my 3 minutes with the solution was my 
point. Also, it's not a big deal, because instead of the OS'less laptop 
going someone who was incapable of rectifying this himself, it went to 
someone who could. I know someone who ordered a Dell last year and got 
it OS'less like you. Hard to believe there is any QA going on there when 
you see stuff like this. So my friend calls me up and I say bring it

we visited.

You have the ability to solve this, but you chose the "principle" route. 
You could have Linux up and running on this laptop in a couple hours my 
guess is, but your attitude is: Dell's not going to get away with this 
nosiree! You let your mom sit on the phone with Dell for hours when you 
could have made this a better situation for her by saying Mom, let me 
handle this, don't worry about it.

You're in a situation that stinks. Your options were get Dell to handle 
it, or handle it yourself. Either one is an inconvenience, but one was a 
better option than the other. You didn't choose that one.

It's fine to do that, but to sit there and watch someone non-technical 
sit on the phone for 5 hours and do nothing about it, when he could 
have? ?Ay, caramba! If he's going to make his mom do it, then he should 
have just told her to tell Dell to send another one and be done with it. 
They may have wanted to try and fix it over the phone, but just say no

Paul covered it pretty well, though my experience with Comcast
was 1 to 3 hour outages about 4x per year.  That was probably
due to the high population of users in our neighborhood saturating
and overheating the amplifiers on the line.  After frequent
occurences, I started calling them "Com-cant".

You can indeed get Internet Only service from Comcast, though
they will try to sell a bundle with TV and phone.

Regards blocked addresses, I run an outbound VPN to an offsite
virtual server, and all inbound traffic comes though that.
I can even failover to a second IP address on the offsite,
(ab)using port 443 (normally https) for the link.  They would
have a heck of a time blocking that ...

I'm now using Verizon\\\\\\\Frontier FIOS, 15M/5M (their minimum
offering), and it works great.  I'm having trouble getting the
service undergrounded, and their phone support is based on a
horror story by Edgar Allan Poe, but the bits are fine. 

And like Comcast, they try to upsell me to TV service, and
don't believe me when I say I would rather put a two inch
auger drill through my skull than watch broadcast TV (the
drill is somewhat less damaging to my alleged intelligence).

A minor issue is DNS - both Comcast and FIOS intercept DNS
port 53, and send ads rather than standard "URL not found"
messages.  Pesky.

I have no idea about Verizon, but Comcast at least lets you opt out of
that. It is on by default, but I've turned it off successfully, and
without much fuss.

I'm at. I looked....)

Message-ID: <4C40CD84.8000801@mailswamp.com>

Hello Linux folks,
I just installed newly released openSUSE 11.3 on my Toshiba laptop.
However, my Realtek wireless RTL8191SE  LAN 802.11n chipset is not
working anymore. I'm using Realtek provided driver for this wlan interface
compiled for 2.6.34-12 desktop SUSE kernel.

when I execute

ifup wlan0

it gives me this message:
------------------------------------

Starting wpa_supplicant

nl80211: 'nl80211' generic netlink not found

Failed to initialize driver interface

------------------------------------

Was something recently changed in the Linux kernel related to netlink?

Could somebody please give me a hint or advise how to solve this problem.

Thank you in advance,

Alex

There are two problems with this. The first problem is the fact that
this link doesn't solve his problem. Here are some quotes from the
page that explain why it's not the solution:

>To start out you will need the following:
>...
># An Ubuntu installation, version 9.10 or later.

So, it requires that he *already* has Ubuntu 9.10 installed, which is
exactly his problem; he doesn't.

Also, it won't be the same as what he should have gotten.
Additionally, it says "what you receive when ordering Ubuntu". This
implies that he should have, in fact, received a copy of Ubuntu.

The second problem with this message is that there a certain amount of
"I'm not getting paid for this" behind the RTFM and STFW arguments. In
this case someone *did* get paid, and they didn't meet their part of
the exchange. Imagine buying RHEL, then calling Red Hat and being told
you can't get media. The local user group can tell you that CentOS is
just as good, but regardless of equivalence or not, a contract was
broken and no amount of searching the web will change that. The only
thing that will change that is if Dell installs the advertised
software on the system.

OpenSuse 11.3 was released a couple days ago. I like to keep the
current version of all major distros in case someone who has poor
bandwidth wants one. Accordingly, I have downloaded the 32- and 64-bit
versions of the Gnome and KDE live CDs (4 CDs). To conserve disk space I
did not download the DVD versions, but can do so if someone wants them.
The CDs took about 15 minutes each by torrent, so I can do the DVDs
easily as well.

I'll be at the Clinic this Sunday in case someone wants a copy.

If you're curious about their IRC support the logs are online for review.

Subject: [PLUG] Dirvish-compatible NAS suggestions (will consider other
	backup tech. if necessary..)
Message-ID: <AANLkTikIVWRAX6oHVihSVamdVCJ8UBed12icr2dv7dTk@mail.gmail.com>

I'm looking for a NAS, but I would really like to use dirvish (see
below) and I'm skeptical that most NASes will support dirvish
properly.  My priority, however, is to find an off-the-shelf solution
that "just works".

I like dirvish for the following reasons:

 * it's relatively easy to set up (eg: I've done it before)
 * it stores incremental backups in a way that is trivial to restore
data -- I can not stress enough how much I want to be able to easily
navigate my backups and just copy files out to restore data.  Dirvish
creates date-indexed directory trees that use (hard?) links to save
space and present a, uh, "WYSIWYG" view of your backups.  This is
essential :)

Unfortunately, when I last used dirvish, I found that it really
doesn't work well if you mount the backup volume with a protocol that
doesn't support hard links.  (This includes samba and sshfs.)  The
linking commands silently fall back to creating new copies of the
data, so the incremental nature of dirvish doesn't end up saving any
space -- I've quickly filled multi-tb drives with nightly workstation
backups because of this.

Does anyone know of a NAS that either has dirvish support, or exports
drives in a way that I can mount them and successfully use dirvish?
Alternatively, does any one know of a backup solution that would fill
the same desiderata above?

I'm considering a buffalo tech. terastation or linkstation -- my gf.
has used one with a number of windows systems, and it seems to be
reliable.  They also run linux, which I obviously support, and there
is a debian-based distro that will run on them, so in a pinch I could
install that and set dirvish up in that way, however, I would really
rather just have an off-the-shelf solution that "just works" (and some
of the other buffalo tech features sound really nice -- such as the
built-in bittorrent client).  Based on my Googling, it seems that most
people just mount terastations with samba, which (afaik) still won't
work for dirvish.

This is for a home solution, so I'm not looking for a multi-thousand
dollar solution, or insane redundancy.

Thanks for your input!

Seconding the Brain Silo suggestion, they have lots of comfy office

I'm still trying to decide if letting #1 son know of the existence of 
FreeGeek was a good idea.

After running around swapping parts between his GeekBox and the family 
computer (AKA the Handy Pile of Parts) he's left me with a quirk in the 
family computer -- it used to have an Nvidia card in it, which he 
claimed.  Ubuntu would boot, but bitched severely about the lack of the 
Nvidia card and wouldn't reconfigure itself as advertised.  I tried 
uninstalling the Nvidia driver, hoping that would fix up the 
configuration files -- it doesn't; now Ubuntu bitches that it can't find 
the driver.

Argh.

So, how do I tell Ubuntu Karmic that it isn't supposed to load the 
Nvidia kernel module any more?

greetings and salutations!

At this point, a semi-final review is requested for the proposed new PLUG
website; i'm taking all critiques, be it spelling, technique, aesthetics,
broken links, etc.

Proposed site viewable at: http://nathanewilliams.com/projects/pdxlinux/

If you can find the time, try to get comments in by Tuesday, so I'll have
time to implement suggestions prior to launch.

One note I'll make is that the favicon of the bee is /not/ going to be on
the live site, that's pulling across from another favicon for a different
site sharing this hosting space. the favicon will continue to be the tux w/
umbrella that's now on the current site.

thanks folks!

nathan

The xorg.conf file would be Ubuntu's brains, yes?

Where is it?

I've tried 'find', and it doesn't pop up.

The trick is knowing the correct name of module. You should be able to
figure this out w. lspci, dmesg, or looking in /etc/X11/xorg.conf

I blakclist my onboard audio when I want to use usb powered speakers.
blacklist snd_hda_intel

lsmod will list loaded kernel modules, if i remember right the nvidia
module is nv or nvidia. so adding those to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
should blacklist the modules. 


reconfiguring X should be pretty straightforward... if i remember right,
the newer versions of Ubuntu don't even use xorg.conf unless you want
manual control or have installed proprietary graphics drivers... so maybe
something like 'sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak',
followed by a reboot would let Ubuntu figure out the config automagically
at boot like it does on a fresh install.

also, if i remember right, when X fails to load, one of the options
presented is to reconfigure X? that's always been enough to get me out of a
jam.

good luck!

Marvin,

Nice looking website.  Please check the history page.  The first two 
paragraphs are repeated and the fifth paragraph need attention, too.

sudo update-initramfs -a

should update the initramfs, try it after you add the kernel module to
the blacklist.

  On all my Ubuntu boxes, /etc/X11 contains the xorg.conf configuration 
stuff. Why wouldn't that correct?

I'll be in 10.04 in about 15 minutes (need to swap hd) then I can check 
what they're doing with that version. However, if you have Xorg 
installed, I would think they haven't changed it all that much...

  Nathan,

Well done. The site looks very good. Other than what Ken mentioned, I 
didn't catch anything else.

Thank you, that was it -- once I got my capitalization right.

I dunno why it didn't pop up in 'find'.  Oh well -- problem solved.

Overall I think it looks great! I do have a few minor suggestions:

 * I'd like to have an indication of which of the links in the top nav
bar is "active" (or, put another way, which of those pages am I
looking at?) I was a bit confused when clicking on 'about' didn't
change the page. A visual cue (maybe underline the others? underline
the current one? bold? I'm not sure what would be best), and removing
the hyperlink nature of the currently viewed page would be great.

 * I expected larger clickable areas for the nav bar links, and a
visual indication of when I was over the 'hot' part.  Could you make
the clickable div closer to the full height of the dark bar?

 * The FAQ headers seem like they could be easier to read.  Does
bolding the text or making the gradient lighter help?

Thanks!

One the Clinic page, the first paragraph is sort of wrong or out of
date. There was a brief hiatus for a few months several years ago, but
the Clinics are not "back by popular demand."

I suggest replacing the first paragraph with the following:

From 1 to 5 pm on the third Sunday of each month PLUG holds our popular
Linux Clinics. People bring their computers and experienced users help
them do everything from fix minor problems to a complete installation.
Some also come just to look over shoulders to see what Linux is all
about. For those bringing their computers we have mice, keyboards and
monitors, so generally all you need to bring is the box. We also have
the latest versions of major distros and will be happy to burn you a
CD. We even have coffee, and usually several people bring calories in
various formats. In the spirit of open source there is no charge for
the Clinic. 

The Clinic is not just for the benefit of newcomers to Linux. It is
also a great place for experienced users to learn how to help people
new to Linux. It is also a way for people in the open source world to
give back to the community.

Right after sending that it occurred to me that the Clinic page should
also mention how long we have been holding the Clinics. If I recall
correctly they were at Riverdale School for ten years, then, after a
hiatus for a few months, at Free Geek. 

I don't know when they started, but I bet there is someone here who has
the start date.

Another small editorial change:

For the General meeting, "Afters" is currently at Lucky Labrador in NW

And I forgot to say previously that I think the new site design is
terrific. I'd like to start a round of applause for Nathan.

This may be a silly question, but on a CentOS 5.5 system running gnome  
is there a way to get a panel icon related to the wireless connection  
similar to what happens in Windows XP?  In Windows XP, firing off  
dhclient equivalent and choosing the access point are rolled into one  
icon.  Another thing I want
is the ability to ignore an access point or lock to an access point (without
having to hard code this behavior).

Hello,

Most of this functionality (if not all) should be available in GNOME Network
Manager.
It can dock as an applet in the "system tray" area, and it allows access to
wireless and wired connections.

You're right, you want RSync and/or NFS to do Dirvish backups, and most
NASes don't come with those enabled by default.

OTOH, nearly all of them run Linux and are easily hackable.  I recommend
and use a D-Link DNS-323 which is trivially hackable using fun_plug.
The '323 is getting long in the tooth but it's cheap and well designed.

I enabled rsync support on mine a while ago, and it makes backups
delightful.  (I just use straight "rsync --link-dest").

You might also consider one of the nice plug computers (e.g. SheevaPlug) or
hackable access-points with USB (e.g. NSLU2), and use cheap, portable,
flexible USB drives.

Maybe do not install any OS on the laptop or Dell might claim that by doing
so the warranty is void and returning the laptop for a full refund is no
longer an option?

If you are set on keeping it or want to see if it is even worth keeping,
perhaps try installing from a USB drive or at least test out live versions
on the USB drive to see if all the hardware will be supported.

After pricing out some SATA drives, I think the best solution (for me,
at least) is to just drop a few TB of disk in my media machine and use
that.  It's already on 24/7, runs Linux, and can become a NAS for a
fraction of the cost of a populated device.  I'm also really not wild
about managing another full linux system, but the standard NAS backup
capabilities don't look all that great for linux clients.

I like the new look, very clean and spiffy.  I do have some nits to
pick, mostly with the navigation bar.

1)  The "Wiki" button is directly below the "About" button -- I suspect
that it's supposed to be at the far right end of the bar, but for some
reason it's not.  It doesn't seem to be related to the width of the
browser window.  I have a wide screen monitor, and can stretch the
window out quite a lot.  FWIW, I'm running FireFox v3.5.10.

2)  The button leading back to the home page should be labeled "Home"
instead of "About".  "About" or "About Us" (etc.) is usually a separate
page in those websites that actually have such a thing.  It took me a
bit to realize that "About" led to "Home".  The alt-text for the
buttons was the key.  :-)

3)  As someone pointed out earlier, it would be nice if the buttons were
the full height of the bar.  It would be even nicer if they responded
to a mouseover.  I do like the alt-text for the buttons; it's a nice
touch.

4)  The FAQ buttons are hard to read.  (Old eyes don't work so well any
more. :-) )  It's the 3D rounded effect that does it; the text tends to
get lost in the gradient.  Also, the rounding makes the two multi-line
buttons stand out from the others.  If a 3D effect is really wanted, I
think a simple beveled box would be nicer.

4.5)  The use of the "window shade" effect for the FAQ looks nice except
for one thing: it makes the scroll bar on the browser come and go.  This
leads to a rather disconcerting sideways jerk when the buttons are
clicked.  I know that the scroll bar's actions are part of the browser's
design, and not the web site's, but it's still somewhat jarring.

5)  I think somebody mentioned it already, but that map link for the
PSU meeting room is broken.  It should be

<http://pdxlinux.org/campus_map.jpg>

Other than those things, the web site looks really nice.  A modern and
professional looking site.  Well done!

Sounds like a good decision.  Beloved Wife doesn't like the noise or power
consumption of an always-on PC, hence the DNS-323.

BTW, if speed is not the top priority, the WD "Green Power" disks work
pretty well.  Nice and quiet, and they won't load up your PSU or heat up
your house like the high-performance disks do.  (Check SilentPCReview)

Message-ID: <20100719220149.GC16151@kailarose.respond2.com>

OK, speaking of hackable ARM-based Linux devices, there's a nifty thing on
the shelves at Best Buy, of all places:
http://www.slashgear.com/insignia-infocast-chumby-powered-display-gets-hack-instructions-2290927/

It's a Chumby* with an 8" screen, available from a local retailer.

So you get something that will play net-radio, act as a jukebox (2GB uSD
storage, or use your media server), show weather/news/RSS/Twitter, run free
Chumby apps, or whatever apps you feel like coding for it, and when you get
tired of all that, it'll act like an Internet-enabled photo-frame.

If it breaks, you take it back to your local Best Buy.

Or you just hack it using the built-in hacker features and expansion ports
Bunnie designed into it.

I can't wait to SSH into my photo-frame.

* Chumby is a built-to-be-hacked Linux device designed by Bunnie Huang.
  Like the iPhone and Android, people make apps for it, but it's been
  around for half a year longer than the iPhone.

It really depends on your interests.  Check on the OSCON web page for 
updates to the after hours meetings.  I know there is a PostgreSQL bof 
on Wednesday at 7PM.  The exhibit hall is open on both Wednesday and 
Thursday.

I must work this week, but my time is mine to schedule as I see fit, so
I can take some time off for OSCON.

I figured I'd take an afternoon and evening off - the afternoon for the
exhibit hall, and the evening for whatever free festivities there are.
I'm just a desktop user of Linux, not a programmer, not a sysadmin, not
a developer - so most of the technical stuff at OSCON is of little
interest to me. But if I can do something for Linux Fund without
breaking my personal piggy bank, I'd be happy to do so. I'm also
interested in ways to entice users of other OSs to switch to Linux. 

I guess I have to decide between going to the exhibit hall Wednesday
and the free reception afterward, or going to the exhibit hall on
Thursday and the Linux Fund party afterward. The latter sounds more
interesting, but who is invited to the Linux Fund party? Details?

and firefox 3.6.4 on CentOS 5.5 to work together.

Where is the global plugins directory anyway?

Firefox should have a way to tell you.

An annoyance of mine is that automatic install never seems to work in a
Linux environment, but it always seems to work under Windows.  The
firefox developers really should address this seemingly anti Linux
aspect of the browser.

I installed Java 6 runtime environment update 21 I think.

[plug_0 at goose ~]$ rpm -q jre
jre-1.6.0_21-fcs

I found /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins and decided to change that
to a virtual link.  I pointed it at /usr/lib/firefox-addons/plugins
which I created manually.  I also decided to move extensions to
firefox-addons and create a virtual link.  I found an empty
firefox-3.0.5 and an empty firefox-3.0.6 directory, so I removed them.
I searched the whole hard drive for plugins and didn't find any other
candidates for the global firefox directory.  Again though, firefox
itself should be able to tell me.

The only instructions I can find say to make a symbolic link to the
correct libjavaplugin_oji.so in the global or your local mozilla plugins
directory. I've done this, but when I do about:plugins in firefox I
don't see java.  Sun's java test fails.

Thank you Nathan.
I'm at OSCON and won't have much time to look at the web site this
week, but intend to look at it in detail.  However, overall it looks
wonderful.  So much better than the old site.  (That isn't to say
anything bad about the old site.  It was created around 2001 or 2002
and hasn't been actively maintained since that time - so it looks sort
of 2002ish.)

Message-ID: <AANLkTimctjO-cvlPWyQNAw5cFdklWjs_e5kXsg7Ip5Jz@mail.gmail.com>

Contrary to what I said at the last PLUG meeting; PLUG will have a
booth at OSCON.  This is a very last minute thing.  We were not
scheduled to have a booth due to lack of space, but at the last minute
space opened up.  So we have a booth, but are totally unprepared.  I
left our booth banner in Corvallis and we did not plan to man a booth.

So, Alan Olson will be helping out.
We could use a few other volunteers.
If anyone has any fliers for PLUG (or Open Source in Oregon or
whatever) that would be wonderful.
And I think Linux Fund would be willing to spend a few dollars for
printing costs; but check with me before getting anything printed if
you want reimbursed.
If anyone has anything to enhance the booth that would be cool as well.
(Maybe the PSU Rocket people could bring an Open Source Rocket!)

As in previous years, we want to advertise PLUG but we are also want
to advertise Open Source in Oregon and we are happy to use our booth
to advertise other Open Source groups in Oregon so long as PLUG's
message doesn't get entirely drown out - which is unlikely.

The lib link is step one.

The centos rpm's don't seem to but the links in the right place for
firefox to find.  They use
alternatives for providing this linkage but if you use the sun rpm's
they do it wrong.  The sun's rpm override the
alternatives redirection.
Beside the java link see if you have a javaws link.  Also if these
links are not on in firefox directory tree
or on your search path then things fail.

Just think of it a MS refunding the "Windows tax" on computers sold to

To be fair, Microsoft does open source a decent amount of stuff and
contributes to plenty of large open source projects.   Not that I use any of
there actual products, but they aren't always the bad guy.

Dave,

This is wonderful!

I am more than willing to help. I think I have some PLUG banners and
fliers in my computer and can print up what we need. I think Keith has
our business cards, and maybe he can show up with them.

I will tell my house rehab people that I will be gone Wednesday and
Thursday. Do I understand correctly that those are the days of the
exhibit hall when we need the booth manned?

I will be at work all day today without a computer, but you can get me
at 503-957-0656.

Message-ID: <4C45EB51.9090905@robertmarktech.com>

  All,

I'm trying KVM out as a replacement for Vmware ESX. I have installed 
Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64 on an HP DL360. Setting up a CentOs 5.4 image, the 
install took 10 hours. I'm guessing the problem lies in the way I've get 
storage pools and volumes setup?

I originally tried to do a storage pool on a  physical disk device, but 
had trouble creating a volume on it after. Finally decided to abandon 
that in favor of pre-formatted block device storage pool. Has anyone 
used pre-formatted block devices with KVM before?

My reasoning for physical disk, and then the block device storage pools 
was I assumed it would be faster than simply a file system directory. 
I'm curious if anybody on this list has experience with the best setup 
for storage pools? What criteria did you use to determine which type to 
go with?

thanks,

I'm interested to know what applications you plan to run in the VM 
that make disk I/O performance so important.

My initial Xen installations several years ago were all to KVM 
partitions, but recently I've settled on file-based disk 
representations:

  * they're easy to rsync to other hosts and/or backup
  * i haven't noticed any significant performance difference

  I'll be running enterprise schedulers, web application front end, and 
various databases at the backend (Oracle, Sybase, MSSQL). Other than the 
db, the rest of the applications shouldn't be too heavy on disk I/O.

If you haven't seen any performance issues with file based, I think I'll 
go that route. Management of the files just seems easier.

thanks,
Dan H.

If the install took 10 hours I would check to make sure you're running KVM on a processor with hardware virtualization. What you describe sounds like what I'd expect if it was falling back to using Qemu emulation instead of KVM.

I've seen a lot higher and more dependable performance using LVM LVs for KVM storage than using files on the filesystem.

I'm interested to know what applications you plan to run in the VM 
that make disk I/O performance so important. 

My initial Xen installations several years ago were all to KVM 
partitions, but recently I've settled on file-based disk 
representations: 

* they're easy to rsync to other hosts and/or backup 
* i haven't noticed any significant performance difference

Overall the site looks great. Thanks for all the work on it.

Here are the things my editor eye spotted:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Opening paragraph on:

http://nathanewilliams.com/projects/pdxlinux/meetings/

is likely from long ago. By now it probably make more sense to switch to 
"was" instead of "has been" as in:

The advanced topic meeting was a dream of Zot O'Connor and David Mandel.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The sidebar on:

http://nathanewilliams.com/projects/pdxlinux/mail/

I only recently learned that there are two schools of thought on links 
to other sites: open in a new window, or open in the current window. 
I've always been a fan of open in a new window. I bow to the collective 
wisdom of the rest of the group if my preference is in the minority.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Style issue on:

http://nathanewilliams.com/projects/pdxlinux/history/

I'm guessing that David Mandel wrote the content of this page, but it 
reads as an unnamed narrator in the first section, followed by a switch 
to the first person in the second section. Perhaps a by-line could be 
added under "History of Plug" at the top of the page, or the section 
under "David Mandel takes over in 1995" could be rewritten as if the 
unnamed narrator was talking about David.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sentence construction, or maybe just a typo on:

http://nathanewilliams.com/projects/pdxlinux/history/

The second event under "PLUG activities and events included:" includes 
the sentence, "This was actually a two meetings." Maybe that "a" should 
be "at."

Also, the last sentence sounds like it was partially rewritten but only 
changed in one spot. " Since few people were at both meetings, so the 
total audience was quite large." Either drop the word "Since" or the 
word "so" after the comma. In either case, the comma is unnecessary.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OK. Now that I've reached the end of the History page, I see that David 
did write the content. I still think it would be better to move the 
by-line to just under the title. Most of that content is still relevant. 
But, the section on Netule might want to be removed, or edited to 
indicate the what happened to the project. Perhaps the page could be 
expanded, by someone who remembers, to include what's happened between 
2002 and now. David?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sidebar on History page:

1997. Shouldn't that be, "Linux trademark assigned to Linus Torvalds," 
instead of "Linux Torvalds?"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Back on the Home page, could we have the name of the month included with 
the calendar? I realize that it is the current month, but I'm too used 
to seeing calendars with the month name included. (Personal preference. 
Willing to be overruled.)

Thanks again for the work on the site.

My understanding is that the overwhelming (possibly only?) reason to
force a browser to open a link in a new window is if you have a very
strong belief that the user wants to remain on the initiating page.
This is true for things like web-based email clients, for example.

I think (and I'm just guessing here) that either behavior is roughly
equally desirable in other situations, however, browsers make it
substantially easier to open a "normal" link in a new tab/window than
opening a "opens in new window" link in the current tab (or window).
Middle-clicking on a link does this in firefox, opera and chrome by
default.  Chrome doesn't even appear to support opening an "open in
other window" link in the current tab :(.

I will be available Wednesday and Thursday. I will arrive Wednesday
morning about 9 am with 50 PLUG flyers, banners, my computer, and
myself. Assuming they let me in the door I should have the booth set up
and reasonably presentable by 10.

I intended to call Free Geek today to see if they had some fliers or
literature we could distribute, but I couldn't find time to make the
call. If someone knows a Free Geeker who might be able to deliver us
some stuff it would be cool to have it on the table. Any other open
source groups in the area would also be cool.

I can spend all day Wednesday and Thursday at the booth, but being able
to leave for an hour or two is nice. If there are others besides Alan
who can help it would be cool.

On my system, Firefox installs to /usr/lib/firefox-3.6.6/ and I just add
a plugins subdirectory under that.  As of about Firefox 3.6.4 the name
of the Java plugin changed.  Here's the output of an ls command:

libnpjp2.so -> /usr/java/jre1.6.0_18/lib/i386/libnpjp2.so*

The server is a quad amd opteron 64. When I look for svm in cpuinfo:

So the extensions are there. I'll make sure they're not disabled in the 
bios.

Great! Tell them you are with the PLUG booth but get a basic Expo
Registration if you have any issues with that. Once on-site, I can get
you correctly registered: 503-789-8978

Good point! Do invite them!

Stop by the Linux Fund booth for people as we will have some sense of
who is available.

Thanks!

Ahh, servers me right for not checking the bios settings. AMD Virtual 
Extensions were disabled.

CentOS install took 15 minutes.

Thanks Dwight.

Hi everyone,

Thanks for all of your constructive feedback! I've fixed all the 
detected errors, added the requested features, for now I'm sticking w/ 
links opening in the same window... if further discussion concludes that 
people disagree, i'd be willing to change it, but my feeling is that the 
website controls the layout, the user controls the behavior.

with regards to the history page, i agree it would be great if someone 
could volunteer additional information about landmark PLUG events and 
activities since 2002, but I'm not comfortable changing the wording in 
an article that bears anothers name.

note that while i feel this site is ready to launch, i do have some 
long-term, lower priority improvements in mind; one being cleaning up 
print-view, which i'm not perfectly satisfied with, by implementing an 
alternate stylesheet for printing.

i'll be heading down to OSCON tomorrow night for a meet and greet with 
whatever PLUG members are on hand and some folks from identi.ca, maybe 
whoever's there w/ some form of authority in the control of the domain 
can discuss our options for pushing this live, as well as the details of 
the previously mentioned move to OSU-OSL?

again, thanks for all your constructive feedback, the site looks great, 
you all had insightful comments and ideas for making it way better than 
before. :)

cheers,

nathan

I fully agree. David should have first shot at it. I expect we'll hear 
from him after the dust settles from OSCON.

Today at OSCON we had a lot of visitors to our booth. Quite a few were
local folks who already knew of us - fallen away members, as a Catholic
priest I once knew would have said. There were at least a dozen
comments regarding our pathetic website. If there is any way to roll
out the new site before tomorrow morning, even if a there are a still a
few rough edges, it would be great to be able to tell tomorrow's
visitors that we have a new website developed by a wonderful and
brilliant web designer.

But it's not a huge deal. If the rollout must wait I can still tell
them that a new website is imminent.

Newer versions of Ubuntu come with a `kvm-ok` command which tells you
capabilities and if proper modules are loaded.

As for the file vs. lvm debate, currently I'm using files.  This is mainly so I
can oversubscribe my file systems.  I have very fast drives, but not much space
(4x 15kRPM SAS6 146GB in RAID10).  By creating sparse files, partitioning them
such that inside the guest root is 4GB and 40GB is in an LVM VG, the file on the
host starts at 5GB or so and grows as needed.

Using qcow2 is also an option for this if compression is needed, but affects
performance.

I agree that maintenance on VM guest filesystems is much nicer with LVM, but to
get at the partitions on a guest I use losetup+kpartx:

# losetup /dev/loop0 /kvm/<fqdn>/disk0.raw
# kpartx -a /dev/loop0

Now all the partitions are under /dev/mapper, and I can even run fdisk on
/dev/loop0 if I need to. `kpartx -d /dev/loop0;losetup -d /dev/loop0` to back
out of things.

Jaunty is the oldest version of Ubuntu I would trust with KVM, preferably
Karmic.  I have some Hardy servers that like to panic guests if memory
utilization approaches max.  Hardy also has a bug that causes a crash when fsck
is run in a guest, requiring a manual fsck on the host of the guest filesystem.
 Annoying for ext2 auto-fscks, crashing on boot.  I will be testing Lucid soon.

I also recommend libvirt, which is how the kvm hosts are managed.

Subject: [PLUG] Missing guests in virsh
Message-ID: <4C48C8D4.10901@robertmarktech.com>

All,

When I list my guests in virsh I see:

dan at arrakis:/kvm/dan$ virsh -c qemu:///system list
  Id Name                 State
----------------------------------

Yet, in virt-manager I can see all three vm's running. Why does 
virt-manager have a completely different output than virsh? Does anyone 
know where virsh list command looks for registered guests?

I'm running virt-manager version 0.8.2 on Ubuntu 10.04. All three guests 
are using the kvm hypervisor. I cloned one with virt-manager and created 
the other two with virt-install.

thanks,

I *think* you need root privileges to run virsh. Have you tried 
running virsh under sudo or a root shell? If so, do you get a 
different output if you don't include the -c option?

No, been trying various ways, all to no avail:

dan at arrakis:/kvm/dan$ sudo virsh qemu:///system list
error: unknown command: 'qemu:///system'
dan at arrakis:/kvm/dan$ sudo virsh
Welcome to virsh, the virtualization interactive terminal.

Type:  'help' for help with commands
        'quit' to quit

virsh # list
  Id Name                 State
----------------------------------

virsh # connect qemu:///session

virsh # list
  Id Name                 State
----------------------------------

Weird thing is I can interract with them fine.

Stupid user error.

By default list only shows machines in some kind of running state. You 
need to use the --all on list if the images are shutdown. I just 
connected to the remote in virt-manager and saw all three machines were 
down.

Ah, yes.  I assume you were looking for hosts that were up, which is what is
listed by default. :)

Anyone know why if you put a bad zip disk into a zip atapi drive that
thereafter a device isn't created anymore for the zip drive?  How does
one fix this?

kernel 2.6.10 Slackware 10.0

While I'm on the subject, is there any way to get devfs to create
the appropriate devices even when the drive isn't loaded at boot 
time?  The same problem exists for the bernoulli drive.

Here's 2 good sites to get info on running Linux distros on specific
vendor/model hw:

Good luck w. your search! I'd be curious to hear what you find too...

Subject: [PLUG] Linksys PS2KVM4 problems...
Message-ID: <1279937913.2392.3.camel@localhost>

This is a 4 computer KVM device made by Linksys.

The first problem I ran into is that my manual switch used male to male
vga cables where this smart switch uses male to female.  Another problem
is that the extender cable I bought had standoffs that got in the way
and I had to literally rip them off with pliers, but as far as I can
tell the cable still works...

What I'm finding is that my Alpha running CentOS 4.3 can't detect the
monitor when it is going through this KVM switch.  The monitor is a 
Mitsubishi M55 LCD that can do 1024x768 max, but I've never been able
to get to that resolution on my Alpha.  My video card in the Alpha is
a Matrox Millenium II.

Anyone else run into trouble with X when using this switch?

I'll take a stab and guess that I understand exactly what you are 
saying, which actually I don't, but ...
    My experience with KVM's and Linux (and Windows for that matter) has 
suggested that if the monitor (and sometimes the mouse/touchpad) have 
been configured without the switch (and extra cable length) in between, 
it/they may need to be re-configured.  I have also found the to 
sometimes be true with just cable extensions (that is longer cables but 
without the KVM switch).  With KVM's, I hadn't noticed any difference 
between manual and sofware switches, as far as this particular problem 
is concerned.
    Hope that helps

Haven't used that specific switch but experience with KVM switches is that
they don't typically handle pass through the I2C communication from
the video card to the monitor
back.  The typical solution is to remove the KVM for resolution
configuration/detection and
then put the KVM back in place.

Sometimes if the video card thinks the monitor has changed when the
KVM is in place you will
have to manually configure the monitor selection based on the
auto-detected monitor when
KVM was out.

Subject: [PLUG] Advanced Topics location
Message-ID: <20100723210527.348b1b20@mailhost.pdx.edu>

<Copied to Nick of BrainSilo, in case he is not subscribed to the PLUG
lists.>

I spent Wednesday and Thursday at the PLUG booth at OSCON (more about
that later), and between the end of the Exhibit Hall and the Linux Fund
party I made a trip to BrainSilo. BrainSilo has been mentioned here as a
possible location for Advanced Topics, since the sudden closure of
Roots. During the Exhibit Hall our booth was visited by Nick, one of
the principals in BrainSilo. Nick had suggested that we would be welcome
there for our Advanced Topics meetings.

BrainSilo is a little difficult to find if you forget the instructions.
The address is 611 N. Tillamook, but the entrance is via the alley
behind the building. And note that it is N Tillamook, not NE Tillamook.
It is eight blocks from the Albina/Mississippi stop on the Max Yellow
line, and about ten blocks from Widmer Brothers Brewery, just off
Interstate Avenue. It is also served by the #35 bus. Tillamook is the
third street north of Broadway. And lest you be worried about the
neighborhood, it is an industrial area; I saw no evidence of crime.
After 5:00 there is street parking aplenty. 

For details as to what BrainSilo is all about, here is the link to
BrainSilo's web page:

http://brainsilo.org/wiki/Main_Page

When I arrived I found the place populated by about ten hackers of
various ages. Some (including Nick) were tearing hardware apart or
putting it back together. There were soldering irons. Others were intent
on their laptops, presumably coding. Several were just shooting the
breeze. As a new face I was immediately the center of scrutiny. But
Nick introduced me, and a few of the others recognized me from having
seen me at OSCON. After introductions the breeze-shooters gave me a
tour. The main floor is a small area, so it took less than sixty
seconds. But then I was invited to see the basement. 

The basement has limited headroom, is dank, claustrophobic, dimly lit,
and there are probably spiders, or worse. The basement did have
one interesting feature: The Pit. It is the size of an elevator shaft,
and goes down into the ground too far to see the bottom. As if I was
going to get close enough to the edge to peer down anyway. I suggested
they acquire a pendulum, and perhaps a raven. The square area of the
basement is large, but for the aforementioned reasons, it is not
recommended as a meeting venue. 

Back upstairs I took closer inventory of the facilities. There are
about 15-20 chairs. Nick knows of a place where one can get folding
chairs for $2.50, so perhaps one of us could make a modest contribution
to get the number up to our needs. I figured that we could arrange the
chairs to seat 20-25 people. Of that, about half would be at a
desk/table, the remainder would have to hold their computers and notes
in their laps.

Square in the middle of the area there is a big-ass post. I didn't
measure it but, if memory serves, it was about 12" by 12", and solid
heartwood as was available early in the last century. About five or six
feet from the floor was a small platform. Nick told me that the
purpose of the platform was to hold a projector, and that BrainSilo had
a projector that worked on the platform. The projector faces a wall
that is currently painted pale yellow. I suggested to Nick that
repainting a screen-size area on the wall with white paint would be a
good idea. He said that the yellow actually worked better than it
sounded, but that if someone wanted to paint a screen area white it
would be fine. He suggested glass-bead paint. I have not heard of such,
but enough to paint a screen area on the wall couldn't cost too much.

Looking at the denizens of BrainSilo at the time I was there (roughly
7:30 pm), I expressed to Nick my concern about conflicts between our
Advanced Topics meetings and the needs of their regular users. Nick
informed me that the policy of BrainSilo is that user groups have
priority. If other users need to use the space they need to go to
another area or stay home or something. In our case that should create
little problem, as our meeting times can be announced there to give
other users plenty of advance notice. And if one of them wanders in
during our meeting, they are welcome to sit in.

A negative feature of BrainSilo for us is that it is not a
tavern/restaurant. We are accustomed to being able to order drinks and
food during Advanced Topics. On the other hand, considering issues we
sometimes have with food and beverage establishments, perhaps that is a
blessing in disguise. Nick told me there is a pizza establishment
nearby (which I did not check out). We are also welcome to bring a keg
or six-packs or whatever we want. I'd recommend ordering a few large
pizzas of various varieties, and each of us bring some libations. We
could leave the unused portions for the hackers to use the next day. In
my experience hackers will eat pizza several days old, and beer forever.
BrainSilo does have a coffee pot and mini-fridge, in case we need to
use them.

Having seen the place my recommendation is that we make arrangements to
hold our August meeting there as a mutual experiment between PLUG and
BrainSilo to see if it works out to our mutual advantage.

I also recommend that other PLUGGERS visit BrainSilo if you are in the
area and have a few minutes.

Subject: [PLUG] Awesome OSCON
Message-ID: <20100723224629.23f78adb@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I spent Wednesday and Thursday manning the PLUG booth at OSCON, and
had a wonderful, exhilarating and fulfilling experience.

First, some really good news. According to a story in the Thursday
Oregonian, O'Reilly has committed to hold OSCON in Portland through
2013. As those who follow such things know, OSCON was always held in
Portland, but last year O'Reilly moved it to San Jose. It was sorely
missed by those of us in the Portland area open source community. But
apparently O'Reilly has realized where they are appreciated. I should
also add that O'Reilly makes money from book sales (even more these
days from e-book sales), but also makes money from conventions. We
are more profitable than San Jose! Yay for us!

Although it was the most last-minute of last-minute enterprises, we
pulled off the PLUG booth, and none of the Exhibit Hall participants
realized we barely made it. 

Lots of PLUGGERs stopped by, and it was fun to see the familiar faces.
But some were unfamiliar, having not participated in a while. Hopefully
they will get back with us.

We also had visitors from other PLUGs - Philadelphia and Phoenix,
specifically. Lots of hilarity as we compared notes about how many
PLUGs there are.

We also had a lot of people who participate in other user groups. Many
were curious why we were so successful, when their own user groups were
languishing. I offered what advice I could. On at least half a dozen
occasions participants in other user groups were very taken with our
Clinic and intended to take the idea home. This included one person
from India and another from Peru. Spreading ideas is one of the joyous
things about OSCON.

But the most important thing our booth accomplished was offering help
to local people who had not heard of us. Often people would ask me for
technical help. Usually I had no idea of the answer, but I could
certainly steer them to this list. Or I could refer them to the Clinic.
In fact, the most common expression was "my <relative> lives in <a
Portland neighborhood> and wants to get away from Windows." Hopefully a
lot of these will be showing up at the Clinic.

I personally benefited from lots of free coffee, food and beer. I also
scored a couple of cool t-shirts, a cap, a USB stick, a couple of
books, numerous CDs and miscellaneous other swags. But the best benefit
was meeting a lot of other open source people from all over the world.
For next year be sure to put OSCON on your calendar.

In June 2009, I was looking for laptops.  I found what I needed
during the fall of 2009, but somehow that message resurfaced on
the list.

BTW, I bought 2 thinkpad T60s, and replaced the screens with
2048x1536 LCDs.  Main issue so far is poorly designed apps
and web pages that force a tiny font size.  Most recent example
is the OSCON program grid.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikRD2dNDrt3=xB5=9J7t3j+SeY5Bu2E4fVEM6LF@mail.gmail.com>

I reported here some time ago random failures to complete starting of my
Ubuntu 10.04 system.  Power off and power on usually results in what looks
like a normal start.  Three time now Cups has failed to start on boot.  I
have found an interesting discussion of the Cups problem.  See
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/554172.    Of
particular interest is comment #73 and subsequent.  It seems very likely
that both intermittent  problems I have observed (and perhaps some I have
not observed!) are of the same origin.

One question I have is, where to go from here?  The cups issue was first
mentioned in April; the last comment was hours ago.  It has been marked
"Critical" for one month.  Are there other places to look for a fix?  May I
assume that the problem is deep down in the system, and an update will be
forthcoming "real soon now"?  I note a bunch of workarounds reported, but
not understanding them makes me concerned that they may break something
worse.

I want to view an old out-of-copyright movie. The only place I can find

After much googling and reading of what passes for instructions, I
managed to get aMule installed (the easy part), and learned a few

I have managed to get aMule to find the file, but I have "low ID" and
the download rate is zero. Reading the aMule wiki leads me to suspect
that the problem is my router. However, I have no problem with
downloading anything else through the same router. That is, Firefox,
Ktorrent, ftp, and everything else downloads at sometimes over 3 MB/s
(I have good bandwidth). 

I know the IP address of the router is 192.168.0.1. Otherwise I know
little. After hours of struggling to figure it out, I could use a quick
primer on how to get aMule to work with it.

It's most likely because the file is no longer being hosted / seeding. I'd
suggest looking elsewhere for your movie.

I am not too much of an expert here, but here are goes.
Getting aMule to work well with your router means opening up the correct
ports in the Firewall so not only can you download, but others can connect
and upload from you. aMule can do this automagically if aMule and the router
are configured correctly.
In aMule  go to Preferences -> Connection and check Enable UPnP. Then go to
the router and enable UPnP..  (this is router dependent and some routers
don't support it). The router might already be so enabled so you can try
skipping the router configuration.  Now test by restarting aMule and see if
the low-id message disappears.

If you want to do this manually go to the same place in aMule and right down
which two ports it is using and go back to the router and open those ports.

I have decided to give up. My router is working perfectly for
everything except aMule, so I don't want to mess with it. Besides I
can't find the instruction sheet that came with it and I can't remember
how to log in to it. I did set aMule to UPnP, but it made no difference.

I also suspect that Daniel is correct. Although aMule reports that I
have Low ID, it does connect to the server. Yet I get zero bytes down.
Therefore chances are that the file no longer exists on the eDonkey
server. Or wherever such files are kept. 

It is unfortunate only for the movie Gold (Karl Hartl, 1934), a Nazi
science fiction film. Apparently the only place it exist(s)(ed) is the
eDonkey link. Amazon has never heard of it and I can't find a copy for
sale or download anyplace else. But I am sure my life will continue if
I never get to see the movie.

Subject: [PLUG] Trouble updating kernel...
Message-ID: <20100726031040.n9ofhwmw0k0848ks@web.robinson-west.com>

I'm on a Slackware 10.1 system that currently runs a 2.6.10 kernel.

I got a 2.6.27 kernel to boot by replacing the init scripts with the ones
from Slackware 13.  The problems encountered doing that are numerous though.

I found something called slackpkg googling online, but it doesn't appear
to allow upgrading from one release of Slackware to another.

I updated pkgtool to slackware 13's pkgtool, didn't seem to break anything.
I then added xz only to find that xz doesn't work without glibc-2.6 which
appears to be in xz compressed format!  I haven't applied slackware 13's
tar or gzip yet.

There has to be a standard pain free way to upgrade glibc and udev to get
around the bug that I'm fighting.

Short of tearing into the computer so I can set up cd booting again, and
there's the trouble of finding a slackware 13 cd, I only have a floppy
drive to work with at boot time.

I got the 2.6.27 kernel I compiled to boot, but that is about all I  
got it to do.  The framebuffer was limited to 640x480 resolution and  
the network cards,
a netgear fa311 and a Alvarion PC DS-11.b in a PLX adapter, didn't work.

I am not allowing this computer to have Internet access, so slackpkg  
may not be all that useful.

How can I get a base Slackware 13 install with just a floppy disk and possibly
some packages on a zip disk or a cdrom?  I don't have a DVD drive in  
the computer where booting from CD requires going into the case and  
turning the onboard controller back on.  I use a promise 20267 instead  
of the Asus P5A-B's builtin parallel ata controllers.  I have  
Slackware 13 on an ftp server, but I need a live cd or something  
similar to boot up in Slackware 13 and launch the
setup program.

As far as I know you're going to need an initrd in order to use your
network peripherals in a hacked together 13 install. Why not just
build the kernel from source from kernel.org ?

You can PXE boot newer version of Slack if the NIC supports it.

Dear Denis,

When I've had similar problems, and did not want to get into the
internals, my workaround has been to use the /etc/rc.local file. You
should be able to include additional commands in that file -- which are
run after the services in the default runlevel are started. In this
case, that's the services in the /etc/rc.2/ directory.

In your case, I'd try including the following command in the
noted /etc/rc.local file, before the "exit 0"

/etc/init.d/cups start

The /etc/rc.local file is sort of like a band-aid; once the bug is
fixed, you'll be able to remove the /etc/init.d/cups start command from
the noted file.

FWIW, CUPS is ok on my My e1405 laptop with 10.04 32-bit. 

Thanks,
Mike

That is certainly reasonable.  Cups' failure to start has happened rarely
enough that manual invocation of  /etc/init.d/cups start is easy enough.  On
your system, you might want to check on what runlevel reports on your
system.  When cups fails to start runlevel reports "unknown".  This bug may
well be affecting more than one or two services.  It would be interesting to
see if on some systems runlevel reports "unknown" even when no other
symptoms are observed.  Since I use the printer only occasionally, there may
be many times the error goes unnoticed on my system.  The real issue for me
is that this bug is likely responsible for my system failing to start (
approx. a 20% failure rate).

Denis,

I've been running 10.04 on my laptop since end of last week. I'm only 
rebooting once every 2-3 days though. I'm not seeing any system start up 
failures on a Dell XPS M1330.

Can you force the start up output rather to screen rather than going 
into the ubuntu splash? I've never tried on ubuntu, but I know in RH and 
CentOS you can hit f2 or something to get the boot output. You might be 
able to catch where the hang is.

I couldn't quite get it to work, but you may have better luck.  It has the
movie available to watch online for free, it was wanting me to install the
windows version of vlc for some reason (I have the linux version installed)
I didn't try much beyond locating it.

There seems to be quite a few references via Google,  Here is the search
terms I used.

Thanks for the link. I couldn't get it to work either. But I think it's
because Firefox is looking for a VLC plugin. I have an mplayer plugin,
but I don't even know if there exists a VLC plugin for Firefox. Then
again, I tried it in Konqueror, which announced that it couldn't play
it because I needed Flash 9. (Never bothered to get Flash working in
Konqueror, as I use Firefox 99% of the time.) Then I tried Opera, which
gave me the same error messages as Firefox.

I'll poke at it some more. Maybe there is a way to get the link to
download the file.

Message-ID: <1280238757.6122.9.camel@linux-nxy3.site>


I have Grub on a multi-boot system that refuses to boot Fedora 13.
I installed Fedora 13 and created a menu for Windows, openSuse 11.3
and Fedora 13. When  the system attempted to read the MBR it came back
with a Read error. 
I then revereted back to the old MBR using dd. I added the
instructions for booting Fedora 13 and receive a error 25 or error 17.

I have checked to make sure that all the files exist in hd1,1
but still Fedora won't boot with this grub menu.

Here is my Grub Menu.lst file used with opensuse:

Keith - Can you recall where you got the displays?  I've been thinking of
upgrading the resolution of the 12" panel on my X31.

   Xfig and PSTricks. The latter has entity-relationship shapes that are
useful. A few years ago I used an add-on to eclipse, but I forget the name
of that tool. There are also some that will generate SQL from the image, but
I never got those working well.

"dia" is also nice for some diagrams, but I don't remember if it has
the right little arrows and such for relational diagrams...

Graphviz is the classic tool for this purpose. Note I did not say "best" or
"worst". But when I was tasked with creating a UML-looking thing, I had
graphviz figured out and working for me in a hurry.

Thanks!  I happened to find pgdesigner 
<http://pgdesigner.sourceforge.net/en/index.html> and will give that a 
shot, since I'm using postgres for now.

I'm using graphviz on the backend of sqlt-diagram 
<http://sqlfairy.sourceforge.net/>.  It generates awesome diagrams, but 
I don't see a way to use graphviz interactively to design a schema.

I totally forgot about Dia!  If pgdesigner doesn't work out I'll try 
that next.

I also found this link, which is helpful:

If this is on the same hard drive as the others, I think you need to 
change the (hd1,1) to (hd0,1).

Subject: [PLUG] duplicate files
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=3on-di7PU00OmN3=7nw31r09JM8AHdthR_EGu@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

A project on my list at home is consolidation of unorganized backups
smeared across a bunch of ide hdds.  Partions are ext2, ext3, vfat,
reiser, etc ... No backups are incremental, so there are lots of
duplicates.  I was thinking of indexing the files using their md5sums,
consolidating the list, then coping the list files to a single new
hdd, then verifying the copy using the md5sum.  Any comments?  Any
suggestions on the choice of target filesystem?  The larger issue
issue is a few hundred cd and dvd backups, but for now, getting rid of
the stack of old hdds would be good.

Graphviz if you want to say what you mean and Dia if you want to mean

I know this is a Linux list, that's why I can talk about Windows 7  
getting in the way of installing Linux on an Asus Eee PC with a 1.6  
Ghz atom processor, 1 gig of ram, 250 GB hard drive, web camera built  
in, 14 hour battery life, and well that probably about covers it.   
This is the one that costs about $379.

No media disks provided.  I'm having the store inquire about getting them.
My dad's HP laptop has the same problem I found out.  If I have to back up
this Windows 7 system using Linux, can I do better than dd'ing the whole
entire drive?  I want to dual boot, the hard drive should be big enough.
The trouble is, how do I reinstall the boot loader without installation
media?  Do I need to dd copy the first four megs of the drive?  Do I copy
certain files off under Linux?  The gentoo based system on CD that I have
doesn't boot correctly on this machine, so I can't use a resizing tool :-(

I wonder if NTFS-3g which I have a full implementation of now is good enough?
I'm about ready to suggest buying another hard drive and popping the Windows 7
drive out in case the computer has to be taken in for servicing.

Is there a reason you aren't considering running Linux in a VM?
I have Ubuntu and Fedora 13 both loaded in SunVB VMs..they work fine.

BTW, is this a new machine preloaded with Win7? If so there should be a
utility to create your Win7 OS and Driver Disks. Most machines don't come
with the media anymore..you have to create your disks, and/or there is
usually a special system restore partition on the new systems as well.

Maybe look for a free usb/cd bootable imaging tool? I posted a FOSS
one awhile back. As was already mentioned most new laptops and
desktops have a hidden partition that is used for system restore.

That said,

You can look at Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Computer
Management -> Disk Management and it'll show up there usually.

Cheers,

Is there a reason why the 2nd partition is reported by Windows 7 to have
no files whatsoever on it?  I'm trying the Microsoft backup tool, don't
know how long it will take though.  I wonder if there is a 30 gig  
hidden partition???  I don't think hidden partitions have been  
possible though
since Windows XP came out.

Doesn't look like there is any way to create the installation disks.

First off, I hate this.  I want and deserve media.  For that matter,
there are 9 gigabyte USB flash drives now.  Providing a boot able
flash drive with Windows 7 installer on it shouldn't be a problem.

Another gripe of mine, it seems that Microsoft is dumping Windows 7
starter so that people won't go the Linux route or any other route
for that matter.

An Atom processor is a bit on the low end to be running Linux under emulation.
I foresee my nephew using Linux most of the time and not going to Windows 7
unless he has to for some reason.

Putting the installer on the hard drive is reckless and dangerous.  There is
less than the advertised amount of space, far less.  Second off, hard drives
die much faster than memory sticks and DVDs.  Third, if the computer  
ships with a bad hard drive, there is the issue of having nothing to  
install from.  There is a transferability issue should one decide that  
they need Windows 7 on another computer even if they intend to take it  
off of their laptop completely.

   What is the command for a user to install a downloaded .deb package? I

   OK. Got it. 'sudo dpkg -i <filename>.deb'

On the CLI the command would be

sudo dpkg -i file.deb

If you are downloading the package using a browser, the gdebi program
will usually take care of it for you.

OK, first off I know some linux users hate Microsoft and Bill Gates...at
least that is the general impression I've had and you appear to be one of
them and I'm not judging you for that. This isn't the forum for that
discussion. 

I've been supporting users both retail and corporate for years...since the
days of CPM. My bottom line is if you don't like what you bought take it
back and for your replacement purchase make sure you know whether it comes
with the OS/Drivers media and how to do a system restore and also whether
the manufacturer supports linux in any way (drivers, OS, etc.).

BTW..ASUS does sell different models of the Eee PC with GNU linux instead of
Windows.

Win-7 for all its faults does have one thing going for it.
It's really easy to resize the partition and create additional ones for
loading Linux.
Win-7 has it's own built in partioning tool.
I used it to repartition the disk on my laptop and load Ubuntu.
Ubuntu correctly identified the Win-7 partition and set up grub as the
bootloader.
It was quite painless.

I know this is a Linux list, that's why I can talk about Windows 7

Ghz atom processor, 1 gig of ram, 250 GB hard drive, web camera built

This is the one that costs about $379.

No media disks provided.  I'm having the store inquire about getting them.
My dad's HP laptop has the same problem I found out.  If I have to back up
this Windows 7 system using Linux, can I do better than dd'ing the whole
entire drive?  I want to dual boot, the hard drive should be big enough.
The trouble is, how do I reinstall the boot loader without installation
media?  Do I need to dd copy the first four megs of the drive?  Do I copy
certain files off under Linux?  The gentoo based system on CD that I have
doesn't boot correctly on this machine, so I can't use a resizing tool :-(

I wonder if NTFS-3g which I have a full implementation of now is good
enough?
I'm about ready to suggest buying another hard drive and popping the Windows
7
drive out in case the computer has to be taken in for servicing.

First off, I never said I hated Windows 7.  I said I hate not getting
media for a copy of Windows I've paid for let alone a way to restore
the system from an off the hard drive source.  Second off, Preheim
computers does not offer Linux pre-installed on an Asus Eee anymore 
and Asus apparently doesn't either anymore for their laptops.  Third
complaint, it is extremely hard to remove and/or replace the hard drive
which is probably a proprietary size wise and buried inside the laptop
case.  If I could remove the hard drive safely, that would be the backup
in case the laptop needs to go into the shop for a hardware problem.
Fourth problem, Microsoft's backup program didn't write any readable
DVD's when I tried to image the system with it.  What's the point of a
backup program that doesn't work?

According to the receipt, the model is Asus Eee PC 1005PE.

I'm waiting for my folks so I can set up Linux on my network server to
brute force back this thing up.  I actually can network boot Linux and
image a drive.  I also have NTFS-3g fully fleshed out.  Looks like I 
just need to steal the D drive for Linux.  Thanks Drew.

Michael,
Here is a link to a support forum with posts regarding creating recovery
media for your Asus. Apparently there are a lot of unhappy users regarding
the poor documentation regarding recovery and I don't blame them!

It's often a good idea to use "--simulate" prior to actually installing it.

I abandoned pgdesigner because it's _too_ precise, forcing me to make 
decisions I don't (yet) want to make.  Dia is working well.  I intend to 
try out Parse::Dia::SQL <http://search.cpan.org/dist/Parse-Dia-SQL/> 
just for kicks.

Glen,

   These are font files and unlikely to cause operational problems.

Thanks,

Is the source for this network card in the kernel 2.6.32 source tree or
do I need to grab source code?  Where can I grab it from?

I've used findup and fslint to consolidate duplicate files like that.  They
basically automate the process you descriubed.  It's a sloooow process.

If you want to just get a server up quick, I'd recommend Ext3, which can be
upgraded to Ext4 or Btrfs.  If you want an adventure, build a NAS using ZFS
(on freeNAS, BSD 8 or Nexenta), which can do deduplication without all the
hard-linking.

Offers a driver for linux, but it is module only.  I need to statically
support the network card for PXE booting.  The GPL is being seriously
abused by Atheros.  You are forced to go through the typical you can't
reverse engineer this driver, etcetera, BS.  When you get the source
extracted, there is a copying file that says that the driver is under
the GPL version 2.  If no part of the driver is proprietary, and none of
it should be if the license is the GPL, then someone should fix the
driver so that you can patch the kernel and statically support the
network card.  Someone should blow the whistle on Atheros, the GPL does
not allow limitations on redistribution and reverse engineering.  The
company is idiotic making network cards that noone knows how to support.
Opening up your design to the open source community increases demand for
it.

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu 10.1.0 livecd problems...
Message-ID: <1280464870.28069.6.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I'm trying to use the Ubuntu 10.1.0 live cd to boot and back up an Asus
Eee PC model 1005, the same one I mentioned before.  I am selecting try
it out followed by opening a terminal and doing sudo passwd root.  I set
the password to simple.  I then do an su - command.  I do aptitude
install portmap nfs-client.  That seems to work.  I mount the remote
backup space, seems to work.  The minute I try to dd from the local
sda hard disk to the network share, I see a minute amount of data
transfer and then data transfer ceases.  Anyone know what the 
problem is?  I notice problems on the laptop (client) end.

I'm going to try upgrading my network root Linux system from the
2.6.30.2 kernel to the 2.6.34 kernel.  The problem has been being
unable to compile in the correct atheros driver for the onboard
network card, an AR8132 pci express card.

Please do not use Ext3 it is very slow compared to Reiser or XFS.  XFS 
is the fastest for large files Reiser will handle lots of small files, 
both are about 3X faster than Ext3.  I did the same md5sum and Perl 
script approach which worked reasonably well, I may try fslint next.

FreeBSD 8.0 and 8.1 version of ZFS does not yet have dedup (zfs v13 and
v14 respectively).  It might be in -CURRENT, but that's a different can
of worms.
