About two months ago, I built a superquiet high-efficiency midtower
system for my wife to use for speech recognition dictation.  We
used an Antec Sonata III midtower case, which contains an Antec
EarthWatt 500W high efficiency supply, big/slow fans, side panels
with acoustic dampening, vibration-dampening drive straps, etc.
Quiet enough to hear the CPU fan inside (which we replaced with
a quieter one).  Downsides:  the power light is a bright blinking
blue circle, distracting at night, and the feet come off too easy,
should have rollers.

These cases are on sale at Frys Weds/Thurs for $100.  Suggested for
green/quiet desktop systems.

Black duct tape works wonders. Without it I used to wake up in the
middle of the night and think it was dawn.

Blinds or drapes probably do work better then Windows, and I can't

Subject: [PLUG] Firefox 3.5 x86_64 amd - which java?
Message-ID: <20090702023838.GB24287@gate.kl-ic.com>

Anybody running firefox 3.5 x86_64 on amd, with java?


I'm running 2.6.18-8.1.6.el5 x86_64 on an AMD box. 
I just installed Firefox 3.5:

   Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64);
   en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.5

And now I am rebuilding plugins (from scratch).  I downloaded
a new Sun java and installed it:

java -version
   java version "1.6.0_14"
   Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_14-b08)
   Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 14.0-b16, mixed mode)

And tried doing the usual symlink from /opt/firefox/plugins:

  ln /usr/java/jre1.6.0_14/lib/amd64/libjavaplugin_jni.so \
  libjavaplugin_jni.so 

(well, not usual, I am used to libjavaplugin_oji.so, but that
 seemed close...)

When I ran firefox from the command line, it started but showed no
plugins on the about:plugins line.  It threw an error to the shell:

   LoadPlugin: failed to initialize shared library 
   /usr/java/jre1.6.0_14/lib/amd64/libjavaplugin_jni.so
   [/usr/java/jre1.6.0_14/lib/amd64/libjavaplugin_jni.so:
    wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64]


I next tried a different symlink suggested by another site:

   libnpjp2.so -> /usr/java/jre1.6.0_14/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so

which resulted in:

   LoadPlugin: failed to initialize shared library
   /usr/java/jre1.6.0_14/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so
   [/usr/java/jre1.6.0_14/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so:
    wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64]

Well, there are another 30 .so 's in that directory, I'm not trying
all of them.

Does anybody know what that error means?  Low class elves?

Has anyone got Firefox 3.5 and Java working with x86_84 ?

I have had experience with that error message in the past. It means
that something is 32-bit and you are trying to run it on a 64-bit OS.
Typically the error can be eliminated by installing some 32-bit library
that whatever is complaining thinks it needs.

> Has anyone got Firefox 3.5 and Java working with x86_84 ?

I noticed the other day that it was released. But my FF 3.0.11 on
Jaunty x86_64 seems to do everything I want it to do. Unless 3.5 can
get me more sex, I'll wait until 3.5 is in the Ubuntu repos.

ELF is a format for binary executable files.  It seems like your
firefox is balking at a 64 bit binary.  Maybe your firefox is 32 bit.

I found the problem.  One would think that means x86_64 version...
no, the only Linux version of Firefox is 32 bits.  I found this
out because the firefox 3.5 that was automagically provided for
download works on a different system that is 32 bits.  

So given 32 bit firefox, I installed 32 bit java and 32 bit flash. 
All that processing power wasted ... sigh.

And while I can download source and compile 64 bit firefox, that
will probably break a lot of the plugins.

   I would like help from someone who has experience with configuring
logwatch's postfix log reporting. I've read the docs and know where
postfix.conf is located, but I cannot identify the appropriate feature to
prevent reporting of one type of log entry.

   There is a portion of the logwatch postfix section containing a few
hundred lines of unmatched entries, dropped connections, and similar events.
I have no interest in seeing this each day, but the 'communications' key in
postfix.conf is either not the correct one or I have not identified the
appropriate value for it.

   We can do this off the list if preferred.

Thanks in advance,

Rich

if you are a firebug user, you'll probably hate 3.5 anyway.  i did a quick 
test and performance was abysmal.  you have to use a beta version of 
firebug, which may be part of the problem.

Message-ID: <5f6af5080907020721l2abfe29euab818017b1efc44@mail.gmail.com>

All,

This is somewhat frustrating. I'm trying to setup Thunderbird to connect to
gmail to pull down my messages. I'm attempting to do it through IMAP. I
followed the instructions from here:
http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=77662

Only problem is I get a timeout to imap.gmail.com. Every time. I can ping
imap.gmail.com without problems. I can telnet to port 993, It doesn't appear
to be network issues.

I created an imap log file from following these instructions:
http://www-archive.mozilla.org/quality/mailnews/mail-troubleshoot.html#imap

but the file is zero bytes. Wireshark shows the packets going across, and
there aren't any errors. It seems there is some kind of problme with
thunderbird.

Anybody see any problems connecting thunderbird to imap under ubuntu?
Anybody have suggestions on where to go next?

thanks,

here is how to test ssl connections:

create a file with the following contents:

client = yes
output = /dev/tty
connect = imap.gmail.com:imaps

then run:
stunnel NAME-OF-FILE

you should see a standard imap header come back.  if not, then you have 
something interfering with the imaps traffic.  i can get a connection from 
my system using the above technique.

Joe,

Thanks. Chalk it up to SUE (Stupid User Error). I was hitting the TLS button
instead of SSL.

and for those not knowing the difference between those acronyms:

SSL - secure sockets layer

this is a mechanism where the end systems negotiate an encrypted 
connection automatically before any user data is transmitted.  if you 
telnet to an ssl port, you won't see any data because the far end is 
expecting the beginning of an encryption handshake to exchange keys and 
other magic.

TLS - transport layer security

this is almost the same as ssl, but it has an extra dimension for mail 
(and probably other) clients.  tls does the same kind of encryption 
handshake with slightly different (better, stronger, probably not faster) 
magic.  but it also implies that tls can be invoked after a regular 
non-encrypted session has been started.  so you can connect to the 
non-encrypted port (smtp, imap, pop3) and then after you get the 
appropriate banner, but before you send any sensitive info, you can send a 
command that will start a tls session.  for smtp/imap it is starttls, for 
pop3 is it stls.

and just to confuse things, if you use the ssl setting, it will almost 
certainly really be a tls encryption that you get.  all that happens is 
that there is an implied start tls command prior to any data transfer.

so, you have to use the correct setting based on which port you're 
connecting to.  tls expects clear text and will send that start command, 
ssl expects an immediate tls/ssl handshake.

smtp 25, smtps 265
pop3 110, pop3s 995
imap 143, imaps 993

Yeah, it's pretty sad.  For several years, Sun was stubbornly refusing
to release a 64bit version of the browser plugin with their 64 bit
JRE, so many users switched back to 32bit FF on 64bit systems.  There
may have been other plugins with the same lameness, but I think all of
the 32/64 confusion with FF can be primarily blamed on Sun.  I hope
the OpenJDK becomes mainstream on most distros soon.

centos 5 now has openjdk, but there isn't a ff plugin to use it (that i 
have been able to figure out).  do you know how to make that work?

My 64 bit java of choice is icedtea6, which contains a browser plugin
called IcedTeaPlugin.so.  Is icedtea6 the same as openjdk?  Possibly,
I don't know.

FWIW, Fedora 11  x86_64 works great with IcedTea. I also ran this of Fedora
10 without issue. IcedTea is really just a wrapper for OpenJDK. Slightly off
this topic, the flash plugin for 64bit works really well too.

Proof from my about:plugins page
The IcedTea Java Web Browser Plugin 1.4.1 (fedora-20.b14.fc11-x86_64)

Antec also sells direct through their website including "refurbished" cases
that allegedly have some defect.  I have three and all were perfect to my
eyes.

Good and quiet in the computer area now also.

Message-ID: <20090702194914.GA8598@gate.kl-ic.com>


I'm bringing two short topics for the general meeting tonight
- my WYDIWYS webslide composer ( http://serversky.com/wydiwys )
and some finish-up work on DKIM - Domain Keys Identified Mail. 
( http://www.topdog.za.net/postfix_dkim_milter looks useful,
see also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DKIM ).

I will go into full design detail about WYDIWYS at advanced
topics later this month, unless Alan finds a better speaker.

DKIM is a mail identification method demanded by Yahoo and some
other mail recipients.  I've got too many headstrong relatives
and customers on yahoo, so I get to add this to my email, sigh.

If Wes shows up, we will get DKIM going on my mail server, and
work with others to accomplish the same, as an "off to the side"
activity.  The tools I plan to use are postfix, dkim-milter,
and a mail account on yahoo to see if it works.   I've already
added the public keys to my DNS records (TXT files generated by
dkim-genkey.sh ) and I'm told that new DNS records propagate
rapidly ( then get cached, so updating is slow, so get it right
the first time, kiddies!), so the rest of the participants
might be able to get this done in the time available tonight.

I'm unfortunately going to miss tonight's meeting...

I found it a little odd that your writeup describes DKIM as "demanded"
by Yahoo. They may (or may not...) be using it to adjust their spam
filters and greylisting, but they definitely don't require DKIM
signatures on incoming mail...

Jumping through delivery hoops is a hassle these days, but we're not
yet to the point that we're forced to use DKIM.

Domain Key signed email is pretty essential if you are a bulk mailer. They
do adjust their spam filters very quickly to defer any sort of bulk mailing
that does not have a proper reputation. Signed emails is the only way I know
of to ensure Yahoo recognizes your mailing reputation. I don't think they
simply check your reverse dns any more.

I agree with this, but bulk delivery (marketing) is much different
than the volume that people send for personal or even small business
use. Even for bulk mailers we're often talking deferrals
(greylisting), and not rejections. I disagree that DKIM is going to
significantly impact the delivery of Keith's messages, which he's
described as "customers and family".

As far as volume is concerned, absolutely. There is a large difference
between sending a couple hundred or even thousand messages a day, and
sending hundreds of thousands of messages or higher.  IMHO, proper dns setup
for the sending server needs to be in place before the worth of DKIM can be
considered. I am not familiar with the setup in question, so I really can't
comment more.

Being currently unemployed like most of PDX, I'm volunteering at a
place called Rosehaven - http://www.rosehaven.org - and besides having
the grand chance to randomly sit and knit and crochet with some cool
ladies, there's a project that I'd like to do for them that would be a
benefit for me and my resume. I've been a support monkey for a long
time and haven't learned much more than the very basics needed to know
if something isn't working correctly in a database. I feel like I'm
not getting as many hits on the resume as I could be and if I knew SQL
and such better it'd help since most of the support jobs seem to want
that, and I'd like to go into QA eventually.

Mostly for my own education, I want to set up a database that would
track names, addresses, contact numbers and email addresses, and hours
worked monthly and be able to pull it into a report every quarter,
plus be easier to keep updated than their current paper system. I know
you can do this all on a spreadsheet and I'll likely draft it that
way, what I'm curious about is which tools would be good for this as a
relational database?  I'd say they have between 100-200 active people
that would be in it with summer kids and practicum students and such
included. I'm not interested yet in making it into a login-type
tracking system because I think that would be too much for them to try
to maintain, but something that the sign-in sheets would be imputed
into at the end of the day or the week. I don't want to reinvent the
wheel, but I do want to try to learn how to set this up by myself.
Thanks.

The queries needed for this type of application would not be difficult at
all. Depending on how you plan to have your interface you may choose
different levels of normalization (ie do you roll up the contact info into
one table or not). As far as your interface to this database, I have read
about using 0penOffice Base to interface with Postgres. That might be an
easy path to success. Otherwise, you can roll out a quick webform that does
a lot of what you need.

Amy,

This depends on how much work you want to put into it....A front-end
application plus database?

That said....there is a VERY active PostgreSQL users group in town (full
disclosure - yes, I'm a member as well) that can help you with some of
this.

The database design sounds very simple on the initial pass at
requirements.  Designing a postgresql (or any other database) would be
fairly simple to implement (and manage).

  - Daily backups.
  - A few indices (indexes)
  - A good tool (like pgAdmin or phpMyAdmin) to manage if it's PostgreSQL
(and the other database engines have their tools as well)

Come by and brainstorm with some of the people at the meeting.  But any
database (from SQLLite to PostgreSQL) will handle THESE requirements.

If your goal is to learn databases - pick a good one to learn with so you
learn the right way to do things off the bat (and don't pick up bad
habits).  If your goal is to solve the problem (the sign-in sheet)
something other than Postgre may better suit your needs.

Portland PostgreSQL group:  http://pugs.postgresql.org/pdx

And if you're at the meeting tonight, you can ask me there or on this list
(or off list if you'd prefer)...

They're using Joomla for their website which might have some of that
already, but the volunteer coordinator haaaaaaates it. Or at least is
extremely unfond of it, anyway. :D  My thought was to have the name be
one field, address be another, phone number, email, possibly if it
lets me have an extra for other contacts, but that starts getting to
be a pain. This is kinda of why I never wanted to learn, I think of
too MANY cases instead of not enough. -_-

Thanks. :)

Since this is a linux group (and you won't find me on any Microsoft
groups), I am compelled to suggest postgresql as the database engine.
It is the hands-down winner among the free open source options.  It's
getting darn near as powerful as Oracle, at least from a programmer's
standpoint.  I'm not competent to speak of DBA concerns.

A database engine like postgresql is just a database - no user
interface apart from the psql shell.  Some sort of external front end
must be created.  The front end gathers data from users in a human
friendly format, and then uses that data to construct SQL statements,
and connects to the database in order to issue these statements.

The back end: it isn't too tough to get postgresql up and running on a
linux box, and to learn how to write CREATE TABLE, SELECT and INSERT
statements to create tables and read/write data.  Try here for
starters:

   http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/tutorial-install.html

I recommend postgresql 8.3 at this time.  The connectby() function is
worth the use of testing packages.  And postgresql is always a bit of
a pain to upgrade, so you might as well use the newest version now so
you won't have to suffer a version bump for the longest possible time.

The front end: with a postgresql back end, my only suggestions for a
front end would involve custom application programming.  If you're
willing to learn to program, then the next choice to make is web
vs. desktop deployment.  If you want a web browser front end, then PHP
is perhaps the easiest place to start.  If you want to build a desktop
application, then any language with GTK bindings would work.  If you
learn Java, you could use the same language for both types of apps.
And it would look better on your resume than PHP.  It's just that Java
is a PITA for beginners.  You can find help here.

To get an off-the-shelf front end, I know of only two products:
Microsoft Access and FileMaker.  Access can house tables on its own,
or the tables can reside in a SQL Server database.  FileMaker has
similar functionality, only it uses MySQL as its optional backend.
It's what Mac users use.  Both these products can be queried remotely,
but there are serious weirdnesses with both.

There are others on this list who have more experience with ready-made
front end products.  I imagine openoffice is a serious contender.  In
any case, postgresql is probably not a choice if you go the canned
route.

Amy,

   Yes, postgres will work well for what you want, but there is an
alternative approach that is easier to learn, easier to maintain, and will
fit the organization's needs quite well. It will also allow you to focus on
learning SQL and DBA with a comparatively simple system; you can expand your
knowledge from this base.

   Take a look at SQLite <http://www.sqlite.org/>. It's a fully relational
DBMS that can be embedded in applications written in juat about any
language. Single file, easy maintenance, no hassles to maintaining it on a
server or workstation. I use Python (with the wxPython GUI widgets) as the
front end and middleware with SQLite as the back end. Works great.

   Since you have the time, read Joe Celko's "SQL Programming Style" and "SQL
for Smarties, 3rd Edition" and Rick van der Laans' "Introduction to SQL, 4th
Edition." The latter has a great section on time-based queries which you'll
want to use for reports on a volunteer time database.

Have fun,

Rich

You should definitely look into OpenOffice Base:
http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Database . It works with SQLite,
MySQL, and Postges to name a few of its connectors. It will provide an
experience similar to Access or Filemaker. You can always reuse the data in
other applications if you choose.

They demanded it of me, given that I run some open source projects
with mailing lists off my server.   And the $2/day Bangalore
flunky that makes these decisions won't change his alleged mind.

I was wondering if it would be OK to post jobs to PLUG-JOBS that
aren't strictly Linux related.

Where I work has a couple open positions for tier 3 technical work,
but there is limited Linux at the workplace so far.
But, given the climate, I think someone here may know someone who
would like employment. And PLUG has exposure to some generally skilled
people which is what we look for in the first place.

Thoughts?

Personally, I love buying 'refurbs' be they from Antec, Dell, Apple,  
whomever. Typically, refurb will mean that some defect was found  
during or after manufacturing, or the product was returned 'in like  
new condition'. The manufacture can not legally sell it as new then.  
So they will test and fix any issues, and sell the repaired item as  
refurbished.

Yes, it can be a bit of a gamble, but most manufactures also offer the  
same warranty on their refurbs as they do on the new product. In  
particular, I know Apple gives the same one year service contract on  
refurbs, extendable with Applecare. Exactly the same as if you pay  
full price on the 'Store' website.

Brent,

   Why not use PLUG-TALK for these postings? IMNSHO that would be an
appropriate use of the list.

I agree with everything said so far, and add that you should try to 
learn database design before jumping into SQL or which database to use.  
Learning good design will simplify learning SQL, since you will 
understand the structure behind the language.  There are several good 
books available on the subject, start there rather than a book 
specifically on SQL, since most of the design books will teach the 
basics of SQL.

On the question of Joomla, most CMS's use MySQL as the backend, but you 
could try Drupal which has a contact module, and a MySQL backend.  It's 
written mostly in php.

If you want to go all out, try one of the open source ERP/CRM packages 
like OpenERP.

   That's very good advice. Celko's "SQL Programming Style" does teach a lot
about database design. One could probably find excellent instruction on
normalization (and when to ignore that) on the Web.

I have your basic CIS121 class at PCC type background - this is a
database, these are what these words are, go make something pretty in
Access now.  This was about four years and a bigish chunk of brain
ago, so I'll have to go check out the book you guys recced at the
library. Thanks. :)

I'd actually disagree that you need to wolf down any textbooks before
jumping in.  if you can find a good one-chapter "this is what
relational databases are" wrote-up, for entry-level stuff it won't
matter much which one you use and you don't need the finer points of
understanding what database type to use (mysql) or even necessarily
know why having tables indexed--it's obvious that it won't matter in
your proposed application (low size/complexity).

so if you love reading dense tech text, go for it--but don't let the
reading hold you back.  you can, in fact, basically just jump in and
do well enough.  just be ready to look back someday and say "well, i'd
do that differently now!"

i couldn't handle any of the documentation until i "designed" a couple
of similar-scope databases to the one you described, and those apps
still work fine.  i don't flaunt them on my resume, but i can tell you
i wouldn't have written them at all if i had waited to read a textbook
about it.

Agreed, since this isn't a real project...yet.  Play around with a couple
of tables (since it's MySQL) in a scratch database (heck, for that
matter...call it "Amy" and give yourself full rights to it.)  Create
tables.... Insert Data...Update Data.  Do a few selects and pull data from
different tables that are related with a join.

OOBase and, while I hate to admit it, phpMyAdmin (she obviously has php
installed since she's using Joomla) are all good interfaces to try some of
this and not get too far over the head.  Also, installing the client tools
MySQL Query Browser and MySQL Administrator will help as well.

Just make sure you execute the sql command "flush privileges" after you
build YOUR user id.  ;)

Amy,

   You said that this volunteer project was a way to learn database design,
administration, programming, and SQL, so a bit of reading and thinking will
serve you well. From what little I know about Acess is that it's a flat-file
database best used as a GUI front end to SQL-Server.

   The key to learning about SQL databases is truly accepting that it is
_not_ a procedural language. It's not like GW Basic, Visual C, or anything
like that. It is a declarative language that works with and on sets. You
need to learn to think in terms of sets, not files and fields and giving
explicit, step-by-step instrutions. In SQL you describe what you want and
the underlying engine determines how to present you with those results.

Subject: [PLUG] Blender, Povray, or ...
Message-ID: <20090703204131.GA13585@gate.kl-ic.com>

I have been building a lot of my presentation graphics and 
animations with libGD.  I need to generate 3D drawings of
some structures from simple structures, algorithmically,
with moving POV and text source code.  

I have been looking at Blender for making some of these images,
but that looks to be much better for drawing organic objects
artistically than generating merged geometries algorithmically.
Very complicated, steep learning curve.  A promising alternative
is PovRay, which is command line and language driven, yet can
produce beautiful photorealistic images.  While there is some
content I would like to borrow from Blender,  I am not comfortable
feeding information in through a graphic U.I.  "Command line 
blender" might be cool ...

Anybody here familiar with either or both tools?  Is there another
open source image definition and rendering package I should be 
considering?  One that uses the Nvidia CUDA engine for rendering
(to PNGs or SWF) would be nifty ...

Here is a response from my lispy friend named Scott. I can forward any
further inquiries to him as well. No promises on if he'll respond further.

So you're looking for LINQ in lisp?  =)

As people continue to ask for this sort of thing and point to
Microsoft's and Mono's implementations, it will be added to cl-sql and
friends, but I don't see it out there yet.

Do you really need full general query support for this locally stored
data?  SQL parsing and all that?  If you only need a handful of queries,
writing them as little functions that invoke FIND and SORT would work.

If you really want to start a big project, you could:

* Add another database backend to cl-sql that queries over in-memory
result sets.

* Get http://sourceforge.net/projects/dotlisp/ (Lisp on the Mono CLR) to
interface with the LINQ interfaces (they're C# only in Mono at the
moment, I think).




> Or am I a fool for not going the temp table route?

This sounds better.  You get to keep all those nice DB properties, like
not having everything disappear if there's a power interruption.  If you
want to pull the data off the master DB server and not trouble it again
with repeated queries while users tweak their reports and not use disk
space on the master to store all the users' temp tables, you can keep
the temp tables on one or more replication slaves.

Depending upon the size of these reports, the bandwidth to your clients,
and the application platform, you could even pull the data to the
client's machine and dump it into a local SQLite for really fast updates
while they play with it.




An even better option, if it doesn't involve too much redesign of a
system already in production, would be to have the original data source
be immutable.  Add an insert_date column.  Perform UPDATEs by inserting
another row with the same primary key but a newer insert_date.  Query
the 'live' data by looking for MAX(insert_date).  Then, reports data
wouldn't need to be copied into temp tables.  You could just note the
date that the report was created, and query the original data looking
for MAX(insert_date) AND insert_date < report_date.

Again, control load with replication servers.  You can even
garbage-collect the master server, removing all records except the
MAX(insert_date) rows, to keep the size of the database from increasing
very much.

I quite like them even though I'm employed!  I don't see myself at my

>From your description I would say POVRay is probably the right tool between
the two.  Because it is language driven there are (or at least used to be)
many front ends.  Blender can probably even generate POVRay scene files if
you asked it nicely (never tried, but it seems reasonable).

But, bottom line is: Both tools are very powerful and capable assuming you

This may not be of *any* use to you, whatsoever, but for the sake of
archive-completeness..

KPovModeler is a nice UI for creating POV scene files -- I've found it
to be much more intuitive than blender, but there is likely a power
trade-off there to account for part of that.

If nothing else, it's not a shabby way to figure out if you can do X
in POV ray, and then generate an example.  (perhaps templating things
that you'll fleshout algorithmically?)

When I was working on transmission line towers and model human tower
climbers a few years ago, I used something called K3D.

  http://www.k-3d.org/wiki/Main_Page

I wasn't doing animations, but it can do animations I guess.  And I
was able to interface with it in a comprehensible fashion.  I recall
creating geometries from external software, anyway.

Message-ID: <bfc61080907041840r5dc3bf30tc851782cca65817e@mail.gmail.com>

A friend wants me build a simple sounding gadget, but I'm not sure how
to proceed. Basically an outdoor mike, speaker, and pressure switch
under a mat in/in front of art display, probably with cords going back
to a linux box indoors. When you step on the mat, it plays the last 21
seconds of messages, and then does an audio prompt to leave a 7 second
message.

The microphone and speaker are pretty straightforward, and in a pinch
I was going to build my own normal-open pressure switch (unless
someone knows where I can buy one, maybe electronic keyboard pedal?)
and wire it to short out the spacebar on a cheap pc keyboard via cat5
cable. Not sure how long a run of cat5 can carry keyboard switch level
voltage without becoming ineffective, but I can experiment with that.

Anyone know a good scriptable wav recording/playback app I can put on
the box (maybe command line oriented)? In psuedo-coding this, I
presumed the ability to detect 'keydown' and 'keyup', or an
application that can alternate 'play while key held down' with 'record
while key held down with max clip length' behavior. Ability to detect
silence would allow it to behave a bit more intelligently (or maybe
just a post-recording pass to clip out long gaps in sound above a
certain threshold).

Any ideas for completely different ways to approach this are welcome,
I haven't bought anything yet.

Maybe even could do something based on several programmable greeting
cards instead, just have to have something that the business end can
be left out unattended (IE, less than $30 invested in exposed parts if
someone gets thiefy or vandaly).

Thanks in advance, hope the idea catches your fancy like it did mine
(Idea is to create some entertaining asyncronous communications
between neighbors that rarely talk to each other, just by putting
something at a point they frequently walk past).

Message-ID: <1246833053.31187.12.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

So Lenny will not install from ARC console or MILO and something 
crazy about MILO not being available anymore.  Great, I go to all 
the trouble of downloading the newest version of Debian I know 
about for my Alpha and just like CentOS 4.3, I can't install it.

I realize that Alpha got killed, partially because it was never 
marketed correctly and partially because Intel did not want 
competition when they got into the 64 bit computer business.

Can I install SRM console somehow without breaking ARC console?

There's something vague about installing woody and upgrading, but
where do I get Debian Woody for the Alpha?  This just seems 
completely ridiculous.

I want to get something newer than Redhat 6.2 on my Alpha that
supports DVD burners.  Why on earth does everyone think that I 
have SRM console anyways?

I wish I could get a hold of the last version of Redhat for the 
Alpha, but I guess the last version was 7.2 which wouldn't be
much of an upgrade.

Are there any DVD burning programs that work with Windows NT 4.0
Alpha or Redhat 6.2?

Does Slackware run on the Alpha?

There is an unofficial port of Slackware for Alpha but it hasn't been
updates in many years IIRC.

This might result in booing, but BSD has great alpha support.

Thanks for reminding me of that show, I heard it but should review it.
Was left with the impression that it was good at hooking to sensors
and turning things on and off, but could it record and playback audio
on it's own? Anyway, a bit overkill if I only need one switch
detected, but I would like to get an Arduino, seems to greatly expand
the amount of low-budget projects I could try.

In any case, the timeframe for doing this just changed from 'about a
month' to 'next week', so I'm going to just get a bunch of greeting
card modules for about $3 each (bigdawgspromo.com), arrange them in a
circle, put a wheel with openings in it as an overlay so that only one
record button is exposed at a time, while all play buttons EXCEPT that
one are exposed. The directions on the wheel would be something like
'play as many of the preceeding messages as you like, then record your
response and advance the wheel one mark clockwise'.

Since this solution doesn't keep any record of the messages except the
last message left in each physical module, I'm thinking an extra mike
and switch running via cat5 to the house that records mp3 on the linux
box only while a certain key is held down, 'push to talk' style.

So PLUG question: what's a good linux app that can be made to record
only while a key is being held down?

Subject line says it: I'm looking for a compatible fax modem for a Dell

Linux.

I'd like to avoid as much hassle as possible; my research indicates that 
this means I want a Hayes compatible with fax support.  I'd kind of 
prefer USB 'cause then I can drag it upstairs and let my wife use it on 
her Vista-"powered" laptop, but the important thing is that it works 
with sane/XSane with a minimum of hassle.

It looks like Fry's has some Hayes-compatible USB fax modems for around 
$45/ea; I assume anything that claims Hayes compatibility will work.

Any other suggestions?  (cheaper would be nice).

Any known pitfalls?

Thanks.

warning, usb modems can be winmodems as well.  if they say unix, linux, 
or even dos compatible, then you should be safe.

Well, I won't speak for the Ubuntu side...but I will relate something I
learned on Vista.  If you're running 64-bit Vista be VERY careful.  There
are very few drivers that work with ANY modem (especially USB).  This one
bit me big time helping my in-laws with their new computer and they use
dial-up.  Yeah, don't ask....I'm just the family geek and the sales people
out there have not got a @&#^$ clue (oh, sure...it'll work with no
problems.... <sigh>)

Sounds like a trip to Free Geek is in your future. They usually have a
whole bin of modems that work with Linux. Not sure about USB modems,
although they might have some. But the regular ones are cheap enough
that you could just get one for each computer.

Do you already have a multi-function printer? Use it instead. 
Snag one on its way in to Free Geek and use it for scanning/faxing only.

It might be easier to repurpose the guts of an old mouse. Multiple
buttons and position encoders (if you could think of a use for them),
plus a ready-made bus (PS/2 or USB) to connect to the PC.

The ALSA command-line utilities "arecord" and "aplay" have always
worked well for me, and they should be standard fare in any reasonable
distribution.

I don't know of any existing software that does this off-hand, but it
should be easy enough to implement as a shell script. "arecord"
accepts an optional max duration after which it will automatically
cease recording.

Hello,

I ordered one of these a couple of weeks ago, and it arrived today:
Core 2 Duo T6400, 2.0GHz, 800Mhz, 2M L2  Cache, 4 GB of memory, 250 GB
hdd, WLED = $516.

I argued the shipping charge off, but if you don't, that costs around $50.

Liking it so far.

Andrew

Thanks to all of you for your suggestions.  I have been having
moderate temporary frustration, and overall great fun, with POV-Ray .
After 3 days of hacking, I've built an animation of an 80km
descent from space into a cheesy atmosphere:

http://www.launchloop.com/AtmosphereHack01 
 
Note - 20MB, may take a while to download on a slow connection.

A lot more learning to do, but I'm pretty sure I can do all that
I want with this tool, along with  C++/LibGD for some other kinds
of "less optically exact" diagrams.

   Or, as Wallace says, "cheese, Grommit?"

   Was the animation with a parachute? That would slow it down.

As we all know, non-visual binaries have higher density than text
files, or images.  Executables and libraries are much like a 2x4:
unhampered, they fall like a rock. (video, of course, falls at a rate
between images and executables, having the surface area of the
individual frame's resolution, but with a whole *stack* of them.)

Anything with higher density than a bitmap naturally needs a parachute
when being delivered from the Cloud, lest they be corrupted on
landing.  (Really big images, while not needing a parachute, take a
long time to transfer because of that whole "drifting around like a
feather" thing.)

(Sidebar on damage-detection: md5 effectively extract the "black box"
(the md5sum) out of the delivered data, and detect the presence of any
anomolous activtivity during touch-down.  shai, pgp, etc. simply
provide different kinds of blackbox--some are more robust than others.
 If the md5 box gets banged up, it *might* not be reliable anymore,
but the pgp boxes are a lot more resistant to damage.  At the very
least, you'll always know if a pgpbox was broken on landing, whereas
with a md5box, you're never *certain* that the box survivde while the
binary failed, but it's still a pretty good assumption.)

Advanced systems pair enormous images *with* the binaries -- cutting
out the necessity for the parachute entirely -- of course, if you're
unaware, your local system may not realize that the 'chute is actually
important, and not grant it the care required.  This is why you
sometimes download a game and see visual glitches in the
splashscreen--they're just holes in the 'chute.

Finally, fibre networks are substantially faster because they are
effectively transfering files in a vacuum: nothing but light is
involved (no atmosphere from WiFi/3G, nor any pesky copper), and
without resistance, everything falls at the same rate -- 'chute or no.

All 


I am applying for a tech support job and have to answer this question..

Problem
If an end user were to call you saying they cannot send email through
their local hosted POP3/SMTP server, how would you go about
troubleshooting the issue


Reponse:

1.. Ask if the mail has ever worked..

2.. If mail has worked ask when was the last time it worked correctly

3.  Ask if any hardware/software has been installed since the mail last
worked.

4.  When was the last time the computer was booted.

5.  Have customer boot computer again and check email

6.  Have customer check  POP3 and SMTP settings.

7.  Have customer reenter POP3 and SMTP settings.

8  Reboot computer and try email again.

9. If email is still not working ...Have customer open terminal window
and ping both POP and SMTP servers..

10.  I email is still not working..Have customer call local ISP and see
if there are problems there...


#########################

Is there a better/quicker way/method ?????

Have I missed some obvious step??

If you get this job, I get %5 of the first year salary as commission.
On the other hand, I am not responsible if you don't get the job.

In my experience the usual and overwhelming majority of people who call me
saying "I am having trouble sending email."  do not have internet access. In
this case you have to trace the whole chain from them to the SMTP server
till you find the problem.

Then comes the related problem that the SMTP server is not serving for some
reason.

The next most common problem is that they took their laptop which worked at
home and tried to use it in some random other place and now can't access the
SMTP server.  Many ISP's require you to be on their network before you can
access their SMTP server.

Another less common problem is that the ISP has converted to some kind of
secure/auth SMTP server and the user has not changed their settings.

You can pick out which question to ask to diagnose which problem they have?

the 3 cardinal rules of tech support.

1. is it plugged in
2. is it turned on
3. are you using what you think you're using

in the past, those were pretty straightforward when applied to dumb 
terminals.  nowadays they have many more meanings, but the basic concepts 
are the same.

I don't see any mention of asking for an error message. Since most end-users
don't know what an "error message" is, my favorite way to get them to tell
it to me is to ask "what happens when you try to [whatever they are
complaining about not being able to do]?"

it works well for me. YMMV.

Depends on your customer and most likely when dealing with servers you'd 
probably get a better answer but in my experience whenever I ask "what 
happens when you try to [whatever they are complaining about not being 
able to do]?" I'm usually answered with "I just told you it doesn't work!"


Do not be afraid to joust a giant just because some people believe in 
windmills.

Of course, you have to phrase the question according to the situation.  
When I want to know an error message, I sometimes ask: "After you click 
Send, is anything displayed on the screen?  A message of some kind?"  If 
that's too ambiguous I'll keep rephrasing until I've found the question 
I should have asked initially, and I file that away for the next time 
they call.

You may want to attempt everything else before you have them touch any 
settings. I don't know squat about general system administration, but in 
my experience with industrial control systems, many times a second 
problem will be created any time a user attempts to check / change any 
settings.

Oh, goody!  Tell them that the email maintenance form will be arriving
in their mailbox in a couple of days, they can fill it out and send it
back, and if they filled the form out right, you might fix their email.

Alternately, have your good buddy in telecom disconnect their telephone,
so they can't bother you.  In drastic cases, your good buddy in the 
county health department can quarantine their cubicle.

... :-)

Seriously, most of the questions you want the answers to can be asked
with a data gathering application, which the user can run, then print
out the response (or if the printer isn't working, read from the 
screen).  Such an app, customized for a particular organization, could:

(1) ... put the user in adult problem solving mode, not "mommy-I-got-an-
owie-I'm-gonna-throw-a-tantrum" mode.  Most of what drives tantrums is
powerlessness - give them some power, a program to dominate, not you.

(2) ... collect much of the debugging data automatically - connectivity
status, programs added, etc.  

(3) ... present the data unambiguously - the user is reading the
page/screen, not blovating about bad computers or incompetent sysadmins.

(4) ... produce a faxable printed page, bypassing the net.

I just maintain email for myself and my wife and my small businesses. 
However, if I was working as a sysadmin and supporting more than half
a dozen users in a homogenous computing environment, I would find the
time to develop, deploy, and upgrade such an application so I could
speed up the solution process and minimize the yammering idiocy in my
life.  There would still be too much yammering, but at least I could
delay it until after the basic repetitive questions were answered.

And I would lobby to get the app approved as standard operating
procedure by management.  Most managers love approved procedures
and standardized workflows.  That way, when some clown goes ballistic
when you ask for data from the app or form, it is their personnel
file that gets the "needs psychiatric help" memo, not yours.

Message-ID: <20090709190308.GC3134@gate.kl-ic.com>

Slide presentation programs suck.  There are many alternatives to
OpenOffice and Powerpoint and Keynote, using standard web browsers
as the presentation tool.  

This month's Advanced Topics meeting (unless I am overruled) on
Wednesday July 15 will be about alternative presentation tools. 
I will present the details of WYDIWYS ( internals and future
directions ), see - http://server-sky.com/wydiwys 

I'm hoping to get volunteers to talk about these tools:

Text::Slidez - http://svn.scratchcomputing.com/Text-Slidez/
   Sliderepl - http://discorporate.us/projects/sliderepl/
          S5 - http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/

... or about similar text-to-htmlslide tools.   Javascript and
HTML and SWF experts could help us understand what we can 
accomplish within the web format.  Some of this will resemble
lightning talks, but I want to make sure there is plenty of
time to discuss what the possibilities and improvements can be.

Volunteers, contact me.

Message-ID: <4A5650D3.5010706@comcast.net>

Can someone point me to where the tutorial is put on Hardy?

The Googling I've done says to look in

/usr/local/share/doc/povray-3.6/html

for the POVray tutorial. I installed POVray using the Synaptic Package 
Manager, but I get an error message when I try to go to the 
/usr/local/share/doc directory.

Thanks.

An error?  That could be a lot of things.  What is the output if you
run this:

   ls -ld /usr/local/share/doc/povray-3.6/html

Do you see this message:

   ls: cannot access html: No such file or directory

Or does something else happen?  Either the folder does not exist, or
you don't have permissions to it.  A folder must have the execute bit
set in order to enter it.  The permissions problem could be in a
higher-level folder, like /usr/local/share/doc/povray-3.6,
/usr/local/share/doc, etc.  Any folder you cannot enter will hose all
others under it.

Isn't there an apt command you can use to list the files in a package?
Someone else will have to jump in here.  Or synaptic will let you
click your way to it.

The directory /usr/local/share/doc does not exist on my machine.

I don't find anything about where files were installed when I look at 
Synaptic, just that the package is installed.

If I simply run povray I get this message:

rsteff at moonguide:~$ povray
povray: cannot open the user configuration file 
/home/rsteff/.povray/3.6/povray.conf: No such file or directory

(followed by a lot of other stuff)

Running povray -? returns the same output.

I assume that some configuration is needed, but I don't know where to 
look to find out how to do it.

Thanks for your input.

It's probably in /usr/share/doc/povray

IIRC, /usr/local is not supposed to be touched by the OS (and by
extension, Synaptic/apt), but if you're reading generic install
instructions, it is likely that they assume installation from a
tarball, and those are generally installed into /usr/local or /opt.

Also try:

find / -name "*povray*" | grep -i html

that should give you some hints :)

Last time I looked at it the documentation was windows specific, and
assumed you were running the version with the built in editor.  You
pretty much have to edit scene files in a text editor, and then treat
povray like it's a compiler where the output is an image file.

You don't need a configuration file so long as you put all the
necessary options on the command line such as image dimensions.  The
config file is just a handy way of setting up defaults.  I would be
surprised if it was broken out of the box on any version of Ubuntu as
Mark Shuttleworth has a strong connection to the POVRay community as a
result of using it on the international space station.

I suggest you download the pdf documents from the POVray website;
easier to read and navigate, IMHO .

ftp://ftp.povray.org/pub/povray/Official/Documentation/povdoc-3.6.1-us-pdf.zip

This contains both the 420 page reference manual and the 276
page tutorial.  There are also Tex and PS versions in that same
directory.  

Note that a lot of the tutorial examples are code fragments buried
in the text, not available online AFAIK.   So, you get to do copy
and paste, and often figure out the lights and camera yourself.

I just started playing with POVray this week, and will be making
a heck of a lot of POVray output over the next month.  Perhaps
we ought to team together to solve problems and learn things.


Other POVray notes:

In many cases it is easier to learn specific things by looking at
other people's .pov and .ini files, and the drawings that they make.
Then tweak the parameters and see what happens.

Realism is costly.  The rendering time difference between
"understandable" and "photorealistic" can be seconds to days. 
Much of the POVray community seems committed to the latter, so
they will suggest things like Rayleigh atmospheric scattering 
media to get pictures Just Right, even though that is enormously
more costly (hours) than absorption and emission (seconds).  OTOH,
they make some beautiful pictures ...

Finally, POVray doesn't make animations directly - just a sequence
of numerically ordered images you can turn into an animation with
other tools.  I make SWF movies for the web with the open source
SWFTOOLS.

I have spent huge amounts of time learning POV-Ray, though most of it
was a long time ago.  I'm willing to help including sitting down in a
coffee shop, and helping one on one.  I also just started learning
python for the purpose of scripting Blender.

You should be able to right click on the package in synaptic and
select properties and it will tell you where the files are. Last time
I had to track down a file it listed every file it had installed with
full pathnames, so it was pretty easy.

I've only skimmed the thread so someone else may have suggested this already
but...

Have you looked to see if the documentation is in a separate package?
Perhaps povray-doc ?

Best of luck,

Message-ID: <f72d4c6a0907092140s614abf0bm93d4dbe9d3f35fa5@mail.gmail.com>

In trying to get my HP PhotoSmart  S20 scanner communicating with
VirtualBox (Win 2K guest) I found that the information received by the
kernel (2.6.28-13-generic) from the scanner is wildly inconsistent.
The vendor # and device # are consistent, but the rest is garbled (HP
?HP PhotoSmart C5101A,  HP ?HP oSmart C5101A - S20, HP P,
HEW?HEWLETT-PAC, etc) when it should be HP PhotoSmart C5101A - S20.
This is on a newly set-up machine running Ubuntu 9.04.  The MB is an
Asus M3N78-VM.  The system appears to communicate with other devices
on the USB properly (an HP DeskJet 930C and a ScanDisk card reader).

The data from the scanner received by kernel 2.6.26-2-686 running
Debian Lenny on a Lenovo ThinkPad T42 does not suffer this problem.

Any ideas would be welcomed.  The scanner is a wonderful machine--it
worked fine on Win ME on the old MB when I was dual booting.

Thanks,

-Denis

I may still have some old POVray DOS floppies from the 1980's when I had 
to order share ware by mail. I never had a machine fast enough to do 
anything useful with them. I'm looking forward to developing some photo 
realistic images for a project. I'll be happy to share anything I learn.

That is the way I have usually learned programming related stuff. I look 
at what someone else did in a book, and then adapt it to what I want to 
do. Along the way, I sometimes learn something useful, too.

Kind of like building solid models in wire frame to get the geometry 
right before running the rendering engine on one of the old CAD systems 
I used to use.

My initial interest is in photo realistic stills. But one day I might 
want to do some animations.

I'm looking forward to the journey.

Hi,

I have debian on my laptop and a comcast broadband connection.

When I use a web browser called Epiphany and go to my gmail account
and compose an email, the time it takes for the letters to appear on
the screen as I type them is super slow.

When I open a lot of tabs, i.e. web sites, my system goes so slow that
I can no longer effectivly surf the Internet.

How do I solve these two problems?

Specs of my system:

cat /proc/meminfo
MemTotal:       183820 kB

cat /proc/cpuinfo
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel

I am using KDE.  It is what was automatically installed when I
installed Debian.
I believe I do not have the recommended amount of RAM to effectively
use KDE, and
that is affecting my typing in gmail and my overall web surfing experience.

I think I need to install a different Window Manager and/or Desktop.
I don't understand
the difference between a Window Manager and a Desktop.  Can someone clarify?

How do I install a different Window Manager and/or Desktop?

Most importantly, can you please recommend a combination of Window
Manager, Desktop, and Web Browser, given my computers modest specs,
such that I can compose emails in gmail without the letters appearing
so slow, and furthermore open a lot of tabs and surf the web
effectively.

Perhaps it is the case that I need to invest in new hardware, but I
don't think so.  Linux is
suppose to work on old stuff.  Perhaps I'm asking too much of Linux on
my old laptop?

I don't know.  I just know that I'm kind of miserable composing emails
in gmail, and in surfing the net.

Thank you for your consideration.

Victor

Epiphany is the native web browser for GNOME.  If you're using KDE, the
first thing to try would be Konqueror, which is the native web browser
for KDE.

Adding a stick of RAM would help, I'm sure.  I'm surprised KDE was
installed by default -- you must've used an alternate install
disk/method because usually Debian defaults to GNOME.

A "window manager" is a program responsible for drawing (placing,
sizing, positioning) windows on your screen, and for providing those
windows with decorations (thing like a title bar, a border, and the
little icons you can click on to maximize, minimize, close, etc., the
window).  Window managers also usually provide mechanisms for launching
programs and setting some shortcuts.  Some window managers do a little
more than that, but at heart, that's all they do.

A "desktop environment" is a more comprehensive set of controls, rules,
and apps that seek to provide a unified experience, similar to Apple's
OS X and Microsoft Windows.  Desktop environments all include a window
manager, but beyond what their window managers do, desktop environments
also provide mechanisms for system settings that try to make most
programs behave similarly, even if those programs were not written for
that environment.  Desktop environments also have a set of default
programs, in many cases written specifically to run under that
environment, though some programs will happily run outside that
environment.  AFAIK, there are currently four popular desktop
environments:  GNOME, KDE, LXDE, and XFCE.  The first two are the
biggest (and most resource intensive); the latter two are more
lightweight.

This site is a pretty comprehensive, though somewhat dated, guide to
different DE's and WM's:

http://xwinman.org/


> How do I install a different Window Manager and/or Desktop?

Depends upon what tool you use to install software (Synaptic, aptitude,
apt-get, etc.).  In Debian, desktop environments are provided by
"metapackages" -- for example, "gnome" or "gnome-desktop-environment."
Both will install a lot of programs, but the "gnome" package will
install a lot more; "gnome-desktop-environment" will install everything
you need to run GNOME, without some of the extras you may not want.
"lxde" will install a much smaller number of programs needed to run that
environment; "xfce4" will install the XFCE desktop environment.

To install just a window manager, just search for the one you want to
try.

There are literally hundreds of possible combinations.  One thing to
keep in mind is that most GUI apps are written using either QT or GTK.
QT is the toolkit for KDE and all apps written for KDE use QT.  GTK is
the toolkit for GNOME, but XFCE and LXDE also use it.  If you are
running mostly QT apps, then it makes sense to stick with KDE.  If you
want to run mostly GTK apps, then it probably makes more sense to drop
KDE.  Having apps using both toolkits means you have to have both
libraries installed, which isn't that big a deal.  But running apps
using both toolkits means loading both libraries into memory, and that
will affect performance on a system that has limited resources.  With
your machine's specs, it is probably better to pick one and stick with
it.

In short, if you like KDE, then use Konqueror as your web browser and
get rid of Epiphany.  Try not to use any other GTK apps while you're
booted into KDE.  If you want to try another DE or WM, then you will
probably want to try Iceweasel (which is what Debian calls Firefox) as
your web browser.  Iceweasel is a GTK app, so ditch KDE and try XFCE or
LXDE as your desktop environment.  Don't launch any QT apps while you're
booted into either.

If you want to use just a window manager, and not a desktop environment,
there are a few dozen to pick from and about a hundred times the number
of opinions about the merits or drawbacks of each.  Myself, I like
Openbox, but it takes some adjusting to.  (But LXDE uses Openbox by
default and makes the configuration easy.)  Fluxbox is also pretty
popular.  IceWM is a nice, relatively simple (but capable) window
manager that is pretty intuitive from the get-go.  Many people like
tiling window managers (Xmonad, dwm, Awesome, etc.), but those are
generally better suited to people who use work in terminals a lot and
they have a relatively steep learning curve.  WindowMaker and FVWM have
been around forever and have their devotees.

Check out this article for a good overview of quite a few window
managers:

Linux does work on older hardware, but you can't expect to use all of
the latest, greatest, heaviest apps on hardware that isn't capable of
running them.  The thing that makes Linux capable of running on older
hardware is that it can be modified to suit that hardware, unlike more
monolithic operating systems like Windows or OS X, where modification is
limited.  But Linux doesn't magically make your machine more capable
than it is.  You have to figure out its limits.

You definitely need a new desktop that will be more memory friendly.  
The difference between the desktop and the window manager is mostly in 
programming libraries used.  The two main desktops are KDE and Gnome, 
both are very memory hungry.  A window manager runs on the desktop and 
provides the title bars and menus that you use to control the windows on 
the desktop. 

I was having the same kind of problems on a 256MB Intel P4 box and 
switched to xfce.  I get much better performance with xfce.  You should 
be able to apt-get xfce to install it then choose that from the login 
session manager.  You might also consider a new operation system such as 
DSL or Puppy Linux.  Both are very light weight and designed for small 
memory hardware.

Seconded.  Stop using KDE and Gnome apps if you can on the hardware
you have.

xfce is pretty good and easy to pick up for most users.  I personally
still use fluxbox, which is very light weight but also might be a bit
more difficult to get adjusted to if you aren't using the command line
for everything (like I do).

I would suggest switching to Firefox (called "Iceweasel" in Debian due
to Mozilla's non-free trademark rules) or Opera as your browser.  To
install Opera, you'll need to download the appropriate .deb file from
opera.com and do a 'dpkg -i ...'

There's no real reason to switch to another distribution if you select
the right options during install time.  I install from Debian's network
install CD, which is usually just ~100MB and always avoid selecting
the "desktop" checkbox during the install.  This option equates to
"bloated desktop software" in my book.  If I have to install some
Gnome or KDE libraries or app, then I want to minimize my exposure to
them and install just those, rather than rely on the guy that wrote
tasksel to do it for me.

Anyway, that's my minimalist take on it.  Let us know if you're able
to tame that memory hungry install.

good luck,
tim

In addition to the other excellent suggestions, I would like to add
Xubuntu. Xubuntu uses XFCE, yet it has the user-friendliness and plug
and play advantages that Ubuntu is famous for. At the Clinic I have
installed it on older computers several times and it always seemed very
responsive. It is also very good at auto-detecting and configuring
hardware devices. If I recall correctly it needs only 192 MB of RAM.
Like all the *buntus it is Debian based.

Also, check out whether the computer can take additional RAM and what
kind it requires. Then call the Free Geek thrift store to see if they
have any in stock. For some reason old RAM is more expensive than the
newer varieties, but you can save a bit if Free Geek has any available.

I wound up in the Phoenix Linux User Group mailing list archive once,
when I was meaning to look something up in this list's archive.  I spent
a minute or two wondering how I had missed so many emails.

The first page of my Google results for "plug" include:

Provo Linux User Group
Phoenix Linux User Group
The Philadelphia area Linux User Group
Perth Linux User Group

This is a shot in the dark, but I have a USB device that doesn't quite 
work right with WinXP under VirtualBox, although it was detected and 
would appear in the WinXP Device Manager. I learned a workaround would 
be to connect the device, go into the Device Manager, disable the 
driver, and then re-enable it.

More details are in this blog post:

Probably on the off topic lists I'm sure somebody would help. I swear I

Hey folks,

Probably should have posted this earlier, but anyway here it is.
There is a Fedora 11 release party going on now in Vancouver WA, at Fusion
Bubble Tea Cafe on Mill Plain Rd.

So if any of you feel like hanging out with fellow Linux geeks, perhaps
showing Linux (Fedora specifically in this case) to new  people, stop on
by.  We have CDs and DVDs, stickers, case badges, and a few computers
running Fedora to show different aspects.

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Release_Party_F11_Vancouver

Beware of the exit to Mill Plain Rd. from i205 NB (from Portland) is
currently closed.

Google should be able to help you find the Portland Mac Users Group. I'd be awfully surprised if they charge for access to their mailing lists. Even if they do, it's a big Internet out there. Someone will be happy to help.

Thanks for the link.  However, I doubt that my problem is of the same
nature.  I mentioned VBox only to say how I encountered the problem.
With VBox not in the picture at all, I find that watching
/var/log/messages (tail -f /var/log/messages) shows that the name of
the scanner is read (or transmitted) wrong most of the time.  Plugging
and unplugging the USB or the power to the scanner produces the random
results I posted in my original message.  I expect that even if VBox
managed to communicate with the scanner it would not be getting
sensible data.

I am setting up to try Ubuntu 8.04 live, a different cable, and a
different plug on my MB.  Maybe these tests will help illuminate the
nature of the problem.

What: Personal Telco Project Weekly Meeting and FooCab Workshop
      http://wiki.personaltelco.net/WeeklyMeeting20090715
When: Wednesday, July 15, 2009, 6:30-8:00 p.m.
Where: Jason McArthur's house
       712 NE 52nd Ave

The general idea is to have a workshop on the FooCabs[1] (AlixCab[2]
and WgtCab[3]), construction, flashing and administration.  If you
have an interest is how these things are being put together,
suggestions (and patchs) for improvement, etc, this is a place to be.
Should be fun.

If you have a 3.3V TTL serial cable, please bring it.  If you have
JTAG skills, that might be cool too.  We currently have one WGT board
that seems hosed, blinking lights but no serial console, no network,
etc.

It's likely that if a board quorum is present, PTP might spring for
pizza or something too.  It is rumored that Jason will be providing
beer.

I have tried ubuntu 8.04 32 bit (live), a new cable, and a different
plug on the MB.  Same behavior.  Since this scanner worked with my old
MB, I would like to try a PCI USB card to see if it has better luck.

Mac's are *nix-y boxen, however, support and help for Macs might be better
on dedicated Mac lists.

Macintosh is not merely Unixy or Unix-like. It's completely Unix. As
much Unix as AIX and Solaris:

http://www.opengroup.org/comm/press/19-2-nov07.htm

As for whether PLUG is an appropriate forum. The description on the
web site describes it as "General Linux/UNIX discussion and help;
civil and on-topic". I'd say that since Macintosh is Unix, it
qualifies. However, the pool of Macintosh users here is thin compared
to the pool of Linux users. You'd have better chances getting help
setting up a cron job than setting up an iCal alarm.

In the Gnome file browser one can right click on a folder and choose 
Sharing Options. Three options are presented in the Folder Sharing 
window: [] Share this folder, [] Allow other people to write in this 
folder, and [] Guest access (for people without a user account. If the 
folder is not already shared, the first option is the only one not 
grayed out. Once [] Share this folder is selected, the second option can 
be selected.

Question: how do I make the last option available?

I have a couple of folders on this machine that I'd like to have 
available, both for reading and writing, from any other machine in the 
house. So far, I've only been able to make them available for reading. 
If I want to move something there from another machine, I have to do it 
from this machine.

I agree. :)

But then, if I'm setting up an alarm for 'me', I'd use iCal. If I'm  
setting up an automatic process, then I'd use cron.

Or am I missing something... Maybe I'm overthinking it?

Nautilus lets me down often, and most commonly when trying to change
permissions. Usually the problem is that I have to open Nautilus as
root in order to have permission to do what I want. But I hate to do
that because that will change the desktop to root's desktop. And I
can't get my desktop back unless I completely reboot - logging out and
back in again doesn't do it. It should, but it doesn't. 

As a result I just use the command line. Unfortunately, I am not really
smart enough to use Linux, so in order to figure out how to change
permissions from command line I go here:

http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/filepermissions.html

There are lots of other places with documentation. 

Personally, I would just do "sudo chmod 777 <directory name>." But
there may be better settings in your case.

*Don't* do this! 777 is an exception to the rule, probably only for things
like /tmp.

   Permissions have three categories: User, Group, Other (i.e., everyone).
Each category has three attributes: Read, Write, eXecute. These attributes
are represented by a binary word (8 bits); from left to right the bit values
(in base-10) are 4, 2, 1.

   Files generally have rw-r--r-- permissions. That is, everyone (file owner,
everyone in that owner's group, and everyone else can read the file, but
only the owner can write to it.

   Directories ("folders" in Microsoft) are different:

     * Execute permission is required for a user to cd into a directory.
     * Read permission is required for a user to use a command such as "ls" to
 	view the files contained in a directory.
     * Execute-only permission allows a user to access the files in a
 	directory as long as the user knows the names of the files in the
 	directory, and the user is allowed to read the files.
     * Write permission allows the user to create, delete, or modify any
 	files or subdirectories, even if the file or subdirectory is owned
 	by another user.

   You can change file/directory permissions in either of two ways:
category/attribute or number. With category/attribute you can, for example,
make a file globally executable by the chmod command (as root): "chmod a+x
<filename>". Doing the same thing by numbers (again, as root) you'd type,
"chmod 755" and that gives the owner full permissions, group and other
read/executte permissions. This is also a good default for directories.

I'm using KDE, but I am going to assume this is the same kind of thing. KDE 
has the option to turn on sharing, but it will be grayed out until the proper 
packages are installed that allow the actual sharing to happen. So, for me on 
Kubuntu, to get the ability to share folders, I need to first install the NFS 
or SMB packages, and then I can share things over the network through the KDE 
interface. 

Hopefully that's what you need to get this going.

Thanks to all for your advice.

I'm familiar with the chmod notation. Most of my directories are 755. It 
turns out that the subdirectory I was trying to reach was set to 700! 
After changing it to 755 all is well again.

   Does anyone have a working script that will count chunks of text separated
by two newlines?

   I have a plain text file with names, addresses, phone numbers, etc. and
I'm curious how many distinct entities are in the file. Each line ends with
a newline, but they are separated by a blank line. I'm sure that such a tool
can be cobbled together from shell tools or any scripting language and,
rather than re-inventing the wheel, I'd like to use one already written.

picking up a couple of books. Does anybody have some good suggestions from
what they've read/used? I've been exposed to OO programming through PHP and

i think that:

awk 'BEGIN{RS=""}END{print NR}'

will give you what you want.

and i just realized that since you don't really care about the data, a 
much quicker answer is:

grep -c '^$'

but the awk magic might be useful if you decided you want to actually do 
something with the data down the road.

  perl -e 'local $/ = "\n\n"; my @p = <>; print scalar(@p), "\n";'

You may want to check for blank paragraphs or allow for trailing, 
ending, or more than two newlines.  If you don't care about the 
paragraph content, just counting those conditions would be like:

  1+scalar(() = $t =~ m/(?!^)(\n\n+)(?!$)/mg)'

Joe,

   Of course! I was thinking regex and wc, and totally forgot about awk.

Eric,

   I _knew_ there was a perl solution. :-) After all, it is for text
processing. Unfortunatly, I don't know perl, so I thank you.

   I'm cutting and pasting from web pages and cleaning the text as I go.
There won't be blanks or more than two newlines.

Thanks!

   I have some that I'll give you. I looked closely at java before deciding
on python so the jave books don't do me any good. Contact me off the list to
arrange a place to exchange them.

These suggestions are meant to improve your overall knowledge of java
program design and programming robustly / pragmatically.  If you are
comfortable with OOP and programming in general, then these shouldn't
be difficult to tackle, but they are not introductory.

I've learned a lot from "Effective Java: Second Edition" and by
reading the Google Collections mailing list.
(http://code.google.com/p/google-collections/ ) The discussions and
justifications for the Google Collections design decisions are
extremely educational.  I also suggest following the bug reports /
feature suggestions (and using the library yourself, which you should
do too.).

Most of the discussions on there have been very reasonble, with clear
explanations to back up every request / decision.  Since programming
is very rarley black and white, it's good to see both sides of the
story, and there are many extremely intelligent people involved with
that project.

The codebase is also not so large that it's intimitading.  You can
easily crawl around and see *exactly* how something was implemented.

After you've worked through those resources for a while, take a look
at another Joshua Bloch book: Java Puzzlers, to get a more whimsical
look at the many ways you can shoot your self with Java.  It's a good
way to revisit many of the suggestions from Effective Java with out
the monotony of re-reading another (fairly) dense book ;)

All,

I'm embarking on a voyage of discovery with Java and I'm looking into
picking up a couple of books. Does anybody have some good suggestions from
what they've read/used? I've been exposed to OO programming through PHP and
Perl. Also and web resources and mailing lists would be helpful as well.

thanks,

--------------

Objects First with Java, ISBN-13 978-0-13-606086-4

A little spendy since it's a text book, but well worth it.  
The first half of the book is basic OOP, the second half is 
how to program well.  If comes with a CD with lot's of examples 
and there's an online resource for it as well.  When you get to 
actually writing Java programs, use Eclipse for your IDE, it's 
written in Java so it works everywhere, and has a lot of interactive 
help for syntax for using the many classes available.


Sorry if this is a duplicate email, the first one got sent as HTML and 
I figured it would get dropped.

The best way that I've found to learn any language is to embark on making a
compiler or interpreter for the language, preferably in the language.

If you don't have a lot of university level comp. sci. classes under your
belt it can be an intimidating undertaking.  But in a lot of ways that's
because people think compiler construction starts with parsers and moves on
to abstract syntax trees followed by code generation.  In reality, you can
get the knowledge of how the language works by skipping the parser and the
code generation.

Try this approach:
* Read up on the language, whatever resource you like that covers the
language in depth is fine.  This serves to give you a background on what the
language is like and how it works at a high level.

* Build data types and classes to represent expressions in the language.
The representation doesn't have to be 100% correct or complete, just close
enough that you get a feel for how to represent it.  This is an opportunity
to learn also how people structure data types and programs in your
language.  Find a mailing list for users of your language and share your
code with them and ask for feedback.

* Write classes/functions/etc that act on your data types and evaluate them
the way the language is supposed to be evaluated.  This teaches how and why
the language works the way it does.  You can do this without knowing
anything about code generation or compiling to bytecode.

If you do the above things, you'll walk away with a fairly deep
understanding of the language.  And the more time you spend getting
feedback, the faster you'll learn and the more wisdom you can build on from
experts.

Next step is probably to read/debug other people's code.  Someone else here
recommended reading the Google Collection's list and I think that's great
advice too.

Just remember:  You don't have to finish this project, nor do you really
need to spend time on the boring parts.  Just the parts that help you
understand the language and how people typically solve problems when using
it.

Good luck,
Jason

Doesn't this require that you know assembly language???

Compile to what...??

Interpret to what..???

This is not a bad idea, but linux-yug does rightly point out that the
project is a little more involved than ideal. Instead of a "compiler" or
"interpreter" I would say "lexical analyzer" or "syntax checker" so that you
don't have to generate the actual bytecode. This way you can compile a
foo.lang file and use your executable to syntax check other foo.lang files,
and have learned a lot in the process without getting too deep into the
minutaue of system software.

That's the beauty of the approach.  You don't compile it to an executable.
Instead you write the code that takes the representation of the program, and
processes it according to the rules of the language.

For example, you could make a data type that represents an if-statement.
You could then instantiate the if-statement and evaluate it.  First you have
to evaluate the boolean and then you pick the right branch of the
if-statement.  It's not as magical or weird as it seems.

I like to compare learning a computer language to learning a foreign
language.  The only way to learn it is to use it.  The most likely
opportunity to use it is in everyday speech or watching the Fernseher.

Take a program you have already written in another language, and
translate it to java.  In this way you can concentrate on the language
rules without being encumbered with a programming task, and yet end up
with something useful .  I have done this several times in the past to
move an existing web server framework in language A to a new language
B.

If you have a perl or PHP website laying around, this would be a good
opportunity to get a Struts or Faces environment built, and learn the
java way of writing the same website.  I personally like Struts, but
I'm not very with-it in today's java scene.  A Struts or Faces book
would not be a bad purchase.  Both are Apache projects with online
docs (as is the Tomcat web server, which you'll need for both).

Once you get the basic hang of java, your best resource will be the
online javadocs.  Google for "java $version api", where $version is
1.4.2, 1.5 or 6.0.  You can find online javadocs for Tomcat, Struts
and Faces too, along with most other common libraries.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux-compatible laptops
Message-ID: <16349.72423.qm@web50606.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

I'm about to get a new laptop, and it would be nice to get one at a retail store whose hardware was supported by Linux. The only problem I have ever encountered with earlier laptops was with the Wifi adapter, but now that most of the new ones don't have PCMCIA slots (to provide Wifi connectivity if the built-in Wifi adapter doesn't work), this is an important point. 

I suppose it boils down to whether the Wifi chipset is supported by Linux, then. Could someone direct me to a source of information on this subject, or suggest laptops that are or are not suitable on these grounds?

Most people don't like Windows Vista, but XP, which is still liked better, is no longer installed on new PC's. Windows 7 won't be out until October, and may or may not be free as an upgrade to purchasers of new equipment. So it may be an especially good time to think about installing Linux on such equipment.

The commodity Intel abg wireless chips have worked fine for me. I would
download the latest kernel source, look what is in the wireless modules
source folder, and see if one of those will suit the chip in the laptop you
want to buy. I got a Dell Vostro 1310 last year which has been quite Linux
friendly.

It's always a good time to think about installing Linux on such equipment.

I've found that WiFi support also depends upon the Linux flavor you 
install.  For example, my Daughter has a Gateway with Vista.  Using only 
live CDs, I found that Ubuntu supported all the hardware.  All my 
RPM-based OSen (PCLOS, Fedora and OpenSUSE) had problems with the 
wireless and required ndiswrapper.

You might try linux-drivers.org as it contains links to several lists.

I installed Fedora 8 and 10 on several Dell laptops (Inspiron 1500,
Lattitude 610, 630, 830, Vostro). Never had any problems, all hardware
"just works", including sound and wireless.

Wifi on Linux has been a horrible hodgepodge for a long time, but it
is (painfully) slowly getting better and better.  Today, it is even
usable, with some occasional problems.  Basically, wait six months and
things are better.  In another six months, it'll be better again.  Two
years from now, I expect it'll be super awesome with sauce.

linuxwireless.org has some information about supported hardware.  If
the laptop has intel or atheros radios, the drivers are pretty good.
Broadcom radios historically have had worse drivers because they are
reverse engineered and based on lots of guess work.  USB radios often
have decent support too, so pcmcia is not your only option for
pluggable devices.

I have more experience with the Atheros radios, but for managed-mode
either Atheros or Intel radios should keep you (reasonably) happy.
Both have vendor cooperation now, which helps a great deal.

The last time I went laptop shopping, I did it with an Ubuntu Live CD in
hand. The sales folks at most (not all) stores let me reboot a target
system and boot from that CD. I was able to test basic hardware
compatibility (including wireless) in that fashion.

Thanks,
Mike

Alternative - USB2.0 WIFI adapters.   The ZD1211B based devices
are cheap, and work out of the box with Ubuntu.  If you are running
an older driver, you may need to compile a driver module.

Although Wifi is built into most laptops, it is usually low power
5mW stuff, not a lot of range.  Drivers can be a problem, and they
often change chipsets on the supposed same model of laptop. 

Lastly, for security purposes I want the wifi to be OFF when I
unplug the USB or PCMCIA card;  without a direct power switch I
am relying on corruptable software and firmware to take internal
Wifi offline.  Sometimes you just want to raise the drawbridge,
rather than trust the guards.

I find that laptops at stores like BestBuy are generally not what most 
people expect. I see HP's, Acer's and Toshiba's all the time that brake 
down just after the warranty's expire, especially HP/Compaq.

If you can get past the store part, I recommend the Dell Latitude 
E-series. I have the e6500 and Ubuntu Jaunty 32bit operates flawlessly 
on it. All the features work great, including the back-lit keyboard, 
wireless and webcam. It has both a PCMCIA and Express Card slot if you 
need'em. The whole bottom of the laptop comes off with one screw, and 
all the components including CPU are accessible from there. Magnesium 
chassis, internal WWAN card slot, quad core capable, etc. Don't mean to 
sound like a commercial but after several months I just love this thing. 
3 year warranties are standard with the e6500 too. The Precision M4400 
is the same machine with a high end Quadro if you need it and finally a 
true 8-bit LCD to see the full color gamut.

I got mine from the Dell outlet for $700 under the price off the main 
website.

I find System76 to be very expensive for what you get. They're heavy, no 
docking capabilities, lackluster options, and someone said they are 
re-branded Acers? Ugh...

XP can be purchased still and installed. 7 is a free upgrade as of now, 
but only the same edition of Vista that comes on the machine. Vista 
Basic doesn't count.

Don't most have ExpressCard slots?  It's my understanding that
ExpressCard is simply a PCMCIA standard where the cards get hooked
directly into either the PCI Express bus or the USB 2.0 bus, depending
on the type of card.  I'm guessing Linux will have less trouble with
this, at least in the mid-term, than it had with PCMCIA/PCCard slots
over the years.  

More educated comments on this topic are welcome.

Yes, USB is an option.

Keith> Although Wifi is built into most laptops, it is usually low

Not true.

a) in the olden days, commodity wifi radios were typically 30 mW.  A
   few years ago, if you had an intel radio, it was 100 mW.  Though I
   haven't looked recently, I expect at least that or higher now.
   Atheros radios are in that range as well.  If you are curious,
   check out the FCC documents on your device (by looking up the FCCID
   in their online database).  People selling rf gear in the US are
   required to disclose lots of goodies and it ends up there.  I am
   not aware of *any* wifi radio as weak as 5 mW.  An iphone, btw, has
   a wifi radio with a tx power of 500 mW.  The FCC limitation is 1W
   with a 6 dBi antenna.  Almost no one does or should use that much.

b) The built-in wifi is almost always better than an external wifi and
   the reason is that the built-in wifi has better antennas (there's a
   lot of room in the lid to stash antenna elements).  A USB wifi
   dongle has almost no room for an antenna, not even a quarter-wave
   dipole.  As a consequence, the gain on a USB dongles radio is going
   to be very low.  A few years ago, I connected with a stock IBM
   (atheros, probably 100 mW) radio and stock lid antenna 2 miles away
   from the top of Mt Tabor to the Hawthorne Hostel, which is a rather
   surprising-but-true story that I am still (as you can tell)
   repeating to people.  Without an unweildy antenna, you are unlikely
   to outdo that.

Keith> Drivers can be a problem, and they often change chipsets on the

Yes.  Manufacturers often substitute different components, so if they
don't say specifically, don't assume.

I also suggest that you consider buying online directly from the
"manufacturer".  While you can often find reasonable computers at a
retail store, the specs on them are often 3 - 6 months behind the
specs you will get online for the same price. Less memory, lower hard
disk space, generally just slightly behind the times.  It is also
useful to know that many of the laptops come from the same
manufacturer, Quanta Computers in Taiwan, and are rebranded, so though
it looks like you have a lot of choices, most of them come off just a
few assembly lines.

I am happy with my HP Pavilion DV6000, it is more than a year old now
and is holding up well. It's Broadcom wifi works with ndiswrapper, and
recently with the kernel b43 driver. That said, I would look for one
with the Intel or Atheros wifi because of their explicit linux support
as shown here.

When I was shopping for my current Thinkpad T61 I was given to
understand that the switch on the front of the case physically
turned the power to the bluetooth and wireless devices on or off.

I have never inspected the wiring diagrams for the T61 to see if this
is really true. But if a business traveler turns off the switch and
then powers on the laptop during a flight, and as a result of the
radios not really being turned off the plane crashes, the bill that
Lenovo will receive will not be trivial.

I feel comfortable in assuming that corporations quake in fear of the
unbounded greed of ambulance chasing attorneys.

As for Linux software, I don't know. I do know that if I flick the
switch off while running Jaunty I instantly lose my bluetooth mouse and
my wireless connectivity via the internal Intel 4965agn.

Message-ID: <20090715040202.GA23930@gate.kl-ic.com>

OK, so the template file I use for WYDIWYS has a problem.
It pulls event keyCodes with firefox, not with Safari or IE. 
I can still navigate with a mouse, I just can't use my clicker.

Here is a bit of the Javascript code:

------
document.onkeypress=function(e) {
   var e=window.event || e
   var num=e.keyCode  || e.which;
   switch (num) {
      // keyboard
      case 36: window.location = first;   break;  // home          key
      case 35: window.location = last;    break;  // end           key
------

You can see more by going to:
   http://server-sky.com/slides/plug_general_2009_07_02/
... and doing a control-U to show the page source.  

What I've seen so far says that MSIE's JScript and JavaScript have
differences in their event handling from Netscape/Mozilla/Firefox. 
And by sensing the browser, you can extract the event in the two
different ways. 

I imagine I can spend three hours looking around for, and implementing,
the best way to do this.  OTOH, perhaps somebody here already is
depressingly familiar with this problem and can provide clues.  
Either on the list, or come to Advanced Topics tomorrow night, and
you can help Eric Wilhelm and I improve the Javascript code in
our template files.

And if somebody brings a Windoze/Explorer laptop, and someone else
brings a OS-X/Safari laptop, we can try this stuff out on all the
different machines.  I will bring my two remote presenter clickers,
and we can pull codes off them and do neat things with them.

probably your best bet is to use something like jquery which handles 
browser differences for you.

MSIE? JavaScript? I recently joined this list, but have seen a lot of things
that rightly belong in PLUG-talk or a forum. Use Debian and enjoy the GNU

I am given to understand that the primary reason turning off personal
electronics in during takeoff/landing is so that passenger attention
is directed towards crew instructions rather than distracted by
gizmos, not because they actually significantly interfere with
navigational systems.

Also, from reading the linux-wireless mailing list, I am further given
to understand that some rfkill switches physically turn the radios off
and on, and some rfkill switches simple tell the operating system to
toggle state.  In the later case, it is possible for confusion to
arise, becoming confused about whether you just turned something off
or turned something on.

Thanks, Joe!

jQuery looks like just the ticket.  It is open source, free, and
provides one interfact that works with all browsers - somebody
else takes care of all the silly exceptions.  A client side
include of jquery.js downloads the 50K to 100K file, which is
cached and used with all the pages that need it.  

Indeed, adding another .js file for the prev/next slide selection
stuff looks like a good way to factor out some common JavaScript
from all my slides.  

I found a description of jQuery in "JavaScript - the Missing Manual"
(2008) which I just brought home from the library.  This looks like
a handy book.

However, if you, or anybody else reading this, understands jQuery
and JavaScript well enough to help Eric and me improve our slide
presenters, please come to Advanced Topics Wednesday night at 7pm
and teach us something about it.  

Please help our slide presenter programs Suck Less.

Keith

BTW - why does this stuff matter to open source?  Because webslides
and websites in general should be viewable with as many browsers as
possible - Mozilla/Firefox, Opera, Safari, Internet Explorer, etc.
JavaScript is an open language, the SeaMonkey interpreter built into
Mozilla/Firefox is open code, and if you are designing web pages 
with client-side smarts, JavaScript is probably your best bet.  Yes,
Micro$oft forked JavaScript into JScript, and inverted the Document
Object Model because they are meanies, but that is the world we live
in, and if we want our web pages to be accessable to IE users, we 
need to design J[ava]Script that swings both ways.  jQuery looks like
an easy (and open source) way to do so.

802.11b wireless networks have been certified on aircraft since 2003,
ref -
http://news.cnet.com/Boeings-sky-high-Net-access-takes-off/2100-1023_3-983712.html 

I understand that electronics on fly-by-wire planes (mostly Airbus) are
pretty well protected from electromagnetic interference w/wrapped
cables. The power generated by APUs, A/C systems, and even Galley Ovens
is a lot greater than a wireless card.

   And the reason cell phones are supposed to be off is that they pass over
cells so quickly that the ground network has a difficult time trying to keep
up with the changes. Nothing to do with aircraft safety. Of course, many of
us have forgotten to turn off the phones and there's been no problems with
the flights.

   Similar lack of truth with the "water landing" instructions.

Hopefully you will miss this recall fun then:

http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&docname=c01087277

You'll know it happened if your wireless LED suddenly goes orange and 
can't be turned on (card will be undetectable, mobo is at fault), or the 
laptop doesn't power up consistently. I've seen two dv6000's in the last 
couple months with this problem. But they are not in the batches listed 
on HP's site. Nice.

Thanks for the warning. I followed the above link and indeed my laptop is on
the list of ones that might be in trouble, but I don't have any of the
symptoms listed as of yet.   The only real problems I have had with this
laptop and linux is that the power management will work in one kernel, then
break in the next and I have spent a lot of time tracing down problems with
the suspend mode. It is getting a little more stable, but I am always
careful to upgrade kernels only when I have time to troubleshoot the suspend
mode.

More than WIFI compatibility I would check to see if suspend mode worked
well if I were shopping for a laptop.

Bill,

   Just to satisfy my curiosity, why upgrade kernels if everything on the
unit works with the existing kernel?

I'm working through the POV-Ray tutorial. I'm wondering if the images 
are supposed to be as dark as I see them, or if I've missed something. 
Here are a couple of examples:

The tutorial says to render at 250 x 150, but that's too small to see 
details very well at this lighting level, so I upped it to 500 x 300.

Ah, but things could always run better.  For instance in the last kernel
upgrade  the b43 wifi drivers finally work well with my laptop so I no
longer have to use ndiswrapper. This is a great plus in my book, So even if
things are working, I assume that something will work even better in the
next kernel.

What: Personal Telco Project Weekly Meeting and FooCab Workshop
      http://wiki.personaltelco.net/WeeklyMeeting20090715
When: Wednesday, July 15, 2009, 6:30-8:00 p.m.
Where: Jason McArthur's house
       712 NE 52nd Ave

The general idea is to have a workshop on the FooCabs[1] (AlixCab[2]
and WgtCab[3]), construction, flashing and administration.  

FooCab is an OpenWrt-based single board computer configured to be a
gateway router for a Personal Telco node, but of course, with small
changes, different functionality is possible.

If you have an interest is how these things are being put together,
suggestions (and patchs) for improvement, etc, this is a place to be.
Should be fun.

If you have a 3.3V TTL serial cable, please bring it.  If you have
JTAG skills, that might be cool too.  We currently have one WGT board
that seems hosed, blinking lights but no serial console, no network,
etc.

It's likely that if a board quorum is present, PTP might spring for
pizza or something too.  It is rumored that Jason will be providing
beer.

Hello!

Does any one have experience having a laptop motherboard repaired at the 
circuit level.

I have an Acer ?Inspire 1800. I have Ubuntu installed on it and really like 
the laptop.

When it starts to boot it starts to go through the booting cycle and then 
powers off. Within 10 -15 seconds. I have had several people look at it and 
they say it is the motherboard. 

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Dale

I started this thread. Anyhow, I ordered a Dell Inspiron 15 which includes a 1397 Wifi mini-card, said to be compatible with Linux. (In fact, this card is found on some Dell laptops with Linux pre-installed.) The other features of this unit appear to be acceptable, at least for me.

Dale,

   I've not had a portable motherboard fail, but I offer two suggestions: 1)
find a replacement either on eBay or the companies that specialize in
recovering working components from portables and re-selling them and 2) call
Northwest Computer Support in SW Beaverton and ask them for their
suggestions.

You can't repair the motherboard. You need to replace it, which you
can do if you manage to find another laptop you can use for parts (in
practice, a broken laptop of the same model, but you have to be sure
the motherboard is not broken too).

What is the evidence that it is really the motherboard and not the power
supply or the fan or something else? Is there a bios cpu monitor that turns
the system off if the cpu gets too hot?  Is that what is triggering the
power off?  Maybe the heatsink is not attached well to the cpu and is
causing it to overheat, or the fan is not running and that is causing it to
overheat. It could be several things, even something in the kernel that is
killing it during the boot process. Does it always power off at exactly the
same place in the boot process?

It can be repaired if you have the right skills, tools and test 
equipment.  But it is probably cheaper and less frustrating to replace 
it and recycle the old one.

Subject: [PLUG] WYDIWYS, advanced topics, thanks Eric, etc.
Message-ID: <20090717183004.GE18013@gate.kl-ic.com>

First, thank you to Eric Wilhelm for talking about Text::Slidez
at Advanced Topics on Wednesday, and thank you Tony Rick for 
making arrangements with Roots.  There are more chairs and tables
and a screen in the back room.  Note for those attending the
August presentation (I will be out of town), and for presentations
in April-August 2010 - we should bring some thin black plastic 
tarps to tape over some of the windows to keep the sunlight off
the screen.

Version 0.7 of WYDIWYS, which I presented at Advanced Topics, is
available at http://server-sky.com/wydiwys .  I fixed the file
inclusion, the first/last button on the last slide, and used
jQuery (thanks Joey, others) to process key clicks.  It now works
with Internet Exploder as well as Firefox/Mozilla.  The next step
is to tweak the javascript so it sizes images more adaptively,
and to incorporate as much of Text::Slidez as I can.


Some requests:

1) If anybody here is using Safari(Mac) or Opera(any platform) or
Chrome, please read the instructions for the button controls on
the WYDIWYS page, then click to the demo presentation and see if
all the keyboard buttons work.  You will need to enable Javascript,
and for the last slide, flash player.  If you use some other
browser than the above, try that too!


2) I would like to intelligently preload the flash and images into
browser cache somehow, while other slides are showing.  That will
speed up local presentations a little and remote presentations a lot. 
Suggestions?  AJAX for dummies?


3) I have two RF presenters and their clicker codes;  I would like
to get more.  Those will get added to the navigation() function in
wydiwys.js  .  If you have such a clicker, go to:

http://sawmac.com/missing/javascript/tutorials/examples/chapter06/events.html
AKA:  http://snurl.com/nfmkh

... and start pushing buttons and see what codes they make.  Note
that some buttons have modes, they emit two different character
patterns in alternation.


4) On this page (borrowed from Edward Tufte):

http://server-sky.com/slides/wydiwys_demo/stalin_D_intro.html

The statue of comrade Stalin is saying "????????? ?????", which
is allegedly Ruski for "next slide".  How is that pronounced? 
It tranliterates as "Sledujuskij Slijd".  I would suffer tongue
lock if I tried to pronounce it that way ...  :-)

It's summer, and you know what that means!  Swimming, hiking,
baseball, bicycling, trips to the beach or the zoo?  

Hell no!  You can get skin cancer, break bones, and get sand
kicked in your face.  Ants.  Sunburn.  Mosquito bites.  Heck,
you might even have to spend time with family and children!

Instead, bring your computer to Free Geek at 1731 SE 10th on
Sunday, July 19th at 1pm.  We will help you install or tune up
Linux.  We have keyboards, meece, LCD displays, wifi, and
hardwired internet connection.  We have many different Linux
distros.  We have coffee, chips, and often cookies and Portland
Punch.  Most of all, we have a wide variety of experience;  we
teach and learn from each other.  This is not a class;  the 
clinic is hands-on.

No self-respecting penguin would go outside on days like these.
All the animals at the zoo are hiding in the shade.  The Big
Blue Room is *not* air conditioned.  So show that you are at
least as smart as a Naked Mole Rat.   Come to Linux Clinic, and
make bits happen!

I haven't used any of the above cards, but I've been maintaining an
analog Mythbox for several years using the Hauppauge PVR-350.  I'm
right in the middle of the process of building a new machine from
scratch as an HVR.  The hardware is in the mail from Newegg.

However, I did already buy my tuner card to test it out before
investing in the expensive hardware.  I chose the Hauppauge HVR-950Q:
  http://www.hauppauge.com/site/products/data_hvr950q.html

Note that it uses a *completely* different chipset than the HVR-950,
but fortunately the drivers for this are coming along nicely.  I
actually spoke with the maintainer of the linux drivers on IRC and was
able to get some over-the-air channels to come in just fine using it
on my old hardware.

Note that USB tuners have got a bad rap quite a bit over the years, I
think mostly because they typically don't include a hardware encoder.
The 950Q doesn't, but with ATSC video coming in, your card doesn't
*need* to do any encoding.  It just relays the MPEG stream on to your
box.  This makes cards cheaper.  Yes, you'd have to do encoding if you
use the analog tuner in the card, but I don't imagine I'll be doing a
lot of that, and with a new quad-core proc, it can probably handle it.

Now, a little bit about my experiences with getting the 950Q
working...  The latest kernel sources available in Debian unstable are
2.6.30-2, and the 2.6.30 line includes an early version of the
driver I needed.  I initially built a kernel from 2.6.30-1, had to
fight with my nvidia proprietary drivers a bit because they don't keep
up with kernel changes that well, but finally got that kernel booting
and running.  The card worked fine after i figured out how to get
MythTV to use it, but the kernel was generally *very buggy*.  All
video, even from old tuner card, has all kinds of stutters and
whenever I put a DVD in my drive, I got a kernel panic.  Fun.  Later I
noticed the 2.6.30-2 sources included a fix in the ide-cd driver, so I
thought that issue might be fixed.  Unfortunately I couldn't get that
kernel to boot *at all*.  

After rolling back to my custom 2.6.26, the problems went away.  I'll
probably end up compiling the latest third-party drivers against
2.6.26 instead of trying the latest mainline kernel.

Anyway, that's one case study of a particular card under Linux.
HTH,
tim

   - OS X (Leopard, Intel) Firefox 3

I have sometime access to a G4 iBook (Tiger), but haven't gotten to that one
yet.

The documented keys work for the most part with some notable exceptions:

   1. Mouse Left Click does not work on any of them.
   2. Chrome Backspace key returns to the main wydiwys page every time, with
   the expected result that wydiwys keyboard controls are gone.

Under Opera, the last slide (SWF file) shows up as garbage text, not the
pretty cross section rotation animation.  The shockwave flash plugin is
loaded and recognized (application/x-shockwave-flash, swf).  Maybe there is
a configuration swizzle that is needed.  A brief scan of the nets didn't
turn up anything. but I didn't spend a lot of time on it.

I tried the current stable Opera(9.6) on the Mac(Intel) machine, but the
result was worse.  One of the keyboard controls, or maybe the SWF load, hung
the browser on a blank page with wydiwys control gone.

All I have to go by is what people tell me. A company up north (I forget their 
name) said they repaired it by doing something to the bios. I got the 
computer back and it worked twice and then the old problem was back. I 
callled them and was told to take the battery out. This worked once. 

When the computer turns off it does so before anything comes to the screen.

Yes, but it may be hard to tell as this is a rather fast computer.

Do you mean that you took the battery out and put it back in and
booted, or just left the battery out and booted without it? If you
haven't done that, it would be worth trying, just take the battery out
and boot with just the wall wart, it could be a bad battery problem.

So you can't get to the bios. That's too bad.  Does it beep?

It could well be a motherboard problem, but it still might be some
kind of power problem. The battery could be causing problems, or the
wall wart is in trouble or ?, and as soon as the system needs a little
more power during the boot, like for spinning up the hard disk, it
kicks off.  Do you hear the hard disk start spinning?

Subject: [PLUG] Using YUM to install RPMs from a text file list
Message-ID: <da2207740907190223w3b9cc2d2lec376068705fb08e@mail.gmail.com>

So, I have Fedora 11 running in a VirtualBox VM.
I had it setup earlier, but somehow screwed it up and decided to just wipe
it and start over (its only a VM anyway).
Before I did, I created a list of installed RPMs (after installing many from
regular repos and RPMFusion), so I wouldn't have to go through manually and
reinstall them.

So I have a file generated by
$ rpm -qa > rpmlist.txt

So far I can't seem to find a way to have yum fetch and install the RPMs
listed in a text file.

My google fu so far hasn't come up with anything, but perhaps there is some
better way of wording it...
hopefully someone else has run into something like this.  Funny how I
haven't yet, though I have used Fedora since FC1, and RedHat 5-9 before that
(as in the old RedHat Linux, not RHEL)

In a nutshell I want to do something like this:

$ sudo yum install < rpmlist.txt

But that doesn't work, since yum isn't setup to directly take pipes or
redirects from command line.

Also note the package list has full RPM names, including version, so the
list may need to be trimmed or something to just the package names only.
(Ex... foo-bar-1.2.3-fc11.i586.rpm, and yum probably wants just foo-bar
only)

Any help, hints, nudges where to look, etc...
Thanks!

I haven't tried this yet Matt as I just installed Fedora last night but you
might try this.

cat rpmlist.txt |xargs

then copy the list and export it to a variable like RPMLIST

for i in $RPMLIST; do yum install $i; done

HTH,

Drew,

I don't think I would want to spawn a new yum process for each line though.
Yum isn't just the installer, that is what the "rpm" command is for (though
rpm only works locally).
Yum also fetches something if you don't have it, and it resolves
dependencies.
Thus I don't know if having it run on each line is a good way to do it.

I want to feed it the list of files, and have it run the whole list, and
download and install them all.

Maybe this method would work, but on first glance anyway it seems like it
would cause a massive system load trying to run yum for each line (there are
many many lines, not just a few or a dozen, but several hundred or more).

If you just give it a bunch of package names on the command line, it will
check to see if they are already installed, and if not, fetch and install
them.

Ex:

$ yum install foo bar baz xyzzy

Will check and install all four packages (foo bar baz xyzzy).

So now I have a huge list of packages in a text file, and want it to do
similar thing, without having to just copy and paste the huge list onto a
command line.  It sounds like it should be doable....

Good point Matt. I'm coming from using Slackware so admittedly I'm not used
to yum quite yet. Although exporting the list to a variable and just feeding
the variable name might work? so yum -y $RPMLIST  .. I'm installing KDE
right now otherwise I'd test this before just tossing it out there but it's
an idea at least.

Assuredly not. Yum package list updates alone are painful; the overhead of
invoking yum is kind of a bore, imhe.  Not sure what the op's package list
looked like, but I do recall yum requiring a hard first arg for local
packages. If you want to drag the package from the repo, sed out the
arch/version/.rpm stuff and get the raw package name. xarg those to a space
separated list for yum in bash. Or just sudo yum install apt (*debian fanboi
flames*)

those are backquotes.  if the file is too big the shell will whine so then 
you cat use xargs like:

xargs -n 100 yum install < rpmlist.txt

to use 100 at a time.

Here's how I do it; this way strips out the versions (only writes the
package name to the file) so that dependencies can work correctly even
if you haven't upgraded the source system for a while:

grab list of packages, minus versions:
# rpm -qa --queryformat "%{NAME}\n" > /tmp/rpmlist

install/update all missing RPMs from the list:
# yum install `cat /tmp/rpmlist`

Yum will take the version info if you needed.

If you're not already familiar with it, you may want to also consider 
the HDHomeRun.  It's a separate box with two tuners and an ethernet 
port.  I don't have any personal experience with it, but I'd certainly 
consider it if I were building a DVR.

There's also the HD-5500 from pcHDTV.  pcHDTV sells cards specifically 
for the Linux market.

I do not have the HDHomeRun, but after recently shopping it is at the
top of my list. The company totally supports Linux, plus it is
external. An external box simplifies a lot of things, including using a
remote control. It's more expensive than the others, though.

There is, at this point, no way to strip the version from the package
names. Yum will work with the version, though.

In the future, make your list using this:

$ rpm -qa --queryformat '%{NAME}\n'
 
The '--queryformat' is a very powerful option. You can also use
'--querytags' to list tags you can use in addition to 'NAME'. There is a
shorter alias '--qf'. For examples, you might want to look
through /usr/lib/rpm/macros.

Back to your original question, in addition to the highly-portable
'xargs', bash supports a nicer form of command substitution with the
construct '$(< file)'. (Look in the bash man page for 'Command
Substitution'.)

$ sudo yum install $(< rpmlist.txt)

You might need to filter out a few special packages, like 'gpg-pubkey',
since those are created by importing GPG public key signatures and not
actually installed as packages.

I used the 3rd ed. in the Java class at PSU and liked it. Bruce Eckel
has a number of books that are good and some of them are free, too:
  http://www.mindview.net/Books

It looks like the 3rd ed. is now freely-available
  http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/eckel/

I do not know and use Java well enough to be able to say to what degree
the 3rd ed. is out of date. I had to use it again recently in the
compilers class and did not have any problems with Java 6.

Sun also has tutorials that you can use too, if you can focus while
reading material on-line:

Thanks for all the replies everyone!

It is too late at this point to do the rpm query, though I will definitely
save that one for next time.
I had F11 installed in a VM, but since I messed up and gave the VM a virtual
HDD that was too small, I had to wipe and redo it.  I did a regular rpm -qa
> rpmlist.txt, emailed that to myself, and then wiped it.

I ended up just doing a copy/paste on the command line (using the list with
the version numbers), and yum chugged through it all, saying package xyz
already installed for a bunch of them (the list was a complete list, and the
new install already had a bunch of them obviously), but it did finally get
to the new packages, and installed them, about 600 or so.  It took a while,
but it did work.  I was concerned that bash would have crapped out (command
line too long), but it didn't.

These solutions here are much more streamlined though, I will save them for
next time for sure. :)

Using backticks ` or $() to surround the command so bash will expand the
file is what I was thinking of but couldn't remember how to do it.  Thanks!

It immediately makes a noise but I do not know if it is the hard drive or the 
fan, or both as it does move air. I bought a new power brick and a new 
battery and that changed nothing. I just tried to start it up as it has been 
some time and it actually makes noise for about 2 - 3 seconds before it shuts 
down, turns off. This is on wall power with the new brick and the battery out 
of the machine.

Thanks for sticking with me.

I think the only substantial criticism to this approach is that it can be
tempting to try to write the familiar thing in the same style as you wrote
before.  But, often the style of authoring needs to change with the new
language in order if you want to take advantage of the strong points of the
language.  In other words, I don't recommend translating the code "verbatim"
if you go this route.

The G4 iBook has Panther (10.3.9), not Tiger (10.4) as I said earlier.
 I tried these Firefox 2 and Safari (1.3.2).
 - Firefox 2 works as well as any that did work.  All keys respond as
documented,
   no response from mouse
 - Safari 1.3.2 did not respond to any keyboard commands at all for
WYDIWYS control;
   all documented keys seem to be owned by Safari for page history
traversal.  This may
   be configurable, but I did not chase that.

I agree that a solution in one language should typically use different 
idioms and paradigms than a solution in another language.  However, 
while learning a new language, most programmers are going to find that 
it is much easier to lean on familiar concepts "I know how to do this 
in language X, so how do I spell that in language Y?"  And, it's 
probably difficult to challenge yourself to pickup the new language's 
paradigms -- so you write C-like in Perl instead of using closures, 
objects, hashes, or map()s.

Particularly if you're solving a problem of your own definition rather 
than following a tutorial.  I typically learn new ways to approach 
things by looking at someone else's code.

Before you can use a language's strongest features, you probably need to 
solve some toy problems/tutorials to learn what they are.  Then go back 
to your largish-but-familiar problem and see how you can use those 
features more and how that changes your solution.

My two cents:  This sounds like my last two failures of my corporate 
laptops, both times it was the hard drive.  Got a knoppix disk you can 
boot from?  That will at least tell you the motherboard and the power 
supply are OK.

This command will give you a space separated list of all the RPMS
rpm -qa --qf "%{NAME} " > rpmlist.txt

This should pass the list to yum on the command line
sudo "yum install `cat rpmlist.txt`"

However if the list is to long it might exceed the length of a single command 
line, so it might work better to do a simple loop, like this
for line in `cat rpmlist.txt`; do sudo yum install $line; done

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu Hardy Analog Audio Line-in
Message-ID: <4A688E9C.9080501@comcast.net>

I'm not getting any sound from Line-in on my Ubuntu Hardy machine. It is 
possible I haven't tried recording audio from an external source since 
installing Hardy. I can't find the way to activate the Gnome mixer 
applet. The help page says, "To add this applet to a Panel, right-click 
on the Panel and choose Applets->Multimedia->Mixer" but Applets is not 
available in the context menu I get. I do have "+Add to panel..." but it 
doesn't have a mixer applet.

Now that I've found:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting#Getting%20Line%20Input%20to%20work%20(Microphone,%20etc)

I'm pretty sure I haven't recorded from an external source on Hardy, 
since I haven't seen anything like this before.

I have AlsaMixer running, and have enabled the Capture view. I assume 
I'm trying to use the Line input on the sound card. The Capture view shows:

                  
     0        0    ------  ------   ------ ------ ------   ------   
------ ------ ------ ------
3D Contr  3D Contr  Line    Mic     Video  Phone  IEC958   IEC958 P  
Aux   Capture Mix Mix Mono

I can toggle Line (and others) with the space bar to produce this:

                   L    R
     0        0    CAPTUR
3D Contr  3D Contr  Line  ...

but I don't get a level control above it. Capture does have a level 
control above it, but I don't get any sound. I have the headphone out of 
a boom box plugged in to the line-in jack on the sound card. At least I 
think it's the line-in -- the blue jack. (If the industry standardized, 
and if the image I found with Google agrees with my box, then green = 
headphone/speaker out, blue = analog line-in, and pink = mic in.)

Any assistance will be appreciated.

TIA.

I have personally never seen a hard drive failure cause a computer to 
suddenly shut off a few seconds after turning on.

Fedor nailed it. It's a bad board. He's going to need to buy another one 
off of eBay and replace it. However, there currently are none. This 
tells me that "likely" this is how most of these laptops fail, which is 
why you can't find any motherboards. The two "for parts only" Aspire 
1800's on eBay both indicate problems with the motherboard as well.

I would add with the parts you've bought already, if you buy one of the 
"for parts only" laptops on eBay you could have probably bought a new 
laptop with a 1 yr warranty. I would forget fixing this. Also, know that 
just about all the computers you look at in stores like Best Buy are the 
lowest quality manufacturing you can buy.

If cost is an issue then get what you can afford. If you want something 
that lasts, look at Thinkpads, Latitudes/Precisions, Apple, etc. Just 
picking one of those up you will feel the difference in quality.

To that list i'd add the Sager laptops based on Korean whitebox 
manufacturer Midern (the basic boxes are also filled out & sold by 
AlienWare and other high-end gaming machine retailers, for a higher 
premium). Great base hardware and option selections (display, video 
card, disk, ram, tv tuner, etc.), easily user-upgradable, decent 
warranty, and good customer service through 3rd-party online retailer 
XoticPC.

Best of all, you can buy them without an operating system!

i own 2 of 'em, one 4+ years old, the other just under 2yrs. The last 2 
or 3 releases of Ubuntu have worked nearly flawlessly, including 
hibernate/suspend and power management (though the older one has the 
usual ATI video driver issues).

Hello!

Replying to the text at the bottom of the page. I tried a Ubuntu disk as I 
just burned on on my desk system. I think it might have lasted a little 
longer before shutting off, the disk drive definitely lit up.

Thanks for the effort.

Dale

Message-ID: <20090723225520.4b21f2b6.johnxj@comcast.net>

I must use PSU's e-mail servers, even for my Comcast account, or I
won't be able to send e-mail when I am on campus.

Recent "upgrades" to the university e-mail system changed the maximum
e-mail attachment from 20 MB to 8 MB. 

Side question 1: How does this benefit the university? Doesn't the
entire e-mail and all its attachments merely pass through the
university's computers? Am I correct in thinking that the 20 ~ 8 MB
never resides on the university's servers?

This is seriously annoying to me. I cannot get files from my professors
because they are too big to pass through the university's e-mail
system. 

As a workaround, I am looking for web-based file storage sites. All I
have found so far are unacceptable.

Does anyone know of such a site (free) that does not require an e-mail
address so they can spam me forever with requests that I upgrade to a
for-pay account?

John,
Gmail should work but .. barring that I can set up webdav or ftp on my box
in a pdx colo for you if you want.

As an aside it probably has more to do with bandwidth than storage in the
case of PSU's change in attachment size.

I second the gmail suggestion. You get an smtp server you can use from
anywhere and you can use 25MB attachments

I do have a gmail account, which I use for various purposes. But in
order to send to it from PSU I have to send through the PSU servers.
Plus, even 25 MB is sometimes not enough.

I'd prefer a web-based thing like yousendit, sans spam and bs. And it
needs to be permanent, so I can explain to professors how to use it and
not have to change to a different servers a couple months later.

Really, they block the google smtp server. That's evil.

I used xdrive.com for a while, but I see now that it is shutdown. It
is not that difficult  to setup your own server for this type of
thing.

You are blocked from using the web interface?  You can attach a file directly to
a draft without every mailing it.

Over two years, off and on, I have tried to get the gmail web interface
to work. I can get my gmail messages in Sylpheed, but I have never
succeeded in logging in to the web interface.

Whoops, just got to your later message saying you have trouble with this. I
think it should be doable, but who knows what kind of black magic they do in
the IT department at the school.

I think I used the gmail web interface when I was at PSU for a meeting. I
remember I had to get one of the students to sign in to the network for me,
and then it worked pretty normally. YMMV, of course.

I've been using Mediafire (mediafire.com).  They have a free account with
minimal but adequate features.  They do require an email address, but I have
never gotten emails soliciting an upgrade, or anything else for that
matter.  I did uncheck the box in my account profile that says "yeah send me

that the transfers are relatively slow, not an issue for me at the moment.

I takes a little over 7 minutes to upload a 35MB file on my 894Kb (~160KB)
upload link.  I'm pretty sure the bottleneck is not at my end.

It looks like you've already joined the googleverse.  Have you looked

why not use yousendit with a throw-away email account?  they're not
going anywhere (ie teach once & forget) because people like my company
pay them and have been paying them for their service for years.  yes,
they are chatty to your registered email address (even as a paying
customer), but no, you don't have to read their crap!  if i knew
another service to recommend i would, but that one is easy to use for
recipients and is all i've ever used.

second alternative:  you run linux, why not ssh tunnel to a distant
system that can talk to comcast's mail server?  i'd offer to set you
up an end to that tunnel on my home (comcast-connected) always-on
machine, but i am moving in a month and will probably not be a comcast
customer anymore after that (and will anyway be down for a bit during
the move).

luck++;

One thing that was handy for me to get audio working was xlite
http://www.counterpath.com/x-lite.html . xlite setup records for 10 sec or
so and then plays back, then repeats.  It also showed some permissions
problems on /dev/dsp or some such.  It is a sip phone, but will help even if
you don't need a sip phone.

With Google you'll be able to send 25 MB attachments anyone who hasn't WAY 
overbought/provisioned their email server (like Google has) will reject.

I understand the desire to move large amounts of data around, but email is 
NOT the way to do it. Think of the literal bandwidth required for 
transmit/receive + CPU for virus/spam scanning (attachment goes through 
Amavis, ClamAV, Amavis, SpamAssassin, Postfix, and then if local Dovecot) x 
N users. And this may occur on more than the final recipient host, 
depending on server/farm config.

There are good rea$on$ server admins and IT Departments don't allow large 
attachments, unless they had money to burn when provisioning their email 
system.

drop.io is dirt simple to use, doesn't require any registration, and gives you
up to 100MB for each free drop. (And you can create as many free drops as you
have time to create. :)

Thanks for the tip. I created the free account and uploaded the files
that I needed get to fellow students. And yeah, it seems to be kind of
lagged. We'll see if they can download them.

For free storage less than 100 MB you might try drop.io

I did a cursory look at that domain's MX records and everything
appears fine. Their SMTP server is responding, the hostname resolves,
etc.

Can you check and make sure that you're not having resolution issues,
or perhaps old cached records, on your end?

   Thanks, Joe. No one's in their office this afternoon; I had called prior
to sending the email.

   They have a technical contact separate from their organization so I'll
send it on to him (as well as calling).

Much appreciated,

Rich

   I contacted their technical support folks (Matrix Digital Media in
Philomath), but they don't host the mail. The Association does and their
mail server is mis-configured. So, Monday we'll get it all straighted out.

Hello!

Today after several days of just having this dead laptop not work at all,
I tried to turn it on. The screen activated and the first screen that usually 
can up when it worked came up. It started to boot and then it all of a sudden 
went dead. 

I have a Knoppix disk in the cd drive, but while this was happening there was 
very little noise coming from the laptop. After it died I tried again and it 
almost went as long as this last time. I took out the battery and tried it 
again and it tried, but no go. 

Any thoughts out there. I think there is life here, how do I get it?

Thanks,

Dale

if no noise is coming out, maybe the fan is dead and it is shutting off 
from the heat sensors?

In which case, maybe you can boot into the bios. If there is a
temperature sensor monitor you can see what is happening there.

Dale,

I would suspect one or more of the system fans are either not  
spinning, or spinning too slowly for the system to stay running. Most  
likely the only way to check that will be to open it up and start it  
while it's open. My laptop has two fans, both of which have to be  
spinning for the system to boot fully.

It also could be dust bunnies which would have the same symptoms.

Stick it in a large zip-lock bag and then into the fridge. There
should be no problem going down to 32 deg. F but NO colder.
Do NOT stick it in the freezer!!!

After an hour or two see how long it runs before it shuts down.

It doesn't take very long for the CPU to heat up if the fan isn't
working or the heatsink isn't attached properly. This might give it a
bit longer running start. If you can keep it running long enough to
get into the BIOS setup check the temperatures (if it has such a
thing).

I don't know Aspire from Adam so can't comment on specifics. I have an
older Toshiba Satellite that would run from between several minutes to
several hours before shutting off for no apparent reason. A BIOS
update fixed it.

Good luck,

Neal

Are you saying that with the battery removed there was nothing at all?  
What is the measured output voltage of the battery?  What is the 
measured output voltage of the power supply?  Your symptoms are similar 
to another laptop I've encountered, and the problem was low output on 
the power supply.

Hello!

Sorry I was not plain, I do get excited.

The battery is fine, I know that. 

The hard drive could be bad.

It does not run long enough to get into the bios. I tried.

Any thing more, I really want this to work.  

Thanks,

Dale

Well, if you're sure the battery has a good charge, and you're sure the 
power supply is operating properly, try pulling that hard drive.  POST 
ought to detect that and complain, or it may simply try to boot the CD.  
If it is a heat issue (I can't imagine a CPU overheating in the first 
seconds of POST, but I'm not an expert), try chilling the laptop first.

You could also pull the CD drive and try to boot from a USB stick.

If you've managed to open the case you could try reseating the CPU and 
check any other socketed chips and connectors.

You can easily eliminate a hard drive problem by removing the hard drive,
and booting it up. It should get to a "Missing operating system" or similar
message. Not sure if that's been tried already..

Not to totally hijack this thread, but I have a laptop with somewhat
similar symptoms that's driving me nuts!

Sometimes it will run for hours, sometimes only a few minutes, and
sometimes it won't even POST.

It is an HP ZV6000 and I've tried updating every driver I can. Problem
is that it's running Windows, so I'm not sure how much is relevant.

Here's what I've done:

Replaced RAM (this was not part of the troubleshooting, but I had
ordered it just before the symptoms started, so I put it in anyway to
see if that would help. Nope.)

Then I tore the thing all apart and found wads of dust/lint buildup
inside on the heat radiating fins. I removed that and put it back
together. This made quite a difference and I was good for a couple
weeks.

It started to get worse so I went and got some heat sink paste and
re-did the CPU to heat sink connection. I didn't have any before, so I
just scraped some from the edges back to the middle. This again seemed
to help for a few days, but then it started failing again.

The past couple days it has gotten ridiculous, where it won't get past
POSTing or at the most it would fail after a few minutes. I got out a
couple live CDs and played around with them. Damn Small Linux ran
great on it for 45 minutes, so then I put in the Ubuntu 9.04 live
CD/installer. It got most of the way, and then started failing with
all kinds of errors about reading the media and sr0. I ran the CD
check from the boot menu and it reported that it was good. I decided
to try booting to windows, since DSL had done so well, and it worked
great. This was getting pretty late, and I fell asleep, but when I
woke an hour or so later windows was still up and running. Though I
had pulled out the wireless card, since that and the hard drive seemed
to be the only things that DSL wouldn't have been using when it was
working so well. So at this point I thought I had solved it and had a
bad wireless card.

This morning I tried Damn Small Linux again and it would get to
various points before crapping out. Though after 5 tries it managed to
boot all the way only to lock up on me after I tried doing much of
anything with it. So it's not the wireless card, I guess.

Could it be my fans? Is there any way to intelligently track it down?
I *really* don't want to just throw parts at it, that gets expensive
in a hurry. I have Hiren's Boot CD, but all the tests I've run on it
have passed with no problems, so it doesn't seem to be helping.

If anyone has any helpful pointers for what I should try next, I'd
LOVE to hear them. I'm willing to install Linux on it and destroy the
Windows that's on there if there are troubleshooting tools to use. My
wife used this for classes and needed some video editing stuff, so I
didn't really mess with it much, but we just got her a desktop to use
since this is failing all the time so now I'm pretty much free to do
whatever. (Though there are a few pics I need to recover from the
drive for her, first.)

At this point I don't even know what to Google to get a good answer.
I've tried various combinations over the past 3 months trying to solve
this and spent *way* too much time chasing dead ends. But we like the
laptop, so if it's still salvageable I'd like to try. I'm pretty
handy, but if the answer is the motherboard then I'm probably not
willing to put that much into it at this point. It's old enough that
if I have to spend too much money I should just get a newer model,
especially since OSU will require me to have a fairly recent one for
my engineering studies next year.

Thanks!!
Erik

Hello Erik,

Thinking about the symptoms you provided it could be multiple issues

1- Could be overheating issue
- Does your computer freeze after being on for certain amount of time?
- Dose it freeze when you load something on it, regardless windows or
linux..specifically Graphics (video etc,) that seem to put some load on the
cpu

2- Could be hardware failure
a) Motherboard
That will be an expensive part and you better of getting new laptop
b) Ram
You said you replaced the memory...
How many chips did u get? can u test with single chip at a time
c) Ram slot  (which i have suspicious that it is your issue)
In most cases could be slot # 1 or # 1 Try to test with a single memory chip
in every slot and see which one will fail and which one will work for you
d) CPU
That is expensive and you probably get new laptop better


Hope that helps,

Isaac

Thanks for the ideas!

It definitely could be something heat related. When it starts to fail
it will usually fail again soon afterwards - so remaining heat in
machine could make sense. Then when it kept working that night it was
a cool night, so that could have affected it.

I was having issues getting the new 1GB stick to play nice with either
of the 256MB sticks that it came with, so right now it is running with
just the 1GB. I can put it in the other socket, but over the course of
this whole mess it has been in both of them for a little while.

I believe that loading stuff on it has had the effect of shortening
the time it would run, but I have no hard evidence. It just seems that
trying to do anything with it will cause it to fail sooner. I am going
to keep playing with it to try to narrow it down, but it might take a
while. I like the idea of putting it in a bag in the fridge to see if
it works longer after it's cool.

Thank you,
Erik

It sure sounds like it.  Back when I troubleshot at the device level I'd 
search for a hot device and hit it with a burst of CO2.  If it started 
to work, I'd replace the device.  These days you can use an IR camera or 
other IR sensor to find the hot device, but unless you can replace the 
device you might be better off replacing the circuit card.

My partner uses the PalmOS program Unicycle 
(http://unicycle.sourceforge.net/) to log personal information. The palm 
is getting on in years and so before the information in the PDB file is 
lost, I'd like to find a way to port it to a more open format, such as a 
spreadsheet.

I feel like it should be easy, but being the novice I am, have no idea 
where to begin.

google turns up a bunch of loosely-related commercial solutions, but 
nothing quite on topic. I'm open to the idea I'm using the wrong 
symmantics, cuz I can't imagine I'm the first person to try to do this 
sort of thing.

Where can I learn how to extract information from a palm database file, 
for use in a spreadsheet, etc?

Thanks for any help

Asa

Hello!

Not nice to hear others have the same problem. The real problem is that it 
should work. It tries, but doesn't. I have tried everything mentioned so far. 
I even put the original disks in hoping they could do something. No luck.
Guess it goes back on the shelf for a while.

Thank you to all who have given their time and energy.

Dale

Stretching my memory from my long ago life with a Palm ... hope this 
isn't too far off the mark ...
The Palm database is printable as a text file (yes?)
The text file is fixed length (yes?), or can it be printed directly in 
CSV format?
... no matter ... if it can be printed to a text file, AWK or SED can 
easily make it a CSV file.
Once the data is in CSV format, any spreadsheet I know of can handle it 
(you mileage may vary).
Hope that helps

Fred James

Sorry again...what I pasted in the email I wrote is not what is 
here...so I will try typing it by hand and placing it in parenthesis to 
(hopefully) stop the email alien from doing this again.

(ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libstdc++/libstdc++-2.8.1.1.tar.gz)

Hope this works!

Yeah, that sounds good, but at the moment I don't have access to an IR
camera. I might be able to track one down through networking with
people, but that might take a while. I can't think of anything I have
that would be good at finding the problem by heat. Other than my
fingers... :)

I'll have to check around and play with it some more.

Thank you!

IR temperature sensors are becoming more and more commonplace. I used to
have one, and will again as soon as I have occasion to visit a place that
sells them. I think Fry's has them, for example.

Neither did I back then.  I didn't want to suggest fingers for obvious 
safety reasons.  However, I would hover my hand over the card.  If I 
found some heat I'd hover my finger until I found the part.  I never 
actually touched the devices.  At least not after the first time.

ODIN is one of the computer systems at PSU that the 
students have their school email accounts on.

Does anyone use fetchmail to get their messages off 
of ODIN?

It used to be possible to connect via secure imap,
but maybe it isn't anymore.

It appears with my cs.pdx.edu account that I can do 
a simple .forward file, but the ODIN system doesn't 
seem to pay any attention to forward files.

Thanks for the help Fred,
I am running into semantic fuzziness... when you say 'printable as a 
text file' I am unclear on what you mean. Opening the file in a simple 
text editor turns out characters I cannot make sense of.

?(+??-?a/??)/??0=?1K?H,Y?x.g??2u??3
?4??85??h6???7???8???9 
-- a bunch of symbols & letters with accents over them, for example.

there are snippets of plain english, which are notes saved within the DB 
file.

the person that wrote the program has the source code on SourceForge, is 
there anything in there that might help me "translate" it so to speak?

Thanks

Asa

There are other modules in that distro which provide higher-level access 
to common pdb's like memo, mail, datebook, etc.  They probably also 
serve as helpful examples.

Just before I went to look into this site, I noticed an icon that hadn't 
been in the upper right hand corner of the Gnome desktop. It's for 
manual network configuration. I don't think it was there before last 
night. And, just to the right of that one is the speaker icon which, 
when double clicked, brings up the Gnome mixer window. Sure enough, 
there was the line input, and it was muted. Something I did in the last 
couple of days must have caused those two icons to appear, and I just 
didn't notice it until last night.

Thanks for the idea, even though I didn't need to use it.

Subject: [PLUG] Alpha and ARC console...
Message-ID: <1248668967.4489.13.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I have a PC164 Alpha system, not the one that takes DIMMS unfortunately.
My system is just a 333 mhz box.  I have Windows NT 4.0 on it, though
that isn't very useful.  Can't get upgrades beyond service pack 3.

I also have Redhat Linux 6.2 installed.  Great, except this version of
Linux is quite dated.  Naturally, I checked out alphalinux.org and
downloaded the latest dvd images of Debian and CentOS for the Alpha
and lo and behold I can't install either one of them.  Uge!  To 
install an even semi modern Linux distribution on my Alpha, it 
appears that I have to install SRM console.  Where do I get that
from?  Will installing SRM console wipe out ARC console?  I use
milo to boot Redhat 6.2, but evidently the newer CentOS 4.3 needs
SRM console instead.  The README on the CentOS 4.3 alpha DVD is
pathetic, it says essentially that the maintainer doesn't like
to give instructions.  The Debian DVD has a doc that says something
about installing an older version and then upgrading that somehow.

When Alpha died out, what was the top of the line workstation?  I
know there used to be alpha servers that cost 1000s of dollars.

I'd like to have something better than Netscape 4.7.

How do I specifically find software for Windows NT 4.0 Alpha these
days?  How about software for Linux Alpha?

I assume by this you mean those IR temperature 'guns' type of thing?
Those that just have a number? I was thinking that something like that
wouldn't give you the resolution that a camera would by being able to
see the whole picture. I guess you just wave the thing around looking
for hot spots? I'll see if I can get one before I completely give up
on it.

I've played with it some more now. I've had it running DSL and it had
problems, so that takes both the wireless card and the hard drive out
of the picture, right? (Or does it use the hard drive for swap or
something similar? From their homepage it doesn't look like it.) If
neither of those is bad then it's either the fans or something
expensive, right? There's not a whole lot in there to go wrong except
stuff on the motherboard and processor. When it failed for me last
night it was after only a couple minutes, and before the computer even
finished booting. (It failed multiple times, but never quite got to a
usable desktop.) The air coming out of the fan ports, as well as the
whole laptop was not hot at all. This leads me to believe that it
isn't a fan problem.

Unless anyone has a strong feeling otherwise, it looks to me like this
is headed to be a parts laptop for my father, who has an identical
one. I'll still play with it a little with an IR sensor, but I'm not
very optimistic about getting it going again.

Thank you all for your time!

You are correct, that is what I'm talking about. If price is a concern, you
can feel free to buy one, use it, and bring it to me, and I will buy it from
you. It'll be just like if I loaned it to you. :)

A peripheral can cause problems even if it's not being used. The only way to

What you're describing is sounding less and less like a heat issue. But
again, the only way to know for sure is to check.

That's how I do it... when one breaks, I get another one of the same model
and have spare parts. I have had a lot of luck that way.

Also, I'll take this opportunity to praise Dell's Latitude D800 for being an
especially durable, good performing machine. They can be had relatively
cheaply now, and as long as you are not trying to play tomorrow's
graphics-intensive games on full settings, should keep up with most common
demands. It did play Doom 3 on full settings without a problem. Also, Linux
seems to support all the hardware without issue. It's very durable, as I am
generally rough on my equipment and this model holds up really well. I am on
my second chassis, on the lookout for my third. Best of all? The video card
is separate from the motherboard, which makes for a much cheaper repair if
that particular thing goes (which it does).

If you're creating the .forward in your home

Try looking into the webmail front end.  I seem to
remember there being an option there t set up a
forward.  There used to be people at the help desk
that could help with this sort of thing.

Message-ID: <4A6DDD9F.4030702@comcast.net>

Has anyone had occasion to convert a dvf file to something else--wav, 
mp3, ogg, something Audacity can use?

My wife transcribes interviews, some of which are done on Sony digital 
recorders. Her transcription software has a plug-in to deal with that 
format, and it works fine. However, sometimes she gets a file with 
background noise that makes it hard to understand some of the words 
being spoken. I could run it through gramofile or Audacity, but they 
don't deal with dvf.

TIA.

Dick,

   Typing 'dvf to ...' in the Google search window came up with suggestions
for translation to mp3 and wav (perhaps more, but those caught my eye). Some
are apparently commercial applications for Windows, but others might be
F/OSS. I didn't check.

I realized that my dad has an IR thermometer gun thing, so I can
borrow it from him next time I visit. Thanks for the offer, though! (I
probably wouldn't have been able to give it up once I had it,
though....)  :)

I had the wireless card completely out and still had a problem. I
haven't done the same with the hard drive, but I will in a few minutes
just on the off chance it helps.

That looks like a very comparable laptop, specs-wise, to what I have.
But unfortunately it's not quite enough. I am required to purchase a
laptop next year for engineering classes, and there are some minimum
requirements that I will need it to meet. Dual core and 2GB memory are
a couple of those. (Though I assume because people might need them for
Vista.) So if I'm going to spring for a new laptop at all I'm going to
get a more current one cause I'll need it soon for that.

Thanks,
Erik

I would be very curious to see how those apps stack up on the D800 vs. a
newer model with dual core. I have had this laptop blow away "newer" and
"more powerful" models several times. I understand that 2 > 1 (referring to
the number of cores), but I've seen it happen.

This model uses the Pentium-M (M for Mobile, I assume) architecture, which
at 1.6Ghz outclassed a P4 3.2Ghz in every benchmark I could think of. Also,
this thing does not seem to care about heat. I can leave it flat on a bed or
couch, sealing off the bottom fan vent, for hours at a time and it does not
blink. At least, not yet. I understand that heat damage is cumulative.

I realize that I most likely will not have the opportunity to see the above
comparison, but it's at least fun to think about.

I think Switch will do it, although you have to run it under Wine. Also, it's not FOSS. 

I think Sony offers a free converter but, again, only for Windows or Mac. Dunno if Wine can run it.

Yes. Switch will do it, but only the upgraded Plus version, which is not 
free.

They have a plug-in for Windows Media Player. I haven't seen something 
that does conversions, though. I'll have to do some digging on the Sony 
site and see what I can find.

Thanks for the tip.

I use google docs a bunch. And I like it. 

I got a buddy on the East Coast who writes fiction (he hasnt sold any and probably never will, but the stories are fun and I enjoy them). I suggested putting them on google docs so that I could see his updates easily. He says that by putting them on google docs he will lose the right to sell his first north american serial rights because the google EULA says that they own the that right for docs on google docs. I've read this EULA and the associated blogs and frankly dont understand it. 

Are there people out there in Plug land who know what's going on with google docs? With respect to serial rights, not copyright.

Thanks for the link. Yes, I've read this too ... my question is not about privacy. He doesn't care about privacy or at least accepts the google level of privacy ... what he cares about is still being able to sell those First North American Serial Rights (FNASR). 

Now the chances of anyone wanting to buy those rights is remote (being honest here, but good thing he's not on this list). 

Agents tell him that he can only sell those FNASR if the work has never been published anywhere else. I think that Google doesnt want or care about owning those rights. But then the real question is whether after using google docs he can still sell FNASR.

You can grab connectors at Frys and probably ENU just make sure your PSU can
handle the additional load.

I'm not a lawyer, but using Google Docs for the purpose for which it is

By connectors, he means splitters.

Thanks, all.

The calculator (http://www.schrockinnovations.com/powercalc.php) 
indicates about 365 Watts with the addition of the two drives and 
controller. Fry's is out of the way, and Free geek is open tomorrow, 
I'll check if they have what I need.

A .forward file in a users home directory is often considered a security 
issue.  Sendmail allows for specific directories to be listed where it 
will look for .forward files, hopefully odin has a configuration like 
that.  If you have access to the sendmail.cf on the server, look for the 
J option for where sendmail will look.

Good point, and I have suggested that to him. 

The reality, though, is that agents don't really answer questions from unpublished and unknown authors. They just present information on their website. 

I do like google docs and I think one of the neatest thing about it is the online collaboration it offers. For example, we at the local IEEE are developing an advertising policy. We are non-profit, but need to make some money for operating expenses. And so we do some analytics on our site and offer advertisement to users. Right now we have to have more traffic to justify asking for payment (ads are currently free), but in the interim we (our Exec Committee) are developing a policy ... payment, acceptable ads, a refund policy, etc. We set up a file on google docs to work through those issues ... much better than sending email back and forth. 

In the same sense my buddy is soliciting comments from friends and family. Google docs from a technical standpoint is excellent for this. But the EULA scares him. We've scoured the net and get lots of conflicting info. Now I personally don't think there's a snowball's chance of some agent taking a bite on some finished work of his, but he doesn't want to kabosh that possibility. 

I'm going to be at the GooglePlex in MountainView end of August and said I would ask around about this issue, but I'll be talking to devs and not marketing/legal types, so it's unlikely I'll get any firm answers. 

So I thought I'd bring this up on PLUG to see if anyone else has encountered this issue and has any experience or opinion. And I appreciate the input.

IANAL, but I'd say the answer depends entirely upon whether Google Docs
makes his text publicly available.  If so, that is publishing.  If not,
and possibly with appropriate safeguards both info-security and couched
in legal language, then... maybe not.

Your friend needs to talk with *his* lawyer about this.  Even if all he
spends to 'hire' that lawyer about this is a lunch, or round of drinks.

Subject: [PLUG] Another laptop buyer
Message-ID: <1248757735.7612.8.camel@UbuntuHH>

Folks, 

It's been just about 3 years since I got this dell e1405 w/T7200 core 2
duo CPU and it has served me well. Just tried closing the laptop, and
the screen holder just cracked weirdly. I've gotten it retaped and
screwed in place.

It doesn't affect the functionality of the thing, but I'm taking it as a
sign to at least get back up to speed on the latest in laptops.

For the writing/testing that I do, I need hardware virtualzation, which
is why I got this e1405 with the T7200 CPU / L2 cache of 4MB. Just
browsing a bit, I see all sorts of bigger numbers, and Es, etc. And I'd
much prefer to stay reasonably light (weight based on 13.3 / 14.5"
screens). 

I see some interesting laptops with the P8600 CPU, but am wondering
about the lower L2 cache of 3MB. Does that make a difference w/r/t
hardware virtualization?

Thanks,
Mike

Hello,

Just to put my Dell laptop repair experience into play here, what do you
mean "screen holder"?
Do you mean the plastic bezel that sits in front of the LCD panel?  If so
that part should be easy to replace.  On some models those tend to break
somewhat easily.
You would need to remove a number of rubber bumpers, then you can remove the
screws underneath, and replace the bezel (on most models, some don't use the
screws on the bezel just hooks underneath).

Or are you talking about the top plastic piece that actually holds the LCD
panel (the lid of the laptop)?  That part is also replaceable but is a bit
more time consuming to replace (you would have to remove the LCD panel
itself and swap it over to the replacement lid piece).

Replacement parts may or may not be easily obtainable through Dell itself
(assuming this is out of warranty situation), but should be obtainable
through other means also, such as eBay or Craigslist.

I haven't worked on the e1405 but I have worked on many other models in the
current and n-3 year lineup, including e6400/e6500, and tons of D620/D630,
and D820/D380 series.

If the screen bezel is the only problem, then buying a whole new laptop may
be too much.

However, if you are talking about the LCD screen itself being broken, and if
it is out of warranty (3 years sounds like it would be), then it would make
more sense to purchase a new (or newer used) one.

I don't know about the newer P8600 CPU so I'll leave that part up to someone
else... ;)

American copyright law is a bloated, convoluted, beaurocratic mess. If 
he's really concerned protecting his copyrights he really should contact 
a lawyer that specializes in copyright law. Here you're just going to 
get the opinions of random people who happen to like unix.


Do not be afraid to joust a giant just because some people believe in 
windmills.

Subject: [PLUG] Impressions of Mac mini...
Message-ID: <1248774522.5433.32.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I'm thinking about replacing an unpopular 500 mhz K6-2 Windows XP PC
with a 1.66 Ghz single core Mac mini.  It's a small box Mac with an
Airport, Mac keyboard, and Mac mouse.  It comes with 10.5 installed, 
but apparently the original OS was older than that.  I've been looking
on EBay where the price seems to be around $450 for a Mac mini.  I 
take it this computer has no ethernet port which bothers me since I
don't want it to be wireless.  Is there a version of the Mac Mini that
has an ethernet port?

I guess an alternative is to try Ubuntu out on the PC.  I got stuck
running XP because I needed the Administrator account to protect the
installed software and the usb sound card which is supposed to work 
in 98se doesn't.  I'm technically in spec for XP, but my Mom doesn't
like the machine where mom says she is comfortable with a Mac.

Cost wise there is a problem as this is technically a public computer
that is extra.  I'm finding that I want to be able to watch DVDs on the
box and add a USB TV tuner.  Mostly, this computer is supposed to
replace the gosh awful printed phone list that is scribbled all over.
Right now, it is slow enough that nobody likes it.  The current computer
should be fine for the stated purpose.

Since the PC is in a micro ATX case, I can't just throw a Windows 98SE
compatible sound card in.  Even in a micro atx case, the PC doesn't fit
very well in the cabinet below the telephone.  The Mac mini looks like 
it would fit under the answering machine.  My CTL 196UW monitor should
plug into the Mac mini no problem using the digital cable.

Spending $450 to go Mac seems like a lot for this particular machine 
and if the Mac is a wireless machine, that is not good.

I prefer not to go the 98se route.  Internet filters installed on a 98
system cannot be enforced.  Everyone is an administrator in 98se.  Oops!

Would Ubuntu run better on this old computer than XP?  I wouldn't be
able to play Warcraft II BNE, but at least I wouldn't have to buy a
new computer.  Does a Mac mini from those with experience using them
seem worth it to address space constraints and the need for a low end,
but not too low end, computer?  Is Ebay the place to go to get a Mac
mini cheap or is there a better option?

A few things to address...

First, the only Mac Mini available with a 1.66Ghz CPU is a Core Duo, meaning
dual core.
The was only one model with the Core Solo, single core Intel CPUs, and it
was 1.5ghz.
Lower than that were the PowerPC G4 models, with 1.25Ghz, 1.42Ghz and 1.5Ghz
CPUs (single core obviously).

The seller might be getting confused with the first generation "Core" CPU,
and the second generation "Core" CPU, wonderfully named, "Core 2".  So if
you see a Core Duo, it is a dual core CPU.  Core Solo is single core.  Those
are just first generation of the "Core" brand family (it is the next family
after "Pentium", they got tired of calling everything Pentium, since they
are on the 6th and 7th family series by now).  Core 2 Duo is second gen dual
core.  Core 2 Solo (haven't seen one) is single core second gen.
Mac Minis came in 3 models of first gen Core Solo and Core Duo, and then
several models of Core 2 Duo second gen.

Also, there hasn't been a desktop Mac that did NOT have an ethernet port
in... many many ages, definitely since the PowerPC G3 age.  PowerMacs,
iMacs, eMacs, Minis, all of them have ethernet, and recent models all have
Gigabit ethernet.  Same goes for laptops, but that is another can of
worms... ;)

Every Mini model has ethernet.  I don't know what the seller on eBay thinks
but they obviously don't know very much about what they are selling.  The
more recent models don't have 56k modem (maybe they are confused by the
missing RJ11 modem jack), but they do all have RJ45 10/100/1000bT ethernet.

For detailed specs on the 1.66Ghz Core Duo Mac Mini:
http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_mini/stats/mac_mini_cd_1.66.html
In particular see the section: Standard Modem and Standard Ethernet.

This model should support OS X 10.5 fine, and very likely should support
10.6 when it comes out.
For running 10.5 and 10.6 you probably want at least 1GB RAM or better.

You can also run Linux on them no problem.  Just need to work out the
bootloader.  I think there is an EFI GRUB.  EFI is what Intel CPU Minis use
instead of BIOS or OpenFirmware to control low level hardware.

I don't own a Mini but have used them at various times, they are a decent
machine, if you use them what they are spec'd for (i.e. don't expect to play
the latest games on them).

Also, have you checked Craigslist for more local prices?

HTH,

It's the bezel. The LCD panel is still fine, and I am typing this
message on that laptop.

The crack was actually caused by the bracket that holds the screw in the
lower right of the screen. I tried opening the laptop to about an 120deg
angle last night, perhaps a little too fast, but the bracket did not
follow. The screw stayed in place, but the bezel cracked when the
bracket stayed near parallel to the keyboard, opening a gap of maybe
1/4". (AFAIK, the e6400 is equivalent to the e1505, which is a bigger
version of the e1405.)

I realize that it shouldn't be too hard to replace, but it's been 3
years (the warranty was 2), so I'm just taking it as a signal to start
thinking about a new laptop. (Part of the bottom housing is also quite
worn; the left touchpad key hasn't "clicked" in nearly a year, but is
still usable.) I do want to have something in mind if/when something
more catastrophic happens. 

If you do have professional experience with such "housing" replacements,
I'd like a quote (offline if you prefer).

But I'd still also like comments on the lower level of L2 cache of many
current CPUs such as the P8600 (3MB) vs the T7200 (4MB), and whether
that has any impact on performance w/r/t hardware virtualization.

Thanks,
Mike

Having friends/associates read your yet-to-be-published work is common 
in the book world. When you open a book and look at the Acknowledgments 
section at the front, you are looking at a list of folk who have 
probably read some or all of the book before it was published. They have 
provided a critique of the work, and that is a plus to editors and 
publishers.

So, the key concept is the meaning of "published" to the publisher your 
friend ends up talking to.

IANAL either, but I'd expect that if I put something on my web site, 
linked from somewhere else on my web site, that would make the work 
publicly available, but if I don't link it, and send the url to a 
friend, then it isn't publicly available; it's privately available.

There is clearly no issue if he uses Google Docs and does not make his
document viewable by anybody and everybody.  You can selectively share
documents via Google Docs, so that only the people you identify can view
and/or edit whatever you share.  There's no risk that doing so would
have any impact on first-serial rights.  I think, also, that it is
extremely unlikely that making a story publicly available on Google Docs
would have any impact on first-serial rights, but if he's paranoid about
it you can at least assure him that limiting his works' availability is
perfectly safe.

First-serial rights are fairly specific and, for most fiction writers,
not really worth much in dollars.  At this point, only the New Yorker
pays what most people would consider real money for stories, and most
writers have about as much of a chance of winning the lottery as getting
a story published in the New Yorker.  Most other magazines, literary
journals, sci-fi magazines, etc., that publish any fiction at all pay a
nominal fee, unless the author is already well-known.  The value of a
first-serial sale for unknown or little-known authors is mostly
exposure, and resume-building so that the author looks more appealing to
a book publisher.  The days of competition among magazines for short
stories are long gone, as are the days when authors like Ray Bradbury or
Truman Capote could make some nice change from selling first-serial
rights even before they became famous.

There might be more of issue with electronic rights, but again I think
that's extremely doubtful even with a story that is publicly available
over Google Docs.  A service like Scrib'd might present more of a
problem, since that is more of a "publication" tool than a collaboration
tool (like Google Docs.)

Thanks. What you say makes perfect sense to me. 

My buddy hangs out with a bunch of writers and would-be writers. They've discovered word processing and Windows and struggle with email. It's nearly impossible to carry on a technical discussion with them. I stepped into this because he'd been sending stories through email to several people and then collating comments from several copies. I've had good experience collaborating on google docs for technical specs and opensource projects and suggested that (the privacy is not perfect, but it's pretty good), and it opened up a can of worms. At this point I wished I'd kept my mouth shut. 

This has nothing to do with copyright law as one person suggested. If you sell First North American Serial Rights, you still retain copyright. Apparently also some publishers buy FNASR and never publish the story, which is something I find hard to understand, but it happens. And you're right, they pay essentially nothing. As an unpublished author he'd be lucky to give his story away. 

The group he hangs out with discusses electronic publishing a lot, but no one understands it .... either technically or legally. 

I've read the google doc EULA (and pages of blogs about it) and I think it is contradictory. At one point they say they have the right to publish and in another place they say that right is only to allow them to present the work to you on google docs. 

I think if he really wants a definitive answer he has to see a lawyer (and pay). I gathered up the comments here and sent them to him. Thanks for the input; I think he's gotten about all he's going to get from us Linux geeks.

Hey, list,

This is kind of a pedestrian request, but hey, it's like 104 degrees outside.

I wanted to remove all empty files in a directory today, so I typed
this command:

  ls -s | grep -e '^ 0' | sed 's/^...//' | xargs -n1 rm -v

Then I was like, WTF, three pipes?  And I wondered how many variations
on this kind of thing there were.  There's also this one, which I just

 But maybe you have a better one?  Or if not, maybe you can share your

Andrew, I like your find command -- that's the most concise I can think of.
find, ssh, xargs, and the bash <<< redirect are all good for making concise
and powerful one-liners.

Here's another version of yours, though doesn't hit the hidden stuff:

find * -prune -empty -exec rm {}\;

Yeah, I like yours.  The find command is probably best.

I feel like my three-pipe solution is the beginning of a Daily WTF
article.  Like, here's how I sorted my ls output by size... with seven
pipes and 467 characters!

There's nothing like a good one-liner... except maybe a solid regex.

Copyright only comes into play in the sense that it is the copyright
holder who has the right to sell any type of publication rights at all.
With general-interest publishing, the copyright holder is typically the
author.  Unlike the recording or film/television industries, the
publishing industry doesn't claim copyright over works it publishes,
except in some more specialized forms (some academic or technical) of
publishing or work-for-hire situations, like, say, an author contracted
to write a Star Trek novel.

> The group he hangs out with discusses electronic publishing a lot, but no one understands it .... either technically or legally. 

They aren't alone.  Most people in the publishing industry don't
understand electronic rights.  The situation may be a bit clearer now,
but back when I was negotiating publishing contracts with agents,
electronic rights were a big black hole and often a source of
contention.  Some agents would insist on retaining them, even though
they couldn't say what electronic rights encompassed or what they would
do with them.  And publishers' subsidiary rights departments would
insist we try to obtain electronic rights even though they were just as
clueless about those rights.  Nobody knew what they were worth, but
nobody wanted to give them up in case they became important.  That made
it difficult to put a dollar value on them when trying to negotiate a
royalty advance.  The blind leading the blind.

I guess that's among the reasons so many things like this end up in
court.  Honestly, I'm not sure even a good lawyer well-versed in
contract law, EULAs, and publishing industry standards would be able to
give definitive answers to all these types of questions, because the
answers often are open to interpretation until pushes come to shoves and
judges are presented with cases that must be decided one way or another.
And even then, sometimes you end up with contradictory rulings.  So far,
the various forms of the GPL that have wound up in court have stood up
well, but that's no guarantee that they will continue to do so, or that
further tinkering with the GPL will lead to a case where some claims
made under it won't, one day, hold up in court.

Beware.  -empty is a stupid GNUism because the GNU people were

The *real* find is documented in:

Message-ID: <e64656920907301019u45875d50v8355782e40b507f3@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

I've been running my own home server for a while -- centralized
backups, IRC, fileserver, svn (now git) repo's, etc.  It was all fun
and games until I got married.

Now I'd like to consolidate my five home computers into one laptop and
possibly an Amazon EC2 instance or two.  Have any of you used EC2 for
revision control or S3 for backups, and if so, what's your experience
been?  I know RMS isn't into it
(http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/sep/29/cloud.computing.richard.stallman).

I could use shared hosting for some of this, but I'm tired of rolling
my own binaries and then figuring out broken dependencies when the
host does an upgrade.

I checked out the cost of running an EC2 instance 24/7 and it appears
to be less than ideal.  But am I right in thinking with a couple of
scripts I could launch and shutdown the instance whenever I needed it?

Andrew

Well, GNU find retains -size, afterall. I think it's more fair to call GNU
"reverse compatible" with UNIX. GNU is Not UNIX, though, lest one forget --
the project was kind to be rather explicit of that. These days I'd prefer to
blame UNIX for being old fashioned in these respects -- it's they who are
getting off-lined, not the Gnu kid.

S3 is fantastic for backups and its what I use for all my stuff. I am
currently using the python s3tools  http://s3tools.org/s3cmd for
managing this, but I hope to finish out my bacula setup soon enough. As
far as EC2 is concerned, it gets really expensive. You might want to
look into corenetworks.net. Thats who I use for my hosting.

I use EC2 and S3 at my company. It is pretty much like you describe. The
cheapest EC2 instance is $72/mo plus bandwidth usage.

S3 is great for cheap storage, as long as that's ALL you need - storage. If
you need URL rewriting or any other interesting features, S3 is not is.

For personal use, I have the cheapest Slicehost option for $20/mo and it
works just fine.

Fisticuffs should be unnecessary here - there is no *NIX that is UNIX!  
That has been a proud mantra for decades, and certainly has been proved 
by the various commercial versions out there.

visibility and optimization that we can run through Wordpress.

If you have an interest in this type of project, if you have some sites that
you've designed that we can look at, if you're interested in being paid for
your work [unlike the City's offer for their new site] and paid in either

Wrong.  The Unix trademark is still owned by the Open Group, and if
you're compatible with the Single UNIX Specification (from which I quoted
earlier regarding to find), you can call yourself "Unix".

For example, MAC OSX 10.5 *is* "Unix".  Officially.

I do apologize for any ruffled feathers.  My personal experience 
(Unisys, HPUX, AIX, IRIX), or my reading, would never have lead me to 
the thought that there is ONE UNIX, or that all UNIXes are compatible 
for that matter.  I am willing to stand corrected, of course.  And I 
would never dispute that there is or may be, but one UNIX specification.

Sorry. 'Linux' is needlessly obfuscatory terminology here. I mean to sed

   Now, does this reflect on the BSD rather than SysV origins for OSX?

Okay Postfix people...  If greylisting isn't doing it and 
spam assassin is missing a lot of junk, what do you do?

I suspect that viruses generate lists of email addresses somehow of 
potential customers who are susceptible to fraud and other things.
So how do you fight back?  How do you get off of the list?

My ISP Opus never seems to let spam through.  How does Opus manage
to stop more of this stuff than I do?

I'm getting a lot of you won, give us your personal information fraud
among other things.  I get emails that read like they are from some
uncouth woman who wants to have sex with me complete with a link to
a web site that looks like an online pharmacy.  I imagine what I am
describing is something that others have experienced as well.

I guess if a computer virus is causing me to get these emails from
infected computers across the Net that there isn't much I can do.
If I'm on some list, how do I get off?  I think a lot of so called 
lists harvest email addresses if you specify which one you want 
taken off.

Perhaps investigating where a link in one of these emails goes
makes things worse too.

I suspect that most viruses affect Windows, so being that I run 
Linux when I check email I figure I'm pretty safe.

One way to stop spam cold is to blacklist every possible email
source and only whitelist the ones that you know are legit, but
this breaks the way things are defined to say the least.  There
is also the risk that you won't let a legitimate email through
where the sender won't retry.

I want to clean it up, I just don't know how.  If only my email
servers could get smarter somehow every time someone spams me.

First, make sure you are training SA with sa-learn.

Next, I would look at the scores that spamassassin assigns to the "false 
negatives".  If they are close to your spam threshold you might be able 
to tweak the required score.

I also use the local.cf config file's "rewrite header" feature so that 
the spam score shows up in the subject for those that SA catches.

"rewrite_header Subject *****SPAM(_SCORE_)*****"  this makes it easy to 
see/sort/examine how the spam is being scored.

I have also found that many spammers are really stupid and put easily 
identifiable words, links or praises in their messages.  There was one a 
while back that was offering "bacheelor" degrees, for instance.  Some 
simple filters in the local.cf file can take care of those:

rawbody FHH_NO_BACHEELOR        /\bbacheelor|bachellor\b/i
score   FHH_NO_BACHEELOR        5.0
describe FHH_NO_BACHEELOR       Fake Bachelor Degree

or

header  FHH_12                  Subject =~ /\bBrazil Land Rush\b/i
score   FHH_12                  6.0
describe FHH_12                 Contains reference to Brazil Land Scam

If your volume of mail is high, searching the message body can impose a 
significant load on the server so use these carefully.


Also look at header_checks, body_checks in /etc/postfix

Using these methods, I was able to cut my spam volume down to one or two 
per month from literally hundreds.

Hmm.  Maybe what I'm really looking for is a cheap VPS paired with S3
for storage.  Thanks for the tip.

Thanks for the lead on Slicehost.  I'm also checking out OpenHosting's
Linux KVM option, which looks pretty sweet.  Both are about the same
cost at $20/mo. for the level I'd need.  Considerably cheaper than
EC2.

You don't get off of spam lists once you're on.

Through a whole big bag of tricks that change over time, I'm sure.  If
your mail server white lists IPs based on stuff like SPF and DKIM,
then it can more aggressively greylist or blacklist other IPs.  Then
there's secondary DNS checks and finally the more accurate bayesian
filters that can be applied.

I've never been impressed with spamassassin myself.  It always struck
me as a system with far too many levers and buttons.  The average joe
has a tough time tuning it and full email content filters should never
be tuned by humans.  They should simply be trained through machine
learning.  Anyway, I digress...

What it comes down to, is if your full time job is to filter spam, you
get pretty good at it.  If you don't have that much time to put into
it, then stuff is going to get through eventually, since spammers are
always changing their tricks.

You actually read your spam?

Yeah, it does.  I've often been burned by people who blacklist all
DSL/cable modem IP addresses.  I've finally managed to get good DSL
provider who sets my reverse DNS now, so that helps a lot, but if
receiving legit email matters to you, you have to be careful.

Yes, exactly, this is the biggest challenge.  My view on it is that
full bayesian content filters (DSPAM, crm114) are by far the most
accurate methods of filtering.  If properly trained, they can be
incredibly good.  However, these do suck up a lot of CPU, so you need
to use some level of border filtering such as {grey,black}listing in
order to save bandwidth and CPU, but don't be too aggressive with
those, otherwise you won't even know what you're missing.

Note that Bayesian filters must be trained.  There are many ways to do
this.  For me, when I receive a miscategorized message, I forward it
to one of two email addresses on my server that processes it as spam
or nonspam, depending on the mistake my filter made.  I use CRM114 and
I can share with you some scripts for it off list if you like.

good luck.

Subject: [PLUG] Virtual memory fragmentation and Linux
Message-ID: <4A7319D5.9030907@gmail.com>

All,

I'm looking for info on virtual memory fragmentation on Linux. I have 
come across a few articles indicating that processes on Windows that 
malloc/free memory all the time will fragment the memory until no 
contiguous memory is available and the process will receive an out of 
memory error.

Although the malloc/free memory call is made at the process level, would 
Linux face the same limitations, or does the way Linux handles virtual 
memory alleviate this problem.

thanks,

I don't have any good references handy, but here's how I understand
it:

malloc(3) and friends are largely implemented in userspace.  Whenever
more memory needs to be allocated, brk(2) or sbrk(2) is called under
the hood to extend the data segment available to malloc.  So from a
virtual memory space perspective, this system is certainly susceptible
to memory fragmentation.  I'm sure malloc tries hard to avoid
fragmentation through smart algorithms and such, but diabolical cases
most certainly exist to diminish the usable contiguous space.  Of
course it's always possible that malloc will actually go through the
effort of defragmenting the data segment if some big chunk of memory
is requested, but surely that's avoided when possible.

Note that there are many different implementations of malloc and more
recently, a lot of tweaking has been done in various settings for
security reasons to help mitigation heap-based buffer overflows.  Some
implementations use mmap(2) under the hood in conjunction with
brk/sbrk.  This allows malloc algorithms to eliminate some internal
fragmentation by allowing external fragmentation in virtual memory
space (i.e. separate mmaped segments need not be mapped contiguously
in virtual memory space).

I did just run across this thread, which may be helpful:
  http://fixunix.com/unix/84604-memory-fragmentation-malloc.html

In the end, the nice thing about malloc is that it's just a library
function in user space.  You can always implement your own version if
some special case of fragmentation is biting you.

HTH,
tim

i don't think anyone local would have much on hand.  they'd have to order 
it.  urs or graybar.  and they mostly deal with two post telco style 
racks.

one place online that has pretty good stuff is:
http://starcase.com/

depending on how you ship things, you can get one that breaks down into 
nice simple pieces.

Subject: [PLUG] Syllable for old computers...
Message-ID: <1249095016.3729.9.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

It seems to be limited in application support, no openoffice :-(

However, the requirements to run Syllable are remarkably minimal.

A Pentium 60 with 32 megs of ram will apparently run Syllable.

If someone would port a simple spreadsheet application and a word
processor to Syllable, it would be more useful.

I have a computer that is awfully slow for XP where it's purpose
mainly is to replace printed phone lists.

There is a syllable server that is evidently a trimmed down Linux
distribution.

I wish everything Syllable is based on was under the GPL and the LGPL.
At least everything it is based on is free.

I started checking out Syllable at the 0.6.4 release.

Anyways, does anyone follow Syllable closely enough to know where it is
going, who uses it, what it is useful for, etcetera?

I've had very good service with vpslink.com out of Seattle. Their xen vps
slices are great. Cheap slice from them is 6.95/mo if you buy a year..
7.95/mo otherwise.. 64mb ram, 1.5gb storage, and 100GB per month bandwidth..
I host 2 wordpress blogs, 4 other websites and vpn server and it runs like a
top..using nginx, mysql, php-fastcgi, openvpn and sshd.

of course they have more extensive services as well..
