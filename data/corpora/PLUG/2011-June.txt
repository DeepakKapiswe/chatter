That part is OK -- I'm electronically replicating the "print it out, 
sign it, scan it in, email it" routine with new contracts.  All I need 
in the end is a facsimile of the original document with my signature 
attached, that I can email to a client.

Message-ID: <4DE65E28.3020702@wescottdesign.com>

I'm looking at a data sheet for a transistor with Evince, and it's 
rendering Greek letters incorrectly.  Lower case mu is rendering as an 
infinity symbol, and upper case omega as a vertical line.  Fortunately 
there aren't any others in there to confuse me, at least at the moment.

Presumably this is because the font used isn't stored in the pdf, and 
whatever is default on Ubuntu 10.04 is different from whatever is 
default on Windows.

Has anyone else seen this effect?  Is there a way to fix or work around it?

If it's a unicode font then it's possible that the version supplied with 
Ubuntu is wrong, or incomplete. I had the problem with a different 
program rendering some unicode text as a hollow box. I found 
code2000.ttf, which contains a huge number of characters and symbols.

Tim,

Look at the earlier posts where I said, in scribus, you don't open the pdf,
you insert it into a new document as a graphic.

Look at the properties of the file and check the font information. That
may tell you what font it is looking for. Then you can just install
that font, restart Evince, and it will probably work.

I use Evince on occasion, but Okular is far more fully featured.
Usually I use Adobe Reader. I also have the free versions of Foxit and
Cabaret for Linux, although they are usually the last ones that I try.
When one doesn't work or let me do what I want, I try the others. So
the first thing I would do with the data sheet is try opening it in the
others. 

This is also what I would do with your PDF that Scribus won't open. If
anything else will open it you can always save a copy and, if that
doesn't work, print to Postscript or PDF. If you print to Postscript you
can open the .ps file in Okular and then save as a PDF, although Scribus
will happily open a Postscript file, sometimes better than a PDF.

If none of that works, and the files are under 8 MB, send it to me and
I'll see what I can do with it. I can't receive attachments over 8 MB,
so if they are bigger you could post them on Dropbox or somewhere.

I typically use xpdf to view datasheets.  I don't recall having any 
issues, or at least not recently.  Can you supply a link to the 
datasheet or the vendor and part number?

Further disclaimer ... my latest running version is Mandriva 2008.0, as
I wasn't impressed with either 2009 or 2010 (personal opinion there, so

So if you want live/install you can only get 32-bit. If you want 64-bit
you have to download the 4 GB DVD, and it's just install, not live,
right?

Subject: [PLUG] LAN broadcast?
Message-ID: <4DE70DCF.1020905@pacifier.com>

I have a question about user applications using broadcast on a LAN.

I usually have several processes that connect via TCP/IP to a central 
server that solves some optimization problems. In more demanding project 
that I am working on now, I hope to distribute the optimization problem 
between 24 to 36 helper processes.

At the start of each optimization job, I will have a few data files that 
need to be distributed to each of the helper optimization processes. 
Rather than have the central optimizer / server send these files 24 
times, some way to broadcast these files to all machines / processes at 
the same time might be nice.

Is that the kind of thing that broadcasting could accomplish?

And if so, and in a big picture way, how would one do it?

An example of my network topology would be:
TCP/IP server @ 192.168.1.40
4 helper processes @ 192.168.1.40
4 helper processes @ 192.168.1.41
4 helper processes @ 192.168.1.42
4 helper processes @ 192.168.1.43
4 helper processes @ 192.168.1.44
4 helper processes @ 192.168.1.45

Thanks for looking.
Wayne

You could use broadcast, yes.  Most likely you would want to use UDP
for this, since TCP handshakes and broadcast doesn't really mix.  To
accomplish this, you would simply have each helper process listen for
the broadcast messages and then send results back to the central
server at the server's unicast address.  

However, a "sexier" way of accomplishing the same thing would be to
use multicast.  This would allow you to distribute the broadcast
messages scalably across router boundaries.  Multicast is really
powerful for specific applications like this and I hope it catches on
some day, since it can completely replace distribution models like
bittorrent.

Finally, instead of implementing all of this distributed
computation/communication yourself, you might consider using an MPI
library or even building a BOINC application.  Or maybe you don't need
to go distributed at all for the scale of your project by instead
leveraging the massively parallel processor you probably have in your
system (a.k.a. your video card).  See OpenCL.

HTH,
tim

I have found that in most enterprise environments, network admins have 
shutdown multicast at the routers. One of the applications we work with 
uses multicast for data sync, and invariably we need the network guys to 
open up multicasting across subnets.

Not sure if it's a concern for the project you're working on, but if you 
go that route I would check with the network guys.

Not surprised. I couldn't see a way to broadcast using SOCK_STREAM. 
Googled all over trying to find an example. Does it follow that since I 
would like to use SOCK_STREAM for the rest of the communications during 
the optimization job, the multicast side would need to be on a second 
network interface?

No network admins here. Simple little LAN in an industrial environment, 
half a dozen hex-core Linux boxes, a couple of 3D imagers and some 
ethernet I/O.

Yes, of course. It's not just a live CD, it's also an install CD. So if
I like it I can just install it.

All the other distros that have live/install CDs make them available in
both 32- and 64-bit, unless it's a distro that only comes in 32-bit.

Honestly, I've never implemented anything with multicast.  It is just
a neat way to efficiently distribute traffic.  

I've done a little digging, since this is something I want to learn as
well, and I believe you just need to set some socket options which
instruct the kernel which multicast groups you want to subscribe to.
Then in the background the kernel will notify the appropriate routers
what group traffic you should receive, etc.  I'm a little fuzzy on
what group you would want to pick for simple local experiments...

In any case, it shouldn't require using a different interface.  You
just subscribe to and then bind to a multicast group address and then
receive datagrams on that socket.  Separate unicast sockets can be
used on the same interface.

Here's a few links I found helpful:

Yes, filtering or failing to distribute IGMP is probably one of the
biggest roadblocks for multicast.  There needs to be some killer app
for multicast to be written to get admins to support it.  A lot of
online music streaming services could benefit from it a great deal.
It would also help ISPs to minimize traffic associated with this and
other live streaming apps, including MMORPGs, etc.

This project looks like it might help  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GridFTP
I have never used it, but apt-cache search shows there are Debian
packages for it.

The real question to ask I think is where is your bottleneck in the
computation.  What should you optimize first. If you are going to
distribute the computing,  are you transferring large amounts of data
to the nodes or just small datasets. Do the nodes take a long time to
do the computation compared to the data transfer? If so, maybe you can
make more progress optimizing the computation than the data transfer.

They do something like that on large compute clusters, using MTFTP, UFTP
or UDPcast (I think- I've been out of the loop a while).  For a cluster as
small as yours, I suspect it's not going to help much.  If the files are
big enough for it to make a difference, they're probably too big for
reliable multicast distribution.  Better to make sure you have a nice
healthy gigabit backbone, and perhaps let the hosts pull their files over
NFS rather than pushing them.

Can you comment on the nature of the compute problem?

Since I would need to select a multicast class D address for the 
multicast interface, I was wondering if I could use (TCP/IP) for the 
second socket on that address / interface.

Thanks you very much for your links. The C code example is great.

Time available is such that I could send all 24 to 36 distributed 
processing helpers the files individually at the start of each job, but 
if there was a easy way to send all the same file at the same time, I 
would have . Jobs occur a the rate of a few / minute and I would like to 
get the answer in a few seconds.

I see that GridFTP is on top of FTP which is a client / server paradigm 
that it uses TCP/IP.
Is GridFTP intended for many sources of data to one receiver?
Or many receivers from one source of data?

Unquestionably, the optimization.

For sure. That is how I came to distributing the optimization.

I have been exploring some sort of broadcast or multicast. If it wasn't 
difficult to implement and keep synchronized, I would consider it. Your 
question is insightful, the optimization is where the time is.

Again, thanks very much for your reply.

can you copy/paste the entire input and output of the process of changing

can you try changing another (known-working) user's password in the same way

The compute problem is testing various products such as posts, poles, 
blocks for a stud mill, etc., that can be removed (bucked) from a 
tree-length log (stem), and selecting the most profitable solution. The 
stem is scanned as it passes length-wise through 3D LASER scanners. 
Products are trial placed into the stem and evaluated to make sure that 
the product meets a number of criteria such as diameter, crookedness, 
taper, etc.

I have this software running very successfully in a sawmill with simpler 
conditions - shorter logs, fewer products, etc. That software running in 
a single process on a uniprocessor machine finds a solution in 1 - 2 
seconds.  We process somewhere around 10 stems / minute.

The conditions for the next application are longer logs, more products, 
etc. The number of solutions go into the millions and the testing / 
optimization process takes minutes. I need to solve several logs / minute.

I think I can divide the optimization process into zones and distribute 
the stem scan data, the current products desired, their values and 
requirement, etc. to multiple optimization helper processes and get the 
job done quickly enough. The scan data derived from each stem needs to 
be disseminated before any of the helper optimization processes can 
begin. The dissemination needs to begin immediately following imaging.

The dissemination of scan data and current product information is the 
task for which I was thinking about some sort of broadcast / multicast. 
But if multicast is any sort of hassle, or there is a latency to "pull" 
the data, it isn't worth it.

Silly question -- what version of Red Hat (RHEL 5 defaulted to MD5
crypt, RHEL 6 uses SHA256 crypt).

That sounds like an interesting/challenging/fun problem.

How big is the scan data set?

Multicast shouldn't create any lag in acquiring the data.  I expect
the subscription process would happen only at startup, not between
jobs.  However, for your purposes, you might just be best off using
broadcast if you don't expect you'll have to send data between
subnets.  You could always switch to multicast later with relatively
few additional code changes.

Aleksey Tsalolikhin, aleksey at verticalsysadmin.com, made us an 
outstanding offer to introduce us to Cfengine version 3 the weekend 
following this year's USENIX conference.

    Introduction to Automating System Administration with Cfengine 3
    Presented by Aleksey Tsalolikhin
    Saturday, June 18
    9:30 am to 11:30 am (gather between 9:15 and 9:30)

    Hosted by Galois:
    421 SW 6th Ave (Commonwealth Bldg, between Washington and Stark)
    Suite 300
    Portland, OR

Galois' offices are locked, and on the weekends the building elevators 
require a combination to reach the third floor. So we'll meet in the 
lobby between 9:15 and 9:30 and then I'll escort everyone to the 
office. I haven't figured out arrangements for dealing with people who 
are unavoidably delayed.

Afterward, feel free to join us for lunch!

Some notes on our location for folks who rarely venture into this part 
of town:

Since it's a morning meeting, I'll note the local coffee shops:
  * Starbucks (in our building), at 6th and Washington
  * Peet's, just around the corner at Broadway and Washington
  * Spella Caffe, on 5th between Washington and Alder

We're right on the transit mall, two blocks north of Pioneer 
Courthouse Square, so it's quite easy to reach our building by train 
or bus.

There's some on-street parking in the area, but it's sometimes hard to 
find an open spot even on Saturday mornings. In that case, there's a 
parking garage just across Washington from our office, though its 
entrance is on Alder, between Broadway and 6th.

IIRC - the on
street parking in that area doesn't allow the time needed for the full
session.? 
I would recommend the 10th and Alder Smart Park which costs
the same as street parking, you only pay for what you use and there is no
danger of getting a ticket.

Logitech HD720P was a reasonable price, worked out of the box with Ubuntu
10.04 With Skype video Conference we only had to find the correct sound
source.   I'm not a 'techie' at 64, but I do a fair amount with computers
and the sound thing was pretty easy and straight fwd to resolve.

I know I saw a list at the time, but don't remember where.   Probably in the
Forum Pages?

Larry,

   I'm not looking for a Web camera that sits on the monitor, but a portable
one I can use on project sites and other captures.

Some years ago I had luck getting video off a Sony Handycam using some
command line tools (dvgrab?).  Used the firewire interface.  That
particular camera is totally antiquated now, but I expect firewire
stuff works pretty much the same in modern devices.

It seems like you have 2 questions here:

a) what linux software is good for accessing recorded video from the camera?
b) any recommended camera models for linux compatibility?

my thoughts on these 2 questions...

a) there's tons of good video-editing software, and tons of how-to 
articles for editing after you've copied the media to the pc.

as far as pulling the media from the camera, which seems closer to what 
you're asking, i suppose it depends on how you want to approach it and 
what the pc and the camera support. it would probably be done either as 
a file-copy through a storage format that both support (SD card, DVD, or 
internal HDD of camera that the linux pc mounts as external storage 
device) or through video-capture on playback such as you would for a DVR 
HTPC machine. i'd think the former would be easiest and most common.

as for software that would automatically prompt you to import the video 
when you plug in the camera, like fspot does for digital cameras, i've 
got no idea, and would personally consider this more of an annoyance 
than a benefit.

b) not sure if there's a comparable library for video-camera support, 
but when i'm looking for digital photo-cameras, i check the libgphoto 
compatibility list.

as mentioned above, i think you just want to look for a camera that 
saves the video on an internal HDD/FDD or an SD card that is 
transferable. Linux is pretty good in my experience about recognising 
storage devices connected through USB, even if it doesn't recognise the 
exact device type.

hope that helps somewhat.

But watch out for the speed of the SD card. I have a class 2 card that
works great for playing mp3s in my phone. But I have read notes from
still camera users who found that they needed class 10 cards in order
to be able to shoot continuously - the camera couldn't write the
previous image to the card fast enough. 

I don't have any idea how fast the card needs to be for digital video,
but don't just buy the cheapest SD card without checking first. The
price of SD cards goes up according to capacity and speed class. 

I'd also suggest checking the SD card slot in the computer. I have a
card reader in my Thnkpad, and it reads SD cards fine, but when I try to
write to the card I get "the media is read-only." That is with two
different SD cards from different manufacturers. My phone writes to the
card fine, however, so the problem is in the SD card reader in the
Thinkpad and/or the driver in Fedora 14.

John,

I have a still camera (Canon) the instructions for which warns against
formatting or even writing to the card from a computer. I have the
impression that the camera formats the card in some special way that
computer writing might mess up. Hence I only write to the card from the
camera.  Perhaps the "read-only" warning is for your protection.

Dear elcaset, 

Are there any discounts available to user groups, or do you need to be a
USENIX member?

Thanks,
Mike

This is it! Today is June 6, and it's the last day to sign up for the
Exhibit Hall for free.

It's also the last day to get early registration prices in case you're
rich enough to pay for a real pass.

Dear Peter, 

I'm following up on Chad's suggestion that PLUG members attend your
conference. As I asked Chad, I ask you:

Are there any discounts available to members of a user group like PLUG,
or do you need to be a USENIX member?

Thanks,
Mike

When you say sign up for the exhibit hall, are you only referring to folks
who are setting up a table there, or just admittance?

Thanks,

Just admittance.  There is, I'm told, a rather long waiting list for
setting up tables.  Personal Telco is on the waiting list.

Subject: [PLUG] Looking for a Simple Way to Send SMS to a Group
Message-ID: <BANLkTincRkN-NZv0h06qS5L2oYPcojDr6A@mail.gmail.com>

I have a club softball team, and we are going to nationals at the end of
June. We communicate very well using an email list, but when we are on the
road not everyone has access to email. I am looking for a simple way to

A. allow a member to send a broadcast SMS to everyone in the group. Not all
members have Internet services on their phone, so email is not an option.
B. allow a member to send an sms to a subset of the group, or an individual
member of the group.

I thought of this scenario, but it seems rather clumsy:
For A:
1. Use a google voice phone number as the broadcast number
2. have google voice send the sms message to an email address
3. have a python script forward the email via each carrier's email to sms
email address
For B:
4. modify the python script to look for a tag in the sms body (e.g.
"to:sammy"), and the just send the sms message to sammy, not the whole group

I am sure there is a better way to do this. I only need this capability for
10 days, so I really don't want to spend a lot of money on it. My users are
not technically savvy, so signing up for a twitter account is probably more
effort than they want to expend. If I give them a phone number and say "Send
text messages to this number", they will probably do it.

Thanks for any suggestions you may have!

Mark

Maybe a quick php script to send mail to the sms gateway for the phone providers? I can send sms msgs from email via 5038675309 at sms.sprint.com... most other phone carriers offer the same service, u just have to research what the sms gateway is, and know the carrier for each number in your group.

sorry... i just re-read this from my computer instead of the phone and 
realized that my suggestion was essentially what you described. i did 
some testing though, and this phone at least will let me send an sms msg 
to an email address and it delivers fine, showing as coming from 
[myphonenumber]@messaging.sprintpcs.com. you might be able to cut out 
the google voice step from your proposed process if folks can send 
directly to an email. not sure if my phone/carrier is an exception in 
allowing this, but it could simplify things if it's common to your group.

g'luck!

If you're able to add each phone to the google voice account, I
believe you can have SMSs go to all the selected phones, removing the
hacking on your end with the burden of doing the authorization
handshake with each phone.  Which way to go depends on how easily you
can produce correct python and how many people you need to SMS.

If you were going to be in India you could use google smschannels, but
it only works for Indian mobile numbers.

   Has anyone here switched from OO.o to LibreOffice? Is there a downside to

   From one comparison I read it appears the fork is based on personality
difference, but I may well be mistaken in my impression. I know that Sun
Office is a commercial product now owned by Oracle, but I thought that OO.o

   Since I'm having problems printing envelopes with OO.o-3.x I thought I'd
give LO a try to see if it does better.

Denis,

Since it's almost been a week, if it was found it was likely turned
over to CPSO.  Here's their Lost & Found number: 503-725-4435.  If
they haven't seen it, you might try calling the CAT Help Desk, as they
may or may not have taken it up to CPSO: 503-725-5420.

I did about two months ago based on a recommendation of a friend from 
the user group in North Idaho.  He had switched when the first 
non-beta/non-RC version came out.  Late 2010.

I've noticed some performance increases.  The fork came about because 
(my take from the postings on the LO list) of SUN's then Oracle's 
reluctance to accept input from non-SUN/non-Oracle developers.

Don't know of any changes as regards to envelope printing.  I've never 
had much luck even with Asterisk (not the PBX software) or OOo. But the 
up side was it was a fairly pain less upgrade.  I run CentOS and ran 
into two issues.  I had to uninstall OOo and several of the Gnome file 
associations required resetting.

Rod,

   Looks like a familiar story.

   I'm downloading the SlackBuild source now. I can run them in parallel, but
suspect I'll just replace OO.o once I know files are properly converted.

   I had no problems printing envelopes on my LaserJet 5 until OO.o-3.x. Then
it stopped working.

   Perhaps I should subscribe to the LO mail list after I install the
application and try printing an envelope with it.

Thanks for the insights,

Rich

   I've been reading "Gnuplot in Action" and posted messages on the gnuplot
mail list, but I've not found answers to my questions. I have a basic plot
that I want to export as a publication-quality .eps file using the TrueType

   If you have extensive experience with gnuplot I'd like to share my data,

prevents the Palatino typeface from being used for the plot title and the
labels on the axes.

i've been using LibreOffice since a Debian/Ubuntu repository was 
available for it. It's faster and no more buggy than OO.o, also the 
ui/icons are spiffed up a little bit. It's still a dog, imho, but is 
good enough, enough of the time, to give it the disk space. The 
compatibility with MS Office 2007 .docx and .xlsx files is all but 
nonexistent, and the presentation program still chokes on the simplest 
PowerPoint files. It's not business-class interoperable with MS Office.

Harumph :-)
Joe

Joe,

   That's interesting. What I read in the comparison is that LO has better
support for M$, particularly the newer versions.

   Since I process words only infrequently, and when conversion from and to
Microsoft is necessary, I don't really care which one I use. Most of my
writing is with LaTeX/LyX.

Thanks,

Rich

The reasons for the fork were not personality, rather, it was Oracle's
purchase of Sun that spurred the move. However, there had long been
discontent among developers with things that Sun was doing. The Oracle
deal was just the tipping point.

I haven't switched. Part of the reason for that is that my (dim)
understanding is that LO is built basically on the Go build of OOo.
According to the spin on LO's website this gives LO "enhancements." But
Go left a bad taste in my mouth more than once. Frequently there were
features that were disabled. Sometimes they were trivial, but still
stupid. For example, in OOo 2.2 after saving a file the Save option in
File > Save was no longer grayed out. It was explained to me that the
Go people decided to disable this because MS Office doesn't gray out
the Save button, and they wanted OOo to look more like MS Office. How
stupid is that?

Another case was installing OOo in Fedora from the repositories,
another instance of the Go build. Later I discovered that Autocorrect
had been completely removed. I was told that the Autocorrect feature
contained proprietary code from Sun and Fedora refused to include it.

I have long read the OOo e-list, and I continually see the gurus
suggesting that a user's problems would be solved by installing the
real OOo instead of the version in their distro's repositories. There
is no love lost on the Go builds.

The Autocorrect experience was the last straw. Ever since I have used
only the version from OOo. Everything works, and if it doesn't, I know
exactly who to blame.

I suppose eventually I'll go to LO. But I'm in no rush.

Oh, and I can print envelopes to my Laserjet 4+ without a problem. The
Laserjet 5 is not very different. If you think it might be a driver
problem, I wonder what would happen if you installed the driver for the
4+.

I do admit that after upgrading recently from 3.2.1 to 3.3.0 there has
been an issue with printing, i.e., when printing multiple copies
collated of a print job with an uneven number of pages it starts page 1
of the second job on the back of the last page of the first copy.

   Back when OO.o first came out I tried to make the point that making it
Just Like Microsoft was a losing proposition. Why would anyone change if
there was no benefit? They had to pay for Office anyway so there was no
incentive for them to change. I lost that discussion. Looks like the
developer mindset is still stuck in reverse gear.

   I cannot stand autocorrect or on-the-fly spelling checks. They distract me
and break my concentration. I edit when I'm finished writing.

   It's the standard printing interface (CUPS). Makes no sense to me why it
no longer works ... only fails with envelopes.

   I get that with 3.2.1 since my printer has the duplexer attachment. I've
learned that on multipage documents to print them one at a time.

Yep, i'm a LyX convert for writing anything longer than email, thanks to 
you, Rich!

For collaborative projects when the source doc is MS Word, i bite the 
bullet and use MS Word in VirtualBox. i can't believe i've been using it 
(many different versions on DOS, Windows, and MacOS) for over 25 years.

I haven't converted yet, but gather third-hand that many of the original
OOo developers have moved to LO. So longer term, I'd expect LO to exceed
the quality of OOo.

Thanks,

Mike,

   I'm patient. Since I process words infrequently I'd just like to figure
out how to once again print envelopes and be able to translate documents and
spreadsheets to their open format equivalents.

Thanks,

Rich

Rich,

I almost never use word processors of any sort -- they give me
hives.  However, a while back I did manage to coerce OO.o Writer
into printing envelopes.  The trick for me was finding the
Envelope function in the menus.  I found it and lost it again a
couple of times.  It's buried near the bottom of the "Insert"
main menu item.  Why, I don't know.  I don't think of inserting an
envelope into a document. And OO.o's help function was most
un-helpful. Oh well.

Anyway, select "Insert -> Envelope...", and you'll be presented
with the Envelope dialog, which is pretty self-explanatory.
You'll likely have to tinker with the Format controls a bit, to
make things look right, but the main thing is to set the size
format to the envelope you're using.  I have an HP LaserJet 1300,
so I feed it one envelope at a time, face up, long ways, with the
opening to my left.  In the Printer tab of the Envelope dialog I
chose the Envelope Orientation button on the far right (the arrow
points to the top of the envelope) and "Print from top".  Click
the "New Doc." button, and you'll be presented with a page showing
your envelope.  Hit "Print" and away you go.  

Hope this helps,

--Dale

I can't help with the googling, but I do know a few things about Adobe
font naming. I mean, the old Type 1 fonts, which adhered to an 8.3
format; the new OTF fonts use a real filename so there is little
difficulty in figuring out what the font is from the filename.

The following examples will give the gist of how the system works:

	awbi____.pfb	Adobe Caslon Bold Italic
	tibi____.pfb	Tmes Bold Italic
	tir_____.pfb	Times Roman
	gay_____.pfb	Garamond Expert Regular
	hvbo____.pfb	Helvetica Bold Oblique
	zd______.pfb	Zapf Dingbats

First, underscores are used to make each filename a full eight
characters plus a three character extension. Each filename begins with
a two- or three-letter abbreviation for the face.

Note that "i" and "o" are used for "italic" and "oblique" respectively,
which are not the same thing, although both are slanted.

Similarly, "r" is used for "roman," but if the ordinary version of the
face is called "regular," there is no letter. E.g., the abbreviations
for the full set of four fonts for Adobe Caslon are aw, awi, awb, awbi.

The "y" indicates an expert set. 

At one time I had a paper document from Adobe explaining the system in
detail, but the document now lives in the sea of lost data. All that
remains are the parts that are still in my own memory.

Most important: Install Fontmatrix. (In the repos for most distros.)
The first tme you run Fontmatrix it will go out and find all the fonts
installed on your computer. Then, for each font, it will display the
name of the font, a graphical view of the glyphs, and the filename,
complete with path. It also has many other utilities and functions.

If you don't have that file, it appears you can also run the strings

All,

Thank you for the responses.
The issue came to a head when I figured out that my /home partition had 
become corrupted (?).  Permissions were a problem, couldn't install 
other distributions...fortunately, it didn't take too much copy time to 
insure all files were to be had on the other laptop.
Formatting and a fresh install cured the ails.

Subject: [PLUG] Google searches redirecting
Message-ID: <4DF57E0F.8020506@robertmarktech.com>

All,

Don't know how this happened, but recently when searching on google I 
would put in a word (after an initial search query and a returned 
listing), say foo, and then hold the right shift key to start a double 
quote, and google would flash something under the search box and then 
redirect to the default google search page.

It drove me absolutely insane because the message flashed too quickly to 
read and then the redirect would occur. I'd be in the middle of typing 
in my query and, BAM! back to the search page.

I googled for the problem and nothing came up. I'm running Chrome 
11.0.696.71, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. Anyone else seen this behavior. You 
simply need to search for something like foo on the default search page, 
then when the query returns, select in the search field and hit the 
space bar. Then hit the right shift key and hold for a second or two, 
then the redirect occurred.

I finally was fast enough to do a screen capture and read the message 
"Google instant is unavailable. Press enter to search. Learn more". I 
disabled google instant search and the problem went away.

Has anyone else seen or can replicate this behavior, or did a fubar 
something on my machine.

thanks,

I've had had much better results with Firefox.  Firefiox wins for
reliability & anonymity. Maybe someday Chromium, or Chrome will catch up.

ANNOUNCEMENT: PLUG Advanced Topics June Meeting

IPv6 Networking with Ted Mittelstaedt: Part 2

The second in a multi-part series on IPv6 networking by Ted
Mittelstaedt, the author of The FreeBSD Corporate Networker's Guide.

Part 2: The shifting paradigm of how to firewall with IPv6.  With IPv4,
just about everyone uses NAT as a poor-mans firewall. They don't have to
think about port numbers and the like but they will with IPv6 because
dual-stacking is going to be the standard in how it's implemented.

This is a rescheduling of the May event that Ted could not attend.

Where: Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Avenue

When: TUESDAY, June 21st, 7PM

!!! REMINDER !!!

Aleksey Tsalolikhin, aleksey at verticalsysadmin.com, made us an 
outstanding offer to introduce us to Cfengine version 3 the weekend 
following this year's USENIX conference.

     Introduction to Automating System Administration with Cfengine 3
     Presented by Aleksey Tsalolikhin
     Saturday, June 18
     9:30 am to 11:30 am (gather between 9:15 and 9:30)

     Hosted by Galois:
     421 SW 6th Ave (Commonwealth Bldg, between Washington and Stark)
     Suite 300
     Portland, OR

Galois' offices are locked, and on the weekends the building elevators 
require a combination to reach the third floor. So we'll meet in the 
lobby between 9:15 and 9:30 and then I'll escort everyone to the 
office. I haven't figured out arrangements for dealing with people who 
are unavoidably delayed.

Afterward, feel free to join us for lunch!

I know this is a Linux group but I also know that there is a bunch of

Made a small web site that is not on my server - just a bunch of html 
files and links.
Simple enough - point the file manager (on Linux and on XP) at the 
index.html file, tell it to open and it works just fine - all the 
browsers worked fine, navigate around just fine.  That is until I try it 
with Internet Exploder 8 on XP.  IE will not follow SOME of the links 
but will follow others.  In the document, the links look like 
../../index.html  when I hover the mouse over the link, it looks like: 
file:///D:/STAGES/DVD/index.html  IE cannot figure that out (however 
Firefox  can so I know the code is good).  My guess is that there is a 
setting somewhere in IE that is "protecting me from internet evil" - and 
also protecting me from doing what I want to do.  I know this is 
possible because I have seen web sites that run stand-alone from DVDs 
(which is what I ultimately want to do).

Anybody got any help here?

I've been fighting this all day and it is driving me straight to the

Hi Michael,

I was wondering if PLUG had taken into account Free Geek's new hours
for the next meeting.  As of tomorrow, Free Geek will be open from
10AM-6PM, Tuesday through Saturday.

Depending upon the scope of the project, there are a lot of embedded
web-site options that you might want to look into. For example, the
one I've used a lot is TiddlyWiki:

http://www.tiddlywiki.com/

Though, I'll admit I generally start with one of the templates from
http://www.tiddlytools.com/ which come pre-loaded with various plugins
(as I find the stock TiddlyWiki to be rather spartan). Even more
plugins, themes, etc can be found from the TiddlyVault:

http://tiddlyvault.tiddlyspot.com/

I've used TiddlyWiki for things *like* what you're describing, and
even for full-fledged websites (for example, I used it when I uploaded
the former Open Source work from a company I used to work at to
SourceForge, http://leftovers.sourceforge.net/ )

If, however, you need something more specialized, then TiddlyWiki
might not be what you're looking for.

That's not what I am looking for - I just want a simple set of web pages 
to be run off-line from a CD/DVD so they can be accessed where there is 
no internet connection.  Like I said, this works fine with Firefox and 
others - just not with IE.

Subject: [PLUG] cinelerra on SuSE (or any video editing software)
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1106132043010.2373@grond.sourballs.org>

Anybody here have experience with Cinelerra?  I have the need to edit a 
bit of video (a .mov file), and I've downloaded Cinelerra from the 
OpenSUSE 11.3 repositories.  Everything seems to install ok, but when I 
type 'cinelerra' on the command line, I get:

  Cinelerra 2.1.5CV  Packman build (C) 2010 Heroine Virtual Ltd.
  External ffmpeg
  Compiled on Mon Jun 13 13:43:54 UTC 2011

  Cinelerra is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License,
  and you are welcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under
  certain conditions. There is absolutely no warranty for Cinelerra.

...then a blank 196 x 196 pixel window pops up.  The contents of this 
window are not refreshed, such that anything dragged over it remains 
painted there.  Nothing else happens.

This is not at all what the install HOWTO
( http://www.g-raffa.eu/Cinelerra/HOWTO/installation.html ) would lead me 
to expect, so it seems as though something very fundamental is wrong here.

If anybody has any experience with this package that might shed light on 
what it is doing, or expects me to do, I'd be very grateful to hear it. 
Conversely, suggestions for other video editing software would be 
considered also.

Thanks in advance-

When I last monkeyed with Cinelerra a couple of years ago (and in a
different distribution) I encountered quite a few problems as well.
Basically, I could never get it to work.

That being said, have you heard of Kdenlive?
http://www.kdenlive.org/

It has a *really* active development community, and worked for me "out
of the box". However, be aware it's not intended to be as feature rich
as something like Cinelerra. Also, I've no idea how many formats it
supports, or even if it supports the format you're looking to edit
(though, it also uses ffmpeg). But for basic editing, it seems to work
quite nicely.

I just searched the main mailing list, and I didn't find anything about an
OSCON discount this year.  Not to worry, though.  At my request OSCON gave
me my very own discount code to share with my several hundred closest
friends.  They tell me that the discount code of "Martin"  (no really --
they said it was simpler just to use my name) will get you 20% off any of
the packages.  Registration at:
https://en.oreilly.com/oscon2011/public/register.

Have fun.  Hope to see you there.

   Just to satisfy my curiosity, what might cause a web page to not load in
firefox while I can successfully ping the URL?

   The site will probably become available later today, but if it's not
responding to the browser requests I'm surprised it acknowledges the pings.

Rich,
The ping response simply indicates that the network is up.  The server 
could be running just fine but the site might be down/turned off/whatever.

Rich,

Ping is on an ICMP port.  The webserver is probably looking on port 80 
or 443, if it is up at all.  You could interrogate the 80 port to see if 
the site is answering with telnet <site> 80.

Thanks, that seems to be working much better.  Still haven't figured out 
most of the bells and whistles, but it runs, loads my files, and produces

Oddly enough, this is the original purpose of Twitter... to burst SMS
messages.   It's just that most people don't use the SMS side of twitter
any more.  But you can public post, group post, or send individually by
SMSing the twitter server with prefix commands.

Turns out the problem was Msoft's proprietary MOTW which forces local 
files into a protected zone and causes other mischief.  Pages generated 
with my web editor worked but not those that I built/modified mostly by 
hand.  It's all in (a) the headers; and (b) xhtml.

Thanks to everyone who responded, all is working now and I think I have 
a recipe to avoid future problems.

!!! TOMORROW !!!

Aleksey Tsalolikhin, aleksey at verticalsysadmin.com, made us an 
outstanding offer to introduce us to Cfengine version 3 the weekend 
following this year's USENIX conference.

      Introduction to Automating System Administration with Cfengine 3
      Presented by Aleksey Tsalolikhin
      Saturday, June 18
      9:30 am to 11:30 am (gather between 9:15 and 9:30)

      Hosted by Galois:
      421 SW 6th Ave (Commonwealth Bldg, between Washington and Stark)
      Suite 300
      Portland, OR

Galois' offices are locked, and on the weekends the building elevators 
require a combination to reach the third floor. So we'll meet in the 
lobby between 9:15 and 9:30 and then I'll escort everyone to the 
office. I haven't figured out arrangements for dealing with people who 
are unavoidably delayed.

Afterward, feel free to join us for lunch!

   Why not have fathers bring in their non-computer brats? It's Father's Day
and those dads could use a break.

Subject: [PLUG] USB Serial Port Adapters
Message-ID: <4DFBE520.8080209@wescottdesign.com>

Is there a way to map specific USB serial port adapters to specific 
device names?

As far as I know, as I plug USB serial port adapters into the system 
they'll appear as ttyUSB0, ttyUSB1, etc., in the order that I plug them in.

But I want to have them show up as "ttyUSBcamera", "ttyUSBdata_aq", 
etc., or something similar -- so that when I plug in a _specific_ 
hardware device, it maps to a specific device in the /dev directory.

Is there a way to do this?  Looking at lsusb for the devices (all FT232 
at the moment, but who knows?) the only unique thing is the serial 
number.  Is there a configuration file that I can use to associate 
hardware serial numbers with specific devices in my /dev directory?

Thanks.

Tim,

   Yep.

   They tend to appear as pairs; e.g., ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB1.

   I used to have /dev/pilot defined for syncing my Palm (now Treo 700p), but
that went away with the advent of udev. However, hardware does show up on
consistent devices. For example, jpilot is set to connect on /dev/ttyUSB1,
my thumb drives are defined in /etc/fstab as:

/dev/sdb         /mnt/thumb       vfat        noauto,users,rw  0   0
/dev/sdc         /mnt/flashdrive  vfat        noauto,users,rw  0   0

which depends on which USB hole I use for it.

I think you misunderstand.  I did an experiment: I started with my Fax 
modem and the board I'm developing plugged in.  I did ls /dev/ttyU*.  
Then I unplugged the development board and did ls again.  Then I plugged 
in a debugger that has its own USB serial port adapter, and did ls 
again.  Here's my results:

tim at servo:~$ ls /dev/ttyU*
/dev/ttyUSB0  /dev/ttyUSB1
tim at servo:~$ ls /dev/ttyU*
/dev/ttyUSB0
tim at servo:~$ ls /dev/ttyU*
/dev/ttyUSB0  /dev/ttyUSB1

What _did_ happen is that at different times the same device -- ttyUSB1 
-- got mapped to different physical devices.  That is what I _do not_ 
want to happen.  What I want to happen is to plug in the development 
board and have /dev/ttyUSBdevelop appear, and to plug in the debugger 
and have /dev/ttyUSBdebug appear (or some similar me-defined mapping).  
Different devices.  Different, _unique_, identifiers.

Otherwise, every time I plug a bunch of stuff in to the machine, I'm 
going to have to do a bunch of hand work to figure out what ports map to 
what devices at the moment.

Thought 1:  If you can use CLI (command line interface) to determine 
what you need to know, then a (BASH) script can be written to do that.
Thought 2:  If a device can be identified (example: ttyUSB1 is the 
debugger), then it can be mounted to a directory (example: ~/debugger)
Thought 3:  If 1 and if 2, then the two can be written together in a script.
Does any of that help?

udev rules are flexible and very powerful. Here are some of the things 
you can use rules to achieve:

    * Rename a device node from the default name to something else
    * Provide an alternative/persistent name for a device node by
      creating a symbolic link to the default device node
    * Name a device node based on the output of a program
    * Change permissions and ownership of a device node
    * Launch a script when a device node is created or deleted
      (typically when a device is attached or unplugged)
    * Rename network interfaces

Here is a link that gives an example of this exact situation.  The example
shows using a FTDI chip and having the UDEV rule compare against the serial
number of the device so it should work for specific devices.

OK this is timely.. my Ubuntu 10.4 desktop just decided to throw its casters
in the air.  Booted it today and it came up fine. It had not been up for a
while so it wanted to apply updates. I told it to reboot and now its kernel
is in a panic about not finding the VFS blah blah blah.

Is this fixable without wiping the HD and rebuilding the box? If it's not, I
can just rebuild it. If it is I'll give the gurus a the clinic have a shot
at it.

Thanks

Message-ID: <000e01cc2ea0$d4452c90$7ccf85b0$@gmail.com>

Will there be another clinic hosted by PLUG in the near future?
I have an LXE vehicle mount terminal that I'd like some help with.
I kinda threw out my back on Friday, and it's heavy enough that I' don't
really want to lift it today.
I looked at the Free Geek calendar, and they don't list today's clinic, or
any others.

Sorry if this is the wrong forum or format for my question, I'm new here.

Thanks!

Terrific!

No applications or approvals are required. Just show up.

According to <http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html#about>, it can
...
"

udev rules are flexible and very powerful. Here are some of the things you
can use rules to achieve:

    * Rename a device node from the default name to something else
    * Provide an alternative/persistent name for a device node by
      creating a symbolic link to the default device node
    * Name a device node based on the output of a program
    * Change permissions and ownership of a device node
    * Launch a script when a device node is created or deleted
      (typically when a device is attached or unplugged)
    * Rename network interfaces

REMINDER: PLUG Advanced Topics June Meeting

IPv6 Networking with Ted Mittelstaedt: Part 2

The second in a multi-part series on IPv6 networking by Ted
Mittelstaedt, the author of The FreeBSD Corporate Networker's Guide.

Part 2: The shifting paradigm of how to firewall with IPv6.  With IPv4,
just about everyone uses NAT as a poor-mans firewall. They don't have to
think about port numbers and the like but they will with IPv6 because
dual-stacking is going to be the standard in how it's implemented.

This is a rescheduling of the May event that Ted could not attend.

Thanks.  This is exactly the guidance I was looking for.  My preferred 
terminal program doesn't seem to understand links to devices, but I'll cope.

... and I figured out my terminal program.  It doesn't _see_ links, but 
it can _use_ them (and if I get my serial settings right, things even 
work! :) )

I had some cheap usb-serial adapters which didn't report their serial 
numbers, but I did find that I could map e.g. "3-3.4:1.0" from 
$(basename $(dirname $PHYSDEVPATH)) from my udev scripts as long as 
they were always plugged into the same port.

Subject: [PLUG] Setting permanent eth0 IP address in Ubuntu LTS?
Message-ID: <3A36EE7C28EC41A0B3580E55A1D2A374@tsharplesoffic>

Hi, I've run into a (documented) bug using the Network Manager GUI to try to 
set a static IP eth0 address in Ubuntu : the "apply" button is always grayed 
out so it won't let me set the address no matter what I do.  Is there a 
command-line shell script or file I can edit to get this set up? Ubuntu is 
very foreign to me (I use slackware) and I'm loath to screw something up on 
a system that's going to a customer.

Thanks,

Tom S.

You can edit /etc/network/interfaces to define all the parameters associated 
with a particular port.  For example:

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
    pre-up /sbin/modprobe ipv6
    pre-up /sbin/ip6tables-restore  -c < /etc/network/ip6tables.rules
    pre-up /sbin/iptables-restore   -c < /etc/network/iptables.rules
   
    address 69.33.100.126
    netmask 255.255.255.248
    network 69.33.100.120
    broadcast 69.33.100.127
    gateway 69.33.100.121
    
    dns-nameservers 69.33.100.122 173.230.152.5 66.80.130.23
    dns-search jamhome.us, michaelsnet.us
    
    post-up /sbin/ip -6 addr  add 2001:470:e953:cafe::46/64 dev eth0
    post-up /sbin/ip -6 route add default via 2001:470:e953:cafe::42

Subject: [PLUG] ubuntu 9.1 sound quit
Message-ID: <4E021325.8030001@pacifier.com>

Sound on a Ubuntu 9.1 disk quit some time back.  I think it quit after I 
used the disk in a computer other than the one that I installed on. My 
guess is that the wonderful world of automatic stuff attempted to adjust 
to the other motherboard, could not, and has disabled the audio.

Every time I use that disk, I have to manually turn on the audio via 
System->Preferences->Sound, uncheck the "Mute" box and slide the volume up.

Does anyone know if there is a file for audio configuration that one can 
edit and fix this? How about completely eliminating the file so the 
automatic stuff will recreate it?

Before telling me to just forget it and upgrade the installation or wipe 
clean and reinstall (a Windows type solution, seems to me), I like 9.1 
much better than 10.04 or 10.1.

following in a secure way?

Do not try this unless you are SURE you know what you are doing!

WARNING MALWARE WARNING MALWARE WARNING MALWARE WARNING MALWARE
XXX     http://74.53.12.233/bbermoaen.php?bCIDID=Y1aly     XXX
WARNING MALWARE WARNING MALWARE WARNING MALWARE WARNING MALWARE

This came in an email from a friend, whose machine is very 
likely 0wned.  It may exploit a recently discovered firefox
pointer bug.  I'm wondering what it does.

Again, unless you have a machine you can afford to lose, and 
can take apart the malware and see what it does, don't run this!

Is that the pop up window that warns you that your machine is 
infected and trys to get you to purchase their program to remove the infection?

Hmm. The IP is from a cloud computing hosting company in Houston. If they have customers hosting malware, that's probably against their TOS.

   On the Toshiba running Xubuntu (10/10?) the trash "folder" in ~/pamela

try to move them elsewhere? I think they've been there for a few
distribution versions.

Just guessing, but it appears that the user 'pamela' once tried to copy
some system files and directories and did not specify a destination, so
they were copied to the ~/pamela directory, then they deleted those and
that moved those files and directories to the ~/pamela/trash directory.

I'd just delete them all with rm /home/pamela/trash/* . Even if any are
links to real system files and directories, that should just delete the
links after asking for confirmation. Once you see that, you can Ctrl-C,
then use rm -rf /home/pamela/trash/* .

HTH,
Robert

   Quite likely.

   I'll look again today at this; I don't remember why I didn't delete them
before.

   Will report back with results.

   Now I'm reminded why I did not remove these files before. In
/home/pamela/.local/share/Trash/Files/ are what appears to be the entire
system; for example, I see directories for /Xll, /cups, /dbus.

   No directory is a link, and none of the files in these directories is a
link. When I run 'find' on a file I see they're also where they belong
(e.g.:

   find / -name xkb

/home/pamela/.local/share/Trash/files/Xll/xkb
/var/lib/xkb
/usr/share/X11/xkb
/usr/share/xfce4/xkb

   That the files in her home directory are not softlinks is my concern about
deleting the entire files/ directory.

Advice?

Rich

wes,

   Thank you. I decided that even if the files are hard links, they are still
copies of the files in the / directory tree. They are also of older
versions. So, after upgrading the system I deleted all files and rebooted.
It works fine.

   How she managed to copy / to ~/pamela/.local shall forever remain a
mystery. But, I did free space on the hard drive. :-)

Thank you,

Rich

Are you sure that *none* of the directories in the Trash chain, i.e.,
/home/pamela/.local ,
/home/pamela/.local/share ,
/home/pamela/.local/share/Trash , and
/home/pamela/.local/share/Trash/files , and the subdirectories there,
are links? I'd do ls -al on all of those (piped to less) to make sure.

Deleting a hard link or a soft link just deletes the link, I believe,
not the file linked-to. I just tested that on my system here, but YMMV.

I'd pick a file with a unique name in /usr/share (something that doesn't
look important) and copy it to my home directory. Then delete the copy
that's in /home/pamela/.local/share/Trash/files . See if it still exists
in /usr/share after that and, if so, it should be safe to delete all of
the /home/share/.local/share/Trash/files directory and all its contents.

If the file disappears from /usr/share , then restore the backup saved
in your home directory by recopying it back to /usr/share , and rethink.

   Yep. Looking at long directory listings is the first thing I did.

   Again, yep. Only the local copy went away.

   Blew away the ../Trash/files and ../Trash/info contents and rebooted.
Successfully. That takes care of this issue.

Thanks, Robert,

In theory, any web application that uses HTTP authentication can use 
OpenID credentials via mod_auth_openid on Apache:

   http://findingscience.com/mod_auth_openid/

Trac -- which is a pretty lightweight bug tool -- can use that toolset 
very easily.

Caveat: take my "in theory" modifier seriously; I've never used 
mod_auth_openid, so I can't vouch for it. It's available as an Debian 
package, however, so it's probably worth a look.

I assume that among the mostly-corporate-employed geeks who work

If you don't get a decent answer from PLUG (I don't have one), you 
might try addressing that question to Jonathan Corbet, editor of LWN 
and sometime kernel hacker: corbet at lwn.net.

Another avenue: Greg Kroah-Hartman lives in Portland or nearby, I 
think. He maintains the -stable branch of the kernel. I think he's 
employed by Novell, but I'd be surprised if he couldn't pass some 
quality names your way: gregkh at suse.de.

RT (Request Tracker) but is pretty heavy weight.

 From CPAN there is RT-Authen-OpenID.

Most houses use Redmine--it does not only bug tracking but project
management as well. If your shop doesn't use the PM features now they
will eventually.

Make your developers happy with a good bug tracking system found in
Redmine. Make your managers happy with a good project management system
found in Redmine.

My 10-second look reveals that Redmine has some openID support though I
am not sure to what extent.


Very Best,

Definitely give Redmine a try! ?We've been using it for a while now
and really love it. ?I suggest running it through Passenger
(http://www.modrails.com/) if you can.

If you end up using HTTP authentication, you may want to include the
following edits to hide the default Redmine account-related links.
I'm doing this using mod_auth_kerb/mod_auth_ldap, but it should work
just as well with mod_auth_openid.

We're renting a rack at a colo near downtown Portland, from a colo that

they were bought out by a large IT services company.

I asked a friend 'off list' who used to have a colo here in town and this is

 Easystreet is owned by Earthlink, no touchy.  I'd talk with Stephouse,
which is still locally owned and in a building downtown.

I know that Earthlink bought OneMain which had bought Teleport -- but 
I've never heard talk of EasyStreet being sold. Rich Bader still runs 
the company, as he has since its founding in the 90s.

In other words, I'd double-check that information. I don't think it's 
correct.

Looks like I'm pretty foolish.   I didn't check my friends info and just

Easystreet.

Subject: [PLUG] What opens an .xml file?
Message-ID: <20110630150924.1d372521@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I need an article that was published in volume five of a five volume set
"The Blackwell companion to syntax." I had to order the book through
interlibrary loan, and it has arrived. Imagine my surprise to discover
that, instead of receiving volume five, I received a CD.

Nautilus opened the CD just fine on my Fedora 14 x86_64 computer. And
the article I need is right there in the file browser window. However,
it is titled "Chapter 75 - Verb particle constructions.xml."

Double-clicking on it made Fedora try to open it in Gedit. That was not
a good choice. I tried opening it in Firefox, for some reason thinking
that .xml files had something to do with html. I was wrong. Then I
dimly recalled that OOo uses xml, so I tried opening it in Writer.
Writer opened it, but all I got was pages and pages of what looks like
code, interspersed with what appears to be the text of the article.
It's there, but an unreadable mess.

Google informs me that xml is Microsoft's new open document format. OK,
I don't have MS Office, but back to OOo for further checking. It turns
out that in OOo (3.3, from OOo, not Fedora repos) I can do File > Open
New > XML document. However, there appears no way to open an existing
xml file. 

So now I'm all gestumped. 

I could always schlep the CD back to PSU, open it on a PSU computer
with MS Office, and save as something else. But surely I won't have to
do that. 

Does anyone have any suggestions?

I think there was this transitional period where MS Office saved its
new format with .xml extension, but now it's .docx.

Try making a copy of the file and rename it with an extension ".docx"
and then open it in open office or libre office.  The newer the
version of OO/LO the better.  If that doesn't work, then I'm not sure
what the free alternatives are...

Good suggestion.

Didn't work. Still got pages of code interspersed with snippets of the

Is there an .xslt file or any other files also on the disk that we

   XML is an open standard; M$ probably has its own proprietary version of
this standard, just as they have their own, proprietary "open" document
format.

   XML has tags for each section and needs a stylesheet to reformat into
untagged text.

Actually XML *is* "code" of a sort, it is a markup language not unlike HTML.
Any of your favorite text editors in Linux can edit the file, but it would
not show it in regular "readable" format.

Ah! Now we may be getting somewhere!

Indeed, there is a folder labeled "Stylesheets" full of files like:

	Bodytext.xsl
	bpg4-0td.dtd
	Clientscripts.js
	Constants.xml

So the next question is, how to use these files?

There is also a file called "Guides.doc." It appears to be instructions
for how to create an sgml file. However, it is several pages long and I
didn't understand most of it.

Sheesh, Blackwell. What was wrong with plain PDF files?

In this case, you should be able to get your browser to interpret the
XML for you based on the "instructions" in the xsl file.  However, I
haven't played with this stuff for a while, so I don't remember how it
is supposed to work.

Somewhere in the base (root) directory of the CD filesystem, there 
should be an index.* (where * could be html, xml, or some variant 
thereof), and you should be able to open the index.* with a browser and 
go from there (i.e., open other "chapters" via links, similar to 
standard html documents).
If it isn't named index.*, it may be named something that indicates it 
is the first or primary document.
Does that work?

The rules of xml are such that the files/documents are often used to 
contain data in an specified manor ... the manor being specified by the 
program/application/document that is intended to use that data ... in 
other words, any one xml file may well not be complete without the 
program/application/document that is intended to access it.

Your suggestion had me very excited. There are, indeed, several suspect
files in the root of the CD such as you mentioned:

	Chapter - Index.xml
	Chapter - Reference.xml
	Contents.htm
	prelims.xml

Of the above list, Firefox will only open Contents.htm. And it shows
each of the chapters as a link. I thought I was home free. But opening
the link resulted in the following error message:

XML Parsing Error: undefined entity
Location:
file:///media/Mar%2031%202006/BW_syncon/chapter%2076%20-%20Verb%20Particle%20Constructions.xml
Line Number 15, Column 12:<copyright>&copy; 2006 by Blackwell
Publishing Ltd</copyright> -----------^

I also tried Opera. Opera opens Contents.htm the same as Firefox, but
clicking on the link for the chapter I need gave me the same garbled
code interspersed with the text, with this at the top of the page:

This document had an invalid XSLT stylesheet. Error message from the
XSLT engine: Error: XPath expression compilation failed:
$t/*[name()=$FullContentCode][last()] Details: compilation error
(characters 1-2, "$t"): reference to undefined variable: 't'

I wonder if there is something wrong with the files. 

It's not worth spending a huge amount of time on this, other than
satisfying my curiosity as to how this is supposed to work. If I can't
figure it out by tomorrow, I'll take the CD to the PSU library and ask
them to figure out how to open the files. And if they can't figure it
out I'll request a copy from a different library on *paper*.

It is possible that the file(s)/CD is/are corrupt (is it a copy or the 
original disc?).
It is possible that some file(s) is/are missing
It is possible that some application is missing
Are any of the files *.exe?
Since you are going to take it in and see if they can open it ... I 
should be interested in the results, if you are inclined to share them

I certainly will share the results.

The CD itself is printed with the title, etc. and the Blackwell
Publishing logo. It also has a section in fine print that says:

"Instructions:
Insert the disk into your CD-ROM drive and double click on your desktop
CD-ROM icon. With a Windows operating system the CD will open to a
display showing the contents, with _The Blackwell Companion to Syntax,
Vols 1-5_ at the top. On a Macintosh there will be a picture of the
cover of the book and a notice saying "Start CD" which will bring you
to the display of the contents. You must have an internet browser such
as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Safari, or Netscape Navigator
installed."

Note that the (c) on the CD is 2006. The original book is (c) 1997. 

Looking at the CD I noted some small sneeze globs on the back. I washed
the CD in plain tap water until it was shiny and clean and then tried
again. Same results. :(

It is possible that the index XML file is trying to pull in other
files on the CD by name and is breaking because of a case-difference.
In Windows, of course, files can be accessed case-insensitively, but
Linux doesn't work that way, so if a file is referenced with an
inconsistent case, it won't find it.  The work-around there would be
copying the directory tree out and fixing the broken references, which
is a pain of course.  If you look in firefox at the error console, it
might tell you what files it wants that aren't found.

Just a hypothesis...

Well, I have a partial solution, although it leaves questions
unanswered.

I have Windows 2000 installed in Virtualbox on my Fedora 14 x86_64
computer. So I fired it up and opened the Contents.htm file by just
double clicking on the file. This opened it in Internet Explorer. I
navigated to the Chapter 76 ... .xml file link and clicked on it. This
opened the link in a new IE window, and it appeared readable and
without code junk. 

I made a printout of it, so now I have a legible hard copy. The only
problem is that the chapter in the paper version of the book is 22
pages and the file I made a printout of is 55 pages. So if I ever want
to quote the work I am in trouble with page numbers. But at least now I
can read it.

The unanswered question is why Firefox, Opera and Konqueror would
display the contents by clicking on Contents.htm (the same as IE in
Win2000), but would not correctly open the resulting link to Chapter
76. Your hypothesis that Contents.xml is trying to pull in other files
on the CD and failing is certainly plausible. And the case sensitivity
is a good theory as well, since it happens equally with three different
browsers on Fedora. But I wonder if MacOS is also case sensitive. If
so, that throws out the case sensitivity theory, since (presumably) it
works on a Mac.

The error could also be javascript. The link in Contents.htm is:

javascript:makewindow('Chapter 75 - Verb Particle Constructions.xml')

I think Tim had it right.  Assuming you did a cut & paste of the file names
and error messages, they would indicate a problem due to case sensitivity.
Note the upper case characters in the error message verses the upper and
lower case version of the file names you listed.

file:///media/Mar%2031%202006/BW_syncon/*c*hapter%2076%20-%20*V*erb%20*P*
article%20*C*onstructions.xml
"*C*hapter 75 - *V*erb *p*article *c*onstructions.xml."

You might be able to fix this by copying the contents of the CD to your hard
drive and renaming the offending file, to match what the application is
expecting.
