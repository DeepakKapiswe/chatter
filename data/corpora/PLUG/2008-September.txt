              Chamber of Commerce in Corvallis.
              As of May 2008, the Mid Willamette Valley Linux Users
              Group was under reconstruction.  Once this is done
              see http://www.lug.corvallis.or.us/ for details.

        P.S.  The Eugene Linux Users Group meets several times a month.
              See http://www.euglug.org for details.

From: Wietse Venema <wietse at porcupine.org>

An on-line version of this announcement is available at
http://www.postfix.org/announcements/20080902.html

Summary:
========
Postfix 2.4 and later, on Linux kernel 2.6, is vulnerable to a denial of
service attack by a local user. There is no breach of data confidentiality
or data integrity. This problem was found by the Postfix author during
routine source code maintenance.

Discussion:
===========
Postfix is an open-source mail transfer agent (MTA) that runs on multiple
types of UNIX systems.  Postfix 2.4 (released 2007) introduces input/output
event handling based on high-performance primitives: BSD kqueue (also
present in MacOS X), Linux epoll, and Solaris /dev/poll.  These implement
more scalable event handling than the older select() and poll() primitives.

With 2.6 Linux kernels, Postfix 2.4 and later has an epoll file descriptor
leak when it executes non-Postfix commands in, for example, a user's
$HOME/.forward file.  A local user can access a leaked epoll file descriptor
to implement a denial of service attack on Postfix. The attack may result in
reduced Postfix performance, or in automatic Postfix shutdown when an
internal safety mechanism triggers.  Some possible attacks are discussed in
the last paragraph of this section.

Not affected is Postfix input/output event handling based on BSD kqueue and
Solaris /dev/poll.  There, the kernel effectively revokes access to the
underlying kernel object when it creates a child process with fork(),
keeping the kernel object normally accessible only by the process that
creates it.

The above approaches could help to improve the consistency of Linux
input/output event notification.  Currently, 1) different Linux processes
may make conflicting updates to a shared epoll instance; 2) therefore, the
Linux kernel may report input/output events to processes that didn't ask for
those events; and 3) those events may involve activity on pipes, sockets,
etc.  that aren't open in those processes.  Such inconsistency could be
avoided when an epoll instance were normally accessible only by the process
that creates it.

Workaround:
===========
Allow only trusted users to control delivery to non-Postfix commands. In the
following example, the directory /var/forward is not writable by users, and
Postfix is configured to search for /var/forward/username (plus optional
address extension) instead of the default location
~username/.forward (plus optional address extension).

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
     forward_path = /var/forward/${user}${recipient_delimiter}${extension},
 	/var/forward/${user}

Other workarounds would be required for other mail filtering software that
executes commands in user-controlled configuration files.

Solution:
=========
Apply the source code patch below, or install an updated Postfix version. 
Postfix versions 2.4.9, 2.5.5, and 2.6-20080902 are made available via
http://www.postfix.org/. Vendors will make updated versions available
according to their own support policies.

Patch:

There is nothing I know of planned with the local uers group community.
The Kernel Summit is invite only via the kernel list.  LPC is expensive
unless you are a student.  Neither group seem interested in user group
participation.  (Unless David know something I am not aware of...)

Since you have disabled it anyway, this is probably of little use, but I 
came across this in the README for SASL:

"IMPORTANT: pwcheck establishes a UNIX domain socket in /var/pwcheck and 
waits for authentication requests. The Postfix SMTP server must have 
read+execute permission to this directory or authentication attempts 
will fail."

From: http://www.postfix.org/SASL_README.html

Chris,

   And I missed this each of the three times I read that file. Guess I didn't
read it as carefully and thoroughly as I thought I did.

   Well, there we are: I don't have a /var/pwcheck directory.

   I read the .txt file.

Thanks,

Rich

Well ... "expensive" is relative. If you live in the Portland area, I
don't think the LPC is expensive. Flying in from Denmark, on the other
hand ... :)

But seriously, I'm going to LPC because I want to hang out with the
folks that do the low-level kernel performance monitoring tools. I'll
take what notes I can. :)

I'm going to fly there from Shenzhen, China, I'm also interested in
performance topics,

looking forward to meet you there.

I have spent some time too close to an event horizon.  During this time 
I figured out what I actually should have said I was looking for.  A 
portable monitor/keyboard/mouse unit.

I found only one so far and it is a bit expensive.

At the risk of touching off a chorus of wailing and gnashing of teeth, I 
use telnet (I hope everybody doesn't pee all over themselves).
I understand that telnet is not encrypted, but then, what are the 
conditions in which you would be using it? In my case, telnet works 
beautifully and has for years.

seems to me that you could make something equally light, only slightly
less portable, and much cheaper, by taking a small LCD monitor and
velcroing a keyboard-with-builtin-pointer-device and tying their
cables together.

My situation is I may need to watch the system boot, or it might be 
running MS Windows, or most often something has got itself into snit and 
the network is down.

Something else I mentally glossed over when I first posted is I 
sometimes place a machine on a network (LAN) to monitor traffic over a 
long-ish period and don't want to have to leave a monitor and keyboard 
there taking up room.

A friend of mine recently came across one of these: a Belkin IP Remote Console:

"The Belkin ENTERPRISE Quad-Bus Series Remote IP Console (the RIPC)
allows users to remotely access a server or multiple servers connected
to a KVM switch over a TCP/IP network."

Basically, you get KVM access via a java applet.

The same idea was just crossing my mind as your message came in.  A 
friend from the local user group had a LCD with a folding base -- 
Samsung I think but they are no longer made.

One could be put into a cheapy technician's case.  Looks like finding a 
LCD that will fit and has a removable base is my next project. Darn.  A 
quick measurement of my bench keyboard and a case says a Happy Hackers 
sized keyboard will be needed unless I can find a slightly larger case.

Thanks Chris.

I want to second the person who mentioned IPMI.  I can't recommend
this strongly enough.

Most recent servers have at least IPMI 1.5, and almost any new one
will have the 2.0 spec.

At my last job we setup IPMI to give us serial over Lan and got it
working with the bios screen.  So it was like being able to ssh to the
console.  IPMI also lets you do things like turn the power off, and
on.  We setup a PXE server in the colo box.  With the combination of
IPMI, serial over lan, and PXE boot images we could fix almost
anything that wasn't a hardware issue without traveling to the colo.
It was a bit of a learning curve, but well worth it.

Message-ID: <4c8f91e80809031120x69629d9cxd11cd0dd949d5146@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I'm looking for volunteers to be on an open source career panel, and
a volunteer to speak about debugging at the Linux Plumbers Conference
Student Day.

The debugging talk would be about 45 minutes, and cover the basics of
debugging the Linux kernel and open source applications.  Some of the
content could be taken from the debugging chapter in Linux Device
Drivers.  The talk could cover printk, dmesg and other interesting logs
in /var/log, common oops messages, debugfs, sysfs, debugging over serial
ports, etc.  Let me know if you're willing to volunteer to give this
talk, or if you have past slides that someone else could use.

We're also looking for representatives from companies who contribute to
open source and open source consulants to be a part of the career panel
at the Linux Plumbers Conference Student Day.  We will have about 20
students in the audience who will ask questions, and we will have some
prepared questions in case students are shy.

Student Day takes place on September 16th.  For more information, see:
	http://linuxplumbersconf.org/program/students/

Do I hear a volunteer? 

I am checking on who I have scheduled for this month and next month.
(My brain has been eaten by the new job at Intel.)  I think this month
is free and the next month taken, but I need to make sure.

I don't currently have access to any computers with IPMI 2.0 support.
The machines I did have access to are all production servers now so if
I got the current admin to demo we wouldn't be able to show off bios
screen stuff which is important as it's the easy way to get it all
working.

If someone has a modern server to loan I could probably set up some
kind of demonstration.

Great!  You're based in Boston, right?  This would mean that you would
have to be in Portland a day earlier (Tuesday) than the main LPC
conference (which starts on Wednesday).  I wasn't sure whether you would
be in town for Kernel Summit already, and I want to make sure there's no
misunderstandings.

Honestly, the list I put together was off the top of my head, and I'll
defer to your experience in debugging.

Subject: [PLUG] Sound problems AGAIN
Message-ID: <48BFFF6B.8070108@dslnorthwest.net>

I realize that sound problems have so many causes and solutions that asking for
ideas is like shooting darts with a blindfold on, but here goes (in desperation):

Was working fine. Now only one channel has output sound, and Audacity does not
record.  Just last Saturday I made two recordings without a hitch.  I have made
no (intentional) changes to the system; no updates.

Output is fine in Windows (dual boot), so hardware is not the issue.

I have compared the output of amixer scontents now and that produced when the 
sound was working, and they are identical.

I am running Kubuntu  8.04.  My sound card is Audigy 2:

amixer -c 0 info
Card hw:0 'Audigy2'/'Audigy 2 Value [SB0400] (rev.0, serial:0x10011102) at 
0xa400, irq 5'
   Mixer name    : 'SigmaTel STAC9750,51'
   Components    : 'AC97a:83847650'
   Controls      : 200
   Simple ctrls  : 35

This is unchanged from when everything was fine.

I have Googled for info on one dead channel.  Some others report the same, but 
frankly, I cannot understand the very terse replies, and many appear related to 
particular sound cards/drivers.

Ideas?

Thanks,
-Denis

Quick question as I'm still testing.

Has anyone run a system with both SCSI hard drives and an ATA CR-RW?

If so, what distribution and have you had any problems burning a CD-RW 
with cdrecord?


TIA,

My system fits that description.  I use k3b to burn discs, and I 
haven't had any problems.  Sorry I can't tell you the cdrecord command 
that k3b uses.  Before my NEC DVD writer died, I also had success 
burning DVDs.  If you are really desperate, I could burn a disc and 
note the cdrecord command that is used.

Thanks Galen.  I can check that myself.

The problem system, not my workstation, is giving me inconsistent 
results when I try to burn from the command line.  I even went so far as 
to try using a USB connected CD-RW and had the same issues.
    First round of tests was to blank the CD.  Worked with no problems 
on two of three CDs (I still have to run the last one.) from my 
workstation which is ATA only.
    Next round will be to pull the data down, build an ISO, and try 
burning that.

Good.  The other system is only 5.0 (Final) so I'll have to upgrade it 
and see if that makes a difference.

Darn system worked for several years but after upgrading from Fedora 
Core 1; yeah can you believe that :-) I started seeing problems.  So 
possibly a drive getting old but the test with USB connected one puts a 
bit of a snag in to that idea.

Well, it was an interesting first experiment with Talkshoe.  I discovered only
midway through that the mic was putting out sound that was low enough volume
that the "gate" was saying "nobody is talking loud enough" and cut the sound
out entirely!

I'll have to experiment more to see if I need to insert some sort of autolevel
or compressor ahead of Talkshoe, or maybe use the Sip-phone client for the
upstream instead of the Java client.  The "chat" client did work quite well
though, so that part would be good for feedback during the show.

The audio can be downloaded from the stream... you'll probably want to look at
it in an audio editor and skip forward to where the sound actually exists. :)

Of course, this is audio only.  The video would also be useful, so if we can
get a camera for the next experiment, we can stream *and* record it on
Stickam, and then have a much larger experience.

That looks easy enough.  Hopefully that it the extent of the damage. 
I'm busy this weekend, but I could do this sometime next week.  I'm

At several stints as repair technician / field engineer, I have repaired 
many circuit boards, usually required after removing an IC. I repair 
them with a short run of wire-wrap wire soldered at each side of the 
break. You have to be very careful doing this as too much heat will 
cause very fine traces will lift off the board. I would recommend using 
as low a wattage soldering iron as possible. Any chance you could take a 
photograph of the trace that needs repair and attach it to an email?

If you don't get a better offer, you can bring it by my house and I 
would be glad to do it for you as a favor. I work at home (Beaverton OR) 
much of the time and am today.

hmm, i don't know, but i also couldn't get it to work with proftpd
even though i used the app "kodos" to make sure my logging string
matched the RE.  that'd be a good place to start (since my first 8
tries didn't match it, i still think in perlish).  hard to complain
though, denyhosts has made my log-reading-life 1000x better with just
the distributed ssh denial database.  we still see about 10 scans a
day that we upload to the server, and 30 or so that we are already
denying before they show up.  unfortuantely there are still the
distributed scans that occasionally go on for hours with one attempt
from each of a zillion IP's, but those are fortunately fairly rare.

let us know if you figure out what the story turned out to be!

Subject: [PLUG]  Sound problems AGAIN
Message-ID: <48C1D35E.5020803@dslnorthwest.net>

A little more info:

I created a new user.  The new user suffers from the same problem, i.e., only 
left channel has sound output.

I looked at /etc for files changed since the successful recording.  I could find 
nothing.

Does anybody know if Kubuntu uses autoupdate of packages?  I can find nothing 
about it.  The most I can find is that users complain that no autoupdate is 
available in KDE.  If this is the case, the only things that changed from the 
time I was successful recording in Audacity (August 30) and the failures (Sept 
3) was running Audacity and running Amarok.

I am at a dead end.

-Denis

I realize that sound problems have so many causes and solutions that asking for
ideas is like shooting darts with a blindfold on, but here goes (in desperation):

Was working fine. Now only one channel has output sound, and Audacity does not
record.  Just last Saturday I made two recordings without a hitch.  I have made
no (intentional) changes to the system; no updates.

Output is fine in Windows (dual boot), so hardware is not the issue.

I have compared the output of amixer scontents now and that produced when the
sound was working, and they are identical.

I am running Kubuntu  8.04.  My sound card is Audigy 2:

amixer -c 0 info
Card hw:0 'Audigy2'/'Audigy 2 Value [SB0400] (rev.0, serial:0x10011102) at
0xa400, irq 5'
    Mixer name    : 'SigmaTel STAC9750,51'
    Components    : 'AC97a:83847650'
    Controls      : 200
    Simple ctrls  : 35

This is unchanged from when everything was fine.

I have Googled for info on one dead channel.  Some others report the same, but
frankly, I cannot understand the very terse replies, and many appear related to
particular sound cards/drivers.

Ideas?

Thanks,
-Denis

Found on the web:
"resolved by simply going into the ALSA controls and mute the FRONT speakers, 
and then unmute them."  I suspect this will be necessary after every boot.

Works for me too.  The Audacity problem was a hardware issue (plug loose).  But 
the interaction between the balance control and the Master control continues. 
Sounds like a bug to me. Perhaps it will get addressed soon.

BTW, it is entirely possible that the dead channel has been with me for a while, 
so I can blame the upgrade to 8.04.

I was translating a bash script to perl and encountered this dilemma:

In bash I can do
ScriptDir=$(cd $(dirname $0) ; pwd)

I tried doing the equivalent in perl, but the sticking point seems to be the
";" in the middle of the compound statement.

Maybe I'm overlooking something obvious here.

Some suggestions guys?

Not a perl hacker, so I may be way off base here, especially where
idiomatic style is concerned.

chdir() returns true or false.  It would be handier if it returned the
new directory's pathname.  Then it could be used functionally:

$scriptDir = chdir($0);

But maybe this would work:

$scriptDir = (chdir($0) && `pwd`);

Then $scriptDir is null if the operation failed, which gives you some
useful feedback.

Is chdir() sticky like in PHP, where even if you call it in a
function, you stay in the new directory even after the function exits,
as if it's changing the current directory for the entire script
process?

Hi Bill,

What equivalent has ';' in the middle of it?  Running shell commands for 
that sort of thing is usually not desirable.

  use File::Fu;
  my $script_dir = File::Fu->file($0)->dirname->absolute;

Would be equivalent to:

  use File::Basename qw(dirname);
  use File::Spec;
  my $script_dir = File::Spec->rel2abs(dirname($0));

Or, if you want to eliminate all of the possible ../ parts:

  use File::Basename qw(dirname)
  use Cwd qw(abs_path);
  my $script_dir = abs_path(dirname($0));

But perl won't stop you from doing shell expansion expansion within your 
shell expansions as long as you get your sigils properly escaped:

  my $script_dir = qx(cd \$(dirname $0) ; pwd)

Though you should remember to chomp() the result and check $?;

  chomp(my $script_dir = qx(cd \$(dirname $0) ; pwd)); die $! if($?);

And you might just get the current directory back if the cd fails, so:

  chomp(my $script_dir = qx(cd \$(dirname $0) && pwd)); die $! if($?);

But you could get your home directory back if dirname fails, so, uh...

  chomp(my $script_dir =
    qx(cd \$(dirname $0 || echo /dev/null) && pwd)); die $! if($?);

But I recommend File::Fu.  If you want the cwd-style result with no 
dots, I could add that feature.

Finally, don't use FindBin.

Well, I finally figured out what why I could only access 4GB of my 6GB
of memory.  It turned out that I had installed the memory wrong. This
motherboard has 4 memory slots in 2 banks, A and B. I had installed 2
1GB DIMMs in bank A and 2 2GB DIMMs in bank B, but as a last resort I
read the manual  which says that A1+B1 must equal A2+B2, i.e. I had to
install 3 GB in each bank to make them symmetric.   So the bigmem
kernel does work, I can access 6GB with a 32 bit kernel, with each
process  limited to less than 4GB. As part of  trying to find out
where the problem was I also installed a partition with a 64 bit
kernel and I am slowly migrating everything over to that.

Thanks Alan, Jason, Drew and Derek for your suggestions.

Shouldn't this have shown up in the bios memory check?

Why not?  If you have module files in the same directory as the perl
script then it is useful.

Yes, it did show up in the bios memory check, but I didn't interpret
it correctly. It would say something like "6GB of memory, 4GB
available".  I misinterpreted this to mean that the bios found 6GB,
but a 32 bit OS would only see 4GB. Now it says 6GB of memory, 6GB
available.

You have module files in /usr/local/bin?

You can use it if you want, but make sure all of your users read 
the 'BUGS' section in the documentation and/or be very careful what you 
name your script.

By the way, are you using the symlink resolution feature?

The next release of File::Fu will have File::Fu->program_name 
and ->program_dir (in trunk now), and I suppose ->resolve should just 
be a method on the basic object (so you only pay for that when you use 
it.)

I'm not sure where FindBin acquired this misfeature of searching $PATH 
when the script is obviously *right in front of you*, but I suspect it 
either had something to do with a dead OS or some other bit of 
interesting/useless historical trivia.  Onions in the varnish, cutting 
the ends off of the ham, standing the game console on end, etc.

After a lengthy battle, I got DKIM working on my mail server.  I'm
going to have to document my efforts to save others from the pain.
Lots of little gotchas and what-have-yous.  But that is not what this
email is about.

I assume I have DKIM working because I get a clean result when sending
a test mail to a reflector (check-auth at verifier dot port25 dot
com).  But yahoo doesn't recognize my DKIM signature at all.  The
thing yahoo calls DKIM must still be the antiquated DomainKeys.  What
a bummer, since the entire reason I went through the hassle of setting
up DKIM was to enable my users to send email to yahoo.

My questions:

- Is yahoo going to bring their DKIM implementation up to speed any
  time soon, or will they languish in yesteryear for as long as
  possible, like they did with BIND8?

- Can dkim-milter-2.7.0 be made to work with yahoo's implementation?

- I just now got DKIM working properly.  Do I need to wait a day
  before writing off yahoo?  Might they be caching my previous failed
  attempts?

Subject: [PLUG] Log file translation to English
Message-ID: <20080908093938.e96c8ae5.johnxj@comcast.net>

First, the long story:

I have periodic problems with my Hardy x86_64 locking up on my T61 Thinkpad. That is, the lockups are sometimes a bit different, but in all cases the only solution is to reboot. For example, this morning moving the mouse (bluetooth) failed to restore the screen from the screensaver. Now, the bluetooth mouse has always suffered from random disconnects. Usually I get several days before it suddenly quits working. I turned off the touchpad in the BIOS a long time ago but left the trackball working so I have a "backup mouse" when that happens. I just open a terminal and do "sudo hidd --connect <address> after holding the mouse "look for me" button down for 12 seconds. It's annoying, but I suffer it because I love the mouse.

This morning when the mouse failed to restore the screen I tried Ctrl-Alt-F1, which restored the screen, although it did not go to a command line. I tried the mouse again and discovered that it had died again. That would explain why moving it did not restore the screen. Intending to reconnect it I used the trackball to go to Applications > Accessories > Terminal, but I was unable to open a terminal with the trackball. The panel said "opening terminal" for a bit, then nothing. I tried Ctrl-Alt-F1 to get to a command line, but discovered that the keyboard had died. The trackball would select menu items, but I could not restore any programs that had been minimized to the panel. Eventually the trackball wouldn't even select menu items. At that point I had to reboot.

This morning's episode is a bit different because usually the lockups are complete - no keyboard, no mouse, no trackball - nada. I should also mention that I have never ever had the computer lock up while using it. It is always when I return to the computer after leaving it for several hours, only to discover that it has locked up. 

I can also add that it sits on a docking station at home, which is plugged into the wall. However, I have a desktop that is also plugged into the wall (no UPS because it is used only for backups and for watching movies). In the past when I discovered the T61 had locked up I found that the desktop was completely shut down. In other words, it was PGE's fault. A momentary power outage had occurred in my absence, although it must have been very brief because the stereo was still playing. I asked on the Thinkpad e-list about this because it didn't make sense to me for such a brief power outage to affect the Thinkpad. If the mains go down it should automatically switch to the battery without incident. The response on the e-list was that it was probably a power surge. I got no "me too" responses from other T61 users, so evidently my problem is unique.

Now the question:

In my several years of using Ubuntu I have never paid much attention to log files. This morning I decided it was time to rectify that failure in my Linux education, in the hope that I could figure out what is causing the lockups. After a bit of googling I figured out that /var/log/messages (and its .0, .1 ... prior copies) would be the best place to find answers. I opened both /messages and /messages.0 in gedit, but found that I was unable to scrute the messages. For example, I found this in /messages at the time I gave up and hit the power button:

<more pages showing evidently the boot process>

Looking at the pages of stuff before the "restart" line I find nothing that I can understand. I would assume that the poking around that I did with the trackball left messages, but I am unable to find them.

I also find this at intervals of exactly 20 minutes, apparently while the computer is idle:

Sep  7 12:10:08 Devil7 -- MARK --
Sep  7 12:30:08 Devil7 -- MARK --

What is that all about?

Is there any way to figure out what the pages of inscrutable messages mean?

Are there any other log files that I should be looking at to troubleshoot this issue?

Running a 30/15mbit FiOS line here with unlimited phone + high def TV. Had to 
call tech support to get the Ethernet port on the ONT enabled, wired up my 
own Slackware-based router, and plugged the WAN port on the MoCA router into 
the switch connected to the LAN side of the Slackware router. Basically: ONT 
Eth -> Slackware Router -> Switch -> MoCA router -> FiOS boxes running over 
coax. So far everything seems to be working fine, Video on Demand, Guides, 
etc.. with the added bit of fun of being able to use tcpdump to capture the 
MPEG-TS stream used for the Video on Demand content along with Guide 
information.

We are having a Linux workshop on Saturday, October 25 10-4 at:

Touchstone Technology
9735 SW Sunshine Ct
Beaverton, OR 97005

I'm looking for people that would like to help out and promote different
distros to the public. This is a workshop for first time users so I was
planning on promoting Linux Mint, openSuse, and other easier to use distros.


Anyone interested please contact David at:

   Please define "easier to use." Compared with what? Vista? A scanning
electron microscope? If you want to present something that requires no
thought, knowledge, or insight perhaps you should find something other than
linux.

Some distros are easier to install the configure than others. For example,
Mint is easier for first time users than Gentoo.

I want more people to use Linux, that is the purpose of the workshop.

My sister has a new job (Citizen Cellular in Tualatin), and unlike
her last job for ATT Cellular where they castigated her for her
disabilities, the new place is rewarding her for high productivity;
she won a Gateway M-1626 laptop.  YAY! 

The Gateway comes with Vista and some M$ timebomb apps;  this
afternoon it gets a hard-drive transplant and Ubuntu 8.04 Heron .  
She still has a license for windoze 2000 and some old M$ apps,
with install disks, so I may wrap those in VMware or Virtualbox
in case her needs push that way.

I haven't seen the unit yet, so I have no direct data.  My sister
has been using a Mac Mini at home for the last 3 years, win2K
before that.  I've been weaning her slowly from M$;  she is no
tech wizard, but persistent about learning what she can.

Some googling revealed that the CPU is an AMD Turon 64x2 dual core,
it has ATI Radeon X1270 graphics, and Realtek wifi ("Lite-ON
WN6300L" ???).  

I'm a little worried about drivers for the Realtek wireless being
flakey with the AMD64x2 processor.  Any suggestions for headache
avoidance with this or other Gateway/AMD64/Realtek issues?

   My only experience with Gateway portables was in 1990-1992. It had a
486/DX2 CPU and a monochrome screen. Designed and built for Gateway by TI,
the internal power supply was carefully designed to last 13 months; the unit
had a 12-month warranty. After replacing it twice the Gateway tech support
guy admitted it was a flawed design. I got rid of it and vowed to not buy a
Gateway product again. I sincerely hope your sister's machine is orders of
magnitude better designed and built than was mine.

http://www.datanorth.net/~cuervo/rtl8187b/ has some info on a driver for
it.  64 bit should not be a problem.  Getting it to work might be
though.

Claims better support for it in 2.6.27.  That kernel has a lot of reorg
of code, so you might want to wait.

/me makes choking noises

If the card doesn't work for you with native drivers, you might want to
consider just replacing the internal card with one that has a decent
chipset.  If it's a mini-PCI card, this is typically very easy in
laptops and there's tons of cheap cards on eBay.  You could also use a
PCMCIA or ExpressCard adapter until Linux gets stable drivers for the
built-in.

good luck,
tim

I agree with Tim: use something that's linux compatible, ideally
replacing the existing card.

Another option in that direction is USB wireless.  I volunteer for a
group the refurbished machines, something similar to FreeGeek.  We go
some machines that didn't have built-in wifi. So I tried out some USB
wifi sticks.  Below is my post to the groups mailing list.  One
caveat: although both worked on the machines we had in the shop, one
stick didn't work in my Lenovo machine which had a built-in wifi card.

These machines do not have built-in wifi nor room enough to put in a
full-height PCI card.  So I picked up two different USB wifi sticks at
BestBuy to try out.

Belkin - F5D7050 v4001 [1]
LinkSys - WUSB54GC [2]

Both worked flawlessly on an open wifi.  Plug in.  Wait.  Click on the
NetworkManager applet to choose wifi network.  While both cards worked
on the machines from WITS, the Linksys did not work on my Lenovo
laptop, which has built-in wifi.  Even when turned off, the Linksys
USB wifi did not work on my laptop.

Both cards cost about $40 at BestBuy.  Might be able to get them for
less elsewhere.

I have a few servers behind a small NetScreen firewall in a colo. They
are running Debian, with one runnign Ubuntu Hardy Server. All of them
have trouble transferring large files on their public interfaces, but no
problems transferring files on the back net. 

I see this problem when apt-getting a new kernel (or other file larger
than about 2M. though sometimes smaller files won't go either), rsyncing
a directory full of mail archives, and using wget to download tarballs.
I have had a little success with aria2c, which seems to restart the
download a little while after it stalls.

I suspect the firewall, but I would like to find the problem before
buying a new firewall.

Where should I begin? I can use the text wireshark, tcpdump, or similar,
but then I'll end up with a large file that needs to be grepped (for
what?) because I won't be able to get it off the system without lots of
restarts.

Thanks!

So, only keep the last chunk of data? ;)

Wireshark:
-----
-b <capture ring buffer option>
     Cause Wireshark to run in ``multiple files'' mode. In ``multiple  
files'' mode, Wireshark will write to several capture files. When the  
first capture file fills up, Wireshark will switch writing to the  
next file and so on.

     The created filenames are based on the filename given with the - 
w flag, the number of the file and on the creation date and time,  
e.g. outfile_00001_20050604120117.pcap,  
outfile_00001_20050604120523.pcap, ...

     With the files option it's also possible to form a ``ring  
buffer''. This will fill up new files until the number of files  
specified, at which point Wireshark will discard the data in the  
first file and start writing to that file and so on. If the files  
option is not set, new files filled up until one of the capture stop  
conditions match (or until the disk if full).

     The criterion is of the form key:value, where key is one of:

     duration:value switch to the next file after value seconds have  
elapsed, even if the current file is not completely filled up.

     filesize:value switch to the next file after it reaches a size  
of value kilobytes (where a kilobyte is 1024 bytes).

     files:value begin again with the first file after value number  
of files were written (form a ring buffer).
--------
(from http://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html)

tcpdump:
----
-s
     Snarf snaplen bytes of data from each packet rather than the  
default of 68 (with SunOS's NIT, the minimum is actually 96). 68  
bytes is adequate for IP, ICMP, TCP and UDP but may truncate protocol  
information from name server and NFS packets (see below). Packets  
truncated because of a limited snapshot are indicated in the output  
with ``[|proto]'', where proto is the name of the protocol level at  
which the truncation has occurred. Note that taking larger snapshots  
both increases the amount of time it takes to process packets and,  
effectively, decreases the amount of packet buffering. This may cause  
packets to be lost. You should limit snaplen to the smallest number  
that will capture the protocol information you're interested in.  
Setting snaplen to 0 means use the required length to catch whole  
packets.

-C
     Before writing a raw packet to a savefile, check whether the  
file is currently larger than file_size and, if so, close the current  
savefile and open a new one. Savefiles after the first savefile will  
have the name specified with the -w flag, with a number after it,  
starting at 1 and continuing upward. The units of file_size are  
millions of bytes (1,000,000 bytes, not 1,048,576 bytes).

-w
     Write the raw packets to file rather than parsing and printing  
them out. They can later be printed with the -r option. Standard  
output is used if file is ``-''.
----
(from http://www.tcpdump.org/tcpdump_man.html )

....Then you only have to move/look at the last file or so. :)

Good luck!

Thanks. That's useful. So just for fun, I ran the Wireshark GUI on my
laptop, and discovered something interesting: it appears to be a problem
with the laptop, probably a bad NIC. 

I see a ton of bad checksums (the incorrect checksum is mostly the same:
0xaeaf) and some chaos that seems to be a result of those (duplicate
ACKs, mostly).

Since I have a pile of images that need to be uploaded, I tried from my
laptop, captured a trace, then burned a CD and sent the images
(successfully) from another PC in my office.

Fortunately my laptop is still under warrantee, but unfortunately I
don't know how to prove it's the hardware other than to describe how
different version of software all fail. It failed when plugged into the
laptop's RJ port, and it fails when the laptop is docked and the cable
is attached to the dock. There's only one ethernet chip, so this is not
a surprise.

I was running the latest Hardy kernel when I wrote the original email to
the list, and I am running the Intrepid 64-bit kernel as I type this. I
still have the same problem. So it's not likely to be a kernel or driver
issue; it's an Intel gigabit NIC, and I can't believe that checksum bugs
would persist from 2.6.24 to 2.6.27. 

Anyone got the T61 diagnostic CD?

Thanks.

One thing that caught my eye:
*The* cable?

Maybe it won't matter, but have you done this with "clean" or  
possibly less abused cables?

Different cable ports?

A different local switch/hub?

Yeah, I know this can be as annoying as somebody asking you "Is the  
computer plugged in", but sometimes we all have to "sanity check"  
ourselves by talking through issues with others.

One possibility is TCP window scaling.  The TCP option improves
performance on high-bandwidth high-latency links.  It was enabled by
default in recent versions of the Linux kernel.  Some older firewalls
get really confused by the option and drop connections.

You can try disabling through the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling file.
You might try doing "echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling"
and see if that helps.  You can disable it permanently in the
/etc/sysctl.conf file.

Ubuntu and Fedora are in the top 5 on distrowatch and I'm fairly certain
that has something to do with their shallow learning curve.

We are open to all distros at the workshop. Since the focus is on first time
users I want it to be as smooth as possible. From the dozen distros I've
used in the past four years, I've had good results with Mint. I personally
like sidux, but I wouldn't give it to some who has never used Linux before.

Kurt,

   Can you disable or bypass the internal NIC and test using an external one,
perhaps USB?

Hey, I scored major points in an interview by suspecting cables first
when NICs don't work right... I'm with you.

I have seen this problem in Paris, Hawaii and Portland. I use different
cables in each place. Different switches too, obviously.

I don't think it's a cable problem. 

I'll try wireless next. If that has the same problem, I'm going to be
quite confused, but more ready to blame the software again.

There's only one NIC in the box (not counting the wireless), but I do
have a USB NIC sitting around. I'll give it a try.

Hello folks,

I'm looking at the necessity of rewiring all of my interior phone
lines at home, as the ugly mess of 1950s, 60s, and 70s-era wiring will
no longer support a reasonably high-speed DSL line.

I want to install a DSL/POTS splitter at our NID or just inside the
house from it, rather than relying on DSL filters at each phone set.
I'm going to replace all of the mix of plastic insulated, cloth
insulated, and bare wiring with CAT5.

I'm looking for suggestions for a local, reasonably-priced supplier
here in town for a big spool of CAT-5 wire, crimp-on RJ-11 and RJ-45
ends, the DSL splitter, and miscellaneous phone junction boxes, wall
jacks, etc.

I may end up needing to go to multiple places to get everything I
need. I would guess Frys would be cheapest for the CAT5 and the
crimp-on ends, but I'm not sure they'd have DSL/POTS splitters. I also
might find the phone junction boxes and wall jacks cheaper at a
hardware store.

I'll pretty well need to do most all of this tonight, or else I'll be
in big trouble with my Internet-deprived wife and daughter.

Stafford,

   Much of the standard POTS stuff is available at Home Depot (and probably
Lowe's, too). Fry's, sigh, has cat5 and cat6 cables, terminals, and crimping
tools. Probably have the DSL stuff, too.

   Rather than rushing and risking uncontrollable twitching from your wife
and daughter if the change takes too long, or uncontrollable cursing from
you for the same reason, consider running new wires first and changing the
connections to equipment after everything is installed.

   I have a crimping tool and wire-pulling tape if you want to borrow them.

Yeah, I figured the POTS stuff might be cheaper at a hardware store
than from Frys. There's an A-Boy not far from my house that I like to
support over the big-box chains.

Sadly, the uncontrollable twitching has already begun. I got a 7meg
down/1.5 up upgrade on my Qwest DSL, which has stopped training up
completely now.

I work at Home Depot (South Beaverton store in appliances now but 
formerly in electrical) and we have all of the stuff needed for POTS. 
Not sure about the filters however.  There might be some in the 
Structured Media systems but I don't recall seeing anything recently. 
When I had DSL, Verizon installed the filter at the DMARC so no worries 
there.  Now, I'm Comcastic.

Thanks Rich - I can borrow any tools I'll need from my employer, and
I'm going to buy some fish tape and leave it in place for future
wiring-pulling fun.

Why leave a fish tape there? Just leave a piece of twine tied at both
ends after you've pulled the wire through with the tape. Or is that
what you meant? The fish tape is the metal rod that you shove through
to pull the first thing through from one place to another. At least
that's how I've always understood it.

Yeah, that's where I go for wiring/electronics doodads.  Centrally

located also.  I'm going there myself this afternoon.

I thought fish tape was the higher strength/low friction plastic tape
that you leave in place, but truthfully, I've always been a layer-2

To the other suggestions I would add ENU (www.enuinc.com). They won't
have as big a selection as the others, but sometimes they have the one
thing you need that you can't get elsewhere.

Message-ID: <48C9A7BF.4050903@acm.org>

Can anyone offer some ideas on how to get XSane on my workstation to
find (and use) the saned daemon (xinetd) on the server?

I've got saned up and running and can connect using telnet but xsane
searches for devices doesn't find one and only offers pseudo-help and
a "Close" option.

The scanner worked when it was connected directly to the workstation. 
Now I want to off load the scanning my wife wants done back to her and 
the WinXP system she uses but still be able to scan from my system.

I had this working in the early-Fedora days.  Now it wants to be difficult!


TIA,
Rod

Damn!  2 minutes after pressing "Send" I found it!

/etc/sane.d/net.conf

Added the IP for the server and BINGO!

Sorry for the worthless bits.

Hi,

First off, the destination email address specified by an SMTP client is
not given in the email headers (which appear in the SMTP DATA section),
but rather in the RCPT command(s) which occur earlier in the SMTP
conversation.  This and other information is sometimes referred to the
envelope.  Mail servers just deliver what's in the DATA section (or what
could be thought of as what's inside the envelope) and not the envelope
itself.  Some mail servers are nice enough to add a "Delivered-to"
header which contains what it saw in the envelope as the delivery
address. In your case I don't see one, which means you have to guess.

To help answer your question, mail servers should stamp messages with at
least one Received header as they forward the message to the next
destination.  These are stamped in reverse chronological order, so the
newest Received lines are at the top.

Given the last Received header:

> Received: from imta27.emeryville.ca.mail.comcast.net ([76.96.30.95])
>           by alnrmxc21.comcast.net (alnrmxc21) with ESMTP
>           id <20080913234021a2100jfmnqe>; Sat, 13 Sep 2008 23:40:21 +0000

I'm guessing that one of your email accounts is a comcast account?  If
so, then it would be a safe bet that this is where it came in to.  If
you have multiple Comcast accounts delivering to the same inbox, then
you're probably SoL when it comes to determining which.

HTH,
tim

Message-ID: <48CE63DC.1060807@gisnet.com>

I'm trying to block a couple of overly busy Chinese web spiders from 
sniffing my site every hour, but not having much luck. I first tried 
putting this in /etc/hosts.deny:

ALL: 61.135.168.39,  220.181.32.22

but that didn't stop them. Then I tried putting this in 
/etc/http/conf/httpd.conf in the <Directory> tag:
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
    Deny from 61.135.168.39  220.181.32.22

and that didn't work. I restarted httpd each time I made a change. I'm 
using Fedora Core 9.

So how do you block a particular IP from accessing your web site? 
(without disturbing the firewall if possible.)

I think you should try to put one IP address per line in hosts.deny,
like so:

ALL: 61.135.168.39
ALL: 220.181.32.22

Why not change your approach and use hosts.allow instead and put in 
entries for networks and hosts that you only wish to grant access to?

If this were a public site how would one go about allowing access to
everyone? Isn't that why you would specifically deny certain hosts and not
default deny and open access for those who are authorized. Your firewall is
the best place to make the blocks for traffic, imo.

Because Apache doesn't use tcp_wrappers.

Apache's order/allow/deny directives can be incredibly confusing (at
least they are for me).  Every time I mess with them I have to guess and
check my ordering just to make sure it's right.  Have you tried:

     Order deny,allow
     Deny from 61.135.168.39  220.181.32.22
     Allow from all

??

What does the rest of your Directory block look like?  Is that tag for
the document root?  Do you have any other Directory blocks that might
override that behavior for specific areas?

HTH,
tim

I agree, but instead of guessing why not just check the docs? Apache has
great documentation.

I use this scheme to log then drop the bad guys:

iptables -A INPUT -s $IP -j LOG --log-prefix "IPTABLES DROPPED"
iptables -A INPUT -s $IP -j DROP

Netfilter logging can be dangerous. If you're going to do it, I
recommend adding rate limiting to protect against accidental or
intentional DoS. For example:

iptables -A INPUT -s $IP -m limit --limit 1/minute -j LOG
iptables -A INPUT -s $IP -j DROP

man iptables(8) for details

Message-ID: <48CE9565.6070502@comcast.net>

I haven't had a reason to update or install any new software for a long
time (months). I tried to do so today using YaST and got the following
error message:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cannot access installation media
SUSE Linux 10.1 CD 1
Check that the server is accessible

Media Source
ftp//204.152.191.39%2fopensuse/distribution/SL-10.1/inst.source/ does

When I visit ftp//204.152.191.39 with Firefox I find a suse directory,
and can drill down to:

ftp://204.152.191.39/suse/i386/10.1/

Once there, I see a directory called inst-source-extra but no
inst-source. Googling, I found a comment that said 10.1 was no longer
supported.

Is there some other ftp site I can point YaST to that still provides
10.1 files?

I have this same problem periodically. SuSe appears to subscribe to the
philosophy that "the latest is the greatest" - upgrade or get left behind.

My solution is to put the path to inst-source in google. Someone (usually in
germany) will be mirroring it for quite some time. I still have machines
running 10.0 that I can find repositories for.

What I would like to do is set up my own repository/mirror so I don't have
to rely on the outside. But, I don't know how to do this yet and haven't had
time to learn. Do I hear an Advanced Topics discussion forming?

Topic:     Indexing CPAN

BackPAN is the historical archive of the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network, where most Perl modules live. Going back to 1993, BackPAN has
about 100,000 distributions, taking up 12 GB of space. So far, there
has not been a comprehensive index of all of these distributions. I'm
working on a project to go through each distribution, record as much
information as I can, and store that in a way that other people can
ask questions. The big goal now is to take any Perl module file you
have installed locally and query my index to determine exactly which
distribution it came from, when it was released, what other files came
with it, and at the time of it's release what its dependency list was.

My talk is a demonstration of what I have so far, which is still in
the data collection phase. I have an indexer that knows how to go
through distributions and record information, and can do some with
pluggable components for each portion of the work. In my talk, I'll
demonstrate the current indexer and talk a little bit about the tools
and techniques I use. There's plenty of cool Perl things going on, and
I'm sure some of the Linux people will have valuable comments about
software indexing.

I found a site listing a bunch of sites supposedly hosting the 10.1
install source. The page

http://planetyazid.blogspot.com/2006/06/mirrors-use-by-smart-for-suse-101.html

is from 2006, so I'm not surprised that some of the links are broken.
However, there are some that look OK -- the directories exist, and are
populated with lots of files. One example is

http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/SL-10.1/inst-source/

But, when I try adding it to YaST I get a new error message:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unable to create installation source
from URL 'http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/SL-10.1/inst-source'.
Details:
Cannot create the installation source
Try again?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In YaST, when I click on Add, I'm presented with a window titled "Server
and Directory" with several lines for input. The first is for selecting
the protocol. Choices are FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, and SMB/CIFS. I selected
HTTP. Next it wants the Server Name. I put in download.opensuse.org .
The next line is for Directory on Server. For that I have tried
"distribution/SL-10.1/inst-source" and
"/distribution/SL-10.1/inst-source" but both return the same error message.

Is there something obvious I'm missing?

 nope, that's the way I do it. I would just keep trying others if I were

SUSE 10.1 is no longer supported. No bug fixes. No security updates.
Zero. Zilch. Nada.

You should not be using SUSE 10.1 on a system connected to the Internet.
If you choose to use a free distro, you choose to be forced to upgrade
regularly.

If you want to be able to use an ancient SUSE release, pay for a SLES
support contract. Or pay for RHEL. Or switch to CentOS. Ubuntu LTS
doesn't have as long a support period, but it's still longer than
openSUSE, Fedora or normal Ubuntu.

(Once upon a time Debian was a good distro for people that refused to
upgrade, but now that Debian has gotten better about releasing every
couple years it also has a more limited support period.)

I am aware of what "no longer supported" means. What it means to me is, if
they come out with a change that I want, I will upgrade to get it. They
should not be taking my package repository hostage to force me to do this.

You should not be using SUSE 10.1 on a system connected to the Internet.

The same precautions that should be taken by anyone using any computer work
equally well for everyone. This includes those using old versions of

if a vulnerability is found in Apache, for example.

I choose to upgrade if it means getting something I want out of it. If it's
just about security, my other measures are good enough for me.

Or install FreeBSD. upgrading the ports collection is TRIVIAL compared to
upgrading any of the distros you mentioned. If I had my way, that's what I
would do.

You seem to feel awfully entitled to a free service. Perhaps you have
have considered investing in some hard drives and setting up your own
mirror? Perhaps even contributing some bandwidth by getting added to the
public mirror list?

I do not know why the packages were pulled, but I doubt it was done to
force anyone to do anything. More likely it was to save space, bandwidth
and avoid any appearance of continuing support.

I repeat, if you wanted long term support you should have payed for it.
Either with a support subscription, or else with your own hardware and
bandwidth.

Subject: [PLUG] Preparing for a distro change
Message-ID: <48CFBE49.2010108@comcast.net>

It looks like it's time to bite the bullet and switch to a newer distro,
or a newer version. In either case, whether I switch to a flavor of
Ubuntu, or just upgrade to SuSE 11.x, things will happen to my home
directory. I understand that if I change from SuSE 10.1 to Ubuntu I'll
need to re-install everything. But, if I just upgrade from SuSE 10.1 to
SuSE 11.x (I haven't spent the time to know which version makes sense
for me), how do I figure out what changes will happen to /home/rsteff?
How do I know which things I've added, like VMware Server, will survive
the upgrade, and which ones won't? This time around I have a mostly
empty large hard drive added to the machine where I can put a complete
copy of /home/rsteff -- I could even put a complete copy of the drive
with SuSE 10.1 on it. If I do that, will it help recover from changes I
don't know will happen?

Another issue is remembering what I've installed over the years. There
are likely to be programs that I don't use often, but when the time
comes, will they be there if I upgrade from 10.1 to 11.x? Is there some
way to create a list of things I've told YaST to install so I could tell
it to do it again after the upgrade?

It looks like I'll be able to attend the clinic this Sunday. Assuming I
want to bite the bigger bullet and switch to a flavor of Ubuntu, what
can I do ahead of time to make it easier for the volunteers to help me
do that install there?

Thanks for any advice.

I'm pretty sure I mentioned exactly that in my first post. Once I figure out
how to do that properly, I will do that.

My beef is more that the packages are so version-dependent. This is nothing

This is nothing short of a deliberate technical decision. Most of the
Linux community values access to source code over backwards
compatibility. Package version requirements are merely a reflection of
the reality that compatibility can not be assumed, it must be tested.
Doing so is expensive. Commercial options like RHEL and SLES provide
that service by backporting bug fixes, security updates, and even
certain features. Free distros simply don't have the resources.

Good or bad, the Linux community does things differently than the
proprietary world or even the BSDs. The Linux method is not designed to
make life hard for you, it is a collection of deliberate technical and
cultural responses to the complexity of software development.

Sixty seconds of quality time with Google turned up the following:
http://en.opensuse.org/Mirror_Setup_Howto
http://en.opensuse.org/Mirror_Infrastructure

Of course that's for a full fledged mirror. If all you want is personal
use, gather all the RPMs into a directory. Use createrepo to turn it
into a YUM repository. Register the repository with rug (rug sa).
Subscribe to the repository (rug subscribe).

I'm not interested in spending any more of my time writing a more
detailed set of instructions or searching for a better set of
instructions. It isn't hard, but I don't want to do enough work that you
start feeling I also owe you my free services.

Dick,

   They shouldn't if /home is on a separate partition. Of course, you should
always back up those file systems you want to restore as they were.

   That will help. As a practice, whatever you install yourself that's not
part of the distribution should go in either /usr/local or /opt. Those are
not overwritten by the installation of a different distribution. At least,
not the most famous ones.

Dick,

Using the command
    rpm -qa

under SuSE Linux should list all your INSTALLED packages.  That will give
you an idea of what software you need to reinstall (other than new
dependencies).

If /home is installed on another partition, you don't have to worry about
that being impacted by the new install.  However, you should back it up. 
A new Linux version max expect certain config files (or new parameters) in
your personal directory and may not work correctly.  If you're staying
with SuSE, there's been some discussion about that with the new version of
KDE, but I haven't followed all the conversations.

I'd also backup /etc and tuck that away into a new location to ensure you
don't overwrite anything important there (after tweaking your system).

Best of luck.

Tim

Yes, it gave me quite a list. I pointed the output of the command to a
text file. There are 910 lines in that file. While I haven't gone over
every line, I do recognize some of the file names. I suspect that's not
the productive way to approach the problem, but I'm glad to know it exists.

As I mentioned in my reply to Rich, /home is not in a separate
partition, but rsteff is, and is the only place anything exists in
/home, so I've pretty much got that covered. But, as you mention, there
will be some things done to /home/rsteff during the installation to
configure some of the programs. So I definitely will have a copy of
rsteff kept in a different location just in case.

Good point. I know I've tweaked fstab. There are probably others that I
don't recall -- things that I had to do early on, but work fine and
don't need attention after that.

                    M-1625, actually

Ubuntu is mostly installed and set up.  The Realtek 8187 is a
problem, though not as expected - there is an open source driver,
but there are apparently some issues between the driver and
Network Manager.  I expect a future upgrade will fix that, my
sister won't be using the wireless in the near term, anyway.

The only other problem I've encountered so far is Real Player.
It works stand-alone, but there are problems plugging it into
Firefox 3.  PDF and Java and Flash and Totem and all the other
stuff appears to be working.

Still remaining is setting up VMware.  I would use the Ubuntu-
preferred VirtualBox, but I've already done VMWare on many 
other machines, and I have tweaked vmdk images ready to install.

I expect to be bringing the laptop to the Clinic this Sunday
and finishing it off in the presence of other Ubuntees.  I've
done a lot of work with Redhat distros, and BSD and SysV 
before that;  more exposure to the Ubuntu way of doing things
will help a lot.

You can also try

  rpm -qa --last

which will give you installation dates and order the packages from most
to least recently installed. It might help you narrow down the "special"
ones which you have installed since the original system creation.

Slightly OT: rpm also supports a bunch of other reporting options... for
instance, this command will tell you how much disk space each
installation is taking up, and you can sort it from biggest to smallest:

  rpm -qa --queryformat "%-15{SIZE} %{NAME}\n"  | sort -nr

Subject: [PLUG] Hardware puzzle of the day - desktop won't boot
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0809170807090.29169@grond.sourballs.org>

Seeking advice/opinions on the following situation:

6-year old homebuilt PC, ASUS motherboard, Athlon CPU, OpenSuSE 10.1 (not 
that I think that part is relevant.)

About a week ago, I came downstairs and discovered the machine was off.  
It was on when I left it the previous evening.

I pushded the button, and the fans whirred up. No other activity - no 
POST, no HDD noise or lights.

I thought that maybe the power supply was bad, so I removed it and put it 
into a spare machine (that didn't have a power supply). That machine 
booted normally.

I put the power supply back into the sick machine, and unplugged all the 
drives.  Same result - fans whir, no POST or HDD activity.

I removed the memory.  Same result - fans whir, no POST or HDD activity.

So now I am thinking it's the motherboard, and I order one of the only two 
mobo's Newegg offers that still supports 462(A) socket processors, the PC 
Chips M848A.  Wait for it to arrive....

It arrived yesterday. So I carefully disassembled my sick PC, put in the 
new mobo, reassembled it, turned it on... and no change. Fans spin, no 
POST, no HDD activity. 

Take out the memory, disconnect the drives, restart - same behavior.

Swap in a pouer supply from my wife's machine - same behavior.

Remove the CPU - same behavior.

So I'm at a loss for what to do next (aside from "buy a new computer").

I suppose it's possible that my old mobo is bad, AND the new one is also - 
or that the CPU has died, or that the old mobo is bad, and I damaged the 
CPU in moving it from one machine to the other.  

How can I test these various possibilities? Are there other possibilities 
that I am overlooking?

(A further note - the HD is fine; I moved the hard drive to the spare PC, 
put the power supply back in, and it booted up fine, which is how I'm 
typing this e-mail. Unfortunately, the spare machine doesn't support my 
graphics card.)

All comments welcome, thanks in advance-

Well from what I can see, the only thing in common before and after the mobo
swap is the CPU (you already tried removing RAM).
It is possible the CPU is dead or died during swap.  However I will say my
limited previous experience with PC Chips mobos is negative, so I wouldn't
rule out both mobos being dead either.

My experience with PC Chips was with a previous job, Linux rackmount servers
reseller, we normally used a certain range of motherboard brands, but for
the entry level machines we had to switch to a new one, and chose PC Chips.
They worked for a while but tended to have a higher failure rate, or other
defects, than other low end mobos.  The higher end machines used Tyan mobos
mainly.

So I would see if you can try another mobo with your CPU (preferably another
brand), or if not, return the PC Chips to NewEgg, they have good customer
service.

David,

   A couple of years ago I experienced my first CPU failure in 20 years.
You've replaced everything but that, so that's what I suspect as the source
of the problem.

   Can you borrow a socket-compatible CPU for testing, or bring the unit to a
store that might have such a CPU available for testing?

   If not, I'd go with a new ASUS motherboard, new CPU, and new RAM if the
old sticks won't work. After 6 years you've gotten your money's worth from
that hardware and the cost of a complete upgrade is quite likely less than
the cost of the aggrevation and trying to fix the current engine and drive
train.

Good luck,

Rich

So far, it sounds like a no video condition. my idea would be to take 
out everything, most of which you've done,  and see if it will respond 
with no daughtercards, no drives, no nothing except the video card,  
memory, cpu. see if it will come up to bios. you might check the 
monitors. will the monitor work on other systems? might be an issue.

Good thinking on the video.
When trying to boot the suspect mother board and system, does the disk 
drive LED flash? Can you telnet or ssh into the box? Can you ping it 
from another machine?

Message-ID: <bfc61080809171633j79b1e7e8ubcad01bd96b33fba@mail.gmail.com>

Urgent FYI - As part of a fundraiser, WBAI is offering a 100 DVD set
of videos of the talks from 'the last HOPE' con for $250 donation.
There's a link to the live stream of the 'Off The Hook' radio show
where they're playing sample audio and have the donation ph# at

http://www.2600.com/offthewall/

Too rich for my blood, but I would chip in $25 if someone got it for
the PLUG library so we could 'check out' DVDs or maybe have some
viewing parties.  Never been able to go to HOPE, really sounds
incredible, and historically they charge at least twice as much to buy
the set outright outside the fundraiser, which ends in 27 minutes (5pm
PST).

Bult-in obsolescence is a deliberate decision, yes.

I'm not certain this is true, but it's hard to tell. I hear a lot more
complaints similar to mine than I do praise about how well things work
together... of course that doesn't mean much.

I should at least have the option to take the risk if I so choose. In fact,
I am doing this currently by searching for, and using, mirrors that still
have what I want. Even better would be if I could point my 10.1 installation
at a 10.2 package repository (for example), but that is forcibly denied as
well.

Yes, they do things differently. I happen to prefer a different way. Is that
so bad?

Your google-fu is apparently stronger than mine. I spent 10 minutes at it
and didn't find it, so shelved it for another time. Thank you. I would not
want you to do it for me, all I asked for was the link. I appreciate it a
lot.

You have options:
1) rpm --force (pretty much always a mistake)
2) compile from source
3) creating your own RPMs

As for switching to a different mirror, the only thing preventing you is
you not research how to register a new mirror.

Subject: [PLUG] Power On Problem
Message-ID: <48D2CBB2.1090404@comcast.net>

I've been working on getting my machine ready to take to the clinic on 
Sunday. I've made copies of /home and /etc on a spare partition on the 
machine's second drive. I moved my t-bird profile to this old Win98 
laptop. I shut down the desktop overnight. When I went to start it up 
just now, I got some beep codes. (I need to open up the case to remind 
myself what mobo is in there so I can go look up the codes.)

The immediate question is why it should have trouble starting up when 
it's cold. This has happened before when the power went off, and the 
battery backup ran down before I got home to discover it. I'll leave the 
power on for a while and see if, after warming up, it will boot.

Any other thoughts on what may be wrong?

While it's hare to sound out beep codes in text, here's an approximation:

Within 5 seconds of pushing the power on button I hear:

di-dit
pause
dit, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit

About 30 seconds later:
the floppy drive and CD drive lights blink once while the mobo beeps:
dit, dit, pause, dit

Consider the first di-dit and each pause to last the same length of time 
as one dit.

I can still power down by holding the power button in for a few seconds, 
the normal way to power down this mobo.

In the time it took to type this e-mail the board must have warmed up 
enough because the machine is now booting. Do I guess correctly that I 
may have a cracked trace on the board somewhere?

I have this problem with a SATA drive from Seagate. The track 
alignment is borderline and when cold, the boot file is not found. 
After 10 min. there is no problem. I copied the warm drive to another 
Seagate and there is no problem.

Look up your BIOS vendors support site and locate their boot up beep codes.

Isn't there a setting for some SATA drives to work similar a how a bunch 
of SCSI drives will?  I think it is at setting in the host adapter where 
the drive does not spin up until after and before the other drives have. 
  I think with SATA there is there is a setting to have the drive fully 
spin up before a seek is made.

Probably wishful thinking on my part but look in the BIOS settings for 
something like SATA startup delay.

If you think you'll have the opportunity to enjoy more PC
troubleshooting in your future, a POST code card is a worthwhile
investment:

http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=260288827933

It displays the BIOS POST codes as the machine is booting. Fancier
models (like the one above) keep a history of codes that can be
browsed later. Much easier than listening for beeps.

Subject: [PLUG] Mod_rewrite
Message-ID: <48D2E2C0.3010704@gmail.com>

I'm trying to set up a redmine rails server, and I've run into a
interesting (to me) problem.

I've set up the application to use mongrel_cluster (which requires
mod_rewrite, mod_proxy, and mod_proxy_balancer).

I've had problems accessing my svn repositories once the mod_rewrite was
added in.

What I am wondering is how to tell mod_rewrite to ignore the <Location
/svn-test> and allow the http request as normal.

Thanks

Thanks for all the suggestions.  Sorry I couldn't respond earlier, but my 
access is pretty limited right now.  As for these suggestions: The monitor 
works fine with other systems.  I tried pulling out all the daughtercards 
and rebooting, no change in behavior (fans whir, no lights or other 
activity, no video, no apparent checking for drives or peripherals).

I could no more ping, ssh, or telnet to this box than I could a 
cinderblock.

At this point, the only common factor I can come up with is the CPU, so 
I'm going to take a chance on a $25.00 recycled Athlon chip and see if 
that brings the system back to life.

BIOS beeps are almost always problems with the video card or memory. Try 
swapping each out.

David,

   Please let us know the results of this trial. I suspect the CPU because I
had similar symptoms in a system and it was quite frustrating to try
everything else with no positive results. We just don't think the CPU will
fail if it has been running for a while.

Subject: [PLUG] help me understand this pin-level kernel-interface stuff
Message-ID: <86myi4dsi7.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


This is way more low-level than I normally deal with from a
programming perspective (though, yes, i can solder big things).

In what is perhaps a recap of an earlier problem I asked about here,
oh, a year or so ago (last November-ish), I would like to be able to
poll the state of an external mechanical switch (off/on) from Linux
userspace.  That is, I want to be able the read /proc/<mumble>/switch1
and get a "1" when the switch is closed or a "0" when the switch is
open.  Or something like that.

The board I am dealing with is the Alix 3D3 [1].  I inquired to PC
Engines (the designer/vendor) about what I am trying to do, and they
pointed me at a pad on the PCB labelled "S1" which was unpopulated,
but intended for a "switch", probably like a reset switch of some
kind.

Sounds like it could be perfect.  Except for:

 a) I have only the barest whiff of an idea how to get the switch
    state information from Linux user-space; and

 b) I don't know what kind of switch I should be attaching, if there
    are conventions about what else (e.g. capacitor or resistors or
    whatever) to include in the switch circuit and whether or not
    those are already on the PCB.

As for exception (a), I looked at the schematic in reference [1] and
traced the S1 pad on the board to something called <MODESW#>, which
appears to be attached to ball C9 on the CPU.  If I consult the AMD
Geode LX Processors Data Book [2], I find that ball C9 appears to be
labelled DQ29 on the Memory Data Bus.  Beyond that, my understanding
begins to degrade rather rapidly and catastrophically.  Not to be
completely thwarted, I note that there are also three LEDs that are
have an LED driver in OpenWrt's Linux kernel, so I look there [3].
Clearly, the LED state (which are also connected to DQ pins 16,
28, and 19, respectively) is writable somehow using port I/O.

I would have some chance of writing a driver to poll the state of my
switch, under the following conditions:

 A) I could locate an example of some other driver polling a similar
    state; and 

 B) I had the foggiest idea how to translate the information in [2]
    into a port number and bit offset from which to read.

Could any helpful souls out there (and yes, I am talking to you Galen,
amongst others) either solve my problem in its entirety, or barring
that, gently shove me in the direction of a solution?

Thanks!

Seem like you need this file:
http://www.pcengines.ch/pdf/alix2.pdf
Page 18 has the port info for the LEDs and switch.
The switch is a user level switch separate from the reset switch.

You will have to write your own code for this if the kernel you have
doesn't have drivers that provide the needed access.  The reason you
have to write this for the IO ports is the ports are 32bit and /dev/port is
8 bit operations.

Neither of those are convenient, though both interfaces are present.
I am trying to stuff the switch into an already tight enclosure.  The
sole serial port is already in use and the two usb ports are already
being used and I'd rather not have a dangling hub.

Also, this switch thing is something I'd like to be able to learn.
It's clearly possible, even intended, I just have to cross the chasm
of understanding to get to the promised land.

Subject: [PLUG] Looking for suggestions / first-hand experience with tablet
	PCs.
Message-ID: <c834ec80809191119k78843a55m4f5460272e271a72@mail.gmail.com>

I'm seriously considering a Tablet PC for my next machine (to replace
the venerable T42p) and I'm defaulting to the Lenovo X61 tablet --
I"ve had fantastic experiences with my T42, and it seems like the
reasonable choice.  Before biting the bullet, however, I'd like to see
if anyone else has experience with tablets (running Linux, of course,
I very seriously could not care less how well they work under
windows).

My biggest hardware concerns are: screen resolution and battery life
(1280x1024 is *really* pushing what I can stand) and the ability to
drive suitably large displays when docked / at home.  (Where "suitably
large" would ideally be dual 1600x1200's, but could be as little as a
single 24" wide-screen.)  Anything less than 4-5 hours of battery life
is also probably a deal-breaker.

I'm also somewhat concerned about the software support for the
pen-based UI, and whether it will really be a viable means of input
when writing / coding on a plane.

Thanks!

I am a moron.  I was looking at the wrong Data Book.  I should have
been looking at:

  http://www.amd.com/files/connectivitysolutions/geode/geode_lx/33238G_cs5536_db.pdf

In which case, ignore all that nonsense about DQ pins.  They decode as
GPIO pins which makes a lot more sense.  As Larry pointed out, my
MODESW# is GPIO24.  That still leaves me with the problem of how to
read it in user space.

Yes.  Ubuntu makes use of sudo.  So, whenever the update manager asks
for a password, you should enter your own password, assuming you are
an admin on the machine.

If you do ever want to become root at the command line, just type "sudo su -"

There are other options ;)

Ah, I didn't mean to gloat -- e17 has been in progress for the
majority of that decade, if not longer, and it just reached a usable
state about a year ago.  It actually *isn't* vaporware anymore!

FVWM and the *box collection of window managers are also worth
consideration (openbox, blackbox, fluxbox).

Really slow, but not totally dead. Which means that, while I do have 
some spare time to fiddle with this, I need to spend some time looking 
for ways to get work during the slow time. There are some deals going 
down -- I even have one -- but they are few and far between. The folks 
doing the looking have crawled back into the woodwork the last couple of 
weeks, too.

This falls in the category of way off topic, but if anyone wants to see 
the current "Market Action," which is the real estate summary of what's 
going on in the state, contact me off list and I'll send you the pdf. I 
promise not to put you on a mailing list and send you weekly (or any 
other frequency) "updates" unless you ask for them.

Rogan,

   Didn't think you were gloating. I offered another option (Xubuntu).

   Back in the early days I tried twm, fvwm, fvwm2 (the latter two were too
much like Microsoft for me to tolerate), and a few others. Found xfce and
have been contented ever since.

Oh! I had similar concerns about FVWM[2] (although, they struck me as
being to much like CDE to tolerate, go figure :).  At one point, I ran
across some screen shots of FVWM looking absolutely amazing, and after
looking into it more I found it to be one of the most configurable
window managers / desktops around.

I'm glad you're happy with XFCE, and FVWM probably isn't a good
alternative given that, I just wanted to contribute some more info
about FVWM for the record :)

I have never used a tablet PC, but I do have some experience with a
Lenovo T61. Of all that you mention above, battery life is something I
would check out thoroughly. Lenovo claims 4-5 hours battery life for my
machine, but the best I can get is about two and a half. Yet I know
people running Windows on the same machine who get the rated battery
life. The majority of the problem is power management in Linux, which
evidently is not as smart as the Windows version. Do not ask me to
define "smart," as I have on a very dim understanding of how power
management works. There are also issues involving which kind of
graphics card your machine has. 

I strongly recommend the Thinkpad e-list:

The linux-thinkpad mailing list home page is at:
http://mailman.linux-thinkpad.org/mailman/listinfo/linux-thinkpad

I bet someone there will be able to answer your questions.

I also have a T61, but I have the integrated video (Intel, not NVidia),
and I get 4.5-5 hours on battery. This machine is maxed out with 4G RAM,
15.4" widescreen, 7200rpm 200G SATA2 drive, etc. 

So the rated battery life isn't a complete lie, but some options will
certainly prevent you from getting it.

I'm fairly comfortable with the advertised battery life ratings, at
least on thinkpads.  My T42 gets 4-5 hours on a fresh (and new) 9-cell
battery, and it has the most power-hungry video configuration I could
find for it.  (although I often turn down the screen brightness and
disable wifi if I really need the longevity).

My concerns about battery life are more to filter out suggestions of a
no-name tablet that gets an advertised 2-3 hours on a charge.

Subject: [PLUG] Adding Partitions to fstab in Ubuntu
Message-ID: <48D46EF2.7030901@comcast.net>

Just when you think you learned how to do something, they change things. 
(Well, they probably changed things a long time ago, but I'm just 
finding out!)

I saved a copy of fstab from my old install of SuSE 10.1. I figured I'd 
just copy parts of it for the new install. SuSE 10.1 used the old 
familiar hda1, hda2, hdb1, hdb2, etc. Ubuntu uses sda1, etc. So, off to 
the documentation to see what to do. There I learn that Ubuntu now 
recommends UUIDs instead of specific device names. The docs provided 
details on how to compose the lines to be added to fstab. There must be 
something wrong with the way I followed the instructions because when I 
restart the system it hangs. I was able to rename the backup copy of 
fstab and finish rebooting.

What I'm trying to do is mount the four partitions of my second hard 
drive at mount-points in my home directory, /home/rsteff. I followed the 
directions to list the drives by UUID:

rsteff at moonguide:~$ ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 2008-09-19 18:09 
2b235423-d1fe-47c9-afbb-f7bd1a23d686 -> ../../sda3

e0977a64-ba0a-4773-92b7-6d78f34be244 ->

All the partitions have ext3 file systems on them, and I can mount and 
read them with the Gnome gui tools.

I didn't see anything in the documentation about "realtime", but I 
guessed -- perhaps incorrectly -- that since that's what the other two 
partitions use, it should work for these four. Likewise for the entries 
for <dump> and <pass>.

Here is my fstab with the errant lines:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, where did I go wrong?

(BTW, I did have success with the rest of the install, even moving my 
T-bird profile back onto the desktop, from which I am sending this e-mail.)

Dick,
This is the only thing I noticed ...

# /dev/sda2
UUID=e0977a64-ba0a-4773-92b7-6d78f34be244 /               ext3
relatime,errors=remount-ro 0       1

should be realtime not relatime =)

Interesting. I didn't change that. I just checked and that's the way it 
is in the working copy of fstab!

Call iopl(3) to set the I/O privilege level for your user space
process and call inl() directly?

   Interesting comment. On all the portables I've owned (Toshibas, IBMs,
Sony) the battery life I get with my linux installations is about twice that
reported by the manufacturer with the default Winduhs installation.

FWIW, you can still do things the "old way".   For example, this works
on my system:

/dev/sda1   /   ext3   errors=remount-ro   0   1

as does the UUID way:

UUID=538f72a2-fbc0-454f-a058-32d1a0cae8b3   /   ext3   errors=remount-ro   0   1

as does the LABEL way:

LABEL=ubuntu   /   ext3   errors=remount-ro   0   1

They all work.  So if you are more comfortable with the "old way" feel
free to use that.

As for relatime, I have no idea when or why it would be used.  Seems
to be important if you use mutt (from the man page):

relatime
  Update inode access times relative to modify or change time.  Access
time is only updated if the previous access  time  was  earlier than
the  current  modify  or change time. (Similar to noatime, but doesn't
break mutt or other applications that need to know if a file has been
read since the last time it was modified.)

Doh!

relatime
Update inode access times relative to modify or change
time. Access time is only updated if the previous access
time was earlier than the current modify or change time.
(Similar to noatime, but doesn?t break mutt or other
applications that need to know if a file has been read
since the last time it was modified.)

One of the drawbacks to learning by copying what someone else did, and 
also being impatient, is not taking the time to fully understand 
everything.

OK. Correcting the realtime to relatime I try again and get what I think 
is the same error. I paid more attention this time as saw that it save 
the relevant lines in a log file:

Sat Sep 20 07:41:44 2008
----------------

 From the fsck man page:

The exit code returned by fsck is the sum of the following conditions:
8 - Operational error

Next, I used the tried and true troubleshooting technique of commenting 
out stuff until it works, and then putting things back, one at a time, 
until it breaks. I get a clean boot if I leave in the following:

# /dev/sdb1
UUID=e0410871-bb9b-4967-aa7c-4063a423c153 /home/music ext3 relatime 0 2
#
# /dev/sdb2
UUID=9615a8e5-76f8-4368-b745-b730df45c437 /home/photos ext3 relatime 0 2
#

But they don't do what I expect them to do. I expect large collections 
of mp3 files in /home/music, and large collections of jpg files in 
/home/photos. When I look in those locations they are just empty 
directories. Plus, those partitions are no longer listed in the "Places" 
menu. (The remaining two, that are commented out in fstab, still show up 
in the "Places" menu.)

So, I look at mount to see where they went and don't find them there, 
either:

I should have added that my T61 has the nVidia Quadro 140M. As I have
read often on the Thinkpad e-list, nVidia graphics will suck a lot more
current than the Intel or ATI options. 

I should also have added that I currently use Hardy x86_64, upgraded
from Gutsy. When I had Gutsy the battery life was an hour and a half.
One thing that happened after the upgrade to Hardy was that the screen
went dim after a few seconds of non-use while on battery. That never
happened with Gutsy. I think there were some other enhancements to
power management in Hardy, but I don't recall all of them. I think this
affected only the x86_64 versions - 32-bit users had better power
management from the beginning.

Also, when I am on battery it is because I am away from home, which is
wired for ethernet. I don't even use wireless at home. But when away
from home I am using wireless constantly, and that is a known power
sucker.

Fortunately for me, the two and a half hours I get now is adequate.
There are no classes that last more than two hours, and if I am in the
library there are always places available with an outlet for the brick. 

It is interesting to note the wide variety of experiences that people
here have with laptop battery life. There are a great many variables.

Message-ID: <98afdbcd0809200847pe7cd48et7423ef1773728175@mail.gmail.com>

I just ordered this Acer Extensa 4420-5239 from Newegg. I got great reviews
and for the price I thought I would give it a try. Here's the specs from
Newegg.com

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834115497

Someone mentioned that it has a Broadcom chipset that's not so Linux
friendly, but I didn't see that listed in the specs. It has a AMD M690G
chipset.

Has anyone had experience with one of these or other Acer laptops? The
reason I got this is to promote Linux by sharing the hdd with Vista to show
people how well Linux works. I'm doing a Linux workshop Oct. 25 and wanted
to show it off there. I plan to install Linux Mint, PCLOS or openSUSE on it.


Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks

David

You may find the powertop tool to be interesting to run.  Many people
don't realize how much impact userspace applications have on power
consumption, especially when they aren't "compute intensive" apps, and
some userspace apps are just stupid about performance/power issues.

Before I tried the old way, I decided to take one more close look at 
exactly what I typed. Turns out the problem was paying attention to 
details. I had pasted an invalid UUID number for one of the partitions 
(no idea where I got it), and I had left out my home directory name in 
the mount points -- i.e. I had /home/music instead of 
/home/rsteff/music. This works in my fstab:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# /dev/sdb1
UUID=e0410871-bb9b-4967-aa7c-4063a423c153 /home/rsteff/music    ext3    
relatime    0    2
#
# /dev/sdb2
UUID=9615a8e5-76f8-4368-b745-b730df45c437 /home/rsteff/photos    ext3    
relatime    0    2
#
# /dev/sdb3
UUID=5ae6428e-d0ab-4f71-8266-11e04a0cb070 /home/rsteff/backups    
ext3    relatime    0    2
#
# /dev/sdb4
UUID=802b6c08-f4c4-443a-9f22-5104642b543a /home/rsteff/spare    ext3    
relatime    0    2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All four directories are where I expect them to be.

As I quited in one of my earlier posts, the fsck man page has the following:

The exit code returned by fsck is the sum of the following conditions:
8 - Operational error

I think that's a polite way of saying operator error.

Thanks to all for the comments that caused me to look at things more 
closely.

If the wifi chip is Broadcom, depending on which one it is, you should be
able to use it still in Linux, either with the ndiswrapper (which uses the
Windoze driver), or with fwcutter, which uses a non-free (as in license not
price) firmware loader blob.  Most PPC laptop Macs have Broadcom wifi
chipset, and for ex. on my G4 PowerBook, after installing Ubuntu, using
their restricted drivers tool, it installed fwcutter and the necessary
Broadcom firmware, and it works like a champ.

Next time you are looking for a Linux compatible laptop, check places like
www.linux-laptop.net, for reviews of other Linux users.  Not sure how many
NewEgg reviewers run Linux... ;)
NewEgg is good stuff, no doubt, my current desktop has upgraded innards all
from NewEgg, just have to look elsewhere for Linux compatibility.
There is no review yet for this Acer on linux-laptop.net.... perhaps once
you get it up and running you should post about it on a blog or something
and submit it to them :).


PS- I'll see you at Lindependence Day (and our planning meeting), probably
with a laptop running Fedora.

They fail. All it takes is heat. Especially older Athlons. It's 
definitely on the list of the last things I would suspect in diagnosing 
hardware, but I have three dead P3'sand a dead Duron on my shelf that 
all went south because of insufficient cooling. The Duron is neato. It 
will now fry any motherboard you put it in. I honestly don't know why I 
still have it, but I did draw a skull and bones symbol on it with a 
sharpie. =]

Yeah, I tried that.  I'm moving to the theory that there is something
"wrong" with the board or the bios or the documentation, because that
isn't working.  I have a query in to the designer/vendor asking about
it.

Turns out the ports to control the LEDs don't seem to do anything
either.  I can send state to them, and read that state back, but the
LEDs don't change brightness.

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu GDM won't load
Message-ID: <48D7DA0D.8050103@comcast.net>

At the clinic yesterday I installed a hard drive mobile rack. Kieth's 
warning as I was leaving was that, since my (mumble) bus is a 133, and 
this rack is (something less) there may be a problem. There was no 
problem during the time the machine ran at the clinic with the rack 
installed. It also ran fine for a few hours last evening (powered up 
around 6:00). However, around 9:00 or so (not sure exactly), windows for 
applications I was running started to fade about 1/2 way and I couldn't 
do anything with them. I could access other windows, but then they'd 
start to fade, too. I decided to shut down and attack it in the morning. 
The shut down process took a very long time (10 minutes or more?). From 
time to time I could hear a relay click twice on the HD rack. Eventually 
the machine did shut down.

This morning I took out the cage and re-installed my hard drive. I got 
the following when I powered up the machine (I did it twice, same 
results each time):

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I put in Ubuntu CD and booted from that. X started as expected, and I 
can see all the hard drives' partitions -- 2 drives, 6 partitions.

So, the machine is running from the live CD. The first thing I'd like to 
do is to copy the .mozilla-thunderbird directory over to this laptop so 
I don't have synchronization issues while trying to solve the problem. 
Unfortunately, Ubuntu won't let me. It says I don't have permission to 
do so. How do I override the permissions so I can make a copy of that 
profile directory available on another machine?

After that, we'll start working on how to fix the main problem.

Subject: [PLUG] Received Mail difficult to forward
Message-ID: <48D7DC16.6050102@dslnorthwest.net>

I have received a few emails which contain text and pictures. These have come 
forwarded to me from a couple of different people.  When I try to forward the 
email the pictures are missing. (I am using Thunderbird 2.0.0.16).
I have tried "edit as new", but the pictures appear as icons.  I can select and 
save each picture individually (They are jpeg).  There are no attachments 
listed.  If I look at the location of the pictures I find that they are embedded 
in the message, e.g., 
mailbox:///fakename1/fakename2/.mozilla-thunderbird/is21drpp.default/Mail/Local%20Folders/Inbox?number=855297933&part=1.1.2&filename=image001.jpg

Can anybody tell me what is happening?  Is there a way for me to change the way 
TB handles these so that I can forward them without having to painfully 
reconstruct them by saving each image separately and attaching the saved images?

Thanks,
-Denis

Are you using compiz or some other composition manager? (do the
windows "wiggle" or turn transparent / desaturate / otherwise do
things that seem  strange and (largely) useless?)

The "window fading" thing seems like a compiz / compmanager issue, not
something disk-related.  Compiz is notoriously fickle <rant removed>.

That does sound odd though.

Try 'reset<cr>', it may be that the shell is just a bit confused,
since it looks like things started up.  Ctrl-alt-F2 (or f3, f4... etc)
to switch to a new vt may also get you to a usable terminal.

You probably need to use sudo (or otherwise become root) to get access
to the user directories you want to see.

Nab a copy of /var/log/Xorg.0.log and send that to us, if you can,

Here they are. Neither of these appear to be locked, so I should be able to put edited copies back, if needed.

Possibly. I've only been using Ubuntu 8.04 since Thursday. I have noticed a few behaviors that I'd not seen before.

Hmm. Self-repairing machine. I just tried shutting down the live CD and rebooting. The system came up OK.

Further messages will come from there.

Ah, good, I suppose :)

My gut feeling is still that you have some unstable X composition
manager running that is occasionally just going to crash, and likely
suck up your memory / processor.  I strongly suggest disabling
anything like that.  ('ps -ef'  or 'ps auxww' should be helpful in
tracking down such a beast.)

To confirm, the system stops when - or just after the /etc/rc.local
script. If I'm hearing you right, this is a new installation, with
nothing in the /etc/rc.local script which could stop the install. 

S99rc.local is a script in the /etc/rc2.d/ directory. That means all
other Start scripts (which start with an S) with numbers less than 99
have run OK. I think two other scripts run in this directory just after
- (if I'm assuming right, that scripts are run in alphabetical order).

S99rmnologin
S99stop-readahead 

Since the rmnologin script does start the display manager, that seems to
confirm your suspicion of a problem with GDM.

In any case, if there are problems with the noted scripts, you should be
able to boot into recovery mode. It brings up a mostly blue screen,
where you can select an option like "drop to root shell prompt" 

where you have administrative access - and should also have networking.
At that point you'll be able to copy the files you want for the
"syncrhonization" you've described.

Thanks,
Mike

I don't know what it is called in Thunderbird, but with the text-
based Mutt mailer this is called a "bounce" instead of the normal
"forward".  Bounce sends a duplicate of the message, attachments
and all, to the email address specified in the bounce command.
Hopefully, TB has something similar, and perhaps the name will
help you find it.

I find "bounce e-mail" or "bounce mail" to mean returning to the sender:
DEFINITION - Bounce e-mail (sometimes referred to as bounce mail) is electronic 
mail that is returned to the sender because it cannot be delivered for some reason.
Except: Some products and users use the term bounce to mean "forward a received 
note to someone else."

That in fact is what I tried to do.  Usually, I can forward a message having 
attachments, and the attachments appear in the copy.  Same with "edit as new": 
the attachments are attached to the copy which I am editing.

However, TB shows the troublesome mail as having no attachments.

Investigating more, I saved the email as a file (A file menu option in TB).  I 
then opened the resulting saved file using Kmail.  It shows it as an HTML 
message having 24 attachments (the images).  It lists various message part types 
as multipart/alternative, Plain Text Document, multipart/related, HTML Document, 
and JPEG Images. (I have never used Kmail before. but it tells me much more 
about this message than TB does.)

It seems at this point that this is a TB issue with this type of message. My 
guess at present is that the problem is that it is an HTML message.  I searched 
a little for another HTML message, but the one I found did not have attachments, 
so I cannot determine if all HTML messages suffer the same fate.  Time to Google 
some, now that I have a suspicion of what to look for.

I can attest to this, my work laptop is a T61 with the NVidia graphics
and the battery life under both Linux and Windows is significantly
shorter than the T42P it replaced.

   And I can vouch for the excellent service provided by Emperor Linux. They
are well worth the price they charge for their portables.

Subject: [PLUG] Missing emails
Message-ID: <48D91FD1.8070401@frankhunt.com>

Last week I was dropped from one of the yahoo groups I belong to due to 
"excessive email bounces".  Yahoo groups has a bounce threshold set 
that, if exceeded, triggers cancellation mail from that group.  The 
stated reason for the last bounce was "no mx or a records for 
frankhunt.com".  This appears to be an intermittent problem, since my 
email is generally running fine.  As a test, I joined another yahoo 
group that sends a test email every hour.  I joined yesterday at 6PM and 
have only received four emails since (6pm, 7pm, 9pm, 11pm).  Something 
is very wrong here.  My ISP is Comcast.  Incoming mail for my domain is 
routed to my system by dynamic dns through zoneedit.  I use Comcast smtp 
for outbound.

Does anyone have any ideas where I should look?

Thanks,

According to dnsreport.com, the only questionable part of your setup is your 
that your mailserver returns "server2.frankhunt.com" but the A record 
is "frankhunt.com", which is a violation of RFC821. It's not likely that 
causes you to lose email, though.

Have you checked your Postfix logs?

Start with your mail server logs.  Typically /var/log/maillog.  See if 
the connections are even coming in.

I just saw Aaron's post and I'll say I've had many problems with Yahoo. 
  Some of those directly related to DNS issues.  Each mail server Yahoo 
uses seems to make up it's own mind on what to do with questionable DNS 
entries.  Get this fixed and as those changes propagate look at the logs.

I just tried a telnet to your server and it responds quickly.  But that 
made me think of a problem an ISP I worked for had with Yahoo and its 
groups.  User Quality.  The typical postfix install has a header_checks 
file that catches Yahoo Groups all the time.  Six (6) of the same 
character in a row.  Your logs should show this as 'ACL 3' message.

The logs look fine as far as I can tell.  I did find that I was blocking 
some IP's owned by yahoo with IPtables and removed that.  If the "no mx 
or a records for frankhunt.com" is really the error they are seeing (and 
not a result of a timeout or garbage collection), then nothing would 
ever reach my site since it can't be located, right?  If that is the 
case then I won't see anything in the logs.

There is no entry in header_checks to filter out yahoo.  Spamassassin is 
not catching these emails either.

After getting reinstated, I am receiving mail from the yahoo groups.  It 
is interesting that one of the earlier emails from them was the one that 
told me that they couldn't find my mx record.

Other ideas?

Denis,

Please post the results of your research.  I am having the same problem 
with TB 2.0.

The only way I have found around the situation is to save the email as a 
file to my desktop and attach it to a new message, then delete the saved 
file...should be an easier method in such a popular email client.

That could explain some of the random-ish delivery.  Different outbound 
SMTP servers for the messages.

Some mail server software has been known to attempt to deliver to the 
other hosts or the domain's default IP.

You do have a MX record but your server is replying back with a 
different name so that could cause problems though intermittent delivery 
doesn't seem right.

Well the six-character-in-a-row was what was catching Yahoo Groups mail.

I've seen that before.  In fact it probably is a Yahoo Group list.

> Other ideas?

Did your logs show a delivery attempt (connection) for hourly emails you 
didn't get?

How about sending to another email account.  Gmail, Yahoo?  See if they 
are having problems.  If you find a good account have it forward to you 
server.  Kludgy but workable.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0809231212080.2901@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Within pine I have an alternate role for my e-mail address at a different
domain. When I begin to compose a message I'm asked whether to use the
default role. All this works just fine.

   However, when I receive a message addressed to this alternate domain and I
want to send a response, it's not automatically sent from that alternate
role. Nor am I offered the opportunity to select the appropriate role.

   I've not found where I can fix this behavior. If it's a selection in Setup
-> Rules -> Roles, I've not connected what I see there with the behavior I
want. Could someone point me in the right direction?

I installed OpenSuSE 11.0 (x86-64) on a system that has this sound card, and it was not detected. I could not install the beta driver that was made available in April of this year. I understand that this problem also exists with other distros.

Strangely enough, sound does work when Linux is installed as a VMWare image and run on Windows XP, using the same hardware. In this case the driver is snd-ens1371, which cannot be installed in a native Linux installation. 

I'm wondering if anyone knows something more current about this. Some users, of course, have just substituted better-supported hardware for this card.

Rich,

I'm using Alpine 2.00, so the menu options may be different than they 
are in the Pine 4.64 you're using. In Alpine, there's a section under 
Rules -> Roles called CURRENT MESSAGE CONDITIONS BEGIN HERE. In that 
section, you can set the To: address that triggers a role change.

The change ends up reflected in the "patterns-roles" directive in 
.pinerc.

Robert,

In general (but not all cases) an OS running under VMWare does not talk to the
actual hardware.  VMWare emulates "virtual hardware" that will work with, often
a very simple, driver under the OS that is being hosted.  Thus in your case you
get sound with Linux under VMware as Linux is using a very
simple/common/generic driver which is talking to the fake VMware hardware which
is in turn talking to the "real" Win32 X-FI driver.

Message-ID: <48D96951.5020300@comcast.net>

I just installed Google Earth on my Ubuntu machine. When the install 
script finished I let it start the program. I "visited" a bunch of 
places, setting place marks as I went. Eventually it froze. I was unable 
to shut down the program, and as I switched to other running programs, 
they froze. Eventually the system no longer responded to mouse and 
keyboard actions and I had to power cycle the machine to get it running 
again. When I did, I got a message telling me to run fsck on /dev/sda3. 
That's /home on my system. fsck warned against running it on a mounted fs.

Do I need to stop X and run from the terminal?

When I tried to umount /home I was told it couldn't be done. I was only 
running a terminal window at the time, but now that I think about it, I 
assume there are some hidden files related to X, or maybe something 
else, that have to be closed.

You will need to unmount /home, and the simplest way to do that is
probably to boot up into single-user mode  (I *think* there's an
option in the default grub boot screen to boot into a rescue mode, or
something like that.  If not, you can edit the grub boot line by
poking around in the menu before you select something.  details:
http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/grub-boot-into-single-user-mode/ )

Once in single user mode, you can check to see if /dev/sda3 is mounted
by running 'mount', and if it is, unmount it:

'umount /dev/sda3'

then fsck it:

'fsck /dev/sda3'

When that finished, just reboot:

'shutdown -r now'


(don't type any of the quotes above, they just delimit the actual commands)

Paul,

   Same menus. I've had the To: pattern set to rshepard (at) twodogs (dot) us, but that
doesn't seem to work. I'll get a message addressed that way, but my response
will be from appl-ecosys.com, and I'll see my sig on the reply as I write
it. That's why I thought there was something else I was missing. Or, do I
have incorrect syntax on that line?

Thanks,

Rich

I think I've noticed a way to interrupt the boot process while grub is 
getting started.

That's true enough, and it's certainly the easiest way. If you're 
dying to avoid a reboot,

1. logout as you
2. in a non-X environment, login as root
3. run "lsof /home" to see what processes have open /home files
4. kill said processes
5. umount /home
6. fsck  /home
7. mount /home

I don't know. I key roles on folders, not addresses, so I've never 
really tested that configuration space.

Since it's an Ubuntu box, you'll also have to set a root password:

$ sudo bash
<enter your user's password>
$ passwd   # change root's password
$ exit

   "Folder?" Is that a directory? I have files in ~/mail, but all the
alternate role messages arrive in the INBOX, not a separate one. Perhaps I
need to read again about pine roles.

Thanks,

Rich

My searching turned up little--mostly dated information.  One entry I found 
said, in effect, do not use HTML email.

One thing I did which worked was to change to forward mail as an attachment 
rather than in-line (edit/preferences/composition). I sent the mail to myself, 
and the attachment opened with the pictures visible.  Not a convenient solution 
either, but perhaps better than saving and attaching.

Should this be reported as a bug?

I think we are making this more complicated than it needs to be.

mount -o remount,ro /home
fsck -y /home
mount -o remount,rw /home

Problem Solved, no reboots, do not pass go, do not collect $200.

Subject: [PLUG] Google Earth in Ubuntu
Message-ID: <48D9A754.40108@comcast.net>

I installed Google Earth from a .bin file I downloaded in April. I used 
the command:

sudo sh GoogleEarthLinux.bin

When if finished I had the option of quitting or starting the program. I 
didn't think about the fact that the program would be running with root 
privileges and went ahead and started it. It worked for a while and then 
failed (as reported in an earlier set of posts). Once I recovered from 
that problem I tried running it again. The splash screen displayed and 
the program window opened, but the star field did not move and the earth 
did not appear. I went looking on the web for folks with similar 
experiences and found the warning about not running it at the end of the 
install. I found another instruction on how to uninstall it, did so, and 
then tried re-installing it the "right" way. Same result -- program 
window but no earth. I uninstalled it again and found that there is a 
package for it, so installed it once again with apt-get. Same problem.

Any ideas on what to do next?

That still won't work if there is a process with a file open for writing on
/home.

Also, re: setting a password for root, sudo passwd works.

I would install and run it as a normal user, not root.  Also, I would
get into Tools > Options and check the box for using graphics "safe
mode".

I have three computers that I try to run it on.  On the ultra-cheap
nvidia geforce 2 card, it works like a champ.  On the ATI Mobility, it
works but I have to be careful or it will crash.  On the new, fancy CAD
workstation at work with a modern nvidia card, it immediately crashes X.
To really troubleshoot googleearth, one needs to take hardware into
acount.  What kind of graphics card do you have?

This is acting like a DNS server with a very short TTL and less than

Size refers to the number of 8 bit locations decoded by the PCI device 
beginning at the given I/O address.  lspci is just telling you how 
each Base Address Register(BAR) is programmed and the size of each 
region.  See section 6.2.5 of the PCI 2.2 spec.  So for Region 0 
above, the device will respond to I/O reads and writes at I/O address 
0x00006000 through 0x00006007.  Note that this does not necessarily 
mean that you can use any size of i/o transaction you want.  For 
example, it could require the use of 8 bit or 16 bit i/o transactions 
to properly access the registers.

The PCI spec is not freely available, but you might want to try 
searching for it anyway.

If you have ubuntu, google earth is in the non-free medibuntu 
repositories which is how I installed it on my system. Thats the easiest 
way I know to install google earth on ubuntu and it might help you work 
around your installation issues.

Except on this specific device the IO has to be 32 bit IO  transactions.

I think he meant the DNS provider for your domain. Comcast doesn't host
domains, to my knowledge. In the case of frankhunt.com, the DNS provider
would be ZoneEdit. I used to work for the company that just bought them out
(Dotster) so I would not be surprised if they suddenly started having a lot
of "Issues"

I tried that, too, with the same results. I followed some instructions I 
Googled and added medibuntu, yesterday.

I just tried to re-install it with Synaptic, but I don't find it in the 
applications menus, nor is there an icon on the desktop, like yesterday.

I did have it installed once and it worked fine. I uninstalled it
because I didn't find any particular use for it. It is currently listed
in Synaptic on my Hardy x86_64 computer. I found it just by searching
on "google" in Synaptic.

Must be that you don't have quite the right combination of repositories
enabled. Also, I sometimes note that if I am using the server at PSU or
OSU sometimes not all applications are available that I can get when I
use "Server for the United States."

No, it's a mail folder (aka mailbox). I use Alpine to poll multiple 
inboxes on multiple servers. I use procmail to filter new messages 
into various folders.

The role used in composing and replies is determined by which folder 
is open at the time. If I'm reading mail in my "plug" folder, for 
instance, my madboa.com role becomes the default. For other mailing 
lists, I use my work address.

Paul,

   If I correctly understand, each mbox file is a mail folder/mailbox.

   Here procmail filters messages from one server into the different folders,
but I don't have a separate one for the alternate domain (used only for
personal mail).

   Then I need a separate folder for the personal mail that uses the
alternate domain and figure out how to specify that in the pine setup.

Thanks,

Rich

Right. All my mail is mediated by IMAP servers, so I'm not always sure 
about the underlying storage format (it's Maildir in at least one 
place, the one I manage :-) -- but if you're using mbox, then each 
file is a folder/mailbox.

That's one solution -- and probably the one I'd pick. Keeping mail 
sent to different addresses in different folders seems quite natural 
to me.

The procmail ^TO_ expression makes it quite easy to match the 
recipient address.

Only semi-off-topic: you might give Alpine a try. It's the successor 
to Pine and is quite stable:

4Front Technologies has a driver that will work with sound output, but not the microphone. This high-end card is becoming increasingly popular, so there will probably be people clamoring for better Linux support.

I installed OpenSuSE 11.0 (x86-64) on a system that has this sound card, and it was not detected. I could not install the beta driver that was made available in April of this year. I understand that this problem also exists with other distros.

Strangely enough, sound does work when Linux is installed as a VMWare image and run on Windows XP, using the same hardware. In this case the driver is snd-ens1371, which cannot be installed in a native Linux installation. 

I'm wondering if anyone knows something more current about this. Some users, of course, have just substituted better-supported hardware for this card.

Another troubleshooting tactic might be to run with the xorg "nv"
driver.  Googleearth will run horribly slow because the gl calls will be
implemented in the mesa software, but it will run (if the issue is the
video, not the app itself).

Thanks. I'll keep that in mind. Right now the problem is finding from 
where to start the program! Once that's solved, then, if I still have 
trouble with the program hanging up, I'll give that a try.

If you ever do get it working, and you have a 32-bit machine, this is a
worthwhile tweak:

http://groups.google.es/group/earth-linux/browse_thread/thread/e10a5337b0b47ba1#

It not only made the fonts big enough to read, but it made the app
launch faster.

When you run the googleearth.bin installer as a normal user, does it
create a ~/google-earth/ directory, and a symlink ~/googleearth that
points to ~/google-earth/googleearth?  If so, launch it by typing
./googleearth from your home directory.

"lsof /home" will provide the process id of the processes that have
files open in the /home directory, so they can be killed with the kill
command before unmounting the filesystem.

When I tried to install it by running sudo googleearth.bin I got an icon 
on the desktop that looked like a piece of paper with a padlock and an x 
on it. Here's what was inside:

It might be too late now that you've uninstalled it, but it may have been
worth trying to run sudo /opt/google-earth/googleearth as referenced in the
"Exec" line of that file.

It might still be worth a try.

You should take "sudo" out of the equation.  Just install it as a normal
user.  Forget the root stuff.

On one of my attempts I tried that. There were several error messages

Note that CERN collects 15 petabytes of data per year off the sensors,
and the "interesting" events travel a multi-Gbps pipe over to Argonne
and other labs in the U.S.  So CERN created the web, which created
Linux, which got standardized into SL for science/array usage at
Fermilabs, which runs the Large Hadron Collider experiments at CERN.

I have been checking zoneedit daily and all seems fine.  It also appears 
that Y! Groups does not send everything that it is supposed to.  As a 
diagnostic, I subscribed to a group that sends a test message every hour 
just to see if I get them all.  Well, every hour in yahoo-speak is five 
per day.  The group web page shows "Most Recent Messages" and they are 
at 5,6,7,9 and 11 PM daily.  Not quite every hour.  So, my cut at this 
is that it is some kind of yahooproblem.  I have been hassling their 
support desk and things seem better as a result.  Of course they have 
not indicated what they have "fixed"  ;-0

Now that is odd, considering it installs everything in your home
directory.  It makes one directory there called "google-earth", and a
symlink in ~/ that points into there.

Is your user account a local one, or is it a network account (like
Active Directory)?  In other words, does your user account actually
exist in /etc/passwd?

Could there be group membership issues with your user account?  On my
gentoo box, here's what I look like:

ckonstanski at sphinktop:~$ id
uid=1000(ckonstanski) gid=407(ckonstanski)
groups=10(wheel),16(cron),18(audio),27(video),407(ckonstanski),443(plugdev),446(vmware),455(wireshark),456(davfs2)

You certainly don't need all of these to run googleearth, but wheel and
video would be good ones to have, I would think.

And lastly: I have been meaning to try this myself, but haven't gotten
around to it.  What happens if you boot up with knoppix and try to
install googleearth?  This would take the particulars of your distro
installation out of the equation.  You would need enough RAM to run both
knoppix in full GUI mode and the googleearth install, which would
reside in a ramdisk.  You can dramatically decrease the memory footprint
by using a non-KDE desktop.  Here is a page that shows how:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Knowing_Knoppix/Alternatives_to_KDE

If it works in knoppix but not in your installation, then your
installation is somehow suspect.  As you pointed out, it probably has to
do with permissions, either with writing files or accessing system
libraries.  strace would show all reads and writes during the
installation process.  Perhaps this would reveal that you are missing a
required library, or that a library is in an unexpected location (or any
other read/write problem).

I have one geforce2 card in my posession; it is in my server.  I am
reluctant to install googleearth there, but I'll bite the bullet and do
it.  The card is:

nVidia Corporation NV11 [GeForce2 MX/MX 400] (rev b2)

I am running the binary nvidia driver there.  That will have to stay.  I
am using nvidia driver version 96.43.07.  That is a pretty old version.
I have not been able to run a newer one on this box.  It must have to do
with the age of the card itself.

Another possibility is that, in the repeated attempts at installation, some
directory
or directories in ~ got created by root and not removed, which would cause
errors
when attempting to install as a normal user.

Subject: [PLUG] Blackboard, Javascript and Ubuntu
Message-ID: <20080929213948.4b7a4d53.johnxj@comcast.net>

The combination doesn't work. 

In the past PSU used WebCT and I had no problem with it using Firefox
on Ubuntu. However, Blackboard bought out WebCT to eliminate their
competition, or some such Gatesian maneuver. As a result PSU has gone
to Blackboard. 

When I log in I get two popups from "Netx" (whatever that is), both
asking me to choose a cache directory and suggesting /tmp. The window
also says "Open Source JNLP Client." Does anyone know what this is all
about?

After logging in I see "my Blackboard" listing the courses I am
enrolled in. I click on one of them and two more "Netx" windows pop up
asking me to specify a cache location. Then Firefox takes me to the
main page that the professor set up for Blackboard. I see the
professor's folders, but if I click on any of them Firefox crashes
summarily, leaving me with two little Javascript windows on the screen.

I have various Javas installed, but I don't understand much about them.
I'm thinking that I could add the kind of Javascript that Blackboard is
expecting. Does anyone know what flavor of Javascript Blackboard is
using?

According to PSU's help page, Opera is not supported, but Firefox is
supposed to work. I have Firefox 3.0 on Hardy, completely up to date.
Everything else works (flash, javascript, etc.).

Tomorrow I'll go to the university help desk to see if they have any
ideas, In the meantime, any suggestions welcome.

I'm not sure about using it with Linux - I'm taking a class but I'm
just using a windows machine to do it. Even so it complains about
Firefox in a couple places. If you look close doesn't it say that
Firefox 2 and 1 are supported? I don't think I ever saw anything about
3 and there have been a few messages I've gotten about potential
problems, and it definitely has NOT been flawless for me.

So I'm not sure if any of that helps much, but hopefully a little bit.
At any rate, it's not just Linux that Blackboard has issues with. I
guess if they're the only game in town they don't have to work quite
as hard to squash the bugs?

Though all in all I LOVE being able to take online classes. So nice to
be able to do it on my time!

So I've successfully been using Blackboard for my classes, but I'm on
Windows. But I have no idea how to figure out what kind of Javascript
they use. I didn't know there were different versions. And I thought
that Javascript had very little to do with the Java language?? But if
there's something I can inspect on my machine that would help you, let
me know.

Blackboard barely manages to function with optimized defaults, much
less anything that could be vaguely defined as non-standard. Optimized
defaults being Win XP, IE 6, and the latest Java updates. It'll do ok
in OS X as long as you don't try to use Safari, and Vista + IE7 is
it's own special nightmare.

You want actual Java, I'm not sure how Iced, Tea does with it, FireFox
has issues with uploading files in version 3.

                          <johnm at j2msolutions.com>

    According to Wikipedia, "Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is
    the planning of how business resources (materials, employees,
    customers etc.) are acquired and moved from one state to another."
    This includes issues like:
        * Accounting
        * Sales
        * CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
        * Purchasing
        * Inventory
        * etc.
    John will describe how xTuple's OpenSource offerings handle
    some of these issues.

Subject: [PLUG] USB Wifi adapters for 64 bit Linux?
Message-ID: <20080930103000.GA21320@gate.kl-ic.com>


I have my sister's laptop back for finishing off.  Got Realplayer,
a few media players, firewall, VMWare, etc. all working with
Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy.

After spending many hours trying to get a Realtek 8187B working
with Ubuntu 8.04 64bit and the default NetworkManager, I gave up
and decided to buy a USB wifi adapter instead.  That way, I can
test it out on my laptop before giving it to her.

The other interfaces on her laptop are Mini PCI Express and Express
Card, both of which have few chipsets with native Linux drivers, and
neither of which I can test on anything but her laptop.  I want to
avoid ndiswrapper if I can.

So, comes the question.  There are quite a few older USB Wifi
adapters out there that are known compatable with Linux, but few
reviews of what is in the stores right now.  I ordered a Trendnet
TEW-424UB 54M G card from Newegg ($10 after rebate) which appears
to work with the zd1211rw driver according to:
   http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Devices/USB
But of course, the manufacturers like to change the chips without
changing the device model number.   I may be out of luck.

So who has experience with USB Wifi adapters, and has bought one
very recently and got it working with native 64 bit drivers?

Keith

Hi, I'm an interested linux-using lurker. I think this is my first post to
the list. Greetings! Thanks to all for being so interesting :D

I've just had a couple classes with Blackboard, at PSU, and it worked for me
in Firefox on Ubuntu, even though the "official browser check" on
Blackboard said it was incompatible. Even with that fact, I was able to read
and post to the message boards and use the mail function.

I made sure I was using Sun's Java, which should get easier and easier to do
in Linux because they've GPL'd it. This page will tell you how to easily
specify which Java to use: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java

If that doesn't work, I'm not sure what needs to happen for you.

Good luck!
Jackson Cafazzo

despite the fact that opera has never officially supported (in my
experience with blackboard, anyhow), it has always worked to varying
degrees.  enough to download assignments and post emails.  sometimes
it looked hideous, but the links still worked.  it has been a year or
so since i used the combination and thus i probably can't speak to the
latest version.

while i suspect firefox 2 would be a solution to your problems, opera
might work better than you expected, and might be less of a hassle to
install than a separate version of firefox.

I'll have to hunt up my knoppix CD. I don't recall which kernel it is, 
but it's probably old enough that it's 2.4. I should probably download 
the current version and use that.

It's been a few days since I've had time to work on this, so I've lost 
track of just where I was in the process. I've also been pursuing this 
problem on the Ubuntu forum, and have another clue. One of the replies 
asked:

Google earth may not be logging on to the server,
Does it successfully connect when you start it? You should get a message 
something like
"Performing Google Earth server Login"

Well, just having the GUI does seem like it's not connecting with the GE 
server. I don't get that login message, but I don't get it on my XP 
laptop, either. But I do get a message about Google Earth initialization 
while the image of the earth is spinning in from the Atlantic ocean to 
the center of North America. And, there's a message about "My Places." 
Neither of those happen on my Ubuntu machine.

I did find /home/rsteff/.googleearth with root:root ownership and 
deleted it before the last install. It is there, now, with rsteff:rsteff 
ownership.

Oddly, it has a link in it:

lrwxrwxrwx  1 rsteff rsteff   11 2008-09-30 09:42 instance-running-lock 
-> /proc/25782

but I'm not currently running Google Earth. Also, currently there is no 
file 25782 in /proc. I recall seeing something like this last week. At 
that time I was unable to delete the link. This time I was.

I just started up Google Earth and found the link, again. In the 
terminal window, the link shows up with a light aqua color as long as 
Google Earth is running, but changes to a dark red color when I close 
GE. I assume there's some meaning related to good link/dead link (or 
something like that).

I've used a zd1211rw device in Fedora 9 and it "just worked", though
the particular model I've got doesn't appear to be sold anymore.

I don't know of such a group. But as a Network Engineer who has both participated in and provided this kind of training, I would be very interested in being involved in this at any level.

Thanks to doctor juno, chris and others for the suggestions.

When I upgraded Gutsy x86_64 to Hardy x86_64 the dist-upgrade left
Firefox 2 installed. Hence, it was trivial to give it a try. The
results were interesting. First, it crashed on Blackboard the same as
Firefox 3. And Firefox 3 was already running when I launched Firefox 2,
and when Firefox 2 crashed it also crashed Firefox 3. And when I
restarted Firefox 2 the popup "restore previous session" restored both
of them. I'm not sure what to make of that. It doesn't really matter,
because this is the first time I have even launched Firefox 2 since the
upgrade to Hardy. Except for Blackboard, Firefox 3 is totally stable
and does everything. Since Firefox 2 works no better than Firefox 3 on
Blackboard I see no reason to go back to it.

One other interesting thing: When I accessed the Blackboard page
Firefox 2 displayed a message at the top of the window that said I
needed additional plugins to view all the media on the page. When I
told it to install the additional plugins it was Java Runtime
Environment that it wanted to install. Unfortunately, the plugin was
not available. I clicked on the Manual button and it took me to Sun's
download site.

I suspected right from the beginning that the problem was Java.
Unfortunately, I know next to nothing of Java. I left Sun's site until
I figure out which version and module I need. A search in Synaptic on
"java" reveals that I have the following Java things installed:

icedtea-gcjwebplugin
icedtea-java7-jre
icedtea-java7-plugin
java-common
openjdk-6-jre
openjdk-6-jre-headless
openjdk-6-jre-lib
sun-java5-bin
sun-java5-jre
sun-java6-bin
sun-java6-jdk
sun-java6-jre

Lots of other things came up in the search, but those are the only ones
that I thought might be related to the issue.

Further suggestions welcome.

The obvious question is: are you running behind a web proxy?  A packet
trace could verify the quality of the connection.  I cannot remember if
googleearth obeys the environment proxy variables, or if (like the old
IE6 upgrade wizard) you have to wait forever for it to time out before
you have an opportunity to get into the proxy settings.

Looks like My Places is a .kml file in ~/.googleearth.  Also, I see a
lot of these when doing an strace:

stat64("/home/ckonstanski/.config/Google/GoogleEarthPlus.conf", {st_mo
de=S_IFREG|0600, st_size=2313, ...}) = 0

I was not aware that there is a ~/.config/Google directory.  Might want
to delete that, and ~/.googleearth, during the next reinstall.  strace
is handy!

There is a very good chance you were not actually running firefox 2
(since they crashed at the same time, I'm almost certain you just
spawned another window off of the running firefox 3 install).  It is
not at all easy to start up a separate instance of Firefox if one is
already running.  Without checking the About screen, you may not
notice any difference.

For what it is worth, "JNLP" is the Java Network Launch Protocol -- it
has nothing to do with Java*Script*.  JNLP is taking over where
Applets were used in the past.  If you are ever prompted for an
application to open something JNLP related, you probably want to use
'javaws'.

As another aside -- Sun's java is really the only *real* java.  GCJ is
still far, far from complete / stable.

To install the java plugin so you can run applets (which might help
here, it's worth a shot) try this:

First off, in firefox, go to: 'about:plugins' (w/out the quotes) and
look for anything java related, recording what's there if you want, or
just get a feel for what it looks like.

find a file at (or near):

/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.07/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so

The java-6-sun-1.6.0.07 part may be different, but you'll want the
directory in /usr/lib/jvm/ that has the "6" and the "sun" :) if that
matches more than one directory, then take the one with the highest
version number (the 1.6.0.07 part).

Once you've found the libjavaplugin_oji.so, copy it into:

/usr/lib/firefox/plugins/

Restart firefox and go back to 'about:plugins', and see if anything
changed wrt. Java.

Either way, give blackboard a shot and report back :)  (if it still
doesn't work, it would help to know what your about:plugins page says
about java.)
