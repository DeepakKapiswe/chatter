To get spamcannibal to work, I need to replace CentOS 5.6's perl-5.8.8 with
perl-5.12.1 or better.  How do I get yum update to work despite the fact that
I'm breaking the perl dependencies?  Can I get yum to report the dependencies
and then ignore them?  I need to know what I thinks is missing so I  
can cpan2rpm install them...

Michael,

I'm always reluctant to overwrite a core CentOS package like perl. Too 
many other utilities have perl tie-ins to make that an easily 
maintained solution.

My suggestion: create , e.g., /usr/local/spamcannibal. The build your 
own Perl and install it there. The use that perl, 
/usr/local/spamcannibal/bin/perl (or whatever), to build and install 
the other modules spamcannibal needs to operate.

In your mail configs, use that installation, rather than 
/usr/bin/perl, to run things.

Ideally, you'd keep track of everything you did for the build and 
codify it in a shell script so it can be repeated if necessary.

The "deplist" command to yum will list the dependencies for a
package.  Note that there are a lot of them for perl.  You'll
probably have to enable the Fedora repositories (fedora.repo,
fedora-updates.repo) so that yum will see the version of perl that
you want.  Then you should be able to do

  yum upgrade perl-5.12.3-143.fc14

That should pull in perl and all of its dependencies.  (I'm
still running F14; I have no idea if F15 has a later release of
perl.)

WARNING:  I THINK this will work, but I've never done it before.
I have no idea what other things might be pulled in if you do
this.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

Good Luck!

Subject: [PLUG] Spamcannibal MakeMaker mess...
Message-ID: <1312247285.2971.8.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

I installed perl-5.14.1 from source and followed a Redhat Enterprise
Linux how to upgrade to 5.10.0 to deduce what perl packages need to be
added manually.  None of the GD packages want to install, don't know
how important these are though.  I couldn't get the Glib or Gtk packages
to install either.  I had trouble as well with the IO::SSLeay package.
The real trouble though is with Spamcannibal.  Apparently, Michael
Robinton hacked MakeMaker, and it has since been updated.  I got a bunch
of warnings in CPAN.  Is there a way to back a package out in perl?  I
hate to start over entirely again.  At least I stored a list of what
packages I added to try to satisfy what the stock perl has.

True that perl is a dependency for many things, but Redhat is so slow to
upgrade perl and so many bugs are getting squashed that it is downright
scary to stick with the stock 5.8.8.

Back to MakeMaker, how do I safely use the older version temporarily to
get past the warnings?  Is there any chance that someone has a competing
package that does the same thing without ugly hacks?  How about a
commercial tarpit program?

If you were to take a gander at perl's changelog, you might notice that
redhat doesn't stick with the stock 5.8.8 either.  They cherry pick the
fixes, and particularly the security fixes, from the newer releases and
backport them into the version that they support.

http://www.kirsle.net/doc/perl510.html

I assume the GD, Glib, and Gtk2 rpms are only needed when X is installed.
I'm concerned about not being able to account for the secure socket  
layer stuff.
I've figured everything else out...

YAML
HTTP::Date
Compress::Raw::Zlib
Compress::Zlib
Test::Pod
Pod::Coverage
Crypt::PasswdMD5
Digest::HMAC
Digest::SHA1

Proc::PidUtil
Sys::Hostname::FQDN
Data::Password::Manager
File::SafeDO
Geo::IP::PurePerl
Net::DNSBL::MultiDaemon
ExtUtils::MakeMaker
Mail::SpamCannibal

If there is a semicolon before a line, that doesn't install successfully.
Whether or not everything that needs perl still works, this seems to  
be the case.  If there is any other install I should do via CPAN,  
please let me know.

I'm running perl-5.14.1 with threading enabled.

I'm wondering if I really need the IPv6 stuff as I don't have any IPv6  
connections?

No, you don't, if the Blu-Ray Disc is encrypted.

I respectfully disagree with you.  A judge would have to enforce your
interpretation which is ridiculous from the standpoint of fair use.  I
believe there are countries already that are refusing to prosecute
people who circumvent copy protection schemes to make legitimate
personal use copies.  Now then, if a vendor wants to offer me a digital
copy that I can download legally, that is a whole lot easier than trying
to overcome copy protection.

Subject: [PLUG] rsync help
Message-ID: <4E38230D.7040807@cyber-office.net>

I'm trying to come up with the correct command line parameters to do 
what should be (I think) a pretty simple rsync backup/copy to another 
directory.

The tricky parts seem to be how to preserve the "sub-"directory 
structure for each sub-directory.  Clear as mud ... right?

What I'm confined by is I'm backup up to a Windows server via ftp.  I've 
install curlftpfs and it is working fine.  Using cp kind of worked.

What I'm trying to back up is a bunch of varying files and directories 
from several directories.

Source files and directories look like this:

    /topdir/svr1/
    /topdir/srv2/
    /topdir/srv3/

And the file and directory names to be backedup/copied are in the files:

    /var/backup.d/{srv1.lst,svr2,srv3}.lst

The backup/copies) need to go to:

    /mnt/backup/{svr1,svr2,svr3}

preferably without the /topdir/.

I've tried several iterations using different naming conventions in the 
/var/backup.d/*.lst files and command line combinations with varying 
levels of success.

The last try was:

    srv1.lst contained (actual names and values obfuscated):

       /topdir/srv1/etc/passwd
       /topdir/svr1/var/www/

    rsync -azrR --include-from=/var/backup.d/svr1.lst /mnt/backup/svr1/

I'm just getting a list of existing files in /mnt/backup/ but no copy of 
the files.


Any suggestions about what else to try or where to look?


TIA,
Rod

My standard rsync incantation is:

rsync -rvca --delete-after --progress /source/dir/path /destination/dir/path

Other options (hostname, ssh, etc.) are used when appropriate.

Thanks.

I'll give that a try as I already have a script that iterates through 
the /var/backup.d/ files and then through the contents of the files.

Amazon appears to recycle user reviews for available materials so it is
nearly impossible to tell for sure if the reviews one is reading even

I can't really comment too much about local law, and I am not a
lawyer, but I can assure you that in Australia that interpretation is
backed by at least some court precedent.  Sad to say, these technical
measures *are* effective ways of preventing people doing legitimate
things with legitimate data they paid for.

The concrete case, not tried to the best of my knowledge, but there
have been a bunch of decisions both ways on what technical measures
can or can't enforce protection.  (...and we inherited your laws, as
part of a treaty, so they are the same rules.)

That's confusing two (more, actually) issues.
1. You do not have a universal right to copy somebody else's product.
2. By circumventing the encryption, you aren't even copying the
original product, you are substantially altering the product, against
the wishes of the person who owns copyright to the product.

It''s gone before judges in a few ways, with people being arrested,
and jailed, and released, (in the US) for simply providing decryption
capabilities and information. Fair use (in the legal sense) is *not*
part of the US law preventing the circumvention of encryption.

To repeat: If it's encrypted, fair use exceptions do not apply. Take
that in for a second.

It varies all over the place. The law is a mess. Nothing new there.

See, this is where your argument has problems. You did not pay for the
right to decrypt *and* copy the data for personal use. That's not a
legitimate use, nor is it protected.

That's what copy-right is, where all of this mess comes from... you do
*not* have a right to make unencrypted copies.

You can call it a "backup", if you leave it encrypted, bit for bit,
and get some legal cover,  but once you alter it, things get sketchy
really fast.

People rip Blu-Ray discs, encrypted or not, all the time.  In many
cases, they are putting the movies on a hard drive as that is more
convenient.  The hard disk is usually on a computer that is on a 
local area network.  This way, sneaker net is not necessary to be 
able to watch a movie in different places in your own home.  Sneaker 
net is undeniably legal, but it is inconvenient.

Now, this is not as bad as typically what happens with sheet music.
Typically, free copies are made of the sheet music and these copies are
given to the choir.  No royalty is typically paid for the copies.  Worse
yet, people who use sheet music often transpose it or otherwise modify
it.  Do these musicians have the right to do what they are doing?

According to the DMCA, you have the right to make media compatible with
different playback devices.  Maybe there's a problem with the law or
just an inconsistency.

If you have to decrypt a video to legitimately copy it for personal use,
where personal use is allowed, there is a problem.  It is preposterous
to encrypt Blu-Ray discs in the first place and protecting encryption by
abusing the copyright system is even more preposterous.  Most encryption
is easily overcome by serious pirates.  Putting people in jail for
defeating encryption schemes regardless of their reason for doing so and
their intentions afterwards seems ludicrous.  Encrypting videos is not
fair to the public.  If it was a military video, that might make sense.
I don't think however that the Book of Eli or Transformers needs to be
encrypted.  What happens to Linux if you have to have a proprietary
Windows based player to watch these movies?  Are we going to reach a
point where there is a charge per person to watch a Blu-Ray movie?
There should be more emphasis on catching the ring leaders of illegal
copy operations that turn out 1000's of copies and sell them.  Average
Joe who wants to play the Blu-Ray movie off of his hard drive running
Linux should be left alone.  The encryption does not add value to the
movie for the consumer and the bad guys aren't stopped by it.

If the law says that movies can be encrypted and that you have to leave
the encryption intact no matter what, the law is badly written.
Copyright was never supposed to trump fair use or reduce public benefit.
Copyright has seemingly grown into a monster over time, not a temporary
monopoly over a piece of original art that it was supposed to be.  The
idea behind the copyright is that people need to be able to profit from
their art where they supposedly need a temporary monopoly to do that.  I
am not advocating that people be allowed to copy videos they haven't
purchased.  I am not trying to say that you should be able to copy a
video and give your friend that copy.  I do think that you shouldn't
have to engage in sneakernet and you shouldn't have to worry that your
only copy will get scratched.  Plus, Blu-Ray collections that
are large become inconvenient and impractical if you don't copy the
movies to a single hard disk.

I found the Sybex CompTIA Linux+ complete to be a good inexpensive resource
(about $25.) The writing is concise and it covers a great deal of material.
However, the author assumes you have at least a basic knowledge of Linux
which may be a pro or a con.

Dear Jen, 

Nathan is correct. In addition to the IBM training materials, any book
that covers the LPIC-1 level certs should help you pass the two exams
associated with the Linux+ exam. 

(shameless self-promoting plug -- I've written one of those books,
http://www.amazon.com/LPIC-1-Depth-Michael-Jang/dp/1598639676 )

Just be aware, a good percentage of the exam questions are "fill in the
blank." In other words, you should be prepared to answer questions by
typing in the names of typical Linux commands and files, such as those
listed in the exam objectives. 

Thanks,
Mike

What makes talking about what people need to do to put videos on the
hard drive of their Linux media server off topic on a Linux list???

What makes talking about having access to media from Linux in general
off topic on a Linux mailing list???

This isn't off topic and it doesn't belong on that unfriendly rag called
plug-talk.

I have not contributed to this thread earlier because it isn't really of 
any interest to me, but your latest question is.
(a) the technical aspect of your quest is on topic (in my opinion)
(b) the legal aspect of your quest belongs, possibly on plug-talk, 
probably in a lawyer's office (again, in my opinion)
I should venture to suggest that few on this list are legal experts, and 
it would be inappropriate, possibly even deemed as entrapment, to 
solicit legal opinions on this list.  Possibly no legal professional 
would care to express an opinion here, on the matter, either.
While I may or may not sympathize with your predicament and your quest, 
that would be all that I would be interested in saying.

Where is the suggestion that I'm trying to legally entrap someone coming
from?  I'm neither a lawyer nor a judge and even if I was I'd have no
interest in entrapping people who in my opinion want to legitimately
adapt their video collections to work with Linux.  Why is everybody
running scared and crying that the sky is falling?  I see nothing
inherently wrong with trying to build a Linux based media center even if
I do intend to play the content of Blu-Ray discs off of a hard drive for
what should be obvious and reasonable reasons.  Maybe the law right now
is stupid and maybe the FBI warning on videos has gotten out of control.
If the law as it is is bad news and it isn't challenged aggressively, it
won't change.  If we don't speak up against imprisonment of people who
are not Blu-Ray pirates, will that stop either?  Are you telling me
quite honestly that there is a go ahead and break the encryption but
don't talk about it attitude?  Or worse is their a, yes we question the
use of encryption on Blu-Ray discs, but you shouldn't break the law
attitude?  Bad laws have to be broken, to not do so is to accept the
status quo and perpetuate a potentially major problem.  Maybe we should
be proud of people who have gone to prison for cracking Blu-Ray
encryption and telling their friends how to do it.  I
believe Finland is forward thinking in that people aren't thrown in
prison for defeating the encryption on a Blu-Ray disc that they have
purchased.  I realize that people don't want to go to prison, but
standing by and doing nothing, the situation will only get worse.

I have never advocated profiting from the decryption of DVDs/Blu_Rays.
All I ask is that fair use be restored, after all I'm talking about
people who have purchased the DVD/Blu-Ray disc they want to put on their
hard drive.  All I'm asking for is the right to play the movie I
purchased from a Linux based computer.

What is the real problem with copying anyways?  I can understand being
upset if guy a copies movie x and gives that copy to guy b who sells it
to people c-z.  Oops, the holder of the copyright lost on those sales.
But what I am talking about is what should be an easily prosecuted movie
copying operation.  If the major copy houses are prosecuted, that should
be enough for the authors to reasonably profit from their work.  Do
small time copying operations where the copies are used for personal
entertainment really pose a problem?  The common sense answer is no, but
I guess that common sense doesn't prevail this close to Redmond.
Frankly, the abuse of the MPAA and the RIAA are an embarrassment to me.
The greed of the MPAA and RIAA has to be reined in before the situation
becomes completely untenable.

I hope it doesn't take a revolution to end abuses perpetuated through
our horribly bastardized copyright law.

Subject: [PLUG] Solaris Mailing List Resources, Long Term Future, etc.
Message-ID: <1312429726.3375.1779.camel@Maui>

Folks,

I've been experimenting with Solaris 11 Express lately, and would
appreciate suggestions on mailing lists that anyone here has found
useful. 

If anyone has any thoughts about Solaris long term v. Linux, I'd also be
interested in that. Seems to me that Linux has some work to do to get to
Solaris levels in some areas like trusted extensions, self-healing,
etc. 

Five or ten years ago, I would have thought that Linux would have left
Solaris in the dust by now. And yet we're about to see a completely new
Solaris release (the speculation I've heard is "Solaris 11 by
11/11/11").

If people feel this is more appropriate for plug-talk, I'll willingly
move this discussion there.

Thanks,
Mike

Hello all. Please forgive me if this query is overly verbose.

I have a multiboot system that I built yesterday with the following
installed in this order:

Windows 7
Linux Swap partition
Ubuntu 10.10
Fedora 15
openSuse 11.4
Debian 6

Everything works fine except when I try to boot into Fedora or Debian I
get the following: error: invalid signature. When I hit any key I get
returned to the boot menu. I am a complete and utter noob when it comes
to grub so please pardon my ignorance. Any help would be greatly
appreciated.

In case it helps, here is the contents of /etc/grub.d/40_custom

--------------

#!/bin/sh
exec tail -n +3 $0
# This file provides an easy way to add custom menu entries.  Simply
type the
# menu entries you want to add after this comment.  Be careful not to
change
# the 'exec tail' line above.

menuentry "Fedora Loader" {

}

menuentry "openSuse Loader" {

}

menuentry "Debian Loader" {

Thanks in advance,

Carlos:
I know nothing about Java, but I just finished learning a bit about 
writing POSIX threads in a C program.

I wanted my threads to execute concurrently with the process that 
spawned them.

To make the CPU cores available for other threads and processes, I 
wanted my threads to terminate when their tasks were done but be 
recreated again (thousands of times) when needed.

If the Java threads interface that you will be using is POSIX compliant 
and if this is something like what you need to, I can show you what I 
did. I'll also be at the PLUG meeting tomorrow evening.

No idea. I stopped working on it about 5 years ago, as that was the
last time I saw it in the wild.

They have great toys.... but they are an Oracle property now. Which
usually means that you can buy the toys, if you are willing to spend
insane amounts of money.

The OpenSolaris forums/ML is still where a majority of the discussions
take place.
#solaris and #opensolaris on freenode as well.

I've taken a step back from Solaris, mainly because Oracle. But you
can't beat the stability and featureset of that 'old' OS.
We still use it at work, for some very important tasks, and Linux
won't likely take it's place any time soon.

Thanks for your reply. I probably won't be able to make the meeting because
I live in Pocatello. Otherwise I would be delighted to see your implementation.

My issue is not so much _how_ to spawn a thread. It's more a question of
_where_ to do it.

Thanks,

Carlos

googling "grub2 error invalid signature" produces a wealth of results - 
this one seems to have had a lot of success:

Subject: [PLUG] Upgrading PHP on CentOS 5.x
Message-ID: <4E3AF3E4.6050107@zenlinux.com>

Hi all,

I'm running a VPS with CentOS 5.6. It includes PHP v5.1.6.

I noticed recently in a WordPress install that PHP v5.2.4 or higher is 
now required starting with WP v3.2.1. So I need to upgrade my PHP before 
I can upgrade my WordPress installs.

My Google searches have found a lot of tutorials on how to rebuild 
custom PHP RPMs for CentOS 5.x, but I would imagine by now there is 
likely a canonical CentOS repo I can add to my config and just grab the 
binary package feed. Can anyone recommend one?

Thanks,

Scott

There is no need to change your config. The updates repository for
CentOS 5.6 has several packages named php53-*. A "yum search php53"
should give you a list of PHP 5.3 packages. These should count as 'or
higher'.

Subject: [PLUG] Why Laptop Cannot Find Wireless Networks
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1108041345530.29717@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   This happened in the past with both Toshiba and Sony notebooks, and today
with the Dell Latitude E4510 laptop: my wireless network sniffer shows a
strong signal (3-4 of 4 lights on) yet wicd-client cannot find a wireless
network for connection. This was at Providence Med. Center in NE Portland.

   What might cause wicd to not find a network when the signal strength is
strong?

   The hospital requires a password to use their system, but they provide
that and, of course, one must have a network connection in order to use the
password for access.

   Any ideas?

Latest network drivers for the Wi-Fi cards are loaded?

That or the hospital doesn't like Linux.  Were you able to test it out in
other areas as well?

   How can they tell the OS? The signal on the 3rd floor (day surgery waiting
room) was weak (1-2 flickering lights), so I went down to the lobby where I
got 4/4 strong lights on the wireless detector.

The hardware wifi might be off. I think that is Fn + F2 on the Dell Latitude

The lobby does have a stronger signal than surgery room.  Why you wouldn't
be able to connect would just be strange.

They can't tell the OS, I was being sarcastic...sorry.

Maybe there might be something wrong with your wifi-manager.
"wicd-client" is @ version 1.7.0 according to their website.  Do you have
the latest version.

According to this post, reinstalling the OS seems to have fixed it.
Not a lot of info, but it might lead us into the right direction.  I think
his version was 1.66.xx or something.

Have you tried opening a browser? Many times, you must accept their terms of service via a web browser before the connection is fully functional. I know St. Vincent is that way.

Bill,

   If it was off, would the indicator light be lit?

   This is my first portable with a built-in WiFi transceiver, but it's
worked in all other situations out of the office ... until this morning.

Russ,

   No, I didn't. I've done that in hotels where I cannot ssh to my office
network until I try to use firefox and go past their hotel page. But, in all
those situations wicd-client has seen the wireless networks and let me
connect to one of them. Today, no wireless networks were seen.

Rich,
    Just out of curiosity, what model wireless card do you have?  I've seen
similar issues with the broadcom card in my wife's laptop, but not with my
intel one.  It got to the point where I finally just bought an Intel card
for her laptop.  Now I'm just waiting for the weekend so I can install it
for her.  Experience has taught me that the chipset for 802.11 is absolutely
critical in getting good, stable performance on wifi under Linux.
                      -Mike

IIRC, there are a number of bugs related to wicd and hidden networks,
esp related to encryption. The following google seems to confirm:

wicd "hidden network"

Other question -- I know I see hidden networks with an empty SSID when I
run the following command in RHEL 6 and Ubuntu 10.04

iwlist wlan0 scan 

If that command reveals hidden networks, you probably can set up a
connection manually with some variation of iwconfig. (I know something
like the following works on a WEP network:)


Thanks,
Mike

   I looked with wicd for hidden networks, but it didn't find any.

   Considered doing that but decided to spend my waiting time extracting data
from a spreadsheet from the same client that provided me with other
horrendous data spreadsheets. I'm still plowing my way through one of 37
tabs that has about 100 columns to extract sets of related data to massage
into format for the database.

   A good thread topic for PLUG-TALK is why those in the Microsoft business
world try to use spreadsheets as databases. Well, the why is pretty obvious,
but retraining them is very difficult. IMO, spreadsheets should be
restricted to the financial people; everyone else learns how to use a
database system.

I second that notion.  I am working for a financial company and they use
spreadsheets for everything, including some database stuff.  It irritates
the crap out of me actually.  Thank you for noting that.

I've had issues with wicd. Yesterday on the plane, it took wicd 5 or 6 
tries to pick up the wireless network. When that happens I just keep 
trying until it decides to work. I contemplated sending something out to 
PLUG, but got distracted with other work. I'm on Ubuntu 10.04.

Hasn't happened enough yet for me to be mildly annoyed, so I haven't 
started debugging.

Subject: [PLUG] Fixing Borked Boot Process in Slackware
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1108050839310.7133@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I know there are a couple of more Slackware users here so I share what I
learned earlier this week about recovering from a borked kernel upgrade
using the Slackware distribution DVD (or CD).

   Before heading for a client meeting I ran slackpkg to upgrade all the
patched packages on my portable running Slackware64-13.37. The kernel
packages were upgraded, too, and (being in a hurry and distracted) I let the
pkgtools script upgrade the kernel packages. Needless to write, the system
would not boot during my meeting with my client. We were able to use his
copy of the report so that worked OK.

   What I learned to do to fix the problem via Slackware is to boot with the
installation DVD (in my case because it has both 32- and 64-bit versions on
the two sides) and log in as root. Once logged in I did

mkdir /foo
mount --bind /proc /foo/proc
mount --bind /sys /foo/sys
mount --bind /dev /foo/dev
mount /dev/sda2 /foo/boot (because my /boot partition is on sda2 and / is on
 				sda1)
chroot /foo

   Then, after cd'ing to /boot I saw the soft links for System.map, config,
and vmlinuz were incorrect and did not match /etc/lilo.conf so I rebuilt the
soft links, re-ran mkinitrd, and corrected /etc/lilo.conf with the proper
images and labels. Then I ran /sbin/lilo, rebooted, and all was well again.

   Whew! And no need for any knoppix or ubuntu rescue disk. Perhaps this
approach works for other distributions, too.

I'll let you know this week. I've got another flight on Sunday, so we'll 
see if I have to do a "try, try again" scenario.

I did look at dmesg when it wasn't connecting, but other than indicating 
that it was waiting on dhcp, there wasn't anything helpful. I almost 
wonder if it's a problem with dhcp.

If it happens again I'll try iwconfig to see if that works. From what i 
understand, wicd is juts a frontend to the binaries.

"Ok I finally solved it by switching from dhclient to dhcpcd"
from: http://wicd.net/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=733

Another topic in that blog that I found earlier.  This person reset their
DHClient to DHCPCD and that worked.  Not sure what you are using, but its a

   Well, I have a flight in a week, but it's in a small plane; no wireless
available. :-)

   I read somewhere that dhcp and/or dhcpcd might be at fault.

   That's my understanding, too, so the problem is probably in the underlying
tools. Which still begs the question why it works in most places but not
all.

My choice for DHCP client is set to automatic, , and the radio buttons 
don't give me any option other than dhclient, so maybe I need to apt-get 
dhcpcd.

I'll run some tests over the next week, as I'll be meandering through 
various airports and wireless networks.

Dear Rich, 

I wasn't completely clear -- I was suggesting a google search term, and
did not remember that wicd is its own command.

That "signal" could be another wifi client on a computer and not an Access
Point. It could be some other device in the same radio spectrum.

If your wireless network manager cannot see the RF signal from a wireless AP
and it's corresponding information necessary for a wifi client to connect to
it, ip connectivity is not the issue. You have to have radio (physical
layer) connectivity before you can get ip layer connectivity.

The only real test here is to use a low level wireless tool such as iw. If
when you run the command "iw wlan0 scan", you don't get results like below
there's a RF level communication problem between the radio in your wifi card
and the radio in the wireless AP.

It's because a spreadsheet is a nice general-purpose tool, and if you
have 20 things that you need as a "database" it's a lot easier to set up
on a spreadsheet that you know, rather than a database program that you
don't.

It comes under "Tim's Rule of Complex Solutions" -- any tool that is
good at dealing with a Really Complex Problem is going to have a huge
initial learning curve, which means that nobody who's an amateur at
solving that sort of problem is going to bother with learning the tool.
Instead, they'll use a tool that has a low step-up cost for the initial
problem, and then stick themselves (and the rest of the world) with the
really steep curve to add complexity to it.

Files vs. lathes, BASIC (or Java) vs. C or C++, shovels vs. bulldozers
-- whatever the problem, there's a quick & easy way to do a small job
that scales up really poorly, and an efficient way to do a huge job that
scales down really poorly.

Spreadsheet programs just exacerbate the problem in that while they're
really good for things that can be easily organized in tabular form, you
can wedge other problems into them if you hit them with a big enough
hammer, and 'everybody' knows how to use them.

use a spreadsheet or database". The 1st result had this to say...

As a general rule of thumb, databases should be used for data storage and
spreadsheets should be used to analyze data.

If you currently use a spreadsheet to store data, ask yourself the following
questions:

   - Do changes made in one spreadsheet force you to make changes in others?
   - Is the sheer amount of data unmanageable or becoming unmanageable?
   - Do you have several spreadsheets that contain related information (such
   as separate sheets with sales for branches in Los Angeles, Chicago, and
   Houston)?
   - Can you see all relevant data on one screen, or do you have to keep
   scrolling to find information?
   - Are several people accessing the data at the same time?
   - Do you have a difficult time viewing specific data sets that you want?

If you answered yes to at least two of the questions, you should think about
moving your information to a database application.

*In a Nutshell Use a database if...*

   - the information is a large amount that would become unmanageable in
   spreadsheet form and is related to a particular subject.
   - you want to maintain records for ongoing use.
   - the information is subject to many changes (change of address, pricing
   changes, etc.).
   - you want to generate reports based on the information.

*Use a spreadsheet if...*

   - you want to crunch numbers and perform automatic calculations.
   - you want to track a simple list of data.
   - you want to easily create charts and graphs of your data.
   - you want to create "What-if" scenarios.

In most cases, using the combination of a database to store your business
records and a spreadsheet to analyze selected information works best.

* Of course, this requires people to actually think about what they're
doing...

Subject: [PLUG] Building my own tarpit...
Message-ID: <20110805184916.cmd2ogqai8ocsw08@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Here is the scenario, spamcannibal is problematic and it doesn't look  
like the package is going to be fixed properly anytime soon.  I'm  
tired of fighting it.

How can I: safely get a copy of spam, parse the spam for the headers  
that are valid to find out where it really came from, and then build a  
DNS blacklist from that?

DNS blacklist built, how can I tarpit based off of the ip addresses  
that are blacklisted?  Tarpit meaning, you can connect to me but you  
get stuck at that step and are never able to send data.

Am I correct in thinking that I can install what is needed for the  
QUEUE iptables target without installing spamcannibal?

If there is a third party project that works when you have two null relays and
an internal mailhub, let me know.  This is almost what I have, except I don't
know how to masquerade properly so that Postfix can route out of either one of
my two inbound email gateways instead of going out directly.

Spamcannibal seems to assume one Internet connected mail server with no relays
feeding email to it indirectly.  It should be possible to split mail  
processing
and tarpitting, but good luck figuring that out with the instructions  
available.

I've backed out MailScanner and I've backed out SpamCannibal  
completely on all of my mail servers as well.  I even went so far as  
to bring stock CentOS 5 perl back on my mail hub.

I want to start out with something incredibly simple, I want to throw  
the smtp packets to user space and then throw them back.  Once I can  
do that, it will be easier to add to that the tarpitting feature.  I  
think if you don't acknowledge in 6 seconds or something like that  
that there is an auto resend.

For writing a tarpit daemon driven by a local DNS blacklist, do I need  
to use C or can I do this in some other language?  C and Perl I know,  
C better than Perl.

I'd like to work together with anyone who is interested in the result  
and having
an easier to install and easier to understand tarpit.

to a binary number so I can put the addresses in a binary tree.

I have extracted from an mbox file full of spam the originating IP address.

I need to convert these strings which are in decimal form to binary numbers.

What is the easiest way to do this in perl?

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1108071256300.17579@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have a 32G high-speed SD card for my Panasonic digitatl camcorder. I
just tried for the first time to transfer the SD card's contents to my
computer, but could not do so.

   /var/log/messages tells me it's seen as /dev/sdb, and in /etc/fstab that
device is mounted on /mnt/thumb. However, when I try to mount it the attempt
fails:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ mount /mnt/thumb 
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb,
        missing codepage or helper program, or other error
        In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
        dmesg | tail  or so

   dmesg does not add much insight:

   I understand that these cards need to be formatted by the camera. Have any
of you experienced users advice for me to resolve this issue?

Rich, You need to mount the partition instead of the device.  The partition
is listed in the line "sd 8:0:0:0: [sdb] Assuming drive cache: write through
sdb: *sdb1*"

Try this:
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/thumb

This assumes that /mnt/thumb is an existing directory.

Have you tried mounting the card as root?
I recall this as a problem I had in the past with an sd card.

Jason,

   It turns out that I mis-read /var/log/messages. /mnt/thumb is /dev/sdb and
/mnt/zip is /dev/sdb1. Sigh.

The function output_IP_list makes 5 picks and then picks the same IP

fix this?  I'm trying to list the IPs in order in a file so I can access them
from a C program that I will write later.  If there is a sort function  
in perl,
what is it, why does it work, and how do I use it?

The last_lowest is the last value written out to the file.
The tmp value is the current value plucked from the list.
My hope by going through all the values and picking every one that
is larger than the last smallest one, the next one will be grabbed.

By the way, I can't get Perl's sort function to do the right thing
exactly either.

  my @sorted_ips=sort {$a <=> $b} @ip_list;

This command sorts the first octet correctly, but not the second,  
third, or fourth octets.  The numbers are in binary format when sort  
is run on them.

I don't undersand the special syntax on the sort command, but I suspect that
I need something different there.

The beauty of the sort function, if it will work, is that I can  
replace an entire function that is fairly long in comparison.  This is  
why I'm using perl after all, it is supposed to be designed to do this  
sort of thing.

My perl script is fairly short right now, but it is long enough to be  
obnoxious.
I would have attached it instead, but I don't think attachments are allowed.

I want to give my solution, which this isn't yet, away.  To get  
tarpitting to work, everyone has to do it eventually.  I'm sitting on  
200-300 spams which seems to be limited only by my bandwidth at this  
point.  I don't like MailScanner and I've given up on SpamCannibal,  
good idea badly implemented.

Thank you for taking a look.

What I am reading (please correct me if I am wrong) ...
    if the temporary_value is greater than the last_lowest_value,
       then set the last_lowest_value to be equal to the temporary_value
What I am asking is, is that what you want?

So does this mean that everything is great?
Are you happy with /dev/sdb1 mounted on /mnt/zip?

For manual mounting of USB mass storage, as root I use:
mount -t   device_filesystem_type     /dev/device     
/path_to_some_node_on_the_file_system/    -owner-user-mask=xxxx
Example:
mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt/tmp/ -oumask=0000

To manually unmount the above:
umount /dev/sda1

You have said in several posts that you want to sort them in binary 
order.  I'm really not sure what that means, but I understand you to 
mean that you wish to use the integer representation for sorting 
your prefixes.

You could (as somebody had pointed out earlier) use the Net::IP 
module, which provides quite a few features.  If you want only 
sorted IPs, there are some venerable tools at your disposal.  I 
would suggest using the inet_aton call to turn the IP into a number.

  #! /usr/bin/perl
  #
  # -- sort IPs by integer representation
  
  use strict;
  use Socket;
  
  my @ips = readline(STDIN);  # -- slurp
  chomp(@ips);
  
  @ips =
    map { $_->[1] }                                 # -- get second list elem
    sort { $a->[0] <=> $b->[0] }                    # -- sort on first list elem
    map { [ unpack( "N", inet_aton( $_ ) ), $_ ] }  # -- make IP an integer
    @ips;
  
  print join("\n", at ips),"\n";
  
  # -- end of file

Above is a so-called Schwartzian transform on a small list of IPs 
(up to a few hundred thousand should be trivial.  I ran the above on 
a set of 15 million IPs I had sitting around which required about 
9GB of RAM to run.  The above snippet will not win any efficiency 
prizes, but it should accomplish what you want.

 : I don't undersand the special syntax on the sort command, but I

 : The beauty of the sort function, if it will work, is that I can 
 : replace an entire function that is fairly long in comparison.  
 : This is why I'm using perl after all, it is supposed to be

The usage of $a and $b in the sort function isn't intuitive--you 
could say it's almost weird, but it is pretty powerful.  If you 
haven't already, try 'perldoc -f sort'.  There are quite a few 
examples.

Wayne,

   Great? I don't know. It works.

> Are you happy with /dev/sdb1 mounted on /mnt/zip?

   Sure. There are two USB ports on the front of my server/workstation. One
sees devices as /dev/sdb, the other as /dev/sdb1. So I use existing mount
points (/mnt/zip, /mount/hd) that are otherwise not used when I need more
than /mnt/thumb. These mount points are assigned to devices in /etc/fstab.

   Yesterday I mis-read /var/log/messages. I should have looked more closely
before writing as it was all user error.

What is "binary format"

Show me what might be in $a and $b there, and what order you want them

I saw $a <=> $b described as magic on the web, I know nothing about it.

Binary format as in I went from a string to a binary number via:

Net::IP::ip_iptobin($ip_string,4);

Carlos,

   I had a Toshiba Libretto and a Portege 3025CT; both worked great with
linux. Installation was no problem and they were light, small, and useful.
My friend has a low-end Toshiba (I forget the model) and it's running
xubuntu.

HTH,

Rich

Message-ID: <1312929581.8957.4.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

There seems to be no overscan correction available.

I'm running the latest Catalyst driver:

ati-driver-installer-11-7-x86.x86_64.run

The driver works great on CentOS, must be the fact that the X
implementation is older.

The Hitachi Ultravision doesn't seem to have built in overscan
correction either.  I'm on a rear projection HDTV.  Anyone know
where overscan correction is buried in catalyst control panel?
Barring that, is there a way to fix this manually?

I'm running 1920x1080, there is overlap on the top and bottom and on the
sides.

The GT220 Nvidia card I was using is bad and needs to go back for
replacement.  I assume the screen should look decent at POST and that
junk suggests a damaged video card.

I believe I used the dahdi tools to configure the ports.  It seemed to work.

dahdi_cfg           dahdi_maint         dahdi_speed
dahdi_diag          dahdi_monitor       dahdi_test
dahdi_genconf       dahdi_registration  dahdi_tool
dahdi_hardware      dahdi_scan


So if you have a specific file you have questions about, let me know and
I'll send you a copy.

Oh, those are simple.  They're already just a series of bits. Sort them

my @sorted = sort @original_list;

Yes, awesome, done.

Okay, stage 1 completed.  For stage 2, I need to take an existing sorted
list of binary numbers, sort a new list of these numbers, and combine
the two in sorted order.  I think I'll use perl to maintain the IP list
and build a server to serve requests for these numbers from a C program.
First things first, how to sort into a preexisting sorted list new
numbers.  Can arrays be concatenated in perl?  If so, I'm thinking
concatenate the new list and the old one and do a sort on the result.

Subject: [PLUG] Recording with audacity
Message-ID: <20110811053347.GA12980@gate.kl-ic.com>

Rather than make a practice cassette for my next slide show,
I used Audacity to make a CD.  Much hair pulling and gnashing
of teeth.  Three versions of Audacity, two operating systems
on 3 laptops, different bugs on each, including:

1) Breaking the window manager on exit, requiring a ctrl-alt-bs
   on Ubuntu 10.4 (Audacity 1.3.12b)
2) Not picking up the audio input channel on my T60 (RHEL5 clone)
3) Not labelling tracks properly under the RHEL5 (Audacity 1.3.4b)
   version. 

And don't get me started on attempts to compile from source.

Is there a non-beta version of Audacity, or a beta version, that
is not too buggy? 

Or is there something better for simple recording from single
channel microphone to tracks on a CD?  I'm willing to record
the tracks (1 per slide, 69 for this 40 minute talk) separately,
as long as they play without gaps.

Has anyone gotten this to install?

Using install IPTables::IPv4::IPQueue in cpan, I get an error during the

I'm running the stock Perl 5.8.8 right now.  Using CPAN, I have
installed IPTables::IPv4, Net::EasyTCP, Test::Harness, and
ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

Note the above listing, I installed libnetfilter_queue-1.0.0 using
a /usr prefix and I have installed the two rpms.

I also installed iptables-devel via yum.

Seems I should have everything needed to install the mentioned CPAN
module, so what's missing?

Did you look at the 't/simple.t' test file for a test 3 (it's clearly
labelled)?  What the test is doing is verifying that you have a proc file at
'/proc/net/ip_queue' and that it can find a line that looks like the
following:
Peer PID          : 0

I'm guessing that you don't have the proc file it's looking for.  Try
loading the ip_queue kernel module:
$> modprobe ip_queue

Notice how pid is not capitalized in the regexp and there is no case
insensitivity flag?  Yup.

Perhaps PID used to be lowercase in an older kernel, no idea, but...

$> grep -r 'ip_queue' perlipq-1.25
perlipq-1.25/README: # modprobe ip_queue
perlipq-1.25/README:  any locally generated ICMP packets (e.g. ping) to the
ip_queue module for
perlipq-1.25/t/simple.t: $procfile = '/proc/net/ip_queue';

$> grep -r 'pid' perlipq-1.25
perlipq-1.25/t/simple.t: my ($q, $procfile, $procpid);
perlipq-1.25/t/simple.t: if (/^Peer pid\s+:\s+(\d+)/) {
perlipq-1.25/t/simple.t: $procpid = $1;
perlipq-1.25/t/simple.t: if (!$procpid) {
perlipq-1.25/t/simple.t: if ($procpid != $$) {


It appears the test is the only piece of code that is looking at the
/proc/net/ip_queue file or looking for "Peer pid". The real perl code is
using Perl-XS to access libipq and netfilter C libraries directly.  Looks
like a bad test.  Change the test to what it should be for now.  Consider
submitting a patch upstream or notifying the author.  Oh hey, what do you
know, someone already created the bug on CPAN...7 years ago:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=7953

Subject: [PLUG] Hmm, no IP address???
Message-ID: <1313063000.29857.33.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

I'm planning on using IPTables::IPv4::IPQueue where I need to know the
source IP address, a logical address, to know what to do.  What I think
I want to do is create two Perl programs that communicate via
Net::EasyTCP connections.  One program will get the spam source IP
addresses from the spam and answer yes/no to the do you have this IP
address from the other Perl program.  The other Perl program will handle
asking the question, queue up the email, and then if appropriate slow
the email down.  Basically, one Perl program is a very simplified name
server where the other Perl program is a tarpit driven by the
presence/absence of the connecting IP in the name server.

Looking over the CPAN site, it doesn't look like remote IP address is
something that is easily grabbed.  Is there a way when the packet is
queued to get the IP addresses?  The hardware MAC addresses are not what
I need.

For the tarpit program, I think the first step is queue the packets and
retrieve the remote IP address followed by reinjecting them.  Step 
2 is to ask the name server Perl program about the remote IP address.
Step 3 is to tarpit when appropriate.

I will undoubtedly need some more help, but I am starting to get a clear
picture of what these two Perl programs need to do.

As far as the broken test, why hasn't the author of
IPTables::IPv4::IPQueue fixed that?  I tried manually testing with a
manual fix, test 4 failed.  I figure that test 4 wasn't failing before,
so I force installed the package.

A Zoom digital recorder, pop the SD card out, use favored Linux tools
to process the audio tracks into whatever you need.  

You can borrow one of mine.

Maybe sox[1] ?  Works well but it's console-based with a lot of options;
takes a bit to master.  IIRC, Ubuntu comes with a simple simple sound
recorder.  You could use that for the individual tracks, then glue them
together with sox or some other CD mastering app that supports track gap
adjustment.

color me also interested.  while running 2 VM's on my eeepc is
possible and works tolerably once everything gets loaded, i'm looking
for something a little more pleasant than "tolerable" as my workload
continues to grow.  and someday i'm gonna want to run a third VM
simultaneously =)

How are you trying to get the signal into Audacity?  If you've got
PulseAudio running on your system, you're probably best using it
to feed your microphone signal into Audacity.  I don't have a mike
to experiment with, but I was able to record an FM radio stream
off of my music player program and play it back successfully.  But
for Audacity to see it to record, and to play it back, I had to
connect through Pulse.  Trying to bypass Pulse is probably going to
lead to trouble.

Someone else suggested Ardour, which should also work.  Ardour
looks lovely; unfortunately, I've had about as much luck with
Ardour as you have with Audacity.  Ardour depends on Jack, and
I've NEVER gotten Jack to work on any system.  (Hm, that didn't
come out quite the way I intended.  :-)  Oh well.)  By all
accounts, if you are looking for high-quality sound, using Jack is
the way to go.  PulseAudio is not meant for professional audio
work and Jack is.

The version of Audacity that I've got is 1.3.13beta, running on a
Fedora 14 box.

it's pretty and zippy, but it's 2 bigger" and $400 more than the 11"

It's a tough call: ultra thin and light, but no ports; or somewhat
beefier with ethernet, DVI, etc? This one is probably as small as it
gets while still having the full complement of connectors.

The Macbook Air does not come with a German keyboard option, so it's
off the table. the Samsung Series 9 does have this option, but I
actually have to buy it from Germany. I'll give my money to the
company that makes it the least PITA to get a German keyboard. Except
Sony. I hear nothing but bad things about their customer
support. Maybe Lenovo will prove itself in the internationalization
arena.

Subject: [PLUG] AMD Phenom II X6 1000T / motherbaord problems
Message-ID: <4E45A378.2010408@pacifier.com>

I can't get 32 bit Linux to boot a AMD Phenom II X6 1000T on a MSI 
890GXM-G65. I have tried Ubuntu 10.10, 10.04, OpenSuse 11.3, Slackware 
12.2, 13.37. OpenSuse 11.3 64 bit however, will boot.

I believe the motherboard is a fairly new revision as it has the AM3+ 
socket which is supposed to support the X8 bulldozer CPUs that are in 
the future. I am wondering if I can drop back to an older chipset such 
as the 880 and get 32 bit Linux to boot the X6? Anybody out there 
running Phenom II X6 with 32 bit Linux? If so, what motherboard?

Thanks,
Wayne

We are happy to help, but need more information...

How far in the boot process are you getting?  Is it just skipping the CD and
going straight to the HDD or is it coming up to the boot menu for the CD?
Any error codes/messages? Is this only with 32bit distros or have you only
tried 32bit versions?

Depends. If I attempt to boot from a known good hard disk, the boot 
loader indicates that it's Loading Linux, but when it attempts to boot 
the kernel, screens full of stuff like:
[0.394166]    [<c19da8f3>]    panic+0x5c/0x14d
[0.394207]    [<c104682c>]    do_exit+0x72c/0x730
[0.394247]    [<c19daa01>]    ? printk+0x1d/0x1f
......

If I attempt to install from CDROM to a hard disk, the installer message 
comes up, Welcome to Slackware bla bla, gives me options to pass extra 
parameters to the kernel and to select a kernel such as hugesmp.s
No matter which kernel I select, the loader will load the kernel, load 
initrd but as soon it attempts to boot the kernel, a few screenfulls of 
stuff scroll by ending with:
Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!

No, as I indicated below, OpenSuse 11.3 64 bit will live CD will will 
run and seems to run just fine. OpenSuse 11.3 32 bit will not 
successfully boot the kernel.

Are you successfully running a 32 bit Linux on a Phenom II X6?

I have successfully run 32 bit versions of Ubuntu on a Phenom II X4 (I no
longer have this machine so I cannot test on my end) I'll do a bit of

Subject: [PLUG] MPEG4 file editing...
Message-ID: <1313197136.6675.6.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

I'm looking at Arcsoft's package for doing this under Windows, but I
wonder if there is a decent open source free alternative?  I use
handbrake to go from DVD to MPEG4.  So far this works because the DVDs
aren't encrypted.  I want to do things like trim out commercials and
dead space from when I fell asleep and let the tape run out.  The
machine I'm using to record the DVD's has a 1 hour setting, a 2 hour 4
minutes setting, a 3 hour something setting, and I believe a 4 hour
setting.  Unfortunately, you can't look on the tape box, dial in the
time plus 4-5 minutes, and leave.  The machine should be modified, but
modifying it isn't trivial.

A unit with built-in Grex and/or a unit that doesn't recognize copy
protection codes would be great.

Thanks Jason. I took the MSI motherboard back and am going to try a ASUS 
with a 880 chip set rather than the 890. The power supply connections 
are different on the ASUS, so I'll have to pick up a power supply in the 
morning. I have some other work that I have to do tomorrow afternoon, 
but as soon as I try the ASUS, I'll let you know.

Message-ID: <CAA1xhfSqKWDnTk6ARm2hsqVybh2gJ5oOwoEsjd76Sd+zWdKcLw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey guys,

I had this idea for a silly little script that would parse through a simple
png or something similar and be able to read the color for each pixel.
Basically, what I want to do is translate each pixel of the image into an
ansi color code and a couple of spaces for the purpose of printing it out to
a terminal.  Are there any utilities or libraries you all know about that
might be able to do something like this?

Also, does anybody know how to enable ansi escape codes in utilities like
write or wall? I tried writing a script to echo the characters and just
catting the lines, but it just prints the literal characters...

Thanks! :D

Subject: [PLUG] Wireless broadband and Linux...
Message-ID: <1313221308.6675.31.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

Comcast is expensive.  I pay for my cable Internet every month and at
the end of the 1st year, even if I drop digital voice service, I'll
probably pay more.

Yeah Comcast is reasonably fast, no it is not cheap.  I don't like the
games Comcast plays with special offers where it's cheap in the
beginning and excruciatingly expensive 6 months to a year down the road.

At least the basic phone service is cheaper than CenturyLink basic line.
Forget the deluxe phone service.

So one question I'm asking is, what kind of backup broadband service do
I want, if any, in the future?  Another question I'm asking,
will that be wireless broadband?  I own my cable modem and was thinking,
I can disconnect and later reconnect service...  Trouble is, for how
long will the current Arris TM722G be the ideal cable modem to have?
I'm hovering just below $64/month right now and will be till Christmas
probably.

I really don't have any complaints about Comcast service overall, just
the price bothers me.

So I see that Sprint offers wireless broadband in the Portland/Scappoose
area and AT&T of course has some offerings as well.  There's Verizon,
but I think Verizon equals expensive.  Pay as you go could be
attractive, but I see ripoff big time.  For pay as you go to be
attractive, it has to be purchasable in one month increments and should
be preferably less than $60/month for a reasonable amount of time online
to unlimited time online.  Also mandatory, no contract and no automatic
re-enrollment.  If voice service can be thrown in with the wireless
broadband, great.

What I want to know is what works with Linux as far as wireless
broadband is concerned?  What doesn't work with Linux?  If I'm going
to be paying $60/month or more for broadband staying with Comcast,
can I get portable broadband for the same price or less?

SO far using google I'm haven't been impressed with what I've found out.

convert (from imagemagick) can do something like that.  I've forgotten
the actual incantation, but I've done it before.  The manpage or

aview, which uses aalib might be what you're looking for.  You need to
convert images to pnm first though.

KDENLIVE is about as powerful as Adobe Premeire Elemenst, and I am 
running it fine in Ubuntu I I.

It also opens Matroska (mkv) files witha simple drag-n-drop, which is 
awesome for extracting video clips from anime fansubs for use in making 
anime music videos (a hobby of mine.)

I use a Verizon Android as a backup to my DSL service.  You tether the
phone to the system via a USB cable and a tethering app and if you
have good 3G coverage, your in business. I have had to use this as a
backup about 3 times over the last year.

Okay, I checked out Clear which has a great 4G package, but
unfortunately it doesn't cover 97201 or 97056 yet.  I'm on the list
though for when it becomes available.  I hope that list grows enough to
convince Clear to expand to Portland and beyond.

I wish Comcast would reconsider their pricing policy.  Penalizing
customers for staying with you seems ludicrous.

Christmas is the magic date when I have to change.  Either I drop
Digital Voice service and continue with cable Internet or I do something
altogether different.

What does Android cost and who offers service for it?

I only know what one specific Verizon service costs.  The data service is
about a $30/month add on to regular voice service. Phone prices vary a lot
depending on contract lengths etc. Verizon recently started limiting the
amount of data that includes, so your cost might vary depending on how much
you data you transfer. They might also have a data only service which might
be more useful as a backup broadband system.

Android is a "smartphone" OS, based on Linux.
You can use an Android phone to tether with your computer, and share the
phone's 3G or 4G cellular data connection.
Service is provided by all the major cellular carriers, they all offer
Android devices.
Data rates vary, but all of them have started to implement data caps and
tiered access levels, except I believe Sprint, and they are likely to follow
suit before too long.

Since you want to connect to a computer, you probably want to investigate
which carrier supports 4G in your area.
Verizon is rapidly expanding its 4G LTE service, with Portland area
supposedly being "lit up" sometime this year.  Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile
have their versions of 4G as well, though I am not sure of their coverage
areas.

Each carrier also offers a standalone 3G or 4G data only modem, which would
be similar to the offering from Clear.
They have models that plug in to USB, I think some that plug in to ethernet,
and ones that offer up a WiFi signal and act as a 3G/4G to wifi bridge, a
cellular to Wifi access point.  The wifi model would probably offer the best
compatibility with Linux, since it just presents a standard 802.11g/n
signal.  The USB model would probably present compatibility issues, but some
of them may work with Linux.

If you only want the data connection, getting an Android phone would
probably not be the best option, since you would be paying for features you
wouldn't be using.
If you do want to look into a smartphone, which would be able to access the
internet itself, as well as share with a computer, there are a lot of
choices to be explored.
I would suggest looking at the Android lineup of your current cellular
carrier.

Verizon's LTE service has been available at the airport and Gresham area
for some time. About a month ago the rest of the city went LTE. The
theoretical bandwidth of Verizon's LTE is 52 Mbps, but in the real
world you will get 12-14 Mbps.

T-Mobile just enabled their HSPA+42 network in Portland, The
theoretical bandwidth is 42 Mbps, but the real world speed is expected
to be about a third of that. They have only one device which can use
the HSPA+42 network, a USB modem. I have no knowledge of whether the
modem will work with Linux, but Google might know something.

AT&T is attempting to go LTE, offering the same bandwidth as Verizon.
However, they are badly lagged compared to the other carriers. They
claim they need to buy T-Mobile in order to gain the spectrum
necessary to deploy LTE, yet leaked reports from inside AT&T indicate
otherwise. There is a great deal of controversy about the proposed AT&T
- T-Mobile merger.

Sprint offers WiMax, which cannot deliver the same speeds as the other
carriers. 

Having said all of that, all the carriers require an additional payment
for tethering a computer to a phone. However, it is hard for the
carrier to detect if you are tethering. A lot of people do it in
violation of their contract with the carrier. 

If you just want a connection for a computer I'd go with the T-Mobile
HSPA+42 modem, assuming it works with Linux. But bear in mind that the
Android world changes every 15 minutes.

Replacing the MSI890GXM-G65 motherboard with a Asus M5A88-V mother board 
solved the kernel booting problem. Don't know whether that particular 
motherboard had a problem or if this problem is typical of all 
MSI890GXM-G65 motherboards. I wanted to go with the AMD 890 chipset, but...

However, my older kernel (2.6.27.7) and drivers don't know how to handle 
the built in graphics nor LAN on the Asus, so I'll have to use a video 
card and network card until I install a newer kernel.

I am guessing that Asus has moved the logical location of the single IDE 
port as the 2.6.27.7 kernel and Slackware 12.2 installer can't find the 
CDROM when attempting to install. The BIOS of course can, and loads the 
installer, but the installer then can't find the CDROM drive. The 
solution was to use a SATA CDROM / DVD drive.

weren't looking for the big ticket name brand stuff with support contracts
etc.

You could also try some of the vendors that specialize in Linux, such as
Penguin Computing and others.
I used to work for an open source rackmount vendor down in California,
eRacks.com.  They ship nationwide, couldn't hurt to check them out.  I can
speak to their adherence to F/OSS philosophy.  They at least used to give a
discount to the local LUG, might be worth it to ask if they could extend the
same for other LUGs, or at least this one since I mentioned it ;).

Silicon Mechanics resells Supermicro stuff; they'll pre-load Linux for 
you. (I *always* re-install a server OS, but I like pre-installed 
Linux because it means that someone is making sure that the hardware 
is compatible with a mainstream Linux distro.) An interesting thing 
with this vendor is that you have to buy a spares kit if you get 
on-site warranty coverage. It add some expense, but I like having the 
spare parts right in the office.

Penguin sells nice gear; we have a lot of it at work. I don't like the 
lack of live configuration and pricing on the web site -- you have to 
request a quote -- but the gear is good.

I've had good luck with HP gear, but it's typically a bit more 
expensive than the other vendors.

pogolinux?

Last time I looked they were using Super Micro MB.  But most importantly 
they test everything before shipping it out.

Several years ago I ordered a rack mount but wanted a battery backed 
RAID controller that was a newer version than they offered off their web 
site.  They ordered, installed and tested it to make sure it worked with 
everything else including CentOS as the OS.

I know _absolutely nothing_ about these folks as a Server vendor: I've
bought exactly one PC from them (a laptop), it's been very good to me
for _years_, and the one time I had to talk to their support people they
were very responsive and polite.

But it's another name to toss in the hat:

I've not had too many problems with any of the major manufactures in the 12 years I've been doing linux system administration. I've run servers from Dell, HP, IBM, Supermicro and DEC.

I've run Redhat from RH 5.0 through RHEL 5. SuSE, Debian, Ubuntu, Yellowdog and derivitives. It's not that the drivers are hard to find. It's that you need to know where to look. For example. Dell put's their drivers for their hardware on their servers, and doesn't let many people mirror them. So you have to go to Dell to get them. The same with IBM. HP is a bit more open and has mirrors at some major institutions. DEC is now HP. Supermicro also has their own archive of drivers.

Message-ID: <4E499C34.50509@intel.com>

I haven't been able to get this one yet.

Challenge: A one-line statement (pipes okay, but explicit loops not) 
that empties all found files (as for debugging with /var/log, perse).

This is close, but has a loop:

     find -type f | while read file; do :>$file; done

This seems like it might work, but doesn't:

     find -type f -exec cat /dev/null \> {} \;

Any ideas?

Seems like a silly question as there's *no* way to technically avoid
loops (even if you're not doing it in your line, the underlying code
is using a loop), but I'd probably use xargs and truncate:

ls | xargs truncate --size=0

Use find instead of ls if you want something more fancy like
recursion. Might be pretty fun to do as root on / :-)

Technically true regarding loops, although I feel they cheapen the 
aesthetic appeal of the one-liner. :-) I hadn't encountered truncate, 
that works great!

Subject: [PLUG] Building an IP server in perl...
Message-ID: <1313450426.13236.19.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

So far, I have a perl script that pulls the originating IP from email
and another perl script that uses the file created by it to serve that
information.

Question is, should I implement an IP whitelist and if so, how do I do
partial pattern matches?  For example, 192.168. could represent
private class C subnets.  Another fragment that would likely be used
is 127.0.0., which represents loopback addresses.  I might want to add a
partial remote address for pdx.edu, 131 something.  I need to check the
IP's that are listed for partial matches and remove matches from the
list.  What I am envisioning, a spammer manages to forge an IP address I
have to accept email from causing me to lose legitimate email.  While
spam is not going to have an RFC1918 address in it, someone may put a
local message in their spam folder accidentally.  If the timing is
right, that message ends up in the spam account and could end up being
processed.  While this is only a problem if the IP server is probed by
an internal email server, having bad information in the IP server is
probably a bad idea.

All the server does is answer YES meaning that the IP is listed or NO
which means that it isn't listed.  I don't know how to encrypt data
transmissions that are established using Net::EasyTCP, another issue.
Logically, it should say NO if asked about a local address or an address
that should never be listed.

What is the likelihood of a spammer forging say pdx.edu or the google
address that hosts gmail?  Is this a problem I need to solve or not?

That one doesn't work on my end. It echos (literally) lines like

instead of executing the above in bash.

Doesn't that count as UUOT?  Why not use /dev/null?

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1108151959360.19565@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   My brain's stuck trying to figure out a way to automate removing
duplicate (and triplicate) rows from a database table that's been exported
as a .sql file.

   Here's the situation: The file has 12.5K rows of duplicate and triplicate
data. These data have the same loc_name, sample_date, and param columns, but
the quant column may differ, and there are other columns from the table that
are not applicable.

   I thought that I had a python solution but it's not working. There must be
an awk solution for this, but I've not yet found it. Of course, all of you
are welcome to submit solutions regardless of tool or language because I
don't want to spend my life going through all these rows by hand. Here are
samples:

\N	CIL	2007-08-29	Manganese	0.00499999989	mg/L	\N
\N	\N	\N
\N	CIL	2007-08-29	Manganese	0.00499999989	mg/L	\N

\N	\N
\N	CIL	2007-08-29	Nickel	0.140000001	mg/L	\N	\N
\N	\N

   Where values differ, we'll use the first one since there's no way to
determine which one is actually correct (if either). After all, there should
be only one value for a measured paramter at a specific location on a given
date.

TIA,

Rich

NealS,

   Thank you! I've been unaware of this tool despite years of using linux.

   This will work for all completely duplicated lines. I'll need to see how
many remain that vary in one or more columns ('fields') such as the
parameter, lab_id number, or qa_qc.

Much appreciated,

Rich

   I had manually cleaned up a bunch of lines so the souce file had 12,119
lines. AFter running uniq the output file has 8,605 lines, about 1/3 fewer.

   The need to remove almost duplicates/triplicates, based on the same values
in three columns regardless of the rest of the contents, remains.

If this a one off (once and done), one might consider a spreadsheet 
sorted on the three columns in question ... a little rough around the 
edges on the down and dirty side, but it should work.
If this is going to be ongoing, one might consider (G)AWK ... a glance 
at the "content" supplied suggest that the values might be delimited by 
either a tab or space, and that there may not be any spaces within a 
field?  Otherwise one might have to treat the data as fixed length 
records ... is that possible?
Hope this helps
Regards
Fred James

Can we see another snapshot of the data?  To see where the non-duplicate 
values are.  And (did I miss it?) which three columns.

Subject: [PLUG] Tarpit project...
Message-ID: <1313504507.19815.24.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

Well, I have user space queueing of SMTP packets working.  Found out 
my IP server had a bug, I wasn't saying NO when an IP wasn't found.
So far I have 83 IP's listed, but I'm still getting spam of course.
I don't seem to be getting quite as much spam though.  When a 
spammer gets past my partially open port, they don't always get all 
the way through fortunately.  So the amount of spam I get isn't 
directly correlated to the number of times that the spammer's IP 
address isn't listed yet.  It would be nice if I could use reliable
third party information about IP addresses I haven't seen before.
The biggest problem with the shut the door approach is knowing when 
to shut it.

I imagine Perl may have packages other than IPTables::IPv4::IPQueue 
that could be useful and potentially allow me to use remote DNS
blacklist information.  When the answer is NO from my IP server, I want
to do a DNS blacklist query to see if I should list the IP after all and
say YES of course.  In essence, this would facilitate closing the door
more often.

The goal was to implement a tarpit, I have a list driven port closer
instead.  There's no slowing down of connection requests, I simply don't
honor them sometimes.  Not quite what I'd like to be doing.

I wonder if it would be wise when the SMTP connection request packets
are queued to do an additional check if the IP is not listed?  I'm
thinking try to do a DNS lookup and if that fails, reject.  A 
legitimate email source has to have a valid PTR record, does 
it not?  Are there any other checks along these lines that I should be
thinking about?  Can Perl scripts do DNS queries?  How long do DNS
queries take?  Do they take too long?

A thought is to get help from a Perl guru to improve my three scripts
enough that other people will want to use them.  Once multiple sites are
using the system, maybe the IP lists can be shared somehow.  The only
way to stop spam is to block the connection requests from bot nets and
other spam sources.  I want to share my scripts as an alternative to
spamcannibal.  To be a good alternative though, I need a PHP interface
possibly and really I should probably be aging the entries in the IP
list.  Also, there is an argument to use encryption for the port
connections.  I use Net::EasyTCP to connect the IP server to what I
currently call the tarpit script.

Since I queue the whole entire TCP connection request packet, what else
can I pull out of it for informational purposes???

Rich--

I'm not certain from your email exactly which columns you want to
de-duplicate on, but the solution is to use sort:

	sort -u -k1,4 inputfile >inputfile.de-duped

The "-k" option should specify the range of columns you want to use
for de-duplication.  The "-u" tells sort to only output the lines that
are unique on those columns.  Of course your output will also end up
being re-sorted on those columns, so you may have to re-order it again
after you're finished de-duping.

Rod,

   Yep, and yep.

Data:

\N	CVS	1994-01-20	Conductance, Specific	460	uS/cm	t \N	\N	\N
\N	CVS	1994-01-20	Conductance, Specific	522	uS/cm	t \N	\N	\N

   (Fred: I think that pg_dump does use tabs as column separators, and there
are spaces within a column as the above demonstrates. These data were
extracted from Excel spreadsheets.)

   The three columns are the second, third, and fourth, named loc_name,
sample_date, and param.

   The current client staff can't figure out either how there could be two
different values for specific conductance at the same location on the same
date when both were supposedly checked for quality (the 't' in the seventh
column).

Hal,

   I've known of and used sort before but never fully read the man page to
see that it could be used this way.

   Row order doesn't matter because postgres does not use row order for
anything (although too may folks want to use the RID internal numer as a
primary key) and SQL does not return rows in any particular sequence without
the ORDER BY option.

Thanks,

Rich

   Wow! I have learned so much today about built-in tools that solve major
headaches in data cleaning.

   Running the results of uniq through sort (as above, but specifying -k2,4)
from 8605 rows to 5540. And this down from 12,500+ originally.

   My grateful thanks to all of you. Not only have I learned valuable uses of
common tools but you've saved me days of work.

I have no idea how to actually do it, but how is this as a strategy?
Add a unique column (record #)
Remove col. 2.
Remove duplicate entries in the result.
Note which records have been removed and remove them from the original.
Repeat for cols. 3 and 4.

as you know - prompted just by similar experiences as Brian has had, by us,
in the nineties:

- We always use commodity-standard parts, readily available form-factors,
etc - you should always be able to buy replacement and upgrade parts
anywhere convenient for you.

- No proprietary "custom" rails (which don't fit anything else), etc

- We never use proprietary hardware,

- Or other vendor-lock-in techniques such as those mentioned by Brian

- And especially such as using manufacturer's seconds and writing drivers to
get around the hardware problems (a long-time favorite technique of large
manufacturers such as Dell, Gateway, etc)

It has been a while since I was involved directly with rackmount kit, but I
seem to remember whitebox stuff such as SmithMicro worked well, if you
weren't looking for the big ticket name brand stuff with support contracts
etc.

You could also try some of the vendors that specialize in Linux, such as
Penguin Computing and others.
I used to work for an open source rackmount vendor down in California,
eRacks.com.  They ship nationwide, couldn't hurt to check them out.  I can
speak to their adherence to F/OSS philosophy.  They at least used to give a
discount to the local LUG, might be worth it to ask if they could extend the
same for other LUGs, or at least this one since I mentioned it ;).

Also, I've had good luck building my own. Cases from servercase.com, and then standard parts. 

Note: if you want to use standard cards in a case, get a 3U case and there's enough room. Smaller cases need a riser card, and then you'll be limited to 3 cards.

No, and no.  You should use an RBL focused DNS server instead, if you

You seem to be re-creating milter+honeypot. Not that doing so is a bad
thing, but pulling past code might give you some great ideas.

CPAN it when done. Maintain it for the rest of your life, and find
others to maintain it.

Dynamically, based on what traffic you don't like.

Depends on the source. A MX that hops IP's in a block can lead to an
easier IP range block. A "clean" block with a rogue MX is an often
annoyance where you accidentally "hosted" in a nest of spammers.

>?Is it enough to have a web page where blocked site admins

Hell no.

In rough (but maybe inaccurate) order:
2001: Automated requests for approval.
2002: "retype these letters to be approved"
2003: "type the letters in this image to be approved"

Server admins are very much exploitable by social engineering. Captcha
adds machine engineering, but it's still trivial.

That's whack-a-mole.

What I am about to say is *hugely* controversial.

Re-read the above, please.

With that being said: You should blacklist any ISP that allows spammers.

This *WILL* cause collateral damage.

> A curious question, shouldn't I be able to look up any IP that is
> claiming to be a mail server via the DNS system?

Yes and no. A huge amount of systems are not DNS-listed. *Any* server
connected to the internet should be allowed to send mail. You can
decline mail from non-DNS listed systems...... This *WILL* cause
collateral damage. This *WILL* cause collateral damage. (Did I
stutter?)

That being said, if you can handle it, go for it.

Question I have, why aren't these email sources reverse resolvable?

How on Earth am I supposed to detect that a mail host is a random
infected personal computer instead of some domain's legitimate email
server?

Should I go ahead and block if there's no reverse PTR record?

Short of saying there is a resolution problem and requiring that
another message be sent with a secret I provide for white listing
purposes, what can I do?

Since I have the email connection request packet in user space, can
I do something to the packet to cause Postfix later to bounce it?

I'm experimentally rejecting unlisted IP addresses that don't reverse
resolve.  Probably the wrong thing to do, but how bad is this?  I've
noted that a few important sites don't reverse resolve.  What percentage
of sites on the Internet don't have a reverse PTR record and why?  Is it
legitimate for their to be no reverse record when one site is hosted on
the IP block of another?

I'm looking to keep what I'm doing simple where I want to do something
with the DNS infrastructure to make my spam wall stronger.  One thought
is to have a white list of IP addresses in cases where there
is no reverse name resolution.  I simply have to check the white list
prior to rejecting an IP for not being reverse listed.  This approach is
a patching approach though and patches make things more complex.

Apparently I'm not supposed to reject email when there is no reverse PTR
record.  Can I have my Perl script add a line to the email headers that
says essentially, reverse resolution failed?  I'm using iptables QUEUE
on SMTP connection packets.  What I'm asking is, what is the extent of
what I have to work with?  If I have headers, how do I access them to
change them?  I know I can grab the destination and source IP addresses,
but do I have email headers yet?  Maybe I should just query a list of
IP's which don't reverse resolve that I should relay, a white list.

Is there a Perl module that will allow me to query DNS blacklist
servers?  If so, what is the module called and which DNS blacklist
server do I want to query?

In theory, yes. In practice, no. The only mail server records that have to be there are MX records, and those only say that the server there accepts email for the domain listed. A system administrator can set up any number of systems to send mail for their domain and doesn't have to list them at all in DNS. There are other mechanisms that are supposed to verify what servers send mail for a domain, such as SPF records. However, their implementation is spotty at best.

I think my Postfix implementation uses a third party SPF checking Perl
script already where I question whether SPF checks are simple enough to
do for a should we close the door or not script.  Remember, I'm a Perl
novice where one of my goals is to write something that a fellow Perl
novice would pick up.

To improve my script, I've written a second function and I've moved the
Net::DNS stuff to it.  I have the standard is the IP listed check and
I've added a call to my function when the answer is NO.  I try a
PTR record check on the IP where failing that, the DNS test passes.  
On success, I take the host name answer and do an A record query.  
If the IP I started with for the PTR query shows up when the A 
query is done, there is a match.  If no match and a PTR record exists,
this test fails.

I noticed doing DNS checking that the PTR record is sometimes absurd.
The worst I have seen is localhost.  Is it sensible to reject based on
there being an absurd PTR record?

There is more than just SPF checking, there are encrypted signatures
where you use public key cryptography...  This is beyond simple, but
is there anything I can use???  If I can provide an English explanation
that a novice would be able to follow, I think I can bend the simple
rule a bit.

My other thought is, there has to be an MX record to tell you where to
reply to.  Okay, can I use that information somehow in deciding whether
or not to close the door?  In other words, is it more informative to
look at MX records than PTR records?

"rm *".

Hmm, people are being kinda quiet...

There is code at the beginning of this thread, but trust me when I say
there isn't a lot of code.

Well, the DNS checking is increasing my rejection rate.  Figuring out if
I'm blocking at the right times is another issue.  Is there ever a
situation where a PTR record that doesn't resolve back to the IP you
started with is legitimate?  For example, one popular PTR record is
localhost which obviously will not resolve to a remote IP address.

Well, to meet the problem at hand in /var/log: various log utilities 
expect the existence of files, or will complain. So, the best solution 
I've come up with (using Sam Hart's truncate suggestion) is:

    find . -type f -exec truncate -s 0 {} \;

rm * might otherwise work well in most settings, but probably doesn't 
meet the spec of the original one-liner problem statement. :-)

Find is overkill if you're not descending directories.

Then why did you asy "a directory"?  The subject line already says it.

Please be more precise.  A directory tree is *not* a directory.

Oh, hey, look, this technique already has a geeky name:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_Confirmed_reverse_DNS

That being said:
1) People working with nested hosting companies have lots of pain when
trying to get proper PTR chain set up.... here's the crux of the
problem, as it usually works out: Mega-hosting company A takes a hunk
of "class C" (yes, traditional classes don't really exist anymore, but
this is an incredibly relevant concept in this context, for a legacy
reason I am about to explain) and re-sells the block. Lets say
192.168.1-5.0-255 is what the parent company starts with, which is
supposed to be in the bind zone files for
0-255.1-5.168.192.in-addr.arpa.

In case the problem isn't immediately apparent, the parent company has
responsibility for delegating the following zones (DNS is right-to
left) to the reseller:
1.168.192.in-addr.arpa.
2.168.192.in-addr.arpa.
3.168.192.in-addr.arpa.
4.168.192.in-addr.arpa.
5.168.192.in-addr.arpa.

The DNS boundary winds up being at the quad, *regardless* of CIDR...
reverse DNS still thinks in terms of dotted quad boundaries.

Sub-company B then buys and resells a block of, oh, 128 IP addresses
to another sub-company "C", from the parent. Lets' say it's
0-128.3.168.192.in-addr.arpa. Of course, since the whole block wasn't
resold, the place to manage this is still one level up, at
3.168.192.in-addr.arpa. (Again, DNS delegates at "." boundaries,
business agreements be damned). Company D buys half of those, and then
they then resell it *again*, to end client E, who just needs six IP's
for their servers.

A->B->C->D->E is how the sales chain works. However, in order to
divide on the dotted quads, for E getting a proper PTR record, they
("E") have to somehow get the message all the way up to company B,
which is the company that actually manages PTR records for the whole
3.168.192.in-addr.arpa. zone. This can take weeks, and lots of
communication. (I've done it more than a few times, and it's lame,
*especially* if you have to juggle lots of server names changing).

It gets even messier when you start with something as divided as
10.0-16.0-16.0-16.0-16, as *each* and *every* boundary must do proper
delegation on the dotted quad, or have huge DNS zone files.

2) You're checking A records. What about AAAA? Is this an IPv4-only solution?

3) Corner cases to ponder (since I'm not sure all of these will pass
at a light glance over the code, these may be already thought of):
...a). A server with 4 NIC's, hosting many virtual/VPS/whatever
domains. The domain emails may claim to be  coming from "example.com",
but the IP may be 3.3.168.192.in-addr.arpa, which resolves to
"eth3-bulkhosting.ourserverskickass.com".
...b)  inbound.example.com vs. outbound.example.com resolving to the
same, or different, host email IP....
...c) Geo-location IP makes a mess of everything that makes
assumptions about a fixed IP.

Getting back to your original question:
"Is there ever a situation where a PTR record that doesn't resolve
back to the IP you started with is legitimate?"

PTR's are not based on IP. They're based on DNS databases. Which are
often made and controlled by humans. That makes them error-prone. It's
worth "weighting" an email as spam, or not, but there's lots of messy
side-issues.... "localhost" is one part (as you have discovered), but
we're a long way away from one server=one IP.

Yup.

Maybe while you're waiting, you can research the existing solutions.

If you're *not* on Google-plus, send me your "@gmail.com" address, and
I'll send you an invite.  But I repeat, IT MUST BE A "@gmail.com"
ADDRESS.  Google apps don't count.  Non-google doesn't count.
Let me say again, IT HAS TO BE A "@gmail.com" ADDRESS. OK?

If you want a G+ invite and don't have a @gmail.com email me and I'll 
send you an invite.  You can then let Google try to get you to get one
of their addrs.

In as far as I can tell, Randal doesn't like GNU because it breaks 
interoperability with UNIX/POSIX, e.g. GNU Make vs. BSD Make? Seems a 
silly flame war to me, but my +1 for GNU are several fold: (1) 
GPL/copy-left; (2) larger % of user installations make GNU the defacto 
standard; (3) personal preference for GNU enhancements (viz: BSD Make suxz.)

I'd actually argue that there are far more non-Linux Unix installations
in commercial space than Linux installations.  Maybe more hobbyist Linux
installs.

This is an interesting proposition - I'm not immediately able to Google 
any good data to support either side. Essentially, the task is to 
compare num_deployments(Android & Linux traditional + all embedded 
systems) to num_deployments(Sun, BSD, IBM solutions, Mac OSX, Apple 
iOS). If those are how one chooses to break down the groupings, than I 
do agree with you, and retract my comment (2).

But the winds of change are blowing.? At the Fortune
500 place where I work the mid-tier mandate is to move off of Solaris, HPUX
and AIX to Linux.??? Only if the hosted application doesn't
support Linux as a host do we keep the legacies.

About the only way I could think of that pencilling out would be if you
counted personal iPhones and Macs, and not Linux VMs.

And even then, it's about even-steven at $JOB (ad agency with lots of
Mac-loving "creatives".)

We dumped the Solaris boxen years ago.  Linux tends to run on lots of
little devices, while HPUX and AIX usually goes on the Big Enterprise Host.

(Won't go into $JOB[-1] where Linuxboxen outnumbered coworkers by an order
of magnitude or so.  Heaven.)

But that's just my experience,
  Aaron

If you are talking about spamcannibal and MailScanner, I have tried
them.  MailScanner I don't like because of the strange way it hooks
into postfix and there are a lot of steps to set it up.  
Spamcannibal is too confusing where I never have been able to get 
it working.  I have done research, email is not the easiest thing
to research.

Just out of curiosity, have you looked at using any of the dns blacklists offered by sorbs or spamhaus? They're really easy to implement, anddo exactly what it seems like you're trying to do. These are my only spam protections built into my postfix +dovecot setup, and they work great.

With all great respect to Randall, I have to agree with you about this.

Maybe - just maybe - if we include all iPhones, iPads and Macs as
Unix, add in all the retail chain stores running SCO Unix, and even
throw in all the consumer electronics devices running a cut-down
variant of BSD, you might be able to count up enough Unix boxes to
match the number of Linux boxes, under some interpretation of
'commercial space'. (But lots of set-top boxes and the like run Linux,
so they go in that other list. And Android smartphones are selling
like hotcakes, will crush iPhones.)

And then there's Google - it alone puts 10,000 or more Linux servers
in each of its large datacenters, and it has seven of those at the
moment, not counting its smaller, rented facilities. And Amazon,
Rackspace and a huge raft of other hosting vendors, all with a few
Linux boxes at the smallest ones up to hundreds or even thousands at
the really large ones.

There is also the financial industry. It was among the first to pick
up Linux, and for years it did not talk about it because Wall Street
firms regarded it as a competitive advantage. But the trading floors,
and hot high-frequency trading operations, and huge number-crunching
analytical backends mostly run... Linux. There are still a few
mainframes involved for high reliability, and also some Unix systems,
but - though I cannot prove this - I'll bet that the majority of
financial systems run Linux, even those that run on IBM mainframes
under VM. Yes, most core banking systems still run on IBM mainframes,
but we're comparing Linux vs Unix, and those core banking transaction
systems are relatively few in number.

Oh, and supercomputers too. The vast majority of those are using
Linux, as we see at the Top 500 list -
http://top500.org/stats/list/37/osfam - plus most of those, over 80
percent, have between 4k and 16k processors.

CERN and its worldwide network of university partners run mostly
Linux, and even the US military is moving to Linux. It no doubt still
has some Solaris, AIX and HPUX servers in its myriad commands and
organizations, but each of those big Unix boxes is surrounded by
dozens to hundreds of workstations and PCs that are running either
Linux or Microsoft Windows.

We all know Windows doesn't count, anymore. It's the stupid consumer OS.

Linus Torvalds was not kidding about world domination. Sharing is grace.

Message-ID: <20110820210337.1ce0bec1@mailhost.pdx.edu>

There have been references here, but I guess one ought to make an
official announcement.

The fabulous PLUG Clinic will be held tomorrow, Sunday August 21, 2011,
from 1 - 5 pm at Free Geek, 1741 SE 10th Avenue in Portland.

Bring your problems and we'll fix them! Bring your computer with a
horrible operating system and we'll help you install Linux.

We have monitors, mice and keyboards, so generally all you need to
bring is the box. We also have cold punch (sugared and non-) and
munchables. 

If you're able to help others, you're welcome too! The Clinic is an
excellent place to learn how to do Linux tech support.

Subject: [PLUG] Hiss in mpeg4 file...
Message-ID: <1313916477.22287.57.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

I ripped a DVD using HandBrake on my Fedora 15 system.  The video
quality is okay, but the audio has a hiss in it that makes the sound
hard to hear.  I think this can be traced back to the VHS tape that I
copied to the DVD.  The tape itself has a hiss.

What is the best way to remove odd noises from an mpeg4 file?

Before anyone goes all self righteous on me and says, "you shouldn't
copy that tape," please note that I am a legal owner of it and the copy
is for personal viewing on a personal television set.  All I'm trying to
do is eliminate the need for a VCR.  VCR machines are getting harder to
find, the one I have will wear out soon, tapes take up a lot of space,
and DVDs work with portable DVD players whereas tapes don't.  On the
space issue, I can't throw the tapes away as they are proof of
ownership, but I don't have to store them next to the television 
if they are ripped to a hard drive.

On the subject of copying, the digital millennium copyright act is
supposed to allow copying in cases where you can no longer work with the
media because the equipment needed for it is going away.  VHS tape to
DVD for example.  Lately, seems there may be some confusion because some
bad laws have passed.  I am not trying to profit from the copying of
copyrighted video tapes that have been legitimately purchased over the
years.  If there was a legitimate service to get these VHS tapes
converted to a usable format, I would consider it.  Some movies won't
copy, Willy Wonka's 25th Anniversary VHS tapes for example.  I have a
Grex, but the copy protection in Willy Wonka and a few other videos
isn't defeated by it.  Five to eight minutes into the movie, recording
stops automatically.

I'd like to see people copy movies themselves.  Get a Grex and start
copying copyrighted material you have purchased for non profit purposes.
I think most judges are reasonable enough to accept that as legitimate.
If people become scared and don't copy copyrighted material when it is
reasonable to do so, the chances of this being allowed in the future are
bleak.  Think about this for a second, only when people copy and sell a
production is it really damaging to the owners.  You have to both copy
and sell/give away the copy to really hurt the profitability of
copyrighted material.  Copying material can actually boost profitability
if people who don't like their copy purchase another copy from the
copyright holders.  Besides this, some old movies have been shown on
television and copyrighted or not, you can argue that you have a right
to copy them when they air.  I believe the courts have defended
recording live television in the past.  This recording of broadcast
programs could become impossible in an era when most people have cable
and the cable companies are starting to encrypt programs.  Recording the
football game for example so you can watch it later may become
impossible.

If you like the prospect of not being to copy a copyrighted video ever,
don't ever copy one.  If you care about reasonable copying though, some
civil disobedience is appropriate.  It isn't possible to arrest
everyone.

   THis morning I discovered that my Acer monitor expired over night. No
power. Fortunately, I just bought a backup monitor (Hanns-G, whatever that
is) so I swaped them. After futzing with the color, brightness, and contrast
controls the new monitor is sorta' acceptable. But, ... with firefox at
certain locations on the application window the cursor vibrates, the status
line flickers between 'done' and the URL, and this is seen on the history
sidebar, too.

   Has anyone an idea what might be the cause of this? And, can it be cured?
I've not seen such behavior on an LCD monitor and it's quite annoying.

   I suppose I should get a higher quality monitor and relegate this one to
standby status again.

   Strange. The problem has gone away. Perhaps the new monitor had to burn
off the flakiness. After being on a half-hour or so now, it's stabilized.

I just used xmodmap to remap a key. It works great in X. But not in the VGA

no avail. Is this the right place, but maybe I just wasn't doing it right?
Is there a tool similar to xev that works in non-X shells? Are the kexcodes

Greetings,

 : I just used xmodmap to remap a key. It works great in X. But not 
 : in the VGA console.

That is true.  X and the console use two different mechanism for 
remapping keys.  It can be wonderfully annoying if you find yourself 
switching layouts from the default.

 : I tried editing the file in /usr/share/keymaps (Gentoo system) to

 : it right?

I suspect that /usr/share/keymaps on your Gentoo system is the 
location of the console keymap files read by the loadkeys utility 
('man 1 loadkeys').  You can switch layouts using loadkeys.  I use 
the dvorak layout and switch this way:

  zcat /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/dvorak/dvorak.map.gz | loadkeys -

 : Is there a tool similar to xev that works in non-X shells? Are 
 : the kexcodes identical in X and non-X environments?

I do not think that they keycodes are identical; in fact, they seem 
to be two very different worlds.  Also, I have never found something 
similar to 'xev', which I admit is remarkably convenient when you 
find yourself messing with this sort of remapping.

Good luck,

-Martin

Carlos,

   Two different animals.

   For your consoles put this at the end of ~/.bash_profile:

loadkeys ~/.keymap

   And, in my case, ~/,keymap contains

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ less .keymap 
# Created 12 July 2002 by Rich Shepard
#
# Exchange the left Control key and the Caps Lock key on the keyboard
keymaps 0-2,4-6,8-9,12
keycode 58 = Control
keycode 29 = Caps_Lock

Thanks, very helpful. The keycodes do not match between X and non-X. I found
that my key mapping did work, but affected the wrong key. It's down to
figuring out the keymaps in VGA mode. I'll look at the kernel source. I
remembering seeing a header file with a keymap in there somewhere.

Here's how I got 'er done:

I went the directory /usr/share/keymaps/i386/qwertz/ and made a file
de-latin1-nodeadkeys-101key-custom.map.gz. Its contents:

include "de-latin1-nodeadkeys.map"
keycode  13 = less greater bar brokenbar

This is the key that has = and + on it (in the us layout). In X, the keycode
is 21.

2 line fix! And it won't get overwritten at the next sys-apps/kbd upgrade.

Larry,

   Yes. That's been adequate for years so that's what I continue to use.

   Trying to adjust the color is a major PITA, though. Everything is a bit
too blue (or grey), but when I try to use 'user' color moving from R to G to
B doesn't want to follow the button illustrations in the quick start guide.
Having language-neutral pictures sometimes fails to clearly communicate.
I'll see if the colors adjust after a day or so.

   I bought this one from Newegg and ENU carries this brand, too. Never heard
of Hanns-G before.

Thanks,

Rich

I've heard of a similar sounding outfit, Hansgrohe. But if it was them, 
you're connections would be made with pipe and while you'd have 
something that involves liquid, it wouldn't be liquid crystals. ;-)

   But, the cable worked just fine through yesterday on the deceased monitor.
Regardless, I can swap it out.

If your machine has a DVI output, I'd recommend switching to that. 
When you use VGA with an LCD, you're adding two extra stages of signal 
processing that is unnecessary.  With VGA, your video card converts 
pixels into three analog outputs, and the display turns right around 
and converts the analog signals back to pixels.  A DVI connection 
sends pixels straight to the display.

   Thank you, Galen. I believe there is DVI output. Is there anything in
/proc or dmsg that will confirm that?

   I'll buy a DVI cable at ENU and reconnect the monitor.

   Late yesterday afternoon it came up with a new annoyance. When I log in I
see a blank screen, apparently because the text that is normally displayed
on the console is off the top. Feh!

   The User Guide for the Asus M4A78LT-M LE system board notes it has DVI-D
output.

While there might be some way via the filesystem or commands to 
determine whether your video controller has a DVI output, I wouldn't 
necessarily trust it.  While unlikely today, a manufacturer could 
choose to not install the physical connector.  Anyway, I would just 
look for a DVI connector on the back of your system.

BTW, I would expect a 6 ft DVI cable to cost less than $10.

   Asus makes good boards for the AMD processors and the connector is there,
next to the VGA one.

   ENU may be a bit more, but they're local. I'll also ask them to show me
how the adjustment buttons work on the monitor since they're not cooperating
with my attempts.

I have both DVI and VGA outputs on a video card. When I blissfully 
switched to a DVI cable on my Hanns-G flat panel, the sharpness of the 
screen was noticeably reduced. I was told that there was a 6 bit DVI 
cable and a later 8 bit DVI cable and that I probably had the 6 bit 
cable. Doing a quick search on DVI cables I discover that there are at 
least DVI-D Single link and dual link; DVI-A; and DVI-I Single Link and 
Dual Link cable types.

Wayne,

   A lot of flavors and I don't know which I need. PCH Cables shows a bunch
but doesn't describe where each is appropriate. Since I bought the system
board at ENU, and they carry this monitor I'll ask them. They've not steered
me wrong.

   I've not before had to futz with anything other than brightness and
contrast on a monitor. But, when I cut the brightness and/or contrast the
whites take on a gray or blue tinge. I'm not a color guru but I know what
various applications (LyX, Firefox, alpine, etc.) looked like before so I
see the differences.

   Supposedly this a good monitor brand. When I learn to get the colors,
brightness, and contrast "right" I'm sure it will work well. I'll still need
another monitor so I'll look for a different brand. The Acer was nice and I
have no idea why it just expired like it did. Oh, well.

Thanks,

Rich

Rich,
 A couple of quick questions about your Acer monitor..
 * You said that it just wouldn't turn on... does this mean that the power
indicator light did not come on or there was no display?
 * Were there any symptoms prior to it dieing?

It is unusual for a monitor to just up and die with no warning.  It is
possible that it can be repaired quickly and cheaply (possible that it is a
power supply or even just a fuse).
On the 29th at 7PM is the next DorkbotPDX meeting at Backspace in portland.
If you let me know you are coming, I am sure myself or a dozen or so others,
would be willing to troubleshoot/repair it for you.
If you cannot make it to the Dorkbot meeting, contact me off list and I'll
arrange to take a look at it when I can.

Jason

Subject: [PLUG] Linuxfest Northwest / LUG list
Message-ID: <CA+PcUTN2vh_9knWnAx5b95fVHW+ok7NxnJqjP_ism_DNcjsPkQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,
  I am trying to help compile a list of LUGs in the Pacific Northwest.  The
list will be used to help promote the annual Linuxfest NorthWest held each
April in Bellingham, WA.

If anyone knows of other LUGs around and has any contact info for them, I
would appreciate it if you would either respond to this mail or update the
spreadsheet<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?pli=1&key=0AtmurxwGf0K2dHo5eGxOeXRTWHhJYjJBZWtEVTZFZmc#gid=0>
.

I am also trying to get a feel for any interest in having a bus from
Portland/Corvallis area to the Linuxfest. How many would be interested if it
were free and how many if it were ~$100 round trip.  I am not asking for a
commitment, just to get an idea to see if it is worth pursuing.

Thanks for any input,
 Jason

I would be interested in the bus, even if it were $100. Free is way better,
of course.

You probably want a DVI-D Male to DVI-D Male Cable.  I believe that's 
the one that is most commonly used to connect a PC to a monitor.

The 6/8 bit stuff sounds bogus to me.  There are specs for what is 
called single and dual link cables.  A dual link cable is needed for 
high resolutions at high refresh rates(1,920 ? 1,080 @ 85 Hz, for 
example) or for high pixel depths(>24 bpp).  In most instances dual 
link is not needed, but I suspect that you would find that most cables 
are DVI-D dual link anyway.

My best guess as to your sharpness issue is either a poor quality 
cable or the LCD not being driven at its native resolution.

   When I sat down at my desk yesterday morning the monitor was dark and the
power light was off. Because this system stays on 24/7/365 (and the monitor
blanks after 10 minutes of inactivity), I thought there was a power failure
but the system was up and running.

   Nope. It worked fine Saturday.

Jason,

   I should be able to make it. But, with three large projects (and all
clients wanting my full attention to their needs), the situation may change
in a week. But, if it can be fixed that would be great.

Thanks,

Agreed, and I'd lay my money on the latter.

Thirded.

Switching from an analog VGA cable to a DVI-D cable should be a HUGE
improvement in clarity if you're using the native monitor resolution.
And no more annoying centering issues either. Ever. Once you go DVI
you'll never go back (if at all possible).

Rah rah, sis boom bah, gooooooooooooo DVI!  :)

Not really a cheerleader,

Rich,
No problem if you don't make it. You can either contact me or wait for the
next meeting (held every 2 weeks) to take a look at the monitor.
If you can give me the model number of the monitor and/or the voltage and
current rating of the power supply, I'll see if I have one for testing as I
am betting that is where the problem lies.

Jason

   Well, my friend has managed to yank xfce4's undies into a wedgie. No
window manager running so there's only one frameless window and the settings
manager will not let me invoke xfwm4. There's more that's torqued, too. So,
despite my using xfce for years how to fix this has so far escaped my
efforts and I'll get on the xfce mail list for help with that.

   Back to the distribution upgrade. It keeps telling me that 10.04 is up to
date but I cannot find a menu option to upgrade the distribution. I've a
vague recollection that the command line (when I can actually type something
in the frameless v.t.) is 'apt-get upgrade distribution.' I'm not a ubuntu
user so I don't know if that's the preferred approach. I'm hoping that those
of you who run various flavors of ubuntu will point me in the proper
direction.

TIA,

Rich

Jason,

   Thanks. I'll save this for the next time. Still need to have a working

The graphical way to do this is to go into Synaptic or Upgrade Manager,
find where it specifies software sources, and uncheck a box that says
"long term support only" or some such.  (Yes, my recollection is vague,
but this should help if you really need to find it on the web).

My personal bias with Ubuntu is a bit extreme.  I use upgrades as an
excuse for regular house-cleaning: I take one last look at my secondary
hard drive to make sure that none of the stuff that I haven't used for
years is still of interest to me, then I swap primary and secondary, and
I do a clean install of the latest Ubuntu.  Then I pull data off my
now-secondary drive as needed until the next time I clean house.

If I were going to criticize myself for anything, it would be that with
hard drive prices the way they are, I should probably archive the old
one and go get a brand new primary drive.

Not only does this keep the amount of old cruft in my disks to a
minimum, but it lets me completely side-step all "breaks on upgrade"
issues (which Ubuntu may not have problems with now, but it certainly
has in the past).

It would certainly be a maximal-force solution to your friend's wedged
window manager issue.

out of curiosity, why is anyone still using apt-get on ubuntu?  i use
aptitude exclusively these days.  favorite feature:
/var/log/aptitude.log

second favorite feature:  dependency resolution scoring ("this is
close...is it close enough? [Y/n]")

i guess that dependency resolution scoring thing can be annoying
sometimes and i have fallen back to apt-get on rare occasion, but not
in cases like this =)

aptitude rocks -- though the curses-based interface you get when 
calling aptitude without arguments pretty much defines the word

+1 Aptitude's dependency tracking is also great for removing packages 
(and all of the unused libraries they needed, via aptitude

Message-ID: <86hb56ibef.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


We need to replace some devices that we sold to a local nerd last
winter, and also I'd like to get a spare Alix for myself.  I order
directly from Zurich, which is cheap on parts but expensive on
shipping.  Amortizing across a larger order should help mitigate the
shipping costs a bit.  In the past, we've seen shipping times of about
10 days.  

Unless someone pipes up to say that we should really float the order
costs and collect at delivery, as in normal Dorkbot group orders, I
think Personal Telco would want the funds in advance of ordering.

If there is something you see at: http://pcengines.ch/order1.php?c=4
that you'd like, please email me and I'll add it to the wiki page
here:

  http://wiki.personaltelco.net/PCEnginesGroupOrder2011

They have particularly attractive prices on RF pigtails, wifi radios, and
little antennas compared to what I've seen from US retailers.

Keith Lofstrom raves about the Alix he has, and we've had good
experience with them at Personal Telco.  I'm using one right now as my
gateway router at home with OpenWrt.  I have another one that I used
to build a wifi mapping box for the car, with built-in audio and video
(http://pcengines.ch/alix3d3.htl ... currently out of stock, boo).
Turns out, Compact Flash is much faster than 12Mbps usb-storage.

Galen:
I've been real busy and just have not got back to the system that I 
tried a DVI cable with to make any further tests / observations, but 
think I may have found out what the fellow was trying to tell me about 8 
bit VS 6 bit DVI.

As I understood him, he was telling me it was a difference in the 
cables, but after looking further, it seems as though some LCD monitors 
only use 6 bits of DVI color information and "dither" surrounding 
pixels.  See the article at the link below.

http://compreviews.about.com/od/multimedia/a/LCDColor.htm

I should try DVI with a better monitor.

Yes linux, either centOs or RHEL.

Problem is I don't have login access. I only have the ability to scan 
the server remotely.

an interesting conundrum.  i couldn't figure out a way to make any of
my services tell me that (sendmail connection header, apache version
#, sshd version string, etc).  i am kind of glad since hey, there's no
reason i'd want you to know whether i have a 64bit modern CPU or am
running ELKS linux on a 286 unless i was willing to tell you.

i'm certain some services (and some configurations of some
services--sendmail banner is entirely config-file-user-configurable,
for instance) leak that info even if not explicitly. what services is
it running?

The context is we're doing a data center migration that's going from 
physical to virtual, and I can't automate my virtual builds unless I 
know OS bitness (So no black hat work going on...).

Customer wants to limit manual login work on the servers. End result is 
I know if it's a CentOS or RH, but no idea of services, applications, 
etc. that might be running.

The one I'm testing with is running Apache, but it doesn't seem like 
Apache is leaking it's bitness. 80 and 443 are open, but the other ports 
are shut.

The other problem I realized is I could be talking to the firewall or 
load balancer, and in that case I can't trust my return data.

PLUS, I downloaded the OS Fingerprinting for Fun and Profit ppt, and 
learned of the IP Personality project 
(http://ippersonality.sourceforge.net/). This Linux kernel module allows 
you to spoof your OS fingerprint. If anyone is looking for ways to 
protect themselves, this seems the ideal solution. For me though, just 
another nail in the coffin of what originally looked like a promising 
solution.

I frequently do things like this by running a script to log in to a list of
servers and run a command remotely, logging the output to a file locally.

for a in $(cat serverlist);do echo "$a - ";ssh root@$a uname -m;done >
server-arch-list
(untested, this is just a concept)

If you're setting the bitness of the Virt-CPU, just use x86_64.
It's as fast (or faster), and doesn't limit your server choices.

If you're setting the bitness of the VM's kernel and environment, you need
root shell access to do a good migration anyway.

Customer wants to pretend they know how to do your job better than you do.

Good luck and bill lots of hours, :)

I'm seeing the value you want in the nmap fingerprint output via:

    nmap -A -vvv <hostname>

    ...
    OS:x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu...
    ...

There probably is a more succinct way to get the info, though.

Well here, and so for fun, here's a quick 'n' dirty bash script to 
automate the task over n hosts given at the command line, e.g.

Usage: ./detect_bitness <host1 [host2 ...]>

    #!/bin/bash

    function die() {
         echo "$@"
         exit 1
    }

    function detect_os() {
         output=$(nmap -A -vvv "$@")
         [ -z "$output" ] && die "Bad output from nmap."

         arch=$(echo $output | grep x86_64)
         if [ -z "$arch" ];  then
             # Assume limited set of archs;
             # only modern and Genuine Intel (tm) brand certified
    processors ;-)
             echo "32"
         else
             echo "64"
         fi
    }

    [ "x$EUID" == "x0" ] || die "Run as root."

    while read line; do
         hosts=($line)
         for host in ${hosts[@]}; do
             bitness=$(detect_os "$host")
             echo "$host: $bitness"
         done
    done <<< "$@"

Jason,

Linux Fund generally drives a minivan to LinuxFest NW with a couple of
us and a couple other people and lots of baggage for our booth and
what not.  We would be interested in enlarging our minivan or joining
someone in a small bus or what ever.  However, we would want to make
sure that we had transportation that would allow us to use cheap
hotels and go to an office supply store for whatever we need while we
are at LinuxFest.  We would be happy to continue paying what we do now
without regard to what others pay.   We just want to see people attend
the event.

  Sincerely,

New York City, September 20th-23rd.

It's for developers, data scientists, data analysts, and other data
professionals. Three days of the nuts-and-bolts needed for building a

Subject: [PLUG] sandybridge video
Message-ID: <4E59B428.2060409@pippiandcarlos.com>

Just got a Thinkpad with a Core 15 and a Sandybridge video card. The video
is acting odd in certain X windows but not others. So far I see xterm,
emacs, a qemu guest VM and the Android emulator affected.

The video will freeze until a newline is printed. It's acting like there
isn't enough buffer flushing going on. The blinking cursor will disappear in
xterm and emacs.  Focusing another window and then coming back causes a
refresh, followed by another freezing fit that can only be alleviated by
another focus switch.

I wonder if there's an Xorg driver option that might cause less buffer
"smarts" and better flushing.  Here's the list produced by Xorg -configure:

    #Option     "DRI"                   # [<bool>]
    #Option     "ColorKey"              # <i>

    #Option     "FallbackDebug"         # [<bool>]
    #Option     "Tiling"                # [<bool>]

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1108281621030.16325@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   This is unexpected: I cannot re-arrange the order of the tabs in
firefox-3.6.19. I can move a tab (but it is a mini view of the page rather
than the tab itself), but it then snaps back to its original position when I
release the trackball button.

   Has this happened to anyone else? Have I accidently mis-configured the
tool?

No problem here with Firefox 3.6.20 on Fedora 14, x86_64, Gnome
desktop. 

I think Firefox creates a new config file on launching if there is not
already one. So try renaming your config file after closing Firefox,
then restart Firefox. That should at least tell you if it's in your
personal settings or the program itself.

   A Google search and rummaging around the preferences appears to have found
the culprit: the ad block add-on.

   Why blocking ads would affect movement of tabs makes no sense to me. But,
apparently that's what is going on.

Glad you found the answer. However, I have the Ad Block plugin installed
and enabled, and I can still move tabs around. My Ad Block version is
1.3.9 and Firefox is 3.6.20, if that information is any help.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1108291542370.12736@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   My new Acer S201HL DVI-capable monitor arrived today. Naturally, the
instructions on how to install it are on the enclosed cd-rom which can't be
read until the monitor is installed and working.

   Anyway, I attached the heavy DVI cable I bought at ENU to both the monitor
and the system and turned on the monitor. No signal it kept telling me. So I
tried the DVI cable that came with it. Same result: no signal. As a last
resort, I used the VGA cable. Signal.

   Reading the manual suggests that the vga cable needs to be attached along
with the dvi cable. Does this make sense? If this is the case, I cannot use
the heavy ENU cable as its plug is too big to fit the socket with the vga
plug installed. The Acer dvi cable is thinner with smaller plugs.

Rich,
    I believe that your Acer monitor has an input selection in the menu.
you need to open the menu using the buttons on the monitor and find the
input secetion in order to choose the DVI input.  You should not need to use
a VGA cable alongside or in replacement of your DVI cable.

Mike,

   As I wrote to Ronald (who responded off the list), I'm dumb enough to have
thought the monitor firmware would auto-detect the video mode since it
auto-detects so much else.

   Regardless, I find using the mystery buttons along the bottom edge of the
screen quite frustrating. I can bring up the first menu, but the buttons
corresponding to the triangles under each icon don't select that icon. What
each button does seems to be context dependent and hidden from us mere
users.

   However, the right-most button causes the display to blank and small VGA
and DVI icons appear in the upper right. Alternating. Not pausing nor
letting me select one or the other. VGA is the default, that's what the
monitor is going to use regardless of my pressing that button (or even
holding it in).

   Tomorrow I'll try to contact Acer tech support and see if anyone there can
help. Shouldn't be this difficult.

Thanks,

Rich

Is the vga port coming from onboard video, while the dvi is coming from a separate graphics card? If so, you may need to disable onnboard graphics in the bios. I've been bit by that situation before...

Date: Mon, Aug 29, 2011 3:47 pm


   My new Acer S201HL DVI-capable monitor arrived today. Naturally, the
instructions on how to install it are on the enclosed cd-rom which can't be
read until the monitor is installed and working.

   Anyway, I attached the heavy DVI cable I bought at ENU to both the monitor
and the system and turned on the monitor. No signal it kept telling me. So I
tried the DVI cable that came with it. Same result: no signal. As a last
resort, I used the VGA cable. Signal.

   Reading the manual suggests that the vga cable needs to be attached along
with the dvi cable. Does this make sense? If this is the case, I cannot use
the heavy ENU cable as its plug is too big to fit the socket with the vga
plug installed. The Acer dvi cable is thinner with smaller plugs.

Nathan,

   Both ports are on the motherboard. I'll pull the manual and see if I need
to change a switch setting on it.

Thanks,

   Nothing in the Asus manual. I've a call into ENU to ask them.

   So much for plug-and-pray, eh?

Subject: [PLUG] Postfix and IPV6
Message-ID: <20110830043847.GB21500@gate.kl-ic.com>

I am setting up a second outside server at Linode with CentOS 6 
for my wife's new office.  One of the surprises was configuring
the postfix MTA (mail transfer agent) and mailman for IPV6.

The linode/centos virtual has IPV6 enabled out of the box.  After
much inept bungling, debugging, and gnashing of teeth, I realized
the reason that postfix was not accepting messages from the
mailman list software was that they were coming from IPV6
localhost [::1] rather than IPV4 localhost 127.0.0.1 . 

So instead of a main.cf file containing:  
   mynetworks = 127.0.0.1, ... 
I needed to use:
   mynetworks = [::1], 127.0.0.1, ...
And yes, the square brackets are required for postfix to parse
the address.  There is nothing about IPV6 in most of the older
postfix documentation, including the Kyle Dent book from O'Reilly.

The world needs a much better, example/cookbook oriented postfix
book.  With a glossary.  And interpretations of error messages.
Some of us (including all Mac OSX users) don't have the time to
become postfix virtuosos for two or three machines.

   The saga continues ... and is well beyond my comprehension.

   This morning when I logged in and started X the upper left of the root
window had the default Xfce image rather than the image I selected. This
overlaid image extends about 90% toward the bottom of the screen and about
80% toward the right edge. Looks like two root windows.

   Well, that's what I now have!

   When I check the xfce desktop setting dialog box I see two tabs: Monitor 1
(VGA-0) and Monitor 2 (DVI-0). Huh? Is this becasuse both cables are
connected? Yep.

   Pressing the button on the bottom edge of the screen for video mode now
seems to defalut to DVI. So I disconnected the VGA cable since the lighter
DVI desktop took over the entire screen.

   However, this now affects how the Xfce panel works. Ever since the auto
hide feature was added in version 2 or 3, I use that. When the cursor is not
on the panel itself there's only a thin line at the bottom of the screen.
Moving the cursor over that line brings up the panel so different virtual
desktops or applications can be selected. But, while the panel hides, it
won't un-hide; it ignores the cursor position. Until I get this resolved the
panel stays up all the time (or I cannot change applications.)

   Why this would be in DVI mode and not in VGA mode makes no sense to me.
This whole issue is taking too much of my time since I don't watch movies or
play games on the computer.

   If anyone here has suggestions how to resolve this issue, please let me
know. I'm no longer seeing two monitors on the Settings -> Desktop display,
so I'll replace the existing DVI cable with the bigger one I bought at ENU
... Real Soon Now ... when I can take more time to futz with this. My
futzing priority now is getting the panel auto hide working again.

At a guess, there's some wonkery going on with your X11 setup, and
it's confusing Xfce.  It (X11) has probably set itself up for two
separate displays, VGA (Screen0) and DVI (Screen1).  But, since
your DVI port is working now, you can fix that.  Make sure the VGA
cable is unplugged, and restart your X11 server.  That should
cause it to regenerate its settings, and with any luck, make Xfce
happy.

Hope this helps.

Dale,

   Not only is X being confused, but so am I. I tried your suggestion. The
monitor reported 'no cable connected' and would not display anything but
some thin lines at the very top edge of the screen.

   Disconnected the DVI cable and put back the VGA cable. Turned on monitor.
No display. Finally got sufficiently disgusted that I removed the monitor
and restored the Hanns-G vga-only. It's now working and I can get work done,
too, now.

   I'll bring the Acer to the next clinic and see if there's a monitor
hardware expert who can figure out how to make it work. I just cannot take
the time to continue screwing around with it.

   Cannot recall having such problems with a monitor and X even back in the
2.0 kernel days when getting the mode line correct was vital.

I seems that my video card (evga GeForce GT 430) only provides output to 
which ever output (DVI or VGA, have not tried HDMI yet) that it finds a 
device (monitor) at boot-up. I think I had to restart my system when 
switching between DVI and VGA cables.

Wayne,

   Interesting. I'm so used to not rebooting the idea doesn't occur to me.

   Getting all services running again on the server after a reboot is a bit
of a PITA. I'll check if it's necessary to get the darn monitor to work
properly.

Thanks,

Rich

Ditto what Wayne said.  Perhaps this is no longer relevant given newer 
  video drivers, but I would also recommend a reboot.  I think your 
video card may need to see the DVI monitor when initializing after a 
reset.

I know I pushed you to DVI.  Sorry you're encountering difficulties.

galen,

   Why dvi is so different from vga in having the system recognize it
probably makes sense to you folks who better understand the hardware.

   I'll wait for the weekend to shut down the system, hook up the new monitor
with only the DVI cable, turn the box back on and see what happens ... if I
can see anything, that is. :-)

   In the meantime I've a ton of client work to do and, as you know from
working in a small business, there's all the end-of-month administrivia to
be completed. Futzing with recalcitrant monitors will just have to wait.

Thanks,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] Copy protection question...
Message-ID: <1314768593.13148.29.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

Does anyone know what kind of copy protection is employed by a VHS copy
of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 25th Anniversary Edition?  The GREX
can't handle it whatever it is.  Another movie giving me trouble is Star
Trek First Contact.  For another example of a problematic movie, there
is Alice in Wonderland, the animated one by Disney.

Considering I have a right to play these tapes privately as many times
as I want on as many VCRs as I want, it stands to reason that I should
be allowed to copy them to a personal DVD or to a personal computer.  As
long as I don't give away or sell the copies, these are just backups in
more convenient formats.  Though I am trying to save space, I am keeping
the original VHS tapes for proof of purchase.  A computer with a large
hard drive is easier to work with than a pile of DVDs or a pile of VHS
tapes, so there is a convenience issue as well as a space issue.  VCRs
are going away, so there is an issue of losing access to this media
entirely if something isn't done.

Is there any way to hook a VCR up to a Linux system directly to get
around copy protection schemes that the GREX doesn't handle?
Macrovision isn't the only scheme in widespread use.

I think the VHS DVD combo recorder that I have, which I am feeding video
to via component jacks, GREX in the feed, from an external VCR, is
getting anti copy codes from some tapes.  This suggests a scheme(s) that
the GREX is not designed to handle.  I need to know whether the
undefeated scheme(s) are video or audio schemes.  I also need to know if
there are reasonably priced hardware devices that defeat them.  Barring
a hardware solution, is there a Linux compatible software solution?

Out of about 100 tapes, I have maybe 10 that didn't copy.  Is there any
way to fight industry use of anti copying technology?  One of the
reasons to stay away from Windows 7, digital restrictions management.  I
have heard horror stories of people not being allowed to access their
own personal movies.  The industry by and large has the computers
belonging to most people wasting CPU cycles to determine whether or not
they should be permitted to view a particular media source.  This in my
opinion is not what most people buy a computer for.  If more people knew
what Windows 7 is doing and they knew about Linux which is DRM free, I
bet there would be more Linux users.

While I don't have an answer to the technical part of your question, I
applaud your viewpoint on DRM.  DRM is a scourge on this planet &
needs to be fought.  Apple is one of the worst offenders when it comes
to Digital Resrictions Management, with many other companies close
behind.

Subject: [PLUG] VoIP group?
Message-ID: <20110831215348.GB28645@kailarose.respond2.com>

I know there's folks here who work with VoIP and other telephony stuff.
Is there an active VoIP list/forum/group for the PDX area?

Looks like the "Oregon VoIP User Group" never took off:
http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Oregon+VoIP+User+Group

Context: I'm hoping to find folks who can use a couple Digium TE110P PCI T1
cards (for Asterisk) before they go completely obsolete.  I inherited them
from an old job.  (There's also some Chenbro 2U rackmount cases.)

Thanks,
  Aaron

I need help with a Digium TDM410P analog card configured with 2 FXS and
2 FXO ports.  I have the O'Reilly book on Asterisk 1.8, but I don't know
where to look in the book for how to configure outbound calling from an
FXS connected handset.
