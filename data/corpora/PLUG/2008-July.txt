                                PRESENTATION

                         Stupid USB Keyboard Tricks
          Reading magstripes, barcodes, 10-key pads, and keyboards
                                    with
                                  libusb.

                                     by

                                Eric Wilhelm
                        <scratchcomputing at gmail.com>

    An overview of libusb, how usb keyboards (and keyboard-like
    devices) are handled by Linux and X, and how they can be
    disconnected from the main input driver for use and abuse
    by user-space code.

    This technology has useful applications such as connecting
    USB credit-card and barcode readers to point-of-sale software
    independently from the keyboard focus or keymap.  It also allows
    silly things like multi-player text editors or a 105-command
    program launcher.  Or you could just use it to change songs in xmms.

    Code will shown in small doses of Perl and C.  Hands-on
    demonstrations will be included as time allows.

    Caution:  presentation may result in a desire to attach one
    or more additional devices to your computer.

Thanks for all the help, everyone.

However, as I was going through the process of getting a copy of 
denyhosts, I had a different idea that I think is better. Rather than 
chase after these zombies trying to brute-force their way into my 
machine, I thought, why not just change the default sshd port? Now they 
can bang away on port 22 and get nowhere, and I don't have t look at 
their attempts in my logs and get annoyed.

But there's a new twist in FC 9 if it's running SELinux. Besides 
changing the SSH port at your firewall and in /etc/ssh/sshd_config, you 
also have to tell SELinux to add your new ssh port to its ssh_port_t 
label. To do this, (if you  used 1234 as your new ssh port) the command is:

||/usr/sbin/semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp 1234

There's a pretty decent web page that describes this and other SELinux 
isssues at http://equivocation.org/node/124.

Most modern scanners will find these ports and attack them anyways.

Moving the port is not a useful solution for this problem.

The less help ReactOS gets, the longer it is going to take to stabilize
it.  It would be awesome if the team could stabilize it early.  Aside
from Dirk Dashing Secret Agent, I don't see much effort to design
popular software for Linux.  The majority of effort, even by my game
company, is to produce software for Windows.  This doesn't just hurt
Linux adoption, it hurts adoption of other OS'es as well.  This Windows
bias that Intuit and other software companies are guilty of will give
Microsoft a stranglehold on the software market until an OS like ReactOS
takes off or wine gets 1000 times better.  Wine and ReactOS are
developing together, so helping the Wine project helps ReactOS.

Subject: [PLUG] Epson R300 printer replacement
Message-ID: <486AA802.8090803@acm.org>

My Epson R300 died a few months ago, thank goodness my wife's project 
was finished, and it would have cost more than I payed for the printer 
to repair it.  So I'm in the market for a replacement and am having a 
heck of a time choosing.

I favor Epson for a few reasons.  Beautiful photo print quality, print 
on CD/DVDs, and the six (or more) ink cartridge systems.  The down side 
is either buy a R280 at less than $100 or jump to $300 for the next 
model.  Plus it now it appears Epson is playing the cheap printer 
expensive cartridge game with the R280.  Even going to supermediastore 
they cost around $13.00 each. (carrotink is a much better price but I 
haven't used them before.)

There are only a few reviews on newegg but I got the impress the R280 
goes through ink fast and the Epson cartridges (one manufacturer is in 
China and the other is in Mexico) may not play well with each other. 
Make me worry about compatible cartridges.

I looked at a couple of HP Photosmart but they don't do CD/DVD.

So anyone using a Epson R280?

Any other suggestions for a Color Inkjet, CD/DVD, photo quality printer 
in the $100 range?

Anyone used carrotink before?


Thanks,
Rod

Intel used to sell spare board parts (like I/O panels) from their web
site. I'd start my search there.

Thanks anyways for the tip, I am having no luck on Intel's site.
Something about shop Intel is closing...  Is Intel hurting?  It
will work without the panel, it is just an annoyance more than
anything.  The part seems to be proprietary, I'm surprised that
there isn't an after market source for it.

Subject: [PLUG] Linksys w/ dd-wrt suddenly goes south
Message-ID: <486BEFE2.2000304@acm.org>

I have a Linksys WRT54GL running dd-wrt v23 standard that has suddenly
started going south at random times (as in several times a day).  It is
on a LAN with a Win2k server providing Active Directory services.
Previously the LAN used route-able IPs and now is on a private IP range. 
  There is most certainly residue of the old LAN still on the server.

When the Linksys goes down I can still get a wireless connection but my
N800 reports it as a link-local connection.  Typically I've seen this
when the DHCP lease does not include gateway information.

Currently I'm thinking it is flaky hardware but I'm looking for other
ideas.  There is a replacement Linksys coming, hopefully today, but I'm
hedging my bets in case it is something missed during the LAN changeover
and now a Windows service (DHCP, DNS) has come active and is using the
old network settings.

Any ideas?


TIA,
Rod

    Another symptom of the problem is that an ssh session to this
machine will often times lock up when I run a command like cat on a
large file.  The wired equivalent that would cause this would be
unplugging the network line.  Tried pinging to test the link, 
0% packet loss even if I ping 200 times.  Well, ls can lock the
session up also.  In a couple of days, I'll up the onboard ram
by a factor of 4.

     I guess the question is, how do I get more information about
this problem?

     Done.

Right you are.  It will be on July 13th, second Sunday, 1pm at

If the traffic is increasing, or the load on the wall power circuit
is increasing (an air conditioner is attached, sagging the line power)
or the WRT is in a hotter room or any number of other environmental
conditions apply, then it may not be a flaky WRT. Instead, it can be
a flaky wall wart power supply.  Many of these seem to be marginal,
and in stressful conditions they can crap out, causing resets.  Increased
traffic load means increased packet power, which increases the load
on the wall wart.

Note that you can power a WRT with many 16V IBM Thinkpad laptop
adapters.  See the somewhat obsolete writeup at:

    http://www.keithl.com/Linksyspower.html

Note that since the sale to Lenovo, some new Thinkpads use a different,
larger diameter barrel on the AC adapter.  So check the connector size,
and voltage, first before ordering.  I know that the AC adapters for
the THinkpad 560, 570, T20, and T30 will work, and probably others,
and you can find these cheap on Ebay.

Also, just try cleaning the connector on the output of the wall wart.
If it is corroded, you may be losing power right there.

                                PRESENTATION

                         Stupid USB Keyboard Tricks
          Reading magstripes, barcodes, 10-key pads, and keyboards
                                    with
                                  libusb.

                                Eric Wilhelm
                        <scratchcomputing at gmail.com>

    An overview of libusb, how usb keyboards (and keyboard-like
    devices) are handled by Linux and X, and how they can be
    disconnected from the main input driver for use and abuse
    by user-space code.

    This technology has useful applications such as connecting
    USB credit-card and barcode readers to point-of-sale software
    independently from the keyboard focus or keymap.  It also allows
    silly things like multi-player text editors or a 105-command
    program launcher.  Or you could just use it to change songs in xmms.

    Code will shown in small doses of Perl and C.  Hands-on
    demonstrations will be included as time allows.

    Caution:  presentation may result in a desire to attach one
    or more additional devices to your computer.

As a last resort.  I'd have to reprogram it it will all their settings. 
  That is assuming the nvram settings would be corrupted and a

Thanks Keith.

I didn't think of this and I am using the same socket that the Sonicwall 
was using.  Could be a marginal wall-wart.  It has been pretty hot here 
during the day.  The flip side to that is all the comm equipment is here 
and it is on a UPS so hopefully I'm not getting caught by the 
side-splash of an infinite-improbability-drive.

Wil, 

Are you in SE PDX? The power was out for blocks around in my corner of Mt 
Tabor. Took about 3+ hours for the crews to get it back up.

same way you debug any other problem of unknown origin and nature:
try to isolate the failure case.

since you have something that will trigger it, try seeing if you can
find the exact length of output that will trigger it every time, and
if removing one byte will always save you--is the problem consistent?
try making the file you cat contain different characters--are all
spaces ok?  maybe it's a control character that hangs up the
connection.  does using ssh with -v to connect give you any more
information during the disconnection?  do any other connection types
(telnet, web) also hang?

this is sounding to me more and more like corrupted network packets,
which could come from bad cabling, cards, ram, switch (if any), cable
location (someone once told me that running net cables alongside power
cables would lead to interference).  does moving the machines to be
physically adjacent, directly corrected with a different cable, help
at all?

i'd also fire up tcpdump and see if there's anything obvious about the
failing packets--especially if you can reproduce the failure exactly
with something that's not ssh so you can read the plaintext contents
and see if any bits are flipped.

Well, if you're at the point where you're talking about replacing the 
unit then you're going to have to put back all the settings anyway 
whether you do it manually or the backup/restore method.

Message-ID: <486D02E8.9070806@seitzassoc.com>


Can someone confirm that openldap's passwordModify(exop) only updates 
the userPassword attribute?  I saw some discussion on the net that 
suggested that perhaps the NT and LM hashes might also get updated.  I 
suppose that if running passwd(1) with pam_password set to exop 
actually updated the NT and LM hashes, there would be no need for 
things like smbldap-passwd.

thanks,

This is especially true if you are not running the correct cable type
for the network speed of the link.

Keith responds:

I don't think I made myself clear.  This is not a "digital" thing.
It has more to do with a summation of small problems putting your
Linksys over the edge on apparently random occasions.

Your Linksys was designed for a home environment, working straight
out of the box and through some short warranty period, on average,
without too many resets.  Let's say that the average Linksys has 
a "power safety margin" of 1.5 under these conditions.  If the
margin drops below 1.0, it may fail.  The margin reducers rarely
line up, but they do from time to time.


1) Unless you have an "offline" UPS, it only makes things worse. 
An offline UPS converts wall AC power to battery voltage to output
AC power, and removing wall power has no immediate effect on the
output AC power.  If you need steady power, you must have one of
these.

The vast majority of storebought UPSs are the cheaper "online"
variety - the output is connected to wall power until it fails,
and then a relay switches the output from wall power to battery
generated power when the wall voltage drops below a threshold
(and switches again when the wall power comes back).

During the transition, as the relay contacts are moving from one
source to another, the output voltage drops to ZERO;  usually
for one or two line power cycles.  Most monitors and CPU power
supplies have enough internal energy storage to keep running through
the zero voltage time.  Not so the Linksys - its internal energy
storage is trivial, just enough to keep running between the lobes
of a robust power sine wave when drawing maximum power.  The Linksys
will do a power-on reset if power is gone for a very brief time.  


2) If you are transmitting more packets than a typical home setup
( back in the era the Linksys was designed for, 1Mbit DSL ), then
Linksys sucks down more power than it was designed for.  It needs
very steady power to keep running in these conditions.  It will
not get it under condition (1).


3) The Linksys draws 6 Watts transmitting.  The wall wart provides 1
amp, on average, approximately.  On average, the wall wart provides
that at 12V, but looking at the waveform with an oscilloscope, under
ideal conditions, the voltage bounces around between 8V and 16V
with an 8.3 millisecond period.  Power is current times voltage,
so 1A times 8V is 8W, only a small margin over 6W needed.  If the
margin goes negative, the Linksys loses power and resets.


4) The voltage waveform from your wall socket is not ideal.  If a
heavy load goes on line, like an industrial motor or a refridgerator
or an air conditioning pump anywhere on your branch circuit, it will
"sag" the power line voltage, possibly tripping the UPS, or else
just passing it through.  This can push the margin negative.  There
are voltage regulators upstream of your wall socket, but they take
some time to respond to loads.  In fact, the load of a shaded pole
induction motor at startup looks pretty close to a dead short.


5) The power connectors from the wall wart to the Linksys are
pretty crappy.  If you want a good, low resistance power connection
between units, you want gold-plated connectors.  If you don't have
that, then the connectors can corrode over time, increasing their
resistance.  Of course, that doesn't affect the unit new out of
the store (Linksys as a 100 foot, 100 second warranty as near as
I can tell).  So if corrosion over time causes half an ohm of
resistance in the connection (typically on the inner connection
pin, but also on the barrel) then that will take away about half
a volt of the supplied power under low voltage conditions.  You
can clean the connectors to improve this, although you should not
do this frequently or it will take off the chrome plating.


6) Miscellaneous other margin-reducing events.  For example, the
original WRT was flashed in the factory, for the first time, under
near-ideal conditions.  Flashing it a second or third time under
non-ideal conditions will make a few of the NVRAM bits a little
"weaker" and sensitive to smaller margins.  Some instructions on
a processor require more power than others.  Some patterns of
signals on interconnect wires require more power than others.
There are lots of little effects like this, some in hardware, some
in software.  Aging plays a big role in many of these effects.  


It is the sum of all these effects that can push a Linksys into the
negative margin regime.  With intermittent results;  if the transmit
packets occur during a line voltage sine wave peak, there is plenty
of margin.   If a burst of transmit packets occur while the AC cycle
is crossing zero, after a motor-induced power sag, on a hot day when
resistance is high, over somewhat corroded connectors, and you go
into negative margin and reset your Linksys.  Or your Actiontec, or
whatever cheap unit you've got.

Why does a laptop AC adaptor improve this scenario?  Primarily, it is
because the adapters have a large energy bucket inside, and are designed
to produce a regulated DC output voltage under a wider range of power
line conditions, to a heavier load.  They can produce 40 Watts, not 6W,
and they can provide it over many missing power line cycles.  Think of
it as a minature offline UPS.  If you use a 16V adapter, the Linksys
internal regulator draws 6W/16V or about 0.4 amps during transmitting,
and this means less power loss due to corrosion.   Empirically, using
16V laptop AC adaptors for powering Linksys devices JUST WORKS, with
almost no unexplained resets compared to the marginally inadequate
wall warts.  Again, read the web page I mention above.


Computer people often have a hard time understanding soft margins. 
It is assumed that something is either good or bad, without a gray
area.  That is NOT how things work in the real world.  I promised
to give a lecture to PLUG, "bits are a myth" (Real Soon Now), where
I explain the analog nature of the "Real World" and why the digital
approximation often fails.  Robust systems are designed with this
in mind.  Robust software is designed to sense marginal conditions
and recover quickly from small nondeterministic behavioral upsets.
That means NEVER assuming that a sequence of correct instructions
always produces the same result.  Always, always, test the result!

As we enter the era of unsteady power supply, and gigantic high speed
systems pushed right to the margin of failure, system designers and
programmers must take these effects into account or watch their
products exhibit "mysterious" "flaky" behavior in the field.  There
is actually nothing mysterious about the behavior; it is a fact of
life.   The mystery is why programmers cling to the myth of complete
mechanical determinism when experience contradicts it so often.

Russell is right.  I should not be writing that late in the evening.

The Clinic will be July 20th, the 3rd Sunday, just before OSCON.  I

then, time periods longer than a nanosecond are difficult for me

Okay, web access hasn't locked the machine up yet.  
That said, accessing the webcam_server page, I just 
get connecting please wait forever.  I suspected 
improper firewall, but I'm not seeing any dropped 
packets (via an iptables rule or lack of).

I can access the webcam page successfully if I'm on the 
direct wireless link off of this machine, it has two.  It 
would be prohibitive to run a wired link to this machine 
and I'd have to add a network card.  I am talking 100+ 
feet of ethernet cable outdoors.  I'd have to recompile 
the kernel to support a wired network card where it's 
slower than a seven year itch.  I'd probably be wise to
put the line in PVC which would cost me at least $12.90
for the PVC alone.

When I add the memory, I can switch to CentOS if I need to.

As far as the corrupted packets idea, there is another
wireless network in the same frequency range called 
abbys house.  My guess is that I need to be on a different
channel than abbys house, but what channel is abbys house
on?

I have a dead RBC6 battery and was losing my mail server yesterday :-(
The problem where I'm at is that the air conditioner was constantly
being turned on and off, the compressor that is, because the anti
freeze circuit is troublesome.  It needs an anti freeze circuit because
the ducts are undersized, house was built in 1955.  I have 2 units so
I'm running all four computers off of one for now and it is loaded.

If I wasn't on slow DSL, 1.5 down/256 up, I could see myself running
a mailing list ;-)  Verizon keeps advertising FiOS, but I'm in 
Scappoose and stuck with CenturyTel.  FiOS would be nice.

for purposes of debugging, you can't move the computer?  i'm not
suggesting this as a solution, but as an investigative technique.

i'm just not convinced any of those actions will help with your
problem, though they will certainly cost you time and money.

this is my home network environment.  i'm "call 503-some-rat", and
even though i'm sharing the channel with 3 other networks, i never
experience transmission problems as a result.  not that that couldn't
be related to your problem, of course.

Yeah I'd forgotten this.  I was thinking I'd be able to pass the 
settings along to the next version.

Currently I have another system I'm putting together.  I'll program it 
with the IP, netmask, gateway, etc. and swap it with the one on site. 
Bring that home and put it under stress here.

You were clear I wasn't.  The infinite-improbability drive reference was 
my way of implying that.  :-)  The problem router is brand new.  The one 
I use at home is a couple of years old and it's only been power-cycled 
it because I was having some problems with other equipment on the same 
UPS and power bar.  So I figured it was a sum-of-many things.

And thanks for the great in depth description.  It is going into my 
notebook.  Plus I'm now on the hunt for better power supplies 
(wall-warts) for _my_ Linksys routers.

The last WRT54GL that I bought came with an adapter that is 
considerably different from previous versions.  It is smaller and 
lighter, suggesting that is now some sort of switching supply.  This 
is not to suggest that it is necessarily 'better', though I suspect 
that it is at least a bit more efficient.

It turns out ssh really doesn't like packet loss.  People usually
don't notice this on wired networks with good reliability, but over
lossy wireless links you get rather too familiar with it.

I missed the part about this being a wireless link until later in the

You lost power too?

The power outage hosed one of my machines (not the mail server,
thankfully) by believing that the 200 gig drive was only 8.4 gigs on
reboot.  After I fixed that, it then reordered all the drives and forgot
which one was the boot drive.  Fast system, but hard to keep working
correctly.

Wil,

I second Paul's comment.

Thanks for running the web and list server.  It normally runs great
and is something I don't need to worry about.

No Intel is not hurting, they are just reorg'ing the online store.  I 
saw something about it the other day but thought it was only internal.  
I'll check around in my junk, but I don't think I have one.

Subject: [PLUG] Kubuntu sound progress; help still needed
Message-ID: <486E92D4.4050602@dslnorthwest.net>

Last evening I received some valuable pointers from Eric. One of the ideas was 
to create a new user and see if sound works with the default settings (I had 
copied my backed up /etc and /home stuff after installing 8.04).

I was able to get the sound to work: mic, system sounds, Amarok, and aplay, just 
by appropriate mixer settings.  And the error "xine was unable to initialize any 
audio drivers." which Amarok generates was absent.

So it appears that there is(are) some configuration issue(s) created by my 
pre-8.04 settings.

aplay generates errors which may provide some clues to those of you "skilled in 
the art":
~$ aplay test.wav

ALSA lib confmisc.c:1286:(snd_func_refer) Unable to find definition 
'defaults.pcm.dmix.device'

ALSA lib conf.c:3513:(_snd_config_evaluate) function snd_func_refer returned 
error: No such file or directory

ALSA lib conf.c:3985:(snd_config_expand) Evaluate error: No such file or directory

ALSA lib pcm.c:2145:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM default
aplay: main:546: audio open error: No such file or directory

This same collection of errors are produced if aplay is run as root.

Finally, I find the following text file named 
user-must-execute-asoundconf-set-default-card.update-notifier
in /usr/share/alsa.

I did not execute the indicated macro in the new user account to get the sound 
working. I tried it in my account, but no dice.

Can anybody offer suggestions as where to look for the offending configuration

Situation improved; new error.

I found a fix which said to delete .asoundrc and .asoundrc.asoundconf.  I hid 
them (renamed) and now Amarok, system sounds, etc work fine.  However, Audacity 
now is silent.  I would really like all to work.

Eric, you said that Audacity uses oss.  That is likely the key.  How do I get 
them both to work?  The original files are below (no new files were generated). 
  [This behavior, i.e., not creating a new file, seems to conflict with the man 
page.]

/home/parents/.asoundrc:

Subject: [PLUG] FC9 Is SELinux Ready Yet?
Message-ID: <487140F4.2010602@gisnet.com>

I'm working with a database and mapping server I recently set up with 
Fedora Core 9, and it comes with SELinux set to "enforcing" mode by 
default.  The concept sounds pretty good but as I am a relative beginner 
to Linux system administration, I'm finding SELinux hard to understand 
and manage.  My question to those more experienced is, is this ready for 
prime time yet or is it still mostly experimental? Are there any dire 
consequences if I just set it to permissive mode so I won't have to 
spend all this time trying to figure how to write a security policy for 
everything I do it doesn't like?

Thanks for any advice,
- Bill Thoen

Well, that depends on what you are doing.  For database use, it should
be fine.  There are tools that will show you what errors have occured
and where and give you an idea on how to resolve them.

Web servers are harder.  CGI code tends to do many complex things that
are hard to constrain.

Another pain is handling usb devices and other devices that can be
connected and disconnected.  Most work OK, but once in a while thay are
a pain.

There are some good books on SELinux.  The O'Reiely book was pretty
good.  If you are going to maintain a Redhat/Fedora system, you will
want to learn how it works.

Fedora first shipped SELinux in FC3. With FC4 it was enabled by default.
Red Hat has shipped it with both RHEL4 and RHEL5. While SELinux
continues to improve at an impressive pace, it has been "ready for prime
time" for years. Unfortunately, education is lagging.

With SELinux in permissive mode, you're back to basic Unix permissions.
Not as secure as possible, but good enough for most people for decades.

Subject: [PLUG] Sun E420r help
Message-ID: <48729AC6.80805@gmail.com>

All,

I just bought a Sun 420r and am attempting to put Solaris 10 on it. I'm 
using a Startech SV125 convert so I can use a PS2 and PC Monitor. 
However, I am not seeing an ok prompt after memory initialization. The 
cursor just sits there. Nothing I type on the keyboard registers on the 
screen. I'm assuming the startech isn't the problem since the monitor 
connection is working correctly.

Does anybody know how the boot process on the Sun 420r works? I'm 
assuming I should see an ok prompt at some point in which to tell the 
server to use the cdrom as the boot device.

thanks,
Dan H.

I use BlockHosts, which was inspired by denyhosts. I have never had a
problem with it.

I dream of having it keep its blocks in a central database so all my
servers can block the same bad guys without having to let them attack
and fail on each IP. Maybe in my copious free time...

well, i'd say you should hit stop-a and it should take you back to ok>
but since you're not using a sun keyboard, i'm not sure how you'd do
that...

i agree with your analysis that if you see the memory analysis, you're
good on monitor connection.  have you tried plugging a serial cable in
to see if it's using the serial port as console?  i've never tried
doing that with a sun, so i don't know at what point the serial
console would take over from the framebuffer (or if it would at
all)...but i know it's possible to go completely headless, and still
get access to the prom prompt (and i'm pretty sure 'break' is the
equivalent of stop-a on a serial console).

some googling reveals that you'll want a nullmodem and 9600 8N1
settings for that serial connection.

Just a WAG, as I don't even know what a 420r is.  Perhaps it is 
configured to use a serial console.

I have found that the more stock the system, the easier SELinux is to
get working.  Third-party applications, especially services or
proprietary ones, that don't know about SELinux are a pain to get
working.  Complicated services, like web servers, where lots of files
need to be correctly labelled are annoying.  Red Hat has put in lots
of effort to improving SELinux so later releases of Fedora or RHEL are
better.

Permissive has two advantages over disabling SELinux completey.  One,
it keeps the audit logs  so you can fix problems.  The setroubleshoot
tools helps make this easier.  Two, it keeps the filesystem labelled
correctly so that you can enable SELinux without relabelling the whole
filesystem.

All,

I just bought a Sun 420r and am attempting to put Solaris 10 on it. I'm 
using a Startech SV125 convert so I can use a PS2 and PC Monitor. 
However, I am not seeing an ok prompt after memory initialization. The

Does anybody know how the boot process on the Sun 420r works? I'm

Break-A for a serial console. Usually serial console software like
minicom has a special key sequence you can use to send a break.

Suns are very easy to manage from a serial console, once you work out
the right serial incantation, but you don't get the framebuffer, because
that's graphical.

Might consider trying a USB keyboard too, if the system is of the
vintage that supports USB.

+1 on the recommendation to use the serial console -- unless of course 
you want this as an X workstation, in which case a graphical 
installation is probably a good idea. :-)

420R's are nice for mail or database servers. They tend to do well 
with I/O. Their CPUs aren't terribly speedy. They come in large 4U 
cases, IIRC: well designed, but heavy.

If the Sun doesn't recognize the keyboard as a Sun type 5 then it will 
not display anything on the framebuffer, period.  The default console 
device is the serial port, if I remember correctly that unit has a DB25 
serial so you will need a DB25-DB9 null-modem cable.  As someone else 
said the Sun is very easy to manage from the serial port.  If you 
need/want the graphic console, you will need to find a real Sun type 5 
keyboard, that model did not support USB either.  Some of the PS2-Sun 
converters had a setting that would fake a type 5 so you might check the 
docs for the Startech, but you should be able to pick up a type 5 for a 
couple of bucks.

The 420r is a very nice unit, compact with four Ultra Sparc II 
processors and 4GB of RAM.  I think it had three internal drive bays for 
SCSI SCA 1" form factor disks.  If you need any Sun disk carriers, let 
me know.

Don't you need a windows workstation to work for odesk?  They have you
install monitoring software so they can watch every keystroke and
bathroom break.  You'd probably have to install cygwin, and then run
your linux box in an xnest window.

Thanks. With the converter, I may be able to do a key combo to get 
stop-a. If that doesn't work, I'm about to head up to radio shack to get 
a cable. Wish Free Geek were open Mondays...

I tested the converter by pulling the keyboard cable and on reboot it 
gave a keyboard error, so it definitely detects the PS/2 keyboard.

I figured out the stop-a sequence and was able to get the ok> prompt. 
Now I'm stuck without being able to boot the cdrom.

I've tested the cd on linux, and I'm able to read it just fine, so I 
don't think the cd is bad (burnt using k3b on Ubuntu). The cdrom drive 
might be bad, and I can't think of a way to test it. The other thing is 
it might not be installed properly. I'm currently trolling through the 
service manual to figure out how to install the cdrom and make sure it's 
working. Thanks for the help so far.

just for grins,

from the prom,

does 'show-devs' show the cdrom?

also try 'diag-switch? true' for extended POST diags..

For the two of you that have been following this sound saga, the system is now 
fully working, although I have suspicions that it could change at any time (it 
has already for unknown reasons).

The question I have now is why does removing .asoundrc and .asoundrc.asoundconf 
get things working? During the last failure I recreated .asoundrc (rename) [no 
change in sound behavior], restarted, removed .asoundrc, then sound worked.

If I knew the purpose of these two files then I might have a chance of avoiding 
future failure.

No, I had not.  Thanks for the link.  I just browsed it, and it makes me feel 
that deleting those files was a good idea. I note that /etc/asound.conf does not 
exist on my system either.

There must be something in those files which tells ALSA to do the wrong things.

I think it comes down to whatever was in those configs asking alsa to do 
the impossible.  I'm sure it was valid for your previous installation - 
and possibly generated by an older version of some config tool.  Major 
changes to device names (e.g. by the kernel, udev, etc), or possibly 
improvements in alsa which rendered an old work-around obsolete?  Or 
simply that the default configs (/usr/share/alsa/) renamed something -- 
the wiki says "Before ALSA 1.0.9 you often needed one to make things 
work at all ..."

Yeah.  I think "the wrong things" were:

>>> ALSA lib confmisc.c:1286:(snd_func_refer) Unable to find definition 
>>> 'defaults.pcm.dmix.device'
>>> ...
>>> ALSA lib pcm.c:2145:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM default
>>> aplay: main:546: audio open error: No such file or directory

At least that sounds like the config was trying to point to a 
non-existent device or something like it being told that your preferred 
devices is the null string.

>>> This same collection of errors are produced if aplay is run as root.

For what value of "$HOME"?  It sounds like it was still loading the 
config from your user's $HOME. I wouldn't expect root's permissions to 
get past the "No such file or directory" -- root is all-powerful, but 
he can't make the software all-knowing ;-)

That generation of machine had a SCSI cdrom, so just do

probe-scsi-all

to see if it shows up.  Make a note of where it is if it does show up, 
and check the definition of cdrom in the eeprom settings.  If I remember 
correctly, the eeprom command is 'showenv'.

You can also boot to the exact device using the whole device path.

All,

Thanks for the help. I haven't had the time to investigate further at 
the moment, actual paying work went and got in the way. I hope to take 
another shot this afternoon or tomorrow morning.

thanks,

Well, upgrading to 256 megs of ram didn't solve the problem.  At
least now I can put a different version of Linux on.  I'm using
ndiswrapper with a Realtek 8180 pci wireless card.  The RP-SMA
connector on the card is loose and I can't tighten it down.

I can ssh in, but I either have the session freeze or exit with
bad packet length.  If I have to plug in via ethernet, that sort
of defeats the purpose of the machine as a wireless repeater.  At
least if I move the machine and switch to an ethernet connection,
I'll be able to isolate the problem.  I'm looking at the prospect
of burying an ethernet line and taking out the interbuilding
wireless link.

I don't remember seeing in your previous posts whether you ran a ping on one
console/terminal/screen/etc, and an ls on the other, to see if the whole
link dies, or just the ssh connection. Can you try this?

Is this something you can allow outsiders to connect to to troubleshoot
directly?

At least for troubleshooting, you don't really need to bury the cable...
just run it over the ground for a few minutes.

Just a few quick thoughts that might help with debugging:

Have you looked at the output of:

  ifconfig <interface>

where <interface> is the name of your wireless interfaces to see how
many errors and what types of errors (rx/tx/etc) are being reported?

Have you tried pinging across the same path as your ssh session with
different sizes of packets?

I don't remember if you looked in your ssh server's log... does it give
any more details about what is going on?

good luck,
tim

This might be a long shot. But I just the other day I was having
flaky wireless behavior on a system on which I'd just replaced a hard
drive. It turned out to be that the SATA cable was too close to the
wireless card and was generating interference. When I rerouted the
cable it took care of the problem.

So check for noise sources both inside and near your box.

Well, maybe. 

It has run Ubuntu just fine for a long time, updated to Hardy when it
came out. During the thunderstorm a week or so ago there was a sudden
power outage for a couple seconds, sufficient to kill the computer. I
did not reboot because I wasn't using it anyway. 

So this evening I decided to boot it up. All I can get is the splash
screen that says ASUS M2NPV-VM. It does not proceed to the Grub boot
menu. It does not give me an error message. It just hangs on the ASUS
splash screen.

There are two 320 GB hard drives in a software mirror with mdadm.
However, the hard drive light on the case does not come on.

A Knoppix live CD boots just fine. During the boot process Knoppix says:

Scanning for hard disk partitions and creating /etc/fstab ... Done

After booting it sees sda1 through 4 and sdb1 through 4 (corresponding
to the four RAID partitions), but those are the partitions - the
filesystem is actually on mda2, which does not appear. 

Any suggestions for how I can repair it?

John,

I would suggest running grub (from Knoppix).
Read up on how to select the partition to boot from, then have it reinstall
the grub boot loader.
You do have backups for this stuff... Yes????

Good luck,

Does it boot a Hardy Heron LiveCD? I'd think that would have a better 
shot at finding the partitions than Knoppix.

Naturally I couldn't check via ssh, so I checked via a console login
for transmit and receive errors and found that there are zero.  Which
is odd considering that ssh is reporting bad packet size.

> Have you tried pinging across the same path as your ssh session with

How do I ping with a different size packet?

Which log?  There are at least two I can look at.  There's the log on

By "ssh server's log" I mean the long written by the sshd you are

Thanks for the suggestion. It solved my problem, but not the way either
of us expected.

It did, indeed, boot a Hardy live CD. But when I checked in Nautilus it
did not find the hard drives either, same as Knoppix. 

However, it did find something else - a partition called "Windows
Backups," which it said it could not mount because the NTFS file system
was corrupt. Aha! At that point I remembered that I had added a 160 GB
USB drive that had at one time been used on a Windows system for
backups. In fact, I knew that the file system on the drive was bad and
had intended to reformat it to use for distro downloads. 

Acting on a hunch, I disconnected the USB drive and rebooted the
computer without a live CD. My old Hardy came up as usual and all is
back to normal.

My apologies to PGE. It was the flaky USB drive that was causing Ubuntu
not to boot. Having said that, a flaky external drive should not cause
the main filesystem not to load. Grub should go where it was told to go
and boot the OS it finds there.

Betcha a Penguino that the backup battery is worn out.  If you go
into setup mode (hold down DEL during boot) you may see some funny
settings.  If you made any changes from the default setup, I hope
you wrote them down someplace - then you can re-enter and save them,
and the machine will probably work. 

If it does, then the problem is likely the battery.   The battery
is a CR2032 3V lithium coin battery, on the left or bottom side,
depending on whether it is mounted horizontally or vertically ( I
run a M2NPV-VM too ).  A CR2025 will work, too, though it will be
a little loose and not last quite as long.

You can find the CR2032 almost anywhere; they are pretty standard
and should cost less than $4.  I will also bring one to the clinic.

You said initially it never got to grub, so grub isn't guilty of 
anything if it never got the chance to load. I'm betting the external 
hard drive came up in the boot order before the internal drives.

Keith responds with a related question:

I moved my OpenVPN link from my Portland site (Alternet ISP) to
connect directly to my Verizon FIOS firewall.  Faster, but packets
still route through Seattle, with 65msec ping times.  This is costing
me time, and the ISPs money. 

Does anyone have any practical suggestions about how to reach the
geeks at Verizon and at Alternet, and talk them into joining nwax.net ?
Anybody here know somebody working at one or the other?

The customer support folks at both places are unlikely to have a
clue, so that is not the right place to start.

However, perhaps Google, which must also connect to the Verizon
POP in Seattle, also has an interest in pushing on Verizon to
connect Portland area routes through nwax.net here, closer to
their Hood River site.  Any helpful people at Google?

Google is in The Dalles, not Hood River.  Or were you referring to
Verizon?

This machine is the backup machine. It also has the ISOs that I have
been downloading for the Clinic. Everything on it is easily
replaceable, so no backups of it are necessary. That is, unless you
think it is necessary to have backups of the backups. 

As for the UPS, yes I do have one. It is sitting on the floor unused
because it takes extra electricity and generates heat which I then must
use more electricity to remove from the room. I bought the UPS a long
time ago when my main computer was a desktop, but now my main computer
is my laptop which has its own battery.* As noted above, the desktop
machine is not mission critical. 

*Interestingly, the power failure also locked up the laptop, requiring
a reboot. How that could have happened when the laptop was sitting in
its docking station with its battery available is interesting. I have
had power failures before where the laptop just automatically went to
its own battery. Any ideas why it didn't this time?

When I read this my first reaction was "of course, why didn't I realize
it would try to boot from the USB device before the hard disk." But
then it occurred to me that I also had a flash drive inserted and it
didn't try to boot from it.

The BIOS is, indeed, set to boot first from the optical drive, second
from a USB drive, and *if no OS is found on either one*, then the hard
drive. So you are correct, Grub is not at fault. But the BIOS should
have found no OS on the USB drive and then proceeded to the hard drive.
The fault is in the BIOS.

A drive doesn't have to have an OS on it to be bootable. It just needs a 
bootloader. Even if it's partially broken for whatever reason, if there 
is is a working MBR on the drive the computer goes to it. Once that 
happens, the search for additional booting drives stops. The hand off 
was made, the BIOS's job is over. Repartition the external drive and you 
should be good.

Subject: [PLUG] Verizon FIOS - Traffic shaping against VOIP?
Message-ID: <20080710154334.GA14803@gate.kl-ic.com>


When looking at path delay between my Verizon FIOS home machine and
a machine in Portland on Alternet, I noticed some "interesting"
ping results.  1000 pings sent at 0.2sec intervals sent to the 
Verizon POP in Seattle revealed that the vast bulk of the pings
returned between 12 and 15 msec - about what one would expect from a
lightly loaded network.  However, about 50 (5%) of the pings returned
between 20msec and 80msec, with a fairly uniform distribution.  

This is not what I would expect;  I would instead expect that the
delays would follow a Poisson distribution, smoothly tapering towards
zero with longer delays.  However, I don't know a lot about network
traffic delays.  Is this normal, or are some of the packets being
intentionally delayed to screw up services like VOIP?

This weekend, I will run some longer ping trials to get a better
idea of the shape of the outliers, perhaps by running two pings
in parallel with slightly different intervals to see if (1) the
delays correlate and (2) they interfere because of some throttling
mechanism.  I will also run a looping ifconfig on the firewall to
do a total packet count on the interface.  Anything else I should
try,  such as setting particular QOS bits on the ping?

Also, it would be nice to try the ping tests against another 
Washington County Verizon FIOS customer.  Volunteers with an
IP address?

Any large ISP is probably going to set the QoS priority on pings to be 
pretty low; which makes performance trending using only ping pretty 
difficult.

I would try hping using your protocol of choice (IP/UDP/ICMP) against 
the service ports you are trying to use.
Vary your packet size, etc to try and simulate normal usage.

The bios on my main machine does something stranger.  If you reboot with
a USB drive or add a drive, it will reorder the entire set of drives and
try to boot from one of them chosen at random.

Fun huh?

That machine is giving me all sorts of grief.

Anyone know of a good way to verify video card memory?  I suspect that
the video card has a problem that only happens once in a while.

If you have access to both ends then I would use something like iperf using UDP.
You can test various levels and iperf will give you the info about
drops and bandwidth expected and used.

Where is Verizon Fios available anyways?

DSL isn't the greatest and Comcast doesn't do subnets for home accounts.
Comcast, it is rumored, gets picky about bandwidth usage.

On the subject of bandwidth, is Opus overloaded?

Up until the last yum update (including rpmforge) when I pressed the F6

Now that "version 2.0.0.14 (20080526)" is running I'm only able to get 
to the message body by mouse clicking into it or by pressing the ENTER 
key when the message is selected in the folder contents pane.

Then sometimes pressing F6 will move the message Subject: field and then 
Date: field.  An additional press of F6 put me back in the "All Folders" 
pane.

Anyone else seeing this behavior?  Anyone else care? :-)  Since I have 
four email accounts I monitor and one of those has 30+ 
folders/sub-folders fiddling around with the mouse or ENTER and ESC key 
all the time to be able to scroll down through the message content is a 
pain.

Depends.  If you have Verizon phone service then there is a chance.  Without
Verizon service in your area; you are out of luck.

I have FIOS internet.  It was rolled out in Hillsboro Feb-Mar of 2006.
 The problem
with the roll out was that customers that had DSL with other providers
because of
Verizon's EULA were forced to switch to Verizon in Aug 2006 or make other
 choices.  They terminated the local loop DSL provider's access to the home.

PLUG Advanced Topics

Date:      July 16th 2008
Time:      7pm - 9pm
Location:  Jax Bar
           826 SW 2nd Avenue
           Portland, OR

Topic:     Embedded Linux
Speaker:   Josh Triplett <josh at freedesktop.org>
           Portland State University

The talk will be on how to get started with embedded Linux, based
on my experiences with the flight computer for the Portland State
Aerospace Society.  My talk will walk through all the steps I followed
to get the flight computer booting up to a shell prompt, and explain
precisely what the system does between hitting the power button and
the shell prompt.  This will include a discussion of the u-boot
embedded bootloader, working with TFTP, handling onboard flash (MTD)
devices, working with a PowerPC device tree, using busybox, and
building an initramfs.

Usual meeting rules apply.

Message-ID: <4877EE0E.3020604@seitzassoc.com>

Hi,

I've noticed that my umask is set to 0022 when I login to gnome.  If I 
login to the console, my umask is 0002, as per /etc/bashrc.  To my 
knowledge, none of my dot files contain a umask command.  What 
controls the umask in a gnome gui login?  My searches haven't turned 
up a definitive answer.  Setting the umask to 0022 sort of defeats the 
purpose of user private groups.

This is on a CentOS 5.2 machine.

thanks,
galen

David, 

Thanks for posting this.

I registered for this, at least I think I did. I got a response that
said "Thanks! Your response will now appear in my spreadsheet," which
is apparently a Google docs spreadsheet.

I really hope there will be no problem when I show up on the 21st.

Fedora 9 got some pretty unfavorable reviews for reasons like this. 
Still, there are "stable" distributions -- CentOS, Debian Etch, Gentoo 
stable, for example -- and there are "community / testing / unstable / 
bleeding edge" distros -- Fedora, openSUSE, Debian Lenny/Sid, Gentoo 
"~arch", Ubuntu, for example.

If you want stable, pick a stable distro and stick with it. You'll still 
probably get security updates every few days that you need to deal with, 
but it won't be 250 -- more like four or five at the most. It's like 
buying a car -- don't buy the first model year. :)

That said, I've had fairly good luck with openSUSE 11 on my laptop. It's 
the first Linux I've put on it that found and configured my Belkin USB 
wireless adapter, for example.

The blame for shipping a beta version of Firefox belongs more to
Mozilla's distro-unfriendly policies and unfortunate timing than to
Fedora.

Your bandwidth is being sucked up by another user. How is this Fedora's
fault? Or the site is slow. Again, not Fedora's fault.

Like all distros, Fedora spends months testing each new release, just
like you suggest. However, rather than remaining stuck in time for an
extended period of time, subjecting users to a sub-optimal experience by
only shipping critical security updates, Fedora has chosen a liberal
update policy.

Fedora's updates resolve both major and minor security problems, bugs
and developer curiosity. Fedora is meant to be a cutting edge
distribution for developers and enthusiasts. Its policies are designed
to minimize response time, keep things uncomplicated for unpaid
volunteers, and increase the exposure of cutting edge but (hopefully)
stable software.

I choose to use Fedora, Ubuntu and openSUSE because I want to be on the
cutting edge for several reasons. 1) I'm a developer and I prefer to
work with the latest technologies. 2) I'm a system administrator and I
need to know what's coming down the pipeline. 3) I can.

If you don't want to be on the cutting edge, use a "long term support"
distro like RHEL, CentOS, SLES or Debian Stable. (I'd also like to
suggest Ubuntu LTS, but it has had a pretty steady stream of updates
this time around and you apparently want to avoid that.)

Still, rumor has it that Fedora 9 hasn't been as solid as Fedora 8 was 
with the same distance from the release. I don't have any hard metrics, 
just low-grade gossip and FUD from people who undoubtedly have axes to 
grind. I tested it on my laptop and probably would be running it today 
if openSUSE hadn't picked up my wireless. Fedora didn't.

Well ... I don't know how "unpaid" some of those volunteers are. For 
example, the maintainer of the Linux block layer, Jens Axboe, is paid by 
Oracle to maintain the Linux block layer. :) In any event, if you want 
the 2.6.25 kernel, you have to run Fedora 9, openSUSE 11, or some other 
distro in unstable/testing mode.

Me too. In particular, the performance metric collection is better in 
2.6.25 than it was in 2.6.24. But some distros are easier to maintain on 
the edge than Fedora. Gentoo is the one I use, but Debian testing or 
unstable are also easier to work with than Fedora or openSUSE if you 
want cutting edge software.

The point is that you *can* run Debian and Gentoo in "stable" mode. I 
don't think you can do that with the "latest" Fedora or openSUSE or Ubuntu.

RHEL and SLES are not free as in beer. CentOS or Debian stable are 
better choices for folks with limited budgets.

Granted, I'm running 1.0.4, which is buggy.  Before updates,
I played through the whole shareware version without slow downs.
After letting Fedora do it's updating, I get random slow downs.
I am also noticing random loss of music.  CentOS 5 even updated
has never exhibited these problems, then again it isn't using the
2.6.25 kernel.  Sound seems to die on Fedora Core 9.  Why does
stuff that worked in the past not work right now?

I thought Fedora Core 9 would be cutting edge and current and more
appealing as a Windows replacement than CentOS 5, but now I'm not
so sure.  I don't have a stable system to build on.  I can't rule
out flaky hardware.  I have freedos 1 installed if there are
hardware validation programs that run on it.  I am using an Intel
D845PEBT2 motherboard.

Message-ID: <1216066618.6654.14.camel@rotwang>

There will be a GPG keysigning party at OSCON Monday July 21st at 7pm.  

And I am running it!

The room is yet unknown.  I should find out sometime later this week.

I will post more information a bit later today.

Subject: [PLUG] Lost about this Cron job and where is it
Message-ID: <4a0b36aa0807141453v739211dbl3c4ad17389032c5e@mail.gmail.com>

Hello:

I am a little lost about this cron job (and feeling pretty stupid too).  I
am running Ubuntu and
up until a month ago, I started getting this cron job that kept doing some
sendmail checks like 200 times a day and sending email to my mailbox.
I checked under /var/spool/cron/crontabs and there is nothing there
(directory is empty).  I checked crontab of root and my user account and it
is emptied.
If I shutdown cron daemon, the cron job stops.  But if I cannot find any
crontab entry, I do not
understand where this one is coming from.

Any clue much appreciated.....

Well a good start would be to uninstall sendmail.

;-)


But seriously, have you checked /etc/crontab and these directories?

cron.d
cron.daily
cron.hourly
cron.monthly
cron.weekly

You could also look at your log files (/var/log/messages, /var/log/cron.d,
etc). They might give you a hint as to where the cron job is coming from.

Though it probably is in one of the cron.* directories.

Back in the previous century I found that it was better sometimes to go to
the country where people were sleeping than it was to go to the closest
site.  Full ftp sites, no matter how close, are not very useful.

Well, I tried it on a vmware installation of freedos and it uninstalled
the packages it said it was updating instead of updating them.  The
algorithm should be:

     download

     verify download

     update

Where update might be uninstall old followed by install new.

If you can't get past steps 1 and 2, don't update.

Did all the updates for Fedora, Office 
looks fine now during installation.  Hmm, 
maybe one of the bugs in the stock Fedora 
9 packages was to blame.  So after the 
fact, how do I set up my own Fedora 
repository built from the packages I have 
updated my system with?

I couldn't get Microsoft Office to install as 
Microsoft Office strangely enough.  I got it to 
install as unsupported software, but now it 
wants to be activated and there's no Internet 
access for some reason.  How does one give a 
bottle Internet access?  Internet Explorer has 
Internet access, it installed with Quicken 2006.  
What functionality do I lose anyways if I 
don't activate MS Word/Excel/Powerpoint 2003?
I could see taking Internet access away once
the program is activated.

I think the program will no longer run after the 30-day initial period.
But all you need is the activation key, and you can get that by phone.

If you get a pass to the exhibit halls (which is free) you can get into
the BoF sessions.

Message-ID: <2e42bd9b0807151139t256a1dfbnd6a0430ea24bec7c@mail.gmail.com>

Assuming everybody's heard about the impending DNS doom by now:
http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113

Looking over our own systems, I found a tool to check the source port
randomization of your DNS resolver:
https://www.dns-oarc.net/oarc/services/porttest

Basically:
dig +short porttest.dns-oarc.net TXT
z.y.x.w.v.u.t.s.r.q.p.o.n.m.l.k.j.i.h.g.f.e.d.c.b.a.pt.dns-oarc.net.
"<your nameserver ip> is GOOD: 26 queries in 0.5 seconds from 26 ports
with std dev 19481.67"

Some of our nameservers had explicitly set the source port in
named.conf w/ "query-source address * port 53;" so these were not
randomizing the source-port even after updating BIND. Commented those
out, of course. Probably worth checking your DNS servers even if
you've applied your distro's updates.

Also make sure that your distro did not walk over your named.conf file.
CentOS did this to me.  Look for named.conf.rpmsave for the backed up
copy.

Message-ID: <1216159612.1393.16.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I have installed:

MS Office 2003
Internet Explorer 6
Quicken 2006

to Fedora Core 9.

I couldn't get:

Family Tree 2008
Wordperfect Suite 8

to work.

It seems that 
anything that 
requires .NET 
doesn't work.

So, can Gramps read files 
created by Family Tree 
Maker?  How hard is it
to port data from FTM 
to Gramps?

I wonder how far I can get
with a copy of Windows 2000
running in Virtualbox or
Vmware Player?  I think
ancestry.com's anti Linux
mentality stinks.  Why do
so many companies like 
ancestry.com and garmin 
refuse to release Linux 
versions of their popular 
software?  They don't have 
to give the software away 
to make a Linux version, 
look at Dirk Dashing Secret 
Agent.  I guess the other
question is, why doesn't
someone come along and crush
these companies by supporting
Linux?

I think it is interesting that
the lead developer of crossover
sites piracy of Windows as a major
barrier to adoption of Linux as a
desktop system.  I for one hope
that recreating Windows isn't the
ultimate solution that wins out
in the end.  Linux is under 
appreciated compared to Windows.
Companies could write software
for Linux and even license it.

You'll probably have to install .Net in a bottle (my terminology may
be way off...) or, as James asked -- you *might* be able to just run
the app with mono. (mono <somefile.exe>)

In the meantime, I've installed Gramps which looks like it will

substitute for Family Tree 2008 and it is free.  I don't know 
if my dad's numerous Gedcom files will import, but that's another
matter.  I for one think that open source genealogy software 
makes a lot of sense.  Why trust family data and vital statistics 
to something that is closed where the platform it runs on is also 
closed and losing support?  My dad is complaining that Gramps 
looks stripped down compared to Family Tree.  Stripped down???
Is Gramps the only open source genealogy software worth looking
into?  Has anyone migrated from Family Tree to Gramps that can
vouch for it?

I made the transition but it was from Family Tree 5.0 which was released 
in the win95 days so that needs to be taken into consideration. The 
gedcom files transferred over with very little issue. Compared to Family 
Tree 5.0, Gramps is quite an advanced program that works very well. It 
is also the only open source genealogy program I've ever found. If there 
is another one I'd like to know myself because I'm occasionally asked 
about free genealogy programs for use on windows based systems and 
gramps of course doesn't work on windows. Sure the people asking me are 
asking for free (beer) software but I like to refer people to a free 
(speech) software if I can as a way to introduce the concept and 
capabilities of open source software.

Well, not free speech but free from cost; use familysearch.org as the

If you want a web-based project check out PhpGedView (
http://phpgedview.sf.net). I've been using it for years personally and it
has worked well. Being web-based it makes collaboration with family and
friends easier.

I can make video clips in .mp4 format with VLC in Linux and upload them to Youtube. When I do so, however, the image looks somewhat blurred:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKRSjlTdraE

However, when Windows Movie Maker is used to make video clips, and they are uploaded in .wmv format, they look as they should. If anyone has used Linux applications to make Youtube videos, with satisfactory results, I would appreciate some advice. I like VLC, so if it can be used for that purpose, I might as well stay with it.

Given the prevalence of cheap hosting and cheap or free live video streaming,
is cable access even relevant any more?

I mean, if you want content delivered on a regular basis about FLOSS,
subscribe to my FLOSS Weekly podcast (twit.tv/floss), and there are a dozen
Linux podcasts as well.

If you want to create a video stream, you can push HD content for free to
vimeo.com (500mb per week!), or go live with mogulus.com or stickam.com or
ustream.com or video.yahoo.com, etc etc.  If you want a phone-in talk show
that later becomes a podcast, talkshoe.com is also free.

I say this as a heavy cable access producer back in the early 90s.  I was
chairman of the advisory board of TVTV, and could find my name in credits
about 15 times a week.

But new media has taken over.  With the advent of live free video streaming
and cheap downloads and hosting, and inexpensive audio and video capture
hardware and editing software, cable access is now a dinosaur.

Not to mention how many people now have satellite tv and cannot get public
access at all.

The public access channel mentioned doe do streaming, but I am willing to
bet few, if anyone, in the Portland are even knows that.

Hey Randal,

    I agree with you on two points.  1) Lots of new media outlets/inlets
2) Cable access is less relevant.  I guess I would suggest that it
still brings some value to the community.  For example, the media
education programs.

    Ten years ago, the local Cable Access was focused on technical
enablement; How to use cameras, and sound equipment, etc.  Now the
technical barrier to entry has dropped so low, that kind of focus does
not make sense.  Thats why you see classes on story-telling and
framing the message.  Cable Access is still enabling, they are just
moving up the value chain.

    Also, as hard as it is to believe, some people still watch TV, on the
TV, so new media outlets are missing that audience.

In fact, there's absolutely no reason that the PLUG meetings (regular and
advanced) can't be audiocast live on talkshoe.com, and turned into a podcast
for later listening.  That would be a great idea, and require only a laptop
with a net connection be present at each meeting that could run the Java
application that captures and upstreams the audio.

Well, sure, but you asked about Linux and open-source people, and I'm sure
they're far more likely now to be watching MythTV and podcasts than the
average audience.

Put it this way: if there was a Cable Access show on FLOSS, I'd have to TiVo
it anyway. :)

Check TVCTV (Beaverton) I think they had one last year.

I could probably find someone to get something going at PCMTV, if 
there is interest in the open source community.

Or give them a call and chat with them about the idea. 503-288-1515

There is also Mt Hood community TV in Gresham.

Thanks

I also would love to be able to listen in on the meetings as well
considering the drive (from The Dalles) is prohibitive on Thursday nights.

Well, so far I've got several offers to help produce a Linux/FOSS show, 
but no existing show has shown up.  Maybe we PLUG members all have faces 
made for Radio/Audio Podcasts? :)  If anyone comes across, or produces 
Linux/FOSS media, I would be happy to dub-and-submit it to Portland 
Community Media;  http://www.pcmtv.org for Cable Broadcast.  Maybe 
something from OSCON next week? 

I've recorded a few PLUG meetings for broadcast over the years.   From 
my experience, the challenge was getting the audio on mic, and audible 
for playback.  While capturing the presenter is straightforward, getting 
the comments, and dialog from the rest of the group was tough.  Does 
anyone have some basic recording gear (mics, mixer and maybe a mic 
stand)?  Bring it to the next regular or advanced topics meeting and 
give it a try!

I've had pretty good results with the Zoom H2 portable audio recorder (about
$180 from amazon) as a field recorder, using the stereo recording in
front/back mode to get a 360 degree coverage.  It has a fairly usable
auto-gain mode that will "gain up" when the audience is asking a question, and
"gain down" when the speaker is speaking.

The Zoom H2 can also work "live" on a USB (even being powered by the USB), so
it works well as a desk or voice-over mike, or even as the pickup mike for a
live stream.

I'm in town for the Aug 7 PLUG meeting.  I'll bring my gear (laptop and H2),
and we can try a live feed.  I've just confirmed that talkshoe.com can
broadcast and record a show that is greater than two hours.  Before Aug 7,
remote listeners should visit talkshoe.com and make sure your particular setup
is compatible.  Since feeds can have only one owner (sadly), I'll create a
PLUG "owner" which we can pass around when different people are mastering it.

As a cool part, the talkshoe listeners have a chat room, which we can use to
pass questions on to the speaker.  In fact, I might even be able to pull the
audio out into the room, but that may feedback badly.

*After* the meeting is over, the recording will go into a podcast feed (RSS
with embedded media) on talkshoe.com, which we can then publish as part of the
official PLUG archive.  The *chat* will not be recorded, however.  Sorry.

In parallel, if I have enough bandwidth (and screenspace, and stamina), I
might also be able to link up a video that would go live out on stickam or
live.yahoo.com.  Again, that may or may not be recorded and/or archived, but
if it is archived, I can host it up on vimeo.com in a PLUG group that anyone
else can also contribute to.

Zoom's have a nice reputation among musicians too.  If you want to buy local
Portland Music Company has the H2 for $199.95 and the H4 for $100 more.

Message-ID: <48811755.8020404@dslnorthwest.net>

Now that my sound is working fine when it is working, I have a possibly related 
problem or problems.

I occasionally get a CMOS checksum error. I replaced the battery but it did not 
stop the errors.

Occasionally the date/time comes up screwy-2009, 2010.

Occasionally upon boot the system comes up with the sound not working.  On these 
occasions, amixer -c 0 info yields:

Card hw:0 'V8233'/'VIA 8233 with ALC200,200P at 0xb800, irq 11'
   Mixer name    : 'Realtek ALC200,200P rev 0'
   Components    : 'AC97a:414c4710'
   Controls      : 44
   Simple ctrls  : 30

When sound is working, amixer -c 0 info yields:

Card hw:0 'Audigy2'/'Audigy 2 Value [SB0400] (rev.0, serial:0x10011102) at 
0xa400, irq 5'
   Mixer name    : 'SigmaTel STAC9750,51'
   Components    : 'AC97a:83847650'
   Controls      : 200
   Simple ctrls  : 35

(The VIA is the on-board sound; the Audigy is a PCI card.)

When the former occurs, only a power down and boot fixes it.  Log off/log on, or 
  restart does not.

I cannot correlate these three random troubles.

I guess the first question should be what can cause the CMOS checksum error if 
it is not the battery?  Maybe fixing this will fix the other problems.

Any ideas would be appreciated.

If that is not the problem, you may have a dying motherboard.

A single mic will not work in JAX due to being too noisy. I got good 
results with one mic on the presenter and a second mic that I walked 
over to and pointed at the questioner.

Unfortunately a mic mixer really won't be much help without an 
operator due to the need to kill the inactive mice to lower room noise.

A mic at each table (or maybe every 2nd table), with a person doing 
the mixing would also work.

In rooms like those at PSU, I have had good results using the tie 
clip mic on the presenter to also pick up the questions - you just 
have to turn up the sound a lot.

The video of Wed night is done - how do you want it? It might be 
easiest for me to post on my server as a DVD an let you pick it up 
and convert to whatever. It is currently in the native DV camera 
format (AVI) at about 18 gig.

Thanks
JK

FWIW, there are memtest86 (and memtest86+) packages in debian which will 
automatically add a grub menu item for you.  Just install it, then 
reboot and select the memtest item from the grub menu.

I've been using an iriver (IFP899) mp3 player to record the Perl Mongers 
meetings for at least a year now.  It is just an area mic, so it 
suffers from table kicking, squeaky chairs, and fan noise (setting it 
next to the projector or a hot laptop will completely ruin the 
podcast), but it seems to pickup voices pretty well.

  http://pdxpm.podasp.com/archive.html?pname=meetings.xml

Selena's "2008-04-16 -- PostgreSQL Monitoring" talk (on the above page) 
was recorded with this at Jax.  There is background noise, but if you 
make a nicer podcast, fewer people will come to the meeting and then 
there wouldn't be background noise anyway because Jax would be closed, 
right?

Does anyone have a good evaluation of memtest86 as a stress test? 
It seems like memtest86 subjects the system to a high but steady
load, and there are a lot of failures that don't show up unless
the system is thrashing.  Denis is running rsync/dirvish, and
that is a more realistic stress test.  Denis, does the system
ever fail during backups?

As Alan suggests, memory does wear out - or more precisely,
individual bits drift from "marginal good" to "marginal bad". 
While I would expect a different set of errors than CMOS and
clock errors,  I will bow to his experience here.  At least
bad memory is easier to replace than a whole motherboard, and
it is best to check hardware in "frequency of failure" and
"ease of replacement" order. 


I have seen marginal behavior when a fan goes out.  Sometimes
it is merely a matter of adding or replacing fans;  a cooler
machine almost always runs better than a hot one. 

A common failure mode in older motherboards is the electrolytic
capacitors drying out.  The manufacturers save often save a few
pennies by using fewer and cheaper capacitors than the "Intel
reference design" specifies.  The motherboard still works, for
a while, but drops below minimum margins faster.  There are a
lot of places to shave pennies at the expense of longevity, and
unless your machine is from a high-end manufacturer, one or the
other of these shortcuts may eventually lead to flakiness, and
then failure.   

In the newest, fastest machines, the processors are running so
much current that it degrades the power supply pins on the
processor socket, slowly increasing resistance and inductance
until the internal power spikes cause failures when the processor
"gear shifts" from fast to slow or back.

Sadly, there is no place to go to find good engineering evaluations
of these products.  There are also no good hardware tools to
accurately diagnose and repair items like PC motherboards.  I would
love to have a PCI board that monitors the bus, looking for voltage
spikes and noisy waveforms and other trouble sources.  Of course,
what it would probably end up telling you is that everything is
marginal crap.  Sigh.

Pardon me if I am missing the obvious, but I have the package memtest86+ 
installed, but the only executable I can find is make-memtest86+-boot-floppy, 
and that says it needs mtools.  mtools seems to relate to dealing with DOS 
files, so I question whether this is pointing in the correct direction.  The 
comments in Adept about memtest86+ say there is a script to get the GRUB entry 
established, but how do I find the script?  Incidentally, the Adept comment 
entry for memtest86+ was wrong--it referred to some dictionary.  I fetched 
updates and that fixed that.  But to be sure I uninstalled and reinstalled 
memtest86+.  Still I am unable to find what is needed to get this test going.

Never mind.  memtest86 is in the grub menu.  I am off to run it for an extended

I appreciate the sad state that capitalism has brought the high-tech industry, 
but what might be the best course of action now that my system passed the memory 
tests? (3 passes w/76k reserved memory, 2 passes w/0 reserved memory.)  I can 
run the memory test overnight,  What else?  Remove and reseat connectors? 
Replace the power supply?  If replacing the MB moves to the top of the list, 
what choices should I consider? (Presently I have 1.5G Pentium 4.  Performance 
is satisfactory.)

I think the easiest thing would be to load dia, make a sample diagram  
with one of every gizmo you've got on your network, then save it as an  
XML file. Then you can "just" open it up in an XML editor and cut and  
paste away.

If this is *your* network, you might be able to find some "network  
discovery" tools that would automate a bit more of the process. But if  
you're actually looking to code something, you'd probably find it  
easier to use dia to get you started.

Dia is scriptable, but I don't remember what the scripting language  
is. It's either Python or Guile, which is a Scheme dialect.

It is related to PCI, so perhaps check the startup messages for 
something to that effect and also run `lspci` when you're in a state 
of "sound card missing".

If that is your only pci card, finding something (spare NIC?) to plug-in 
next to it would help you determine whether you're suffering a bad 
connection at the card or a problem with pci on the motherboard.  (If 
you have two pci cards plugged in and lspci shows one but not the sound 
card, that points at the sound card (or at least that slot on the MB.))

I don't know what the output of lspci would look like if the pci bus 
were MIA.

So, you'll need to try to reliably replicate the "missing sound card"  
state - does reboot vs power cycle vs cold boot make a difference?  If 
it is too frustrating to replicate, replacing the motherboard and/or 
sound card might be more fun.

Graphviz (aka dot).

  digraph "my network" {
    node1 -> switch1;
    node2 -> switch1;
    switch1 -> switch2;
    node3 -> switch2;
    node4 -> switch2;
  }

It then does the node layout automatically.  You can group things with a 
subgraph{} and influence the placement by ordering or add explicit 
placement by coordinates.

It may not be well-suited to creating small tidy diagrams, but it works 
great for mapping large quantities of connections.

Well, I would not characterize the problem as the "missing sound card".  lspci 
returns identical results, whether the system comes up using either:

00:00.0 Host bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8753 [P4X266 AGP] (rev 01)

Also, lshw shows Audigy to be #0, regardless of the sound state:
*-multimedia:0
              description: Multimedia audio controller
              product: SB0400 Audigy2 Value

              physical id: 8
              bus info: pci at 0000:00:08.0

              clock: 33MHz
              capabilities: pm bus_master cap_list
              configuration: driver=EMU10K1_Audigy latency=32 maxlatency=20 
mingnt=2 module=snd_emu10k1

and the on-board sound #1:

*-multimedia:1
              description: Multimedia audio controller
              product: VT8233/A/8235/8237 AC97 Audio Controller

              physical id: 11.5
              bus info: pci at 0000:00:11.5
              version: 30

              capabilities: pm cap_list
              configuration: driver=VIA 82xx Audio latency=0 module=snd_via82xx

But when the system comes up with the on-board sound, amixer thinks the VIA is #0:

amixer -c 0 info
Card hw:0 'V8233'/'VIA 8233 with ALC200,200P at 0xb800, irq 11'
   Mixer name    : 'Realtek ALC200,200P rev 0'
   Components    : 'AC97a:414c4710'
   Controls      : 44
   Simple ctrls  : 30

I cannot reliably cause the failure, but it occurs about 50% of the time. 
However, if in the failed mode, only a power off reboot seems to change the state.

Does any of this help?

-Denis

Here is my search.  I haven't used either but both show the resulting

Subject: [PLUG] DNS weirdness
Message-ID: <20080720023841.GA1446@gate.kl-ic.com>


A friend runs dwstudios.net, hosted on hostica.com.  I am having
problems accessing either URL from my RHEL5 network.  I can ping the
IP addresses, but DNS is not finding them.  "dig" responds with
    ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached

I can find the machines by URL with an outside SUSE machine, and
an outside Fedora9 machine, and can get details with "dig" (the
sites are their own AUTHORITY, unusual!)  so the problem is
apparently my own funky DNS setup interacting with their name
service.  I haven't seen any problems with other sites.

I can reach the machines if I hard code the URL and  IP address
into /etc/hosts , but that is a test, not a permanent fix.  Ugly!

I have BIND 9 set up on my nameserver (running on the firewall), 
the usual Redhat named version, running chrooted.  With named
running, I am not using outside name servers, just the root
authorities (?) and my own cache.  I think.  I set it up years
ago, with an occasional tweak, and mostly forgot what I did.
BIND is much more complicated than the 3 brain cells I've
allocated to run it.

To see what is going on, I set up /etc/sysconfig/named to run
named with a "-d 6" in the command line - no debug messages anywhere
I can detect.  I also added a stanza to logging in /etc/named.conf,
set to "severity dynamic".   named finds the log file mentioned,
but puts nothing in it. 

Plainly, I don't know what I am doing, but it would be nice to look
at some error messages somewhere and get a glimmer of a clue. 

So Question 2 (which I have probably not given you enough information
to answer) is "what is wrong with my DNS"?

Question 1, which perhaps somebody can answer, is "how do I set up
named (running chroot) to give me enough debug information to answer
question 2"?

I have a PCI sound card I am not using. I gave $10 or less for it at
Free Geek, so I'd be happy to let you have it if it will solve your
problem. On the back it says:

Creative Labs Model Number CT4830

Plus a serial number that's long enough they could make several sound
cards for everyone on the planet and not run out of numbers. On the
front it says it is a Sound Blaster Live! We all know that if the
product has an exclamation point in its name it is top of the line.

I've stuck it in my Clinic Box so I'll have it with me tomorrow.

I haven't been tracking it well enough to be sure if this might have
anything to do with it, but there was a major update to DNS in the
last few weeks.  As in every vendor from bind, to Microsoft released a
new version of their DNS server on the same day.

Hmm.  Can you use the pci card in this state if you tell e.g. aplay or 
xmms which card to use?

If so, it seems like one is just getting found first.  Perhaps you can 
use your bios settings to disable the onboard sound or somehow 
configure udev or alsa to address the card in some way besides "first 
one found".

Every other boot or a random 50%?  Useless homework exercise:  If you 
flip a coin to decide where to plug in the speakers at each boot, what 
is the probability that you'll get the right sound card? ;-)

Sometimes it seems like less than every other boot, since if the VIA comes up, 
powering off and restarting causes it to come up with Audigy, except that is not 
always the case.

For a math class the answer is 50%.  In my world it would be closer to 0%.

I will try the BIOS.

I'm particularly interested in something that labels interfaces with
CIDR notation, and yeah, I'm looking for small tidy diagrams (at least
in cases of small tidy-ish networks).  I am familiar with graphviz,
and I'd be fine with something it generated so long as I can get
decent labelling on the interfaces.

Larry's netmap seems to be a traceroute-driven thing.  I can supply
the network interface information, I just want something to draw the
tidy graphs with labelling.  The other one Larry pointed at looks not
like what I'm looking for.

Thanks for the input.

You don't mention when this problem started.
Is this the only domain you cannot resolve internally?

Have you checked your firewall logs?

The recent DNS systems patch flurry was to ensure source port randomization. 

Side issue:
Has your package management system upgraded your bind installation?  Fedora, 
CentOS and derivatives had a problem with the named.conf being replaced with 
a stock version.  Easy to fix with the original being saved as 
named.conf.rpmsave

Zenoss (www.zenoss.org) is the tool you want, auto-discovery plus 
configurable devices, plus I think it will import configs (not sure 
about that). As long as you have the snmp read community string, you 
should be able to just map the whole thing. This is a full blow network 
monitoring and management tool.

Done. 7 boots, 7 successful. Looks like the problem was the random order in 
which the sound systems were being found.

I guess this problem was created by the CMOS errors.  When restoring the BIOS I 
was not aware of the settings with regard to the sound.

So the question remains: Why is the CMOS checksum failing occasionally?  How do 
I investigate that? (The last failure was on the 17th--18 boots ago.)

The label can be whatever you want (though you may have to use an 
explicit label instead of the implicit label derived from the node 
name.)  If you use the 'record' node type, you can even have something 
like:

  -------------------------------
  |          platypus           |
  -------------------------------
  | 192.168.0.10 | 192.168.0.11 |
  -------------------------------

Where connections can point to any of the three parts of that node.

  platypus [
   label="{<_>platypus|{{<ip1>192.168.0.10}|{<ip2>192.168.0.11}}}",
   shape=record
  ];
  foo -> platypus;
  platypus:ip1 -> bar;
  platypus:ip2 -> baz;

Assuming this is what you meant anyway...  If you meant something else, 
the answer is maybe different, but probably still yes WRT graphviz.

Message-ID: <1216587035.5626.42.camel@DreamScape>

It has been quite an interesting few hours. Some time on Friday, I
discovered that my emails weren't going anywhere. After discovering
yesterday that I could send from my SpamCop webmail account, I went to
the Comcast web site. I tried sending some emails from there, and that
didn't work either.

So I got the Comcast Live Chat person. He checked a few things, but he
couldn't figure out what was happening either. He asked me to try
changing my password, then told me that the server was down. So ...
still no luck.

Today after a couple of hours, I figured out what the problem was. My
signature had two links in it. By a process of elimination, it became
apparent that Comcast was blocking all the emails that had my blog link
in the signature. I haven't tried it with the link in the text of the
emails yet. In any event, if you are reading this email, I have
succeeded.

So ... Comcast blocks some links but not others? How did my blog get on
a blacklist? Why isn't it smart enough to recognize a link without
"http://" in it?

Oh, yeah ... more Comcast goodies ... if you try to access their site
with Seamonkey, it tells you it's time you upgraded your browser. ;)

Teenbuntu: Reaching Out to Teens
Andrew Harris (Teens on Linux.org)
4:30pm Thursday, 07/24/2008
People, Ubuntu
Location: D135

This talk is given by Andrew "Tuna" Harris, the teenaged founder of
TeensOnLinux.org, and Samuel Baldwin, a 15-year-old hacker from
Boston. It will focus on three main points: why we should get teens
involved in open source, getting them interested, and making freedom
in software matter to them.

Teens are a great market for open source. They love community and the
"breaking away from the Man" sort of feeling, so they are quick to
adopt alternatives to what everyone else uses (take that society!). As
students, they usually aren't too busy to find some time to contribute
something. It is also the age of learning and exploration of new
ideas. Getting involved in Ubuntu and FOSS is a great way to learn
something new.

Many people say that Linux is a horrible platform for gaming, and for
that reason, nobody but old Unix hackers with chest-length beards ever
use it. However, with the development of tools like Wine and
CrossOver, along with awesome games like Tremulous and OpenArena, that
is becoming less and less true. Benchmark tests have shown that many
games, such as World of Warcraft, actually run better on Linux using
Wine than it does on Windows.

Teens also use Windows for things like instant messaging and music.
Pidgin and Mugshot's desktop integration make Ubuntu the ultimate OS
for such purposes. Pidgin has become probably the best instant
messaging client freely available on the Internet, with support for
more protocols than any one person would ever use in their entire
life. Users of Yahoo!, AIM, and even MSN will feel right at home with
Pidgin. Amarok and Rythmbox both have Magnatune integration that is
comparable to Apple's iTunes music store. You can listen to the songs
directly from the player and buy albums just as you would with iTunes
or Napster. The difference is that the music is DRM-free and licensed
so that you are allowed to share the music you buy with a friend!

I believe that teens could be a great and welcome addition to the
Ubuntu community. Their ideas could push us into the mainstream and
beyond.

Yeah, but then you have to go with either IE, or Safari. I like Safari 
as an alternative to IE when in Windows, but consider neither an upgrade 
to the open source solutions.

Uh, but I don't care about auto-discovery.  The devices are mostly
random, without configured snmp or anything.  I supposed it would be
nice if I got auto-discovery for free, but if I have to work for it,
then it's probably more trouble than it's worth in my use case.

If that does what you'd think it does, then that sounds very

Check us out:

We are so cool!

You can sign up for a free pass to the Expo Hall here:

http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/content/expo-hall

Expo Hall Hours:

    * Wednesday, July 23: 10:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m
      6:00 - 7:30 p.m. (reception)
    * Thursday, July 24: 10:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.

I am the official PLUG booth person, but it sure would be great if I
had some help. If anyone is going to OSCON and can help for even an
hour or two, let me know. I'll have PLUG flyers, business cards and
display stuff for the booth, so you don't have to do anything except
sit there and look pretty. OK, pretty is optional. Just sit there while
I go get some lunch and stuff and answer questions from the public
about PLUG.

   I'm using OO.o-2.4 and it does not recognize a Microsoft Wurd
XML-formatted document. Don't know if this is the hokey OOXML (ahem!)
"standard" or something else.

   Has anyone seen one of these and successfully opened it for reading?

Yes, using Ubuntu 7.10 and 8.04.  The document had to end in .docx.
Then I could double-click on it and OOo (both 2.3 and 2.4) would open
it.  However, I suspect it is not a feature of OOo, but rather of
Ubuntu. I tried opening the same .docx file with OOo 2.4 on Windows
without any luck.  I haven't dug deep enough to figure out what magic
Ubuntu is doing.

I've used this methodology with success (on ubuntu, where my
openoffice did not automagically do the right thing):

http://www.oooninja.com/2008/01/convert-openxml-docx-etc-in-linux-using.html

looks like it'd work anywhere.

Robert,

   How interesting. On Slackware-11.0 it doesn't matter if the suffix is .doc
or .docx, it isn't recognized by OO.o-2.4. PITA.

Thanks,

Rich

   Thank you, Chris. So this is the new OOXML that Microsoft rammed through
as an ISO "standard" then dropped because they couldn't make it work,
either. Well, I'll have to find those files and make them work with
Slackware.

Looks like Ubuntu comes with Novell's OOXML translator included. Slackware
apparently doesn't.

I have tried to get this translator to work on Windows without success.

wes,

   Slackware comes with rpm2cpio and cpio (of course). I downloaded the
odf-converter*.rpm, followed the rest of the instructions and now have
OdfConverter residing in /usr/bin. It worked on the document I was sent.

Thanks,

Rich

Getting a translator to work with OOo on Windows would be nice,
especially as a portable app.

   But, wait! This is the format that Microsoft insisted was their future (at
the time). Don't they provide a mechanism for those not running
Vista/Office07 to view and work with those files? What a surprise!

Upon further inspection, this thing:

http://katana.oooninja.com/w/odf-converter-integrator

appears to have been created for the express purpose of making Novell's
converter thingy actually *work*. I bet Novell or MS never imagined someone
would do that...

Oh, but they did. They provided all the specs to their open source
"partners" (Novell), who created a converter. The converter works great...
on specific versions of OOo on specific distros. Ubuntu found some way to
hack it in, so their users benefit too.

The OOo Ninjas I linked to in my other post appear to have found a way to
make it work for everyone. I haven't tested it on Windows yet, but they
do specifically claim that it works.

   This is another reason why open source will take over for most
applications. Very niche-specific apps probably will remain proprietary, but
that's a tiny fraction of the market place.

One can only hope. M$ is still going to do everything they can to prevent
this. Hence the "partnerships" with Novell, etc...

Message-ID: <185107.43367.qm@web50604.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

I decided to install the lm_sensors program on my OpenSuSE 10.3 installation, which uses an A8V (amd64) mobo. I'm not sure what all this means, or whether it's reliable, but it concerns me a little:

temp1:       +40?C  (high =   +32?C, hyst =   +22?C)   sensor = thermistor   ALARM
temp2:     +66.5?C  (high =   +80?C, hyst =   +75?C)   sensor = thermistor      
alarms:   Chassis intrusion detection                      ALARM
beep_enable:
          Sound alarm enabled

Sometimes fans that are not 3-wire give a spurious reading of 0RPM. Other than that, 74C is pretty hot. I understand that sometimes this program gives spurious results with amd64 architecture, but should I be concerned with these results?

Thanks Wayne, Michael, Matt and Alan. I saw Keith last night and he

Looking for some help with using mdbtools.  I know that at least one of
you have used it because I see a post of yours on their souceforge site.
Rather than signing up for yet another mailing list, I thought I'd try
to get an answer here.

I just need to know how to set up ODBC.  An entry might need to go in
odbcinst.ini, and another entry must go into odbc.ini.  Can anyone
provide quick examples of these entries?

In the meantime, I'll peruse the source to see if there are any clues in
there.

Carlos,

   I'm probably that person. However, we did not get the contract for that
project and a need to translate Access files hasn't come up again. Ergo, I
cannot offer any help.

Yep, you were.

I've been messing with it more, and it seems that a lot of the tools act
directly on the .mdb file.  I may not need an ODBC config at all.  I'm
considering going the route of exporting the data into a text file dump, and
then importing it into a more usable database.  This seems to be quite doable
with the basic tools.

Earlier I would have said "only dwstudios and hostica".  However, today,
an email to Aaron Baer also choked, so add slyness.org (64.122.12.110)
to the trouble list.  I don't know when the problem started, but the
problem rate suggests it occured with the recent DNS changes.

Another change that occured in the last two months was the change
to Verizon FIOS and the addition of an Actiontec cable modem + 
router + etc.  That does a lot more than the old Linksys cable 
modem that I used for Comcast - among other things, it can act as a
firewall, and adds another layer of NAT - so it may be part of the
problem.

Note that a laptop connected directly to the Actiontec, using DHCP
and the Actiontec+Verizon as the domain name server, will resolve all
the problematic URLs.

MR> Have you checked your firewall logs?

I have most of the rules set to DROP, so not much gets logged.  However,
I can turn the firewall off (yikes!) and see the same problem.

MR> The recent DNS systems patch flurry was to ensure source port randomization. 

I couldn't find a simple explanation of source port randomization, in
operational terms.  How does that affect operation?

MR> Side issue:
MR> Has your package management system upgraded your bind installation?  Fedora, 
MR> CentOS and derivatives had a problem with the named.conf being replaced with

The package management system upgraded named, but not /etc/named.conf (which
actually simlinks to the chroot version of the file).

---

I just figured out that the named log files are now going into
/var/named/chroot/var/log/named/  ;  I wasn't seeing them at first,
but now I can see that all sorts of good stuff is getting logged.

So now I have a wealth of detail to learn from.  I think that (plus
the BIND documentation, which I will slog through)  will give me a
hint.  I have a 15yo O'Reilly book on Bind and DNS, which seems to
be uselessly obsolete, but the online stuff may yield some understanding.

This sounds suspiciously familiar.  I sometimes have sporadic dns

I've found that I can fix them by cycling power on my cable modem.
I'm not at home right now, so I can't be sure, but I think mine is
also an Actiontec.

It looks like you are using a 32 bit kernel.  Why are you not using a 64
bit OS?  It will solve your memory problems. I don't think programs can
address more than 3.5 gigs, so adding more is not going to work very
well until you upgrade to the correct binaries.

I googled around for a bit, and found, at
    http://www.broadbandreports.com/forum/remark,11430965


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To the list, don't forget to add the DNS 1.0.0.0 problem.

For me, oddly, it has only manifested with "www" hostnames. In other
words, I get 1.0.0.0 for "www.bob.com" but I get a good IP for
bob.com.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I used to have very frequent DNS 1.0.0.0 problems. For me at least,
the solution was to put the ISP DNS host IP addresses in the NIC IP
settings (static DNS) on the computer to which the Actiontec is
connected via ethernet. If the DNS info is left as dynamic, I am
guaranteed to see frequent 1.0.0.0 errors. Qwest DSL support was no
help in figuring this out. They had never heard of the 1.0.0.0
problem.

I am trying to avoid installing a 64 bit OS just because I have lots of
stuff installed and the shift  might cause problems of its own. I don't need
the full memory for one application. As I understand it the bigmem kernel
allows you to use 4GB-64GB with a 32 bit OS. Each process is limited to a
4GB address space, but separate processes can be assigned their own  4GB
space.

Have you check the BIOS?  Most of them have a limiter, to make sure
Winblows can still function with more than 3.5 Megs on board.

Okay, a disclaimer right off the bat.  I don't know squat about that
particular motherboard, so this is all speculation on my part.  Take
my advice with a grain of salt, or perhaps the entire salt cellar.  :-)

Are you sure you've got the right driver for that motherboard?  The
limits shown look really screwy.  If the power supply was actually
putting out what the limits imply, then your computer wouldn't work at
all. The actual readings don't look too far off, except maybe the
negative supply voltages.  Try rebooting, and checking to see what the
BIOS sees.  (Most of the BIOS programs that I've seen display the sensor
readings somewhere or another.)  That will tell you what the readings
really are.  Then you can compare with what lm-sensors is telling you.  

Okay, I've just googled lm-sensors av8 abit and found this page:
  <http://www.lm-sensors.org/wiki/Configurations/Abit/AV8>
It's an example configuration file for the AV8 mobo.  Maybe that will help?

I haven't used mdbtools in a while (a year or so?).  IIRC, you may
need to be careful with embedded end-of-line characters when you dump
to a text file.  Also, I have a vague memory of where clauses not
being honored.  That is, you can write "... where foo=10", but it will
simply ignore it.

But other than a few quirks which had some easy workarounds and may be
fixed by now, the mdbtools worked great for my needs.

Good luck and let us know how it works for you.

Carlos,

I recently needed to read an MS Access database file. Actually, all I
needed was one table. After much messing around I finally discovered
that Kexi can read MS Access database files. Since I wanted to get it
into open source format, I just let Kexi import it into its native
SQLite format. 

Eventually I discovered that Kexi and SQLite are not quite ready for
prime time. Too many features not yet implemented. So I connected
OpenOffice Base the the Kexi file. I thought that would solve the
problem of the missing features, but it turns out that OOo Base simply
reads the external data and uses the features of the external program.
If the external program cannot handle a particular query, then the same
query in OOo will fail as well. And when I say missing features I'm
talking some really basic stuff, like being able to append records to a
table.

In the end I moved it into OOo Base native format where I had no
problems with missing features. Unfortunately, that was not a perfect
solution either, as OOo Base is Java and the screen refresh is slower
than the second coming.

There is a kernel option that allows you to address to either 4GB or 64GB of
memory. You'll probably need to recompile the kernel or go 64 bit to support
that amount of memory.

In a huge stroke of luck, I discovered that my Access tables are all
actually "Linked ODBC" objects.  They are all database links to an
MSSQL 2000 server's tables.  So I'm off the hook for this go-around,
since it will be much better to deal with a real database that has a
network address and stuff.

There are quite a few Access databases floating around in my
department, all performing scarily critical tasks, so I'm still
interested in this suite of utilities.  Keep the tips coming!  I found
the various mdb-* commands to work as advertised.  The Linked ODBC
tables were not visible, however.  I guess it can only read the data
that is actually contained in the .mdb file.

I found this link which suggests there might be a problem with the
version of Grub that comes with Debian:

http://howtoforge.org/make-your-xen-pae-kernel-work-with-more-than-4gb-ram-debian-etch-grub

Using PAE your processes still only have 32-bit address spaces, so yes
you can only address 4GB for a single process.

Just a reminder.

O'Reilly's OSCON (OpenSource Conference) is in Portland at the Oregon
Convention Center this week.  See
http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/content/home for details.  The
best days of the conference are Wednesday and Thursday.  The
conference is expensive, but there are many fun free things for people
who can not afford the conference fees.  O'Reilly is very good
committed to Open Source and realize that many Open Source people have
limited resources.  As a result, O'Reilly let's everyone into the Expo
and the Birds of the Feather sessions and the OSCAMP room for free.
Also, there are many interesting conversations going on a the halls
and everyone can get to these.

Finally, PLUG has a booth in the Expo.  John Jason Jordan
<johnxj at comcast.net> is organizing this and I'm sure he could use some
help.  PLUG signed up for this booth, but people from other local Open
Source and Linux groups are welcome to share it and certainly welcome
to have us pass out your group's flyers.

Interesting pointer, but that does not seem to be my problem - I am
running my own domain server, not an outside one, and I am starting
with "hints" from the root name servers.  The problem is that some
of the DNS requests do not appear to get answered.

I found this:
   http://aplawrence.com/MacOSX/dns_puzzle.html

And that may be a fruitful path to explore.  The author says that
the Actiontec is truncating UDP packets longer than 512 bytes,
which can cause a fallback to TCP.  However, some DNS servers do
not support DNS queries on TCP.  More experimentation needed.
The author points at:

http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r17679150-Howto-make-ActionTec-MI424WR-a-network-bridge

Which is how to turn the Actiontec into a bridge.  Personally, I 
would rather get rid of the damned thing entirely and connect through
the CAT5 that I ran to the other side of the wall from the ONT.
That way I will not be burning power in it.

Alternately, I will learn how to configure named.conf so DNS
pulls name service from my offsite server for outside addresses.
Or something ...

Carlos,

   There's a mail list for mdb-tools. I'm apparently still subscribed, but
forget about it until I see the occasional message showing up here. I end up
deleting them and forgetting to unsubscribe.

   This mail list may be helpful if you need to do more with the utilities.

   You're kidding, right? You think that Adobe, Mozilla (think Firefox), and
Symbian (the market-leading open operating system for advanced data-enabled
smartphones) are corporate sponsors because SQLite is 'not quite ready for
prime time?'

   It doesn't come with a GUI; you need to either use the built-in shell or,
most commonly, embed it as the back end in an application. It's solid as a
rock; we use it in our approximate reasoning models.

I am running Ubuntu HH.

The desktop includes a trash / wastebasket application.
Problem is I dropped a directory in ther and it won't Empty.

I'd like to hit it with 'sudo' rmdir.

Where are trash files stored in Ubuntu?

Also, a command line question: I tried seaching for the directory name 
using ls -R but I found that '-R' didn't search recursively (doesn't 
'recursive' mean 'search all the subdirectories too?') I tested this on 
a file I knew was in /home/[...]/tmp/swapby searching from '/' and it 
didn't find it.

Any hints?

This is just for caching and/or local resolution, right?  My bind setup 
contains the following info about the world, and no root.hints 
directive.

        forward first;
        forwarders {
                192.168.1.1;
                192.168.0.2;
                68.238.128.12;
                68.238.64.12;
        };

That said, I may not have a clue what I'm doing.  My todo list says that 
I will eventually setup dnsmasq or something else which is simpler than 
bind.

In my experience, removing the ActionTec router from the equation is  
fully supported by Verizon. Just unplug it and connect whatever router  
you wish to use instead to the ethernet jack previously occupied by  
the ActionTec router.

When I've supervised their install teams in the past I've asked if  
their router is required, and the answer I got every time was no. On  
one occasion I said we don't want to use it, this Linux pc is going  
straight into the wall, and the technician said okay. He said they  
have to leave the router on site, just stick it in the closet or  
something.

Depends on the installer probably.  We just had it installed this past
weekend and the installer *insisted* on using the MoCA (coax)
connection instead of Ethernet.  He was very nice and professional and
did a great job installing everything, so I didn't argue too much (I
also didn't really care).  It works so far and had the added benefit
of using an existing coax cable and thus didn't involve any new holes
through my swiss cheese walls.

I haven't noticed any DNS weirdness yet, but I'll keep an eye on it.
The router definitely runs it's own DNS server, I suppose for caching
and to provide the ".home" name resolution locally:

Keith, I suppose you could disable the Actiontec DHCP server and run
one somewhere else, providing whatever DNS servers you want in the
leases.

Pardon me, I did not make myself clear. I meant that Kexi and *Kexi's
implementation of SQLite* are not ready for prime time.

It's been a while, but several standard queries were not yet
implemented in Kexi. It's possible that they could be done with SQLite
without the Kexi front end. 

I am not an SQL guru, hence I need a graphical front end.

When I go to Places > Home Folder I get a Nautilus window showing my
home folder. I have Nautilus set to show bookmarks to the left, but by
default it shows jjj, Desktop, File System, <any mounted devices>, and
Trash.

Re deleting and recursiveness, try a lowercase -r. In my experience
sometimes a command requires an uppercase -R and sometimes lowercase
-r.

~/.local/share/Trash/files on my machine, but I'm running Xubuntu. 
You should be able to find your trash directory the same way I did. 
Put a file with a unique name into the trash and then search for it 
using find.

touch Desktop/xyzzy.junk
drag xyzzy.junk into the trash
find ~ -name xyzzy.junk

-R is the correct option, but you probably want -a as well in order to 
get dot files.  As per the above, find is probably a better choice for 
what you are wanting to do.

   What's a 'standard query?' Just curious because I've not encountered such
a term. Would 'standard' be application-specific?

> I am not an SQL guru, hence I need a graphical front end.

   John, this is a common misconception that has led to all sorts of errors.
Some are insignificant, others (such as the engineers in the space program
not standardizing on a measurement system) much more expensive and
significant by any measure. Example: when Lotus-1,2,3 came out it had a menu
item for 'Variance' and another for 'Standard Deviation.' That's fine,
except the coders who wrote Lotus-1,2,3 were not statisticians and they used
the population formula rather than the sample formula. The latter asssumes
that you have measurements for every individual in the population. Rarely,
if ever in the real world, is that the case. Ergo, every answer was slightly
wrong. Knowing how to use the statistical functions of the spreadsheet did
not guarantee that they were used correctly.

   The analogy I've used for years when discussing this issue is that
teaching someone how to use a word processor does not make her a writer.

   In your situation, not knowing SQL means that you need to trust whoever
wrote the GUI front end to an application to really know what it is you want
or need as a result to a query. If the work you are doing is important, then
it behooves you to know what's going on behind the curtain. Only when we are
confident that we know what we're doing can we apply an automated tool.

The Fedora 9 package is built and a candidate for an update:

Doesn't look like it's in EPEL (for RHEL/CentOS/etc).

Again, let me rephrase. By "standard" I meant "ordinary" or "commonly
used." One example that I recall is that I was unable to append records
to a table. 

As for knowing what's going on behind the curtain, both Kexi and OOo
Base allow me to see the SQL code that the GUI generates. It just takes
a mouse click. Understanding the code is another matter. But I do
occasionally look at the code either because I want to learn SQL
(slowly, in my own way), or because something doesn't work as expected
and I am hoping that viewing the code will shed some light on the
matter. And in either program I can write code manually or manually
edit the code created by the GUI. 

When it comes to worrying about messing things up, I create backups
before trying something I'm not sure of. I also know tricks like
creating a delete query first as a select query. In all the years I
have used Paradox, Access and now OSS, I have yet to lose data due to
my lack of knowledge of what is going on behind the curtain.

Subject: [PLUG] Xfig Default Font
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0807231354560.9208@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I start xfig with the option '-startpsfont Palatino-Roman', but that
doesn't work. I get some funky typeface and need to explicitly select
Palatino-Roman for each chunk of text I enter.

   Can anyone tell me what I've incorrectly specified? Other startup options
(e.g., 10pt text) work OK.

   Ah, never mind. It took a couple of restarts to have the change take. It's
working fine now.

John,

I am planning on being there tomorrow (Thursday), but I have not registered for 
a free pass--they want tooooo much personal information.  If I cannot get in 
without all that I will go back home.

I don't know what they want for the Expo Hall pass, but I imagine it's
the same as the online process. They have people who take your
registration and issue you a tag to get through the front door of the
Expo Hall. It's free, but as far as I know you can't just walk in.

galen,

   Thank you. I went to that page, but missed the very top lines about
searching. Sigh.

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu and Cisco VPN client
Message-ID: <4a0b36aa0807232201ge1d27e1kd5cc433a186a7297@mail.gmail.com>

Hi:

I am trying to get the Cisco VPN client to connect up with my work's VPN
server so I can login from home.
I have the Window XP version and the Linux version.  On Window XP, it
connects just fine.
But when trying the Linux version on my Ubuntu box, I got this error every
time:

  Secure VPN Connection terminated locally by the Client
  Reason: Remote peer is no longer responding.
  There are no new notification messages at this time.

I am sure remote peer is responding so I can turn around and get in using
the Window version.
I google'ed online and most point to a firewall issue which I have flushed
out by "iptables -F".

I am not sure what I am doing wrong.  Any tips/pointers much appreciated!!

Thanks

-Vincent

funny, i had a much much easier time making the linux client connect
than the windows client.  the windows client was, in fact, unable to
connect, because our VPN server (also cisco) lacked any kind of modern
crypto license and the linux client could be forced back to the legacy
stuff but the windows one had no such knob to adjust.
for once i was happy that we were paying so much for a cisco support contract..

if you have a cisco vpn server and can enable/read the logging (i can
remember how to do this at the office tomorrow if you need) then i may
be able to offer some pointers.  the logging on the client was next to
useless, but the server log was obliquely informative, at least.

Sorry, I was unclear.  While I did run a CAT5 all the way to the
ONT, and asked the installer to use that, He Who Knows Better
Than The Customer decided to connect through the old Comcast
cable instead.  That is either policy, or his personal preference. 
Hence the only active ports on the ONT (for now) are the phone
and the cable coax, so I need a cable modem - for now.  Perhaps
I can ask Verizon to switch the wiring, but I did not see any
activity on the ONT CAT5 port the last time I checked.

While I like the "idea" of the Actiontec in some ways, I don't
like the extra power use, extra failure point, and most importantly
the somewhat botched implementation.

That worked, thanks!  I put it inside the "" view "internal" "" section,
replacing the "" zone "." IN "" section.   If a better alternative comes
along, let me know.  As I understand it, the Verizon name servers will
replace nonexistent URLs with some advertising cruft, but I can put
up with that.

I still want to yank out the Actiontec, but it is no longer first
priority.

sqlite's a great little RDBMS that is portable across Windows, Linux,
OS X, and Solaris.  But I have run into some quirks.  For example:

How do I drop a column?
How do I rename a column?
How do I change the column definition, e.g. text to integer?

I don't see anything obvious in the docs:

Robert,

   It's not possible now with the implementation of the ALTER TABLE command.
I believe that's on the to-do list of the developers.

   Usually by changing the data type in there. Take a look at
<http://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html>. Text values are quoted (single or
double) while integer values are not. If I had to make those changes I'd
dump the table and use a text editor to remove the quotation marks around
the values I wanted to change. Then, drop the original table and read the
revised one.

My current workaround is to create a new table reflecting the change
in a select statement, drop the old table, rename the new table, and
rebuild any indexes.

Is there an easier way?

Which is similar to my current workaround of creating a new column
with my desired datatype, transferring the data (i.e. update), and
then do the above steps to get rid of the old column.

Again, is there an easier way?

Robert,

   Not to my knowledge. Since tables should not need to be altered too often
I've not found this to be a major issue.

   Not as far as I know.

   Once the database schema is stablized and corrected these should not be
issues.

I am moving from an old RH9 system to Debian (etch).  All is well except 
when it comes to getting my trusty APC SmartUPS 1000 connected. 
Somewhere I must have a permissions or configuration problem:  when I 
run /sbin/upsdrvctl start, the driver seems to start up OK, but when I 
try to start all of nut via /etc/init.d/nut start I see:

  Broadcast Message from nut at SERVER2  (somewhere) at 8:13 ...
  Communications with UPS myups at localhost lost
  Broadcast Message from nut at SERVER2 (somewhere) at 8:13 ...
  UPS myups at localhost is unavailable

And, from syslog we see:

  stat /etc/nut/upsd.conf: Permission denied
  Startup successful
  UPS [myups at localhost]: connect failed:Connection failure: Connection 
refused
  Communications with UPS myups at localhost lost


I have spent last evening and this morning doing the usual (head 
scratching, coffee drinking, pondering, googl'ing) to no avail.

Does anyone have any ideas where I should look for this gremlin?

thanks,
frank

Message-ID: <4889FDB1.60009@gisnet.com>

I recently set up a machine with FC9 and I set it to boot in text mode 
(run level 3).

The problem I'm having is if I login from the local terminal, when I log 
out, the screen goes blank and I just see a single dash in the upper 
left corner and that terminal window is now hung. I can use the next one 
(Alt-F2) OK, but when I log out of that one, it hangs too.

Logging in via SSH works fine though.

Does anyone know what causes this and how I can fix it?

First ask yourself "is it necessary?"  SQLite does not enforce types.  You can
store a string or a blob in a INT column.

See http://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#affinity  for the background.

So the easy way is to stuff integers into your text columns.

I'm interested because I want to avoid simple errors.  For example:

$ sqlite3 tmp.db .dump
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE bar (foo text);
INSERT INTO "bar" VALUES('a');
INSERT INTO "bar" VALUES('b');
INSERT INTO "bar" VALUES('c');
INSERT INTO "bar" VALUES('8');
INSERT INTO "bar" VALUES('9');
INSERT INTO "bar" VALUES('10');
COMMIT;

$ sqlite3 tmp.db 'select foo from bar ;'
a
b
c
8
9
10

$ sqlite3 tmp.db 'delete from bar where foo in ("a","b","c") ;'

$ sqlite3 tmp.db 'select foo from bar ;'
8
9
10

$ sqlite3 tmp.db 'select foo from bar where foo > 7 ;'
8
9

$ sqlite3 tmp.db 'select foo from bar where +foo > 7 ;'
8
9
10

Now that the column contains only numbers, I would like the affinity
to be integer.  My current solution:

$ sqlite3 tmp.db '
create view vbar as select +foo as "foo" from bar ;
create table bar2 as select foo from vbar ;
drop table bar;
drop view vbar;
alter table bar2 rename to bar ;
'

$ sqlite3 tmp.db 'select foo from bar where foo > 7 ;'
8
9
10

$ sqlite3 tmp.db .dump
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE 'bar'(foo);
INSERT INTO "bar" VALUES('8');
INSERT INTO "bar" VALUES('9');
INSERT INTO "bar" VALUES('10');
COMMIT;

Perhaps the best solution is to not assign any affinity at the outset.

Regards,
- Robert

It was a blast!

Because of OSCON I got to hear Mark Shuttleworth in person, and because
of Keith I got a front row center seat.

I also got t-shirts, a free book on SQLite, and numerous other swag
things. 

I am still recovering from the open bar parties hosted by O'Reilly,
Google and Sourceforge.

I met tons of people involved in OSS, Linux and other stuff we hold
dear.

I printed 200 PLUG flyers and have a little over a hundred left, plus a
lot of people passing by our booth took just a PLUG business card. I am
confident this will result in new blood for PLUG. We even had visitors
from "PLUG" - that is, the Punai, India Linux User Group. They took
copies of our stuff to take back with them. We also answered a lot of
Clinic type questions, gave geographic directions to visitors from out
of town, and even suggested how to find a tech job in Portland to
several out of towners who fell in love with Portland during OSCON.

My heartfelt thanks to Dave for arranging the booth, and to Keith and
many others who helped man it!

For those of us who are still in town from out-of-town, is there

I bet this is a video driver problem, what is your video card and what

... to Hood River, watch for the wind surfers. 

The Full Sail brewery has a nice patio for lunch and a beer

Then on to Mt Hood and up to Timberline Lodge.

Then back to Portland.

Well worth the drive.

   Powell's Books (and the tech books store). And, depending how far out of
town, there's Multnomah Falls (the most visited site in Oregon), and Vista
House (on the old highway between Multnomah Falls and Troutdale). Also,
Pioneer Courthouse Square, Saturday Market, Kell's Irish Restaurant, the
Lucky Lab Brew Pub, ... and more. :-)

And, while I was only able to spend 15 minutes there, and those after
the exhibit hall closed yesterday, I was in time to meet in person Vik
Oliver of the RepRap project,
http://www.reprap.org/bin/view/Main/WebHome , a fellow from New Zealand
with whom I've had an e-mail correspondence since the late 90's.

RepRap takes the idea of Open Source to the hardware level. Much work
still to be done, but progress on self replicating hardware is being made.

If you visit http://blog.reprap.org/ and scroll down to the entries for
Tuesday of this week, you'll see how baggage handlers mangled the
machine. When I got to the gathering area across from Powell's tables in
the lobby, the machine was up and running, having just completed a small
part.

I'm not sure how to get the actual video card info without opening up 
the box and looking, but from my xorg.conf file there's this:

Section "Monitor"
        Identifier   "Monitor0"
        ModelName    "Monitor 800x600"
        HorizSync    31.5 - 35.1
        VertRefresh  50.0 - 61.0
        Option      "dpms"
EndSection

Section "Device"
        Identifier  "Videocard0"
        Driver      "radeon"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
        Identifier "Screen0"
        Device     "Videocard0"
        Monitor    "Monitor0"
        DefaultDepth     24
        SubSection "Display"
                Viewport   0 0
                Depth     24
        EndSubSection
EndSection

If there's another way to get more info about this, please let me know 
as I don't have a good grip on all the various Linux commands that real 
SysAdmins know.

Thanks, Carlos.
lspci came up with:
01:05.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RC410 [Radeon 
Xpress 200]

lsmod didn't show anything related to video.

Is this enough information for figuring out why the terminal hangs when 
I logout?

I use the fglrx driver with my ATI card.  I have used the radeon
friver in the past, but that was a long time ago.  I cannot remember
if the radeon driver shows up in lsmod or not.

But we're getting ahead of ourselves here.  If you are in runlevel 3
(i.e. not starting X), then it does not matter what is in your
xorg.conf file, Xorg.0.log file, or lsmod output.

Are you setting your VGA console to a non-default size?  Are you
passing something like "vga=791" as a kernel parameter in menu.lst?
This is probably not the case, or your problem would be worse - no
video at all, ever, once the kernel loads.

Are you using a non-default console font, or a non-default console
encoding?

My laptop has an especially crappy ATI Mobility card:

  01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV350 [Mobility Radeon 9600 M10]

Once I start X, I cannot switch to a VGA console, or even log out of a
console X session.  If I do, the whole display crashes in a brilliant
pattern of colors.  There is no rescue from this other than rebooting.
The keyboard still works, so I can still "reboot blind".  I mention
this to point out that certain ATI cards are prone to fatal crashes.
Of course, my issue may be with the fglrx driver, whose code only runs
from X.

Try "rebooting blind" to see if your keyboard is still responsive.
after you log out, the shell should return to a login prompt.  Login
as root blind.  Then type "reboot" blind.  Does the machine reboot?

agreed.  i think this has nothing to do with vga drivers, unless, as
Carlos wonders below, you do something weird with your console.

what i'd do is login on another virtual terminal or via ssh, and see
what is still running on the tty, if anything.  my guess is that
there's a process still running there, and that once it goes away, you
will get your login prompt back.  'ps auxw' has a 'TTY' column that
will tell you this.  the terminal you start on will be tty1.

assuming that turns up nothing, perhaps you don't have getty set up to
respawn when you logout?  what is running on the tty's you haven't yet
logged into (tty2-X, typically 6)?  are there lines referencing getty
in your /etc/inittab (assuming fedora still uses inittab)?  do you
have any commands in your .logout file?  do the system logs say
anything about the tty or processes associated with it, or in fact,
anything at all at time of logout?

Sounds like a problem with respawning.  Unfortunately, I don't have
FC9 installed.  However, this is what I tried using Ubuntu 8.04:

- loged in to tty1 then loged out
- loged in to tty2
- typed 'ps faux | grep -w tty[1-2]'

root     20801  0.0  0.0   6928  2604 tty2     Ss   11:24   0:00
/bin/login --
rwcitek  20832  0.0  0.0   5036  2404 tty2     S+   11:24   0:00  \_ -bash
root     20822  0.0  0.0   1716   508 tty1     Ss+  11:24   0:00
/sbin/getty 38400 tty1

- typed 'grep -w tty[1-2] /var/log/syslog | tail'

Jul 26 11:16:47 Ubuntu804 init: tty1 main process ended, respawning
Jul 26 11:17:14 Ubuntu804 init: tty2 main process ended, respawning
Jul 26 11:18:16 Ubuntu804 init: tty2 main process ended, respawning
Jul 26 11:18:17 Ubuntu804 init: tty2 main process ended, respawning
Jul 26 11:20:05 Ubuntu804 init: tty1 main process ended, respawning
Jul 26 11:24:30 Ubuntu804 init: tty2 main process ended, respawning
Jul 26 11:24:39 Ubuntu804 init: tty1 main process ended, respawning


There may be a similar method in FC9.  I would suspect that if tty1 is
not respawning it would show up in the process table and in the logs.

Regards,
Robert

I went to the beer festival Friday evening. I would skip it if I were you. Too many people, long lines, the grass was beat into total
submission... It's probably a hog wallow by now. 
Go to the Lucky Lab and enjoy your beer.

   I've lived in 9 states and 3 countries; finally decided to put down some
roots here. I really like the area, and much prefer living here in east
county and watching The City That Works (snicker, snicker) from the outside.

   Enjoy! There's a ton of stuff to do, and it's a very walkable city.

I think the City That Works refers to the endless road construction and
sidewalk closures in downtown. =/

Subject: [PLUG] Debugging a Thunderbird Mail Problem
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0807261744560.13308@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   My wife uses Thunderbird as her MUA on the laptop running Xubuntu-8.04. It
keeps asking for a password when trying to send mail. I thought that I had
fixed this, but like the Hydra, it's popped up again.

   As far as I know, there's no reason for Thunderbird to ask for a password
when sending messages. It never has before.

   I'd appreciate some insight, thoughts, ideas, or other clues from those of
you more conversant with [x]ubuntu and thunderbird than I am.

I've always had to enter a password from T-bird to Comcast when sending
the first time I fire up T-bird. After that, I don't have to enter the
password again until I shut down T-bird and start it up again. The same
holds for receiving: password needed the first time after starting
T-bird, but not again until I shut it down and start it up again.

I do get strange T-bird dialog boxes from time to time asking for the
password, with it already in the text box. I hit <enter> and it goes
away. Then, after a while, I get it again. A restart of T-bird sometimes
makes this go away.

Did the mailserver suddenly change its policy to require SMTP AUTH,
where it did not previously?  Just gotta rule that out.

I don't know about thunderbird, sorry.

Subject: [PLUG] UDP packet level testing
Message-ID: <20080727014206.GA3289@gate.kl-ic.com>


I want to test for dropped UDP packets between two specific machines
over the internet.  I have root access to both machines.  I would
like to be able to control the destination port, packet size, etc. 
Burst testing would be nice but not mandatory.  What I DON'T want
to do is throw data at a kernel buffer or socket or whatever, and
let the kernel choose the packet size.

Are there any good tools for this?  I've tried nttcp, but that is
stream oriented, and seems to let the kernel choose packet sizes. 
iperf is an elaboration of nttcp, and nettest is a wrapper around
iperf.  Too high level, not enough instrumentation.

What this is all about is that I am told that my Actiontec cable
router to Verizon FIOS truncates UDP packets to 512 bytes.   I
would like to test that before I ask Verizon to switch me over
to direct Cat5 connection (ditching the feature-laden but poorly
implemented Actiontec).

BTW, is there any way to set the mtu (maximum package size) that
an interface/protocol will use FOR UDP ONLY, without hacking the
kernel or restricting TCP and other protocols?  I will want to
do this as a further test.  I know I can do "ifconfig eth1 mtu 500"
on the interface, to limit all packet sizes, but I would like to
try it on UDP only.

Whenever I do packet inspection I use wireshark for all the whiz-bang color
coding and sorting and analysis tools.have you tried using it in conjuction
with libpcap for this?

Subject: [PLUG] OSCON sign for PLUG general meeting
Message-ID: <20080727015639.GA3420@gate.kl-ic.com>


Before we left the OSCON exhibit area, I snagged the 5 foot long
booth sign that OSCON provided for PLUG, instead of discarding it.

If we put a sticker over the "615" booth number, we can hang it
up in the front window of the PSU engineering building during
our meetings to let people know where we are, visible from the
street.  We would need some way to temporarily attach the sign
inside the window that doesn't leave adhesive gunk.  The sign
is sturdy cardboard, and has two mounting holes that would work
with a wire and hooks.  If I recall correctly, the windows are
framed with aluminum channel, so two light C clamps on the
verticals, and some picture wire between them, would do the trick.

I might not always make it to the meetings, so if we do figure
out a way to use this sign, it might be better to put a regular
attendee in charge of it.  It will roll up into a one foot diameter
cylinder, any tighter and it will develop a permanent curve.

Ideas?
  
Keith

I don't know that it will satisfy all of your requirements, but I have used
netcat (or "nc") for many types of tests and experiments.

In response to your question regarding the MTU: If it's just for testing,
why bother making it UDP-only? I woudl just let it affect TCP for the time
it takes to do the tests.

Did enjoy.  Hit them all but Powell's.  Walked from the riverfront
with the Saturday Maket and Kell out to Lucky Lab for lunch.  They've
got a Caesar's salad with enough garlic to ward off vampires for
miles, which was great with the beer I had.  From there to PGE Park
and caught the MAX out to Hillsboro (saw a bit of the Fair) and then
back to Washington Park.  Took the elevator up and then walked around
the many paths from there all the way back to Pioneer Square.  Had I
not gotten my directions messed up, I could have swung by Powell's
before Pioneer Square.  Oh, well.  Next time.

Now I need to figure out how Sean created the path in Google Maps, so
I can put my route on it.

One thing I was hoping for was a good vista point to get a photo shot
of Mt. St. Helens and Mt. Hood.  Any recommendations for next time?

There is an observation deck at the OHSU hospital that has an amazing view
of the city from the top of the hill. You can either catch the tram from
downtown or hop a bus from SW Portland. Or you can walk up Sam Jackson Park
Road like I did the first time I went up there. Its quite a hike thought,
and there are no real sidewalks, if you fancy an adventure.

The lawn at Pittock Mansion has views of both mountains. The Wildwood
trail goes to Pittock Mansion from near the World Forestry Center in
Washington Park (across from the zoo).

Another view point, but not really walking distance from downtown, is
the stone structure on Rocky Butte (it's just west of I-205 and just
north of I-84). You can also see Mt. Adams, and probably Mt. Ranier from
there. I'm no expert with the Trimet route finder web page, but it looks
like the 33-Fremont line runs out to Rocky Butte Rd. You'll have to walk
up from there.

Of course, all of these depend on the weather.

You can use tcpdump in raw mode to a file and then use wireshark on
that file from
another computer.

Iperf has a mode to do UDP packets and control packet size.  If you are looking
at performance with this tool you may need to adjust the kernel buffer sizes.

nc is an interesting tool, thanks for pointing it out.  However, it
does not seem to move packets per se, but instead messages of arbitrary
length.  tcpdump at the receive or transmit ends shows everything being
reformed into 1024 byte packets.  Fooey!

However, the fact that the 1024 byte UDP packets are moving shows that
the web page I was reading was wrong, and the Actiontec is not truncating
packets longer than 512 bytes.

More tools and investigation needed.

Partly because I need the longer TCP channel without fragmenting to 
monitor the test.  I think???

As I recall, you can get a pretty good view of Mt. Saint Helens from
45.5143, -122.7153 in Washington Park up the hill from the Zoo.
IIRC you can see both from the Pittock Mansion at 45.5254, -122.7155
but that is a much longer hike from the Zoo.  The hills are pretty
bumpy up there, and covered with trees, so it is hard to find
good places with 360 degree panoramas.  That's the way we like it.

Keep in mind that Mt. St. Helens is slightly east of north from
Portland, while Mt. Hood is slightly south of east.  A panorama
including both would be about 90 degrees.

Your best shot of both would probably be from the top of one of 
the taller buildings, or perhaps from the upper cable tram
terminal at OHSU.  

Perhaps we ought to move this to PLUG talk, unless somebody
has a plan to install a Linux controlled camera on one of
the TV antennas on the top of the West Hills, so Robert can
get his panorama ...

Set a route from point at to point b and when they come up there is a

   Good. We like to keep the Portland area green by encouraging visitors to

   Not within Portland. Except, if you go up Twilliger Blvd. toward the
hospitals there's a wide place in the road where you can glimpse Mt. Hood
through the trees.

   Some days I can see both mountains while driving east on I-84, and there
are viewpoints out this way where Mt. Hood is still visible.

< > Packet Generator (USE WITH CAUTION)

This module will inject preconfigured packets, at a configurable
rate, out of a given interface.  It is used for network interface
stress testing and performance analysis.  If you don't understand
what was just said, you don't need it: say N.

Documentation on how to use the packet generator can be found at
<file:Documentation/networking/pktgen.txt>.

To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module will
be called pktgen.

   Symbol: NET_PKTGEN [=n]
   Prompt: Packet Generator (USE WITH CAUTION)
     Defined at net/Kconfig:198
     Depends on: NET && PROC_FS
     Location:
       -> Networking
         -> Networking support (NET [=y])
           -> Networking options
             -> Network testing


This little guy is in the 2.6 kernel.  I never iused it, but it always
looked intriguing.

I was riding my bike around about a month ago and I went up on Terwilliger
bvld There's a lot of park areas and also, I eventually came across a
restaurant with an excellent vantage point (Vista, not badvista.org)

Also a little past that restaurant there is a road that leads into a park
and some residential housing which also has a great and free view (unlike

There's also Council Crest Park.

"From the top of the hill, one can see five mountains in the Cascade 
Range: Mt. Hood, Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Adams, Mt. Jefferson, and Mt. 
Rainier. In addition, the park boasts a fantastic 180 degree view of

Thanks for the help with this, everyone. However, the problem seems to 
have fixed itself over the weekend. I can't really believe that, so I'll 
keep these suggestions for when it happens again, but darned if I can 
break it now. Pretty cool to have an OS that repairs itself!

   It's called benign neglect. Much better than percussive maintenance. Works
for some mechanical things, too.

Best views (car accessible) in my opinion are:

  Mt St Helens:  Windy Ridge (lat/long: 46.250079,-122.137365) paved,
                 but newspaper said recently the road was closed at
                 beargrass meadows
  <http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=46.250079,-122.137365&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=16&iwloc=addr>

  Mt Hood:  Cloud Cap Inn (lat/long: 45.404049,-121.654312) at the end
            of a ~10 mile dusty/washboardy road
  <http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=45.404049,-121.654312&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=16&iwloc=addr>

Not in Portland, obviously, but stellar views.  Rocky Butte (already
mentioned) is the other in-town spot.  Nice views of the Columbia
River and the airport from there too.

Subject: [PLUG] MTA Rejection Explanation Needed
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0807281350310.19791@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   My Postfix MTA is rejecting mail from an address that should be allowed
in. The mail log tells me:

Jul 28 13:11:58 salmo postfix/smtpd[17243]: NOQUEUE: reject: RCPT from
wsip-xx-xxx-xx-xx.ph.ph.cox.net[xx.xxx.xx.xxx]: 450 4.1.7
<someuser at hotmail.com>: Sender address rejected: unverified
address: Address verification in progress;
from=<someuser at hotmail.com> to=<rshepard at appl-ecosys.com>
proto=ESMTP helo=<venus.someserver.com>

   The IP address for cox.net is correct. I've added the 'someserver'.com and
hotmail addresses to /etc/postfix/rhsbl_sender_exceptions with an explicit
'OK'.

   Which address of the three is unverified, and how do I fix this problem?

Message-ID: <488F29CE.5000501@comcast.net>

I don't know if auto fill is the correct term, or auto complete, or
something else, but what I'm trying to find is where Firefox keeps the
lists of stuff one has previously typed in a text box so that when you
start typing something, it will provide a drop down box with all the
similar possibilities you've used before.

I still don't know what it's called, but I can clear the drop down lists
by selecting "Clear Private Data" from the "Tools" menu and checking
"Cookies" from the list.

I tried looking in the file cookies.txt in .mozilla/firefox/(default
profile name), but didn't find the list I was looking for.

It is in formhistory.dat stored in some crazy format called Mork:

Subject: [PLUG] wanted: apache ServerTokensx
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0807291417400.7278@sphinktoo.pippiandcarlos.com>

I would like to get the full ServerTokens string, with optional mailto:
link, embedded in a completely different application (a lisp web
server).  Is there a way to kype the ServerTokens string from apache,
either via programming interface or special URL request?

For example, here's my string (not a public server).  You can't tell here,
but "localhost" is a mailto: link to the address specified in ServerAdmin:

Apache/2.2.9 (Gentoo) DAV/2 mod_ssl/2.2.9 OpenSSL/0.9.8g SVN/1.4.6 PHP/5.2.6-pl2-gentoo Server at localhost Port 80

One thought I had was to go to a URL that would return this information
in its response (like any URL without a default page, where the fallback
is to list the directory).  I was hoping for something more direct and
made-to-order.

Message-ID: <48910CD8.3010304@dslnorthwest.net>

While looking at a site reached through the following link:

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&ct=us/17-2&fp=4891a75e0a8a45ee&ei=kAqRSLrQLaHqgwO1jszhDA&url=http%3A//www.upi.com/Health_News/2008/07/30/Frankincense_reduces_knee_arthritis_pain/UPI-13641217431422/&cid=1231390931&usg=AFQjCNFW_CGj2PRYnc_gyDkrZ6DkeZ2tJg

A window popped up warning of a serious error in my computer.  I had to click in 
a few places to find how to shut down Firefox.  I did not trust that the message 
was legit.  I tried to capture the message (highlight and ^c), but it did not 
get captured.  Very suspicious.

The site is

http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2008/07/30/Frankincense_reduces_knee_arthritis_pain/UPI-13641217431422/

Entering the site again, I did not get the message.  Perhaps I had passed my 
mouse over some hot spot on the page--

Anybody shed some light on this?
