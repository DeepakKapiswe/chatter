Subject: [PLUG] Anyone Doing an Exhibits Table? Ubuntu or OSCON
Message-ID: <1180724846.6068.1.camel@localhost>

Folks, 

Just wondering if the group is doing an Exhibits table at the Ubuntu or
OSCON conference. In the past, it included at least one pass to some of
the otherwise high-priced conference sessions.

Thanks,
Mike

If so, I'd be willing to help man it and maybe assist with other
matters (financial?).

Subject: [PLUG] Understanding DNS...
Message-ID: <1180736570.23935.34.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I've been trying to study RFC 1035 and other relevant RFCs on
DNS because I'm busily writing a perl script to try and find
in my postfix mail log information about which SMTP clients
should be blacklisted.  I am only looking at 550 rejects where
the user is unknown in the relay recipient table right now.

I want to know things like, how do I understand discussions
of octets and practically determine from them how many 
characters a resolvable host name record must have?  

Why try to resolve a name that is malformed?  Net::DNS seems to 
be too slow for doing unnecessary DNS checks.

I want the following ideas I'm thinking I can use commented on:

* Resolvable fully qualified domain names are at least 1 domain and
  1 subdomain separated by one period.  I don't need to worry about
  other representations being used by legitimate smtp senders.

* I should force the same case when I compare one hostname to another.

* I can safely list (localhost, localhost.localdomain, unknown) as
  strings that should never be looked up via DNS.

* I can safely assume that the helo/ehlo and the RCPT from should
  be identical and consider an email more likely to be spam if they
  are not.

* No need to resolve the domains of sites I am hosting, but my partner
  is screwing up relaying mail which is targeted at mailbox names I 
  don't accept.

* I should blacklist the connect from IP address immediately of anyone
  who connects to my smtp relay trying to email a domain that I neither
  host nor provide backup service for.

* If you try to reach a mailbox name I have never hosted before that 
  doesn't exist 3 times, you are blacklisted.

* If you try to reach a mailbox name that I have phased out 6 times,
  you are blacklisted.

* If you try to use 2 different email names in a row that I don't serve,
  you are blacklisted.

The above ideas that I am curious about aside, another thing I want to
know about is how to set up a DNS blacklist.  Why not write zone files
directly and host them on my global DNS servers?  Is there a special
IP blacklist record in DNS?  The idea is that my partners can look
at my IP blacklist to determine who I will never accept mail from 
so that they don't try to relay email to me for spammers.

My basic concept is that there are rules I can check to figure out
when to blacklist people.  Graylisting isn't the best idea because
I seem to never know when a legit client won't retry and there's
the problem of not wanting to delay important email.

I'd recommend emailing marsee at oreilly.com to get a definitive answer, 
or you could just try entering os07dusg and see what happens.

So according the the Oreilly UG webpage, they would like a leader of the
UG to submit for the code.  Being that there is only 3 days left with
for a reduced OSCON registration fee, I would really appreciate it if a
PLUG "leader" would contact marsee at oreilly.com and get the code.....

The one you provided Galen doesn't work,

Thanks again,

I recently downloaded Fedora 7 and burned it to DVD.
I had also recently done some major updates on my FC6 system, but had not
rebooted.
When I rebooted my FC6 system, it would seem that the update had transformed
my
FC6 into a Fedora 7.
No need for the DVD I just burned.
With previous FC versions I never observed this type of upgrade phenomenon.
I had always loaded the next version of FC into a different partition.

Unless something has been changed with the update structure unannounced, you
have to specifically and intentionally change the yum update sources in
order for a full version upgrade with yum.  Distro upgrades with yum are
possible but usually not recommended.  It doesn't always go as smoothly as
Debian and its children can do with "apt-get dist-upgrade".

If you just update normally it will not upgrade to a newer version of the
distro.  You can keep updating from the FC6 sources as long as they are
maintained.  This is the desirable behavior, you don't want your system to
automagically upgrade itself to a new version before you can test it, and
when you wake up in the morning things are borked.

Are you sure it didn't boot off the DVD and run live mode (like Knoppix)
when you rebooted?  FC7 now includes live mode so you can take it for a test
drive before installing, or use it for demos, etc.

I know there are live CDs distributed, but possibly the DVDs have live mode
as well.

I just downloaded the DVD but have not upgraded (or tried it live) yet, and
I also downloaded the live CD to try on other machines.

FWIW I run Fedora 6 AMD64 on my desktop right now, and Ubuntu Feisty on
several different laptops (PC and Mac), most all of them dual boot with
WinXP or Mac OS X.  I have been running Fedora since it first came out, and
before that was running RedHat since 6.0.  I have switched around with
various of the other distros on my other machines, but always kept RH or
Fedora on my main desktop.

Matt

Your are right in that the system is not quite right.
When I reboot now into GUI mode (init 5), it no longer completes the login
process.
Using Ctrl-Alt-F1 I can log into the system.
I will be using the Fedora 7 DVD to load the system after all.

Despite my name not being Dave, I sent a request to Marsee and got the
following response.  Looks like she is out until the 8th, so we may 
not get the code until after the 4th.

Argh!  Now I see that I made a typo when composing the previous mail 
about the OSCON discount.  I meant to say 'os07dsug', not 'os07dusg'. 
  To add insult to injury, both discount codes were already available 
in the O'Reilly newsletter that Dave forwarded to the list on the 31st.

I just downloaded the DVD last night and as far as I can tell it does 
not have a "Live Mode". When it boots, it gives you a menu, including 
"Install", "Install Text Mode" and "Rescue CD", but I didn't see a live 
mode. Maybe I missed it. I'm currently installing it to a virtual 
machine under VMware Workstation 6.0.

Incidentally, one thing I miss in the installer for F7 (and CentOS 5 
too) is the ability to just load the whole enchilada with a single mouse 
click. You can customize the install and add stuff like you always 
could, but there's no "gimme it all I've got a huge hard drive" option 
any more.

Right now I'm on the hairy edge of switching to Fedora 7 for my main 
gateway (email/IRC/router/what I'm typing this on) box and my laptop, 
and staying with Gentoo on my high-performance dual-core big memory 
AMD64. It's mostly because Red Hat system administration is a marketable 
skill and Gentoo and Debian/Ubuntu system administration skills aren't, 
not because I think Fedora is "better" than Gentoo or Debian/Ubuntu.

  They split the distro up for some reason.  There is a separate
"Live" CD/DVD image available for download.

The live mode is available only on the CD, not the DVD. However, the
live CD does present the option of loading the whole banana into RAM if
it senses you have enough RAM for it. As far as I know (and I just
tried out a lot of different distros on my new desktop), the Fedora 7
live CD is the only one with the ability to load the whole thing into
RAM. It's a nice touch, and one which I wish the other live CD distros
would copy.

I should also add that Fedora 7 is supposed to have an easy-to-use
facility for making your own custom live CDs. I never got far enough
into it to try it out, but it sounds like a cool feature.

I did used yum to go from FC6 to FC7.  The "yum update" went smoothly.
 I had some problems with the FC7 kernel so I am using the last FC6
kernel.  I also had problems with gnome-panel but I fixed it by
deleting my panel and using the default.

There is a Live CD.  The Live CD can be used for doing installs by
copying the CD image to disk. It can't do installs.  The DVDs don't
have live mode.  There is a rescue CD for doing network installs.

Gentoo has that option, but I forget what it's called. I thought Knoppix did too

I will be building a new server system soon and need a more current

CentOS is based on current RH releases and is free.  Their target is 
enterprise and they have maintenance commitments with their releases.

Install debian and never install an upgrade again.  Debian's current
stable version is etch and only several months old.  It included some
very up to date packages and is rock solid.  You won't regret debian
once you discover apt-get and --dist-upgrade.

Coming from Red Hat 9, even the Red-Hat-like distros have evolved greatly in the
interim, but I think your Red Hat sysadmin skills will carry you further if you
stick with either Fedora 7 or CentOS 5. I've got Fedora 7 up and running and
it's much better in terms of completeness than some of the older Fedorae. It
has R, for example, available in the repository, a recent beta of the LyX
scientific word processor, and quite a bit more scientific software than the
older version s had.

But if you want stable, Etch or CentOS is the way to go. I've never used SuSE,
so I can't comment on it, but other folks have found it difficult to work with.

I'd recommend Debian 4.0 or Centos 5.0, though any modern distro should
support your hardware nicely and run the apps you want.

Subject: [PLUG] SNMP problem
Message-ID: <86wsyk4okl.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I am trying to solve a problem of sanely collecting some statistics
via SNMP.  I am using the NET-SNMP exec feature at the agent end, but
I want to collect multiple values that are tightly inter-related in
that they all get computed together.  If I have the agent exec script
return multiple values, they are returned as a string of multiple
values which I am pretty sure is going to confuse the hell out of
Cacti, the monitoring/graphing software I am using.

Here is the outlines of what I've done:

 a) I have a daemon on the monitored device periodically do a ping
    across a wireless link, and then if the ping succeeds, grab the
    rssi out of a /proc file and appends three values (time,
    ping latency, and rss) to a temporary file;

 b) set up an snmpd exec script that:

   i) moves the temporary file aside to avoid working on a changing
      file;

   ii) compute statistics from the moved file, min/max/ave latency,
       min/max/ave rssi and print them to stdout;

   iii) delete the moved file;

Again, this results in all the values appearing under one OID, which I
expect cacti will have difficulty with (maybe it won't?).  The problem
is, since step b(i) and b(iii) do somethings that should only be done
once per cycle, and since I don't know what order cacti is going to
grab OID's in, it isn't obvious how to have multiple exec scripts to
retrieve single values in a non-ugly way.

So, what is the right way to collect the multiple values?  I've
googled and haven't found any obvious solutions.  Clues most welcome.

Sadly, this is the model Oracle seems to prefer.

Two ideas.  The first one is the better, simpler choice.  The second
one is more far-fetched.

You could use <scp/> along with authorized keys.  The administrator on
the remote host end would have control over who connects, since they
have the power to add and remove public keys.  No password would be
required.

Maybe mount the remote resource locally?  Perhaps you could change the
remote repository over from ftp to webdav, and then use davfs2/cadaver
to mount the resource to the local filesystem.  This would put the
security tokens in the hands of root.  Or, if the remote host is in
the local network, perhps nfs is good enough.

Well, I don't think any Linux distro comes with Realplayer 
or webmail software.

The realplayer problem can be fixed I understand by adding 
helixplayer and mplayer plugins.  For webmail, I suggest 
the horde framework from http://www.horde.org and the imp 
package.

If you want a Redhatesqe system that is stable for a server, 
CentOS is a good choice.  If you don't need to run X, there 
is hardly any major differences between Redhateqse 
distributions, Debianesqe ones, and Slackware.

I want to see people get away from the idea that they need a
different distribution of Linux, because that fragments the 
Linux community a lot.  Anyone ever heard of PCLinux2007?
At one time there were evidently 300+ Linux distributions.
It wouldn't surprise me if there are twice that number now.

I fault the upgrade methods for all modern Linux distributions 
that are not offline repository friendly.  If Redhat 9 works 
and does everything you need it to, what on earth is wrong 
with patching whatever security holes it has that will be 
a problem for what you do with it and continuing to use it?

I would like to see yum redesigned so that it is easy to mirror 
repositories to a server on your local network and work from
that.  I am also concerned with so many updates for so many 
Linux distributions what these updates are for and whether or 
not they truly make things better.  There is something to be 
said for the upgrade a whole distribution at a time method.

The best way to avoid third party packages is to avoid owning
hardware that needs them.  It's a good idea to stay away from
64 bit hardware for a while.  I would like to see companies
release the specs to their advanced video cards and high end
USB/firewire hardware products under the GPL so that the OSS 
community can write high end OSS drivers.  When you need a 
proprietary driver on a Linux system, that is a major 
disadvantage.  These companies could collect donations via 
Paypal towards opening up their specs.  Name the price to 
open source your hardware, give the public a way to chip 
away at that, and see what happens.  Another option is to 
sell the traditional way with a certain portion of sales 
going towards open sourcing the device.  I think people will
pay a small premium if they know it's going towards making
their purchase more valuable in the long run.

  I used to do something similar with a Cricket system I had set up.
I needed to collect the status data from a large number of
asynchronous SNMP TRAP messages.  The TRAP messages couldn't be made
to conform to RRDTool's rigid expectation of when and where data was
suppose to be located.  The trick was to separate out the data
creation and collection steps.

  I collected the TRAP data via an snmptrapd external script.  The
script would strip the OID data from the TRAP and appended it to a
flat file in the "cricket" user directory.  There was a separate flat
file for each device, or "target".  Each line in the file contained
multiple Data Definitions, or OID data.  The flat files would end up
being filled with multiple lines of status data from the routers.

  Cricket was configured to call an external program every (5 minute)
collection interval.  The external program would calculate the min,
max, average, and number of traps, from the data, and then erase the
file.  The min, max, average, and number of traps, would be returned
to RRDTool via std-out.

  The system worked out OK.  It wasn't correct from a mathematical
standpoint.  Graphing a average in RRDTool creates an average, of an
average, which is a sin.  Other than that, it was a pretty robust
collection system.

I must differ regards CentOS 5.0 ...

I am currently upgrading 7 machines (2 desktops, 2 servers, 2 laptops,
and a firewall) to an RHEL5 clone very similar to CentOS 5.0 .  I have
run into lots of small broken things.  Compared to a similar upgrade
on two machines to an RHEL 4.4 clone six months ago, it has been much
more painful and time consuming.  I imagine CentOS 5.1 will be a lot
prettier.  You might consider upgrading to CentOS 4.4, and upgrading
again at 5.1.  Another alternative to CentOS is Scientific Linux, 
which is a clone with extra scientific packages and some media stuff,
out of FermiLabs and CERN.

If I knew then what I know now, I probably would have moved everything
to 4.4.  But every bug I encounter I think is the last one.  Also, I
would have turned off SELINUX on everything inside the firewall.
SELINUX is nice in theory but breaks a lot of apps in actuality. 
Many are problems with recent versions of gnome, which are common
to many distros (Ubuntu edgy and feisty, for example). 

When I finish with my upgrades, I will post a list of problems 
encountered.  I am migrating one of the laptops from RH9, so there
may be some information we can trade.

Eventually, I think I will be happy with 5.0, but the journey has been
more painful than I planned on.

I don't know about Scientific Linux, but CentOS just put out a 4.5, so 
if you're going with an RHEL 4 clone, that's probably better than 4.4. 
Meanwhile on the distro front:

1. I have Scientific Linux 5 but I've been unable to get it to run as a 
guest in VMware Workstation 6. I have *not* had similar problems with 
CentOS 5, and I haven't really taken the time to dig into it. There's 
nothing in Scientific Linux that I can't get in source form for CentOS, 
although I think I'd prefer Fermilab and CERN as a source of updates to 
a "community" distro.

2. Yeah, SELinux in CentOS and other RHEL 5 workalikes is a PITA. So is 
having your servers cracked, though. I'm digging my way through the RHEL 
5 Deployment guide, which has a couple hundred pages on security now. :)

3. Fedora 7 looks really nice. I am struggling very hard with the 
temptation to join the Fedora bandwagon. But I have no intention of 
running anything but Gentoo on the new box, so I'm holding off.

I posted the question on the Open SuSE Forum, http://opensuse.us/ and
learned that I should be using the printing manager found under Start -
Utilities - Printing instead of the CUPS web interface. I suspect it
might be that I installed the printer using YaST.

As a counterpoint, I'll say that our infrastructure servers at work 
are all now running CentOS 5 x86_64 with SELinux enabled in targeted 
mode. Other than tweaking SELinux policies, everything has worked just 
fine...

You may want to look at Ubuntu. I've been happy with the Ubuntu  
distro for the past 3 years. I previously used SUSE, but that was  
before they joined Novell, and that worked fine for me also. I think  
SUSE now costs money for their server edition, and I know that  
Ubuntu's sever edition is still free (i.e., no monetary cost).

Okay, I solved this.  I wrote a "get-value.sh" script that checks to
see if its value is fresh (less than 60 seconds old).  If not, it
calls a refreshing script, "calculate-stats.sh", which includes a
locking feature to prevent race conditions.  If a version is already
running, it waits until the lock goes away and then returns, otherwise
"calculate-stats.sh" computes all the values and stashes them in
separate files and returns.  The "get-values.sh" script then grabs its
value out of its file and prints that.  I can snmpget all 10 values in
about 2.5 seconds.

  Be sure to test the failures.  The timeout values in NET-SNMP are
pretty long.  The time-outs with "ping" are even worse.  It's pretty
easy to code up a race condition if you have too many failures during
a collection interval.

  Ping also returns some pretty crazy text during different failure
conditions.  (try shutting down your ethernet port or munging your
route ;-) )  The "fping" application is a little more flexible that
the standard "ping" tool.  It's was also written (unlike ping) to be
called from a script.

Message-ID: <46644E4F.4070804@comcast.net>

Is there a way to change the default behavior of the print button, the
one with the tool-tip, Print File Directly? Clicking on that button
causes every sheet in the spreadsheet to print. In order to print just
the current sheet, I have to print from the File menu and limit the
printing to just the one sheet.

I've Googled and read about setting the print range, but that's an extra
step. I'd rather the default be to print the current page.

   This is also true for XessSE. And, it will print only one copy at a time.
PITA, yes. But, that's the way they do it and they've not changed in years.

In Excel, only the current sheet prints. If there is more than one page
in the sheet, they all print, but other sheets in the file do not.

Sigh. Maybe some year I'll learn the code, and how to change that
button. Meanwhile, I'll stick to File - Print.

Ah.  fping.  Didn't know about that.  Thanks!

The monitoring script runs on the device, like so:

   #!/bin/sh

   # grab information for link monitoring

   DESTIP=10.11.x.y
   DESTNAME=backhaul
   IFACE=ath2
   INTERVAL=500 # in 0.01 second units
   OUTDIR=/tmp/linkstats

   centiseconds () { 
   awk '{ printf("%ld\n", $1 * 100) }' /proc/uptime 
   }

   mkdir -p -m 777 ${OUTDIR}
   start=$(centiseconds)
   end=$start

   while true; do
       end=$(expr ${end} "+" ${INTERVAL})


       latency=$(ping -c 1 -i 5 -w 4 -q ${DESTIP} | sed -n -r -e 's|^rtt min/avg/max/mdev = ([0-9.]*)/.*|\1|p')

       if [ "${latency}" != "" ]; then
           rssi=$(awk 'NR == 1 { level = $1 } 
                       NR == 2 { noise = $1 } 
                       END { print level - noise }' /sys/class/net/${IFACE}/wireless/level /sys/class/net/${IFACE}/wireless/noise)
       else
           latency=""
           rssi=0
       fi

       now=$(centiseconds)
       echo $now $latency $rssi >> ${OUTDIR}/${DESTNAME}

       sleep $(expr $(expr ${end} "-" ${now}) "/" 100)
   done

Looks like the latency assignment could be shortened to:

  latency=$(fping -A -C 1 -t 4000 -q ${DESTIP} | cut -d' ' -f3)

The clock stuff is a hack job, that could be made nicer.  During the
computation of statistics, the file that is accumulating here is mv'd
to a "work area" so as not to interfere with new incoming values.

Subject: [PLUG] How many open source OS projects exist?
Message-ID: <1180987851.7696.63.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I found out there is an AROS project which supposedly grew
out of the AOS project.  It is an attempt to produce the
equivalent of Wine for AmigaOS.

I found out about AROS trying to google on the question 
of whether or not there are alternatives to ReactOS.  
ReactOS appears to be stuck in, 
"becoming compatible with the threading capabilities 
of Windows 2000/XP hell."

Maybe ReactOS has gone backwards in the 0.3.x releases so
far due to the audit, because of attempts to rewrite kernel 
code that is hard to account for.  I've read that there is
difficulty created by people who contribute code to the 
ReactOS project only to leave without providing any means
to contact them in the future.

The two month release time line after ReactOS 0.3.1
is looking more like a 4 month long one.  I wouldn't
want to be responsible for ReactOS's web site because 
developers got angry when it didn't represent the 
development time line accurately and people asked 
about the discrepancy on the discussion boards.  I 
asked on the NEWS board what is going on 
( I didn't know any better at the time. ).

AROS doesn't do memory protection and it's web site says
that it's impossible to do memory protection for it.  The
FAQ also says that arguing about adding certain modern
features to AROS that AmigaOS doesn't have is pointless
until something stable is produced.  This at least
suggests that AROS is easier to stabilize than ReactOS
in the short run.  But is AROS worth anything?  There
aren't any modern Amiga's being made to my knowledge
even if the Amiga's idea of plug and play really does
work.

For ReactOS, I wish the developers could find a way to 
keep it from crashing if a feature isn't implemented yet.
I suppose part of the problem is having to implement the
GUI in ring 0 of the Intel processor spec because 
Microsoft does this with Windows.  An OS that is very
protective when an unfamiliar binary wants to execute
that can back off when it knows the binary works could
have a major advantage over the current OS choices.  
Unfortunately, a kernel with this capability would be 
simply huge I imagine.

Why is the idea of creating a minimal GUI environment 
to support Firefox on top of Freedos controversial?
If I want to run Firefox in a virtual environment
as a means to protect my host system, do I really
need the average Linux or Windows environment for 
that?  Freedos has the ability to run on old 
equipment stably than even Linux can't run on.  
In theory, a lite Firefox gui for Freedos can 
bring the hardware requirements to run Firefox 
down.

I suppose 800+ Mhz systems that can run Firefox smoothly
are so common that noone cares about running it on lower
spec machines.

Are there any groups trying to build an OS and encourage
production of hardware for it that is the best of every
operating system that came before it?  What would the
best of: Linux, Windows, BSD, MacOS-X, and AmigaOS look
like?

Running Vector Linux will allow your old 386 computer to get on the internet and do many other fun tricks. You must become a CUPS wizard to install printers. You will need to understand how to use CUPS in the web browser.

BTW, I was just informed of (as of net-snmp 5.2) an "extend" feature
for the snmpd agent which handles multiple line output.
Unfortunately, the agent I am dealing with is 5.1.2.  Doh!

Gah.  Not so easy.  Even with the -q, it is noisy on error and reports
results on stderr.  I've reverted to my older, hacky-but-working
/bin/ping version.

How exactly would running firefox on dos be lighter than running it on 
linux?

I wonder how much lighter it would be if they yanked out the 
dos-compatible filesystem abstraction layer (among other things forced 
on them by qdos.)

Well, the best of the best will of course be Hurd.

I have to wonder exactly what Windows^Wqdos has to contribute.

Or MacOS-X for that matter.

Try "adding commercial backing to Linux".  Imagine the impact of 
redirecting the efforts of all of that polishing onto something which 
is inherently less squishy, soft, and brown.

Of course Vector Linux will run with minimal system resources on a 386 and run Firefox fast. It will also run on X86 processors.

I run a number of servers on Ubuntu Dapper and find it to be very nice.
Canonical is committed to supporting Dapper on servers until 2012, and it is
new enough (released in June of 2006) that the software hasn't gotten stale.
If you need newer packages than are available on Dapper, you can use Feisty
(7.04) but it will only be supported for 18 months, IIRC. I agree with
another poster that once you get used to apt-get (or aptitude, in my
particular case) everything else out there (except maybe foresight's
Conary...) seems archaic in comparison. Regardless of whether you use Debian
or Ubuntu, I'd strongly recommend either, based mostly on the fact that APT
is so nice to use.

Thank you.  That matches a lot of what I read already.  I was slightly 
confused due to the argumentative nature of the posts.  It was obvious 
that a few folks had opinions that were not going to be changed.  I will 
continue with the generic.

Subject: [PLUG] RHEL 5
Message-ID: <4664FDEC.2070806@gmail.com>

My company is currently deploying our product for a customer who has
chosen RHEL5 as their platform.  I haven't been a regular RH user for
several years now.

I would like to set up a similar box at work to do some testing on..

What Linux distribution is most like RHEL5, without having to pay for RHEL5?

Fedora 7?
CentOS 5?

Is there a publicly available RHEL5 image available, that I don't know
about?

thanks,

Sean

Both Scientific Linux 5 and CentOS 5 are analogs (minus encumbered
images) of RHEL5, recompiled from source.  CentOS seems to follow a
little more quickly, while STL has (or allows in some national lab
derivatives) some additional features/packages.

The closest Fedora would be 5, with some similarities to 6... or
vise-versa... not "directly" related at all, details on fedora's site,
from Redhat, etc, and they vary with time ;)

CentOS 5. It's RHEL 5 minus only those things trademarked by Red Hat 
(mainly graphics and logos).

CentOS 5 is RHEL 5 built from Redhat RPMs and with the trademarked bits 
stripped out.

It is as close as you are going to get without a "real" copy of RHEL 5.

I can't seem to find it on the man page..

Try /usr/bin/yum -- though you'll want to edit the repository config 
file to point at your NFS repository instead on one on the Internet:

   /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo

Since the is RH5, try adding the --aid flag to your rpm command.

I.E.
rpm -ivh --aid foo.rpm

Here's one way:

1. Install the createrepo package (on the client side or the NFS server).

2. Run createrepo on your NFS directory containing the RPMs.

3. On the client edit the files in directory /etc/yum.repos.d.
- Add "enabled=0" line for the repositories you don't want or have.
- For those you want and have:
   - Add "enabled=1" line (or just remove the line).
   - Comment-out any existing mirrorlist or baseurl lines.
   - Add your own baseurl line, something like:
      baseurl=file:///nfs-mount/path/to/rpm/repository

4. Run "yum install packagename"

The RCPT from 82-38-83-43.cable.ubr08.brad.blueyonder.uk, how did
that get set?  Was it provided by the client that got rejected?

Concerning the helo=<42koyf1> line, can I assume that a single word
will never DNS resolve?  Is there anything that the helo name has
to be?  Is the helo useful to anyone other than the sender of the
message?

What is the maximum allowable length for a resolveable DNS name?  Perl's
Net::DNS is a little slow, especially when it's fed unresolveable strings.
Is there a perl module that I can use to detect if a string is a valid
fully qualified dns domain name?

Does the domain part of the mail from, jadev.co.uk, have to resolve for a
legit email?

My goal studying the log is to decide who to ip blacklist over time.  I
want to DNS export my ip blacklist, but that's another project I suppose.

Subject: [PLUG] zip inside an antfile ... strange
Message-ID: <1783877232.1181102119214.JavaMail.root@fepweb11>

I am very confused. I'm looking at a zip inside an antfile that doesn't work. I have extracted asimple example that illustrates the issue I am having. Can someone take a
look at what follows? ... it's not long to read and I've tried all my tricks ... it seems very strange to me.

1.
Note that there are jar files present in the following directory
hierarchy.
ted at halibut:/opt/build001.ecf/ecf.build/tmp$ ls -R
.:
customTargets.xml  eclipse
./eclipse:
plugins
./eclipse/plugins:
org.apache.commons.codec_1.2.0.jar
org.apache.commons.httpclient_3.0.1.v200703281019.jar
org.apache.commons.logging_1.0.4.v200701082340.jar

2.
Try this simple ant file as follows: (Note that I am running in tmp and
eclipse/plugins are local to me.)
ted at halibut:/opt/build001.ecf/ecf.build/tmp$ cat customTargets.xml
<project default="main">
 <target name="main">
    <exec executable="zip" >
       <arg line="-r foo.zip eclipse/plugins/*.jar" />
    </exec>
 </target>
</project>

3.
It doesn't work. (BTW, docs tell me it should.) Not matched? -- the files
are really there as shown above.
ted at halibut:/opt/build001.ecf/ecf.build/tmp$ ant -f customTargets.xml
Buildfile: customTargets.xml

main:
     [exec]     zip warning: name not matched: eclipse/plugins/*.jar
     [exec]
     [exec] zip error: Nothing to do! (try: zip -r foo.zip . -i
eclipse/plugins/*.jar)
     [exec] Result: 12

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 0 seconds
ted at halibut:/opt/build001.ecf/ecf.build/tmp$

4.
Do it from the command line (not thru an antfile and it works).
ted at halibut:/opt/build001.ecf/ecf.build/tmp$ zip -r foo.zip
eclipse/plugins/*.jar
  adding: eclipse/plugins/org.apache.commons.codec_1.2.0.jar (deflated
13%)
  adding:
eclipse/plugins/org.apache.commons.httpclient_3.0.1.v200703281019.jar
(deflated 9%)
  adding:
eclipse/plugins/org.apache.commons.logging_1.0.4.v200701082340.jar
(deflated 10%)
ted at halibut:/opt/build001.ecf/ecf.build/tmp$

5.
The antfile will work if I don't use the *. That is, if I explicitly
type out the jar file name without a wildcard. I have tried various
schemes for escaping the * ... such as \*, **/*, **/\*, etc.

I've put in a bunch of time on this ... I'm stuck.

Subject: [PLUG] java accounting math
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0706052153050.24526@sphinktoo.pippiandcarlos.com>

I am starting to code the math portion of a java accounting app at Ye
Olde Day Job.  It is a refactor of a badly designed death-jsp that
some contractor wrote a few years back.  The important things to know
about this app are that it's java, it has to do accounting math
accurately, and I have the freedom to put forth extra effort to make
it nicely written, maintainable and mathematically accurate, since
everyone's sick of dealing with the contractor-code.

I'm fishing for best practices in the area of programming accounting
apps in java.  I have been able to find very little online.  All I
found so far was this bug report, which says it's better to use new
BigDecimal(String) than new BigDecimal(double):

http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4863883

Should BigDecimal be used for java penny-crunching, or is Double
sufficient?  Doing math with BigDecimal sure is a pain, and it looks
nothing like math.  Maintainability of the source code is a big
priority.  Easy-to-read formulae are a bonus.

In this vein, I am looking at jatha.  Has anyone used it?  Expressing
the math in lisp would be the pinnacle of elegance.  The big question
is the data type returned by math functions.
org.jatha.dynatype.StandardLispReal has a toJava() method, which
"Returns a Java Double, Float or Integer object, depending on the
typeHint."

The BigDecimal versus Double question is the one I have to deal with
first, since everything depends on it.  So if I could ask only one
question per post, this would be it.

Message-ID: <86bqftlmgy.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I know you are all waiting anxiously for the answer to this question I
brought up over a year ago, so I won't keep you in suspense any
longer.

Around May 3, last year, I asked a question about how to force a
reboot when you had just stomped all over the read-only filesystem you
had just moments before been running off of.  I was investigating ways
to remotely flash an embedded wireless router (Soekris 4826 boards)
from a running system.  Remotely flashing was desirable, because they
were strapped atop scary roofs.  Remotely rebooting was desirable
because I don't always have access to the power supply and because I
am too lazy to leave the house.

Basically, I ssh into the box, pipeline a file from over the network
(with ssh or wget) and /bin/dd it directly onto a 64meg soldered-on
flash device with an ide interface, /dev/hda.  Something like:

  ssh <user>@<host> 'dd if=new-image.img' | dd of=/dev/hda bs=64k

Since /dev/hda1 is what the system is running off of (read-only),
the system gets severely confused after the dd has completed.  If the
new image shares enough structure with the old image, it may still be
possible that you can type "shutdown -r now" and it'll work.  I was
encountering a situation where it didn't, and I was trying to figure a
way to do the remote reboot, as the reboot solves all.

I got a few suggestions, which either were not supported on the
running system, or which actually just didn't work, or which I was
just too stupid to notice and follow up on.  Last year, I gave up and
waited to get physical access to the power cord.

Flash forward to the present.  I am working on some fresh firmware to
solve various accumulated problems with the old firmware and I find
myself, again, too lazy to leave the house.  I think to myself *THERE
MUST BE A WAY*.

I was thinking about some kind of pivot_root scheme where I'd set up
enough of a system in a ramdisk that I could still run a few commands
after the flash was turned to mush under my feet.  Turns out, that
doesn't work.  It needs /dev/initctl (a fifo) to talk to init to do
the shutdown, which after you chroot isn't available any more.  I
tried a few other things, before staggering back to the obvious.  How
does init reboot?  Turns out there is a binary /bin/halt (and a
symlink to it called /bin/reboot) that takes a -f force option.  I
download some source and read.  Oh.  There is a system call, reboot,
with a magic number.  I write a very short program, that I call
poison.c:

  #include <sys/reboot.h>
  int main () { reboot(RB_AUTOBOOT); }

and link it statically (gcc -o poison -static poison.c) so that I
don't have to worry about the libraries that no longer exist after the
flash.  The binary is about 400k, btw, even stripped, but no matter,
it is well worth every lovely 100 kilobytes.  So, now I ssh in, copy
in the poison binary to a ramdisk (there will be no copying or much of
anything else after the flash), do my ssh pipeline to dd, and as soon
as it's complete, I bite down on the capsule (run ./poison) and wait
for reincarnation (get the remote reboot I have been long longing
for).

Ahhh.

Now, I *am* seeing some corruption in the reflash that I hadn't
noticed before.  After the reboot, I md5sum /dev/hda and get the wrong
number, but that's another story for another day.

If you never have to deal with fractions of pennies, then you can make
life much simpler by using integers.  On input, convert dollars and cents into
plain cents, do your math, and convert the result back to dollars and cents
to output it.

This app is not just pennies, actually.  I forgot to mention that
there is also percentages.  The ratio of budgeted labor hours
vs. actual labor hours is one example.  These invariably involve
dividing two large numbers (large in terms of dollars, anyway).
However, if I am careful, I can avoid doing calculations with these
percentages.  They should always be the output of a calculation, never
the input into one.

I'm not too fond of representing a typed value with a different data
type, with lots of conversion back and forth.  However, there is
something to be said for it if I gain accuracy, and the conversions
can be abstracted away.  Binary Coded Decimal is a prime example.  I
doubt it's best practice to implement BCD in most java accounting
programs.  Is it more common to see Integer representations?

Carlos,

   I don't know java, but I've dealt with this issue before in C and Python.
In general, using a string or long integer is preferable to using
floats/reals.

   The problem with the latter is the way they are represented internally as
binary digits. To illustrate, try this in your python shell:

>>> 125.49 - 53.16
72.329999999999998

and imagine how this very small lack of accuracy will cascade through a
series of transactions.

   Many languages have libraries to handle high-precision monetary (and
similar) arithmetic using integers or strings. It appears that the
BigDecimal(String) library is what java offers. While it may be more effort
to write, the results are certainly worth it.

HTH,

Rich

1. There is a project called Tunes that is attempting to "redefine 
computing". Their web site, surprisingly, is http://tunes.org.

2. If you're going to look at historical operating systems, you might 
want to include some mainframe and superminicomputer operating systems, 
such as VAX/VMS, Xerox CP-V/Honeywell CP-6 and the venerable IBM 
juggernauts like MVS and VM.

3. This question probably belongs on Plug-Talk rather than here, but 
I'll ask it here anyway. What is this fascination people have with being 
able to run on older machines? If you look at the MIPS per watt or MIPS 
per cubic foot of, say, an AMD Athlon64 X2 4200+, compared with two 1 
GHz systems, four 500 MHz systems, etc., you really have to wonder why 
people hang on to their old boxes.

I gave away my 933 MHz Pentium III to free up a slot on my 2-port KVM 
switch for the X2. I am now thinking I'll give away the other box on the 
KVM switch, a 1.3 GHz Athlon TBird.

I haven't looked at ant in a while, but I have a question and a guess.

- Why not use a <zip> task instead of an exec task with zip? Then you
can define a fileset or zipfileset the way you expect

- Guess: When you use exec, ant is forking the executable directly, so
there's no shell executed to interpret the * as a fileglob. Instead,
it's being passed as a literal splat character.

Good luck!

Can anyone suggest a version of "whois" that strips off all the annoying
legalese?  There is a perl module Net::Whois::Raw that takes a crack at
this, but no apps wrapped around it that I know of.  Perhaps some young
student seeking fame and notoriety can whip something up.

Text based, of course, but an additional and optional gui wrapper 
could placate the command-line-phobics.

Thanks. Why the exec? We never get to write anything from scratch these
days .. this code snippet is from a build environment that contains
hundreds of xml lines and dozens of config files (it actually runs under
CruiseControl and uses Eclipse's antRunner). Using exec has something to
do with retaining file permissions in the zip (maybe). I did think of
using the zip task ... but I wanted to change as little as possible
(also took out the -q to put more info into our log file).

It is working now. I changed some lines in one of the xml files to be 

<exec executable="zip" dir="${assemblyTempDir}/">
  <arg line="-r ${zipargs} '${archiveFullPath}'"/>
  <arg line="${pluginArchivePrefix} -xi
${pluginArchivePrefix}/**/*.jar"/>
</exec>

instead of 

<exec executable="zip" dir="${assemblyTempDir}">
  <arg line="-r -q ${zipargs} '${archiveFullPath}'"/>
  <arg line="${pluginArchivePrefix}/*.jar"/>
</exec>

This was a "seat of the pants" change. I don't know why it works. It's
not how I interpret the docs. I'd like eventually to understand what's
happening, and it's something I'll monitor. But at least the builds are
working now.

It appears that you are correct in presuming that BigDecimal is java's way
of handling accounting arithmetic.  I found a Sun java API for smart card
programming, which contains a class called BigNumber, which encapsulates
BCD representation.  But it looks far too chunky to use in an accounting
app, while BigDecimal seems adequate for the task.

In a world where languages exist that can easily handle the math (fortran,
lisp, caml), why do we use java for accounting anyway?  What a marketing
triumph.  Maybe we should rename lisp after an addictive beverage, and
then everyone will want it.  I propose "Urquell".

Carlos,

   I remember struggling to learn BCD for use in FORTRAN IV with the WATFOR
compiler on main frames. Those IBM manuals were terrible!

   Well, here's something to think about: use java for the middleware and
front end (with SWING), but use PostgreSQL (or SQLite3) for the back end.
They have data types (NUMERIC and DECIMAL, with postgres; INTEGER in sqlite)
with sufficient precision, but you need ancillary functions to make them
work like the deprecated MONEY type in postgres. But, storing the accounting
data in tables makes present and future maintenance so much easier.

   If you want to look at a perl example for ideas, look at SQL-Ledger
<http://www.sql-ledger.org/>. You might be able to port it from perl to java
to meet your company's needs.

Actually, most of the data is in an Oracle 9i database (the ERP backend). 
I could do all the accounting math in PLSQL.  Then the results will be
exactly as accurate as anything else in the system.  This is actually a
heck of an idea.  Everyone in my department will consider this to be the
best solution possible (except me; I want to write everything in lisp, but
I'm a dweeb).

I have yet to install SQL Ledger, though I did obtain a copy when you last
suggested it to me.  It's something I mean to do.

Carlos,

   This looks like the ideal solution: rewrite SL in Lisp and use Oracle as
the back end. SL supports PostgreSQL, Oracle, and DB2. :-)

   It may or may not be what you want, but the accounting algorithms work
(even if they're not the most polished). It will give you a frame of
reference if nothing else.

Have fun!

Subject: [PLUG] striping in LVM or md?
Message-ID: <200706061339.17251.ewilhelm@cpan.org>

Hi all,

I've got four SATA disks and want to setup a raid 10 with md.

I'll be using md to create two mirror pairs.

I'm trying to decide whether I'm better off using lvm or md for the 
striping.  From my reading, lvm will parallelize writes across pv's, 
but I can't find any sort of definitive answer as to whether md is 
significantly faster at striping than lvm.  If the answer is yes, then 
I guess I build the whole thing with md.

But if there is little or no performance difference between md and lvm 
striping, then I have to wonder whether lvm should be involved.

It looks like managing a collection of disks as one logical volume is 
just as manageable with md as with lvm.  Where lvm comes into play is 
if I decide to allocate multiple LV's on a single PV.  That is, it 
seems that striping would be faster as pure-lvm if I am already using 
lvm to allocate multiple LV's (because it eliminates one layer of md), 
but assuming no logical volume subdivisions, I would guess that a 
purely md setup would prevail.

Summarizing, I know I'm going to create these mirrors with md:

  A:= md raid1 of disks sda and sdb
  B:= md raid1 of disks sdc and sdd

Then I want to stripe them together as either:

  V:= md raid0 of A+B
or
  V:= lvm VG of A+B

And I'm pondering possibly

  V1:= lvm-defined LV
  V2:= lvm-defined LV
  (etc.)

But if I do make LV's, then the md raid0 is an extra layer:

  A:= md raid1 sda+sdb
  B:= md raid1 sdc+sdd
  V:= md raid0 A+B
  V':= lvm VG of V
  V1:= lvm LV of V'
  V2:= lvm LV of V'

vs using md only for the mirroring:

  A:= md raid1 sda+sdb
  B:= md raid1 sdc+sdd
  V:= lvm VG of V
  V1:= lvm LV of V
  V2:= lvm LV of V

vs the "maybe I only need one mount point anyway" md-only answer:

  A:= md raid1 sda+sdb
  B:= md raid1 sdc+sdd
  V:= md raid0 A+B
  mount V

(though this stripe-to-single-lv could also be done in lvm)

So, what's the best performance?  How much flexibility/functionality do 
I lose to do without lvm?  I've been using lvm for a while (strictly in 
"bag of disks with multiple lv's" mode), but this is my first forray 
into md and I've decided that it's probably time for some redundancy.

Because I have data on these disks and need to keep the server going, I 
can't exactly take an afternoon and benchmark it each way without 
spending all of the time moving data around and probably dropping 
something (I have backups, but some of this is just big deb/cpan 
mirrors and other various stuff that I would rather not juggle/re-pull 
from the net today.)  Thus, I'm seeking some best-guess 
recommendations.

Thanks,
Eric

In short, I'd suggest using the md-raid10 module.  It handles in one
module/management point the striping/mirroring.  I've had exceptional
performance using this with 14-drive FC arrays.  Feel free to layer
LVM on top.  As for using LVM methods for striping, it definitely has
its place (I use LVM striping to aggregate 28 RAID5 luns into a single
GFS filesystem...), but in a single installation with four disks, IMO
it's not appropriate when it can be handled more simply/cleanly in the
underlying layer that you're creating the array at.

You can of course implement things several ways, as you've noted... If
you don't have time to bench/test/validate everything, I'd suggest
going with the simplest-to-deploy method, that results in being
simplest to debug as well ;)

Subject: [PLUG] Socket question
Message-ID: <46673EEA.1040005@acm.org>

Anyone have a good understanding of network socket related stuff?

The problem is my communication with a system outside our local network 
using sockets is acting strange.  Wish I could be less vague but I can't.

One time I'm getting error messages from the remote application the next 
I can't get any response back from the application.  The socket read 
just hangs.

I've used the same code to connect to a local system with no problems 
but to the outside system it is _weird_.  I'm pretty sure it is not the 
remote system as they have other clients accessing it.  My concern is my 
iptables may be a little too tight.

The connection is to port 5150.  Should the iptables have something 
special to allow the socket connection to go out _and_ stay up?

And if it will help this is using Perl and IO::Socket::INET to connect 
and communicate.

Sounds like a possible ICMP blocking issue. Disable iptables and try
again? :)

Wish it were that easy to test.  This is running in a Linux-Vserver 
guest and the host system runs iptables for everyone.  Kill iptables and 
all the guests are open.  Maybe late at night.

This did get me thinking of other things.  I'm fiddling with iptables a 
bit right now but no joy so far.

Are you able to run tcpdump or a sniffer of some kind to watch the traffic?


Is the problem occuring after a certain period of time?

I forgot to mention that I have a pair of 120GB disks and one pair of 
160GB disks.  Does that change the answer.

On further reading, it sounds like md wants similar-sized devices for 
raid0, though I guess I could do "linear" on top of raid1?

Wouldn't that cost me just as much (or more) performance than doing the 
striping in LVM?  That's mainly what I was wondering with the original 
question.  i.e. if I'm doing LVM anyway, it couldn't possibly be 
without cpu cost, so shouldn't I just mirror in md and then make a VG 
out of md0 and md1?

Anybody got any references to benchmarks on that?  All google gives me 
is questions.

Thanks,
Eric

Any method other than JBOD will lose space in excess of the
lower-common-denominator disk, so you'll end up with a raid of 4x120G
(240G partitioned).  JBOD will give you a linear increase in volume
size based on #*size of disks, with a corresponding increase in
likelihood of full-filesystem-failure due to any one disk error
trashing the whole filesystem/volume.

Assuming you use md-raid10, you wouldn't use any striping/allocation
features of LVM, just saying you could still use it for the ability to
resize later (if you add disks/resize the array underneath).  That
type of usage adds no processing overhead for any operations.

Subject: [PLUG] vim question
Message-ID: <20070606210025.62af4462@badger.had1.or.comcast.net.>

I've used vim for roughly ten years. I'm not particularly encouraged to
try any other text editors, my fingers are just fine with input and
command mode, tyvm.

However, my vim use is rudimentary and I'm working on rounding it out
with a few "new tricks." The one I'm working on now is "indenting a
line with >> and unindenting it with <<"  

But I seem to be confused with some terminology. I want me indents on
the sides to be tabs (when I hit enter, tab, to write the inside of a
function) , and I want my >> to, basically, insert one tab on the side,
but sometimes ( depending on which machine I happen to be working on)
it doesn't seem to work that way.

So I'm missing something, and it's probably a definition thing; if I
have 'auto-indent' turned on, what's the name of the setting for
this ... indent thing?

At work we've got a big LVM VG of md RAID1 pairs. The performance is
effectively the same as just a single RAID1 array, except where I/O
happens to different PVs at the same time, in which case, it's, um,
faster...

Anecdotally, it eats the RAID5 array it replaced for lunch. Also has
the advantage of being easy to add space; just add a new RAID1 pair
and vgextend, etc.

Is your I/O load expected to be read-heavy?

Ok, so I plugged in a little disk and discovered that indeed I cannot 
create a striped LV from dissimilar sized pv's.  I was hoping lvm would 
give me the performance without the space loss (up until I ran out of 
matched space and then just be a bag of disks after that.)  Nope.

Thanks, that's basically what it looks like I'm going to do.  I was 
hoping that I could get "mostly striped", but I guess not.  How linear 
is "linear"?  Does it completely fill the first PV before writing to 
the second?  If so, I guess I could do raid10 in md and tack the 
remaining mirrored 40GB onto the end (but, yeah that's getting 
complicated.)

I suppose I could decide that I only need 100GB or so to be striped and 
then allocate the rest of the VG into one linear bag.

Now if I could just figure out how the heck I ended up with 200GB of 
files...

I will this AM.  I'm accessing the system remotely so I see my own 
traffic and I'm afraid to fiddle with the filters in case something 
important isn't where it should be.  The sysadmin is going to watch from 
the console or Sonicwall for what is happening.  My usage of tcpdump is 
pretty much limited to watching an interface's traffic.

It is happening as soon as I make the connection, now.  There was some 
other oddities but they might have been the application at the other end.

Thanks Dwight.

Checking this AM, I see now that I'd forgotten those are actually h/w
RAID1 pairs.

I'd guess mostly linear if you're starting from empty PVs, except
until you've done any pvmove type operations that would fragment
allocation.

"man 8 lvm" for some info on the allocation policy, which is configurable.

   But, ... does it report the interface as RUNNING? If not, it isn't.

Russ,

I'm not real clear on just what key sequence you mean by ">>" and "<<".
Here are the docs on autoindent...

http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'autoindent'

You may wish to see whether you have set expandtab in your .vimrc. If
vim is working to your liking on one machine but not another, diff the
.vimrc's and see what pops out.

Same as

/sbin/ifconfig eth1 down

Just does not say

UP BROADCAST RUNNING  etc...

No, otherwise how would you bring it back up again.  To prevent
routing from getting confused on the downed interface, though, you can
do an "ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0".

Figure out which module it is and rmmod and modprobe it.  That's one

If you sshed into the remote system from say 192.168.0.1 and you are doing a
test connection from another host you can use the not construct for tcpdump
to remove all the traffic from the host your are connecting from.  I.E.:
tcpdump not host 192.168.0.1

Or if you are connected via ssh, you can filter out your ssh (port 22)
traffic fairly easily:
tcpdump not port 22

You could also specify the port you are trying to connect to but you would

The LVM manpage implies that my choices for allocation policy are 
"normal" or "one of the unimplemented types".  :-D

On further experimentation, I see that I can lvcreate with -i 2 for 
striping *up to* the least common size, but lvextend will allow "-i 1" 
to add the rest of the available space without striping.  So, there's 
the "mostly striped" functionality that I was wanting.  I'll guess that 
it will fill the striped areas first.

According to the docs, this mixed striping is only supported in LVM2.

Quick update and a thank you to all that offered suggestions.

It was just where I thought the problem was.  The remote software. 
Turns out we weren't the first to have the problem.  Another UNIX 
installation had the same problem.

We as in, the software/service vendor and where I work, have come up 
with a work around that doesn't involve the socket based connection API.


Again thanks,
Rod

This is a bit of very recent Debian.  I compiled the source for
my RHEL clone, and it does an OK job.  It does not strip away all
the cruft, but enough of it that what I want to see is usually 
somewhere in the last 100 lines.  Thanks for the suggestion!

Message-ID: <81629026.1181277123127.JavaMail.root@fepweb09>

I hesitated to ask this question because I think it'll betray some ignorance on my part, but I've already betrayed so much ignorance on this list that it really doesn't matter any more.

1.
I think I want to programmatically find out what the latest tagged version in a CVS repository is.
2.
I'm using an IDE (Eclipse) and I can find that out pretty easily from the IDE but I don't know how to do this programmatically. What I've been doing is grabbing HEAD. I always know the name HEAD. But what I really want is the latest tagged version.
3.
I want to then build and deploy that latest version.

Do people do this? Am I going in the wrong direction? If not, how can this be done. I'm working within ant. Thanks.

Subject: [PLUG] Making Printers Visible to HPLIP/HPIJS (fwd)
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0706080600000.27397@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I've been trying to resolve the last remaining issue -- the LJ5
installation -- via the HPLIP mail list. It's been two days now and no
response to my providing requested information.

   If I'm correct, we have one or members of the HPLIP team present here, and
I'd greatly appreciate assistance in getting the printer once again fully
functional (that is, printing duplex by default, single-sided on request,
and not producing a blank page after each job).

   The problem seems to be that the system does not recognize a plain LJ5,
only every additional-letter variant. Details are below. I can provide the
output of hp-check, too.

   Responses on- or off-list are OK. I just want to regain access to the
printer's capabilities now that I've replaced the PrintPro drivers with
HPLIP.

Thanks,

Rich

Don,

    I've been running hp-setup, but without success. Today I tried a different
tactic, with partial success.

    I let hp-setup try to find both printers. It found only the 2500C, so I
went on and finished installing that one. Then, just for giggles, I
restarted CUPS.

    Re-invoking hp-setup and telling it the IP address of the LJ5 allowed it
to find it. However, it found the 5M rather than the plain 5, and
recommended the PostScript version of the driver rather than the foomatic
version. I accepted that default, and the widget told me the printer was
off-line, busy, or otherwise not responsive. That's not the case. But, when
I tried again, hp-setup failed and left this message on the virtual console:

error: Printer queue setup failed.Please restart CUPS and try again.
error: Unsupported model: HP_LaserJet_5M
error: Printer Error.Printer is busy, offline, or in an error state. Please
check the device and try again.

    I wondered about this when I checked the list of supported devices. It
seems that every variation of the LJ 5 is there, but not that model itself.
CUPS, of course, had no problems with these.

    So, one down and the more important of the two printers still to be
installed in HPLIP. What do you suggest I do now?

Thanks,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] headless builds and automatically generated files
Message-ID: <407983231.1181323847418.JavaMail.root@fepweb14>

On a more general level, here is what I'm struggling with ... wondering if other people have the same issues. I mean if you have the same problem, do you approach it in the same way (it seems to me there's got to be a better way).

I'm doing these Ecipse headless builds. Headless in this context means using Eclipse's PDE builder but not using it through the IDE.  This part is standard in the Ecipse world. People do headless builds (sometimes on the command line as an operator, other times through scripts), and end up with a bunch of jar files that they then deploy. If you're building a lot, you don't want to spend your time clicking through windows; you want to run a script.

Eclipse (the program) provides a lot of support to do this. Bascially what you do is set up a bunch of parameters and then push the button. Most of the files (a lot of them are ant files) that get run are automatically generated.

It turns out that you give Eclipse a parameter to tell it want files to get from its CVS repository. This can be the name of a tag or just HEAD. All the code to check out the files is automatically generated (and you can't edit it, because the next time you run, these automatically generated files are deleted and made again). 

Now the code that makes the jar files is also automatically generated. Each Eclipse plugin gets its own generated build.xml. Inside that build.xml is a <jar/> task that makes the jar files. What I'm generating has dozens of generated build.xml files and hence dozens of jar files.

The automatic system uses the same parameter to construct the name of the jar file it makes that it does when it checks out the files. If you set this parameter to what you want the jar files to be named, the CVS checkout fails because there are no files in CVS tagged with that name.

What I want to do (I think I want to do this, but if it's too strange then I want to do what other people do) is check out the HEAD (because the HEAD should always be buildable and if it isn't I want to know), and build the HEAD. If the HEAD builds I want to zip up the resulting jar files and stick them on a site for download by our users. I don't want these jar files with HEAD in their names. Rather I want their names to have a unique name (like a timestamp, preferable the timestamp when I started the build, which mostly takes under 10 minutes). 

For a while I thought I wanted to get the latest tagged version, but I don't think so anymore. The tagged versions are our releases and interim realeases, not our daily builds. So they always build (I discreetly coughed here). I don't think I want to save and tag our daily builds even when they work. 

Here is a question ... do people save and tag daily builds that are just daily builds? You'd end up with a lot of tagged versions in CVS. A build only occurs if the CVS changes, but in this environment that is just about every day.

What I've (through a lot of frustration) discovered is that there does not appear to be a way of breaking the connection between the name used for checkout and the name used for jarring. If there is, I would be thrilled to find it.

The solution may turn out to be as simple as letting this automated system build the way it wants to and then rename the files at the end. This would probably mean deleting the generated zip file and then rezipping with the renamed jar files.

So there are really two parts to my question. 1. Am I thinking of all this in the right way ... that is, am I trying to do something unconventional (I don't want to) and is there a more standard way of providing daily builds to users. And 2) if my goal is a conventional one, how do people interact with these automatically generated files to get the job done?

Subject: [PLUG] Update: Accessing Motorola RAZR V3c cell phone
Message-ID: <4669E760.80400@comcast.net>

Some months ago I tried looking for a way to get pictures off my cell
phone without sending them using the cellular network. Moto4Lin didn't
work, nor was I able to find anything else. I got busy and let it drop
(the search, not the phone!).

Yesterday, I found myself wanting to be able to rely on my cell phone
camera as a backup camera, and still wanted the ability to download
images directly to my laptop (XP). I stopped in at one of the Verizon
stores and learned that the software and cable package they offer does
not grant access to the photos on my particular phone. That version of
the RAZR phone is locked down in such a way as to prevent anything
except being able to sync its address book with a copy kept by a
designed-for-the-purpose Windoze program.

Other versions of the RAZR line have other features. One has a memory
card slot that holds the pictures. I assume it can be read by any memory
card reader. (Since my phone doesn't have the slot, I didn't look into
it further.)

One day I'll upgrade to a TREO running Palm software (or something like
it -- maybe there'll be something better by the time I'm ready). When I
do, I'll try to remember not to purchase it tied to a phone company. I
suspect it might be more expensive than a locked phone, <rant>but I
really don't like the idea of some corporate philosophy deciding what I
can and can't do with hardware I purchase.</rant>

Do you know how to determine which V3 razr a given phone is? I have
done what you describe, in linux, with no additional hardware (aside
from a standard usb cable), and AFAIK, my phone is a V3c, but I could
be wrong.

I think I'll have to pull the battery to see if there's a more detailed
model number. I'll do that later, since I'm expecting a call in a couple
of minutes. A quick check of

http://www.store.motorola.com/mot/en/US/adirect/motorola?cmd=catDisplayStyle&catKey=601143&promoID=108500&WT.srch=1&WT.mc_id=srch_g_razr

shows 15 variations of the V3, none of which are the c model, which I
bought in March, 2006. I suspect the version I bought, at Car Toys, was
made for Verizon, since I got it with a Verizon calling plan.

I don't have a RAZR, but assuming it has Bluetooth, have you tried BitPim?
www.bitpim.org
Its a nice little program that works on Linux and Windoze.
I have used it with my Verizon locked LG Vx8100.  I got a cheapo USB
Bluetooth dongle (way cheaper than the proprietary connection cable and
proprietary Windoze only transfer program they have), and with BitPim and
this dongle I can transfer anything and everything I want (up to the mem
limit on the phone of course).  Address book, pics, and ringtones.
Not sure if it supports RAZR but it might be worth a shot.

On a side note, once you have more open and ready access to your phone, if
you are into this kinda thing, you can use an audio editor and trim your
favorite MP3s and use them as your own ringtones, instead of paying $1.99
per 3 or whatever they want to rip you off at.
I use Audacity, and have several favorites on my phone.  Available for
Linux/Mac/Windoze.
Usually just take out one of the stereo tracks, downsample the rate to
16khz, a few other tweaks, and it works great on the phone's tiny speakers.

I did think about Bluetooth. I use a Bluetooth head set with the phone.
One of these days I'll drop into Pacific Solutions and see if they can
let me try to connect my phone to my laptop with one of their Bluetooth
units. If it works, I'll buy it. (One of the useful things about buying
locally -- try it before you buy it.)

That's a great feature, but one I probably would never use. I prefer
vibrate instead of a ring tone. When my phone rings, I'd rather not
annoy the people around me. Also, I can feel the phone vibrate on my
belt even when going down the freeway with the windows open. To do that
with a ring tone, I'd have to have it turned up too much.

Right arm!

The current Linux Journal has a picture of a presentation slide showing
that Palm is moving their work into Linux (I don't recall just what that
means, and I don't have the magazine at hand). The chart compared Palm
OS to Windows Mobile (I think - MS software, anyway).

The LG 8300 works much better and it costs lets. It has stereo surround speakers in the hinges as big as a dime! if you get it threw Costco's Verizon store it will cost you $35 after mail in rebates.

Subject: [PLUG] How many ways to write a FQDN???
Message-ID: <1181158884.24935.0.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

How many ways can a fully qualified DNS domain name be written that
are resolveable?

I know of only this one:

some.name.com

Are there other possibilities that are common in SMTP email headers?

On the subject, what is the maximum nth level subdomain for DNS names?
I know it's possibly to get to 4 levels.  For example.

For some.name.com, it has a first level of the root domain, a second  
level of the .com sub domain, a third level of the .name subdomain,  
and fourth level
of the some. host name.

If I know the longest name that DNS can do, that makes it potentially
possible to avoid doing unnecessary DNS searches on bogus FQDN strings.

RFC 1035 suggest 255 octets which means, I think, that a fully qualified
domain name can have up to 255 characters in it.  Whether that includes
the
periods or not, I'm not sure.

Subject: [PLUG] Perl compatison not working...
Message-ID: <1181160226.24935.18.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Here is a simple history file entry:

arthematics.com|unknown|89.40.244.63|mhanniganzcum at arthematics.com|
sonya.h at robinson-west.com

There is one special header line in the history file which
starts with a #.

The test record to compare it to gets formatted the same way
and both strings get split into arrays ( because doing a string 
comparison doesn't seem to work right. ).  The whole record 
has to match to be the same, not just part of it.

...
 # Catch the depth of match...
----------------------------------------------    
if ( 1 == $TESTPRINT3 )
    {
print "\n","The string for the current record: $addteststr","\n","\n";
    }

    @test_arr=split(/\|/,$addteststr);
    $ltest_arr=$#test_arr + 1;

    $curr_rec="";
    foreach $curr_rec (@histrec)
    { # Verify that $addteststr isn't recorded already.
            chomp($curr_rec);

    if ( 1 == $TESTPRINT3 )
    {
    print "\n","The string for the history record: curr_rec","\n","\n";
    }

            @hist_arr=split(/\|/,$curr_rec);

            $lhist_arr=$#hist_arr + 1;

            $testing=0;
            $other_rec="";
            $hist_rec="";
            for ( $counter=0 ; $counter < 5 ; ++$counter )
            {
                   if ( $ltest_arr > $counter )
                   { $other_rec=$test_arr[$counter]; }
                   else
                   { next; }

                   if ( $lhist_arr > $counter )
                   { $hist_rec=$hist_arr[$counter]; }
                   else
                   { next; }

                   if ($other_rec eq $hist_rec)
                   { $testing+=1; }
                   else
                   { next; }
            }
   }
   #
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
...

The last comparison doesn't always work right and I don't know why.

I know that email addresses and DNS hostnames have periods and @ symbols
in them which may be special characters in Perl.  I know this code isn't
working right because the length of my history file grows longer even if
I run it on the exact same input data multiple times.

What I need to do is a string comparison that won't pay attention 
to special characters.

Message-ID: <1181189767.24935.32.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

http://www.cfp2000.org/workshop/materials/projects-dns.html

One thing I have against this idea is that anonymity on the
Web, if it ever becomes possible, will help spammers a lot.

Actually, I question the ability of people to find out 
where a site is located just off the domain name.  With
whois databases being cleared of useful information, 
how else can you track a domain to it's source?

How many words are there in the English language that are
appropriate names for a web site?  Considering that names
don't mean the same thing in all countries, the list gets
shorter doesn't it?  How about other languages, can DNS
support different alphabets?

What percentage of the available names are used up?

If a registar delegates someone the foo.org domain,
but later wants to delegate both the abe.foo.org 
and ben.foo.org domains, what can it do?

If fully qualified DNS domain names can be up to 255
characters long including the periods, how many 
domains is that really?  How many unique domains are
there that actually exist on the Net now?

Message-ID: <1181196880.24935.70.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

An excerpt from a Postfix-2.2 mail log:

May 27 04:29:50 web postfix/smtpd[29353]: NOQUEUE: reject: RCPT from
sophistasis.com[209.210.212.134]: 550 <plug_0 at robinson-west.com>:

Did my smtp server or the remote one provide the following???
     RCPT from sophistasis.com[209.210.212.134]:

On the subject of keeping spammers from using my plug
email address, is there a simple way to get a list
of the subscribers to plug?

What will Postfix 2.2 log for a helo, mail from, and RCPT from?
My Perl script searches entries like the above excerpt on the 
assumption that: <,>, and = will never show up in a helo, 
RCPT from, or mail from.  Can I ever get something like:

helo=<<>> 

or

RCPT from=<=>

or

to=<<=>>?

The following Perl code is from my script.

...
$badstr=  ( *NOTE: I had to break the line here * )
": Recipient address rejected: User unknown in relay recipient table";
...
if ( $trouble_line=~/$badstr/ )
{
# ******************************************************************
# From a trouble line extract the client helo, client RCPT From,
# and client ip address.

# Extract the helo/ehlo address from the original $trouble_line.
$helofrom=$trouble_line;
$helofrom=~s/^.*;.*> proto=.* helo=<//;
$helofrom=~s/>.*//;
chomp ($helofrom);

# Extract client RCPT from...
$rcptfrom=$trouble_line;
$rcptfrom=~s/^.*RCPT from //;
$rcptfrom=~s/\]: 550 .*//;

# Before finishing $rcptfrom, extract the client ip address...
$rcptfip=$rcptfrom;
$rcptfip=~s/^.*\[//;

# Take ip address off of $rcptfrom...
$rcptfrom=~s/\[[0-9.]*//;
chomp ($rcptfrom);
chomp ($rcptfip);
# ******************************************************************


# Extract the mail from address from the original
# $trouble_line.

$msgfrom=$trouble_line;
$msgfrom=~s/^.*RCPT from .*\[[0-9.]*\]: 550 .*;//;
$msgfrom=~s/ proto=.* helo=<.*//;

# Extract the mail to address from the current $msgfrom.
$msgto=$msgfrom;
$msgto=~s/ from=<.*> to=<//;
$msgto=~s/>.*//;

# Finish extracting the mail from address.
$msgfrom=~s/ from=<//;
$msgfrom=~s/> to=<.*//;

chomp ($msgto);
chomp ($msgfrom);
...
}
...

My question is, will the above code always work?  Are
the regular expressions I'm using above ever going to
get tripped up?

Please limit answers to Perl.

NOTE: This code is in a loop reading a Postfix 2.2 
      mail log a line at a time into $trouble_line.
      The outer loop and code to read a file are 
      cut.

I think I remember reading somewhere that ip addresses are supposed to be

Normally I'd say that a bracket is a Perl special character and not standardly

Subject: [PLUG] About to start developing a new Graphing (as in mathematical
 graphs) program
Message-ID: <466A40BC.7030907@yahoo.com>

Hi all.


    I'm currently in the planning phase of designing a new graphing 
application (as in the discrete math kind, not the calculus kind). My 
primary intent in writing this application is to create a GUI front-end 
for a graph library that extends the boost C++ library to suit more 
specific kinds of graphs (like, say UML or E-RD.) This isn't meant to be 
a clone of Visio, but is rather meant to focus on providing a front-end 
for users to do graphical analysis on their graphs (such as finding the 
number of cycles in their graphs, getting the number of outgoing and 
ingoing connections between nodes (where a node can be either just a 
plain old node or a specialized node like a UML class or a database 
table), auto-balancing graphs based on the number of ingoing and 
outgoing connections, finding the shortest paths and so on and so forth. 
As I envision it, these functions can have special meaning inside 
certain modes (such as Plain Old graph mode, UML mode, or ERD mode or 
whatever other modes there may be).


    Architecture wise, I currently plan to write this application in C++ 
using QT4 and possibly the KDE widget set (whatever it's called). I wish 
to use this architecture because C++ is a stable, proven language that 
is supported DFSG-wise (Debian Free Software Guidelines) across every 
major platform (including Windows---an important consideration in this 
case.) I wish to use QT4 and, if it's multi-platform compatible, the KDE 
libs and widgets (I honestly don't know, namely because I've never tried 
to compile KDE under Windows) because they are:


   1. Well designed: They implement the standard composite design
      pattern both correctly and in a manner that can be both easily and
      effectively exploited in the originally-supported language (for
      those who don't know, GUI widget sets tend to be designed using a
      Composite pattern, which enables widgets to be built in a
      hierarchy of widgets, which consist of Leafs and Components. A
      Leaf cannot have any Leafs or Components, but a Component (like a
      frame widget) can hold either more Components or Leafs. For a more
      detailed discussion of the Composite design pattern, look it up by
      name in "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented
      Software" or check it out at
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern.)

   2. Operating system-independently free: As long as the program being
      written is licensed under the GPL licensing scheme (which it will
      be), your program can be distributed freely, under both Linux
      /and/ Windows (see
      http://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/windows.)

   3. Stable and reliable: Both C++ and QT4 have been around for a long
      time and both appear to be quite stable and reliable: both from a
      design perspective and a QA perspective.


    I also plan to draw certain design ideas from a few existing 
graphing-like applications. Namely:

    * Kivio: The front-end they use for their graphing library. It is
      nicely done and a lot can (and should) be drawn from it.

    * Umbrello: It automates certain things about building UML diagrams.
      Namely, they automate the implementation of abstract methods and
      (should) auto-inherit public and protected methods. These would be
      useful generalize and allow the user to decide if and when they
      want these automated features active (like, for example, I
      shouldn't be forced to have aggregations going to diagram-defined
      classes when I've specified them as attributes of a class, even if
      it's "correct").

    * Visio: It implements custom nodes of some sort and should probably
      be looked at.

    * PIGALE: It seems to do a lot of the stuff I'm talking about, and a
      few concepts not really seen in most graphing programs, such as
      multi-dimensional graphs. This should be looked into by all means.


    I'm posting a notification of this here because this is my first 
major project---open source or otherwise---and I could use some advice 
from a veteran open source software developer on the logistical and 
pragmatic ends of open source development. I'm also looking for anyone 
interested in joining me in developing this graphing program. I've 
already submitted this project for consideration for hosting at 
sourceforge.net and, if all goes well, it will be approved soon. I'd 
also like feedback in general on my ideas in general. Is what I'm 
planning something others would be interested in or am I just 
reinventing the wheel?

    Thanks in advance for all your support!

Yes, there's a way to turn off all meta-characters for a given segment 
of a regular expression. Here's some code w/ comments



********************START CODE SEGMENT********************

#!/usr/bin/perl -w


  # setup a scenario similar to what made your code go BOOM
$strWithQuestionMarks = '?????';
$anotherStr = "Another stirng";

  # now stop PERL from going BOOM with the \Q and \E meta-characters!
$anotherStr =~ /\Q$strWithQuestionMarks\E/;

  ##  RJM:  \QTurns off the interpretation of ALL meta-characters until 
either
  ##             \E is reached or the end of the given regex is reached.

print "HA HA! I worked! :p\n\n\n";

********************END CODE SEGMENT********************

    If you need any more help, just say so. :)

How about co.washington.or.us. ?

You are correct in that the maximum permitted length of an FQDN is 255 
bytes, with an additional restriction to 63 bytes for each label within 
the domain name.  So, yes - it does include the periods (4 * 63 +3 = 255)

Does anyone know of an application, either Linux or Windows, that can
view and print a scanned, multi-page document saved as a .tif file? I'm
used to such things being saved as .pdf. The sender says that he's
sending me a MS Word document. It includes signatures, so it is an
image, as opposed to just text, so I'm not completely surprised at the
.tif format.

I've tried opening the file with the GIMP (both the Windows version and
the Linux version). I watch the progress bar zip by enough times to
account for the 12 pages that are supposed to be in the document, but I
only see what I assume to be the last page. Page Up and Page Down change
the page number shown at the bottom of the image display. I note that
Page Up and Page Down are supposed to switch between layers, but the
image stays the same.

I've tried opening the document with OO Writer, using File-Open. A
single, blank slide opens in OpenOffice.org Draw.

Hopefully the fellow who sent me the file can simply fax it, and I'll
get what I need. But, it would be nice to know what this is all about. I
stopped buying MS Office at Office 97. Did MS decide to support .tif's
as an alternative to .pdf for document images?

Rich,

You should be able to double-click on the file and have the tiff file
displayed.
All else failing you should be able to run the Microsoft Office Document
Image Writer to display the tiff.

I didn't know I had it! Last year I had to get MS Publisher for a
project. Sure enough, Doc Image Writer is included in that package.
Thanks for the pointer. I had to install it this morning, but once I
did, opening a .tif in it worked.

Thanks!

Progress, but only partial. display shows different pages of the .tif
file than what the GIMP does. It shows about 1-1/2 pages as white on
black. Unfortunately, when I try to right click and print, after
selecting the "letter" format, display quits with a segmentation fault.

After trying that, I decided to try the GIMP once more. It occurred to
me to try moving between layers. That doesn't seem to work, but if I
delete a layer, the one below it appears. I can print each layer, and
they appear to be in reverse order -- last page on top.

So, for the time being, I have a work around. Hopefully, I won't run
into .tifs too often. Most people use .pdfs.

Thanks for the ideas.

I don't know much about this, but I've read on several occasions that 
Verizon is notorious for locking down their phones.  Features that exist 
on a stock RAZR are not necessarily available on the Verizon RAZR, which 
is pathetic.  So what people have done is flash their Verizon phone with 
firmware from another provider.  Verizon's network is CDMA, so you'll 
need to get the RAZR firmwre from another CDMA provider, such as Alltel 
or Cricket.  Cingular/ATT and T-Mobile are GSM providers and theirs 
won't work.  You might want to research if the features you'll get give 
you what you want, but it seems many people are doing this with success. 
  This should get you started:

I'll weigh in on the side of BigDecimal coming in from the Ruby world.
Decades ago there were two kinds of computers, binary for science and
decimal for business, with an occasional half-breed like the IBM 1620
being decimal for science. ;) Even interest calculations, that involve
exponentials and logarithms, can be done in BigDecimal, IIRC.

Interestingly enough, the Ruby BigDecimal library includes routines to
do linear and non-linear algebra -- LU decomposition and Newton
iterations, for example.

Maybe start with `tiffsplit`.  You could also try `convert foo.tiff

1. A couple of other wheels that you might want to look at:

a. Dia/dia2code/tedia2sql
b. Graphviz
c. XFig

You've looked at Visio, Kivio and Pigale, which I haven't seen.

2. QT4 is an excellent toolkit and is available in open source for for
Windows, unlike its predecessors. Unless you're hell-bent on sticking
with C++, I'd recommend using a "scripting language" like Perl, Python
or Ruby, though. All of them have excellent bindings to QT4 and IIRC to
"boost" as well. And you don't have to recompile stuff to be
cross-platform -- the scripting language interpreters and run-times are
cross-platform by design.

3. KDE sorta kinda can be made to work on Windows. I have no idea about
Macs, though. By "sorta kinda can be made to work", I mean:

a. First you have to load CygWin
b. Then you have to go to the CygWin "ports" project and find a recent
version of KDE and all the libraries.
c. Then you have to start up KDE, and it's slower than the proverbial
January molasses.

In short, my recommendation is that you design at the QT4/scripting
language level and let the scripting language libraries take care of
integration with the platforms/desktops (Windows, Mac, Linux/Gnome,
Linux/KDE and Solaris)

In the 1980's I programmed in Turbo Pascal on CPM. There were two
version of TP at that time, too, the regular one, and one with binary
coded decimal. My client would not go along with rounding errors from
the regular one, but was quite happy with the results I gave him with
the bcd version.

convert converted as advertised. The only problem is that the original,
and the conversion, are color inverted, i.e., white lines on a black
background. I suspect if I study the convert man pages I can probably
find a way to invert black for white on the fly.

tiffsplit did what is should, too.

plus all the USB and other modules.

   I want to use this camera to broadcast, and to record images to use with a

I've gotten some good responses on this thread.  I am constrained to
writing the app in java, due to deployment restrictions (it must run
in an Oracle Portal Application Server).  So I went with
java.math.BigDecimal.

A point was raised in this thread about how representing numbers as
strings is useful as a workaaround to the decimal rounding issue.
BigDecimal has both a double and a String constructor.  I believe that
the String constructor is supposed to guarantee that the BigDecimal
will represent the same number as the String.  This makes BigDecimal a
convenient bridge between String representation of numbers (at least
initially) and usability of the representation in arithmetic.

I've chosen a solution, but that doesn't mean I've heard enough on the
subject.  This is one of those fundamental areas of computer science
that ought to fascinate a programmer to no end.  Programmers can be
more artist than scientist, so they need to pay attention to the
science.  Finding a language that deals with the problem
satisfactorily and studying its implementation would be a good
exercise.

I like syntax highlighting, syntax sensitive indenting, 4 space tab stops,

  set softtabstop=4
  set shiftwidth=4

You should read up on these and try any or all of them.  The 'autocmd' is
especially interesting.
In my example, 'autocmd' applies an automatic indent after a newline
following one of the
syntax keyword phrases in Python (specified by  *.py and cinwords in the
command definition).
There is apparently a smarter indent control setting 'cindent' for c/c++
code that will indent and
unindent automatically based on syntax.  I've never tried that one, either.

Does the 'latest tagged version' have a consistent name? In other words, 
do you use a specific tag that gets moved to successive file versions as 
time progresses?  If so, then checking out to that specific tag is simple.

 cvs up -r{tag_name_here}

If the tag names vary, it becomes more complex.  I'd first ask youself why 
you need to do it that way, and if there isn't some way that the 'latest 
tag' can't be made to conform to a standard such that you could check it 
out by using a constant tag name.

(You might be able to do something with grabbing the tag out of the 'cvs 
log' command for each file being updated, but that seems like a 
cumbersome, fragile and prone-to-error method; a given revision can have 
multiple tags, and the first revision in the log may not be to the latest 
version in the repository anyway.)

Let me rephrase what you said to make sure I understand it:
Your eclipse plugin takes a tagname as a parameter, checks out code with 
that tag, builds it, jars it, and sticks the name of the tag into the jar 
name?

In our shop, we use the cvs -D 'date' parameter to check out code as it 
was at a particular time (usually a few minutes before the build starts).  
We generate the 'date' argument programmatically, and use a variant of it 
to identify the build packages (which are not jar files).  We log the 
'date' argument used, so that we can get back to that specific set of code 
later.  (We actually did tag every build for a while, but that became 
ridiculous.)

Can you get ant or eclipse to feed a date parameter to cvs?

Afraid I don't know enough about ant or eclipse to help here. Your problem 
sounds more and more like a limitation of the ant script (or of ant 
itself).  Your delete-and-rezip idea may be the most direct answer, even 
if it's not as clean as you'd like.

'Sticking today's date on the packagename' sounds pretty conventional to 
me.

Sorry, can't help you there. We write all our own tools for cvs 
interaction.

Thanks...most of my problem was not understanding what it was I wanted
to do. That's why I kept talking about conventions.

What we really want to do was check out the HEAD and then build and
timestamp the build without tagging the new build in the CVS repository.
Because it's just a daily build, meant to be the latest snapshot for our
users. We do tag our releases and interim releases and these are
supported. The daily build is not.

Renaming files does not work because the jar names *must* correspond to 
the Bundle-Version in the jars.

It turns out that the solution is to set the property
forceContextQualifier to the timestamp. And you can do this in the
build.properties file, which is a standard file in this headless eclipse
build environment. Or even in the ant file called by cruisecontrol as
follows (D means we're in a daily build).

<condition property="forceContextQualifier" value="${timestamp}">
  <equals arg1="${buildType}" arg2="D" />
</condition>

I hadn't known about this property ... but it's right there in the docs.
And the docs are written well enough ... there's just so much of them.

Comments below also.

Yes. The way the headless build environment operated was that you
checked out HEAD or a tag, built, and then either HEAD or that tagname
was incorporated into the build naming conventions. I couldn't see how
to break the connection between the tag of what we checked out and what
we built with. Well, you can see where to break that link but it's in
automatically generated files that get re-generated every time.

But there was a property that let me do this, described above.

This is good input ... thanks. An interesting and useful approach. Yes,
we were thinking abut tagging every release but projected that this
would soon turn out to be unwieldy. I want daily builds to be just
that ... a daily build to see if it works, but unsupported for continual
use. But there are users who want them. Supported builds are tagged.

I can't tell you how confused I got over this. But my confusion was as
much about build philosophy as implementation. Tagging a build with a
tag that was not a CVS tag seemed wrong to me; but I no longer believe
that (for daily builds anyway).

DNS and SMTP can be odd little beasties.

As far as DNS, the number of segments is limited only by the overall
length, so a host name like:

i.want.to.send.mail.from.a.really.long.host.name.example.com

is perfectly legitimate.

One other addressing form common when dealing with SMTP:
[192.168.1.1] - literal IP in place of a host name; must be in the
square brackets

Also, DNS names may include a trailing period. It represents the root
node, and is almost always omitted.

Just a few things to keep in mind.

I second Ed's advice re: c++.  If you know what you're getting into,
then more power to you, but if you've never written a sizable app with
c++, then I strongly suggest looking at other languages.  C++ is very
popular because of momentum--any language will do what you want (they

I suspect that the touchscreen is ruined and can't be dried out.  Is
the screen viewable?  If so, you might be able to survive without the
touchscreen.

Palm does have a repair page,
http://www.palm.com/us/support/contact/repair.html, where you can pay
for out-of-warranty repairs.  I am not sure if they will handle a
water damaged device.  My impression is that repairs can be pretty
expensive.

A Google search showed a couple of places which sell replacements
screens.  And a video of how to do-it-yourself repair.  That might be
dubious or a challenge but would be a last resort than replacing it.

Almost certainly.  I once replaced the screen in my Palm IIIci after I
cracked it and a couple months ago I took apart an already-broken Treo
600 and it looked like the screen was replaceable.  You will probably
need a Torx driver size T-5 or so; they are often sold as "cell phone
screwdrivers."  I think I eventually managed to find mine at Home Depot,
but only after looking in their tool section for way too long.

You can probably find information on the forums at <URL:
http://www.pdaphonehome.com/>, <URL:http://discussion.treocentral.com/>
and <URL:http://forum.treonauts.com/> , particularly disassembly
instructions and source for the replacement screen.

There are several ways to do it.  "x11vnc" is a X server module; I think
it might be the fastest option but it probably doesn't play well with
OpenGL or Composite (but in my experience, none of them do); "vino" is
part of GNOME and KDE also has one, although I forget the name.  If you
are using something else, I'm sure there are others that are not built
with a desktop infrastructure.

I think this is what you are looking for (x0vncserver).

I think I would find what I am looking for in xf4vnc.  Too bad there
isn't an amd64 port in the gentoo tree.  So still looking.

I'm test driving x11vnc right now, as I write this email.  It seems to
work quite well.  I'll look at x0vncserver too, since it's always good
to have a Plan B.  Thanks!

Well ... I *think* x11vnc works on Gentoo AMD64. It's kinda slow,
though. But you can log on to box A, start up a desktop, type "x11vnc
-usepw" and it will let you connect to that desktop from box B as
"xxx.yyy.zzz:0" with VNCViewer (or krdc, or ...).

That said, I usually just start up a VNC server or an NX server on one
machine and VNC viewer or KRDC or NX client to it ... I don't *have* to
go right to the main client. So far, NX seems to be a good bit snappier
than the other options.

Sadly, it is probably too late. Once the circuitry gets wet, corrosion
sets in -- and continues to develop. You may not see it right away, but
eventually it will rear its ugly green head. I wouldn't put too much
money into trying to repair this one.

During one of my lives as a "consultant" I worked the service desk at
AT&T Wireless. My task was primarily to process warranty repairs and
commiserate with those who didn't have a warranty. About the only water
damage that was temporary was if the phone was powered off before being
dropped into the water, and if it was immediately fished out, opened up,
and dried with a blow dryer.

   The linux connections on this thread are the use of jpilot for the desktop
version of the PDA's data, and using the phone to connect to my network.

   My question for Charles and other Treo 700p users is what I need to use
this phone as a wireless modem for my notebook. Not every place I travel has
free WiFi access, and being able to use the smart-phone instead would be
helpful.

   Seems to me that I'd need a shell account at my ISP to be able to ssh into
my network. Is that correct? On the physical side, do I buy the connecting
cable from Verizon or are there less expensive alternatives available?

I can do that with the Vorizon Blackberry. But it requires VZAccess, the 
software that Vorizon provides with the Blackberry, and you guessed it, 
Winders or Mac only.

Assuming your laptop has bluetooth, it's trivial. Just set up a dialer
to dial #777 (Sprint) and it'll work. (On the phone's bluetooth
settings, you have to tell it to act as a modem, and at that point other
bluetooth functions are disabled)

Works perfectly, and with Sprint PCS you get unlimited data, so yay. I
use my 650 whenever I travel. SSH is a bit annoying, because of the
latency, but once you get used to it it's quite usable.

Before I had the 650, I used a 3rd party USB cable to do the same with
the treo 600.

Mel,

   That's a fatal flaw, then.

   Looking at the details of the unit on the Verizon web site, I learn that
with the proper USB cable, their system apparently gives me an IP address so
I can use the notebook as I would from an ethernet or WiFi access point.

Thanks,

Rich

Mel,

   I think that's built into the 700p.

   When I return from this trip I'll go look at the unit and ask questions.
If I'm lucky, someone at the Verizon store will actually know the answers.

Thanks,

Rich

Charlie,

   I don't believe my 3-year-old Sony Vaio has bluetooth. And, I use Verizon,
not Sprint.

   As I responded to Mel, I think the phone and a USB cable will do it all,
but I need to spend time at the store and looking at the printed manual.

Thanks,

Rich

I've successfully used a Sprint Treo650 and Verizon 700P as a modem
using Bluetooth DUN.  As someone pointed out recently, Bluetooth
dongles for computers that don't have BT built-in are cheaper than the
funky cables carriers sell.

Caveat: I've only used the 700P from a Palm Foleo, not my laptop.  But it
should be easy enough to configure the laptop once I get 'round to it.

I USB Bluetooth dongle can be had for $10-$20; I don't know if it's
worthwhile or not, but I had to do work remotely a few weeks ago with a
company-supplied laptop and phone and there were times when the mass of
cables on the tiny coffee-shop table was hazardous.  It would have also
been nice to be able to put the phone higher in hopes of better
reception.

If you're with Verizon, though, I hope you have checked the costs of
their data service--it's absurdly expensive.  (I don't know about other
carriers.)  I use a dial-up account when I'm in a pinch, but it's
horribly slow (even for dial-up it's slow) and takes ages to actually
connect.  It's also sorta questionable whether those doing dial-up
should be charged for data rates (and may be surprised by in the
future).

You would probably get better help with this stuff on the forums I
posted links to in my response to Chaz.

Perhaps there's a pcmcia card that'll do the job.

   I've checked nothing yet. For the past decade I've used only their voice
capabilities ... and received three text messages.

   Using the phone as a wireless modem when WiFi is not freely available
would be nice, but not essential. I sometimes find myself with a long wait
at the airport departure gate, and access to my e-mail and the web would be
nice. But, it's never been essential and if the cost is too high I'll just
continue to forego it.

   I'll look at those after I talk with the retail sales folks at the Verizon
store.

Many thanks,

Perhaps this is a good time to begin a survey of such services. I asked
about Verizon's data service while looking for a way to get the photos
off my RAZR phone and found the rate to be similar to my Comcast
service: about $60/month.

What other services are available to connect to the Internet via a
cellular phone type of device, either a cell phone, a PDA, or a card for
the laptop? And, of course, what do they charge per month?

The price cannot be as bad as QWorst.  You get a whole 135megs (yes MEGS) 
for $39.95 a month.  And that is the high volume service. At the lowest 
level you pay 2 cents a Kilobyte.  (They don't tell you the rates until 
after you get the pda phone.)

T-Mobile cleaims to have "unlimited service" for $20 a month.  I did not 
have the time to verify the rates.  (They may get you for higher per 
minute charges elsewhere.)

Another good comparison would be the average age of the phones offered. 
Another place Qworst will come in dead last.

I use Tmobile, I have a pocket pc phone and pay about $20.00 a month  
For unlimited access to a DSLish (200k) speed connection.

The bluetooth is nice too, easy modem connection.

Sprint PCS - $15/mo additional = unlimited data (regular 256Kb/s speeds,
or EVDO if your phone does it, at ~1Mb/s -ish??).

This is the first time I've head of Tmobile's deal. That's pretty good,
except you'd be on t-mobile's network...

   I called Verizon yesterday to get details on service and accessories that
come with the 700p. They charge $50 per month for their data service; I
didn't bother asking about speed. For the very few times I'd use the
service, it is not worth the cost.

   But, I will upgrade from my Kyocera QCP-6035 which has been a solid
workhorse the past 6.5 years. If only the batteries were more reliable I'd
have no reason to upgrade.

   Thanks to all of you who provided information and insight.

Hm, I've seen plans for $70/mo.  That's also for 5GB of data--after they 
the think you're using it inappropriately and can terminate you at any time.

They make a game called Dirk Dashing which is incredibly cute and 100%  
Linux compatible.

I have it working on CentOS 5, although I turned selinux off to get it  
running.

They are only asking $20 for a registered copy of the game.  I hope they get
enough business to continue making gore free games like this ones for Linux.

You may like www.happypenguin.org  (the linux game tome).  It's a
database of pretty much all linux games, so there is a mix of
doom-like games in there, of course, but it also showcases many cute /
educational / puzzle games, and most of them could benefit from some
help, if you have time to write documentation, create art, code, or
even just play and report bugs.  (There are some very good open source
games up there too, such as Wesnoth.)

One of my coworkers runs Debian on his Core 2 Duo iMac with no problems.

I've heard that it's technically possible to run OS X in vmware, or  
the like, but it takes as much hacking as getting it to run on any  
other PC. So from a legal standpoint, is that okay? You're still  
having to circumvent Apple's restrictions....

I hope one day Apple will work with the many virtualization solutions  
to have them recognize whatever hardware mojo Apple uses to lock OS X  
down and pass it through to the guest OS.

I also had Verizon EVDO from Nov 2005, even when it was only 1xRTT in
Portland, and just barely worked with the mac.

After being a loyal customer, paying first $80/month for the first 15 months
or so, and $60/month until February, they booted me off (with 15 day warning
and no room for appeal) uncerimoniously when I exceeded the then-unpublished
Double Super Sekret limit of 5GB in a given month.  (I was in Buffalo for two
weeks, using 1xRTT to keep up to date on my few dozen podcasts.  Nothing
special.)

So, I walked across the street to the Sprint store, signed up for their
$60/month *truly* unlimited plan, and couldn't be happier.  For one, Sprint
has EVDO-A *everywhere*.  Verizon is EVDO-A only in a few select cities, and
*might* finish EVDO-A by the end of the year.  Oddly enough, Sprint customers
can *roam* to Verizon's towers free of charge, so it's not even a matter of
"coverage".

Ignore Verizon for being idiots, and losing my business.  Sprint is the winner
here.  Thank you Verizon for breaking my second 2-year contract 21 months
early, free of charge. :)

Don't worry, there's no URL for us HTML-capable email readers either,

The quick 'n dirty path to a sort-of-anonymous gmail account:

1. Drive to another part of town (be weary of CCTV at stoplights, maybe
use side-roads only)
2. Cnange the MAC address of your wireless NIC
3. Find an open/free AP
4. Use firefox tor plugin
5. Open a gmail account
6. Open a hotmail account
7. Send gmail invite to hotmail account
8. Open new gmail account
9. Rince-repeat with gmail invites and others (yahoo)
10. Once you have your final gmail account, only use tor to send/receive
email via gmail web interface (using only free/open AP's, but you could
also use home Internet if you trust tor enough)
10a. Make sure your cookie/cache cleaning is configured properly in firefox
10b. Use dm-crypt on your laptop, at least for /home

* Remember kids: A tinfoil hat has been tested by MIT to *amplify* radio
waves to your head. :]

I just stumbled across a list of graph drawing tools:

Message-ID: <c834ec80706131205g1a4483d6p28bcbfbac828c9d1@mail.gmail.com>

I need to build a site that (amongst other things) generates graphs
(node-and-link graphs).  Some of the features we'll need are:

* zooming / panning:  The graphs can be quite large, so viewing one
will not be a single-screen adventure, at least not at a level that
allows details of the nodes / links to be investigated.
* Node / link labeling:  The nodes / links need to have labels.
* hyperlinking: Nodes need to be hyperlinks (or something on the node
needs to be a hyperlink)
* automatic layout: The graphs are generated automatically, so they
will need to be laid out automatically as well.  There is no guarantee
that they will be planar.
* editable: This is not a high priority, but it would be really nice
of the nodes could be moved around and edges or nodes added / deleted.

All of this needs to happen in the browser, as far as the user is
concerned (I don't really care if it's server-side or client-side, but
it can not require any additional client-side software. So, I'm
assuming it'll need to be inherently Flash, Javascript, an applet, or
similar.)

Graphviz is the best looking option, since it generates svg and image
maps, but image maps don't fill many of the requirements, and I've no
idea how to display SVG in a browser.  Major props to any library /
solution that can be fed an xml representation of the graph and
hyperlinks. (Maybe I could just generate an svg version directly? but
how would it be displayed?)

aiSee (http://www.absint.com/aisee/ ) looks like it might do what I
need, but it is inherently a desktop app, and I'd really rather not
use a commercial solution if it can be avoided (although it is an
option).  JGraph is in about the same situation.

Does anyone have suggestions?  This is (unfortunately) for an ASP.Net
app, but I'd love to have (Yet Another) excuse to use a different web
technology ;).

Thanks,
Rogan

This is worth emphasizing: sometimes you really really want out of that
contract, and it's useful to have ways that are known to work.  

Perhaps there's a business opportunity here.  At my previous job I
wrote a little test app to gather stats on the performance -- latency,
bandwidth, etc. -- of the carriers we were targeting for a Palm email
client.  For a few days it had a bug such that it pumped out packets
at whatever the max the device was capable of.  I ran it for something
like 48 hours before noticing the level of traffic hitting the server.
I should package that app, bug and all, as VerizonOptOut, and post it
as shareware.  Or maybe the carriers would pay me not to post it.  :-)

More seriously, there should be a website listing ways to get out of
one-sided contracts.  For those with EVDO cards and linux laptops,
'ping -f' would probably be enough.

Message-ID: <e2aeccd60706140008l2cf7e32qb4b48261b12c2fb7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi List,
I decided to give Fedora 7 a spin and so its not gone so well. I downloaded
both the i386 and x86_64 DVD ISO's and both boot to the splash screen where
I can choose which option to use for install; graphical, text mode or
rescue. Regardless of the selection the image starts to boot vmlinuz, then
initrd and then drops me back to a boot prompt with the following: "boot:
dos call attempted".

Google so far has yielded little help other then pointing to possible issues
with syslinux. Any suggestions on what I might want to try in order to
troubleshoot?

Thanks,
Drew-

Drew,
It would help if you gave information on your machine.
E.g. CPU, memory, motherboard, CD make/model etc.
Question: Did you verify the CD you burnt?

Hey Bill-
I did verify the install media for each arch iso I downloaded and both were
said to be fine.

Machine specs
Acer 5102WMLi
AMD Turion x86_64
1GB Crucial DDR
120gb Western Digital drive
whitebox mobo as far as I can tell

I'm not sure if its the installer, the media or something else. I've
previously had FC6 along with OpenSolaris and Sun's Solaris on this machine
with no problems.

Last time I tried Fedora 7 the DVD was install only, not live. If that
is still true, why not try the live CD and see if that will boot. If it
does, that is some clue that it must be the installer, not a
hardware/driver issue.

Downloaded already :-)  had to come to work though (boo!) before I could
burn and attempt to boot.

Belmont Computers (http://www.belmontcomputers.com),
Enu (http://www.enuinc.com), and Pacific Solutions
(http://www.pacificsolutions.com) all appear to have 80GB and 160GB SATA
drives available, if their online catalogs are to be believed. And those
are the three local ones I checked off the top of my head, I'd be highly
surprised if other local suppliers didn't carry them as well.

Check with Pacific Solutions off of 51st and Powell. 
They usually have in stock a good selection of sizes,
interfaces, and brands. 

A woman named Linda owns it, and she is very
knowledgable about most hardware and software
platforms as well.  They used to publish "Computer
Bits" magazine.

Message-ID: <1181840543.12637.4.camel@localhost>

Folks, 

There are four of us on the FreeGeek LPI study group list
http://lists.freegeek.org/listinfo/lpi-study who are ready for an LPI
exam. Free Geek needs at least five before they're willing to give an
LPI exam. They may be able to allow candidates to do two exams in one
sitting (I did both LPI version I exams on a Sunday afternoon earlier
this year.)

The standard price for an LPI exam is $150
The price at FreeGeek is $40 - and that money helps fund FreeGeek.

So if you're interested and about ready to take an LPI exam, join the
list and let us know.

Thanks,
Mike

Subject: [PLUG] New xorg and laptops with external displays
Message-ID: <20070614192046.GA30409@gate.kl-ic.com>


I've installed whizzy new Scientific Linux 5, a Red Hat Linux 5 clone
that is a lot like Fedora Core 6.  It incorporates xorg 1.1.1-48 .

Unlike previous versions of X, this one makes full use of the dual
display potentialities of my laptop's mobile radeon chipset.  The
external display out the VGA connector in the back shows a completely
different "dual head" display than the laptop screen itself.  When
the right presentation software appears, this will be really cool -
I will be able to keep thumbnails on the laptop screen with a separate
display out the computer projector, for example.

But with 2007 presentation software, it is a pain in the butt.  I
would like the option to clone the laptop display to the VGA connector.

Is there any easy way to clone the display, to emulate the behavior
of the past?

This will become especially important when we do presentations at
PLUG meetings, as more and more semi-upgraded systems show up, with
the display on the laptop and blackness on the VGA connector, because
the dual head options are not properly set up.  

Keith

I run T-Bird on my Linux desktop and on my XP laptop. I have both set to
automatically ask me if I want to compact the folders when they get to
some certain size.

On the XP (and also on older, Win98 versions), I click OK, a little
activity bar do its thing, and the pop-up goes away.

On the Linux version, I click OK, and a little icon wanders off to the
left. Then I have to click OK again for the compaction sequence to
continue.

Does anyone else see this (or similar) behavior with T-Bird on Linux?

HI

I have a couple of domains....

And this will sound like a dumb question...

Does it make any difference what you call the name server??

Example:

On domain one...

ns1.domain_one.com
ns2.domain_one.com

So on my second domain could I use.

ns1.domain_one.com
ns2.domain_one.com


I am thinking it doesn't make any difference what they are called.

All the domains are on the same box connected through the same dsl box to
the net.

I only have one IP.....<registered/static to me>

No.  The name is just a handle to make IP addresses meaningful to humans.

There is, if you consider hacking your xorg.conf to be easy. I found
this guide very helpful:

There may also be some whizbang KDE/GNOME way of getting there, too,
but I'm not aware of one.

I believe a reload is required.

This should work regardless of distro:
apachectl configtest && killall -USR1 httpd

/etc/init.d/httpd configtest && /etc/init.d/httpd graceful
or in the Red Hat idiom:
service httpd configtest && service httpd graceful

I read a bit on this before responding, and it clarified for me the
behavior of the Red Hat initscript "reload" which merely sends a HUP
to httpd. I have frequently used this assuming this did not kill
running child processes. This doesn't seem to be the case according
to:
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/stopping.html#hup

Can anyone confirm?

Not true, kinda.  Legal characters for a host names are ASCII letters, digits and
the dash character. His ns1_server is not legal but the ns1-server construct would
be.

Subject: [PLUG] Cannot access MySQL with hostname but can with localhost
Message-ID: <1795603803.1181971587911.JavaMail.root@fepweb13>

MySQL ... I'm going a little nuts over this and I've been reading MySQL refs most of the afternoon.

MySQL is running just fine but I cannot connect using my hostname. My hostname is halibut. It is listed as such in my /etc/hosts. If I type hostname, the value halibut returns. If I manually start up MySQL with --log, the logfile is called halibut.log.

So as root I invoke mysql and issue
grant all on auth.* to 'myuser'@'halibut' identified by 'secret';
create database auth;

Then in another window as myuser, I issue
mysql auth -h halibut -u myuser -p

I get prompted for the password which I enter but then I get an error that says
Access denied for user 'myuser'@'localhost' (using password: YES). 
Son of a gun I didn't specify localhost.

Now if back in my root window I grant privileges to 'myuser'@'localhost', I can get in.

It seems MySQL will not recognize my hostname or rather always interprets it as localhost. If I look at the user table in the mysql database in mysql, and "select host,user,password from user" I see the myuser listed with host=halibut. And now that I added another I also see it with host=localhost. If I drop the entry with localhost, then I cannot log in as before.

Does anyone know why I cannot access MySQL using my hostname?
Thanks.

I may have missed this in what you wrote above. Do you have
$user@'$theboxyourconnectingfrom' on the database server?

You would either need to grant a wildcard user or otherwise you have to add
a user for each hostname you would be connecting from.

Just re-read your above post. For the localhost issue you need to add a user
for $user at localhost instead of $user at 127.0.0.1

Let me know if that makes sense.

Message-ID: <1537123632.1181981164236.JavaMail.root@fepweb13>

Thanks for responding. Here's what I did.

I invoked mysql as root and created a database with
create database auth;

Then I granted all permissions to a user as
grant all on auth.* to 'webauth'@'halibut' identified by 'secret.;

Then, I exited mysql.

Then, if I try 
mysql -h halibut
I cannot connect to the mysql server, even as root.

If I try (as non-root ted)
mysql auth -h halibut -u webauth at halibut -p
and give the password, I cannot authenticate. The error tells me that webauth at localhost cannot authenticate. 

If I grant all permisions to webauth at localhost (in mysql with the grant all command) I can authenticate (I try as non-root ted). But that's not what I wanted so I removed the localhost--webauth mysql user.

There is a halibut--webauth  mysql user in the user table for the default mysql database as shown below.

mysql> use mysql;
Database changed
mysql> select host,user from user;
+-----------+------------------+
| host      | user             |
+-----------+------------------+
| halibut   | root             |
| halibut   | webauth          |
| localhost | debian-sys-maint |
| localhost | root             |
+-----------+------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)

It appears that mysql does not recognize halibut.

My /etc/hosts has 
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       halibut 

But if I add the option --bind-address=127.0.1.1 to my mysql invocation as follows
/usr/bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql --bind-address 127.0.1.1

then when I try
mysql auth -h halibut -u webauth -p
give the password, I get get in (as non-root ted).

Apparently one can also achieve this by editing the bind-address line in the file my.cnf which for my Ubuntu is in /etc/mysql. I installed mysql from the Synaptic Package Manager and this is where it put it. The option on the invocation line apparently overrides my.cnf. (which has bind-address = 127.0.0.1).

This is just hacking on my part. I'm unclear on what is actually happening. And I was posting here hoping that some experts might shed some light. I did what I did by cruising the mysql blogs and forums and reading sections in the mysql online manual.

So actually it's working the way I want, but I'm concerned about having a kooky unconventional system.

Ted,

   I'm totally naive on the details of ssh, but it just doesn't seem right
that you could ssh to yourself on the same machine to which you are already
logged in. Unless you specified a different virtual console, perhaps. This
makes me wonder: if I'm logged in on a console, could I use ssh to log into
a second console on the same host?

   Are you able to ssh as ted to halibut from another host, inside or outside
your network? That would be a more realistic test of your setup.

Rich

Randy, let me betray a lot of ignorance here, but how do I open port 22? I shut off FireStarter so why is it closed?

Rich, 
It's OK to ssh to yourself ... just as you can ftp to yourself or rlogin to yourself.

wouldn't say we had "nothing at all".  Topicless AT meetings in the

`ssh localhost` is potentially different than `ssh $yourmachine` from 
elsewhere depending on the ListenAddress in /etc/sshd_config.  Try 
doing `ssh $somemachine ssh $yourmachine hostname` and see what 
happens.  Assuming the absence of firewalls it should work.

AFAIK, the only way to get "Connection refused" as an answer is that the 
port is not open/listening.  That is, `telnet yourmachine 22` should 
give you

  Trying 127.0.0.1...
  Connected to localhost.
  Escape character is '^]'.
  SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_3.8p1 Debian 1:3.8p1-3

That's when you hit ctrl+c unless you have the ssh protocol memorized.  
If your daemon isn't listening, you'll get "Connection refused" from 
telnet too.

You should be able to ssh to the machine you're currently on. It shouldn't 
inovle the router at all, just the local machine's tcp/ip stack.

What does the output of 'netstat -a | grep ssh' look like? On my machine, 
it's:

dcf>$ netstat -a | grep ssh
tcp        0      0 *:ssh                   *:*                     LISTEN      

If you don't have that, then sshd isn't running, and your machine can't 
talk to ssh clients.

Just for fun, I tried it on one of my systems (Debian) and received the

finally figured out that it was NOT installed!!!  Duh.  Installed sshd 
and now it works just fine.  I guess that little stuff matters :-)

Same here ... I of course had the ssh client but not the server. So I
installed sshd from the Synaptic Package Manager and now can ssh to
myself. Remains to be see what happens over the network, but I'm on my
way. 

Thanks for trying this out. I didn't have sshd installed either.

#Is sshd set to be enabled on start?
chkconfig | grep sshd

#Is sshd currently running?
/sbin/service sshd status
ps -elf | grep sshd

#is port 22 listening on your machine, regardless of the client?
telnet localhost 22

#what kind of connections are allowed system wide?
less /etc/ssh/sshd_config

other things to look into: what kind of connections are allowed for a

Subject: [PLUG] /etc/resolv.conf and DNS servers
Message-ID: <20070617044325.GC7376@gate.kl-ic.com>


This is a solution, not a question.  If you are setting up DNS
for your internal network, this might be useful to you.

The name server is the program that turns a text URL into an IP
address.  This is sometimes called DNS, domain name service.

I have a firewall that provides name service to the machines on
my internal network.  Outside, it connects to comcast.  After
migrating my firewall to a new distro, I was laboring under the
mistaken impression that my name server only knew about my own
addresses, and that my internal machines also needed access to
the external comcast name servers.  I was going nuts trying to
figure out how to write an /etc/resolv.conf file that had both my
internal name server and the comcast name server addresses in it.

This was a mistake.  The BIND named DNS server that comes with the
distro is designed to go straight to the root DNS servers, and then
to each domain server, and do all the name lookup itself, providing
an answer for the firewall machine and for the internal machines
without any need of the comcast dns server.  As long as the file
named.cache (or equivalent) is accurate, the local DNS server has
enough information to start the lookup process.  The most recent
update to the named.cache file was January 2004 - those root servers 
aren't going anywhere.  

So, the firewall machine's resolv.conf file should point only at the
internal server.  I hardwired the file, then did a chattr +i to make
it immutable, so some random process won't change it.  If the name
server fails, I do have a little bit of information in the file 
/etc/hosts ;  just enough to send a warning message to my internal
mail server.

Actually, it turned out that the old xorg.conf worked with cloning,
/except/ that I had my laptop BIOS set incorrectly (the primary
display was set for the external "PCI" video, not the internal "AGP"
video.  On the older xorg servers, that was ignored, but the newer
xorg servers are more capable and can split the frame buffers, and do
so.  The post is good, because it pointed at some valuable information,
and clued me in to read the radeon(4) man page, which tells what all
the optional parameters do.

In early December 2006, MetroFi launched its Proof-of-Concept network.
Caleb Phillips and Russell Senior had participated in a Portland State
University bid to independently test network performance, but the City
of Portland selected someone else instead.  Because we wanted to know,
we decided to do an interesting subset of the testing called for the
City's RFP anyway.

In late March, we presented some preliminary results at the monthly
meeting of the Personal Telco Project.  In mid-May, we completed and

Subject: [PLUG] CruiseControl and Dashboard
Message-ID: <1182117891.5467.18.camel@halibut>

Has anyone used the dashboard under CruiseControl? I'm just trying to
bring it up and the docs are very confusing. CruiseControl is working
fine for me but really would like to use this nifty dashboard.

Lots of stuff on how great the dashboard is but little information on
how to set it up. The only install info I've been able to find is on
http://geoffreyarnold.com/index.php/wiki/view?page=4

Here's what it says with my comments... (sorry about the frustration
that's leaking through). I'm willing to learn this on my own but can't
even find anything to read. The CruiseControl mail list archive has tons
of messages about using, zippo on installing.

1.
Start CruiseControl, being sure to specify the -port argument, ie.
$CC_BIN/cruisecontrol.sh -port 8000 -configfile ./config.xml

ted: clear enough ... this is just the standard way to start CC with the
JMX console. But actually -port is deprecated and -jmxport is
recommended. Surprising to see -port on something that is so new.

2.
Download and expand CruiseControl.wdgt-1.0.zip into your
~/Library/widgets directory.

ted: easy to download but what Library directory is he referring to.
There is a Library directory in the download. So does this mean there
will be Library/Library directories (seems a silly interpretation on my
part). The tilde leads me to believe that the library is in my home, but
that doesn't make any sense.

3.
Switch to Dashboard and launch the widget. If this is the first time you
have launched the widget (or you are upgrading from a previous release),
the Preferences panel will be displayed upon startup. Fill out the
required values and click "Save" to start the widget.

ted: I have no idea what "Switch to Dashboard and launch the widget"
means. I looked at the JMX console that came up (hoping...) but saw no
mention of dashboard.

Hello,
   I'm looking for a web log analyzer that will run on freebsd, has a 
browser interface, and has live filtering/"drill down" capability, for 
Free or for free or for money, bonus if it can output XML that I can 
query, double bonus if it looks good to non-programmers.

   By filtering/"drill down" I mean that while viewing the high level 
stats I can click on a directory and get stats (hits, referrers, etc) 
for that directory, I can click on a file and get stats on that file 
etc, etc, all live, all in the browser.  As far as I can tell the usual 
suspects of analog, webalizer, and awstats don't have this feature.

   Does anybody know of such a beast?

thanks,

You know, what I discovered is that if you download CruiseControl 2.7,
you get a dashboard directory in /cruisecontrol-2.7/reporting/ and
inside that directory I saw a build.xml, undocumented but it sounds like
ant, and so I ran ant and it started to build (making a dashboard.war
file that I think I can then run with Tomcat). Unfortunately, it failed
its unit tests and Tomcat does not recognize the file. But still
hope ...  the CC mailing list talks about missing files in the latest
download (for the very test failure I'm seeing).

Subject: [PLUG] End of an (uptime) era
Message-ID: <86odjdbvap.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


This evening, the neighborhood had an extended power outage.  Not that
long really, but 5 or 10 minutes.  Long enough to outlast the aging
battery in the low-end UPS a couple of my computers were plugged into.
When the last trickle of AC power left the UPS, the machine I have
been reading/writing email and occasionally working on for 3+ years
without a reboot took a brief nap.

On March 11, 2004 I built a then-brand-spanking-new 2.4.25 kernel and
rebooted.  Until about 8:15 this evening, the machine, a dual-proc 500
MHz (slot 1) P3, had been running continuously ever since.  In the
meantime, an unused IDE drive had died.  A front-grill fan had seized,
but the box was bopping along just fine until mr electron and his
many, many friends decided to take a break from their 60 Hz dance for
a while.

I had just this afternoon bragged at the clinic to the person I was
helping about the massive uptime.  I guess I jinxed myself.  It makes
me sad, but there we are.  An opportunity to rejoin the 21st century
with a new 2.6 kernel.  The king is dead.  Long live the king.  Or
something.

Subject: [PLUG] spam filtering: server vs. client
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0706180716020.20907@sphinktoo.pippiandcarlos.com>

My mailserver setup has spam filtering in place, but it has proven to
be inadequate.  Many messages are getting through the filter without
receiving any spam score whatsoever.  It is time to add bayes
filtering to the mix.

One can implement bayes filtering on the server, or on each client.
Server-side filtering is what the users want: a magical filter that
just works.  Client-side filtering puts the burden of filter training
on the users, but their filter is more acutely tailored to their
emails.

I envision a server-side solution with a small client-side twist.
Each user would have a folder called "spam" where they would put any
spam that makes it into their inbox.  The sa-learn job running on the
server would then look in each user's spam folder and learn those
messages as spam, and delete them when done.  In time, they would find
decreasing amounts of spam in their inbox, and their involvement in
the filter training would decrease as well.

The biggest potential problem with this method (or any server-side
method, for that matter) is that the filter is being trained on all
the users' spam.  It is not tailored for each individual.  There is
plenty of discussion on the subject of "one man's spam is another
man's ham" on the web.  My question is: is all this discussion merely
theoretical, or does it carry weight in the practical world?  Will my
users miss emails they really wanted to see if I train the filter on
all their spam as a whole?

There's also the question of ham.  Without ham, one cannot train a
spam filter.  Will I confuse the filter by using the ham from several
different users?  Or will the relevant tokens be discovered
regardless?

In short, I am tying to find a balance between theoretically correct
spam filtering, and practical filtering that does what it is supposed
to do: keep users from seeing spam in their inboxes.  This is the line
which I'm sure many of you have found.  Please share your thoughts.

This is a Mac OS-X "dashboard" widget.  The latest versions of
CruiseControll also features a "dashboard" view, but the two things are
completely different.  (http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/dashboard.html)

The ~/Library/ ... directory would exist if you were on a Mac, and it would
be in $HOME, as you suspected.

If you're not on a Mac, then you're SOL for the dashboard widget you linked
to, but the other dashboard view should "just work" (but it's just a
web-based thing).

Subject: [PLUG] 2.6.xx HAL automounting CD with cd volume name - yuk
Message-ID: <20070618174856.GA8780@gate.kl-ic.com>


Color me old-fashioned, but the new 2.6xx Hardware Abstraction Layer
(HAL) behavior of mounting a CDROM in /media using the CD's volume
name is annoying (and hard to write scripts for).  For example,  if
the CD is named "New Volume", it mounts as "/media/New Volume" (a
filename including a space).  

Here are some of the properties for HAL entry
 /org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/volume_label_New_Volume , extracted
with hal-get-property :

info.product                  : New Volume
volume.label                  : New Volume
volume.mount_point            : /media/New Volume
volume.fstype                 : iso9660
linux.hotplug_type            : 3
block.device                  : /dev/hdc
block.storage_device          : /org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/storage_model_TOSHIBA_DVD_ROM_SD_R2002

Is there something I can tweak so that the CD on /dev/cdrom always
mounts as /media/cdrom or /mnt/cdrom ?

There's at least one DNS-related RFCs (I've forgotten
which one) that says "any binary pattern" is allowable
in a DNS name part but, other than Microsoft, nobody
supports this in DNS software. Even the IDNA
(Internationalized domain names) folks use algorithms
that use punycode to ensure that name parts use only
letters, numbers, and the hyphen (dash). Still, it's
possible for people to claim, as Microsoft apparently
does, that any characters are possible in name parts.

I sometimes think it is because they want to be able to use 
"micros~1.com".  ]:>

Mostly they insist on using underscores for dns names.  (Not certain if it 
is because people use underscores in machine names or they just assumed it 
was correct in their first implementation and never went back and 
corrected it.)

It's RFC 2181, http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2181.txt ,
"Clarifications to the DNS Specification".

According to RFC 2181, while you can put any binary up to 63 octets
into a label, that doesn't mean that there aren't other restrictions.
For example:

- SMTP won't allow arbitrary binary in specifying a host for mail delivery
- Registries won't allow arbitrary binary in domain names, nor
probably in NS record glue
- Clients may generally puke

So, in theory, you can name your host e=mc^2.example.com, but there's
no guarantee that anyone else in the world will ever be able to reach
it.

I have learned more.  The automounting does not occur when my machine
is running level 3.  This is actually something that gnome (specifically
gnome-volume-manager) does in cooperation wuth HAL, so I can turn off
the automounting with :

 gnome -> System -> Preferences -> Removeable Drives and Media

And there are no options besides turning media automount on and off,
none that I can find with the configuration editor, either.  Fooey.
I just turned it off, and built some shell scripts to do it (and
sudo'd mount, umount, and eject so I can drive them as a user).

I bitched about this when they did it.  The "people in charge" ignored it 
and did it anyways.

There is supposed to be a way to request the name of the mount point with 
a command.  I saw mention of it once and it was totally counter-intuitive.

I will look again.

I've always liked Solaris' approach to this. Solaris will mount the disk 
at both /cdrom/cdrom0 and /cdrom/<Disk Name>. That way you can script to 
/cdrom/cdrom* and still have the easy to read listing in the file manger.

Thanks. You have no idea (or maybe you do) how confused I am on this.
Yes, what I pointed to was a MAC thing (sorry). I am trying to get the
dashboard to work with CruiseControl on Linux. I've been surfing for two
days with no luck. When you search for "dashboard" you get a lot of
irrelevant (for me) stuff.

I am able to get the JMX console up and something called the
CruiseControl GUI (this was a war file that I put in my Tomcat webapps).
And CruiseControl itself seems to be working fine.

Using the dashboard with CruiseControl on Linux seems to require editing
CC's config.xml, configuring a custom ant listener, and editing a
dashboard-props.xml file. But I don't really know ... it's hard for me
to realize what's appropriate from what I read and what's not.

When I downloaded CruiseControl 2.7 there was a dashboard directory
under reporting with a build.xml file. No helpful docs here, but this
looked like an ant file so I ran ant on it, and it failed some junit
tests. The CC mailing list said some files were missing, so I grabbed
those from the list and now it passed the test it failed but hangs on
the next one. Nonetheless a dashboard.war is created and so I put that
in my Tomcat's webapps directory and then tried
http://localhost:8080/dashboard but get an error.

The "CruiseControl GUI" I got from the CruiseControl home resulted in a
cruisecontrol.war after I built it and when I put that in Tomcat's
webapps, I get what looks like a pretty good interface. But I want to
try out this dashboard that I keep reading about.

I've read the link you pointed to on sourceforge many times. 

I'm not asking anyone to do anything for me ... I'm working pretty hard,
but I'm at sea. If you know of any intro docs on CruiseControl and
dashboard, I would very much appreciate knowing where they are.

He was pretty clear...

"drill down per-directory" was the requirement, which he said the listed
options didn't meet. So someone pasted him a link to one..

I haven't seen any that do that, probably because the file-system
directory is meaningless without the vhost listed. But that should be
possible..? I'd like to find something like this too.

Eh, hmph... Oops.  Guess I missed it the first time sorry.  Well, this 
is a tool I've seen that will do a lot more than what you're asking for, 
but it may be something you can use:

   http://www.splunk.com/product/205

That's a link to the demos.  It's not going to show you your specific 
needs, but it will show you some of what it's capable of.  It's like a 
version of grep with ninja skills on a web page.

I know that.  I don't expect a magic solution to all of my problems, I 
don't even expect an answer.  I did state in my question that awstats 
did not meet my needs but only a link to the homepage of awstats was 
given with no supporting information as to how it may actually meet my 
needs.  I responded, specifically asking if I was mistaken in that 
assessment hoping that m0gely would elaborate.

It sounds like you haven't read my original question, it's best to put 
forward some effort and read the original question too.

What do you guys use for remote access? 

I want to see a remote desktop locally. I tried out XDMCP which I read
has security issues? It works fine otherwise. Other possibilities are
tightvnc and realvnc (which I have not tried). I want to see a remote
Linux desktop on both local Windows and local Linux boxes. Suse docs
recommend realvnc on a Windows box talking to a remote Linux box running
tightvnc (strange combination I thought).

Anyway if you do use remote desktops, what tools have you had good
results with? Thanks.

Subject: [PLUG] can access an intranet site with Linux but not with Windows?
Message-ID: <1182232475.16714.49.camel@halibut>

Here's a curious Linux/Windows thing that is troubling me. I posted a
similar question on the .Net list, but discussions that have Linux in
them often remain quiet there.

I can access a site with Linux and not with Windows. Is there something
in my Windows configuration that's preventing this? I don't know where
to look.  (I temporarily turned off my Windows firewall and see the same
problem.)

One of the machines in my local network is a Linux box. On that machine
I have apache that serves up a site. I can access this site from that
same Linux box. And I can access it from another Linux box on my local
network. I put http://192.168.1.100/phpinfo.php in my browser, and see
what I expect.

However, if I am on a Windows XP box on my local network and do the
same (that is access from Windows the site on my local Linux box), I get
"Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage." I see the
same problem with Firefox.

Does anyone know what there is in Windows that is preventing this
access?

You now it's not the Windows firewall ... I turned off FireStarter on
Linux and made the connection. Now turning off FireStarter is not what I
want to do, but this tells me that FireStarter is not configured
correctly, I think.  But I wonder why another Linux box has no trouble?

We had an issue with firestarter earlier this year but I don't know which
version it was.

The issue was that we lost our ipsec connection.  But nobody had done
any changes to the firewall.  Turns out that when we ran firestarter even in
view mode it changed the firewall without use doing a save or change.

Thanks for responding. It turned out that the problem was that Firestarter
was not accepting connections from my Windows box ... don't know if this was
the right thing to do but what I did was open up Firestarter, choose the
Policy tab and under Allow Connections from Host, added the ip address of my
local Windows. The reason the connection worked from another Linux ox was
that the ip address of the Linux box was already there. BTW my Linux box is
a virtual Linux running under VMware on my Windows box. When the problem
occurred, it occurred for both IE and Firefox. So now it works with
FIrestarter running.

Thanks. Sorry but I don't know what you mean by view mode. I could not find
its referene in the Firestarter maual.
I got my connection by adding the ip address of my Windows machine to
Firestarter's "Allow Connections from Host"

OK, I am one of those ancient fossils who hates html email, which is
the spawn of Satan and his evil minions.   It is distracting, a path
for viruses to attack fragile html viewers, incompatable with some
ssh tunnels, and included files like graphics break privacy when they
are uploaded.

In order to read html email with fewer risks, I use w3m, which is
included in my distro (Scientific Linux 5).  w3m presents the html
as formatted ascii text.  It can be made to download graphics and
other inclusions, but I leave that nonsense turned off.

I had forgotten how to configure it when I upgraded my mail server
from Redhat-Prehistoric to SL5.  For those of you who have also
forgotten, you edit /etc/mailcap:

### text/html; /usr/bin/htmlview %s ; copiousoutput
text/html; /usr/bin/w3m -T text/html %s ; copiousoutput

Now html email shows up as text in your text email browser (I use
mutt, but this probably also works in elm and pine).

Most current email clients will give the user a choice of receiving  
email as HTML or plain text. I also prefer plain text email. I use  
Evolution for email and have it set to send/receive email as plain text.

   I, too, am an older curmudgeon. I have pine set to translate html messages
to plain ASCII text. Most of the time it Just Works; when it doesn't, I get
the usualy mess of tags and text and usually ignore it all by pressing the
'd' key.

A slightly less-old curmudgeon :-), I use alpine -- which is, in 
effect, Pine 5.0 with a much less restrictive license (the Apache 
license, to be exact). It uses libxml2 to handle HTML, and does so 
semi-well: text formatting and links decently, tables not so well.

For me, the big selling point in moving from Pine to Alpine is Unicode 
support. I want to read my spam in the original 
Chinese/Hebrew/Russian, thank you very much! Still no integrated GPG 
support, though, which is a fairly major bummer.

It was opening the app and looking at the configuration.  We were not
saving things back.  Just the process of opening a firestarter configuration
file was enough for it to kill our incoming connections.

I'll see your html and raise you a pdf and an msword:

text/html; /usr/bin/links %s ; copiousoutput
application/pdf; pdftotext %s - ; copiousoutput
application/msword; antiword %s ; copiousoutput

And when all else fails, mutt.octet.filter.pl will try to figure out

application/octet-stream;  mutt.octet.filter.pl %s; copiousoutput

Message-ID: <20070619194705.GA16739@gate.kl-ic.com>


For about a 15 minute period, I was having the damnedest time making
a simple symbolic link.  I had just downloaded the Citrix client for
Linux, so my wife could access some records at a partner's site.  I
wanted to link the Citrix plugin into firefox:

  cd /opt/firefox/plugins
  ln -s /usr/lib/ICAClient/npica.so npica.so

All pretty standard, right?  When I run the ln command, I get:

  ln: accessing `?s': No such file or directory

WTF?  Many combinations of ln command later ( /bin/ln, --symbolic,
copying /bin/ln from another machine in case it is corrupted, etc.),
I am getting similar results (sometimes a hard link shows up).  I
am able to make symbolic links elsewhere.  I finally made a symbolic
link in /usr/lib/ICAClient/ and moved the link.  That worked.

Of course, by that time my wife had left for work.  She is a nice
person, so I didn't hear any mutterings about Linux.  At least 
from her.

And Citrix "works", BTW.  Evil windows polluting her laptop.  I
feel unclean.

I took a break to beat my head against the wall.  When I came back,
I temporarily moved the successful link, and did the ln -s command
again.  With command line repeat, no retyping.  It worked just fine. 

WTF????

I suspect evil devils from hell.  Or angels protecting my wife from
windows.  They finally gave up.  Any other explanations?

Keith,
Very unlikely but did you check the md5  checksum on it to make sure
something more malicious didn't happen to it?

That, or a file system issue?

Or you have a file named - in that directory? (Though that shouldn't
matter..)

Weird, that.

Subject: [PLUG] help!  make usb keyboard stop working
Message-ID: <200706191345.38736.ewilhelm@cpan.org>

Hi all,

I can easily find the opposite answer, the problem that I have is that I 
want to plug in a usb keyboard (actually a magstripe reader (and a 
numeric keypad)) and have it *not* connect to the standard usb keyboard 
interface (I still need to be able to get data from it, though raw 
scancodes are fine.)

I can rmmod usbhid, but then /dev/input/event3 goes away.

How can I (with kernel 2.6.18, debian etch) setup the console to ignore 
a specific "keyboard" while still being able to read it (raw or 
otherwise) explicitly?

I would prefer a solution that does not involve writing a kernel driver 
(unless I don't have to maintain it) because it needs to be fairly easy 
to setup with a few instructions.  Possibly a udev config?

I think what I want to do is tell the console to only 
read /dev/input/event0.  How?

I've seen some pages about recompiling kernel 2.4, multiple keyboards in 
X, etc.  "Disable usb keyboard" and "read specific keyboard device" and 
similar searches are failing me (miserably.)

Thanks,
Eric

Well ... here goes:

1. Windows server, Windows client: Microsoft's latest RDC.
2. Windows server, Linux client: either rdesktop or krdc. There are
others, but these two work best for me.
3. Linux server, insecure but free as in speech: all versions of vnc as
far as I can tell. This includes vnc, tightvnc and x11vnc. RealVNC is
the only free as in speech Windows client I'm aware of.
4. Linux server, secure but free as in beer: NX from NoMachines.com
5. Linux server, secure and free as in speech: freenx.

What do I use? Talking to a Windows box from Linux: rdesktop. krdc will
work as either a vnc or RDP client, but since I stopped running vnc
servers on my Linux boxes, I've gone back to rdesktop.

Talking to a Linux box from Windows: freenx server on the Linux box, the
free as in beer NxClient for Windows on the Windows box

Talking to a Linux box from Linux: freenx server as above, the free as
in beer NXClient for Linux on the client.

Why did I stop using VNC? I had some problems with both "vnc" and
"tightvnc". Some of the server apps were crashing looking for libraries
with the vnc server but ran fine on the server's desktop. And with the
tightvnc server, I couldn't get all the screen sizes right -- for some
reason I could only get 1024x768 and gave up trying to get past this.

I did a cksum and compared to another machine - then copied the 
code for good measure.  Of course, if something really malicious
was happening, the executable and the visible copy would be different
and I wouldn't see a change in the visible copy.

I wonder if it's related to some file attribute. Per the chattr man
page, the immutable attribute is supposed to prevent links (but it
doesn't, at least on RHEL 5). But there are a lot of attributes I don't
really understand. Is there some weird output from

lsattr /opt/firefox/plugins

Thanks,
Mike

Keith,

If an alias for "ln" had been set, your binary would be as you expect,
But you would be running something else.
If this happens again, try "unalias ln" to see if the behavior changes.

Question: Had you been setting aliases for "ls" and miskeyed?
(I mistyped "ls" instead of "ln" during the composing of this email.)

Just an update for those that care...
As Richard suggests, the 700P continues to deteriorate.
Now it no longer responds to any of the keys, and the touch-screen will
register the fact that you touched it but that's all.
On the up side the screen is now very clear and bright (the light is always
on).
Looks like I'm going to have to break down and replace it.
Thanks for all the help.

In bash you can also prepend a command with a "\" to "unalias" it just
once.  eg:

$ \ls --color=always

Answer:  libhid.  Now with sweet Perl pseudo-keyboard driver.

Once you call hid_force_open(), the kernel hid driver lets go of it and 
you can attach it to any daemon, etc.  I did have to map the scancodes 
to keycodes (and then to keys), but for magstripe (credit card) and 
barcode readers, you don't want to apply the dvorak keymap anyway :-D

But the proper answer is
NEVER NEVER NEVER OVERLOAD BUILT IN COMMANDS.

You want an "rm" that moves something to the trash?  Fine.  Call
it "del".  Don't make "rm" do that.  That way, if you're on a machine
that doesn't have your "del" alias, you know it immediately, instead
of invoking rm, wanting to recover, and then finding out that it's
"oh no!" the *real* rm.

*And* you don't run into problems like this, with "ln" not really meaning the
textbook "ln".  Feh.

I don't know why this is a hard concept to understand for people.  Maybe
they've just seen too many bad examples over the years.

Well for the case of your examples, sure, I agree. But overloading ls
with 'ls -F --color=always' is quite harmless, for example. I'm sure
there's many other cases where it's harmless too, so saying "NEVER"
isn't really necessary :)

Subject: [PLUG] Mouse click crashes X (I think)
Message-ID: <20070621111205.d26170fc.johnxj@comcast.net>

Ubuntu Feisty amd64, completely up to date
Compaq R3240 laptop, nVidia GeForce 4, plenty of free disk space, 1.25 GB RAM.
Logitech USB wireless notebook mouse

For a long time I have had a problem of getting suddenly logged out. That is, I assumed I was being logged out, but now I think it's really just X crashing and restarting. The reason I now think X is crashing is because occasionally I see a bit of command line just before the GUI login screen comes back up. Usually it's too fast to see any command line text, although the screen does go black for a moment before the login screen comes back up. When I do see text it is too fast to read it. It looks the same as if I press Ctrl-Alt-Bksp.

This started happening after upgrading to Edgy last December, and continues under Feisty. If I am using the computer all day long it will happen probably once during the day. It never happens as a result of keyboard input. The trigger is always a regular left mouse click. 

It happens most often in Firefox, but that's probably because Firefox is where I use the mouse a lot. It also seems that the more tabs I have open and the more other programs I have running, the more likely it is to happen. Yet, it has been known to happen even when Firefox is the only program running and I have only one tab open. It also happens with other programs besides Firefox, some more so than others. I have one small program used for testing language skills with children (Bubble Dialogue) running under Crossover Office and it will crash X within 30 minutes, unless I never use the mouse. However, I can't recall it ever happening with other programs that I use under Crossover Office. It is rare for it to happen with OpenOffice.org and I don't think I've ever had it happen with Sylpheed (mail client). The point is that I cannot come up with a pattern for when it happens that would lead to a diagnosis. I'd be thrilled if it was just one program, or just one kind of windo!
 w item I was clicking on -- anything that would give me a clue.

I prefer the nVidia driver, but switching to the nv driver makes no difference. Desktop is Gnome 2.18.1, 4/11/2007.

The computer does not have a port for a wired mouse, so my only options for testing are other USB mice, of which I have none. The built-in touchpad is Synaptic and it loads during boot and works fine, but it has a physical on-off switch and I always leave it turned off. I am unable to use the touchpad effectively due to poor finger motor control (you should see what I pass off as handwriting). I use the touchpad only for emergencies when I left the mouse at home or its batteries died. 

It is definitely not a random keypress, as it can happen when I am using the mouse and my other hand is resting in my lap.

After it happens and I log back in again I have run dmesg and found nothing unusual.

I have spent hours googling and have turned up only one post from 2005 with two responses from others, neither of which offered a solution, and no followup from the original poster. I posted about a month ago on Ubuntu forums, but got no response.

I have been trying different things since last December, but so far have not even been able to figure out what is causing it, let alone how to fix it. I'm out of ideas, so maybe someone can give me a fresh direction to look for the answer. All suggestions welcome.

<snip>
Sounds like the USB  bits maybe. Can you see what is in /var/log/X.log ?
probably going to be /var/log/X.log.0 ect of which the crash info should be
in there.

I have several USB meese of which you're welcome to have one just let me
know how/where/when to get it to you.

<snip problem description>

It's been my experience that weird semi-inexplicable problems are more often
than not rooted in hardware. What you describe sounds an awful lot like
dodgy RAM. I'd suggest running the memtest86 that ubuntu includes in the
grub menu overnight (or longer) to at least rule it out as a suspect.

I was having similar chronic computer crashiness some months ago. I gave the
RAM a good thorough test, and after running for about 12 hours, one of the
modules started throwing errors. Got it replaced under warranty, and I
haven't had a problem since.

I've seen similar situations play out that way a number of times.

My experience has been poor hardware driver support. If you are using  
Feisty in AMD64, then that is likely the problem. I have a 32-bit of  
Feisty running on an AMD64 box with no mouse hardware problems. Maybe  
Ubuntu should not of used the name "Feisty" for their current version  
release ;)

I just got a new Proliant DL360 at work. Really nice machine, super fast.
Everything seems to be working fine, however, every second or so a virtual
USB hub and keyboard connects and disconnects, causing a bunch of noise in
dmesg. It seems to be part of the iLO2 system, but it's driving me nuts, the
dmesg pollution make tracking other hardware events really difficult. Has
anyone else out there seen this behavior, or even better, found a workaround
that doesn't involve breaking iLO2?

I found several files in /var/log, although they are named Xorg.n.log. I opened the one with the most recent timestamp, which was yesterday at about the time I logged back in again after a reboot. Unfortunately, it is long and I don't understand much of what is in it. It would take a month of studying how X works to figure out what all the lines mean. I don't see anything relating to the crash. The previous one does not help either because it says a the end "Fatal server error: no screens found." That is because I tried a suggestion I found elsewhere to use "pci=assign-busses" and the result was that X wouldn't start.

I did notice a bunch of stuff related to Wacom, ending with "unable to find device." I noted this because I have seen that in dmesg as well. For some reason Ubuntu thinks I have a Wacom tablet, even though there has never been one near this computer. I have been seeing messages relating to Wacom during the boot process since at least Dapper, probably forever. It may not be the source of the problem, but if I don't have a Wacom tablet I should figure out how to make the boot process stop trying to load a driver for it. I mean, just on general principles.

As for the mouse, there are several references in the Xorg.0.log file to the Synaptics touchpad and it seems to be loaded properly. (Of course it is loaded, it works! Duh!) However, the only reference I see to anything else is a line that includes "Explorer PS/2." (The boot process does mention Logitech, however.) So that makes me think that X is taking the external mouse input as though it is the Synaptics touchpad.

> I have several USB meese of which you're welcome to have one just let me

I may take you up on that. But I know the problem is not mechanical with the mouse, because the mouse I am using right now is the third that I have bought. I dropped the first one and broke it, and the scroll wheel failed on the second one. The current one is brand new, but the problem happened with all three. Since it is a Logitech, to test things properly I assume I should try a brand that uses a different driver.

I also take to heart your comment about the USB bits. I have long had a problem making backups to external USB drives. Usually it goes OK, but frequently I will get lockups. Happens whether I use tar, rsync, dar or just a plan cp command. So I assumed the problem has something to do with extended continuous data transfers over the USB ports. I've never gotten to the bottom of the problem. I just make backups now to another Linux PC using nfs. 

(Interscript: the computer I make backups to over nfs is the computer with the evil Abit board. I recently gave up on it, took it back to Fry's and swapped it for an Asus. Haven't reassembled the computer yet. Stay tuned.)

Re Quentin's suggestion on the RAM. It is a good suggestion, but dodgy RAM should also cause miscellaneous other nefarious things to happen, and I have no other such problems. However, the computer came with two 256 meg SODIMMs and I replaced one with a 1 GB SODIMM. They are different brands and different sizes. Theoretically, that should make no difference. But we all know how theories work. Hence, when I go to bed this evening I will reboot it with memtest and run it all night at least.

Re Kenneth's suggestion that it is the driver, I have to put the driver at the bottom of the list of possibilities. This is, after all, a Logitech mouse. If the Logitech driver was defective, even the amd64 version, the screaming would be melting internet connections worldwide. Having said that, it is very possible that I am loading the *wrong* driver. I guess I need to research which driver I am supposed to be using.

Thanks for the suggestions.

Message-ID: <467B06CB.3050600@acm.org>

We just got a system with an Intel BLKDG965RYCK main board.  Can't get 
it very far into the install process.  It keeps asking for an device to 
install from.  This is with every Redhat-ian distribution we can find.

A Samsung DVD/CD Writer on the IDE controller and every conceivable 
combination or hard drives.
    Started with a SCSI host adapter (Adaptec), went to a SATA drive 
connected to the on board controller, finally a plain old IDE drive on 
the IDE chain with the DVD/CD drive.

We have also tried a simple 52X CD ROM drive and that too went horribly 
wrong.

Anyone familiar with this MB?  Any joy installing Linux on one?  It's 
beginning to feel like a hardware issue.


TIA,
Rod

Have you tried booting with "noapic"?

Don't remember seeing this option (and it's all a blur right now :-)? 
BIOS setup or boot option?

Kernel boot option.  Tends to fix booting issues on some Intel 
motherboards.

Found it referred to from a search using Google.  Sad part is there is 
_no joy_.  Didn't work.  Even tried a 'noapci'.

Thanks for the clue.

It happened again, just now. After logging back in I opened Xorg.0.log.old (because I new one was created the instant X restarted), and found the following at the end:

Backtrace:

Fatal server error:

I know this is exactly all that was added with the crash because the line previous to this was at the end of the file when I looked at it earlier this afternoon.

Now all I need to do is figure out what it means and how to fix it. :)

X is  catching a fatal error and dying obviously. Looks like its tied to
libfb which is the generic Xorg frame buffer module and the Xorg Nvidia
module. Are you using the Xorg Nvidia driver or the proprietary one?

I'm currently using the nVidia proprietary driver, which I prefer because it is faster. But I have used the nv open source driver and have the same problem.

   I bought a Treo 700p yesterday and am trying to restore the PDA databases
from jpilot on the desktop. However, when I plug in the USB cable to the
front of the machine, /var/log/messages shows it attached to both
ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB1:

Jun 22 05:59:30 salmo kernel: usb 1-4: new full speed USB device using
ohci_hcd and address 17
Jun 22 05:59:30 salmo kernel: usb 1-4: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
Jun 22 05:59:30 salmo kernel: visor 1-4:1.0: Handspring Visor / Palm OS
converter detected
Jun 22 05:59:30 salmo kernel: usb 1-4: Handspring Visor / Palm OS converter
now attached to ttyUSB0
Jun 22 05:59:30 salmo kernel: usb 1-4: Handspring Visor / Palm OS converter
now attached to ttyUSB1

   Never before have I seen this.

   There is no /dev/ttyUSBn, but there is /dev/tts/USB0 and /dev/tts/USB1.
Also, in /etc/udev/rules.d/udev.rules, there is the line,

KERNEL="ttyUSB[0-9]*",  NAME="tts/USB%n", GROUP="tty", MODE="0660"

   It was suggested to me by David Desrosiers, the author of pilot-link, that
I change the KERNEL value to "tts/USB[0-9]*", but that made no difference.

   I'd really appreciate an explanation of what's going on and what I should
do to get a connection on only a single port so I can restore data to the
PDA.

TIA,

Rich

IIRC, this is normal for palm-like deivces. My old Clie did this, and so did
my visor, and my newer clie. I saw an explanation a long time ago, but I
don't remember exactly what it was. I'm surprised that David D didn't seem
to know about it. I just tried both of them when syncing, and one or the
other would work. Sometimes they would flip-flop, requiring a reconfig of my
client.

Quentin,

   Perhaps it's normal with the newer Palms, but not with the older ones.

   I made the link /dev/pilot to point to /dev/tts/USB1, and it almost worked
(same with /dev/tts/USB0). What I see now is:

dlp_ReadSysInfo error
Exiting with status SYNC_ERROR_PI_CONNECT

which looks like a permissions error. However, /dev/pilot is owned by
me as a user, and so are /dev/tts/USBn. Any other insight?

Many thanks,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] Sheet Music Concordance Project
Message-ID: <467BEEB1.40008@comcast.net>

I'm looking for ideas on how to deal with a text search task involving a
growing collection of vocal solo music. Each piece of music would have
to be manually entered into the system. Once in, the system would allow
the user to enter a word or phrase and then return a list of the solos
containing that word or phrase. Selecting one of them would display the
text of the solo, and highlight the word or phrase.

The ideal situation would be a web based tool, with the data on the
user's computer, as opposed to a server on the Internet. I am prepared
to install Apache, PHP, and MySQL on each of the users' computers --
there would only be 2 or 3.

Is anyone familiar with something that sounds like it can do this? If
not, any recommendations on whether this makes sense as a data base
project or some other approach would be appreciated.

Thanks.

It would be simpler if the music were saved in a text format.  Lilypond
and MusicXML come to mind as options.  There are GUI editors that a user
can use to enter music graphically, and then save it in one of these text
formats.  Or, if the user is a real pro, they could almost go faster
writing a lilypond file by hand.  Then they could upload the text file to
the server, and the searching and indexing can happen there.  It matters
not whether the server lives on the local machine or the internet in this
scenario.

Thanks for the ideas.

Actually, the notes aren't of interest in this project, just the words.
The idea is for the soloist to be able to find words that fit a subject,
and then look at the notes of however many pieces of music come up in
the search. The paper copies of the sheet music are filed logically, and
are easy to retrieve. The purpose of this project is to narrow the
search to those whose words are suitable.

I've been building systems with Intel MB similar to that one for a while 
now. I have no issues with Gentoo, but in trying to install Windows on those 
boards I've run into a host of problems. My first guess would be to check 
what mode the SATA controller is in. Intel's controller has a couple of 
"legacy" modes to let Windows XP and older work. 

In the board's setup menu, under Advanced, under Drive Configuration:
ATA/IDE Mode: if set to Native, represents SATA devices as SATA devices. If 
set to Legacy, represents all devices as PATA to software, but I've had 
problems with this setting. 

With the ATA/IDE mode set to Native, an additional option usually appears: 
Configure SATA as: which has at least the options IDE and AHCI. In my 
experience IDE shows the devices to Windows as PATA, but Linux sees right 
through that. Windows pre-Vista doesn't understand AHCI, but that's what I 
use as Linux has no problems with it. 

If none of this helps (ie. none of the mode combinations get the installer 
to see your CD-ROM) maybe you can provide specific details about which 
distro you're attempting to install and I can give it a test.

Subject: [PLUG] Some CRTs to sell or give away
Message-ID: <courier.467C1A45.0000340F@gadgetrix.gadgetlife.org>

Hello all, 

It's a bit late for spring cleaning, but summer's just as good, right? 

I've got several CRTs in the garage I'd like to have in a good home (one 
that can make use of them). A couple of them might be worth money, but at 
this point I'm okay with letting them go for free if that's what it takes. 

I have these in their original boxes: 

* ViewSonic 19" E90 (1600x1200 at 60?, 1280x1024 at 75)
* Envision 19" EN-910 (1600x1200 at 75, may go higher at lower refresh rates) 

And these without boxes: 

* MAG 21" DJ920 with dual inputs (D-SUB 15 and BNC connectors),
      does 1600x1200 at 75 and 2048x1536 at 60, but the picture is a bit
      washed out at times
* NEC 17" unknown model (buried under stuff at the moment)
* Apple (Philips?) 15"
* Arcus 15" DA-156S 


I live in Hillsboro, but I can transport the monitors within reason. If 
anyone is interested, please let me know. In a few weeks they will probably 
go to FreeGeek or Goodwill.

Center Auditorium

 

Title: "The Games Shooters Play --Columbine and its Relationship to
Video Gaming"

 

Speaker: Dr. Jerald Block, MD (Shrink)

 

Bio:  Dr. Jerald Block is a leading authority on compulsive computer
use, pathological computer use, and "Internet addiction."  In his talk,
Dr. Block will discuss the chronology of events leading up to the deaths
of 15 people at Columbine High School in 1999.  He will review the use
of virtual reality and computer games by the two killers.  Dr. Block
will discuss his belief that one must be cautious when limiting or
prohibiting access to computers - that to do otherwise might destabilize
a person.

 

Dr. Block was trained at Columbia University as an industrial engineer
and worked in the software industry before entering Albert Einstein
College of Medicine to earn his medical degree.  He did his residency at
Columbia University & New York State Psychiatric Institute.  He moved to
Portland in 1999 to work in the Crisis Triage Center.  Currently, Dr.
Block is an advanced candidate at the Oregon Psychoanalytic Center.  He
is also on the clinical faculty at Oregon Health & Sciences University
and has a private practice in psychiatry.

 

In addition to numerous lectures and papers on the topic, Dr. Block has
testified before the FCC and the California Senate on issues ranging
from illegal file downloading to pornography and the Internet.

Dr. Block also founded a Portland-based company to better address the
problem of compulsive computer use.

Underscore works only with BIND8 and later implementations.  It used to

The search scheme in dotReader does the find+highlight in xml (inserts a 
css-styled span element around the found terms.)  You just need to turn 
your data into "books" of some sort (the formats are pluggable, so 
which one you choose depends on whether or not you want to write some 
Perl (or even python if you're so-inclined.))

As a side-benefit, you get the ability to bookmark/highlight/note your 
lyrics and share those annotations with other users online.

How about "open source and runs on windows, mac, and linux" with a 
standalone out-of-the-box executable?  Rather than a webserver, we have 
an xml engine that writes directly into the back of a browser (mozilla, 
webkit, (and I.E., but I'm working on killing that)) widget.

I don't know about that, my visor that behaves this way was made in the late
90's or early 00's, one of the first non-palm branded machines to come out,
IIRC. It uses AAA batteries, none of this lithium-ion monkey business.
Bottom line, it's pretty old.

But I digress...

Not sure... (asking google)

http://www.pilot-link.org/node/175
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=240449

Both sound related, and the second talks specifically about a Treo.

http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_USB_sync_for_Palm_PDAs_with_Evolution_2.0_and_udev

Might also have some useful information. What distro are you using? It
doesn't matter too much, except that it will differentiate between ones that
use udev or devfs. Depending on that, the process will be different.

Looks like this error is seen pretty often with Palm devices. Now that I
think about it, I remember having to go through a similar process to the one
described in the first link with my first Clie to get it to sync. For what
it's worth, I've never bothered with the /dev/pilot or /palm links, I've
always used the ttyUSB* devices directly.

Incidentally, I also found a link explaining the two connections. One of
them is for hotsync stuff, and the other if for "other capabilities", like
exporting filesystems, or making PPP connections through the connected
computer.

Thanks Aaron.  I'll pass this along to Jim who is doing (trying?) the 
install.  Off the top of my head I remember Fedora Core 4,5,6; CentOS 5; 
and maybe a SuSE or two were tried.  The preferrance is Fedora Core 6.

I don't remember us trying trying these combination but there were a 
bunch.  I think the operative word might be 'similar'.

Thanks for the insight and suggestions.

That error definitely makes it look like a video card problem. If you use
the generic "vesa" driver do you see this behavior? Be warned, it will be
dog slow.

You mention in your first post that the laptop uses a "Geforce 4" video. Can
you give any more details?

Some potentially useful information would be the output of "lspci -vv" and
"uname -a". Also, are you running the "normal" driver packages from Feisty,
or are you using stuff you installed from NVidia directly, or via a tool
like Envy or something?

pointers to more papers:

This is a thought-provoking article that most of you should read. 
It provides some real-world data to help make decisions about hard

Subject: [PLUG] prelink grumble grumble
Message-ID: <20070622233005.GA18743@gate.kl-ic.com>


There is a program called "prelink" that works with the program loader
to rewrite the symbol tables in libraries and executables for faster
loading.  It is turned on by default in Red Hat derived systems like
Scientific Linux 5, an RHEL 5 clone.

Yikes!

I do disk-to-disk backups with dirvish/rsync (I like dirvish so much,
I host www.dirvish.org  ;-)  )  and have started doing file integrity
monitoring with osiris.  It appears that "prelink" changes the
binaries and libaries while leaving ctime/mtime at previous values.

Just like a virus does, so prelink sets off all sorts of alarms.
Sorry, I would rather have slow, stable and safe instead of fast
and fragile, so bye-bye prelink .

I plan to remove /etc/cron.daily/prelink,  revert my binaries and
libraries with "prelink -au", then comment out all the "-l" lines
in /etc/prelink.conf so that the loader doesn't attempt to do it.

Then I will rebuild my backups, and reinitialize osiris.

Any flaws in my thinking?  Besides the usual, that is ...

The video controller, according to sudo lspci -vv, is:

I posted above just the video controller part of the output, but I should add that all the rest of the stuff listed is working fine -- ethernet, wireless, firewire, usb (with some misgivings), audio, pcmcia, etc.

Uname -a gives:

Linux Devil5 2.6.20-16-generic #2 SMP Thu Jun 7 19:00:28 UTC 2007 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Ubuntu installs as its standard driver for this video controller the "nv" driver; that is, the open source nVidia driver. You can install the proprietary nVidia drier "nvidia" if you wish. There are various scripts to do so, but I did it manually. I did it so long ago that I don't recall exactly the steps. I think all I had to do was install "nvidia-glx" from Synaptic, then a command line (forgotten) to make it the default. I can switch back to the "nv" driver just by editing the xorg.conf file and replacing "nvidia" with "nv." I had to do so once back in the days of Breezy because of some conflict. I have just kept the "nvidia" driver installed all along through the upgrades from Breezy to Dapper to Edgy to Feisty. Since it is in the Ubuntu repositories it automatically gets checked by Update Manager, so I know it is the most current.

As a troubleshooting step I did go back to the "nv" driver about a month ago. However, the problem continued, so I changed back to the "nvidia" driver.

After learning about the /var/log/xorg.n.log file and seeing the error message generated on the last crash, I am now convinced that it is some kind of problem with the video driver. Or perhaps better stated, an incompatibility between the video driver and the mouse or Gnome or usb or something else that causes X to crash occasionally on a mouse click. That being the case, after the most recent crash yesterday I decided that the first thing to try was to reinstall nvidia-glx. I did so from Synaptic, then restarted the computer. It has been running fine ever since, but that doesn't prove much, as it sometimes goes for several days before X crashes. I have been deliberately doing a lot of mouse click activity, however, including opening a lot of new tabs in Firefox, and even watching youtube stuff. So for the moment I am crossing my fingers. If it crashes again, then I will try a usb mouse of a different brand that does not use the Logitech driver.

   All my PDAs, including the Kyocera, used the serial port. My fiancee's
Handsprings and newer Palms use the USB port, and they've all worked just
fine.

   Tried this. It killed jpilot. Would not come back up because I upgraded
pilot-link and it looked for libpisocket.so.8, and didn't find it. When I
made a symlink between libpisocket.so.9.0.1 and libpisocket.so.8, jpilot
loaded ... but with no data in any application! Sigh. I have to get this
fixed ASAP. The data are critical to my business.

Update:

   I'll try again. I discovered that the installed jpilot will not work with
pilot-link-0.12.2. Re-installing -0.11.8 fixed the missing data problem.
Can't build a new jpilot with the latest pilot-link because I don't get a
full download of the source tarball.

   The saga continues.

   More when I have it.

I can't figure out how to get Nautilus to open new targets in the same 
window. It keeps opening new windows.  Kinda like Wind0ze

Any help?

Is there a particular reason you're not using the packaged jpilot  and pilot
link in feisty? that would likely be a lot easier than rolling your own, and
the version list for pilot link is 12.2.

Depending on what version you're running you might have to twiddle a gconf
key. If you are running 2.18 (maybe 2.16? I don't recall exactly when this
feature was introduced....) or newer though you can change the behavior in a
preferences window. Open Nautilus, go to Edit -> Preferences, and on the
behavior tab, make sure "Always open in a browser window" is checked. That
should give you the behavior you want.

Quentin,

   Probably because I don't do feisty. I've run Slackware the past four years
and it's stable, not feisty. The default Slackware-11.0 pilot-link version
is 0.11.8; Judd's Slackware package for jpilot-0.99.9 worked just fine with
Slackware-10.2 and -11.0 ... with the Kyocera on a serial port.

   I just re-built jpilot-0.99.9 using the upgraded pilot-link-0.12.2. The
Treo doesn't want to communicate on /dev/tts/USB0 and I've not yet tried
../USB1.

Subject: [PLUG] Debian 4.0 Networking Issues
Message-ID: <467F1DA3.5080801@frankhunt.com>

I am running a recently built Debian 4 system for web, mail, etc.
I have some XP systems and another Linux (RH9) box on the same network.

I have some weirdness:
nslookup, ping, firefox all work great from the XP and RH9 systems

 From the Debian system I get timeouts from ping, and the browser 
(Iceweasel and Epiphany) cannot find many sites (it works for some).

DEBIAN Example:

server2:/etc# nslookup howtoforge.com
Server:         68.87.77.130
Address:        68.87.77.130#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   howtoforge.com
Address: 85.10.207.148

server2:/etc# ping howtoforge.com
PING howtoforge.com (85.10.207.148) 56(84) bytes of data.

--- howtoforge.com ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 2001ms

XP Example:

$ nslookup howtoforge.com
Non-authoritative answer:
Server:  cns.westlandrdc.mi.michigan.comcast.net
Address:  68.87.77.130

Name:    howtoforge.com
Address:  85.10.207.148

$ ping howtoforge.com
PING howtoforge.com (85.10.207.148): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 85.10.207.148: icmp_seq=0 ttl=42 time=131 ms
64 bytes from 85.10.207.148: icmp_seq=1 ttl=42 time=130 ms
64 bytes from 85.10.207.148: icmp_seq=2 ttl=42 time=125 ms
----howtoforge.com PING Statistics----
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip (ms)  min/avg/max/med = 125/128/131/128


Works also on the RH9 system.

The same is true for the browsers.  Both Iceweasel and Epiphany fail 
find the howtoforge.com site on the Debian system.
All browsers tested on the XP and RH9 systems worked fine.

I use Comcastic's SMTP server for outbound email and that connection 
takes a very long time also.

Something is wrong with my networking but I do not know where to start 
looking.

Can anyone help???

Thanks

If you ping with IP addresses rather than hostnames, is the success
rate higher (like 100%)?  Look at your /etc/resolv.conf file.  If it
is in error, figure out why this is so.  Are you getting a DHCP lease?
Then why is your DHCP client (pump) not writing a correct resolv.conf?
Or if you are setting your IP statically, you need to do this
yourself.

resolv.conf has the proper dns server entries
system uses a static IP
Makes no difference if I ping with IP or hostname

I think so - looks to me like it is correct from what I have read. 
Here's netstat -nr:

Subject: [PLUG] Steadily growing firefox 2.0.0.4
Message-ID: <20070625035459.GD18820@gate.kl-ic.com>


I recently loaded firefox 2.0.0.4 .  I am wondering whether it is 
responsible for some every-few-days crashes I have been having. 
I have all the firefox extensions turned off for the moment.  

When I started it up 6 hours ago, it was using around 27MB.  It is
now at 70MB and monotonically increasing, even while displaying
only the basic Google splash page.   I cleared the private caches,
with no effect.  

I typically leave a firefox window ( or three or four or ten ) open
all the time.  This could be the source of my crashes, as it eats
up all my memory.  Any suggestions of other things to look at in
order to debug this?

Keith

I used a nice page that listed a bunch of config settings that limit the
amount of memory that Firefox can use. This isn't it, but it's got about
70% of what I remember using.

  http://www.aviransplace.com/2006/10/22/tip-reduce-firefox-memory-usage/

I too have a Firefox issue; when I first start it up, I can hit ^t and
get a new tab immediately, with the cursor in the URL bar ready to
accept input. After a day or two of use, I hit ^t and wait about 6 to 10
seconds (with the wait cursor) before I can type, and another second or
two before the history is available. I kill FF and restart it, and it's
zippy again. 

Any ideas? Keith, if you try the config settings on this page and start
to see the same behavior, please let me know!

This has been a standard feature of FF for as long as I can remember, 
even on the Windows side.  One of the reasons I still use the suite.

Use tabs instead? ;)

Well I just gave Fedora Core 7's LiveCD a try (that's all the close mirror 
had, or I would've used 6.) 

Booting from both a SATA CD-ROM and an IDE CD-ROM both worked perfectly. I 
even tried both run from RAM and run from CD with each drive. This was on an 
Intel D975XBX2 but the hardware as far as the disk controllers is very 
similar to the board you're using. 

Perhaps it is a hardware problem, or perhaps Fedora Core 7 has a newer 
kernel that supports the hardware better. Looks like this disc shipped with 
2.6.21, which is what I run under Gentoo. Although I have successfully used 
Linux as old as 2.6.16 on this board. 

Let me know if you want this disc. It's the KDE version, but I have no use 
for it beyond this testing. Or if anyone else is interested, let me know.

Look at Seamonkey ;)

But seriously, if Firefox 2.0.0.4 is leaking memory, that ought to be a
well-known issue, as popular as Firefox is. I've been Firefox-free (and
Thunderbird-free) for nearly two months now and the only thing I've
found that Seamonkey doesn't do is RSS feeds.

   I've not noticed any specific memory issues with firefox-2.x, but it is
measurably slower than was firefox-1.5.x. Pages load much more slowly in the
latest release, even local pages (such as with SQL-Ledger).

   Sometimes, pressing ^h doesn't work by opening the history window, so I
use the menu instead. Haven't tried waiting 6-10 seconds to see if it comes
up. I've not had a problem with ^t.

This does sound like a DNS issue. You may try using another DNS server other than the "comcastic" one.. Also you may want to verify your iptables to make sure you aren't blocking anything. "iptables --list"

Quentin,

   Harmless.

> In any case, I think I'm out of ideas...

   Thank you, though.

   I actually gained a momentary connection Saturday on /dev/tts/USB3 using
pilot-xfer to copy the AddressbookDB.* across to the PDA. Couldn't replicate
the event.

   What I need to learn to solve this issue is why the device number changes
constantly for the same physical USB port. And, how to lock that in place.

   Here's what's happening. When I first plugged in the Treo to one of the
front USB ports, /var/log/messages showed it was recognized and connected on
USB0 and USB1. The next time I plugged it in. /var/log/messages showed it to
be on USB2 and USB3. As soon as I pressed the sync button on the cable
(using the commandline for pilot-xfer to -p /dev/tts/USB3),
/var/log/messages reported the Treo connected on USB4 and USB5. When I
unplugged it, /var/log/messages showed the device disconnected first from
USB4/5, then from USB2/3.

   Why does the USB do this? How can I set that physical port to a specific
device (USB0/1) so I can then set jpilot to communicate on
/dev/tts/USB1 and have it work consistently?

Yeah I really miss the Live bookmarks feature.  But aside from that, the 
memory footprint of Firefox alone is often times more than Seamonkey, 
let alone running FF and TB both at once.  I also like being able to 
middle click a link in my email and have it open in a new tab in my browser.

The pointer got me looking in the right direction, thanks.  It turns
out that "this is not a bug, it's a FEATURE" in the minds of firefox
developers.  There is a firefox memory area called a heap, which
firefox uses for all sorts of things.  When firefox needs more 
memory - for example, to render a large image - it increases the heap.
When firefox is done with that task, it keeps the empty heap memory,
"just in case".  The so-called rationale is that if you run out of
real memory, some of the heap will just get swapped out.  "All your
RAM are belong to us", I suppose.  In the real world, this just
slows down everything else, slows down program exit, reduces
security, and increases crash probability.

You can limit memory, but only per tab/window, not for the whole
application.  And there is no way to tell firefox to let go of the
heap when it is done with it, or after an idle time.  This should
at least be an option, if not the default behavior.

Well - I know of one way to fight the attitude.  Link to this image:

Reduces security? Eh? Increases crash probability, eh?

Neither should be true. The former would require an OS bug, and the
latter requires either bugs or broken hardware.

But yes, people with limited memory will get swapped out more, including
possibly active tabs. Well tabs that haven't been accessed recently, anyway.

They could be smarter about it, but it really isn't a security/stability
issue. And if you have plenty of RAM it isn't an issue. Perhaps all the
FF developers are too well-funded? :)

This sounds like exactly the problem I had with my clie a couple years ago.
I managed to find a process that would consistently work. I don't precisely
what it was, but it was along the lines of:

-put clie in cradle
-power on
-start sync on clie
-cancel sync on clie
-start sync on jpilot

If I went though that precise process it would work, but otherwise it would
not.

I found flash (v9 I suspect) and firefox v2 leaked memory like a sieve,
especially if I left a tab open to a website that had rotating flash
ads. Firefox would end up eating up all my RAM and swap (which is a lot
on a laptop with 2GB of RAM), causing my laptop to go OOM and thrash.
Enabling the flashblock extension has caused firefox's memory usage to
plateau at around 350MB for roughly 100 tabs open; not ideal, but far
better than the 2.5+GB of memory it used to try to use.

Quentin,

   While I will go though such a convoluted process if needed, I don't
understand the USB port's shifting numbers, nor why this Palm OS device
doesn't work like the other Palm OS PDA we have: plug it in a USB port on
the laptop, find the port number (that host is running a 2.4 kernel, not a
2.6 kernel), and it Just Works.

Thanks,

Rich

  I believe this is similar to a problem I had installing a Wacom
tablet on Fedora 7.  The latest kernels have a new hotplug system
running out of "/etc/udev/rules.d/".

  The Wacom tablet was get caught by a general udev rule in the file
"50-udev.rules".  The correct udev rule in "60-wacom.rules" was never
getting hit.  I corrected the problem by making a new file
"15-wacom.rules" that got processed before the "50-udev.rules" file.

  It looks like your device is getting configured with the following
rule in the "50-udev.rules" file.
KERNEL=="tts/USB[0-9]*",        NAME="%k", GROUP="uucp", MODE="0660"

  You may need to create a udev rules file with a lower number to
create the device that you want.

Steve,

   I was pointed there earlier in this sage, to the file 'udev.rules.'

   I have these files in /etc/udev/rules.d/:

80-libpisock.rules  compat.rules.unsupported  libmtp.rules  libsane.rules
90-hal.rules        devfs.rules.unsupported   libnjb.rules  udev.rules

> It looks like your device is getting configured with the following rule in

   Actually, it should be in the Palm section of 80-libpisock.rules. What is
the order in which these rules are examined? Are the unumbered files
processed before the numbered two? Should I rename 80-libpisock.rules to
something like 5-libpisock.rules?

> You may need to create a udev rules file with a lower number to

   I think it's there, but not being read before another rule steps on it.

Thanks very much!

  Different systems... I'm running a Fedora 7 system.  YMMV

  I suspect the files are going to be processed in ASCII order.  The
numbered files will get processed before the letters.

  Not a problem...  I had to beat my head against F7 for half a day
before I figured out how to install the Wacom tablets.  It set a new
high point for really crappy Linux documentation.  I can truthfully
say the *none* of the documentation on the Wacom Linux site, Fedora,
or available through Google was any help at all.  The udev stuff has
completely changed the rules.

  Forget any documentation you've found, free your mind, and read up on udev.

The other thing Seamonkey has going for it is that so far, there isn't
the obnoxious hype, branding, flamewars, etc. about Seamonkey that there
is about Firefox. I point-blank refuse to run Firefox on a Windows
machine ... it's just not worth the effort.

For a brief time last Wednesday, some enterprising soul set up a
Windows Marketplace link for Ubuntu, with free downloads of the
"demo version".  More than 10,000 users partook of Microsoft's
generous free download offer before they pulled the plug. 

The page is no more, but there is still a copy in the Google
cache;  search for "ubuntu windows marketplace" and hit "Cache".

Giggle.

While I do agree it's generally not worth the effort to run windows, 
running firefox on windows can make your life slightly more pleasant

   It was announced on groklaw.net last week. I'm sure the lawyers will love
arguing (as long as they're paid by the hour) whether or not Microsoft has
officially distrubuted linux and, therefore, is bound by the GPL for that
effort. And, what does it mean to this summers "Be Very Afraid" tour with
the unspecific alligations that linux infringes Microsoft patents?

   Should make the official pundits and general bloggers quite busy for a
long time.

Windows?

I assume you refer to X-11?

Do people still use Windows? (on DOS or something as horrifying? Ick).

Firefox causes no problems on this boxen.

Especially given that the frequent reboots keep Firefox's memory

...

And here is a blog post from last year about Firefox memory management:

http://kevintwodotoh.com/2005/12/30/bugs/firefox-is-still-forgetful.html

Scroll down to the long comment by Robert Bradbury, below.  The problem
according to Bradbury is bad design of memory allocation, combined with
Linux swap behavior targeted for servers, not workstations.  Most pages
just stay stuck in the heap until the browser uses up memory and starts
eating swap space, at which point the primitive garbage collection 
algorithm starts going bonkers, continuously scanning swap space for
something to remove.  

Bradbury ( from Seattle ) suggests that instead of adding bells and
whistles to firefox (spell checkers, fer crying out loud), they rewrite
the memory model around mmap() instead of malloc() and take more
responsibility for managing the memory model.  Until that happy day,
Bradbury suggests tuning the kernel with  "sysctl -w vm.swappiness=10"
and quitting firefox before the system starts using significant swap. 
BTW, once firefox gets into heavy swapping, quitting can take minutes.

Maybe it is time for a fork, named like Ex-Lax to fix Firefox
constipation.  Ex-Fox or Fox-Lax?   I will put a bit more about this
up on my page at http://www.keithl.com/fixfirefox.html .

Keith,

   Have you tried swiftfox per Pete's recommendation? I put it in yesterday
and it seems much snappier compared to FF-2.0.0.4. I've not been tracking
memory use by individual applications, but swiftfox-2.0.0.4 has the response
of ff-1.5.x. That's good!

I use offsite virtual hosting.  I recommend two:

www.rimuhosting.com - Xen images for $20+ a month.  I have 14 virtual
sites running on one $30/mo Miro2VPS image, with wiki and subversion
and other addons.  Fast, but light on the RAM and disk;  I think I
am getting 160MB and 5GB respectively, not enough for a good torrent
site or for monsters like Plone.  I choose them for their excellent
service;  the answer is sometimes "no", but I usually get an answer
(or a server reboot, or whatever is needed) within 30 minutes of my
email, 24x7 .  They are located in New Zealand, their servers are in
Dallas, New York, and London.  Awesome bandwidth - 10Gb/sec into the
facility.

www.linode.com - UML images for $20+ a month.  I do not use this 
service, but they seem to have more offerings and technical capability
than rimuhosting.  Linode's support is weak, though, and if I need a
reboot or some such, I want it NOW, not tomorrow.  Linode might be
the best option for folks that are calmer than I am.

Both of these options require someone who can take care of a Linux
machine all by themselves - very little handholding outside of 
"here's your image, email us if it stops running" variety.

There are some local options, too, but they cannot match the 
technical selection and support levels of rimuhosting and linode.

Keith

PS - to get maximum mileage out of this mini-essay, I will post it
to the plug list, too.

I ran into the same memory issues with swiftfox as firefox,
unfortunately.  YMMV, I suppose, but I didn't notice any benefits.

Rogan,

   If they both use the same crude and inefficient memory management
algorithms, it makes sense that they'd be equally bad. Rarely do I have more
than 3 or 4 tabs open simultaneously, so I probably don't notice the
problem.

   What tool displays the memory use of a single application? Top shows only
those most active processes, and mmap appears not to be on this system
(although the man page is).

Thanks,

Rich

I took a look at the patches SwiftFox is applying. Looks to me like nothing 
more than about:config style network tweaks... they just set pipelining and a 
few things like that to different defaults.

Otherwise they are probably building essentially a vanilla Firefox with GCC's 
CPU optimizations for a bunch of different CPUs. It's an interesting idea, 
but doesn't help us Gentoo users much since we tend to do this by default.

I use top, pressing "M" will sort the processes by memory in recent
versions of top.  Firefox is always #1 or #2 and close behind VMWare.

Rogan,

   A-ha! I did not know that trick. Well, swiftfox-bin is using 6.0% of
memory, followed by spamd.

Thanks for the lesson!

The latest ICH-series controller I have running RHEL is ICH5 -- though 
I've had no trouble running RHEL on the Xeon-centric ESB2 controller.

Is there a particular point at which the installation halts or fails?

Will not see the hard drive... SDA..
So the install dies right there....

As I said before... NO problem with two other distributions.

Thanks for feedback..

I use gnome-system-monitor, which shows Firefox as currently using
139.6 MB (four tabs open). Second in line is soffice.bin
(OpenOffice.org) at 107.2 MB, which is just its "quickstarter" parts,
since there are no documents currently open. And third is Opera at 49.6
MB (five tabs). You can sort gnome-system-monitor on any of the
headings by clicking on the heading, so you can have all the apps
sorted on memory amount if you wish. Surely in other desktops there is
an equivalent utility?

Since this trhead started I've been watching Firefox (2.0.0.4). The max
memory I've seen it use is 210 MB, and that was with 14 tabs open. It's
true, however, that when I close tabs it doesn't seem to release all
the memory. At the same time, 14 tabs is tops for me. Someone else said
he had a hundred tabs open. How do you even find a tab when you have
that many open?

I must also suggest Opera for those who want something full-featured
but less piggish. It runs slower than Firefox for me, but that's
probably because it's 32-bit and Firefox is 64-bit.

Does the BIOS mention a legacy/compatible/IDE vs. native/enhanced mode
for the SATA controller?

If so, try toggling that.

It does nothing about memory, it is just a speed fix.  SwiftPIG
might be more apt.  Sigh.

Developments - I emailed Robert Bradbury, and he put up a nice
description of the problem on my wiki:

http://wiki.keithl.com/index.cgi?FireFoxMemoryBug

Now I have something better than blog comments to link to.

On another list, I found out that Firefox isn't even reporting all
the memory it grabs - many of the images are rendered into Xorg memory,
so you will probably see X increasing in size along with Firefox.  

Robert is another of those ultrabusy serial entrepreneur types - he 
would like to spend some time rebuilding the Firefox memory allocation
system, but has no time.  He says that FF3 will be slightly better -
at least the bookmarks will be kept in a separate database, not part
of the heap - but the major memory problems remain and are systemic.

It will be nice if the Google Summer of Code has some projects to
address this problem - after all, you can't get at Google's product
without a browser!

One thing that would be relatively simple is to make the firefox icon
in the Gnome panel blink or change color when Firefox is getting bloated.
Users could click on the blinking icon, and the session will quit and
reload.  A bandaid, but a useful one.

In the meantime, save those sessions, and restart often.

"top" can do it. I forget the magic code, but, start up "top" and hit
the "?" key. It will open a somewhat cryptic panel, but IIRC there's a
character you can type to make it sort on descending RSS ("real memory")
or VSZ ("virtual memory").

This top tip was brought to you by the letters "O" and "N". :)

Quentin,

   I _think_ that's what I did to allow pilot-xfer to work. First
/var/log/messages showed the ports changing from 0/1 to 2/3, but then it
changed back to 0/1 when I canceled on the PDA and pushed the sync button
again.

   Anyway, I now have all five databases (address, calendar, to-do, memos,
and expenses) on the Treo. After I modify any of them, I'll try syncing
using the sequence above, except that I don't need to turn the power on for
the phone.

Thanks,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] Scanner problem and cure
Message-ID: <20070627191213.GA4019@gate.kl-ic.com>


One of my older machines has a UMax 1200 SCSI scanner on it.  Three
years ago, I upgraded it from RedHat 9 to Fedora Core 1.  Two weeks
ago, I upgraded it from FC1 to a RedHat Enterprise 5 clone.   When
I tried to use the scanner yesterday, the machine froze hard;  it
wouldn't even respond to the power switch, I had to pull the plug.

After frobbing around a bit, the cure was to delete the .xsane
directory (probably originally for RH9) in my home directory, and
let the current version of xsane build a new one.

It irks me that a user-space program can lock up the machine (that
is so, so M$ ), but at least there is a cure.

The whole issue of home directories, dot files, and upgrades is 
irksome.

On the one hand, it's cool to be able to keep $HOME across upgrades. 
Documents, e-mail, projects -- they all migrate fairly cleanly.

Then there are config files.

I remember moving from Red Hat 7.x to 9. My home directory was kept 
intact through the move. Everything looked the same after the upgrade.

Then I installed a new user account and logged into it. I saw all 
sorts of cool graphics and applets that were invisible to my regular 
account. My old, but workable, configs had limited my access to new 
features.

I ended up tarring $HOME off to a safe place, blowing it away and 
recreating it from /etc/skel, and logging in to the functionally new 
account. Then I cherry picked the data and configs that I still needed 
from my tarball.

It's not a Linux problem per se. Regardless of OS, it's just a problem 
with static configs across upgrades.

       Well, I was debating whether to go from dapper drake to edgy eft 
on my new laptop, (have 6.06 may go to 6.10)
    noted at least three games that did not work in 6.06 that did work 
in the mac version of 6.10.

    I am curious whether the upgrade is as smooth as the upgrade from 
win-95 to win-98 or as rough as win-98 to win-2000
    (clearing everything and starting afresh)  (opens the laptop and 
touches off a little bit of flash paper. looks around and says
    It's Windows. it does that. )

Subject: [PLUG] POE server startups.
Message-ID: <468403CD.3050606@acm.org>

I asked on the Portland Perlmongers but got no replies so I'll bother 
folks on this list.  Sorry for the overlap.

I have created a POE based server (a framework for creating event-driven 
multitasking programs in Perl not PoE - Power over Ethernet) and now 
need to have it started when the system starts and kept up and running.

I'm still pretty new to POE servers and have not found this addressed in 
the docs ... so far.

Anyone worked up a non-traditional service server?  Non-traditional as 
in being written in something besides C/C++ or another compiled language?

I've looked at an entry in /etc/inittab, /etc/rc.d/rc.local, or using a 
System-V type script.  Not sure of the pros and cons of each of these.

Any suggestions?


Thanks,
Rod

Subject: [PLUG] Fonts
Message-ID: <20070628115949.8c081937.johnxj@comcast.net>

I can't believe I can't find the answer, but an hour of searching
Ubuntu forums and googling has revealed only out of date information.

Problem: I need to print a PDF file created by a somewhat inept
linguistics professor. He used a couple of old TTFs that contains the
appropriate IPA characters, but not in the standard Unicode slots.
Instead, the fonts come with a "template" which tells you how to type
characters. For example, to type a schwa (hex 1DD, decimal 477) you
type a capital E. He did all this in MS Word and exported to PDF with
Acrobat 4.0. No matter what he does he cannot seem to get Acrobat to
embed the fonts.

The font license allows him to send me a copy of the fonts for printing
purposes, and he did so. I put the fonts into ~/.fonts and they appear
fine in OpenOffice.org and other similar programs. However, Adobe
Reader 7.08 does not see them. In Adobe Reader you can (theoretically)
type Ctrl-Shift-Y and it will tell Reader to use local fonts, but this
does not work.

Next, I tried Evince, Kpdf and Xpdf. They found the fonts and display
them correctly on screen, but print the "capital letters" from the
template. In other words, they are using the locally installed fonts
for screen display, but failing to use locally installed fonts for
printing. In the world of PDF, this is a serious no-no, but I can't
wait for someone to fix the program code. For what it's worth, I think
they are using Ghostscript for print output.

What I want to try next is to install the fonts globally for all users,
instead of just in my ~/.fonts folder. My hope is that doing so will
make Adobe Reader see them. However, I cannot figure out what folder to
put them in to make them globally available to everyone and every
program. Does anyone know what folder I need? And is there anything
else I need to do besides just dropping them into the folder? Does
anyone have any further suggestions? Other PDF viewers? Other ways to
print PDF files?

Helpful information you could provide:

  1. What distribution are you using?

  2. How did you install your server software? (Manually? Package?)

For Debian or Red Hat systems (or their derivatives) dropping a script 
into /etc/init.d/ and then symlinking it into your desired runlevel(s) 
is the most flexible approach, since all start/stop operations can be 
managed from a single place. Red Hat provides the chkconfig utility 
for managing runlevel symlinks. I don't know if Debian-esque systems 
have a similar utility.

The init script can source a different file -- usually located in 
/etc/sysconfig/ for Red Hat, /etc/default/ for Debian -- for any 
custom options that need to be passed to the daemon at start time.

Gentoo is a whole different thing. You'll want specialized advice for 
runscripts.

Beyond that, the alternatives (inittab, rc.local, @reboot in crontab) 
will work, but none provides a handy interface for stops and restarts.

It will run in a Linux-Vserver guest running Fedora Core 5.

Not a package - written by me with using lots of copy and paste of code 
from the POE site (http://poe.perl.org).

Yup.  I am leaning towards the System V style.

I found one but it looked to simple/easy.  Of course that was without 
the chkconfig stuff and all the options that don't apply to the very 
simplistic server.

Good point.

If you can't get them to print properly then use a screen capture or 
gimp to print out an image of the page(s). Hopefully you don't have a 
lot of pages with these special characters.

John,
I might be wrong here but I think you might need to run fc-cache or
something else related to fontconfig

http://www.jeffmccoy.info/linux/config/fonts/fonts.php

Maybe that helps?

Most excellent! I'd never seen nor heard of this (oddly yet clearly 
named) script.

Alrightee -- it's Red Hat-based, though I'm sure you've seen the FC 5
end-of-life announcement, effective tomorrow, e.g.,

I'd just take a standard script from /etc/init.d/ and adapt it. I've 
used the sendmail script as a simple skeleton, and the sshd script in 
cases where there's a one-time initialization that needs to take 
place. The standard functions are pretty easy to use, and you get 
pretty [OK] or [FAILED] indicators at boot time. :-)

   Does anyone know if there is made a converter that allows a USB device to
plug into a serial port, rather than the other way?

   The serial connection between my Kyocera PDA and the desktop works
flawlessly; the USB connection between my Treo PDA and the desktop doesn't
work. Actually, using pilot-xfer, I just did get one connection, but it used
ancient, backed-up data and totally messed up my address book in both
locations. I'm restoring to the desktop from the backup tapes now.

   Anyway, if such a cable is available then I can plug the Treo's USB cable
into the serial port that I know works with the Kyocera, digital camera, and
other peripherals.

Keyspan I believe makes what you're needing. I have a couple if you want to
test them and not put out the cash.

Drew,

   Thank you. That would be very helpful. Please contact me off the list to
make arrangements.

I believe the keyspan devices allow a USB port to be used as a serial 
port. It sounds to me like Rich is asking for the exact opposite --

A while ago, I tried the Keyspan device to connect a serial port  
printer to a USB printer, and I did not have much luck.

Paul,

   That's _exactly_ what I want to try. I have the serial-to-USB converter,
and I want to try the reverse. That is, be able to plug the male USB cable
end into something that will plug into a 15-pin serial port.

Ken,

   My situation is analogous to having a USB cable on the printer, and
wanting to connect it to the serial port on the computer. Only by trying it
with my PDA can I learn if it's a solution.

I've never seen a converter that allows a USB device (printer, 
keyboard, coffee warmer) to attach to anything but a USB bus.

The reverse is true, obviously: PS/2 keyboards and mice have adapters 
to plug into USB jacks, and the Keyspan devices do the same for serial 
lines.

I suspect the reason is that USB can deliver significant power (e.g., 
enough to power a hard drive) along with signaling, while RS-232 and 
PS/2 jacks cannot -- but that's just a guess.

Serial ports are traditionally either 25-pin, or more frequently these
days, 9-pin.  15-pin connectors are usually something else.

Paul,
Yea I don't think there is either, however I've got  these bits sitting
around so Rich can play, break or otherwise abuse them as he sees fit
without any cash outlay on his part :-)

   I started to write 9-pin, then changed my mind. The 15-pin connectors are
video, I believe.

Mea culpa,

Paul,

   I'll try anything to see if I can get my new Treo 700p to sync to jpilot
on the desktop. It's a major PITA not having it work reliably.

   You're probably correct. A quick test should tell the tale.

I once read that the reason USB seems so simple is that the hardware/software to support it are exceedingly complex, and in my experience I have found this to be true. Thus, I don't think you'll find this type of converter. If it did exist, it would need to behave as a USB host with built-in class drivers for whatever USB devices are supported, and also be programmed to handle the application specific data going to/from the serial port. Such a device would be very specific to the device and software you are using.

   Yes, it does. However, when I plug in the PDA cable /var/log/messages
showe the connection at both ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB1. This I know know means
ignore the even port number and use the odd port number. However, as soon as
I click the sync button on the cable, the connection changes to USB2 and
USB3. Jpilot doesn't like that. When it's port is set to /dev/tts/USB1, it
does not communicate with the PDA, even if that's what /var/log/messages
shows as the active port.

   Why the port numbers change (they've been up to USB4 and USB5) no one's
been able to explain. Even running pilot-xfer, I cannot get a consistent
connection between the desktop an the PDA.

   If you could help me get a consistent port (/dev/tts/USB1, or ttyUSB1 on
/var/log/messages) and figure out how to establish the connection by
clicking on jpilot's sync button, then pressing the PDA's sync button, I'd
be very grateful.

   Let me explain more.

   My fiancee has been sync'ing her PDAs to jpilot over a USB cable for
several years now. All this with the 2.4 series kernels; she's currently
running 2.4.33 on her ThinkPad 600E.

   I'm trying to sync on a box running the 2.6.19.2 kernel. I don't know if
that's the only meaningful difference, but it is the first thing I think
might cause the issues. There have been absolutely no issues sync'ing the
former PDAs via the serial port.

Do you see more activity in /var/log/messages when you click the sync 
button?  My zire doesn't even appear until the button is hit.  Same 
with the old visor.  I'm actually surprised that you see it as soon as 
you plug it in.  Do they somehow (finally!) support software-activated 
sync from the desktop side?  (Though if that's the case they seem to 
have severely botched it.)

Is udev/hotplug in play?  What is/are it/they doing?

IIRC, jpilot-sync and/or pilot-xfer managed to break itself at some 
point wrt usb pilots specifically because of this plug-in issue.  They 
want to open the port, but the port's not there, so there's some sleep, 
but if you activate the sync via udev the sleep causes the pilot to 
time-out and then the port is gone and you shake your fist and hack the 
C code or something like that.  I think jpilot-sync got this fixed in 
early 2005, but I probably haven't used pilot-xfer since then.

I'm still wondering how to make cdrecord/wodim quit forcing me to spend 
7 seconds carefully considering the consequences of my actions for the 
sake of a $0.05 piece of vinyl.

I'm going to disagree.  Why not just learn that as "lf", so that ls

Seems unlikely to explain the observed behavior, but the design is that
you leave the cradle plugged into a USB port and you place the PDA in the
cradle, *after* the cradle is plugged in. The PDA is only expected to
appear once you press the sync button, then you've got a narrow window
between the PDA timing out to tell jpilot or something else to talk to
it.

I've heard newer versions of pilot-link are supposed to have a deeper
understanding of USB. I take this to mean they can use the even numbered
port as well (but don't quote me on that).

In the same vein, here's a function I just cooked up, and really,
really, want to call 'which', but Randal's points are well made.
(Although, I think the cat has been out of the bag for quite some time
now.)

Anyhow, the function not to be know as 'which':

# "semi" intelligent version of 'which'.  it just checks
# aliases before checking the filesystem:
function wh { alias $1 2>/dev/null || which $1; }

I don't know of a way to do this with an alias, and it's hardly been
tested.  As far as I can tell, it works:

|rogue on escher |charged| @ 23:29:55 ~|
 wh bash
/bin/bash
 |rogue on escher |charged| @ 23:29:56 ~|
 wh ll
alias ll='ls -lh --color=tty'

Elliott,

   This is the first PDA/Smartphone I've owned without a cradle. It has a
cable that performs the same function. I do plug it in before anything else.

> understanding of USB. I take this to mean they can use the even numbered

   I'm running the latest release, 0.12.2, so it should work. The
inconsistent connections, inability to delete a database on the PDA, and
other niggling issues are beyond my ability to resolve on my own. While I've
had port permissions issues in the past, nothing as unpredictable as this
has kept me from using my PDA.

Ummm, isn't that what the "type" builtin is for?

   [heinlein]$ type type
   type is a shell builtin
   [heinlein]$ type env
   env is /usr/bin/env
   [heinlein]$ type ls
   ls is aliased to `/bin/ls -F'

Well, chalk that up to "you learn something new every day" :) I never
would have guessed that.

On a related note, is there any man or apropos-like documentation for
shell built-ins?

And of course, `info bash` is much more readable if invoked as 
`konqueror info:bash`.

If you type "help" at a bash prompt, you'll get a list of builtins. 
Then type "help cmd" to get typical usage for function 'cmd'.

Beyond that, the bash man page has a SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS section 
that provides a synopsis of the various help pages.

I rearranged my schedule to attend.  A great deal at $100.  BTW,
remember that the "official" PLUG rule is that "if you say you're
a member, you're a member".  If anyone gets bureaucratic about it,
show them a PLUG business card (Dave and I will have some to pass
out at the next meeting).  I hope we get plenty of participation
from Free Geek people, too.  Has anyone arranged a tour of Free
Geek for Mark Shuttleworth?

BTW, this is quite a deal for us, but O'Reilly makes their money 
from the $1000/seat folks, and those people are why we have a 
conference to attend in the first place (thank you, thank you!). 
It would be rude and counterproductive to make a big deal out of
this in front of those attendees - if we cause a stink, there will
be no $100 user group discounts next year.  So be thoughtful and
mature about this, and DON'T SCREW THIS UP!

See you all at Ubuntu Live.

I really can't believe I've been using bash for so many years, and

I think that happens to all of us. I'd been using bash for a long time 
before I saw some use Ctrl-R to search shell history. It beat "history | grep" hands down. :-)

The really cool tricks, the ones we completely integrate into our 
daily work, are the easiest to forget about. They're just part of the 
landscape.

A couple weeks ago, I was doing some shell operations with a colleague 
looking over my shoulder. I crafted a longish command, but then 
remembered that I had to complete a different command first. So I 
typed Ctrl-A to get to the beginning of the line, prefixed it with a 
#, and pressed Enter. I did the prerequisite command. Then I 
up-arrowed a couple times, removed the #, and ran the long command.

My colleague just said, "I never thought to comment out an interactive 
shell command." It was so ingrained in my work habits, however, that 
it never occured to me to pass it along as a tip. Wierd, Unix is. :-)

I'm confused.
I just took advantage of the $100 deal, but ...
Ubuntu Live & OSCON appear to largely overlap?
What's the deal here?

Also, at the last PLUG meeting, the question was asked if we would have a
table at OSCON.
David Mandel mentioned that there might, but I have seen nothing here about
it.
I would be willing to help with a table.

I will also help, although I am registered just for the exhibit halls
for Ubuntu Live and OSCON. As a desktop user I didn't see much of value
in the rest of it. On the other hand, if someone needs to sit at a
table for a few hours and pass out PLUG cards and info, I'm definitely
willing. For one thing, it would be a great place to push the Clinic,
as lots of Linux folks know people who want to make the move but need
help.

Well that's a personal preference. It's certainly not dangerous - which
was my point. It's a USER shell, so you're the user, and you'll know to
\ls when you need to. If you're the type to get confused and forget that
you have an alias, then you're right, it's probably best to make
slightly different commands (lf seems very popular, but annoys me).

IIRC RS-232 delivers 12 volts over the line. Back in the 1980s when I was in 
school the RS-232 cards and Parallel port cards both had DB-25 connectors 
although I recall them being different genders of DB-25 ports. 

That didn't keep someone from incorrectly connecting a 12 volt serial port to 
a 5 volt parallel port.

Michael - for $100, you can *sign up your Mom!*  I'm having these
visions of Dilbert's mom, who shows up in the strip occasionally
as the matronly ?bergeek ("Child, didn't I teach you to scope your
local variables?  Now help me fold the laundry").  Ubuntu is the
best distro for Moms, and she might be thrilled to share that part
of your life with you.  If you bring her, introduce her, and we
will all go clubbing later.

Understood.  My mom was very resistant to learning to use a computer. 
Older folks learn more slowly, and often resent new stuff that could
embarrass them.  Also, font sizes in most apps are pitched for 20yo's,
not 70yo's.  Ubuntu with some accessability mods might someday be good
enough to break the Mom barrier, though.  The Ubuntu people need to
hear from people like your Mom;  if she won't come, bring an earful
from her, at least.  The next 20 years will be hard to survive without
computer skills, or without the wisdom of our seniors. 

Keith

PS - rule of thumb for computer presentations:  Never use a font size
smaller than half the age of the oldest person in the room.  If the
CEO is 63, use 32 point or larger font for everything.  This applies
to apps, too.

Voltage can apparently vary between 4-15 (up to 25!?).  It seems that 
most laptops put out about 5.

Current (and therefore power) is very limited though (maybe 5mA.)  
Compare to the default 100mA at 5V of standard-compliant usb bus power. 
That's roughly 0.025W vs 0.5W -- you'll definitely be talking about an 
externally powered device.

Further, I'm not sure that such a device would solve the problem of 
"palm shows up as two serial ports that move around".  At best, it 
would be a single serial port supporting one usb-serial endpoint.  It 
seems that anything more complicated would manifest as a more active 
device with a custom driver, which, for best results would need to hook 
into the usb driver layer, right?

The other rule of thumb I use ..

If the majority of the audience is Windows users.. I use a font to match the
IQ.
So for Windows users I use a 40 point font....<smile>

Eric et al.,

   I've learned a lot about USB the past couple of days. First, it's no big
deal that two ports show up; the PDA uses the odd-number port although
jpilot will apparently also use the even-number port in the near future. The
jumping around, I've discovered, relates to timing: when sync buttons are
clicked on the PDA and on the monitor. This morning's testing kept the
connection consistently on USB1. Didn't always connect then, but I've got
part of the timing down.

   Second, instead of Greg K-H's 'visor' kernel module that needs to be tuned
to each device used and loaded into the kernel, there is now libusb that is
more generic, tuned to modern devices, and 200%-600% faster. I have it
installed, it's used with pilot-link-0.12.0 and up, and I'll be testing it
later this afternoon. It should solve the connection problems, but I'll
still need to learn the timing rythym for it.

   Will report back on libusb when I have something to write.

   libusb is fully supported.

Keith,

   Er, ... clubbing what? Baby seals? Salmon fingerlings? Politicians?

Subject: [PLUG] powering relays with usb-serial adaptor
Message-ID: <200706300217.32756.ewilhelm@cpan.org>

The meaning of "usb-serial" in this case is the regular meaning :-)

I've been playing with a diode+relay setup which needs 5V for the relay, 
works great on the old dell laptop serial port (the little reed relays, 
plus an led and resistor (light-emitting optional.))

I'm going to hookup my external usb backup drive to only be on when 
backups are running (duh! turn off the lights when you leave.  Why 
don't more devices have power control?.)

I got some $9 usb-serial adaptors with the Prolific PL2303 chipset.  To 
my dismay they don't show any voltage between the ground pin and the 
signal pins.  WTF?

I jumper the ground pin to the usb ground (outer shield only) and viola! 
5V  (Seems like those would have been wired together to start with 
(btw, the ground pin5 is also not wired to the outer serial shield.  I 
thought that was supposed to be the case.  Further, the serial shield 
and usb shield are not connected, though the cable has the shielded 
jacket which I would assume is the usb shield.  Will learn more soon 
through dissection.))

What's the deal?  If I hook it to a modem it dials (though only at 
9600baud for some reason that I haven't thoroughly investigated.)  Why 
does the modem see a signal when the voltage meter doesn't?  Why are 
the usb shield and the ground pin at different levels?

If I'm only using it as a relay controller, is there anything wrong with 
soldering pin5 to the usb ground?

It could be it doesn't turn the signals on until it sees (senses) the
other end of the
RS-232 signal lines.

It could be totally isolated (opto-coupler) such that it doesn't create ground
loops.  Connecting the shield ground to the 232 ground could break the
isolation.
