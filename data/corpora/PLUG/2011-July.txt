The answer is "no, or maybe yes".

[Files] are not case sensitive in Windows, and case sensitive in most 
varieties of Unix. One notable exception is Mac OS X, which is Unix-based 
but uses a default file system type (HFS+) that is not case sensitive. 
However, Mac OS X also supports UFS volumes, which are case sensitive just 
as on any Unix.

Sounds like sloppy XML.  Named entities ("&<name>;" e.g. "&copy;") are 
not allowed without an explicit definition -- only numbered entities 
are allowed by default.  It's possible that there is a case issue on 
the fs causing the definition to be missed, but I would think you would 
get an earlier XML error about being unable to find the referenced 
file.  Seems more likely that it was only tested on IE, which is to 
standards compliance as fish is to bananna.

You might have some luck just treating it as html or possibly `xmlto` 
could manage to translate it.

   Thanks to the good advice from Michael R. and others I bought a Panasonic
HDC-SD80 digital camcorder. Thinking there was a recent thread on digital
video editing, I checked the mail list archives for May and June. There's
only a thread on working with VHS tapes.

   The new model camcorders record in AVCHD or iMac formats. Is anyone here
aware of editing/playback software for linux that accepts this high
definition format? If not, could someone point me toward a source of
information on this?

   Thanks, Michael. It requires a large number of dependencies so it will
take a while to get, build, and install them all before kdenlive. Whew!
After the more pressing needs are fulfilled.

With a DiMax Grex I am able to copy Disney VHS tapes to burnable DVDs.
Can I go from the burnt DVD to a file on a Linux server and if so, how?

Legally speaking, do I have to keep the original VHS tapes when done?
There is plenty of room in an attic area, but the temperature can exceed
100 degrees farenheit.  I don't know if a small cooler room can be built
up there or not.

My father is catching on that I plan on setting up a server and has
asked for one step up, he has asked that I password protect any movie
that is not rated G potentially.  How do I set up password protection in
Apache?  Just so folks know, I typically php script when I need to do
something fancy.

Another problematic area is what to connect to the television and how to
set up Linux.  I haven't been able to get Fedora to work with an HDTV.
Is there a particular video card I want?  Is there a particular computer
I should be looking at that has proper video support built in?  Atom
boards don't typically.  My brother-in-law says to use some kind of
Apple computer that is intended for connection to a television.  I have
a Pentium 4 running XP, but I want to get away from that for 2 reasons.
Reason 1 is a size issue.  Reason 2, Windows can't be network booted and
almost needs a battery backup unit connected.  I want a remote for the
computer even if I have to build one.  The remote should be able to
start firefox and allow you to browse a web page for the movie you want
to watch.

dvdbackup can extract data if there is CSS protection on the DVD.  If
you are making it yourself, though, then 'cp' should do the trick. :)

> Legally speaking, do I have to keep the original VHS tapes when done?

To the best of my knowledge, you broke the law when you recorded the
VHS content to DVD, full stop, so you are already in trouble.  Format
shifting is very restricted under most copyright law implementations.

(For example, back in Australia an educational institution could
format shift, unless they could buy the material in the target form
already, or it was copy protected in any way, and only if they had an
immediate need, and only if it didn't format shift their entire
collection.  Non-education format shifting was more restricted.)

You probably want to consult a real lawyer if you want to know if this
is strictly legal.  Your lawyer will probably then tell you not to do
it regardless of the law, unless you have more money for law suits
than Disney does. ;)

Anyway, I am not a lawyer, and don't even play that convincing a one
over here.  As the disclaimer usually runs.

Is there any way to do this without breaking the law?  I don't think
Disney is going to have the police break down my door for making a
private use copy of a private use VHS tape, but I could be wrong.  Is
Disney digital copy compatible with Linux?  I'm not trying to make money
off of these copies, I'm just trying to stream them so that the VCR
isn't needed.  I won't copy any Blu-Ray discs.

Concerning fair use, Disney employing multiple copy protection schemes
is making it very difficult to legitimately copy content.  That the law
could protect Disney's rudeness is even worse.  The collection is paid
for, none of the tapes are illegal.  Isn't it fair use to make the
programs compatible with modern DVD players so long as I keep the
originals and don't distribute for profit the copies?  How about a local
area network server, isn't putting the programs on that for streaming
purposes fair use?

I've run into a surprise, apparently, Grex can't defeat the copy
protection on VHS copies of the old Herbie movies.  I'm wondering if
anyone has more information on this?

I may be breaking the law, but I'm not trying to honestly and quite
frankly, fair use deserves as much protection as the content producers
right to charge for viewing.  If someone copies VHS tapes or DVDs or
Blu Ray discs and then sells the copies, by all means bust that
individual.  This is NOT a for profit venture.  I'm just trying to
make the collection more accessible and protect against the VCR wearing
out.

If I had the power to change copyright law, here is what I'd do:

1) Technological measures to enforce copy protection which impact fair 
   use are prohibited.

2) The copy protection is up after 20 years and cannot be renewed.

3) No copy protection implemented in software can be kept secret, see
   rule 1.

4) People who make a profit by copying copy righted material are subject
   to prison time.

Some will scream and say that my proposal makes the copyright worthless,
but the copyright was never supposed to keep content shared with the
public under wraps forever.  People will still buy commercial copies of
movies when they are out of copyright.  Copying from one format to
another is time consuming and painful.

VHS tapes are low definition.  It is probably more expensive to buy Blu
Ray/DVD copies of the movies in my collection.  Some of these movies may
not be available anymore.

Message-ID: <CAMf_Wkpg0kOV_uFRtFmUWuBMxdR0UjqJ+Z+ByFoGL3w61u_Vmw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi:

I am trying to record some TV programs using mencoder from command line.  I
have two older capture cards that I am using.
They are using cx8800 and BT878 chipsets.  I think they have good Linux
support by now.

However, no matter what I do with mencoder, either I get a blank screen or I
get a screen with a lot of lines and no sound either (I am using built-in
sound card).

Is there an easier (and even newer capture card) that works well with Linux
and easier to configure?   I am using Ubuntu but I am open to other distro
and configuration.

Thanks

Mark

So far as I am aware, no, but I am not an expert.  However, in
Australia, the answer would categorically be no: you are expected to
buy the DVD versions formally, not shift the VHS ones.

I don't honestly think you are more at risk from doing this than most
people are for their less-than-legal media, or format shifting.  After
all, CD to iPod is more or less in the same bucket, and that doesn't
seem to slow anyone down. ;)

I think so, yes, but the law doesn't agree.  Which is, I think, a
failing of the law.

Yeah.  This is pretty much my view, too.  I also feel that people
should be aware of what the law says, even if the law is an ass. ;)

Good luck,
    Daniel

On the plus side, since I doubt it makes any difference to the legal
status, IMO you don't have to find a way to store those VHS tapes.

Message-ID: <1309704069.11299.1044.camel@Maui>

Folks, 

Every now and then, Firefox seems impossible to handle -- I see a thick
vertical black bar (approx 2" in a 12" wide screen) in the left hand
side of the screen, and Firefox windows become almost impossible to
read. 

When I switch into a terminal and run the top command, the number one
user is Xorg, using like 80+% of the CPU. (That's always seemed odd on
an i7 laptop, but I think that's a different issue.) It is followed
closely by Firefox at about 10% of CPU. 

After a few minutes, the problem dissipates, the black bar disappears,
and I'm able to use Firefox again. My wild guess is that it might be
java related, as it happens only on certain websites, but don't know. 

While this is "just an annoyance" on my (i7, T410, 8GB) RHEL 6 laptop
(haven't seen this in Ubuntu 10.04, but use that less frequently), I
would appreciate some insight, if available. 

Thanks,
Mike

There appears to have been a bug with fglrx and compiz that caused
behavior similar to what you're describing:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fglrx-installer/+bug/748137

If you're not sure what video driver you're using, check if you have
an ATI video card and then look through your Xorg log file:
$> lspci | grep VGA
$> less /var/log/Xorg.0.log

Let us know what you find.

I have had similar problems with Firefox on Fedora 14 x86_64, although
not so much recently, and I never get a wonky display. Usually the whole
computer bogs down and I note that the CPU monitors that I have
installed in the Gnome panel indicate that at least one of the cores is
running at 100%.

I usually use one of the GUIs (Gnome/KDE System Monitor) instead of
top. Invariably it shows Firefox using a lot of RAM but not much CPU.
However, scrolling down I see several Java processes running, usually
as zombies, but one that is hogging most of one of the cores. If I kill
the offending Java the system returns to normal. Moreover, Firefox
seems to be unaffected by the missing Java process. 

My theory is that I was browsing and hit a web site with some Java code
that messed up whatever flavor of Java Firefox is using (I have several
Javas installed). 

I would second your hunch that it is Java related.

i agree wholeheartedly. one of my favorite movie purchases was an 8 DVD
box-set of Charlie Chaplin flicks, which i'm fairly sure is old enough
to be out of copyright, and could certainly have been obtained for free.
yet i paid happily for the convenience and charm of a full set with the
liner notes intact.

your rules sound good to me as well, though the unfortunate reality of
money's influence in our "justice" system has me convinced that i'd
better not hold my breath.

odd coincidence, i'm watching an MSNBC show on movie piracy as i write
this. they have a very different take, informed by the MPAA.

Hey Everyone.....

Ok, I know this is a REALLY really dumb question to ask here,  BUT . . . .

Since the Games on my computer (card games, solitaire) have have had
anyone smart enough to come up with this feature, does anyone know a site
that has solitaire card games with a feature that will tell you when you
reach a point where you cannot win?


Thanks

KDE has a solitare game in Kubuntu that tells you if a game is winnable 
or is a lost cause.

Subject: [PLUG] The Wii and Linux...
Message-ID: <1309901763.2895.12.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

Needing a client computer for accessing video rips off of a Linux
server.  How about that $150 Wii?  Has anyone figured out the server
side software and the tricks needed to do this?  I'm wondering if the
Wii has to be damaged with a root kit or not?

The problems with a micro btx Pentium 4 are three fold.  Problem area 1,
the computer is still awfully big.  Problem area 2, no remote control.
Problem area 3, I have yet to figure out how to make Linux look decent
on a projection HDTV.

If the Wii is happy with the Linux server and sees the lan as the
Internet without modifying it...  The Wii is set up for the television,
no guess work.  The Wii address the remote control issue.  The Wii is
already there and is considerably smaller.  The downside of the Wii is
that we don't have the Internet package, didn't want to go there.  I
know nothing about hooking the Wii up to an ethernet network.

So gurus, what do you think?

Help, does this damage the Wii in any way?

I want Linux on my brother's Wii so I can stream videos from a Linux
based server.

Will it work as an ordinary Wii after Linux is installed?

I wasn't aware that a Wii would run Linux.  I doubt there is enough
disk space to run both Linux and the Wii OS, but perhaps you can boot
Linux from an external drive.

I put homebrew on a wii ~2 years back, and it was quite easy, didn't
disrupt normal functions, and (in theory) would read media of a shared
drive - I never tried that though.

Things may have changed though.  I don't believe homebrew has ever
been supported.  (The installation process takes advantage of some
bugs in the Wii firmware, iirc.  I think there were different
installation processes depending on your Wii version.)

No rootkit needed but you will have to install a internet download onto a sd
card installed in the Wii.

Haven't tried it but I do have the Wii ethernet device which is needed to
get this running.

I'm having an issue with apache's mod_proxy_balancer. I need to set a cookie
in the form <something>.<routeid>. Using RewriteRule to do it. It's writing
the cookie fine, but it keeps REWRITING it upon every request
unconditionally with a new Set-Cookie. I think I need a RewriteCond to check
for the existence of the cookie first. Can someone help me understand how to
write the condition? Struggling with the docs.

Below is my entire balancer config.

Subject: [PLUG] ipv6 router and firewall troubles
Message-ID: <4E140A7A.5010802@nathanewilliams.com>

there's been enough buzz around ipv6 lately that i figured i'd better
start playing with it right away to be fully prepared for later.

i got a tunnel from hurricane electric, and set up my nas with radvd to
lease out addresses within my subnet.

everything seems to be working properly, and i can see my inet6 addr in
ifconfig when i'm on a client (my laptop).

what's strange about it is that i can only connect to ipv6 hosts
(ipv6.google.com) if i drop the firewall on the router...

for the life of me i cannot find a decent guide on how to keep the
firewall up and permit the routed traffic...

any advice on what may be going wrong?

thanks in advance,

nathan w

Here is my basic script for turning up my he.net tunnel and getting some basic
firewall rules installed.

Runs on an Ubuntu system installed in /etc/network/if-up.d/he_6to4

I don't know how applicable this is to what you are trying to do, but
you may find the following a helpful reference:

  http://projects.sentinelchicken.org/howtos/lug-ipv6

The scripts are a bit dated now and may need a few fixes, but it's a
starting point if you have none.  I can answer any questions you may
have about how to use it if you are interested.

   Before you vim-ers tell me that emacs always behaves strangely ... stop!
This is not an editor war story.

   I'm writing a LaTeX script (for PSTricks) and the letter following an
underscore character is also lowered and smaller than the rest of the text.
I have a screenshot that may be stripped off this message, but can be sent
privately. Never have seen this before. It's more of a distraction than
anything else, but if there's an explanation I'd sure like to learn what
that is.

   Any ideas?

Rich

   I think I know what this is: the emacs TeX mode takes the underscore as a
math-mode subscript; if the underscore is escaped with a backslash it
appears normally.

   Hadn't seen this before. Oh well.

Message-ID: <1310081795.4299.3.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

I have mail relays which means that local mail delivery is disabled.
How do I use the mail robot to get mail processed and over to the
database running on the relay for listing?

I'm using postfix on CentOS 5.x.

Do I need to install spamcannibal in part or in whole on the central
mailhub?

Too much is getting through mailscanner and I'm tired of spamcannibal
doing nothing.

Is there a way to have one locally deliverable email address, say spam,
that drops email in a place that spamcannibal can work with?

did you get anywhere with this?

you can check the HTTP_COOKIE var in a rewritecond, so something like:

RewriteCond %{HTTP_COOKIE} !BALANCEID=

should stop processing if there is already a BALANCEID cookie set.

I did get somewhere. I abandoned RewriteRule in favor of mod_header:

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName dc.pippiandcarlos.com
    ServerAdmin postmaster at pippiandcarlos.com
    ProxyPass / balancer://dc.pippiandcarlos.com.cluster/
    ProxyPassreverse / balancer://dc.pippiandcarlos.com.cluster/
    Header add Set-Cookie "ROUTEID=.%{BALANCER_WORKER_ROUTE}e; path=/"
env=BALANCER_ROUTE_CHANGED
    SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*" nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown
</VirtualHost>

And then removed all Rewrite stuff from the backend VirtualHosts. That
Header line works all the magic, but I don't understand it fully. That the
heck is the little "e" for? Oh well, it works.

Also I moved the stickysession parameter to inside the Proxy directive:

<Proxy balancer://dc.pippiandcarlos.com.cluster>
    BalancerMember http://dc1.pippiandcarlos.com route=1
    BalancerMember http://dc2.pippiandcarlos.com route=2
    ProxySet stickysession=ROUTEID
</Proxy>

I'm now pretty sure it's Java. The worst website for this was a message
board where updates (w/r/t new messages by others) are automatically
sent by Java. I disabled these auto-updates. While the vertical black
bar still appears, it's a lot more narrow, and no longer visibly affects
system performance.

Apparently, this is a means to send packets to user space.  I want to do
something very simple.  I want to grab the destination ip address of
html packets and keep a log for the day of where the internal host was
going that can be browsed on a public local area network web page.

This isn't quite a proxy, I don't want to cache packets and I'm not
after filtering the content.

A record would be host ip, 192.168.5.x source address, and destination
on Internet ip address.

I can possibly queue the packets between the local name servers and open
DNS to user space so that I can see the names being connected to later.

You're making it too complicated.  Your NAT router is running Linux, right?
Just use tcpdump or tshark.  Or just add an IPTables LOG rule.

Well okay, but how do I say count the number of packets and decide who
should be delayed in the future to ensure fairness?

You didn't mention anything about fairness in your first post.  Often
it is best to first describe what you are trying to accomplish.

Have you looked at the limit and hashlimit modules in iptables?

If those don't work for your needs, then whatever you were planning on
doing to ensure fairness in userspace can still be done using the LOG
rule.  Just process the logs with a script, etc.  iptables also tracks
number of packets matching a given rule, so statistics can be gathered
directly from kernel counters, rather than having to count number of
lines of a log file.

Agreed.  Use tcpdump and save the PCAP file for later digestion.
(Your cat really enjoys PCAPs, right?)

 : Well okay, but how do I say count the number of packets and 
 : decide who should be delayed in the future to ensure fairness?

That's a left turn at Albuquerque.

It sounds like you are hoping to get a better feel for what's going 
on in your network, and you are thinking that it would be helpful to 
know which hosts inside are talking (and for how long and how much) 
as well as which hosts outside you are talking with.

Perhaps I could suggest a few tools to get started.  First, as Aaron 
Burt suggested, try out tcpdump.  Here's a command-line to get you 
started, (along with a few assumptions):

  tcpdump -nn -i eth0 -s0 -G 900 -w /tmp/pcap/eth0-%F-%T.pcap -- \
     not port 22

Assumption 0, you can record all traffic through the device without
              any legal ramifications
Assumption 1, the interface you are interested in is 'eth0'.  
Assumption 2, you don't care to capture ssh/sshd communication.
Assumption 3, you have plenty of space in /tmp/pcap/.
Assumption 4, not so much traffic that 15 minute PCAPs would be big

Options:

  -nn          no name lookup, no port lookup
  -i eth0      interface
  -s0          capture complete packets (LOTS of data)
  -G 900       create a new PCAP file every 900 seconds
  -w <file>    file naming scheme ('man 3 strftime')
  --           end of options
  not port 22  a Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) expression

OK, so this should allow you to collect a reasonable amount of data.

Now, let's say that this is really not good, because (like me), you 
are too lazy to sift through piles and piles of PCAP data, and are 
only interested in what is happening in the instant.  If so, then 
'iptraf' is for you.  Give it a whirl.

If you want to count packets, use a LOG rule.  Note that this could 
yield prodigious logging.

At the end of your message, you took a left turn, apparently in an 
endeavor to visit my old friend Bugs Bunny (somewhere far from 
Albuquerque).  You asked 'who should be delayed in the future to 
ensure fairness'.  Networks and protocols are, of course, not 
intrinsically fair.  To boot, identifying fairness is a difficult 
matter, not least because some people want to pay extra for 'more 
fairness'.  Some are more equal than others.

I worked with an experienced research and education (R&E) backbone 
engineer once who said that if you are considering traffic control, 
you simply don't have enough bandwidth.  If you are on the backbone, 
I buy that argument in spades.  If you are an end user, you may 
benefit from it.

It sounds like you need to identify your usage and define your 
fairness before you can think about delaying traffic for some users.

Good luck--this is a (fun) can of worms you are opening,

-Martin

Yes, fairness is hard to define.

To keep fairness simple, no priority queueing where paying more means
more bandwidth.  

I was thinking I need the queue target to decide in real time whether 
or not to favor host b over host a for example.  My thought is the
following, keep track on an hourly basis who has used the most 
bandwidth and if there is a decision between letting that host 
through verses another host, the other host goes.  Of course this has
to extend for multiple hosts, so the packet counts have to be compared
to choose who should get through right now.  Another idea is to reduce
packet speed for people doing large downloads so that there is some
bandwidth left for the other hosts.

I'm trying to divvy up two broadband connections between up to 4+ hosts
at a time.

Another thought to control the impact of a mail flood is to set a
maximum saturation level.  If you know how many packets you can handle
instantaneously, it should be possible to signal a slowdown when a limit
is reached.  Whether the slowdown needs to happen at the packet layer or
Postfix should be sending an I'm not ready message is not clear to me. 

I'm interested in the QUEUE target because spamcannibal uses it and
getting spamcannibal working is on my todo list.

I originally wanted to do the simplest thing I could think of which was
a strange idea because there are easier ways to do it than queueing
packets to user space.

So the critical goal is to get spamcannibal to learn which means that it
needs to catch email packets as they come in.  Having a better handle on
bandwidth usage and/or more than that, that is something that seems
related to getting spamcannibal working.  The point of spamcannibal is
to slowdown email trouble makers.  Is there a way to log whether or not
packets are coming to user space and track down whether or not they are
being picked up properly?

It is Gnome 3. Search the Fedora forums for "Gnome 3" and you will find
lots of comments and suggestions from users.

One has to remember that bandwidth control is not about bandwidth as each
packet at a time
will consume the full bandwidth of the pipe at the point in time that it is
being sent or received.

You have to think about it more like a train on a track or a single lane
one-way highway.
How often do you need to interrupt the frieght train or tractor-trailer
convoy to insert something else.
If those big/long connections are not there then nothing should or needs to
be slowed down.

iptable rules with tc queuing rate controls will be your friend (or fiend if
you can't understand it) here.

If you are just wanting to gauge the usage by host in snapshot monitor mode
then
iftop with a filter or two should get you there.

Any idea when this catalyst bug will get fixed or when the free driver
will work?  This bug is incredibly annoying.  There doesn't seem to be
a workaround.  At least the system more or less seems to work.

What bug are you referring to? What driver is not free that you are
forced to use to display the upper bar in Gnome 3? And if you had an
alternative driver, why would it make the upper bar appear any
different?

I'm talking about the video card driver put out by AMD called the
Catalyst driver.  It doesn't render the bar or any of the icons
correctly.  The open source Radeon drivers currently do not support 
the ATI Radeon HD5450.

Note that the config files that follow are from a mail relay server,
local delivery has been disabled.

What changes do I need to make so that I can deliver spam locally to the
spamcannibal user?  The local delivery agent is commented out in
master.cf.  Should I NFS export spam from the mailhub to the
spamcannibal enabled email gateways?  I am using MailScanner, so that is
why the DNSBLs are commented out.  Another note, I don't greylist
anymore.  Note for the virtual file that I think the example.com
mentioned is supposed to refer to your Internet side 
address where robinson-west.com doesn't internally.  In other words,
I don't think my virtual file has any effect.

Where is sc_mailfilter.pl supposed to get email from?  Does this script
process and then send email, or what exactly does it do?

I do not know of Whiite, but it sounds like it is based on Debian- so have
you tried apt-get?

Otherwise, perhaps try to download it on another machine, put that package
on a USB flash drive, transfer it over?

No name resolution, no apt-get, aptitude, etcetera.
I'm trying to figure out how to get the dns tools debian package, but
I'm having absolutely no luck.

Wiite appears to have dpkg, and the wiki page indicates that apt-get
should work.  Perhaps your install went awry and you should try again?
(any chance you missed a step?)

http://www.gc-linux.org/wiki/WL:whiite-linux

This certainly appears to be a solved problem, and there are a fair
number of resources for wiite out there.

This will get you started: http://live.gnome.org/GnomeTweakTool

Followed by: http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/CheatSheet

If those don't help then I'm sure a deeper investigation of the gnome
website will provide some results. Beyond that you could try checking the
gnome mailing list, or maybe root around for something on the Fedora forums.

That's about all I can think of for the moment, good hunting!

overall, i'm solidly pleased with my purchase.

things i like:

TONS of channels, and apps of which my favorites are:

netflix, ted, pandora, flickr, Yahoo Developer Network, lots of other 
apps/channels, too many to name (they have lists on the boxee.tv site).

paid video services other than netflix (Vudu, and some others) are available

it has great built-in support for networked filesharing/streaming, so i 
can watch my movies/listen to music from anything accessible on the LAN.

the remote is AWESOME, check some pics online to see what i mean. the 
only way it could be better is if it mixed the buttons/keyboard with an 
accelerometer so that you could wave a pointer as with the Wiimote.

great form-factor. it's way smaller than you'd think, and fits very well 
in the components shelf along with everything else

boxee UI scales very well. it looks great on my 15" laptop and it looks 
great on my 42" tv, which i consider a testament to smart design and a 
lot of attention to detail on the part of the developers.

things i think could be improved:

using UDLR arrow keys to find/click links in the bbox browser is 
really... hard.

intermittent wireless connectivity loss. it only happens once in every 
~6 hours of use, but it's irritating to have to restart a movie because 
the network died.  if you get one and can run it over cat 5, do so.

not really a fault of the boxee box, but some of the content they get 
from xfinity online, cbs, etc is *loaded* with advertising, and while 
the boxee is *really* close to being "there", i don't feel it provides a 
complete replacement for a cable plan (though i have been very 
disappointed with comcast's programming quality and content:advertising 
ratio lately as well).

<aside>

i guess i don't really know if comcast is specifically to blame for 
this. i suppose it is FOX, FX, SHO, and especially HI that are 
responsible for the terrible show quality, and i don't know whether it's 
the networks or the service provider who determines advertising content 
and schedules

does anyone else know?

</aside>

all that being said, in the general net-tv-appliance market, i think the 
boxee is the best in class at the moment, though i'm not sure that will 
last. i am very interested to get my hands on a google tv applicance 
sometime in the next few months, but i don't think they're going to 
match the content selection, though i expect they'll beat the overall 
platform quality. they do have a history of showing that they know how 
to do-it-right. i won't even consider apple tv.

if you want to ask me again in a few months, i could give a better 
review/comparison, because google tv will have been out for a while and 
boxee's next big release is coming "in the fall"... we'll see what 
happens, but i'm getting closer everyday to finally being rid of comcast.

heh, this is longer than i'd planned. hope this information helps inform 
your decision :)

As a household without cable...
That's a very reassuring review.
I have a netgear AP in the TV cabinet, so there will be no reliance on the Boxee Wifi.

Wii doesn't have much memory.  I'm trying to download  
linux-2.6.32.tar.bz2 from ftp://ftp.kernel.org because I can't seem to  
get the modules that go with the mikep5 ios kernel.  I need them to  
possibly get X running faster.

I have installed GCC.  I don't seem to have the C libraries though, so  
I can't even get hello world to work.

I must be doing something wrong here or maybe there are known hardware  
issues that are fixed say in Debian Lenny?

   I've pretty well decided that the best process for me to upgrade my
server/workstation from Slackware-13.1/32-bit to -13.37/64-bit is to install
the latter on a new drive connected externally (along with the compat32
libraries), then copy over those 32-bit applications that I need. This
prevents me from losing something by overwriting the one drive.

   I have an external USB-connected cd/dvd optical drive, the USB-connected
external hard drive adapter, and the distribution DVD but I don't know if
these can be interconnected so the external drive is the target for the
installation.

   Can this be done? If so, how?

There are many ways to do what you want. I suggest an alternative. :)

1 Replace the old disk with the new one.
2 Perform the install you wish to do.
3 Hook up the old disk with the USB adapter.
4 Copy files needed.

This avoids any changes that might occur when you change how the disk is physically attached to the system.

If something goes wrong, you can always swap the old drive back in to get to that system again.

   That's how I usually do it. However, I do not want to take down my servers
and lose access to the workstation until I have as much as possible on the
new drive.

How do you intend to run the installation procedure without rebooting to the installation CD, thereby forgoing access to said old system?

Russell,

   That's why I asked if it's possible to install onto an external drive
rather than the booting drive.

   Ergo, the answer must be that it's not.

Thanks,

Rich

Ah. I did not understand that part of the question. I assumed that you would be attaching the USB devices, and rebooting to start the install.

Russell,

   Allow me to re-phrase the question: Can I attache a brand-new drive to a
running host and install the OS on that external drive while the host
continues to be used?

   My alternative is to buy a second keyboard and borrow a small monitor and
install it using the Jetway Ion-Top box that's going to be a network storage
device here. (I no longer have a KVM switch and have only a single monitor
and keyboard.)

Debian allows something like this with a "chroot install" but I'm not sure
Slackware offers similar functionality.  You could use a VM (with the USB
drive attached as its drive) but that might be about as much trouble as
just doing a regular reboot-and-install.

Usually for me, the cost of buying hardware is less than the value of my
time, or the value of having an ordinary install instead of an exotic one.

You need a monitor and keyboard on the other machine *while* you're doing
the install?  KVMs are cheap at FreeGeek.  KBs/Monitors are free to borrow
at the Clinic. (Which is THIS SUNDAY, everyone!)

Aaron,

   It's good to have backup hardware here so I ordered another mini keyboard
and a 19" lcd monitor for use with the installation(s). BTW, if anyone's in
the market for a fast, large hard drive, Newegg has the WD Caviar Black
drives on sale. I ordered a 750G/SATA 6GB/7200 RPM drive for the same $60 as
the 500G drives. Go figure.

   This will allow me to install the OS on both the replacement drive for my
server/workstation and on the Jetway Ion-Top (a physically very small system)
that will become a network storage drive.

   Thanks for the suggestion.

Rich

Michael,

I wonder if The BackSpace Cafe (115 NW 5th Av.) would be a good place for
Advanced Topics meetings.  I was there for a DorkBot meeting (which was not
held because it was the 4th).  I spoke to the bartender.  He said that they
are open to having such meetings.  They have a projector and a screen, can
shut off the music for the meeting, etc.  He said all arrangements are made
through their website, but when I went to it, the link for making the
arrangements is an email, events at backspace.bz.  Since I have never been
involved in the details of what we desire/need, I thought I should refer the
idea to you for further exploration.  My impression is that the availability
of food, drinks, tables, and an open door would be an improvement over Free
Geek.

If any others here have opinions, by all means chime in.

-Denis

Thanks, Michael for the discount code EXPOPASS.  Can we use it at the door
when getting in to these various functions, or must we use it now, somewhere
on the web to sign up?  I already signed up, weeks ago, for free access to
the Expo Hall only.  This what they sent me.

==================================
PACKAGE INFORMATION
==================================
You are registered for Expo Hall Only.
You get access to the conference from:

Tuesday Evening, July 26 - Thursday, July 28

Your registration package grants you access to:

* All OSCON Products & Services Sessions (Wed-Thu)
* Expo Hall (Tue PM-Thu)
* All Evening Events

Please note, your pass does not grant you access OSCON Java,
OSCON Data, OSCON Sessions, OSCON Keynotes, OSCON Tutorials,
Node Day or the IT Leadership Summit.

  The EXPOPASS discount code seems to cover a lot more of the convention.
 Do you know how I can change my registration to include the EXPOPASS code?
 Thanks very much for your help.

Cheers,
Elcaset

Subject: [PLUG] Wii problems...
Message-ID: <1310725825.15025.5.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

I can't figure out how to install a custom kernel.  Yes I found out
about ghex2.  Yes I tried editing the zimage root=.  The result, a
kernel that makes the blue light around the DVD slot flash and nothing
else.

Another problem, gnome is way too slow to be usable.  I've looked at the
menuconfig for the kernel, nothing jumps out at me.  Even so, unless I
can figure out how to install a new kernel I can't use a custom kernel.

The color scheme is disgusting, puke green and salmon.

I'm running etch as that is all I could seemingly install via homebrew
channel.

If I aptitude remove gnome, will that help at all?

I want something that operates smoothly enough to stream movies.

The only thing going right with the wii is that I can fit the screen to
the television.

Removing gnome and its dependencies will definitely make your system
run faster. Just make sure that one of those dependencies is not
something you need.

Yes, it's this Sunday, July 17, from 1 to 5 at Free Geek, 1741 SE 10th
in Portland, 97214!

Bring your Linux computer that's being a brat and we'll teach it
manners. Or bring your evil [other operating system] computer and we'll
help you transform it into a beautiful Linux computer. Or if you
already know all about Linux, bring your brain so you can help others.

We have distros galore and can burn you any live or install CD you
need. We also have mice, keyboards and monitors, so all you have to
bring is the box.

There will also be coffee and probably other goodies. And most of all
there will be fun!

We absolutely can.  The question is, will we?  The feds are a basket
case (both the FCC and Congress) and we can't anticipate any help from
them.  I have come to the conclusion that only by continuing to let
our local elected officials know how important it is will we generate
the political will necessary to make it happen.

The only thing I am after is being able to deliver spam to spamcannibal.
Email typically goes through the mail relay via  
accepted_user at robinson-west.com.
My thought has been, how about sending email to spamcannibal via
spam at xerxes.robinson-west.com or spam at web.robinson-west.com?

I must be off track here.  I expect that spam at xerxes.robinson-west.com  
will get caught resulting in delivery.  Look at the log on xerxes:

   I follow these threads with mild interest because they are strictly
Portland-centric. There are a few of us who live east of 82nd Avenue who
connect to the 'Net in our little hick towns (such as Gresham, Troutdale,
Wood Village, Fairview, Corbett). We even have paved streets, sidewalks, and
(as difficult as it is for Portland residents to believe) free parking and
non-constant street construction/repair!

   Perhaps a successful strategy would be to make the effort county wide and
bring in the fun politics of small town Oregon along with the that of the big
city.

   That such can be done in the Oregon boondocks is evidenced by the
successful efforts of Fred Ziari, a highly successful agricultural
consultant who's expanded into several related areas such as large-scale
underground water storage in the Umatilla basin and wide-area wireless
access to the 'Net across most of eastern (at least the northern portion of
eastern) Oregon. (There are still vast reaches of Radio Free Oregon as we
confirmed week driving to Winnemucca via Madras, Prineville, Burns,
Frenchglen, and Fields.)

I do not think that many would argue against your position that it is easier
to get many things done in lower-density regions.  What I object to is your
snide broad-brush slam of Portland residents.  Have a cup of coffee and take
a deep breath.

Your idea of approaching HS internet at the county level may have some
merit.  Are there a few persons in Multnomah  County Government who might be
able to run with this?

Denis,

   I've nothing against Portland residents, some are my friends. :-) I even
lived in Portland for three years before moving out here. My comments about
the city are based on its politicians, not regular people.

   Sorry that I offended you.

Or that hybrid municipality known as Metro.
It covers Multnomah, Clackamas and Washington counties.

Having said that, perhaps it's better to stay with City of PDX or Multnomah county.
The rural portions of Metro would object to funding a perceived Portland pet project.

Not really.  Firstly, much of the Portland suburbs already have access
to fiber via Fios (previously Verizon, currently Frontier).  The
failure there is the lack of open-access, which unfortunately and
ironically is an even harder problem to address than the lack of
fiber-to-the-home is.

In the City, we still actually have an opportunity to do it right.

It's important to say that this kind of utility ought to pay for
itself.  That is, users should pay for it and reap the full benefits
of ownership.  That said, to finance the front-loaded capital costs
requires some kind of bonding authority, which is where the need for
City involvement comes in.  

Local is how this is going to happen.  The farther up the governmental
food chain you go, the more remote the problem seems and the cozier
officials are with the incumbent telco lobbyists.  Should there be
national action?  Sure.  Is it remotely likely to happen?  No.  Local
is doable, it just requires that the officials keep getting the
message that the status quo is unacceptable.

Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS.  I installed the hplip package, went through the

That says that my distro should have hplip, which it does. There is nothing
there about error conditions.  I have seen one suggestion to reset the
printer to factory defaults.  I will try that tomorrow.  Also, I am planning
on installing the windows sw on a windows XP machine to see if I get the
same error.  If I do, it may in fact be a hw failure.  One forum spoke of
electolytics failing, although that was in reference to a different hp
model.

Keep those ideas coming.

I gave up on this idea and I'm trying to use fetchmail instead.

Still have the problem of getting spam to both servers and the problem
of efficiently routing spam periodically to a spam account.

Currently, I use redirect in horde Webmail IMP to get the spam from say
foo into the spam email account.  I have to open spam in Horde to
redirect it, forwarding isn't an option as the headers will change.

One way to get the spam to two places is to have two virtual mailboxes
connected to the spam user where each mailbox is a copy of the other.
The idea is to copy the spam once and have fetchmail from each gateway
that has spamcannibal installed access one of the two virtual mail
boxes.  Can procmail trigger copying?  Note that the mailboxes have to
be virtual or they have to be subfolders and fetchmail has to be able 
to target a virtual mailbox or a subfolder.

Another problem is that I want to be able to let spam sit in someone's
spam folder for say a week before it automatically redirects to the 
spam account.  My thought is fetchmail on the mailhub itself, but how
to target the spam folder instead of the INBOX?  The subfolders problem
hits at two points in the transfer chain, once getting spam to the spam
account and again trying to fetch the mail to spamcannibal on the two
gateways.

The best  I can do right now is to manually use Horde IMP to redirect
mail to the spam account on the mailhub. I then have the primary mail
gateway use fetchmail to pick it up.  Note that I'm not sure how to 
test if spamcannibal is processing the spam correctly or not.

The downside of my current approach is that I'm using an actual Linux
account, spam, to collect spam.  The idea here is that the spam account
is like a special trash can that actually empties into spamcannibal.

So I need to know the following:

1) How does one target a subfolder with fetchmail?

2) How does one automatically copy the spam to a subfolders with
procmail?

According to the Mighty Oracle, it needs a reset:

http://www.fixya.com/support/t1518892-printer_error_message_hp_aio_6210

I would try the "Full NVM Reset", see if it'll copy or print test pages,
then try printing from Linux.

I have been through the various resets: #3, #6, #9, and the Full NVM.  After
each of these I get to a point of a loop of alignment, self test, paper
eject.  No ink on the paper.  Only a power off interrupts the loop.  The
cartridges appear clean, ink shows up on a damp cloth.  But the
 hw-interrupt: 0xb 9000112165 message is gone.

I have read 3 years of postings at http://www.fixyourownprinter.com, but no
luck so far.

If it's worth a couple hundred dollars to fix (probably less, but be
prepared), there are companies out there specifically to fix your old

I just installed Ubuntu 11.04 onto my machine, using the usual Ubuntu 
"We'll do everything for you" install.  Everything went nicely until the 
last part, where I actually tried to _use_ Ubuntu.  The log in screen 
came up just fine, I selected me and entered my password, then it went 
to the 'real' screen, but never got far beyond painting the background.  
I get little rectangles that randomly flash on the screen, as if the 
computer is trying to do something but failing.  When I push the power 
button some of these rectangles become the shut-down screen, and if I'm 
quick I can push the "power off" button and the computer will power down 
normally.

Thankfully, I did not blow away my 10.04 installation -- that's what I'm 
writing this missive on.

I get various messages in various log files.  The pertinent ones seem to 
be this set, from both syslog and kern.log:

Jul 18 12:05:22 servo kernel: [  443.158652] compiz[1325]: segfault at

34 ip 0732ed75 sp bff463b0 error 4 in 
libnux-graphics-0.9.so.0.942.4[7295000+cd000]

Accompanied by this set, from Xorg.0.log:

[   431.479] Warning: Xalloc: requesting unpleasantly large amount of 
memory: 0 bytes.
[   443.246] Warning: Xalloc: requesting unpleasantly large amount of

memory: 0 bytes.
[   449.064] Warning: Xalloc: requesting unpleasantly large amount of 
memory: 0 bytes.

I've done just a bit of web searching, and I did run into complaints (on 
a Fedora forum) that this may have something to do with the monitor not 
properly communicating its size.

I assume that what's happening is that the install CD and the login 
screen both use some sort of safe graphics mode, but that the real 
screen tries to switch to some nifty cool-o 'way-best' mode and causes 
the hemi-hang.

So:

Anyone know what's going on?  Failing that, does anyone know how I can 
configure 11.04 to come up in safe mode when I log on?  They've worked 
so hard to make it safe for grandma to use that when something they 
didn't expect happens, it don't work at all!

TIA

Okay, if you've reset your printer, you might want to try another Linux
distribution. I've always had no problems setting up an HP 4215 printer
using Mandriva. You might try a Live CD or even install it, then try it.

In Mandriva's Control Center, you just click on the HP 4200 printer and
away it goes. It automatically installs quite a lot of various packages
but when it's done, the printer works. I doubt that Fedora does as much.

At least then you'll know it is not the printer, but the distro support.

HTH,
Robert

I think your neighbor gave you a bum steer.  It's possible the carts are
refilled and the printer thinks they've run out, or the jets are clogged,
but I'm not sure it's worth taking a risk on the cost of new carts (or
refills).

BTW, Windex can help unclog inkjets.

At the top of the page that Michael linked to, it says, "Register with
discount code EXPOPASS to get a free Expo Hall pass, which gets you access
to all this:"

You already have an Expo Hall pass.  So you have access to all that.

As someone who runs intranet-ish stuff, the SugarCRM talk looks interesting.
Ignite! is a fine way to start an evening of beer and brainy talk.
The BOFs look excellent.

Also, did I not hear that PLUG will have a booth? Should I print up
some PLUG fliers? Do we have business cards? 

I can get stuff ready pretty fast, but last year we didn't get notice
until the night before the Expo Hall opened. I was still folding fliers
as people were coming by the booth.

And yes, assuming that we have a booth, I will volunteer to be the
primary booth person, provided others can give me a hand occasionally
so I can go see things too.

Or do we not have a booth?

I too have never had any problem with an HP printer under 
Mandrake/Mandriva, or the new Mageia for that matter (nearly a clone of 
Mandriva so far, as it happens).  Mandriva wants to install "HP Device 
Manager" which is good (in my opinion).  Knoppix Live didn't have any 
trouble with my HP printers either.  Now my HP printers are network 
printers (I assume this HP OfficeJet 6210 XI is as well) ... not that 
that should make any difference(should it?).

If you can get to the GRUB screen, you can select 'recovery mode' then when
the next menu comes up, you'll have the option to run in 'failsafeX' mode.
If you don't have the recovery option in grub, just highlight the line for
ubuntu and hit 'e' wich will allow you to edit it. Then simply find the line
that has 'quiet splash' and replace those words with 'single' and you should
be good to go.

Good luck!

the hplip site says that this printer is supported in versions 0.95 or 
newer, and the current version of hplip is 3.11.5. ubuntu already has 
the 3.11 branch... it'd be a very outdated distro indeed that did not 
support this printer with the hplip package already in the repo.

i vote for hardware issues, but ianape.

Still ... almost any Live CD distro should be able to recognize and 
print to the printer ... which could therefore be a quick and cheap way 
to rule out the computer software and thereby more or less confirm the 
notion that the problem is in the printer (whether sw or hw).  I am a 
Mandriva user myself, but for Live CD I have liked Knoppix ... your 
mileage may vary.

I got that far, then I got stuck for quite a while on exactly what to 
_do_ with it.

Eventually I found a bug (in the release notes -- who ever reads 
those??) that mentioned Unity not starting up correctly with some 
graphics hardware.  Per that bug report, I set my desktop to start as 
Ubuntu Classic, and all is now working smoothly.

I think I need a new graphics card if I want Unity, but I can live without.

i seem to remember reading about a Unity 2D option, but i don't recall 
whether that's in 11.04 or slated for 11.10.

> Thanks  for all the replies.  The printer is sitting not connected to any
computer.  It goes through the alignment test, where the carriage moves
across the paper and a light shines down.  I assume that this is locating
the paper edge.  It then goes back and forth a couple of times, then
abruptly changes to self-test.  After 10 or 20 more seconds it changes
to Initializing, ejects the paper, then goes back to the alignment test with
a request for loading paper.  No ink appears on the paper.  This endless
loop gives me no opportunity to try anything other than power-off.  This
leads me to discount computer drivers, etc. as the issue.

I lightly pressed each cartridge onto a wet cloth, indicating three
colors/black.  This leads me to think that they are not plugged.  (Anybody
here have a printer that uses #94 and #95 cartridges willing to try these?)
 The seller told me that the thing sat around unused for a couple of years,
so bad cartridges is not out of the question.

I paid $20, so I will not feel too bad if it remains broken.  Spending $40+
for new cartridges will bring me to near 1/2 the cost of a new printer of
some type with no guarantee that it will work.  Not a reasonable risk in my
mind.  I may end of taking this thing apart far enough to see if there are
puffy electrolytics around.

Still of an open mind...

Well, since I believe the ink is water soluble, I believe all you've proven with the wet cloth is that there is ink (dried or otherwise) within reach of the water in the cloth. 

Since you aren't getting a cartridge error, it sounds to me like the cartridges are plugged, or dried out. If they are actual HP cartridges, they should have an expiration date built into the electronics that prevent the printer from using them after a time. But that might not apply to 94/95s. The next logical test would be those carts in a different printer, or known working carts in that printer. So you are on the right track.

All reasonable arguments.  Testing the cartridges is my goal at present.

This is surprisingly like the behavior of my HP2605 color
laserjet after we moved. 

The BIG MISTAKE was moving it with the toner cartridges in it.
( Three moves equals one fire, as the saying goes, things get
broken and lost in the chaos of moving ).  The second mistake
was using a refurb toner cartridge from Office Max, which
spewed little grains of red toner everywhere.

Most importantly, a grain got into an optical calibration path,
a pair of millimeter-diameter holes running through one of the
plastic assemblies to an LED and a phototransistor.  IIRC, my
laser printer has four of these, and uses them to detect paper
size and make tiny dots on the paper, which are measured to
precisely align the colors.

I am insane, so I took it apart down to the hundreds of pieces
level ( color laser printers are complicated ), cleaned
everything, and got it working again.

Before cleaning the holes, the printer would calibrate repeatedly,
then give up, with the colors misaligned by 5mm.  After cleaning,
it is lined up within a hairwidth.

I doubt there are as many sensors on a cheap inkjet, but optical
sensors are easier than switches, so HP may be using the same 
trick (and have the same vulnerabilities).  If the former owner
has dust or shedding cats, then the blockage may be something
besides dried ink in a cartridge.

Consider asking free geek if they will loan or sell you some
partly used cartridges for this beast, for testing. 

But first you may want to do a deep cleaning.   Cut-apart egg
cartons double-stickied onto a board can hold all the little
fiddly bits.  These compartments correspond with notes in a
notebook.  HP sometimes has detailed service manuals.  I've
considered making many digital photos during disassembly,
but so far sketches in a repair notebook have been adequate.

Interesting.  The Free Geek idea is worth a try.  Taking this thing apart
with the idea of getting it back together is a daunting prospect.  I used to
be very clever at such tasks, but my short-term memory is getting too short,
so I would need a video with instant replay to make a success of the
project.  The lack of ink on the paper puts plugged cartridges high on the
list.

A related question (if this printer never gets resuscitated) is what color
printers are on the recommended list?  As a measure of our usage rate, we go
through cartridges on our present Deskjet 970 at the rate of one of each
type every 1 1/2 years.  A pair of cartridges costs about $67.  A combo
scanner-printer would be nice.  Copy and Fax would likely not be used much,
if at all.

Any inkjet is not going to like going for a long time without
printing. BTW a 970 is
a great work horse, and comes apart so one can clean the 'drip pan'. I have two
of them.

I have a little init job that checks to see if the printer has done
anything i a week and
if not prints a little test line of a few vertical bars. That took
care of the clogging sadly
at the expense of paper.

Before that a little soak on a wet paper towel for a couple minutes
always fixed things

you could always put the activity-page back in the feed tray whenever you
see it in the output tray.

I really like this idea. any chance you would be willing to share your
script?

Office jets do use optical sensors for alignment and such ... could be 
dirt in lense

I was going to say I like my HP Officejet 7310 all-in-one, but I see 
they don't seem to be made any more.
But the 4500 at $99.99 seems like a possible, although the reviews seem 
to favor the 6500A ($99.99 after $50 instant savings).
For just color printing, the reviews seem to favor the Officejet 6000 
printer, but then it doesn't scan.  Have to pretty much stay with the 
all-in-one, I guess

Your mileage may vary ... check for local dealers ... check Free Geek 
... good luck

dont have system with printer where Im at but something like this

in cron run script once a day

check the timestamp on a file, if older then 7 days lpr the squirt
file to the printer
touch the file

the test file is a zero length file in /var, the squirt file is HP
code to print four rectangles
high enough to ensure all nozzles are being used. I used something like gimp to
create them. Made the height just enough to where it took two passes
of the print head.

Their width was like 1/10 inch or something like that

seems reasonable, except that would print the keepalive page even if you had
just printed something 5 minutes ago. I suppose it's still worth it if the
printer sees such infrequent use that this is worthwhile. though if that's
the case, you could just pull the cartridges out and seal them up. I think
that's what I'll do in my case.

My 7310 seems to want to have something like the alignment page and 
clean print heads run every few days no matter what other activity has 
occurred.

There is good reason why The INQUIRER starts nearly every article about
HP with the lede lead-in *FLOGGER OF EXPENSIVE PRINTER INK* or the like.

On the one hand, its 'give away the razor and sell the blades' strategy
works - awesome inkjet printers have never been so cheap, while the ink
cartridge prices make your eyes water - but there are corner cases, etc.

For many people, HP's scheme makes sense. I print, at most, a few pages
per month, but those that print more volume might not like this HP deal.

Everyone needs to work out their own economics for their printing needs.

Whoops!  I mis-typed.  Mine is a 930C.  Do you know if it comes apart?  I
looked years ago and saw no way to get inside.

I intend to try that on the 6210's suspect cartridges.  Maybe I can get
something working well enough to determine that new cartridges would get it
working correctly.

I like the video idea.  Frequent photos might work too, but it would
be easy to get distracted with the disassembly puzzle and forget to
take one at some crucial point.

But, yeah, try the ink cartridges first.  The silly thing is that
buying new ink cartridges at retail prices would probably exceed the
value of the device.

Note that third-party ink cartridges do exist and can make this scheme a lot
less costly in the long term. I go to Cartridge World in Tualatin for all my
printer supply needs. Their prices are usually about half the retail OEM
prices.

There's also a guy in front of Macy's at the Lloyd Center, between
the store and the skating rink, on the second level. I wonder if he
would test the existing cartridges for you. I bet he would for no
charge in the hopes of selling you new cartridges or at least making a
future customer.

I'm wondering what the parking situation is like at & near the convention
center for OSCON.  I assume during the day, there is no free parking on the
nearby streets.  Maybe there's some parking within a mile or so?

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] fetchmail problem...
Message-ID: <1311084312.23893.15.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

If I leave the smtphost part out, fetchmail tries to go to localhost
port 25 which is the relay host and the email disappears, probably
because spam is not a valid relay destination.

I have another server on port 26 that will deliver spam locally,
but I can't seem to tell fetchmail to go to a different port.  Even if
I add an IP address and a REDIRECT rule, fetchmail is rejected.

Maybe I need to add the name of the other IP address to the port 26
Postfix server?  

I don't understand why fetchmail has to use an SMTP server to deliver
mail locally.  I also don't get why the email showed up on the right
machine when I had a .forward file feeding it to procmail.

A thought is to use procmail somehow on the mail hub to redirect, change
the to address to spam at relay hostname.  If email hits port 25 on the
internal address of the relay, it gets redirected to port 26
automatically and my problem is solved.  Well, getting email to
sc_mailfilter.pl is only one problem.

Note that forwarding the email where the source address changes defeats
the whole purpose of sending the spam to sc_mailfilter.pl.  Also note
that there are two gateways which rules out a .forward file on
the mailhub.

I'm currently using fetchmail on the mail hub to get spam into the spam
account.

If I go for a short time, I may park on Grand, where it's $1/hr, last I
checked. When I've gone for a full day, I either take Max or bite the
$8/day bullet.

Thanks,
Mike

Thanks the info Mike.  I'd like to take MAX & Tri-Met, but the buses that go
out to Multnomah Village area stop running at about 21:30!  So, If I go to
any of the OSCON-related parties, that won't work.  I just remembered, there
is a Tri-Met bus that runs late at night along Barbur Blvd that is within a
mile of where I'm staying in Multnomah.  I might end up trying that.

Does anybody have a sense of how sketchy the area surrounding the convention
center is for car break-ins?

Thanks,

Elcaset

The Free Rail Zone extends to the Lloyd Center, and a couple stops
later you're at the Convention Center. The Lloyd Center is free parking
and there's no way for them to know that you're not shopping. So just
drive to the Lloyd Center, park, and walk a couple blocks south to the
Max line. Take any Max train headed west and get off at the second stop
after the Lloyd Center. 

Or you could actually walk from the Lloyd Center to the Convention
Center. It's only about 20 blocks.

They lock the Lloyd Center parking lot at night.. I don't know what time..
 It would be a bad thing to have your car locked in the parking lot over
night..<Hate sleeping in the car>

The couple of times I tried that (parking in the lot by the movieplex
just south of the main Lloyd Center building), someone actually drove
around and checked, asked me as I got out of my car. 

If they've stopped checking, that's helpful info.

Thanks,
Mike

That is no accident.  That is why the manufacturers put chips in the
cartridges to make refilling difficult or impossible. I resent having to pay
more for a cartridge because it has added stuff put in not to make it print
better but to make it less useful.  Which brands do less of that?

Subject: [PLUG] Spam problem...
Message-ID: <20110719231834.2lc9v5nnw0oss88w@web.robinson-west.com>

I'm trying to get spam to spamcannibal's sc_mailfilter.pl script so  
that the dns blacklist can be updated.  If I send an email from the  
mailhub either via telnet or evolution to the lan address of my relay  
servers, I have a REDIRECT rule that rediercts those messages to the  
relay servers local mail servers on port 26.

I cannot forward mail to sc_mailfilter.pl as this will break things.

How does this script work anyways?  I'm wondering if I can process the  
spam on the mail hub and physically send an email with headers  
carrying the appropriate information?  So essentially, I am talking  
about sending email over a local area network with a forged remote  
source and an empty body.  After all, I think this
is all that I need.  I'm running postfix on the relay servers and the  
mailhub and I have perl, procmail, .forward files, and fetchmail to  
work with.

Perhaps there is a way to trigger a redirect that leaves the original  
sender, not the current sender, intact?  I realize that I'm asking how  
to lie to a mail server, but I don't see how else I can approach this.

Without this information, spamcannibal doesn't tarpit anything and is  
essentially worthless.

Lloyd Center & MAX looks worth a try.  If I can find out when the Lloyd
Center parking lot is closed at night (probably about a half hour after the
mall closes), then that might work.

Otherwise, I could probably move my car at roughly 19:00 (whenever the
street parking meters stop) from mall parking to nearby on-the-street
parking, or on-the-street parking by the convention center.

Thanks for all the help, folks.  Much appreciated.  I enjoy challenges of
this sort.

Cheers,
Elcaset

I think BackSpace is perfect for DorkBot but I think the potential noise 
would bother most speakers. Parking is also a bit unpredictable and who 
can beat having the Lucky Lab within walking distance? Tonight a few of 
us dropped in there on other meetings in progress.

If it's food during the meeting that you're after, either the Lab or the 
food carts on 12th are nice options. (As Daniel and I tried tonight)

There is a park-and-ride at the Sunset Transit Center which fills up at
commuting times, but is very available in the evenings.  I do not know if
there are other  park-and-ride locations more convenient for you, but Sunset
is not too far.  I will likely park my bike there for Oscon.

Subject: [PLUG] Graphviz Help Wanted
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1107200855080.10899@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   My first attempt at creating a dot file and while it compiles it does not
display as I would like it to. I've read the various docs on graphviz and
the dot language but am missing what I need to make the diagram correct. One
issue is that the output .ps file does not display completely in gv. Another
issue is how to get a horizontal line between the table name and the column
names (this is an E-R diagram of a database schema.)

   I'll provide the code and would appreciate off-list help since this is not
a general issue. Should be quick and easy for you to teach me where I've
misused the dot language and its attributes.

TIA,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] Odd shutdown behavior
Message-ID: <1311181215.1559.76.camel@paul-desktop>

My desktop is dual-boot XP and the latest Ubuntu; each OS has it's own
SATA drive.  When I try to do a shutdown in either OS it does not
completely shutdown.
In XP, the nVidia video card powers off, there is no signal to the
monitor, but the cold-cathode light is on and the fans are still
running.
In Ubuntu, the splash screen is showing, with the left three of the five
"progress diamonds" in color, but that is as far as it goes.  The light
is on and the fans are still running.
So, I switch off power at the power supply.  Later, after switching
power back on and pushing the start button, the light/fans come on for a
few seconds, everything shuts down for a few seconds, and then the
light/fans come back on and a normal boot takes place.
It is as though the x86 box has a shutdown checklist and does everything
except the last few items.  Then, when starting a new session, it does
those last few shutdown items from the previous session, shuts down,
then initiates a normal boot process.
Anybody know what's going on here?

My reply is not an answer to your question, but merely an appreciation 
that you asked it. I happened to be in the throes of documenting an 
upcoming network change and was casting about for tools to produce the 
"before" and "after" diagrams.

I used www.gliffy.com, which produced some beautiful diagrams, but I 
realized that modifying them was often a non-trivial process. Plus, 
there's a lot of overlap between the two diagrams and I wanted 
something like code reuse. :-)

The dot language (which I'd previously never encountered) was just the 
ticket! The mere mention of it was all I needed to get started. 
Recompiling modifications is very quick, and copying items between the 
two diagram files is simple.

Thanks.

   Sheesh! Well, you're welcome. :-)

   What I've discovered is that each type of graph I need is best produced by
a different tool, just like my writing. While I use PSTricks most of the
time I also use gnuplot and now graphviz (assuming I learn what I've done
incorrectly on such a simple script.

THIS AMERICAN LIFE: The Patent Show
Sun, July 24, 10am. Why would a company rent an office in a tiny town 
in East Texas, put a nameplate on the door ... and then leave it 
completely empty for a year? The answer involves a controversial 
billionaire physicist in Seattle, a 40-pound cookbook and a war that

What is the hardware box? Offhand, it sounds like maybe a BIOS glitch,
since the symptoms in both Windows XP and Ubuntu seem somewhat similar.

Ubuntu, at least, should run /sbin/halt to power down. It doesn't work.

You might get into the BIOS setup with the DEL key or something else at
power-up prior to boot and look in there for shutdown behavior choices.

If you don't see anything in there, you can search for similar shutdown
problems reported for the brand and model machine. Or see if there is a
more recent BIOS available for the system or more likely the mainboard.

Thanks Denis,

I'll check out the park-and-ride at the Sunset Transit Center.  My only
concern would be car break-ins.
In Seattle & the surrounding areas, park-and-rides have the highest rates of
car break-ins & car theft compared to anywhere else.
I imagine Portland also has that problem, at least to some extent.

Cheers,
Elcaset

Could somebody summarize this for me?  I have a hard time hearing,
radio shows especially.  I assume this is about Nathan Myrvold,
his company Intellectual Ventures, and the patent-troll-friendly
East Texas district of the US District Court.

This morning, I got an email from Rep. David Wu, bragging about
how he pushed H.R. 1249 through the House.  That changes the patent
system to "first to file" (European style) rather than "first to
invent".  This makes the patent system even more lawyer-centric;
it will be better to have a bad idea and good lawyers than the
reverse.  Wu was a patent lawyer, and will be again when he loses
the next election.

The obligatory rant goes here, but I have some innovation to do,
and patents just block the way.

Subject: [PLUG] Where does Evolution Keep its Brains?
Message-ID: <1311276962.1590.26.camel@servo>

So, I decided with the latest Ubuntu upgrade to try out Evolution, since
I've been ignoring it for nearly a dozen revisions now.

I messed up my sig line (see below).  I want to change it.  It's not
apparent from the menus that there's either a way to do this, or even if
there's a way to blow it away and start over again.  It appears that I'm
doomed to forever have a "mail_sig" and a "mail_sig_really".

Surely this is stored in plain text in a file someplace?  I've grepped
on the content below and come up with all the mail I've ever sent or
received with that sig, but what I haven't come up with is the original.

Help??

I have never used the signature, but edit/preferences/composer preferences
has a signature tab.  That does not do it?  (Assuming sig = signature)

Is there a reason other than location that you do not use the Portland
Cartridge World store?

Subject: [PLUG] Whiite Linux questions...
Message-ID: <1311299668.3188.7.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

True or false, the Wii is not capable of HD resolution?

True or false, the cube driver cannot be adjusted to fit the screen?

True or false, Homebrew Linux on the Wii is not a good way to stream
local videos and pictures?

The Wii does have a Nintendo provided Netflix app, how does that work
if the Wii can't output in high resolution?

If the Wii won't work, what is the best pci express video card with DVI
output for this purpose Linux wise?  Needed, a card that doesn't require
a proprietary Linux driver.  I have a mini btx Pentium 4 system I can
use instead of the Wii.  It is bulky and I'd prefer not to, but I don't
see any good low cost alternatives at this point.  How does one adjust
the Linux console on a Linux PC to fit the television screen?  This
isn't really a problem on the Wii if you use the right kernel.

As in previous years, PLUG will have a booth at OSCON this year.  I
believe the expo hall is open next Tuesday evening and all day
Wednesday and Thursday.  We will some help staffing it.  Also, we can
use any fliers or whatever people can bring.

And as always, other Oregon Open Source Groups are more than welcome
to put their literature on our table and help us staff the booth.

The OSCON EXPO hall doesn't open until 5pm on Tuesday.  So, you can
still attend the Broadband thing at City Hall in the morning.  If you
have a conference pass though, you'd be missing some sessions.

I will bring PLUG fliers and will be there by 4:00 to get the booth set
up before the Expo Hall opens at 5:00. I'll also stop by Sunday
afternoon to see if I can get an Exhibitor pass instead of the regular
Expo Hall pass that I signed up for earlier. Without an Exhibitor pass
they probably won't let me in before 5:00.

I don't have any PLUG business cards and, from past experience, a lot
of visitors prefer to take just a card rather than the flier. And I'll
also bring a long extension cord, just in case the booth does not have
electricity. And I still have the banners and Clinic poster that I made
for previous years. 

And I also volunteer to take responsibility for the booth and man it
most of the time. It does not hurt to have two people to man the booth,
so help is welcome. Besides, it's nice to be able to leave occasionally.

Well, I tried.  Refurbished cartridges.  Same symptoms.  Maybe Free Geek can
get some use out of it.  Cartridge World said they would take them back if
the printer did not work.  We will see soon.

Subject: [PLUG] No dirty headers?
Message-ID: <20110723182113.g6buxg6lb0gkskck@web.robinson-west.com>

I thought the idea behind sc_mailfilter.pl is that it searches headers  
for remote servers and logs them into the tarpit.  What does no dirty  
headers mean?

I can't use a .forward file to get my spam to spamcannibal, but it  
seems I can use redirect.  Trouble is, I don't know how to automate  
redirect.  Seems refirect doesn't change the source address where  
normal forwarding does.

As far as the comment that I'm running an abnormal email system,  
Postfix is commonly configured as an email gateway/relay host.  If you  
have two relays like I do, it would be a problem to have mailboxes  
created on each one and not synchronized.  The idea behind redundancy  
is not to create two email accounts but to ensure that there is more  
than one way for mail to come in.  The obvious problem with relay  
hosts is that spamcannibal is expecting local delivery of spam on the  
mail relay.  This is not realistic for the reasons already mentioned.

One though is to move the relay smtp servers to port 26 and use a  
REDIRECT iptables rule, but the relay hosts are working where I will  
probably break them trying to change the port they run on.  If I pull  
this off though, I can in theory run a local delivery enabled postfix  
server on port 25 and use fetchmail.

What does sc_mailfilter.pl really do and what does it really need?

Do I need to move my relay servers launched by MailScanner to port 26?

If I process the spam on the central mailhub, what portions of  
spamcannibal do I need to install?

I'm trying to protect my bandwidth or else I wouldn't need spamcannibal.

As far as the mailhub having an outside connection, the only reason I  
do that is to ensure that I can email people.  In theory, I should be  
able to route outbound email through my email gateways, but having a  
theory and putting it into practice are two different things.  For one  
thing, I think you have to rewrite email headers to reflect the actual  
source when routing outbound email through a separate gateway.   
Because of the redundancy, I don't know what to rewrite the headers to  
until an email is going out.  The easy solution is to let the mailhub  
send email out directly.  Ideally though, the mailhub shouldn't have a  
direct Internet connection.

Clearly, I could change from having three Internet connected servers  
to having just one.  Trouble with this is, if I want to try something  
and potentially break email, there is no way around the break.  With  
virtualization, one machine can pretend to be three.  Trouble there  
is, I need to take some time to adapt to a single server over three  
seperate computers.  I need to be able to split up network ports  
etcetera between virtual machines so that I can have machines that are  
Internet connected and ones that are not.  Needless to say, switching  
to a single server infrasture will take time, it will take effort, and  
the switch will cost money.

Actually, setup time apparently is on Monday or the morning (only!) on
Tuesday. 

Exhibitor Registration/Move-In:

    Monday, July 25: 8:00 am - 5:00 pm
    Tuesday, July 26: 8:00 am - 12:00 pm 

Why they appear to limit access in the afternoon, I don't know.

Wayne,

   For hardware questions like this I've received consistently good advice
from the staff at ENU in NE Portland; I'm sure their western store does just
as well.

   Last Monday I upgraded my Aracnet account to the maximum bandwidth that
Frontier reports for my location (3M down, 768K up). The change was supposed
to take no longer than 48 hours. It is now a week and my bandwidth has not
incresed (according to speedtest.net).

   Isn't such a change a matter of a few keystrokes by the Telco?

   Aracnet/SpiritOne tech support sent Frontier a query on Thursday but has
not had a response since then. I'm trying to understand where the problem
might be.

Have you tried rebooting your modem? I think the modem does an initial
training at reboot that may be necessary to recognize any changes Aracnet
may have made.

Thanks Michael for your prompt answers.

Okay, so lets see if we are on the same page.

A typical setup for spamcannibal is to have the lowest numbered mail
exchanger locally deliver email, at least the spam account.  This
negates the whole spam is not in the right place problem.

My environment is different, though I have the full spamcannibal
installation on the email gateways.  Thing is, my gateways don't 
locally deliver anything at all.  I have a spam account on what should
be an internal mail hub, I'm not yet into masquerading at run time email
headers.  How can I gain remote access to the spamcannibal database so
that I don't have to install the full package on the mail hub?  If I
understand correctly, I should process the spam on the mail hub instead
of trying to redirect it to the gateways hopefully intact.  What should
I uninstall on the gateway relays and how do I do that?

In short, I'm wondering where my focus should be for my particular
environment.  I recommend if at all possible that someone post
installation instructions for my environment where there is no local
delivery on the Internet connected mail relays.

If I'm clear, I want the spamcannibal database on the mail hub, not the
mail relays.  I want to process the spam on the mail hub.  I want to
update my two DNSBLS servers, redundancy.  And separate from
spamcannibal, I want to masquerade email headers so that I can email 
Internet targets indirectly and take my mail hub off of the Internet.
With all this in mind, how do I uninstall the spamcannibal database
from the mail relays?  Am I correct in thinking that what really matters
is keeping the blacklist DNS servers up to date?

-----------     -------     -----------
| relay 1 |-----| Hub |-----| relay 2 |
-----------     -------     -----------
     \                           /
      |                         |
      \        /--------\       /
       \ ------|Internet|------/
               \--------/

The above is a diagram of what I think I'm after:
The spamcannibal database and the spam account on Hub.
The relay 1 and relay 2 servers the only ones on the Net.
A DNSBLS server on relay 1 and relay 2.
Tarpitting has to occur at relay 1 and relay 2.
Postfix is the MTA launched via MailScanner on relay 1 and relay 2.
Postfix is employed on Hub.

For a better diagram, I really have to use Dia.

Aracnet/SpiritOne is your ISP and Frontier (formerly Verizon, perhaps)
is the ILEC (telco) or maybe it's a CLEC or DLEC, leasing your circuit
from a telco (like Qwest, for example) and reselling that to your ISP.

In my admittedly limited experience (as Speakeasy is my ISP, and Covad
is the CLEC under the telco, Qwest), provisioning an ADSL line takes a
lot longer than 48 hours. That work must be scheduled by the companies
and that can take more than one week, perhaps up to two or three weeks.

As I understand it, your telco pair terminates in a local telco office,
where the voice bandwidth is split off to the POTS circuits, and higher
frequency ADSL bandwidth is terminated at the local DSLAM (essentially,
a rack of ADSL cards hooked to an edge router, sitting on a fast link).

If the ILEC (or CLEC/DLEC) that owns your ADSL card at the DSLAM has to
switch that out for a faster one, that could account for a provisioning
delay, such as you seem to be experiencing.

I only know this because Speakeasy made the entire process transparent,
both when I initially ordered my ADSL line and again later, as I moved.
It showed me the work orders, schedules and confirmations of work done.

You now know everything I do about ADSL provisioning (well, except for
fact that apparently the backhaul on my line uses ATM from my DSLAM to
Speakeasy's Seattle POP, which sort of blew my mind when I heard that).

Perhaps Aracnet/SpiritOne will share its record of orders, etc., to the
ILEC/CLEC/DLEC with you. That's what I'd ask for, if I had the problem.

This sort of thing makes me hesitate to think about changing my ISP, or
even ordering a higher speed link. I can't afford my ADSL link to fail,
though I might consider a backup or a dual-homed setup for reliability.

HTH and good luck!

I just registered, and I got the Exhibitor sticker. I also wandered

The answer is yes.  There are quite a few command-line options to 
ssh, so I can understand why you might not know which to choose.  
Here's my typical invocation of an X application that I run on a 
different machine.

  ssh -f -C -Y -c blowfish -l "${USER}" "${REMOTE_HOST}" "proggie"

    -f          background after pass{phrase,word}
    -C          compression (probably not necessary on a LAN)
    -c <cipher> choose a cipher
    -Y          use X-forwarding
    -l <user>   alternate username

Good luck,

I've provisioned DSL services before. Generally speaking, a b-wdith upgrade
is relatively quick and easy provisioning change
once the change order has made it to the technician. Assuming of course, the
copper infrastructure from your modem to the telco
is actually capable of supporting that b-width speed you requested. If it's
been a week, there might be some administrative glitch or as
someone already mentioned your request may have necessitated an
infrastructure upgrade to accommodate the additional
b-width you requested. Which although is certainly a possibility, in my
opinion is a bit of an engineering failure. We did
a monthly review of all our circuit/equipment bandwidth capacity and tried
to have enough additional
capacity available for b-width upgrade requests.

But at the very least, if they told you the change shouldn't take more than
48 hrs, as a matter of good customer service they
should've communicated to why it's taken over a week. It's also possible
they processed the change order, and it's complete
according them, but the provisioning may not be correct. It happens a lot
more than any of us work in the telco/ISP biz like to admit...

Mike,

   I requested 3M/768K because my location will not support the maximum of
7M/768K. Aracnet checked with Frontier (on line) to find the maximum for
here.

   I've had excellent service from Aracnet for more than a dozen years so I
assume they've not had a response to their follow up ticket with Frontier or
I would have been informed.

   Frontier does not impress me. When they installed FIOS cable a year or two
ago, they ran the cable to my neighbor's house in the middle of the strip
between their driveway and mine. Directly under the trunks of a couple of
sweet gum trees that we had cut down a couple of months ago. When the stump
grinder went to work (assuming the cable was off to the side; apperently he
did not call for locator service), the fiber optic cable got chewed up. The
replacement crew admitted it was originally poorly placed; the stump grinder
said he had never cut a cable in the 20 years he's been in business. When
the next-to-last Frontier crew came to re-route the newly installed
replacement fiber, the did put it deep and against the edge of my neighbor's
driveway ... and broke their drain pipe from house gutters to the street.
So, another Frontier crew was called out to replace the drain pipe.

   Since Frontier's technical service business model seems to be based on the
Keystone Kops, I should not be surprised the banswidth upgrade has not yet
been accomplished.

While I agree that you should be able to run Thunderbird(and 
Evolution) remotely, you're going to chew up bandwidth shoving 
graphics over the network.  Not a problem for a LAN, but painful on a 
slower network.  Are you running an IMAP or POP server?  Why not 
forward the ports you need over ssh and configure your mail client to 
use the forwarded ports?

Dick,
You could do a lot worse than to use the Amaya tool from W3C.  It's been a
few years since I touched it, but it worked for what I needed.  I do tend to
think the best work is done by hand though, rather than though a WYSIWYG
system.  Heck I even prefer LaTeX to Word or Writer.

This is strictly on a LAN.  I normally work out of my office in a
detached garage, but find it convenient to check email before breakfast
and in the evenings from the house.

I'm not running any servers -- just using what's available from my ISP.

I've not used any of them (so I can't speak to how well they work- I
also haven't used Dreamweaver, so, there's that :-) but
AlternativeTo.net lists several:
http://alternativeto.net/software/adobe-dreamweaver/

A few FLOSS ones:
* http://aptana.com/ (actually, this looks pretty cool, I'm
bookmarking it to check it out later :-)
* http://www.kompozer.net/
* http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/index.html

There's also Amaya that Mike Cherba mentioned.

Looks like it might be a useful place to look for other alternative

But there may be a problem.

There are no stools. Another exhibitor nearby said they were charging
$45 for a stool. But then a group for OSUOSL arrived (second booth down
from us) and they told me that their information said they were to have
stools. I said that we had not paid for our booth, and they replied
that they did not pay for theirs either. 

One of the group said she spoke "Trade Show" and offered to go to the
exhibitor help desk to check it out. The man behind the desk said the
stools are arriving tomorrow. 

So now I'm assuming we'll have stools, and hoping that the first
exhibitor that I talked to was wrong. If someone is around tomorrow
morning it would be good to check out our booth to be sure we have
something to sit on, else I can bring something when I come at 5:00.

It is always good to have help. Sometimes there are no customers,
usually there is one customer, and sometimes there are two or more.
Two people at the booth is good when demand is high. It is also good to
have someone to give me a break now and then. So your help will be very
welcome.

You're in luck.  There's a transcript of the show.  24 page pdf.

You could try running the X program with nohup, or do something like:

   $> evolution & disown

that should start the process without using your shell as the parent.

I have never seen this disown thing before - tried to man it and then
found it's a bash builtin.  I've been shell scripting for ages and
today I learned something new and very useful,  Thank you!

I have a customer that is waiting on a DNS update for his site to start
working. He's bugging my guys constantly, so I promised him we'd call him
the moment it "works." Currently, I'm checking his DNS server every few
minutes manually. If I could automate this to alert me when it's updated, we
could make the call and be done.

It was also worth the email because I'd like to be able to do this on a
broader scale - I'm curious about how often some public DNS servers update.
I could submit a change and time how long it takes each server I'm curious
about to return the new data. I'm particularly interested in the difference
in response time between 4.2.2.2 and 8.8.8.8.

You could wrap
dig output in a script watching for your expected value and trigger an email
from there.

Nagios includes the tools you need here.  You could either use the
whole stack (which I would recommend anyway, if you have this sort of
client issue), or just use the probe and wrap your own logic around
it.

You might want to save it for Halloween.? It's one of the
scariest things I've listened to in years.

Summary: Venture
capitalists have heavily invested in patent ownership companies that extort
payment for patents they control.? Scary because the USPO has issued
thousands of patents for software ideas.? As in "online backup"
is covered by over 3,000 patents, of which at least three have identical
titles.? (So much for "non-obvious and unique") ?

scripting something is the backup plan. I just wanted to see if such a wheel
already existed before I go inventing my own :)

also, dig appears to return status code 0 no matter what, so I'd have to
script on some other util. "host" is my favorite in general.

I don't think I am letting the cat out of the bag ... any hacker should 
know this already ... but one never knows ...
    (1) if you can do something manually (say at the CLI) you can 
automate that thing via a script (say BASH)
    (2) if the script can receive/intercept the response/output, or the 
response can be written to a file, that response can be interpreted
    (3) if the response can be interpreted, a decision process can be 
initiated.
Example:
    Query the DNS
    Read the reply
    Upon no change ... do nothing
    Upon change ... do something
For the delay between iterations, see "sleep"
To be sure the action/no action decision does not happen before the 
response, see "wait"
Hope this helps ... hope you play nice
Regards
Fred James

   Which is why some folks have tried to push patents back to things and not
ideas. So far they've been unsuccessful. Wait until someone patents the
whodunit genre of crime fiction and then tries to collect payments from
every other author.

   It never made sense to me why the USPTO ever allowed 'business processes'
and 'software' to be patented. Why not patent the use of the '+' sign and
the process of addition to get the sum of two numbers? Egregiousness taken
to the obscene extreme.

   Greed trumps ethics.

Assuming the DNS server in question has an IPv4 address of 12.13.14.15 
and the updated address of the host in question is 100.101.102.103, 
then

#!/bin/sh
DNSSRV=12.13.14.15
GOODIP=100.101.102.103
YOURHOST=your.hostname.com
MSG="Your DNS Record is Up to Date"

     echo "$MSG" | /bin/mail -s "$MSG" client at e-mail.com

   sleep 120
done

The work was done long ago; I too have occasion to check for updates

Well, I think that unless we have evidence to the contrary we should
consider everyone interested in Linux technology for honorable goals.

Any technique can be used for good or ill, starting with flint knives
and proceeding all the way up to quantum physics. CERN runs on Linux.

wes - I believe the command 'dig' might let you find out when any DNS
server has been updated. Run it as a cron job every five minute or so
and pipe its output to /var/log/messages, or something. I'd use that.

Sorry if i gave the impression i was withholding info based on suspicions of nefarious purposes. I've seen enough of wes' posts on here to know better, but was honestly baffled about what legitimate purpose could be served by knowing more about a dns update than "72 hrs for delegation changes, 15 min for zone updates".

Being in customer service, i should have guessed that an unreasonable client was behind it all.

The USPTO
didn't allow them to be patented until the court system insisted.
Some
saw the potential for profit and successfully sued the patent office into
granting 
software and business process patents.

Message-ID: <CACbpz1X3-Avp0BgoqaktF0f3y8Ps=j4MGifQzfizvq_hJHhohA@mail.gmail.com>

I've got a make question I'm hoping someone can help me with.

I have three Makefiles

Makefile.a
Makefile.b
and Makefile

Makefile contains all the real targets and the .a and .b files simply export
a couple of variables and include Makefile.  I want to eliminate Makefile.a
and Makefile.b by performing those exports dynamically based on the chosen
target, so "make mytargeta" would replace "make -f Makefile.a mytarget" and
"make mytargetb" would replace "make -f Makefile.b mytarget"
correspondingly.  I can easily mimic this with a shell script sitting in
front of the Makefile, but I'd like to do it using only make if possible.
I'm coming to the conclusion that there's no provision in make for this.
The targets are inherited and fairly complex with multiple levels of
inclusion, so just rewriting all the makefiles is out of the question.  Any
suggestions?  I may just have to create a "build.sh"  which matches the
target given as an argument and invokes make with the correct -f option.
                    -Mike

I'm not sure I have enough info to really help, but it sounds like 
target specific variables might be useful.
http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Target_002dspecific

The make mailing list is both low traffic and helpful, so you might 
want to ask there.  I suspect you will need to provide more details 
though.

Yup.  That did the trick.  I was getting hung up on trying to remove the
need for the Makefile.a and Makefile.b instead of just making their use
transparent.

Evolution starts several other processes, ssh knows this and won't close 
the channel until those processes exit.  The evolution processes stay 
around even when you quit the program.  SSH -n -X user at host will tell 
SSH to not care about these other processes.  Even on a LAN you might 
have a better remote desktop experience using VNC.
SSH to the remote node, start vnc-server.
On your local desktop use vnc-viewer remotehost:1
You can just leave evolution running then and reconnect to VNC whenever 
you need to check mail.

H.R. 1249, which changes
the U.S. patent system to the European model,  from "first to invent"
to "first to file".   That makes it a lot easier for a patent troll
to file a patent on your great open source idea.

I thought that under present law, a patent must be applied for before public
disclosure.  Is this correct?  Does 1249 change that?  If it does not
change, does not something disclosed as open source protect it from
patenting?

if you have a fujitsu, that implies frame relay and i don't know that it
can go past 1.5m.  you may need to get converted to atm (westel boxes,
last i looked) to get the higher speed.  also, the isp has to update
things on their end to send traffic to you at the higher speed, but i'd
guess they are on top of that.

Subject: [PLUG] Confused about multi core processors...
Message-ID: <1311822979.10799.8.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

I have a D945GCZ Intel Motherboard with an LGA 775 processor socket and
a 3.06 Ghz P4 on it.  I'm trying to stream mpeg 4 files to a television.
So far, I'm testing playback using the onboard video.  I notice there
are stopping issues with the video.  Obvious question, do I need a video
card?  Maybe I need to upgrade from 1 gig to 4 gigs of ram, not too
expensive.  Maybe I need a faster processor?  It appears that I can
install a Pentium D processor, but these are very inefficient processors
power wise and I'd have to switch to 64 bit CentOS.  Apparently, Core
Duo processors are 32 bit and multi core but I can't find any.  There
are Celeron D processors as well to confuse matters more.  There are
Core 2 Quad and Core 2 Duo processors, but these don't seem to be
compatible with my motherboard.  I'm ordering an Nvidia GT220 video
card, I'm hoping that will work well in Linux.

The trouble obviously is that there are three upgrade paths.  I can
increase the memory, I am upgrading the video, and I can change the
processor.  So there are two upgrade paths left assuming that I have
chosen wisely when it comes to the video card.  Do I need to run the
other two upgrade paths down?

Does MPEG4 playback require a dual core or better processor?

Will an atom processor outperform a Pentium 4?

1) Discrete video card will very likely help
2) RAM upgrades will almost always help
3) Atom CPU is not compatible with LGA775, it is a low power mobile CPU,
think netbooks, and at some point tablets.  Not what you want to look for,
at least not for this mobo.
It most certainly will NOT outperform a P4, though it is newer, it is not
geared toward performance, it is geared toward low power use and small form
factor.
4) Your CPU probably isn't the bottleneck, it is most likely: one of the
data buses (front side bus for example, and the bus speed of the CPU),
amount of RAM, speed of RAM (DDR2 on your mobo, but also look at the speed,
400mhz, 533mhz, 667mhz), type and speed of video card.
While a 3.06Ghz P4 isn't a speed demon compared to newer stuff, it should be
plenty horsepower for video streaming.

If you want to go dual core, I would suggest a newer mobo, and a Core 2 Duo
or Sandy Bridge chipset "Core i" series, such as i3, i5, i7.

   Sure enough, I need a new 'modem' (bridge). Verizon/Frontier was supposed
to have upgraded my circuit and bridge last year, but I'm not the only one
they didn't do. Aracnet sent me the new tiny bridge so we'll make the switch
Monday or Tuesday; when I can no longer get on the 'Net I'll swap hardware.

Thanks for the pointer, Joe!

<blush/>

The man pages for the various subcommands available via the openssl 
binary have improved tremendously since the first version of that 
article went online seven years ago.

OTOH, I know that the openssl binary was originally intended to be 
nothing more than an example of how to use the various features of the 
OpenSSL libraries. It wasn't intended to be the nearly indispensible 
utility it has become, which may help to explain the originally 
marginal documentation that accompanied it.

Still, it can be hard to figure out exactly which man page to consult 
for various tasks. The openssl package that ships with CentOS 6 
includes 53 man pages. (That's not the openssl-devel package, just the 
base package!) So a cookbook-style article is still worthwhile, even 
if the man pages now to many more how-to examples than they did back 
in 2004.

Matt has already addressed most of your questions and I concur. As to
multicore processors, depending upon what software application you're
using MPEG4 playback might be single-threaded so the raw speed of the
processor and not how many cores it has will in that case limit speed.

As Matt said, the CPU might not be the bottleneck causing a slowdown.

The easiest way to see if it's single-threaded, and whether the CPU is a
bottleneck, is to install a visual monitor. There a several, however I
like gkrellm. It's easy to configure and will show this at a glance.

HTH,
Robert

That's easier than
running top and enabling per core view by pressing the 1 key?

Message-ID: <20110729100605.6d9f78b4@mailhost.pdx.edu>

This was my third year manning the PLUG booth at OSCON (with lots of
help from Dave Mandel) and, as before, it was a high point of the year.

The most fun was meeting people engaged in all kinds of open source
activity. Some that stand out in my memory:

	A fellow from Singapore who had started a LUG, but wanted
	suggestions for ways to get it more active. 

	A fellow from Turkey, with whom I discussed the fascinating
	and unusual Turkish language.

	A lady from Uruguay who discussed their national internet
	access and the success of the One Laptop per Child program
	there.

I attended only a couple of the sessions, but both were highly
interesting and well done. It was also cool to have Free Geek as
booth-neighbors. This was their first year with a booth and they did
very well selling T-shirts and promoting interest. 

We handed out 96 PLUG flyers and a couple dozen business cards.
Interest varied from experienced Linux users who wanted to know about
our meetings to newcomers whose focus was on the Clinics. And there were
lots of fallen-away PLUGGERs as well as familiar faces. 

At the end we received donations of left-over schwag from other
exhibitors, including boxes of Linux Pro magazine. The spoils will be
handed out at the general meeting this coming Thursday.

All in all, a fun and productive week. And my hat is off again to
O'Reilly for a terrific show.

That works, too, yes. To each their own, and whatever floats your boat.
I just like gkrellm because it is visual, and shows a lot of data fast.

I keep one instance running stacked monitor panes, on the left side of a
virtual desktop updating every 1/10th second, using merely 1% of CPU.

But now I'm curious. What did you see? Is MPEG4 playback multithreaded?

If so, what application are you using that multithreads an MPEG4 codec?

Whether it multithreads or not, is it saturating one or more CPU cores?

If not, look to your video graphics card (and its memory size, perhaps)
and the installed memory size and speed, as has already been suggested.

Are you streaming video from the 'net? If so, the delays might be there
as opposed to in your own system. If not, what hard drive's driving it?

At some risk of preaching to the choir (albeit qualified, having served
on the editorial review board of the Computer Measurement Group in some
previous life), the process of finding performance bottlenecks involves
looking at and measuring the use of every resource used by some process.

You get adequate performance when the most heavily stressed resource is
not maxed out by the processing you're trying to support on the system,
where the 'system' can involve resources that you have no control over.

That's my two cents worth, anyway.

FWIW, I've seen a few distros where top (and other tools) show
processes, not necessarily their threads. The two are not the same
thing. There are specific flags/arguments you have to throw in.

Making it even messier, threads are *usually* pinned per process, per
core, so a process view might be all you need, but if threads are
talking across processes, and across cores,... yeah.

YMMV,

I was browsing around (looking at some bike sites) when a window popped up:

cancel           leave

I closed the popup and tried to close the tab, but the popup returned.  I
repeated this numerous times with no change in result.

I then tried to close Chrome.  No effect.  I tried in Top to kill Chrome,
but that did nothing either. I finally shut down, not knowing what was going

Any ideas?

The issue may not be with chrome in particular ... I have seen the same 
behavior in recent weeks/months, in Firefox (3.6.11), Seamonkey 
(1.1.10), and Epiphany (2.20.0) ... my only answer also has been to 
force quit ... sometimes the browser will force quit, sometimes I have 
to kill Gnome (<Ctrl-Alt-Backspace>), and sometimes I have just rebooted 
(although I don't think a reboot was ever necessary).

My spouse who uses Seamonkey 2.1.x has also had the same issue ... her 
fuse in shorter than mine and I believe she usually just 
reboots/resets.  I know she hates pop ups and quickly leaves any site 
that uses them.

I should be interested in any suggestions or insight, as well
Regards
Fred James

> Huh, this is interesting. I have been running Chrome exclusively on Debian
since it was first released and I'm a very active web user. I've never
experienced this behavior. I'm currently running version 7.0.517.44 with the
content settings for pop-up set to not allowed and I have the Adblock
extension installed.

Also, when a page gets wonky, you can usually kill the page itself via the
Chrome Task Manager. Also, from the command line, can you not do a "killall
chrome"?

My biggest trouble with Chrome is that the flash plugin seems to crash a
lot. Especially, when I have multiple tabs open with sites that are flash
heavy...

Subject: [PLUG] AMD HD5450 problems...
Message-ID: <1312089590.2967.11.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

I think another one has blown.  The proprietary Linux driver is no good,
Catalyst needs to be fixed.  I think this video card only works well
in Windows 7.  I can't even get the card to post right now.  I get a
no input error.  So, I've switched to the Internal VGA port.

I might be able to use the VGA output on the HD5450, but I shouldn't
have to.

Anyone have any idea at all why the HDMI port on the HD5450 goes out?
It fails so completely that the computer won't even display video at
POST.

This motherboard has a standard PCI express port, can I replace this
junk video card with one that will perform well under Linux?  I want
something that does NOT need a proprietary driver like Catalyst which
has serious bugs.

I am not sending this video card in for replacement again.  It should
not be failing so soon, the card should work with the board as it came
with the Barebones kit.  I went to AMD thinking, maybe my video woes
will end.  Now I'm thinking, AMD is as bad or worse than Intel.

Message-ID: <1312095796.3723.5.camel@eagle64.robinson-west.com>

Are most or all PCI express video cards these days designed for
encrypted Blu Ray disc compatibility?  I don't want to deal with
anything encrypted and I certainly don't want a video card that
will keep me from viewing certain content.  This is one reason 
why a lot of folks stay away, far away, from Windows.  I'm 
looking for a high end PCI express graphics or at least one
that doesn't require proprietary drivers to work under Linux.
The card must have an HDMI port and I prefer that that be all 
that it has.  I have an onboard vga port, so if I want a second
monitor, I can use that.

You are asking the wrong question, more or less.  What you need to ask
is "are all the hardware components, my OS, and all the drivers in my
system certified so that I could play Blu Ray?"

Which...

...you ain't going to get (legally) because there is no legal Blu-Ray
player for Linux so far as I know.  (Also, I don't believe anything
with an open driver will do the acceleration you want, but I would put
less faith in that assertion than the licensing one. :)

Personally?  I would just buy a Blu-Ray player box if I wanted to
watch the things.  Any real computing platform is going to make it
way, way more pain than just pirating the content would be.  For your
protection, of course. ;)

I'm not trying to pirate Blu-Ray discs.  I do have a legal right to
circumvent copy protection for making legitimate backup copies if I own
the Blu-Ray disc.  I so far am not dealing with Blu-Ray discs.  I'm
merely trying to replace the AMD Radeon HD5450 that burned out, 
second time, which was installed in my desktop computer.  I don't care
about plugging in HD tv's and if I want a second monitor, I have a VGA
plug on the motherboard.

Don't confuse my video card burning out again with a separate project
I'm working on to build a Linux based set top box.  For the set top
box, I'm merely trying to set the computer up on one of the inputs
of an HDTV and I have numerous movies ripped to m4v files sitting on a
local hard drive.  Hopefully, overscan won't be a problem with the
NVIDIA GeForce 220 low profile card I'm getting.  I also have pictures
on the set top computer.  Even Blu-Ray players get to be a royal pain
if you have any decent number of Blu-Ray discs.  This is what large hard
drives are for.
