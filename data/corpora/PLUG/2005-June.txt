Does your apache search  /etc/apache2/site-enabled/default for more  
config info?
I just leave the virtual host in the http.conf file for few sites but 
for large number of sites, I create a new directory  /etc/httpd/virtual/ 
and add domain.conf for each site.
then in httpd.conf add
include virtual/*.conf

If you are using hosts then only that machine will know the virtual 
sites. each domain would have to be added to the DNS for all machines to 
know where the IP of the virtual hosts is.

I went through this a couple months back, so I don't recall the details. 
The key is that there is a second place that you have to make entries in 
the httpd.conf file.

I don't have time to look right now because that machine is down stairs and 
I haven't looked at it in months. It just sits there and works, unlike the 
windows that I am writing this on.

I checked a copy of the httpd.conf on my pendrive, which may not be 
current, but it has the following:

### Section 3: Virtual Hosts
#
  . . . . . .  (left out stuff)
#
# Use name-based virtual hosting.
#
NameVirtualHost *:80

  . . . . . .  (left out stuff)

<VirtualHost *:80>
         ServerName 209.210.229.130
         DocumentRoot /var/www/html
         ServerSignature email
         DirectoryIndex  index.php index.html index.htm index.shtml
         LogLevel  warn
         HostNameLookups off
</VirtualHost>

# Virtual host Virtual Host 0
<VirtualHost *:80>
         ServerName www.schoppformetro.com
         ServerAlias schoppformetro.com
         DocumentRoot /var/www/w-schopp/html
         DirectoryIndex  index.php index.html index.htm index.shtml
</VirtualHost>

I think that all that only serverName, ServerAlias and DocumnetRoot are 
required.

My biggest problem getting it to work turned out to be permissions. (pay 
close attention to the content of error messages)

If this doesn't solve your problem, let me know & I will get you a copy of 
the whole file from the machine.

Good luck JK

Bill, 

    I think you need something like: 

//server/datashare    /share    smbfs    username=guest,rw,gid=500    0
0

Where 500 is your common gid (users or something).

Hi folks,

anyone have experience colo'ing boxes there?  Is there a "word on the

You could just use #tvlinux on Freenode. BTW, OSU sponsors a Freenode
server (niven.freenode.net).

I have only been a user on IRC so my admin abilities are null.  I have

I've just put a box there myself after having some
issues at another local colo. They seem to have a
professional operation there, and the prices are good.


The service so far has been decent, but the email tech
support has been slow to respond.

But I haven't even switched our production sites there
yet (one or two weeks away) so it's too early to tell
overall.

Hello!

I use Infinity Internet and find them to be as good as anyone 
else and better than most. I have had to use the tech support 
and have found them to go out of their way to help me.

I recommend them.

   Anyone here using Qt for developing application GUIs? I'm trying to work
through the designer tutorial (the Color Tool one) and find that I'm missing
files that are supposed to be included. This is with the local qt-3.3.3
installation.

   Are the other pieces available separately? I have what came with the
Slackware-10.1 package.

Group,

I finally got the result I was seeking: a wide open smb share mounted via
/etc/fstab .  Gid/uid of 99 is the "nobody" user, the same one that shows

What are the permissions on /share?  Who are the user and group? What are
the permissions of //server/datashare on the Windows system?  Is there a
guest id ( with no password ) on the Windows system?

So after all those questions I'll supply some settings that ahve worked for
me ( YMMV ).

in /etc/fstab

//server/datashare /mount/point smbfs
credentials=/etc/samba/datashare,port=44

in /etc/samba/datashare

username=joeblow
password=xyzzy

/mount/point is joeblow:joeblow ug=rwx

The documentation indicates you may be able to set the group on /mount/point
to "users" and put all your users in that group and add an option the
gid=users to the fstab entry.

Top-posting without trimming your response is bad form on email, by the way.

Are you connected to Freenode already?  If so, join #tvlinux and I'll

I did some development with QT 3.2.1.  The Distributions that I was working
with didn't seem to come with everything.  I ran head long into the same 
problem.  Everything seemed to work correctly except when I went and 
tried to follow the tutorials.  A couple of problems is that the online
docs and tutorials match up with the most current release.  These may
or may not use features that are only available with the new version.

My solution was to download a tar package from the trolltech web site and
build it.  Once I did that, everything work including getting the
tutorials working.
If you do build it, don't set for static libraries as some of the features of
the QT designer won't function correctly with the static libraries.

Larry,

   I'm glad that it's not just me or Slackware. Whew! I've had my share of
user-induced problems over the years.

   I'm running version 3.3.3; I doubt there are enough differences in 3.3.4
to be meaningful to me. However, ...

   I think that I'll do this with the 3.3.4 release. It will also give me the
opportunity to see if checkinstall will work because it didn't when I tried
it on slackware-10.0 with a source tarball.

Many thanks,

The install is more like follow the directions in the readme and install files.
There doesn't seem to be a true install of the package.

Here is the simplified install (from memory so beware)
unpack the tar in a location that you want it. 
point the necessary env-vars to that directory.
do ./configure in that dir.
do make and wait a long time ( I think it is longer than a kernel clean build)
symlink the dir into your /usr/lib dir replacing the existing qt dir.
put env-vars for the qt dir into your startup shell scripts.

For some reason I could not build all of the system as a user and have
it work (tried at least twice).  Had to build it as root.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0506020943180.24665@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   The latest Linux Journal has a brief article on rekall, so I thought I'd
give it a test drive with the contact management system. However, I cannot
navigate around the <http://www.rekallrevealed.org/> database in either
firefox-1.0.4 or opera-8.0. The latter won't properly display the index page
and the latter shows only the index page, or the first page of the Docs
section. I can get to the blog and faq pages, but what I want is to download
the source tarball and I cannot get there (or to the 'contact us' page) at
all.

   I've also tried links, lynx, and wget. With the first I see some of the
index page, but I cannot get to a download or contact page. With the second
I get nothing but a blank window. With the third ('wget -r -k -p
http://www.rekallrevealed.org/'), I get only the index page.

   Is this something here or is something badly broken on their web site?

Thanks,

   Thanks, Brent. I was passed that URL by a friend a short while ago.

   I have javascript turned on, despite my aprehensions, because it seems to
be required by almost all sites. Not a good introduction to the quality of

Subject: [PLUG] UPS battery and Linux
Message-ID: <BAY20-F348A2B0644F7BE203BB7BCB8060@phx.gbl>


Dear All:

I have a rather stupid question hopefully someone can help me.

I never own a UPS battery till just weeks ago.  I finally
got around to install it with my Linux box.  It works fine.  The UPS
is nice enough to come with Linux driver and I managed to configure
it to talk to the UPS directly via serial link and SNMP.  I tested
that my linux box is gracefully shutdown after the UPS detected that power 
is lost.

I then noticed that ACPI isn't compiled into the kernel so I am in the 
process
of doing so.  For now, the graceful shutdown won't bring the whole box
to power shutdown.  It will just stop at "power down" message.
So someone has to power it down and power it back up when power restores.

My question is, even with ACPI installed and the box does power down
all the way,  someone will have to still power it back up later.  It is not 
obvious
to me if there is anyway the PC can power cycle itself after a power outage 
is over.
Without the UPS, the BIOS can reboot the box when power is back up.  This
won't allow for a graceful shutdown but at least the box is up whenever
power is back on.

Is there anyway, with UPS connected that my Linux box can boot up by
itself when power restores?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0506021350090.24665@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   After a four-hour exercise in frustration in trying to find and build
rekall (a dbms RAD described in the latest Linux Journal), I joined their
mail list and learned three interesting things:

   1.) Their web site is quite old and may or may not work with a particular
browser/version depending on ... the phase of the moon? Anyway, it's hit or
miss and not consistent.

   2.) If one wants to build a qt-only version, without KDE, one needs to
download the head of the cvs tree, run it through a pre-compilation filter
to remove the kde references, then build it. However, this version lags the
kde-specific version in terms of features and (apparently) bug fixes.

   3.) It's really a KDE application and not designed to be fully deployable
under any other desktop/window manager.

   Oh, well. Back to PyQt, Qt-designer, and papyrus.

I'm having problems trying to run mozilla on a remote Solaris 8 machine
over a forwarded X11 connection.  If firefox is already running on my local
machine and I try to run mozilla on the remote machine, another *local*
firefox window comes up.  Here's the setup and an example:

Local machine is RH9 i386 running NIS and exporting home directories
via NFS.

Remote machine is Solaris 8 sparc.  Home directories are NFS automounts
of local machine's home directories.

If I were just browsing the Web, this would be fine, but I need to view
files which are only accessible to the remote machine.  What is the
correct way to do this?  I assume this is happening because of my
home directory automount.

I don't think so.  I've seen the same sort of behavior.  Maybe just with 
--display ?

Has it started defaulting to this behavior at some point?

Running X over an SSH tunnel is painful. What I do is run tinyproxy on
the remote server, then set up a tunnel to the machine running
tinyproxy. The browser runs on your local machine and has access to the
resources on the remote network over a secure connection. 

I'm assuming that the remote workstation is behind a firewall or at
least a NAT router. You probably don't want to be a proxy for the world.

That's really odd.

You mean view local files in a browser? Or do you need to run an xterm
for some reason? The proxy trick works great if you want to view the
files in a browser.

Yeah, I've fought with this before too.  Nice in some respects, really
annoying in others.  I think the solution I found was to start with

At that level, it's highly unlikely that any damage would result from 
the PC losing power, but it won't come back up when power returns.

In the BIOS, there is usually a setting that determines what happens 
when a system gets power back. If it's set to boot upon power 
restoration, then it will do so.

Here's the rub.

The UPS will continue to feed power to the system for a while. Could be 
a long while if nothing is draining it, and then power is restored.

So, you will want to have some other way to make the system come back 
up. Possibly wake on lan. Although, I can see pitfalls with that.

If your switch is powered by the UPS, then it won't lose power, and the 
system would come back up if any other systems on your net sends a 
broadcast packet...

If your switch isn't on the UPS, then any power glitches possibly knock 
you off the net while the switch resyncs... and your switch isn't 
protected by the UPS.

I believe most systems are set to only power down the system after a 
pre-determined amount of time has passed without power. That works well 
in our area, since most power outages are relatively short. At least, 
I've only had one outage last more than a minute in the 6 years I've 
been in Portland. So it might be worth it to find out how long your 
system will be able to be without power, and configure accordingly.

Wake on LAN, wake on ring. Both work, both have other conciderations.

Is this an open-source project?  Do they want somebody to do a new

If you use it, you would add a KDE requirement to your users, but
probably not require they actually be running KDE to use it.  I know of
no applications, personally, that actually *require* KDE be running...

Rob,

   Yes and no. The rekallrevealed.org site is for open source download while
the totalrekall.co.uk site is for the commercial license and pre-built
binaries download. You can certainly ask them; I'd use the totalrekall site
for contact information.

   theKompany is apparently no longer an authorized supplier of the
application. They were in 2001-2003, but the main author did not renew the
agreement.

Nifty-keen.  SELinux is near the top of my "need-to-learn-more" list.

Hmmm ... it looks from first glance that this tool only does the sort of
things that Microsoft Access does. Have you looked at "pgaccess", which
is an Access-like front end for PostgreSQL? Have you looked at
DBDesigner4, which is an "Erwin-like" database interface for just about
any offboard RDB? And the beta of OpenOffice 1.9.xxx has a database that
looks a *lot* like Access.

I do a fair amount of data pre-processing in MS Access; I've never
bothered to learn how to write applications or do reports, but I
understand it's good for that sort of thing up to a certain scale.

   Good point. I've never used Access but I've not heard many good things
about it.

Thanks for the responses!

Wil's suggestion got me part way there.  

I created a second profile.  When I run "mozilla -P 2nd_profile", now I
get a mozilla window from my remote machine.  Unfortunately a second
invocation of the same command doesn't get me a second window, it brings
up the profile manager.  When I choose "2nd_profile", it refuses to run
because the profile is already in use.

To explain my setup a further, I have a Solaris machine on my local
network which I use to run EDA tools.  The Solaris machine is headless,
so I ssh to it and invoke the tools.  The GUI interface gets displayed
on my main Linux machine.  Occasionally the EDA tools will want to run a
browser, often for documentation or to check for software updates.  The
documentation lives on the Solaris machine, so starting a local browser
is not useful.  I could export the necessary directories and NFS mount them
locally, but I was trying to avoid that hassle.  The ultimate solution is
to get native Linux versions of the tools.  I think this is possible now,
but I haven't yet gone down that path.

For the curious, the tools are Mentor Graphics' ModelSim (Verilog simulator)
and Altera's Quartus (CPLD & FPGA design tool).

Actually not.  There is more going on in that field than people realize.

Just describing how to use LSM would be a couple of hours, not to
mention the SELinux permission set, buffer overflow detection and format
bug protection.

Yesterday I got an error message where glibc actually recognized and
halted on a double free. That was new.

Since I was unable to ask at the meeting then. What have you heard of

heard so far sounds like an extremely bad idea, but I like to be able to
do better demolition on technical grounds than that.

What if your second invocatation is a bare "mozilla"?  Which machine's
mozilla spawns the new window?  I'd say there is a fair chance that it
sees its local (your remote) version first, and uses that to piggyback
on.

Your proposed method of requiring a majority of trusted key holders cooperate to recover an individuals private data is a good suggestion, but would require significant planning and coordination among the involved parties. It could possibly be more hassle than the average code warrior would want to deal with.

As a different alternative, I remember seeing an article a few years ago describing some sort of time based expiration of encryption keys. I can't find it on google, of course, but from memory the gist was a trusted source would distribute a set of encryption keys that were time stamped. You would separately encrypt the information with the dated key for when you would want that info available in case of loss of your private key due to death, imprisonment, whatever. At regular intervals, the trusted source would publish the decryption keys as each date occurred.

It would most likely be implemented in a similiar fashion to current SSL keys authentication, that is, everyone would have to agree on a trusted organization to house the master keys and distribute updates. And there would be a mechanism in place to automatically check for the latest decryption keys.

If it worked as planned, you could regularly make a backup of your information and encrypt it with a public date key. Every month or year, delete the old backup and re-encrypt. In a worst case scenario, whoever has access to your physical storage will be able to decrypt it at some pre-determined date in the future, but no sooner. The downside is that you would have to keep strict control of any such encrypted data. Any copies outside your control would be wide open after the specified date. It would make a great way to publish whistleblower letters to the public domain, however.

The author of the article was also touting the possibility of integrating the system with the electronic banking system, bringing up the possibility of writing post-dated electronic money transfers, if you will. Interesting idea, and I'll bet there is some startup company working on it right now.

Does anybody have a link to the original article or, better yet, a working example?

Thanks,

I might have partially answered my own question. Here is a paper that describes an email encryption system that can be used to generate messages that can only be decrypted at an arbitrary date in the future. Has anybody here dealt with this type of setup and happen to be willing to part with some insightful commentary?

HI

I am using apache2..

It does not use httpd.

So my fix was to use essentially what is in section 3 only it goes in

/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default

and I use IP not :80

Worked great..

Thanks for the feedback

Vram

Hello all,

   Just in case there are newbies out there like me, looking for a good and 
FREE Bash scripting guide, check out 
http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/linux-doc-project/abs-guide/
There are several formats.  I used the html version, and it works great.  I 
just started it, but looks like there is lots to learn there.  It appears to 
be very thorough for a guide.

Yes, that works as you expected.  However, since the browser is invoked
by the EDA tool, it's not very practical to be changing the browser
config option in the tool before every invocation.  I suppose a wrapper
script could take care of this, but this isn't important enough to
justify taking the time to do it.

Subject: [PLUG] Problem nfs-mounting "large files"
Message-ID: <20050603235937.0B671198C8@medulla.enet.sharplabs.com>


I have a large .iso image (4GB) on machine B which I have loopback
mounted to directory /mnt/disk.

When I try to nfs mount B:/mnt/disk to machine A I get a "permission
denied" error.

If I replace the 4GB image with, say, a 700MB .iso image, I have
no problem with the NFS mount.

I'm running the latest version of Mandriva (2005LE == Mandrake 10.2)
on machine B and Mandrake 10.0 on machine A.

While googling around on this problem I've seen references to "large
file" problems with rpc.mountd on older versions of nfs (like v. 2)
but my current systems are (I presume) running a later version (3 or 4).
Don't know how to find out which version however.

Can anyone help me fix this nfs mounting problem?

Dean

There may be a better way, but nfsstat or rpcinfo -p will tell you 
which version you are running.

Thanks Galen.

I don't see any version info in rpcinfo -p but nfsstat says that the nfs
server is running v3.  Any ideas why there seems to be a "small file" size
limit on the situation I'm running?

Ok, I'll ask  over there.

But from my google reading I see that mountd v2 seems to have "the problem" with
large files, and v3 does not.

On the server machine:

rpcinfo -p |fgrep mountd

    100005    1   udp    846  mountd
    100005    1   tcp    849  mountd
    100005    2   udp    846  mountd
    100005    2   tcp    849  mountd
    100005    3   udp    846  mountd
    100005    3   tcp    849  mountd

Any idea how to control which "mountd" gets used when I nfs-mount from the
client.

  A4. How can I prevent the use of NFS Version 2, or of other NFS versions?

    A. The protocol version is determined at mount time, and can be
    modified by specifying the version of the NFS protocol, or the
    version of the transport protocol, supported by the server. For
    example, the client mount command

    mount -o vers=3 foo:/ /bar will request that the server use NFS
    Version 3 when granting a mount request (Note that "vers" and
    "nfsvers" have the same meaning in the mount command; The string
    "vers" is compatible with NFS implementations on Solaris and other
    vendors). If you wish to prevent use of NFS Version 2 in all cases,
    then you must restart rpc.mountd on the server, with the option "-N
    1 -N 2". The best way to do this is to modify the nfs rpc.mountd
    configuration on the server by modifying the NFS startup script
    options, and then shutting down and restarting NFS as a whole:

        * cd /etc/rc.d/init.d
        * Modify RPCMOUNTDOPTS in the nfs script to include "-N 1 -N 2"
        * Restart nfs (you must have root access) with "./nfs restart"

    You will now get the following error when attemping to nfs mount a
    file system using NFS Version 2 (now unrecognized) after restarting
    rpc.mountd:

    mount: RPC: Unable to receive; errno = Connection refused

    You will also subsequently get the following (non-fatal) warning
    when you unmount any nfs mounted file system at all, regardless of
    when it was mounted:

    Bad UMNT RPC: RPC: Program/version mismatch; low version = 3, high version = 3



Once you've done the mount, I think you should be able to confirm the
version by watching the stats change in the nfsstats report.

Unfortunately I've found some nasty bugs in RH and others' mountd/nfsd
parsing,  even if you specify a no-version "-N whatever", it still
usually gets advertised and can still be used.  Linux's
nfsutils/util-linux mount doesn't always do what you tell it properly
either, when conneting to some NFS servers (NetApps), it usually takes
the server's preferred mount, and will not error and fail even if you
specify something different.

To drop support from the daemon runtime, do a:

rpcinfo -d mountd 2
rpcinfo -d nfsd 2

When issuing your mount from the client, do:

mount -o nfsvers=3,tcp <...whatever...>

If that is indeed your problem, it will allow you to test it.  I don't
 see the connection between the underlying filesystem size and any
filesize handling issue, after all you're not exporting a 4GB file,
you're exporting a filesystem.  I'm assuming you can properly see the
contents of the loopback mount locally on the box?

In my out-of-the-box Apache 2 httpd.conf the section on NameVirtualHost
reads:

   NameVirtualHost *

   # All VirtualHost definitions are in seperate files
   include /etc/httpd/conf/vhost.d

If yours does also I highly suggest going with the flow and creating
individual virtual host definition files in that directory[1]

This is _very_ easy to work with and adding additional named virtual
hosts is as easy as adding a file with contents similar to:

  <VirtualHost  *>
        ServerName dawg.patch.com
        ServerAdmin dawgadmin at patch.com
        DocumentRoot /var/www/dawg
        ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /var/www/cgi-bin/dawg/
        CustomLog /var/log/httpd/dawg-access.log combined
        ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/dawg-error.log
  </VirtualHost>

Then running the init script for apache with a "reload" parameter.


[1] Or creating another directory and identifying it at this point 
in the config file.

It uses some configuration file and that config file has directives on
how to handle named virtual hosts and you need to make changes there to
fix your problem.

It's not in front of me right  now.

It's called site-available.< or site-enabled>

And the fix was to use IP rather then 80..

Not sure why..  But, that worked.  So I never argue with success.. I 
just try to understand it..

Someone on this list had the answer.

Thanks for the reply

Hi Richard,

There is a mini-HOWTO on the Zip drives here:

http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/ZIP-Drive.html

It's about three years old, but I think it should still be pretty accurate.

Zip drives are strange.  Try this:

Create a /mnt/zip directory.

If the drive is an ide on /dev/hdb, then

  mount /dev/hdb4 /mnt/zip

The zip drive acts like a device with scsi id 4, but through IDE.  Makes
for a strange mount point.

I'm looking for an Open Source app for our in-house developers to use
for submitting changes to the Server Admins such as upgrading a
package, modifying config files, running SQL commands, etc.  Managers
would need to be in the loop for approving these changes before the
Admins see them.  Being able to search a history of changes per system
would be needed too.

Does anyone have any favorites or recommendations for this type of task?

Matt,

   I'm not sure I know exactly what you seek; I presume it's not a version
tracking system like subversion. Have you considered webcollab? I think that
will do what I believe you need.

Our developers make changes in a development environment.  Before
those changes are moved to production, their manager approves the
change.  Then the requested change is forwarded to the Server Admin
group to implement.  Sometimes the change is as simple as "Install
this RPM" and sometimes it involves a lot of SQL with numerous steps
done in a particular order for table changes, etc.  We want a better
way for the developer to make this request, for the manager to read
and approve this request, and for the admin to then implement the
request.  Later on if we discover a problem with a system, then we'd
like to search through the changes to narrow down which change most
likely caused the new problems.
Thanks,
~M

   Well, Matt, I'm not sure that webcollab is the right tool for this, but
you've certainly explained it much more fully. Here's the URL:
                      <http://webcollab.sourceforge.net/>

and here's the overall blurb:

"A collaborative web-based system for projects and project management;
WebCollab is easy to use, and encourages users to work together. The software
is functionally elegant and secure without being cumbersome for users, or
graphically intensive.

"The software is ideally suited to tracking multiple projects and innumerable
small tasks across an organisation of any size. If you have reminder notes
stuck all over your desk, then you need WebCollab!"

   Perhaps it will work for you.

Sounds a lot like a job-ticket system.  Request Tracker is my favourite.

In this case, devs would either email requests to RT or create tickets
in the web interface.  If managers need to approve, let them take
requests from the incoming ticket queue and either deny each ticket or
assign it to a tech (or even to an "approved" ticket queue.)

Heck, you could give each manager or department its own "approval"
queue, with its own email address.

RT is nice because folks get a decent amount of email feedback about how
their request is being handled, without it being overwhelming.
It's also pretty configurable, with permissions, custom fields and such.

I've found a ticket system to be essential.  Just make sure someone is
repsonsible for making sure tickets don't back up in the queue or get
stale.  We did this on a rotating basis at OSDL.

Actually, I'm kinda surprised RT hasn't caught on in other areas
besides IT.  It's a great way to keep track of who's handling what,
and how it's all going.

Maybe if it cost $5000 per seat and only ran on AS/400,
  Aaron

   Good call. RT is used by the GRASS development team to record bugs and

Cool!  It's great software.

Sure.  But while RT can act kinda like a bug-tracking system,
bug-trackers and trouble-ticket systems are rather different,
close-up.  A robust bug-tracker deals with workflow, versioning and
permissions issues that a trouble-ticket system should never see.

But most orgs don't need all that folderol.  The ones that do need it
get proprietary and/or custom stuff, or put up with Bugzilla.

Yes it is surprising since there are three products based on RT.

I'm not sure about the *UG discounts, but if you want to get in
*really* cheap, you may be able to sign up to be a volunteer (which
gets you into the conference if you're willing to spend half a day
checking badges.)

It is great that Sarge became stable, I will still never like the model 
of frozen releases without updates (except very important ones).

I don't see why the Apple switch is bad. They're using Intel chips, they 
are still Mac computers. On the demo from Steve's Keynote, the Mac was 
performing much better (smoother, even) than our dual G5 at work, and 
that on only one Pentium 4.

The fact that they have something already there for delivery, when 
Microsoft (which has ALWAYS used x86) is so far behind is laughable.

Not necessarily x86, but Intel. Part of the problem was that IBM
couldn't come up with a 64-bit chip suitable for Apple laptops. So I
would imagine you'll see an x86-64 PowerBook.

I almost bought a mini Mac the other day. If I could only get past that
stinking one-button mouse ... :)

I'll have to assume you've never programmed an x86 at the assembly
level.  It is indeed a very very cold day in hell.

The fact that the development system they're accepting orders for 
includes a 3.6ghz Pentium 4... it's at least x86-based (if not a P4 on 
it's own).

Oh yes, there's something else I should have added.  Despite it being
such a cold day in hell, not to worry.  With the power dissipation of
the typical P4, it will soon be nice and warm.

FWIW, the minis do not even come with a mouse.  So you can plug in just
about any 3-button wheel mouse or whatnot and it will work fine, no
drivers needed.

Just underclock the P4 so that its performance rating matches that of a 
laptop-capable G4. Heat worries will disappear! :-)

More to the point, IBM seemingly didn't want to throw its weight behind 
the development of a serious mobile CPU for general-purpose computing. 
My reading is that Apple is all about mobility: the G5 desktops and 
Xserve units are sexy, but it's the laptops that are selling OS X these 
days. If PowerPC wasn't going to make a serious play in the 
mobile-performance category, then Apple did the right thing.

...Intel being a subset of x86 these days.  Sure, they have the Itanium
II and the Xeon EMT64 chips, but their consumer-grade chips are all x86.

If Apple wanted to move on in to the 64-bit world, the clear choice
would be AMD, with affordable and well-tested x86-64 chips... ones that
actually go in laptops.  :-)

I don't personally think we'll see an x86-64 PowerBook.

   According to PJ on groklaw.net, industry pundits think that IBM wanted to
shed the low volume Apple business and focus on their high-margin server
chips. In any case, who knows? More to the point, does it really matter?

Our dear friend Randal Schwartz has been using a Mac for some time,
mostly because they are Unixoid, and fun to use, but partly because
they are Intel-free.  For Randal's sake, I am bummed. 

Hell indeed. :-(

So Randal, what's it going to be?  AMD+Linux+Funky, or Intel+Mac+Fun?
Or will you leave computing behind you, and become a professional
entertainer? 

Expiring minds want to know...

That is the smallest of all the x86 offenses. The PowerPC mnemonics all
have the destination register as the first one. x86's problems are the
mere 8 sort of general-purpose registers and just plain overall bizzare
design. Notably multiply instructions always use EAX and EDX. Don't get
me started on the SSE vector unit, that is *really* *bizzare*. They
designed the MMX unit 4 years earlier, which was decent within its
limitations; then they produce the SSE unit which is *horrific*. WTH were
they thinking?!

PowerPC has 31 truely general-purpose registers, and is just plain very
well designed. I can easily do a huge number of things with the PPC
vector unit (while SSE is useless except for a few things it was
deliberately designed for). Doesn't have conditional moves, but because
instructions don't have to write the status register, spacing branches
far away from the condition is easy. The multiply-add instructions are
nice too (even has vector multiply-add).

The suggestion that Intel will make chips that conform to the PPC
specification is kind of wild, but you never know. Note that they're
already doing three architectures, ia32 (soon the amd64 extensions too),
ARM and ia64. Adding a fourth would be a little wild, but they've
certainly got the ability. Apple would be crazy to go for a non-64bit
chip, this means either amd64 or PPC (ia64 isn't appropriate for
laptops).

Hi,

I'm working on a project that involves having users log into a web site,
select their options, and have the remote server run a local application
on the user's machine with the appropriate command line switches based
on their selections.

I've looked at XML-RPC. Is this the best way to go about this?

I'm surprised not to find more discussion along these lines here.

I personally don't care about "Linux desktop vendors" (whoever THEY are), 
but I certainly think that this is more about getting OSX running on 
everybody's home PC.  Everybody knows Apple has a better interface. 
Everybody knows that Microsoft sucks ass.  And since iTunes is such a big 
hit, folks are looking more and more toward Apple.  (I have thought 
recently that iTunes was intentionally not rolling out an integrated video 
player so that Microsoft wouldn't immediately target them as a threat. 
Already, folks prefer it to Windows Media Player for their music.  It'll 
be doing movies soon and then it'll be on everyone's desktop... the OS is 
next.)

But they have hardware... and they have a kind of investment.  There's a 
sort of religion out there where folks say, "I'm a PC guy... Macs are cool 
and all, but too sleek and hermetic."

I think they're pretending this is about changing chipsets and it's really 
about taking down Microsoft.

I don't really like the idea of one piece of proprietary software 
replacing another, but at least it's unix and has a chance of being 
useful!

Cheap hardware and OSX is probably exactly what Microsoft fears most.

Intel is already doing amd64 (x86-64) extensions...

And I can't imagine Apple wants to support two architectures
indfinitely.  I'm pretty sure when they say they're moving to Intel
chips, they mean x86.. maybe x86-64, but Intel's x86-64 chips have thus
far been only Xeons.

This is far less proprietary than Windows, though.. which makes me quite
happy.

It'll be very interesting to see how this all plays out... remember, the
bigger the market share Apple gets from Microsoft, the more well
supported OS X will be by developers and it is a much smaller leap from
OS X to Linux than from Windows to Linux.

I don't know about that.  
(a) Apple is initially rolling out a dev box that, while it's
P4-based, is supposedly not PC-compatible.  And they've proven over the
years that they can sell their own closed hardware at a profit.  
(b) I seriously doubt that they want to support the vagaries of
generic PC hardware.  $150 for a copy of OSX for the PC probably
wouldn't cover driver development, let alone support.
(c) With Wine, they'll be able to run major Windows apps seamlessly at
native speed, eliminating a major barrier to Switching.
(d) With closed hardware and Intel's on-CPU DRM, they'll be able to
roll out the locked-up you-don't-own-anything media terminal that
Hollywood desperately wants.  And Jobs desperately wants to sell^Wrent
movies and TV through iTunes.

I can go the new lab at PSU and watch people walk past the rows of
unused iMacs (with Office and IE) to wait in line for Winders PCs.
I don't know why they do it, but I doubt OSX for PCs would change that.

MS won't suffer, short-term.  They collect Windows Tax no matter what
OS the PC ends up running, and they make money on Office no matter
what OS it runs on.  Long-term, if Apple can make iTunes media-rental
work, they can make software-rental work too, which is MS' Nirvana.

It's Brand X vs. Brand Y to me.  All software sucks; OSS sucks less
because backdoors are harder and license-management is easier.

According to Apple, people will be able to put Windows on their new Mac, 
this is PC compatible. More likely, they stick some checks in OS X to 
see if it really is a Mac...

Most drivers are provided by manufacturers, which is why hardware comes 
with driver cds. There are general windows ones, and bundles 
manufacturer drivers, but it's still not an issue of development and 
support for the drivers side.

Wine will hopefully get a boost, but I would hardly call it seamless.

AFAIK, Intel has said that there is NO DRM on their new chips, other 
than that one rumor.

That's because iMacs suck... unless it's a newer one.

Microsoft only gets money for PC's that ship with Windows, that's why 
you can get your windows money back if your PC company ships you Windows 
and you don't use it...

OSS is much easier to port to the Mac than Windows, especially now. This 
will be a huge benefit to Apple, and developers that might want to use 
the Mac.

Right. The challenge is that the application I wish to run uses a
peer-to-peer networking paradigm, not client/server. That means that I
have to find a way to join multiple remote computers together from a
central location.

Think of it like an old switchboard, who's operator receives an incoming
connection, asks for the connection type (destination IP, port number,
etc. to mix the metaphor), and then rings the opposite end.

In this case, the "ringing" is starting a client on each end via an RPC
call to the remote computers; one will have the --host switch while the
other gets the --join switch.

After the central server has sent the RPC calls to the remote machines,
it's out of the loop-the two peers now communicate directly.

Of course I'll do this via a secure line but that's not the nut I'm
trying to crack at the moment.

Not on server chips yet, and more importantly not yet on laptop chips.
This doesn't rule out them doing PPC chips, they've got the ability,
question is whether they'll do so.

I note that given Apple's time frame, they /could/ change their minds

Nope. Desktop chips only, and worse *not* *all* desktop chips. Looks like
Sun plans to support both amd64 and UltraSPARC for a good long while. Not
too difficult actually if you keep your code endian-safe, and confine
your hardware-specific bits carefully.

And how often have you seen non-wintel drivers on those CDs? The USB
keyfobs HP was giving out at OSCON last year came with a wintel driver
CD, even though that was clearly not something anyone there would of
needed...

On the original topic, I'm glad Debian has produced another release. I'm
actually surprised they got it out this quickly. It hasn't even been a
full 4 years.

Subject: [PLUG] granting host access to a CUPS servers printer?
Message-ID: <861x7duvbz.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I have been playing with CUPS, considering converting from BSD lpd.
This is on Debian.  I can print locally, from the host with the
printer.  I have the server's /etc/cups/cupsd.conf configured to
listen on an inside interface, but a client host on that network isn't
able to print anything.  I get a message in the the client's
/var/log/cups/error_log "Unable to get printer status
(client-error-forbidden)!"  On the server's /var/log/cups/error_log I
get '"POST /printers/dj HTTP/1.1" 403 0'.  I presume I need to add
something to the server's /etc/cups/cupsd.conf to grant access to the
host, but I am not sure exactly what/where.  Google has been
recalcitrant.  CUPS docs are diffuse.  Hints?

Do you think home Windows users EVER use support?  Do you think they even 
expect it?

I'm not completely certain Apple wants to cater to Hollywood that way. 
Certainly their Rip-Mix-Burn campaign implied that they had a different 
idea about media.  Now, the iTunes/iPod stuff has a superficial DRM, but 
I'm still not convinced it isn't just window dressing to keep the RIAA off 
their backs.

The keyboards suck ass.  I use the Mac if I'm in a hurry or if there's a 
line... I just want a terminal and a web browser, anyway.  But the lack of 
a scroll-wheel and the crappy, sticky, gummy keyboards slow me down 
immensely.

(Incidentally, I also can't get the default terminal to do proper 
emulation back to my machines via ssh.  No matter what combination of 
things I try, backspace comes out as delete.  Bah.)

Like the support issue, Office is an issue with business, but not so much 
with home users.  If there's a good office suite available for free, 
people will use it at home.

Free Software does not suck because it's about people coming together with 
the best intentions and working hard for the mutual benefit of all.

Good question - I am a 'low-level' user and don't know of any Linux systems 
that really 'play' the USB game right, as in: You fire up your computer, and 
'whatever' you plug into that USB port pretty much works because the USB 
standard for interrogating what's just been plugged in is understood. Maybe 
we just need to wait until a later rev comes out that's fully plug-n-play for 
USB, but that's been like soccer fans waiting for soccer to get 'big' in the 
USA.

I am running Mandrake 10.0 right now, and while the system sometimes 
recognizes new things plugged into the USB port, (an icon appears on the 
desktop) it doesn't let you DO anything with them automatically. You probably 
have to open a commend shell and type in a bunch of cryptic crap, and you 
could search the Internet for DAYS and still not find a good explanatory 
site.

Your question has gone unanswered here for days because for the people who 
know how to answer it - it's too simple to bother with, and they are off 
discussing topics which are intellectually challenging to THEM - after all 
this is all a volunteer effort, so you do what you like and you don't have to 
do what you don't like. Linux programs will always have poorer UI's than Win 
or Mac becuase for the people who know how to program, the fun is in the 
programming, and once that's solved they're off discovering the core of next 
fun program - Porting the solved program out to the rest of the world is 
drudgery, so it often doesn't get done well in Linux, if at all. 

For now, I have an Iomega Zip drive and an external ZIP H/D kit with a 200-gig 
disk mounted inside. I cannot get Linux to plug-n-play the IOmega, and I 
haven't even tried the 200GB.

I used to cheat with a Win2K installation running under VMWare, plus a shared 
directory: Fire up VMWare, and plug that USB thingie in and 'voila' it works 
- then you can transfer the data into your shared directory and Linux can see 
it.

Another program you might try is puTTY - You can network a Win plug-n-play 
system to your Linux box and actually transfer files with one command from 
the Win-box.

It's not that I've never owned Intel.  I've never owned X86, because I
hate the architecture.

However, if Steve Jobs says X86 is it, then I'm there.  The fact that it's
Intel or AMD doesn't concern me a bit.

Here, have an Intel-based 64-bit *Xeon* server from Dell.  I use one of 
these, by the way, running 64-bit Linux.

All driver CDs for Intel server NICs come with Windows, Linux, Netware, 
and (I think) FreeBSD drivers supported by Intel itself.  Or if you 
prefer, you can download them from their web site.

It sure is tiring hearing the same old gibberish about Wintel, Wintel, 
Wintel.  If you're going to complain about Intel, at least get your 
facts straight.

Diffuse indeed!  I have a related question while we're on the subject:
I have CUPS running on one Debian-equipped host, and can print from
that host and from Windoze (via a URL to port 631), but can't figure
out how to print from other Debian hosts on the LAN.  Do those hosts
also need CUPS installed?

Thanks,

Better double-check your sources... 'cause I have shell access on a
system running FreeBSD I do some web design on.

It's a dual Xeon Dell 1U server with 2GB of RAM mounted in a rack in
Atlanta... running FreeBSD's amd64 port.

I have definitely not seen any x86-64 desktop chips from Intel, nor have
I read they're planning on releasing such things.

May I suggest that you upgrade to the latest version of Mandrake?

   We have a collection of EEs here, and I cannot find what I want in the
on-line Mouser Electronics catalog. Perhaps one of you will be gracious
enough to pass me a pointer to a source.

   I'm looking for a continously-on (not pulsed) infra-red LED, similar to the
type used in remote controls. The use is for testing photographic light
meters' IR sensitivity. With a TV remote control pulsing on and off, the
meter reading stutters between zero and the maximum reading.

On the client, I chose cups-client and I think everything sort of Just
Worked(tm) from there.  You can alternatively (I think) install a lpd
server to accept traditional BSD jobs at the server.

I ended up with a strange soup of hpijs and hplips packages on the
server in order to get pretty output.

What is a good way to send emails with file attachments from a shell
script?  I would need to be able to set the recipient, subject, and
attach various file types, such as .zip or .doc files.
Thanks,

You got questions....

"High output infrared LED", available at most area stores.
Note the forward voltage of 1.28V.  Prolly run forever on an AA
battery, though if you need very consistent intensity, use 2 AAs and
have one'a your EEs whip up a current-mirror to drive it.

I've used 'mailx' in the past to send files via command line. This
site seems to have a pretty decent tutorial:

They could, if you used them.  Better yet, you could get work done by 
working in one.  After all, feeding people is one of the most useful

Subject: [PLUG] Debian 3.1 upgrade experience
Message-ID: <86wtp4shov.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


Everything went smoothly, with two exceptions.  Two somewhat hacky
things I had set up:

  a) my lpd printing broke, but honestly it was kind of dodgy before
     anyway, so I can't lay all the blame on Debian (I am switching to
     CUPS, I think); and

  b) my stunnel setup for pop3s broke.  I am not sure why.  My remote
     clients (Mozilla Mail) silently just stopped connecting.  I
     switched to stunnel4 and am now getting:

       SSL alert (write): fatal: handshake failure
       SSL_connect: 1408F10B: error:1408F10B:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_RECORD:wrong version number

     Anyone seen this before, know what is wrong and how to fix?

Otherwise, the upgrade-in-place went extremely smoothly, as I've come
to expect from Debian.

I should have mentioned, that's the one site I found, but it's anything
but convenient.  I have to type in my full street address every time to
get the list, and the form uses POST, so there's no linkable URI.  I
couldn't even "show only this frame", as that generated a site error. 
(Friggin' .NET developers!)

You wouldn't know of an alternate, single click link, would you?  I was
thinking someone posted one here last year.

I don't know what happened to stunnel3, but I fixed stunnel4 by
switching from the default client mode to server mode.  Duh.

Many *Windows* drivers, yes.  But look at the success we've had getting
manufacturers to write drivers for Linux (which IIRC has a larger
installed base than MacOS.)  And even MS had to start out writing
virtually all the drivers for Windows.

Pretty dang close, especially if you use a version that's been

Which is virtually all of them.  It's easier for OEMs to put Windows
on every unit than on 99% of them.  For high-volume OEMs, the price
difference is negligible.

Russell,

   Years ago, I had a fellow from Gresham -- Dennis someone -- who did an
excellent job at very reasonable prices. When I return home I'll see if I can
dig out his full name and phone number.

Try entering "infrared emitter" in the Mouser search.  That returns over
100 hits.  They have many IR LEDs.  Something in there ought to meet
your needs.  If not, let me know.  Is there some special requirement
for your application?

They do, but they all seem to link back to http://www.leg.state.or.us/
for legislators' information.

However, the VoteSmart site is, as we say, close enough for government
work:

http://www.vote-smart.org/official_congress_state.php?criteria=OR&go33.x=8&go33.y=6

I'm not sure about those freaky "go33.x/y" parameters, but I have only

I hope someone comes up with a better answer than
mine. Anyhow, the device name is usually /dev/sda1 or
/dev/sdb1 for usb devices, if it's the first one. A
mount command, which ordinarily requires root
permission, would be something like this:

mount -t ext3 /dev/sda1 /mnt/zip

If your filesystem is ext3; otherwise it's different.
Also you may need to create the mount point. It
doesn't have to be /mnt/zip, so long as you don't try
to mount it on a filesystem that's already occupied.

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu 64-bit DVD
Message-ID: <42A81B02.32178.320556EE@localhost>

My new Compaq R3240 (Athlon 64, NVidia chip) arrived on Monday 
and I have been playing with it, trying one distro after another to 
see which ones did the best at finding and configuring hardware. I 
started with the live CD I had of Ubuntu and was highly pleased. 
The screen came up at 1680 x 1050! Stunning! If anyone recalls, 
dfficulties with the ATI video in the R4000 were the reason I 
returned it to HP.

However, I wanted to use the live CD to transfer the Windows XP 
Home files to my external USB drive for "just in case," and then 
just format the whole hard drive for Linux. And Ubuntu live couldn't 
see the hard drive. I also tried the Knoppix live CD. It came up in 
only VESA 1024 x 768, but it could see the hard drive. 
Unfortunately, it wouldn't copy the files to the USB drive. All I got 
was error messages. So eventually I just booted Windows, 
installed BackupMYPC, and made a backup to the USB drive.

Then I installed Linux on the whole hard drive. I started with Fedora 
Core 3 from the DVD that came in the "unleashed" book I got at 
Powell's. But too many problems, so I tried Mandriva 2005 LE, from 
the DVD that I downloaded from MandrivaClub. Again, too many 
problems. I left Suse for the last. It did pretty good, but still only 
VESA 1024 x 768. I lusted for that beautiful Ubuntu video!

I had the Ubuntu CDs that were handed out at the last meeting. I 
used the install CD and it went all the way through. But when I 
rebooted I got a kernel panic -- something about APIC that I didn't 
understand. But I had a hunch it might be because that CD is the 
32-bit version. So I downloaded the 64-bit CD from Ubuntu. 
Success!! And the most gorgeous screen I've ever seen on a 
laptop! I'm serious. Text is so sharp and crisp it looks like a laser 
printout. The letters are only about an eighth of an inch high, but I 
can read them clearly from five feet distance. This thing rocks! 

Not only that, Ubuntu did better than Suse at other things. Suse 
found my network and cable modem, but could never see my 
Windows 2000 computer. With Ubuntu I clicked on the network, it 
popped up with "Windows Network." I clicked on that, and it then 
found "Workgroup" (which is what I called it on the Windows 2000 
computer). And when I clicked on Workgroup, there was the D:\ 
drive on my Windows 2000 computer, that I had previously created 
a share for. I clicked on the D:\ drive, it asked for my password, I 
entered it, and there were all my files!

So now I'm in love with Ubuntu. But I want the whole thing, not just 
the cut-down stuff that is on the CD. So now I am downloading the 
64-bit DVD. Unfortunately, the only way to do so is with BitTorrent. 
It's been almost two full days and still has 16.5 hours to go. Ubuntu 
will send you free CDs, but not the DVDs. :(

But once I have it, I'd be happy to burn a DVD for anyone who 
wants one. Note that this is the 64-bit DVD, and the install one, not 
the live one.

OK, now I'm off to cafepress.com to order an Ubuntu t-shirt. :)

As I recall, Ubuntu had a nifty way of setting up the sources so you 
could network install anything you wanted.

Saves burning a DVD, and then later installing an outdated version of 
something with security problems.

But that's just me.

The first thing you need to do is check the terms of service of your
bandwidth provider. I have Comcast, and IIRC, you can't even host a
non-commercial site without buying a business service with Comcast.

That restriction is most likely in writing only. Many people host a site
anyway and don't ever hear from their ISP. YMMV.

I don't have experience with them, but I am very pleased with the
service at http://freedns.afraid.org/ 

I host 6 domains there, two of which are active. The service covers any
number of domains, is very easy to use, and supports easy dynamic
updates for those uncomfortable times when your IP address changes. You
can have almost any type of DNS record, including TXT records for SPF.
And there is no advertising, anywhere. I bought a premium account
($30/year for the lowest level) to support the operation and to get
wildcard entries, but if your needs are modest there's no reason you
would need to use anything but the free service.

I highly recommend it.

The live CD has no documentation, so I didn't know that was a 
possibility. I am a total newbie at Linux and have close to zero 
knowledge of command line options or the syntax to implement 
them. Even if there is documentation, I probably wouldn't know how 
to access it, or how to understand what it says, even if I do find it. 
Booting XP and doing a backup with BackupMyPC solved the 
problem, and a lot faster.

Having said that, given my experience with the R4000 and Suse on 
the R3240, if I had entered that command line, it would most likely 
have given me a black screen or booted to a text mode without X. 
Right now I have to get ready for exams tomorrow, so I am 
disinclined to experiment further. And the full DVD of 64-but Ubuntu 
will be finished downloading by tomorrow morning. So to heck with 
Knoppix. I'll just go with Ubuntu tomorrow afternoon. I don't much 
care for Knoppix anyway.

If I recall correctly, it said "unable to copy files." It wasn't worth the 
effort to try to figure out why. Many times I want to discover why as 
a learning experience. But other times I just need to get on with my 
life. This was a "get on with my life" situation. :)

Me too, but the other day I was helping a student submit an assignment
as an attachment like that and their editor popped up.  It was because
they didn't have $MAIL set up right or something, so mutt asked them
if they wanted to create it.  After we said no and closed the editor,
it sent the e-mail just fine.  Doing that would be a cool trick for a

Okay, but they're still freaky.  Who names variables as "go33.x"?

I asked my local provider, IPNS.COM & they said that it was OK to host at home.

Subject: [PLUG] Digital photo management software
Message-ID: <1118384330.3145.46.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi all,

I have a collection of almost 800 photographs taken with my digital
camera, and I'm always taking more. Each image is around 1 MB, but my
new camera produces JPG's betweeen 2 and 4 MB.

I am looking for a robust, reliable, and easy to use application that
allows me to do these things:

      * Browse by category or group, not by file location on disk.
      * Browse by thumbnail, not filename.
      * Assign an image to more than one category.
      * Create and manage a hierarchy of categories.
      * View a set of images (sequentially) at large size, full screen,
        and/or 1:1 scaling.
      * Add comments or descriptions to images.

It would be nice if it supports:

      * EXIF and/or IPTC data.
      * Canon RAW format (.cr2, which "file" identifies as TIFF but
        isn't really) in files around 8 MB.
      * Export capability for the metadata, or at least a
        well-documented database format so I can write my own export
        utilities.

I expect it would be a local X11 application, but I'm not opposed to a
web app if it's smooth and quick. I only post a small subset of my
photos online, and I already have a system for that.

I have tried searching for something like this, but I can't think of
what this software might be called. If you can't recommend a specific
application, can you think of what I can search for?

Thanks for your help,
Evan

P.S. Don't hesitate to mention apps that are close, but a bit rough
around the edges. This is for me, not my technophobic mother. :-)

Yup, I use them for slaves for five of my domains. I can't speak for any of 
their services, but their servers always accept zone transfers just fine, 
and always seem up and stable.

Note: if you ever use more than 5 domains with them, whether you've deleted 
one or not, they will bill you. The website isn't really clear about that IMHO.

I am becoming progressively annoyed by the different homedirs I have
on different boxes on my network and have been considering
consolidating my /home on an NFS mount.  This is obviously not new
territory for humankind, but I am wondering how you deal with mozilla
profiles, which don't like to be shared between application instances,
in cases where you might open a mozilla on more than one box at once.

Any insights?  Thanks!

I'd suggest reading "The Grumpy Editor's Guide to Image Management
Applications".  I don't know if any of the programs he mentions meet
your requirements, but I think it's a good place to start.

Thanks for the great link! The comments at the bottom are particularly
helpful. Kimdaba may be what I'm looking for, but I'm continually
bothered by the "DCOP" warnings (I don't run KDE). Not having DCOP is
stopping me from reading the documentation. What kdaemon do I kneed to
kstop these kwarnings?

Thanks,
Evan

Don't forget to make sure that you can tag images in groups, such as 
when importing a bunch of pictures to the same category off of the 
camera.

So far, it seems like too many of these programs want to store the files 
in their own special way.  The trouble is that if you can't do 
everything that every other program can do, what you really need is a 
way to easily use multiple programs in the same system.

That's why I mostly use gqview.  It has a nice hook system for running 
commands on multiple images.

Subject: [PLUG] case-sensitive cvs on Mac OS X
Message-ID: <42AA0335.8090200@madboa.com>

Here's an obscure one I figured I ought to post for Google's sake:

Macintoshes historically have had case-insensitive filesystems. That 
remains the default with OS X, but you can create case-sensitive 
filesystems, if you so choose. (The Mac mailing lists are full of funny 
posts asking why anyone would case about case sensitivity. Well, they're 
funny to me anyway. :-)

Our main file server at work is an Xserve; the system disk is formatted 
in normal Mac fashion, but the export volume is case-sensitive. So, if 
you login to that box, $HOME is case-sensitive, but /var/tmp is not.

Local requirements recently led me to compile and install a newer 
version of cvs than ships with 10.3.9. Lacking any firm direction in the 
matter, the cvs configure script automagically decides whether or not to 
build a case-sensitive binary based on the build-time filesystem. I 
built cvs in /var/tmp, so the binary was case-insensitive, but the 
repository is on the exported, case-sensitive filesystem. Oy!

The bottom line: When building cvs on OS X systems, make sure you know 
which sort of filesystem will be holding your repositories. Either build 
it on the target filesystem or make sure you know whether to pass the 
--enable-case-sensitivity (or --disable-case-sensitivity) option to the 
configure script.

That restriction is most likely in writing only. Many people host a site
anyway and don't ever hear from their ISP. YMMV.

And, in fact, since Oregon is state # 33 (Mr Trivia here), that "33"

Sorry but I'm confused by your reply. What I mean is that I get a dynamic IP
from Charter. I don't know what the lease is but it's long. I turn off my
modem at least once a day. I often get the same dynamic IP back. But not
always.

If I want them to assign a static IP address to me, I do think I must get a
business license from them. I'm assuming that if you want to host a web site
you need static IP address.

I'm not hosting a site and don't plan to but interested in the discussion.

I don't know. I'm not hosting but friends (non-Linux BTW) that do always
arrange to get a static IP. Are there performance or reliability issues with
DDNS? I'll ask around -- it could be a case of "this is what I've always
done so I'll do it again."

If I were running a commercial site, I'd want a static IP.  But if I
were running a commercial site, I'd use a colo service or rent a server
somewhere.  I think Mr. Leake's site is less mission critical, so he can
most likely get away with just using his given IP.  Most people do not
turn off their modems very often, so the IP is very unlikely to change.

This isn't true.  You can use a free service like zoneedit or dyndns
to bind a dynamic IP address to a domain name that you own.  Use
something like ez-ipupdate to update the binding every time you're
assigned a new IP address.

I've been doing this for years, and hosting low-volume websites
(though not on port 80, which might be why nobody's complained).  I
think that as long as you're a paying customer and your bandwidth
usage is below the point at which your broadband provider wants to be
rid of you they'll leave you alone.  I can't see a good business
reason for them not to.  Just don't wind up on slashdot.

The DNS-binding process triggered by ez-ipupdate is pretty quick.  On
one machine I have a script, run every five minutes, that compares the
current IP address assigned to my DSL modem with the address dig finds
for my domain name.  When they're different it calls ez-ipupdate.
>From the logs it seems that it never runs twice in a row: dig starts
returning the new address before five minutes have passed.

In all, I see no reason to pay extra for a static IP address.

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu Dumb Newbie Questions
Message-ID: <42A9C7AA.14432.388FC847@localhost>

OK, making progress here, but strange things lead me to some 
questions.

I installed Ubuntu 64-bit from the DVD ISO that I downloaded and 
burned. This is the bazillionth time I have installed Linux,but hey! 
It's all a learning process, right? So normally an installation utility 
asks for a root password and then asks if I want to set up a user 
and the user's password. Ubuntu asked for the user, but I swear I 
never saw anything where I was supposed to set up a password for 
root.

Earlier today I tried to switch to KDE and be root. I entered "root" 
as username and the password I use for root, but it wouldn't take it. 
Retyped several times, but no go.

So just now, in an attempt to figure out how to get my printer 
working, I gave up on the non-existent help on my computer and 
decided to look on the net. I got Firefox up and decided to do some 
configuring first, like I wanted to tell it to use tabs. I clicked on Edit 
> Preferences and got an error message that says (in part) 
"root.disabled = "true".

Is it possible I have installed Linux without creating a root account? 
If so, is there a fix outside of trashing it and reinstalling?

HI

It is a long story.

Ubuntu believes in SUDO..

And there is no activated root..

To make root do this

SUDO passwd root
yada  yada

So you enter you sudo passwd <your password you are sudo>
Then enter and reenter the new root password.


Now you can use


su


Good luck

There will be a period of time when your site will be inaccessible
because the DNS still points to the old IP. If your DNS provider allows
a very short TTL (and all other DNS servers respect it) and you have a
good way to detect a change of IP address, this delay can be less than 5
minutes.

Static IP's are much easier to deal with. No fussing, no worrying.

Aaaah!!

A thousand thanks!

You'd think Ubuntu could provide a little documentation somewhere 
about this. (I've been struggling to find documentation all day long 
here.)  :(

But on a happier note, Ubuntu 64 is running keen on my new 
Athlon 64 Compaq. I even got it to print to the Laserjet on my home 
ethernet.

Next task: Get the Broadcom wireless working.

Yeah, Ubuntu's documentation is a little strange to navigate around. 
However, this page might clear up their philosophy a bit:

ndiswrapper works well on my laptop with the Windows driver from HP. 
However, when I ran FC3 amd64 I had trouble with the 64-bit driver 
ndiswrapper recommended (random kernel panics and unstable networking), 
so that was part of what sent me back to 32-bit Fedora.  YMMV.

	Thanks for the info.  The registration place (aqdomains.com)
recommended some tools to use to do handle the dynamic IP issue.  I am
glad you are successful with ez-ipupdate it is in the ubuntu
repositories.  Are you using the zoneedit or dyndns service?  I need to
check again with aqdomains and see what they say.

Thanks Sandy - this will certainly come in handy.

I picked up Oreilly's Apache Cookbook which should be helpful, and
combined with my small library of Hunt's TCP/IP and Schroder's Linux
Cookbook (both have excellent info on Apache) I should have quite a bit
of knowledge at my fingertips now.

    I use dns2go, which is a pay service. Always been happy with them
and it updates my IP once a minute, just in case I have to reboot my
modem (not often). They started out as a freebie and I just stuck with
them when it went "commercial". No limit on bandwidth that I can tell
from the website and it works great with Linux.

zoneedit.  I think they let you manage up to five domains for free.

That's what I'm doing.  Works a charm.  It certainly more work than
using a static IP address, but it saves $15/month and that works out
to a pretty good hourly rate spread over years. :-)

Anyone know of a nice low power MB with at least on built in

Cost is a bit of a factor, especially since I want to build two,
one for redundancy. Speed is not much of an issue, all the cpu/

I'd love to find something thats like a 1RU or similiar size.

Or other ideas ?

RIP, AMD.

And I think it's a K6-2 or K6-3, the K5 didn't scale that high.

Are you describing a mini?  I think you are.  :-)

What kind of cost are you looking at?  Cheapest you can get?

See if you can find an epia if you want the ultimate low

Linksys WRT54Gs are cheap (cost around $60, although I saw them on  
sale recently for $45), small, low power and run Linux.  The source  
code for the WRT54G is available and there are several custom distros  
for them.  They make decent firewall/vpn/dns/ids/wap/managed switch.   
The main drawback is there's no disk so they are essentially useless  
as mail/web servers.

HI Mike,

I've learned to prefer printers that are networked with Ethernet.
Makes it much easier to let my wife's MAC work the printer as well as my 
Fedora and Red hat boxes as well as the winMe box I've had up playing with.

I like my Laserjet 4, which you can find used for under $300.00 in town.
But in any event, I'd say go with Ethernet networked printing.

Harry

I know nothing of Linux yet, but I had a Laserjet 4 for years. 
Indestructible printers. They use the cheapest toner, too. That's 
because they were made by Canon and HP just rebadged them, 
and then sold bazillions of them.

But instead of a 4 I'd get a 4M+. It's the same printer (same toner), 
but 12 ppm instead of 8, and has PostScript (genuine Adobe). And 
the 4+ can take a duplexer, which the 4 cannot.

And the cheapest place to get them (and toner) is eBay.

Mike,

   I've been using a HP LaserJet 5 for the past eight or so years. I like it.
HP printers -- expensive on the consumables side -- are solid and well
supported under linux.

WinME? You're the only one I've ever heard of that got that to work! I
had a perfectly good install of Windows 98SE running on my old Toshiba
Satellite. I "upgraded" to Windows ME. Within three weeks, I was so
frustrated I ended up dual-booting it with Windows 2000 Professional and
Red Hat 7.0! BTW, it's now very happily running "Sarge"

It's a very minimal box. It only does email.  and stores some junk I use 
at work.
It will eventually be my SUSE box, when I get around to buying the 9.2 
or 3 version and installing it.
Laziness has slowly crept into my once over productive lifestyle.
This week I'm working on getting my Ham radio gear working a little 10 
meters.

I'll second the observations that HP printers are well supported under
Linux but HP printer toner/ink supplies are expensive.

Do you need just a black and white printer or do you need a full color
printer?  If the former, any later model LaserJet printer should work.

If you need a color printer, you might look at one of the HP all-in-one
printer/fax/copier/scanner models.  I believe a model currently widely
available is the HP OfficeJet 4215 -- I got one only a few months ago,
for about $160 including a set of full-size replacement ink cartridges.

Anticipated printing volume should also influence your decision.  If you
plan to do a lot of business printing, you definitely want the LaserJet,
since the all-in-one printers are better suited to low volume workloads.

Have you read the Howto?  (Though you can't go wrong with a HP laser, 
and I seem to recall Tektronix makes a decent color laser printer 
that works wonders with linux).

Check out  http://linuxprinting.org/. There are a lot of color and laserjet

which ones are best-supported, and has a lot of good information.

Even though it is often cursed to the heavens, CUPS is a very nice printing 
system. Much better than the old line-printer protocols. The CUPS web 
interface rather sux, but you can also use KDEPrint or Gnome-Print, which 
many folks prefer. Make sure you download both the foomatic and gimp-print 
driver packages, and ESP Ghostscript. Having those will prevent 99% of Linux 
printing problems. The Gimp-print drivers are usually the best.

I have been happy with my PSC2510 from HP. The only drawback is the ink
is expensive, and the kind where all the colors are in a single
cartridge. So, a lot gets wasted if you use one color a lot more than
the rest.

I've used several different HP Laserjet printers with Linux over the years. I 
still have a HP 4P that I've had for nearly 11 years and it still works great 
other than it prints 4 pages per minute. I also have a newer HP1300 that also 
works fine with Linux. Supports both PCL and Postscript and with modern Linux 
distros using CUPS it's pretty easy to get a printer working with Linux.

I've for my old 4P on a parallel port and my newer HP1300 is on the network 
using a little network print server box from Hawking Technology that allows 
me to share the printer on a network. I went barebones on the 1300 and got it 
in a non-network configuration and so it only has parallel port or USB 
available for a connection. My network print server channels the network data 
into a USB port for the printer. There are also parallel port versions of the 
printer server as well.

When looking for a printer you might want to checkout the Linux printer page

The old LP protocol works quite well though, and there have been some
glorious uses of it. Speaking of which, has the sound file playing via
lpd been made to work with CUPS?

I love the canon printers that use 4 of the 3e or 6e tanks. These are just 
ink tanks with no chips or printhead and are easily refillable with ink 
from Fry's at $5/oz. One can refill the 4 tanks in the S750 in about a 
minute without even removing them from the printer. Cost to refill a $10 
tank is about $2.

Laser: Samsung (even the cheap little ones are quite fast), HP, OKI
Inkjet: Epson, HP

Colour lasers are affordable these days, and far cheaper to run than
inkjets.  Also, they don't dry out.

Linuxprinting.org will tell you which models work.

Group,
 
According to the documentation on BASH, the shell variables are Global with
respect to functions.  To have a "local" in a function, it must be declared
as such.  This is consistent with KSH.  However, the following script does
not seem to demonstrate this
 
#!/bin/bash
# Script to test "global" variable 
#
 
set -x
 
JUNK="Initial Value"
 
function SomeFunction
{
  set -x
  JUNK="Set in function"
  echo $JUNK
}
 
Value="`SomeFunction`"
#Num=$((SomeFunction))
#let Num=SomeFunction
 
echo "Value=" $Value
echo "JUNK =" "$JUNK"
 


Did I mis-read to documentation, or is BASH busted?

What is $JUNK before you set it inside the function?  Bet it is equal to
"Initial Value".

Ken,

Have you even tried running the script?
If JUNK is global, setting it inside should be visible as well when
returning from the function.  The function run on the same shell level as
the original script.  If it were indeed a subshell, then the results are
consistent.
If this were not the case why then is the local declaration required as per
the documentation?

Try invoking the shell function without using graves and you should get the 
desired results. I've written quite a few complicated shell scripts and use 
functions to make my scripts easier to manage. It never occurred to me that 
it is possible to invoke a shell function from withing graves and I've only 
used graves to capture the output from other programs into my shell scripts.

The backticks are messing you up, they're running SomeFunction in an
entirely seperate process.  Try:

  SomeFunction
  Value=$?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0506141509090.22942@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

                      Linux distro daddy goes to Redmond
                                By Gavin Clarke
                  Published Tuesday 14th June 2005 14:26 GMT
                         <http://www.theregister.com/>

Microsoft has recruited the father of a popular Linux distribution, under a
continuing mission to further understand ? some would argue "extinguish" ?
the open source operating system. Daniel Robbins, founder and chief architect
of the Gentoo distribution, is moving to Redmond to help Microsoft
"understand open source and community?based projects" according to OSNews.

Robbins' recruitment comes as Microsoft makes increasingly friendly noises
towards Linux. According to reports, Red Hat chief executive and prez Matthew
Szulik has been courted by Microsoft and even joined chief software architect
Bill Gates for lunch at an exclusive New York eaterie earlier this year.

Linux fans will likely suspect the latest moves are another example of what
critics say is Microsoft's "embrace, extend, extinguish" strategy.

In this case, that could mean taking elements from Linux and open source that
help advance the Windows architecture and ecosystem of developers, rather
than doing something radical like build a version of Microsoft Office for,
say, Red Hat.

Robbins, who actually left Gentoo in 2004, certainly brings the benefit of
his experience in software management, which could support Microsoft's
Dynamic Systems Initiative (DSI) strategy for autonomic computing and
self?managing systems. Gentoo uses a software distribution system called
Portage that updates the distribution via a simple command and combined
"Portage tree" that is capable of creating and installing latest Gentoo
packages. Gentoo will also build customized packages to fit users'
specifications, optimized for hardware and requested features. Gentoo, which
describes itself as a "metadistribtion" for PCs, games and embedded systems,
runs on x86, AMD64, PowerPC, UltraSparc, Alpha and MIPS processors.

Interestingly, the recruitment of Robbins follows last year's release by
Microsoft of the WiX command line tools for installation of Windows from XML
packages to the community. WiX is now reportedly being used in MySQL 4.1 to
generate binaries for deployment of the open source database to Windows.
Microsoft also last year released its FlexWiki and Windows Template Library
(WTL) to SourceForge.?

Do I understand correctly that the Clinic will be this Saturday, June 
18?

If so I wil be there. And I have a small gift for the kind gentleman 
who spent hours helping me try to get Mandriva 64-bit to boot on 
my Compaq R4000. (Sorry, forgot the name.) It seems that I 
bought a 25-pack of DVD-Rs from Fry's and used about 10 of them 
with the R4000. But then I returned the R4000 to HP and got an 
R3240 instead. The R3240 can use only DVD+R, so the DVD-Rs 
are worthless to me. They're yours if you want them. If not, they're 
up for grabs.

I have made great strides with the R3240 and learning the basics of 
Linux. At this point wireless is still not working. It's doable -- lots of 
reports from other R3240 users that they got it working. 
Unfortunately, I have been unable to follow their instructions, 
mostly due to lack of knowledge of terminal commands. But I have 
all the files and stuff -- ndiswrapper, Windows drivers, etc.

Planning on seeing some of you there. One day I may actually 
know enough to be able to help another n00bie. :)

David,

Assuming Anthony doesn't read this list himself, please convey to 
him that I am impressed with his article. I am a writer with 
numerous published books, so I know whereof I speak when I say 
he did a great job.

Oh, and tell him not to sweat the pedants who carp about gaffes

While using the web client for e-mail today, I found a page that tells what 
Comcast wants me to do to report unwanted e-mail:

http://www.comcast.net/help/faq/index.jsp?faq=SecuritySpam17785

It describes how to forward unwanted e-mail "to missed-spam at comcast.net as 
RFC-822 MIME encoded attachments,"  by forwarding said unwanted e-mail as an 
attachment using Netscape or Outlook. I just checked, and K-Mail has the same 
option.

They won't deal with e-mail older than 3 days, and you have to send them one 
at a time, but I can deal with that. Perhaps others will benefit from my 
discovery.

That might have been me.  Unfortunately, I won't be there this
Saturday as I have a conflicting event.  And doubly unfortunately, I
don't have a DVD burner, so I can't make use of the blanks.  I
appreciate the offer, but am forced, for the foregoing reasons, to
decline.  Feel free to dispense them to the other fine helpers at the
clinic, assuming it takes place as usual.

Do they also have a procedure for sending you ham that you have missed 
due to overly-aggressive spam filters?  Hope they'll go back more than 
three days for you on that.

Filtered ham is directed to a folder on your section of their server. You have 
options for how to deal with it. I don't recall the exact setting I have, but 
if I don't go look at it within that time, it is deleted.

That's weird, they won't take more than one email attached per report?  
It would be trivial for them to set up procmail to split it...

   I'm trying to install wxPython (the GUI widget toolkit) and I keep failing.
It compiles, builds and installs (in /usr/local) just fine, but when I test
the installation by importing all, the module is not found.

   The author of wxGlade suggested a few things (he's also running Slackware
and has had no problems installing and using wxPython), but even making a
wxPython directory in /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages and putting wx.pth in
there made no difference.

   PyQt is OK for a local application, but I want to use wxPython for another
one. If someone here can provide some advice and guidance, I'd appreciate it.

TIA,

Rich

Message-ID: <20050615184455.GB5806@gate.kl-ic.com>


Greetings, Keith Lofstrom reporting live from the Design
Automation Conference in Anaheim CA.  These are the folks that
make software tools for chip design.  About 700 companies,
5000 exhibitor staff, 500K square feet.  Hundreds of companies
have Linux offerings.  There was one company showing off their
256-CPU + Hardware Acceleration "Optical Proximity Correction"
server (using FreeBSD).  IBM and Intel and AMD are showing off
their clusters - all Linux, of course .  A lot of the big CAD
tools require them.

One small company, run by a friend, has a personal IC layout tool.
The tool runs under Windoze right now, but he is strongly motivated
to port it to Linux.  It is mostly written in lemonade C, with
some chunks of acceleration code written directly in assembler.
The assembler code is simple data-structure in, data-structure out,
with no API calls.  He uses Trolltech QT for the GUI interface.

So, questions for the group:

1) What tools are available to help port the C and the assembler code?

2) Are there some good porting cookbooks out there?

This guy is ready to jump in.  How can we help make his experience
speedy and pleasurable?

Keith

Not sure about the assembler, but for C I tend to just throw gcc at it
and see where it chokes, fix, rinse, repeat.  Then check the output
to see if it generates the same thing as the original.  I'd be
inclined to ditch the assembler and recode that part in C.  Presumably
he understands what the assembler does.  Then profile and think about
whether the assembler still makes sense.

Do you mean C or C++? If he's using Qt for the GUI already, it's likely
C++ (and if he's using Qt for most things, probably already pretty close
to ported). I suppose the best route to take is to find anywhere in the
code that uses Win32 calls directly and port those calls to the Qt
equivalent.  Another relevant portion is the toolchain he's currently
using: writing a decent Makefile or autotooling the project may be ...
difficult.

The assembler is likely in Intel syntax while almost all of the assembly
tools for Linux expect AT&T syntax.  They are largely the same with
minor annoying differences (like operand ordering).

A quick google brought up this reference which seems to be pretty good:
http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/50/LinuxAssembly.html

There is also a tool to convert from Intel syntax to gas (GNU
Assembler/AT&T):
http://www.niksula.cs.hut.fi/~mtiihone/intel2gas/

However, his best alternative is going to be to use NASM, which works
under Windows and Linux (and a *lot* more platforms) and uses the Intel
syntax, I believe:
http://nasm.sourceforge.net/

Keith,

Having worked 6 years on C compilers, you question is almost "non-sensical".

C is an easier way to write assembly.  I wrote in assembly for the first 10
years of my career.  With a good C compiler and some careful coding, you
should be able to get close to the "efficiency" of writing in assembly.

As for good compilers, Intel markets compilers (C and C++) that do *very*
good code generation and are GCC compatible.  This means porting using GCC
and tightening the screws with the Intel compiler.

Remember 90% of the execution time is typically spent in 10% (or less) of
the code.  Using profiling tools you should be able to isolate the 10%.  The
efficiency of the other 90% is of no consequence.

- Bill

Okay, now the ONLY thing I use my windoze box for is to watch funny videos 
sent to me by friends that are in the wmv format.  I used to use gxine when I 
had Redhat.  I am using Debian testing I guess (Sarge), and have been a 
little anxious about trying to install and run Xine since I remember some 
instructions on Debian about using Alien or some such program to install 
programs that are not Debian packages.  So, can you offer me some options, 
other than to not look at the wmv?  They usually are really funny.  Or, let 
me know if I can install Xine by doing the standard native install dance.  
Guess I am afraid of trying it myself without some pre advice.

Add this to your /etc/apt/sources.list:

deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ unstable main

I don't remember the exact packages you need, but apt-cache should be
able to help you there.

Yeah, the way the sources.list syntax works includes a URL and then a 
distribution name (unstable, here) and a list of repository names (main).

You want gmplayer and w32codecs.

You'll get the best video player and the codecs for playing all those 
proprietary formats.

The codecs ain't all Free, though.  So you taint yourself.

Glad to see it's all workin' for you, Mike.

Thanks for posting that. Been trying to get MPlayer installed, but 
being a n00bie I couldn't find it. I'm using Ubuntu on my R3240, so I 
added that to etc/apt/sources.list and then opened Synaptic. I 
installed mplayer-amd64, mplayer-doc and mplayer-fonts. Synaptic 
said it needed to install some other stuff as well and I told it to go 
ahead.

Then I inserted a movie (I Robot) into the DVD drive. First Totem 
popped up (need to learn how to change default program) and 
announced that it couldn't play it due to an unspecified error. So 
then I launched MPlayer and browsed for the DVD. When I told it to 
open the DVD it started, then a scene flashed in the window and 
instantly went away. The scene had lettering over it which I think 
said something about "this DVD," but it flashed so fast I couldn't 
read all it said.

I suspect it was a copyright notice or something. I bought and paid 
for that movie at the store. Telling me I can't view it is like buying a 
book at the bookstore and then being told I'm not allowed to read it. 
This sux.

Is there any way around this?

I'm working with a program that is written in Java. The way I start it is to 
use the Konqueror file browser to locate the program's .jar file, right click 
on it, and then "open with" IBMJava2.1.4.2. Is there a way to create a 
desktop icon that will start a Java program?

I've always found ogle to be the most consistent application for playing
DVD's.

Have you tried running it with....
$ /path/to/your/java/binary /path/to/the/jar/file
...?

Maybe toss -jar in before the path to the .jar.

Play with it at the console then make a shortcut if you must.

LOL. Well, if it makes you feel any better maybe I'll make Geoff 
show me how to get ndiswrapper installed so I can get my wireless 
working. At the rate I'm going it still won't be functioning by 
Saturday. :(

BTW, Riverdale does have wireless there so we can test and be 
sure it works, right?

   There's LyX and jpilot, too. Not all of us are SysAdmins who view scrolling
logs on multiple virtual consoles all day long.

Sell, so far I have tried Totem (installed by default on my Ubuntu 
5.04 AMD-64), MPlayer, Ogle and VideoLan Client. None work.

Totem pops up when I insert a movie DVD, and then announces it 
can't play the DVD because of an "unspecified error."

MPlayer starts to play the DVD, a screen flashes up for about one 
second, and then the whole program disappears. Ogle and VLC do 
the same, except they don't even flash a screen up for a second. 
They just go away.

I'm pretty sure lbdvdread3 is installed. Also the other one, *css or 
something.

I can browse the files on the DVD, so reading the media is not the 
problem. All I can think of is that it's some security issue.

Necessary?  Naw.  But on my workstation (errr... laptop)... I like
pretty email like Thunderbird and I just about need graphical IM clients
as I may have quite a few conversations I need to keep open.  Text
clients just don't cut it for me there.

Everything else works great in a terminal.  :-)

The only way I knew to run the application was to right click on it and "open 
with"... so, no, I haven't run it from a terminal window. Your instructions 
would have been perfect, if I knew where my java binary was. I took a guess 
that ps ax would tell me and found that it did. I started the program the way 
I've done it in the past and then ran ps ax. It returned, among other things:

/usr/lib/SunJava2-1.4/jre/bin/java 
-jar /home/rsteff/ArtOfIllusion/ArtOfIllusion2.0/ArtOfIllusion.jar

So, with that in hand, I right clicked on the desktop, clicked on Create New, 
File, Link to Application. Then I filled in Art of Illusion as the name, and 
the above string as the command. Works just as expected.

Thanks for the hint. It was what I needed to get me thinking about how I could 
figure out where the Java binary lives, and it told me what else I'd need to 
know.

For future reference many distributions come with "locate".  So the command

#locate java

Will return things with java in the name.

That's a lot of things with java in the name...

A little more selective...

#locate -r java$

does a regex search for things that end in java.

Much better.

If your system doesn't have locate (or rather slocate) then a find, 
piped to a grep will work. I use this on non-gnu systems...

#find / | grep java$

Just thought I'd pass that on, and maybe anticipate a question...

Dick,

   Two other useful tools: "which" and "locate."

   The former is used primarily with system executables and others; shows where they
are located. For example,

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ which java
/usr/lib/java/bin/java

   The latter is a synonym for "slocate" (secure locate) and, ultimately,
'whereis'. Each night the whereis database is updated with the location of
every file on your system. You can use it to find data files, images, or any
other type of file. For example,

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ locate .jar
/opt/opera-8.0-20050415.5-shared-qt.i386-en/java/opera.jar
/opt/OpenOffice.org1.1.4/help/en/swriter.jar

Have you run mplayer from a terminal window to see if it spits out any
useful information as it fails?

Note that in mainstream Debian, libdvdcss is not installed by any
official package. You have to run a script installed by the
libdvdread3 package, which in turn will go fetch libdvdcss from some
remote site. Read all about it:

   /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/README.Debian

Looks like Ubuntu takes the same approach:

   https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats

Reference section 8, "DVD-Video".

"which" should have been the obvious solution here.  Sometimes the java
./bin/ directory doesn't get into the path as it should.  If "which
java" doesn't give you just what's needed, then you should find and add
that bin/ to your path.  It will probably avoid headaches later, when,
for example, you decide to try limewire.

No. 

I know zero about programming and not very much about Linux. I 
doubt I would understand a word of what it spits out anyway.

OK, but it was listed in Synaptic, so that's how I installed it. 
Synaptic lists it as "installed." Ditto for libdvdread3.

But just in case it's not really installed, I went to 
/usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/ and found install-css.sh. 
Then I tried to run it. I tried "run install-css.sh" but it didn't seem to 
work. I tried double-clicking on it, but that just opened it in gedit. 
Then I tried looking for help on "script" to figure out how you're 
supposed to run a script. And then I noticed that somehow I had 
goobered up the install-css.sh file, as it is now a zero-byte file. So 
now I have to figure out how to get it back. The DVD I installed 
Ubuntu from just has an ISO on it. Must be someplace on the net I 
can download just the one file from. Off to google for it. :(

But I did succeed with the other issue mentioned in Section 8 -- I 
changed the region setting on my DVD drive to 2 (Europe). 
Previously it had no setting at all. However, the video players still 
disappear as soon as they start to play a DVD -- except Totem, 
which now locks up. Except it may not be locked up. The DVD 
drive is running full bore and the CPU has gone to 2 GHz. Maybe 
it's reading the DVD and doing something with the files on it? 

I'll keep poking at this stuff. Sooner or later I'll stumble on the right 
button. Thanks for the suggestions. :)

OK, no idea.  Never used Totem.  Don't know anything about it.

MPlayer doesn't do any DVD menu navigation, so what you're getting is the 
first track on the first title of the DVD, which is likely just the "FBI 
Warning" garbage.  It's far less than a second long and your machine is 
told to loop it some number of times when you're playing a video.

Try running MPlayer from the command line and throwing in a few different 
combinations
mplayer dvd://1
mplayer dvd://2

Just see what happens.

OK, so what exactly are you doing with ogle?  For me, I run ogle and it 
gives me the little floating toolbar and I choose "open disc" from the 
menu.  As soon as that happens, I get the DVD menu (sometimes with an "FBI 
Warning" beforehand).  Are you choosing "Open disc" and getting some other 
behavior?  Can you describe it in any detail?

Well, Debian, being based in the USA, doesn't distribute all of the decss 
code with their system, but it's available from other sources if you are 
one of those people who can run it legally.  You have to run some commands 
by hand in order to make it work properly.  A list of those commands (in a 
format that you or your machine can understand) is part of the libdvdread3 
package and is here:

/usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh

So, you know, if you are able to run that thing, you can make sure you 
have up-to-date dvdcss libraries.

Cartel security, yes.  The discs are designed to work only with players 
that are manufactured by licensees.  It's just a little scheme for picking 
up money on both ends of the transaction and keeping competition at a 
minimum.  It's all a very natural part of industrial capitalism.  Hell, 
it's practically the reason we have government.

Subject: [PLUG] Killed Ubuntu X
Message-ID: <42B1FBA6.29466.589AD878@localhost>

OK, while reading in Ubunto pages I stumbled across this:

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=36980

So I though, "cool, I'll get 3D acceleration going."

Hah!

I got to the third line in the instructions. This brought up a non-GUI 
series of settings. I got almost all the way through (to the point 
where it asked what default color depth to set) and it dumped me 
back to the command line. I repeated it about a dozen times. No 
matter what I entered, I always got dumped back to the command 
line at the same point.

"Screw it," I thought. I'll just get out of this and leave well enough 
alone. But the second line closed down X. So I did startx, but it 
didn't come back. 

At that point I decided I'd just restart the computer. Well, X won't 
come up. 

So I put the Ubuntu AMD-64 DVD in the drive and restarted. One 
option at bootup is to run it live. I did so, and it came up OK. Then I 
wandered around in the files trying to see if there was anything 
obvious. There was xorg.conf, and an xorg.conf.200506170447 file. 
The end of that file is the timestamp when I screwed things up. 
Evidently the reconfigure utility made a backup of xorg.conf. So I 
made a copy of xorg.conf as -bak and then did a copy of 
xorg.conf.200506170447 to xorg.conf. Then I rebooted.

X still won't come up.

There are no system backups because I haven't got that far in 
learning Linx. Anyway, I have no personal data on this computer, 
so there is nothing critical to back up yet.

Tomorrow I guess I get to start all over again from scratch. I'll have 
to reinstall and replace everything, all the apps I've installed and 
custom settings I made. Oh well. At least it will be faster this time 
now that I know where all the buttons are.

A dude ain't properly growed up unless he breaks an arm or a leg 
along the way. :(

Well, I guess wmv is just pipe dream on powerpc linux. Ubuntu 5.04 installs nicely on my powerbook, but no win32 codecs seem to be available probably because they are i386 binaries, and I can't get mplayer to install from deb or deb source in a functioning form. Any tips or success stories out there? 

Thanks,

Sean Harbour

I'm guessing that's xf86config

That's because dpkg-reconfigure is just calling a set of commands 
associated with the xserver-xorg package (I guess.  Though I don't 
offhand know how to find out what those commands are.)

So.  No matter how many times your run xf86config, it won't dump you 
back into X.

Go back through and give it all of the options that you gave it the 
first time.  Then do 'startx' (or maybe '/etc/init.d/xdm start' if you 
usually start from a display manager.)

Hint:  startx will show (EE) on your screen when there's something wrong 
with your config file.  Check /var/log/X<mumble> for the full story.

Have you added Guido Guenther's apt repository to your sources file?

  deb http://honk.physik.uni-konstanz.de/~agx/linux-ppc/debian/ unstable/

His repository has all sorts of mostly A/V-related good stuff
(including mplayer).

   $ dpkg -l | grep mplayer
   ii  mplayer-doc    1.0-pre7-0.0   Documentation for mplayer
   ii  mplayer-fonts  3.5-2          Fonts for mplayer
   ii  mplayer-g4     1.0-pre7-0.0   The Ultimate Movie Player For Linux

NB: I'm just assuming that Debian packages will play nicely with an
Ubuntu install, but have no experience to back that notion up.

I've had mixed success getting WMV files to play. Older versions run
just fine, while later versions don't play at all. Seems like a lot of
it is codec-related. FWIW, I've had much better luck watching
Windows-land videos with Xine (at least on PowerPC).

Jim,

   Call Northwest Battery Supply on SE Belmont and 38th (I may be off a block,
but -- as Galen so tactfully corrected me the last time -- it is on Belmont).

   They're good people.

Subject: [lug] Open source opportunity

I have stumbled across an opportunity to move my employer
more in the direction of open source.  The need:

* compiler for Coldfire processors
* support for above

I know that GCC provides Coldfire compilation.  But Agilent
is unlikely to go this route without knowing they can get
support.  Any suggestions?

Support is likely to consist of expert advice.  It may include
creation of macros to extend support to instructions which are
too new for GCC.  Or in the extreme case, extending GCC.

What I am looking for is recommendations for who can provide
support.  Commercial support is acceptable.  Even active forums
that provide support may be adequate.  The customer is mostly
in Boise.

I've had *BSD guys give coherent, reasonable explanations why they 
dislike the Linux codebase -- although I think they typically base their 
judgements on stuff they saw back in 2.0 and 2.2 days. They can rightly 
point to some driver code that looks as if it were thrown together by 
amateur programmers during a late-night Jolt session.

The thing is, reasonable folks are usually able to articulate the 
trade-offs: a focus on broad driver support, rapid development, and 
world domination (Linux) vs. stability, audited code, and a much greater 
willingness to be a niche player (*BSD).

I don't think Theo's assessments are completely wrong, but they don't 
give anything resembling a clear picture of what's at stake in the 
choice between the operating systems.

No, linux is for people who are willing to sacrifice the convenience of
mainstream, point-and-click software interfaces for personal freedom
and, ultimately, freedom of innovation.  Yes, linux includes a great
deal of crappy software:  it is inclusive by nature.  But I think for
Raadt to rail against it like that may be a cheap way to try to induce
linux developers to shape up, or he's simply missing the point, or he's
just bitter.

He complains about a single comment in the kernel source, like "does
this belong here?", concluding that it shows the whole thing is a
ticking time bomb of instability.  This also implies that BSD's code is
absolutely immaculate.  Get real, man.  I'd rather my software's
imperfections were documented than swept under the rug.

The linux kernel beats windows, but much of what runs on it sucks
indeed, notwithstanding the fact that most of it was developed as a
public service.  I wish it weren't so, but nonetheless, I'll continue to
advocate linux, in a realistic fashion (to those who can handle it),
until Microsoft is finally cut down to size and open standards prevail.

I use FreeBSD (which I suppose is similar to OpenBSD)
once in a while, and it pretty much rocks. It doesn't
have as many applications as Linux, though.

  You should be able to run most Linux apps under BSD using the "Linux
Emulation" option.  I believe it requires a kernel compile to enable
the feature.  One of the lead *BSD guys even commented that
application should be targeted at the Linux API so they would run on
both systems.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0506171412180.29740@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I know that there are other LaTeX users here who need to make oral presentations
using computer generated "slides." LaTeX has had the prosper and seminar
classes available for a while, but there's one that is much better: beamer.

   The beamer class produces pdf output but allows the full typesetting power
of LaTeX to be used. It's really a nice tool; I just finished my first
presentation with it and it does produce impressive, OS-agnostic results.
I'll have a copy of the pdf on my web site after I create some graphics for
it and get those inserted.

   You can find the beamer.cls and beamer.sty on CTAN. It works _very_ well
with LyX.

OpenBSD is similar. It split off from the NetBSD project years ago.

One of the big things that sets the OpenBSD project in its own niche is
their focus on security. They did audits of the old BSD code that many of
the *BSD projects shared, and have made a real point of providing lots of
good security tools.

FreeBSD is probably a lot friendlier to the average end user. It's one of
my favorite Unixes, and works great for web serving. OpenBSD is great too
in its own way, it's the box of choice for making a Unix firewall with OSS
tools, IMO.

Theo is known for being "difficult," as Linus put it, but he is not the
first person to question whether it's just far too easy to get sloppy code
into the kernel, and what impact that has on stability. Working as a
smaller group of programmers has advantages and disadvantages. They
probably do produce better code than some of the Linux developers, but
you're not as likely to get a driver right away for a new device on the
*BSDs.

When it comes to stability, there are people who would prefer to spec out
a box that they know is supported by their favorite BSD and run that,
rather than let their choice of OS be driven by the availability of
drivers. There are also less apps available for openBSD, but most of the
major OSS packages are ported for it.

It sounds like she may have inadvertently drug that pane closed - can
she grab a little bit of grey/off white/something on the left hand side
of the window, just to the right of the window border and drag it to the
right?

I haven't looked at T-bird, yet, but since it shares a heritage with Netscape 
Communicator, there's the possibility that feature is the same. If you 
haven't already done so, look along the left edge of the window. Is there a 
"button" cleverly hidden in the border? In Netscape, it looks like a vertical 
line about 1/2" tall with arrowheads pointing towards the message pane when 
the list of folders is hidden, and towards the left edge of the window when 
they are displayed. It works just like the "button" that displays and hides 
the message pane in the line that separates the message pane from the list of 
messages. 

I don't find a menu entry to hide/display the folder list in Netscape, either.

Garl,

   Well, I'll be! So, all she did was close that window, eh? Thank you very

Glenn,

   This looks like an ideal candidate for tomorrow's clinic. Can you bring in
your system then? Not only will it be fixed and working, but you'll learn a
ton of stuff, too.

Tomorrow's clinic sounds good, but is iffy at best.  I've got a full plate here at home, and Lake Oswego is a tad far from Forest Grove.

How often do you hold the clinics?

I've never found anything useful that won't build on freebsd. You know 
there are over 12K things in the ports tree, right? Someone already 
mentioned the linux emulation (and no, you don't have to rebuild the 
kernel--just run 'kldload linux').

Subject: [PLUG] Booting Linux from CD...
Message-ID: <1118966489.42b212d920fd2@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

In the interest of keeping Windows XP happy, I installed it 
to the first partition on the hard drive and the partition 
was rather large.  I used a Linux system on the rest of the 
drive to back up the bits.  XP is FAT32 and I use a
Windows 98 boot disk to go via loadlin into Linux.
This avoids the problem on two other XP systems I've set 
up where the primary drive is F something, but it makes 
it a real hassle to get to Linux and it exposes XP's
filesystem.

What I want to do is make a bootable freedos cd with loadlin 
and the kernel on it instead.  I have found that a copy of 
dos from, http://www.freedos.org/, works well with loadlin.
This would be a good replacement for a 98 boot disk.
With this cd, the XP partition can be updated to NTFS
as it won't need to be accessible anymore to boot Linux.

Grub installed to a bootable cdrom might work also.  

I want to stay away from any Linux bootloader on the beginning 
of the drive to avoid a, giving it away that Linux or anything 
else is installed and b, problems associated with the use of 
dd to put the bits back.  I also want to avoid some Windows 
event removing this bootloader.  The only irregularity I'm not
avoiding because I don't want to use two hard disks is
giving Windows XP less than 100% of the drive.  I'm thinking a
small 50 meg fat partition hidden by XOSL at the start of the
drive might work, but I don't want to go that route for
cases where it shouldn't be widely known that another OS 
is installed.

I wonder if the guest program for my zip drive works in FreeDos?
I might be able to sys a zip disk under Freedos and somehow burn
an image to cd of that zip disk that will boot.

Why not just do what I've been doing for 10 years.

1> Install Windows as normal, with a 20 gig or so partition.
2> Install Linux in the 2nd and 3rd partition.
3> Put the Linux bootloader of choice (lilo or grub) in the boot sector 
of the root linux partition. Leave the Windows boot loader in the MBR 
where it wants to be.
4> Make the root linux partition active, if it isn't already.

Lilo or grub will boot the system, and if you choose Windows, the 
Windows boot loader takes over, and it doesn't know the difference.

Some questions are better left unasked.

As for the boot sector getting blown away by some event, that's why you
want a good rescue CD. Then you can boot off of it and re-install your
boot loader. Some distros provide rescue CDs (I know the Gentoo universal
install CD is live and works for this), and there are other good ones you
can download. Knoppix works great, and I like this rescue CD a lot:

I agree with it to a certain extent, but I don't agree with putting all of
the emphasis on the vendors. Not everyone who upgrades a Linux kernel does
it because their vendor has released a new version of their OS. Some
people do it on their own because there is a driver they need, a bug that
has been fixed, or some other new feature.

Theo's comments are pretty extreme, but I have heard some of those same
concerns expressed by people in the Linux community. It's just a very
different style of development when you have a small core group of people
who are writing your kernel code. There are tradeoffs on both sides. If I
was looking for a rock-solid Open Source OS for a web server, I might very
well go with one of the BSDs (probably FreeBSD, but maybe OpenBSD if
security was a major concern). If I was building a desktop box, I would be
more likely to go with Linux so I could get whatever goofy new driver I
wanted.

Rich,

   I don't think that was the emphasis of the article. I believe that the
revenue imperative can cause a distribution release cycle that is shorter
than technically required. Therein, apparently, lies the problems.

   We all upgrade kernels and key packages for security or feature reasons. I
suspect this holds true for the *BSDs as well as for linux.

   Anyway, I had not read the Forbes article nor followed the issue, but the
short article on The Register caught my eye and I thought I'd share it with
all of you.

Theo's not wrong, but he does miss the point.  Everyone's using Linux
because it works with most anything, it's easy to install and it's
widely available in a variety of forms.  Linux's loose and open
development model gives someone who wants to hack on it a serious
chance of payoff, i.e.  getting a patch accepted.

The licensing makes a difference, too.  Linux is GPL, so private
companies' improvements go into the public codebase and get built on,
while the BSD license allows companies to keep improvements private.

Combine that with the BSDs' professional* management, and you get much
slower growth than Linux.  Slow growth is good IMHO, but it doesn't
sell consluting and hardware, which is what HP and IBM want to do.


* XFree86 has suffered from "professional" management for quite a few
years.  Hence the XOrg fork.

....or just install linux to some partition (say hda6 or whatever),
put the bootloader on that partition instead of MBR (as mentioned
previously), and use a boot disk made during the linux install or with
mkbootdisk, if that's still around.  If you're considering external
boot media anyway, why not use something that's been tested for years?
 (or, if you really want to, just change the bios boot order when you
want linux....)

Hello!

I use Debian because it works. I am attempting to make money in 
a business and I chose Linux and Debian in particular because 
it has the tools that allow me to do this.

Yes I have a windows machine, I use it to present information to 
people in a one-on-one session and since they use Windows I 
show them in Windows - I am doing what works!

As I show people what I am doing they ask about Linux and I tell 
them what I am doing and how I do it. Here in Clatsop County 
there are not a lot of Linux users, but with a little help 
there will be more!
 I think the people who wrote the article mentioned do not get 
the point. In my humble opinion Windows is the toy, it will 
only do what I pay for it to do - the limits are to 
restrictive. It is to hard to use - no multiple windows - slows 
down when to many programs run with it, spends to much time 
fixing itself.

The disadvantage of Linux is that just about anybody can contribute
to the kernel and infrastructure.

The advantage of Linux is that just about anybody can contribute
to the kernel and infrastructure.

Whether the Linux style is advantageous or not depends on what you need
to get done.  As it is, there are a number of things that ought to be 
Linux kernel modules that aren't there yet (like hot-swap IDE in 2.6.X),
but I doubt they will ever get there under the narrow-focus "professional"
management of the BSD families.  Feature richness isn't BSD's goal. 
Although the Linux bashing by some BSD types is just arrogant bigotry,
they are correct that many tasks are better suited to BSD, like
single-function servers.  If the BSD folk would highlight the areas
they excel in, rather than just insult Linux developers, or petulantly
whine that BSD is "better for everything" in some ill-defined way, I
would be a lot more likely to pay attention to them. 

I used flavors of BSD from 1980 through 2000, and changed over to Linux
because I like the attitude of that community better.  I am glad that
there are people in both communities that value cooperation and
interoperability over status games, so I can easily migrate back
and forth as my needs change.

If you want stability and maximum security, go for BSD.  If you want
feature richness, go for Linux.  If you want diversity, be glad there
are both.  Let's not leave a portion of the open-source map uncovered.

First, don't let Theo speak for all BSD users/developers. He's an ass, and 
OpenBSD is no more secure than FreeBSD.

I really don't understand what you mean about single-function servers. IMHO 
the memory management and scheduling in FreeBSD is far superior to Linux's. 
Also, it's pretty common for linux users to install FreeBSD (with the same 
WM) and notice a signifigantly better desktop experience.

Now, the problem is this: people don't know jack shit about the OSes they 
never use, yet insist on talking about. Someone just posted something 
complaining that windows doesn't do multiple desktop windows. It does. It 
also does sym links and hard links (a commonly misused argument). The 
poster said he uses windows, but clearly doesn't try to do anything useful 
with it. A quick google search would have shown that it does in fact 
support multiple desktops. If this were a Linux feature, the same person 
would have searched for hours to find the answer. This is the difference.

The above poster just did the same thing with ide hotswap. Guess what? It 
works in FreeBSD. (see man atacontrol) On linux, hdparm just isn't quite 
there yet.

I'm really not trying to start a back-and-fourth about features, but it is 
increasingly common for people to use false arguments for/against their 
favorite OS, and it gets quite annoying :)

Sounds like the old Best is better vs. Worse is better arguments that have
been floating around the computer industry for at least a couple of
decades.

The dispute can be summarized as follows:
* Best is better -- you have a group of programmers who write perfect
code that gets relased within a reasonable time frame. The code is
elegant, matches the spec precisely & works with a minimum of flaws.
* Worse is better -- you have a group of programmers who write code
that does most of what you want, & is released fairly rapidly. The
code may be ugly, doesn't match the spec (if one exists), & often has
major problems -- however, using feedback from users (e.g., comments,
proferred code), the code improves.

(I've probably mangled these 2 positions; I'm writing all of this from
memory. Feel free to Google on these phrases & correct what I've written.)

Each POV has its strengths & weaknesses. "Best is better" is defended
because -- well, the code works like it's supposed to: it's solid,
it was written following best practices, & it was written by experts.
"Worse is better" is defended because of speed of deployment (amongst
other points), & the fact that with user input or feedback (analogies
here include the metaphor of the marketplace, & genetic algorthyms)
the code gradually improves in the parts where the users need it to
improve.

Also, the "Best is better" model requires a way to pay its programmers,
who for some reason need a paycheck & benefits; the "Worse is better"
model can be carried to a large degree by volunteers & part-time
amateurs who don't need a paycheck -- although IIRC they don't refuse
the offer of money. Unfortunately, volunteers can be a flakey lot, &
that is why there are a lot of dead projects on Freshmeat & other
repositories of free software: they died due to lack of interest, the
maintainer got bored/went into another line of work/died.

The argument over these 2 approaches will go on until the end of
sentient life because both produce useful software -- just in different
ways. In other words, it's a religious war: you either embrace one
dogma & label everyone who disagrees with you a heretic (or worse),
or be an agnostic, & use what works.

I haven't looked at FreeBSD (or any other BSD) memory management and
scheduler, but I have spent a fair amount of time with those in Linux.
"Superior" is of course a value judgement, and I will say that memory
management and scheduler design is a difficult task. Still, the way it's
done in Linux -- a combination of code, algorithms, heuristics, patches
to code, hard-coded parameters and tuneables -- is the worst of all
possible worlds as far as I'm concerned.

There's an awful lot of computer science theory and non-trivial
mathematics involved. I've been studying it for many years and I can't
claim to know it all. But it's absolutely inconceivable to me that a
"commercial enterprise OS product", the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3
kernel, has *any* hard-coded scheduler tuning parameters! Yet it does --
the source RPM is in the public domain and you can look for yourself.

So what you have in RHEL -- and probably any other Linux -- is a kernel
pre-tuned to the test cases, both real-world and synthetic benchmarks.
It is *not* tunable by the system adminstrator to the enterprise's
workload, unless that system administrator is willing to do a lot of
kernel recompiles, reboots and experiments on live machines.

The good news is that our neighbors at OSDL and IBM are working on this,
and, since Linux is an open source effort, it will get fixed and anyone
(including myself :) ) can get involved. Meanwhile, what's there is
"good enough for most purposes", I guess.

Yes, but in that circumstance you've only yourself to blame for
instability. You first bought the hardware, and second installed a patch
not approved by your distribution of choice.

If the developers release a new patch level release and the vendors place
it in their distribution in their "stable" release without checking it
for stability, then it is the vendor's fault. With a mere 6 month release
cycle, you think Fedora is going through very much testing? Do you think
each release provides a lot of new features? No and no.

No, if you're going for a rock-solid server, you use something setup for
that role. With their slower movement and tight cores both FreeBSD and
OpenBSD qualify. Yet, there is a Linux qualifier too, Debian. You most
certainly do not go for Fedora or one of the other bleeding edge
distributions.

Perhaps the problem is that super bleeding edge distributions like Fedora
are much better known. While few people mention Debian, RedHat Enterprise
or SuSE Enterprise. They might be less sexy, but those are no less
important than the former.

Elliott,

   What proves your point is Slackware ("the quiet distribution"). Now in its
eleventh year, Slackware is one of the old timers still in existence, and it
is far back from the bleeding edge. Patrick includes a 2.6.x kernel for those
who want it, but the 2.4.x is the default. I've had some issues with
applications after an upgrade, but not with the core utilities. It's been a
very pleasant change from my Red Hat days (which ended with 7.3). Heck, other
than security replacements, I do no distribution package upgrades from one
release to the next.

Rich (the Happy Camper)

Turns out locate, which I remember from other distributions, is not included 
in SuSE 9.1 Personal. It is easily installed with YaST, so I did that.

Yes indeed -- 456!

# locate -r java$
locate: invalid option --r

I tried find / | grep java$ too, but that also returned a long list. I've got 
a copy of FreeWRL on the machine (a vrml tool), and it has a lot of files 
with java in the name.

# which java
/usr/lib/java/jre/bin/java

Looks like I have more than one java installed, and the one to which which 
points is not the one that is offered by right clicking on a .jar file.

# echo $PATH
...:/usr/lib/java/jre/bin:...

which and locate are good things to know about, but they wouldn't have told me 
as much as ps ax did in this case. With ps ax, I not only saw which binary 
was running, but also the command line option to use to load the .jar file.

/usr/lib/SunJava2-1.4/jre/bin/java 
-jar /home/rsteff/ArtOfIllusion/ArtOfIllusion2.0/ArtOfIllusion.jar

On the other hand, which did show me that there's more than one java on my 
machine. I suppose I should try the one that which showed me some day and see 
if there are any differences that I can notice.

Thanks to all.

Though modern Slackware may also qualify (been too long for me to say
whether or not it meets the qualification), Debian stable easily
qualifies as well. Each of those things you mentioned is true of Debian
stable as well. It wasn't until the release last week that Debian stable
even had support for the 2.6 kernel.

Anyway, not time for a distro war here. The point is that the second
article was very true. Theo's was comparing *BSD to absolute bleeding
edge distributions, rather than the stable distributions that are a far
better comparison for the characteristics he was looking at.

Windows XP doesn't use FAT32 unless you choose that, loadlin won't
work with NTFS.  To make it look like Linux isn't installed, for 
good reason, I don't want grub or lilo installed.  I'm using Linux
as a backup solution, for security reasons I don't want it to be
obvious thast Linux is installed at all.

If someonw can point me to a good custom rescue cd howto, I'd
appreciate that.

Not to be pedantic, here, but you made a certain mistake four times in a
row, so you may not be aware of it:  the word "too", not "to", is used
to denote excessiveness.  Hence,

. . . That's just in case you care to improve your English (which makes
it more respectable and less cumbersome to read).  No offense.

Subject: [PLUG] IT'S WORKING!!!
Message-ID: <42B6FCFA.2246.6C280B09@localhost>

Thanks to Derek at the Clinic and a kind person on the Linux 
R3000 e-list that I subscribe to, my wireless is NOW WORKING!!

At the clinic we got close, but were still getting a stack of 
"ndiswrapper complains about" messages when we did a dmesg. 
At the conclusion of the Clinic we were under the impression that I 
might have to do some compiling. Yeah, me, someone who has 
been using Linux for a month and a half is going to compile 
something in Linux!

But after going back and forth on the R3000 e-list it turns out that 
what was wrong was that I was using the wrong Linux-image for the 
ndiswrapper that I had. Once I switched to the right Linux-image, 
the wireless came right up! I'm so excited.

Classes started today at Portland State so I had to go there 
anyway. I took the computer and (with a few minutes help from IT 
Dept) actually got into Pub-Net via wireless. I still have to figure out 
other stuff -- but I've never used wifi even on a Windows computer, 
so it will take me a while.

Exciting stuff!!

I never said it was the vendor's fault if I installed my own kernel. 
That's not the point. The question is why would the kernel be unstable 
in the first place, if I am not installing from the development branch.

to clear my calendar (and honey-do expectations) for another one of
those. Before then, I didn't have anything wireless, but I made
decisions based on what I read in this group's postings. I could use
some help getting the laptop to work in linux. And I have TONS to learn
about how to secure the network.

OK, at this point I have quite a bit of effort invested in configurations 
on my Ubuntu-64 Compaq. I feel it's time to start making backups.

The backup medium will be an external USB drive connected to my 
Windows 2000 computer. I created a share on the Windows 2000 
computer and the Linux laptop sees the drive just fine. (Except it 
asks for my password for the Windows computer each time I try to 
access it the first time during a session, which may be a stumbling 
block for unattended backups.)

I googled for "linux backup" and got all kinds of stuff. Almost all 
was commercial software and designed for massive installations. 
The rest seemed improper for one reason or another.

I could backup from my Windows 2000 computer, except I haven't 
been able to get the Windows 2000 computer to see the drive on 
the laptop. It sees the laptop, and when I click to browse it, 
Windows pops up a login box. Un fortunately, when I enter my 
username and password for the laptop, Windows keeps saying it is 
wrong. I've tried a few things, like putting //laptopname/ in front of 
my username, but nothing works. Anyway, it just seems more 
logical to back up each computer from that computer. I'll deal with 
the Windows network issue later.

So does anyone have any suggestions for simple backup solutions 
that would work in my situation, and without requiring a degree in 
CompSci to run it?

Why not hang the USB drive on the linux laptop directly, instead of
using the Windows 2000 machine as nothing more than a USB host?

Barring that, you probably just need some samba config tweaks to get
your Windows 2000 load to be capable of mounting the samba share.

I'm no samba expert (I don't own a Windows box and I have no reason to
ever access one in my daily life), but I do have samba configured
adequately to do what you want, so here's how I did it.  Here's my
smb.conf file:

[global]
     netbios name = jungle
     netbios aliases = jungle
     server string = Samba Server on jungle
     workgroup = WORKGROUP
     encrypt passwords = true
     map to guest = Bad User
     null passwords = Yes
     username map = /etc/samba/smbusers
     password level = 8
     username level = 5
     log level = 2
     max log size = 0
     announce as = NT Workstation
     socket options = TCP_NODELAY SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192
     os level = 99
     lm announce = No
     preferred master = No
     enhanced browsing = Yes
     dns proxy = No
     wins support = Yes
     valid users = nobody,root,ckonstan
     create mask = 0777
     directory mask = 0777
     guest ok = Yes
     hosts allow = 127.0.0.1 192.168.0. 192.168.2. 192.168.8.
     hosts deny = 0.0.0.0

[homes]
     comment = Home Directories
     valid users = %S
     read only = No
     create mask = 0755
     force create mode = 0755
     security mask = 0755
     directory mask = 0755
     directory security mask = 0755
     inherit permissions = Yes
     guest ok = No

[printers]
     comment = All Printers
     path = /var/spool/samba
     printable = Yes
     postscript = Yes
     browseable = No

[public]
     comment = Public share on jungle
     path = /var/samba/public
     read only = No
     create mask = 0777
     force create mode = 0777
     security mask = 0777
     directory mask = 0777
     directory security mask = 0777
     inherit permissions = Yes
     guest ok = Yes

In the [global] section, the important line is:
     encrypt passwords = true
And probably also:
     null passwords = Yes

It's been a really long time since I had to figure this stuff out, so
forgive me if I forget the details.  It seems to me that if you say
"encrypt passwords = true", you need one or both of the following files in
/etc/samba/:

     smbpasswd
     smbusers

You add and modify entries in smbpasswd with the "smbpasswd" command.
"smbpasswd -a <username> adds a new samba user.  smbusers is written by
hand.  Its format is "<username> = <alias1>[, <alias2>, <alias3>]".  One
entry per line works.

Since the password encryption is NT-style (again, I may be wrong, shoot me, but
Windows is happy with it), you can now mount those pesky shares (listed in
the [public] and [homes] sections of the example smb.conf file).  But
you are going to be prompted for a password, even if the password is
blank.  Not automation-friendly.

We have a samba server on our network at my place of work.  It is a
linux box, with samba set up very much like here (except it is also the
master browser).  The Windows clients have no trouble with it.  It was
my unhappy task for many months to administer this service.  If I had to
set up a network-based backup plan, I would steer well clear of samba.

Install cygwin on the Windows box, and use rsync from a cron job running
in cygwin.  As long as the Windows machine is acting as the client in an
rsync/ssh connection, it'll work fine.  rsync is a vastly superior choice
for backups, since it is all about creating a backup mirror image with
the least number of transfered bytes possible.  That samba-based backup
script will do a blanket re-copy of all files, which isn't efficient.

There is a free version that you can use in a single-server environment.

I have used Arkeia for several years in a variety of situations and am
quite impressed by its power and flexibility.  It may take a little time
to get your head around the software's functioning, but it is worth it.

There are some debates surrounding its authentication protocol, but in
the situation you describe it doesn't sound like an issue.

I had already gone there while googling earlier, but upon your 
recommendation I went back and looked more carefully.

I can find free trials, but cannot find anything completely free. And 
none of their products list a price. In order to get a price you have 
to e-mail them a form asking, among other matters, how many 
hundreds of machines you are serving and how many servers you 
have. 

Did I miss where the free simple backup utility is located?

Well, it has to hang on one or the other. The laptop is portable, so 
the logical place is the Windows machine. At least that way it can 
stay connected. Otherwise I'll be forever plugging it in and 
unplugging it. And to mount it on the Windows machine I have to 
get down on my hands and knees to get to the sole USB 2.0 port 
on the back of the computer. (It's Windows 2000, with an additional 
2.0 card, since Windows 2000 does not support 2.0 by itself.)

You just jogged my memory of something. Several years ago I 
experimented with Linux on my old computer. It was in the days of 
Corel Linux. And I remember something about plain text passwords 
vs Windows encrypted passwords. I had to do something on the 
Linux computer to get it to see the Windows passwords. Or maybe 
I had to do it on the Windows computer. Too long ago. But might 
this be the source of the problem? I mean, the Windows computer 
is happy to take my password as entered from the Linux computer. 
It's the Linux computer that refuses to recognize the username and 
password when sent from the Windows computer.

Just fire-up a shell and do this:

  tar -czvf mybackup.tar.gz /etc/

That's about as simple as it gets.  If you want it graphically, there's 
ark.

Now you have a backup, I suppose you would like to schedule it :-)  A 
lot of people do this with cron, but that oftens ends-up a bit ugly.

I've been working on (ok, haven't been working on) what I call the "bag 
of hammers backup" program.  I call it that because it's dumber than a 
bag of hammers to backup a linux system onto a windows share (not that 
it's dumb of you to do it, rather that it's the smartest thing you can 
do if you have to talk to something as stupid as a windows box.)  When 
you're talking to something smarter, you can use programs like dirvish, 
rbackup, etc.

In any case, the idea was that you could set it up even if you were 
dumber than a bag of hammers.  I'm still working on that user-friendly 
bit though.  It's essentially just a fancy scheduler/configurator for 
the above tar command (but does rolling backups, etc.)

The code is in my svn/, though it hasn't been finished to the point that 
I thought it deserved packaging.  In particular, there's some stuff 
that happens in the guts of Getopt::Helpful that I've been trying to 
work-out which bohbackup needs to work right.

I haven't found much else that really does the job in the situation 
where a linux box is among a windows network and not a server.  Kind of 
rare I guess except when you're a newbie or you're just getting a shop 
started on Linux.

There are three utilities generally used for this purpose. `rsync`, this
is used for simply duplicating the filesystem tree, often over a network,
but can also be used locally. `tar`, "tape archive", reasonably effective
as a backup tool. `dump/restore`, a pair of tools specifically designed
for backups, dump is filesystem specific and brutal in its approach, but
wonderful for its intended purpose, mainly backups.

Often the output archive from dump or tar is run through `gzip` or
`bzip2`. Both are compression programs, plain and simple. gzip is the
older, while bzip2 compresses better but is slower. Notably none of the
above tools do compression, that is a seperate step from archiving.

Putting it together, for dump:

dump -u#f - <FS> | gzip > archive-<FS>.#.gz

Where # would be the level of the dump (0 is full, 1-9 are layers of
incrementals). <FS> is the filesystem, each has to be done seperately,
so "/", "/usr", "/var", and "/home" each needs to be done depending on
your installation.

For restoring:

gunzip -c archive-<FS>.#.gz | restore -rf -

Starting with the level 0, and going through each incremental in turn.
After you've done all the levels, you delete the file "restoresymtab".


And now it is time for the holy war on tar versus dump to get going
again.  :-/

Are you concerned about the security of your backup machine?  Once
the backup machine is compromised, everything you back up on it
is compromised also.  You might think about a Linux-based backup
server instead - or at least a Windoze machine with no inbound 
services, one that is never used for browsing or email (to name
two common vulnerabilities).

If you go to a Linux server, consider dirvish (www.dirvish.org),
an open source project I am managing.  We have a small but active
community, about 60 on the mailing list.  dirvish has some problems
backing up windoze machines, but we do have users doing that.  Get
on the mailing list and ask how folks are doing...

The main advantage of dirvish is that it uses rsync, which is very
fast over the network, and uses Linux hardlinks on the target,
which means that it can overlay many daily images over the same
set of files.  I have 300 days worth of 100GB backups on one 250GB
disk;  these take about 1 hour per night to back up 6 systems over
the ethernet.

I am concerned very little with the security of the backups. 
Remember, I am not backing up an organization with thousands of 
users and gigabytes of sensitive data. I am just protecting my own 
stuff from a hard disk failure. No one would be remotely interested 
in hacking into my home network. There is nothing here to interest 
them. Unless they wanted my latest term paper, that is. :)

And, as for the Windows 2000 computer, it is behind a router and 
has a firewall (Sygate). Looking at Sygate's logs, in the past 
couple of years since installing Sygate, nothing has gotten past it. 
I am absolutely positive that there are people, even on this e-list, 
who would be capable of getting into my computer. But life is a 
series of risk calculations. This is one I am not concerned about.

The Windows computer does not have anything from Microsoft 
installed other than Windows 2000. Even then, Internet Explorer is 
blocked from the internet on the Sygate firewall. Outlook and Office 
are not installed. I uses Pegasus for mail, and I definitely know 
better than to click on an attachment. I have been using this 
Windows 2000 computer connected via Comcast cable for the past 
3.5 years. It has never had a virus, worm, or any other malware.

So basically, I am not concerned about security in keeping the 
backups on an eternal USB disk connected to the Windows 2000 
computer. I think I am in much greater risk of being run over by a 
bus on my way to the grocery store. :)

While I haven't actually priced them, I expect that USB extension cables are 
relatively cheap. Just permanently install one of them on the Win2000 box so 
you can more easily plug and unplug the USB drive.

My friend wanted her XP system set up again.  She has limited 
computer literacy and malicious friends.  That's why the Linux 
system I set up on the other side of her drive doesn't need to 
be obvious.  I know traditionally that Linux is booted from a
program installed to the first hard drive.  For the 
purpose of simplicity and security though, I didn't want to do 
this.  She wanted XP set up again, she didn't need some 
strange boot program to figure out.  It would have been nice to 
use a second drive to back her Windows system up on, but that 
option wasn't available to me.  I don't think Linux will boot 
via lilo or grub anyways because if I remember right, I 
installed it to an extended partition.  My thing was to get 
XP to install correctly.  Trying to put a small Linux boot 
partition at the start of the drive always screwed XP up.  
I might have been able to trick the Windows partition into 
starting 50 megs into the drive via use of Linux fdisk, but 
that's just a guess on my part.  What I really want to set
her up with is a freedos bootable cd or a freedos bootable 
flash drive to start her Linux system with.  She has a bios
password, so she can lock her boot down.  I want to give her
a non obvious yet simple enough boot method that will allow
her to upgade her XP system to the NTFS filesystem protecting
it even better.  Considering my backup method is bit based,
I don't care what the filesystem is on the Windows partition.
For those wondering why I don't go to dos mode in Windows
XP, it seems to use a protected mode memory manager that
loadlin doesn't work with.  I gave her a Windows 98 system
disk with a batch file to launch loadlin, but she lost that.
I want to hand her a single cd or flash key that she can boot 
Linux with.  I backed her Windows system up before I went
online to activate it.  I added a ton of open source 
utilities and tools which are in the backup.  For those
who don't like to sit and answer Windows XP installation
prompts, telling Linux to restore Windows and walking out
for a few hours is far more appealing.  That's why I did
that.  Turns out, Fedora Core 3 can use all of her 
hardware, but I didn't emphasize this much to avoid
overwhelming her.

Sorry to reply to my own message but it appears that Arkeia changed
their terms for the free version since I last visited their site.  It
used to be limited by number of servers (max 1 for the free version)
whereas now their free version is only good for up to 50 GB.  Too bad.

For free/simple, I would agree with the people that said using rsync is
a good way to go.  Another option I use is Unison:

<http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/>

I use it to keep my laptop and desktop in synch.  Unison expands upon
rsync by providing merge capabilities plus a GUI.

If you can mount the share locally, you don't need to run Unison on the
remote box.  If the remote share can not be mounted locally, Unison
supports other transport methods, but Unison must be available on the
remote machine.

All,

I'll be building a MythTV box soon and was wondering if anyone had
experience
with Myth and DirecTV. From what I've found so far, it appears that changing
channels is a hassel and dual tuners is going to be a problem. Any
experiences
or information would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: [PLUG] slackware an scsi error
Message-ID: <42B98AD2.30702@mideplan.go.cr>

Hello,

I'm trying to install slackware on my scsi hd. I had some problems with 
that so I disable parity (on the scsi administration tool that come with 
the disk) and everything seems to be ok.

Now I can see the disk from slackware installation (/dev/sda), the 
problem is that when I use cfdisk to make partitions it can't save the 
new partition scheme. No error messages, just when I run  cfdisk again 
it says Do you wish to start with a zero table?

any idea?

Thanks in advance and sorry about my english...

Regards,

El?dier.

Freedos and msclient-3.0 might work.  I've network booted dos. 
Linux can be network booted and run root over network.  With NTFS 
I don't know, you might be in trouble there.  If, on the other 
hand, you figure out how to do a bit backup of your NTFS 
filesystem via dd, you should be fine.  Since freedos is GNU 
gpl'ed, I don't see any reason why someone couldn't port dd 
to it to create a simple partition imaging solution.  Something 
like menuconfig that works as a front end to dd could be quite 
nice.  One of the reasons I don't like anything that uses NTFS 
is the problem of backing it up.  It wouldn't be so bad if 
Windows XP, etc., didn't use drive letters and could support a 
mode where a fat partition is not a valid program installation 
target.  If you could install Freedos to that fat partition and 
boot it with msclient, that could work quite nicely.  Filesystem 
vagueness is a large concern of mine with modern versions of 
Windows.  It's a good reason to ask anyone who says they use Windows 
for this or that, what would it take to get you comfortable enough 
to abandon Microsoft software altogether?  The Windows filesystem 
should be based on an open public standard, but as far as I know, 
that's not the case.  I'd recommend a cheap PII if you're going to
have a backup server, just run Linux on it and add a promise hard 
card that there's kernel support for.  What you do is network export
via NFS a basic Linux filesystem and via a trivial ftp server 
an NFS root kernel also.  After that, you either use a floppy disk 
with etherboot or a PXE enabled network card.  I think even Redhat
7.3 would work if you're going the dd route, but I'd recommend
Fedora Core 3 or possibly even Slackware.

A few questions:

1)  What slackware version are you using?
2)  What slackware kernel are you using?
3)  What SCSI controller are you using?
4)  How sure are you the disk isn't broken?

One way to get reliable access to your network Windows disk is to add
an entry to the /etc/fstab file and create a protected file named
/etc/smb.credentials to hold your windows username and password.

Add this entry to the /etc/fstab file:
   \\Win2k\usbDrive /usbDrive  smbfs 
credentials=/etc/smb.credentials,workgroup=HomeNet,user 0 0

Create /etc/smb.credentials as root with the following two lines and
chmod to 600:
   username = windowsLoginid
   password = windowsPassword

  chmod 600  /etc/smb.credentials
Then create the directoy on which to mount the usbDrive
  mkdir /usbDrive

Now you can mount the drive as follows and automatically at boot.
  mount /usbDrive


If you take the laptop off your home network add the ",noauto" option
to the /etc/fstab entry to avoid slow booting but you will need to
manually mount /usbDrive as root before use.

Subject: [PLUG] Samba authentication issues
Message-ID: <1119477784.20403.23.camel@rhws.theplatinumrule.com>

Once again, Samba is my best friend and nemesis.

I have a network where with SUSE9.2, Win95, Win98, WinXPPro.

The systems have all had issues logging in- some needed to open the
share with windows explorer before the shortcut would work, others
needed to click the file desired directly instead of letting Access open
it via desktop shortcut, issues like that.

I added a new XP user that could not under any circumstances open the
share. In attempting to fix the problem I changes samba so that only the
XP users could log in to the share.

I remember that I had problems with pam taking over authentication once
after an upgrade (different distro) could that be an issue here?

I'm including my smb.conf.

Thanks for helping...

If there is no error, then more than likely it is doing what you ask it
to.  Some systems have to reboot after changing partition information,
this is usually indicated by a failure to re-read the partition table.
I would also recommend booting a live-CD distribution (like Knoppix --
it has pretty good hardware detection) and use that to change the
partition tables.

Good luck,

Are you certain that your SCSI bus is properly cabled and terminated?  By
disabling parity you may be hiding a problem which will cause you grief
later.

You are right, by disabling parity I was just hiding my problem. 
Everything was about my cable. It was broken.

What seems to me strange is the fact that I can see my disk from linux.

Ok, now everything is working fine. Thanks a lot for you answer.

Gang,

I successfully have downloaded (all the sums checkout) FC4 and tried to load
it.  
I cannot even boot up into the load process.  The linux that runs the load
process gets an error saying it has a sync problem with VFS.  
This happens on the DVD, the first FC54 CD and the FC4 recovery disk.

I successfully loaded FC3 with no problems.  I was trying to upgrade to FC4.

Any thoughts or suggestions?  (Unfortuately I was not able to make it to the
clinic)

Hi Bill,
How did you create the disks?  Did you use cdrecord?  What options did you use? 
I downloaded FC4 i386 DVD on Windows and burned them using nero 6. The
DVD booted the first time I tried. I normally download on Linux but I
am too tight on space and have been waiting for FC4 to install a new
disk and rebuild my system.

James,

The downloads were done to an FC3 system.
I burned the DVD on a windows box using Roxio and the CDs (FC4 load and FC4
recovery) on the FC3 system using K3b.

The fact that I get the identical error from both the DVD and CDs would
indicate that my system and FC4 have issues.  I have recently downloaded
Knoppix 9 and can successfully boot that on the box.

  I had a problem loading FC3 on my old Dell 3500 laptop when FC3
first came out.  Fedora Core had removed the drivers for my video and
audio chip sets.  It kinda sucked...  It took them a couple of months
to get the drivers compiled back into the default kernel.

Ok guys.

 

I've got a nice new DELL XPS2 Laptop. 

It comes with the SATA drive.

 

Yet for some reason the Debian install can't see the hard drive.

Any ideas?

I've gotten both x86 and x86_64 versions of FC4 to boot and install fine 
off the CDs (haven't tried the DVD).  I had some trouble with the video 
on my laptop, but the install worked, and a yum update afterwards 
installed the errata xorg stuff which works.

It sounds like you have more than one pc, will one of the other
systems boot to your FC4 disk?

How far does it get? Does it boot? Does it get to detecting hardware and
simply doesn't find the drive?

I think you pegged the most likely issue. Mainly many SATA controllers
don't look like normal IDE controllers. The first thing I can think of to
do is tell it to boot the 2.6.8 kernel (more recent drivers) rather than
the 2.4.27 kernel (the conservative default).

Hey Elliott thanks for the reply...

I've tried both the 2.4 and the 2.6 kernels.

The install goes all the way through and when it tries to detect the drive
it says that there are none installed. :( 

I think that I agree with you that the SATA controllers don't look like IDE
controllers, yet I didn't see any detection for SATA drives going on during
boot-up. OR did I miss something during bootup? Is there a Magical switch
that I need to flag?

What do you mean? Do you get past the reboot? Do you get to installing
packages?

Sorry I don't use SATA so I can't offer more help.

You can check in your BIOS, it's possible the drive has a "compatibility 
mode" or some such, which would allow you to install (but probably cost 
you in performance).  The drive would then show up as a PATA device 
instead.  Most likely if it's a really new machine the PCI IDs for the 
SATA controller aren't in the kernel yet so it won't recognize it. 
2.6.8 is from last August, which is ancient in driver/hardware time.  If 
you do an lspci do you get unknown devices?

My buddy Jeff put together this sweet Pentium M (Dothan) based dektop 
system. It is his intention to turn it into a MythTV box. His box has a 
Promise SATA controller (not sure exactly which one).

Initially we thought this would be no problem because the latest version 
of Knoppix booted and recognized the 200GB drive. We attempted to 
install FC3 first because we wanted to use Jarod Smith's howto/packages. 
But FC3 could not drive the sata controller. FC3 loaded the promise_sata 
module but the drive was not recognized. Ubuntu 5.04 was the same way. 
The commonality between Ubuntu and FC3 was a sata_promise kernel module 
older than version 1.01.

In the meanwhile Jeff decided to install Gentoo on that system. I don't 
recall reading which sata controller you have but if it is a promise 
this could be your problem.

Interesting point ... Piet, does Knoppix see your hard drive? Knoppix
can and does draw from Debian testing and unstable. Also, which Debian
did you install? Sarge (stable for a couple of weeks) or something else?

IIRC Gentoo stable is still 2.6.11, although I've seen 2.6.12 go by in
the testing portion of the tree. I'm stuck at 2.6.11 until I can get an
MPPE patch for 2.6.12, so I haven't tested it.

Hm.  That sounds like the old version.  Have you tried the new version
that was just released?

I'd also put in a strong recommendation for the new version of Ubuntu.

Charlie,

What version do you have?  I have 1.04 and I'm wondering how to upgrade
it for my RH box.

Well, large scale infrastructure is generally a government-led business 
enterprise... roads, utilities, etc. Things that are for the benefit of 
the people as a whole, without direct profit motive tangling up the 
works.

That being said, I do enjoy the benefits of having the privately owned 
"Internets" ;-) , as it means that government regulation, censorship, 
and control are somewhat mitigated.

I don't suppose it hurts having a country that is 10% smaller than
California. Of course it does have 4 TIMES the population of California
also. 

This means that the infrastructure just has to be beefed up in smaller areas
in order to facilitate the higher bandwidth. This would of course cost less,
and directly be easier to facilitate growth in the future!!

Besides the obvious absurdity of expecting the Thug In Chief to know
what broadband is (he probably thinks "broadband" refers to the Dixie
Chicks, and is agin' 'em),  the NYT isn't thinking about what is
involved in providing broadband to a whole population.  Japan is a
tiny country, and most of the population lives stacked up 20 stories
high.  It is damned easy to provide broadband there.  

The US is 25 times bigger, with a much more varied population. 
We have single farms bigger than some of the Japanese islands.  In
our densest urban areas, I bet the broadband is just as good, but
very little of the US population lives at Japanese densities, and
it costs a lot to get broadband to our single-family-home suburbs.  

Another matter is one of simple demand.  If you ride a subway in
Tokyo, damned near everyone is online all the time, staring crosseyed
at their DoCoMo phones and wearing their thumbs out typing in messages.
A lot of their so-called "broadband infrastructure" is actually store-
and-forward messaging to those phones.  That may be "high bandwidth",
but isn't the same as a cable or fiber.  Also, the transportation is
so crowded there that it is much easier to "visit electronically" than
go from place to place like we do here.  From Hitachi Central Labs out
in the 'burbs, to Shinjuku (the western edge of the inner ring of Tokyo)
is two hours on the express subway.  Much easier to pick up a phone or
send an email, and download a movie rather than go to a video store.  

What can you do with disposable income in Tokyo?  The houses are tiny,
the streets are tiny, no room for cars or dishwashers or video
entertainment centers.  Folks there spend more money on computers and
less on "American" style goods.  So why not spend money on better
bandwidth, too?  A fiber connection is expensive, but it doesn't take
much room...

After you factor in all the geographic, demographic, economic, and
cultural differences between the countries, you will find that the
relative positions in broadband access are about what you would
expect them to be.  If we increased the US population to 4 billion,
or moved everybody in the US into California, Oregon, and Washington,
we would have much better broadband here, too.  If your broadband
sucks, move downtown.  If downtown sucks, move to the sticks and
use a modem.  Life is a tradeoff.

Still, if this is an excuse to dump on Bush, I'll go along. ;-)

It didn't used to be. A lot of roads were originally toll, like most of the 
ferry roads in Portland. There are still privately owned and operated 
turnpikes in the east.

Of course, profit motive combined with competition, which forces products 
to continuously get better, has given us the highest standard of living in 
the world.

Government seldom leads, instead it tends to hop on bandwagons as they are 
coming to fruition.  No government lead the discovery of electricity, the 
telegraph, telephone, FAX, television. (Later government started getting 
into these things.) BTW the Japanese government's targeting heavy industry, 
delayed the creation of the first Sony transistor radio. Sony was the 
second company to market a transistor radio.

Yes. The premise of a corporation, when first instituted, was a 
publicly owned group, acting as a private entity, for the common good.

Depends on the government. Some democracies have state run utilities, 
some went private. Other forms of government went various directions.

See California's recent energy debacle for an example of possible 
problems with privatization in a capitalist democracy...

This might be a logical fallacy. Profit motive drives companies to be 
more profitable than their competition.

Nothing more.

"More profitable" is not always the same thing as a better product. 
Sometimes, a *worse* product is more profitable.

If profit motive and competition are ultimate goals, I'm not sure this 
discussion belongs on a Linux UG. Bill Gates makes much more per diem 
than most Linux and *nix developers, so, do the windows developers make 
better products? Even in aggregate?

>  has given us the highest standard of living in the world.

I suppose that would depend on one's metrics. The US does not have:
The best education system.
The best infant mortality rate.
The best healthcare system.
The best housing system.
(etc.)

All countries have a blend of good and bad, one's individually weighted 
metrics determine standard of living. According to the UN, the US ranks 
not at number one, two, or even three.

*shrug*

I guess it depends on your metrics.

> Government seldom leads, instead it tends to hop on bandwagons as they

I suppose this depends on the government. Too bad there was no such 
thing as DARPA, ARPA, and ARPAnet, and the government had to hop on the 
"interconnected network bandwagon" after private companies had created 
it. :)

>  No government lead the discovery of electricity, the telegraph,

Yes, yes, yes, no, no.

You are also conflating invention with deployment. Private industry 
lacks the resources needed to create right-of-way for wires, or 
ownership of "the commons" for such things as radio bandwidth. 
Government had the resources.

Hello

Read the "Down to the Wire" Foreign Affairs article the NYT refers to
at:
http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20050501faessay84311/thomas-bleha/down-to-
the-wire.html

Read it and weep. The American Telecoms acting like Russian Polit
Bureaus, with armies of lobbyist in Washington spreading truck loads of
money, are defending their turf at any cost.  Satisfying greed
immediately is blinding the Telecoms and Washington to the riches of the
future.

Yes, it is. That's one of the reasons why I'm moving to Canada (our new 
house closes July 12).

Seems that 10 years ago, Canada made the commitment to wire EVERY 
community, no matter how remote - the program is called CANCAP, Canadian 
Community Access Project. At that time, they KNEW that they could not 
predict what technology would look like in 10 or 20 years. So they 
decided to wire everybody, rolling out the newest technologies as they 
came available.

By the end of 2006, EVERY community, including those little Inuiit 
villages north of the Arctic Circle, including those two or three houses 
clustered on some lake that can only be accessed by float plane, 
including every small town and every large city, will have broadband 
access. In the cities, its through the cable companies. In the villages, 
it is through 802.11b/g. And this Fall, they will start rolling out WiMax.

It's a matter of public policy. Something that is totally lacking in 
Second World Countries, like that United States. But then, that's 
contrary to the Libertarian/Christian Facist religion.

I know this should have been on PLUG-Talk, but I refuse to let little 
asides like this slip by. It is because we let neocon phrases and 
ideologies slip into our society's consciousness unchallenged, laughing 
at them as if they were harmless, that our whole society has gone to hell.

If have made the moral decision to challenge all Libertarian and Neocon 
statements at every opportunity, just as I do racist and homophobic 
speech. If you don't want me coming back at you strong on PLUG, only 
spew the Neocon/Libertarian ideology on PLUG-Talk.

Peace, Justice, and Socialism for All,
-Ron

Are you serious? By *ANY* measure, we no longer qualify as a First World 
Country. Infant mortality, life expectancy, literacy, et cetera. The 
only area we lead in is military spending. Which is what is turning us 
from a Second World Country to a Third World Country.

Or, for real-world examples, try BC Ferries or Vancouver's BC Transit 
district.  Ask passengers how they feel about their route being cut, 
and having to pay twice as much for half the service on a route 
farther from them.

Or BC Telecom (now Telus) customers how they like their phone bill 
doubling with no real change in service.

Case in point:  The 1995 Kia Sportage has almost the same size 
interior, 25 more horsepower and 20 MPG better fuel economy over the 
1995 Ford Explorer.  The Sportage cost $9500 well-loaded, a 
comparably-equipped Explorer would cost you well beyond twice that.

I still see plenty of Sportages on the road; my own has just under 
100,000 on the odo with at least another 100,000 left in it.  I can't 
remember the last time I saw a 10-year-old Ford *anything*.

Go by UN metrics, Canada comes out on top and the US rounds out dead 
last for first-world countries.  California, the south and American 
politics do the most to hinder us.

Heh, then move to Canada and pay 50% (or more) income tax and support the 
nation's desire to have free services. That's your choice. This doesn't 
belong on PLUG.

The list has been quite clean (i.e. technical and on-topic) for quite a 
while. I really don't care to hear about your beliefs. Political commentary 
wasn't part of the PLUG description when I joined. If it had been, I 
wouldn't be here.

Message-ID: <42BF0C7D.6060100@paranoid.org>

I haven't ever been a big Debian fan, but we installed Ubuntu on a 
couple of boxes where I work and I liked it. I wanted to play with it 
more and did an install here at home, but the resolution in Gnome seems 
stuck at 640x480. When I go into the Gnome tool to change resolutions, 
it only shows that one on the list.

After some Googling I found the hint to try:

dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

I did this and configured the server to only use 1024x768. I verified 
that the new configuration had been written to the xorg.conf 
(/etc/X11/xorg.conf IIRR), but when I rebooted I was still stuck in 
640x480 like before. After that I edited the xorg.conf so that only this 
existed in the Screen section:

Section "Screen"
         Identifier      "Default Screen"
         Device          "NVIDIA Corporation NV18 [GeForce4 MX - nForce 
GPU]"
         Monitor         "CPD-200ES"
         DefaultDepth    16
         SubSection "Display"
                 Depth           16
                 Modes           "1024x768"
         EndSubSection
EndSection

I rebooted and I was still in 640x480.

Any ideas? I've not run into this before...

Or we can stay here, pretend things get done and piss away 50% less 
taxes to get *NO* services whatsoever while illegals coming over the 
border get everything they want.  Yup, our system works and is really 
better, uh huh.

Ummm... I think now might be a good time to start moving all replies in
this thread to plug-talk.

I know we all want to get the last word in (oh believe me, I do...) but
we all must realize that last word you try to get in is:

a)  going to not be the last word
b)  not going to convince anybody of the correctness of your argument
c)  only going to alienate you from the more level-headed PLUGers here
d)  all of the above

Rich,

   Why a 16-bit color depth? With that video card, and screen resolution of
1024x768 you should easily support 24-bit colors (True Color). That's
essentially the same as 32-bit color.

   I've not had this problem before, but it may be a mis-match between the
color depth and the screen resolution.

   For comparison, here's the relevant sections of /etc/X11/xorg.conf on my
Slackware-10.1 system:

Section "Screen"
     Identifier  "Regular Screen"
     Device      "ATI Rage 128 Pro Ultra"
     Monitor     "Hyundai LCD"

# If your card can handle it, a higher default color depth (like 24 or 32)
# is highly recommended.

#   DefaultDepth 8
#   DefaultDepth 16
    DefaultDepth 24
#   DefaultDepth 32

     Subsection "Display"
         Depth       8
         Modes "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"

     EndSubsection
     Subsection "Display"
         Depth       32
         Modes "1280x960" "1024x768" "800x600"
     EndSubsection

I just set the color depth at 16 because I wanted to simplify things 
when troubleshooting. I don't think it's the cause of the problem at 
all. There was an entry for 24 in the Screen section before I stripped 
everything out.

I had this problem on Friday, it ended up that there were no
horizontal refresh / vert.sync lines for the monitor (I had switched
to an older, but nicer monitor, and it did not support EDIC, or
whatever the autodetection protocol is).

By specifying these setting in the Monitor section, the problem went
away, and X started obeying my settings in the Display and Screen
section(s).

Example settings: (don't use the numbers below unless you *know* they
are correct for you monitor, the example exists so you can spell the
option name correctly :)

HorizSync   31.5 - 50.0
VertRefresh  40-90

Hi Rogan,

I got the same response from someone on the Ubuntu forums, so I'm 
guessing you're right :)  I haven't had a chance to test it yet but I'll do.

I think I chose not the to the "advanced" config of the monitor when I 
did the dpkg-reconfigure, I wonder if that's why the info is not there. 
But the problem was there right after doing the default install too.


Thanks,

Rich

Message-ID: <200506261657.07589.rsteff@comcast.net>

I have Red Hat 7.0 running on a machine with my largest hard drive. I run 
Samba on it, and have been using it regularly with my Winders machines 
(Win98), and can open files on it with Winders applications. I can also move 
files between it and my SuSE 9.1 machine using a Samba client on the SuSE 
machine.

I am trying to make a bigger break with Winders. I still need to be able to 
see and edit some MS Office files kept on the RH 7 machine, but I'd also like 
to be able to edit those same files using Open Office on the SuSE machine. 

It appears that Open Office doesn't interact with Samba. Am I missing 
something in Open Office, or do I need to set up a different network file 
sharing system between the RH machine and the SuSE machine, and if so, will 
it and Samba play nice together? I'm happy to read the documentation, but I 
don't know what system to read about.

Thanks for any advice.

The network transport should be transparent to OO. You need to mount the 
share prior to trying to open the file, but that's pretty much 
universal. You'd have to mount an NFS share before opening the file 
there as well.

So technically, you are right. OO doesn't interactive with Samba. It 
won't mount the share for you.

Once you have the share mounted, you should be able to open the file, 
assuming you have permission to read the file as the user you are 
running OO as.

I've been using OpenOffice.org 1.1.4 on my Windows machine for a 
long time. So when I got my new laptop and installed Linux on it, 
naturally I went for OpenOffice.org. At this time it has 1.1.3 
because it is running Ubuntu and that is all Ubuntu seems to offer. 
In fact, I just went through a lot of frustration trying to get the beta 
of 2.0 installed, and unsuccessfully.

The reason I wanted the beta of 2.0 is that I have been given to 
understand that it fixes a serious problem I am having with 1.1.3 on 
the Ubuntu machine. It seems that OpenOffice.org calls your 
default printer "Generic Printer," and doesn't seem to recognize 
much of its features. I have a big-ass networked Laserjet 5SiMx 
with all kinds of trays and options, most of which I would not be 
able to use, although all my other applications on the Ubuntu 
computer can print to it with the same ease that I can print to it 
from applications on the Windows computer. To solve this problem, 
OpenOffice.org comes with a GUI utility launched by spadmin, a 
script. Unfortunately, spadmin launches for me, but the minute I 
click on a button to do anything it disappears from my desktop.

Worse, I can't even print to the printer from OpenOffice.org on the 
Ubuntu computer because it sends the print job into outer space 
somewhere. The print job never gets to the printer. Again, no 
problem printing to the printer from any other program on the 
Ubuntu computer.

I wanted the beta of 2.0 because I am told that it fixes this problem 
completely. In 2.0 it just uses whatever printer is defined in CUPS 
and uses however it is set up there.

Now, I related this sad tale to you to point out that OpenOffice.org 
on Linux does some odd things. It does not play nicely in the Linux 
world. It seriously needs to work on sharing. Everyone else is 
happy to use stuff that is installed on the Linux computer, but it 
seems to think it needs to have its own personal version of 
everything, all to itself.

So it does not surprise me that it ignores Samba. I haven't tried to 
use Samba yet, as I had to give up on it for the time being. Until 
2.0 comes out and there is a debian package that I can install, I'm 
having to do my word processing on the Windows computer.

Just now I tried using OpenOffice.org Writer on the Ubuntu 
computer to open .sxw files on the Windows share. No go. Can't 
browse to it because all it sees is the Ubuntu filesystem. Then I 
tried opening a Nautilus window to display the Windows share, and 
then dragging and dropping the file on Writer. It showed a + in the 
mouse pointer, but when I dropped it, nothing happened.

So I guess I have no solution. But you might buzz off to 
openoffice.org and look through the feature list for 2.0 to see if it 
will fix this problem. That may be your only hope. Unless you want 
to drag the files to a folder on your Linux computer and open them 
from there, then copy them back to the Windows share.

I agree, it should. Definitely _should_. But it doesn't.

The Windows share is definitely mounted on my Linux laptop. I 
opened a Nautilus browser window and there are all my files. Then I 
launched OpenOffice.org Writer. It can't see the share. It has an 
"Open file" setting under File, but not an "Open location" option. 
Nor can I drag and drop a file from the Nautilus window to the OOo 
Writer window.

All other programs on the Linux machine have no problem seeing 
the share. It's just OpenOffice.org. Well, OK, some can't see it in 
their "Open file" dialog box, but I can drag and drop from a Nautilus 
window onto the application and the file opens fine.

It sux.

Are you sure the share is mounted? Usually that is a separate step. Nautilus 
lets you see the files in a Samba share without it being mounted.  Does it 
appear with the ls command? If ls does not see it, it is not mounted.

Can you right-click on the file in Nautilus and do a "open with..."? (I'm not 
a nautilus user)

I also use OO, and it sees Samba shares in the file open dialog if they are 
actually mounted.

SuSE 9.1 provides desktop icons to start instances of Konqueror for local 
system browsing (called My Computer) and for "Network Browsing." Using 
Network browsing, I navigate to the directory containing the files on the RH 
machine. I assume that this mounts that system on the SuSE machine, but OO 
still does not see the network. I created a link to the directory in 
question. Clicking on it in Konqueror displays the contents of the remote 
directory. Clicking on the entry of the .doc file results in a dialog box 
offering to open the file with OO writer. For some reason, it worked this 
time. I guess I must not have followed that procedure the same way the last 
time.

Thanks for the help.

Probably not. This would be the same as browsing the samba shares from a 
Windows machine with the //machine/path/to/files path.

I'm not sure about OO, but many Linux apps do not support opening files 
this way. I recall a thread on here a few weeks back regarding K3b and 
opening an ISO. It didn't support file:/path/to/file conventions, and 
aborted on that user.

You'll probably have to issue a smbmount or mount -t smb command to 
mount the share on a mountpoint prior to trying to open the file.

That's a good sign. Maybe OO does support opening files via URI.

Yep. Also can drag and drop to the Linux machine's desktop. And 
to an open window in gedit or anything else capable of opening it. 
And I can right click on a file and it give me an "open with" option.

Hmm. Not here. Unless the share is not really mounted. But as far 
as I can tell it is. It meets your tests above.

The Windows share in question is on my Windows 2000 machine. 
To see the files the first time I have to enter my username and 
password for the Windows machine. Thereafter, the share is just 
always there and visible.

So if my Windows share is truly mounted and OpenOffice.org can't 
see it, how come your OpenOffice.org can see your network 
shares? Maybe if I could get the same secret decoder ring you are 
using ... :)

Bear in mind that all I know about networking is what I learned by 
poking at stuff until I got it to work.

"StarOffice on Devil4."

"StarOffice" is the name I gave to the folder on the Windows 
computer where I store StarOffice files. "Devil4" is the name of the 
Windows computer.

Richard is trying to open files on another Linux machine, right? I'm 
trying to get OOo to open files on a Windows share.

When I right click on an .sxw file in the Nautilus browser window 
displaying the Windows share, it does offer "open with 
OpenOffice.Org Writer." But if I go ahead and tell it to do so, it fails 
with an error message that it couldn't find the file.

If it is a .txt file, the "open with" application changes to "Text 
Editor," which by default is gedit. And when I click OK, gedit 
dutifully opens the file without a complaint.

It's not mounted. You are looking at a network location through the 
network share.

You must mount the share on a local mount point. Then OO will be able to 
use the file as if it was local.

Use the mount command to do this.

OK.

I just spent the last half hour trying to figure out the mount 
command and all its options. Unfortunately, getting it understood is 
going to take hours of study. And I have several hours of homework 
yet to get done tonight for classes tomorrow. So that study project 
is going to have to wait.

In the meantime, how come I can drag and drop a file from that 
share (using Nautilus) onto a gedit window and gedit will open it? 
Ditto for "open with" when I right-click on a file in the Nautilus 
window. And I can drag and drop a file from the Nautilus window 
onto the desktop or anyplace else on the Linux computer. 

But if the destination is OpenOffice.org. Then it shows a + on the 
mouse pointer, but nothing happens when I drop it.

That did it, I'm running in 1024x768 now.

Thanks, Rogan :)

The weird thing is that I ran the reconfig again and chose the "advanced"
option where you enter the rates directly. I put them in, but when I
checked the xorg.conf file there was no sign of them. I was definitely
looking at the right file, too. I put them in manually and now it works.

Something brokey...

It appears OO doesn't support the path that your window manager is 
giving it. In my example earlier, k3b didn't support opening a file with 
the URI "file:/path/to/file". But it did support "/path/to/file".

If you can determine what URI nautilus is providing to OO, then maybe we 
can figure out if there's some other URI that will work. Maybe 
"smb://machine/path/to/file" will work if you put that in the file>open 
dialog.

If I remember correctly, you should be able to mount the remote file 
system with this command:

#mount -t smbfs -o username=windowsloginname:password=windowspassword 
machine:/path /mount/point

Alan,

I am trying to install on a HP Vectra VL 800 PC (2.8gh) with 1 GB memory and
a SATA 120 GB disk.

I had trouble earlier with booting Knoppix 3.7 which defaults to the 2.4
kernal on the SATA drives.  When I told 3.7 to boot 2.6 it worked.  Knoppix
3.9 boots just fine (defaults to 2.6). FYI, the FC4 DVD/CD work fine on my
other systems. 

I suspect that the SATA drives are the problem.  I would think the loading
image on the FC4 load DVD/CD would be 2.6, but if not, there does not seem
to be a way to force 2.6 .

Any thoughts?

What hardware are you trying to install it on?

It installed fine on my laptop, but that was the 64 bit version.

Years ago, an Australian posted to one of the Usenet groups I was
following at the time the following rhetorical question: "Why is the
predominant telcommunications corporation of every country always
universally despised?"

People who advocate privitization of utilities (which is what the phone
companies are), argue that customers can't vote out the maangement of
public utilities. People who advocate public ownership of utilities
argue that they are immune to the effects of the marketplace.

Meanwhile, there is too little protection for the average customer from
mistreatment of an organization whose goals are often completely the
opposite -- whether owned by government or a number of investment firms.

Message-ID: <01b401c57b20$c7d9b230$2f01a8c0@dads>

After a lot of blind alleys I finally got my system up.  I suspected a flaky video card (ATI Rage Pro 32M AGP) or hosed AGP support so I dusted off an old S3 PCI video card and gave it a shot- XFree came up with 800x600 resolution (yuk).  I reinserted my ATI card, re-diddled xf86config  and got a lot of complaints about no screen found, etc.  I noticed that the configuration file doing the complaining was XFree86Config-4, so I took a look and found some old settings I hadn't made for some time.  I got adventurous and changed my video driver to "r128" form the "s3virge" that was in the file and entered the higher screen resolutions, rebooted, and there it was.

Now I get to futz with my sound card settings and try to get a reliable home network connection to my other PCs.  This is fun when it finally works.

Side note: I'll stay with X-windows just for the screensavers. Even my 14-year-old likes them.

I tried just now to add these two, but I did it via Synaptic rather 
than directly editing the sources.list file. I started with just the first 
one, but Synaptic choked on it. Said the source was not online or 
there were network problems or I should check the typing. I know 
there are no network problems, and I double-checked the typing, 
but it still wouldn't go.

In the meantime, I already had two Backports sources listed. Can't 
open Synaptic right at the moment because I clicked on the 
Update icon that was active this morning in the panel and it 
announced that it was going to take 40 minutes to download a 
bunch of new Linux-image files. :(

But I remember that both went to someplace that had "caliu" in the 
address, and both were working without error messages.

I couldn't agree more. I do know about editing the sources.list file 
(far from an expert, but I have done it a couple times). The nice 
thing about Synaptic is that if there is something wrong, you find it 
out right away, instead of spending half an hour futzing around only 
to discover that you made a typo. It also has really good error 
messages that even a dummy like me can sometimes figure out 
the meaning of. And it is very good about figuring out what 
additional things need to be installed, helping to eliminate user 
errors.

I'll fiddle with your two Backports sources more later. I have some 
homework to get done before classes today, which will take until 
late afternoon. Then I'll have time to poke at it some more. Since 
you were able to do it, then I know it must be possible for me too. I 
had given up, but now I'll get back on it. It's just going to take some 
time to figure it out. Thanks a lot for the info!

Those are great!  Finally, I can have Firefox 1.0.4.

I just discovered the add custom repo feature in synaptic, so no more
"sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list".

With Ubuntu, I'm starting to use GUI tools when CLI tools would do.
Good gawd, what's happening to meeee!

Russ,

Pop "greylisting" into Google. Wil's choice to use it is, to my mind, a 
feature, not a bug. The only downside is that some MTAs will wait longer 
than you'd expect to resend the deferred message, which can result in 
annoying delays.

Still, mailing lists are supposed to be async, right? :-)

I'm just trying to understand what happened. Obviously my message came 
through, I was just confused by the message I got.

It appeared to me that I was blocked from sending, and for that I wanted 
to know what I'd done to deserve that. I don't remember being involved 
in a flame war lately... :)

I also notice that this behavior doesn't require me to do anything. I'm 
all for reducing spam, which, co-incidently, is what I was attempting to 
do on my end when I noticed the log entry.

Greylisting is not (usually) discriminate. It has nothing to do with the 
content of your messages, past or present. It works on the assumption 
that spam runs won't even try to follow up on deferred messages, while 
legitimate MTAs will try again in a few minutes.

OK, I gave those a shot this morning when William's post first 
showed up. I couldn't get them to work using Synaptic (Custom 
button, which I have used without a problem before) on Ubuntu-64. 
But I didn't have enough time to try to figure out why.

I got home a little bit ago and the first thing I did was try again. I 
started with just the first one. And I got the same error message as 
this morning --

"The repository might be no longer available or could not be 
contacted because of network problems. If available an older 
version of the failed index will be used. Otherwise the repository will 
be ignored. Check your network connection and the correct writing 
of the repository address in the preferences."

And the box below says --

"http://ubuntu-backports.mirrormax.net/dists/hoary-
extras/deb/binary-amd64/Packages.gz: 404 Not Found [IP: 
70.84.217.98 80]"

And when I click on OK to proceed, Synaptic then gives me a 
Warning --

"W: Couldn't stat source package list http://ubuntu-
backports.mirrormax.net hoary-extras/deb Packages 
(var/lib/apt/lists/ubuntu-backports.mirrormax.net_dists_hoary-
extras_deb_binary-amd64_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or 
directory)"

So then I tried just the other one. This time I got a different error 
message --

E: Type 'http://ubuntu-backports.mirrormax.net' is not known on 
line 28 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list
E: Unable to lock the list directory

That error message box had only an OK button on it. When I 
clicked on it Synaptic disappeared from my desktop.

So, to further see if I could figure out what was going wrong, I 
opened sources.list in gedit. I was especially curious about what 
was on the mysterious line 28. And when I opened it, it turns out 
line 28 is the last line, the line I had just added (#2 above).

I have two theories --

1) This is 64-bit Ubuntu and those repositories have nothing for 64-
bit, or because this is a 64-bit OS, Synaptic is specifically looking 
for an "amd64" folder and such does not exist in those repositories, 
or

2) The two backports repositories that I have had listed for some 
time are creating a conflict. They are --

deb ftp://ftp2.caliu.info/backports/ hoary-extras main universe 
multiverse restricted
deb ftp://ftp2.caliu.info/backports/ hoary-backports main universe 
multiverse restricted

Any ideas or suggestions?

Yep. GUI is not just for beginners, it is usually faster, and also far 
less error prone. And Synaptic is one GUI feature that is extremely 
well done. Beats the hell out of YaST on Suse and similar tools on 
other RPM distros. I'm becoming more and more enamoured of 
debian systems the more I get into Linux.

Now, can someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong so I can 
get the missing files for the latest OpenOffice.org 2.0 beta? I hate 
having to write in OOo on my Linux machine and then transfer the 
file to the Windows machine to print it from StarOffice/Windows. :(

Thanks in advance :)

I want to run Snort on a box with multiple interfaces. The first

the network I want to sniff.

I want the second interface to be transparent, like a bridge. In other 
words, it will have no IP address bound to it, it will just grab the 
traffic off the wire in stealth mode.

I've used Snort before, but never with an interface that did not have an 
IP bound to it. What do I need to do to configure that second interface 
so that Snort can listen on it, without assigning it an IP? What 
ifconfig command would set it up to work that way? This is a Linux box.

I believe it is a GTK control, not a QT control.

With all due respect, what you *don't* want is someone who knows the
subject matter. What you want in a reviewer is someone who *doesn't*
know it, to ask the questions that you as an expert take for granted. I
do a lot of technical writing, and I find that I have to seek reviewers
who know nothing, or my stuff is unreadable!

Just: ifconfig ethX up
Might work.. (that should assign 0.0.0.0 to it, iirc) and tell snort to use 
that interface.

You realize if you're on a switched network nothing will come to that
second interface without arp poisoning, right?

What you're describing, though, is promiscuous mode, I believe.  It's
what I use on my VPN/bridge deployments to get the interfaces to accept
all packets sent to them (and send it on to the bridging magic).

man iptables has the details.

More like gargantuan money. All the analysis is saying that they were
overturning things *strictly* because Grokster actively promoted theft.
Looks P2P lives on for now.

As someone else pointed out, if you are on a switch that doesn't have 
port mirroring/spanning you won't get much traffic without an arp 
poisoning attack.

That said, it is probably easiest to configure the interface as you 
would any other interface, except assign 0.0.0.0 to it.  Manually, do 
ifconfig ethX 0.0.0.0 up.  On RedHatish systems set 
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ethX to have IPADDR=0.0.0.0, and 
just for kicks you can throw in PROMISC=yes.  Setting promiscuous mode 
explicitly isn't really needed on Linux though, as Snort should be able 
to set it for you (either by default or through a command-line option).

Also, be sure to feed Snort the command-line option to tell it which 
interface to use, or it might pick the wrong one.

The switch does spanning.

Ok. Yeah, I know that Snort will turn on promiscuous mode for me.

That'll be done in the config.

John,

Hmm,
I had problems with the backports repositories in the past, but not with
this sources.list.  The Ubuntu forums are an awesome source of
information.  I found this link in reference to backports entitled
"Getting Started With Backports":
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=40291

And this is a link for another approach to getting OO 2.0 beta going in
case that does not help:
http://www.evolutioncolt.com/mainweb/?q=node/11

I really do like Ubuntu, and it is not just because I am a Linux newbie.
Well, I am a newer than the long timers on this list, but have been
using it for ~one year now (four months as my main OS), am 1/2 way to
the LPIC level 1 cert., and I am currently taking my 3rd Linux class at
PCC.  Someone posted about how they like Debian more and more the more
they learn, and that is how I feel also.  Ubuntu gives the Debian +s
without the negatives (long, long, long time between releases) and wraps
it up into a fresh GUI for both Gnome and KDE fans.  apt-get and
Synaptic are a step above yum IMHO.  Ubuntu lets you get as geeky as you
want, and I think that is a huge factor in it's success thus far.

Good luck John, let us know if you get it working!

Reid

Use your browser to debug this, you should be able to browse right to

This looks like a typo, or missing phrase, it seems like "Type" would be

It's a feature of the theme you're using for firefox. You can go to 
Tools -> Themes to choose another one.  (If there's only one listed
click on 'Get More Themes' to get a list of way too many to choose from.)

And if you're really gung ho, you can go to

to learn how to create your own theme.

Ali,

   Aha! I forgot all about this.

   Er, ... no. For me, fiddling with appearance is a waste of time so the only
time I spend is when something becomes sufficiently annoying or distracting.

I'm sorry to hear you're either going blind or don't get out on the road.

My Ranger pickup is 10 years old, the F150 I sold to a co-worker is now
26, over the weekend I saw at least ten original series Mustangs - those
are now about 40.  While driving in Washington recently I noted a number of 
classic, round taillight, Fords.  Those are at least 35.

I can't say that I've seen one.  Maybe something in the barcode/OCR land 
(though I was looking for optical barcode recognition this weekend and 
didn't come up with anything.)

Here's the only OSS OCR that I know of.

  http://jocr.sourceforge.net/

Maybe it could be extended or refactored to provide a mark recognition 
API?  Are you looking for something with a front-end or just a library?

I figured the Fords looked so good you couldn't tell they were over 10 
years old...

Eric,

   I've used this for several years now, occasionally. It works well enough to
disassemble protected pdfs from the displayed image.

   A library.

   With some more research I've pretty well decided that 1) the solution is
related to the specific hardware scanner we'll use and 2) it wou't be
difficult to write a python (or C) program that will read the signals and
store the data appropriately.

Thanks,

Rich

Just a quick FYI to point out the article profiling the two candidates
for the PTP election of President. As mentioned in the article, both Don
Park and Aaron Baer are Linux users - Ubuntu and Gentoo.

Subject: [PLUG] Setting up a dial-in server...
Message-ID: <1120028391.42c246e751e45@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I'm trying to set up a dial in server using Fedora Core I and a Kermit
chipset 56k modem.  I don't have two phonelines, is there some way I
can test my ppp setup over an ethernet or serial connection?

I want to try

     refuse-chap
     refuse-pap
     login

on a system that uses shadow passwords.  Do I need to add some another
directive because of the shadow passwords?

Can an Intel 536EP chipset modem talk to a Kermit chipset modem?  All
I'm after is giving a friend a free, convenient, and fast way to
activate her XP system.  Originally I got the Intel modem thinking
I could answer the phone with it under Linux.  There's a driver from
Intel for Linux, but it doesn't support the voice feature.  But I'm
digressing.  If these two modems can have a data conversation, that's
good enough.  

The Kermit chipset modem is:
Model 0727 Product 3CP3298-DEL (3CP5610 equivalent)
with Texas Instruments TL16CFM700PGE (Kermit) chipset

This is the full options.server I've come up with following instructions
from someone named Carla Schoeder.

I'm trying to follow her instrustions at:
http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/netos/article.php/10951_2238531_2

asyncmap 0
modem
crtscts
lock
login
refuse-pap
refuse-chap
proxyarp
192.168.5.1:192.168.5.2

I'm using her AutoPPP line and I think inittab has
the proper addition.  I used minicom and had the
modem dial an old ISP to figure out what com port
it's on, ttyS4.  I'm setting up the Kermit modem
in the server, well the box that will be dialed
into anyways.

Anyhow, I figure there's a Skutch AS-80 that would
simulate a phone line well enough for a test, but
that's too spendy.  A second line of service, even
for just a month, would also be too spendy here in 
Scappoose, $53.  For that kind of money, I can sign 
her up with an ISP instead or reactivate her DSL.  
Pacifier used to offer free trial dial-up accounts, 
but I couldn't find that service when I searched for 
it recently.

Has anyone had any experience calling Microsoft to
get their XP system activated?  What does it cost
to go that route?  I really hate XP.  Fedora isn't
working perfectly on her system, but I tend to think
she likes it more right now considering that it's 
usable.  Microsoft must realize if people get hit 
with viruses that they're going to go out and buy 
a new hard drive to reinstall Windows to.  I wish 
Microsoft would lay off on the activation madness.  
My advice is to buy two identical hard drives when 
you're setting up a new XP system so that you can 
bit copy one to the other.  This is one case where 
dd is your friend.  With Microsoft's attitude though,
how long will it be before imaging an XP disk is 
considered an act of piracy?

Geesh, I hope she's quite hot.  :-)

I've never considered setting up a dialin server to hook a woman
before... 'tis quite creative.  ;-)

Yeah, I had to do it on my last batch of computers due to some nVidia
driver funkiness (hey, they aren't just funky for Linux!).  It cost me
about five minutes per computer over an eight-hundred number on a landline.

I suppose if I were billing for those five minutes individually, it cost
me about $60 per computer... but I think that's pushing things a bit.  :-)

Close - My wife wona a copy of MS 2003 Enterprise Server Porfessional (or 
something crunchy-sounding like that) as a high-tech door prise.

We activated it by having me drive into town to a random pay phone with a 
5-watt CB walkie-talkie, and her back home on the base unit. (Late 70's 
tech!)

I called the numner, got the automated voice, and relayed commands to her. She 
relayed the activation code which was displayed on the screen, which I 
punched in on the phone. The I relayed her the responding activation code 
(which we both wrote down as well.)

So much for preserving what anonymity one can, and also -NOT- being a 
telemarketing victim.
