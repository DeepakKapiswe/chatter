Subject: [PLUG] Greek keyboard
Message-ID: <20131001080945.4d63b6a2@Devil8>

I'm sure the instructions for switching the keyboard on my Xubuntu
12.04 laptop to Greek are out there on the net somewhere, but I want to
set only my second workspace to Greek, leaving the first workspace as
it is.

Is this a possibility?

I think this says it's standby:

I'm guessing this is likely.

Might be time to look for a replacement power supply.

Thanks for the info, Keith.

I'd like to find a tablet computer that I can use with wi-fi at home. I 
don't need a service to go with it, and I'd just as soon have it run a 
flavor of Linux. What's the right set of Google foo to find linux 
compatible tablet hardware? The little bit of looking I've done has some 
old links, or talks more about software.

I'll want to be able to visit web sites and probably use it for a MythTV

Any recommendations?

There are three apps in the play store. One of them seems reasonable (not a first
project, still being maintained)

Subject: [PLUG] MythTV setup
Message-ID: <52507652.7060208@dicksteffens.com>

After a couple of weeks I now have some time to spend on my MythTV 
setup. The box has been shut down for those two weeks. I now have made a 
place for it where it can be left running.

For whatever reason when I powered up the box the schedule information 
was missing. I also had an error message asking me if the back end was 
running, and if the IP address was correct. After running mythtv-setup I 
verified that the answer to both of those questions is yes. And, after 
restarting mythbackend I'm no longer asked those questions.

However, I have no program data.

I went back to mythtv-setup and checked Video source setup. It shows 
that for the video source named Antenna, the Grabber is North America 
(Schedules Direct) (Internal). Using the arrow keys I cannot get to the 
Retrieve Lineups button. Clicking on it with the mouse cursor I can see, 
briefly, a progress bar that shows 50%, and has shown 50% for many minutes.

On the Connect source to input screen, I can reach the Fetch channels 
from listing source button, as well as the Scan for channels button. 
When I clicked on the Scan for channels button I watched it step through 
all the channels (0? through 69) that are visible from my antenna. But 
when I click on the Fetch channels from listings source button I don't 
see anything happening.

Any idea what's messed up, and how to fix it?

Thanks.

I have one of those on a shelf somewhere. I got it last December, but 
haven't figured out a way to use it in Linux, and haven't gotten around 
to using it with XP.

When you use your ION USB turntable, do you use the USB connection with 
Linux? I haven't found a way to use the USB part except with XP. (I've 
had it for several years) The version of audacity that came with it 
includes a Windows driver for the USB side. I have used the turntable 
with Linux by connecting its standard audio cables to the audio in part 
of my sound card. I'd rather use the USB connection because it seems to 
handle record level setting on the USB side better then I get with my 
own record level settings on the sound card.

I've definitely come across a USB cassette player that worked in Linux
(without additional drivers) it was some cheapo on name Chinese brand
though. 

USB audio is a standard specification, so anything that reports itself
as a USB audio device should work out of the box.

   Actually, I've not yet tried it. I bought it because I understood that it
would work with linux.

   Paul's information suggests that the turntable (and the cassette player)
would work with linux because audio output should be OS-agnostic.

Paul,

   Your second paragraph suggests that your first paragraph is not an
exception. I know nothing about audio with linux, but suspect that a USB
turntable or cassette deck should not require Microsoft-specific software to
work.

   Time to do a bit more digging.

Thanks,

Rich

Paul/Dick:

   Audacity is cross-platform; ergo, if it works equally well in windoze and
linux it'll work with the ION hardware.

   Here's the URL for their tutorial on using music-generating devices and
producing audio CDs and/or .mp3 files:

<http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/tutorial_copying_tapes_lps_or_minidiscs_to_cd.html>

   I'm ordering the cassette player.

Thanks to both of you,

Rich

You don't need special hardware for that.  I've had good success
connecting the line out from a tape deck in the microphone jack and
using arecord to dump the incoming audio signal to disk.  Clean up the
resulting PCM in Audacity and export to your preferred file type (MP3,
FLAC, etc.).

Even though I don't have any program guide info today I can still watch 
and record with MythTV. Around 4:15 I recorded a part of a '60s western 
on one of the non-HD channels. Later on I played it back. Nice and 
clear. Around 5:00 I decided to see if the Ohio State/Northwestern game 
would come in choppy on the HD channel. Nice and clear. Later on I'll 
try recording a segment of it and see how it looks played back. What I'm 
wondering is if I'm getting a clearer signal today than I got a couple 
of weeks ago. It's a nice clear day (weather-wise) today. I don't recall 
what the weather was like when I tried looking at an HD channel before.

More experimenting.

Interesting side note:

I have cable going to the TV in the living room, and I'm getting the 
non-HD version of channel 2. I tuned the game on that TV and also on the 
Myth box. There is a delay of several seconds (5? 10?) between the two. 
Strange.

I expect that in some cases distortion will occur.  Line levels are are
significantly higher than mic. levels.  My card has separate input jacks
for mic. and line.  However, some cards may have built-in
software-selectable attenuators to accommodate line levels in the mic.
input.

Subject: [PLUG] Mythbuntu and nVidia
Message-ID: <525B1B74.1090909@dicksteffens.com>

When I was setting up my current desktop, a Gateway with a 64 bit 
processor, I remember learning that the nVidia driver did not work with 
64 bit, but would work with 32 bit. And so that is what I am running on 
this machine. This was back in March, 2013.

I'm running the 64 bit version of Mythbuntu on my Toshiba Satellite. No 
nVidia there. When I get around to installing it on a box with an nVidia 
card in it, will I run into the same issue I had with the Gateway, or 
has that been resolved since March?

Nvidia has had 64bit versions of their proprietary binary drivers
available for many years - I use it on Slackware64. I don't know why you
were told, or think, that Nvidia 64bit drivers are unavailable.

This might be (lazy) fail of your Linux distribution package managers.
There is no reason any of the 64bit Ubuntu flavors should not have
current Nvidia drivers for both CPU architectures.

For newer Linux kernels, if the built-in nouveau driver is inadequate
for your needs, you can blacklist that driver and download the
appropriate version for you CPU and GPU from here:

http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html

The download is a script + driver that you run as root (or via sudo) in
the command line that steps you through the install process. This
installation works ok 99% of the time as long as your distro didn't do
anything freaky with library locations.

Have fun.

I don't remember where I got the idea, but it was back when I was 
setting up this box with Ubuntu 12.04, back in the spring.

Well, I'll have to try it again when the time comes to re-install on 
this machine. At this point everything works fine, so I'm not concerned 
about not taking advantage of the 64 bit capability of the machine. And 
since this machine is the one with the weak capacitors in the power 
supply (at least that's what it seems to be) I may not bother until I 
upgrade to a newer box.

Thanks for the info.

I'm currently running a 64-bit kernel and the nVidia driver on my Mythbuntu 
box. I needed the proprietary driver to get audio over hdmi functioning.
It works very well.

At least, so far.

I've been struggling with one system because I recently upgraded from 10.04LTS 
to 12.04LTS. And so I spent far too much time trying to restore the Gnome 
interface. Since then I've been randomly getting "Maximum number of clients 
reached" from the X server (a known issue, but apparently not a very high priority 
issue). 
 https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/1045899

Regardless, the only real way to recover is to restart X. Since I was facing 
that again anyway yesterday I figured it was a good time to do updates.

When I rebooted my display wouldn't configure properly. 

I go though a KVM that doesn't pass EDID from the monitor. Because of that I 
have an xorg.conf file, with a "PreferredMode" option to explicitly set the 
video mode that I need. For some reason, it's ignoring that now. A line in the 
log file says, "'PreferredMode' option ignored" with no explanation.

>From what I've found online this seems to be an issue with the nVidia driver. I 
can't say that for sure, all I know is this update broke my system. Now I'm 
afraid to do updates on any of my other systems. There have been other issues 
since the update - after unblanking the screen this morning compiz locked up 
with 100% cpu, and I had to ssh in from another system and kill it. And certain 
menus assocated with specific programs are opening in strange locations.

I can almost believe Ubuntu sabatoged X to create support for their "Mir" 
replacement. Right now I'm really, really unhappy. X11R4 has been around since 
before Linux. It should be one of the most mature programs on the platform. 
There's no excuse for this to happen with an update.

IMHO, nothing beats a clean install when upgrading major versions

Most *buntus suck when upgrading if you have ANY software, especial
kernel drivers, not in the original software set.  Ubuntu does not know
how to deal with the proprietary Nvidia blob since Nvidia stomps on
quite a few X.Org files.  When you upgrade all or any of the following
can occur:
1. Ubuntu restores the original X.Org server files
2. removes nouveau driver from blacklist
3. doesn't update Nvidia and/or recompile new kernel interface properly
4. etc.

Ubuntu is notorious for screwing up Nvidia installations. If you want,
need to update
1. back up ALL user data
2. remove ALL non Ubuntu software. synaptics/apt-get has a way for you
to look at what software is "official" and what is "extra"
3. get nouveau running
4. update
6. reinstall non Ubuntu software.

I say, a POX on House Canonical for mangling what could have been a
decent user friendly distro.

(YMMV, as a Slackware I am not burdened by your issues.)

Have Fun

Initially it came up in a mode my monitor didn't support. Eventually, after 
searching and tweaking for an hour or more last night, I got it to at least 
come up in 1024x768 (pretty awful when the native resolution is 1920x1200).

I could use the nVidia configuration tool to reset the video mode. I tried 
saving a new xorg.conf file, but that didn't seem to do any good, as I found 
out when I just now had to log out and back in because

Oct 13 22:24:10 kernel: [79565.080103] nautilus[6439]: segfault at 10 ip b6ef1151 sp bfc13cb8 error 4 in libcairo.so.2.11000.2[b6ea6000+c7000]
Oct 13 22:29:09 kernel: [79864.478015] gnome-settings-[6401]: segfault at 10 ip b6bbb151 sp bfabe078 error 4 in libcairo.so.2.11000.2[b6b70000+c7000]

and my display suddenly reverted to 1024x768 again, and I can't launch the 
nVidia config tool to restore it. 

<sigh>

Subject: [PLUG] More MythTV Related Testing
Message-ID: <525C2932.3020900@dicksteffens.com>

While not strictly MythTV, the following test is related.

I took my main desktop box (Gateway E-4500D, with 64 bit Intel Pentium 4 
CPU 2.80 GHz, running 32 bit Ubuntu 12.04) to the living room yesterday. 
It has an nVidia GeForce 210, which has an HDMI port. I connected that 
to my Panasonic plasma TV (TC-42PX14), a 720p HDTV. I wanted to see if 
that level of nVidia card was adequate to for MythTV.

Earlier in the week I used my MythTV test box to record Oregon Field 
Guide, the episode about the ice caves on the Sandy Glacier on Mt. Hood. 
I copied the mpg file over to my desktop machine so I'd be able to look 
at it on the TV. The picture was clear and steady, and the sound was 
good, too.

Next I used HDHomeRun Config GUI to look at the stations I could see 
with my little dipole antenna sitting on a window sill. Channel 10 has 
good video and audio, as do a few others. Other stations had poorer 
video and/or poorer audio. I'm guessing this is related to the antenna, 
either the placement of it, or the simplicity of the Radio Shack dipole. 
Also, channel 8 does not appear at all. Again, I'm guessing this is 
related to the antenna, which sits on a north facing window sill about 5 
miles east of I-205 exit 10.

Another test I did was to switch between the cable input on the TV and 
the computer input while watching the same program. I chose the football 
game between San Francisco and Arizona. The video from the antenna was 
clearer than the video from the cable and, of course, it was HD, so I 
had the whole thing, instead of missing a bit of the edges. On this 
particular network it's not as important, but some of the networks put 
the graphic showing details of where we are in the game in the upper 
left corner of the screen -- all the way to the left. Apparently, 
Comcast (and maybe others, too) chops the edges of the HD image to 
create the SD image they send out over the cable.

So, it appears that this lower end nVidia card is adequate. Any reason I 
didn't cover with my experiment that would suggest I need a higher end card?

No, your GPU is fine. Any GPU from the last 5 yrs or so is fine. My
old 7600GS was adequate for 720/1080p mp2 and 720p mp4 on an athlon64
1.8Ghz yrs ago.

Your 210 and P4 are more than adequate for  1080p mp2/mp4 streams

Subject: [PLUG] Installing a Python program
Message-ID: <525DE25D.3070004@dicksteffens.com>

Background: target machine us running Ubuntu 12.04 in Gnome session 
fallback mode (or whatever they called it).

I have the source code for a program to allow the use of a USB 
transcribing foot pedal. When I try to run it in the directory in which 
the source code resides I get an error message:

_________________________________________________________________________________ 

:~/Documents/Programming/footpedal/footpedal-0.4.orig$ python footpedal
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "footpedal", line 763, in <module>
     fs = FootpedalAppWindow(options.installed, options.showpanel)
   File "footpedal", line 415, in __init__
     self.populateUserInterface()
   File "footpedal", line 503, in populateUserInterface
     self.set_icon_from_file( self.icon_path )
glib.GError: Failed to open file '/usr/share/footpedal/footpedal.png': 
No such file or directory
_________________________________________________________________________________ 


This is a program that long ago was available through Ubuntu's 
Launchpad. I use it on a machine running Ubuntu 10.04. Now I'm trying to 
move this last bit over to my 12.04 machine so I can run a single 
machine to get my work done. The program is no longer supported through 
Launchpad, but I assume that, with the source code, I can somehow get it 
to work on 12.04.

I also assume that the error message is there because the program 
expects to have been installed in /use/share. So, my question is, how do 
I install this program? Is it as simple as putting the directory with 
the source code in /usr/share and creating a link to it? Or is there 
something "fancier" that I need to do?

In 10.04 I have an icon that looks like a bare foot in the launcher 
panel. It's properties are:

Type: Application
Name: footpedal
Command footpedal

I'd like to be able to do the same thing in 12.04. Any guidance on how 
to proceed would be appreciated.

Dick,

   As root, run

 	find / -name footpedal.png

and see where it's located. If it's not there, copy it from another machine;
if it's there, either mv it to /usr/share/footpedal/ or make a soft link to
that directory.

Have you tried installing from a package? Is this it?

  http://code.google.com/p/footpedal/downloads/detail?name=footpedal_0.4-0ubuntu1_all.deb

Looks like it needs some tweaking to work on 12.04:

Actually, I know where it is. What I was trying to figure out is the 
proper way to get the whole shebang into /usr/share/footpedal.

But, it looks like John has a useful find.

Thanks, though.

Thanks, John. Both of those are useful.

I downloaded the deb, and then tried to edit the appropriate file per 
the second link you provided. It appeared to be successful. Then I 
installed the deb using the Ubuntu Software Center.

On 10.04 that installation

When I ran it I got the same error messages. So, I went to /usr/bin and 
edited footpedal. The comments were not there. So, I guess it's not a 
good idea to try to edit a file inside a package. Anyway, I put the 
comments back in, saved the file.

The file runs, but does not provide the indicator icon that when clicked 
allows changing the configuration of the buttons. However, I suspect 
that I can spend some time with the program file and figure out what to 
change to eliminate all the options I don't want to use. The original 
programmer use the footpedal for more than start/stop/rewind types of 
functions, and he has volume up/down as the default.

Thanks, again.

I will be present, but I am not a Myth guru, nor have I even ever
installed it. But I have long been interested in Myth, so I would love
to look over shoulders to watch.

Subject: [PLUG] T-bird won't retrieve messages for default account
Message-ID: <5260482C.4010901@dicksteffens.com>

Yesterday I converted several IMAP accounts to POP accounts by copying 
out messages I wanted to save, deleting the account from Thunderbird, 
and then recreating the account, manually telling Thunderbird to use POP 
instead of IMAP. Everything appeared to be working correctly.

Next I changed the default account and deleted the account that used to 
be the default account. Again, everything appeared to be working correctly.

This morning I accidentally closed Thunderbird. When I reopened it I was 
asked for a password for the four accounts that are not the default, but 
I wasn't asked for a password for the default account. When I click on 
Inbox in Local Folders and then click on Get Mail nothing appears to 
happen. I can send mail from the default account, but can't retrieve 
any. I know there is mail to retrieve because I can see it using the web 
mail interface for the account.

I've posted this at the Thunderbird forum, but no one's looked at it, yet.

Any ideas as to what happened and how to fix it?

Thanks.

I dug deeper into the Account Settings. Hidden away under the Advanced 
button on the Server Settings is a check box that says, "Include this 
server when getting new mail." It was not checked. I checked it and the 
problem went away. I have no idea how it got unchecked.

Part of what my MythTV installation counts on is specific IP addresses, 
one of which is my HDHomeRun box. I have it set to 192.168.0.100. I'm 
not sure if that will play well on the Free Geek network. I also have 
the Myth box set to 192.168.0.238. Again, I don't know if that will play 
well in the Free Geek network. Would a WRT54G sitting between the Free 
Geek network and my equipment help things?

Free Geek does have wireless as well as wired connections. I don't know
what kind of wireless router it is, but it generally works fine. I
always connect my laptop to it rather than the wire.

Another concern is bandwidth. When I first get to Free Geek the
connection is nice and fast. An hour later with a dozen Clinic people
hitting Google and heaven only knows what else it can bog down, both
wired and wireless.

I don't think bandwidth is going to be a problem for what I'm dealing 
with. We'll probably tune in some channel Sunday afternoon, but the real 
purpose of the experiment is to figure out a setup issue, and modest 
bandwidth will be fine for that.

Try deleting $HOME/.nvidia-settings-rc  as that file sometimes gets
corrupted resulting in nvidia-settings not launching.  Also, try
running nvidia-settings from the command line (terminal window) to see
what errors it kick up.  You could have a borked xorg.conf - sometimes
autodetection is screwy and you need to check it to see if any weird
stuff is set up.

Interestingly, there were more updates pushed out a couple of days ago. Among 
them were Xorg and gnome-settings updates. After I applied them I rebooted and 
magically the system is now honoring my PreferredMode option in the xorg.conf 
file, and I haven't had a crash since.

knock on wood, the problems seem to be fixed.

I have a slew of updates waiting on my Mythbuntu system that I've been afraid 
to apply. I guess I feel safer about it now.

I have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
When I start the update it gets a list of 51 updates.
When I select install updates it starts then reports "failed to 
download package files"
This happened from Comcast tonight and a few days age. Tonight I also 
tried Clear Wireless with the same result.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks

Probably the issue is the server. Sometimes the server can be offline.
I suggest waiting a day or so and trying again.

If that does not resolve the issue, then go into Software Sources and
check what server you are set to. I believe the default is the server
for the US, but it may be "Main" or some other server. Whatever it is,
set it to use a different server.

And while you're at it, there is an option to find out which server is
the fastest. Try it out and you may find that your current server is
not the fastest. Having said that, in the past I have set it to what
appeared to be a faster server only to discover that not all servers
mirror every single package, so sometimes stuff will be missing.

They may have deleted it as a separate application. You can get the
same thing from Synaptic Package Manager. Look under Settings or
something, and then Repositories.

That can happen if the selected files have been replaced by later updates.
Have you forced update manager to check for new updates?

Well, my crashes and screen resolution issues may have been solved, but the 
resource leaks haven't. 

After a random amount of time I start getting 
  Maximum number of clients reached
errors from X. Right now I have exactly 3 firefox windows, one terminal window, 
and one Pigin window open. I can't seem to open anything else.

my .xsession-errors file has lots of stuff like 
Maximum number of clients reached
(nautilus:5991): GnomeDesktop-WARNING **: Unable to open display ':0.0' when setting background pixmap
Maximum number of clients reachedMaximum number of clients reachedCould not parse arguments: Cannot open display: 

<sigh>

I should have stayed on 10.04.

Okay. Glad to know before I make the technological fax pas.

I wouldn't have been trying to use the wireless part of it, but I'm not 
well versed enough in the setup of a WET54G to know that I have wireless 
completely disabled.

I suppose I could let the Myth box work with CPD for the afternoon, and 
then change it back to static when I get back home.

Thanks,
I found that and switched to the "main server" which told me I didn't 
need any updates.
I then switched back to the "United States" server and it found 103 
updates. But the update failed again.

I just tried it again today and it updated OK.

Thanks for the help
JK

Message-ID: <52647F7B.2000406@dicksteffens.com>

Thanks, Galen, for the help with my MythTV installation at the clinic 
this afternoon.

When I got home from the clinic I started up the laptop, stopped the 
Myth frontend, edited /etc/network/interfaces, deleting all those 
comment signs in front of the static IP entries and putting on in front 
of the DHCP entry. Then I ran MythTV Backend Setup and changed the IP 
address in the General section to the static IP address of the machine.

However I was unable to see anything through the HDHomeRun.

After a bunch of fooling around I discovered that the laptop will not 
see the Internet. I am able to ping the router, and other boxes in the 
house, including the HDHomeRun. I can discover the HDHomeRun using 
hdhomerun_config discover, but I can't get anywhere with Google Chrome 
outside the house. I can see my internal web server, though.

Any idea what I've missed?

Probably your nameservers in /etc/resolv.conf  were changed at the
clinic and you need to change them back to their previous settings for
your house.

While static IPs can be handy they often cause  problems like you
describe above.  The way around this is to DHCP instead, but give the
computer a memorable hostname. Then use hostname in the places you are
currently using static IP.  This saved me just last week when someone
changed a router on a remote system I manage. The router used a
different default network, but because I was using hostnames no one
had to go in and adjust any static IPs.

Thanks for the comments. Galen mentioned something about them this 
afternoon, too. I must spend some time learning more about host names, 
and then setting them up.

Sounds like multiple problems. 

You probably didn't set up a default route when you switched to static IPs. 
DHCP provides more than just the IP address, it also sets the nameserver and 
default routes. And then there's resolv.conf, or whatever they're using now
(<sigh> I just looked at my Ubuntu system, and resolv.conf is pointing to 
'localhost', and I've got something called 'dnsmasq' listening on that port).


You can still use DHCP and have static IP addresses. Edit the dhcpd.conf file 
to provide fixed addresses for those hosts you want, restart the dhcp server,
then let your systems use DHCP to set up networking. You can get the MAC 
address from 'ifconfig'.

When you say "I was unable to see anything through the HDHomeRun" what do you 
mean? Are you saying myth can't find your HDHomeRun? How do they get their IP 
addresses assigned?

Tweaking the DHCP server is a lot easier and cleaner than messing with and 
tracking fixed addresses the way you're doing it. Set it once and forget it, as 
long as the hardware (specifically the NIC) doesn't change it will always work 
right.

Set a subnet range for assigning to 'guest' systems that doesn't include the 
fixed IPs' you're assigning elsewhere:

subnet 192.168.10.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
 range 192.168.10.100 192.168.10.200;
}

Then set the addresses for your 'fixed' hosts:

host myth  { hardware ethernet 40:61:86:e4:1f:3b;
 fixed-address 192.168.10.10;
 option host-name "myth";
}

host hdhomerun  { hardware ethernet 00:18:dd:01:a1:9a;
 fixed-address 192.168.10.15;
}

(those are from my dhcpd.conf file)

While you're at it, set up a nameserver to resolve your local hosts, and keep 
it in sync with dhcpd.conf. Don't forget to specify it in the dhcpd.conf file:

option domain-name-servers 192.168.10.6

Of course, if you're using something like a linksys or dlink router to handle 
your dhcp you can still do all that, it's just different.

Using DHCP to manage your fixed IP addresses is so much better, in multiple 
ways.

For one, it provides a central place to manage/track systems and their 
addresses across the entire network. No warrying about getting hosts files out 
of sync.

But even better, things "just work". I have a laptop for work. When I'm plugged 
in at home I have a fixed address (also reflected in my nameserver config). But 
I can unplug it and take it to Starbucks, or anywhere else, and it will connect 
to and talk on their network without having to make ANY changes.

Ditto if I want to take a desktop system somewhere for troubleshooting.

Subject: [PLUG] Crash notices when programs don't crash
Message-ID: <526568FE.8030508@dicksteffens.com>

I've been using two programs with Ubuntu 12.04 the last few days. Before 
last week I was unable to get them working on 12.04 and had to use a 
second machine running 10.04 to run them while running Libre Office on 
the 12.04 machine. These are the tools I use when transcribing an audio 
file, the Python programs Transcribe and Footpedal.

They appear to work fine for the most part, but once in awhile I get a 
pop up window claiming that one or the other of them has crashed. I 
close that window by clicking on the button that says something to the 
effect of "leave closed." The programs are still running, though. I have 
had the problem of the footpedal program quitting in the middle of a 
session on two occasions. I simply stop the playback using the mouse on 
a button on the transcribe program. Then I double check to make sure 
footpedal has stopped by opening a terminal and running:

ps ax | grep footpedal

On these occasions the programmed had indeed stopped running. I just 
restart it and pick up from where I left off. (The reason I have to 
check is that there is no visible indication that the program is 
running. There is the obvious indication that the machine isn't 
responding to the physical foot pedal, of course.)

As for the transcribe program, I do the same thing, where I close the 
alert window with the "leave closed" button. There is a window open for 
that program, so I can see that it is still running.

So, today's question: While this is a minor annoyance, is it something I 
should be more concerned about? I could report the incident to the 
maintainer of the transcribe program, but it appears that the footpedal 
program has been abandoned.

When situations like this occur, I run the program from the command
line (terminal) that way you can get a better picture of errors for
apps that send error messages to stdout and not /var/log/messages.

It could be as simple as a lib version mismatch.

You'll need root access to /etc/resolv.conf (or sudo) which is a bad
idea. Better to set up wicd or networkmanager profiles which each
stores in $HOME. No need to access resolv.conf at all. Both can also
toggle not only between wifi APs but also between wifi and wired.

IIRC, you're on slackware. Just set rc.networkmanager to execute,
create a rc.iptables scrips (rworkman or Alien Bob have a nifty
generator) and you are golden.

Ed,

   Will do! I'll need to read all about it but this looks like the ideal
solution.

Ambitious and a good summary. But he didn't cover KDE, Gnome, Xfce,
and LXDE because those are Desktop Environments (DE) which you pretty
much need to live with for a few weeks before you can pass judgment.

Also, the WM is only 1/2 of the story. You still need a bunch of
utilities to essentially make a DE. Here's the Linux fun part: you can
take any DE and swap out its default WM for one of these. Freaky!

Subject: [PLUG] I killed my desktop
Message-ID: <20131024005501.0b41fe5d@Devil8>

My desktop computer is used only for streaming internet radio, playing
movies, and as a backup to get on the net in case I hopelessly mess up
my laptop. It ran Ubuntu 10.04 for years, long after 12.04 came out,
but eventually it got too far out of date so I installed Xubuntu 12.04.
Due to issues with the video driver that came with 12.04, I wiped it
out and installed Mint. But Mint has issues playing videos (slow, jerky
video). So this evening I decided to try Xubuntu again.

The first thing I discovered is that I can't get the ASUS M2NPV-VM BIOS
to boot to a USB stick. So I burned a DVD on my laptop and installed
from that. However, no matter what I try, it won't boot after the
install. This is curious because several months ago when I installed
12.04 it booted and ran fine (except for the video driver issues). That
was version 12.04 and now I am trying to install 12.04.3.

The computer has two 320 GB Seagate drives (SDA and SDB), originally
matching, but one failed and Seagate replaced it with a refurbished
unit. It also as a 1 TB drive, but I don't want to touch it because I
used it to store ~/ on, intending to copy it back to ~/ after the fresh
install of Xubuntu. I started by installing to SDA setting up a 20 GB
partition for root, a 6 GB partition for swap, and the remainder for
home. It goes all the way through the install process without error,
but when it finishes and I reboot, it comes up in rescue mode.

Thinking that there might be a problem with SDA I repeated the install
to SDB, but got the same results. I also tried telling the installer to
apply all updates during the install, but it made no difference. 

The computer has 2 GB RAM and video is nVidia GeForce 6150 on the
motherboard.

The motherboard has 4 SATA connectors. In the BIOS it sees the two 320
GB drives, but not the 1 TB drive. I don't understand that, because a
few hours ago with Mint it saw the 1 TB drive just fine.

It is way past my bedtime, I am out of ideas, disgusted, and I will not
have music in my house tomorrow. I hope someone has some ideas.

I should have added that when I boot I get:

error: no such partition
grub rescue>

But I am unable to figure out how to use grub rescue. I tried help and
other obvious commands, but all I get is error messages.

Probably the grub that is giving you the error message is the grub
from the previous installation and it is looking in the wrong place
for the boot partition.

In the installation process did it ask you which disks/partitions  to
install grub on? The surest way to make it boot correctly is to
install it on all disks.

You could try  Boot-Repair and see if that fixes the problem.

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair

Or you could re-install and check that the grub installation goes correctly.

my first guess is that the installer installed GRUB onto one drive, but the
BIOS is attempting to boot the other drive. you could try swapping the
cables going to them, or unplugging them one at a time til it boots (or
doesn't). I agree that it should have worked once you repeated the
installation to the other drive.

I have no idea why the 1TB doesn't show up in BIOS, but I'd unplug its
cable too, just in case.

this way you can at least narrow down the problem.

That was my guess also, so I swapped the cables, but it still gave me
the error message. I finally got it to install without issue by
unplugging both the 1 TB drive and the second 320 GB drive. 

It appears to be running fine, but the hard drive light is on
constantly - not just flickering, but solid. If I shut down it finally
goes out, and when I restart the light flickers a bit during the boot
process, and then stays on continuously. Yet I hear no disk activity.
Using the GUI Task Manager I see nothing that might be causing this.

Palimpsest says the 320 GB drive that is in use is 6 years old (can it
be that long since I built this computer?) and that it has "a few bad
sectors." Looking at the Smart data the Current Pending Sector Count is
in red and it says "Number of sectors waiting to be remapped." I assume
this is the cause of the disk light being on constantly. The Smart data
says it will not be remapped until there is a failed write attempt. 

>I have no idea why the 1TB doesn't show up in BIOS, but I'd unplug its

This is very strange. Hard drives do fail, but for it to be working
fine and fail completely just when I installed Xubuntu would be a
colossal coincidence. But it does not show up even in the BIOS. I can't
grasp how Xubuntu could have caused that. 

Now that I have Xubuntu installed and working I tried shutting the
computer down and plugging the other two drives in, then rebooting.
First I plugged in the 1 TB drive, but it still did not appear in the
BIOS and, of course, Xubuntu does not see it. Then I plugged in the
other 320 GB drive, which the BIOS does see, but Xubuntu can't see this
drive either. The 1 TB drive is formatted ext4, used only for data
storage. I believe the other 320 GB drive may be unformatted. Yet
Palimpsest does not see it either. 

There is one other oddity that was a problem with Mint and previous
installations of Xubuntu 12.04 as well, that is, if there is a USB stick
inserted during boot I will get an error message that the USB stick has
no operating system. The boot order in the BIOS is set to 1) Removable,
2) CD/DVD, 3) Hard Disk, and 4) Hard Disk. I thought that this means
the BIOS should look for an OS on each of those devices in the above
order, and if it does not find an OS, to move on to the next device.
It's not moving on to the next device. I can't find anything in the
BIOS to change this behavior. 

Well, at least I have music again.

Howdy,

I'm currently seeking suggestions on reliable places that can open, repair,
and cleanly close up a Thinkpad T61 for a reasonable price. Doesn't have to be
the cheapest, and I want a quality work.

My T61 laptop has had wobbly hinges for a long time now, a known condition,
and now one of them has decided to become impertinent and I can't close the
lid any longer. I'm still trying to decide on opening the case myself or
hiring it out for a professional to do, but I need pricing before I can
completely decide on how to proceed.

Recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Portland metro is the market,
preferably in the SW, NW, or downtown areas, but all metro businesses will be
considered.

Cheers,

dafr

i've had good experience with Pacific Solutions on SE Powell. They had to
scour eBay to find the ribbon cable for the display in my wife's old
no-name laptop after it wore out from a decade of opening/closing, did a
good job for a reasonable rate.

Dafr:
I had a screen replace laptop repair at a place on Allen Blvd. in 
Beaverton, between Lombard and Hall Blvd. cross streets. One repair is 
not a lot of experience, but I was happy. He gave me and price estimate 
and completion time and it all came true. The name of the place escapes 
me, but if you are interested, I'll get you the name and phone number.

Subject: [PLUG] question on lock-free queuing structures
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHcieUMF7bvZCBxojEke6v80eAup961=_HWYq_4ddW3dfQ@mail.gmail.com>

Has anyone had experience building a multiple producer, single
consumer lock-free circular queue in C or C++?

I am not worried about the consumer thread, it just moves along the
circular queue until the head and tail pointers match then idles until
it sees a change.

My concern is some type of atomic write operation to the queue head
and tail pointers from one producer, to block any other producers from
writing to the same item, but to insure that all producers are able to
write out successfully onto the queue.

If you have had experience with building circular queues in C or C++ I
would like to correspond with you.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <CAJeYwHejaQ2tQWw3tVg5f3peP75gs==xzEAeXPSrGMmitSDj2g@mail.gmail.com>

Okay, I think I found a safe answer for multiple producers
incrementing in the ring buffer.

Each producer will do a type __sync_fetch_and_add (type *ptr, type
value) operation which is guaranteed to be atomic and thus thread
safe, on multiple core machines sharing a common memory.  The fetch
operation will return the current value of the variable and then
increment it atomically.

Thus a safely incrementing modulo counter to the ring buffer is
maintained and my problem is solved.

Update:

I have Xubuntu installed and working fine on one of the 320 GB drives.
In the process I also tried installing it on the other drive. If both
drives are plugged in during boot there is no way to get Xubuntu to
boot; it gets hopelessly confused and I get the Grub menu.
Unfortunately, the drives are identical except for serial number, and
Grub just assigned uuid numbers to both, without bothering to tell me
which uuid is assigned to which drive. In sum, the only way to boot is
to leave one of the 320 GB drives not plugged in. After doing that, and
using Rescue Mode to update Grub, it now boots fine from one drive, and
I have fixed that installation the way I want it. 

I also discovered that I can hot-plug the other 320 GB drive. With
Xubuntu running I can just reach into the case and plug the other 320 G
drive in. Xubuntu automatically mounts it and presents a file browser
window for it. I find this amazing. Of course you can hot-plug USB
drives, but I am surprised that you can do it with internal drives as
well. But note that the power cable was always connected; all I pulled
during boot and plugged in after booting was the data cable.

Having discovered this I used Palimpsest to remove the partitions from
the hot-plugged 320 GB drive, and then formatted it as one partition
ext4 for data storage. Now I should be able to leave it plugged in
during boot and Xubuntu should not get confused.

Having discovered that I could hot-plug the other 320 GB drive I tried
it with the 1 TB drive. But the result was not what I hoped for. The
disk light came on and stayed on continuously and Xubuntu did not
mount the drive. I don't know what this means, and since the drive is
not visible to Xubuntu, or even the BIOS, there is no way to do
diagnostics on it. The only thing I can think of to try is to install
it in another desktop computer with SATA ports to see if it is
recognized. 

And when I pulled the 1 TB drive out of the case I discovered that the
label says it is a Seagate Barracuda 7200.12 and that it is a
"Certified Repaired HDD." That is because the original failed and
Seagate replaced it under warranty. If this drive has failed also that
makes the fourth Seagate drive that I have had fail within the last
couple of years, and it also assures Seagate a top position on my
"Do Not Buy" list.

I have the same laptop, with the same dodgy hinges.  I've been
planning on fixing it myself, but haven't bought any replacement parts
yet.  Disassembling the laptop is tedious, but not particularly
difficult.  Lenovo offers a service guide for free download that is
helpful.  (Search for "T61 hardware maintenance manual".)

If you're interested in making a group project out of it, we could get
together and repair our respective laptops side-by-side.  Perhaps in
conjunction with one of the monthly PLUG clinics?  Are there any other
PLUGgers out there with Thinkpads in disrepair?

I have a T61, and it is always with me at the Clinic. However, its
hinges are fine, although the SD card reader is kaput. I haven't
bothered trying to fix it because I just got an external USB reader for
a couple bucks.

Download and install the "iotop" package.  You'll have to run it as
root, but it should tell you what process is hogging the drive.  The
drive is probably bad, but it doesn't hurt to check.

Anyway, hope this helps.

I installed iotop, but it didn't show any disk activity at all for
anything but the two 320 GB drives. I suspect that is because the drive
is not recognized, even in the BIOS. The drive doesn't exist.

I installed smartmontoools, and the GUI for it. gsmartcntl. The drive
does not appear in the BIOS, so neither does it appear to
smartmontools. 

However I did use it to check the two 320 GB drives, which it reported
as "healthy." It appears that the data available under the Smart tab in
Palimpsest is much more complete. 

I had removed the 1 TB drive, so before trying smatmontools and iotools
(thanks, Dale) I plugged it back in. As soon as I plugged in the power
cable it made clicking noises for a minute or so. I assume this means
the head is seeking, and failing  to find whatever it is looking for.

Monday I will call Seagate to see if they will still honor the
warranty, considering that it is a refurbished drive that Seagate
sent me to replace the original that also failed. If they will honor
the warranty they will require that I run their diagnostics utility,
which only runs on Windows. I don't have a Windows computer.

I also looked around for replacement drives. Almost half the drives on
the market are Seagate, with Western Digital offering almost as many.
Western Digital also requires their proprietary diagnostic tool, which
also runs only on Windows. There aren't a lot of other brands to choose
from. Newegg offers a few, but Enu and Fry's have only Seagate and
Western Digital.

I'm pretty sure Seatools
(http://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/item/seatools-dos-master/)
is a bootable CD image that does not require Windows.

I would be glad to help at the next clinic.  Laptop repair is much
easier when there is more than one machine open, and there are
other machines to refer to.  Finding others in the community with
wonky T61s would be good, too;  a Meetup announced on Caligator in
advance of the clinic would attact others, and give everyone a chance
to order parts and prepare (and not get in bidding wars with each
other on eBay).  I will be out of town the second week of November,
but could participate before then (that is, Real Soon Now).

I have been in and out of T60s (not T61s) a LOT, and the machines are
probably very much alike in layout.  Indeed, having a 15 inch 4x3
screen, I went crazy, replacing it with a 2048x1536 prototype screen,
different screen connection cable, higher power backlight inverter,
and reprogramming the EDID code so the Thinkpad BIOS recognizes the
new screen.

Replacing the hinges involves both the screen and the chassis.  If
the T61 is like the T60, that involves pulling the keyboard and all
the bezel plastic.  Look around for new hinges;  ACSparts sometimes
has items like that. 

Sometimes you can find a screensmashed laptop really cheap on
eBay; good for spare parts.  If someone has connections at Free
Geek, they could accumulate a months supply of unrepairable T61s
for us to raid for parts.  In return, we can invite some of their
grant clients with T61s.

While you are inside the machine,  you will want to replace the
AC adapter socket and the BIOS battery.  Depending on how the T61
differs from the T60, the battery is dead simple and the AC adapter
socket may require major disassembly; nevertheless, the socket is
of the first things to go.  Given the Lenovo FRU, you can find new
sockets with pigtail cables for about $5 on eBay.  

If you are obsessive and want to restore the little plastic stick-on
screw covers, look for those too.  A few will get their stickum
displaced too much to re-use.

You will want a small Phillios jewelers screwdriver ( size 00).
A shallow compartment plastic tray for storing the screws would
help.  Michaels or a bead store might have something.  Screws tend
to get lost; ordering extras might help.

This is also a good time to upgrade RAM if you want more.  Check

                  thinkwiki.org

for hacker info on how much RAM your linux distro can support;
often more than Windoze permits.  Many other items can be replaced
or upgraded;  if your screen is dim, new backlight inverters are
available, even new screens.  If you are really obsessed, you can
replace the CPU with the fastest that fits the socket; however,
if both cores are running flat out, you can heat the machine into
thermal shutdown. 

The main thing is preparation.  Download the hardware maintenance
manual and read through the disassembly/reassembly stuff.  80% of
the manual is lists of all the different hardware options, and
there are many changes over the manufacturing life of a thinkpad.
Almost none of that matters for what we will work on.  Order the
parts in advance; we won't find any near Free Geek on a Sunday
afternoon.

Most folks are afraid of opening their hardware, or disinterested.
I think it is the only healthy way to own technology, rather than
having techmology own you.  Real Hackers void warranties.

BTW - I would prefer to concentrate on T61s that Clinic Sunday,
for folks that are prepared, and set aside other Sundays for other
models.  Like all clinics, we will have plenty of people with
other problems, and I don't have the brainpower to help with
T61s, and help those other people, AND deal with whatever random
laptop walks in the door.  This will take time, and I don't want
to rush, or send folks home with a box of unassembled parts.

Preparation is important, and finding service documents and
replacement parts for non-Lenovo machines will take time. 
If you want to repair a Dell or an HP, we can have fun doing
that together, but we will want to learn how, beforehand.

Lets do one thing with excellence.  

Keith

P.S., John J: I bet a cookie that the SD card reader on your
T61 has a similar problem to your machine we fixed last month.
Perhaps your cat chases mice in there, which bends the
contacts. :-)  We can open your machine and take a look.

You may be right. However, even when brand new I could never get any
Linux distro to mount it writable. Best I could do was read-only. (Yes,
the switch was in the right position.) I only wanted it writable so that
I could transfer 30+ GB of mp3s to the card that I use in my phone.
Eventually I gave up and plugged the phone into a USB port on the T61.
It was slow, but I only ever needed to do it once. 

It was when I started CPAP that I discovered that it had become
completely broken and wouldn't even read SD cards. So I spent the grand
sum of $2 with free shipping for an external reader that has been
working fine ever since. Some things aren't worth the trouble to fix
them.

I could go for this myself, but it depends on obtaining parts. I'm 
trying to be a bit finicky to get quality hinges at this point. If I can 
get the parts quick enough, I may jump ahead and do the work on my own, 
but if something is set up, I can share my knowledge and experience at a 
meetup.

Yeah, this will be pretty much a complete dis-assembly. I had already 
found a manual for a different version of the T61 and seen that. The 
correct manual isn't any more descriptive, but I'm relatively handy with 
this kind of thing. I just lack some of the tools, but it appears to be 
cheaper to buy what I need instead of farming the work out to a third party.

Interesting idea that I hadn't considered... I appreciate that logic.

Preparation is a good way to stay out of jams most of the time for most 
things, but here especially so. I don't have a lot of experience with 
opening up laptops, but always up for a challenge.

Seagate's web based warranty validator said it could not determine if
the drive was under warranty, so today I called Seagate. They confirmed
that the warranty expired last January. 

Since it is not detected in the BIOS there is nothing that can be done
via repair and recovery tools. I have all kinds of bootable disk repair
CDs, but they are all useless here. The only hope is to install it in
another desktop computer with a SATA port, or in an external SATA
enclosure and connect it to any computer via USB. If it still cannot be
seen, then it is truly history. I have neither a SATA enclosure nor any
other desktop computers, so I'll save this for the next Clinic. It's a
long shot anyway.

In the meantime I'm shopping for a replacement. Does anyone have any
good or bad things to say about 3 TB SATA-3 drives, excluding Seagate?

Subject: [PLUG] Can I use a 3 TB internal drive?
Message-ID: <20131028143953.25b792b2@Devil8>

My desktop computer has a five-year old ASUS motherboard with four
SATA-2 ports. I am considering adding a 3 TB SATA-3 drive. My choice of
SATA-3 is only for future; my current motherboard only has SATA-2. In
shopping I found this on a page from Enu:

Motherboard with UEFI BIOS or compatible controller card and compatible
OS needed for drives greater than 2.2TB

Never mind. I found this on Seagate's web site:

Linux kernel version v2.6.35 or newer is known to support >2TiB disk
drives.

And I have 3.2.0 on Xubuntu 12.04.

Some (many?) larger, newer drives can't be used as boot devices on

off of something else, you should be okay, I think.

I've got a couple 3TB drives waiting to get plugged into a file server
which came with that warning.

Keep in mind that any given repair shop - and that includes the
third party :-( company that Lenovo outsources their laptop
repair to - will have the same access to parts that you do.

"XYZ Laptop Repair And Muffler Shop" will find their parts
from junkers, ebay, etc.  No guarantee of top quality unless
you buy the parts yourself.  Look around the net - if T61 
hinges are a common problem, there will be an aftermarket
third party source, just like there is for specialized screen
flex cables, AC adapter sockets, screw hole covers, etc.

Message-ID: <20131030150513.6b61a26e@Devil8>

I have ordered an HDHomerun to add TV functionality to my Xubuntu
desktop. I will want to watch only over the air broadcasts. According
to tvfool.com (a website that I learned about at the last Clinic) there
are roughly 20 stations approximately 4 miles SSW of my house (about
220 degrees) and the weakest has a power of -47.5 dBm. I assume that
means that I probably don't need cutting edge antenna technology,
however, it would be most convenient to have it indoors and downstairs
in the middle of the house, although putting it in the attic wouldn't
be tremendously difficult.

There are a bewildering number of indoor TV antennas on the market. I
could use some suggestions and advice from real world users - not only
as to makes and models, but also as to how it should be oriented. All I
know about RF is that it is tricky and unpredictable.

There's also http://antennaweb.org

I would suggest that you make sure you can return anything you get. You may 
find yourself going through the same drawn-out procedure I did.

I am literally 4.5 miles west of towers. They are easily visible from my yard, 
but there are random trees between them and myself.

I started out trying various indoor antennas, with terrible results. Then I 
tried amplified indoor antennas with no real change. I tried amplified "indoor/
outdoor" antennas. Then I moved them out to the garage attic space. I went to 
Radio Shack and bought an external directional antenna and a chimney mount. 
That almost worked. Being on the roof I now had a considerable run of coax, 
so I bought a pole-mount preamp and a power injector. That was much better. 
Then I realized that the antennas they typically sell are UHF only (most 
stations migrated to UHF frequencies with the switch), but a couple of 
Portland stations are still VHF, so I bought a decent sized VHF/UHF antenna, 
specifically
  http://www.solidsignal.com/pview.asp?mc=03&p=HD7694P
(note this is claiming a range of 35 miles).

I now get almost perfect signal on every local station except channel 12. It 
turns out that most of the local stations broadcast at 45KW, with a couple at 
1000KW (1MW), but channel 12 only broadcasts at 25KW. I don't know what their 
radiation pattern looks like, but I assume they're configured to send most of 
that east over Portland instead of purely omni-directional over the entire 
metro area. Even with a roof-mounted directional antenna with a pole-mounted 
pre-amp I still can't reliably get channel 12, and I'm about to upgrade to 
something like this:
 http://www.solidsignal.com/pview.asp?p=cm-5646

Remember, I'm 4.5 miles line-of-sight from the towers. :-(

The frustrating thing is my Sony TV tuner can handle most of the issues with 
channel 12, but my two HDHomeRun units have fits with the signal (I have a 
1-to-4 splitter connecting the TV and 3 HDHomeRun cables).

After you work through your indoor options drop me a line, I may still have the 
HD7694 laying around.

I suspect I'll need to follow John M's advice later on, but to get 
started I went to Radio Shack and got a simple dipole, the kind of 
antenna that's made from 300 ohm twinlead. I connected that to a 300/75 
ohm balun and plugged that into my HDHomeRun. Before the clinic I got 
channel 10 easily. At the clinic and after I got home I didn't get 
channel 10 easily. I found another dipole hooked up to a stereo tuner I 
don't use anymore, and when I get time I'll give that a try to see if it 
makes any difference. But, it's possible that a simple dipole might work 
for you. It's cheap enough to be worth a try.

Subject: [PLUG] chasing a kernel memory leak
Message-ID: <86ppqmqns3.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I have been seeing a kernel memory leak (or what looks a hell of a lot
like one) on recently openwrt (as of 6+ months ago).  It seems to be
triggered running a particular shell script, though I'm having trouble
narrowing it down because of its heisenbug properties, and also
because it's fairly slow and you can only really see it over intervals
of several hours.

One of the things I am having trouble with is figuring out where the
memory is going with /proc/meminfo.  It is not clear what components
should be added to get the MemTotal.  My attempts so far aren't adding
up (that is, I get something a non-zero remainder).  E.g.:

  awk '$1 ~ /MemTotal/ { sum += $2 ; print $0 } 
       $1 ~ /MemFree|Buffers|Cached|AnonPages|Slab|Mapped|Shmem|KernelStack|PageTables/ { sum -= $2 ; print $0 } 
       END { print sum }'

I've asked on the linux-mm irc channel, with deafening crickets as
response.  Google has been unhelpful on memory accounting, mostly just
pointing me at newbie questions/answers about "where did all my memory
go?!" (when it is just eaten by recoverable cache and buffers) which
is not my problem.  Also, kmemleak is not helping.

Does anyone have practical advice on kernel memory accounting? 

TIA.

Subject: [PLUG] DOCSIS 3.0 modems
Message-ID: <20131030182436.3376ba63@Devil8>

Several months ago Comcast announced to me that they had massively
increased my internet speeds. OK, that was hyperbole, but there was
some recent speed increase. I am not hurting, as I regularly get in
excess of 3 MB/s down and 600 KB/s up, but this is America, so more is
always better, right? 

However, there was a footnote in small print. It seems that to take
advantage of the latest Comcast bounty I need a DOCSIS 3.0 modem. A
quick check revealed that my current modem is a pathetic DOCSIS 2.0
modem. I'm not sure what to do. Google, Amazon and others provide a
long list of DOCSIS 3.0 modems, but I can find little information about
which is the best. The same manufacturer often lists several DOCSIS 3.0
modems, with ever escalating prices, with promises of ever greater
speed as the price goes up. Isn't DOCSIS 3.0 the same regardless of the
device? Other than possible construction quality, why pay extra for a
modem as long as it is DOCSIS 3.0?

Observations, experience, insights and suggestions welcome.

I would start with the list of modems that Comcast has certified.
They could even rent you a new modem with the new wireless AC standard.

I am ashamed of all of you! You run Linux but have no sense of
adventure. Build your own antenna!! No doubt you have a few scraps of
copper wire (or metal clothes hangers) etc laying around. This project
will also allow you to experiment with the design for optimal
reception in you area.

I am 11-13 miles from PDX towers, on the Vancouver side.  I can pick
up ALL PDX channels crystal clear with this two designs:
