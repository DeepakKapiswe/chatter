I think what you are looking for is build-essential.

Well,,

I installed make

Then libc6  and it  "complained"

Had one already and didn't like the new one..

And the other programs don't like the old one...

If I had my dial-up working I would just up-grade up-date.

But, No...

hehe

Linux-yug

PS..

I have a copy of Mandriva 2009 

Maybe I will just install that??

I have a similar problem with a 4V the one that lets me
print up to 11 x 17 paper. Could be a great use for SBC
as both a print spooler and PS->PCL translator.

pete/Keith:

   I wonder if this is why my LJ5 can no longer print from the command line
using lpr. I can print from applications such as gv, xpdf, acroread but not
directly.

   Bought this printer in '97 and added more RAM, a PS module, and a
duplexer. It's a great workhorse of a printer.

The LJ5 can also use the PCL and foomatic drivers. In fact, I don't
know of any HP printer that cannot use PCL drivers. As far as I know,
HP created the PCL drivers in order to avoid having to pay Adobe,
Xionics or others license fees for PostScript. Thus, if it's an HP
printer, it has PCL capability. The only issue is determining which
version of PCL it has, but printing a native configuration sheet (from
the printer control panel) should tell you what drivers are installed.
Some printers can also have their drivers updated over the internet.

I have a 4Plus (PostScript added so it is really a 4MPlus, a 5SiMx,
several 8000DNs, and Xerox Phaser 8400DN. I can print via command line
to any of them with PostScript or PCL drivers, although I always print
from the application. The Phaser also has the new Adobe PDF print
engine, so I can send a PDF file directly from the command line rather
than from Adobe Reader, Okular, Evince or other PDF reader.

A number of smaller HP laser printers use "host-based" schemes, and
don't support PCL. Here's a few from the OpenPrinting database, by
driver:

foo2hp:
HP Color LaserJet 1600
HP Color LaserJet 2600n
HP Color LaserJet CP1215

foo2zjs:
HP LaserJet 1000
HP LaserJet 1005
HP LaserJet 1018
HP LaserJet 1020
HP LaserJet 1022

foo2oak:
HP Color LaserJet 1500

foo2xqx:
HP LaserJet M1005 MFP
HP LaserJet M1120 MFP
HP LaserJet P1005
HP LaserJet P1006
HP LaserJet P1007
HP LaserJet P1008

I've come into possession of a Linksys WRT150N, which appears to be 
compatible with OpenWRT and DD-WRT -- and perhaps others (I haven't 
done a full search yet).

Do those of you who have worked with Linux-based WRT firmware strongly 
prefer one distribution over the others? What features does it offer 
that make it more appealing for you?

I haven't played with OpenWRT so I can't give you the side by side
comparison.

I can tell you I've been super happy with dd-wrt.  Fairly active community
and good documentation on the site.

The web interface control panel is pretty robust.  I was able to setup a
captive portal for the gallery lickity split.

I prefer the openness of the OpenWrt development and the massive
selection of packages, though I have very limited experience with
ddwrt.  I spend a lot of time working on OpenWrt, sort of an edge
developer.  Using, build-testing, minor bug fixing.

If you are doing "standard" things and need or want a pretty
interface, ddwrt is probably going to do fine for you.  I personally
don't like ddwrt's "activation" meme.  To me, it violates the spirit
of FOSS even if it is waved or easy to evade.

OpenWrt runs on practically everything (that linux can run on and that
has >=4M of flash), you can easily check it out and compile it
yourself.  To me, it is extremely flexible and has good developer
support.  There is a pretty web interface called luci, though I don't
use that either, so I can't characterize it.

I like the web interface of DD-WRT. You can still SSH into it and I 
think OpenWRT is more for the cmd line types. I think the activation 
thing Russel is talking about is only for the x86 release. I've never 
had that on any of my routers.

It is easy to evade the activation thing, but the mere existance puts
me off.  Also, you have to look hard to find SVN access to the ddwrt
code base.  It isn't linked from the ddwrt website that i could find
(Google will find a Trac interface).  You can get x86 support or a
bunch of others with OpenWrt without even the suggestion of a
donation, much less a license fee.  In short, OpenWrt feels a lot more
FOSSy to me than ddwrt.

BTW, there is another one called Tomato that I've heard good things
about but never used.  You might want to take a look at that also.

I have used openwrt and tomato. Openwrt is much like debian with a lot
 of useful packages and
an apt get type package management. It is also actively developed and
constantly improving.
Tomato on the other hand has the better designed interface. The
openwrt interface, luci,
often leaves you hunting around trying to figure our where things are
configured. But of course
with both of them you can ssh in and control things from the command
line. Really you can't go
wrong with either one.

Thanks for all the suggestions and feedback. I'm hoping to flash and

child rearing, housework, and band practice are higher on the priority 
list. :-)

I haven't tried it yet, but there is now a version of the Xwrt web 
interface that supports Kamikaze.   I've used Xwrt for White Russian a 
fair bit, and it works pretty well.

I just completed an in place upgrade to Kubuntu Jaunty Jackalope on my T42 laptop.

No issues found yet.
Window widgets are much improved - Firefox display of scrollbars and other X stuff works properly again. 

If you've been considering my experience indicates going ahead is fine.

The RAID snafu I mentioned in an earlier post made Ubuntu pretty much a 
non-starter for me. Unless I can find a way around it, I'm going to 
abandon, and go back to Fedora, when 11 comes out later this month.

Message-ID: <ae2db4620905031317r2a8c5baah61de967d64bfd4ce@mail.gmail.com>

hey folks,

does anyone have a favorite web service or application that runs on
linux that has the ability to pull a single RSS feed in near-realtime
and search for terms in it?  my bike got stolen and i'm watching
craigslist using google alerts, which does what i want...but at a
glacial pace.  i posted a message that i knew would tickle my filter
and it took 13 hours for google to tell me, despite me setting the
polling frequency to "as it happens" (as opposed to daily, the next
higher option), so while i like the functionality, there's a fair
chance the posting will appear and disappear before google notices to
tell me.

anyhow, i'd like to pull the feed say every 5 minutes and grep for
stuff.  i could just roll one with netcat and grep, literally, but am
wondering if there's a snazzy option already designed/debugged that i
can leverage.

thanks for your advice!

I did a fresh Jaunty install on my Dell D620 laptop, and have been very
pleased with it. After hearing that the boot speed has been improved, I
benchmarked my boot time before and after (before I was running Hardy,
btw), and it went from 57s to 40s.

With every previous release I've had to modify acpi settings to get
suspend to RAM to work consistently, but this time it's working
flawlessly without any changes.

I'm going to give it about a month before upgrading my desktop machine.
I generally do that as it gives some time for the most common problems
to be reported and resolved on ubuntuforums.com.

I have no intention to experiment with ext4 yet but look forward to its
inclusion by default in the next release (reportedly).

The orange wall at roots will not be a problem this month, if I
remember to bring my screen.  A problem that Roots shares with
Lucky Lab NW is that the windows are south-west facing, and the
room will be lit up in the summer evening.  My screen is only
5 foot, so people will need to be a bit closer to read it
compared to the 8 foot screen at Jax (and a 10 foot at LLNW,
I believe).  Perhaps the higher light density on the 5 foot
screen will make it more readable in the early evening light.

The staff at LLNW implied that the place really fills up in the
summer time, so it is probably not a good long-term option for
Advanced Topics.  I would like to keep using LLNW for the 
general meeting afters, if most of you agree.

I think liferea will do what you need.  I use it to scan employment 
feeds, including craigslist, and I can set up any of several filters 
looking for keywords if the feed itself can't be tuned (like 
craigslist).  It can scan for new items as frequently as once per 
minute, and it can pop up a notification when new items arrive (though 
for everything, not just filtered items).

The only problem I had with the dist-upgrade from Intrepid to Jaunty
was an error in the script that failed to do everything. I had no Gnome
panel and no Metacity. But having fixed those things everything else is
working pretty much OK. In my case it was just the install script - the
components themselves are working fine.

As for boot time, I don't see a big difference. I do note that the the
progress bar finishes faster, but the rest of the boot process now
takes longer. I think they just made the progress bar stop sooner to
make it look like it was booting faster.

There are a number of complaints that it does not shut down completely.
I have that issue as well, although I suspect that the problem is yet
another thing that the install script failed to handle properly. One of
these days I'll figure out what it is and fix it. Meantime I have this
big power button on the computer. The computer gets electricity at my
sufferance.

There is one complaint I have. I already had the PPA version of OOo
3.0.1 installed on Intrepid, and it worked fine, not counting the
documented bugs. The dist-upgrade installed the GO version. Now the
Save button is always active, where before it would be grayed out after
a save until a change was made. Apparently it was Novell that insisted
on this for the GO version in order to make it act like Excel. Bah.

What you are describing is FineToothCog which was built by Michael Jones in
2006 and hosted in partnership with BikePortland.org.

Sadly it is no more.  It ran for a couple years and then MJ got busy with
real work.

This perl script might be helpful as a starting point for what you'd like to
do...
http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001440.html

On occasion I've thought to either get the code from MJ (he's a friend) or
build it anew to provide this valuable service to our town.  Let me know if
you're interested in hacking on such and maybe we can host a code sprint at
the gallery.

Just to follow up on this thread. In the interest of minimizing my 
time commitment to this project (putting Linux firmware on an Linksys 
WRT150N), I decided to go with DD-WRT.

Someone mentioned an activation or registration process, but I haven't 
seen anything like that from my installation of DD-WRT.

The firmware upgrade was very smooth. The web interface is 
full-featured enough that I was able to get things setup within a 
couple hours.

As I have time, I'd like to figure out how to manage most thing via 
CLI, rather than using the web interface, but for now I'm a happy 
customer. I like being able to ssh into my router. I also like being 
able to poll it via SNMP.

As I have time, I'll probably end up moving some services from a 
server at home to the Linksys: OpenVPN, DNS, DHCP.

Thanks again for all the suggestions and feedback!

I have been running Jaunty since Alpha 2.  I have had the shutdown

Keith and all,

I guess this sort of answers the question I posted in my latest posting.
I should read my mail before writing.

I take it that most people are happy going to
The Lucky Lab - Northwest at 1945 NW Quimby in Portland for
"the Meeting after the General Meeting".

It's OK with me. 

I loved Jax because it was right next to the Max. And Roots is also
awesome for me because a bus stops right out in front that will take me
within 15 blocks of my house. My only complaint about the NW Lucky Lab
is that it takes longer to get to the Max. But last time someone gave
me a ride to the Max line, so it may not really be an issue. Someone is
always leaving.

Good.

It truly is a shame that Jax had to close, but that is life in a
capitalist society - especially
one in a deep recession.

The user agent switcher extension will let you masquerade as different
browsers.

Firefox has been my main browser for the past four years, and I don't
remember ever seeing that feature.

Before Firefox I used Opera on Windows, and it definitely had the
ability to spoof its identity. It didn't always work because apparently
there are ways that web sites can be coded to poke deep enough to find
out that the visitor is really using Opera. Maybe it's Opera you are
thinking of. And if not, maybe you should consider Opera anyway.

Carlos,

   I would include in preamble \usepackage{geometry} and include
specifications for \paperwidth and \paperheight. You might also need the
layout package.

  Other than for PSTricks (which I write using emacs) I use LyX for my
writing and it has a "custom" page size option that I've used to specify
page size of 6"x9" so there should be no issue with specifying 11"x17".

   "Guide to LaTeX, 4th Ed." and "The LaTeX Companion, 2nd Ed." are the
resources to use.

Rich

As mentioned firefox does have the capability of spoofing other OS's and 
browsers however you have to install it (it's not there by default). 
Just do a search for 'firefox user agent switcher' and you should find it.

I have a slight preference for the bento that the Lucky Lab on Hawthorne 
serves, it is not available at the LLNW, but if anyone would rather go 
LLNW, I would gladly yield. I prefer either Lucky Lab to Roots.

On the other hand, they have pizza at LLNW.  But I like the bento
too.  I think the decider is that first thursdays at the SE location
are swamped with game-night peoples.  Better chance to find a place to

Subject: [PLUG] recommended ipod-interacting software for linux?
Message-ID: <861vr4xhjc.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I fell heir to a 30GB video ipod a few months ago, and have just
started playing with it.  I did a reset from Windows XP and itunes,
but I usually don't have XP around and obviously prefer Linux.

iTunes is being a bitch about not letting me just copy stuff to the
ipod, also.  It wants me to keep a copy on the PC side (and i'm more
space constrained on XP than I am on the ipod).  

What linux software do people like and why?

I have the responsibility to maintain a kernel for a product we are building.
I would like to use git to allow me to pull code in from kernel.org
without having to
search for patches.

I have two issues that seem to be at odds of doing what I want.
1) I started with a tarball not a git clone.
2) I have to maintain a checked in version of source code in Clearcase

As anyone has some experience in dealing with a situation like this?
Recommendation other than chucking Clearcase?

I highly recommend Amarok.  It "just works" and it integrates with
some music suggestion web services.  It's also very well polished, and
it's consistently been more stable than the other offerings I've found
(such as rhythmbox, or some one-off apps that just shove music onto an
ipod).

In all respects, it's worked very well for me.  You can even control
it remotely from a command line, if you want (so you can script it
trivially--say if you want to use cron as an alarm clock).

If you don't want to go the full music software route with amarok, I would
recommend gtkpod <http://www.gtkpod.org/about.html>.  I've used it on my
xubuntu laptop for 2 years with my 2nd generation nano and  haven't had any

I have always used gtkpod. I should probably try Amarok because gtkpod
confuses me. I don't understand what syncs to what. But gtkpod does
work. I just seldom use it because once the music is on the iPod I'm
done for a while.

Subject: [PLUG] 'unlimited' Sprint EVDO
Message-ID: <bfc61080905050237w1eed16dfyc96b3edb8dff8abb@mail.gmail.com>

I got my off-the-grid friend talked into getting an 'unlimited' Sprint
EVDO (early 2008) routed through a cradlepoint router (USB EVDO
supplied internet connection routed to computers via ethernet and
WiFi). Now she's interested in having me set up Boxee for her, but I
heard there's a new 5GB limit (which translates to about 24 hours of
hulu-ish content per month). She hasn't heard anything about a change
except from me (though it may have been buried on some bill where she
didn't notice), and I don't want to rock the boat by quizzing Sprint
until I know what's up.

Does anyone know if the Sprint unlim accounts are grandfathered in, or
if it's changed over to 5GB on a case-by-case basis, if it's being
enforced, and if enforcement is mega-charge for usage over 5GB, temp
stoppage at 5GB, or outright cancellation for exceeding 5GB or some
other semi-secret threshold? Thanks for any help.

When my wife inherited an iPod I just installed rockbox onto the iPod 
itself so that it could play .ogg files and also play music copied 
directly onto it's hard drive without needing 'special' software to do so.

Last time i tried Amarok, it was a hassle to use with Gnome. i've played 
with Banshee on & off, but it seems a bit under-featured and bloated 
from the resource-usage perspective. For the last couple of years i've 
used Rhythmbox to my library, even though i find it lacking in other 
areas (podcast management is so-so, ripping from cd is inexplicably 
slow). I use SoundJuicer to rip from my cd collection (all the music on 
my iPod is from my full-fidelity, uncompressed, 99% paid-for cd 
collection).

i really like gtkpod for getting stuff on & off the iPod - it's simple 
and straightforward, and extremely reliable (it's never corrupted the 
iPod db, unlike iTunes itself), and lets me use th iPod's lovely, highly 
usable UI. Most importantly, it doesn't bind my device to a specific 
iTunes library. Ogg support isn't an issue for me, though.

my $.02,
Joe

Is Clearcase absolutely necessary for your setup? I have never used it ( is
it linux/unix based at all? ) I think you could accomplish what you want
with setting up a git repo for patch downloads and then some scripting fu to
import the updates into your other version control software. Subversion
comes to mind since it would seem pretty trivial to script an http: or even
file system update of the new(er) patches you've downloaded using git.

Yes, I have it running on RHEL5 servers. They (IBM) even provide the
mvfs kernel module
in source form as part of the install.

Subject: [PLUG] Updated PLUG card
Message-ID: <20090505165050.GA10645@gate.kl-ic.com>

Bill Ensley of Panda Printing in Tigard has been printing our PLUG
cards for some time.   Thanks, Bill!   Panda has a new digital
printing system, better quality than the old offset cards. 
Time to print new cards with updated information:  

---------------------------------------------------------
General Meeting:	Portland State University
1st Thurs, 7PM		Engineering Bldg, 1930 SW 4th Ave.
Afters:       		Lucky Lab Beerhall Northwest
1st Thurs, 9PM     	1945 NW Quimby, Portland
Advanced Topics:  	Roots Organic Brewing
3rd Wed, 7PM      	1520 SE 7th, Portland
Linux Clinic:		Free Geek
3rd Sun, 1PM		1731 SE 10th, Portland

May 2009        check for changes at www.pdxlinux.org
Join the PLUG mailing lists at http://lists.pdxlinux.org
---------------------------------------------------------

If anyone is feeling ambitious, we can also update the front-side
picture.  The final card is 2in X 3.5in, and I design it with a
0.125 inch "bleed", that is, the image bleeds over the edge and
is 2.25in X 3.75in .  

Otherwise, I will print with the brownish "people + tux" image
that I've already got.  I hope to submit the job this friday,
so the cards will be ready before Advanced Topics, and we will
have some to pass out at Open Source Bridge.

BTW, Panda is keeping busy with real-estate-related printing,
but I hope we can keep them even busier with our personal card
printing.  Colorful business cards help find business and jobs.

Thanks Keith.

All the information looks correct to me - but then I do sometimes miss
things - so others should
check things as well.

These cards have been great and Panda Printing in Tigard has been
great to print these for us.

Holy crap, rockbox works on ipods?  it is intensely cool software that
i've been using on my archos jukebox for years now--i had no idea
they'd branched out to ipods.  highly recommended experience if it
behaves the same--very open source friendly (heck, the OS itself is
Open source!)

Definitely check out Rockbox. I installed it on my Sansa
E200-something player, and it's vastly superior to the crapware the
device shipped with. Some of the UI skins are a bit busy, but the
feature list is very impressive. Two of my favorites are bookmarks and
pitch (playback speed) control.

Sorry for the onlist reply, but both debian and ubuntu have the rmadison
package/command available. If you install it, you can then query to find
what version of a package is in all versions of these distributions. Thus,
on an ubuntu system, one can do:

$ rmadison perl
      perl | 5.8.7-10ubuntu1 |        dapper | source, amd64, i386, powerpc
      perl | 5.8.7-10ubuntu1.2 | dapper-security | source, amd64, i386, powerpc
      perl | 5.8.7-10ubuntu1.2 | dapper-updates | source, amd64, i386, powerpc
      perl |   5.8.8-12 |         hardy | source, amd64, i386
      perl | 5.8.8-12ubuntu0.4 | hardy-security | source, amd64, i386
      perl | 5.8.8-12ubuntu0.4 | hardy-updates | source, amd64, i386
      perl | 5.10.0-11.1ubuntu2 |      intrepid | source, amd64, i386
      perl | 5.10.0-11.1ubuntu2.2 | intrepid-security | source, amd64, i386
      perl | 5.10.0-11.1ubuntu2.2 | intrepid-updates | source, amd64, i386
      perl | 5.10.0-19ubuntu1 |        jaunty | source, amd64, i386
      perl | 5.10.0-19ubuntu1 |        karmic | source, amd64, i386

and

$ rmadison -u debian perl
      perl |    5.8.8-7 |     etch-m68k | source, m68k
      perl | 5.8.8-7etch6 |     oldstable | source, alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390, sparc
      perl |  5.10.0-19 |        stable | source, alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390, sparc
      perl |  5.10.0-19 |       testing | source, alpha, amd64, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390, sparc
      perl |  5.10.0-19 |      unstable | hurd-i386, ia64, kfreebsd-amd64, kfreebsd-i386, mipsel, s390
      perl |  5.10.0-20 |  experimental | source, alpha, amd64, armel, i386, ia64, mipsel, powerpc, s390, sparc
      perl |  5.10.0-21 |      unstable | sparc
      perl |  5.10.0-22 |      unstable | source, alpha, amd64, armel, hppa, i386, mips, powerpc

to find all published versions of perl on supported ubuntu and debian
distributions (I don't have a debian system offhand to know if the
rmadison there has a shortcut url for ubuntu.)

Do note that Ubuntu 7.10 aka Gutsy Gibbon has fallen off the list of
supported releases.

Oh, and for the record:

$ rpm -q perl ; lsb_release -d
perl-5.8.8-76.4
Description:    openSUSE 10.3 (i586)

If you are interested in any of this, please reply to me off-list.

If anyone wants some NetApp hardware, my workplace is getting rid of
some. We have:

- Two F720 filer head units
- One F760 filer head unit
- Six disk shelves ... an assortment of 36G and 18G disks in them

The disk shelves are connected via Fibre Channel. We have all the cables.

All of this has been powered on, so at least the units work. Also, the
disks power on with no "fault" lights on, except one 36G disk, which
is marked. Not sure about firmware. You'll need to pick these up if
you want them. We're in Beaverton, near the Streets of Tanasbourne
mall-ish place.

Steve,

Not to derail, but I just checked on my 8.1 Ubuntu (Intrepid) and I have no
rmadison. Nor can I do an apt-get install on it.

What repository are oyu pointing to that has rmadison? It sounds interesting
and thought I would try it...

thanks,
Dan H.

On my Jaunty x86_64 I don't find madison, but I do find madison-lite.
The description says:

| This program inspects a local Debian package archive and displays the
| versions of the given packages found in each suite (for example, stable,
| testing, or unstable) in a brief but easily human-readable form. It aims to
| be a drop-in replacement for the madison utility from the da-katie archive
| management suite that runs on the central Debian archive systems, but one
| which can run without access to the archive's SQL database.
|
| For simple queries, you can use http://packages.debian.org/ instead, which
| does not require you to have access to a system with a local mirror.

Its properties says it is in the universe repo.

Sadly, if I told you any more I'd have to make it up. The only thing I
know about perl is that it is for casting before swine. I do, however,
know the fascinating etymology of 'swine' in some detail.

Doh! I thought it was a separate package, but it turns out that's part
of the devscripts package.

Yes it does! My wife has an older iPod 3g and it works like a charm, I 
was even able to get freedoom to play on it with decent framerate (looks 
ugly with the B/W screen though). I've converted all of her music into 
.ogg format and when she needs to add music on the device she can now 
just copy them over directly (like a regular USB drive) and still play 
them. I'd never really messed with an iPod before but it shocked me to 
find out that although you can copy files/music directly onto the device 
the iPod music player will not recognize any songs that are not added on 
with iTunes (or something that spoofs it like rhythmbox). Anyone that 
appreciates the hardware capabilities of modern mp3 players but is 
frustrated by the software limitations most companies add should check 
it out. I'm not certain if it's true with all mp3 players but for my 
wifes iPod there was even a non-firmware installer so there was no risk 
of 'bricking' the device if something went wrong.

   This has been a very interesting thread for me. I have an 8G Meizu mp3
player that works very well. I plug it into the USB port, mount it as a
drive, and cp files on and off (it's formatted VFAT). Simple.

   The other side of music playing that still eludes me is on the desktop.
For reasons no one has yet been able to help me determine, audacious
segfaults when I try to invoke it (and it's part of the Slackware-12.2
distribution), and xmms2 won't configure to build because it cannot find the
local installation of sqlite3. Checkmate.

   I have cmus installed, but it will not see all the .mp3 files in the
directory, and I've not figured this one out, either.

   Sometimes both stations on the radio (KMHD and KBPS) have either too much
talk or music I don't like while I'm working so I'd like to be able to get
sounds I want from the .mp3 files on the hard drive here.

cmus doesn't seem smart enough to notice when new files are added to
directories it's scanned in the past. A restart or a call to the ":add
/your/path/here" command should do the trick.

   Thanks, Paul. I guess I need to re-add each time I invoke it because it
seems to forget each time I kill the process.

I have tried all kinds of music players on the various versions of
Ubuntu that I have used over the years. Currently I am using Rhythmbox,
and it works well. However, I seldom add or delete mp3 files.

I hear you. But if you go streaming internet you have a vast selection
of stations. As I write this I am listening to Radio Classique
streaming from Paris. I listen to nothing but classical, except for the
KMHD trad jazz on Saturday and Sunday. Mike's Radio World
(http://www.listenlive.eu/index.html) has 3,000 streaming stations from
Europe to choose from, and there are tons more from other areas.

I just wish I could get the same streaming stations in the car and
while out hiking.

Subject: [PLUG] IPtables internal port forwarding
Message-ID: <26537.170.135.241.45.1241643243.squirrel@mail.jamhome.us>


If I have a connection arriving on Port X from IPaddr A.B.C.D can I forward it
to port 80X?

Or to be a bit less abstract:

 If I have a client connecting to port 22 on my server, say from 10.18.18.4
 can I use IPtables to sent that connection to Port 8022 on the same box?

 At the same time I would want traffic from 10.18.19.4 to arrive on port 22
 and be forwarded passed through to port 22.

In a standard firewall situation that's a standard case scenario.
The wrinkle here is the traffic destination is the same box.

How much more complicated does this become if I have 10,000 source addresses
that get the special treatment.

The addresses would be a handful each from thousands of net blocks - think of
traffic from routers and switches getting the special treatment while traffic
from workstations, servers and such are passed through.

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -s 10.18.18.4 --dport 22 -j
REDIRECT --to-port 8022

Something like that, anyways.

Something like:

# iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -s $EVIL_IP -d $SERVER_EXTERNAL_IP --dport 22 -j DNAT --to-destination $SERVER_EXTERNAL_IP:8022

might do the trick.  That'll redirect just evil connections to 8022
and won't touch stuff from other IPs Of course this stuff may not
scale well if you have thousands of "evil" IPs.  If instead, you want
to white list "good" IPs and assume all others are "evil", that would
probably be easier to maintain and would scale better. I'm sure you
can work out the syntax of that after a quick `man iptables'.

i think the original poster wanted to magically create rules that would 
take port x and map to x+8000 based on incoming addresses.  he wanted to 
avoid creating thousands of rules.  to that, i don't think there is going 
to be an easy solution, so programatically creating the rules as needed, 
and i don't know if iptables will have limits on the number of rules.

Sure, I kinda expected that, but it's not hard to go from the above
line to something like:

cat evil_ips.txt | while read EVIL_IP; do
  iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -s $EVIL_IP -d $SERVER_EXTERNAL_IP --dport 22 -j DNAT --to-destination $SERVER_EXTERNAL_IP:8022
done

As for scaling with lots of rules, I think it somewhat depends on how
you write your chains.  If you break up the conditionals for your rule
such that all of your evil IP addresses are isolated on one chain and
the only time you jump to that chain is when you already know it's
port 22 traffic and any other conditionals, then I think it can scale
pretty well.  BTW, there are published benchmarks comparing iptables
with pf and other firewalls when examine how they scale with lots and
lots of rules.

Of course this kind of blacklisting is just playing whack-a-mole and
may be ill-advised.  If you're worried about password brute force
attacks, then require users to use public keys in your sshd_config
and be done with it.

or if you can't do that, use something like denyhosts to tcpwrap them
out of existence after X number of failures.  i rolled this out after
i got tired of playing whack-a-mole and to my delight discovered that
no scanner in the past 8 months (since i rolled it out) continues to
scan more than a handful of times after the connection is refused.

i cannot implement the host keys solution since some inflexible 3rd
party systems sftp into our servers for automated file dropoff/pickup,
and i didn't want to get into the business of teaching ie mac
dreamweaver human users how to set up keys either.

   On the advice of many, I installed denyhosts here and it works like a
charm. However, I still see dozens to hundreds of attempts from the same IP
address to ssh in and even more trying brute force attacks to find a valid
username.

   Between the NetGear firewall appliance and denyhosts they've all been kept
out.

interesting!  i get scanned several times a day and have yet to see
one that keeps going after a few "connection refused"s.  i figured
there were no more than a couple of types of scanners (seemed likely
there are at least that many--one tries a lot of passwords per
connection and one only tries one;  one cycles through a list of
account names from a-z and another just tries root@ a lot, etc).  the
most infuriating for me now are some occasional "distributed"
scans--no more than one connection attempt per IP, runs at a
trickle-flow instead of mass-blast.  those foil denyhosts like a slow
knife foils a shield from Herbert's _Dune_.  they worry me a lot more
because it seems like an extra level of sophistication to have your
botnet scan me!

if only i could get denyhosts to parse proftpd logs.  because those
scans still carry on for hours unless i happen to flip past the syslog
window while they're in progress.

I just have a problem with reactive defense mechanisms.  There needs
to be some real security benefit or no other way to accomplish the
same thing before I deploy something that actively tries to thwart
attacks.  I'm not a fan of IPS or even IDS, in case you hadn't
guessed.  

Reactive defense adds software to your system.  All software has bugs.
Some percentage of software bugs have a negative security impact.  How
can you weigh the negative security impact of your reactive defense
system against the gains it provides?  How do you weigh this against
the extra effort it requires to maintain?

Another option is to use PAM/libcrack to ensure users select secure
passwords.  

Or, simply white list the IP ranges your sftp users are likely coming
in from and block the rest.

Or require that they come in over a VPN first.  OpenVPN provides a
great pre-auth handshake option over UDP that obliterates any password
guessing and DoS attacks on it's port and you can't even tell it's
listening there.

Does dreamweaver support WebDAV over SSL?  Maybe managing client
certificates in a browser would be easier for them than trying to do
it with sftp.

There's probably other solutions, depending on your environment.

tim

almost certainly.  the only problem i cannot find a solution to is
having enough time to test them all.  i just went with one that works
well and quickly and universally.

i agree with much of your philosophy, but until i get to spend full
time wearing the sysadmin hat...

My current computer has major problems (hard drive failure I expect.)
I am limping along now using a SLAX live CD.

The MB has had issues in the past, so now is the time to upgrade from
PATA to SATA, and other more modern stuff.

I seem to recall that there were mentioned here a few Linux-friendly
businesses selling computers.  A pointer in the right direction would
be appreciated.

Thanks,

If you're using an up-to-date sshd, and employ good password practices, 
what's the point of doing all this? Honest question.

You're probably wanting somebody on the west side, but I think Pacific 
Solutions is a good choice for those east of the river.
http://www.pacificsolutions.com/home.php

Of course there's always Free Geek.  I'm sure they'll sell you 
something perfectly serviceable for not much money.

Or perhaps build your own. Let's you set the budget and really shop
around as well as verify compatibility with Linux.

Denis,

   I've had excellent service from ENU, Inc. on NE 122nd Ave. when I've gone
there for components to build a new system. When I tell them I'll be running
linux they recommend brands and models that have worked for me each time.

   I'm not at all a Pacific Solutions fan after three bad experiences there,
but others like them so that's an option for you, too.

   The firewall appliance replaced the old floppyfw that ran for years. It's
silent, small, and works. The denyhosts is an addition to the
/etc/hosts.allow and the sshd requirement for access only for those users in
/etc/passwd. Didn't use that for years, but an extra layer doesn't hurt
anything and has no overhead that I see.

Thanks to all for the suggestions.  I would like to build my own, but
am unsure of my talents.  That said, I will dig into it when I return
from my trip mid-month.  It is good to know that there are some
choices.

Pacific Solutions @ SE 51st & Division  

I highly recommend them. I've bought everything from motherboards to
memory to power supplies and cases to video cards to hard drives and DVD
drives from them. 

Right now I'm running two SATA drives (200 and 250 gig. Seagates) that I
bought as refurbished and after 2 years they are trouble free. The same
with an MSI/NVidia N9600GSO PCI-E video card. Refurbed and absolutely no
problems. In six years, I've had to return only two products, a 550 watt
power supply whose fan went manic within a week and an MSI mobo whose
CMOS died in a similar timespan. Both times Pacific Solutions gave me a
replacement, no questions asked. I'm a newly confirmed vocal Linux fan
so they know they won't make any money off me with Microsoft/Windows
software sales but I still get top notch service and advice.

I've also had good luck with ENU but as Pacific Solutions fulfills all
my needs and is literally within walking distance I stick with them. 

Just one customer's opinion but as I have building my own systems since
the late '80s it should count for something.

ENU also has a Hillsboro store (east of the airport) for far west-siders:
2038 NW Aloclek Drive #213.  I've used ENU for parts and systems for
several years without any problems.

Overhead exists in installation, setup, updating, and maintenance of 
another service. Denyhosts has its own vulnerabilities from time to 
time. More services create more attack vectors. This isn't a criticism. 
I was just curious as to the reasons.

I haven't bought an off-the-shelf desktop in ages. I always build them
myself. My last one (two years ago) came partly from ENU, partly from
online stores, and mostly from Fry's. I've had problems with things
like a buggy BIOS on the motherboard, but I've never had a problem with
any of the retailers mentioned here. In fact, Fry's took the evil
motherboard back at 92 days from purchase date.

It occurs to me that if Denis is not completely comfortable with
assembling a desktop himself, it might be an interesting thing to do at
a Clinic. Just show up with shopping bags of parts and leave with a
working Linux computer. I can't think of a better location to put
together a computer than Free Geek. And the researching and shopping
for parts is highly educational.

As the OP here's the background story.

At work we manage several thousand switches and routers.
We're replacing our management platform with a new one.
There is an internal requirement to NEVER use clear text protocols.

So to put a new IOS image on a Cisco device we use SCP.

The new management app has two features:
  it has the Cisco devices pull configs, images, everything
  its default port for serving these resources is 8022

Complicating factors:

The Cisco devices cannot be configured to SCP to a different port than 22[1]
We do normal management via ssh - aka port 22

In order to not confuse the beejesus out of all the groups that currently ssh
to boxes we are loath to move SSH to a non-standard port.

Therefore:

We want to have the incoming port 22 connection from switches and routers (we
know the IPs involved) redirected to port 8022 to connect with the management
app software.

AND - I'm freshly dragged into this problem and suspect I'm not being given

you can easily change the port a cisco listens on for ssh/scp, but it 
sounds like you are doing a:
copy startup-config scp:...

type thing?  have you tried something like:

copy startup-config scp://user at host:port/file

That's correct.

That would certainly be the sane approach.

The copy command is fed to the Cisco by the management app.  I'm being told
you cannot specify the port.  I'm verifying this soon.

i just tried this on my 7206 and even though it will take a port number, 
it seems to ignore it and uses 22.

This problem doesn't make sense.

What?
You know how to verify that cable ends and receptacle pins match up and how to
twirl a screwdriver?  Those are the hard bits.

I second the clinic idea. I have a linux box in the basement that I've been
trying (well, once every three weeks for an hour or so) to troubleshoot a
power problem on. A clinic would be a great place to do that...

All,

The software I'm installing is doing a query against rpm (rpm -qi rpm) to
determine the vendor, and bombing out when it sees CentOS in that field.
Anybody know of a way to update that field in the rpm database to read Red
Hat, Inc.?

thanks,

that is sleazy.  usually things just check /etc/redhat-release, but they 
must have caught on to how easy it is to lie :-).  what i'd suggest is 
making a fake rpm script that returns what they expect to see.  fiddling 
with the rpm database is bad.  hopefully this is just at install time?

Subject: [PLUG] Strange behavior with Wifi USB adapter
Message-ID: <4a0b36aa0905071618s2315bea2rd6b513f2d3c1f6e2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi :

I have a Linksys Wireless-G USB adapter (Model WUSB54GC) which I use to
connect to a wifi router at work for
connectivity.  It is DHCP and works fine most of the time.  Every now then,
after a long usage especially, it will disconnect
from the router itself.  In fact, it seems that the USB adapter is not
functional anymore even though the green light on it is still lit.
If I unplug and plug it back it, green light is lit, wlan0 shows as "UP" in
ifconfig but I do not receive any address.

I look at /var/log/message (included below), it would just say wlan0: link
is not ready.  The network-monitor GUI says wlan0 is invalid.  If I wait a
day or two, the USB adapter will start working again.

Can anyone offer clues to explain this very odd behavior?  I borrowed
another adapter from my sister (same model) and
the same thing would happen over time.  I uses 2 different boxes (kernel
2.6.27 and 2.6.28) and the same thing happened on both boxes.

This isn't a shoestring operation, so you should be able to throw a bit
of relatively cheap hardware at the situation to simplify the issue and
simultaneously make your life easier and maintain great network service
levels for both the remote network hardware boxes and your human users.

You can't change the port that the switches / routers access to download
their software, you say.  But you CAN change the IP address they attempt
to connect with to do so.  So, just route their traffic through a simple
front-end firewall box to perform the port translation that solves this.

You'll need another little firewall with two NICs, plus another NIC card
in your main configuration server that handles both the automated router
and switch traffic plus ad-hoc SSH connections from the customer groups.

ASCII art:
                                        ___________________________
router/switch --> new firewall --> eth1 |                          |
                                        |   Configuration Server   |
the customers --> old firewall --> eth0 |__________________________|


The new outer firewall uses IPtables Prerouting rules (thousands of 'em)
to change the destination port from 22 to 8022, and one Forward rule to
route those packets to your configuration server's new second IP address
on its new interface eth1.

The old outer firewall passes the same old port 22 traffic right through
to the configuration server's same old IP address on old interface eth0.

This will avoid slowing network traffic for everyone by forcing each and
every packet to traverse thousands of new IPtables rules in the existing
firewall.

With streamlining of established connection packets, you can likely also
make this sort of configuration perform fairly well for the dumb routers
and switches too.

Hope this helps!
Robert

We had the same problem here with that model.  We guessed it to be a 
heat issue, but don't really have any way to confirm that.  I wired the 
room for ethernet and solved the problem.

Good to know that we weren't the only one having issues with it.

Recently in this thread I noted that a lot of users (including someone
here) have issues with Jaunty hanging on shutdown. The other day I
received a notice that there were 69 upgrades available. I installed
them all. This evening I shut the computer down for the first time
since the upgrades, and Jaunty did not hang. 

Naturallly I did not make a list of the upgrades. :(

I had a quick gander at the Linksys forums (http://tinyurl.com/qyweqt) 
and found there may be a patch for this problem.  I didn't look any 
further because I don't have this particular beastie.

If you care for mail order, I like System76.  It's who I went to when I 
wanted a guarantee-to-work Linux laptop (on which I'm writing this mail).

They _only_ do Linux (AFIAK they only do Ubuntu, but you'll have to 
check that), and for their laptops at least they publish drivers for the 
odds and bobs that may not be in the distro.  The one time I needed 
customer support they were very responsive, and they appear to have a 
nice lineup.

hmm, aptitude leaves a record of what it upgraded in /var/log --
that's the main reason i use it instead of apt-get.  does anyone know
if the auto-updater does?  i don't even know what that program is
called, since my farm of ubuntu machines are all remotely
administered.

Subject: [PLUG] HDTV reception / DVI connector keying
Message-ID: <4A03E3A5.7060504@seitzassoc.com>


At tonight's meeting I was claiming that the blade portion of a DVI 
connector was used for keying different types of DVI connectors.  A 
subsequent search found no basis for this claim.  As someone else 
mentioned, the blade is the analog ground, and it appears that it is 
always in the same orientation.

As penance for my misinformation, I offer this link that has lots of 
good info regarding Over The Air(OTA) HDTV reception and the coming 
switchover.
   http://www.hdtvprimer.com/

Regarding the June 12 switchover to digital-only broadcasts, here are 
the final frequency assignments for the major local stations.  It's my 
understanding that today all of these broadcasters are transmitting 
their digital signal in the UHF band.  On June 12, the stations that 
have been transmitting an analog signal in the high band VHF 
range(7-13 -- KGW, OPB, KPTV) will move their digital broadcast from 
UHF to their original VHF frequency.  Note that KATU, KOIN, and KPDX 
will stay in the UHF band.  Thus to receive all the stations, you will 
need an antenna that covers both high band VHF(rabbit ears) as well as 
UHF(bowtie).

KATU 43
KOIN 40
KGW  8
OPB 10
KPTV 12
KPDX 30

I suspect that at least some HD receivers will need to rescan the 
bands after the switchover has occurred in order to pick up the 
frequency change.

Here's an example of an antenna specifically designed for the 
post-switchover era.  Note the absence of low band VHF coverage.  A 
big benefit is fewer, smaller elements.  I've no experience with it. 
It's just something I spotted while shopping.
   http://www.solidsignal.com/prod_display.asp?PROD=HBU22

I suspect everyone will be affected by the HDTV switchover, if only as 
tech support for others.  Thus I decided to post this to the main list.

Finally, here's a warning to those who would take their home 
television viewing a bit too far.

I haven't put a box together in ages but you have to be careful not to
bend the CPU pins :)

I also like the clinic idea. I've had great success with ENU, the
airport location guys usually seem a little edgy though. Sort of get
in get out no customer service banter.

Did I ever mention the management platform runs on either Linux or MSWindows? (Probably Solarias, HPUX ... but that's out of scope for us)

MSWindows hosted systems don't have the conflict problem because remote administration is done through Remote Desktop which uses port 3389 by default.  

We could switch our management application hosting platform to MSWindows. 

My boss is strongly against this option.

Instead we'll go to the IP Address Administration group and request an additional IP for the management workstations.  We'll configure an additional ethernet port to serve the management application on port 22.

I decided to take the leap and install JJ and I like it so far. However I
have run in to 2 issues. I can't seem to get my wireless card to associate
with my access point, something that hasn't been an issue with this laptop
when using Fedora or Slackware. I also can't seem to enable desktop effects,
Slackware doesn't offer this out of the box but with Fedora I had no issues.


I'm off to research.

This closes port 22 except to IP addresses that have accessed port
1234 and then port 5678 first.

Example:
$ telnet myhomepc.net 1234
Trying 123.231.123.231...^C
$ telnet myhomepc.net 5678
Trying 123.231.123.231...^C
$ ssh joe at myhomepc.net
[joe ~] $ _

NOTE: This adds little in the way of security.  I use it merely to
keep the log files clean (from zillions of login attempts).  Helps me
avoid having to maintain a long blacklist (or even a short whitelist).

Remember to open ports 22, 1234 and 5678 on the router.  Also best to
use some other random pair of ports than 1234 / 5678. :-)

Subject: [PLUG] Jauntysuckiness - laptop screens going black and staying
	that way
Message-ID: <200905080747.03836.michael@jamhome.us>

Somewhere in HAL or ACPI there lives a bug that bites my T42 laptop.

The box goes into suspend mode.  The screen goes black. (Yea! no more 7x24 backlighting) The box comes out of suspend mode.  The screen remains black.  Worse something gets poked into NVRAM and after a reboot the screen remains black.

Fortunately, an external monitor continues to work.
Fortunately, there are suggestions at 
    http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Problem_with_display_remaining_black_after_resume#Solution_for_ThinkPads_with_ATI_graphic_chips_and_Intel_915.2F945GM
and 
    http://people.freedesktop.org/~hughsient/quirk/
that restore the laptop screen.

Now if I'd only taken better notes when poking and prodding the system...

Anyway, if your laptop screen goes and stays black, it's a known problem with solutions.

Not restricted to Jaunty by the way, multiple distros and versions are affected.  Jaunty was just my first encounter with the issue.

I downloaded the alphas of Jaunty as it neared release. At the last
Clinic I booted to the release candidate live CD. I was very pleased to
see the notification area wireless icon in the Gnome panel. Even more
pleasing was clicking on it and seeing Free Geek and a couple other
wireless networks. And it was especially pleasing to be able to just
click on Free Geek and get an IP address almost instantly. 

My laptop has the Intel 4965agn wireless. I have never had any problems
getting distros (live or otherwise) to see it. Getting it to connect
and stay connected is another matter. In the past Network Manager
sucked rocks. For example, at PSU there are always at least a dozen
networks available, although as a student I can connect only to General
Access. Nevertheless, they should all appear. They do appear if I scan
from the command line, so I know the device and its drivers are
working. But the drop-down in the Network Manager GUI rarely displayed
any available networks. Sometimes if you clicked it several dozen times
eventually it would display a few networks, and then the display would
suddenly disappear before you could click on one of them. The maddening
part was that this was the behavior for years with no improvement.

As a result of all this a long time ago I discovered and installed
wicd. Wicd will not share its ball with other players, so installing
wicd uninstalls Network Manager. My feeling was good riddance. Wicd
always worked great. I put a little launcher icon in the Gnome panel
and when I clicked on it I could instantly see all the networks
available, even my ethernet at home.

But I was very impressed with how well the live CD of the Jaunty
release candidate worked with wireless. So before upgrading to Jaunty I
reinstalled Network Manager and removed wicd. I was hoping that the new
version would work for me as well as it did on the release candidate.

Unfortunately, although I have connected via wireless only twice since
the dist-upgrade, Network Manager is not working as well as it does
with the live CD. At the general meeting last night it took me several
minutes of poking to get connected. The Gnome panel icon is supposed to
display two monitors when connected to ethernet, as I am at home, and
it does so. It is supposed to change to the bars icon when you are not
connected to ethernet, and then clicking on it is supposed to display
available wireless networks. Last night it stubbornly remained the
two-monitor icon and refused to display any available wireless networks.

Clearly there is something in my installation that is goobering up
Network Manager and making it not work the way it does with the live CD
of Jaunty. Sadly, I am not smart enough to figure out what it is.
However, I *am* smart enough to know how to install wicd. As a side
benefit, once I reinstall wicd I can get rid of that annoying
notification area in the Gnome panel.

It seemed to be some weird transient issue as wireless works fine now. I had
created a wireless profile using the network manager and it would not work,
I don't broadcast my SSID so when I chose "connect to hidden network" and
selected "new" instead of the already created profile it started working
fine and has worked fine since *shrug*.  Compiz has been causing some issues
with X locking up the entire machine and forcing a power reset but I believe
it was because I had loaded too many plugins just playing around. I have
pared them down significantly and it hasn't locked up so far. I am using an
integrated Intel graphics chip which seems to have it's own quirks with
Compiz, so I'm not blaming Ubuntu itself.

I admit, I have been staying away from Ubuntu releases and their ilk until
now but figured it was worthwhile to give it a try. I am impressed. It does
boot quite fast and other then the weird installation procedure (weird to
me) it seems pretty spiffy. Now maybe I can help answer list questions now
that I know what the hell the tools and such are called :)

Rockbox works on most iPod models, but not all.? Doesn't work on mine.
 I use gtkpod to get music on and off it.

Interestingly, the 0S X side of my old iMac (on which I dual-boot OS
Xv10.2 "Jaguar" and Debian Lenny) will no longer work with my iPod.
You can only install up to a certain older version of iTunes, which is
too old to cooperate with a needed version of the iPod-updating
software that comes bundled with iTunes.? So to move music to and from
my Mac and my iPod, I have to boot into Linux.

Is that what they mean by "Think Different"?

Subject: [PLUG] web/flash slide show tools
Message-ID: <20090508205336.GA23638@gate.kl-ic.com>

I'm looking for an alternative to OpenOffice.org for slide shows,
and thinking about web-like alternatives that I can run through
with firefox.  The major problem now is OOo Impress's poor support
for embedded movies and animation - you have to add many extra
java packages, and it is slow.  Portability is also an issue.

My slide shows are graphics heavy and text light - I am not
interested in fancy moving arrows and text and frame-to-frame
dissolves.  I build a lot of my slides with C programs and libgd.
I can use the open source "swftools" to turn PNG frames into
Flash movies.  

Content creation is not much of an issue, but displaying it the
way I want it is a big issue.  I want to use a USB wireless
presenter style remote, which generates the keyclicks and
mouseclicks that OOo Impress and Powerpoint and others can be
driven with.  I don't want to be tied down to a mouse (even a
wireless one) if I can avoid it.

Suggestions?

Keith

Keith,

   I use the LaTeX beamer class. The results are typeset, graphics are easy
to insert, and the result is a .pdf file.

This afternoon I finished my first book on linguistics. Except for
proofreading, it is ready for press. It will be printed by Linguistics
Publishing, Inc. (which I own) to be ready for fall university
bookstore orders.

The writing and a lot of the layout was done in OpenOffice.org 3.0.x.
Final layout was done in Scribus 1.3.5svn, with assistance from
Inkscape. The operating system was Ubuntu Intrepid and Jaunty, x86_64.

Not one penny of cash money was paid for any of the software used in
the project. Rather, payment was made by participating in e-lists,
wikis, bug reporting, and other resources to assist others in using the
software.

Message-ID: <e2aeccd60905090619j51a4e8cfqe5b351e60e19d5f8@mail.gmail.com>

I ran into a problem on a server I run last night. df was reporting no space
left and services obviously stopped working. The weird thing is that when I
checked all the directories on the mount point they didn't add up to the
space allocated to the partition. It's a 37GB mounted as / with /var /bin
/boot /sbin /usr /dev /media /proc /opt and .sys

I removed some un-needed software on the box to get it back up and breathing
again but I still have no clue how it filled up, so I have no way of knowing
if it'll happen again. Originally IIRC it was only using about 17GB of space
as the meat of storage is on /home on a seperate partition.

Hitting me with the clue stick would be appreciated or any ideas on where to
look would be great.

Thanks,
Drew-

Part of it is the journal. I've freed up some additional space by limiting
the journal size. So I'm good to go for now.

I'm guessing you have an "open but unlinked" file someplace.  In other
words, there's a process that's writing a big data file, but that file
was removed.  Since the file has been removed ("unlinked") from the file
system, tools like "du" won't find the space used by this file, which is
why your file system totals don't match up.  However, the operating system
is unable to reclaim the space until all processes that have the file
open have been terminated.

How can you find those processes?  "lsof +L1 | sort -nk7" (as root)
will show you all "files that are open with link count less than 1",

Thanks Hal,
I found some processes related to Apache and MySQL which aren't a problem.
Nothing else showing up that looks like a problem.

I use LaTeX beamer as well, and I create the presentations in LyX. But
I have not gone into the heavy detailed presentation creation work
flows with animation, etc. ... I just type stuff and import EPS or PDF
graphics made by other tools. The beamer / LyX interface chokes on
some simple things, and I refuse to dig deeper into the complexities
of LaTeX to just make slide shows. I find it frustrating and am
looking for something as easy to use as PowerPoint. :)

Don't get me wrong -- beamer is a masterwork by a computer science
genius (Till Tantau), who also created the "pgf-tikz" graphics
package. But for someone without extensive learning time on their
hands, I recommend simpler tools.

One little known fact about UNIX filesystem semantics:

The filesystem driver in the kernel deletes files once their reference
count reaches 0.  The reference count is incremented with each hard
link (i.e. directory entry referencing the file) *and* each time the
file is *opened* by a process.  It is perfectly legal to open a file
and then delete it (from the directory entry) and yet have the file
persist on disk.  In that case, the file will be truly deallocated
once the file handle is closed.

What this means for you-- 'df' looks at how much space is left on the
device while 'du' looks at how much space is used by files referenced
in a directory tree.  If a file is being used by a process but has
been deleted, it will continue to show up in 'df' totals but not 'du'
totals.  You can use lsof to list all file handles open by all
processes on the system and then try to figure out which of those
files might be deleted.

Oh, just thought of an alternative explanation...  If say you have
files stored under /foo/bar/mountpoint/...  and then you turn around
and mount a partition at /foo/bar/mountpoint, you will no longer see
those files (and 'du' won't either) but they'll continue to take up
space.  This may be more likely in your case if you were having
trouble mounting a partition at some point and some automated process
went about writing junk to the parent partition.  Later after you
fixed your mount problem, you find you're running low on space there.
Just a thought.

HTH,
tim

They could become a problem though. If you have a log file filling up a
partition, and you delete it, it won't go away til you kill the process
(which is what you just learned).

I have a trick which works around this. If you blank the file, rather than
deleting it, it will free up the space without killing the process. I use
echo "" > /var/log/logfile to accomplish this.

I have only a surface knowledge of this, so please flag any nonsense  
in this post   ..

Here's Derek Slater on YouTube talking about this issue ... http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread460257/pg1 
  ... he's not a nut ... he's like from Harvard Law and is a policy/ 
analyst for Google.

I think what "Homes with Tails" suggests (individuals own the  
connection to some local hub that passes on ISP connections) is  
technically feasible. But it seems to me there may be some serious  
legal implications. The way I understand it is that you purchase your  
Internet connection from this third party company that passes it on to  
you. You can then easily change your ISP. And this third party company  
(Sweden has a model similar to this I hear) can then even add value.

One of the concerns that pops up sometimes (I have no idea how serious  
this is) is that in the future ISPs may not provide wide-open Internet  
access but provide only a selected number of sites (or site  
categories) and you choose a level of access (much the same as  
choosing a cable-TV plan). Also, ISPs may actually charge a site  
provider to have his/her site listed in a particular category. Is this  
a nonsense fear or a realistic possibility? This aspect is not brought  
up in Slater's video.

Then, if you have the "Home with Tails" solution, this third party can  
then choose not to restrict Internet access. That's the added value.  
But then if they do that, then the ISP charging for a listing does not  
make any sense and that would certainly annoy them.

So I read about this but don't have enough background to evaluate this  
information. So that's why this post. And then why haven't these third- 
party companies sprung up in the US. Seems to me that if it were a  
practical  business opportunity, someone would be doing it.  Such a  
model doesn't seem technically impractical, so if there is a  
hindrance, could it be some legal thing?

You know I did some reading about this today, and it seems to be tied

Subject: [PLUG] porting presentation to html
Message-ID: <20090511085120.GC29673@gate.kl-ic.com>

I've done the presentation for server sky a few times now;  the
next one will be at the Oregon L5 meeting on Saturday May 16. 
I will post details later.

In any case, OpenOffice.org is pretty slow and does not do
animations well.  I'm planning to port the presentation to
html files, which will contain some javascript that reads the
output of my "wireless presenter", or keyboard buttons or mouse,
and selects the next slide.  I plan to construct the package of
html files with Perl scripts called by a makefile.  Some of the
files will contain swf Flash animations, which display pretty
decently in firefox.

There will be navigation pages that take me to blocks of 
slides.  I also find the usual "click through all the 
slides" approach pretty stupid;  with multiple navigation
pages, I can drill down via section slides or other organizers
to reach any slide quickly.  Instead of thumbnails, I will
simply use text names.  

By using a make file, I can construct multiple targeted
slide sets from a directory of slide images.  I can also 
regenerate all the sets after I change one of the synthesis
programs.  Some of the slides will be png's emitted by 
openoffice; that is still a useful design tool for static
slides.

The resulting presentations should display nicely on any 
browser with java and flash.  

If anybody wants to help build this, it might make a popular
general purpose tool that will earn fame and fortune.  However,
it seems like such an obvious way to do things (especially the
make file technique) that I suspect someone has already done
it.  Pointers, please!

BTW, some of this is inspired by some javascripting and slide
synthesis that Eric Wilhelm did with the Perl module Text::Slidez .
My needs are different, so I will be using some of his code as
a starting point.

I think it's kind of a slippery slope deal. AOL tried this (rather
successfully for a while) where you paid for "net access" which only allowed
you to access AOL-controlled resources. There was a lot of smoke and mirrors
involved to try to keep people from finding out there was a bigger net out
there.

If some of the larger media corporations got together and mutually excluded
access to each others' resources, we could see a very big impact on the
effective size of the net we can reach. I agree that it is not currently
much of a problem, at least not in our country. but if it does become a
problem, it will become such a large problem so fast, that it's important
that we make very sure it never happens.

Who are you using as a printing fulfillment house?
Assuming that Linguistics Publishing, Inc. does not own physical presses,
binders and such.

Linguistics Publishing, Inc. owns three perfect binders, one
guillotine, one laminator, eight laser printers, and miscellaneous
smaller equipment. Generally I print the guts on Laserjet 8000DNs and
the covers on Xerox Phaser 8400DN. The present book is fairly short, so
I can produce 200 copies per day if pressed. Normally I run only one
printer at a time and settle for 30-40 copies per day. The nice thing
about printing with lasers is that they can be printing while I am off
doing other things. When I come home I just remove the copies from the
output stacker and fill up the input trays.

Aside from being in Ruby and not in Perl, the S9 stuff I posted on
PLUG could probably work for this. With S9 you would not need to know
Ruby unless it didn't do everything you want. Here's a few links

http://slideshow.rubyforge.org/tutorial.html
http://groups.google.com/group/webslideshow/web/projects
http://pragdave.blogs.pragprog.com/pragdave/2008/05/our-take-on-pre.html
http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/
http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/
http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy

If I were doing it for myself, I'd go with the Ruby (S9) one. I may do
my next slide show in S9 rather than "beamer" because I'm extremely
frustrated with the "beamer" work flow. But in defense of "beamer", if
you've got a huge presentation and need the ability to skip around,
there are lots of ways to put indexing, table of contents, outlines,
etc. into a presentation and jump around, although you need a
full-screen mouse, not just forward and backward buttons.

I joined the Google group. If you want me to take a preliminary shot
at converting your existing slides to S9, I'll have some free time
tomorrow.

Subject: [PLUG] Odd WINE/Gnome/Windows program interaction
Message-ID: <4A085A47.7060207@wescottdesign.com>

Is there a way to tell, under Gnome or Wine, where an application thinks 
it has it's windows open?

I've got a Windows app that I'm trying to run under Wine, and it seems 
to have lost track of where it's windows are.  Comments from the 
developer kind of obliquely point to this being an issue under Windows, 
too, so I'm not sure that it's specifically a Wine/Gnome problem other 
than maybe that environment offering more opportunities for confusing 
things.

While I'm waiting for the developer to get back to me, I'm wondering if 
there's a log someplace that I can look in to see where the windows are 
going, and if there's any way that I can reach out and hook them back 
into the visible space.

Thanks.

I think office 97 and office 2000 used to have an issue where sometimes they
would save a negative window position to the registry. This means that on
the next startup some of the windows would show in the taskbar, but the
window itself was placed northwest of your viewable desktop.  The solution I
used to use was to right click on the window in the taskbar, select move
from the menu then press the down and right arrow keys until the window
appeared on screen.

Windows certainly can tell you their (x,y) location.  I don't fully
understand your question without seeing it.

I hope that helps,
Jason

My one published book was done using OpenOffice, also, then sent off to 
my publisher who used $$ tools to finish the book.  I did my Master's 
thesis using LaTeX.

I'm still trying to decide if the versatility and math typesetting 
capability of LaTeX is better than the WYSIWYG capability of OOo...

Did you consider using LaTeX, and if so why did you choose OOo instead?

The application spawns child windows; these are the ones that seem to be 
getting lost.  The main application shows up (although it doesn't take 
well to being minimized and restored -- it wants to shrink down to 0,0).

Yes, he did.  And the thread about this seems to have a misleading subject:

There are lots of tools for presenting slide shows.  Eric's Text::Slidez
is one of the better ones, because it riffs off the Takehashi method
( see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method ) that Lawrence
Lessig and others have used to great effect.  Frankly, most slide
shows stink, are too wordy, are badly designed for the audience.  They
commit the cardinal sin of putting more than a dozen words on a page.

In a slide show, single words should be presented as graphics, not
as sentences, and one should never use a word when an image is
available.  No syntax, no parsing.  A presentation should be fast
paced, accessable to people with poor vision, and engage the much
larger image processor in the brain, as opposed to the small and
distractable symbol string syntax processor.  If that makes it
hard to present code, well, that is why code often loses to
visual programming metaphors.  I'm presenting hardware, mostly.

My best presentations are at the opposite end of the spectrum
from "wordy", though you would never guess that from my long and
wordy emails.   My presentations are mostly visual and
image-oriented, and I need tools that help me create and manage
the images, not manage words.  For each animation slide, the
current process looks like so:

    generate common software for many slides
    generate software for a specific animation slide
    generate a series of PNG images
    combine the images with swftools
    build an html page that combines image and java buttons

Now that I have an html slide, I combine it with other slides 
into a slide module (with an html index page with a navigable
list of slides) and slide modules into presentations (with
higher level index pages listing modules).  Each page has
appropriate java controls - the forward and back buttons on
the remote, keyboard, or mouse navigate through the lists,
previous or next slide, etc.  I am not interested in a big 
grid of thumbnails - those are impossible to read and difficult
to navigate, especially with a non-mouse remote.

This process is most easily managed with "make".  Makefiles
for slide modules, makefiles for multiple whole presentations.
Make clauses for building slides, dependency handling so that
changing a single slide will ripple through to all the modules
and slide shows that use it.  Perhaps a meta-tool that helps me
design the makefiles.  But at the end of the day, I don't want
to be jumping into a giant kitchen-sink design environment that
is missing most of the tools that I need to make my specialized
slides and shows.  Windows is the home of giant, hard to manage
and modify environments.   Prisons, really.  Unix/Linux works
with piped collections of small tools, and that is its power. 
I don't have to see the whole structure to improve one tool,
and I can swap out one tool for another as needed.  

I am not interested in 95% of the slide presentation tools out
there.  Like Powerpoint and OpenOffice Impress and other tools,
they foster wordy, hard-to-read slides, with distracting slide
styles that are like lipstick on a pig.  The ultimate tool 
probably does not exist, but I want something that is:

    humane
    makefile driven
    image and animation oriented
    hierarchical
    made from many small tools written in common languages
    works with the entire Linux command line toolset
    output usable with any browser with java and swf
    
If anything comes close, I would love to hear about it, and
I can modify it from there.

wmctrl is *probably* your best bet.

eg: to get a list of all windows open, and their geometry:

$ wmctrl -l -G

.....

wmctrl will also let you close/move/resize/etc windows, but it's
capabilities are highly dependent on your windowmanager.  (It can ask
the WM to do things, but the WM can ignore it.)

In ubuntu, the wmctrl is in the wmctrl package.

If that works, run with it--way more readable than the program that
should always work, xwininfo.  xwininfo tells you not only window
geometry but widget geometry and thus is pretty ridiculously verbose.
(xwininfo -tree -root).  wmctrl doesn't like my WM but xwininfo has no
trouble with it.

primary piece of advice would be to close anything like acrobat or a
browser before running xwininfo.  my 25 open tabs in opera and open
acrobat gave me pages and pages of output.

This book was a real saga.

My first book was done in WordPerfect/DOS. I remember spending hours
and reams of paper printing out each page over and over until I finally
got things positioned properly.

Then I went to QuarkXPress, then PageMaker, briefly to Ventura, and
then to InDesign. I have InDesign CS installed on Windows 2000 in
Virtualbox. Truth be told, I could have done this job in a small
fraction of the time it took if I had done it in InDesign. But this is
my first book since moving to Linux four years ago. I was determined to
do it the FOSS way.

When I first started writing and designing books the term "content" had
not yet entered the lexicon. Somewhere in the 90s I think it became
fashionable to think of content as separate from design. I think it was
the web that brought this about. Whatever, the idea is alien to me. The
design expresses what I am trying to say as much as the words. Bear in
mind that all my books are textbooks and workbooks. Not only are there
lots of graphics, there are no two pages that look alike. 

So when I started this book I decided to do it in OOo. I have been
using OOo as my only word processor for ten years, long before going to
Linux. I knew it had the layout power of WordPerfect, plus a GUI. I
wrote the whole thing and designed it as I went along. But by the time
I got to the end I was severely frustrated by the bugs. This is the
first book I have done that needs formulas (really just scalable
brackets), and the Math module in OOo has so many bugs that it took
forever to work around all the problems. Plus it was dropping
characters in the printout - just a general mess. Some may recall my
asking here for help trying to determine if it was Gnome or Ubuntu or
OOo, and if I might be able to eliminate the problems by going to an
older version on a different platform. Eventually I concluded that OOo
just had to go. It's great for writing ordinary text, but if you need
its less commonly used features it will probably mess up your work. I'd
certainly advise staying clear of its Math module.

That led me to a quest for something  better. Rich and others here
convinced me to try Lyx. Several times in the past I had tried LaTex
and other parts of the family, but never Lyx. I spent three solid 12
hour days in front of the computer trying to figure it out. I'm sure
the job could have been done in Lyx, and perhaps someone who knows Lyx
well could have done it reasonably quickly. But in the end I just
concluded that Lyx and I do not think the same way. 

That left Scribus as my next best alternative. I had already used
Scribus several times in the past for small jobs, so I knew something
about it. The part that I love most is that it is a page layout app. A
big frustration while working in OOo is that it is continuous text. I
could never tell what page I was working on. Or I'd place a graphic and
suddenly it would pop to the next page. I was always using Ctrl-Enter
to force a new page. Scribus (like InDesign, PageMaker and QuarkXPress)
is page oriented. When you start a new document you tell the program
how many pages it is going to be. Each page is a separate entity. If
you place something on a page and it doesn't fit, it still stays where
you put it so you can resize it or move it as necessary. It may slop
off the page onto the pasteboard, but it stays where you put it. Think
of it as an electronic version of a light table and hot wax. This is
how my brain works when laying out a book.

However, much as I love working in Scribus, it has problems. I used a
bleeding edge version - 1.3.5svn, which is not recommended for
production work because it is not yet a stable release. But the stable
version is so old that it lacks too many features that I need. Even
1.3.5 lacks a lot - no tables, for example. So I spent a lot of time
figuring out how to work around the missing pieces. As it turns out,
most of the missing pieces are available in OOo. And Scribus can import
PS, EPS and SVGs as editable vector graphics. So if I needed a table I
did it in OOo, printed the selection to file, and placed it as a
graphic in Scribus. Sometimes OOo would mess up printing to PS and I'd
discover that I could get correct output by printing to CUPS-PDF or
exporting from OOo as PDF. Scribus can place a PDF, but rasterizes it
in the process. But then I discovered that Inkscape does a great job of
importing PDFs and maintaining them as editable vector images. Just
about every page needed some kind of legerdemain to get what I wanted.
But in the end things look a lot better. And not once did I have to
print out a page to see what it would look like. When I finished I made
a printout and I only needed to tweak a couple things.

Having said all of that, if your work needs a lot of serious formulas,
and if you know LaTex, that is probably your best bet. Scribus can
render LaTex formulas (you just type the code into a popup window), but
it does so as bitmaps. If you use enough resolution you can probably
get decent looking formulas, but I found it difficult. And Scribus can
use only Times or Arial when it renders LaTex formulas. You could write
the formulas in LaTex, print to PS, and then place as vector images
into Scribus, though. As for formulas in OOo, I wouldn't wish that
screaming mess on my worst enemy.

That's probably way more than you wanted to read. :(

What's really odd is that with around 400 formulas in mine*, you'd think 
that I'd be screaming about the math module, too.   Yet aside from a 
certain clunkiness (what /does/ keep them from just using LaTeX syntax?) 
it worked fine for me.

I did have some problems with non-printing characters -- OOo has a 
problem with minus signs embedded in the text, and when you're writing a 
control systems text you tend to obsess about -1.  This problem 
propagated all the way to the print version (and I haven't been able to 
get them to fix it, @#$%), which makes the book a confusing read in a 
couple of places.

Sorry it took me so long to get around to trying this.  It works!  I did
this:

  \usepackage[paperwidth=17in,paperheight=11in,margin=0.25in]{geometry}

I'm putting a extra hard drive on my XP box which will be home to

I'm a Linux hobbyist and enthusiast, so I'm asking about a partition

Welcome

This is how I would do it..

partitions for

/
/boot   
swap
/home

YMMV

Good luck

It is useful to have a couple extra 10-20 gb partitions available for
testing other distributions, reinstalling, etc.
Then /, /home and swap.

I would only make /home a separate partition, and exactly for the reason you
mention.  My experience with /swap partitions is that it is needless
headache.  Just use a swap file.  Similar with /boot.  On a sever things
should possibly be different, but on a home system, I doubt you'll let /tmp
or /var/log fill up randomly.  The main thing I wanted to comment on is that
I've not really found a good reason to make /swap a separate partition, but
I have found good reasons to instead use a swap file.

Hope that helps,
Jason

Well ... I guess it depends on what your hobbies are relative to
Linux. openSUSE defaults to a swap, a "/", and a "/home", but Debian
and Ubuntu default to just a swap and a "/". Fedora defaults to some
bizarre LVM configuration.

My hobbies involve I/O testing, so I generally reserve a 128 MB
"/boot" and a 10 - 20 GB chunk on the "outside" of the disk called
"/data", which I can reformat at will with any filesystem I'm in the
mood to test. Since I run openSUSE, the rest of the disk is "/" (20 GB
by default), "/home" (the rest) and swap (some unknown function of RAM
size.)

I think multiple partitions are over-rated, though. If you're just a
"typical Ubuntu user", take the default and enjoy the distro. :)

The Arch Linux Beginner's Guide has a very nice, short but informative
guide to the rationales behind putting various directories on separate
partitions:

http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners_Guide#Partition_Hard_Drives

One or two things mentioned are specific to Arch Linux, but mostly it is
general enough that you can get a good idea about whether you need to
mess with Ubuntu's default partitioning scheme or just accept it as is.

I mention it not because I think you should follow the guide's example,
only because it gives a quick overview of why some people want certain
directories on their own partitions and what they gain from it.  You can
decide whether these things are important to you.

Personally, as another "home" user, I just use separate /, swap,
and /home partitions.  I do keep a lot of my own data on a different
partition (called, are you ready? -- "data"!) so I can access it easily
from any OS I've installed without having to mount the /home/[user]
partition from another distro.  I'm usually dual-booting something or
other because I like to try out distros from time to time.

One thing the guide doesn't go into is a separate /usr/local.  If you
think you might be compiling a lot of apps or otherwise installing
things from outside Ubuntu's repositories, having a separate /usr/local
could be useful, at the very least for ease-of-backup and possibly for
ease-of-distro-upgrades.  OTOH, /usr/local on my Debian installation is
currently populated by entirely empty directories, so for me it would be
a waste of time.  But I have seen various Debian users more advanced
than me recommend putting /usr/local on its own partition, or at least
consider the possible advantages.

Animated GIFs work in open office, but they display slowly and 
jerkily.  They display faster embedded in web pages via Firefox,
but they still look grainy.

Meanwhile, my distro provides an open source package called
"swftools" which includes a tool "png2swf".  I wrote some 
programs in C, linked to libgd, to write animated GIFs, frame
by frame.  Now I am retooling the programs to write PNG frames
to a directory, and combining them with png2swf.  While I 
cannot show SWF movies from within openoffice, I can show them
with Firefox, and I will be building slide shows around that.

You can see one of the animations at:
   http://www.server-sky.com/local/ap02.swf

It shows 20 frames per second (as designed) on my browser.  I am
curious how it does with other browsers or slower computer speeds.

Once loaded, it looks fine (although I don't know how to measure the
fps).  The loading process was very painful though. For locally-hosted
presentations this is probably fine, however, if you need to download
the content, I think it would be worthwhile to keep the animation from
starting until the download is complete.

This is on a reasonably-loaded (load average ~1.5) Athlon 64 3200,
with 2gb of ram and Firefox 3, with dsl (I *think* I'm on dsl...)

Ooops.  Forgot to specify - there are 200 frames in the animation,
20 per second, so it should complete one loop in 10 seconds.  The
little pointer circles around the fake Earth once every 10 seconds,
regular as clockwork on my 2GHz 2Gbyte Thinkpad T30. 

I guess I am spoiled by Verizon FIOS.  The 4mbytes of animation
downloads faster than it displays on my link.  I should try looking
at it someplace with less speedy bandwidth.

Strangely, though, when I present it as part of a wiki page:
    http://www.server-sky.com/ap02
... it is 3x slower, maxing out the CPU on my laptop.  At the tail
end of a longer wiki page:
    http://www.server-sky.com/ToroidalOrbits
... it displays fast.  I am still scratching my head on this one.

As a slide show with local content it will of course be faster,
and folks wanting to download the slide show will probably end
up downloading a zip file with all the pages and images.  One of
those presentations will have half a dozen animations, and may 
run a hundred megabytes or so - it will be a lot less compact 
than an openoffice file.  But it will be portable, and look nice.

Animation of all views looked fine in the latest Firefox installed on
Ubuntu x86_64.

The only other browser I have installed is Opera 9.something. It
couldn't display the animations and instead popped up a dialog box
asking if I wanted to open it in Movie Player (Totem). I tried it, but
Totem threw up an error. Back in Opera I tried again and this time
tried VLC. Again I got an error message.

Linux desktop machine
  Athlon XP 2100+ with 1011.1 MiB running Ubuntu Hardy
  Smooth and steady in Firefox 3.0.10

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acer Aspire 1640Z laptop
  1.7 GHz Pentium with 0.99 GB of RAM running XP Home, Version 2002, SP 3

After re-booting,
  Smooth and steady in:
    Firefox 3.0.10
    Google Chrome 1.0.154.65
    IE 7.0.5730.11

Before re-booting the swf took many seconds to load, and then was jerky 
and slow in both IE and Firefox (didn't try Google Chrome before 
reboot.) After booting, there was no delay, which may mean that each 
browser was running a cached copy, or Comcast was faster delivering the 
file this time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thinkpad 6003 laptop
Pentium II
160 MB RAM
Win 98 SE

Firefox 2.0.0.20
Slow and jerky to load page. Slower and jerkier after page was loaded!

IE 6.0.2800.1106
The swf did not display until page was fully loaded. Then it ran slow 
and jerky.

Good data points.  I think that tells us why there are small format
and large format videos out there.  When I put together presentations
to share over the net, I should make a small/slow as well as a
large/fast version of them, so the folks with the PII's can still
get something out of it.  Openoffice with gif animations must really
drag on that older machine ... thanks for the tests!

I'm sure that's working fine, but my fist thought was "what about svg?"  
I would imagine that this would involve generating javascript (or 
svg 'animate' nodes?) to drive the animation, and it would probably be 
a bit smaller given that the vectors could be manipulated directly (if 
that works -- of course, the adobe flash plugin is likely to behave the 
same everywhere, where SVG support is probably *still* spotty.)

But alas, "good enough" is always the enemy of "better".

I did find a file in /var/log that was partly to blame, I also removed some
un-needed packages. However I'm still trying to figure out where this space
went. Tim mentioned the mount issue which might be a clue, I had a
mountpoint of /backups pointing to an external USB device which was having
issues (turned out to be an issue with the filesystem, I changed from reiser
to ext3 and the problem went away) ... so the question I have, my
understanding is that if /backups was having issues the parent partition
which is / which is a completely different device, it is possible that junk
was getting written to / because of the issue with /backups ? If that is
indeed the case, I'm wondering where I can find that garbage data which is
sucking up space. I have gone through each of the dir's mounted under / and
they don't add up to the amount showing up in df ... I have all my configs
and required packages that I built from source available to me so starting
over wouldn't take very long. I'm just wondering if there is a way to figure
this out before going to that extreme.

Would the fact that the partition was created with 1k blocks instead of 4k
blocks?

Thanks,

if /backups wasn't really mounted for a while and data was written to 
/backups (on /), then you remounted /backups you would see this issue. 
umount /backups and then see if there is data in /backups (on /).  also, 
rather than adding things together you can use the -x switch to du to tell 
it not to cross mountpoints.  so du -sx / will show the space used on / 
without crossing into /home, /backups, etc.

Thanks Joe,
What was happening with /backups using reiserfs was that during the backup
job which is just a simple tar/gz operation every few days the filesystem
would go into read-only mode. So there are just a few $dir.tar.gz's on
/backups. I haven't found anything in / that should be on /backups when
/backups is unmounted. I am seriously considering going forward with a fresh
install even though this install is just over a month old, maybe 2 months
old. I keep adding knowledge and it helps the install get better each time.

My biggest fear of course is some sort of compromise and there was a perl
script attempting to run but I viewed it's source and it didn't appear to be
threatening in any way, I removed it as I don't recall installing it to
begin t ith (it was a script to capture and log failed logins). That said, I
secured the system the same way I have previously and hadn't experienced an
exploit when secured in the way that I am, although this is a multi-user
machine with various bits of web accessible software installed i.e
Wordpress, PHP Gallery and MediaWiki (one user did get hit with wiki spam
and his DB grew to some 8GB in size at one point before I caught it and
stopped the issue.  Pardon my rambling, just thinking outloud.

Cheers,
Drew-

Most monitors just work. I am kind of partial to Samsung monitors.
Good quality for the money. Watch out for those widescreen monitors.
They are everywhere and probably not what you want.

   They all can. Distribution makes no difference.

I'm planning on showing up in a bit, I want to try moving the laptop
from F10 to F11 with preupgrade and figure it'd be easier to do in a
space with Ubuntu disks if it fails completely. :D Is there signage

Hey!  I like my widescreen monitor.  It's not as nice as two monitors 
that height, but the extra width lets you cram more information onto the 
screen.

And Ubuntu handles it just fine.

I did say the widescreen is "probably" not what you want.  The number of
widescreens offered relative to the old squarish aspect ratio just does not
match that probability.  I wish they would advertise the monitors by area,
or even better, total number of pixels, just not by linear distance along
the diagonal. With a bit more truth in advertising fewer widescreen monitors
would be sold.

I'm not so sure about that.  My nephew's #1 criteria for a laptop was "have to
play my music."  Meaning it had to work seamlessly with his iPod.  #2 criteria
was "watch movies."  Widescreen is good for that.

Incidentally this was for the laptop to take to college and use for academics.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0905180814010.15623@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   A long time ago, and an earlier version of opera than the current 9.64, I
was able to find the configuration option to report itself as IE. This was
useful for those MS servers in remote locations who did not like firefox,
particularly on linux.

   I ran into this situation last week in the Melbourne hotel, but did not
have a working copy of Opera installed. Now I have the latest on the
notebook but cannot find where to have it spoof which browser it is.

   If you know where that configuration option is located, please share that
with me.

Thanks,

Rich

apparently there is a file "ua.ini" in the Opera profile directory which you
can edit to change this.

There is truth in advertising, but we apparently aren't interested in 
it.  Widescreen displays appear to be based upon XGA standards, so your 
vertical resolution is very near 768 or 800 pixels.  Having become used 
to the real estate offered by standard screens that support SXGA and 
SXGA+, and being one of the few that don't buy computers to watch 
movies, I'm rather disappointed in widescreen monitor performance.

Now, two SXGA displays seamlessly side by side would be my idea of 
widescreen.

Subject: [PLUG] Search Firefox bookmarks by tags?
Message-ID: <1242678195.4578.38.camel@drifter.rosewoodpdx.org>

I feel like I'm being dense, so I hope someone can help.

A while back I switched from using del.icio.us to xmarks (formerly
foxmarks) for bookmark syncronization.  One thing I really like about
del.icio.us is the tag-based search, which I find more convenient and
easier to manage than dividing bookmarks into folders.  I got into the
habit of tagging all my bookmarks, usually with multiple tags.  I use
generic tags like "gtk," "sysadmin," "console," or "tutorial" as broad
limiters, and use more specific tags to drill down to what I'm looking
for.  I do this for non-technical stuff also, like if I'm planning a
trip to Powell's I can search for "books" + "shopping" for a list of my
bookmarks (reviews and whatnot) about books I might want to buy.  If I
decide I can't afford all those books, I can pick some to queue at the
library, and change the "shopping" tag to "library."

Anyway, I'm having trouble replicating that without del.icio.us because
I can't figure out how to limit Firefox's bookmark search to just the
tag field.  Any search returns a bookmark that has the particular term
anywhere in any field (title, description, location, etc.).  Xmarks
doesn't seem to be able to do this either.  Is this really not possible,
or am I just missing something?

I did find some add-ons that might be helpful, like this one:

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/998#reviews

If FF needs an add-on to enable this kind of searching, does anyone have
any recommendations?

I didn't buy a widescreen monitor for watching movies, either.  I
wanted to be able to put two 80 column text windows side by side and
not have one covered by the other.  I bought a Samsung 2343BWX.  It is
a 23" diagonal screen with a resolution of 2048x1152.  According to the
Display Resolution menu command in Fedora 10, that's exactly what it's
doing, too.  And I can have my side-by-side windows.  (It's a really
pretty display, to boot.)

But you've got all that bezel and frame stuff between them!  That's not
seamless to my eyes!  :-)  :-)

It would depend on the codec being used. There are a bunch of codecs  
that can be stuffed into a WMV.

In VLC there's a media information pop up that displays the codec,  
resolution, etc. This may prove helpful.

you probably need a package called something like "win32codecs" (or
"win64codecs").  What distro are you using?  If ubuntu, check out:

i've found an interesting tradeoff between screen real-estate (in sheer 
number of pixels) and monitor/pixel size. My primary use is running 
Eclipse and other development tools, plus the usual web/email/office 
stuff; i rarely watch movies.My personal laptop has a 17" display with 
native resolution of 1920 x 1200. My 24" deskop monitor at work has the 
same pixel dimensions but larger pixels. Both are quite sharp and easy 
on the eyes - i squeeze a little more effective size out of the larger 
one by using smaller fonts. At the office, i tried using a second 
1200x1024 monitor but found that the amount of head-turning required to 
use both  displays was uncomfortable. Two 17" 1920 x 1200 displays might 
be interesting, but a single large display + gnome's multiple desktops 
feels more ergonomic than any other setup i've tried.

If an application insists on operating at full screen with no resize 
options, I would want to have a monitor that can accept two video 
inputs, like from a dual-head card.  A full-screen app would then take 
up on more than half the screen, but I could still expand a wide 
application across both halves.  Is this what you mean by "side-by-side 
windows"?

Right, but I wasn't talking two monitors.  I would want to see one large 
panel, driven by a dual-head card.  For me, that would be the best of 
both the widescreen and dual display worlds.

It depends upon what player you're using.  Totem uses the gstreamer
framework, so to play it with Totem you would need (most likely) the
gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg plugin.  You should check which gstreamer packages
you have installed.  If you're using GNOME, most likely you'll want, at
least:

gstreamer0.10-alsa
gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg
gstreamer0.10-gnomevfs
gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad
gstreamer0.10-plugins-base
gstreamer0.10-plugins-base-apps
gstreamer0.10-plugins-good
gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly
gstreamer0.10-pulseaudio (Only if you use PulseAudio)

Others should already be installed (and probably some of those are
already installed).

If you want to use mplayer or VLC, then I believe you need one of the
codecs packages, as Tim said.  Those players don't use gstreamer.

Debian has pretty amazing multimedia compatibility now.  The only
"unofficial" package I installed from the debian-multimedia repository
was flashplayer-mozilla, for flash video.  Even without the codecs
package, totem has played everything I've thrown at it, so far -- wmv,
mp4, mov, avi, and so on.  Haven't done the silverlight/moonlight thing
yet -- there doesn't seem to be much compelling content that requires
it.

And I have the flu, and bringing Mr. Projector to a meeting tomorrow
night will be difficult.  Wednesday June 19 is Open Source Bridge
BOF sessions.  Wednesday July 15 is open, but July 16 is Ignite
Portland #6.  I propose we cancel both May and June. 

If this is OK with folks, Tony Rick or I can call Roots and
cancel these two meetings later today (Tuesday).  

Would somebody please help Alan out here?  I will keep bringing
the projector, but between the Clinic and Server Sky I have a
full plate.  Perhaps somebody can volunteer to be guest moderator
for July.  Does anybody need a resume bullet point, and an
excuse to interact with local companies and interesting projects,
or do you all have guaranteed lifetime employment?

We can also retarget the meeting.  A single topic hands-on
workshop (configure incoming openssh, apache, etc.) might be
interesting, where we help each other work with one specific tool
each month.  SSH first, so we don't have to drag in our servers
to subsequent meetings.

Hmmm ... maybe two clinics a month and no advanced topics? That way we
could have four-hour hands-on shots at something like wpa_supplicant,
apache, blktrace, oprofile or systemtap. Can we get FreeGeek on two
Sundays? Open Tech Space?

   This is a continuation of my previous thread on why the mail log summary
script fails to run. It didn't all last week while I was away and still
doesn't run.

   The context: The actual perl script, /usr/local/bin/pflogsumm, installed
without the .pl extension, runs without error when invoked from the command
line by root. The shell script that is supposed to call that script and mail
the results to me is called /etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm. The output of this
is the error log called by the 'set -x' command, although it does not write
that to the designated filename, but to stdout. I copied that to a file so I
can show you the results.

   /etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm has 67 lines:

#!/bin/sh
#
# /etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm
#
# This file is run on a daily basis to analyse your mail logs.
#
# The file is named "1pflogsumm" to ensure that it is run before logrotate
# when the /var/log/maillog files are rotated.
#
# The file is also flagged by rpm as a configuration file, so if you modify
# it, further upgrades to pflogusmm will not be overwriten.
#

   The syntax error is on the line following the last line of the script. My
naive understanding of the script is that /etc/postfix/pfls.tmp.xxxxx is the
filename only if Date::Calc is _not_ installed, yet the latest version (5.4)
is installed here.

   Obviously (to me, at least) the reason the results of 1pflogsumm are not
mailed to me is that the script terminates abnormally, but I fail to see why
that is.

   We have an elite group of highly experienced SysAdmins here so I believe
that the reason will be more visible to one of you than it is to me. The
problem is not the perl script, but the calling shell script.

TIA,

Rich

Hey :)

It looks like it might be missing a matching parenthesis. Notice how
line 61 has an opening parens, but there is no matching closing
parens?

I'm not certain why the opening parenthesis is even there. My shell
scripting is a little rusty, though. I would try either removing the
opener on line 61, or add a ')' on line 68.

Heath,

   That was a good catch; I missed that.

   Now the script log shows no error, but it's still not calling the perl
script. When I invoke the script it returns immediately to the command line
(no time spent processing the mail log), and nothing is mailed to me.

   This is much more complicated to fix without an explicit error condition
shown.

send the script log again now that you've fixed the error.

   Looks just fine; nothing shows up in my inbox.

   I wonder if this is related to the apparent procmail issue I'm still
fighting: postfix reports it handed off an incoming message to procmail,
procmail has nothing in its log, the message is not delivered ... Apparently
not. I see no message from root to me since 06:09am today.

i just looked over the script again, and no where does it actually invoke 
pflogsumm.  are you sure you correctly copied the script?  that open paren 
probably was to contain the cat, running the program, maybe some other 
gunk and then it would have all been piped to sendmail.  can you go double 
check that something didn't eat your program?

Try removing the '2>/dev/null' portion from the line in the script and 
rerun.  I script seems to be testing if Date::Calc exists and 'if not' 
do some other stuff.  What are the results of perl -d 'use Date::Calc'.

Also check of you have multiple versions of Perl installed.  You logged 
in as root may have a different path than cron does so gets the "Wrong 
Perl". (Apologies to Nick Park)

Rod,

   Yes, I saw that it's testing for the existance of Date::Calc and doesn't
seem to do anything specific if it's not there. But, the module exists so I
ignored that. Removing '2>/dev/null' makes no difference.

   What are the results of perl -d 'use Date::Calc'.

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ perl -d 'use Date::Calc'
Can't open perl script "use Date::Calc": No such file or directory

   No, only one /usr/bin/perl and nothing otherwise.

Thanks,

Rich

Message-ID: <D04DAF1C0FD50A4F96F51B5AF2E8922DE04919@BWPW05.f2.enterprise>

Hi All
I am trying to determine the amount of RAM a whole series of procs take
up on my system..
So when I use unix top command for instance..I see that my system has
100GB RAM and 30GB Free..
Then playing around with top ordering I can see which PID is using the
most amount of RAM..

Now when I use the unix ps command such as ps -elf I get a listing of
every single process running in the system and when I sum up the SZ
column of all the PIDS that are returned I get aprox. 40GB in use by the
system.  If I use the top numbers I should have about 70GB of RAM in
use, but via the ps method I can only "locate" about 40 GB is use.  I
don't expect these two methods to give exactly the same results but I am
surprised that they are 30GB about in value!
Might anyone out there offer me some clues on how to better understand
where the 30GB of RAM happens to be in "use"?!
Thanks!
Dan

May it be that the extra ram is being cached by the kernel but not in
use that's why you don't see it in ps?

i bet you mean MB, not GB.  otherwise you have a very nice computer :-).

which column are you adding up in top?  it has virtual, resident, and 
shared memory columns.  ps can display all those values as well, i'm not 
sure which value it shows by default since the man page shows that SZ can 
mean two different things.  in any case, they are both getting their data 
from /proc somewhere, but just are displaying different views of that 
info.

Joe,

   I also see that the script checks for /usr/local/bin/pflogsumm, but
thought it then called that in lines 52 or 59. Turns out it is much later --
at the end of the script.

   Originally there was more after the EOF about missing Date::Calc. Since
that's installed here I removed those lines and, apparently, the closing
parenthesis. And, as it turns out, I cut out too much. The missing lines
are:

LC_TIME=C ${EXECUTABLE} ${OPTIONS} ${LOGFILE} 2>/dev/null
echo "Report ended with status: $?" ) | ${SENDMAIL} ${SENDMAIL_OPTS}

which also fixes the missing closing parenthesis.

   A test run worked. However, those missing lines were in the script until I
took them out this morning, and the script still doesn't run each day as it
should.

   Thanks very much for prompting me to look more closely at what I cut out.
I'll see if the script runs tomorrow. If not, I'll be back and post the
error log again.

Rich

If you really wanted to speed up the troubleshooting process, add a cron job
entry to
execute it every five minutes ( or some such to allow you to look at the
logs and make changes).

Larry,

   Now that's a good thought! I can do it manually, too, and see if I find
anything in the way of an error.

Thanks,

OOPS! My bad.  Should be with a -e like in the script.

OK well the logic on the perl line has an order.  I just tried a test 
and what is happening is if the Date::Calc module is there don't do the 
(anonymous) sub/function.

perl -e 'use Date::Calc' || { echo hello; }

does nothing.

perl -e 'use Date::XXX' || { echo hello; }

gets

Can't locate Date/XXX.pm in @INC (@INC contains:

So the script is saying if the Date::Calc module is _missing_ then set 
stuff up to run and run pflogsumm.pl

 From my copy of pflogsumm there is these lines

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

     Pflogsumm requires the Date::Calc module, which can be obtained from
     CPAN at http://www.perl.com.

The logic seems backwards.  I think you should try changing the logic 
from an 'or (||)' to an 'and (&&)'

# perl -e 'use Date::Calc;' 2>/dev/null || {
perl -e 'use Date::Calc;' 2>/dev/null && {

the script is trying to determine if date::calc is installed, and if not 
then it is stripping some code out of the perl script and updating the 
EXECUTABLE var to point to the temporary script.  nothing needs to be 
changed in that section.

Sorry again.  I didn't read the documentation above that.

It is still an oddity.  Why in the world would you modify a 
program/script on the fly.  Just require that the module be installed.

I admin 10+ (ran out of fingers and my shoes are on) mail servers all 
running pflogsumm and the shell script does not futz with pflogsumm.pl. 
  If for some reason Date::Calc or any other module wasn't installed 
during the OS installation it got installed.

I'm going to have to go look at the source distribution of Pflogsumm as 
I run CentOS and pflogsumm comes from a RPM package.  Maybe that's why 
I've never had problems even when upgrading CentOS or coming from a 
Fedora install.

Rod,

   The docs mention that Date::Calc is required and that most current
distributions include it. I think the check is like our appendix: left over
from earlier evolutionary times and no longer necessary.

   I've not had problems until a month or so ago. I've used pflogsumm since
1998 (or 1999) and received a mailed report each day. Why it stopped its
daily run is what I'm trying to find.

Thanks,

Rich

Was there anything else updated/upgraded around that time.  I remember 
some of that original thread but there didn't seem to be.  Being kind of 
pragmatic I'd drop the problem script and either write my own or use the 
cronjob examples in the script possibly with those extra OPTIONS in 
1pflogsumm.

One thing I've had done is run the report just after midnight for the 
previous day using the '-d yesterday' switch.  Let's me know what 
happened the day before and watch for trends.  But there are scripts 
that run on each of the mail servers that monitor the queues and send an 
alert via a SMS gateway when they exceed some set level.

Good luck with find what is causing the problem.  There are days I 
_really_ hate computers!

Message-ID: <F0A99B7D-C98D-45B7-B23C-FC984637B51C@gummydrops.com>

Hi all,

I often get emails that are way too long. I'd like to "twitterize" my  
email and limit senders to a set number of characters. I believe I can  
achieve this with procmail and a Bash script but I can't figure out  
how to do the test in procmail and make it bounce with a friendly  
message.

I thought the script could look something like this

#/bin/bash

charCount=`wc -m`

if [[ $charCount -gt 200 ]]; then
   exit 1	
fi

exit 0


Then make procmail deliver the message if exit code is 0 and bounce if  
1.

I've never used a dual-head setup.  That said, though, I think it would
depend on your application. For general use, I imagine you're right, it
would get to be uncomfortable.  But for certain specialized apps, I
think the dual-head setup would be quite useful.  At work, one of the
PCB designers has such a setup.  One screen is dedicated to the actual
layout graphics.  That's all that's displayed, and it's where the
designer spends the bulk of his time. The other screen has the usual
Windows stuff, plus the control window(s) for the CAD package.  Only
occasionally does he have to use that one.  (Multiple desktops on one
screen, ala Gnome or Enlightenment, would work just as well, I'm sure.)

No, it isn't.  I meant something like two shell windows, or an editor
and a PS/PDF viewer window, tiled horizontally on the screen.  (Frankly,
I think any application that won't let me resize its window is broken,
and I'd probably get rid of it.  Even on Windows I haven't seen that
sort of nonsense in a long time.  If you're stuck having to use
something like that, you have my sympathies.)

Ah, now that's an arrangement I've not heard of before; it sounds
interesting.  Unfortunately, there's only one DVI port on my
Samsung, so I can't experiment.

so the cards are shiny and slick and the ink doesn't rub off.
I will bring some to the PLUG general meeting on June 4, and
we can pass them out at Open Source Bridge in mid-June.

I know mint as an end-user perspective since I use it.

Mint takes the base release from Ubuntu and makes it usable immediately.
They've made the choice to include proprietary software and drivers where it
makes sense from an end user perspective.

Pretty darn clean installation, and I love the fact that it just works.  I
use the Fluxbox version, which has been trimmed down, but I stil find it
usable with the right amount of software by default, and I love their
MintInstall application (apt frontend).

That said, it's not for everyone.  FSF & open source purists would frown
upon the choice to include proprietary drivers.

Just my .02.  YMMV.

I've used Mint for two years, its very nice, but if you want Ubuntu with
everything installed out of the box, go with Super OS:
http://hacktolive.org/wiki/Super_OS
It's Ubuntu 9.04 w/ all codecs and flash ready to go.

   After spending time futzing with this yesterday, and following Rod's
suggestion of periodically running the script, it worked again this morning.
This has happened before: the script runs daily for a while, then ceases.

   I wonder if it's something to do with cron rather than the shell script,
1pflogsumm. None of this makes sense to me. The script works, then it
doesn't, then it does again.

   Anyway, it ran as scheduled so we'll see what happens in the future.
Certainly a consumption of time better spent, and without definite
resolution by finding a specific cause.

Thank you all,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] Mounting a Winders drive with USB
Message-ID: <4A158357.7040404@comcast.net>

I have a 30 GB Maxtor drive installed in a USB case. I successfully 
backed up some files from my XP laptop to that drive through the XP's 
USB port. Then, I tried to mount the drive on my Ubuntu desktop. I get 
the following error message:

-----------------------------------------------------------
Cannot mount volume.

Unable to mount the volume.

Details
$LogFile indicates unclean shutdown (, 1) Failed to mount '/dev/sdc1': 
Operation not supported Mount is denied because NTFS is marked to be in 
use. Choose one action: Choice 1: If you have Wihndows then disconnect 
the external devices by clickon on the 'Safely Remove Hardware' icon in 
the Windows taskbar then shutdown Windows cleanly. Choice 2: If you 
don't have Windows then you can use the 'force' option for your own 
responsibility. For example type on the command line: mount -t ntfs-3g 
/dev/sdc1 /media/disk -o force   Or add the option to the relevant row 
in the /etc/fstab file: /dev/sdc1 /media/disk/ntfs -3g force 0 0

-------------------------------------------------------------

This may be the first time I've tried to use this drive on my Ubuntu 
machine. Other drives I've successfully shared via the USB case have not 
been NTFS. Do I need to plug the drive back into the XP laptop and do 
something special to "close" it before disconnecting the USB cable? BTW, 
there is no OS on the drive, just a handful of files and lots of blank 
space.

it sounds like you didn't use the 'remove safely' option before yanking 
the drive.  i'd suggest hooking it up, run a chkdsk (via the 
properties->tools->repair option), then make sure you do the 'remove 
safely' magic (can't recall if xp has that directly in the right click 
menu or if you have to use the removable drives thing in the task tray). 
after that, ubuntu should be happier.

but if you'll be moving this around a lot and have no real need for ntfs, 
you might want to reformat as fat32.

My only gripe with Linux Mint was the way it handled upgrades, or rather
didn't.  This was circa ~ a year ago.

Subject: [PLUG] Wireless Card Firmware Question
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0905211039260.1952@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   The PCMCIA wireless card I have for my notebook uses the Prism54 chip set.
It used to use the isl3890 firmware which was installed in either
/etc/hotplug/firmware/ or /lib/firmware. Since my clean upgrade to
Slackware-12.2, that firmware file has gone. So are the /etc/hotplug/ and
/lib/firmware/ directories

   Looking at the p54 firmware site I see that for pci/PCMCIA adapters on
kernels older than 2.6.28 there is an isl3886 firmware version but not an
isl3890 firmware.

   My questions are: whether the isl3886 will work with my card and where I
should install that file if I download it.

The Ubuntu 9.04 desktop image is fairly small compared to Linux Mint
Universal.  I thought main wasn't for me because I want to put this
on an ftp site.  I run CentOS 5.3, but it doesn't keep up with the
latest Mesa drivers and so it doesn't support a lot of programs.
I tried googling for some comparisons between Ubuntu and CentOS
and I have to say a comment that CentOS is for people who want
Redhat Enterprise Linux that can't afford it rings true, but RHE
seems to be so far behind Ubuntu.  I realize that an enterprise
class system may not need to be on the cutting edge graphics wise,
but that is assuming that it isn't an X server.  Yeah, I'm one
to stick with the same Linux installation for a couple of years,
but frankly I find CentOS's antiquated Mesa annoying.  I also find
it annoying that a lot of old programs one wants to run under WINE
won't work on CentOS because of the Mesa issue.

As far as the updates issue, if you replace with a new release every
6 months there is no need to update.

I guess comparing Fedora to Ubuntu would be more of an apples to 
apples comparison as would comparing Fedora to Mint.

One program I've had particular difficulty with is the original 
release of Red Alert Command and Conquer which was programmed 
for Windows 95.  I tried wine, it would install but not run.  
I tried openredalert and another defunct project, they don't 
work.  I tried Windows 98SE on top of vmware workstation 6.  
That didn't work.  I finally installed it on an old computer 
running 98SE natively.  98SE, even with the open source service 
pack, is annoying because it crashes a lot.  

I have the original Warcraft running under freedos natively which 
is nice because it runs full screen.  I'm assuming that Warcraft I 
is abandonware, but that is somewhat risky.  I don't recommend 
running freedos on anything that is older than a Pentium, I had 
problems getting fdupdate to work on a 486.  Switching between
freedos and Windows 98 is somewhat annoying, but it turns out I
needed to install my SB16 PCI card under 98 in order to get my
hands on the driver for freedos.  I wish the freedos community
would replace Windows 98 with something that runs on top of 
freedos, but who knows when let alone if that's going to happen.
I'm more concerned about how long it is taking for Freedos 1.1
to come out.

I'm interested in Ubuntu and Mint from the standpoint of will WINE
work better and will I be free from having to resort to running
Freedos or Windows 98SE natively?  Some problems like dosbox not
wanting to go full screen are probably unsolvable.  Ideally, some
of these popular dos and Windows games get cloned.  Sadly, the
freecraft project for example got crushed.  There is ReactOS, but
it is a clone of NT which has never been a good choice for 
Windows 9x/dos games.  ReactOS probably won't reach beta this 
year :-(  My concern about ReactOS is that in newsletter after
newsletter the word seems to be, we are replacing this or we are
replacing that and running into trouble because we broke xyz.
They are trying to program in the dark, how successful can they
be?

I am likely to be moving it between XP and Ubuntu, and I have no real 
need for ntfs, so I followed your advice and reformatted the drive as 
fat32. Now it mostly works as expected. The only thing that happens is 
that I get an error message about Windows not writing all of the data. 
Sounds like there needs to be a way to flush a buffer. On the other 
hand, everything I wanted copied, was successfully copied. I'm not sure 
what wasn't. I didn't recognize the path name mentioned (and, sorry, I 
didn't write that one down).

Thanks for the recommendation on fat32.

you should still use the 'remove safely' option as much as you can to 
avoid unflushed buffers.  fat32 is just less prone to corruption from not 
doing that.

it is either on the right click menu for the drive (vista has it, can't 
recall if xp does).  or you should have a removable device icon in your 
task tray and if you left clikc on it, it should have options to remove 
each kind of removable device on your system.

You can also just leave the volume formatted with ext and use ext2fsd, which
is a driver for windows to let it understand the ext file system. I use it
on mine and it works very well. I've had a few issues with a couple file
names that linux wrote and windows wouldn't erase, but all I had to do was
boot back to linux and take care of it through there.

That has been the only issue for me in a few years of using it. It's used
daily, and for me has been absolutely reliable.

Oops, just forgot one other issue. For a class I'm taking I had to install
Visual C++, and for some odd reason the installer tried to grab the ext
drive and use it as a temporary place to keep the uncompressed install files
during the install, but there was something that didn't work quite right and
it failed every time on the install. After a few hours of Google I found
that the ext drive was the likely culprit, and after disabling it via the
ext2fsd control panel the installer decided to use the C: drive for temp
files and everything was good. That was annoying, but once I tracked it down
very easy to deal with. Now that the program is installed it has no further
issues with the drive.

So it's really a decent choice, but if you have it working well enough with
fat32 then ???

Subject: [PLUG] Mail log reporting: cron issue?
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0905220613420.23445@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Each time I think the mail log reporting issue is resolved I find that it
is not.

   Yesterday I received one of the two reports, today none. Both days the
results of the 'set' command was mailed to me showing that the process
supposedly ran and exited with the success code of '0'. That the 19th line
of /etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm (set -x > log_error.txt 2>&1) is processed by
the shell and the results e-mailed to me suggests that the 1pflogsumm script
has actually been run, but the mailed report has not been appended to my
INBOX (/var/spool/mail/rshepard).

   I can manually run /usr/local/bin/pflogsumm (using the options in the
shell script)and the report is written to stdout; did so just now. However,
today I cannot manually run /etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm; yesterday I could.

   This all leads me to believe that the problem is primarily with invoking
the shell script. Why the results of the set command are delivered to my
inbox while the results of the rest of the script are not makes on sense to
me. Here are relevant entries from the procmail log:

>From root at salmo.appl-ecosys.com  Thu May 21 00:02:02 2009
  Subject: salmo Daily Mail Report for Thursday, 21 May 2009
   Folder: /var/spool/mail/rshepard

>From root at salmo.appl-ecosys.com  Thu May 21 00:02:06 2009
  Subject: cron: /etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm

>From root at salmo.appl-ecosys.com  Fri May 22 00:02:06 2009
  Subject: cron: /etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm
   Folder: /var/spool/mail/rshepard

   The first entry is /etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm run from root's crontab. The
second entry is the log_error.txt mailed from that invocation of the script.
While other scripts in /etc/cron.daily ran at 04:40 yesterday, 1pflogsumm
did not.

   The third entry is the log_error.tex from this morning's invocation of
1pflogsumm in root's crontab, not the usual daily run of all scripts at
04:40.

   None of this makes sense to me as it is inconsistent. What more can I do
to test to try to find what's happening? Is it a cron issue somehow? I am
stymied and frustrated that this cannot be quickly resolved.

i can't recall if you have checked /var/log/cron to see if cron thinks it 
is running things?  and do you see entries in /var/log/maillog at the 
appropriate times?

I haven't been following this little adventure of yours all that closely, so
please forgive me if this has been suggested before.

What about putting a statement in the 1pflogsumm script itself to log to a
file each time it is run? You could stick something like the following near
the beginning:

echo $(date) >> /tmp/1pflogsumm.log

Then at least you can eliminate cron as a possible suspect.

Then we can start expanding what gets logged from the script. And someday
you will be logging so much, that we'll have to create a script to summarize
the log for you. it'll be called 2pflogsummlogsumm and we can begin the
whole process over again!

And, there are plenty of fellows in Estacada who will be more than happy 
to help with that logging. Just watch out for the protests if you start 
logging the old growth.

Joe,

   Nothing is sent to /var/log/cron; all to /var/log/messages. Yes, I do see
entries in /var/log/maillog that are from root and appear to be at the
proper time ... when a message appears in my inbox.

Wes,

   Joe suggested this a few weeks ago and there is such a statement:

set -x  > log_error.txt 2>&1

   It runs, the log_error.txt file is mailed to me (so commands further in
the script are processed), and it reports the script exited successfully.

> Then at least you can eliminate cron as a possible suspect.

   All other scripts in /etc/cron.daily (such as logrotate, logwatch, and
slocate) run each day as expected.

   I think -- and may well be wrong in my thinking -- that the key questions
are:

   1) Why does cron sometimes run the script from root's crontab at 00:02 but
not from within /etc/cron.daily at 04:40; sometimes the latter but not the
former; sometimes both; sometimes none.

   2) Why, when the script is run, the log_error report is mailed to me but
the actual mail log summary report is not.

   From what I see in the mail log and procmail log, if the error log and/or
log summary reports are run they are mailed to me and properly placed in my
inbox.

Thanks,

Rich

are there entries in /var/log/maillog that are not reflected in your 
procmail log?  is cron actually logging in messages?  do you see things 
like:

May 22 03:01:01 charon crond[12717]: (root) CMD (run-parts /etc/cron.hourly)
May 22 04:01:01 charon crond[12832]: (root) CMD (run-parts /etc/cron.hourly)

And you even stated as much in the first paragraph of your earlier email.
Sorry. But this does just about eliminate the cron daemon itself from the
list of suspects - its responsibility is only as far as invoking the script.

Right, but if the question is "why is cron running every script but this
one?" Now we can say for certain that the answer is "cron IS running this
script, but this script itself is failing."

Again, you are focusing on cron here. If the set -x output appears during
each invocation, then cron is indeed running the script, and you need to
look within the script itself for the problem. As in, more logging.

  2) Why, when the script is run, the log_error report is mailed to me but

This is a good question. I don't have an answer, but generally, logging
helps. Also, in cases like this, I have found that the shell environment in
which it is running can make a big difference. This can be different when
running from cron, like envronment variables could be different, permissions
could be different (as it's running as a different user), or any number of
other things. set -x can show you some of this stuff, which we'd have to see
differential reports between when it works and doesn't in order to tell
(which you've probably sent before, but I didn't look, and can't be bothered
to search my archives right now).

  From what I see in the mail log and procmail log, if the error log and/or

Is the error log ever not mailed to you when it should be?

   Not with these, as far as I can tell. I have another issue with some
incoming messages (from three specific domains so far) that are logged in
/var/log/maillog as passed to procmail, but the procmail log does not have
them and they are not delivered to me. I went looking for this situation in
the mail logs this morning and didn't see anything relevant.

> May 22 03:01:01 charon crond[12717]: (root) CMD (run-parts /etc/cron.hourly)
> May 22 04:01:01 charon crond[12832]: (root) CMD (run-parts /etc/cron.hourly)
> May 22 04:02:01 charon crond[12842]: (root) CMD (run-parts /etc/cron.daily)
> May 22 04:02:01 charon anacron[12848]: Updated timestamp for job `cron.daily' to 2009-05-22

   I have nothing in /etc/cron.hourly. In /etc/cron.daily I have:

[root at salmo ~]# ls /etc/cron.daily/
0logwatch@     certwatch*     makewhatis.cron*  tmpwatch*
1pflogsumm*    slocate*       tripwire-check*   logrotate*
tetex.cron*

   As far as I can tell, everything but 1pflogsumm runs successfully each
day. The logwatch and mail log summary results are the only ones designated
to be mailed.

Wes,

   That's the path I was following until I hit a dead end.

   I will look for options on the 'set' command to learn what additional
output can be produced.

   The problem is that set -x sends its reports with exit code 0 regardless
of the mail log summary itself being run and mailed to me. For example, I
just ran /etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm from the command line. The results of
'set -x' immediately appeard in the terminal. However, neither this result
nor the mail log summary is in my inbox.

> Is the error log ever not mailed to you when it should be?

   Sometimes.

   This is what is so aggrevating: no consistency anywhere.

you wouldn't see the email for the set -x output, that only happens when 
run via cron because stdout/stderr is emailed to you.  does that log 
output you just got show that the real pglogsum is being run?  if you have 
that output still, paste it to us.

Joe,

i forgot that the main script is running sendmail directly, pflogsum 
doesn't do that.  so you should always get email from running that script, 
even if pflogsum produced no output.  you should also see an entry in 
maillog for that sendmail invocation.  tweak your script and add -v to 
SENDMAIL_OPTS so you can see what it has to say about things.

Joe,

   I think this points to procmail as the issue:

   ~/procmail/log has no entries between 10:11 and 10:21 this morning.

   So, this is the procmail issue with which Kurt and I have been wrestling.
Certain senders seem to cause procmail to fail delivery. It seems definite
now that that's where the problem lies. _Why_ 1pflogsumm reports, mail from
gte.net, united.com, and a company domain are not delivered when almost
anything else is delivered is particulary bothersome. I've no idea of mail
that hasn't been delivered when I was not expecting it.

do you have a LOGFILE line as the very first thing in your .procmailrc?

i'd put the LOGFILE first (and make it a full path, not dependent on any 
other vars).  it truly seems unlikely that anything before that would 
cause a failure, but let's be paranoid.  the next line should be the 
VERBOSE=on.

Joe,

   Did this, ran the script from the command line, and the report ran with
results mailed to me. This is not definitive because yesterday it ran from
the command line, too.

   Let's let this sit a few days and see if both invocations work each day.
Moving the lines in ~/.procmailrc may have had coinsided with the script
deciding to run.

Thank you,

Rich

I've installed Jaunty on a Latitude D610 and pretty much everything

and it's failing to recompile when I invoke /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup.

I didn't have this problem on my desktop machine, also running Jaunty.  
Any thoughts?

Do you have the kernel headers installed?

(package: linux-headers-`uname -r`, I think.)

changing that line shouldn't have any impact on running, but should at 
least cause logging to get enabled as soon as possible.  in fact, add a 
line:

LOG="In my procmail"

right after the LOGFILE line, which will force a log entry as soon as the 
script starts.

I know this is not strictly Linux, but this is one of the few local tech 
mailing lists I am on, or am aware of, so please excuse...

Does anyone have any good/bad/indifferent to report about in-Portland 
co-location facilities? I need two cabinets of real estate for some Linux 
servers (there's the on-topic part) and an AS/400.

We need to be able to get to them quickly, in the event of emergency, so 
close-in is best. We also need to be able to service the AS/400 daily for 
tape and diaper changes, so the Integra/Tyco/Tata facility above the Whole 
Foods is *NOT* an option, since they have just implemented some pretty 
jackass access restrictions which is why I'm looking to move.

John,

Be forwarned that my opinion is biased, since I work for ViaWest, a
colocation/manager service provider in Hillsboro.

>From my experience you have a couple choices.  EasyStreet is great for
smaller businesses or individuals with bigger budgets.  Access is convenient
from what I've been told.  The company I used to work for used them with
pretty good success.

For medium to large business, albeit a bit out of the way if you want to
stick to Portland proper, ViaWest might be worth looking at, 24/7/365
access, and we have "tape" rates for quite a few customers which means we
can do the daily rotations and offsiting (Ususally working with an outside
vendor for off-site storage).  We also provide 1 hour "remote hands" per
month for all of our customers, so if there is something quick that needs to
be done, we can hook up a monitor and do it for you.

...and our support just rocks ;) (Hey, I warned you, I'm biased!)

If you need something closer to Portland, you might inquire with whatever
colocation vendor you look at to see if they have something like a tape
rotation rate.  I wouldn't be surprised if other facilities are going that
way.

I am in a cabinet with Infinity Internet across from the Pittock. They
had a few hiccups in the last couple of years with power but it seems
to have been fixed. Last blip was over a year ago. I'm happy with the
service and access, however they have jacked rates up recently or so I
am told by the person who donates the cab space to me. 24/7 keycard
access.

There is the PIX at the Pittock on the 4th floor which provides 24/7
access although I don't know pricing. VSNL is over on Burnside close
in and they have good connectivity to the outside world. Those are the
3 close in sites I'm aware of off the top of my head.

Cheers,
Drew

I forgot to check for the headers, but they are installed.  I 
reinstalled for grins but that didn't help.  But semaphore.h does exist, 
it's in usr/include[/bite] and 
/usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.28-11[-generic]/include/linux.  I suppose I 
could link it.  I'm not a coder so it will take me a moment or two.

But thanks for the suggestion, Rogan.

The kernel headers are still the problem
You are  missing
asm/semaphore.h:
not linux/semaphore.h
It seems asm/semaphore.h was deprecated and disappeared in the 2.6.27 kernel

http://groups.google.com/group/linux.debian.bugs.dist/browse_thread/thread/b17987cdc2b4b7c5
I think one way of temporarily fixing this without patching the virtualbox
source is to find asm/semaphore.h in an
older kernel header tree and copy it into your current kernel header tree.
Or, maybe there is a newer version of Virtualbox out there where this has
been fixed?

another biased suggestion.  i am one of the owners of spiretech.com.  we 
have 24 hour access, can do tape swaps mon-fri, and we're in goose hollow

Thanks to Bill suggesting that Vbox needed to be updated, I checked and, 
indeed, I had installed version 1.6.  My bad, since I have a copy 
locally and that's what was installed.  Replacing it with the current 
version solved my problems.  Now to delete that old file...

Thanks all,

we use sungard (formerly inflow) at nw 12th and northrup--darn
convenient for you & me (until i move to the east side in august
anyway) for those late night visits.

they're rock solid, hipaa/pci compliant (which
keycard-without-staff-signing-you-in places probably aren't, if i read
the PCI spec right), and the service is generally good--no power or
net downtime in the year and a half i've been seeing them.  some of
their additional customer services are not so hot (tivoli backups, for
instance), but it sounds like you have that under manual control
anyway.

not too ridiculously expensive once you take out the managed services
aspect (which is on my plate to do in the next few months before we
renew our contract).

i'm not certain if i can take just anyone in there (who is a US
citizen anyway), but am happy to ask and anyway they'd probably give
you a tour if you asked.  and did i mention, conveniently located? =)

I have an associate who consults for a living. He would
like objective feedback from a variety of other IT folks
so he can present his customer with recommendations that
are considered to be industry best practices. He would
appreciate it if knowledgeable IT people could comment
on the following items using language that he can
present to his customer. You could send me the comments
directly if you wish if this is not an appropriate topic
for this list. Thanks in advance.

Ed

1. The customer wants users to be able to contribute content
    to their Web server, which runs Apache and MySQL on Linux.
    Most of the time, this means users saving PDF documents
    to the Web server so other users can access them via their
    browsers.

    He has Samba running and has configured the Web site's
    DocumentRoot to be a Samba share. Every user in the
    company can now access all the Web site data. The
    MySQL tables are not in DocumentRoot but there are PHP
    files in the DocumentRoot that access the tables. I'm
    guessing he thinks he'll control security by only mapping
    drive letters for certain users.

    I mentioned to the customer that this is a significant
    security issue and that there are more secure ways for
    users to contribute content but he is unconvinced (see
    item 2).

2. The customer ignores security issues because:

a) He claims they are on a "private network"; they are safe.
    The Web server serves only internal users; it cannot be
    accessed directly from the Internet. However, their
    "private network" is not private in the sense of NAT
    and RFC1918 private addressing. Everyone in the company
    has a public IP address. Every desktop computer runs
    Windows with the usual complement of Windows applications.

    Their border gateway/firewall provides insulation from the
    outside but I'm able to use a variety of protocols, such as
    SSH, to make connections to hosts on the Internet from
    their network. He seems to be unaware of threats that
    originate from the inside.

b) Their virus scanners are up to date.

Subject: [PLUG] I hate Nautilus
Message-ID: <20090523153012.d7a1e2c8.johnxj@comcast.net>

So today I am downloading some distros for my USB disk that I take to
the Clinic. Suddenly Transmission announces that I am out of file
space. Sure enough, the GUI says there is no free space out of the 140
GB formatted. Now, I know I have a lot of stuff on this computer, but
just the other day I know I had around 30 GB free.

Further poking around revealed 35 GB in "Trash." I deleted them and
that gave me 35 GB free. 

More poking around revealed a link (arrow on the icon) to /media/cdrom.
Inside was another 12.1 GB of files - what appeared to be tar.gz backup
files from 2007. I deleted them, and then Nautilus announced that I had
47 GB free space. Don't ask why backup files were in there, because I
have no clue. I have never [deliberately] created backups to the same
partition as I am backing up, nor have I ever used optical media as a
backup destination. 

Just now I wanted to look at some items in ~/Phonology/. The folder is
still there, but all my bookmarks are gone - about 20 of them. They
were all there this morning. Evidently deleting stuff from Trash
deletes your bookmarks. 

OK, I'll just recreate the bookmarks. It's just a click - click - click
process. Except that you can't do it easily. I selected a file in
~/Phonology/ and told Nautilus to create a bookmark to it. Nautilus
created a bookmark to ~/. The only way to get a bookmark to the
~/Phonology/ folder is to create one to ~/ and then edit it manually.

I have had problems with Nautilus in the distant past, but this crap is
new. I wonder if the dist-upgrade to Jaunty is responsible.

The Pittock building has several "levels" of datacenter space available.
There are companies inside that lease out space they've purchased in
bulk, you can get private suites/cages, get on secured floor with
dead-man doors, biometrics, etc.
The building is served by many hundreds of Gigabits of bandwidth from
a couple dozen seperate providers that peer to eachother in the
building itself. It's one of the major access points in the northwest,
among Viawest, and to a much smaller level Inflow/Sungard.

Easystreet had good facilities the last time I used them (several
years ago), but back in the day for my own personal use, I maintained
a few geographically separate co-located servers (San Jose CA, Dallas
TX, Portland OR). Each ran about $100-150 a month, built a very nice
distributed system.

I've used Easystreet for years. Love em. They just did a bunch of power and
cooling upgrades and I saw not a single hiccup. They really take the time to
do things right. As mentioned above, they are a great fit for a small /
medium org. And yes, they do have biometrics. Whether or not that's a good
thing, I'll leave to you to decide for yourself. But access is a no-brainer.
24/7, no call ahead, no check-in. If you have a card and a rack key, you can
show up whenever you like, and bring whomever you like.

If they're NAT'd, then they aren't public IP's. So which is it?

It sounds like they have an internal web server for document sharing and 
they will control write access to certain sub folders within the 
DocumentRoot via Samba. I suppose to would make sense to have the PDF's 
uploaded via web form, but what's the problem here? What scenario are 
you anticipating? Someone hax0ring the server trough samba? How big is 
this company?

They do _NOT_ use NAT. All IP addresses are public.

Ahh, Ok. I misread the context.

Well, if the firewall on the web server blocks access to anything 
outside their subnet, and they keep the box up to date, that should do 
it. Keeping the Windows machines on the public side is more interesting 
to me. But as long as the they have their individual firewalls sensible 
and enabled, and the users are running as normal users and not admins 
they should be Ok, but it does seem as minimal by todays standards.

Using a Samba share like this could pose huge risks if a virus gets
involved. It could potentially write to the webserver depending on what it
was. I actually had this issue waaaaaay back in the day and learned my
lesson the hard way.

Perhaps something like setting a Subversion repo would be a reasonable
alternative since there are Windows GUI tools available and SVN are web
accessible and can be easily controlled in regards to access that are much
more prudent than drive mapping.

This is less of an issue from a security standpoint given there is a router
in place, provided the router is secured properly.

   Yesterday (Saturday), both the 00:02 (root's crontab) and 04:40
(cron.daily) reports were run with the results mailed to me and seen in my
inbox.

   Today, the 00:02 invocation ran but did not appear in my inbox; the 04:40
invocation did not run.

   According to the trace in /etc/cron.daily/1pflogsumm:

   This shows up in /var/log/maillog.1 as:

   Then I find a reference to that timestamp in ~/procmail/log:

But, this appears to be the results of 'strace' on the script, not the
summary of the mail log.

   I've absolutely no idea where the source of this problem might be.
Regardless, I sure would like to have it resolved ... soon.

so are you saying that even though you have procmail logs showing it was 
delivered, you don't see the email?  if you look at your procmail log, do 
you see delivery that isn't preceded by the locking of rshepard.lock?

also, what email client do you run?  any chance it is filtering things for 
you?  maybe a quick rule at the top of procmailrc to keep a copy of all 
incoming email while you're debugging?

:0c:
$HOME/incoming.archive

and then only look at the with simple unix commands (cat, grep, less, 
etc) just to make sure you aren't having some weird mail client issue.

Joe,

   The procmail log shows the strace output being delivered to
/var/spool/mail/rshepard (which is was), but not the summary report. Yet it
was the strace output that suggested (I'm being cautious here) that the
summary report was mailed to me.

> also, what email client do you run?

   Alpine-2.00.

> Any chance it is filtering things for you?

   No. I have a non-default role, but that's for sending and replying to
messages from my personal domain.

   I'm wondering if I should figure out how to install and configure maildrop
rather than procmail. This is the first time in a dozen years that procmail
has behaved this way, at least that I've been aware of dropped messages.
Also, it's been a decade or so since I installed postfix and pflogsumm and
that's worked daily until recently, too.

   The reason I think that this is a procmail issue is when I direct _all_
incoming messages addressed to my business domain to the personal domain
mail file, they all appear. Example: last week customer service at United
Airlines tried sending me a receipt copy to both my business and personal
domains. /var/log/maillog showed both arriving and passed on to procmail,
but neither appeared in the default or personal mail file. When I modified
the procmail recipe file to direct mail from the business domain to the
personal domain file, the third time that message was sent it was delivered.

   In this instance cron was not involved and neither was 1pflogsumm. All
three messages showed up in /var/log/maillog as properly received and passed
to procmail. Only the last one, specifically redirecting mail addressed to
me at my business domain to the personal domain file, was delivered.

   Unfortunately, there is no longer a procmail-specific mail list nor anyone
I've found who knows it well enough to provide insight into the problem.

just for clarification, that output is not strace.  the -x option to sh 
tells it to display commands as it is going to run them.

   OK. I thought what I read in my ORA Bash Shell book is that the -x option
is equivalent to '-o strace'. My mistake.

An update, in case this ever happens to anyone else. 

You can kill and restart Nautilus with "sudo killall nautilus."
However, Nautilus is running only when you have a browser window open.
And killing and restarting it did not restore my bookmarks.

I finally found out where bookmarks are stored. It is a plain text file
~/.gtk-bookmarks. I had looked all over for hidden files with
"nautilus" or "gnome" in them without luck. I restored the file from a
backup of a couple weeks ago and all my bookmarks are back.

The unanswered question is why emptying the Trash folder would delete
the contents of ~/.gtk-bookmarks. OK, deleting the Trash probably
deleted the whole file, which was then regenerated anew the next time I
opened Nautilus. But why would deleting the Trash delete a hidden file
in ~/?

Gnome is a mysterious place.

Subject: [PLUG] Runt monitors
Message-ID: <20090525054642.GB22789@gate.kl-ic.com>

Rant!

There was a kvetch a few weeks ago about widescreen monitors.
Today I went shopping for normal 4:3 aspect ratio monitors,
and couldn't find any.  It seems that the so-called widescreen
monitors have displaced nearly all the squarer monitors.

There is something insideous happening, and the scary thing is
that the customers are pulling from their end.

Monitors are measured by the diagonal dimension.  a 4:3 20inch
monitor is 16 inches wide and 12 inches high - more or less,
usually less.  For those of us using web browsers and text
editors and similar tools, we are usually looking at portrait
format pages, taller than wide.  So an 8.5 x 11 image, displayed
on a 21 inch monitor, only fills half the screen.  Panels and 
status bars, running horizontally (and why the heck is that,
anyway???), cut down the size of displayed pages even more.

Now we have the abomination of "widescreen", or as I choose to
call them, RUNT monitors.  The aspect ratios are approximately
16:9 .  Wider, oooo!  More pixels, more workspace, right?

Wrong.  Monitors are still measured by the diagonal.  An honest
4:3 20 inch monitor has 16x12 or 192 square inches of pixels
(less usually, because many "20 inch" screens are a little over
19.5 inches between the pixel corners).  The math is harder to
do for 16:9 ratio, but an honest 20 inch diagonal 16:9 is 17.432
inches wide ( 8.9% wider ) and 9.805 inches tall (18.3% shorter).
The pixel area is 170.92 square inches, 11% smaller.  To get the
same pixel area, you need a 6% larger diagonal - that is, a more
expensive monitor.  

To get 12 vertical inches (11 inch page plus panels and status
bars), a 16:9 screen must be 21.3 inches wide, or 24.5 inch
diagonal.  Oh well, get rid of a few books in the shelf, and 
the picture of the family.  Since you are paying big bucks for
a "25 inch" rather than a "20 inch" screen, you can't afford a
family anyway.

But then, an increasing number of people are using their computers
as TVs or game platforms (the same as TV, but with repetitive
stress injury and 3-5 times the wasted electricity).  We are all
unemployed - who needs to do use computers for work any more?  So
the fact that the new monitors are less useful for programming,
writing, and other productive tasks is actually a bonus.  

The manufacturers reduce cost.  The consumers reduce mental
effort.  Only us dinosaurs who actually use our computers to
create stuff are complaining.

Fooey.  A pox on both their houses, to the seventh generation!

Keith

P.S.  Actually, I suppose the trick is to mount the monitor with
the screen rotated 90 degrees, then use    Option "Rotate" "CW"
in the X configuration.  Is there a list of video cards that
support this option?  It is a little hard on most laptop users ...

This thread is plug-talk, not plug 
appropriate.

Computers are not sentient. Even if one
was sentient, the wise programmer would 
be very careful and work very hard to 
build in a robust ethical framework or
at the very least a fail safe.

People are not machines.  Trying to 
attribute feelings to machines in 
order to devalue humanity is where 
I think this is going and I don't 
care for that.

Message-ID: <1243233472.22026.28.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I am getting bad packet length followed by disconnects a 
lot.

This machine I am trying to log into is only accessible 
through a wireless link originating from a Linksys WAP11.
I have googled and googled and googled and I still can't
figure out why this is happening.  The drops are random,
but I don't ever get very far command wise.  I don't get
vim up or cat any large files.

I saw something about login scripts that print messages
to the console crashing ssh, but I don't know if that 
is accurate let alone pertinent.  Slackware by default
prints messages to the terminal after I log in even
if I come in via ssh.

I wonder if the 2 wireless cards which are intended 
to create 2 different wireless networks from this 
server are interrupting each other?  This server is
basically intended as a repeater and a camera box.

Note that I have Slackware 10.1 running on a wired
network booted system and I'm not having any problems
of this nature on that machine.

I really dislike the idea of a Samba share being the DocumentRoot. I do like
Drew's idea of an SVN repository. How important is the PDF file format to
them? Would it be easier (more appropriate) to use a wiki to create the
documents? I haven't researched it, but I'm willing to bet there are some
wikis out there that allow export to PDF for a topic.

I think it is because most panels and status bars display words, and
words are most easily read horizontally (well, in many languages,
anyway).  Vertical bars either have to be thick enough to contain at
least short words without clipping them, or contain no words at all,
which limits their usefulness.  At least with a widescreen monitor (not
that I'm endorsing them), you can set a fairly thick vertical panel
without losing more of your already compromised horizontal space.

What we really need are flexible monitors that can be resized like a
window on the monitor.  Push in on one side and increase the vertical
while decreasing the horizontal; push down on the top and do the
reverse.  Or better yet, resize the monitor with the keyboard or mouse.
Or at the least, seamless foldable monitors with panels that can be used
to change the aspect ratio.

Our grandchildren are going to wonder how we ever survived with such
clunky, inflexible technology.  "What, you lived in houses without video
walls?  You had to buy a special devices to watch a movie?"

In every rant there is a silver lining?  My personal experience doesn't 
equate.  For whatever reason, I seem to get more vertical image on 16:9 
as opposed to on 4:3 (no to mention the horizontal).  That would be from 
subjective observations of ...
    XP Pro on 4:3 (ThinkPad)
    Vista on 16:9 (Gateway laptop)
    Madriva 2000 - 2009 on 4:3 and 16:9 (Gateway laptop and old Compaq 
desktop)
... purely empirical - nothing formal - although it might be proper to 
note that I am not a gamer, or do I indulge in TV or full screen video
Regards
Fred James

PS: I have never tried the rotated screen, though I have seen it - call 
me silly, but I was not impressed - seemed rather like reading a galley 
- awkward.  Your mileage may vary.

I can't fathom what happened, but I wonder if it has something to do
with "Trash" moving from ~/.Trash to ~/.local/share/Trash.  I'm not sure
when that happened, but I do know it used to be a hidden directory under
~/ and now it isn't.  Maybe upgrading from a previous version of GNOME,
when "Trash" was in its old location, to the current version, with
"Trash" in a different location, confused things.

I'm also not really clear on when you say "deleting the Trash" you mean
"emptying the Trash" or actually deleting the directory that contains
"Trash"  -- and if the latter, that begs the question, which directory
did you delete, the old one (which may have still been in your home
directory) or the new one, or both?

I used to believe in the "more surface area = better" argument as well. In
fact I went through basically the exact same logic you did.

However.

On widescreens it is easier to get two usefully-sized windows side-by-side.
So, for me at least, while there are net fewer pixels for a particualr size
measurement (Who pays attention to actual physical size anyway? So long as
it's "big enough" I only care about native resolution), they are arranged in
a more useful configuration, which ends up being a net win. Of course, this
is something that the math does not reveal, so I fought converting to
widescreens for a good long time. Now that I've gotten used to working that
way (and have a substantial workload that benefits from working that way)
doing anything on my last 4:3 display (on a Think X61) is almost comically
frustrating. So long as I have at least 1000 vertical pixels I'm happy. You
can have my widescreen displays when you rip them from my cold, dead hands.

By "deleting the trash" I meant opening the Trash folder, seeing that
there were 35 GB of unwanted files in it, selecting them all, and
deleting them. As far as I know I did not delete the folder itself.

Thanks for the information about the change to the location of the
Trash folder. I don't know if it is part of the problem, but it's good
to know.

Another issue is that apparently I misunderstood the function of Trash.
I never really used it until recently. I have the option checked in
Nautilus to display a Delete that does not go to Trash, and that is
what I always use. Therefore, in years of using Ubuntu I never had
anything in Trash. But recently I was downloading stuff with
Transmission. After the download completed and I had seeded at least
twice what I downloaded I used Transmission to delete the file and the
torrent. It was Transmission that was moving stuff to the Trash.

What I failed to grasp is that files in Trash will not be overwritten
if you need the space. I always thought that files in Trash could be
automatically deleted if necessary, thus Trash is just for recovery of
immediate mistakes. I don't know where I came up with that notion, but
apparently it is wrong.

Since when is the Pythagorean Theorem (or the law of sines or cosines,
for that matter) more difficult to solve for rectangles with different
aspect ratios? :)

4*x^2 + 3*x^2 = 20^2

vs.

16*y^2 + 9*y^2 = 20^2

But yes, you're right, I'd much rather have either an old-style 4:3 or
a "tall" monitor (physically rotatable runt would work) than the wide
ones.

I can compute the square root of 3*3+4*4=25 in my head.  9*9+16*16=337,
not so much.  It is precisely this difficulty that causes average people
buying widescreen monitors to think they are getting more square inches
of pixels, when in fact they are getting fewer.  The math is too hard
for the average person (that is, the person who makes stuff for, and
feeds, us L33T H4XORs) to have a gut feel for.  

Perhaps if we explain it to them properly, our fellow citizens will
lynch some LCD monitor marketing scum, and the chastened companies
will start making non-Runt monitors again.

See, I think this assumption may be the core flaw of your logic. I don't
know anyone who bought a widescreen monitor who thought they were getting
more square inches of pixels. In fact I, doubt very much they thought about
the number of pixels at all. It's much more likely that their thought
process was like, "I want it to be (X big or bigger) and look pretty and
work with my computer and be cheap enough that I can afford it." Beyond
that, the average consumer _just doesn't care_.

Similar to the adage "Don't attribute to malice what can easily be explained
by incompetence.", "Don't attribute to corporate fleecing conspiracy what
can easily be explained by purchasing priorities that differ from your own."

To further this line of thought. In order for businesses to be 
successful they must give consumers what they want. In any market there 
are exponentially more ignorant buyers than there are educated ones. So, 
we get stuck with  "choosing" from what the masses have dictated by 
their ignorance and unwillignes to pay a higher price for a higher 
quality product. However, this doesn't let marketing types of the hook. 
As they'll do everything in their power so that consumers can't easily 
compare data between products.

Eh, I don't think that's true. I mean, sure, if you go to Best Buy you are
basically picking from 15 different flavors of crap, but basically every
topline manufacturer has some sort of "professional" or "prosumer" line
which will better cater to the needs of the educated. Apropos this
particular discussion though, the age of 4:3 is over regardless of what
price range you are in.

However, this doesn't let marketing types of the hook.

"So it has been, and so it shall always be.". Particularly in the world of
displays, where very few of the "hard" specs have any bearing on their
real-world performance. My algorithm for choosing monitors has basically
become:

1- Decide on a resolution I want
2- Decide what extra features I want (stand adjustments, extra inputs,
speakers, etc)
3- Find 5-10 models that meet those requirements from brands I trust,
eliminate those that reviewed poorly.
4a- Order one that I can afford and that I "like best". Modulo some glaring
defect that bothers me unduly, be happy.

OR (if possible and convenient)

 4b- See all my candidates side-by-side displaying the same images. Pick the
one I like the best, be happy.

With rare exception, the "specs" of a display don't matter so long as it
looks good to you, and this field has been commoditized to that point that
you have to try pretty hard to get a "bad" display. I've better things to do
with my time than to worry about what a difference a few hundred lumens or a
slightly better contrast ratio or a 2% better gamut or "fill in minutia spec
of choice here" will make.

I had forgotten that nautilus could be configured to delete files
directly, without sending them to the Trash folder.  I don't use
nautilus much for actual file management, I mainly use it as a display
tool, and only when I'm logged into GNOME proper.  When I'm using a
different window manager, I don't use nautilus at all.  I never fiddled
with that setting, so when I do delete a file from nautilus, it goes to
the Trash.

I would expect Transmission to follow your nautilus settings.  I would
think the "delete" function in Transmission would hand off the action to
nautilus, which would then deal with the files according to your
preferences.  But then I looked at the [1] spec, and I see: "A 'home
trash' directory SHOULD be automatically created for any new user. If
this directory is needed for a trashing operation but does not exist,
the implementation SHOULD automatically create it, without any warnings
or delays."  I guess, even if you're running Transmission under
conditions where nothing else makes use of a Trash folder, Transmission
would create a Trash folder and move any file you tell it to delete
there.

It is now, but it wasn't always:

"In early versions of the Macintosh Finder, Trash contents were listed
in volatile memory. Files moved to the Trash would appear there only
until the Finder session ended, then they would be automatically erased.
When System 7 was released, the Trash became a folder that retained its
contents until the user chose to empty the trash.

"Recycle Bin first appeared in Windows 95. In this version, the original
location record of the file is stored, but the folder itself didn't
allow subdirectories. When a folder is deleted, its containing files are
moved into the bin and mixed with other deleted files. The directory
structure can only be restored if the batch of files are "undeleted". A
revised Recycle Bin allows for subdirectory trees within the recycle
bin."

The masses are choosing on the hype of the HD internet content delivery 
model.  I frankly don't care about the size of the monitor as long as it 
is sharp and bright and at least 19" so I can get the font large enough 
to see.  I was given a 24" 16x9 at work, which works well for me so I 
can have large Xterms side by side, since I usually am logged into three 
or four different systems at the same time, at it helps when I can 
compare configurations or code side-by-side.

The DocumentRoot on a Samba share is just asking for trouble and a 
maintenance headache.  Might I suggest using a CMS such as Wordpress or 
Drupal.  Gives you all the security, content access controls and

Exactly, which rolls right into having TWO 8.5x11 documents opened side 
by side, readable, without zooming.

Current large widescreen's are sooo much cheaper than they used to be 
though. You can get a screen that is bigger in any direction than a 4:3 
screen of a couple years ago for a lesser price.

I don't know a single 'creative' type you could convince to get back 
into a 4:3 monitor. As for the coder type, I remember 4:3 monitors that 
you could rotate 90 deg back then too. The newer wide screens make that 
approach even better.

I think you just need to take the plunge. I wouldn't want to go back 
having used them for a couple years now.

I don't know that I'd call this a "security issue" in and of itself. I mean
really, if he trusts everyone who has this access and/or they need it to do
their work, the security is exactly what it needs to be. My biggest concern
with this is that it's "weird", and weird things invariably cost more to
maintain. Doing things "right" in terms of security for security's sake is
never going to sell. The business owner will need a business reason to
change their practice. Some way that is easier / faster / cheaper than the
current way. I think it would be worthwhile to find out _why_ things are
setup the way they are and propose a solution that solves the original
problem more elegantly, while also conforming more closely to best practices
in general, with specific emphasis on security.

This is naive. One must have defense in depth. Unless a machine needs to
have routable IP to provide a service, it should not have one. End of
discussion. This is the security problem, not the web server setup in and of
itself. If one of those juicy Windows machines gets whacked, they're just a
single hop away from owning the (presumably public facing?) website. If that
happens, what is the cost to the business in terms of goodwill / trust?
Again, make the argument based on business values. Trying to sell security
with "we need to be more secure" rarely works. Even if it does work, it
makes the security guy look like a resource sink to the execs. Wouldn't you
rather look like the guy who paid for his fee several times over in
efficiency gains?


> b) Their virus scanners are up to date.

Well, my best advice here is what I've already said. Also, resist the urge
to say "I told you so" when they get hit by some zero-day that the scanner
didn't know about.

Also remind your friend that as an IT person, it's not his job to do risk
assessment. He's there to advise the decision makers with whom the ultimate
responsibility of deciding if a risk is worth bearing rests. If he lays out
the risks he sees in good faith, and does his best to make sure all the
bases are covered, and they decide not to change, he's still done his job.
Besides, when they come running to him for help rebuilding because their
site got destroyed, he'll likely collect a healthy fee.

Message-ID: <1243307319.3265.6.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I have Redhat 6.2 axp running again, but I don't know any of the old
passwords on the box.  Uge!  I have Windows NT 4 installed and working,
although my mouse sucks ;-(

Is there a trick that will allow me to hack the password file on this
old installation of Linux?  On an X86 box, I'd just use a toms root
boot disk or something similar and change the passwords by chrooting
into the old system as root.

I don't have any good floppy disks for the most part.  Uge!  I use milo
and a fat partition to load linux.

At the very least, I want to get on to the system to see what's there
and retrieve the alpha Linux copy of Archon.

does milo let you add boot params?  if so, put 'single' on it and then you

My googling suggests it's a protocol mismatch between client and server. You
didn't mention which version of Slackware you're ssh'ing into that is
causing the issue. What client are you using?

Can't you just mount the disk partitions on a separate running system
and copy off the files you want and/or change the passwd file there?

If any of them came with 1600x1200 pixels or better, they wouldn't
piss me off so much.  You *used* to be able to get a 1600x1200 monitor
for a reasonable price.  To get anything with 1200 pixels vertically
is almost impossible nowadays.  I had to buy a refurb a few months ago.

That's a great guess, but I'm using slackware 10.1 on both the client
and the server.  I assume that the ssh client is the same as I haven't
done any updates.

OpenSSH_3.9p1, OpenSSL 0.9.7e 25 Oct 2004 on the last wired computer
before I reach barn.

OpenSSH_3.9p1, OpenSSL 0.9.7e 25 Oct 2004 on barn itself which I reach
from a Linksys WAP11 hooked to condor.

As you can see, the same version of ssh supposedly.

Then you should take another look. Newegg has 34 of them. 12 of them 
under $400, 2 under $300, all 24" screens and larger. My laptop is 
1920x1200 on a 15.4" display. This gives me two things. 1) AWESOMENESS, 
and 2) it keeps most people off my laptop. :D

Good to know you got it resolved and what the issue was. I've been
admonished by a kernel dev before for even saying the word "ndiswrapper" ..
heh. Native modules are much much better.

Business spend billions making sure consumers want what profits business the

   Perhaps VD (Visual Diff)?

   I understand the desire to look at two files side-by-side, with one in an
editor and the other viewed in a pager. Differences that need to be
corrected can be copied from the read-only terminal and pasted into the
editor console using the pointy device, or manually typed in from the
keyboard. Saves a step or two compared with producing an output diff file
and using that to edit one file.

Subject: [PLUG] render html to png image
Message-ID: <20090528005639.GA4768@gate.kl-ic.com>

Are there any open source tools out there that can render an html
page to a png (or other) image, automatically?  Yes, I know you 
can display the page on a screen, then screen capture the image,
but I am looking for something I can automate, perhaps as a script
that spiders a directory.

I'm working on a navigable web presentation tool, makeshow. 
     http://www.server-sky.com/makeshow
It builds a series of PNG images into a slide show (a PNG image
is very hard to mis-render - what you see is what you ALWAYS
get).  There are tools, such as Eric Wilhelm's Text::Slidez,
which turn a text script into html pages, and I would like to
take the outputs of such tools and make PNG images. 

Any suggestions?

Keith

you should be able to find a way to go html->ps->png.

http://www.w3.org/Tools/html2things.html

has some pointers for the html->ps part.  not sure if any of them will be 
what you want.

I seems if you move a openSuse 11.1 hard disk to another computer, it 
starts booting up, hangs for a bit, and then switches to black and white 
console and gives the message:
Could not find /dev/disk/by-id/ata_WDC_WD800JB-OOJJCO_WD-WMAM bla bla bla.

If you wait a bit, it will start a bash shell. It obviously found the 
disk and booted something. You can then do a ls command, change 
directories etc., but you can't do much.

If you take the disk back to the computer on which you made the 
installation, it boots up fine.

Searching for the first part of the error string "Could not find 
/dev/disk/by-id/" finds several folks having the same problem moving or 
duplicating openSuse Installations. Most of them had to resort to 
booting the install CD and repairing or reinstalling (Beginning to sound 
a little like Windows??).

A customer of mine runs some flavor of a SuSE server in their back room 
and therefore would like to deploy openSuse based systems in one of 
their industrial control system products. However, if a system located 
in Rusia, Japan or even Alabama should have a disk failure and need a 
new disk,  or should the main board die, having to make the new disk on 
the target hardware would be a pain.

Has anyone on this list encountered this problem?
Is there a simple way to reconfigure something and get openSuSE to run 
on multiple machines?
Do you think not being able to run on any hardware other than the 
installation hardware is a good idea?

This is a bit of a shot in the dark, but I may have run into something
similar, although with Ubuntu.
It may be that OpenSuSE uses UUID of the disk to determine what to boot,
instead of a pathname like /dev/hda or /dev/sda.  Moving the disk to a
different computer, causes that disk to have a different UUID since it is on
a different IDE/SATA controller.  UUID is said to remain constant across
reboots, but only on the same computer.  If you move the drive to another
computer (and thus another IDE/SATA controller) the UUID is not guaranteed
and likely not going to be the same.

One thing you can do, is when the system boots, interrupt the automated
countdown, and go into GRUB and edit the kernel line (use arrow keys to
hightlight the line that has "kernel" and hit "e" to edit) so that it points
to /dev/hda1 or /dev/sda1 (depending on your disk) instead of the UUID, and
see if it boots.  If it does, you can then get the UUID of the disk in the
new computer on the command line (I forget the exact command offhand,
perhaps someone else can chip in with it...), and edit /boot/grub.conf and
change it to point to the new UUID to boot to it each time.

I am pretty sure OpenSuSE uses GRUB now yes?

This is a guess but an educated guess... ;)

Did you try the obvious: google html2png ?

I turned up 'html2jpg', which ostensibly converts html to several
image formats.  The description says it requires Opera, but offers
a hint about where to modify  the code (Perl !) to use something else.

The author was coming from the same place you are: he needed the tool
but didn't find anything, so rolled his own.  Admittedly he did it with
Netscape in mind, but it might fly.  I can try to play with it and see
what happens.

There are several other hits for 'html2png', but the ones I skimmed
seem to be various Rube Goldberg contraptions.

Hmmm ... if you can get HTML -> ps done, I think you can go from ps to
PNG using ImageMagick.

This looks familiar. Didn't we run into this at a Linux clinic a
couple of months ago?

Yes, openSUSE defaults to grub. Here's a chunk of /boot/grub/menu.lst
from my machine

title openSUSE 11.1 - 2.6.27.21-0.1
    root (hd0,1)
    kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.27.21-0.1-default
root=/dev/disk/by-id/ata-ST3160811AS_5PT10CJZ-part2
resume=/dev/disk/by-id/ata-ST3160811AS_5PT10CJZ-part1 splash=silent
showopts vga=0x317
    initrd /boot/initrd-2.6.27.21-0.1-default

When openSUSE boots, you need to hit "ESC" to get into the Grub menu.
Then you can edit the line to point to actual devices. Once you get
the machine booted up, you can edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and change the
line so it always boots that way.

I've used Inkscape to convert PS to PNG. I'm pretty sure Inkscape uses
ImageMagick to produce bitmaps.

Inkscape can also import PDFs, although only one page at a time. I've
found that importing a PDF is sometimes better than importing the same
image written to PS. I don't know if Inkscape's import of PS and PDF
are separate modules that can be called from a command line and used in
a script.

If the web page fits in one screen, try "import screenshot.png".
import is also an ImageMagick utility.

Yeah ... I normally use PDFs rather than PS myself, but IIRC it's an
extra pipe in the script. :) The Gimp will also make a bitmap from a
vector graphic, but it's not a command line tool.

I've actually had a number of instances where I more or less *had* to
convert a vector graphic to a bitmap. I generate some pretty complex
plots with R and ggobi, and these things take up many megabytes and
choke printers in a step called "flattening". Converting them to
bitmaps is the only way they can be emailed and printed.

BTW -- ImageMagick is Perl (and Python and Ruby and probably Lua)
scriptable, so if you have some fancy logic making your slides in
Perl, you should be able to put the ImageMagick piece of it in the
script directly.

I found this:
http://www.guangmingsoft.net/htmlsnapshot/html2image.htm

Not free, but cheap (ignore the big $ number on this page; under the Buy
link it says $29.95 single user license.  I tried it on Eric's first intuit
page, and it worked as advertised.  There is a disclaimer about things

Just for kicks, here's a result from Eric's intuit slide 001.  I'm using the
demo version of 'html2image', and haven't explored what it's restrictions
are, nor the enforcement thereof.

Anything that can render a webpage  to a png must have behind it the whole
rendering engine and so is subject to what that rendering engine can
render.  There is  a program that uses webkit to convert html to pdf
http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/
Then you can use several tools to go from pdf to png such as the pdfimages
utility in xpdf-utils.

As others mentioned, once you've got PS/PDF your task is much simpler.
I think the hard part is rendering the web page appropriately. Given the
way web sites are put together these days you basically need a rendering
app that approaches the sophistication of the major web browsers (firefox,
IE, Opera) to get pages into a state appropriate for image generation.

I've used HTMLDOC[1] with fairly good results most of the time.  It will
generate either PS or PDF output and can be run from the command line so
it's script-able.  Comes in two flavors, free and paid.  Guessing you'd
need the later if your project is income producing.

I'm pretty sure you could get the Mozilla + ImageMagick code to do the
same thing - just takes time/money...

Yes, and I thank you for your help. But as I recall, we were never able 
to get it to boot on any machine other than the machine it was installed on.

When I edit the line /root=/dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC....-part2/           
to /root=/dev/sda2/
and edit  /resume=/dev/sda1 /and then hit the escape key to end editing, 
I can see the line displayed on the screen just as it was before I 
edited it and when I hit b for boot, the results are the same, it hangs 
for a while then switches to console mode and displays the same old message:
"Could not find /dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC......"

Is there some command I am missing that is required to save or use the 
edited line before resuming the boot process?

I have also tried /dev/hda2 and /dev/hda1 with the same results.

By the way, when I boot the disk on the machine it was installed on and 
look in the /dev/disk/by-id/ directory, I see the following links.

These links appear to be freshened each boot although the time zone 
doesn't look like anything I recognize. As it was 12:58 local time, 
anything with a time of 05:58 should be somewhere where it is tomorrow.
>>> Do you think not being able to run on any hardware other than the

>>>       
Addressing the question above, I hate to see Linux loosing it's openness 
and flexibility. I use mobile disk drive docks that enable me to quickly 
put any disk into any of my computers. At a customer's site, I may have 
several computers controlling different processes. I leave 1 spare 
computer on the shelf with a mobile dock installed and a spare disk in a 
mobile dock tray for each machine. The GRUB by-id stuff would end all of 
that flexibility. It would require a spare computer and disk for each 
machine.

While I am at it, I may as well sound off as to what I think of the 
/udev rules. In case you are not aware of the addition of the /udev 
(user devices) rules, they lock hardware to a particular interface. For 
example, the eth0 interface can only be assigned to a NIC with a certain 
MAC address. If your NIC should die and you replace it, the interface 
won't come up until you do something with the network rules file.

When the /udev rules were first introduced into Slackware, they were 
flexible, you could list a single MAC address and associate that with a 
interface or list multiple MAC addresses each associated with a 
interface. This was the desired result of the udev rules, to always 
assign the same interface to the same hardware. You could also list a 
multiple MAC addresses all associated with the same interface as I did 
in my Slackware 12.0 /etc/udev/rules.d/75-network-devices.rules file below.

# Local network rules to name your network cards.
#
# These rules were generated by nethelper.sh, but you can
# customize them.
#
# You may edit them as needed.
# (If, for example, your machine has more than one network
# card and you need to be sure they will always be given
# the same name, like eth0, based on the MAC address)
#
# If you delete this file, /lib/udev/nethelper.sh will try to
# generate it again the next time udev is started.

KERNEL=="eth?", ATTR{address}=="00:06:4f:25:67:b1", NAME="eth0"
KERNEL=="eth?", ATTR{address}=="00:06:4f:59:04:34", NAME="eth0"
KERNEL=="eth?", ATTR{address}=="00:13:46:e7:81:52", NAME="eth0"
KERNEL=="eth?", ATTR{address}=="00:04:bf:90:b7:a2", NAME="eth0"
KERNEL=="eth?", ATTR{address}=="00:04:bf:90:b7:a1", NAME="eth0"
KERNEL=="eth?", ATTR{address}=="00:a0:cc:69:5c:55", NAME="eth0"
KERNEL=="eth?", ATTR{address}=="00:d0:09:e6:23:38", NAME="eth0"
KERNEL=="eth?", ATTR{address}=="00:1e:90:fe:9d:ac", NAME="eth0"

If the disk boots in any machine and finds one of the MAC addresses 
above, eth0 will come up. This worked, not great, but it worked.

Later versions of the Slackware /udev stuff are not as flexible. Should 
the disk be moved to another machine, the only way I have been able to 
get the network to come up is to delete 
/etc/udev/rules.d/75-network-devices.rules and reboot. Again, lost 
flexibility.

(pipes pdf result to stdout, convert reads input from stdin)

The result is attached.  This would take some tweaking to get a reasonable
slide-like png result, if it's at all possible.

The attachment didn't get through, but when I tried the above mentioned

Firefox.

If you have similar in your /etc/fstab, I would try (for this example)
replacing the UUID.=3... with /dev/sda1 .  Save a backup of course, and have
an emergency cd ready in case this turns out to be bad advice.

Good Luck

Compare with

I think the goal is to have an image that exactly diplicates the appearance
of
the slide as it appears there, laid out as on the web page.  I am assuming
that this is the case.  Keith, correct me if I am wrong.

Thanks for all the suggestions, especially to Tony Rick who tried
out wkhtmltopdf .  I tried that, and I tried khtml2png.  Both work.

khtml2png was more work to set up ( I had to download a lot of kde
development dependencies), but the behavior is a little cleaner.  It
produces pngs directly, and they can be scaled from the command line. 

I will still have to fiddle with it for local html and style sheets,
but I think I can make it work as part of an automated pipeline,
starting with Eric Wilhelm's Text::Slidez and ending up with my
makeshow script.  Someday, whole slide shows at the touch of a
button, no GUI need apply!

And if we don't have a speaker for Advanced Topics in July, perhaps
we can talk about making presentations with these tools.  Which
means all of you will be eager to try the tools and make your own
presentations for Advanced Topics!  Relief for Alan at last!

Subject: [PLUG] Damned Small USB or better?
Message-ID: <20090529072304.GD10484@gate.kl-ic.com>

I want to make a really small, single-purpose no-GUI Linux
install on a USB key.  The simplest looking process I have
discovered so far is this one for Damned Small Linux:

http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/wiki/index.php/Install_to_USB_From_within_Linux

-------------------------------------------------------------
The question:
Are there any simpler or faster-booting techniques out there?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Keith


( BTW, the purpose of this is a simple drive-clone backup for a
gag-Win7-gag box.  My wife is using a WinPC to run Dragon speech
recognition.  She needs every ounce of performance - baremetal Win
required, no virtualization, sigh.  When she is done, she inserts
the USB key and reboots.  D.S.Linux runs dd to clone the main hard
drive to an identical hard drive in an external SATA cradle, then
shuts down.  D.S.L. is the smallest and fastest booting Linux I know
about, and should be adequate for this task - assuming I can *always*
keep the source and the target drives straight, probably with some
combination of /dev/sdX identifiers and a timestamp someplace. )

dd is hardly the fastest way to copy data.  i see what you're going
for, though--obviously rsync or similar "don't copy already-same
areas" tool won't necessarily create a bootable copy of windows.  i
didn't find any tools like dd+xdelta out there but there must be a
more efficient tool...does something like ghost (non free, but if
you're dealing with windows anyway...) do that?  i can't imagine that
95% of the disk changes each usage, so it seems like an area of this
process rich for optimization.  i wonder if you have already optimized
partition size down to the bare minimum and just dd that partition?
seems like optimizing boot time when it must be such a tiny part of
the time taken to make the copy is ignoring amdahl's argument that one
should optimize the slowest thing first rather than the easiest...

sorry i don't have an actual answer for you :(

There is a free ghost based tool floating around based on netbsd. It's
been years since I used it though. I'll see if I can find the link.

You could mount the filesystems read-only using ntfs-3g (or there
might even be something in kernel, or ntfs-3g might be in kernel -- I
don't keep track anymore) and then rsync. Assuming, of course, Win 7
is still using NTFS. Like Chris is saying, the disk imaging is going
to be your biggest time sucker, not booting. DSL sounds good to me for
a minimal install, however.

Obviously... Data changes more often than system files.

Have your system drive be only system files.
Have a separate data/program partition.

Back up your your system files on a semi regular basis.
Back up your data every time.

No matter how you end up doing it, this will cut down on backup sizes and
time spent.

I've had some limited experience with g4u as drew brought up.  It's a pretty
neat little tool!  Seems to work well in the few times I've used it.

I'd suggest writing a script that pulls the serial number or model number
off the drives before running dd, just to be sure.

Also, the suggestion to look at G4U and whatnot won't really buy you
anything. They have a snappy name, but really just use dd (or sometimes dd
and netcat) under the covers. For what it sounds like you're trying to
accomplish, a purpose-written script and dd sound like the way to go. I'm
curious though, why not just do this once to get your system clone, and then
backup whatever data she's created more selectively? That would surely save
quite a lot of time.

Have you looked at the moblin fast boot stuff?

AFIK it holds the record for fast booting.
Don't know if it is practical enough for your use.

FOS, and proven: http://ping.windowsdream.com/

I've used it on CD, USB drives, and mostly, via PXE. It's fantastic  
for making backups of systems and then restoring later.

Good question.  Since I manage an open source backup /and restore/
project, I spend a lot of time thinking about restore.   When an
identifiable data file goes away, then a file-based restore system
is a good way to go.  But how often can an unsophisticated user
identify that the problem is in fact a missing data file, go to
a backup, and go through a correct file restore procedure and
get running again?

Sadly, most backup procedures are designed for efficient data
transfer, and rarely have a decent design for the restore process. 
Backups are scheduled, but restores are almost always unplanned
crises, and most restore attempts compound the problems rather
than fix them.  A proper design starts with a well managed
restore, and works backwards to the backup procedures that
support this.  Few backup tools get this right,

Most users, and that includes my wife, typically only notice that
"something isn't working".   Then it becomes my problem, to fix a
machine that I don't monitor daily and sometimes gets "creative"
modifications made to it, either by my wife trying a "shortcut",
or more often by insane system software.  Or worse, I am 3000
miles away and trying to guide her through a restore over the
phone.  Add damaged hearing to that, and a "helper" at the far
end who gets "creative" when given step by step instructions.
("No. NO. STOP! DON'T DO THAT!!!!")

Now compound that with a copy-resistant operating system like
Windoze, where the companies making the OS and the apps are much
more interested in "protecting their intellectual property" and
"first sale" eye candy than in helping users or system maintainers.
My wife does most of her work (email, surfing, even reading and
writing M$ documents) on Linux, where the machine gets nightly
backups and automated updates and system checks.  Windoze actively
prevents most such maintenance, because it might be used for purposes
they don't like.  But sadly, the only usable speech recognition app
for her needs, Dragon Naturally Speaking 10 Medical,  runs only on
Windoze, with all the enormous freight of problems that implies.
Not the least of which is that these clowns design for first sale,
not usability, and my wife is used to more rational software.
When a good Linux speech recognition app arrives (please O lord!)
we will ditch this windoze crap pronto.

Given all that, the easiest way to do a restore is to pop in a 
duplicate of the hard drive, and go from there.  No OS reinstall,
no activation, no mother-may-I from M$.  The source and target
hard drives are both in quick-swap cages;  I can make the exchange
(or she can with careful instruction) in seconds.   Yes, it takes
a lot longer to make the backups that way, but backups happen at
shutdown, deliberately, and the copy is made overnight.  This will
be faster if I restrict Windows to a small partition on the first
part of the disk, and dd only that - there won't be a lot of user
data on these drives.

And yes, M$ copy protection may interfere with all this.  We
will see.  Of course, I will mock up the procedure manually,
with a live CD.  But the goal is an easy-to-understand backup
procedure that my wife can master, so I am learning about tools
for that while I adapt to M$'s paranoia.

Sorry for the long description, but you asked about reasoning and
you got it, or at least my vague approximation of reasoning.

Maybe SystemRescueCD (http://www.sysresccd.org/Main_Page) or another

Amusing FYI:  The target drive is in ESATA external swap rack.
Linux can interact with the drive fine.  The BIOS sees it.
Windoze 7 "drive manager" can't find it.  This is only the 
release candidate of Win7, but even those second raters should
be able to find a second drive.  Giggle.  Snerk.

Stupid question but does is it actually already formatted with an FS? Vista
refuses to see a drive when it's not formatted and sometimes it decides it
doesn't need a drive letter, I have to assign one (retarded software!). I
haven't used 7 yet except for a quick once over in a VM .. refuse to install
it heh. In Vista though you have to go into the Administrative Tools ->
Computer Management -> Disk Drives (or something like that)  and assign a
drive letter and format the FS.

Or, just use DriveImage XML. You can run it live, it's free, and it's 
scriptable.

http://www.runtime.org/driveimage_faq.htm#command_line

Seems like a cleaner path than dealing with multiple operating systems.

Right, because Linux takes an unpartitioned bare drive and partitions, 
formats, and mounts to the mount point you would've chosen anyway, 
automatically!

You might look at Tiny Core Linux ("tiny frugal linux with extensions"):

http://www.tinycorelinux.com/

It's developed by Robert Shingledecker, formerly of DSL, who left DSL
because he thought it was getting away from its original mission.  (And
because of, well, the usual inter-personal things that can happen
whenever one person talks to someone other than himself.)

Quoth the website:

"Our goal is the creation of a nomadic ultra small desktop capable of
booting from cdrom, pendrive, or frugally from a hard drive. The desktop
boots extremely fast and is able to support additional applications and
hardware of the users choice. While Tiny Core always resides in ram,
additional applications extensions can either reside in ram, mounted
from a persistent storage device, or installed into a persistent storage
device."

It sounded like a fascinating and versatile project -- as much a
"meta-distro" as a regular ol' distro -- when I read about it on
DistroWatch a few months ago, but that's as much as I know about it.

Why in the world do you need a drive letter?

XP, Vista and I assume 7 can mount a second, formatted drive on a  
mount point.

As I re-read my reply, I realize mine could be taken as condescending.  
That wasn't my intent, and I apologize to the group and directly to

Yeah, makes sense. Still seems like a lot to think about.

I wonder if one could do the initial dd-based image creation and then use
rsync (robocopy?) to do more atomic updates of the image. This is
essentially how SuperDuper for OSX works, and it's real nice to work with.
It's come as close to "ideal" consumer backup as anything I've seen.

Agreed. I always think of voice speech recognition as being a very niche
need, but I know a lot of people who would use it if they could afford to /
get it on their platform of choice. There was some OSS speech recognition
stuff that was active in the 90's, but I haven't heard or seen anything
about it in years. As I recall it was based on some code with ancestral ties
to Dragon.

It won't. I've used dd-copied system images with every flavor of Windows out
there, and they have yet to complain so long as they are connecting the same
computer as they were originally installed to.

It still seems to me that there should be an option that would be
less...ritualistic. I'd be surprised if the backup raindance you propose
actually gets done with any kind of frequency. I understand Acronis
TrueImage creates "bootable backups", and at only $50 for the "home"
version, it will likely end up being a net savings vs rolling your own for
an environment you're not familiar with. Of course, it's not validated on 7,
but I'd wager it'll work given the minor internal changes between 7 and
Vista. I've also heard good things about SyncBackSE. Supposedly it's
comparable to SuperDuper that I mention above.

All,

I'm at a loss about why this simple concatenation is not working. I'm
pulling a value from a hash and attempting to concatenate ".cal" on the end.


        $Cal_ref = {
            'cal_name'  => $cal_name,
            'dates'     => \@dates,
            'desc'    => $cal_desc
        };

        $twsCalendars[$i] = $Cal_ref;
        $i++;
...

for (my $i = 0; $i < $length; $i++) {
    # cycle through the list and print all the calendar names
    my $c_href = $twsCalendars[$i];
    my $cal_name = $$c_href{'cal_name'};
    my $foo = ".cal";
    my $var1 = $cal_name . "$foo";
    print ("$cal_name\n");
    print ("$var1");
    print "\n";
    print ("    $var1");
    print "\n";

This outputs the following:

BCPFTPCL
.calTPCL
.calBCPFTPCL

Whatever I try, I can't concatenate the ".cal" on the end of $cal_name. I've
moved quotes around, attempted the concatenation to the same var ($cal_name
= $cal_name . $foo) but nothing seems to work. It seems there are invisible
characters or $cal_name isn't scalar (I have even forced a scalar context on
$cal_name, no change in result).

thanks,

looks to me like you have a \r on the end of $cal_name.  you probably need 
to do some chop/chomp'ing when you get your data.

Thanks Rogan, you are right, when finished editing the GRUB boot line 
with the little GRUB editor, <Enter> key will take you back one level 
and the edit changes are saved. This was omitted from the brief 
instructions that appear when editing the list.

However, still won't boot on another machine. I have tried replacing the 
/dev/disk/by-id stuff with:

/dev/hda1 and /dev/hda2,
/dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2
(hd0,1) and (hd0,2)

Looking in /dev/ after boot, I see that the only choices for anything 
that looks like a disk is /dev/sda, /dev/sda1,2,3 and /dev/disk/.
/dev/disk/ has sub-directories  by-id/,     by-path/  and   by-uuid/

Looking at the time on the block device nodes created in /dev/, they are 
created each boot. If I make my own block device nodes, give them the 
same major and minor numbers as the /dev/sda* nodes but different name, 
they are deleted at next boot. I would guess that early in the boot 
process everything in the /dev/ directory is deleted. Probably explains 
why substituting sda* in the proper places when editing the GRUB boot 
line didn't work.

I'll admit that I don't have the big picture on this scheme. It doesn't 
make sense to store information on the disk to be used to locate the disk.

Thanks to everyone for your help, but I guess I will put this problem on 
the back burner for a while (again).

my guess is that fstab and maybe even the initrd may have the full 
pathnames in it, so you'd need to modify them as well, but that is hard to 
do if you can't boot.  using a livecd might be the best option, assuming 
you have one that talks reiserfs.  even then you may not be able to easily 
rebuild the initrd if that has pathnames in it.  redhat systems have a 
rescue mode on the cd where you can boot up and rebuild things like this, 
but it is all command line so you have to really know what you're up to.

Subject: [PLUG] quiet efficient computer cases
Message-ID: <20090529231426.GC13396@gate.kl-ic.com>

Since our new box is being used for speech recognition, a quiet
case is desirable.  Last weekend, Fry's had Antec Sonata minitower
cases for $80.  These contain the same Antec EarthWatt 500W supply
that we were planning to buy for $90, so the buying decision was
easy.  The case is indeed soundproofed - damping rubber on the side
surfaces, vibration-dampened drive slots, 120mm low speed fan, etc.
The main downside is that the 120mm fan has a speed switch on a
cable, and not a mobo connector, so it won't dial itself way down
when the system is idle.  But that is what the power switch is for.

We swapped the supplied (and noisy) CPU fan that came with the
low-power AMD processor for a much quieter Coolermaster CK8-8JD2BOL,
and are using one of the greenpower WD hard drives.  We are using
onboard video, so there is no fan with that.

The result is indeed very quiet, according to my non-tinnitus wife.
Quieter than an idle laptop.

The cases are normally $140, but I expect there will be markdowns
in the future.  Especially on these bulky items in a down economy.

There were a bunch of folks out at OGI (remember OGI?) who were doing
"cutting edge" speech recognition work using neural nets back in the
early 1990s. It was all using neural nets, and it was mostly funded by
one of the phone companies to help automate directory search, etc. I
suspect there are oodles of patents to work around for someone who
wants to build open source speech recognition software.

Keith, how's the performance of it? Is there a genuine opportunity to
build something "better" in open source, knowing that one would
essentially most likely have to start from ground zero?

Y'all may want to become linguists and work on computer speech
recognition and speech production. It is the connection between
computers and linguistics.

It is a vastly complicated matter. You'd need a master's in functional
linguistics coupled with a masters in computer science.

It is a wide open field with lots of jobs and major bux. Entrance level
salaries are typically well over $100K. I know a few students from PSU
who are going this route, although they'll ultimately need to leave PSU
to get the rest of the linguistics they need.

   What we need is a good open source application that allows one voice mail
system to speak directly with another voice mail system. Cut out the humans
in the middle and let the computers talk with each other. No more phone tag.

   To close out this thread, Joe Pruett's insightful interpretation of the
procmail strace output identified the culprit: SpamAssassin is marking the
mail log summary reports (and other innocuous messages from mail lists and
individuals) as spam. They had been tossed away. Now I'm saving them for
review.

   However, since SA had not done this before, I now need to turn to learning
why SA is producing so many false positives and correct that behavior.

   A public 'thank you' to Joe for his knowledge, persistence, and patience.

The truly pertinent piece of this is that the sa magic was in /etc/procmailrc so we didn't see any signs of it in the log.

The moral is don't put /dev/null rules in the /etc/procmailrc file.

Yes, openSUSE puts the IDs in /etc/fstab by default. When you do the
install, you have to *manually* set them to find partitions by device
name or by label. :(

I've never met a happy clam. In fact, most of them were pretty steamed.

Win7 RC 7100 can't mount an ESATA drive on some (if not all)
motherboards, including the ASUS M3N78-VM I'm using.  After beating
my head against the wall for a while, I googled it, and many others
have the same problem.  The workaround, apparently, is to connect
through an ESATA adapter to the regular SATA connections on the
motherboard.  Just as well.  The best insurance against Win7 
scribbling on the backup drive is for that to be unmountable by
Win7.  Even with the informal Eastern European service pack.

BTW, Win7 also has troubles booting after a LiveUSB Linux was run.
No such problem with a LiveCD Linux.  So, no DSL USB.  Not the end
of the world, DSL is somewhat easier to set up on a LiveCD, anyway.

Sorry to bug the rest of you with Win7 stuff;  what is on topic 
about it is that this proprietary OS release candidate stumbles on
stuff Linux has no problems with.  Ease of use, setup friendliness,
capability, Linux wins on all counts.  I imagine the propellerheads
in Redmond will fix some of the bugs, but if history is any guide,
they will add many replacement bugs in the process.
