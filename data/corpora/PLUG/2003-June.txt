Well, I was just pointing out that the effort it would take any of us to
go through your hardware list and look up the driver availability is the
same effort you could forward yourself.  I just mean that you're asking
others to do something you could just as easily do yourself.

Job security isn't for wage earners anymore.  Low job security keeps wages
down and prevents workers from asking too much of their employers.  In the
modern jargon this is called "job market flexibility" and it means that
your job can be filled by a dozen or two unemployed people so your
position is "flexible".

Until something serious changes in the economy or society (like a new
industry is created that everyone thinks they need much like we saw with
the automobile and the internet or a new labor movement sweeps the nation
or a plague wipes out a significant chunk of the population), this is just
how things are going to be.

I'm not quite sure what you mean by this last sentence, but I'm pulling
for you, sir.  I sincerely hope you find a way to get by without losing
too much of your self or your happiness.

To get Realplayer8 to work in RH9,I put the line export
LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5 into  my /etc/profile as follows;

export PATH USER LOGNAME MAIL HOSTNAME HISTSIZE INPUTRC
export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5
for i in /etc/profile.d/*.sh ; do
    if [ -r "$i" ]; then
        . $i

Was this the correct way to do this?

You have a very limited imagination.  Again, I think this says more
about you than about Perl.

I've seen the discipline it takes for *any* code base to get to be
workable for 10 programmers and 100K lines of code.  There's nothing
in particular that Perl does to hinder those strategies.  Only bad
project managers. :)

Heh. Of course. :)

Err. I suppose. But as a hybred language, it is much closer to OO than 
C++ is.

Definitely 1). I tend to be a little obsessive about writing nice code, 
so I think 2) isn't true. When I write code, I am writing a form of 
poetry and I always treat it as such.

You know, I think you are probably right as long as it is someone like 
you and me writing the code (I think my Perl has always been very 
clean). Its just that I have seen way too much code from others that 
wasn't maintainable and probably wasn't scalable.

And you shouldn't. I had some other stuff happening all around me when I 
wrote that note and I was basically venting far beyond what I would have 
normally.

Ah yes, and that hits the nail on the head. Without technically 
competent technical management, everything will always go to hell.

Too many project managers spec'd Ada hoping that it would do their job 
for them, rather than on any virtues of that language.

Neither Forth nor Perl do anything to hinder strategies for 
maintainability or scalability, per se. But they also don't encourage 
it, either. At least, not to any extent that I am aware of.

But I must say that my imagination isn't limited so much as my 
experience is. I have encountered a great many Perl programs and most of 
them have left me a little upset. You are quite right in saying that 
Perl doesn't limit anyone's ability to write good code. But...

And you are right and I humbly apologize for my hasty words. The very 
fact that there are large successful projects in Perl means that 
somewhere there must be some technical management that is capable of 
setting and enforcing coding and QA standards that work. Something I 
have encountered far too seldom in my career.

But, what I was trying to say still holds true though: When it gets 
right down to it, my preference for Java over Perl is mostly a matter of 
personal taste and style. And I believe the same is probably true for 
your preferences as well.

Peace,
-Ron

You can open a terminal and test it with  echo $LD_ASSUME_KERNEL

My only concern is wether or not that would force every application to
use the older threading all the time. Which would defeat some of the
purpose of running an rh9 kernel. It sucks but I would rather do it
myself in a terminal until real releases a player that supports the new
threads. They have to eventually because it's the way 2.6 is going to
be. I would hope they'd fix it in the next 8 months or so. Just my
thoughts. I would hope the same fix is it the pipes for Oracle. They're
java implementation is based off of a jre that doesn't support the new
threads libraries. Suns 1.4 and above is the only release that supports
them. I've been using the beta for a while now with no problems in every
day use.

Of course you are saying to put a wrapper around your realplay
executable, like: realplayer where realplayer is a shell script with:
#!/bin/bash
export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5
/usr/X11R6/bin/realplay $@

chmod 755 realplayer

move it to a directory in your path, like /usr/local/bin.

Then when you want to use realplay*, execute the shell script
realplayer.

CRIME meeting Tuesday 06/10/2003 @ 10AM @ Verizon

Speaker: Dr. Crispin Cowen, of WireX, and OGI

Topic:  ?Defcon Capture the Flag:  Defending Vulnerable Code from
Intense Attack?

Presentation Abstract: Defcon's Capture the Flag (CtF) game is the
largest open computer security hacking game.  Last year's CtF had rules
that made it particularly difficult to be a successful defender.  We
entered an Immunix server, comprised of five years of DARPA-funded
technologies, to see whether this system could survive sustained attack
from determined experts.  We describe our experience surviving Defcon
CtF.


C.R.I.M.E. meets in the Verizon (Airtouch) Cellular building (Take I-5
South to Carmen Drive. The building is on the West side [Tigard side] of
the Freeway). The meeting room is in the back of the building. The talk
begins at 10:00 a.m.The street address is 15575 Sequoia Pkwy, Tigard. 
Lunch generally follows the meeting.

Here is a mail security question:

A few days ago I received a message that contained a .pif file,
obviously a virus infected mail. I'm using Evolution on RH, so I just
deleted it. 

Today the webmaster of one of the domains on my server received an
undeliverable notification from the AOL postmaster, with a virus message
attached. In other words: it seems my webmaster sent out this virus
message:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
From: 	webmaster at bd-4.org
To: 	sclark3650 at aol.com
Subject: 	Re: Application
Date: 	02 Jun 2003 08:13:55 +0000	
Please see the attached file.

<<Attachment: DOS/Windows program attachment (approved.pif)>>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm using AUTH for SMTP. There is nothing in the maillog. The only two
people using email with bd-4.org are both on Linux. There are others on
Windows using other domains on the same server. Mail retrieving is with
ipop3/pop3s on the other domains and on bd-4.org only imaps. 

I'm concerned that my mail server is used to spread virus mails. Should
I move to something safer than AUTH with its clear password transfer?
Any ideas? Thanks!

SMTP-SSL with AUTH?

It's probably just a virus like Klez that fakes the sender's address,
based on something in the infected user's addressbook or browser cache.

CRIME meeting Tuesday 06/10/2003 @ 10AM @ Verizon

 

Speaker: Dr. Crispin Cowen, of WireX, and OGI

 

Topic:  ?Defcon Capture the Flag:  Defending Vulnerable Code from

Intense Attack?

 

Presentation Abstract: Defcon's Capture the Flag (CtF) game is the

largest open computer security hacking game.  Last year's CtF had rules

that made it particularly difficult to be a successful defender.  We

entered an Immunix server, comprised of five years of DARPA-funded

technologies, to see whether this system could survive sustained attack

from determined experts.  We describe our experience surviving Defcon

CtF.

 

 

C.R.I.M.E. meets in the Verizon (Airtouch) Cellular building (Take I-5

South to Carmen Drive. The building is on the West side [Tigard side] of

the Freeway). The meeting room is in the back of the building. The talk

begins at 10:00 a.m.The street address is 15575 Sequoia Pkwy, Tigard. 

Lunch generally follows the meeting.

Viruses such as Klex will scan the infected Windows
user's Outlook address book and sends itself to all of
those receipients, then addresses the email FROM
someone from that same address list. That way, you
can't easily tell who actually sent the email, as it
looks like it was sent from someone else. I would bet
that in your situation, someone had that webmaster
email in their address book, then their infected
computer blamed its email blast on them.

  I've received a few messages supposedly from legitimate domains (e.g.,
aol.com -- and that's not a troll) reporting that a Microsoft-virus was sent
by me to someone at that domain. Because there's no way I can originate (or
pass on) a Microsoft e-mail virus I look in the logs. Nothing there. Then I
traced the IP address from which the message arrived here and I found that
it did not match the supposed domain name.

  Depending on the mood I'm in I either delete them or report them as spam.
There's no way I could have sent that message.

Thanks Wil, Scott and Rich. I know there are about 100 retired people
with little computer knowledge (and of course some older Windows
version) who have my webmaster in their address book. That's probably
the source. 

No SSL on SMTP, but it's planned now.

Hah! That's what you think. :-) Take a good look at your mail log, 
you'll see plenty of entries that show you're already doing SSL on 
SMTP:

  Jun  1 05:03:33 servername sendmail[30187]: STARTTLS=server, 
  relay=franklin.cse.ogi.edu [129.95.40.9], version=TLSv1/SSLv3,
  verify=NO, cipher=EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA, bits=168/168

So franklin.cse.ogi.edu, the main mail server for the CSE dept at
OGI/OHSU, negotiated a 168-bit key exchange with your server. And,
sure enough, you can use the openssl binary (0.9.7 or higher) to
verify that:

  [heinlein]$ openssl s_client -connect servername:25 -starttls smtp
  CONNECTED(00000003)

Just make sure you substitute your real server name for 'servername.' 
:-) Grep your sendmail.cf for '/ssl/' to get all the references.

If it isn't possible, what Open Source environment can be

OK, Paul, SSL on SMTP is enabled but probably only used by you. Now that
I know that is works I will do the hostname and try to move everybody to
SSL. 

A question: when setting the hostname, is there a solution for multiple
domains?

Thanks!

Actually, it's not used by me. It was a server-to-server transaction,
completely devoid of user interaction. Newer sendmail installations,
properly configured, will do STARTTLS to try to negotiate an SSL
connection, bumping back down to plain text if SSL is unavailable.

> A question: when setting the hostname, is there a solution for

Sadly, no. If your users' mail clients do the sort of cert-checking 
they should be doing, then they'll have to send mail using the 
hostname (CN) embedded in the cert:

  cd /usr/share/ssl/certs
  openssl x509 -in sendmail.pem -noout -subject | cut -d/ -f6

I need to automate the download of messages from an Exchange Mail folder
(or two).  I tried to use fetchmail but there are numerous incorrect
headers (these are spam messages) that cause fetchmail to not downlaod
anything.  This is documented on their mailing list as an issue, but
since messages with this problem are usually spam, they are not
concerned.  So I need to find a way to retrieve the mails and put them
in a mailbox on a linux machine.  I need these so I can run sa-learn on
them, therefore the headers should be unaltered.

You might try writing your own client in Perl or Python.  Both have
modules for speaking IMAP.  A couple hours with RFC 2060 and the man
pages and you should be good to go.

Configuring your SMTP server to reject SMTP requests from hosts 
that fail a reverse DNS lookup will help stop some of these.  But 
not all of them.

Thank you Ken.

I know it didn't come from the AOL postmaster, the AOL postmaster just
rejected one of the virus mails because the recipient didn't exist.

As much as I appreciate your efforts around open source, I don't think
calling unsuspecting Windows users 'clueless losers' helps our case.
Most of those I know in this matter connect through dial-up to exchange
their mail and don't have DSL or cable. Being in their 60s they are
happy to have mastered that - something they learned late in their life.
The system is and will always be servicing unsuspecting people. It's the
system we need to change, not the retirees.

Excuse my ignorance here, but wouldn't this reject mail from virtual
domains?

If I have a server with one IP address that relays mail for foo.net,
bar.org, and baz.biz and I sent mail to you from xyzzy at baz.biz, would your
SMTP agent reject it because the IP reverses as mail.foo.net?

And if not, don't most folks put their dynamic pool IPs in DNS with names
like "dialup-123.isp.org"?

I don't see how this practice doesn't hurt you a lot and fail to help just
as much.

No.  The hostname in EHLO/HELO doesn't have to match the domain, just be
resolvable.  The same for looking up the domain name of the sender's
address (these are usually rejected with a temporary 4XX error, in case
DNS isn't working correctly at the moment).

The idea is that most poorly-configured networks don't have reverse DNS
setup, and that well-configured networks will be more vigilant against
spammers.  The sets aren't exactly equal, but close enough that it's
rarely a problem and that it blocks lots of spam.

I think you are okay as long as your message from xyzzy at baz.biz is
forwarded through mail.foo.net and *it's* IP reverse lookups resolve
"correctly".  It isn't a question of what the From: line says.

Jeme> And if not, don't most folks put their dynamic pool IPs in DNS

Then you (and your recipient) are screwed, or you forward through your
ISP or some other helpful host that doesn't fail the reverse lookup.

Sorry, I'm not in a position to ask him such a question. 
You know all this corporate politic, subordinance and other things.
All I can do is to present him with evidences that .NET is a not
worthy technology to standardize upon.
I would be very happy if somebody on this list can provide some
information on .NET vs other technology, preferably open sourced.

Thanks in advance.

Alex,

  Check the Linux World and Linux Journal Web sites. I believe it was on one
or the other where I read a very comprehensive critique of .NET that found
not even Microsoft understood what it was supposed to be or do (based on
conflicting statements they've issued). It is also a collection of failed or
obsolete technology (according to the review) that did not work as
individual pieces so they've all been thrown together in the hope that some
magic synergy would make a silk purse from a sow's ear.

  I'm sure google will turn something up.

I've dabbled with it a bit. Fantastic project! It should be at 1.0 Q4
from what I've heard. That's amazing developement.

I would guess this would work.  Intel does have their LAN cards checked 
for Unix/Linux compatibilty.  Off the top of my head, I don't recognize 
any of the actual parts though.

I would check the integrated audio and graphics which probably means 
going to one of the many hardware sites and looking there. Tom's or one 
of the others and look for the motherboard itself. You might even get a 
view of how your performance will be.

This will be extremely difficult to find, part of the EULA for .NET
forbids publishing any kind of performance benchmarks.

Personally, just the fact that M$ would include this in a EULA makes me
not want to use it.

I agree, I have been doing a lot of it these days and have not ran into
a problem yet. As root you can do an `/etc/init.d/network restart` if
you so desire but if your not getting the results from the resolv.conf
changes that you expect than you might revisit the file looking for a
typo.

Hi Alex,
I'm studying .net towards my degree and my take from instructors and
such is it's MS attempt at Java, since they won't use Java. I'm
unimpressed, and the last unofficial I heard is it's stopped being
pushed do to security leaks and that industry is not inclined to adopt
it based on it's bugginess and failure to be able to port to all
platforms as promised. Google will be your best shot for "Official"
information though. My personal on it is it's VB in a new coat and
pair of shoes and the shoes are too big and the coat too small.
I long for a school that actually TEACHES unix systems. Mike and Ed
are great, but the school sucks as far as *nix. I even hear that PSU
is going to be dropping it's *nix stuff too, which leaves me trying to
decide where to live to get the education I want.

Good luck and if your boss doesn't go for it, take heart, the market
is changing and you may be replacing him sooner than he thinks.

I'm working on joining a Red Hat Samba server to our
NT Domain, using winbind. It seems to finally be
working, but many of our Domain groups have spaces in
them. I can't seem to find a way to add these to my
smb.conf file, is it uses spaces to separate shares. I
have tried enclosing them in quotes and escaping the
spaces with a leading \ but nothing seems to work.

Is there an easy way to do this, or must I rename all
of my groups (groan)?

Very true, good catch. Most of my installs use file dns for host
resolution in nsswitch and it seems to have no effect in that case.

Alex,

I actually do some work with .NET.  Not directly mind you, but being that
my job is to begin to understand it and be an authority on .NET and
JSP/Servlet Enterprise solutions I would like to give a bit of overview.

The .NET which has gone through some confusion changes in marketing names.
 As you may have heard MS changed their new server name from .NET server
to Server 2003 to avoid some of the confusion.  MS approached the
marketing side of the technolgy all wrong.  The concept of .NET is based
on current technologies using SOAP/XML and other 'standards'.  I'll quote
the standards as all the standard commitees always seem to be writing more
specs then actually doing work.  So, MS, IBM, SUN, and any other company
that wants to make a living and provide solutions for today's needs take
some liberties in their coding practices.

What you need to understand is why the request is being made?  Without
that knowing that first, you can't make a decision on the use of .NET and
what it offers verses other solutions.  My daily development is with
JSP/Servlet technology because I support many different platforms.  But
another part of my company and collegues I work daily with are developing
.NET solutions for huge coorporate clients of ours.  We are working
together to find solutions and both technologies can provide a solution. 
.NET has a better security then java applets.  It uses C# (C-sharp) as the
base language which is MS version of java with many different approaches
to how one may have improved java.  They allow certain abilities that java
wouldn't allow.  This gives more flexibility but at the same time is a
limit in other ways. Every decision gives you good and bad results. 
Personally, I think if you are going to write an applet or C# small client
then you might as well write a full C client.  That is a better solution.

The .NET techology is really a way of saying web services.  You should
review what web services are and how they work and see if that is
something that would provide a solution for your company.  Then look at
how java provides those services.  Compare the good and bad.  My company
has hired consultants to analys the pros and cons between java and .NET
and I've seen huge presentations comparing them.

I have determine that the orginally question needs to be answered.  What
are you tring to solve?  Web services are not the end all solution and
give flexibility and restrictions just like any other solution.  If you
like, I could find some of the presentations and see if they are not
confidential and email them to you.  They do not try to say one is better
but compare java and .NET as a web services solution.  That was our focus.

The other issue may be that the boss is hearing the phrase and perhaps
confused on what was .NET and what is .NET now.  They are constant
evolving solutions and some times very difficult to describe.  I do think
it is getting better and has some advantages over other solutions.  But is
that solution what you need?  Even if you can't talk to the boss that
aksed the question you still can ask your boss and present to him/her with
all the possibilites as a solution.  I work on a Tomcat/JSP/Servlet
solution and we have similar solutions on .NET for other customers.  Each
had advantages that each client needed to leverage into existing
infrastructures.

You can contact me off list if you want to discuss this further.  Again,
I'll look for the presentations tomorrow and let you know if I can share
the results.  Unfortunately, I may not be able to share them with you.  I
could perhaps summerize them a bit.

Good luck with the research.  I know that asking or convincing a boss of a
technology solution is sometimes a difficult task.  I have fought for open
source solutions to redistribute and it has been a long hard battle and in
many ways my little office has done things that have other offices
jealous.  At the same time, I do see the other commercial solutions we use
as some nice technology I would like to try.

Josh

Copy that, Mike and Ed are very cool.  I guess it's important to certify
in Microshaft just to be able to deal with it, though my attitude is to
put that off till the last in my education to avoid costly
recertification.  My dream is to ignore Microsoft altogether.  I wonder
who's responsible for the push towards Microsoft at PCC and PSU where it
is clear that Microsoft has failed to duplicate the quality of the
alternatives at a reasonable price?  

Anyways, I've had some fun trying to do some GTK work though I could use
a comprehensive book on the tool kit.  Unfortunately, I don't have a
month to learn how the functions work by going to the source.  

I don't know the politics of a MS higher education institution so I
can't comment very wisely on what should and should not be done about
it.

Anyone want to give their take on Oregon State?
A networking book from their bookstore is focused on Linux's advanced
routing capabilities so from that standpoint the institution looks 
promising as a PSU alternative.

As far as .NET goes, I agree if you ban benchmarking in a EULA that your
dishonest.

When I read the EULA for .NET it don't remember it mentioning that
benchmarking was banned, just that you couldn't publish the results
without permission from Redmond. Did they change the EULA or did I just
misunderstand it?

Don't know the cause for your problem, but I copied attachment files

used it just like any other file.

Michael was replying to my original statement:

"This will be extremely difficult to find, part of the EULA for .NET
forbids publishing any kind of performance benchmarks."

Which was what I remember reading, I guess I equated "permission from
Redmond" with "if it is published it is not a real benchmark".

Anyway, I don't agree with the practice.

I don't either, though the practice sounds similar to someone else's 
EULA that said that reviews could not be published.

Could it be a firewall problem? Like is port 80 alowed to pass?

Is the Ip pingable from the outside world?

I have Gentoo with a 2.5.68 kernel running on a similar board, 
the Intel D845PEBT2. The SoundMax audio works, the ethernet works, 
mine doesn't have built-in video. So basically except for the video which
I don't know about, this system works quite well.

Seems like port 80 goes through OK, when he sees a 404 (which is HTTP
traffic both ways). 

Sounds more like a problem with the virtual domain setup on Apache to
me. 

Billy, is it really your server that returns the 404? Then check the
Apache error log and your domain setup.

NOTE:  The CRIME meeting has moved to Wednesday the 11th of June.

CRIME meeting Tuesday 06/11/2003 @ 10AM @ Verizon

Speaker: Dr. Crispin Cowen, of WireX, and OGI

Topic:  ?Defcon Capture the Flag:  Defending Vulnerable Code from
Intense Attack?

Presentation Abstract: Defcon's Capture the Flag (CtF) game is the
largest open computer security hacking game.  Last year's CtF had rules
that made it particularly difficult to be a successful defender.  We
entered an Immunix server, comprised of five years of DARPA-funded
technologies, to see whether this system could survive sustained attack
from determined experts.  We describe our experience surviving Defcon
CtF.


C.R.I.M.E. meets in the Verizon (Airtouch) Cellular building (Take I-5
South to Carmen Drive. The building is on the West side [Tigard side] of
the Freeway). The meeting room is in the back of the building. The talk
begins at 10:00 a.m.The street address is 15575 Sequoia Pkwy, Tigard. 
Lunch generally follows the meeting.

I'm new at this.  I earned $689.85 in my last check and since I
guess the limit for not reporting is $500 that I am responsible
for the taxes.  Is fica really %10.5 for everyone?  I'm a 23 year
old dependent with $500 of outstanding subsidized stafford loan
to pay off @ $50/month, I owe darn near everything I've earned 
so far.  One thing I wonder about is if amounts earned below the 
minimum tax level will be reported by my employer, i.e. if I get 
a $200 check after two under hour weeks will I have to pay taxes 
on that amount?  Is $10.50/hour reasonable for a person with a 
general studies degree from PCC?  Can anyone guess my income tax?

I wish I could get a job with stable hours, benefits, better pay, 
and Linux training.

  I'm not an accountant so I recommend that you contact one for definitive
answers. If you're self employed you need to file quarterly tax returns to
the IRS and state. You also need to pay other taxes, depending on the
jurisdiction in which you live. The least expensive way to find out is to
call an accountant for advice specific to your situation. I can give you the
telephone number of my accountant if you wish. She charges only $65/hour;
exceptionally reasonable.

Talk to the IRS and your state's revenue department if you want ACURATE
and FREE tax advice. They're happy to help, especially if you call some
other time than mere days before the end of a fiscal quarter.

If you want technical help with Linux or even just interesting
conversation with a Linux theme, you've come to the right place.

If you want anecdotal information that could land you beaucoup bucks in
penalties, fees, and interest, we might just be able to help you there,
too.

To put it more kindly, I wouldn't recommend trusting tax advice that
didn't come from an accountant, a lawyer, or the government itself. Your
livelihood, and even your liberty (should your ignorance result in
fraud) are at stake here!

For example, one might suggest that if you're earning less than 10,000 a 
year you could blow off quarterly filings your first year and talk to an 
accountant at the end of the year to see how it's going. The anecdote 
would say the IRS doesn't impose fines in such cases because it's not 
cost effective for them. But then, they can and they certainly might.

Well, think about it.  You're on a unix-like system and you run evolution
as a regular privileged user.  What could anyone do to a file that would
make it so that you couldn't copy the bits into an email attachment?

Try `file /tmp/evolution-500-1218/evolution.wMmFq8/Forms_Legal_.PDF` and
see that it's really a PDF (or at least appears to be one by the rules of
magic).  Make a copy of it.  Try to delete the original.  Open it with a
PDF reader.  There are lots of things you can do to assure yourself that
it's just a file and bits are bits.

Good Afternoon,

I was just thrust into the support role at my work to repair a hacked
corporate web server.  I wiped out the hard drive, installed RH Linux v9 and
had a great Linux experience. So I am now motivated to consider Linux for
another project ... I found this group and I thought I'd seek some advice.

I have an  original iMac (OS X/Unix) running as a server at home that needs
to be migrated to different hardware and I am considering options and would
like some advice.  I am serving for a foundation that I run along with a
dozen or so other non-profit organizations on a DSL line (UPS, local
backups, etc.).  I need good reliability and decent uptime - but the server
load is very light overall hundreds of visits per week - all static pages.
I would like to be serving streaming video in the coming months (when the
upstream DSL bandwidth is increased) - for perhaps 2 or 3 users at a time.

I will run Apache, Mailman, an e-mail server and DNS - that's about it. No
file sharing, no local user on this machine.

The question I have surrounds hardware. My only real requirement is decent
reliability with >99% uptime, and USB so I can KVM with my desktop hardware.
What would you suggest and why? A few things I am pondering (target cost is
$200-$300):

* I have found a commercial grade server with dual PIII-500's in it for
$275.  128Mb, 9Gb This seems like the best deal to me - but, can I install a
PCI card to get the USB interface that I want to run the system
post-configuration with USB keyboard and mouse?.

* Fry's has a P4-1.1G or so for $229

* I could build a box - what processor would you suggest - do I need P4 or
would PIII do the job?  Any special power supply or motherboard
requirements?

* A slew of Dell machines on eBay for $100-$300 that are used desktops -
most with PIII 500+

Or would a slower machine work as well?

* I have a PowerComputing PowerTowerPro box that is server grade with a
PowerPC processor in it.  I am game to try a Debian install (even though a
try about two years ago was fruitless) - but this box does not have USB
(would use a PCI add-in and I am concerned that the ease-of-use of Red Hat's
one-click software up to date process would not be available).
 
Thanks!

Are you familiar with the excellent capabilities that ssh and 
other applications can provide you? I have a server less than 
5 feet away from me that does not have a monitor or keyboard 
on it. It is very simple to manage and use Linux without 
being a local user.

RedHat doesn't make a product that runs on PPC so you'll have 
trouble using their one-click update process anyway.

However, Yellow Dog Linux 3.0 is basically a re-compile of RedHat 
8.0 for the PPC processor.  They don't use RedHat's UpToDate 
product, obviously, but they do have a couple of their own 
updaters:  apt-get and yum.  Neither is "clickable" since they're 
CLI apps, but yum ran pretty flawlessly for me the one time I 
tried it, and the first thing that came to my mind was, "hey, 
I'll bet I could script this, and just run it in a cron job!"

Yes I am, thanks.  In fact, I am thinking of putting the server headless in
another room where noise is not a problem once it is up and running.  USB is
probably more of a want than a need.

But is would be nice to take advantage of the GUI that some of the
applications provide occasionally - I presume that some sort of remote
control software exists for that event.

Dean,

I've not (yet) used it, but I believe VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is
what you want...

    http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/

It is part of the RH linux distros...

[bigfish at kippered bigfish]$ apropos vnc
Xvnc                 (1)  - a VNC server
vncconnect           (1)  - connect a VNC server to a VNC viewer
vncpasswd            (1)  - set password for VNC server
vncserver            (1)  - start a VNC server application
vncviewer            (1)  - VNC client application

FWIW, my web server is an ancient Pentium Pro-S (SMP with matched CPUs w/512
KB cache) w/256Mb RAM running RH7.3 and Apache 1.3.27. It does yeoman's
duty, though it also has a relatively light load...

    http://herring.org/usage/
    
Availability > 99% (as long as PGE isn't mucking about)...

  4:05pm  up 102 days,  9:15, 10 users,  load average: 0.28, 0.38, 0.39

You don't need a lot of beef for linux (although I can't speak to what
streaming video may require).

cheers,
Sandy

It's my memory that we renamed our groups as the only reasonable
work around to this problem.  groan.  Underscores are your friends.

I'm about to send out a couple postings relating to O'Reilly Open
Source Convention, but first I want to remind people that

           O'Reilly Open Source Convention

                      will be

                    July 7-11, 2003
                         at
              The Portland Marriott Downtown
                 1401 SW Naito Parkway
                   Portland, OR 97201

Monday and Tuesday will have special tutorials.
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday will have the general sessions
The vendor exhibition will be Wednesday and Thursday.
Check http://conferences.oreillynet.com for details.

Like most professional conferences, this conference is expensive.
Get your employer to send you if at all possible.
We want O'Reilly to make money on this conference and bring more
events to the Oregon Open Source Community.

If you do sign up to attend, you can probably still get a 30% discount
by admitting that you are a member of the Portland Linux/Unix Group
and giving the secret but widely published code "os03pug"; and remember
"You are a member of the Portland Linux/Unix Group if you say you
are a member of the Portland Linux/Unix Group".

If you can not afford to attend, you can:

       -  Attend the vendor's exhibit on Wednesday and Thursday.
          I'm not sure how much this costs at the event.
          It may be as much as $100.00.  However, an Exhibit Only
          Pass is FREE if you register on-line at
                    http://conferences.oreillynet.com.

       -  Volunteer to work at the conference.
          PLUG has negotiated 20 positions.
          More on this in a later posting.

                                          Sincerely,

I'm talking with O'Reilly about having a booth at the O'Reilly Open Source
Convention.  I haven't thought about the details yet, but I was thinking
about a joint booth for PLUG, MWVLUG, and ELUG; unless MWVLUG and ELUG
were thinking about doing something on their own.

As I said, I haven't thought about the details yet, but I'm just letting
people know that I may be calling for some volunteers to help man the
booth.

O'Reilly needs 20 volunteers to help with the O'Reilly Open Source
Convention on July 7-11, 2003.  Actually, they need ten volunteers
to work on Wednesday and ten volunteers to work on Thursday; and
they will give all 20 volunteers passes to the main conference
(Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday exhibits and sessions).
To sign up:

       -  READ the rest of this posting.
          I have appended O'Reilly's invitation to this posting
          which describes everything involved in helping them.

       -  If you still want to volunteer, email me at dmandel at pdxLinux.org

       -  Or you can sign up at tonight's MWVLUG meeting in Corvallis or
          Thursday's PLUG meeting in Portland.

I will build a list of volunteers from your responses and forward the
information to O'Reilly.  If we get more than 20 volunteers, I will
build a stand-by list and see if I can find other opportunities.

                             Volunteering at OSCON

    O'Reilly & Associates would like to extend a special invitation
    to all Portland Linux/Unix Group members to attend the O'Reilly
    Open Source Convention Sessions for FREE (Wednesday - Friday,
    July 9th - 11th) -- a value of $1095 -- in exchange for one full
    day of your volunteered time and service at the Convention.


                                   Details

    We are currently looking for a total of 20 volunteers to help us
    out by monitoring session rooms and verifying attendee badges on
    the days of Wednesday, July 9th and Thursday, July 10th .  We need
    ten committed volunteers per day (for a total of 20), and space is
    available on a first-come, first-serve basis.
    (Email address required for volunteer instructions and verification.)

    Only one full day of volunteering is required to gain free access
    to the convention sessions.  Volunteering does not require any heavy
    labor or special skills.  On your chosen day of service, you will be
    required to work from 9:00 am until 5:30 pm.  A one hour lunch break
    (on your own) is included in the work day, along with two 15-minute
    breaks.  Your free convention pass will include all events during
    the Convention (Wednesday - Friday) including entrance into the
    Exhibit Hall and all Exhibit Hall events.

    This offer *does not* include any tutorials (Monday - Tuesday).
    However, if you are interested in purchasing a tutorial pass to
    attend a day or two of tutorials, you may use this discount code
    to receive 30% your tutorial fees.  Discount Code: os03pug

    Sign up on the attached volunteer sign-up sheets to confirm which day
    you will commit to volunteering your time.  You may want to visit our

Subject: [PLUG] HTTP 404 - File not found
Message-ID: <MEEKKAPIMDJAJLIOBCHCCEOCCLAA.bmdimaculangan@bhpi.com.ph>

We have 2 boxes here. The mail server and web server. Recently our ISP is
hosting our web server and the mail server stays with us. Until we changed
ISP and now we both have our web and mail server with us.  The web server is
up and running which we setup and configure after we've change ISP.  The
problem since then is our mail server, we cannot access the web mail, but we
can send and receive email using MS outlook through POP3.  We've advised the
ISP for the IP address that we've used and properly configured gateway
address that they've given. Using another dialup account, sending ping
request to the IP address of the mail server seems to be no problem but
sending ping request to the hostname of the mail server was unsuccessful.
Accessing through web browser the IMP web mail with the hostname or the ip
address gives an HTTP 404 - file not found error. I've already checked the
logs and still nothing new.  What configuration are we missing?

TIA

This means that your DNS change hasn't caught up with you.  Did you have
someone change the DNS setup?

This could be because the client isn't capable of sending the hostname. 
Fix your DNS before mucking around with the server.

Good Luck

Okay... I've used it now... thanks for asking the question, Dean - it
incented me to try it. One tip I learned along the way... if you're going to
use gnome as your desktop /and/ you already have an instance of gnome
running, you will want to modify ~/.vnc/xstartup to unset your
SESSION_MANAGER environment variable...

    #!/bin/sh

    # Red Hat Linux VNC session startup script
    unset SESSION_MANAGER
    exec /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc

Also, if you want to see the Nautilus panel, run vncviewer full screen.

Very cool stuff.

cheers,
Sandy

A co-worker of mine was having difficulty with X on a ATI PCI Radeon
7000 today. 

The fix was to comment out the "dri" line in the XF86Config file. "dri"
is only used with AGP cards (or so I'm told).

Russell> I did try upgrading the BIOS from P09 to P13.  No diff.

Just a followup:

After returning the second ATI card and getting a third ATI card (they
said the second one tested fine for them), we had the same behavior.
I was ready to just box up a motherboard (we had two afterall) _and_
the /sbin/fsck'ing card and ship them both to ATI and ask them to
figure out what was going wrong.

As a last thing to try before _really_ trying to hold the vendors feet
to the fire, I checked and found yet another BIOS upgrade available
from Intel (ATI doesn't have flashable firmware as far as I could ever
tell ... never got a hint otherwise in correspondence).  I read the
release notes and there was nothing that remotely seemed to address
our problem, but I installed it anyway (when status quo isn't working,
change for the sake of change is good).  Lo and behold, it suddenly
works.  All I can figure is that there was some firmware conflict that
got the box wedged _really_ early on and that the latest Intel BIOS
either accidentally or on purpose fixed it.

In all the time we were trying to figure out what might be going
wrong, we got no really useful advice.  We got some whacky ideas from
the gamer community, mostly disregarding all of the information that I
had provided.  My father even boxed up his system and took it in to
some PC repair outfit in Beaverton (not mentioning any names, but
they've got an ad in the yellow pages) and got some _really_ voodoo
explanation that the video card was toasted (he reportedly couldn't
get it to work in any of his systems even though ATI said there was
nothing wrong with it when they got it back) and that any motherboard
it was placed in would be permanently toasted too, and vice versa, ad
infinitum.  He said in order to free ourselves from this vicious cycle
we'd have to replace both the motherboard and video card at the same
time.  Sorry, my stick-pins are all away at the cleaners.  I'll stick
to Planet Earth were the laws of physics apply, thanks!

As far as I know the video card is still working.  But since I took
the phone off the hook and am filtering my dad's email off to
/dev/null, how would I discover otherwise?  ;-)

So you're saying that by flashing the BIOS with an "unrelated" update the thing 
started working?

The concept of magic is introduced a little too often to hardware, I think. It 
mostly comes in when there isn't a logical explanation. Think of it as Salem 
witch trials for your desktop...

Not that it matters in this case, but lots of the attributions to me in your post

How does determine the version of 4.x being used and is 4.3.0
experimental?

Are there any experimental drivers for the Intel 845GE chipset?
Is there any current board on the market that is
completely Linux compatible, all hardware on it well supported.
I could ask for an Athlon board.  I'm not thrilled about the
idea of a dead video slot not do I trust having Linux detect that
there is a disabled device like it does on the D815EEA2 boards
I have.

According to xfree86.org, 4.3.0 is the current release.  It hasn't
made it into Debian unstable yet.  I suspect similar pokiness in other
distributions but have no first hand information.  You can always
compile it from source.

Message-ID: <001501c32a7a$8a32fd40$1f7cadcf@ao.lop.com>

    My work schedule prohibits me from going to meetings, but I could use some help. I have a 1GHz Athlon with two very large hard drives (100GB main drive, 160GB secondary drive). My bios will only allow Windows to formayt 128GB of that second drive. 
    I want to crate a dual-boot system with Windows residing on the C: dirve (the 100GB) and Linux splitting the 160GB drive into two 80GB drives. (I hope the BIOS allows me to do this). I want to eventually use the Linux part of the system to do all my business (Internet, publishing, etc.) and use the Windows part of the system for recreational uses, eventually migrating everything over to Linux if possible. I also want to transfer my work documents (which include images, .doc files and dozens of PDF files) to the Linux part of the system (so I hope that whatever distribution I get includes both openOffice,org and Acrobat Reader for Linux). I've also heard about some of the various
    Is there anyone who can help me with my system? I am expecting to get DSL soon (I"m on dialup now) and while my ISP is going to be Qwest/MSN, I hope that isn;t all that relevant to my ability to use Libux to control my Internet connection. I'm more concerned with things like RealOne Player; I don;t know if there is a Linux version and it's the only way I can use the account I have with Major league baseball that lets me listen to live and archived games. I'm also concerned about the Windows sports sims I play -- if I can play them using a Windows emulator I'll be very happy. Finally, I have a whole bunch of source files that I'm going to want to transfer to the Linux system (I may have already mentioned this -- it's lkate) incluidng all my MP3s, my work documents, and a collection of about a hundred electronic RPG books that I want to read intact. (I"m an e-publisher by profession, so it;'s important that i maintain compatibility with the people whgo are seniding me art and text files).
    Does anyone know what I should, or can, do in this situation?

Some first-hand info: :-)

  [heinlein]$ cat /etc/redhat-release 
  Red Hat Linux release 9 (Shrike)
  [heinlein]$ rpm -q XFree86
  XFree86-4.3.0-2

That's semi-tricky. You can run xdpyinfo and get the version of 
XFree86 that's serving up your local display:

  xdpyinfo | head

Getting X info from a remote host is harder. The intuitive thing would 
be to ssh into a remote machine and use xdpyinfo -- but will still 
report your *local* info.

On a remote machine, you'll either have to poke around /var/log or use 
the package manager (rpm, apt) to figure out what's there.

I suggest putting 3 partitions on the 100GB drive, a 50-100M boot
partition, the ~98.5GB windows partition and a ~1GB (depends on your
memory size) linux swap partition. This way all your boot information
is on one disk, and when your running linux from disk2, the swap will
be on a separate disk.

You can leave your work documents on the windows partitions and still
access them from Linux, but not the other way around, so it's probably
best during the migration to leave the documents on the windows side.
Several distributions include openOffice and the include pdf readers
such as xpdf.  You can get Acrobat Reader for Linux directly from the
Adobe website if you need it.

Realplayer 8 is the latest version on Linux. I have never come across
any realmedia that Realplayer 8 could not handle, but that doesn't
mean there isn't any. Maybe the guys at Thursday's meeting can answer
this.

I don't know about the RPG books, maybe somebody else on the list has
experience with RPG books under linux.

RedHat 9 has it. Now if I could only figure out how to get
Ctrl-Alt-Backspace to kill the server... Used to be the default and
Option "DontZap"
disabled it. Now C-A-B does nothing, and I even tried Option "DontZap" "0"
and it still does nothing.

Message-ID: <20030604180445.GD20025@eli.net>

There's an overlap in the Portland Perl Mongers meeting and the PLUG
interests this month so I thought a cross-post might be appreciated.
Cross-posting won't be a common occurrence so if you're interested in
Perl, join our list: http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/pdx-pm-list .

Note: this info is also on http://portland.pm.org/ . The website has
      links and pictures, too.


== Upcoming: Portland Perl Mongers Technical Meeting ==

We have a full evening of events planned for the Wed, 11 June 2003
meeting. This is an all-O'Reilly evening, starting with books and ending
with modules plus food along the way.


== Agenda ==

7:00 - 8:30ish
    Rael Dornfest and Rob Flickenger talk about their Hacks series at Powell's Tech.

8:45
    Walk to House of Louie, order pu-pu platters and agar pudding

9:00 - 10:00
    chromatic on Mail::SimpleList
    portland.pm t-shirts for sale! Buy one, impress you; buy two, impress me too!


== Gory Details ==

Powell's Technical Books
33 NW Park Ave.
Map: http://snurl.com/1ify

Rael Dornfest and Rob Flickenger, authors of O'Reilly's best-selling
Hacks series (Google Hacks, Linux Server Hacks and Mac OS X Hacks), talk
about their top-rated tomes, answer questions, and reveal a few of the
private hacks that didn't make the series.

Powell's will be giving away a Hacks book with any O'Reilly book
(excluding Pocket References) purchased all day June 11.

---

House of Louie
331 NW Davis St.
Map: http://snurl.com/1ig0

Walk over to House of Louie. It's about 5 or 6 blocks away.

House of Louie

This month's Perl Mongers meeting will be held at House of Louie, in the
back, in the banquet room. Please support our local business by ordering
some food or drink! If this proves to be a good venue, we'd like to be
welcomed back with open arms.

First: announcements, banter, witty banter, unwitty banter, social time,
t-shirts for sale ($9.99 + $0.01 S/H)

Next, chromatic talks about Mail::SimpleList:

    You've used Perl at work. You've programmed for other people before.
    How do you take a project from idea to execution? How can you add
    new features to your own projects without going crazy?

    Mail::SimpleList is a simple-but-effective project written in
    Perl. chromatic will demonstrate how he wrote it, from ideas to
    design to tests to implementation and explaining how
    Mail::SimpleList works, why he made the design choices he did and
    what he learned all along the way.

    chromatic will touch on mail filtering, object orientation,
    test-driven development, customer testing, deployment, refactoring
    and the normal ups and downs of any type of software development.

See you there!

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.52.0306041140520.10900@shaft.bitmine.net>

Hi.

I have this system here on my desk (at work) that I can't really make boot
from anything other than the hard disk.  It has some version of Mandrake
installed and poorly configured.

I set up the network interface and inserted the Debian boot CD I needed,
but I can't seem to find a baseconfig executable that'll allow me to just
do the installation from the CDROM without actually booting the CD.

Does someone have a suggestion?  I'll keep pluggin' away at it.

Did you double-check the obvious?

Is the BIOS set to prefer booting from a CD before booting from the hard
drive? Can you boot Knoppix or some other CD-based distro to verify
CD-ROM bootability? Some ancient CD-ROMs weren't El-Torito compatible
(bootable).

Why not distribute an open replacement format for RPG that is
universal?  Docbook may be a good place to look.  I have never
understood why restricted documentation formats are so ubiquitous,
isn't publishing about communicating information to others in mass?
Perhaps you can publish an RPG book that teaches your customers how
to migrate to a format that is friendly to both Linux and Windows.

I think it's some odd combination of the BIOS (a Dell monstrosity) and the
onboard SCSI controllers (Adaptec 7880).  I can't seem to boot from the
floppy or the cdrom.

I tried pulling the filesystem images off the Debian CD and mounting them
as loopbacks and then running `chroot /mnt/point linuxrc` and that got me
MOST of the way there, but then, of course, I got all these warnings about
repartitioning a mounted disk and I couldn't screw myself completely, now
could I?

So there it is.

Just to clarify, RPG stands for Role Playing Game.  Most ebooks I've 
seen are PDFs, so fairly universal.

Hmm.  I don't know the hairy details, but you could try loop mounting
the floppy images, look in /etc/inittab.  There is a dbootstrap
mentioned in the docs, but I didn't find it in a brief search.  Ah,
yeah.  Loopback mount root.bin and look in its /sbin/dbootstrap.

In that case explore gtk/gdk, I could use some insights myself such as

This is probably a problem with your scsi adapter bios, not the system
bios.  Can you separately configure your scsi adapter to boot from the
cdrom?

Yeah, I tried that.  I changed the expected boot device ID from 0 to 3
(the ID of the CDROM), but no go.

I'm going to try the bootstrap thing... probably tomorrow.

I played with Knoppix for the first time today, on
three different computers, and I was quite impressed.
I can see a lot of uses for this distro, for fixing
screwed up Linux or Windows machines, introducing
people to Linux, firing up an ssh session from
someone's house who doesn't have Linux, etc.

My only problem was on my wife's computer it
mis-identified her monitor, and tries to run it at
1280x1024, which it can't handle. It goes all fuzzy of
course, but I can get in with Ctrl-Alt-+ to lower the
res, but it uses that wacky virtual desktop size
thing. I tried fixing the settings in XF86Config
manually, and also by using one of the wizards (I
think it was Configuration Panel, Peripherals,
Display, or something like that). Problem is, I need
to restart X for the changes to take effect, but this
just restarts Knoppix again, and it forgets my
changes.

Is there a way to restart X in Knoppix without
rebooting?

I suspect all your 'G stuff is useless in linux.  It would appear that 
there is no driver support now or even on the horizon.  Do a search at 
http://groups.google.com for your above pci card and linux and see the 
negative responses pile up.

It always seemed to me [1] that programming in Perl is a bit like playing
the guitar: it's an instrument that requires little effort to become
passably mediocre at, but it's damned tough to master. Then again, pretty
much any programming language will be tough to master, and once you master
one, you usually can move on to the others with significantly less effort.

[1] NB: This is my opinion, and is not meant to be construed as fact. :-)

Have you tried any of the kerenel boot params? Knoppix has a host of
things you can tell it at boot time that can fix that sort of thing.

Explore the F-keys when you are at the boot prompt, I think you want
something like "screen=1024x768" or whatever.

So if you have a SCSI CD on the system I would suggest opening the case and
temporarily putting an IDE CD ROM for the install.  The assumption is that
you BIOS can handle booting from CD.  If this fails use a floppy to boot
from.

The router you ordered will not be a total loss for your network. This
is because 802.11g routers will also talk 802.11b and you can connect to
them using those cards at the traditional "11mb" speeds. 802.11b has a
wide amount of support under linux. I would suggest that your best
support is going to be a card with a Prism2 chipset, however there is
also great support for the cisco 340 and cisco 350 cards (the 350 is
100mW card and is fantastic) or the Orinoco Silver or Gold 802.11b cards
from Avaya. 

Here's a list of some Prism2 cards.
http://www.personaltelco.net/index.cgi/Prism2Card

Also http://www.netgate.com has one of the best prism2 cards out there
with a 200mW antenna.. Sweet.. but at tad pricey compared to some of the
30mW cards out there. And here's a dirty little secret. The Microsoft
Branded cards are Prism2 cards with 30mW antennas. 

Hopefully there will be 11g driver support for Linux eventually. The
technology is not going away any time soon.

Did you try it with two hyphens (--keystroke)?  That would be the

Not for unclutter, actually.  It doesn't use the GNU getopts syntax,
preferring its own [one hyphen][full option name] syntax.

It had been in the back of my mind to look for a progam like this, so
I just installed.  It works nicely except for the -keystroke option.

Message-ID: <1054838251.14597.8.camel@rhws.theplatinumrule.com>

I'm really enjoying my 4 gigs of mp3s lately. I own and have all of the
original music. My problem is the tiny little font that comes with the
playlist buttons. I've manipulated the font of the list itself so I can
read it, but the "add" "del" "sel" "opt" and "list" buttons have tiny
fonts on them, as are the menus that they pull up. I've resorted to a
very ugly high-contrast skin to be able to read them, but I'd like to
change their size.

I'm familiar with the double size option, but that only works on the
main player window.

Has anyone encountered/overcome this issue?

There is a bootloader that used to come with Slackware - basically it
emulated the bios function of "boot from device" - you write this image to a
floppy and boot to it - it will then come up with a spiffy menu that allows
you to choose from all the differnet detected devices in your system (i.e.
individual partitions, CD-ROMs, floppys, etc..) I used this to install from
a CD on an old laptop that would not allow me to boot from the CDROM.. I'm
sorry, I don't remember the name of this utility or the name of the
download.. I just know it was on an older distro of Slack..

Can anyone else remember? I want to know again now as well -- it was
helpful! :-)

Thanks,
Matt

No, I have the same problem - it becomes extremely unusable at 1600x1200..
For me the double size works as I generally only have the main window
active. There are different skins that will have different colors - a high
contrast font on a theme will help to overcome this.

A couple of things you can do to get around this

Senator Brown pointed me to the opportunity to address Portland's 
Eastside legislators all gathered together in order to hear from the 
people (that's us). It looks sweet:

SPECIAL COMBINED TOWN HALL MEETING
***
12  East Portland Legislators,
Plus: Senate President Peter Courtney, and
Senate Ways & Means Co-Chair Kurt Schrader

Monday, June 9th
7:00 PM - 9:00 PM

SENATE LEADERS TO JOIN EAST PORTLAND LEGISLATORS AT A SPECIAL COMBINED
TOWN HALL MEETING JUNE 9TH 

PORTLAND - Leaders of the state Senate and House will join legislators
representing North, Northeast, and Southeast Portland and East Multnomah
County for a rare combined town hall meeting on June 9th at 7:00 PM at
Grant High School.

Senate President Peter Courtney and Senator Kurt Schrader, co-chair of
the Ways and Means committee, will be the featured guests. They will be
joined by: 

Sen. Kate Brown 				Rep. Deborah Kafoury
   Senate Democratic Leader 		   House Democratic Leader
Sen. Margaret Carter 			Rep. Jeff Merkley
Sen. Avel Gordly 				Rep. Laurie
Monnes-Anderson
Rep. Jackie Dingfelder			Rep. Diane Rosenbaum 
Rep. Gary Hansen				Rep. Mike Schaufler
Rep. Steve March				Rep. Carolyn Tomei

The legislators said their goal is to bring the Legislature to the
community, since few citizens have the time to travel to Salem during
the week. "This is their Legislature and their government.  We want to
hear from them," Brown said.

Check in the localstatedir (I normally set this to /var but your install
may differ) for httpd.pid. Either mv the file to a different name or rm
it.

On my system, this only changes the playlist font size, not the button
fonts. Does this change your buttons and their associated menus on your
system? If so, which version are you running? 

I had already found this adjustment, I was hoping there was something
less intuitive.

Bust open ~/.xmms/Skins/<your_skin>.whatever with the appropriate
decompressor, then work on pledit.bmp to your hearts desire :).

pledit.bmp contains all the buttons for the playlist editing
functions, you can make them look like anything you want. (well, I
cant, because I lack the artistic ability, but you get my drift :).

If you work in a directory inside the Skins directory, then your
modified skin will appear in the skin browser with out any additional
work.

I was just thinking it might one of those things where they decided to
conform to the convention but forgot to update their documentation.  But
I guess not.

First, find and delete your httpd.pid file. As root, try

  /bin/rm -i $(find /var -name 'httpd\.pid' 2>/dev/null)

Second, install the links program. For Red Hat, install the elinks 
rpm. For Debian, install the links package.

I don't think I'd worry about it.  If there are no corresponding messages
in /var/log/messages for /dev/sda, then you're probably not having any
hardware problems.

It looks like the partitions were created specifying a block count for
partition size rather than entering cylinder values.  What I don't under-
stand is why the physical and logical size difference messages are being
printed.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0306060828450.24118-100000@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I've asked this before and cannot find a locally saved reply. If someone
points me to how to search the mail list archives I will do so. According to
the Web site's FAQ the search engine is broken and the link to skylab goes
nowhere.

  My problem with mozilla-1.2.1 is that bookmarks added during a session
disappear when the application is shut down. This is a relatively new
"feature" and very frustrating to suffer. Doesn't matter if I use ctrl-d to
put the bookmark on the main menu or I navigate to a category and save it
there. They're gone the next time I log in and fire up mozilla again.

  I thought the solution was to copy the bookmarks.html file to a backup,
then delete the bookmarks.html file. Nope. If someone has the answer I
promise to keep it safe this time. And, I'll modify ~/.bash_logout to do the
magic for me.

TIA,

Rich

I'm not sure if this makes sense, but it looks like the partition was
created with a 16 head scheme, and the kernel is trying to read it with
a 255 head scheme.  Did you move the drive to a different controller
after you partitioned it?  Most modern drives will simulate either
scheme, so it isn't fatal, but it looks like the kernel is missing the
ends of the primary partitions.

Good Luck,

My advise is to take the Linksys stuff back, get a prism 2 or 2.5 PCI
card and set that up as your access point on your debian box, no need
for the extra device.  I've found the NetGear MA311 to be reasonable,
but you need to install the hostap drivers.  If you're running debian
stable, you'll need to go to http://hostap.epitest.fi/.  If you're
running debian unstable, just install the hostap package, then follow
the instructions in the readme.  You'll need kernel headers to be
available, because the package creates kernel modules.

Good Luck,

Derek Loree

Sounded great. My skins were at /usr/share/xmms/Skins, though.

I did bust that thing open and double it's size. It appears that the
button locations are mapped in that graphic. Doubling the size of
pledit.bmp did modify the buttons, but the image that the skin
interpreter used was chops of the various buttons that fell into it's
preset map.

I'll try the xmms folks to see if that map is adjustable.

I REALLY need the help of a Linux guru soon to get my system up and

Hopefully someone can come over here and help me get my system sorted

how to get them onto my hard drive from CD.

I'd love to come over and help you get your system going - I charge
$40/hour, if there is a server install it will be $65/hour with a two hour
minimum, all time is rounded to the nearest half-hour.. - which I find to be
a reasonable fee... ;-)

If you are not willing to pay, perhaps you might bring your system to one of
the many install fests that happen?

If that is out of the question, be verbose, explicit, in depth - work with
us, not against as.

Now what again is the problem? :-)

Welcome to "Labor Market Flexibility; or, the third world economy brought

I'd be perfectly willing to get your system up and running and doing
everything you need in exchange for groceries and a ride home.

I've never seen this behavior with mozilla (post the first 1.0 "stable" 
release).  I do remember seeing bugs with some of the 0.* releases where 
bookmark files could get clobbered.

Have you tried any later version?  1.2.1 is actually a relatively old 
release.

If your spare drive is NTFS you will have to use some other media
(either a separate computer, floppy, cd, ...). NTFS support isn't at a
useable state in linux yet.

>From here on I'm assuming your spare drive is fat32 (vfat).

1) Make a mount point.

	Mountpoints are just directories. Usually they are empty but
	they don't have to be. 

   $ mkdir /mnt/spare

2) Determine the device entry for your spare drive.

	(Most) devices in Linux are accessed through an entry in
	/dev. IDE Hard disks are accessed through /dev/hdX, where X
	is determined by the device location. For example, /dev/hda
	refers to the first drive on the first controller (the Primary
	Master in BIOS speak), /dev/hdb is the Primary Slave, c would
	be the Secondary Master and so on..

	To access a partition, a number is appended to the drive device:
	/dev/hda1 is the first partition on the Primary Master. You
	can use cfdisk to see the partitions on a drive:

   $ cfdisk /dev/hda
	
	Be carefull that you don't make any changes, unless you
	understand the consequences.

	I'll assume your spare drive / partition is /dev/hdb1
	(this is the first partition on the Primary Slave drive)

3) Mount the spare drive:

   $ mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt/spare

	This may not work. The most likely error will say something
	like: "specify a filesystem type". If that is the case, try
	this:

   $ mount -t vfat /dev/hdb1 /mnt/spare

4) Once the filesystem is mounted you will be able to see the files on
that partition by looking in /mnt/spare (or where ever you mounted
it). You can copy files from here to somewhere else, or use them in
place. You may need to be root to work in this filesystem. (This can
be changed, but I don't know how off the top of my head.)

5) You may want to have this drive mounted all the time, to do that
you need to make an entry in /etc/fstab (the mount point will persist
untill you delete it, unless it is in a ramdrive or some volatile
storage, or in a /tmp partition. Most likely it will persist).

Add this line to the end of your /etc/fstab:

/dev/hdb1	/mnt/spare	auto	defaults	0	2

Now this drive will be mounted each time you reboot.


Video:

mplayer and xine are both good video players. Knowing what distro you
use will help me explain how to get them / install them if you can't
figure it out.


.doc files can be opened with openoffice.org's writer and a few others.

.pdf files can be viewed with a host of things, if you don't have any
aversion to using non-free, closed source software, you can download
Acrobat Reader for Linux from the adobe site. Otherwise look into
xpdf, or just search for "pdf viewer" (or similar) on freshmeat.net.

.mp3's can be played by many, many things. The most popular is
probably xmms. It is virtually indestinguishable from winamp. Freeamp,
mgp123 and mp3blaster are some others.

Your distro probably set up your cd already, put a disk in and look in
/cdrom or /mnt/cdrom (this location is distro dependant). If one of
thoes two directories exists and is empty, try this:

$ mount /cdrom

or

$ mount /mnt/cdrom

and check it again. If you had to use mount to see the files you will
have to use umount before the cdrom will open to take the disk out.

$ umount /cdrom   (or /mnt/cdrom...)

You cannot umount a drive that is in use (if you have a shell that is
in that directory, that counts as "in use").


Hope this helps.

-Rogan

I have Debian PPC on an old Umax S900 (PowerMac 9600 clone), which is
about the same era as your PowerTower Pro. Installation wasn't too
difficult, but you do have to understand the hardware (no click-n-drool
install interface). Everything seems to work OK, though I haven't tested
it out too rigorously.

If oen took place ont he weekend and someone could give me a lift, that
might be an indea. Red Hat 9 is already installed , but it needs a lot
of tweaking and I am not a very skilled tweaker.

To put it at its simplest, I have a spare hard drive physically inside
my computer but not attached to my system. It is full on a
non-functioning Windows XP professional and about 50GB of files that it
created when it worked. I don't care about most of the programs
(although it would be nice if I could run some of the games under an
emulator), but I have about 300 document files, 100+ PDF files, and 300+
MP#s that I'd really like to be able to run under Linux. the directories
are too big to copy onto a single CD (or even a single CD each) and I
can;t access the files at all right now. I'm not entirely sure what type
of formatting the hard drive was done on, but I'm, pretty sure the only
real solution (plugging the drive into a Windows system with a CD/RW and
backing up the My Documents directory onto multiple CDs, then loaing all
the CDs  contents into my Linux system, wiping the hard drive, and
plugging it back into my system mounted and formatted for Linux) would
be at least a full-day job.

I have other problems. My printer is a USB-based lexmark Z65. Lovely
printer -- great quality and very fast. problem is there's no Linux
driver for it that I know of.It was literally build with windows XP in
mind exclusively -- I'm not sure it would even work with a Mac. I need
to find a printing solution and some way to mount the pritner (and i'm
not entirely sure how USB works in Red Hat 9 anyway).

Then there are my CD drives. One of them is a DVD-ROM drive, and it
would be very nice to be able to play DVDs on it. I knpow my sound card
and speakers work in red Hat, I just don't knwo if Red hat recognizes
DVD drives as such, would recognize a DVD if I put it in, or if there is
software that could play it.

I'm sure there's more, but I don;t want to be too verbose or I'll never
finish the note.

Oh, one more thing -- I'm writing this with webmail because I can't get
evolution to recognize my mail server password, and i have the same
problem with Mozilla mail.

Umm.. ok.. If he want's "access" (i.e.readable access) to an NTFS partition
then this is built into the kernel (as long as it was compiled in or as a
module.. With Redhat I can almost guarantee it is..) I have been using the
NTFS module to read my XP partition for quite a while - at least two years
or so (but back then it was a 2000 partition).. Mandrake has a utility to
resize an NTFS partition.. Perhaps "NTFS write support is not in a stable
state on linux yet" is what you meant to say?

Subject: [PLUG] Red Hat 9 - syslog - iptables - console messages
Message-ID: <279250-2200366721381116@bctonline.com>

Red Hat 9
Use of the LOG target in iptables causes the log message to appear on
the console as well as in /var/log/messages.
The netfilter docs say that iptables logs at the 'warning' level via
syslog.
I've tried setting the kernel console logging in syslog.conf to 'err'
(and every other level above warning) but the messages still appear
on the screen.

syslog.conf
   orig:  #kern.*		    /dev/console
   new:   kern.err		    /dev/console

I'm assuming that since the console line was originally commented
out, that syslog must default to copying it's output to the console
screen.

Please advise on how to prevent the iptables messages from apearing
on the console.  It's very disruptive because the firewall blocks
(and logs) a lot of packets.

I've also sent this to Red Hat...

Subject: [PLUG] Problem getting motherboard on a Linux compatibility list...
Message-ID: <1055022279.27931.61.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Considering Linux started on an Intel 386 it is ironic that I am having
a hard time finding a 100% compatible Pentium 4 board but that is
exactly what I'm running into.  According to http://www.xfree86.org the
845G would be a good choice but so far the closest I have seen to that
is the 845GE which does something strange when you ask it to disable the
onboard video according to Intel's specs.  Does Intel sell a motherboard
without integrated video, lan, and sound or other Windoze only
components anymore?  Potentially they could be disabled, but Windows
98SE needs to go on the board I get where 98 has a bad habit of trying
to fix disabled devices.  Intel has no shame if it doesn't offer a good
Linux choice in a Pentium 4 board.  My VA503+ machine has been nice
because there isn't a single part that causes problems with 98SE or
Linux.  If it weren't for hard drive failure and the fact that 333 mhz
is way to slow these days I'd want to stay with it.

Under 98 all I have left is Warcraft II and TI-92 software for a usb
uplink.

Is there any business in the Portland, Scappoose, St. Helens area that
understands I will only go with a 100% Linux compatible board and that
I want to be as current as possible?  Preferably Pentium 4, although 
a 1 gig PIII is a good minimum guideline.  100% compatible means that
no devices on the board need to be disabled to use it with 
Linux.

As far as ASUS, etc., what's the best Intel alternative these days?

I am having no trouble with the Intel D845PEBT2 that I bought at
Fry's.  it has built in sound and ethernet and USB, (no video) all of
which I was able to configure to work with Linux. I don't have any
idea whether it works under Windows.

  Apparently I've not followed this thread closely. However, a few months
ago I went to EMU (on NE 122nd Ave.) with a rough idea of what I wanted for
a replacement for my main server/workstation. I hit a slow time and was able
to speak with them about my needs and the initial components I had selected.
Based on their advice I bought a different motherboard and a faster speed
AMD processer (a 1.8G model). Anyway, I ended up with a complete system
(minus the tape deck and cd-rw I'll take from the existing system) for $500
and it's at least 6 times faster than the system it will replace. Amazing!

  I've decided to go with AMD rather than Intel and the components I bought
are all well supported by linux.

 I got a ASUS P4GE-V from ENU in Hillsboro.  It has onboard video and audio.
Since I was building a server I was not concerned about the onboard audio.
The onboard video works great.  The only problem that I had was that it took
three trips to figure out that I had purchased a bad P4 processor.

I'm running RH 9 on it with 1 GB RAM and RAID 5.

10) Support for migrating from a Windows NT 4.0 domain to a Samba

Well, I still haven't been able to get this to work.  Here's what my
main.cf looks like:

        reject_unknown_hostname,
        check_relay_domains

body_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/body_checks
header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/header_checks

smtpd_client_restrictions =
        permit_mynetworks,
        reject_maps_rbl,
        check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/access,
        permitsmtpd_helo_required = yes
smtpd_helo_restrictions =

        reject_maps_rbl,
        check_helo_access hash:/etc/postfix/access,
        reject_non_fqdn_hostname,
        reject_unknown_sender_domain,
        reject_unknown_hostname,

        permit

smtpd_sender_restrictions =

        reject_maps_rbl,
        check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/access,
        reject_non_fqdn_hostname,

        reject_non_fqdn_sender,
        reject_unknown_sender_domain,
        reject_unknown_hostname,
        permit

Here's the /etc/postfix/badip and badaddr files (and I did run 'postmap
badip' then 'postmap badaddr' which generates the .db files)
[root at sparky postfix]# cat badip
12.129.211.145                  OK
[root at sparky postfix]# cat badaddr
ipowerweb.com                   OK

Still get a rejection like below:

I presume that the "Message content rejected" is due to the body_checks
filters.  Is it something easy I'm screwing up, like the order of
appearance of the filter checks in main.cf?  I've done a 'service
postfix restart' in between each change- that should get it to reload
main.cf I'm sure.

Any other ideas?  This is driving me nuts!

Thanks

Funny note, I could not even _send_ this email to PLUG outbound through my
mail server because it contained the phrase "You are receiving this email
because you..." is blocked by the body_checks file.  I had to temporarily
disable it for the mail to be relayed.
Doesn't that sound like I have a real misconfiguration somewhere?  I did
not think that anything in mynetworks was subject to the spam filters on
outgoing mail, just inbound from the world.

Probably a dictionary-style attack, a lucky guess, a random shot in the dark. 
Spammers (AKA loathesome execremental bipeds who do not deserve to live) do 
not care how much of their spew is wasted. They live to spew. If you haven't 
experienced spam attacks on your domain name, you've been lucky. 

Also take a good look at the headers, if jon at manymoons.net is not your default 
"catchall" account, it could be they spammed 'jon at manymoons.net', using the 
other address in a forged header.

I am constantly amused by the 'usernames' spammers attach to my domain.
e.g.

    eskim
    mozart
    starb528
    carbuncle
    sadcom
    srsiler

to name but a few of the recent attempts. I've even gotten bounces and AV
auto-acks due to spammers who forged phony users at herring.org in the From:
header. Scumbags. /dev/null them and don't lose any sleep over it.

Even sillier, I am getting spam that uses message-id's as email

Okay, finally my Postfix whitelisting problems.  It only took all night :)
My most recent problem was that despite how many "OK"s you have for an IP
address or domain name, header_checks and body_checks appear to be run no
matter what, on all mail, even if it was previously accepted or "OK"ed. 
Not exactly what I was looking for, but now I understand it and can live
with it.  While I haven't been able to completely test the rest of my
whitelists, I conclude that Ed's original suggestion in this thread about
creating a separate map file will be completely successful.
Here is an excellent 3-part article that thoroughly explains a lot about
Postfix's UCE controls and is easy to understand:
http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1593
To answer Wil's query along the way:
 "At present, specifying a header pattern with OK serves no useful
        purpose. A rule ending in OK affects only the header being
        matched. The next header may still result in a REJECT match,
        causing the mail still to be rejected."
The above applies only to the contents of header_checks & body_checks.  In
other words, the "OK" stops checking (and order is important) and will
accept the email if specified prior to header_ or body_checks.  I
concluded that the only way to stop a rejection occuring in header_ or
body_checks is to comment that line out.
Thanks for the help along the way!

Supposedly Intel P4's have a faster bus speed. but if the memory isn't
any faster than the AMD Athlon chip, I'm guessing that this is an
irrelevant fact.  I was told that AMD's and Intel's chip are price
matched so that there is no cost advantage to AMD.  I've also been told
that AMD is a poor compatability choice.  Needless to say, my old AMD
386 and my K6-III have been very good systems.  As far as a reliable
general benchmark, I wonder if the AMD outperforms the Pentium 4.

It's hard to get Habas to talk about AMD, in fact he wouldn't do
research into Linux compatability despite there being good ways
to do it at no cost insisting I make do instead with the 865GE or
some other unlisted Intel chipset.  ColumbiaPC in St. Helens does
sell Athlon XP systems, but basically I'd guess you have to know 
what you want and say you want to buy it explicitly, because Habas
currently has a different idea about what his customers should buy.
Habas won't advertise Athlon XP right now because he thinks that 
Intel P4 systems cost the same also believing that Pentiums 
are a better deal than an Athlon.

He's better than Preheim's in Scappoose, that guy will not refund bad
parts doing exchanges only.  Incompatabilities are not considered  
a valid reason for exchange there or there is no credit.  I Ended up
getting stuck with a Fujitsu drive that Linux for some strange reason
can't partition into any less than a single primary volume.
Picked up a case that ended up costing $90 even though
it probably should have cost $59.  It also surprised me that even
though I asked for an ATX case that there was a usb 2.0 connector
cut into the side leaving me wondering if the case really was ATX
and if it would work at all.  Needless to say, his one non custom case
should have been cheaper, but wasn't.  This case fiasco was only maybe a
month or so back.

ColumbiaPC is only eight miles away from me and it's better than an
picking up an E-Bay wonder, the potluck can be a bad scene sometimes.  
I also figure it's better than Fry's as Habas will take faulty hardware
back and Fry's won't, especially if you don't know you have faulty
hardware until after the return deadline.  Habas orders what you want,
it's a shame he only MCSE certifies though from what I've seen.

His email is habas at columbiapc.com

Having a book on sendmail, unlike qmail, I wonder how it's going with
the supposed security problems that are supposed to be intractable in
sendmail?  I have a better chance of configuring sendmail well with
spam and virus filters than the chance I have of accomplishing this
under qmail.  One change I want to make to qmail is to teach it not
to accept a mail transfer if it determines that the return to address
is unusable.  The latter trick would cut all the spam I'm getting so
far.  The other fix I want to do is I want to allow anyone to send mail
to my domain while maintaining the rule that only my local users can 
use my MTA to send mail outside my domain.  The security I have now is
tighter than that and it is causing me trouble, I have to have every
domain I want to be able to receive mail from listed in rcpthosts.

My other curiosity with qmail is how to give a user another email
address without adding a Linux login account while maintaining
a seperate Maildir for that other address and the option
to forward mail to the original email account.

I ran sendmail at first, but I didn't know enough about maintaining it
or it got cracked because it just got slower and slower and broke at
one point.  I still using sendmail for a null client on one of my
servers.

That must be it.  I will check.  I just thought it was funny because
this is the first time it has happened in over two years of serving my
own mail.  I have seen attempts to spam non-users on my system in the
maillogs but this is the first one that made it to my inbox.

But, it must have been a BCC.  That makes sense.

Where can I find Linux software that allows me to accept AOL instant
Messenger users? At least one and possibly more of my colleagues refuses
to use ICQ (supposedly the Windows version plays havoc with firewalls)
and I need to get in touch with him every so often my a more immediate
means than e-mail. I know there is software offered that allows access
to the AOL IM network -- I've even seen it listed as coming with some
dsitros. However, although LICQ came with Red Hat 9 this software did
not (or at least I don't recongize it if it did).

If there a website that offers a comprehensive listing and download
point for Linux Internet software in general?

Gaim is probably the best, and also has support for most of the other IM
servers as well (MSN, Yahoo, ICQ, Jabber, etc)

You can add Yahoo! to the list of domains that discriminate against us cable customers who send email. They don't reject us like AOL, but anything sent by us goes directly to recipient's bulk mail folder.

I created a mailertable file to tell sendmail to use smtp.comcast.net to transport mail destined for Yahoo. The 12.225.234.96 is the IP assigned to me by the cable company. Mail that I send directly out goes OK, I only get the time-out error when I pass the email off to smtp.comcast.net. Anyone know why this happens?

I look here:

In that order. None are comprehensive (that I know of) but I've found a lot of

As direct-to-mx is heavily abused by spammers, it's a reasonable defensive 
move. Thank the spammers.

Message-ID: <E19P6a9-0000e4-00@bridget.jatol.com>

Ximian Evolution 1.2.2, which i got in my Red had 9 distro, is not
collecting my e-mail. neither is Mozilla mail, for that matter, but
that's beside the point.

Whenever I try to access mail.seraphimguard.com, I get a
Username/Password mismatch error. Since the password works fine with
Webmail I have no idea what's up. My web host's tech support hasn't been
able to tell me anything this weekend.

I get my mail through my company's server. It only has a capacity of
10MB, and it's half full. I'm going to lose mail if I don't start
downloading mail to my hard drive quickly, as I recieve about 1.3MB
worth of mail a day.

What can I do to get Evolution to recognize the connection and the
server? Since it doesn't work with two different programs, I don't think
it will work with any of the e-mail programs I have on my computer.
problem is I don't know whether the problem is on the server side or on
my side.

In the mail preferences for that account check the 'Receiving Mail' tab
in the Authentication type:

You can click the "Check for supported types" button and it will check
the mail server to see what the proper type is.. You can also choose
from the drop down.. 

Try checking there first..

I am considering a new career change soon which will require a lot of coding,

My partner says a Apple Ti-book is out, so what I'm looking for is x86

Im assuming that win2k will work on just about all x86 if I have to install 
it, but what I'm really interested in is a laptop that is very linux 
comatible from one of the major vendors (Compaq/HP, Dell, Gateway).  It 
should supports at least 1400x1050 display, long battery, DVD (a writer would 
be a plus) built in ethernet/modem (built in wireless (802.11a) a plus), usb, 
serial, audio out, blah, blah, blah and something that works great with Linux 
power management, modem, video, sound.  Touch pads are good, finger sticks 
are bad....  I've spent the last year fighting with my Compaq Evo 600n trying 
to get it to work.  As long as it isn't on battery it works fine.

For a reasonable price (under $1000 great, under $1500 ok).  Laptops change so

positive experiences?  Or should I slashdot this question.....

Sony Vaio GRX series, many Dells, and most Thinkpads support Linux well. The 
tricky bits are built-in modems and sound. Power management is a big fat pain 
in Linux, because it is still a work in progress at the kernel level, but I 
hear tell some folks get ACPI going OK. See the IBM store on Ebay for good 
deals on last year's models. For example, they have some A31s with wifi and 
CDRW for $1499. Forget bidding, some dork always bids too high, so IMO it's a 
waste of time. http://www.stores.ebay.com/id=23983696&ssPageName=CompLaptpTS

See http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/ for the complete dish on what works.

I can tell you what doesn't work, though they're both older.  Toshiba 
1715xcds is pretty miserable.  Toshiba in general has a good track record 
with Linux but this was a very low-end model that wasn't made by them and 
they probably wish they never put their name on it.

The other, a IBM (excellent Linux record) ThinkPad 600e.  Mostly okay, no 
wheel action with an external mouse.  Hopefully, IBM has changed the chip 
that breaks an external mouse.  Good keyboard feel (hate the layout though) 
and overall build quality.  Power management is not perfect but lots better 
than the oem'ed Toshiba.

In short, check out IBM and don't automatically dismiss Toshiba based on one 
model.  Compare machines side-by-side if for nothing else to evaluate the 
display quality.  If you're gonna code on the thing, it better be bright and 
sharp--large doesn't hurt either.

Cheers,
Kyle Accardi

I'm using an external mouse with a T20 and RH9 and the wheel works
great.  Could be your X configuration or mouse driver.

I hoped as much, but I've enabled wheel mice on many machines just fine & 
today was bored enough to google and it looks like a known issue for this 
particular model.  Kernel patches were in the works two years ago, but 
that's the latest info in the first 60 hits or so.

~2gigs, give or take. I found the redhat 9 installer to be nicer (it
actually let me change to dvorak before I needed to type anything,
fwiw I'm back to Debian regardless.)

I imagine you could install in excess of 6 gigs if you tried, but
don't quote me on that.

Believe it or not, I was able to solve my own problem. It was on the
server side, in the settings. My server wanted the full e-mail address
as the user name. I tried that and it worked like a charm. My inbox in
Evolution now has the 1000+ messages that were on the server and I won;t
lose any mail after all.

I feel brilliant now.

  I've had two Toshibas -- the latest the four-year-old Portege 3025CT which
is the finest notebook I've owned. It's run only linux and the power saving
features (apm) work just fine for me.

  One factor that I suggest be carefully considered is weight. My Portege
weighs about 2 pounds. With AC power brick it's still a reasonable weight to
carry through airports, meetings and all sorts of backing-and-forthing. My
original laptop -- a Gateway in 1992 -- was about 7 pounds by itself. That
got old very fast as I hauled it everywhere. Much better than the original
Compaq suitcase luggables and still better than the Kaypro-2000s, but heavy
as a lead brick.

  When I need the external ports or floppy drive I take those along.
Otherwise I carry the stripped down version with only the Ethernet and
modem/serial pcmcia cards and I've never missed the weight of hardware not
needed.

  So consider the trade of weight for components that you won't need on a
constant basis.

telling me that my email settings have changed, but
they won't tell me what they are. They want me to
download a Windows or Mac executable wizard, which I
don't want to do. I don't trust them, and I don't know

They say they'll post instuctions for manual settings
next month for Linux users. Does anyone know the new
Comcast pop3, smtp and newsgroup server settings?

I had some weird font trouble with gaim and then found everybuddy.  It
worked great!  It is now an actively developed project called ayttm.
Looks much better even!

Don't know about news/nntp, but here are some mail hosts:

  [heinlein]$ host smtp.comcast.net
  smtp.comcast.net has address 24.153.64.2
  [heinlein]$ host imap.comcast.net
  imap.comcast.net has address 24.153.64.69
  [heinlein]$ host pop3.comcast.net
  pop3.comcast.net has address 24.153.64.3

There's also a mail.comcast.net that points to the pop3 server.

It's funny you should mention this - I called them on Friday and said, "I
can't run your software, what does it do so I can change it manually" - they
responded with "It does many things. You must run it!". I made the mistake
of telling this person that I dual boot (thus effectively admitting that I
COULD run it but chose not to.) He then said "You have to!" I told him I
refused to install it. This was then implied:

If I did not run this software...

1. My internet connection would die
2. My email account would go away
3. My emails would go someplace else since the attbi domain won't be there
anymore and someone else would read them.
4. I would be breaking the rules and thus liable for some sort of damage.
5. I was a moron

Maybe the last one is right.... But still..!! :-o It wasn't until this
thread that I was entirely certain of what the software did - and since I
don't use my attbi account I found it a complete waste of time...

Qwest has a great deal on DSL, 4M up/ 1M down.. $160 month...... I need a
raise..!!

Hello,
  I was wondering how to determine the total amount of physical memory

just tells me the total amount of ram, FreeBSD isn't so forthcoming on
it's top display.  Does anybody know a way?

Look at 'dmesg'.  It's shown at boot time in one of the first few
lines.  IIRC, you have to add up the several types of memory presented.

Subject: [PLUG] dhcpcd crashes consistently
Message-ID: <3EE4D645.2030103@pacifier.com>

This happens on two different laptops, the only commonality is similiar NICs 
(Intel Pro100 pcmcia) and RedHat 7.3.

After booting the laptop, an address is assigned okay from my dhcp server 
and I start an ssh session to another machine.  After ~2 minutes the 
connection locks up.

Client's (laptop) /var/log/messages reads,

dhcpcd[1047]: sendto: Socket operation on non-socket
dhcpcd[1047]: dhcpStop: ioctl SIOSIFADDR: Inappropriate ioctl for device
dhcpcd[1047]: dhcpStop: ioctl SIOSIFFLAGS: Inappropriate ioctl for device

I switch to vt2 and can ping the server so the interface stays up, but
whatever causes this glitch, nukes ssh.

If I close the xterm (killing the ssh session) and open another xterm and 
start another ssh session, everything works fine forever.

process 1047 reads
/sbin/dhcpcd -n -h dinky eth0

Q: Does this look like a driver issue? (Have had good luck with the e100 
driver for pci nics)  Or is it a dhcpcd issue?  (Two other machines are also 
using this daemon and e100 for pci cards and do not have this problem AFAICT.)

I'm in the midst of a switch to broadband from dialup as I write 
this.  After looking at Comcast and Qwest, (and the irresolvable 
security problems with cable Internet) I settled -- reluctantly 
-- on Qwest DSL, with Peak.org as my ISP.

Reading the post below gives me some comfort that I just might 
have made the right decision.

Does Java have some sort of extention mechanism that lets you wrap your C
code into a shared lib that can be loaded into Java?  Actually, I think it
does since the swig page lists java (http://www.swig.org) as a supported
language.  That way you can just use your C code unchanged - AND since
you're talking about mathematical functions they'll be a lot faster in C
than in Java. I'd recommend checking out swig (Simple wrapper
interface generator) for doing this for you automatically.  Swig is a
great tool.  I used it to wrap a computational geometry C++ lib so that I
could access it's objects from Ruby.  I suspect you can do the same with
your code to access the C functions from Java.  Another advantage of swig
is that if you decide that you want to use another language later (like
Perl or Ruby or Python instead of Java) then you can very easily use the
same C code and by changing a commandline argument to swig, generate a
wrapper for the language of your choice.

BTW: I'm doing a talk at OSCON on mixed language development with Swig.

Sounds more like the tech didn't know what was going on.  From 
everything I've read about the switch over is that the email will be 
forwarded from the attbi to the comcast account.
I'm expecting some sort of Snafu, but I don't think it's going to that bad.

Of course, I also went ahead and got the Cable TV deal.  I used to have 
to reset my cable modem frequently. Since then, only once. Hmmmm

Don't worry, you'll be equally disappointed with Qwest should you have
any questions or a problem, I know I was when I had Qwest as my DSL
provider.  As far as I've seen the only way to not be completely
disappointed with your provider is to spend lots and lots of money.

Probably.  I've been with DSL-Only with a Qwest DSL circuit for over two
years and cannot recall ever having a single problem.  They're even good
enough to set the reverse-DNS for my static IP as I wanted it.  (I use
my own mail and DNS servers, so I really only use them for bandwidth.)

Honestly, I doubt it does anything more than change some default 
browser settings (home page, proxy[?], mail server) and, perhaps, some 
standard mail client settings.

I fully expect to be able to power cycle my cable modem at the end of 
the month and just get new DHCP settings.

Hey, is there a simple way to get an OpenBSD interface to forget its 
current DHCP settings at get new ones?

I use SpamAssassin with Perl 5.8 at home and work -- no perl-caused
problems to report at either location.

Yes, I've seen some reports of problems with Perl 5.8 on the
amavis-users list (for amavisd-new, which uses SA).  I have a client
running it however on Red Hat 8 which has Perl 5.8 and has been for a
number of months.

This CAN be true, but having worked at a company that had a "special"
overpriced contract with Sprint for a couple of T-1s I can say that lots and
lots of money doesn't always equal satisfaction either. I cannot count how
many times the upstream DNS server would delete the reverse dns records. It
was always an "oops!" situation involving the CEO's email getting rejected
from a client that would alert us to this situation too!!!

Hi all,

I've found this great firewall, based on Debian Woody, that runs the
root file system from a CD (http://www.gibraltar.at/). What I like is
that it will save its configuration to a floppy, USB storage device, or
a harddrive.  In particular, I really like the idea of being able to
save to a lockable USB storage device (no floppy disk sitting in the
drive - exposed to the elements).

The question I have is about USB storage devices.  Have any of you tried
to re-partition them?  I can get fdisk to recognize the drive (cfdisk
won't open it), and read its partition information, but I didn't have
the guts to delete the partition.  The winblowz tool that comes with it
can format it and make it bootable (win'98 only), but there doesn't seem
to be any partitioning tool.

TIA,

Derek Loree

USB storage devices under Linux are handled by usb-storage module which
should create a scsi host, so it will appear in /proc/scsi/scsi. The
disk will be /dev/sda if it's the only SCSI disk you have, or the next one
available, sdb, sdc, etc. You should be able to fdisk, format, and do
whatever you want with it. I have 3 external USB disks, that's how they
behave. Plug them in, check dmesg to see what device just got added, fdisk
them.

I had even worse experience with a big national provider and a pair of
T-1's.  How about staying up all night (more than 4 hours - starting at
midnight), on hold to tech support (both T-1's were down), because they
had a glitch in their phone system that made everybody stick in the que,
no way out.  Or: deciding that the pair wasn't worth the money, placing
the order with explicit directions to call me before the change was
made, and coming in to work a week before the change was supposed to
happen to find two dead circuits (only took eight hours to get it back
up).  The really stupid part was that months later, the billing
department was still billing us for the pair!  Then there were the DNS
problems, man what a nightmare (I told the boss we should have run our
own DNS, but you know bosses)!

Compared to that, QWest is nice and friendly.

You forgot the biggest advantage - static IP addresses.  With DSL it is
trivial (either no charge or a little extra charge) to have a static IP
address, and a more can be had for a small fee.  This does depend on the
ISP, but you do have a choice.  Cable only allows dynamic addresses and
no choice of ISP's.

I think Ken should expand on the security problems of cable, I haven't
read about any problems that a properly configured firewall couldn't
deal with, but then again I chose QWest instead of cable.:)

Good Luck,

As previously noted, SWIG does a fair job.  Java has the Java Native Interface 
API.  This is really pretty much a Java-to-C API (and vice versa I think).  
Never used it myself, but I have a book on it :-)  Look up JNI online at the 
main Sun Java site.  I seem to remember it being quite thorough.

If you're going to be doing some heavy lifting in the math world, then you 
should look around and make sure that someone hasn't already done the work of 
wrapping highly optimized libraries for you.  I keep hearing about scientific 
computing projects that use Java, so someone's done some wrapping.

Code translators will give you code that works, but a good way to do things in 
C may not be a good way to do things in Java and vice versa.  I've never used 
any of the tools, so I'm not going to guess how long it will take.

Best,
Kyle

The device is there, I can mount it, read from it and write to it.
However, it isn't a real disk drive, it is one of those key chain
storage devices (64Meg NexDisk), and I can't find any concrete
information about how the partition information is stored, if it can be
changed, or if it is possible to have more than one partition.  Seems
like someone out there must have tried this.  The fact that cfdisk
chokes while reading the device is a little worrysome.

All of you who have a choice between cable and DSL should count
yourselves very fortunate. I'm too bloomin' far from our CO to get
DSL, so unless someone sets up a long-distance WI-FI network in
Gladstone, cable is my only broadband choice. (Well, ISDN may be
available, but I'm not going there...)

That said, I have to say that my experience with @Home/ATT/Comcast has
been very uneventful, which I count as a Good Thing. I work from home
two days a week and never worry about my connectivity. Lately, it's
far more likely that our Verio/ATT network connection at work will be 
the source of any problem.

Still, I'd go with DSL if I could, just so I could host my own servers
here at home without violating the cable AUP.

Three years ago or so, Ted Mittelstaed told me that there was a deal
in the works whereby independent ISPs could backend a cable connection
in a manner analogous to the way they can be your DSL ISP. I haven't
heard anything about it, but I'd certainly give it a good look if the
opportunity every came my way.

Comcast has an "upgraded" package now that allows 2.5Mdown/384kUp that comes
with up to 5 static IPs.. With that small of a pipe upstream it doesn't seem
entirely worth it ($99).

Yes, this is one thing they DON'T tell you when running cable - there are so
many damn bored script kiddies anymore it is not even funny - and since
cable modems still have the 'lan effect', these kids sit and port scan all
attbi IPs (i.e. 12.x.x.x). I get an average of 5-10 unique attempts on port
80 a day, all trying to various IIS exploits. I get port scanned (1-4000 or
so) at least once or twice a day. I get specific targets hit (i.e. smtp,
ssh, telnet) ALL day. In fact I can pretty much be assured that at any given
moment someone is probing my defenses.

This is the #1 main reason I want off broadband - some of my already limited
upstream bandwidth is ALWAYS being shared with malicious and/or curious
folk.

If it's anything like compact flash, you can fdisk and partition it any
way you want, as far as Linux is concerned. My USB readed with a flashcard
in it appears also as a SCSI disk. Of course, cameras have their own idea
about the proper format, so I let them do it, but Linux can put any
filesystem and partition table on it.

I have not actually tried this myself, so I cannot vouch for it.  
However, several network engineers whom I trust have told me the 
same thing.

The security problem with cable modems is the same problem with 
any shared-media network:  all traffic on the network can be seen 
by all nodes on the network, making it trivial to sniff traffic 
and capture everyone's email, passwords to Web sites, chat and 
any/all other activity.

Now, it's true that any 'hacker' who can compromise a router can 
do the same thing, but for the love o' god at least it takes a 
little bit of skill to crack a router.  Apparently all that's 
needed to sniff cable modem traffic is to put one's ethernet 
interface into promiscuous mode.

Most people will respond with, "I have nothing to hide" but are 
you SURE?  Are you sure you've NEVER said anything in an email 
that would be embarrassing if your neighbors knew about it?

Suppose you were running for office, or were a volunteer for a 
political campaign.  Are you sure no one would be interested in 
your emails?

It's one thing for someone halfway across the world to read your 
steamy love letters, but quite another for them to be read by 
people you see every day in church, or PTA meetings or whatever.  
Imagine your daughter trying to seek advice online because she's 
afraid she's pregnant... would the kid down the street have a 
field day with that?

Care to explain what the lan effect is?  Especially since every protocol you 
listed is routable.  Sorry to disappoint you but there is no lan effect for 
cable modems.  Every packet you generate must go back to the CMTS.  If there 
is no CMTS you can't just talk with your neighbor.  DOCSIS doesn't work that 
way, it's not Ethernet.
If you're not protecting your computers with a firewall that's your fault.  It 
doesn't matter whether its cable, dsl, T1, OC3, or dialup.  You put a 
computer on the internet, it's your job to protect it.  Every firewall in the 
world gets hits, that's their jobs.

Kyle,

  When I looked at the SWIG Web site I saw a section on JNI. I'll get to
reading more about this, I'm sure.

  Aside from a couple of folks working for private companies or offering
highly-specialized soluttions doing the type of modeling I'll be doing,
there's only one person in the country actively producing work in this
field. The other one with a very high degree of knowledge is the retired
head of the Department of Biological Mathematics at the University of
Alabama/Birmingham. He's 83 years old now and I'm drafting the agreements
that will allow me to buy his code and expertise. I'm talking about fuzzy
system models that use fuzzy sets to describe linguistic variables and are
manipulated using the mathematics of fuzzy logic (t-norms, anyone?). Ergo,
nothing's available.

  Well, let me modify that. NASA wrote a expert system modeling tool and Sandia Labs
translated it from C to java. A unit of the Canadian government made fuzzy
modules for each. Other than the original NASA code (in the public domain)
use of the others costs big bucks: $15,000 and up. Also, they are neither
complete nor well written systems and the fuzzy portions are designed more
for control than for decision support systems.

  My friend and mentor would let me use his code but he signed it over to
his new company (he's started four software companies over the past few
decades and sold three of them; one to IBM for a figure comfortably in 9
digits -- to the left of the decimal point. His advice is to buy the source
code that I'm working on getting.

  True; very true. But, if I can get working code in java by wrapping or
hand porting the core functions and re-creating the UI in pure java then
I'll have a working system sooner rather than later. As time permits and my
knowledge and skill with java increase I can working on optimizing
performance.

Many thanks for the thoughts,

I don't see this behaviour.  When I do a tcpdump on the cable-modem
interface, all I see is ARP broadcasts, not the "client" replies, and
not anyone elses traffic.  Maybe it was like that at one time, but I
don't think it is anymore.

I do have a firewall. I host a web server so port 80 is open, which is why I
am able to log the traffic I get on that port. I have a friend who is rather
dumb and does not run a firewall. He runs windows xp, by itself, without
even the pathetic XP firewall enabled.. (Something about a quake server..) I
always get a kick out of changing his workgroup around and finding the
occasional share suddenly available - the two most popular workgroups are
"workgroup" and "homegroup". This is the "lan effect" I speak of.

I know those (protocols mentioned) are routable protocols - as are the many
other dozens that are targeted out specifically - but what I'm saying is I
get an extraordinary amount of portscans targeting these ports specifically,
and they come "internally" from the comcast/attbi network.

Excuse my ignorance, but I don't know what that means. Frankly it doesn't
matter. All I know is I'm sitting here watching my lights flash away - once
again, someone is doing a port scan. This time it's been going on for about
3 minutes. Trusty IPTABLES is doing it's job! Stupid comcast is not - and my
bandwidth suffers accordingly.

The vast majority of the "idle" blinkie light is ARP traffic.  Fire up
tcpdump or ethereal and see for yourself.

They all just pretty much work.

Motorola, RCA, Toshiba, SA, Siemens.  We've got 80,000 cable modems deployed 
in our systems and we haven't seen many problems with any of them.

You're right. Right this second. I also know the difference between "light
arp traffic" and a port scan on the blinking lights.

Earlier, when I wrote the previous email, I checked firestarter (my firewall
monitor) - I had a port scan coming in.  Funny, as I'm typing this another
scan for port 2987 is taking place... from yet another 12.x.x.x.attbi.com
address... and now for 5631.. This one seems to be light, two attempts every
20 seconds.

I'm not making this up.

TheI know that there is a lot I don't know, but I'm not going to speak up in
a public forum when I'm not sure about what I know. What I said earlier -
and this is all I said - is that I get an inordinate amount of inbound port
scans coming from the internal attbi.com IPs. This takes up a portion of my
bandwidth.

If any here is interested I will start posting the IP's of these annoyances
for all to "poke and prod"..

Message-ID: <001d01c32f5d$3687cf80$1901a8c0@madcat>

Speaking of firewalls..

I like firestarter - it is a simple little utility that keeps me from having to dig into firewall.sh too much. It has a very basic gui which allows you to monitor your firewall's effectiveness.. It's worked so far, but it is rather limited..

I would like a different/new firewall monitor. I've looked around but can't seem to find what I'm looking for. Has anyone used Watchguard's firewall utility? It shows current connections as well as violations. It allows you to assign nodes to groups for quick visual identification.. It is a very functional utility. I can't seem to find a utility like this for linux..

So my question to the masses: what firewall software do you use? Is there anything out there that will show both current and attempted connections and give me the information I need? My requirements are a visual interface (so my roommate with limited linux experience can navigate through it) and a "connection"-based display, i.e. open ports with open connections show on the list as well as attempts on closed ports..

Thanks!
Matt

Bart Massey is part of this project. He has been to some recent PLUG 
meetings and presented the programming language Nickel at the MOSS 
gathering on Saturday. I bet he'd be interested in presenting or be able 
to find someone in the group to do so. Bart teaches AI at PSU and he's 
teaching an Open Source class there this summer. Personally, I'd be more 
interested in a presentation on the intersection of AI and Open Source.

I have always assumed that any un-encrypted packets were sniffable,

This could be fun, in combination with the DSL/Cable modem firewall
appliances that route private IP addresses, you could not only sniff
your neighbors packets, but dish out private addresses and take over
their routing and DNS.

It worked!  I should have known that linux would do the right things to
make it work.  It turns out that they start with a broken partition,
which is why cfdisk chokes.  Using fdisk, I was able to create a new
partition table, and 4 primary partitions, one FAT12, one swap, and 2
ext3's.  Now cfdisk can read it, the FAT12 is accessible to the M$ OS's,
and I can mount /var, /home and swap.

I am one happy camper! Thanks!

Why FAT12 instead of FAT32?

This is a GeForce4 MX card. It is XFree86-compatible, XFree includes
open-source non-accelerated driver, and NVidia provides their Detonator
driver which is of the same quality as the Windows driver, and supports
all features of the card.
In general, I'm not a big fan of MX series of GeForce, all revies I've
seen show that one would be better off going to the previous line of cards
instead, i.e. in this case GeForce 3 Ti cards (a "real" GeForce) can be
bought for about as much as GeForce 4 MX (GeForce "lite") and will perform
better, although you won't be able to brag that you have a GeForce 4.

> ATI Radeon 7500 64MB DDR
This one is supported in XFree 4.2 (possibly 4.1 but there were some
issues there, and some people needed to get files from CVS to hack their
XFree installation). There are open-source drivers, I was never able to
get the full scoop on whether they are from ATI or ATI helped in their
development or they have nothing to do with ATI, and how well they support
the hardware features. My guess is that not too well, but it's based on
the fact that in most discussions I've seen the main argument used against
someone who says "This and this is not supported and the card is not used
at full potential and will perform much slower than similar GeForce" is
"but the drivers are open source". May be the drivers are good and zealots
just haven't bothered to learn about it.

Small drive?

BTW, the "weird" partition table may be what's used by whatever device
formatted this drive (or whatever device it was intended for, if it's
factory-formatted). I've seen in on flash cards and ZIP disks, I was able
to read them under Linux but they have strange partitioning. This
partitioning is required by their "native" devices (in case of ZIP drive,
under Linux you can partition it any way you like, but IOmega drivers for
Windows will only recognize their way, and in case of flash cards the
camera or other device must have the formatting it wants and no other).

An old friend of mine who has never played with Linux has a client that
wants to start looking into Linux.  Apparently they want to set up a
machine that can be dialed-into and establish a PPP connection.  Just so I
can point him in the right direction, what's needed to allow another
machine to dial into your box and establish a PPP connection with it?

He tells me that he tried to set up a RedHat box but found that it didn't
support dial-in - I suspect that this is not entirely true.

The mgetty package is, I believe, the standard for such things:

  [RPMS]$ rpm -qp --qf '%{DESCRIPTION}' mgetty-1.1.30-2.i386.rpm 
  The mgetty package contains a "smart" getty which allows logins over 
  a serial line (i.e., through a modem).  If you're using a Class 2 or 
  2.0 modem, mgetty can receive faxes.  If you also need to send 
  faxes, you'll need to install the sendfax program.

  If you'll be dialing in to your system using a modem, you should
  install the mgetty package.  If you'd like to send faxes using 
  mgetty and your modem, you'll need to install the mgetty-sendfax 
  program.  If you need a viewer for faxes, you'll also need to 
  install the mgetty-viewfax package.

That's interesting, you can see Layer 2 packets but nothing any 
higher?  Weird.

I was almost tempted to get cable anyway and see how easy it 
really is to sniff traffic, but I really don't have the income to 
support two broadband connections (one I trust marginally; one I 
don't trust that is just for 'hacking') right now.

I never see anyone elses traffic.  That's not to say that with
appropriate hardware you couldn't, but I don't think that equipment is
widely deployed.  Casual snooping by neighbors seems quite unlikely
these days.

Subject: [PLUG] Getting a red Hat system to play audio files
Message-ID: <1055278587.4575.12.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Red hat 9 has one glaring weakness. the deliberately disabled MP3
support, making their audio player virtually useless. Worse, the video
player (which is supposed to have MP3 support) that I just downloaded
not only won;t play MP3 files (it starts the files but no sound comes
out) but it won't play the audio track on my video files. Is there
something in the Red Hat system that blocks out those audio standards
from ALL pieces of software, or is there some RPM or code I can install
that would re-enable MP3 and audio?

Before anyone asks, Red Hat did test the sound card successfully.

  This type of address matching is the domain of the vector GIS vendors
(MapInfo, ESRI, etc.). There _is_ MapServer out of the U. Minnesota but I've
never looked at it. The former run only on Microsoft, the latter runs on
linux (is OSS) and can apparently be integrated with GRASS but I don't know
if you can do address matching.

  There's gis-l and mapinfo-l, but the only linux list is GRASS
(http://grass.baylor.edu/)

2 Meg.  FAT12 has smaller block sizes, so less space is wasted in
partially filled blocks.  However, it only works on small partitions (I
can't recall the maximum size).

Fortunately, Winblowz recongnized it for what it was, instead of what
the tool thought it should be.  In fact I used the native winblowz tool
to format the FAT12 partition.

Thanks for the information about the IOmega, I know that will come in
handy sometime.

I'll second this-- it's more complicated than a simple tcpdump to see your
neighbors' unicast traffic.  I'm sure that some (most?) cable modems can
be configured or hacked to pass all traffic through, but casual
observation is no longer possible.

Besides, any reasonably sensitive information should be encrypted before
it ever leaves your own network, and preferably before it leaves your own
host.  ;-)

The only thing that I've seen that came reasonably close was the Thomas
Guide mapping software for Windows.  It would allow you to store multiple
address points on a map and then print the map with notations for each
point.  It was extremely crude, but it did do the multiple address thing
well.

If you find something that lets you do this without Windows, please let me
know.

GRASS is a decent GIS package, but it has no concept of an "address".  You
will need to devote a reasonable amount of work to find the raw data
needed to plot street addresses along with street information.  You might
be able to get some raw data on Portland from:

I investigated this somewhat last night, and from what I could extract from
Comcasts 'support' website, it appears you need to login to the comcast
support site with your username/password and request NNTP access - you'll

Basically, it appears that Comcast has thrown in and outsourced their news
servers.  Oh, and btw, you only get 1GB of transfer per month - but giganews
will gladly offer you upgraded service, for a fee.  (um, consolidation to a
single national monopoly provider is good for consumers, cough cough, oh
yah, this isn't the plug-chat, raised our rates and lowered the service
offering, cough cough)

I have not jumped thru the hoops, so I can neither confirm nor deny this.
However, it seems the days of gleefully sucking binaries from AT&T's netnews
server has passed.

Don't know about news/nntp, but here are some mail hosts:

  [heinlein]$ host smtp.comcast.net
  smtp.comcast.net has address 24.153.64.2
  [heinlein]$ host imap.comcast.net
  imap.comcast.net has address 24.153.64.69
  [heinlein]$ host pop3.comcast.net
  pop3.comcast.net has address 24.153.64.3

There's also a mail.comcast.net that points to the pop3 server.

I have not looked for software like this for a year or so, but your post
got me thinking about it again, so I searched freshmeat and came across

Has anyone tried this yet? Anyway I am going to install it and see

Michael,

Red Hat removed MP3 support from xmms due to patent
issues, I believe. There is an rpm that will add mp3
support back into it. It is no longer on their web
page like it used to be, but I have posted a copy of
it to my web page. This is actually the Red Hat 8
version, but works for Red Hat 9. The URL is:


http://vanhoosen.net/temp/xmms-mpg123-1.2.7-13.i386.rpm

Hope this helps.

In what way do you know that Red Hat tested the sound card successfully?
Did you hear a sound? The default is often to mute and or turn the
volume all the way down. To counter this you need to start  up a mixer
like alsamixer and unmute, and turn up the volume. What motherboard/soundchip
are you trying to use?

What's "inordinate"?  I mean to say, how do you know you're getting more
or less than anyone with any other kind of connection?

I get a buttload of snoops and portscans and things, too... and mostly
from cable modem subscribers, but I'm on DSL.

I don't really think cable exposes you any more or less.

However, I do think that the AUP at the private cable monopoly is bad
shit.

I don't know if someone has mentioned this, but my onboard audio device (which tested successfully with Red Hat) has a bug in the driver.  I had to put the speaker cable into the audio in port.  Works great now.  When I boot into Windows, I simply switch the cable over.  It's weird, I don't understand it, but sometimes not caring makes life a lot less stressful :-)

Jason,

  Not lame, but the solution. Up until the 1.2.x releases I could leave
mozilla open when I killed X and all open applications were registered with
xfce's session manager. The next time I logged in and ran 'startx', up would
come mozilla, along with four xterms, pine, OpenOffice.org, The GIMP, etc.

  Since this release mozilla no longer automatically reloads and it loses
all new bookmarks.

  But, extensive testing has shown me that manually closing mozilla (ctrl-q)
retains the bookmarks when I invoke it again.

  Strange ... but true.

Thanks,

  The USPS has the TIGER (Topological Integrated Geographic Encoding and Reference) / ZIP+4 File.

http://www.usps.com/ncsc/products/tiger.htm

  It's $50 shipping/handling the last time I looked, but I believe Eric Raymond used to keep the database up on his FTP site.  

  The ZIP+4 looked a little flakey when I went through the data.  It looked like the XY of the ZIP+4 was often the same as the main ZIP.

  You can get the Census Bureau block data for free. That's what the USPS
uses.

  I have street files for the entire US, but they're at 1:100K resolution
and about 5+ years old. You can get current ones from the Oregon GIS Web
site in ARC/Info export or ARCview shape formats.

  Raw data files are only part of the equation.

1)  You should investigate the Open-Source mapserv toolkit at 
http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/

    I have installed this on several systems that my firm uses, and it 
works like a charm.  There's a firm in Maryland that sells Tiger 
datasets (the "raw data" files that contain the streets, zip, 
political boundaries, etc.) in ARC form for a reasonable figure, and 
he also has a Perl-based application that layers on top of mapserv 
that will do address-to-lat/lon mapping.  You can find them at:

mapsurf at midsouth.rr.com.
Silicon Mapping Solutions
http://www.siliconmapping.com/

As mentioned by others, mapserv runs on Linux, but will also run on 
almost any other UNIX-like operating system (I have it running on a 
handful of OpenBSD platforms.)


2) Google will help you with mailing lists.   :)

3) Nothing is free, especially mapping systems.  Despite the Open 
Source moniker, getting _quality_ data will cost you at least $2k for 
the whole project, excluding hardware.  If it's less, you win, but 
that's what you should bank on.  This is far less than commercial 
rights to any of the "professional" datasets out there, which are 
(for your purposes) just scrubbed Tiger datasets.

So my dream of having a mapquest-like application that was aware of
elevation changes (and, ideally, road quality) to punch in a couple of
addresses and choose how much climbing you want to do to output a route
for biking through the city is way out of the realm of feasibility right
now?

Why don't the MANY public agencies that compile and use this kind of data
make it available to the public?

One of the many problems with public agencies contracting private
tyrannies, I suppose.

More than I would expect. I've had DSL in the past (granted it was over a
year ago) but I do not remember even close to the amount of portscans I get
now that I'm on cable. Maybe it is the same amount that everyone else gets-
if so then I wonder how much bandwidth across the internet at any given
moment is taken to port scans, whether curious, professional, or malicious?
How much bandwidth does poor grandma lose if she gets a major port scan
(i.e. more than 1000 ports) for every two hours she is online? If I were to
scan a dial-up, even with my limited upstream bandwidth I could quickly
drown it.

I agree - but having that 12.x.x.x address..... I dunno. This would be an
interesting metric - which type of internet service attracts the most
hackers? Which attracts the least? Why type of scans does connection X get
vs. connection Y? What type of service do most of the script kiddies out in
userville have?

There's a great line from "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" that I am going
to adapt and steal: "You can turn your back on a person but you can never
turn your back on a monopoly."

Ahem.... ;-)

Obviously, cable is going to be the #1 perpetrator here, but for social,
not technological reasons.

DSL is pretty much for geeks and businesses (whose internet connections
are chosen by geeks).  DSL is urban (gotta be close to the CO), the IPs
are generally static, and the service agreements usually allow some kind
of services.  Geeks have more interesting projects than portscanning
strangers.  Boredom is not generally an issue with geeks (loneliness,
maybe; boredom, no).

Cable is for suburbanites.  It's for people that bought into the american
dream of highway culture or are caught up in servicing the sprawl itself
and don't know any better.  The suburbs are just about the worst
environment for a teenager.  There's lots of space between things,
generally no sidewalks, terribly road design (long slow curves, super-wide
streets -- both contribute to high-speed, reckless driving -- all for
motorist safety, no on-street parking or regularly planted trees to
protect pedestrians from traffic, again for motorist safety at the expense
of a pleasant environment).  Between the ages of about 8 and 16, you're a
prisoner in the "development" in which you live.  There are no social
spots, no public space, and no non-residential buildings.  There's nothing
to do but watch TV and dick around on the internet.  And since your entire
environment is anti-social, you really don't perceive the human harm in
your abusive, selfish behavior.

Script-kiddies are suburban, bored, and anti-social.  The suburbs are
pretty much designed to turn out these kinds of people.  It's not a
surprise that so many american kids are obese.  It IS a surprise that more
aren't certifiably psychotic (or maybe that's what all the medication is
for).

> Why type of scans does connection X get vs. connection Y?

I think all connections get the same kinds of scans.

I suppose it might make sense that kids try to scan other people in their
close proximity (IP, speaking) in an attempt to gain access to or
information about their neighbors (which is a gross misunderstanding of
the scale of the cable business model, but I digress...).  An adult would
probably know better than to scan folks on his own network because the
complaints are more likely to result in a suspension of service.  An adult
is paying the bill... a suburban kid is just fucking with Mom and Dad's
connection and they'll just go to anothe provider (in the kid's mind).

I'm not sure it's ever a good idea to turn your back on anything.

[Note that it means something entirely different to turn your back on a
person than it does to turn your back on a non-person.  If you "turn your
back on" an alligator or a corporation or the gub'mint, you're becoming
vulnerable and openning yourself to attack.  If you "turn your back on" a
person, you're ignoring their problems and failing to lend a hand where
you otherwise could have.  It's an interesting phrase.]

Another bit of information...  running in a Gnome/Metacity environment, 
I normally exit either by cntrl-alt-backspace, or just by simply logging 
out.  Neither loses any bookmarks, on any release of Mozilla.  The only 
time I've ever lost bookmark info was on a Windows system running a pre 
1.0 release of Mozilla.

I'm currently running Mozilla 1.4 rc1.

  They do. Some charge, others don't. Oregon provides a ton of data for
free. Washington sells it through DNR (Dept. of Natural Resources). Nevada
and Idaho sell their data, too.

  At the County level you'll pay for the data. Every county now has its own
GIS, complete with staff.

  We pay for water, sewage, roads and education all provided by "guv'mint"
so why not spatial data?

Hi.

I'm about to reorganize my home network here and I'm hoping to get some
advice and pointers from the crowd.

The portion of my network that needs reorganizing is this /29 and the
associated private network of PCs and stuff behind the firewall in that
subnet.

The private network (10.42.42.0/24) contains my fileserver, one
address-translatin' firewall interface and default gateway (10.42.42.1),
one private interface on my public web/shell server for access to the
private net through ssh and for NFS mounting homedirs from the fileserver,
and a handful of desktop systems.

Ideally, I want the firewall to be serving DHCP to the bulk of the desktop
machines (OK, all but mine) and all statically addressed interfaces to
have bandwidth preference for the gateway, but all interfaces (including
those addressed via DHCP) would be allowed a minimum of, say, 10kB/s.

So, should I just slap another interface into the firewall, break out the
network into two /25s?  My only concern there is that I only have one
100Mb switch (the /29 publicly addressable network is all 10MB because
it's only a 1Mb pipe coming in anyway), so the DHCP systems would be
limited to 10Mb connections and I'd have more equipment and then routing
rules for the two /25s.  Would NAT work normally in that circumstance?  I
mean, is there any reason why the firewall couldn't NAT two internal
interfaces to one external IP?  I can't imagine why not, but that doesn't
mean there isn't a reason.

Any comments appreciated (though some just for the mockery I get to make
of you).

I stopped by Powell's technical tonight after school, and none of the
signs say anything about the book giveaway that was stated in the
forwarded message from Marsee Henon of O'Reilly that David Mandel posted
earlier.  (May 29).  I was just wondering if there was any more
information available as it makes the trip tomorrow a lot more
worthwhile.  I called the store and the person that answered said they
knew nothing about it and that I would have to just show up tomorrow and
see for myself.  I was not very satisfied with this answer.

Well, education and roads as general "public goods" are paid for out of
the general fund.

Sewage and water are paid for in a way that attempts to appropriately
disperse the cost across the users of the system by the amount of strain
they place on the system itself.

It would be great of roads were funded the same way.  Right now, roads are
funded mostly out of the state general fund and very little of the money
comes from the users who put the most strain on the system.  I use the
roads and I pay, annually, about 80% as much as, say, you do, but I put
almost no strain on the system (nor do I contribute to the other public
debts the roads and automobile use currently incur such as air and noise
pollution, public health and safety, or sprawl).  But, unfortunately, such
a system would be considered an "undue burden" on the car drivers, so
everyone else has to subsidize their destructive habits.

Anyway, spatial data is INFORMATION.  There is almost no strain on the
system to provide that information to the public for free.  The public
agencies collect, develop, and aggregate the information for their own
purposes, but once that is done, the cost of making it available to the
public for free download is minimal and the cost per user, once such a
system is in place, is almost nil.

It makes sense to fund a system by fees paid by those who most benefit
(though, in the case of education, it's just about impossible to say
whether the educated person benefits any more or less than society as a
whole for having one more well-educated member), but the cost of providing
the service of shared information is so low, it's absurd to try to collect
it.

And remember, a public agency has (rather, should have) absolutely no
interest in charging any user of a system anything more than the
additional cost added by that user to the system as a whole.

googled for the error message and fine only discussions pertaining to the
source code- not troubleshooting the error.
Thanks!

Everything I'm writing here is second hand. I have never had a cable
modem, and I don't plan on getting one.

>From what I have been told, what you say above used to be true. You
could sniff the traffic hitting your cable modem, and get all sorts of

Supposedly, that changed sometime in the last couple of years. Traffic
between the cable modem and the head end (equivalent to a DSLAM, only on
cable) is supposedly encrypted. Another cable modem isn't supposed to be
able to unencrypt traffic not bound for itself. 

I have no idea if this is true, or if it is, what level of encryption is
used, or what type.

Holding my comments on your later, more politicized reply, I will 
address your technical questions below.

As mentioned, ARC-formatted shapefile info is readily available from 
multiple states, for multiple services.  If you know where to look, 
and who to ask.  A consolidated form of this data is currently not 
available, and pointing to the Federal Government as a repository for 
this data is difficult, at best, as the volume of points and shapes 
is staggering.  It's a miracle enough that the Tiger dataset exists - 
most other nations have nothing even remotely resembling it.  Try 
getting maps for Mexico - that's good for a laugh or two on a boring 
day, and the concept of "free information" will get you laughed off 
the phone in almost every other nation.  Some enlightened nations 
have it, but most do not.

Topo data is even harder to represent.  There is a firm that has the 
entire USA in topo map form down to 1:25,000 format, and the'll be 
happy to sell it to you on a tidy little server running (surprise!) 
Mapserv.  It'll only set you back $35,000. 
(http://www.topozone.com/)  Or, you can do as I do, and simply pay 
them per map impression (another cool feature of mapserve is it's 
ability to render remote maps.)

The military has a huge advantage in this area, but they aren't 
releasing things as Linux-compatible "auto-conf" packages or RPMs, if 
they release their software at all.  And now, in this environment of 
"heightened security", we will undoubtedly see more map data that was 
once public being withdrawn for fear that it may be used by enemies 
of the US.  (Anyone recall the stories about maps of Moscow in the 
60's?)

But back to my point: the data exists, and is often even free, but is 
extremely fragmented.  If you are persistent, you will find that for 
which you seek, but it is not going to be found as a rainy-day 
project.  It will be found as the result of long hours of searching, 
phone calls, and confusing dead-end data.

  The new federal standard -- the name escapes me at the moment -- replaced
the DLG with an extremely complex binary format that was supposed to
encapsulate and handle _all_ spatial data regardless of what it was. Well,
it's so bloody complex even federal folks have trouble with it and since the
documentation is so piss-poor the difficulties in reverse-engineering it so
that data can be imported to a GIS are extreme.

                                        24,000 actually. Except for Alaska.

  You can find DEM data for most places at 1:24K, interpolate it and overlay
it with vector data such as roads, hydrography and PLSS boundaries. That's
what I do. Or, you can get free DRGs (Digital Raster Graphics, a.k.a.
scanned 1:24K topographic maps without the marginal annotations).

  Have you looked at USGS GIS programs and data? Do you work only with
cadastral data that's unprojected or do you need projected data of all
sorts? There's the free PROJ4 software that does datum transformations as
well as reprojecting data and translating coordinate systems.

I downloaded a replacement xmms. Installing it is another matter
entirely -- I have yet to master RPMs. I'm certainly having a great deal
of difficulty installing any software that does NOT come in RPM form.
The replacement xmms I downloaded is for Red Hat 8. I don;t know if Red
Hat has some code that defeats my attempts to install it over the xmms
that came with the distro or not (I bought the CD package you can get
for $41 at Office Depot and $40 at Fry's.)

As far as getting audio itself to work, however, I managed to solve that
problem. One of the list members sent me a not encouraging me to
brainstorm the situation through a little more. It turned out I had a
bad connection between my sound card and my speakers. Once I
straightened that out (by physically moving the speaker plug) audio
plays. I even got the Video/DVD player I installed to play MP3 files.

This leads to a new problem, though -- whenever I click on an MP3 file
in XWindow, it takes me to xmms in its current, crippled state, It's
sort of like a Windows file association problem -- the files are linked
to a program you don;t want them to be linked to. I don;t know if even
installing the repaired xmms would solve that particular problem because
I don;t know if Red hat will simply install it beside the current
version or replace the disabled version with the fixed one. I don't know
why red Hat crippled one of the major reasons people own computers these
days (to play media files), but I'm sure they have their reasons (not
sound ones, mind you, but reasons).

Have you looked at the lartc stuff?

  <http://lartc.org/>

That's where I ended up when I was trying to understand some weird
behavior associated with my two upstream connections and
DNAT.  Though, in the interests of full disclosure, the solution they
offered was messier than one I came up with on my own.  Still, lots of
helpful information (at least for me).

as root
rpm -hUv xmms-1.2.7-21.i386.rpm
or whatever your rpm filename is. This updates any existing rpm
and if one doesn't exist it installs it.

Why not Red Hat 9 -- isn't that what you are running?

I have not seen any evidence of code that intentionally prevents you from
installing over the top of original distro packages, nor would such a feature
be tolerated.

If you are interested in a suggestion, the term "XWindow" does not apply here.
Instead, your window manager (e.g. KDE, GNOME) is the active element that
manages the MIME types for you, and controls which program is launched for a
given file type.

> I don;t know if Red hat will simply install it beside the current
> version or replace the disabled version with the fixed one.

I ran a quick test on my RH9 box and downloaded the file 

    http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/redhat/9/xmms-mp3/xmms-mp3-1.2.7-21.p.fr1.i386.rpm

to look at its file contents:

    % rpm -qpl xmms-mp3-1.2.7-21.p.fr1.i386.rpm
    warning: xmms-mp3-1.2.7-21.p.fr1.i386.rpm: V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID e42d547b
    /usr/lib/xmms/Input/libmpg123.so

This indicates the RPM only contains one shared library ("libmpg123.so"), thus
the original "xmms" executable is not getting replaced.  From this it seems
reasonable that your window manager _should_ continue invoking the same
"crippled" program.  What should have changed is that XMMS should now recognize
that it has MP3 input support.  

Can you check the XMMS gui to see if the Options>Preferences/Audio I/O Plugins
menu shows that "MPEG Layer 1/2/3 Player 1.2.7 [libmpg123.so]" is enabled?

Why would you presume Red Hat made an irrational decision here?  A perception
of legal liability can alter anyone's priorities.

  I'm using OpenOffice.org a lot now and I've discovered a couple of
interesting quirks. I'm curious if others have seen these, too.

  First, the color matching using the ESP PrintPro driver is not very good.
The printed colors are lighter than those on screen. But, that's an ESP
issue I presume.

  Second, the one that causes me to write is with the display of text. I get
a lot of winWord docs and they invariably use Times New Roman/12 pt as the
bodytext font. Apostrophes and quotes display as question marks here, even
after I save them in the native OO.o format. That could be because I don't
have that particular foundry's type face installed.

  Anyway, I noticed that when I changed the typeface from Times New Roman to
my standard Bitstream Amerigo the question marks were replaced by
apostrophes or quotation marks. This makes sense if the one font is not
installed. What I discovered this morning is that the change also occurred
when I changed from 12pt to 10pt. _That's_ unexpected.

Your AutoCorrect setting is turning the ' and " (single- and
double-prime symbols) into curly apostrophes as you type. Some fonts
have a glyph defined for this ASCII value; others don't. When it's
undefined, you see the question mark symbol. If you turn-off this
autocorrect feature, you'll have typography that is not quite so pretty
at its best, but it will always be legible.

I meant that MS-WORD was making the autocorrect as the source document
was typed. I wasn't clear about that in my previous message.

I'm going to vote for technical reasons. Cable networks are a source of
often poorly-protected hosts to be compromised and incorporated into
DDOS'ers herds of zombies. DSL networks are almost as good a source, but
the IP ranges for cable networks are very large, contiguous, and well
known, while DSL IP ranges are all over the place.

I don't know what ESP is so I might be talking out of my ass, 
but...

Have you adjusted your monitor's gamma?  If not, then images will 
look darker on your monitor than they really are.

It is possible that the colors are printing correctly, but are 
being displayed too dark.

You can find more than you ever wanted to know about gamma 
(unless, like me, you're a serious photographer) here:

http://www.normankoren.com/makingfineprints1A.html

Note that the Macintosh gamma of 1.8 is the "standard" for 
pre-press work; the PC gamma of 2.2 is the "standard" for Web 
pages.

  This I understand.

  I can more readily believe that different typefaces would either have or
lack that glyph than that two different sizes of the same typeface differ.

[Daniel Petcher] 
Here's where my understanding of the font rendering architecture of
Linux breaks-off completely and we enter the realm of educated
speculation. Feel free to call "B*llsh*t" on me at any time. My feelings
will not be hurt.

On Macintosh System 8 and earlier and Windows 95 (I dunno about current
technology), bitmaps of a given font, rendered at popular sizes are
stored on the disk. Without vector-based font rendering like TrueType or
Adobe Type Manager, these several different bitmaps are stretched and
distorted to approximate the appearance of a printed page.

If the right size of type is already rendered as a bitmap in your
system, there will be no fresh rendering of the typeface from its
vector-oriented description. Factors that can conspire against you here:
-The bitmap and vector type fonts may come from different sources
-The typefaces may have been machine-converted from another platform
which used different ASCII values or meta-character names for the glyphs
in question
-There may be some typeface substitution happening at the print
rendering engine, the printer, or the screen rendering engine.
-Some lazy font author may have missed bitmapping a glyph or two of
bitmap work.

Andrew

Don't know what the deal is, but having gotten an email to pay for the
stuff today it blows my mind that I can't call him on the phone.
His number is ( 503 ) 397 - 4767.  Can you call him?  I think he's
hostile toward my intended use for this machine because when I
asked him to look for a 100% Linux compatible Pentium 4 he didn't
do it.  The Linux user's group in Portland pointed one out and he
can get it yet he's trying to talk me out of it saying that the
memory technology is experimental.  The Linux user's group 
suggested I go to EMU.

I've been trying to call him since Monday and am starting to wonder
if he has blocked my calls.  If he doesn't think he's going to get
business from me that is ridiculous considering I've gotten the
last two computers from him.  Even then I remember him pushing
Windows.

Since I want 98 installed I can ask him how much he would charge
to install it and xosl for me, I shouldn't have to have him do that
though.  I looked at one of his price quotes for the board I want
and it appears that he quoted me this board before for five dollars
less, I accidentally asked for it twice.

I asked him why he advertises Windows 2000 server, seems he 
went on the defensive.  I asked what applications his customers 
need Windows for, he didn't respond except to say that he
has successfully set up a motorcycle business on 2000.  He
simply said that his customers need Windows.  Why are 
businessses so willing to pay for Microsoft certifications and
maintain a status quo of everybody will use Microsoft
applications for all their computing needs?  Doesn't Habas
know that he can support Linux and Windows customers equally
and that it is illegal for Microsoft or anyone else to stop 
him?  For that matter, he could add Apple computers to
his inventory.

I am quoting my entire message because it did not say that the event was
not happening.  The event is posted in the store and on the website.  I
am wanting to discuss the absence of the free oreilly book with purchase
of an oreilly hacks book that was originally described in the email. 
This information is absent from the site, the store, and evidently the
knowledge of the employees.

Maybe O'Reilly is giving the books away, not Powell's, and they're with
Rob and Rael?  Can you really complain too much about not getting
something for free?

My suggestion: go to a different retailer. It sounds like this man is
borderline insane. Experimental memory technology? Changing quotes? HIS
CUSTOMERS NEED WINDOWS????

Not only would I go to a different retailer but I might consider letting the
BBB know that he is using false information to scare/bully customers into
sales (unfortunately not talking about windows, but the "experimental memory
tech").

sick, tired, stir-crazy, and punchy... is that why you couldn't find this step

Trouble-shooting question #1 (similar to " 1: Is the device plugged in?") Did

(Things are getting built up, sadly. Time to look at moving out to Mist or

I live between St. Helens & Scappoose, and the following is JUST my opinion, 
but his store and Preheim in Scappoose are pretty much the only thing going 
in town for any kind of computer parts - even simple stuff like, say, a 15' 
Cat-V cable.

Rob H. is a nice guy to talk with. I really -tried- to give him my business, 
but in my particular experience with him, his kid kept getting in the way of 
his business hours - I'd call and ask if he'd be in at say, 1:30pm one day, 
and I'd get there and find the 'Stepped out for 15 min' sign in the window. 
Still there 35 min later. This sort of thing happened about 3 times in one 
week. I also asked him to quote a system, than asked by what day he'd think 
he'd have the quote ready. Just to be extra nice, I came in 4 - 6 hours after 
the agreed-upon time, and he hadn't even touched it - so I lost a week with 
-my- boss & customers. Needless to say, since I couldn't get a quote for him 
for the system I wanted, I never got around to buying from him.

Preheim is a nice guy too, but if it's Linux, it might as well be from  
Neptune. I buy most of my incidental hardware from him (cables, fens etc.) 
when & if a trip to Norvac or Fry's is too much fuel.

After reading your message I believe I may have sounded whiny before

I just talked to the manager and they are in fact giving the books away
they just hadn't advertised it in hopes of not running out it seems.  So
if you buy one O'Reilly book of equal or greater value you get one of
the Hacks books for free.  Maybe I will see some of you there.

You know you can also get new ORA books at a 20% discount with a user
group code?  I don't know if PLUG has one, but PASA does and you can use
it.  Check the list archives at http://pasa.portland.or.us for the
forwards I send from O'Reilly.  I think you can also get Cisco Press
books at a discount through PACUG; check the archive:
http://mail.patch.com/mailman/private/pacug/.

Here's another Columbia County thought. Mr. Habas is runs his own business and 
makes his best decisions. He gets to choose which customers he serves. 
Columbia Country probably has enough MS-user Gomers that he can look pretty 
intelligent to them by 'fixing the printer.' ("Bubba, he was great!" He just 
came over and clicked something, and it worked. $29. Wow!")

Perhaps the intensity of effort in dealing with a customer who asks for a 
Linux-compatible 'whatever' is greater by a factor of 'x' over his typical 
sort of customer, and he could service 'y' Gomer-customers instead of dealing 
with you. If y>x, then it's to his profit to blow you off, and fix 'y' 
customers with their stoopid-Windoze annoyances. And more county-dwelling 
cave-folk will think he's a hero.

Exactly what's it like.  All can I add is that I've had less trouble
with Mr. Preheim himself than the people who work with him, especially
Brady.  I bought enough one day that Preheim actually walked me out to
my car to make sure I didn't damage hard drives, etc.  Maybe Mr. Preheim
knew my brother was a 95 tech or maybe he appreciated the amount of
business my family had done at his establishment.  Lately though, noone
in my family will go there at all because I've been burned.  I had a
fiasco with a bad Fujitsu hard drive around the time that Fujitsu USA
went out of business.  I was never offered a direct refund for it.  Even
though I got a replacement that works, I for reasons I still haven't
figured out, can not partition it correctly with Linux fdisk.  I gave up
and decided to use the whole drive at once, all 40 gigs of it.  Needless
to say, I ended up having to get another hard drive that would partition
where this Fujitsu drive got relegated to being a dump disk for
backups.  This was back when I was taking cis279n over at Sylvania.

Well I never did get a hold of Habas on the phone but I have managed to
pay for half the order and he should tell me tomorrow that I need to pay
the same amount for the rest.  Historically, we've been on a pay half,
finish buying the parts at pickup time.  He wants the full cost upfront
because he's shopping tomorrow.  Maybe I should just take the DVD and
disk drive he's going to need along with a copy of xosl and tell him I
want to stick with pay half upfront, the rest when the job is done. 
He's says I'll get it next week instead of Friday or Saturday.  

Surprisingly,
he was nicer in person than he has been in email.  He understood
why I avoided the built in video card which is good.  He still says
the board hasn't been certified by Intel for 512 mbit technology up
to it's supposed 2 gig capacity.  I doubt there is going to be
a problem.  If there is, I suppose since these products come with
warranties that I can use those warranties and say to Intel that
their product isn't meeting spec.  Aren't these warranties something
like three years?

Actually I spent some time last week looking for bandwidth shaping options
using Linux and never found this specific URL.  Several from ibiblio.org
and several from the LDP but not this one.  I _was_ being lazy and just
used google to search and got semi-good results.  I found out a little 
about shaper and the possibility of using iptables for some of it.
   This looks much better.

Thanks.

Bullies and abusive people are always nicer in person than email - it's much
easier to bully and talk s*** to someone when you don't see them. Put them
in front of your face and all that pent up anger and rage (and probably
self-deprecation) bleed away - the bully is really a coward at heart.

Sorry, I'm done. :-)

  Version 1.2.1 (and earlier) was installed in /usr/lib/mozilla-<verson>
with the invoking script in /usr/bin/mozilla. So, the command line
associated with the xfce panel's icon was '/usr/bin/mozilla' and this worked
just fine.

  Version 1.3.1 is installed in /usr/local/mozilla and the script to turn
over the engine and get it running is run-mozilla.sh. I made
/usr/local/mozilla owned by rshepard.users and so are all files below that
directory.

  From the command line, typing '/usr/local/mozilla/run-mozilla.sh' results
in:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ /usr/local/mozilla/run-mozilla.sh 

run-mozilla.sh: Cannot execute .

  But, typing 'cd /usr/local/mozilla/; ./run-mozilla.sh' works as expected.
Unless that same command is presented by the panel button. Then nothing
happens. I'm confused why the string works from the command line but not
from the icon's command line.

Any ideas?

Mozilla looks in its current working directory for chrome, loadable
libraries, etc.  I think you might also be able to set 'MOZILLA_HOME' to
its home and get it to work.

Subject: [PLUG] Open Source Bill Update
Message-ID: <3EE7B9D0.6060408@hevanet.com>

I guess I overstated the case earlier. SB 589 isn't yet the Open Source 
Bill because it hasn't been amended and passed out of the Senate 
committee. The word is that the votes probably aren't there to pull it 
out of committee. On Monday night I questioned the panel of 16 
legislators at Grant HS about the bill and none of them were aware of 
the move to get SB 589 amended with the HB 2892 contents.

SB 589 is currently in the Transportation and Economic Development 
Committee. The Chair, Rick Metzger is supportive of this bill, but we 
need the support of Sen. Ryan Deckert and either Bruce Starr or David 
Nelson to move it out of Committee.

Also, to quote a Democratic Representative: "Karen Minnis is God" (ie if 
she wants to kill it she will).

Nevertheless, the legislators were supportive and said our efforts on HB 
2892 were noticed and it raised the visibility. They encouraged us to 
e-mail the Senate. Frankly, I was surprised and disappointed that the 
Senate was oblivious to our attempts there.

If you haven't e-mailed some Senators, now would be the best time to do 
so. They're all listed here:

Wil,

  Well, this has completely boggled my little mind. I modified
~/.bash_profile to set "MOZILLA_HOME" to /usr/loca/mozilla. Made no
difference.

  Then I wrote a shell script called run-mozilla:

cd /usr/local/mozilla
./run-mozilla.sh
cd

  and made it executable (775, in fact). I can run the script from the
command prompt but not from the icon. I have another shell script (for an
old accounting program) that has the same syntax. I can fire that up from an
icon using the command line '~/proven'. The equivalent syntax
('~/run-mozilla) does nothing.

  Very puzzling. What can be causing this?

Thanks,

Rich

Turns out that the most recent access file at:
http://www.securitysage.com/files/access
Expects to be supporting Postfix 2.0 and higher.  Am running the most
recent package from RH9 and it's still 1.11 :(
A friendly fellow from securitysage advised that the old versions of
Postfix do not take kindly to the REJECT keyword in the access file.  They
are looking for something along the lines of 553 or 554, being some reject
code.  A simple :s/REJECT/554/ in fixed that problem.

I can't disagree or agree that cable network segments are full of
unprotected hosts or contain large, unruly IP segments. 

If they truly are full of unprotected hosts than it's not a technical
problem since the same tools used to protect a host exist in both types
of WAN topologies. The fact that the users of these hosts do not, or
will not, protect their hosts is a matter of human choice and not a
matter of lacking technology. 

As for the segment sizes, that is also not a technical issue. Someone
decided to create larger segments instead of creating smaller broadcast
domains in the normal manner - with routers. Hence the reason that you
see lots of layer 3/4 broadcast traffic such as the ARP traffic that was
offered up earlier in this thread. Larger segments also become much more
difficult to effectively monitor ( in some cases ) than smaller ones but
it's still a management/business choice to not create smaller, easily
managed segments.

No matter how I look at this I still don't see any technical issues to
support one technology over the other. The security issue is all a
matter of either personal choice of the user or a choice of the
provider. All in all, in my opinion, the choice between cable and DSL is
about equal, you will still be connected to a hostile network and will
need to take the appropriate precautions no matter which way you turn.

There _are_ substantial technical reasons to choose one technology
over another one, but they aren't particularly security reasons, they
are ISP (and thus policy) choice reasons.  With DSL you have a lot
more (many) choices than for cable (essentially one).  With DSL you
can shop around for an ISP that meets your service and policy needs.
With cable, you'd better hope that one-size-fits-you [1].

[1] actually two sizes these days, but still a lot less choice than DSL.

I don't have as much technical knowledge as the rest on this board, but I do
have experience in this area.  

I have had a cable modem since @Home made it into my neighbor some time ago.
Initially the service was so unreliable, I went with Verizon DSL.  Very
dependable, but SLOW... It crawled compared to cable.  

My DSL was interrupted due to a digital phone upgrade (the installer swore
they were compatible).  When it was going to take a week to get re-connected
from Verizon, I called ATTBI and they installed the next day.  That was over
a year ago and I can't remember my last service outage.

So, what I have learned of cable vs. DSL - 

CABLE                                      DSL
Yes, many more port                      SLOW!
Scans.

No static IP.                            Expensive.

Don't need those flippin'
Noise suppressors on each 
Phone outlet (OK, I'm out of legitimate
Points).

Bottom line?  Broadband = good thing.  Security shouldn't be an issue as if
you have ANY broadband connection, you should be protecting yourself.  A
static IP might be an issue if you're wanting to run servers.  I still feel
cable has the edge on speed, unless you shell out big $$$ for the upper-end
DSL connections.

Lastly... BILL GATES ROCKS! Microsoft is the King!  ALL HAIL... OK, just
wanted to start the flame war.

Right, the fact that one company controls all of the cable, limiting
choice, is one factor that I missed. Good point Russell.

Subject: [PLUG] Debian Network Problem
Message-ID: <20030612084159.412ce2ed.jason@vancleve.com>

I'm having one of my goofy catch-22 issues again, trying to install
woody.  Something about this hardware is preventing my network interface
from being detected during the installation, even after the tulip driver
is supposedly loaded.  Once the initial install is done and I reboot,
the NIC is found, but yet I cannot get dhcp to work. 
/etc/network/interfaces is configured with the dhcp option, and when I
run ifup -a, it waits a moment and then exits without error.  At this
point the interface is up, but there's no IP.

Now, I can set the IP manually and ping other LAN hosts, so this must be
a dhcp issue.  I googled awhile and found some notes about enabling
"socket filtering" in the kernel, but the kernel source is not present
on this system, so I can't easily test that theory.  Nor is etherconf
available on this install CD, so I can't try "dpkg-reconfigure
etherconf" either.

What's to be done?  All I can think of is to unplug another machine from
the hub, borrow all its IP information and try using that on the woody
box to connect to the Internet, then download a new kernel and make sure
to enable this "socket filtering" option in hopes that maybe then dhcp
will work. For all that, I'd just as soon resort to my old SUSE disks!

  That's exactly what I did and was stumped when it didn't work.

  However, I just found the problem and fixed it. For the benefit of future
generations I'll pass on what I've learned.

  When I upgraded mozilla from 1.2.1 to 1.3.1 the default installation
directory changed from /usr/lib/mozilla-<version> with a startup script as
/usr/bin/mozilla to /usr/local/mozilla with a start up script of
/usr/local/mozilla/run-mozilla.sh.

  On the panel's icon, I changed the command line from /usr/bin/mozilla to
/usr/local/mozilla/run-mozilla.sh, but that didn't work. Eventually I wrote
a three-line shell script and this worked from the command line but not from
the panel icon.

  This time, rather than retyping the comand line on the icon's dialog box,
I used the "browse" button and discovered that the path was set to
/usr/local/mozilla although the command line read, "/home/rshepard/mozilla".
I clicked my way up and down the filesystem tree and let the dialog box put
the string in the command line of the icon.

  This fixed the problem. Shrug. I've not had to do this before, but what
the heck: as long as it works I can go back to my real life now.

Thanks to everyone who offered suggestions,

Rich

I can't seem to come up with a scenario where I would
care about this. Nothing I do here makes me vulnerable
to viruses. My email program doesn't automatically run
binary attachments, javascript, etc. I don't run FTP.
I strictly control access via my firewall. I generally
install new software from source. My desktop computer
doesn't run any daemons that are better run on a server.
My server daemons run as non-root and in a jail or
on a separate computer or in a UML when that's not
possible.

Is there a vulnerability I don't see?

It's a good tool that some admins like to use, for example those who must care 
for winderz clients. In any scenario, having that choice taken away is in 
itself a very bad thing.

this was mostly used in the *nix and *bsd worlds as an add on to mail servers 
to scan for viruses thus catching them before the end user got them. it seems 
that there are quite a few mail servers out there that use this, and now 
people are looking for something new, as support for this will likely cease 
to exist on any non-windows platform. the thought is that microsoft will be 
integrating this into their own mail server product.

If you're networked, you are theoretically vulnerable to someone
invading your system from outside. (Though I'm sure you've got a
firewall of some sort, there may be a newly discovered vulnerability.)

If any computer behind your firewall is in a physically insecure area,
someone could theoretically gain control of it and insert malicious
code.

If there's a technically unsophisticated user (especially one whose
privileges are set too high) behind your firewall who can be tricked
into executing malicious code, someone could theoretically gain control
of your computer.

Nobody's perfectly safe, but a few common precautions can protect you
from the majority of threats.

Can anyone tell me of a virus that will actually do anything to Linux? Sure,
you can pass the "Outlook virus du jour" to your clients if you're running a
server, but what virus can actually do damage on a Linux client without
becoming root first? I've never understood that one.

  Just for giggles: suppose you're running a linux-hosted MTA and MDA for,
say, 500 end users all with Microsoft on their desktop machines. Some of
these users are neither computer sophisticated nor interested; it's a
necessity with which they cope because that's company policy. They pay no

chris,

  Or just killing it as they've done with superior technology over the past
two decades.

  I'm no expert at all, but this looks like the reason for a collective,
open source replacement coding effort.

In theory, a poorly-written end-user app is just as vulnerable on Linux
as on Windows.  It might not root your system, but the bulk of the nasty
Windows viruses these days are user-level viruses: They come through
e-mail, execute as Word Macro viruses, read your files, sometimes send
them to other people, look for files on network shares and infect them. 
Nothing that requires any sort of superuser privileges.  In reality,
there are a couple proof-of-concept viruses for Linux and our end-user
applications tend to be a little less stupidly written.

However, few people actually buy anti-virus software for Linux to
protect it; most buy it for servers for Windows clients, like my Mail
Defender setup.

Both of those places get my vote, too. I use ENU for home stuff, because
it's only a few miles away and I use Pacific Solutions for work stuff for
the same reason. Both places have good people and good product.

I'd be particularly interested in a convincing resolution to the 
persistent, conflicting rumors of "EXT3 is ready for production/no it 
isn't", and "ReiserFS sux0rs/no it doesn't". The fast recovery times and 
theoretical lack of disk corruption are attractive, but need to be 
balanced against the threat of code instability in these new FS's.

Everyone has an anecdote, while claims of "production ready" really 
require masses of experience that are *free* of anecdotes.

Dave,

While it is true that the nature of open source prevents many poor designs
such as giving the user the ability to run executables from an email
message, there is nothing normally done in this case to prevent a user
from saving a copy of an attached executable or batch file, changing it's
permissions, and running the application manually.

For example, suppose I sent an email with a harmfull attachment to you
with the subject line: "This is a pretty funny joke, you'll like this."
<-- DISCLAIMER: I would never knowingly do that :)

The good news is that you cannot simply "double-click" the attachment with
a Linux Email client and have it run, nor can simply viewing the
attachment with the "preview pane" launch a malicious attack.

The bad news is that there is nothing normally to prevent a user from
saving the attachement, changing the attachment's permissions, and running
it.

Even this is so far is not so bad because the user has now had to have
gone through a lot of work to actually launch the malicious code. If the
administrator has a proper backup plan in place, providing the user with a
completely restored environment is truly trivial.

Moreover, because the user is "canned" in their own little world on a
properly configured system they cannot in any way delete or modify files
that do not belong to them.

This prevents a command like "find / -exec 'rm -rf' {} \;" in a malicious
script from damaging the rest of the system; the script runs as the user
running it. This means the script will simply not have sufficient
permissions to damage the system at large.

All this makes Linux really a thistle patch for exploits. Before we roll
out the ticker tape though let's pause to remember that gardner snakes are
known to travel through thistle patches. Here's an example of how an
exploit can damage the system:

  1. Malicious code is placed in /tmp through a trojan horse or similiar
exploit

  2. Malicous code compiles itself in /tmp and launches the executable

  3. The executable uses a know privilege escalation exploit (such as one
found in older BIND 9 severs) to escalate itself to root privileges

  4. The executable dumps it's payload wich can include the
deletion/modification of files, etc.

The only way to be as secure as possible is to scan the CERT advisories
periodically (I do it daily) and ensure that your system is up to date.

Keep this in perspective, though, the code in your Linux system, combined
with it's Unix like architecture, has undergone a great amount of scrutiny
before it ever landed on your hard drive. Further, the speed at wich
exploits are patched with Open Source is second to none; usually within
hours.

One must still, however, be diligent to be secure and even then there are
no gaurantees.

See my presentation on Linux security to find out more about "hardening"
your Linux system:

I was perhaps not clear in my post on this - I wasn't talking about
broadcast domains, but rather the larger ip allocations. From the point
of view of a script kiddie, residential broadband hosts are going to be
the best combination of decent bandwidth and a higher percentage of
poorly or completely unprotected machines. That is likely to be true of
both DSL and cable.

Cable may have a somewhat higher rate of port scans than DSL because
there are only a small number of cable providers, and they have very
large ip allocations for cable subscribers, such as 12.0.0.0/8 (and I'm
just using that as an example - I don't know that the full /8 is used
for subscribers).

So a script kiddie can port scan all of 12.0.0.0/8 and hit almost
entirely cable subscribers. To look for DSL subscribers, one would need
to scan a few /24s here, a few there, maybe a /18 or two, but regardless
there aren't the big contiguous blocks of subscribers like there are
with cable.

My comment that I was voting for technical reasons was in contrast to
Jeme's socio-economic explanation, and was I not referring to
differences in the underlying transport technologies of DSL and cable.

Check the syslog, it will tell you if the dhcp-client was successful, or
if there was an error.  If nothing is there, then your DHCP-client is

Don't bother trying to download the kernel source to fix this, the stock
kernel is capable of receiving dhcp information.

You don't need to borrow another computers IP address, just assign one
that is not being used by any other machines.

I'd always turn Microsoft down because I want to earn the money instead.
I also have a problem with putting hard work in the hands of a company
that will charge a ton for it while not maintaining it.  I hope nobody

Since when do viruses need root to spread?  And wouldn't a user be rather
annoyed if that non-root virus wiped out all the files in their home
directory?  Then we have things like Lindows where the user runs as root
all the time (for ease of use).  Eventually Linux GUI email clients will
allow you to simply click the attachment to open it (for ease of use). 
And if it was an RPM file attached, for example, and the email client
refused to do anything with it, then we still have user-training issues

I just have to switch to root and run 'rpm -i badfile.rpm' to install it. 
Cool.  This Linux stuff isn't so hard."

I think this is the start of a rather disturbing change in the tactics of
M$. First, it was "buy out all competition on the windows platform for M$
products, or cause them to not work. Be uncomeptitive." This evidenced by
the dozens and dozens and dozens of acquisitons/buy outs microsoft has made
over the last 10 years or so.

In the market of today, Microsoft has no real competitors for anything they
make. Notice I said "real" - this means someone who would consitute a direct
threat to Microsoft revenues. Well, except for OSS that is. We all know the
most prevelant OSS (at least in people's minds and in the news) is linux.
Microsoft has decided to take it's "working" domination plan and modify it
for the OSS world. How long before they start buying other OSS companies?
Can you envision a buyout of redhat? Sure, it's farfetched, but who's to say
it's not possible? Redhat "won't be bought" - well, they've never had a
multi-billion dollar offer before.

Microsoft will be careful - they will identify "hot spots" of production,
commercial software on linux. They will *slowly* buy out these vendors. The
less vendors for a platform the less successful - this was evidenced by
apple in the early days of competition vs. windows 95.

This is my own conjecture, based on the trends on what I see and what is
happening.

The only real way to combay microsoft is to make everything free. If it is
free, then it cannot be bought out.

I'll end with a poem:

To cost, or not to cost: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler for the pocket to pay
The costs and moneys of outrageous fortune
And to bow down to those who would enslave you
or to support freedom of choice? There is choice:
To crash, to bluescreen? No more; A bluescreen ends;
The documents lost, the work is gone, heartaches
headaches and the computer out the window. Nay!
To process, to compute. To type in freedom
without worry of cost or crash; and the feeling,
the user is heir to, 'tis a computation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To crash, to fix;
to fix: perchance to learn new things: so hard!
Research, frustration, lost sleep: ay, there's the rub;
For in that brief crash what data may be lost
When you reboot your pc and scan your disk....
For those that would suffer the indignity
of microsoft, of paying for bits of nothing,
The oppressor's wrong, the guru contumely,
The pangs of monopoly, from law's delay.

My apologies to the great bard.

While it's true that a script to wipe out the user's home directory would be
trivial, my original question about being root to actually do any damage was
focusing on things like the kernel and root file system. Neither of these
would be impacted by a simple script unless it ran as root. 

BTW, Cooper's response was extremely informative. Thank you!

Well, most viruses are email born.
 And wouldn't a user be

Please note: the modular filesystem design of Unix/Linux makes home
directories trivial to backup/restore. Also note that it is very simple to
prevent executeables to be run from /tmp, /home/user or any other
directory. Please refer to my documentation about this at
http://www.mwvlug.org .

Also, please keep this in perspective. Here's what a user would have to do
on a "normal" Linux system to run malicious code from a Linux email
client:

  1. Select "Save As" and save the file to the hard drive

  2. Go to a terminal and type 'chmod u+x badfile' or change the
permissions using Nautilus or similiar file manager

  3. Run the file: ./badfile

Anything short of this is preventing users from running executables on the
system wich is definately possible. See above. The point is that there
needs to be a balance. The truth is that the steps above shift the
responsibility to the user as it was he that overtly ran the command; the
system simply did what is was commanded to do.

Then we have things like Lindows where the user runs as
> root all the time (for ease of use).

And hammered by the Linux community and the press for it. This is an issue
with Lindows, not Linux. I personally do not recommend Lindows for my
clients. I do think though that they provide warnings with their system
when a user is about to run a potentially dangerous command.

 Eventually Linux GUI email clients
> will allow you to simply click the attachment to open it (for ease of
> use).

No they won't. How long do think it would be before the news groups hammer
an email client for allowing executables? I tell you through my experience
there would be an outcry before the software even made it out of beta.

Even barring that, because it's Open Source you can do something about it.
Nobody in the Linux community wants to be considered "stupid" for allowing
GUI's to run code from an unknown source. Believe it or not, there are
solid security design principles that are well known to the security
community, and they won't hesitate to let a developer know when their code
is not up to current security engineering practices.

Of course, you could take your chances with a proprietary product and see
how far you get. Can you say, "Bugbear?"

  And if it was an RPM file attached, for example, and the email

This is more of a social engineering exploit than a technical flaw with
the system's security, and you're still running the command as root. One
of the first things you learn with Unix/Linux is that root is almighty.

You could turn the tables for an NT2000 system by saying, "Yeah, Bob from
the Windows list said that I only had to run this service_pack.exe as
Administrator to fix the system. Cool, Windows isn't so bad."

Mandatory access control helps solve even this type of issue.

You're thinking about the /obvious/ way you would download and run an
executable e-mail attachment.  Even the Lookout exploits don't usually
use /obvious/ means--they exploit bugs in handling of multi-part
boundaries and such.

1. Use an exploit in MUA code; e.g. MIME handling or something.
2. Inject malicious code.

It's certainly not as easy as having Lookout automatically open the
malicious file, but it's entirely conceivable.

No, but none of the really nasty Windows viruses have done anything that
would have required special privilege either.

If MS offers enough money, then it probably won't make a difference to
them. If it's a publically traded company, then the stock holders could
require that the offer be accepted.

Right. Not to be dogmatic but exploits are caught and patched early. This
helps prevent MIME type and other exploits.

Again, I must stress that there are several mechanisms available to
prevent even this type of exploit, including MIME type handling, buffer
overflow, or otherwise. Please see my documentation listed in a previous
post.

Anything is conceivable but open review during the development phase and
due diligence with security updates go a long way to stopping known
exploits with sound design.

'due diligence with security updates' is where the rubber meets the
road, and (to further torture the analogy) most people who run a
personal computers are hydroplaning.  

patching a security hole is usually trivial.  getting end-users to
update their own systems is like trying to herd cats with telepathy. 
sharper minds than my own (e.g. Bruce Shneier's) have said that the
"release then patch" security policy is bankrupt.

most large-scale exploits of Microsoft code use holes that have been
patched for months; the same is true of the rare worms that have
affected *nix systems.  there's no reason to think that wide-scale
adoption of linux on the desktop will change this, and every reasons
to think the situation will get worse.

viruses, worms, etc. spread mostly due to user and administrator
ignorance.  the particular flavor of computer on which they run is
incidental and largely determined by market share.  if Linux had 90%
share, most worms and viruses would target it.  fewer would succeed,
perhaps, than on windows machines, but it's been pointed out before
that most malware is poorly written to begin with.  there's room for
improvement :)  when your exploit target is Outlook Express you don't
have to try as hard as you would with (e.g.) Pine.

the more people using Linux who want a simple "click this" interface,
the harder it is for companies to justify secure-by-default systems. 
and i don't mean "justify" from a security standpoint, but from a
shareholder one.  like it or not, shareholders don't much care how
easily your software can be exploited as long as you sell lots of it.
pillory Lindows all you want for running as 'root' by default, but
they're basing their decision on market share, not security.  sound
familiar?  that's one reasons Windows has 90%+ share and OpenBSD is an
arcane specialists' tool.

more and more it's easier and cheaper to keep Bad Things away from
desktop machines than to keep them secure (i'm talking mostly about
corporate networks, not home machines).  TCPA et. al. aren't likely to
solve the problem -- they'll have exploits of their own.

so as someone said earlier, it looks like microsoft is making a pretty
smart attack here.  a successful attack on the barrier between your
competitor and a hostile environment means you won't have to attack
your competitor directly.

There is also no mechanism to prevent malicious execution of code at the
kernel level with Windows, either (i.e. ipchains/iptables).

Not with 95/98/Me, but there is with NT/2k.  I dunno what XP has.

Check out 'http://www.freegis.org/'.  This is probably the premier site on 
the web for _free_ GIS software and pointers to free and minimal cost 
data.

If you or anyone else is interested in a - version or two old - copy of
the CD they sell let me know.  I have several will send out for free while
they last.

There is nothing in the syslog, but ps tells me that dhclient is
running.  Does anyone know anything about that client?  Like, does it
really suck, or something?  Its config file says that little or no
tweaking should be necessary.  (I tend to agree with that statement,
considering how preponderant the use of DHCP is.)  There was a message
somewhere explaining that dhcpd is no longer recommended, but maybe
that's poppycock, and I should try to get it installed.

By an arduous process I was able to get that etherconf package
installed, incidentally, which allowed me to reconfigure the network via
debconf. But it still doesn't work:  it tries for maybe fourty seconds
to get its IPs, then gives up without a word indicating its failure.  I
have a Win98 machine and a Linux From Scratch box which have no trouble
with DHCP, so I'm wondering why this woody distro is being so mulish.

Any clues?

I wish I could remember where I saw this, but I know dhclient needs to be
rebuilt for the current kernel version. I know I had this problem once and
it was solved by recompiling/reinstalling.

I googled a little too, and it seems like people who also have this problem
and could not find a resolution switched over to dhcpcd and it worked..

Hope this helps!

Subject: [PLUG] Printers
Message-ID: <1055459593.7910.25.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I've got almost everything working on my system now. MP3s play (though
not through XMMS), video works fine, my Internet connection goes through
without a hitch. Qwest should be sending me DSL equipment in a couple of
weeks (I need to contact my ISP and tell them i won;t be going over to
MSN after all).

The one hitch left (besides the old bugaboo of installing software and
the face that none of the software I install shows up in my Red hat
menus) is that my printer, a lovely new Lexmark Z65, is not supported by
Linux. We have already determined that there is no driver for it, it
runs on a USB connection and while Linux will recognize it's there when
it's plugged in it won't print to it.

Since neither I nor anyone I know have the patience to hack my way
through to a driver, I need a replacement printer. Preferably used and
in good condition, at least 18 months old, and one that is known to be
supported by Red Hat Linux. A color inkjet would be my personal
preference. price is definitely an object, and it would have to come
with a parallel cable of its own. Ideally I'd like to buy from someone
who's upgrading.

Anyone know where I can get such a printer?

Michael,

  Shuffle over to Easy Software's Web site <http://www.easysw.com/> and see
it that printer has a driver in their PrintPro-4.4. I bought a copy several
years ago for my HP LaserJet 5 and DeskJet 2500C and I have no complaints.

Thanks for the tip. I went to the website and found they even have a
search engine. While they support several models produced by Lexmark
(including a whole bunch of optras), there is no driver listed for the
Lexmark Z65 Color Inkjet.  My guess is that the printer is too new to
mhave made the cut (I got it about three months ago and it appears to
have been designed exclusively for Windows users.)

I would stay away from the cheapo specials - unless you don't mind replacing
your printer when your ink runs out. I myself have a Z35 color inkjet, the
quality is superb! The printer cost $30! The replacement cartridges cost
MORE. So I ask myself, is it worthwhile to purchase a cartridge for a used
printer or to buy a new one that will come with cartridges? The
environmentalist in me screams out in pain! I chucked it and bought a used
HP laserjet 1100 - It's a workhorse! Replacement toner is $40, but it will
print thousands more pages than that inkjet.

If you don't mind used (and have no luck here), try ebay -  here is a
lexmark lj 1100 (color) for $10!

I've got an old Epson Stylus Color II. The output looks messy, but I've
printed from Knoppix. I think it just needs a thorough cleaning. I've
bought a newer printer, so you're welcome to take it off my hands for
free. I live in Beaverton, near the intersection of Murray and Scholl's
Ferry roads and I work at Intel's Jones Farm facility. Email me directly
if you're interested in a free but ugly printer.

Thank you, Mr. Chorman.  These are good clews indeed, though they seem
to indicate my debian distro' is not well assembled.  I really wanted to
try debian because of the praises sung for apt-get.  Little good that
does me, though, if I can't get online!  (Where's Karl Hegbloom when you
need him?)  And this is one of the prominent "net install" distros (the
LordSutch.com image), so I would expect it to make connecting a snap.  I
don't get it.  I hate to download all eight ISOs for the official release.

I would also be interested if it is possible to do secure file deletion on

I see, I did misunderstand your original point, sorry about that
Stafford. I still can't agree that much of what's been presented defines
any technical weakness though. I see the main problem as being a lack of
measures taken by users and providers to manage and secure their
resources.

As for the socio-economics theory; I've seen no qualification that
supports it. Until there is actual fact presented I remain skeptical.

I am in need of a specific kernel RPM for a specific use. The software
being installed will ONLY work with that kernel. Rebuilding from source
is not an option. Redhat doesn't seem to have that kernel available for
download. If you could please check to see if you have this file onhand,
and would be willing to let me have a copy, I would appriciate it very
much. 

The filename is kernel-2.4.18-17.i686.rpm. Or, if you have the src rpm,
I can build my own. 

Thank you.

I have an older NIC which can use either the tulip or de4x5 driver. 
Well that statement is actually wrong.  The tulip driver will load but I
can never get the NIC to work properly.  It works like a charm when I
use the de4x5 module.

If you are looking for an automatic dependancy resolution/package
downloader/portage system, try gentoo.. I've installed it on everything from
a p120 laptop to an athlon xp 2000 - and everything in between.. Granted,
you do have to wait for everything to compile but it is well worth the wait.
Most gentoo users are either ex-debian users or newbs (or so it seems from
the forums.)

Bonus - you don't have to download a bunch of isos. In fact, you don't have
to download ANY isos if you don't wish to.. You can install from an existing
installation, as long as it has net access and chroot ability (you will just
have to wait for bootstraping to finish which takes a few hours by itself,
more or less depending on system speed.).

From experience (I work for one of the evil cable companies, not Comast) I 
would say this too is a overgeneralization.

Turns out we have about 120,000 for our cable network covering areas in 
Washington, Oregon and Northern California.  Most our our IPs are within /18 
blocks in the 66.X.X.X and 68.X.X.X range.  Turns out my IP at my house, 
provided by Earthlink DSL is also a 66.X.X.X IP address.

ATT owns the 12/8 block because in the early days they were giving IPs away to 
whomever wanted them.  Somebody at ATT was smart enought to get a class A 
network.

There are Universities with class A networks.  So what.

Recently I was at a NANOG meeting and found out that if you as an individual 
had requested IPv6 IP addresses a couple of years ago, they would have given 
you a /32, which in IPv6 terms is HUGE.  Just because you asked.

BTW, we (cable company) made the decision in the beginning to distribute 
public IP's on our cable network in /23s to limit LAN type portscans and 
protect the customers.  

The technical people who manage cable IP network usually have telco and DSL 
experience as well.  Most of the differences you see between cable and DSL 
isn't how the companies operate, it's because FCC rules are applied 
differently to cable companies and telco's.  Telco's would love to live in 
the cable world and have similar AUPs, however federal regulations prevent 
that from happening.  Cable companies are not going to sit back and live like 
a telco just because, they are going to take advantage of everything the law 
will allow.

I'm curious about your language and expectations here.

What would be an example of a "qualification that supports it"?

And what in the analysis wasn't factual?

The RPM you're looking wasn't also known as 

    kernel-2.4.18-17.7.x.i686.rpm
or
    kernel-2.4.18-17.8.0.i686.rpm

by any chance, was it?  
 
The 7.x version is available here:

    ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/redhat/updates/7.3/en/os/i686/kernel-2.4.18-17.7.x.i686.rpm
 
and the 8.0 version here:

    http://altruistic.lbl.gov/repositories/redhat-updates-8.0/RPMS/kernel-2.4.18-17.8.0.i686.rpm


Good luck,

I tryed to collect information on everyone who had contacted me by
mid day Monday 9 June 2003, and I gave this information to Gretchen
Bartholomew at O'Reilly.  At that point, we had 32 volunteers.
Gretchen is checking into things, but she thinks O'Reilly can use
all 32 volunteers - altho a few people will be asked to work days
other than Wednesday or Thursday.  In any case, Gretchen will
contact volunteers directly with details.  Also, I missed a few
people who didn't contact me by mid day Monday.  Sorry about that,
but I had to cut things off at some point.  Also, I really tryed
to include everyone who contacted me and I think I succeeded.
However, if by chance I missed someone - please forgive me.

Script-kiddies are suburban, bored, and anti-social.  The suburbs are
pretty much designed to turn out these kinds of people.

It IS a surprise that more aren't certifiably psychotic (or maybe that's
what all the medication is for).

I suppose it might make sense that kids try to scan other people in
their close proximity (IP, speaking) in an attempt to gain access to or
information about their neighbors (which is a gross misunderstanding of
the scale of the cable business model, but I digress...).  An adult
would probably know better than to scan folks on his own network because
the complaints are more likely to result in a suspension of service.  An
adult is paying the bill... a suburban kid is just fucking with Mom and
Dad's connection and they'll just go to anothe provider (in the kid's
mind).

</Jeme-snip>

Can you qualify any of these statements with fact (medical and/or
legal)? Don't misunderstand me Jeme, your comments sound feasible but
they appear to be pure speculation.

no doubt.  i use nothing but Debian; last time i needed to install on
a laptop, i downloaded the disc 1 ISO of Sarge[1].  even this, as you
know, is massive overkill -- really all you need is the bare minimum
required to get the installer connected to the 'net.  the smaller the
better, which is why the LordSutch ISOs are so cool.  but they're not
always as stable or driver-full as the official ISOs.

i tried a LordSutch ISO a year or two ago and had no luck.  you can
also try Jigdo[2], but the download takes freaking forever since it's
billions of small files.

Debian's install process needs work, no doubt.  but take comfort in
this: one reasons it's sub-optimal is that the developers never need
to use it.  once you install Debian on a machine you never need to do
it again unless you massively hose something; apt-get lets you stay
incrementally up-to-date.

Always wanted to try gentoo.  Looks cool.  So I did, just now, and it,
too, fails to connect to the 'Net:  and it uses dhcpcd instead of
dhclient. Now I'm scritchin' my head again, because I've tried two
different NICs and every combination of options to dhcpcd.  Tried
sending the host name, the MAC address, everything I could find on
google.

I noticed the dhcpcd process IDs keep changing rapidly, until they
finally die out altogether.  I don't know if that's how it's supposed to
work, but then I checked the syslog (the "everything" log, in
gentooland), and I saw a whole lot of these messages (I'm guessing one
for every process):

[dhcpcd] dhcpStop: ioctl SIOCSIFADDR: Bad file descriptor
[dhcpcd] dhcpStop: ioctl SIOCSIFFLAGS: Bad file descriptor

I don't suppose anyone can explain that, because google produced nothing
useful.  Maybe my motherboard is fscked, or maybe it's a memory problem.
At one point I was getting outa memory errors.  (Sure could use a
descriptive error message once in a while. . . .)  Mr. Chorman, do you
know how I can set up a swap partition after booting from the gentoo CD?
 Maybe that would help.

It seems Win98 is the only OS this machine is capable of running.

No problem, and like I said, I wasn't talking about the differences
between the two types of transport. Also, based on what Sean Whitney
just mentioned, my generalizations about ip allocations may have been
off base anyway.

As much as I hate floppies, you can download the rescue.bin, root.bin,
and driver-1.bin through driver-4.bin floppy and use rawrite (dos) or dd
(nix). You can then do a netinstall with for everything else.

That's probably the most common way to install Debian systems.

I will answer for him.. :-) Anyone wishing to add may do so. Sorry for the
off-topic post, but this needs to be responded to.

FACT:
Have you ever been a kid growing up in suburbia?? I spent most of my teenage
years in Salem, Oregon and in Provo, Utah (don't cry for me portland.) I,
and every damn last person I've known in similiar environments, can vouch
for this. There will be no "hard" proof, other than looking at economics. Is
it feasible to put large stadiums/many theaters/recreational activities in
less-populated environments? They won't make money. You need a population
base. If things are close enough together that you can walk/ride bike is
that really suburbia, or is it an urban environment?

Sure, some kids get through it ok. I also knew kids who grew up in the worst
possible circumstances (you don't want to knw) who are in college, "doing
okay."

Some of this is speculation. Some of this is looking at things like
Columbine High. Enough said.

> It IS a surprise that more aren't certifiably psychotic (or maybe that's
> what all the medication is for).

Surgeon General David Satcher announced in 1999 that 20 percent of the
population -- one in five Americans -- is mentally ill and in need of
treatment. A recent UN study puts this number at 30 percent - sorry, I don't
have a link for this (saw it on CNN). People seem to forget this, and seem
to forget that crime, imprisonment, and institutionalization are on the
rise. Is this number decreasing or increasing? You be the judge. Look around
you. 1 out of every 5 people you know is crazy (on some level.) Does this
REALLY suprise anyone?

This may be partially true.. As a teenager I was dialing the BBS circuits
(anyone remember capricorn rising in salem? i loved that place.) and didn't
get net (slip) access until 1993 - none of my neighbors had this and I
wasn't interested in scanning establishments.

I *think* (being one of those disillusioned, bored, and anti-social teens at
one time) it is a combination of A. Boredom and B. Curiosity and in some
unusual cases C. A need for destruction (much like graffiti and vandalism).
The cable networks give you a guaranteed pool to search from. I just did a
scan for port 80 on my local /24 net and found 2 dozen web servers, most
IIS. The odds are just greatly increased when you have a "bigger pool" to
fish in.

Hahaha! I just did that, but I don't do it regularly. And I know some pretty
dumb adults. Most adults get their kicks out of porn sites.. Teens can't
watch porn with their parents around, but how many parents know what the
output of nmap looks like, or what it is for? Ahh, my child is doing
technical things and expanding their brain! :-p

and

On top of that, most kids don't realize that there are consquences for
electronic vandalism/trespassing.

Let me know if any of these are not the "hard facts" you are looking for and
I will do research for proof..

It sounds like your driver is not the correct one for the card you have -
what type of network card do you have in your machine? I remember briefly
something about a tulip driver... What driver does it show when you run
lsmod? If nothing, what about cat /proc/pci?

Have you switched NICs lately? Some cable/dsl modems "remember" the MAC
address and will not give out a dhcp address to anything other than the
original NIC. Try rebooting your cable modem.

It's *probably* one of a few things - network communication getting garbled,
bad driver, bad cable, NIC on the fritz, modem on the fritz, etc.
Communications are not working correctly, basically. Pretty vague, eh? When
you see this, do the logs give you any more detail?

Sure, if you have swap partition /dev/hdax, type
#swapon /dev/hdax

if the swap partion gives you errors, type
#mkswap /dev/hdax
#swapon /dev/hdax

What type of chipset is it? The info on the NIC type would be helpful in
troubleshooting. Also, which live CD did you try to install from? The latest
is 1.4rc4 - don't use rc2 as there are many known issues with that cd.

This is acting like the interface isn't connected to the cable, or the
cable is bad or the hub is bad, or something along those lines.

Success in getting an IP address is not a good criteria for deciding if
an OS is compatible with the hardware.  At most it lets you know that
the NIC you've got isn't compatible.  However, it could also be pointing
to hardware problems elsewhere on your network.

If you have a bad hub, or an incorrectly wired cable, then the slower
than a dog WinIP stack still might function, but even slower than
usual.  The nice fast linux stack will still work, just not well.

This is looking more like a hardware problem than a distribution
problem.

I've installed the Debian Net Install on a fair number of machines, and
only once did I have to change the dhcp client, and that was back when
Woody was still unstable.

Good Luck,

Derek Loree

The debian site recommended it.  And it didn't tell me

  I just upgraded from cups-1.1.14 to cups-1.1.19. However, when I try to
restart cups this is what I see:

[root at salmo /etc/cups]# /etc/rc.d/init.d/cups start
cupsd: Child exited with status 1!
cups: started scheduler.                                   [  OK  ]

  Does anyone know why the daemon responds this way?

  I'm also seeing nothing when I run /usr/sbin/printers. It can no longer
find print pro but I'll go upgrade that and see if this problem goes away.

Sigh. Friday afternoon, too.

I've downloaded WINE. I don't know if I've gotten it to install, It's so
hard to tell when nothing I install shows up on my GUI menus. Though. I
was wondering about how Windows emulation works in Linux, so could
someone give me a basic overview?

It might also help to set your LogLevel to debug to get the full scoop.
That would be in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf

That might tell you more. I also found I needed to make sure my 
/etc/cups directory had everything owned by lp with group sys.

Message-ID: <3EEA590C.6010808@pacifier.com>

My wife is trying to install RH 9 on an Intel m/b (875P chipset) w/on-board 
serial ATA southbridge controller iCH5.

The installer doesn't find the drive.  Any magic kernel params to pass to 
make it work, or is she stuck with installing an ide drive and patching a 
kernel once the os in running?

Hoping someone has the answer off the top of their head.  Gonna do more 
googling myself.

If you're using KDE, try running KAppfinder under Settings.
Well, if you're RH, that might not be the way.  However, look under 
settings and see if there's something similar.

This article 
http://www.linuxhardware.org/Features/03/04/16/1610236.shtml
suggests that the sata part of the bios can be set to some  legacy mode 
enabling the installation of RH9.
I know that with my  845P chipset Intel m/b, the 2.5.68 kernel checked for
Sata drives. I don't have one so I don't know whether it would work or not.
Once you get installed, you might want to go
for a development kernel to get full use of the drives.

Message-ID: <oV3qPk+F1Gi79RDRpJH7Y=H8fwFu@4ax.com>

HI,
Okay, well I finally got off my lazy butt and started setting up my
linux box to dialup my isp. The first step of weaning myself of the
one reason I keep a windows box around. 
After much frustration with finding my modem and making it work I now
find I can't get past the login to my ISP. Simple, yes I know,but I'm
stuck trying to locate something intelligent (okay, simple to
understand) off the web. 
I need to know how to write a login script for minicom.
Granted, I know HOW to write a script file, but I'm nervous about this
one. Grepping a log for who logged in when is easy. 
This I'm just nervous about. 
I 'm only using minicom until I can find and understand something
better, like xisp or maybe something else. But I'd appreciate(with as
little jesting as possible) some help in getting me past this first
low hurdle.

Just to let you know my plans for this summer are:

Get Linux to print from my networked hp1600n

Setup Linux to dial into Aracnet and stop using the win98 box for web
surfing and email(goodbye beloved Agent99)

Setup Opera 

Setup nes/mail readers other than pine and nn

====
So far I've got the printer printing and I've got the modem dialing,
but just not getting past the login.

the rest will sort of have to wait.

Thanks,

Harry

It helps if you do research.

And read the manual.

Wine is not a trivial thing, though it appears to be at first glance..
Depends on whether you are trying to play games or not.

To give an overview would take me 3 hours to type. I don't feel like it, as
someone else has already done this. Did you read the manual? It gives an
overview. I know you didn't - one of the first things it states in the
manual is what WINE stands for - WINE is not an emulator. There is no
windows emulation in linux (disclaimer: that I know of) ..

http://www.la-sorciere.de/Wine-HOWTO/book1.html

A little light reading for your Friday evening... ;-)

It's tulip that is finding the card, as I gather from dmesg.  This is
the same card as on my workstation, the Linksys Network Everywhere (not
quite!) NC100 v2.1, and I use tulip on that machine as well, without
issue.

I've switched over the NIC from my workstation, using its same cable,
plugged into its same port in the hub, so everything was identical all
the way to the motherboard.

Thanks.  I can use that.

What type of chipset is . . . the NIC?  See above, I guess.  The part
number is E570 Rev.AA.  Fairly new, fairly common.

And I used the rc4 gentoo ISO.  Grabbed it just today.

  Excellent point, Mark! Many thanks. I'm trying to do this while getting
other work done because I have three _major_ proposals due next week ($$$)
and I need the printer for those.

  Not everything there is lp.sys; a lot are root.root, but worked just fine
before. Regardless, I'll change 'em all.

wvdial and wvdialconf are useful here. 

wvdialconf finds the modem and sets up an initial configuration file
in which you can put your phone numbers, login names, etc.  

wvdial does the dialing and starts ppp for your network connection.

This card should not be giving you problems.. (Not in the face! Not in the
face!!!!!)

OK. So basically what is happening is for some reason the tulip driver is
(probably) not getting configured properly. Probably something stupid like
autodetection not working (or maybe even some sort of PnP Aware OS setting
in the bios.. Maybe gremlins came down and are nesting on your card,
shorting some connections.) Who knows, right? hehe

The one thing you have in your favor is that the card is being detected and
the correct driver installed.

I found this great utility that  Donald Becker (author of the tulip driver +
many others) wrote to find the current state of a card running the tulip
driver. I have attached it to this email (and sent it to you directly in
case this list does not allow attachments).. One thing to check is the
current link speed and duplex settings - this will tell you what the card
thinks its running and you can compare it to what it's really running..

Save this source to disk and from the prompt type:

#gcc test.c -o diag -O

The -O was necessary. I don't know why.. I don't know what this program
returns, but it is supposed to give the information I mentioned above. My
thoughts are that your card is trying to force the wrong speed (i.e.
100BaseT FDX) when the cable modem thinks it is supposed to be 100BaseT
HDX.. Or something different.

There are a number of options you can pass to the module to force various
things.. Run that diag program and let us know the outcome...

What you state here is almost all speculation and generalization mixed
with some facts that may or may not be relevant to the original thread
reply. As I said before, I see the feasibility of the argument but in
the absence of any evidence that script-kiddies are bored suburbanites
that hang on cable networks, that this generalization somehow pollutes
cable networks making these networks technically inferior to DSL, I
remain skeptical. Now if someone could present meaningful, quality,
numbers that prove this theory I would be a little less on the fence
about the subject.

well it took a couple of tries and a trip to Google but I finally got
WV to dial. But same problem as minicom, fails to login. Wv goes to

But at least it's dialing.

There are no hard numbers. No studies, no facts, no figures. Just educated
guesses. What I do know is that most of the warez and self-proclaimed
hackers that I see trolling newsgroups and forums are uneducated and
immature. This does not mean they are teenagers, but it does imply this.
Most, but not all, adults I have known and worked with are too scared of the
repercussions to do anything illegal - plus most of them are too busy with
their "lives" to attempt this. The few hardcore adult "security experts" I
know don't bother with the average joe unless the average joe crosses them.
This is a generalization based on experience.

I finally found something though - I did not want to send this empty handed.
No hard numbers, but information submitted to the government of New Zealand
by the Internet Society of New Zealand - who better to come up with numbers?
This is reinforced by numbers from the FBI. Apparently the parliament was
having the same skeptical issues as yourself. This is a snippet from this
document -
http://www.internetnz.net.nz/public/working-group-reports/wg-internet-surveillance/iswg010317letter-ageinfo-SelectCtte.html

<-----start snippet----->
"LETTER TO LAW AND ORDER COMMITEE, PARLIAMENT, NEW ZEALAND.

...
The Internet Society of New Zealand, Inc (ISOCNZ) was pleased to have the
opportunity last Thursday to make an Oral Submission on the Crimes Amendment
Bill #6. We appreciated the fact that the Committee members had obviously
thoroughly read our Submission and had penetrating questions to ask.

During our Oral Submission we felt it important to flag that a percentage,
possibly significant, of offenders under the proposed legislation will fall
into the under-16 and under-18-year-old categories and that therefore the
ability of the legislation to deal with such offenders will need to be
considered. Anecdotal evidence suggests that "hackers" start "exploring" in
their mid-teens through to their early twenties, and while some may continue
longer, many give it up once they get a "real life" with the pressures of
their job, and associated responsibilities.

In response to the request for documentation on the age-groups of people who
maliciously interfere with computer systems, our team has spent considerable
time searching for documented studies. We have to report that we have not
found evidence of any formal studies to back up the widely quoted anecdotal
evidence. This may be a useful area for the Select Committee to research.

I attach two documents sourced on the Internet which reinforce the anecdotal
evidence. The first is an FBI Congressional Statement (1) and the second a
report from Dorothy Denning (2) who is a well respected computer security
writer"

I personally don't use a modem - haven't for years. I used to work for
netgear - we had this really great modem router and the #1 authentication
people had was with the authentication protocol - CHAP, PAP and MS-CHAP. If
the protocol was wrong, the modem would hand shake but fail at the point
where a username/password was asked for.

Things may have changed, but knowing the internet they are probably the
same, but more bloated.. ;-)

I don't know about the items you are using - most of our customers used M$
products.. Check with your ISP and see what auth protocol they are using and
make sure yours is set to the same.

Actually, it does seem to reinforce the argument that script-kiddies are
kids (hence the term kiddie) but it does not speak a word to their
origin or media of choice, which is the question on this thread. Tis
true that with maturity comes responsibility and that "youth is wasted
on the young" but are they wasting away in suburbia hanging off of a
cable modem or are they apartment dwellers on DSL? I'm remain
unconvinced that it's on cable alone.

Me too................. But I have that gut instinct that tells me I'm right
(he said knowingly as he jumped off a cliff, knowing wings will mysteriously
grow from his feet..)

I started a poll on the gentoo forums, asking for age demographics combined
with internet access type.. There were six options:

Under 25, Dial-up user, DSL user, Cable user
Over 25, Dial-up user, DSL user, Cable user

I will respond with the results once the poll has had enough responses, that
is - if I still care that far in the future.... The problems with this
metric include: the fact that I did not include an option for script-kiddie
or not, and only asked "those who consider themselves 'hackers'" to respond.
There is always the chance the response will be inaccurate or a lie. This is
only polling one particular cross-section of computer users, not including
other distros or the Mac or M$ world. I'm sure there are more problems I
have not thought of; however, the gentoo forums are full of people who call
themselves l33t (I hate that term!) and like to talk about haX0rs and such,
so perhaps this will be at least partially informative.

My curiosity is getting the better of me.....

Subject: [PLUG] Ambitious newby question
Message-ID: <01C33219.D50A9E80.jorgens@coho.net>

Hi all,

I've played with Linux on and off for years, but have never done enough to 
get more than a modest comfort level with it.  I have decided to play with 
it again though, and I have a relatively ambitious plan (for a newby like 
myself).

I have set up a Debian Sarge box I want to use as a general purpose server, 
primarily a file backup server.  I really have 3 separate purposes for the 
box, and I want to keep them all isolated.  Since I'm neither a Linux nor a 
security expert, but I will be backing up both sensitive personal data and 
sensitive business data, and I hope to play around with setting up other 
Linux services such as mail spam filtering, etc.,  I'm hoping to set up 
something that can be relatively secure over the long term even with the 
shabby maintenance I'm likely to provide, and User-Mode-Linux looks like 
just the ticket.

My idea is that I would have a Samba backup system for personal systems in 
one UML, another Samba backup system on a separate IP address on another 
UML, another UML for experimentation, and another UML for mail filtering, 
DNS server, etc. after I've made them work in the experimental UML.

Of course, the trouble is that I really have no clue how to get started 
setting up UML on Debian/Sarge.  I found a document at 
http://www.megahosted.com/~en/papers/uml-debian-mini.html that looks 
probably really useful if I had someone to translate it into newbyese for 
me.

Oh, one more thing.  I'm trying to use a Western Digital 185GB IDE drive 
(not the boot/root drive) on the controller that comes in the box with it, 
and so far Debian only sees it as 137GB (The Extended Int-13 limit as I 
understand).

Can anyone do any of the following for me?
1.  Tell me what I need to do to get the full 185 GB regognized on my data 
drive.
2.  Help me with how to get started (I have gotten as far as getting a 
basic Sarge system installed/booting).
3.  Tell me this is too ambitious for a newby, and suggest an alternative 
strategy.

Thanks in advance,

- Steve Jorgensen

I have never seen that error, but perhaps something is using
/var/lib/prm/Packages already? Just a guess tho.. ;-)

Well, I can't help much with SAMBA right now - Prob will be able to next
week tho, I'm learning :-) but if you want to install a webserver and mail,
I can help. Debian is my choice server OS, so I can do it for sure on there.

Chorman, I couldn't get that test.c thing to build.  I had booted from
the gentoo CD, remember, rc4.  It didn't have gcc, and when I tried your
command using cpp instead, it started returning an error about not
finding /usr/bin/python, over and over again, until the whole OS
eventually siezed up.  Which perhaps is telling in itself.

Maybe I could build a static-linked one on my workstation, but I would
know how.

It would be interesting to study a month of firewall logs generated by
that random group. My suspicions are that you would find just as many
scans and hack attempts, percentage wise, on DSL as you would on the
cable users. Considering that you would not likely know the source
address of the hack (providing the scanner/hacker had half a brain),
this would only paint half of the picture - it would be a good start
though.

Message-ID: <20030614185756.GC22761@subtend.net>

We're having a little garage sale this weekend and it gave me a chance to put
out some old hardware I have.  If anyone wants it, it is going cheeep.
Anything not sold will be sent to Free Geek.

I have:

Mac IIsi + monitor/kbd/mouse (no keyboard cable)
HP Apollo 715/50 (LOUD SCSI drives)
HP External Cartridge load CDROM
SGI O2 (no multimedia board, has video.. ask for OS CDR's)
Apple ][e with Monitor III & dual beige disk drive unit
HP Entria X terminal
HP C160 (128RAM, PA-RISC) with extra non-installed SIMM's
68-ping SCSI cables (was used for differential HP SCSI equipment)
HP DLT4000

The HP's would make unique linux projects.  I also have an Ultra 5 which
isn't out, but would be looking to get rid of.  I'll also put to gether
a pile of PC hardware which is free for the taking.

http://www.subtend.net/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=DirectionsToHouse

I won't be checking my email, so I can't answer any questions.  Sorry if
this type of post is not allowed, I just want to find the hardware a
good home before it is junked (especially that sexy looking O2).

Message-ID: <20030614193429.GA12253@blain.org>

Hey everyone,

I am running exim on Debian stable. I am running my domain through my DSL connection on a dynamic IP. As everyone knows, AO(f**king)L is blocking mail from all dynamic mail servers.

Is there a way to make exim use a smarthost when sending only to aol users, and run normally for other domains? I know I could run all mail to a smarthost, but I would like to avoid that if at all possible. I did find a way to send mail directly to domainA and/or domainB and use a smarthost for the rest, but I want just the opposite. Any clues appreciated.

Jeff

What is the reason for backing out?  You haven't told me what your
problem is yet.  This order is lined up and you can install whatever
you want.  I have checked with a list that has many professional
consultants on it, memory concerns with this board are in their

either.  GPL software, xosl, is legal for me to use and you to copy. 
Why aren't you taking up my offer to help with the software end of this

you even refusing to fill the order for a KVM switch.  The latter
product works no matter what I decide to do for a system.  In the future
I hope you don't take on any more orders that you refuse to fill.
I accept the refund and will come in to pick everything up.

Would you please stop using the PLUG list to air your dirty laundry?  I
don't really care about your disputes with vendors, especially as it
seems you're trying to use the list as a threat of bad publicity to
pressure him into supporting whatever you're trying to do.  If he's not
being co-operative, there are plenty of other vendors you can use who
have already been recommended to you; at any rate don't involve the
whole world.

I appreciate the back-up there, sir.

I might add a point or two (or counterpoint, even).

It's not the population of suburbia, it's the sprawl and the zoning that
prevent real neighborhood or town square development.  Small towns exist
all over the country that have low populations but nice town centers with
theaters, shops, public spaces, and easy access from all corners.

It doesn't have to be urban.  It can be a town or a village.  Suburban
sprawl throws out everything humanity has ever known about building places
where people live happily and started from scratch with the idea that
people don't want to be anywhere near one another and drive everywhere
they go.

In most suburban subdivisions, there's just one (maybe two) outlets from
the (zoned and enforced) residential area onto a "feeder" road.  You can't
leave the single-use monoculture without a car.

We live in a really sick society.  I'm not surprised by those numbers
(though I'd be interested to see how the bases for the estimation).
Mainstream culture seems to promote nothing but isolation, fear,
insecurity, and suspicion.

Yeah, I'm not sure what kind of "hard facts" a person could produce that
would show that suburban youth are bored and anti-social.  There's plenty
of anecodotal evidence and we see the aggregate behavior of bored,
anti-social people in mall culture and so on, but how do you derive
accurate survey information (say) from people who are too anti-social to
care about giving accurate results and too bored to be honest?

We can look at the actions at various scales and we can look at the
environment and what it's effects appear to be.  That's as far as we can
go.

(That's quite a sentence.  [Well, it only has one period, anyway.])

I asked what you meant because I didn't understand what part you felt
needed further proof.  I can go into that now.

First, I didn't mean to imply that cable is technically inferior to DSL
for any reason at all.  I certainly didn't state that the actions of
script-kiddies "pollute" the networks they transit.

I essentially had four elements that I tied together:
Script-kiddies
Bored, anti-social behavior
Suburbs
Cable internet service

The assumptions, I felt, were the seemingly obvious associations of the
first and last pair as couplets.  The rest was just reason.

The actions of script-kiddies corresponds pretty well with people that are
bored and anti-social.  They're scanning huge networks for some nominal
thrill-in-destruction.  If you've got the time and energy to scan huge
networks AND you get some kind of thrill out of very small challenges
(like slipping a trojan to IIS), you're probably bored.  And if you're
attempting to do damage or find ways to do damage to other people's
systems, you're probably anti-social.

The suburbs are typically sprawling masses of "development" with very
little centralization of resources or services (except at the mall).  It's
hard to provide DSL service without telephone central offices regularly
intermixed among the subscribers.  This is best achieved where the
telephone system corresponds to centralized systems of roads, sewers, and
human activity.  Cable internet, however, requires only cable television,
which has been building out to the suburbs for more than twenty-five
years.

The rest of the original post was just pointing out that the suburbs were
also really good place to raise bored, anti-social people and therefore
script-kiddies flourish there.  That wasn't so much speculation as plain
cause and effect analysis.

> Now if someone could present meaningful, quality, numbers that prove
> this theory I would be a little less on the fence about the subject.

What kind of numbers would make you feel warm and fuzzy?  Some things just
don't quantify in any meaningful way.  There's this constant attempt in
our society to make everything seem like science because science is
somehow more right and justifiable than anything human (neglecting the
simple philosophical fact that science is a purely human invention).

Could numbers show you that an image is beautiful or an action served
justice or a person loves you?

I don't think numbers apply here.  We're talking about quality, not
quantity.  Post-war Suburbs are terrible places.

Woah!  Now you want someone to show you that script-kiddies are ONLY on
cable?  I don't think that was a conjecture in this thread at all.

However, I think it's pretty easy to show the relationship between the
suburbs and the mindset of the script-kiddie... and the association of the
suburbs and cable is pretty clear, too.

And the statement that script-kiddies and cable modems are somehow
associated is the root of my skepticism. Do you think that
script-kiddies are a product of cable modems? They did exist, and
practice, before cable modems were in wide distribution you know.

Read this again Jeme, you have to see that it's based on generalization
and speculation. It is an interesting opinion though, which is why I
stated that I would like to see it qualified.

No, I don't think script-kiddies are a product of cable modems.

I think that there are lots of both in the suburbs.

It's not generalization, it's practically a proof by definition.  Bored
and anti-social only mean anything in the context of supposition and
speculation.

It's as qualified as you make it.  You wanted to see it quantified which
is impossible.  (The best you could MAYBE do is provide some numbers to
show that network probing might appear to originate from cable modem
assigned IP segments than certain others, but that doesn't mean much.)

I think the correlation between the suburban life and script kiddies is an
interesting idea. After all, we can all agree for sure that there are much
more script kiddies in affluent suburbs than in urban areas. Walk through
downtown Los Angeles, after 6 pm. Do any of these teens look like script
kiddies to you? Do you think any of them is about to head home and sit in
front of the computer with their rootkits and exploits? No, they have an
active social life and human interactions. They form very close and
tight-knit communities where they come to spend most of their time,
socialize, and even depend on one another for their very survival.

>From here, it's a simple and straightforward reasoning to conclude that

Interesting. Highly skewed, but still interesting. So essentially your
claims present something that is known flawed and unsupported by any
measure of fact, but you still expect your audience to accept this?

Getting back to the basics, I had previously stated that I see the logic
in your argument but was skeptical. At this point, I see that there is
little substance to this argument - my skepticism grows.

I'm not sure that I fully agree with this. Although this seems feasible
I think that it lacks substance necessary to make a convincing argument.
After all, not every kid in an urban setting needs to rely on peer
membership for survival.

We are assuming that the individuals in which you speak of don't have
Internet access at breakfast or in the computer lab in school (which,
incidentally, is where most of my incoming scans come from - high school
and college labs). Besides, what exactly does a script-kiddie look like
to you, Marilyn Manson, John Ashcroft?

You don't need to iterate this to me but there are some on the list that
could benefit from the knowledge that a month in Santa Ana would put the
burbs of Anytown Oregon in a much different perspective.

But the script-kiddies are just what they were five or more years ago,
nothing to worry about if you know how to protect yourself. I see no
difference between now and then except that the tools are getting
better, as are all software tools.

Sorry my friend, the argument is weak.

OK, Matt, I installed gentoo on my laptop. Sort of. It's having trouble
with bringing up eth0.  I think it might be something to do with
cardmanager or the pcmcia subsystems.

The network card module is xircps2_cs.
It will not load with modprobe.

What else do you need to know.

Subject: [PLUG] Class and.or tutoring in Red Hat 9
Message-ID: <1055703330.19822.15.camel@localhost.localdomain>

	I have come to the conclusion that I am going to need to either take a
seminar or get some tutoring in Red Hat 9 to use at its greatest
effectiveness. There is a learning curve with all operating systems, and
I am slamming into the wall on this one. The problem I've encountered is
that none of the technicians I've discussed my problems with in the past
in more detail have been all that familiar with Red Hat and its
proprietary elements themselves.
	Are there Red Hat users on this list at all, or is everyone using some
other distro? Is there any way to change distros of Linux without losing
either the file structure or the files themselves if it comes right down
to it having to?
	But if I keep Red Hat 9, I have to learn how to install and upgrade
software, preferably so it shows up in the GUI menus (the one piece of
software I've successfully installed, an AV player, does not show up in
any of the menus on the interface. I have to type in the filename
whenever I want to use it.)
	Does anyone know of either a weekend seminar I can attend or a tutor
who will come over and teach me the fundamentals? Alternatively, is
there a really good manual for Red Hat 9 that assumes the user is an
absolute beginner with Linux? (I bought a book called "Linux for Windows
System Administrators". Problem is I'm an 'end-user".....)

That's kind of hilarious because those of us who don't use Red Hat stuff
sometimes feel like that's all anybody on this list uses.

Are you concerned with stuff outside /home?

It's pretty easy to just move the stuff you don't want touched at all to
another partition and just wipe the standing installation.  MOST of your
config files and all of your data files will be just fine after the
change.

If you're looking for ease of administration, I'd recommend a Debian
system, though you should recognize that a stable Debian distribution is
going to keep you within a stable, secure set of programs (tens of
thousands of them, of course) and you'll have to work a little to be on
the bleeding edge of software revision.

I have yet to encounter a Red Hat user on this list. Maybe they simply

Not really. But I am VERY concerned with the stuff in /home and there is
a whole bunch of functionality I need (OpenOffice.org, PDF, audio and
video including DVD and MP3, etc.)

Pretty easy for someone who's done it before, probably.

If I can install the latest editions of OpenOffice.org, Scribus (a DTP
program native to linux) and Adobe Acrobat Reader (for some reason there
are some .pdf files the other PDF readers won't handle).

I have a whole other drive I can copy the /home directory to if the need
arises.

No, there are plenty people here who use Red Hat.   A number of the
people I see posting I know from familiarity run Red Hat.  If it's
because no one answered, your questions, well, maybe the people who know
don't have time or inclination.  You might, however, try Red Hat's
mailing lists, which are pretty busy.

There's nothing terribly RH-specific about installing these; the problem
you're having adding them to the menu is, I think, that there isn't a
graphic menu editor for GNOME like there is for KDE.  (At least, if
there is, I haven't found it.)  The actual means of adding to the main
menu is difficult; actually, I think you just have to add your own
Drawer to the Panel for custom Launchers.  If you right click on the
Panel (in a blank area), "Add to Panel" -> "Launcher", then fill in the
name, executable name, and select an icon, it'll create it on the Panel,
which you can then drag into your own Drawer.  I just a custom Drawer to
keep the handful of applications I actually use in.

I wouldn't bother trying to upgrade to the latest OOo, unless the new
version has something you really need.  I tried to upgrade to the Ximian
edition, but it crashes consistently when trying to save in the native
OOo formats (they had the "brilliant" notion of changes the defaults to
MS Office formats), so don't try to install that one either, unless
you're prepared to revert.  (It doesn't seem to happen to everyone, or
they'd have fixed it by now, I guess.)

You might also consider a subscription to Ximian Red Carpet; the paid
version of the service will let you install a number of common
proprietary applications, like Acrobat.  That will, at least, fix the
problem of creating menu entries.

I'm convinced that Red Hat is the worst distribution to
use if you're trying to learn _Linux_. There are far
too many Red Hat-specific things that conflict with
learning materials, documentation, common practice, etc.

It's best to learn _Linux_ using a distribution like
Debian or Slackware (or anything else besides Red Hat).
Once you're reasonably up to speed on Linux, then
install Red Hat and learn how it is different.

Note that you can install more than one distribution on
your hard disk. You can install, say, Red Hat Linux and
Debian Linux. Boot into Red Hat Linux for doing your
desktop publishing and into Debian for learning Linux
and everything else.

As you learn more about Linux, you'll realize that your
choice of a distribution grows less important. Experience
and knowledge allows you to do things yourself rather
than relying on a vendor.

Naturally, there are people on this list who love Red Hat
Linux and will disagree with me. Their opinions are
important as well. Welcome to the freedom of choice.

  No, we're all here. We don't feel a need to evangelize and get others to

  <http://www.openoffice.org/> and download the latest version. Very
explicit install directions there, too. <http://www.abobe.com/> and download
the linux acroread.

  I've yet to find a file that cannot be opened by xpdf or gv, for that
matter, but only with acroread. However, YMMV.

The tasks you are describing are more specific to the Gnome desktop
than to Red Hat 9 or Linux in general and so would be similar in any
distribution where you are using Gnome as the desktop. In any case
there are tutorials here

I am setting up a network server box, so I don't want a fnacy X Windows 
system, etc., but I'm finding that I will want to run basic X from time to 
time.  I tried downloading basix X packages and Blackbox, but I can't get X 
to work.  Following howtos, the last step I got to was trying to test the 
server with XFree86 -xf86config /root/XF86Config.new.  I get too much 
output to fit on the screen, and it doesn't seem to work with less.  What I 
do see includes a message that says symbol xf86InterpretEDID from module 
/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/libvbe.a is unresolved!  Next, it fails to open 
/dev/mouse, then couldn;t load XKB keymap, etc.

Finally Fatal Server error: failed to initialize core devices

What should I try next?

I don't know if Red Hat is the 'worst' in this regard, but I tend to
agree with Ed that Debian feels more specifically Linux-like than Red
Hat. (I haven't used Slackware for about six years, so I'm not really
qualified to comment on it.)

Whether that's good or bad, however, isn't necessarily clear. I work 
in a mixed Solaris/Linux environment, and I really appreciate Red Hat 
for being more Unix-like than Linux-like. There are things I really 
like about the Linux-ness of Debian, too, but the generic Unix feel of 
Red Hat sits well with me.

Your mileage, of course, may vary.

That's true as a user -- though as an admin, I'm somewhat chagrined at 
how Red Hat-specific many of my home-brewed scripts are. I've thought 
about trying to integrate Debian or Slackware into our common Unix 
infrastructure at work, and I realize that it's a nontrivial task to

* set up the local distro mirror
* write/learn the tools to keep said mirror up to date
* write/learn the tools to do hands-off installation and first-time 
  configuration
* write scripts to get the local package manager to safely report
  on the state of the local system vis-a-vis the central mirror
* figure out how to model the distribution-specific stuff in our 
  cfengine rules

None of this is particularly hard, but getting it to work in such a 
way that it handles errors gracefully is more than a little time 
consuming.

As someone who specifically responded to one of your XMMS/MP3/RH9 complaints, I

Is Red Hat more Unix-like or more Solaris-like - or both?
I rarely use Solaris so I don't know.

I'm chagrined at how my scripts are so specific to my view
of the way I think things _should_ be. If I ever get a job
in a Linux shop, I'll have to change my evil ways.

Among Unix (non-Linux) users, Solaris has gained reputaion of being "The Unix",
and if another Unix does something differently, then that Unix is "just weird".
It's not entirely deserved, but well entrenched. For example, for a long time
Solaris threading support was the standard everyone else was measured
against. It was also the best-working one. You developed a multithreaded
application on Solaris, then, if you ran it on another OS and it did not work,
you knew with almost absolute certainty that their threads are broken.
Then IBM came out with a new threading model, which is much easier to work with
and in general provides superior performance. But it does not behave quite
the same way as Solaris. Guess what? It's "that weird threading library from
AIX", and the one from Solaris is still the golden standard.

The plug clinic is next Saturday.  That would seem to be the logical 
place to start.  There are many experienced Linux users at the clinics.
Even if you don't get direct answers to your questions, someone should
be able to point you in the right direction.

  I do believe, Ed, that you've hit on the major stumbling block of those
who defenestrate and leave the One True Way of Redmond behind. With linux
(and, I presume, all unices) we all can arrange everything to work as _we_
want it to.

  Rembember when the Berlin Wall came down and the East Germans didn't know
what to do with their freedom and choices? It's the same in Afganistan and
Iraq. Simple things like deciding on what you want to be when you grow up,
where you want to live, and what you like are all decisions that were made
for folks before by the central governments. Well, the analogy with OSes
holds.

  I'm learning the differences between Slackware and Red Hat. Can't say
one's better than the other (well, for my needs I can), but that's why we
have a gazillion different distributions.

So, given the number of under/unemployed persons here, this sounds like a nice 
little opportunity. I'd love to lend a hand, but commuting from Eastern 
Oregon is a bit much. :)

Have you looked at the manuals that come with Red Hat? I think they are very 
good. Hard copies come with the boxed sets, and also the complete set is 
available somewheres on redhat.com. I recommend starting there. As Ed pointed 
out, Red Hat does things their own way, so starting with the RH manuals will 
get you up and running faster than anything else.

Red Hat has a habit of changing things with every release, so you really want 
the manuals for your specific release.

Another thing to keep in mind is most of the software is third-party, such as 
the window managers & desktop environments. The RH manuals will help some 
with those, for deeper knowledge visit their various web sites. Sign up for 
support lists wherever you can, for example KDE has its own lists, you'll get 
better help there than on a general list like PLUG.

Good analogy. I usually use the Stockholm Syndrome as my
analogy of Windows vs. Linux.

Amen on that. Has Red Hat ever used the same window manager
for more than two consecutive releases?
Few things are more worthless than old Red Hat manuals.

How can newbies learn Linux when the system is changing
all the time?
Much of what you learn today will be different tomorrow.

  All I can tell you is that you are very lucky lawyers haven't decided that
they know everything there is to know about linux. If ever they do so, look
out! With their pressure to be billable 90% of the time and make large,
6-figure incomes (or more), they offer themselves as "experts" in all sorts
of fields. :-)

Well, I have answered your questions as best I could, as have others on this
list. In fact I have spent a number of hours doing research and sending you
emails privately off this list. Apparently you were using other people on
this list the same way, and none of us "fit the bill". I feel used... I even
emailed LEXMARK TECH SUPPORT FOR YOU! I'm breaking up with you....

I am almost offended by this - I spent over 3 hours last week trying to help
you - I told you I do not have a lot of money, and I reiterated that I keep
myself fed by supporting people on a contract basis. You seemed desperate,
so I decided to help the best I could for free over the e-wire. Research,
time spent in emails, a little more research - that's $120, please.. Just
kidding... Anyway.. I kept running up against the fact that you had not
*seemed* to do any research at all. Judging from your posts you seem to be
well spoken and half-way intellegent, so perhaps your problems are not
coming from our inability to help you but from your unwillingness to help
yourself? Did you ever, even once, RTM? (read the manual?) With your xmms
problem (not playing mp3s) - if you had gone to the xmms website you would
find, this:

      Red Hat 9 Apr 01, 2003
      The mpg123 plugin for Red Hat 9 can be downloaded here. This plugin is
needed to play mp3 files.


Why do I post here, you might ask? Simple - sometimes people just need a
"nudge". A little pointer in the right direction brings a ton of help.. None
of my friends have any technical skill and this seemed a great place to
network and find a group of people who have similiar skills. My brain was
stagnating (technically)...... I am not a free tutor - there are other
people on this list who run a great workshop that will help you install your
distro of choice and also teach you a little about what you need to know.

I do not run Redhat, though I am fairly familiar with Red Hat 7.3 (and a
little with 8.) Most of the problems you were having were pretty general.
You were wanting to know how to install RPMs - I and others told you how to
do this. You were having problems with XMMS and the redhat decision - we,
once again, showed you The Path To Knowledge. Did this not work? Apparently
not. What was the error? Maybe now you see my frustration?????????

Redhat is the closest thing you will get to a commerical distro. They offer
excellent support options. If you PURCHASE redhat 9 you get 30 days of free
support/installation help.

Let me guess, you don't want to lose the 1000 emails you had to download?
Stick it out - the learning curve is not as steep as you might think, if you
try and learn (even a little.....) We can't carry you up the mountain.

When I was using Redhat 7.3 almost every piece of software I installed via
RPM DID install a menu entry. Perhaps things have changed - perhaps that is
why you are asking for a "redhat user". Stick it out - switching now will
only make things more confusing... (Maybe you are not looking in the right
spot for the item? Perhaps it is a KDE program and it is under the KDE
menu?)

There are really thick books available at Borders, Powells, Barnes And
Noble, etc.. (i.e. any new book store that has a tech section). Once again,
only you will know whether or not it is good as only you seem to know where
your problems lie. Why don't you run down to the store and check out the
books for yourself? Only you know what you need.

Whether or not you run windoze XX or GNU/anything, you are administering
your system yourself (unless you are at work and you are not the admin.)
That is the problem that you are having - you think that you should not have
to get your hands dirty. YOU are administring your system, we are merely a
knowledgebase/moral support. You just jumped headfirst into a sticky
situation and you are asking for help in learning to escape and navigate.
Please remember this - you are asking for help in LEARNING - not for an
administrator.. Switching distros to something else is not going to solve
the problems I mentioned above. You, not I, must study and find the answers
to problems. If you have trouble implementing those answers, feel free to
ask me for help again. I will be more than willing to help you!

Matt

(PS - this email may sound harsh, but anyone interested may see a copy of
the emails exchanged between Michael and myself.)

Redhat always offers you your choice of WM (i.e. kde vs. gnome).. It is up
to you to decide which you want to use. I know for a fact Redhat 7/8/9 all
came with both KDE and gnome.. Perhaps it is you who has not used the same
WM for two consecutive releases?

Stick with a release - Redhat 8 is no better or worse than Redhat 9. You can
then say, "Well then the newbie won't have the most up2date release, just
up2date security patches.."  How many newbies know the difference between
tried and true and bleeding edge? (Other than the amount of crashing.)

> Much of what you learn today will be different tomorrow.

As is true with any sort of highly technical and evolving profession. Ask
your doctor how many hours a week he spends in either continuing eductation
or reading medical journals, etc.....

I see Red Hat as the bleeding-edge Linux, the one that pushes development 
forward. If it weren't for Red Hat, I think a lot of things would not have 
advanced as quickly or as far as they have- like RPM, Unicode support, Xfree, 
gcc, and other stuff I forget now. Every distro does things its own way- 
Mandrake, Slack, SuSE, Debian, Gentoo, etc- there is no "universal Linux". 
This is the great strength of Linux, though it can be a bit daunting when 
you're getting started.

Remember also Red Hat funds a considerable amount of Linux development. Kernel 
hackers gotta eat too! I think their low-end/free-download releases are more 
for testing new things, and to get people to use them. Their high-end server 
products are more stable and consistent, and obviously are the real 
revenue-generators for the company.

As others have pointed out in this thread, there are no bad Linuxes, just 
different ones.

Well, I'm not sure how to respond given that KDE and
Gnome are not window managers. Perhaps you've made my
point for me.

Until you've tasted Debian and, perhaps Slackware, you might
have a hard time understanding. I have a friend who was a Red
Hat fan. He criticized the Debian enthusiasts for being
overly-zealous crazies. Then he installed it one day and the
light bulb clicked on.

Keep in mind that I'm not saying that you should run Debian
for your desktop computer. You'd probably hate it. But if
you're using Linux for your servers, you should try it - unless
you like being on the cutting edge and your boss doesn't care
that you can't fix problems quickly because you have to learn
the new version of Red Hat.

  And I've used Xfce for years. Never used either KDE or Gnome; know nothing

It's my turn to be curious: in what way is your view of the way things 
should be evil?

> I'm curious. Do you use Red Hat for both servers and workstations?

Yep. Given the cavernous size of local hard drives these days, I
basically have two profiles: login server and infrastructure server.
The first might be a shared server or a personal workstation, but it 
essentially comes with all manner of user applications and development 
tools. The latter has restricted login rights (admins only), typically 
doesn't have much (if any) X stuff, has few development tools, and 
only the apps/daemons it needs to fulfill its niche in the network 
ecosystem.

Combine Red Hat's kickstart system with cfengine and Eric Harrison's
nice tips on maintaining a fully patched install tree using the
anaconda tools, et voila! It takes me well under an hour to bring a
machine online, fully patched and configured for our environment. 
Server or workstation, it doesn't matter...

It's evil because it's not mainstream; it's not the way the
rest of admindom does it. Of course, I don't teach this in
classes.

I tend to be a minimalist and an advocate of simplicity.
Layers of abstraction that exist only to compensate for
a lack of knowledge on the part of the admin and/or
increased complexity for little benefit are annoying to
me.

The best example is /etc/sysconfig - that's another
learning curve and for what benefit? If I have to set
a default route, I can do it with one simple command. I
don't want to have to remember which file in which
directory contains the GATEWAY parameter. If /etc/sysconfig
eliminated the need to know how to use the route command, I
could acknowledge a benefit, but you have to know the route
command anyway - unless you want to call a consultant
every time you have a network problem (back to billable hours).

I also prefer BSD-style startup. Everything is is one
directory and I can easily and quickly adjust the scripts
to accomplish whatever I need to do. No chasing your tail
across directories. Of course, SystemV startup is not
difficult to master so I don't complain too loudly. BSD-style
is a minor preference. However, when you marry SystemV-style
startup with /etc/sysconfig, it gets ugly and I complain
more loudly.

Errr...  OK, so you use the route command everytime your system starts up?
 Wouldn't it be convenient to store those network settings in a file?  I
personally like /etc/sysconfig because it's a central location where most
system/network variables are stored.  The rc scripts then parse their
appropriate config file in this directory for setting various parameters. 
In any case, even if you didn't know where to set the GATEWAY parameter
you could quickly scan through the network rc script, just like you would
on any other *nix.

Hm, I might argue the SysV init sucks without /etc/sysconfig.  When
written correctly, I have a good deal of control over the init scripts
and the processes they start, without diverging significantly from the
standard installation.  I can do it more easily than I can with the
rc.conf approach, especially programmatically.  I can be more confident
that my script to, say, configure BIND to run chrooted will work as it's
supposed to and more importantly, not mess anything else up.  The
'network-scripts' part can be a little hairy, especially if you're not
working with Ethernet interfaces and if you're not using the Red Hat
tools to set it up.  But I find basic actions like renumbering an
interface to be much easier with the sysconfig approach--I edit the
ifcfg-ifaceX file, ifdown ifaceX; ifup ifaceX.  I know that a) The
running machine has the new IP address and b) It will work on reboot.

The SysV approach for process initialization I also really like.  I like
being able to start and stop and restart daemons with easy commands. 
With BSD, I have to read through its init portion, sometimes actually
figuring out what a complex shell script is doing, and stop it and start
it.  With the SysV approach (and the 'service' command, which might be
RH-specific), I can easily stop and start a daemon.  With the
'chkconfig' command, I can easily set it to start or not (and I can
easily grep for the commands that do or don't start).  The lack of a
'chkconfig' command really aggravates me about Solaris too; I have to
sort through the scripts and figure out where to make the appropriate
symlink and look through the directories to figure out what's starting
and what's not (and SCO OpenServer [may it rot in hell] is even worse).

And if I install a piece of software, what's the appropriate way to
configure it to start or not?  With BSD, it's either a) Put it in
rc.local or b) put it in /usr/local/etc/something, and I also have to
figure out whether its a "system" daemon or port/package/tarball daemon,
so it may or may not be set to start through rc.conf.  (Not to mention
if you're upgrading a system daemon with one installed separately.) 
With a SysV system, you drop a script into /etc/init.d and possibly an
init config file in /etc/sysconfig and you've done a good deal of work
that the sys admin doesn't have to do and you've given yourself or
people who will write tools for your daemon a good headstart.

Parden my lack of verbosity - KWin and (Sawfish/Metacity/fvwm/etc) of which
Redhat ships with all of the above (at least as of 8, not sure of 9 on fvwm
and sawfish).. ;-)

If we're going to be picky, should that not read "AFTER you've tasted Debian
and, perhaps slackware"? If I had not tasted them, would this not be the
reason I would have a hard time understanding? Cha cha cha...

I run gentoo on my server which is currently hosting two domains, both email
and www. I run WinXP/gentoo on my desktop (Sometimes I like games, sometimes
I wish to be productive). I cut my teeth on slackware and have tried debian.
Neither lived up to MY expectation - though they probably work well for you.
That's what makes it fun!

That's funny because I've heard people say just the opposite. In fact, I
still run across people in the gentoo forums (don't ask me why) who run an
OLD version of redhat at work and need help (old=6.x or something). They
keep it up2date and though it may not be the latest, greatest Redhat 9, it
is rock solid and works great for them still (though redhat has dropped
support for older stuff now..)

All I'm saying is it is your choice whether or not you install the latest
and greatest and possibly changed distro or whether you stick with something
you know and something that works (and take the time to keep it Secure(tm)).

Also, I'm not sure where you worked, but in my experience the SA would have
soiled his pants if we EVER upgraded any of the OS (win nt/redhat/win 98)
that we ran arbitrarily. You have to have integration testing and systems
validation to make sure product X will run product Y and blah blah blah
(stupid corporate talk for "Cover Your Ass"). Which makes my point - if you
don't do research on what you are running and don't check things out first
you are just asking to have problems you can't fix quickly (regardless of
the OS).

Just my observation.. ;-)

My bad.

I did not understand the sentence until after I'd posted and read my own

Subject: [PLUG] Not airing vendor problems...
Message-ID: <1055752285.14450.133.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

It's been suggested that vendor problems should not be aired on this
list.  I haven't seen another way offered by the Portland Linux User's
Group to address this problem better.  One suggestion is a list just for
finding and dealing with vendors aside from this one.  Another point
I want to make, Linux is limited at this time by how difficult it is
to build through a licensed bonded vendor.  The purpose I see in a
vendor more than anything is to not get into troublesome or faulty
hardware in the first place and to avoid having to do all the research.

I hope many will appreciate that I want to go with 100% Linux 
compatible hardware.  I think my experience is insightful for all
those who have been pushing Salem legislation that would force
public institutions to research OSS in all purchasing decisions.
Who on this list has built a Linux only vendor or at the very least
a Linux friendly one?  EMU may be a good choice, but it is neither
in St.Helens nor in Scappoose where purchasing online all the time
isn't what I imagine most people consider ideal.  

Especially if your time matters at all.  Part of pushing and 
developing legislation is connecting it to real life situations.  

Considering Portland is rumored to lack an accredited computer
science program at PSU, I must strongly question the claim that 
Portland is the whole world.  This lack of a strong, diversified,
computer science program at PSU in my opinion is one of Portland's
biggest problems right now.

On a positive note, it looks like my vendor is going to
do enough of what I asked to end my need to go after him.

Maybe if I could know more about other people's vendor experiences
I could have fared better and saved this list from potentially
irritating posts.  Hope this satisfies anyone who considers my
posts "dirty laundry."

  You shouldn't. I asked the same question on the mail help and postfix mail
lists months ago and I was convinced that doing so will produce unintended
consequences.

  Many legitimate broadcasts are sent with all names in the Bcc: field to
ensure privacy among recipients. I know that I get legitimate mail from
organizations of which I am a member that are sent that way. So, since this
is not a good idea, what are the alternatives?

  In my postfix UCE filters I check for IP addresses and domain names I
don't want coming in. In the header_checks I have subjects, individuals and
other key phrases (such as references to the "Quicker Dicker-Upper",
appendage-enhancement drugs and other common spam topics. Then, of course,
there are the body_checks and a large list of RBLs that are checked.

  These are working extremely well for me; I guess that I average fewer than
three spam per day that sneak past the defenses. I've also taken the
suggestion posted here a couple of months ago and changed the '@' in my .sig
file and Web pages to the html code.

Is sarge the same as testing?

Anyway, I just configured X on testing by booting the machine off a
Knoppix CD and then grabbing the /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 it created.  It
works flawlessly.  (I did have to change on thing: add Emulate3Buttons
to the profile for my USB mouse.)

I'm running fvwm.

Can BASH do this with the aid of SED perhaps?

Here are two good links:

http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1593

Am not sure if they cover exactly what you are looking for, but seem to
remember that you can block on empty "from:" fields.

Indeed.  Looks pretty crappy from Squirrelmail too.  Spose though that it

I tried ripping out everything X and starting over.  This time, I have the 
advantage of knowing I'm supposed to configure x using dpkg-reconfigure 
xserver-xfree86.  During configure, I have a suspicious thing, it asks me 
for the card type, and there's a bound dign next to apm (a UI bug, or does 
that mean it's selected?) I can't make that go away or appear next to 
anything else.  Anyway, I put the highlight on S3 and press enter.

Finally, I try to test x by typing startx, and it doesn't start.  Of 
course, another thig I found out about is /var/log/XFree86.0.log.  I've 
attached the log output I get after running startx.

Well, from the XFree86.0.log you have there, X isn't starting because it
can't find any fonts. (Well, specifically the required font 'fixed'). 
It looks like X is configured to look for fonts from a local X Font
Server which is not running.  Assuming it's installed, you might want to
start it or add all of the font directories in /etc/X11/fs/config to
/etc/X11/XF86Config instead and see if that helps.

In my experience, this means you have a package manager already open and
locking the rpm database.

I can't speak for anyone else on this list, but I know that though I cannot 
say I've had a simliar experience, it has given me a bit of giggle to watch 
both sides struggle.

Well, I have not run across any hardware *LATELY* that I could not get to work 
under linux. Not to say it doesn't exist, but I would say that if you buy 
modern hardware from well known manufactures, chances are (99.9%) you can get 
it to work with linux. And what the hell does this have to do with OSS?? 
People have a right to pick and choose - he picked and chose, you either deal 
with it or "strong-arm" him like you did. Who is right? I abstain from voting 
on that.

So what you are saying is beggers can be choosers? That's why online sales 
have skyrocketed - people like you don't have to be limited by who is around 
them. Go online - there are some great and reputable stores online. You can 
order overnight. Impatient? Don't want to wait? Then quit complaining and 
deal with what you have.

My friend, if politicians thought like you would we have laws that state "Do 
not put ice cream cones in your pants pockets?" (virginia).. No, generally 
legislation COMES from real life situations that, errr,  "require" action. 
Like the law that says you can't put squirrels down your pants for the 
purposes of gambling (Once again, virginia). What the hell prompted THAT 
law???

This is why the OSS law is fizzling - some people (though small %) actually do 
use OSS in state govt - why make a law for it? If there was NO OSS in state 
govt I bet this law would have been passed in a heartbeat.. MS is no fool.

Portland is my whole world.. I live here and don't have a car so I leave VERY 
rarely. And what is your definition of diversified? Portland *seems* to be 
turning into the heart of OSS on the west coast. I don't know man, I didn't

Congratulations, strong-arm tactics worked. Perhaps you would be better server

legislation.

Vendor? Most companies I've worked for have gone through people like CDW - a 
truly great vendor - and I choose a combination of pricewatch specials and 
ENU (who, btw, has a store in hillsboro...)  Never had to deal with an 
asshole like the one you talk about.

A ton of errors, lets deal with the first "fatal" - Are you using fontdirs or 
xfs (X font server)? According to the logs X cannot find any fonts to use for 
a mandatory type (fixed). There are also no fonts listed that it finds.

If you are using xfs change the path to read unix/:0 If you are using xfs, 
remove the fontdirs. If you are using fontdirs, remove the unix/: line.  
Check to make sure that /usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1 and any others you may need 
exist (i.e. 100dpi, 75dpi, CID, Speedo, lcal, truetypes and any others you 
may have installed.)

  Yes. If I correctly recall the rationale, those who use such MUAs know

Have you tried using some of the existing normalization tools?  I use
something called normalize with great success.

Also, instead of manipulating the filename, you could just extract the
song title from the ID3 tag with something like
echo `mp3info -p "%t" $file|sed -e 's/ /_/g'`.mp3

This is not necessarily true.  If you allow for the blurring of
worm/virus/trojan then the most virus by number are office macros
(though there are not as many written anymore).

email is used as *one* of the methods for the nasty virii, like NIMDA,
which came in most systems via a hole in I.E. and then used local
network to attack shares, and then scanned for IIS, and then emailed.

Most modern clients will launch an app based on MIME type, today. 
Word/Openoffice/pdf holes can be access with a click.  If these
corresponding apps have holes, then the malware wins.

Still Mozilla, ghostscript, bind, sendmail and others have made errors. 
They are not perfect.  Plenty of people have chosen designs that are

Yes, the next step in that very script changes to the destination
directory to run "normalize *.WAV" - it's great since the volume level on
my MP3 collection can really very. Have you found a difference in volume
level consistency when you normalize one at a time vs. batch
normalization like I do?

Most of these files were downloaded from (shared by) collector's PC's, so
the tags aren't reliable. I appreciate the code, though. I'm sure I can
put it to good use in some project. If nothing else, it could help me
identify those files that need some ID3 tag work.

Thanks!
Paul

There is a difference, that's why there's both a -b and a -m.  -b is batch
mode for multiple files, but it assumes that all of the tracks are volume
balanced as though they were ripped from the same album.  -m is mix mode
and attempts to reset the volume level for each track after scanning them
all.

Which mode are you using and to what effect?

Retagging MP3s is a pain, but it's really helpful when you want to
dynamically or automatically generate playlists and stuff.

Unix email in the past have had header issues like Outlook.  Mutt, mh,
pine all have been vulnerable to header attacks.

So if you update constantly, and are 100% sure no one is every going to
run out of date software (to the day), then no.

I think a good chunk of the people on this list fit that description.

On the other hand if you are running older versions of mozilla mail, or
mutt, or pine, then a vulnerability may come out.  A virus scanner on
the emails will catch (based on updated signatures) new attacks on old
software.

There is still the social engineering attacks, some of which the virus
writers have used, albeit poorly.

There is also the issue of knowning the names of the viruses so you can 
collect the entire set and attach proper names to each virus.  (Kind of 
like collecting flesh-eating butterflies.)

Subject: [PLUG] A matgter of netiquette
Message-ID: <1055817425.5321.46.camel@localhost.localdomain>

	I;ve missed about two days' worth of posts, because after reading
Matt's comments in public to the list about our ongoing interaction I
immediately felt so ashamed of myself that I unsubscribed from the list.
Right then and there, without a moment's hesitation. Then i wrote
privately to all the people who had offered advice in the posts I had
received thus far, thanking them for listening to me and telling them
how essentially frustrated I was with the whole process. Except for
Matt, they all told me I should resubscribe forthwith if i wanted to get
the right kind fo advice. So that's what I did.

	I still feel I violated netiquette at some point, but I don't think
Matt was entirely blameless either. I didn;t expect him to publicly
explode like that, and offering to give away our private correspondence
to all and sundry struck me as somewhat beyond the pale, especially as
he was willing to do so just to make a point.

	It wasn't really necessary to make a point like that. Everyone here
knows by now that, at least as far as Linux is concerned, i am a
complete newbie. That I am not a trained technician, that I am not
skilled at troubleshooting, and that when a piece of advice is
complicated or contradictory I can't gain any benefit from it. people
who talk to me about a technical matter will have to talk to me as
though I were a high school freshman -- a particularly dense high school
freshman. I don;t administer systems for a living -- I'm a writer who's
just trying to run his own computer and free himself from the Microsoft
cycle. maybe someday, with the proper experience and counsel, I'll be
able to do some of the things that other members of this list do
routinely. Right now, though, most of the system administration tasks I
attempt simply don't work. For example, I had no way of knowing the
reason i was not getting sound from any of my applications was that I
had my speakers plugged in wrong. And nobody even suggested checking my
physical connections.

	 the frustration of any of you in dealing with me pales in comparison
to my own frustration in dealing with myself. If I can;t give detailed
descriptions, it's because I don't know the descriptions myself. I
suppose this means I should stop asking questions and maybe
resubscribing myself to this list was a bad idea and a lapse of
netiquette. Tell you what  -- if anyone doesn't want me around, tell me
so by private e-mail. If I get even one such letter, i will unsubscribe
again never to return.

Nope, believe it or not I told him to stay.. Told him he might learn
something.. ;-)

I don't care whether or not he stays, though the personal attack was a bit
much. I am more than willing to help anyone *learn*.

The main reason for the original email  where I berated him was because the
wording of his "second plea" felt like an insult to the knowledge of those
who helped him (including myself). I let him know this as well - in private.
It may have been a wee bit much, but I don't think I was too far out of
line.

Hypocrisy serves nothing but a personal agenda.

I'm sorry for polluting the lists with this crap, and I'm sorry that
Michael's issues with me were brought out in public. I should not have sent
the email that I sent before to a public forum. I will not let this happen
again.

Subject: [PLUG] Setting up basic X on Debian Sarge
Message-ID: <01C3345B.374D0A90.jorgens@coho.net>

Thanks for all the replies to my quandy, but I've already tried most of 
these things.  I had already tried using dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86 
which runs through the X Configuration dialogs, but I get the same kinds of 
errors.  I tried reconfiguring xfs, and it failed saying a symbolic link 
was missing, so I did a reinstall of xfs, and checked that it created the 
symlink it had complained about - it did.  Of course, I'm still getting the 
same errors from startx.  Is there something I should be doing to do to 
start xfs before I try to run startx?

Regarding Matt Chorman's suggestion to "change the path to read unix/:0 If 
you are using xfs", I'm not sure what this means or where to change it.

On another note, I've found some messages while doing some Web searching 
that seem to indicate that xfree86 4.2 is broken in Debian, and I should 
find and install one of the 4.3 source packages under development. 
 Opinions?

If anyone has any further advice, I'd be much obliged.

Thanks,

- Steve Jorgensen

More on my xfree86 problem...

When I try to run the script to start xfs, it says it's already started, 
but I don't see anything that looks like xfs in ps -A.

I checked in /var/log/messages, and I see the following messages:
Jun 15 23:03:42 syarchive Xprt_64: Couldn't open RGB_DB 
'usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb

Jun 15 23:03:43 syarchive Xprt_64: Fatal server error:
Jun 15 23:03:43 syarchive Xprt_64: could not open default font 'fixed'.

I remember the configuration sequence specifically telling me it was going 
to set up RGB and the Security Policy, and it didn't report any errors, so 
I don't know what the problem is.

Thanks,

Uhhhhh.. My bad.. Sorry.. Not verbose enough and the wrong information to
boot. I'm having a great day :-}

Change this line in XF86Config (or XF86Config.4, depending on your setup):

Section "Files"
               FontPath "unix/:7000"
EndSection

to

Section "Files"
               FontPath "unix/:-1"
EndSection

Sorry about that...

Please excuse a non-technical question. 

While looking at eBay to find a used VMWare license this guy sells a
bunch of current VMWare licenses for $31. After inquiring about the
legal status of these licenses he shares with me that 68% of the people
copy software anyways and selling the key that he bought is his way to
recover the costs (original mail appended). 

As one who earns his living with copyrighted IP I really feel like
turning this <german>Saftsack</german> in. Would you? And where?

Thanks

Holger

-----------------------------------------------

Hi,
There are over 68% people using copied version of
software. How many people anounces widely that they
use copied software? Not many people have enough money
to buy software. I know when i was madly looking for a
software to run windows in my linux machine. Then
after  cut down some serious expanses i saved enough
money to buy the original VMware. Isnt there people
like me who is dieing to switch to linux? Thats why i
m selling it for. 
You can still keep ur present Linux version VMware
running in ur computer with my license code. If u
think about it the auction is mainly for the license
code. Because anyone can download evalution version of
vmware from their website. If you really want you can
just pay the auction amount & i will give you the
licesne code instantly. That way u wont have to wait
for shipping. The license code will instantly unlock
the expiration date. 
What do u think?

My first suggestion is to look at whether or not closed source forever
is the right thing to do for your customers and the world.  I have said
to my mother that I believe keeping a program closed is wrong
though I'll admit she's not convinced yet.  I'm looking at studying
gnucash and the palm pilot since I'm now laid off.  To make money I
may enter into a project to add a conduit to Linux so that the gnucash
and quicken lite can work together.  Thing is, I want
my code if I accomplish this project to be open yet I need to earn money
for my efforts.  I think older versions of vmware should be open
sourced, but this isn't happening.  I think the best alternative is to
work on supplying Linux directly, no emulation layer, with what it needs
to support people from Windows land.  There is some question about what
constitutes fair use with many highly restrictive licenses.  Legally
though, I don't think anyone should try to sell keys to copyrighted
software they themselves are not going to supply with those keys in
accordance with the software's license agreement.

I agree.  I also feel that once "intellect" becomes property, humantiy
is not advanced.  Only the pockets of corporate greed.

But I also see free software as more than just programs, but revolution.

Okay, so I have done this before! I have my main server running just fine,
and I have a copy of all the configures I have used. So I started to use
them on my friends server.. Got it (PHP, MySQL, Apache2) all installed, and
went to start Apache.. No dice! First it was giving a bind error, but that
can't be right, we have it all setup right. Now it is not giving any error,
but just won't start the server. Here is the configs:

Holger,

  Please do turn him in to both eBay and VMware. It's illegal and it hurts
us all.

  The mis-placed idealism from some on this list is sometimes amusing and
sometimes annoying. It was the same naive idealism that resulted in
yellow-painted bicycles in downtown Portland for _everyone's_ use. Need a
ride? Take a bike and leave it for the next person. Guess what? Every single
bike was stolen and not recovered. Where's this program now in support of
"freedom of transportation"?

  How many of you have seen people pushing shopping carts stolen from
supermarkets? Do you know that those carts cost a minimum of $275 each?
Guess who's paying for the thefts? We all are in higher prices in the store.

  If you were a farmer, how would you feel about folks walking through your
fields and taking crops because everyone has the right to be fed?

  Perhaps the reason some of you are unemployed is because others with your
philosophy, values and total disregard for anyone else's rights stole the
product of the greedy, scum-sucking, filthy capitalist who employed you.
May the next language you learn include the phrases, "Do you want fries with
that?" and "Regular or premium?"

  Too many people today have either forgotten, or never learned, how to
function as a part of a society. There's an almost complete lack of
courtesy, consideration of others and a willingness to work with a group for
the betterment of all. Starting about 20 years ago the mantra used to be "me
first". Now it's "me only, and screw you, too".

  Peter Yarrow (of Peter, Paul and Mary -- go ask your parents who they are)
accurately summarized this change during their 25th anniversary concert
several years ago. He pointed out the history of American society as
reflected by the magazines available. First there was "Life". Then there was
"People". After this came "Us". Now we have "Self".

  My wish is that someday you grow up and become both responsible and
productive to society as a whole. In the meantime I'd appreciate not knowing
that you support theft and other illegal acts.

I was going to break this down and respond to individual parts, but I
decided not to.

The entire argument (which, in a nutshell, is capitalism works if you work
with it) is well thought out. The problem is that, in this "global economy",
capitalism only works for those willing to steal, bully, and push the little
guy around. In fact, the entire argument's flaw can be summed up in this
line:

I was never taught how to function as part of a coporate, ad-sponsored
society intent on selling me crap that is polluting the environment and
raping the third world. Don't blame me if I see around it and choose not to
participate.

Don't blame just the people, but corporations as well. Never forget that.
Did the family cause the family unit to break down? It functioned WELL for
humanity up until 50 years ago.. WTF happened??? Oh yes - corporate media.
Television.

You seem to imply that it's this reason (applied to the software piracy
world) that has caused me, and thousands of others, to be unemployed. Come,
come now.. We both know it is bush, dick, and colon in the white house that
caused that.. ;-)

This line - "Me only, and screw you, too" - sums up capitalism nicely! The
dictionary def. of capitalism: an economic system based on private ownership
of capital. Notice the word private, or closed. Which means if you are not a
part of our group you do not share our wealth. This is the major problem in
the world. American Capitalism is waging rampant war on the peoples of the
world, just to make a buck. It's a private club.

How does this compare with VMWare? It doesn't - I don't think he should take
that license. This german guy WILL be caught - eventually - and Holger would
then be liable. More than likely he would be implicated in a criminal trial
as well (notice my morals correspond with "cover your ass"). Is VMWare the
cause of the wars in East Timor? The oil battles of the middle east? The
diamond genocides in Africa? The drug wars in South America? No - they are
not. But capitalism as itself is not a good enough argument not to steal.

One more, then I'm done:

This is communism, my friend. This has ALWAYS been at odds with capitalism.
It takes from those rich old white bastards (no offense to any rich old
white bastards in the room ;-)) sitting in their ivory towers and
distributes it fairly. It equals the odds. Our societal consciousness is too
entrenched in capitalism for a friendly communist gesture to ever work.
Linux is the first communal experiment (that I know of, on such a global
scale) to work. Which is why I'm here - and I know that MANY (though not
all) in the OSS movement are socialist/communist at heart. Microsoft? I have
no more of an issue with them then I do with Mobil/Chevron or McDonalds. I
have the SAME issue with ALL of them. STOP RAPING MY WORLD!

All I'm saying is don't just blame the people - blame the corporate media,
the corporate government, the corporations, and THEN blame the damn people
who buy into it for current societal trends.

Why does galeon-1.2.7 in gnome call up 2 copies of a helper such as
RealPlayer or xpdf when I click on a helper app? How do I stop this so I
don't have to kill the extra one each time?

Wow. Interesting MAN page -- never read it before. :-)

The default, which would be -b, I would think. I don't want any averaging
so I put normalize in the loop, and let each file get normalized based on
the internal standard, rather than one set by a group.

Aren't there programs out there that make it fairly easy? I would think a
program could/would work on a directory at a time, listing editable tags
in a table. Know of any?

The whole idea behind capitalism is that you need individual initiative
where profit can motivate that.  The problem rises when people worship
profit and don't apply values to earning it such as how it affects the
environment, what affect it has on other people's ability to earn
profit, etc.  Capitalism isn't the only model that is destroyed by
greed:  monarchy fails under greed as does communism and yes even
socialism can be leveled by it.  Atheistic communism in the former
Soviet Union said that you had to believe that the State is God and
yes people were killed to enforce this.  What the Soviet Union did to
Russian Catholics made Hitler's Auschwitz look like nothing.  Capitalism
needs to be regulated properly.  The idea of private property, insofar
as theft is wrong, is important too though fair use and competition
sometimes need protection also.  Anyways, this seems to be getting OT 
so I hope people don't take it much farther.

Thanks, that what she ended up doing.  Does your m/b have the on-board e1000

I've read the original post a few times and I keep wondering if I'm reading it
correctly. There are two cases that are very different that I can read into the
post. One, the person bought VMware and is now selling only one copy, or two,
the person bought VMware and is selling many copies. I assume a person has the
right to sell used software that the person holds a license for, to another
party, if that person isn't using the software and not keeping a copy of it. I
think there are some EULAs that specify that you can't do this, but I don't
know if there is something legal backing that. One of the reasons for using
Linux is that this type of murkiness disappears.

I can't make up my mind what the person is really saying, especially if the
person isn't a native English speaker. English aside, I've watched many, many
disputes erupt over email because what one person was posting was read
differently by a reader. The Constitution was written how long ago and we are
still arguing over what it says? I have to assume the Constitution had a lot
more thought put into it than a email and was meant to clearly state what the
author meant, yet, it is still means different things to different people.

I'm also wondering why a person looking for an illegal copy of VMware, would be
buying it on ebay. I'm assuming it can't be hard to find a VMware key via a
search on google that won't require an exchange of funds and proof of a crime.
It seems the seller would be very silly to put up illegal software. Maybe ebay,
the seller, and you could sit down and determine what this seller is really
selling? It just seems to me there isn't enough information.

Thank you
Russell

Oops, I didn't expect this to become a political war. The ebay guy is
not German, it was just me calling him German bad names. 

As soon as I find something on Linux to replace Dreamweaver, Photoshop
and Fireworks I can do without VMWare. Maybe VMWare owns Adobe and
Macromedia and buys & destroys all efforts on the Linux side to build
workable tools? Oh - and customers working with IE need to also convert.

Under current law, which btw enables the way I earn money and feeds my
kids the eBay guy is a thief and is even proud of it. So I am turning
him in. After that we can talk about the law and see how we can change
it to a better without risking my family's economic foundation (I mean
discussing it somewhere else than in a technical forum such as this
here). 

Thanks for your thoughts!

    I was never taught how to function as part of a coporate, ad-sponsored
    society intent on selling me crap that is polluting the environment and
    raping the third world. Don't blame me if I see around it and choose not to
    participate.
    
    Don't blame just the people, but corporations as well. Never forget that.
    Did the family cause the family unit to break down? It functioned WELL for
    humanity up until 50 years ago.. WTF happened??? Oh yes - corporate media.

    You seem to imply that it's this reason (applied to the software piracy
    world) that has caused me, and thousands of others, to be unemployed. Come,
    come now.. We both know it is bush, dick, and colon in the white house that
    caused that.. ;-)
    
    This line - "Me only, and screw you, too" - sums up capitalism nicely! The
    dictionary def. of capitalism: an economic system based on private ownership
    of capital. Notice the word private, or closed. Which means if you are not a
    part of our group you do not share our wealth. This is the major problem in
    the world. American Capitalism is waging rampant war on the peoples of the
    world, just to make a buck. It's a private club.
    
    How does this compare with VMWare? It doesn't - I don't think he should take
    that license. This german guy WILL be caught - eventually - and Holger would
    then be liable. More than likely he would be implicated in a criminal trial
    as well (notice my morals correspond with "cover your ass"). Is VMWare the
    cause of the wars in East Timor? The oil battles of the middle east? The
    diamond genocides in Africa? The drug wars in South America? No - they are
    not. But capitalism as itself is not a good enough argument not to steal.
    
    One more, then I'm done:

    This is communism, my friend. This has ALWAYS been at odds with capitalism.
    It takes from those rich old white bastards (no offense to any rich old
    white bastards in the room ;-)) sitting in their ivory towers and
    distributes it fairly. It equals the odds. Our societal consciousness is too
    entrenched in capitalism for a friendly communist gesture to ever work.
    Linux is the first communal experiment (that I know of, on such a global
    scale) to work. Which is why I'm here - and I know that MANY (though not
    all) in the OSS movement are socialist/communist at heart. Microsoft? I have
    no more of an issue with them then I do with Mobil/Chevron or McDonalds. I
    have the SAME issue with ALL of them. STOP RAPING MY WORLD!
    
    All I'm saying is don't just blame the people - blame the corporate media,
    the corporate government, the corporations, and THEN blame the damn people
    who buy into it for current societal trends.

Michael,

My advice is to not take the criticism you received
personally. Stay a member of the list, there is a lot
that can be learned just by listening.

If you need to find an answer to a question, first go
to Google. Man pages can be helpful, though they're
better for reference than instruction. There are
numerous tutorials online for all sorts of subjects.

If you can't find your answer in other sources, then
post your question to PLUG. Just make sure your
question is specific. I don't remember your original
question that irritated some people, but I remember it
was very general, and would have been impossible to
answer in an email.

Anyway, don't give up on the PLUG list, it is a very
useful tool, just make sure you use the tool
correctly. One rule I try to follow personally is to
answer at least one question for every question I ask.

-Scott

That's good to hear. So if I buy an sata drive it should work.
My m/b has the Intel PRO/100  not the e1000 and is using this driver

This was sent to me personally, but I want to reply to the group in case anyone
else read my statement like Rich. 

I'm not saying Holger was looking for an illegal copy, I'm thought I was saying
that I thought a person looking for an illegal copy, could find one without
buying. I thought I was saying, I don't think there is a market and I can't
believe anyone would try to sell illegal software on ebay.

Holger, I apologize if in anyway I've offended you. 

Thank you

You'd think there is no market for illegal software on e-bay (at least not
unless it comes with the actual media, not everyone fancies a download of
Windows XP in a hundred pieced of a large zip file, may be more, I have
no idea how large XP download might be). If you go to Google
and search for "vmware warez" you find quite a few sites (don't do it,
even out of curiosity, if you're easilly offended by porn - you have been
warned). Nonetheless, lots of illegal software is sold on ebay, I can only
assume that most people don't dig the internet and view it in sort of AOL
model (content is provided for you by vendors, internet is a conduit to
connect to these vendors).

Russell, no harm done. I intended to buy legal, but used software, just
for the record. 

The guy (Wasim Ahmed) sold the 20 or so illegal copies in NO time. Here
is one of the auctions:

Well, she's kept the drive in legacy mode for now.  Not sure if she'll 
bother with switching back--if so I'll let you know.

Perhaps a newer kernel will have better e1000 support.  I guess it works 
fine with a card, just doesn't detect the on-board version of the chip.

On-topic for a moment: I just received a (legal) copy of VMWare 4.0. My first 
goal (which I am baffled - BUT- attempting to RTFM first)  is to set up  a 
SAMBA share so I can 'see' the linux /home/[my user directory] files within 
Win2k within VMWare.

Now, OT:

What about the invention of a viable form of birth control, which not only 
gave women the NEVER-before opportunity to be something else besides 'mommy,' 
it allowed both sexes to separate the sex act from family obligations. This 
deconstruction of 'sex = babies' unwound most of the social strictures 
encasing 'strong family:'
- Don't 'do it' till you're married, or outside of marriage,
- If marriage means sex it means children & decades-long responsibilities,
- Bastards couldn't inherit by default until about the mid-60's.
- For most men: You ability to get a good job or promotion is somewhat linked 
to society's observation of how well you're rearing your children. Fine, 
quiet, miniature adults versus noisy street-wastrels?

Etc. A bunch of 'WTF' happened in the past 50 years, so pinning it on 
corporations might be a bit too specific.

130 years ago, the Pratt & Whitney company grew faster than, and was larger 
than Microsoft. They made general machine parts, and they specialized in 
rifled barrels and steam and gasoline engine parts.

Advertising of one sort or another had been around for centuries, as had 
corporations - even corporate media. So the corporate thing is probably a red 
herring or if anything a secondary factor in this social change.

  And let's not forget that the world's oldest profession (which includes,
IMO, lawyers and politicians) actually charges money for what other women
give away free! Can you imagine that? And, they've been doing it for
centuries -- millenia, even -- and before the invention of Capitalism.

  My apologies to the rational folks here. I just could not pass up this
opportunity.

When you rn vmware-config it offers you to configure your system so you
can access local filesystems from VMware, and if I remember right, this
means samba. Since I already had samba set up, I did not want it to mess
up the existing configuration, so I told it no, but if you are just
startign with samba, give it a try and see what it really does.

Well you should have.  I sent the original poster a message off list
that I think he needs to be more careful about what he puts on this
list and this proves that I'm more right than I should have been.
For everyone on the list I think the time has come to discuss more
rules for posting as there seems to be a lot of this.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.31.0306171132580.23363-100000@lorien.wv.mentorg.com>

Is anyone running 2.4.21 kernel? I tried it out, because it has several
features I wanted (HPT372 IDE controller support, stable USB2), and one
feature I wanted to try out - supposedly it's much more responsive when
intensive disk I/O takes place.
All features I wanted are as advertized, but later, when I tried to
recompile XFree86, or the kernel itself, the build would fail in strange
ways. It was not the usual compiler sig11 crashes which happen when the
memory fails or CPU overheats. Most often, there were problems in
generated files, like makefiles ("separator missing on line 36"). It was
semi-reproducible, i.e. I could rerun the build several times and few
times it fails in exactly the same place, few times in some other place.

I went back to RedHat's version of 2.4.20 kernel, and several rebuilds of
XFree86 in a row all completed fine.

I think you underestimate the contribution of the Free World. Redhat is
always a little behind in their kernel too - they do not push the bleeding
edge, though they do help stabalize it. I have no qualms with redhat.. They
are a fine distro - for what they are...

They have only been releasing their "high-end server products" for a short
time. No one distribution is more or less stable than others - it is the
packages, the adminstrator, and the amount of time that the administrator
puts into stabalizing/securing the box. I subscribed to kernel-dev for a
time when I had some issues running coda under 2.5.68 (devfs changes were
not ported to the new coda code.) I would say 75%+ were just regular joes
and janes who love the kernel code. Granted, redhat does help with
stabalizing the current-stable kernel...

Well put! (Though I would have to disagree with that statement in regards to
Lindows and SCO, but thats another thread entirely!!!) :-D

Well, if I have offended anyone this badly then I should leave. I
appreciate everyone;s efforts on my behalf, but it's obvious I've been
asking too much. All I'm doing is causing myself grief over this and
offending the people who are trying to work with me. This is
unacceptable behavior on my part.

If I were managing this list, and someone were to come in and cause this
kind of turmoil, I would have no qualms about unsubscribing them without
notice or recourse. As it is, I think I'll just unsubscribe myself. It's
just not worth it for any of us.

  I can share my samba.conf with those who want to see how it's set up to
work with VMware. FWIW, I started using VMware as a beta tester in the
pre-1.0 days; I believe the build numbers were in double digits when I first
put it on. And I've paid for every upgrade since.

  What throws me with every upgrade is finding where the virtual win98 hides
the network setup. Once I'm there, and I enter the IP address and other
information, it works. The wonderfully patient support folks hear from me a
couple of times with each upgrade, then not again until we repeat the cycle.

  If Windows says it cannot find the network, it's probably on it's side of
the divide.

It seems the e1000 driver is written by Intel
and the particular version of the e1000 that you have,
the PRO/1000 CT Desktop, does not seem to be on the list

I'm running it on one of my systems.  No problems encountered that I 
hadn't had before.  It's a gentoo system so YMMV.
I haven't noticed any differences, but it's only been a day and that 
switch was more of a background process...

I had it running on a K12LTSP 3.1.0 (RH9) box last week for about a day. 
I had also applied Con Kolivas' performance patches. It ran fine that 
day, though it was firmly locked up on Monday morning. Don't know 
whether to attribute that to 2.4.21 or the ck6 patches. I'm back on the 
RH kernel now. If'n I get some spare time, I'll try the vanilla 2.4.21.

Michael, get a grip and quit beating yourself.  At least most of the

Dan, I wouldn't be surprised to find that it wasn't either unless the
ck6 patches include the NPTL stuff.  A fairly sizeable portion of RedHat
9 expects NPTL and behaves . . . oddly, if at all, without it.

I don't read in his letter that he's encouraging people to use duplicate
licenses.  His english isn't perfect, of course, and so many
interpretations are available.  But I, personally, think he's just being
defensive because he interepreted your note to be chastising him for
selling used software.  I'm sure people selling used software get all
kinds of attacks from software company goons.

Well, as someone who thinks the term "IP" (not Internet Protocol, of
course) is intended to purposely mislead people into confusing a bargain
between authors and the public (copyright) with realty or personalty, I
think you should buy from the guy and see what you get before you claim
he's some kind of criminal.

How many parallel makes are you running?

I don't know whether or not this relates to your experience or not, but I was 
having the same problem under 2.4.18 a month of so back. I was also using a 
openmosix cluster - in this case, I was compiling with make -j8 and XFree 
(and kde for that matter) did not like parallel comilation. I could compile 
*ANYTHING* else and it would work fine, but Xfree would exhibit the exact 
same symptoms you are describing. I dropped the number of jobs down to -j2 
and it worked fine.

I suspect you're right. The ck patches don't include NPTL. I gave that 
some thought when I set it up, then promptly forgot about it once things 
_seemed_ to be working. As I said, it was fine for about a day w/ just 
me doing "normal user stuff". Do you know what specifically breaks w/o

Maybe the guy is a thief, but not how everyone seems to think.  I would bet 
big bucks that he is not in fact illegally selling VMWare licenses.  He's 
just trying to con some poor sucker into giving him money for a fake license 
key that'll never work.  It's like selling a bag of oregano on the street 
corner.  Who are you going to complain to if your attempted illegal activity 
turns out to be a con?

I have heard reports that the Berkeley DB packages need it and I believe
it, given that I've had a number of issues with RPM when running a
non-RH kernel on my (mostly)RH9 laptop.  Beyond that, I only know of
"general flakiness"

If he's doing anything like what Holger claims, he MAY be doing something

There's nothing misplaced about idealism.  You should always know to what

The Community Cycling Center considered the yellow bikes program a
success.  I do, too.  But it really has NOTHING to do with this thread or
Holger's supposed dilemma.

The problem with all three of your examples, Rich, is that they refer to
real property (personalty, in these cases).  Real property is scarce and
of a finite supply.  Information does not suffer from this terrible
scarcity and the "sharability" is inherent.

To quote Thomas Jefferson:

That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for
the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition,
seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when
she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening
their density at any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move,
and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive
appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of
property.

Or perhaps we're unemployed because the greedy, scum-sucking, filthy
capitalists who employed us are afraid of the market and its natural
result in abundance and destruction of profits and must keep a large
percentage of the population out of work in order to encourage "labor
market flexibility" in order to drive wages down and increase profits at
the expense of the very society the capitalist system was installed to
improve.

The means is serving the minority so well that the ends (prosperity for
the majority) are being put off as long as possible.

I agree with this paragraph completely.  Though I'd say it goes back to
the 1920s, rather than 20 years ago.  (Though the United States is a
strange anomaly wherein nearly every decision from the migration to this
land to westward expansion to the Constitution itself was based on
anti-social ideals.)

And see, I would argue that the Free Software movement and other
institutions of abundance and prosperity are replacing the selfish,
unproductive, anti-social structures of the past.

Theft is the appropriation of personalty.  Information is never owned by
anyone.  However, the public does allow authors the opportunity to control
distribution of their work for a limited time in exchange for the
publication of that work.  It's sort of an attempt to encourage people to
share information that they might want to keep secret.  That deal is
nothing like turning information into property.

And, by the way, my morals (and, by extension, those actions I support and
condemn) have only coincidental relationship with the law.  Whether or not
something is "illegal" is irrelevant to whether or not I support it.

I posted the wrong address for the Clinic (again!) Here's the right one:

                        Riverdale High School 
                       9727 SW Terwilliger Blvd,
                           Portland, Oregon

We meet at the *High School*, not the Grade School. 

Doh! I'm now going to go and delete all references to the Grade School
from my files...

None, unless there is a -j buried somewhere in makefiles. Also, I had some
failures in recompiling a kernel as well, although less frequent (kernel
compiled once out of every two times or so, and XFree I could not compile
in 15 tries). After going back to RH kernel, I recompiled kernel and XFree
a few times, all went fine.

Hi,
    I think I have my kernel ready for install, I just don't know how to do
it ;-) I don't have a monitor hooked up, and everything I have read online
says I need to use LILO to choose my new kernel.. Can someone help me with
this? AIM, ICQ, MSN, YIM, etc?

Thanks,

EMAIL?
first make sure that your system uses lilo and not grub,

for lilo edit /etc/lilo.conf
in the header set
default = newkernel ( or some such name)

and in the section where the new kernel is described,
put 
  label = newkernel

then to install your changes, as root run
lilo

I've done a few rough estimates (rough primarily because of the
variability in timezones and peoples system clocks) on my recent
archive of PLUG mailing list traffic.  This was mostly prompted by the
sense that message frequencies weren't as high as a few years ago and
by Dave Mandel's usual characterization at PLUG meetings of traffic being
around 100/day, which didn't _feel_ right, but I wasn't sure it wasn't
right.  

In the first 5.5 months of 2003, we are averaging 33.1 posts per day.
During the whole of 2002, we averaged about 54.1 posts per day, about
70.2 in the first quarter and 43.2 in the fourth quarter.

So, posting frequency is down about half of what it was last year.

FWIW.

Yes, the e100 and e1000 are both Intel-written drivers.  I like the e100 
better than Becker's.  She grabed RH's updated kernel 2.4.20-18.9 and it 
works just fine.

I am using Debian with LILO as the bootloader. But I don't have a monitor
attached to the server, so I am a little worried. I am going to go install
the packaged kernel (Debian can make it a package, it's awsome - sorry, my
happy rant ;-)) make some changes with LILO and then try it out..

My comment about AIM, etc. was in regards to some personal fast help ;-) If
anyone DOES AIM, I am "sigma2kx" and could still use a bit of compile help!

I would imagine that if you're making a Debian package, the post install
script should handle the lilo changes.

I bounce off of this problem with IBM OSA Express drivers with every
kernel update. Look in /lib/modules/<kernelrev> directory tree for your
previous drivers (normally found in the kernel/drivers/net dir) and cp
them to your new kernels /lib/modules. Once that's done you can rename
the new kernels modules.dep and bounce the install.

Of course if you compiled the kernel with your nic driver static then
this is a waste of time.

I think it might be too late Scott. Looks like PLUG drives yet another
willing Linux opportunity back to Redmond, good work folks, keep up the
vicious harassment - it seems to be working.


"We are a group of enthusiasts dedicated to teaching and learning about
Linux and Unix. There is no membership fee to join. We welcome people of
all levels of experience."

Does this look familiar?

Well put, Mr. Adams.  Unfortunately, it's now a matter of pride for poor
Mr. Hopcroft.  He put the question to us squarely, did we want him here,
and one of us had the audacity to tell him no.  Having put myself in
that position, I wouldn't come back either.

Mr. Hopcroft, if you're lurking out there, I know how you feel.  Don't
let the bastards get you down!

Your a resilient individual Mr. Van Cleve, and one to be highly

None of these jobs is in Portland...  And some of these appear to be temp
agencies.  Move to NY or SF for a temp job ? (Just
curious, what's the reason for posting them here?)

Dear Mike:

I just thought I would forward a little of the dialog on this list 
concerning whoever told you to go away. I do not believe that person is 
representative of the whole.

I've been doing systems programming since 1979 and started using Unix in 
1981. I still have to ask questions of this group and of my friends. I 
know a lot more now than I did then, but there is way to much for anyone 
(including Linus) to hold in their head.

The Linux community is very diverse, ranging from Libertarians to 
Communists, from Fundamentalist Christians and Moslems to Pagan Witches. 
Out of all this diversity, there are going to be people who will flame 
you at the drop of a hat for your stupidity in not knowing exactly what 
they know. Of course, these same playground bullies will roll over and 
play dead if asked questons about things like priority inheritance or 
other subtle real-time programming issues.

So I am asking you to please return. I really, really, really don't like 
the idea that some jerk chased you away and got his bully jollies out of it.

That said, the single most important thing you can learn is *how* to ask 
questions - not just for this group and not just for technology. How to 
frame a question on a subject that you do not yet understand is a tricky 
piece of knowledge that NOBODY knows intuitively. It's a skill learned 
and perhaps you will learn it hanging out on PLUG.

Ron Braithwaite

No genuine reason, I just a hope that someone might be able to make use
of them. Relocation to another area to feed a family is not death, it's
survival (ever live in Boston? It might be nice). I'm only doing what I
can to help - take advantage of them if you want, if not then blow them
off.

Hi all,
Okay I have two problems with my dialup connection.
problem one:

I'm logged in as root and I can start the wvdial but, the routing
table requires me to remove and then add the ppp0 routing every time I
connect. 
How can I fix this to just let me dial up and get the mail/browse?

Problem two:
I can't seem to figure out how to get the USERS the needed privileges
or settings so that they can dial out with out having to be in ROOT to
do so. I have wvdial set so the users can dial with it, but pppd
doesn't start when the handshake is done( it gives it's own signal 2)

Better minds than mine reside here, I'm still reading all the Linux
HOWTO PPP stuff. 
Thanks in advance,
Prutzer

No, no, no...  What's your favorite social, political, and economic theory

We've all heard that FUD recently, I'm still waiting for an argument of
substance on that topic (sort of like waiting for Microsoft to finish
NT3.51 - you know, It'll work in the next revision!). I guess that if I
cared I'd be doing something other than laughing my ass off.

 Perhaps, there is a way to make it work upgrading from Woody to Sarge, 
-then- installing X, but I never figured it out.  I was, however, able to 
reinstall Woody -with- X, then upgrade to Sarge, and X still works. 
 Problem solved - well enough, anyway.

Um, I've never bothered with wvdial on a multiuser system.

The Debian pppconfig includes scripts "pon" and "poff" that dial,
launch pppd, and configure the network all at once, then reverse it all
when you're done.

I have no idea how universal this is.  I haven't used dialup in a long
time, but I just configured a friend's and it was a snap.

This was just a matter of adding each user intended to use the internet to
the dialout group (it should be whoever owns the appropriate serial tty
for the modem).

So tell me. Did you build your computer from environmentally friendly
parts, built in non-polluting factories?

Or do you simply "not participate" when it suites you and buy mass
produced, corporate supporting commodity things when they are fun and
you want them?

If you are wondering where my questions come from, look into how much
waste and pollution is produced during the production of your
motherboard.

I'm remembering a line from the movie, "Family Man". Nick Cage says,
quoting John Lennon, "America is the Roman Empire, and New York is Rome
itself." I watched "Family Man" on TV... How apropos.

Keep in mind that "family" has meant many things in the last few
centuries. A "family" in the 1880's was not "Mom, Dad and the kids".

They say most civilizations last about 2-400 years. We're in that time
frame now. Could we be witnessing the destruction of our own
civilization? The Roman Empire lasted about 400 years.

My question:

Does anyone know the code in question? How old is it?

I know in the past, I remember hearing about IP lawsuits where someone "used a 
patent owned by another company". The judge let the IP become PD because of 
how prolific it's use was. I wish I could remember the case and products I am 
talking about, but it did not have to do with software code.... It was only a 
few years back.

Anyway... In this case, the amount of damage that would be caused by SCO being 
allowed to sue the "entire world" (which is, in a sense, what they are going 
to have to do) would be astronomical. No judge in their right mind would let 
them win. And if they do win, may SCO have mercy on our souls.

One option would be to have the meeting at the Urban Grind - they've got 
a projector built into their place, which is pretty roomy (3000 sq/ft)

Modern File Systems

As this talk was given as additional material for an operating systems
class (my motivation: I was frustrated that all my classmates were
learning about file systems predating 1985) it will touch largely on
structure, theory, and methodology. As such performance characteristics
will be discussed (and are important), but no detailed hard benchmarks
will be provided. Only two file systems will be covered internally (ext2
and WAFL).

The talk is divided into two principle sections: traditional, local file
systems and modern advances; and network-oriented file systems (be
careful -- not network file systems).

As a projector may or may not be present, you might want to at least
glance over the slides from the presentation so as not to squint at my
tiny laptop. I don't feel inclined to drop them from the presentation as
many are fairly visual.

They close at 16:00, but will open late for a guaranteed minimum in
sales, I think.  They'd probably want more lead time, though.

(Actually had this for a while and submitted it to both lists, but as I
heard at one mtg, the moderation queue is woefully unattended.)

Modern File Systems

As this talk was given as additional material for an operating systems
class (my motivation: I was frustrated that all my classmates were
learning about file systems predating 1985) it will touch largely on
structure, theory, and methodology. As such performance characteristics
will be discussed (and are important), but no detailed hard benchmarks
will be provided. Only two file systems will be covered internally (ext2
and WAFL).

The talk is divided into two principle sections: traditional, local file
systems and modern advances; and network-oriented file systems (be
careful -- not network file systems).

As a projector may or may not be present, you might want to at least
glance over the slides from the presentation so as not to squint at my
tiny laptop. I don't feel inclined to drop them from the presentation as
many are fairly visual.

http://www.maybe.net/fs/fs.html

Note that the direction and content of the talk given at Paddy's will
probably vary a fair bit from the slides as presented due to the
different context, interests, and background of both of the audiences.

Subject: [PLUG] Error building Debian 2.4.20 Kernel w/ uml patches
Message-ID: <01C335A5.8380D400.jorgens@coho.net>

Hi all,

I've tried installing all the User Mode Linux stuff, and was able to build 
an image using rootstrap that almost boots, but gives some error messages 
that I won't bother to list because they pretty clearly look like they mean 
my host kernel needed uml patching.

So, I installed the Debian (Sarge/Testing) 2.4.20 kernel source and uml 
patch packages, applied the patch, configured the kernel, then tried to 
make the kernel package using make-kpkg --initrd --revision=2:syarchive.1 
kernel_image.  This failed because of a compile error.

The first error message (all subsequent errors seem to logically follow 
from here) is...
ide-cd.h:44: error: long, short, or unsigned used invalidly for 
'slot_tablelen'

Does anyone know the cause/cure for this error message?

Thanks,

- Steve Jorgensen

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.52.0306181642450.1417@shaft.bitmine.net>

Hi!

I'm putting together a mail/web server for a fellow that runs many
companies.  I've got the DNS and web stuff working dreamily and I'm just
starting to get wrist-deep in the mail.

I think I've got an idea of the features I need to use and I'm hoping to
get some input from the gallery about which specific packages to use for
the mail system.

Remote receiving of mail through IMAP
Remote sending of mail with SMTP Auth (preferably through the passwd
  file, directly or indirectly)
Virtual domains for both

I want this to be fairly straightforward for the users who will likely be
using Outhouse and LookOut Express.

I'll probably end up setting up a Squirrelmail system here for the role
accounts (like customerservice at eachdomain and so on).

So what do y'all use?  My immediate temptation is to go with an
all-courier mail system, but my totally irrational bias against maildir is
holding me back.

At home, I've got sendmail and cyrusIMAP running without a hitch for
several years, but I don't really have remote users with multiple roles.

Any discussion on the topic could be helpful.

Jeme,

I have this system minus the smtp Auth but that is because I have yet to
do that work.  I user Postfix and find that it is easy to add a new domain
and new users.  I have a mix of client users and nobody has complained. 
They mostly are just using POP.  I have set up and use Squirrelmail over
https.  Then I don't need IMAPS.  But that is available.  Have POPS
running also.  Thought about requiring all clients to use that to get the
mail but not sure all clients support that yet.

I thought this was interesting. Hardware support and opening MS application
file seem to be the issues everyone new to Linux points out.

I was thinking this might be an opportunity if someone could re-badge products
that work with Linux to sell at Wal-Mart, i.e build a brand that Wal-Mart
shoppers would associate with Linux or products that are stamped Linux only
like MAC products. I don't know how hard it would be to make a deal with some
printer, scanner, camera, ... manufacturers to OEM equipment, but its seems
like Wal-Mart would want the products. It also seems like it would be possible
to get a couple of pre-agreements from a couple of manufacturers and Wal-Mart
to take to the bank to get financing, hmm, probably not.

Thank you

Get a new modem.

You can find real ones if you look.  Usually for just a few dollars.  Hit
the used bins and the thrift stores.  I got a perfectly good 56k ISA modem
for a friend at the Goodwill near my house for $2.99.

I have this system here with a fairly up to date Debian stable mirror on

Is there any interest in having this thing at the clinic on Saturday for

I'd just like to say that this was one of the better ALT talks I've seen
to date.

It was super informative while not being overly detailed for someone like
me.  I mean, I know what an inode is and when certain block sizes are
better than others and that sort of thing.  I even had a handle on why
some filesystems are prone to fragmentation while others are not, but I
didn't really understand, for example, how one might go about preventing
fragmentation in the filesystem design.

Anyway, it was a great show all around and I'm glad I went.

And I think we should make the bit after the meeting where we test ride
each others' bicycles are more permanent event... at least for the summer
when the even the timid are leaving their cars at home.

Well, considering they've got a 100 Mbit/s connection, it probably
wouldn't buy them that much.  Better yet, take the box to the clinic
and update it there! ;-)

Return it and plunk down the dough for an external modem.  No compatibility
problems with externals.  More expensive but they work all around much
better.

I use sendmail for this, on ports 25 and 587, the latter to support 
folks on networks that prohibit port-25 access to remote hosts. 
(EarthLink has that restriction, iirc).

The sendmail setup is semi-involved, but pretty straightforward:

1. Configure sendmail.cf so that it can handle LOGIN and PLAIN auth 
   mechanisms, knows where your certs are located, and works with an 
   access_db:

   TRUST_AUTH_MECH(`LOGIN PLAIN')dnl
   define(`confAUTH_MECHANISMS', `LOGIN PLAIN')dnl
   define(`confCACERT_PATH',`/usr/share/ssl/certs')dnl
   define(`confCACERT',`/usr/share/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt')dnl
   defaine(`confSERVER_CERT',`/var/local/ssl/certs/your.cert')dnl
   define(`confSERVER_KEY',`/var/local/ssl/certs/your.key')dnl
   FEATURE(`access_db',`hash -T<TMPF> -o /etc/mail/access.db')dnl

   LOGIN and/or PLAIN are your only options if you want to use the 
   system password map (NIS, /etc/passwd, ldap) for SMTP auth. If you 
   configure these mechanisms, then password safety is dependent on 
   wire-level crypto (i.e., SSL).

2. Tell sasl that sendmail will be doing pam-based password checks. 
   Typically, that means /usr/lib/sasl/Sendmail.conf has one line:

   pwcheck_method:pam

3. Configure you sendmail access database to require strong crypto 
   from anywhere but localhost:

   localhost.localdomain           RELAY
   localhost                       RELAY
   127.0.0.1                       RELAY
   TLS_Clt:                        ENCR:128

That's worked really well for me.

Mr. Van Cleve,

This message was sent to the PLUG group in response to a request for info
about Popfile (a perl-based, Bayesian method mail filtering/classification
program (http://popfile.sourceforge.net), but it appears that Mr. Ouelette
may have inadvertently removed the subject line from his reply to my reply
to his question, resulting in the complete lack of any subject for this
message that actually proffers some context by which to understand the
communications that are being employed to discuss this subject.

Does that make it clearer? :P

Subject: [PLUG] HB 2892: Forwarded Message
Message-ID: <1056053659.15414.155.camel@sparticus.coopnkass.com>

Honorable Representative Minnis;


I am writing today to express my deepest concern over the events
surrounding HB 2892, the Open Source Consideration Bill. 

The truth is, Representative, that it is very difficult in Oregon to get
Open Source related work. The Information Technology playing field in
Oregon-despite what Jim Craven with the AeA and other lobbyists may tell
you-is not level.

Moreover, HB 2892 does not seek to give preferential treatment to one
type of software over another; it simply requires the consideration of
Open Source Software. This is due primarily because Oregon's Request For
Procurement (RFP) system only considers established vendors. Open Source
applications that can often do the job as well or better than their
proprietary counterparts is sometimes not represented by any one vendor.
Thus, Open Source Software is not considered by those other than the
most technologically savvy Oregon IT departments.

I know from my familiarity with the DOJ v. Microsoft anti-trust trial
that Oregon's computer OEM's such as Intel and Hewlett Packard do not
wish to speak out on these types of issues for fear of retribution from
their primary software vendor. The software vendor can and has
threatened to pull support for a hardware platform. That would all but
devastate a hardware manufacturer's business model. As one industry
executive put it, "it's like being treated like a [bad] step child."

Steve McGeady, the former CEO for Intel, testified for the DOJ that
Intel's support of competing technologies (Netscape and Java) often put
them in hot water with their neighbors in Redmond. McGeady told the
court that in one 1995 meeting "Bill made it very clear that Microsoft
would not support our next processor offerings if we did not get
alignment"-on platform software-a threat that McGeady described as "both
credible and fairly terrifying." 

My guess is that Jim Craven didn't tell you that. I share this knowledge
to impress upon you that this industry is definitely anything but a
level playing field; as evidence contrary to what the lobbyists have
told you.

It is clear through submitted written and oral testimony during
committee as well as independent analysis and case history reports
worldwide that Open Source software can dramatically reduce the total
cost of ownership for State IT agencies.

There are many ways Open Source Software can help Oregon's government
perform it's duties. Try to imagine what effect a completely open and
secure IT system would have for the 911 consolidation project or for
benefit dispersement programs.

Because Open Source Software is superior in many cases, and because it
is known that OSS is effective in saving taxpayer dollars, I can only
conclude that there must be some other reason why a Republican would
want this bill killed.

The following are two links referencing contributions made to your
election campaign in PDF (Adobe Acrobat) format. I am not familiar with
all of the companies listed in the documents. I am releasing these
documents in the hope that someone may be able to shed some light on why
you seem to want this bill killed:

  http://www.mwvlug.org/legislation/oregon/rep_minnis.pdf
  
  http://www.mwvlug.org/legislation/oregon/rep_minnis_1.pdf


Please note that I made several sincere attempts to contact your office
of which I received only one call with a promise to speak with a member
of your staff, of which never materialized.

Representive Minnis, this bill is just as much about Oregon jobs as it
is about saving the taxpayer millions of dollars. It's frustrating to
have had the experience running computer systems worth millions; knowing
that Open Source Software is a better solution in many cases than
proprietary software. And yet have to face the reality that the market
is controlled by a monopoly; a monopoly who has made the process of
killing superior technology a science through illegal business
practices. This trend continues as new concerns are raised over the
terms of the DOJ v. Microsoft settlement.

I am simply at a loss why you seem to pander to out-of-state lobbyists
while ignoring hard working and skilled Oregonians who do not have jobs.

This bill as amended is a worthy bill and should pass, or at very least
be allowed to take it's due course. I urge your reconsideration in this
matter.


Very Truly Yours,


Cooper Stevenson

This is a mystery.  My two year old can sit down and completely lock up
my Linux box with a few keystrokes.  I'm assured she is only there for a
minute and this is probably true.  When I got home, there was an xterm
up with the string "  n   " on it.  Everything else was locked up.  No
keyboard, no mouse, no sshing in from a different machine, nothing.
Only option was a reboot.  Not good after my preaching about power,
reliability, and robustness.

So, what did she do?  If you had a few seconds to completely disable a
Linux system how would you do it?  Probably only with keystrokes and
not lgged in as root.  This has happened several times.

Me, personally, I'd hit the big red switch or the reset button.  If
the box is on the floor within reach, they are a severe temptation.

Good.  The first step to debugging most problems is repeatability.
Have your little girl show you how.  Video tape it if you have to, so
you can go back frame by frame and reconstruct what happened.

Said he couldn't ssh into it, but I'd like to know if it's ping-able or
not.  The best way I know of to quickly "hang" a Linux box is to
convince the X server to consume all of your available resources (or, at
the very least, all of the CPU for a good long while).  Sadly, this
isn't always difficult to do on accident, but I seem to have a good deal
of trouble doing it on purpose ;-)

What do the logs say? Specifically bashrc - does it record long enough to show 
her particular keystrokes?

While doing help desk, I always encountered at least one "anti-computer" 
person: i.e. she had negative computer energy, or something. She fried a half 
dozen motherboards. Her computer locked up more frequently than anyone elses 
by 10 to 1. I gave her MY system, which had been rock solid - sure enough, 
within a day, it had locked up 3 times. She would also seem to burn out a ton 
of lights (when turned on by her) and she claimed that street lights would 
turn off whenever she came near.

Perhaps your daughter has this "negative computer energy"?? Scary! Lock the 
server room, quick!!! hahah!

Sorry - I guess I should have read the details a little more closely. He did
indeed say he couldn't access it over the network. My bad.

Said he couldn't ssh into it, but I'd like to know if it's ping-able or
not.  The best way I know of to quickly "hang" a Linux box is to
convince the X server to consume all of your available resources (or, at
the very least, all of the CPU for a good long while).  Sadly, this
isn't always difficult to do on accident, but I seem to have a good deal
of trouble doing it on purpose ;-)

There has been video card / xfree86 driver combinations in the past where
if you try to abruptly exit X windows (say via ctl-alt-backspace) the
video hardware isn't reset correctly back into "normal" mode.  You
could end up with garbage; the screen previous to hitting ctl-alt-bsp,
etc.

I don't know if this is still true with any current hardware, or with the
hardware of the person who's kid locks up his system...

One thing that might be worth checking is, after power-cycling the
machine, boot into single user mode and check /var/log/messages and
/var/log/XFree86.0.log (you can do it without booting into single user,
but it makes finding the "most recent messages prior to rebooting"
*slightly* more difficult to find) and see if there are any telltale
kernel messages in /var/log/messages or (less likely) '(EE)' lines in
/var/log/XFree86.0.log

This is a mystery.  My two year old can sit down and completely lock up
my Linux box with a few keystrokes.  I'm assured she is only there for a
minute and this is probably true.  When I got home, there was an xterm
up with the string "  n   " on it.  Everything else was locked up.  No
keyboard, no mouse, no sshing in from a different machine, nothing.
Only option was a reboot.  Not good after my preaching about power,
reliability, and robustness.

So, what did she do?  If you had a few seconds to completely disable a
Linux system how would you do it?  Probably only with keystrokes and
not lgged in as root.  This has happened several times.

Honorable Representative Minnis;

I am writing today to express my deepest concern over the events
surrounding HB 2892, the Open Source Consideration Bill. 

The truth is, Representative, that it is very difficult in Oregon to get
Open Source related work. The Information Technology playing field in
Oregon-despite what Jim Craven with the AeA and other lobbyists may tell
you-is not level.

Moreover, HB 2892 does not seek to give preferential treatment to one
type of software over another; it simply requires the consideration of
Open Source Software. This is due primarily because Oregon's Request For
Procurement (RFP) system only considers established vendors. Open Source
applications that can often do the job as well or better than their
proprietary counterparts is sometimes not represented by any one vendor.
Thus, Open Source Software is not considered by those other than the
most technologically savvy Oregon IT departments.

I know from my familiarity with the DOJ v. Microsoft anti-trust trial
that Oregon's computer OEM's such as Intel and Hewlett Packard do not
wish to speak out on these types of issues for fear of retribution from
their primary software vendor. The software vendor can and has
threatened to pull support for a hardware platform. That would all but
devastate a hardware manufacturer's business model. As one industry
executive put it, "it's like being treated like a [bad] step child."

Steve McGeady, the former CEO for Intel, testified for the DOJ that
Intel's support of competing technologies (Netscape and Java) often put
them in hot water with their neighbors in Redmond. McGeady told the
court that in one 1995 meeting "Bill made it very clear that Microsoft
would not support our next processor offerings if we did not get
alignment"-on platform software-a threat that McGeady described as "both
credible and fairly terrifying." 

My guess is that Jim Craven didn't tell you that. I share this knowledge
to impress upon you that this industry is definitely anything but a
level playing field; as evidence contrary to what the lobbyists have
told you.

It is clear through submitted written and oral testimony during
committee as well as independent analysis and case history reports
worldwide that Open Source software can dramatically reduce the total
cost of ownership for State IT agencies.

There are many ways Open Source Software can help Oregon's government
perform it's duties. Try to imagine what effect a completely open and
secure IT system would have for the 911 consolidation project or for
benefit dispersement programs.

Because Open Source Software is superior in many cases, and because it
is known that OSS is effective in saving taxpayer dollars, I can only
conclude that there must be some other reason why a Republican would
want this bill killed.

The following are two links referencing contributions made to your
election campaign in PDF (Adobe Acrobat) format. I am not familiar with
all of the companies listed in the documents. I am releasing these
documents in the hope that someone may be able to shed some light on why
you seem to want this bill killed:

  http://www.mwvlug.org/legislation/oregon/rep_minnis.pdf
  
  http://www.mwvlug.org/legislation/oregon/rep_minnis_1.pdf


Please note that I made several sincere attempts to contact your office
of which I received only one call with a promise to speak with a member
of your staff, of which never materialized.

Representive Minnis, this bill is just as much about Oregon jobs as it
is about saving the taxpayer millions of dollars. It's frustrating to
have had the experience running computer systems worth millions; knowing
that Open Source Software is a better solution in many cases than
proprietary software. And yet have to face the reality that the market
is controlled by a monopoly; a monopoly who has made the process of
killing superior technology a science through illegal business
practices. This trend continues as new concerns are raised over the
terms of the DOJ v. Microsoft settlement.

I am simply at a loss why you seem to pander to out-of-state lobbyists
while ignoring hard working and skilled Oregonians who do not have jobs.

This bill as amended is a worthy bill and should pass, or at very least
be allowed to take it's due course. I urge your reconsideration in this
matter.


Very Truly Yours,


Cooper Stevenson

Yeah, I suppose this is still true. Here Intel is funding the RedHat 
start up and then chipping in for the $24 million Open Source 
Development Lab. Yet their quite on this - do you suppose they know that 
the AeA's lobbyist is one of the heavies whose sitting on this thing? 
Any Intel people out there care to comment?

Egads, they scanned the damn things. Well, you can't grep a dead expense 
account I guess. I did leaf through and spot Phillip Morris giving her

Every time I email her she's very prompt with a reply: "Thank you for

Okay, conspiracy theory time...

The Echelon network should have picked this up about 15 minutes ago,
which means that it's already in the hands of the FBI.  A few
hours from now, it will be in hands of the President's press core,
who will then make the following press release:

Ladies and Gentlemen, we have found the weapons of mass destruction
in Iraq, but in a way we thought even beyond the cruel, inhuman
rule of Saddam Hussein.

[Flash to picture of a smiling baby]

The mobile laboratories were not for creating viruses and deadly
plagues, there were actually for genetically manipulating innocent
babies.

[Flash to picture of rows of test tubes]

[Fade to picture of rows of cribs with babies]

These babies have been programmed to destroy technology.  When they see
it, their programming takes over and they implement preset
intructions based on the type of technology such as:

1) Inserting peanut butter and jelly sandwiches into VCRs and DVD players.
2) Sticking their fingers into electrical sockets, shorting out the
   local neighborhood power grids.

One child has even been reported to be able to disable computers running
the vaunted Linux operating system.  It's immune to viruses, but these
children can disable the most hardened Linux box within seconds.  There
are no confirmed reports of Microsoft Windows being vulnerable to
these children.

[Flash to picture of money changing hands]

As a side effect, they produce noxious substances that necessitate
filling our landfills with plastic and chemicals {What, they did that
before?  Well, it still stinks!}

Their master plan was to fill orphanages with these children, and then,
taking advantage of the charity and mercy of American parents, and the
President's new faith-based initiative, to have them be adopted into
loving homes in the United States, where they would wreak their havoc.

[Picture of the lights turning out in Wall Street in mid-trade]

[Picture of massive grid-lock]

We believe that we have identified many of the altered children
and our scientists are working to see if the programming can be
undone.

This very well could be the placement of her system.  My parents were
flying through computer components and had serious lock-ups all the
time... turned out their computer was kept on the other side of the wall
from the power conduit into the house.  They moved the computer and
didn't have another problem of that sort.

I've also fixed many a problem with folks' monitors that were just in the
wrong part of the room.  One woman sent back three monitors as defective
when it was discovered to just be some magnetic interference and moving
her desk fixed it.  (Though, to her credit, the monitors were damaged
enough to have visible display problems even when moved after a couple of
weeks' operation in the evil zone.)

Street lights turn off all the time and some people notice it and others
don't.  There are people who say they've never seen a streetlight turn off
and others who say they turn off whenever they're around (which isn't at
all reproducible).

I had a friend in school who couldn't handle magnetic media of any kind.
Audio cassettes, floppy disks, and other things would degrade more quickly
in his possession than with other people.  He had to copy his audio
cassettes every few weeks (from originals he kept in the basement and
handled only at copying time) and could GUARANTEE the corruption of a
floppy disk carried in his pocket from the computer lab to his home.  So
maybe there's something to the lightbulb thing, too.

I don't think I ever noticed it until I read "The Long Dark Tea-Time of

Intel came out against an almost identical piece of legislation in the
Texas Senate. If they're really stoked about funding Red Hat and the
OSDL, why did they do this?

She said during a town hall gathering that the bill did not go to work
session because it had missed a work session deadline. Technically
that's true, but the deadline was missed because she ordered the work
session cancelled.

I scanned hers and other Representative's campaign contribution reports.

If you have a KVM switch with a spare port, you might consider switching
keyboard and mouse to the vacant port while the little one is around.
This will rule-out whether it's the kid's keyboard action or the kid's
mere presence that's hurting your PC.

Actually, proper punctuation and grammar would've helped. It would either
be:

Baby is killing Linux

or

Baby-killing Linux

Although I rather like the ambiguity of the subject...

Go figger.

So, Linux is killing babies now. I'm visualizing the MS P.R. dept when

Ain't English great. I'm not multilingual. Can phrases can be interpreted

Yes.  Actually, it even seems that things like "garden path" sentences
exist in every language.

A garden path sentence is one that cannot be parsed normally because the
word choice leads to a premature parsing of the sentence which assigns
meanings not applicable to the actual sentence stated.  These sentences
are perfectly grammatical, but totally unusable.

Two of my personal favorites:

The old man the boat.
The horse ran past the barn fell.

You scanned them? Hmmmmm. If we could get a character recognition 
program to put it into a computer readable format, then we could claim 
to have grepped a dead tree, right?

d

ps by the way, the Oregon Freedom of Information Act explicitly states 
that if information is available in a convenient format, it has to be 
given away in that format.

: Yes.  Actually, it even seems that things like "garden path" sentences
: exist in every language.

In Japanese, where individual syllables can be represented by many characters 
(about 34 characters are pronounced 'sei,' for example)  many two-character 
words have unrelated homophones. Thus there is a habit of tracing the 
characters, using the right hand as if writing on the palm of the left, in 
spots where confusion might occur. This habit can become so autonomic that 
you can see people doing it while on the phone. 

: Two of my personal favorites:
:
: The old man the boat.
: The horse ran past the barn fell.

Reminds me of Penn-Dutch country, where you can hear gems like: "Throw the 
horse over the fence some hay."

You can also have fun with mixed modifiers, such as the 'giant tire sale.'

My current favorite in this genre is the Papa Murphy's commercial that
names one of their products the "large children's favorite" pizza. I
wonder if little kids prefer a different flavor.

Or, "Amos stung his toe with a bee."  But these are just quaint
ambiguities, whereas Baby Killing Linux is likely to offend someone. If
Linux is to have any mass appeal, we're simply going to need better
names for distro's.  ("Slackware" and "Woody" are bad enough.)

Subject: [PLUG] problem changing local domain name
Message-ID: <3EF24ED2.4000409@pobox.com>

This is more of an admin question but there is no admin list, so I am 
posting it here.

Way back when I originally installed Linux on my system, I set it up 
with the host name 'myhost.testdomain'.  Now I am learning to set up 
BIND and want to change my domain and host names to something that makes 
more sense.  Since my machine uses the hosts file to resolve local host 
names, I thought I could simply change the information in hosts and it 
would work.  Not so.  After I did that, I could no longer get to the 
graphical login screen that I always use to login to KDE, I can only log 
in in text mode.  And after I logged in in text mode, I ran the hostname 
command and it showed the old host name, not the new one that I changed 
it to.  I changed my hosts file back to the way it was and logged in 
again and it sends me to the graphical login screen again.  I did this 
several times.  I tried changing /etc/sysconfig/network too but it made 
no difference.

So my main question is: Where does the hostname command get its 
information?  Not entirely from the hosts file.  But from where?

And when I log in, there is something that must compare the information 
in the hosts file with some information stored somewhere else (where?), 
and if the information is different then it forces me to log in in text 
mode.  What is it comparing hosts to?  (Probably the same information 
that the hostname command uses to get its information, I just can't find 
it.)

The main thing I need to do is figure out how to change my local domain 
and host names properly.  Does anyone know how to do this?  I can't 
really start experimenting with BIND until I get my domain and host 
names set up correctly.


What else can I tell you?
I am using Red Hat 7.3.
I am using a static IP address on my local network which is set up 
behind a gateway router.
I have full Internet access the way my system is currently set up.

The 'hostname' command will change the name for the running system.  For
example, 'hostname foo.bar.com'
If you want this change to last a reboot, then you should edit
/etc/sysconfig/network and /etc/hosts, which are read by the various
scripts and daemons when the system starts up.

This line is a comment in the /etc/init.d/bind9 file on my Debian box. 
It is referring to the OPTIONS="" (it is empty on mine anyway) variable
below the comment.

There is also a line:

# Don't modify this line, change or create /etc/default/bind9.

Which means my system loads OPTIONS from /etc/default/bind9, which has
in it the text:

OPTIONS="-u bind"

So, Bind9 runs as the user "bind" in a chroot environment on my system.

I used this laptop for nearly a year and it worked really well for me,
even running RH 8 decently.

There is only one thing that is not up to snuff and that is the screen. If
the laptop is put to sleep and then awakened the screen has a neat pink
tint to it that gradually fades. When the screen is warmed up there is
only the slightest
bit of tint in the upper right corner.

Here are the specs:

IBM Thinkpad 600
266Mhz Pentium Processor
256Mb RAM
4Gb HD
CD-ROM
Floppy
One year old battery

and two spare 32Mb sticks o' RAM

I'm asking $250 for it.

Please email me personally if you are interested.

I took my son to work one day (he was then two) and he was running around the 
office, while I was fiddling with my Sun workstation.  I noticed he was 
playing with the workstation of one of the other admins who had left the 
company recently.  Anyway before I left I pinged the workstation and it 
responded so we left.

Two days later at work our sendmail admin (Dan Haskell) noticed that our 
server load was growing out of control.  He reset it and we went home.  Next 
day we looked again and it was still out of control.  So we went and looked 
at some ORCA graphs and correlated the change in sendmail behavior to 
Saturday afternoon when I was in the office with my son.  Turns out he must 
have hit the power button just so to upset the OS but not enough to reboot 
it.  It was still reponding to pings and other stuff but ssh and sendmail was 
down which was causing our sendmail server to hang as it was trying to spool 
mail onto the workstation.

Might not be keyboard activities is my point.

Well,,

All questions are good....

I am running it as -u nobody etc etc.. 

And now that you point out the obvious....  8^|

The line is directly from the bind9 executable
in /etc/init.d/bind9

Having said that.

Wouldn't be the first time that an error had
been in a file.....

I will give it a shot and get back to you.

Thanks for the feed back.  8^)

OK.....

I also am running Debian

But, I have nothing in my OPTIONS.

And there is no  user bind.

No wonder I am confused..

Hi
 
Red Hat 9.0 killed the sound in my tux racer demo.  Has anyone else had this happen?  Anyone know how to fix the sound?  
 
Sound works for everything else.
 
Thanks

Ok, here's the deal. you have to set up rndc now. It uses keys and stuff 
so that you can do things remotely (without ssh'ing in). Time to read 
the bind9 docs :)

using ndc reload is probably trying to muck with a previous version of bind.

Hi,
    I am trying to figure out where to put my server for co-lo. I am
currently looking at a rack in Texas, because they are much cheaper. I need
between120GB/month to 200GB/month of transfer, and my current quotes have
been between $799 and $1250 for Portland-based locations. I have found one
for $250, but they don't reply to emails, which is always a concern.. If
anyone can help with where to go to look for a co-lo, please post!!

Maybe you need to use simpler DNS software
that allows you to capitalize on your current
skills.

BIND8 still works well as long as you run it
as either an authority server or a cache - not
both. Few of us really need the features of
BIND9. For example, do you really need a
BIND-specific, secure protocol (rndc) to your
remote DNS daemon when you already know how to
use SSH?

The djbdns software is also simpler though it
may not seem so at first.

If it's rackspace.com, you need to know that their IP
addresses are on many blacklists. You can use them as
long as you don't want to send mail from there.

I use SprocketData(.com), which was recommended by this very list.  They 
too have a way of dragging their feet and not paying close attention to 
emails, plus their internal DNS servers keep cutting out for short 
intervals, so they're not perfect.  But they're cheap, flexible and 
Linux-friendly.

Have you checked out serverbeach.com?  I have no idea if they suck or
not but they have a halfway decent Linux boxes with 450GB of traffic for
$119/month, or a less than halfway decent box for $99/month.  You don't
own the machine, but you do get root on the box and can do whatever you
please with it (within their TOS).

I just was looking over at their pricings and what not, and DAMN! $150 for
only 30GB trans? I asked for a quote for 130GB of transfer, and I'm nore
sure I want to see it ;-)

Because many of their customers are spammers and
they won't work with the folks who maintain black
lists. If you ask them what IP address range one of
their spammer customers use, they won't tell you.
So, you block an entire /24 at a time. I'm blocking
many of their /24s.

I'm not sure what their quotes are for that kind of bandwidth, but I
use Sterling for co-lo for my server:

I always get same day, if not same-hour support from these guys.
They're top notch.

  The irony here is that Linux Journal's Web site is hosted by rackspace.
But, I don't believe their e-mail goes through there.

I was looking at opening a tertiary location here in Portland a while 
ago, and did some non-exhaustive surveys of co-lo providers in the 
area.

These are Portland-based services:

SpireTech
http://www.spiretech.com/shared_colocation.htm
$100/mo for 100g
- make sure you understand what kind of A/C power you're buying


FORTiX
http://www.fortix.net/
- very responsive sales team
- were willing to work with me on pricing


Inherent
http://www.Inherent.com/
- by far the most expensive I had quotes from


Synapse Global
http://www.synapseglobal.com/colocation/index.htm



Due to various external reasons, I decided to stick with my 
non-Portland West coast provider, which was Hurricane Electric. 
Their $500/mo for a full rack _and_ 256kbps (~80gb) of traffic is a 
hard number to beat, though their location in Fremont, CA is 
difficult to service on a regular basis.  (Hey, I've got some space 
left over, if for $25/mo anyone needs space for a 1u machine that 
consumes less than ~2gb per month - perfect for personal email, DNS, 
or authentication servers)

That's who I have been talking to. $799/mo for 200GB with them. I really
like the people who run it tho, they are nice and helpful!

As long as we're on the subject of local services, are there any local
shops for hard drive recovery?  I have a Seagate hard drive that
absolutely refuses to mount, and along with the strange ticking sound
that it makes convinces me that the drive is damaged.

Thanks,

Before you spend a fortune, try this ridiculous method:

Wrap the drive in a towel, then put it in a plastic bag and put it in the
freezer.  Wait until it's frozen cold (three or so hours in my freezer),
then try to hook it up.

You might get one good mount out of the thing and save your data.

I've heard various people attempt to explain why this works, but nothing
too concrete.  Anecdotal, I've saved two drives of data this way and I've
read dozens of other stories.

Data recovery is exhorbitantly costly.

Colin,

  There was a fellow to whom I took a drive about 7 years ago. I don't know
if he's still in business, and that was a DOS drive, too. he recovered about
85-90% but it was terribly expensive -- about $300, IIRC. However, since it
held business data I had to get what I could from it.

  Unfortunately, I've no recollection of how I found him.

"It's very unfortunate for him because of those comments he made."

- Andy Woolley of Milonic software comments about the discovery that
Senator Orrin Hatch's official website uses an unlicensed copy of his
company's software. On Tuesday, Hatch surprised a Senate hearing on
copyright issues by saying that technology should be developed to
remotely destroy the computers of people who illegally download
copyrighted material from the Internet. A spokesman in Hatch's office,
when told of the illegal software, simply said "That's ironic." Woolley
claims that his software is being used illegally by at least two other
senators, and many big companies including Continental Airlines. [It
boggles the mind to think about Continental Airline's computers being
destroyed by Hatch's proposed software.]

Where ever you go get your wallet out.  Many years ago I sent a 20 MByte
IOMega Bernoulli cartridge in to be recovered.  Cost ... $300.00.  This to
take the disk loose from the center mount/hub/spindle and re-mount it to a
new hub/spindle/thingy.  From your description it sounds like a seriously
broken drive.

   Got backup?  :-)

Sorry to be a bit off-topic, as this is not a recommendation for 
Portland-based disk-recovery services.

$300 is actually extremely reasonable, depending on your 
circumstances.  I have paid $1500 for a 2g SCSI drive, and once paid 
$15,000 to recover two RAID'ed SCSI drives with an entire company's 
customer/installation/billng database on it, which of course, was not 
backed up.  It failed on the day before Thanksgiving, around 16:30, 
and we were back on line the next business morning with 30 minutes to 
spare.  That involved hand-delivering the drives to the airport and 
charging <gulp> the full $15,000 on the corporate AmEx of the CEO, 
and needless to say I did not have a particularly thankful 
Thanksgiving as I managed the recovery folks and the sysadmins to put 
things together again.  However, we were four weeks away from IPO, 
and a $15k pricetag was extremely small in comparison to the company 
shutting down as we went into the final stages of the public 
offering.  The sysadmin was not fired, amazingly enough, despite my 
screaming at the Ops manager.  It's all relative, I suppose.  In any 
case, I'd be very happy with a $300 disk recovery under any 
circumstances if you're talking to someone with a cleanroom and full 
diag capability and not just someone with an IDE sector tool in their 
garage.

I used OnTrack (http://www.ontrack.com/) and have been enthusiastic 
about my service through them, though they are very expensive.  They 
have recovered Mac, SunOS, and Windows disks for me and/or my staff, 
and they have a 99% data recovery record.

As another side note: if you have two older drives of the same type, 
one working and one not working you can do a triage recovery 
(sometimes) if you're particularly adept with a screwdriver and have 
a room that is exceptionally dust-free.  Move platters from one drive 
to the other - not for the weak of heart or shaky of hand.  Newer 
drives probably are hermetically sealed; I haven't tried that trick 
in many years, but I've done it on many laptop drives and they lived 
long enough to get the data off them into some other form.

Here's the whole story:

The machine in question is a lab machine for data acquisition, serial
port and parallel port interfaces to digital sections of chips,
GPIB for analog stimulus and measurement.

Over last weekend, both drives, the small 3 Gb holding the OS and the
large 40 Gb holding user directories, failed.  Now, the good news is
all collected data and software and tools are under version control
where the repository is NFS mounted from a NetApp, and that's backed up
regularly.   So what we really lost were our Linux dot-files and the
high scores for KAsteroids.

If there was a local place that was cheap, then I'd consider getting
a quote but no one has suggested particular places, just warnings
(that I greatly appreciate) about cost.  I'll hit the YP.

  All these problems would go away with open source software, no? Then
software piracy would be much less of an issue.

To some extent... maybe.

However, all of these problems would surely go away with Free Software,
yes.  Then "software piracy" would once again be recognized as the
nonsense phrase it is.

They offer power that is:

a) Not backed up at all
b) Backed up by generator
c) Backed up by generator and UPS

They charge differently for each.

You ain't whistlin' Dixie.  When my primary HD crashed a few weeks ago,
I made a call and was told $100 for an eval', then $1500-$2500 for the
actual recovery.  I let the drive cool overnight, popped it in the next
day, got a mount, and ended up replacing the whole system on another
drive.  It was like putting Humpty Dumpty back together again.

Same problem here.  Appears to be a build error on Red Hat's part:

    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=85466

I have not tried to fix it by rebuilding, but that appears to be the
"solution".

I use it, but the company I work for bought the license for me. It's nice
if you have a Windows application which does not run under Wine and for
which there is no adequate Linux replacement (for example, Photoshop).
They used to have a license for personal use at only $99, but it's no
longer offered. Would I pay $280 myself for it? Probably not. There is
Win4Lin which runs the same Photoshop, and sells for under $100 (VMware is
better, it runs Win2K, and other Linuxes, and pretty much any guest OS you
want, while Win4Lin runs only Win98/ME). But for $280 I'd probably
dual-boot if I had to :)

Steve,

  I'm not sure I know just what you're asking. I have vmware installed here
because my legacy GIS application and my GPS mission planning/differential
correction software run only on Microsoft. Is it worth it to me? Yup.

  I started with the pre-1.0 beta versions (I think the build number was in
two digits) and I've paid for upgrades for each major release. Because of
vmware I don't need another box running Microsoft and I don't need to dual
boot. I can transfer data back and forth via samba and my two apps are there
when I need them. Otherwise, they just take up a 2G partition on one of the
hard drives.

Thanks Fedor,
I have some communications software that I need to run to work with an
old, legacy, VPN suite. Right now I am on dual-boot but it's a pain in
the butt. Now I have the 30 day eval from vmware but I think it's going
to be a hard sell for me to justify the 279.

I'm just asking if those that use it like and rely on it enough to pay
the price. Unfortunately, the one piece of software that I have that
requires it needs Win2k and I'm tired of the dual-boot.

There might be a couple of other options, but probably would take a lot
more work to setup: bochs ( http://bochs.sourceforge.net/ ) and plex86
( http://plex86.sourceforge.net/ ).  Both are are open source (GPL, LGPL)

bochs wasn't being maintained for a few years, but I notice from looking
at the web page just now that there have been a couple of releases this year,
so it appears to be ative again.  bochs, is an x86 emulator, so it's gonna
be slow.

plex86 is closer to what VMWare does, so it'll be the faster of the two.
As I recall, the plex86 developer was complaining a while back about
VMWare stealing ideas from plex86.  Apparently to run Windoze with plex86
you need to run it in combination with bochs - see the web page for more
details.

The work doesn't bother me in the least but paying the money for VMWare
does :)

Speed to windows usually means that it crashes faster anyway.

Excellent! I looked for Bochs yesterday and had a rough time finding my
way to the site. I'll do a little reading and see what shakes out.

Subject: [PLUG] uml probs - networking and skas 2.4.20 kernel
Message-ID: <01C33798.E0E18AA0.jorgens@coho.net>

Hi,

Ok, on Debian Sarge (Testing), I got the user-mode-linux stuff installed, 
built an umage using rootstrap (first try failed w/ ext3, but works setting 
up ext2), and with the help of a friend, got it to actually load and run 
the image (contrary to the help, one must specify ubd0=<image>), but I 
still have a few problems, issues, and questions.


1.  Networking (besides lo) doesn't work.  During the startup process, the 
uml says...
Configuring network interfaces... SOICSIFADDR: No such device
eth0: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device
SOICSIFADDR: No such device
eth0: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device
done.

2.  For good uml performace, I have been trying to build a new host kernel 
with the skas patch, but I can't seem to get the Debian Kernel 2.4.20 
package to build.  From the very little I'm finding on th the Web about the 
errors I'm getting, these look like bugs with 2.4.20 building under gcc 
3.3.  Does anyone know how to fix or get around this besides waiting for a 
Sarge 2.4.21 package or trying to make do with a stock Kernel instead of an 
official Debian-patched one?

3.  It looks like either uml in general, or the way this one is configured 
expects to run under X.  If I run it from a text console, then ps -A shows 
a whole bunch of "linux" processes attached to the tty.  I presume these 
correspond to the Virtual Console windows I get if I do run uml from a 
terminal in X.  This is supposed to be a server box, running on less than 
state-of-the-art hardware, so I was hoping to not run X on it at all during 
normal operation, but I can see how I would likely want virtual consoles 
within my uml sessions from time to time.  What are other folks doing with 
this?

Thanks for any help y'all can offer,

- Steve Jorgensen

I just thought to actually look up the module that failed to see what it 
was and whether I even needed it.  It's a Madge ATM card that I don't need 
and never will need, so I'm trying the kernel build now with that module 
simply excluded.  Of something else could be broken farther along, but I 
bet that gets me past the problem I was just asking about (we'll see - in a 
while - the kernel's building now at 200MHz).

A number of PLUG folks for have using this hack for some time. A quick

I guess the Oregonian printed an editorial detailing the money that's

bought off way too cheaply. If you believe, like I do, that Oregon is 
becoming a Center of Gravity for Open Source/ Free Software, then 
eventually folks like Karen Minnis are going to realize they're on the

Please keep in mind what Hatch was discussing at the time he made those

He wasn't referring to software.  So unless OpenSource Movies are just around 
the corner, I don't think this issue will be going away.

The uml kernel will load a file named "root_fs" if it is present in the

There a few pieces that need to be in place for this to work.  What

By default, uml will only load with an X-server capable of spawning
xterm windows.  This behavior can be modified with start up parameters. 
Here is one of my startup lines.

linux eth0=tuntap,,,192.168.2.5 con=port:9000 con1=tty:/dev/tty11 con0=tty:/dev/tty12

This one sets up console login on localhost port 9000 for all consoles
except the first two, which go to tty11 and tty12 on the host.  X is not
required for this work.

Ah, it mist be called root_fs.  I'm sure I read that, and then blithely 
wondered why it didn't magically find and load test-uml.img.

Before I ran rootstrap, I set the following in the [rootstrap] section of 
/etc/rootstrap/rootstrap.conf:
interface=eth0
transport=tuntap
host=192.168.2.3
uml=192.168.2.4
netmask=255.255.255.248
gateway=192.168.2.1
domain=syhome.local
nameserver=192.168.2.2

According to instructions for proxy arp setup (I'll be wanting to run the 
switch daemon later, but thought I'd try this first), I set the host 
address to be the same as the ip address of eth0 on the host.

I''m not sure what you're saying on this.  Are you using the skas patch? 
 If so, what Debian version are you running, and which kernel source 
package did you grab?

I didn't think that was supposed to be necessary since I put the network 
settings into /etc/rootstrap/rootstrap.conf (which include an entry for 
host ip address) before I built the uml image.  What are these settings for 
if you have to enter it again on the uml command line?  Is there soemthing 
I'm not understanding about that?

> ubd0=deb2.cow,deb2.img

Yeah, I'm anxious to play with that, but I was startng with just making the 
basics work.  BTW, what if you later decide you want to make a cow/img into 
a single img?

I guess there's no perfect answer, then, is there because that won't work 
very nicely when I decide to run 4 or 5 umls.

Well, I see lots of messages about people having trouble building 2.4.20 in 
general, so I'm not sure my issues have anything to do with the skas patch. 
 I made it past that last error by removing the unneeded module from the 
configuration, and now I'm back to an error I had last time I tried 
building this kernel.  At line 440 in ide-cd.h, "long, shoret, or unsigned 
used invalidly for 'slot_tablelen'".  I friend of mine helped me through 
that last time by fixing the data type of that variable, but I don't know  
 what type he changed it to to make it work.  Currently, the definition is 
__u8 short slot_tablelen.

I was referring to Rich's comments, not the thread as a whole.

However, Hatch was NOT referring to people who download music/movies
illegally.  Hatch was referring to people who download copyrighted music
or movies.  Whether or not those downloads are ILLEGAL must be established
by due process of law.  Hatch wanted to act BEFORE such due process could
be initiated.

Subject: [PLUG] Spam, Etc.
Message-ID: <12E1ACFC.2040505@vancleve.com>

This is only indirectly Linux-related, but I'd really like some input 
from those in the know.  In an article today on the recent Best Buy 
email hoax, I learned that ID theft is keeping good pace with spam, with 
161,800 cases reported last year (FTC) versus 86,200 in 2001 (an 
increase of 88 percent and a total of $343 million in damages).  The 
Internet is a great medium because it's a global anarchy, but if this 
trend continues, it seems people will eventually call on the government 
to take some drastic measures that would undoubtedly change the very 
nature of the medium.  The FBI and like agencies have been making 
vaguely reassuring statements, like "It can be very difficult, but it's 
not impossible" to catch Internet criminals--presumably just so they 
don't seem completely helpless.  But my guess is, by and large, they 
are, and I've been thinking for some time that it must fall to us, the 
technologists, to provide the means of fixing these problems.  I mean, 
let's face it, email, in spite of all the filtering being done, just 
isn't the tool is was before the spam epidemic hit (with spam accounting 
for nearly 50% of emails, I'd say we're drowning here).

My paltry little idea is this:  what if everyone went down to their 
local post office or DMV or something and registered a public encryption 
key, and a database was formed of those keys by which non-registered 
keys could be filtered?  Email clients could then opt to receive only 
emails signed by registered keys, so they couldn't be spammed without 
implicating someone.

This seems fairly analogous to physical ID cards like driver licenses, 
which are issued and validated in the same way.  I don't know enough 
about ID theft to be sure it would help with that, but it seems like a 
viable approach to the spam problem, at least.  We're passing anti-spam 
laws right and left, but what good are those if the spammers can't be 
identified?

Now, I admit I can't relate very well to you hard-core privacy 
advocates, personally, but it seems like this could be implemented as a 
voluntary system, so you could still use your anonymous email addresses, 
except that not everyone would accept your unidentified mail.

I'll stop there, because I'm sure some of you are already prepared to 
punch a few holes in my theory.  There is the international problem of 
either getting other countries to create a credible registration process 
or blocking all their emails, so that spam could not still be sent from 
a server in the Netherlands.  Again, though, I don't trust our 
government to fix these problems without essentially taking over the 
whole Internet.  So we may need to act quickly to come up with a better 
idea.

You can also try to find an older version and buy the upgrade for $99. I
found one on craigslist.

I assume that tuntap is working, or else rootstrap wouldn't have gotten
you this far.

Did you add yourself to the "uml-net" group?

Did you add this information to the /etc/network/interfaces file inside
the uml?

Sorry about being unclear, I'm not using the skas patch.  If it is any
consolation, I'm having all kinds of problems compiling 2.4.20, too.

Responding back to my own post I thought I'd share what I found and settled 
with.

I ended up purchasing a HP ze5165 from Best Buy for about $1400.00 which was 
the best deal I could find.  It has 1400x1050 screen, CDRW/DVD player, built 
in wireless and modem (a winmodem with linux drivers). 3 USB ports, Firewire, 
built in floppy, 40GB HD, and 128MBx2 memory.  Most similar laptops with the 
same specifications were closer to $2000.  Runs linux pretty well, the power 
management problem has been nicely managed using a ACPI knowledgeable kernel.   
However battery time is about 2 hours, regardless of OS.  Several (but not 
all) of the extra keyboard keys work, including one which turns the touchpad 
off, which I like.  The laptop is big and heavy which I originally didn't 
want.  But I read several laptop reviews that stated most light-weight 
laptops now just aren't built to be hauled around alot.  They hinges on the 
screen are weak or the shell is very thin.  So knowing the damage I do to my 
shins and arms I decided to buy a heavier grade laptop.

I also ended up purchasing the Best Buy extended 3year warranty for $250.00, 
which I don't usually like to do, however I can replace the battery yearly 
(which is $250.00 by it's self) for three years and it covers the screen.

Nope.  So far, I'm doing all of this as root in the host system.  Do I need 
to be in uml-net if I'm root?

> Did you add this information to the /etc/network/interfaces file inside
> the uml?

No.  I guess I didn't know it had to be set there, and I thought rootstrap 
was setting all that up for me.  Should the info be inside, outside, or 
both?  Or does it have to be passed on the uml startup command line 
regardless?

I think I'm getting through it.  The problems seem to be bugs that have 
existed in the kernel source, but which a bug in gcc prior to 3.3 did not 
catch.  I'm fixing most of the problems by just omitting drivers that fail 
because I doubt I'd ever need them.  In the case of ide_cd.h, I changed 
__u8 short slot_tablelen to unsigned short slot_tablelen.

I don't know, I've only run it as a user.  My guess would be no, you
don't have to add root to the uml-net group.

Just the info for eth0 on the uml system.  The host will have a tuntap
device with the ip address assigned by the start up parameters.

Don't forget to set ip_forward to 1.

It just smells like bureaucracy.

And who's going to pay for it? There's lotsa $$ in that sort of
system: bandwidth, establishing trust, cpu cycles, and (gotta love job
security) admins of all kinds.

And I can't wait 'til the day someone swipes my e-mail cert and I have
to prove (to whom?) that I'm me and the other freak is the imposter.

And who's going to hire/pay/license the person on the phone I'm going
to have to call when I lose my cert, since I certainly won't be able
to send an e-mail to clear things up?

And what happens when someone launches a successful DDOS attack

Thanks, but which piece is that answering to, the command line, the host

I see that it's set to zero, so I'll fix that.  Does it need ip_forward 1 
to reach the host OS, or does it only need that to get to the outside LAN?

Now I'm confused, let's try this again.

If you start the the file "root_fs" with the command:

linux eth0=tuntap,,,192.168.0.5

then the host will have a virtual network device with the address of
192.168.0.5 and the uml system will have an eth0 device (If you are in
the uml-net group).  To configure this eth0 device you need to edit
/etc/network/interfaces.  If you assign an address from the same network
space as the host, then all you need is to have ip_forward on to have a
route from the uml interface to the host's network.

For example (with the LAN gateway of 192.168.0.1):

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
	address 192.168.0.6
	network 192.168.0.0
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	broadcast 192.168..0.255
	gateway 192.168.0.1

It is also possible to setup the uml interface on a different subnet,
and use a firewall (with NAT) between the host and the uml interface.

Outside LAN.

Hope that isn't too confusing.

That was one of my questions.  What were was the host-side ip address 
arguments in the rootstrap config file for if it can't automatically set up 
the host-side IP addess.  I think I'm seeing that this parameter must be 
talling rootstrap what to speficy when -it- runs the uml, not later when 
-I- rin the uml.  I still need to specify which makes sense - what if I 
want to run more than one, after all?  That was my confusion.

Thanks

> Hope that isn't too confusing.

That's very clear.  Thank you for taking the time.  I think my real issue 
was just understanding the distinction between the parameters for rootstrap 
and the parameters for starting the uml that rootstrap created.  Not having 
any prior grokking of how this stuff hangs together, I thought that somehow 
rootstrap was configuring the UML to start a certain way, but I see that 
this is probably neither what it does, not would it be desirable.

If I ever make it to another PLUG meeting, I owe you a beer.

Of course it does, but does that make it a bad idea?  Anti-spam laws are
going into effect, and that's bureaucracy as well.  But laws alone will
not cure this disease.  It requires a technological remedy, and by the
time the bureaucrats come up with theirs, it'll be too late for us to
offer one of our own.

Ya, can you dig it?  It's the taxpayers, of course.  But like I say,
let's get this on the scale.  My little proposal would be inconvenient,
but spam can be worse.  I mean, you're a Linux admin and know your spam
software, but what about everyone else?  Would they be unwilling to chip
in a few bucks and make a trip to the post office, if it meant they
wouldn't have to waste their time wading through obscure spam
messages--or if it meant their thirteen-year-old daughter wouldn't be
reading subjects like "Shatter Her [deleted] With Your Monster
[deleted]".  I'm not sensationalizing this at all.  It's in the news.
"50% Of Kids Find Spam Offensive".  People are pissed off about this,
and if someone can offer a real solution, I think taxpayers will support
it. That's why they get spammed by people selling spam software.

You wouldn't have to prove the cert' was yours, because you will have
registered it.  So it's basically the same thing as someone getting a
hold of your wallet, isn't it?  You find out about it, you cancel your
old key, you get a new one.

> And what happens when someone launches a successful DDOS attack
> against the identity servers?

I'm thinking with a public key system, the private keys wouldn't be
stored there, so they couldn't do much harm.  It would be like that
attack on eight of the root DNS servers a while ago:  largely
inconsequential.  When the identity servers are down, emails don't get
validated.  No biggie.  Let me stress one detail:  I'm advocating an
opt-in system here, which is better than what you can expect from Uncle
Sam.  Ideally, if you wanted to send and receive unsigned emails, you
could.  But otherwise, only people who were willing to positively
identify themselves would show up in your inbox.  That's the way I would
prefer it, personally.

Now come on, there must be more serious flaws in my theory than these!
:)  Yeah, it would add something to all the bureaucratic nonsense, and
it would cost some money.  Still I'm guessing most people would pay for
it, if it actually could nip email fraud in the bud.  For as I said, all
these new spam laws won't do much for us on their own.  (We might be
able to bust a few people here and there, but that won't scare anyone
else.  After all, tell me that approach is actually working to stop
piracy!)

You talk of centralizing the Internet, but this would work pretty much
like DNS does, and DNS is a good thing, right?  Some centralization is
necessary.  I'm just proposing a means of identifying people, where and
when it's necessary.  You privacy mongers can make crosses with your
fingers if you like, but once again, it just may happen with or without
your cooperation.  Perhaps we can offer a solution more in keeping with
the Internet as we know it than what the FTC will propose.

Well, the story I read today was one good example.  Someone creates a
Best Buy lookalike Web site, then sends a few hundred thousand emails
pretending to be the Best Buy fraud department and asking them to visit
their fony site and enter their personal info'.  So I seriously doubt
Internet-base ID theft is not a problem:  are you saying that the
eighty-eight percent increase last year had nothing to do with the 'Net?

And nor can you tell me spam is not costing a lot of time and money, in
spite of the filters.  Lucky for us, it's mostly the big companies that
are hardest hit, but there's more to it than just Hotmail.  Spam is a
vicious game, and as an expert in playing against it, you are the
exception to the rule.  You may expect every sysadmin to do as well, but
let's be realistic.  Most people still see a lot of spam in their inbox.

But what's your point?  Someone's always going to fall for it, so on the

Right, but you've waived the idea away too simply.  The problem isn't
just spam and ID theft, it's the reality that, if these stories keep
showing up in the newspapers, John Ashcroft will win more and more

Apologies in advance for the upcoming profanity, but it is all said in
context.

I might send this to one of the security lists, but thought you folks
mind find it interesting.

A have a Win98SE peecee behind my Linux firewall at home, and it has
been acting more and more unstable lately. At first I just chalked it up
to general MS bit rot, but this evening, after losing a bunch of my time
to it, I thought I do some actual troubleshooting.

I ran AntiVir, which is a free anti-virus program (and if you folks have
suggestions for any other free ones, I'd be grateful), and found
nothing. However, while I was running it, I ran tcpdump on the firewall
to listen to any traffic from that peecee just in case.

I quickly saw that it was regularly trying to do dns queries for
"fucktard.no-ip.org".

The domain no-ip.org is registered to Vitalwerks LLC, which looks to be
your basic web services consulting place. DNS queries for the A record
fucktard.no-ip.org return 255.255.255.255.

Since I run a DNS server on my firewall machine, I configured it to be
a primary for no-ip.org, and have an a record for fucktard pointing at
172.16.1.1, which is my firewall's internal ip.

As soon as I did that, I saw this:

21:14:07.147116 172.16.1.2.3002 > 172.16.1.1.domain:
64+ A? fucktard.no-ip.org. (36)

0:0(0) ack 1 win 0 (DF)

So obviously some bit of malware on the Win98 machine at 172.16.1.2 is
looking for an IRC server with whom to talk. The next thing I'll try is
setting up an IRC server on 172.16.1.1 and see what we have.

I didn't find anything Googling for fucktard.no-ip.org, both at www and
groups.google.com, so it will be interesting to see how this plays out.

Ok, now that I take a little closer look, no-ip.org is a free DNS
redirection service. I'll have to let them know they're hosting a
baddie.

No, it's law enforcement. It's one thing to identify and prosecute
people who commit crimes. It's a whole different thing to build a
preventative infrastructure to keep that crime from happening in the
first place. The bureacracy needed in the second instance is an order
of magnitude larger than that needed in the first.

Hmm. So some agency, somewhere, would have to

a. Keep a hard-copy record of which keys are registered with which 
   people and/or groups of people (corps, non-profits, government 
   agencies, softball leagues, etc).

   Considering the millions of people in this country who rely on 
   e-mail for communication, this involves a staggering number of 
   employees and huge amount of real-estate (those records have to be 
   kept somewhere). Since we're talking about identity, we're talking 
   about legal, signed documents -- not just electronic copies.

b. Have a process in place whereby an agency employee can validate 
   that a certain individual is qualified to purchase or revoke a 
   key under a given name or corporate identity.

   This implies a 24x7 coverage whereby I could walk into an agency 
   office while on vacation in, oh, Montana, and report my key as 
   stolen. The staff there could *immediately* get a legal copy of my 
   original request and verify that I indeed have the signature and 
   other legal documents necessary to prove that I'm qualified to 
   revoke a key under my name.

   VeriSign does this sort of thing now, but its primary customers are 
   organizations with professional managers and admins.

   Their costs would skyrocket, however, if their clientele was 
   suddenly not Generic Corp., but Joe and Jane Generic. It's 
   difficult to steal the cert verifying www.usbank.com. Stealing the 
   certs of the non-tech-savvy people you want to protect is a 
   relative piece of cake.

c. Have a near-instantaneous way to propogate or revoke a key.

   Contrary to your reply, this is *not* like DNS. DNS records are 
   distributed, but cached copies are regularly out of date by at 
   least a few hours, and perhaps by a few days. That might be 
   acceptable for a hostname, but it's certainly not for personal or 
   corporate identity, particularly if there's fraud involved.

   The credit-card companies are the only agencies that have a 
   consumer-oriented anti-fraud infrastructure that even begins to 
   have this sort of responsiveness -- but they're funded by high 
   interest on consumer debt. I laugh at the chance that you'd be able 
   to rally public support for a tax or fee structure that could 
   generate even a small percentage of that level of funding.

d. Have a process in place whereby keys are expired regularly.

e. Have procedures in place to reduce the likelihood that a rogue 
   employee or group of employees could defraud the process.

   This means more bureaucracy and less efficiency. A lower effiency 
   rate would have to be built into the system to guarantee that the 
   watchers are watched.

f. Maintain a distributed server farm capable of storing accurate 
   records for millions of citizen, with an effective 100% uptime for 
   both systems and network connectivity.

   Have you priced Akamai's services lately?

g. Maintain said distributed server farm with a near impeccible 
   security record. Trust would be everything in this situation. The 
   costs would include physical security, electronic security, and a 
   well trained (and therefore probably well paid) set of network and 
   system administrators.

   Oh, and those admins would have to devise a system so that keys 
   couldn't be harvested in the same way that e-mail addresses are 
   now. I mean, if the keys are publicly available, what's to stop a 
   spammer from just harvesting the keys?

So you're a contractor, and your bid doesn't get to your potential 
client in time because the identity server is down. Is it still 'no 
biggie'?

The cost of maintaining a public electronic identity-verification
system would be huge. The thing is, regardless of whether the system
was 'opt in' or not, only the costs associated with point a. would be
lower with fewer people registering keys. The rest, b. through g., 
would still have to be paid for and maintained regardless of the 
number of poeple who opted into the system.

I'd say you're correct, some form of malware that is using that trying to
use IRC to that system as the control method.

I'd say there is no need to notify no-ip.org though. Notice the IP
address they're returning? 255.255.255.255 is the global broadcast IP
address. Since if honored such packets would spam the entire Internet
with copies of the packet most routers will drop packets to that address
and many will log such packets. They're probably returning
255.255.255.255 because such packets tend to get noticed and serve as a
distress beacon. Definitly time to clean up that system, I'd worry about
all your other systems possibly being breached too.

Google might of been useless because they do some filtering for bad
words. You need to have cookies enabled, go to their main page and select
"preferences". Disable "safesearch" and then try the search again.

Subject: [PLUG] A "Legal" Honeypot
Message-ID: <000001c3388a$f097d330$641010ac@lemonhead>

I, like many of you, and deeply concerned about the direction copyright
law is taking.  I'm particularly concerned about the RIAA vs. Verizon
case in which the RIAA forced Verizon to hand over the names of Verizon
subscribers that the RIAA claims illegally downloaded files.

Wouldn't it be lovely if we could find a way to feed the RIAA some DCMA
lovin?

I believe it is possible to create a honeypot (in the conventional
sense) for the RIAA to download materials from.  Files named "Madonna -
American Life.mp3" and the like should do nicely.  These files would
contain materials copywritten by the people sharing the files, but would
contain no "illegal" materials.

The people sharing the files would monitor the downloads.  When files
were downloaded to IP addresses known to belong to the RIAA and/or their
contractors, sue, or respond with other forms of legal harrasment.
Thus, a "Legal Honeypot."  

I recognise this proposal has some problems.  I don't know what IP
addresses belong to the RIAA and their contractors.  Filing suit (even
if it never goes to trial) is not cheap.  There are other problems here
that I won't address here.

I seek your ideas and feedback.  Can the above plan be made workable?
Have you other ideas?

I'll watch and read with interest.
Thanks,
Erik.

That sounds so complicated. Can't  we just capture Jack Valenti, Hillary 
Rosen, Sen. Hatch, and the senator from Disney Fritz Hollings, and bury them 
up to their necks in anthills?

If that is not sufficient, there are many ants in the world, scalability is 
not a problem.

Yes, I'm well enough versed in ip fundamentals to know what an all-ones
broadcast is. However, returning 255.255.255.255 in the answer section
of a DNS reply is not the same thing as trying to send unicast (or
broadcast) traffic to that address.

No-ip.org is, now that I've taken a look, a dynamic dns registration
service. Say, for instance, that I had a host on a cable internet
service and had to get my ip via dhcp. However, suppose I wanted all my
buddies to be able to get to that host by name whenever it was up and
running. I could install the no-ip.org client on my host, and whenever
that host gets a dhcp-assigned address, the no-ip.org client then calls
up no-ip.org, does some sort of authentication (not address-based,
obviously), and tells no-ip.org to return my dhcp address as the reply
to dns queries for stafford-at-home.no-ip.org.

It may be that no-ip.org returns 255.255.255.255 for all hostnames that
they have registered but which they have not heard from the client with
a new address.

Regardless, whoever registered "fucktard" with them is using it as the
phone-home signal for their bit of irc remote control nastiness, and the
no-ip.org folks need to not accept new ip address client requests for
that hostname.

Message-ID: <200306211619.57725.guy1656@ados.com>

Greetings:

1st - a great 'Thanks' to all those folks who helped me resurrect an ancient 
233MHz, 128MB RAM ATX 'puter at the clinic yesterday. One of the things I 
love about Linux is that it extends the useful lifespan of older machines 
like this - which means on the whole, we get to use machines longer - thereby 
saving money and materials. (Kinda like the longer you can keep your car, the 
less iron needs to be mined and smelted in the world ... sort of ...)

Anyways, thanks to all. It was really satisfying to go through these installs 
and learn a bit more about what's going on. Several folks had a number of 
handy tips & tricks, and pitched to help in when things hung up.

It is running Mandrake 7.0 with no GUI. I am using it as a backup machine on a 
home network. It has 3 hard drives - one for the OS [20GB] another oldie just 
for workspace [1.2GB] and the third, which I want to use to store tar.gz 
backups of home directories made from/of the other computers' 
/home/[username] directories [30GB.]

Now on to my question: When I go

tar -cvpzf /mnt/[somewhere else]/[backup filename].tar.gz * 

in a users home directory on one of these other machines, I get a backup file 
about 5 to 7 GB in that other [somewhere else] directory when it's done. But 
evidently, the little old ATX doesn't like receiving files larger than 2GB.

SO, the question: What is a best/most proper way to create a number of backup 
files that split up into a number of <=2GB files. For example, is there a way 
to carve up a 5 GB tar.gz file into 'filename-1.tar.gz,' 'filename-2.tar.gz,'  
and 'filename-3.tar.gz,' of around 2GB, 2GB and 1GB respectively.

Or is there another, more elegant solution which we're all supposed to know 
about? ("This is how that problem is usually solved in industry, so if some 
one needs to maintain your machine, they'll look at these 3 files and have a 
very good idea of what you did and why ...)

Thanking all for advice & suggestions,

GLL
(getting less lame about this stuff by the season)

My first inclination would be to use 'split'.  man split, etc.

I missed this identifier when I first looked at the strings info:

about

It seems that sdbot is fairly well known. Here's what Symantec has to
say about it:

Sorry if this has already been covered, I walked into the middle of the
thread.  But I get by just fine using:

tar -cv  -L 1000000 -F myscript -f archive.tar stuff/to/backup

This creates chunks that are 1 GB in size.  myscript is actually the backup
script that calls this tar command in the first place.  When called in this
instance it provides the next archive name.  That way I end up with
backup00.tar, backup01.tar, etc.  When all done I gzip the lot of them.  I
picked 1 GB because after gzip it is safely small enough for a cdrom.

I don't think you'd want to split tar.gz files because you'd need to put them
back together to restore anything.

Touche.  But then, you must agree, laws alone will not solve these
problems.

Why the hard copy?  I didn't think DNS records had to be printed out, so
why should these cert's?

That's a bitch.  Wouldn't having your driver licence with you suffice?
Maybe a passphrase as well?  We prove our identities that way all the
time.  If I can get on a commercial flight with just my licence, why
should getting a new encryption key be any harder?

Probably.  I guess the thief would have to break into (or actually
steal) my computer and find my private key (and decrypt that if
necessary).  But the real question here is, would stolen cert's be so
ubiquitous that spammers could use them and still remain untraceable?

Maybe, maybe not, but good point.  If using email depended on the cert',
and the cert' would become invalid immediately when abused, then you're
right.  One workaround would be for people to keep a backup cert' for
that contingency, maybe one they only keep on a diskette or hard copy,
hidden in the attic.  A bit of a hassle, but generally only a one time
thing.  But this way, we wouldn't really need right-away new-key
service.

Easy now, I never said I was an expert on this stuff.

I don't understand the need for this.  My driver licence lasts four
years.  Is four years what you mean?  Keys would be expired when they
are used illegally.  Beyond that, like email addresses, why expire them
at all?

True, but this is not a show-stopper.  Many systems have this problem.

My proprosed system is not as mission-critical as you think.  When I
wrote "no biggie", I had in mind that if an ID server went down, it
would not disable any email servers.  Emails would still go through,
probably tagged as "could-not-validate".  So for a brief window of time,
spam could sent from any unidentified source.  But you'd still get your
business email.

Once again, this is a public key system, so the important part, the
private key, wouldn't be published anywhere.  It wouldn't have to go on
the ID servers, and it wouldn't even have to go to the controlling
agency.  It would stay at home and be used to sign outgoing email.  Or
is my understanding of public key cryptography all messed up?  Having a
record containing only the public key component to identify each entity,
the server could look at a signed email and verify that the sender
indeed possessed the private key for the given public one.  That is
correct, is it not?

See above.

Counterpoint:  the cost of dealing with spam is huge, not only in terms
of money, but in terms of cultural (and political) stress.

Perhaps my elusive "scale" will only come in the form of a complete cost
analysis.  At this point, I'm just trying to establish whether it would
work technically.

I agree that an obvious solution to the problem of spam
is to use a system that assigns keys/certificates
to people. This will probably not happen until there are
other reasons for assigning people certificates, such as
the national ID cards issue.

Until that happens, there are other less effective
solutions that are more effective than what we have now.
One way is to assign certificates to the machines that
move the mail. Sites that send spam will have their
certificate revoked. The problem with this is that
within hours the certificates of all MSN, Yahoo, etc.
servers will be revoked (which would delight me to no
end).

Another solution is to change the email architecture from
its absolutely flat structure to a hierarchy that establishes
"communities" that can communicate through gateways. A
community's gateway has rules for accepting mail messages.

Exactly. At worst the packets will merely be dropped, disabling the worm.
At best the packets will show up very prominently on someone's logs and
get the infected system noticed. Unless you've got other infected systems
on your network?

$ host stafford-at-home.no-ip.org
Host stafford-at-home.no-ip.org not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
$ host nonexistantreallymeaninglessstring.no-ip.org
Host nonexistantreallymeaninglessstring.no-ip.org not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)

fucktard.no-ip.org has address 255.255.255.255

Doesn't look like it.

Looks like that is already the case.

And here I would say, that's just what I'd like to avoid.  I think a
validation layer on top of the existing infrastructure is greatly to be
preferred.

It may seem like it but there can be substantial differences.
Spammers get one or more blocks of IP addresses from their
ISP and move on to other IP addresses as they appear on black
lists and RBLs. If a spammer has a /24 block, you have to chase
them through 254 addresses, unless you can find out what block
they've been allocated and block it all as soon as you discover
they're spammers. Unfortunately, many ISPs (like rackspace.com)
are not cooperative - they won't tell you the spammer's block.
So, you either chase the spammer through his range of addresses
or you block all the ISP's addresses (as I've done for rackspace). 

If spammers had to register certificates for their servers
with some central authority, and this information was publicly
available, we would be able to revoke all their certificates
once we discovered they were spammers. It would no longer matter
what IP addresses they used or that their ISPs are uncooperative.
Other customers (non-spammers) of uncooperative ISPs would not
be penalized.

Message-ID: <20030622175021.Q322@grond.sourballs.org>

After spending most of the day installing and re-installing SuSE 8.2, and
as yet still having no wireless support, I'm just going to break down and
ask if anyone out there can answer 3 questions for me:

1) Do you have a working wireless Linux system?
2) What exact wireless adapter make and model do you have?
3) What modules does it use (and where did you get them)?

So far I've tried Linksys' WUSB11 usb adapter (kernel found it, but got
varying errors trying to load module for it)  and Linksys' WMP11v2.7 PCI
adapter (kernel doesn't seem to see it at all).  Disabling APIC during
install & boot (as was suggested) didn't seem to help.  Some digging
around on the internet leads me to believe that the PCI adapter was a
mistake;  earlier versions of the adapter work with Linux, but 2.7
doesn't.  It also seems like the USB version might work, but possibly not
with the module as supplied by SuSE.  One thing that I noticed in the
reports I read is that compatibility can be here in one minor version, and
gone the next - hence if anyone has a known good adapter, which exact
version it is.

Yes, lots of us do.

I have Orinoco Silver cards from Lucent. However, most
wireless cards work with Linux.

orinoco_cs
orinoco
hermes
ds
pcmcia-core

They came with Slackware but most/all other distributions
supply them as well.

Subject: [PLUG] Apache::MP3 troubles
Message-ID: <20030622164552.009668b3.list@sonofhans.net>

Folks ~

[Egads, this is long; apologies in advance.]

I'm trying to get Apache::MP3[1] working on an internal server and
having no success.  This may be an issue with Apache and/or mod_perl
rather than Apache::MP3, but my limited experience with all three of
these is hampering my debugging.

See below: Versions[2] for what I'm running, Config[3] the relevant
chunk of httpd.conf.

Symptoms: when I browse to http://localhost/songs I get a 404.

Setup for Apache::MP3 is simple: install the module, add a few
directives to httpd.conf[3].  Those directives don't appear to change
Apache's behavior at all, though.

As a test I added another handler which works as expected, printing a
single "hello" to the browser when I go to http://localhost/songs_test
(or anywhere below that).

I edited Apache/MP3.pm and put a 'die' right under the package
declaration; this prevents Apache from starting, as expected.  A 'die'
as the first line of 'sub handler' gives me a '500' error when I
browse to http://localhost/songs, again as expected.

Note that the 'songs' doesn't exist.  I created it
('/var/www/music/songs') and added some MP3s to it -- then I see a
blank directory index instead of a 404 (even after the 'die'
statements).

So it seems that Apache::MP3::handler does get called when Apache
receives a request, but it's doesn't bloody *do* anything.  I have the
requisite 'apache_mp3' directory under /var/www/music and a few MP3s
under /var/www/music and a couple subdirectories.

Apache's error logs show nothing but a few "File does not exist:
/var/www/music/songs" lines.

That's as far as I've been able to take it.  I've done all variety of
searching to no avail -- most people seem to have little trouble
installing it.

Does anyone have any clues?

I don't have an answer for your particular problem, but if you want to
setup a Streaming MP3|OGG server, there's nothing easier than using Edna:

Yes, I've had many successes.

I've tried a few, NetGear seems to be the most consistant with it
model#/chipset identification.  Linksys, D-Link , Siemen and others will
change the chipset, but not the model #.

For PCI, I use the NetGear MA311.

Well, I'm running Debian/Sid, so I just installed the hostap package.  I
believe that it is not available in Woody, or Sarge.

But, http://hostap.epitest.fi/ should have what you need.

There has been talk about migrating the latest version of Apache::MP3
(as well as other modules) to mod_perl2. Since modules created to run
under mpd_perl2 will not function in mod_perl 1.2x you might want to
make sure that you have the right revision for your installation.

I see.  So it actually sounds a little more like the personal
certificate idea to me now.  Except instead of validating emails, we'd
be validating SMTP relays.  How would it work, though?  Would the relay
have to sign all outgoing emails, or how would we verify the cert's?

Since none of this exists yet, I'll speculate how it could work
without changes to the SMTP protocol. It would require changes
to the way mail daemons work. Once the TCP three-way handshake
is over, the originating mail server would say EHELO but also
supply a certificate along with its name. The mail server that
was just contacted now validates the certificate. If the
certificate is OK, it responds in the usual way - with a 200-series
code. If the certificate is not OK (it's the revoked certificate
of a spammer), it responds with the appropriate error code (554?)
and terminates the TCP connection. 

We'd need to have some sort of plan to deal with servers that
say conventional HELOs - they don't provide a certificate.

There may be a fatal flaw in all of this. I spent less than
5 minutes pondering it. If so, something similar could be
engineered. Note that I'd want to implement the certificate
in the early stages of the SMTP handshake because I'm an
advocate of allowing spammers to steal as little of my
bandwidth as possible. There may be benefits to implementing
it later in the handshake if bandwidth is not important.

Sorry if this insults your intelligence, I've done this several
times when fooling around with Apache, what are the permissions
on the directory?  Are they world readable?

I use VMWare to provide access to QuickBooks Pro.  Right now, I am
really not very happy with VMWare.  I run VMWare on my RH Linux system
to access a Win98 load which runs my QuickBooks.  I originally purchased
VMWare under the personal use license for $99.  Then, they changed their
license costs and I had to pay $249 to upgrade to version 3 because I
missed the deadline for getting the $99 upgrade so had to pay full
price.  I was on RH 7.2 at the time I upgraded to VMWare 3.  Some time
later, RH 8.0 came out and I upgraded my system.  After this, the
Windows load under VMWare started to have problems with shutting down. 
I would get an error message everytime.  The system seemed to run fine
but every time I shut the Windows session down, I would get this error
and then when I would start the next session, the system would say that
it had been shutdown unclean and needed to recover.  I reported this
problem to VMWare around November 2002.  VMWare's answer was "We don't
support VMWare on RH 8.0".  No where on their web sited did it say this
at the time. (About a week later, they put a disclaimer on the web.) 
Not one mention of plans to fix the issue or how long before it would be
fixed.

Now, I receive a notice from VMWare last week saying that "We are
writing to inform you of bugs resolved by VMware Workstation 4, which we
released in April 2003.  We fixed the following bugs for which you filed
support requests against VMware Workstation 3:"

Well thanks VMWare, you finally fixed an issue for me but now, I have to
pay to upgrade to the next version to get the fix.  I will have spent
$447.00 on their software.

I think that this time, I am just going to live with the error.  Doesnt
seem to affect the system seriously and I have a hard time paying them
to fix bugs in their software.  

Just my 2c.

I no longer use VMware for similar reasons. I'm
unwilling to buy a product more than once.

Which packets are you talking about? This trojan doesn't send any
traffic to 255.255.255.255. Rather, it just waits until
fucktard.no-ip.org resolves to something other than 255.255.255.255, and
_then_ tries to make an irc connection to that address.

I have never registered stafford-at-home with no-ip.org, so this doesn't
fit the case I was describing.

But just to be thorough, I have now registered rauhaus.no-ip.org, and I
entered an initial ip address of 255.255.255.255. Voila:

srau at trotsky:~$ dig rauhaus.no-ip.org A

VmWare generally works as advertised, but is dog-slow.

A couple of years ago I worked primarily in Linux but had occasionally
to reboot in 'Doze to test that my stuff compiled on that platform.
My employer bought me VmWare to save the reboot time and hassle, but I
found that it was actually faster to reboot in 'Doze, do the compile,
and then reboot into Linux -- because the compile, of a 800K PalmOS
app, took so much more time under VmWare.  I had 128 meg of RAM
dedicated to VmWare, too -- it wasn't that.

If the $99 personal-use deal were still available, though, I think I'd
get a copy for my home machine.  It's fun to run 'Doze in a sandbox
where it belongs. :-)

This bugs me. :)

When I buy a new Ford, I have to pay for it. If, two years later, I want
to upgrade to the latest Ford, because it has new features, they've
fixed some things and the paint lasts longer, do I get the new Ford for
free?

No. I have to pay for it. 

Not simply because it's new hardware. A LOT of engineering time and
effort went into that Ford too. Not only the design team to make the
sleek new body, but software engineers to write the computer code and
engineers to make those weak points so that car crumples properly in an
accident. 

Commercial, closed source software is the same way. VMWare 4.0 contains
new features along with bug fixes. 

Now, if you are only interested in the bug fixes, then maybe it's not
worth the cost. However, if you need or want the new features, then
paying for the upgrade is no different than buying a new car. Someone
has to pay the engineers.

So, in this case, you did pay for it once. You paid for version 3.0 of
the software. You did so, knowing full well VMWares licensing practices.
You knew that VMWare is a commercial product, with all that entails. 

It's a business model. It seems to work for several companies. If you
don't like how they do business, don't use them. 

Win4Lin, Wine, et al. don't suit my needs, so I have to use VMWare, or I
might as well just switch back to Windows and use the same platform for
everything. 

At this point in the game, there isn't a Linux alternative to
everything. Someone else just mentioned Photoshop. Well, I'd like to add
that there's still (four years after I first mentioned it) no COMPLETE
alternative to MS Money or Quicken on Linux. Neither runs well under
anything except VMWare. 

I think it's absolutely fantastic that we have a choice. I love being
able to run my OS, and try out software with little cost beyond my time
and effort. I've been doing that for many years, since before the advent
of the Internet. Before the OSS movement, we had shareware. It wasn't
open, but we still had try before you buy.

My point is, if you CHOOSE to purchase commercial, closed source
software, then you do so knowing what the rules are. You also CHOOSE to
accept those rules by purchasing.

OSS advocacy aside, there is a place in the world for both types of
software. Everyone makes choices. We have to live with our own choices.

VMWare 4 performs very well on my RH8. Windows runs considerably slower
but still very acceptable. Booting and shutting down times seem
identical to original. Unfortunately you have to give VMWare a static
chunk of RAM. Since booting Windows is also not the fasted I leave it
running to keep win32 programs accessible. In effect this meant I had to
buy additional memory. 

I see no problem in charging money for an upgrade of commercial
software. They have to pay the developers to get the new version out
somehow. There is just not an endless supply of first time buyers. If a
software doesn't work for me I give it back.

  I've nothing at all against Ed, for I have the highest regard for him.
But, many consultants -- myself included -- don't like clients who keep
asking for "just a little favor" at no additional cost. We're nickled and
dimed into poverty by these folks. We want to be paid for our efforts. So do
software vendors.

  How many of us have had some mechanical or electronic equipment fail just
out of warranty? (Raises hand.) I had to pay for the repair despite the
failure of the manufacturer. As a matter of fact, this was my biggest
complaint about my Gateway notebook that I bought in November, 1992. In
December, 1993 the internal powersupply plug failed (1 year warranty). Cost
a lot to have that fixed. Fourteen months later the new one failed the same
way. Gateway admitted it was a poor design and poor manufactuing by their
contractor. I still had to pay to get it working again. Software, however,
we expect to be upgraded and fixed so I'm not disappointed to learn I need
to pay for an upgrade.

Others have noted hardware prices coming down as
VMWare goes up, and thought it might be simpler just
to have two computers running different OS's.

I'm still learning my way around Perl...  Here's what I want to do...  I
have a file that contains long lines of gibberish and buried in each line
is a phone number (xxx xxxx).  I would like to create an array that holds
just the phone numbers.  So I think I should do something like this:

$i = 0;
while (<INFILE>) {
   $phone[$i] = /\d\d\d \d\d\d\d/;
   $i++;
}

This, of course, doesn't work...  Any suggestions?

It all boils down to 1 line:

$phone[$i] = /\d\d\d \d\d\d\d/;

Here's what it does.

// is the match operator.  By default it matches against $_ and it
returns true for a match and false if it doesn't.  So in the end your
array should hold a bunch of 1's and 0's, and the array index would
be the which line the phone numbers could be found on.

Here's what you'd like to do:

@phone = ();
while (<INFILE>) {
  if (/\d\d\d \d\d\d\d/) {
    push @phone, ""something""; 
  }
}

The push function treats @phone like a stack, and "pushes" the
2nd argument ""something"" onto the end of the array.

perldoc -f push

Array indexing is implicit, and there is a complementary function
called pop, which removes elements from the end of the array.  There
are also orthogonal functions, unshift and shift, for working with the
beginning of the array so that you can create queues, FIFOs and LIFOs.

But how do you get ""something"" to be the phone number?

First, you must know how perl's regexen work.

perldoc perlre
perldoc perlop

You use parentheses to grab data from a regex, and when using the match
operator, if it's called in list context, then it returns all the data
captured by parentheses:

So here's the code:

use strict;
@phone = ();
my $phone;
while (<INFILE>) {
  if (($phone) = /(\d\d\d \d\d\d\d)/) {
    push @phone, $phone; 
  }
}

You could also do this using a little more cryptically with the
$1, $2, variables. (again, perlop and perlre)

use strict;
@phone = ();
while (<INFILE>) {
  push @phone, $1 if /(\d\d\d \d\d\d\d)/; 
}

But using the $1 will cost your code some speed, if that's a
constraint.  Perl will let you constrain it just about any way you
want.

Message-ID: <1056407961.3ef781997d524@webmail.fiddlers-green.info>

All,

I have a question about $_SERVER and $_SESSION in php 4.3. I am going to set the
application root directory in one of the superglobals. It seems to me it should
be in the $_SERVER because its specific to the application, although on the php
website it says these array  vars are set by the webserver.  The $_SESSION array
seems more for vars that are specific to the use'rs session, like user name,
home dirs, assigned groups, etc.

I was wondering what sort of rule others used for determing what to set in where.

thanks,
Dan H.

Or, get the same list using grep, in a locale-independent way:

  grep -Eo '[[:digit:]]{3}[[:space:]][[:digit:]]{4}' infile.txt

Why? Just because you can. :-)

No, I've just been doing it for a long time.   If you want good, you'll
have to look for Randal Schwartz or any of the other Perl Mongers in
the area, and we have quite a few big name type people.

$_SERVER holds items like environment variables
$_SESSION holds items that relate to a user's session as put there by
you, the coder...using session_start(), and session_register(), etc....


make a page with the following php code to take a look....

<?php
phpinfo();
?>

That's exactly what I do - with a Linksys 2 port KVM switch. I also run
VNC...

Very slick and easy to set up. One of these days I gotta install

Nice.  I'll take a look at this (and at Edna, suggested by Matt).

One feature of Apache::MP3 that I really want, though, is play-time
downsampling.  If I'm at a slow remote location I could
(theoretically, assuming it ever works) pick a bitrate and the server
would downsample all tracks on-the-fly.  I haven't seen another system
which does this.

It seems like a good idea, if you assume most spammers create their own
SMTP servers.  But don't they often use open relays or break into
networks to use existing servers?  If so, then validating SMTP servers
would place a great burdon on ISPs to make sure no one abused them. 
Hotmail's relays would get blacklisted faster than you can say "viagra".

By the way, there was a big article today in the news (New York Times,
or the Washington Post, can't remember) on new spam legislation now in
congress.  Anyone paying attention to this stuff?  (I'm guessing so,
knowing this to be a fairly politically-inclined list.)

I don't see the "slow" thing on this machine with vmware 4 in the eval

I have the 128 MB dedication too. On a pIII 500 it runs a little slower
than native (but then I don't have to do a lot with it).

Yeah, I do understand that. It reminds me of a Salt Lake City bottle

Thanks - This is the information that I was looking for. It looks like

C'mon Russ...  You want the paint job, you take it to Ford and get new
paint. That's available on Fords (as would be expected). They don't
bull-doze you into buying the new car, unlike some Software vendors.

Now, if your Ford required a re-boot every 50 miles do ya think they
would tell you that you had to pay for the "bug fix". They might try but
the AG would have their butt for it.

And if you don't want them? Well, Sir, your out of luck, you see, we at
VMWare don't support your revision anymore. Tell me that Ford will
refuse to support an 85 Bronco.

This is true, there are some workstation apps that are not ready for the

I don't begrudge anyone profit, my question was to solicit info from
current users of the product before I spent the money. So far the
response has been very informative.

It looks like this thread is getting a little off topic from "Who uses
VMWare and do you think that it's worth the money".

I did not see any "slow" starting from Vmware 1.0. You lose essentially a fixed
amount of performance: on something like pII-400 the VM is pretty much at a
standstill, and after that it scales with whatever your CPU is, only slower
by some amount. On my athlon-2600+ the CPU penalty is not significant.

Memory us a larger issue. If I allocated 128M to my VM it would be slow too.
But you end up with only a portion of your real memory going to VM, and if you
allocate too much the host OS slows down. On my PC, I could not give VM more than
about 650M when I had 1G total. Now, with 1.5G I can allocate 1G to VM.

Try Win4Lin (if WinME does not make you vomit) - it's in that price range.

I could be wrong, but I don't think session_register() is needed any more,
not with current versions of PHP (PHP 4.2+)

It sounds like you've heard from more whiners and complainers than the product
really deserves.  I'm running two (licensed) copies of WinXP Pro under VMWare
3.x on a Red Hat 7.3 server, which is also doing a bunch of other things, and
everything has been  running trouble free in a production environment for 153
days and counting.  I actually have the two instances of VMWare running in a
VNC session since the server is at a co-lo.  I'd say VMWare is just about the
only piece of PC software I would happily pay $279 for.

If money is really tight, it might make more sense to run Windows in a
headless workstation with VNC, and then access it from your Linux desktop.  It
all depends on the apps you need to support.

You are receiving this email because you are on an alert list for SB
655.



You may have heard that SB 655 is up for a hearing tomorrow. The hearing
has been postponed until Wednesday, but the bill is up for a "gut 'n
stuff" which will replace its contents with an entirely different bill.
The replacement language would direct the PUC to prohibit the
disconnection of "local exchange residential service" under certain
circumstances where a person could be endangered by not being able to
call police. The original bill is completely eliminated.



If you have any further questions, I'd be happy to answer them.

I have also heard a lot of positive feed-back from folks like you that
use the product for more than one image. Unfortunately for VMWare, my
needs are much less complex and they, apparently, don't make a version
that suites this well. In all fairness, I only need one Win2k image with
a very light complement of software. As with most of the folks that have
replied with less-than-favorable reviews, I feel like the absence of a
lower-end version is a market opportunity that they are missing.

Money is tight for almost everyone but if a product has value and meets
the need then I'm in. However, for my current need I just don't see that
value.

Good points though Terry!

My reading is that they are using the Bill number for another Bill.
The super DMCA bill is not dead, but it is seems to have been delayed
beyond this session. Senator Charles Starr, the bills original sponsor,
has withdrawn his support for it. See this

That article is dated May 29, 2003.  I wouldn't be surprised if they've
made some ammendments and it's back still as the 'theft of service' bill.
It's still listed here:
http://www.leg.state.or.us/03reg/measures/sb0600.dir/sb0655.intro.html

And the EFF still has it listed here:
http://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/states/

I don't think it has gone away... They were just hoping that we weren't
paying attention any longer.

I agree, I definitely think we should keep our eye on them. The bill
may look dead but may need to be prodded a few more times just to
make sure.

I was following the instructions at

problems with the Debian 2.4.20 kernel and gcc 3.3, it took days and days. 
 Try a build, see which package failed, figure out if I care, if not, 
remove it, if so, fix it (usually a bad data type or string constrant 
wrapping).  So, finally, eureka!  I see echo done > stamp-build.

So, I follow instruction 6 in the link above, cd to /usr/src, and type ls. 
 I see I have the bz2 image, but no .deb file.  What gives?  What didn't 
finish, why didn't it tell me about a problem, and how do I get it to 
finish making the package?

Thanks,

- Steve Jorgensen

P.S.
Actually, I combined the instructions from there with instructions from 
somewhere else I don't recall, and added --initrd to the make-kpkg command 
line since that seems to be the appropriate thing to do.

If there's no kernel_image at the end you don't get the .deb file.

I don't know I haven't probed too deeply into the make-kpkg application.  From 
what I can tell you didn't do anything wrong, you just didn't ask it to make 
the package.  It compiled find, it just didn't create the package, which 
seems stupid to me *shrug*

If you're trying to make the choice between $_SERVER and $_SESSION I'd
choose $_SERVER, unless it's set on a per-session basis, then I'd use
$_SESSION.  Were it me though I'd define a constant with the application
root it it which to me 'feels' less cumbersome than interacting with
$_SERVER.

Ya, port 6667 is IRC. So.. why are you using windows 98? And not even 
behind a firewall? And talking about how your winders box got hacked on 
a linux users group list? If you need to use windows.. at least install 
a version that isn't wide open for anyone to 0wn you (like 2k or XP ... 
but you still have to configure properly).

Here's some clarification on SB 655..

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Date: Tue, 24 Jun 2003 09:45:51 -0700
From: Staff SenCharlesStarr <Staff.Sencharlesstarr at state.or.us>
To: ptkwt at aracnet.com
Subject: SB 655 hearing.

Phil,



To further clarify what is happening with SB 655. It is essentially too
late in the session to introduce a new bill. So those who want a new
bill have to find a "dead" bill with an appropriate "relating to..."
clause that they can "gut 'n stuff.". In this case, the PUC wants to
have the authority to prohibit a telephone company from cutting off
local service to a customer whose life may depend on being able to make
a phone call for police or an ambulance. Since a telephone is a
"communications service," the relating to clause of SB 655 (Relating to
communications services) allows it to be amended by completely "gutting"
the original bill and "stuffing" the new bill. Only the bill number and
relating to clause will remain the same. SB 655 will now be referred to
as SB 655 A-engrossed and will be a completely different bill and will
have nothing about "unlawful communications devices" or copyrights or
fines as in the original bill.



I believe that Sen. Starr will support the NEW SB 655, but we will have
to wait until the hearing, in case someone raises reasonable objections.

I'm using Win98 because my daughter and I both enjoy pc games that are
not available on any non-Windows platform.

You obviously didn't comprehend the information I included about running
tcpdump on the _firewall_. Perhaps you should read a little more
carefully.

Why not? Particularly since I discussed using various Linux tools to
examine what was going on. Did you happen to read this paragraph?

You misunderstood. I use windows too.. I was asking specifically about 
win98.

I Just didn't see the need to run tcpdump.

I breezed past this paragraph. Once i saw port 6667, I started reading 
faster since it was obviously an IRC bot. sorry :)

I'm trying to create an array of structs.  Each different struct
represents a different page.  I'd like to assign values and print them
out, but the slightly modified example below from the Perl Cookbook
doesn't work.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,

use Class::Struct;

struct Page => {
   pagenumber => '$',
   linenumber => '$',
   column => '$',
   dataline => '$',
   name => '$',
   address => '$',
   phone => '$',
   subcat => '$'
};

my @page = Page->new();

$page[1]->pagenumber("1");
$page[1]->linenumber("1");
$page[1]->column("2");
$page[1]->dataline("blah blah blah some name here 123 4567 blah blah");
$page[1]->name("John Smith");
$page[1]->address("123 SW 123 St.");
$page[1]->phone("123 4567");
$page[1]->subcat("1");

print "STRUCT PHONE TEST: $page[1]->phone";

I doubt you can initialize the entire @page array with a single 
constructor. You'll need to initial each element separately:

  my @page = ();
  foreach my $n ( 0 .. $ad_quem ) { $page[$n] = new Page; }

  Last evening, a subscriber to one of the very-low-volume mail lists I host
here had a virul infected Microsoft MUA send the virus to all list

  Is there a simple way to protect a majordomo mail list from MTDs

Hadn't noticed that yet.  I have noticed that jpgs are not always 
viewable on their own, but figured it would take some tweaking to get 
past that.  And I've been concerned with other things, so it's taken a 
back seat.

Mark,

  I, too, missed the proper "preference" option the first few times I went
through it. On the "Navigator" page is a section for "Helper Applications"
and that's where we can specify the tool to view/process various types of
files.

HTH,

Sure would be nice if we could treat it like we do sars and quarantine

I'm hoping that some kind soul on this diverse list will have some leads 
about the subject.  Ideally I'd like to use a temperature monitor that 
will sit in a 2foot by 2 foot cabinet.  The box has ethernet and power. 
ideally, I would like to query the temperature monitoring device via snmp 
as to graph it's trend using MRTG.  The closest I've come up with so far 
is:

Model E4 or Model F.


Google is being unusually stingy about coughing up links for this type of 
device.  I'd also like to keep the price below $200.

How about an older used computer with a temperature sensor connected
to the serial port. Here is a temperature sensor I have used
and the parts needed to connect it to a serial port.

Message-ID: <1056529506.3ef95c629d0f1@webmail.fiddlers-green.info>

PHP gurus,

I discovered that I can instantiate classes with a variable name. i.e.:

I create a class called test, then in my script:

$var = test;
$testclass = new $var;

and a new instance of test gets created. I was wondering if this was bad
practice and if I should cease and desist before I make a habit of creating
instances of classes this way?

thanks,
Dan Herrington

Thanks to everyone who responded to my cry for help.  It turns out what I
really needed was a strong dose of RTFM - I got the Linksys USB wireless
adapter (WUSB11v2.6) working with SuSE 8.2 by doing 2 things:

1) finding the correct howto
(http://atmelwlandriver.sourceforge.net/howto/howto.html)

2) reading it carefully.

It turns out the correct driver module is included with SuSE 8.2, but a
bit of fiddling (not detailed in SuSE's docs, as far as I can tell) is
required for the system to load it correctly.

I don't see the point in doing this for just creating objects. there are 
useful applications of this, but there is no point in just doing it for the 
sake of doing it. this also works with functions by the way:
<?
function foo()
{
  print 'hello world\n';
}

$function = 'foo';
$function();
?>

This is a feature that can be used with the AbstractFactory design
pattern, to instatitate objects which adhere to an interface but whose
exact implementation should be decided at run-time.

There are other places you can use this that I'm not thinking of right
now.  Obviously in your test example, there's no need for it, but it can
very useful.  So, use it when it actually solves a problem and don't
when it doesn't.

You can also use it to emulate a number of features of C++ templates
(albeit, at runtime and with a different syntax . . .)

I think you've got it the wrong way around Shams: C++ templates are a
half-assed attempt to do some of the things you can do in better OO
languages: run-time evaulation, dynamic typing, etc.

Well, yes, but I've found that people frequently associate a certain
design approach with templates that they don't consider when using more
dynamic languages.  Templates; what a wonderful way of taking all of the
static type checking of C++ and turning it into pages and pages of
cryptic compile errors. Then again, templates *could* be seen as forcing
open source on the C++ world ;-)

RTFM is good advice when documentation is organized, clear, and easy to find. 
In this case, it isn't. The docs for implementing wireless in Linux are a 
chaotic mess. The worst part is trying to find if a particular card is 
supported. I don't blame the heroic souls who are writing drivers and docs 
for Linux, with little help or support. I am fed up with hardware 
manufacturers and vendors being so completely chickensh*t about Linux 
support. So don't feel bad about needing help.

I don't know if anyone has succcessfully used this on Redhat 8 or newer
as I've run into news on google that it's not supported.  I tried to
use a http://www.opensound.org Linux forum, unfortunately the forum 
doesn't work with Redhat 8's mozilla.  There was an archived support 
post on redhat.com that suggested their might be a commercial driver 
for the integrated Nicrosoft Soundmaker Cadneza, but I haven't been 
able to track it down.  This card even stinks under 98SE for support 
needing an obscure patch.  I'm almost ready to turn it off and put my 
soundblaster live in despite hating the idea of dead ports which is 
why I looked for this motherboard in the first place.

I'm trying to get DVD's to play on this board as I can't get that to work
under 98SE where lack of sound support is an added obstacle so far for
making DVD playback work under Linux.  I'm staying away from XP because
I don't want to buy it A and I have seen strong indications that it
doesn't work in a multiboot environment and doesn't work well with
Samba.

Anyone know what the status of the serial ATA and raid features of this
board under Linux>

It looks as if Red Hat will be deprecating pine in future releases due
to some licensing disagreements with the folks up at UW. (I believe
Debian has long recognized this fact.)

Anyway, I'm not prepared to give up pine, so I thought I'd see about
building a home-brewed rpm that duplicated Red Hat's as closely as
possible, including the pinepgp stuff.

So I'm using a test version of 4.56, and, man, do I like it.

The main visible difference between it and 4.4x is that it supports a
threaded view of newsgroups and mailing lists.

Under the hood, however, its IMAP stuff is much quicker. I've got
something like 18 mailboxes here and there that receive new mail
(accounts on three machines, and lots of procmail rules :-). Polling
all those boxes for new mail seems significantly faster than it did
using 4.44.

Just thought someone might like to know.

I do, and thanks.  Would you be making the rpm available?  If hosting the 
download is an issue, I can accomodate that as well.

WW's giddiness over the sudden 'fame' of Beaverton has caused them
to jump to conclusions here (Linus is
working for OSDL, OSDL is in Beaverton, therefore Linus is moving to
Beaverton).  Pretty sure I read in the Oregonian article (and a coule
of others) that he is going to stay where he is (Sunnyvale?) and work
from home.  Technically he's still employed by Transmeta, he's just on a
leave of absence.

Chris and Will,

Thanks for the reply. Sorry I didn't go into it further, but it actually
fulfills a need in my case.  I have a framework that will have an unknown amount
of modules (for future expansion) that get installed and recorded in a table in
the db. I need to instantiate an object specific to the mdoules themselves, but
without hardcoding the names of the modules in my code (to the ones I currently
know about, thus limiting future expansion), I coudln't call the specific
classes. I was just worried I had run across something that was an "undocumented
feature" and could easily be eliminated in a future release. I searched php.net,
but hadn't noticed any refrences to the functionality anywhere.

thanks,
Dan H.

I usually make available only my .spec files and any one-off patches I

you'd like to post them somewhere.

Aye, Debian has.  I've been meaning to move away from Pine myself.  There
are only three pine users left on my system and I'm unfortunately one of
them.

Threaded view?  The last build of pine I did is 4.52 and I don't see no
stinking threads.

It's still dog slow on large mboxes, though.  I'll probably be moving to
mutt and the dreaded maildir soon.

  Don't brew more than you can drink. According to both the Oregonian and
on-line news reports he's staying in his bay area house and telecommuting,
just like he has been doing.

Hi all,
I have a friend that is trying out mandrake 9.1 on his home computer. 
 He was wondering how to login to his aol account, over a phone line.  I 
thought that there was some email about doing this but can not find them 
in the archive.  If some one could point me to some documentation or 
tell me I know my friend would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks

Here's what I know, unless there have been some recent changes....

AOL uses its own TCP/IP variant for dial-up. They have software for
Macintosh and Windows, but I don't think they have Linux software yet.

If you have another ISP, you can dial-up to them and use a web browser
to read your Email at aol.com or use AOL Instnt Messenger.

regarding contributions related to the Open Source Consideration Bill. She
said that she would be happy to send an itemized list of contributions she
mentioned in her article.

Nope.  100 Gallons per person.  And If 3 people shack up, its still only 200 Gallons per "household."  So ya can't count yer kids or yer pets.  Still, It's not like they audit you.  Still, its a risk I'm not up for.  Here's a web page:

Yup, per adult/household.  That's about 356 six packs per year for a person 
(somewhat less in reality).  It'd be a challenge, but you'd never be thirsty.

To return to topicality, there's a pretty good recipe app for Linux here

Where does it say that that applies to "beer"? The only adult beverage I
see listed on that page is "wine". 

I'm really curious here.

I try shutdown now, but uml is not really gone.  It's sutting there waiting 
for me to press ctrl+d to reboot it.  I'll try halt, and see if that shuts 
it all the way down.

(Re: large backup files, 7GB or so, but older computer
will only handle <2Gb file sizes...) 
: I walked into the middle of the
: thread.  But I get by just fine using:
:
: tar -cv  -L 1000000 -F myscript -f archive.tar stuff/to/backup
:
: This creates chunks that are 1 GB in size.  myscript is actually the backup
: script that calls this tar command in the first place.  When called in this
: instance it provides the next archive name.  That way I end up with
: backup00.tar, backup01.tar, etc.  When all done I gzip the lot of them.

OK, now - how would you restore once you have backup00.tar, backup01.tar, etc?
Can a compressed file get split across two backup files? What happens?

Indeed, the ATF promulgated the home brewing of beer in an entirely
different section.  Weird, but it's the government...

Here's the Home Brew Beer page that says approximatly the same thing.
http://www.ttb.gov/alcohol/info/faq/subpages/25_205.htm.

Hope that helps.

Happy Brewing!

Where does it say that that applies to "beer"? The only adult beverage I
see listed on that page is "wine". 

I'm really curious here.

That was giving me the fsck when I restart uml, but I solved that by shutting down properly with the -h option on shutdown.

Yeah, I was going to do that anyway at some point.  I know about tune2fs -j, but what has to be done in fstab?

Change the mount type from ext2 to ext3, otherwise it will still be
mounted as ext2.

Does anyone know of a good how-to for beer brewing? 

I've googled, but since I know nothing, I don't know if I'm looking at a
good something, or a bad something.

Always wanted to try, just never gotten around to it.

Any of the Charlie Papazian books.  Any member of the Oregon Brew Crew
that actually brews, rather than just appreciates, beer.  The counter
staff at any of the local home brew stores.  

It's really very simple.  As one professional brewer said, "People
have been brewing for thousands of years.  You may not get what you 
expect but you'll get beer."

  I've recently started getting back into home brewing.  I just picked up a
new starter kit and "Hoppy Nut Brown Ale" ingrediants from "Let's Brew" up
on Columbia Blvd.  The kit came with a book and brewing instruction.  

  The add for "Above The Rest" in Tigard says they give brewing classes.

I got my start at home brewing wine with lots of help from Kevin and Doug at Main Street Brew in Hillsboro.  http://www.mainbrew.com  Kevin has a knack for being able to taste a beer and write down a recipe that gets the brewer very close.

Them dudes are full of good advice.  Unfortunatly, Kev uses a Mac. :>

.spec is fine.  Another question is does this include support for UTF-8?

For a few days, I'll make available the source rpm:

  ftp://ftp.cse.ogi.edu/pub/people/heinlein/pine-4.56-1.src.rpm

It'll be gone in about a week, but feel free to mirror it.

Because the .src.rpm contains a (trivial) patch, please don't
make binary rpms available unless you remove mention of the patch from 
the .spec file. The UW license specifically prohibits redistribution 
of patched pine binaries. Distributing the original source along with 
patches, however, seems to be OK.

> Another question is does this include support for UTF-8?

Yes, though I can't say I've tested it at all.

I've got my mailboxes defined using $HOME, as in:

  mailboxes ! $HOME/Mail/plug $HOME/Mail/abcusers $HOME/Mail/rhnadmin

so you can always use an environment variable if setting a variable
in .muttrc doesn't work.  You might be able to use the =/myFolder 
shortcut as well. And if you want to quickly get all of the 
folders in your mail directory, you can always say:

  mailboxes `echo /nfs/foo/u3/u/bar/mail/folders/*`

You might also need:

  set check_new=yes


Then, when you hit the 'c' command to change folders, if a message
has come in on another folder its name will appear in the command 
area, and hitting the return key will take you there.


I used to have the ugly threading problem, too.  I think that this
line is what fixed it:

  set ascii_chars            # use ASCII instead of ACS chars for threads

After you have defined mailboxes in .muttrc, use mutt -y
to bring up a list of mailboxes to browse.

[...]

And if more than one mailbox has new mail, after pressing "c" you can cycle
through them by pressing the spacebar.

And once you're displaying a message list for any mailbox, you can press "c"
and then <TAB><TAB> to display defined mailboxes which have new mail. Press
<TAB> again, and all mailboxes you've defined (as above) will show in the
index, regardless of whether they have new mail. Press <TAB> one more time,
and all of your mail folders (in whatever you've defined as your maildir)
will display, regardless of whether they've been defined by the mailboxes
directive in .muttrc. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! At this point, <TAB> toggles
between the mailboxes index and the maildir index. Mutt is slick!

Thanks everyone for the quickstart tips on mutt. I think I'm all set up
now and finding mutt just as good or better than pine. The "set ascii"
command worked wonderfully also.

Subject: [PLUG] FW: port 80 problem
Message-ID: <MEEKKAPIMDJAJLIOBCHCKEOMCMAA.bmdimaculangan@bhpi.com.ph>

I have here a Linux server that is acting as proxy server with 2(two NICs),
one is facing the Internet and the other is facing our LAN.  The problem I
have is the webpage hosted in that server is only available in our local
area network.  When I tried a port scan using the local address port 80
seems to ok, but when I port scanned the IP Address facing the Internet port
80 is not available. That is why the webpage hosted in that server is only
available for the local area network and inaccessible in the outside world.
I would like to know is how could I make this port 80 available to the
outside world?

TIA

Have you looked into the way your firewall is set up? It 
could be as simple as a point and click in RH, could be 
iptables, but either way I'm guessing it's in the internal 
network configuration.

BTW- If you post to this list in plaintext, instead of HTML, 
you'll get to more geeks. Some on the list hate HTML mail and 
send it to the bit bucket before it ever gets seen.

And others of us, while we don't hate html email, use text based email
clients, so it's some work to view an "html only" posting. 

For email, text is best. :)

Then again, maybe I do hate html email and don't realize it. If I get
html only mail, 9 times out of 10 I delete it without trying to read it,
because it's almost always spam....

What does netstat tell you about port 80? I.e. what does
netstat -an | grep ":80"
return?

It is possible that your web server is configured to only listen to
port 80 on the local network.  If you are running apache this is
configured with the listen directive in httpd.conf
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#listen
yours may be something like
Listen 192.168.0.1:80
where you probably want it to be just
Listen 80

A better solution to phone spam is Asterisk, with it's included 
Zapateller and PrivacyManager modules.

Short description: Asterisk (http://www.asterisk.org/) is an OSS PBX 
system which can be easily turned into a voicemail and VoIP gateway 
for your house.  With the addition of a $100 card, it can take your 
house line into the back of your Linux box and pre-parse your calls. 
Then, upon completion of checking your calls, it will forward the 
call to either a SIP device (like a Cisco ATA-186, with two lines at 
~$130) or to any other gateway of your choice.

If your caller does not have caller ID, the Zapateller application 
plays the first three tones of a "number out of order" recording, 
which most automated phone bots will take as a "bad number" and they 
will remove you from their database and hang up at the same time. 
This gets about 50% of the phone spam that I see.

The PrivacyManager application next looks for any inbound calls 
without caller ID.  It forces the caller to enter in a valid caller 
ID through the touch-tone pad.  Most telemarketers will not do this 
(none, actually, in my experience) and they hang up.  Since 
implementing Asterisk, I have had two spam calls get through (six 
months.)

You can get more sophisticated than that if you want: blacklists, 
whitelists, pre-announcements on _all_ calls, database lookups.  It's 
all possible.

Agreed. But I see you're also a `mutt' user, Russ. Here's a tip to take the
work out of viewing html email...

[.muttrc]
# View html mails using lynx
set implicit_autoview
auto_view text/html  application/x-pgp-message
set mailcap_path="~/.mailcap"
set mailcap_sanitize=yes


[.mailcap]
text/html; /usr/bin/lynx -dump -force_html '%s'; copiousoutput; description=HTML Text; nametemplate=%s.html

cheers,
Sandy

My first guess is that one of your package lists in
/var/lib/apt/lists/ is corrupt somehow and apt-get has trouble reading
it.  Try this (either as root or under 'sudo'):

  $ cd /var/lib/apt
  $ mv lists old_lists
  $ mkdir -p lists/partial

Here you're renaming your old 'lists' directory, then recreating
'lists' and 'lists/partial' (without these apt-get will fail).  Then
run 'apt-get update' again and it should fetch brand new lists.

If that doesn't work, try 'strace' to see if you can find out exactly
where it's hanging by running (as root or under 'sudo'):

  $ strace apt-get update | less

'| less' pipes the output (which will be very long) to 'less', which
will make it much easier to read; if you don't have 'less'
installed use 'more' instead (or any other pager program).

If these don't help and no one here offers better advice consider
asking the debian-users mailing list.  It's high-traffic, but
generally friendly and tolerant of varying skill levels:

I read at /. not too long ago that Linksys was using Linux as the 
underlying OS on some of their newer 802.11g access points/routers. The 
issue was raised as to whether or not they're violating the GPL by 
doing that. 

I have one of Linksys's new 802.11g access points and when I OS 
fingerprint it with "nmap" it identifies the device as being a 2.4.x 
version of Linux. It would be nice if Linksys would give back to the 
Linux community and provide Linux drivers for their newer 802.11g NICs. 
When last I checked there wasn't any support.

Right now I'm using Win2K on a laptop with one of Linksys's 802.11g PC 
Cards. Since my laptop belongs to the company I work for I don't really 
have a choice as to what OS I use on it at this point. We do have 
several Linux systems running in our server closet which is a step in 
the right direction IMHO.

Subject: [PLUG] Plug hostfs hole in uml without kernel recompile?
Message-ID: <01C33D15.1F9FA6B0.jorgens@coho.net>

Hi all,

Yet another User Mode Linux question...  Here I am, happily setting up User 
Mode Linux becuase I know I'm going to be a security bonehead, and this 
seems like a good way to keep services isolated from one another without a 
room full of systems to run my home network.  Also, it was seeming actually 
easier to understand and set up than chroot.  Now, come to find out that 
UML can happily access the host filesystem using hostfs - so much for 
bullet proof security.  Sure, it's still more secure than not using uml, 
but not nearly so much as I thought.  On article I saw recommended running 
uml in chroot for this reason - so much for not having to learn about 
chroot.

So, I know that I could compile my own uml kernel with hostfs support 
ommitted, but I just finished a week-long ordeal getting my host kernel to 
compile with gcc 3.3 so I could set up the skas patches.  I'm not looking 
forward to another kernel recompile experiment at this particular time. 
 Shouldn't there just be a uml start-up option to disable hostfs?  OK, 
"should" and reality appear to differ in this case, but I'm hoping someone 
here knows some simple, clever trick I could use.

Anyone?

Thanks,

- Steve Jorgensen

Message-ID: <01C33D17.3E1595D0.jorgens@coho.net>

I just realized there are options in linux --help that are not in man 
linux, so I just tried starting with hostfs=/dev/null.

With this option, if I try mount -t hostfs none /testmount from inside the 
uml, I get "mount: Not a directory".  That's good, but then I try mount -t 
hostfs none /testmount -o ../.., and I get the host root mounted at 
/testmount.  It appears that this option does not truly "confine" the user 
to a subdirectory, it merely makes that the initial path, and does nothing 
to aid security.

Subject: [PLUG] Can I send mail from an attbi/comcast account?
Message-ID: <20030630012819.GP25919@peak.org>

I have a small LAN running behind a LEAF (leaf.sourceforge.net)
firewall and a comcast cable modem -- in Corvallis.  I'd like to be
able to send mail from hosts on the LAN.  I'm happy to use my ISP
address (fixin at peak.org) as the reply-to address and not to have any
mail coming into my LAN from the network: I just want to be able to
send mail out.

Is this possible?

(The modem gets its IP address via DHCP, but the router registers it
with dyndns.org -- so dig works, but dig -x will give you comcast's
funky name for my interface rather than mine.  Not sure if all this
matters.)

If it's possible, where's the best place to start reading?  I'm in
exim docs right now.

Thanks,

The hosts behind the firewall/router can access Comcast's email servers 
without any problem so you don't need anything fancy to do this. 
Depending on what sort of hosts you have on the LAN, there are several 
ways of connecting. We have several email addresses through Comcast and 
we just use POP3 clients on the hosts inside our network. They have no 
problems sending/receiving email via POP3/SMTP to Comcast's email 
servers.

I actually had a use for using sendmail on one of my Linux boxes inside 
my LAN and so I setup my firewall/router box to run sendmail as a relay 
for systems on my LAN. My firewall relays all outgoing email to  
Comcast's email servers. I only send e-mail out and I don't allow any 
in bound connections into my firewall/router box.

Subject: [PLUG] Apache Reverse Proxy
Message-ID: <1056943140.1496.26.camel@sparticus>

All,

I have a router that has two web servers sitting behind it. The router
is configured such such that all outside requests on port 80 are routed
to Host A. I have several virtual domains on host A and it works fine.

The snag comes when I bring up a new web server and want it to also
receive requests from the Internet. Since I can specify traffic only by
it's host name with my router (e.g. I cannot direct traffic by URL), the
only way is to route the request through Host A.

It's easier to show you than explain what I would like to have; here it
is:

   http://www.domain_A.com ---> Router Port 80 ----> Host A

   http://www.domain_B.com ---> Router Port 80 ---> Host A ---> Host B

I want to expose only one IP to the Internet for security purposes. This
seems trivial but surprisingly it isn't. 

Although I find Apache's modular design fascinating (mod_proxy,
mod_rewrite, etc.) these modules don't seem to do exactly what I need.

I think you'll find this challenging...


Thanks,


Cooper

Did you build your own kernel or did you use one of RedHat's prebuilt
kernels?  What does "/usr/bin/redhat-config-soundcard" give?

Robert,

Just exactly "something along those lines!!"

Here's what did the trick:

<VirtualHost *:80>
     ServerName hostb.domain.com
     ProxyPass        / http://<ip address of host b>/
</VirtualHost>


That was just the tip I needed! Thank you very much!

Robbert,

Just a few things to try...

First, let's find sndconfig...

  # whereis sndconfig

Or, if you're feeling spry...

  # find / -name sndconfig 2>/dev/null

Now, let's see if we can get the module installed...

  # cd /lib/modules/<kernel_version>/drivers/kernel/sound

Look for a module called i810_audio. If you find it...

  # modprobe i810_audio

Also, see the documentation in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/modules.txt
for getting this module to load automatically...it's fairly well written
and gives some good examples.

Check to make sure that the volume and line controls are up in X...

  # xmixer

Hope this helps...

        We still need a few extra volunteers to physically man the booth
        on the three days. You will get free access to the main floor at

  Geek TechSupport -
        As usual, you are encouraged to bring your laptop/pc and if you
        have a problem or would like someone to assist you with trouble-
        shooting, we're always open to lending a helping hand.

  Anything goes -
        Well almost anything. ;-) Bring your questions and curiousity...
        we're all open to helping and answering the best we can.

THE MEDIA LIBRARY

        (yet again...), we will be continuing our project with the PDXLUG
        virtual library (http://library.pdxlug.org), and if you've already
        used it, the meeting is a good chance to get your books you reserved,
        and hand out books you're lending.

        *** Remember to bring back your books that you checked out of the
        PDXLUG Library, and bring any books that someone has asked to borrow!

        FYI, as of this morning we have aroung 145 books and growing.
        (SIGN UP TODAY!)

        If you have books that other members wish to borrow, please look
        at your list of books that others have requested:
        http://library.pdxlug.org/borrow.php?op=owner_reserved

        You can look at the books that you have requested to borrow from
        other members here:

                    http://library.pdxlug.org/borrow.php?op=my_reserved

        If you are not a member and wish to join, please send an email to me
        (at robbyrussell at pdxlug.org ) and I will add you to the library or

INTERNET/NETWORK INFO:

        Fireside Lodge has wired internet access and a Wireless AP
        and you can come with your wireless card and usually connect to the
        network with it. If you don't have a wireless card, you can always
        stretch a 6 foot cat5 cable to their plugs.

        As usual, the meetings are very informal.  Don't expect it to be a
        lecture-type gathering with speakers and such.  Just come and have
        some fun!

I'm not in the Portland area but I did have to transition from attbi.com 
to comcast.net. The mail server names for POP and SMTP have been 
changed and everyone gets the "comcast.net" domain on their userids. My 
user ID stayed the same and everything appears to be working normally 
for email. It's a pain though since I subscribe to a number mailing 
lists. At least Comcast is nice enough to keep forwarding email to our 
new addresses even if people use our old attbi.com domain. 

I'm assuming everyone will use the following email servers no matter 
where they are located geographically:

incoming (POP) server: mail.comcast.net
outgoing (SMTP) server: smtp.comcast.net

You can certainly pass through everything arriving for a namedvirtual
host or a port-based host to another host using only mod_rewrite and
mod_proxy.  www.stonehenge.com does that for nearly every hit.  Maybe
you should email me what you've tried, and I can send you some of the
configs from stonehenge.com.

I have opened the transition pages - with difficulty after many refreshes! I
suspect the servers are slammed.
Anthony has the servers right. In addition add netnews.comcast.net for News
Server
They also support ssl connection to the POP server (port 995)
All of my mail was waiting at the new servers. I couldn't get any from the
old.
The forwarding seems to work. mail sent to attbi.com or comcast.net comes
though to the new mail boxes.
I avoided having to change email addresses by getting my own domain name
from domainforte.com with email forwarding for $12.95/yr.

In-Reply-To: <1056984276.13803.5.camel@sparticus>
Message-ID: <20030630180335.2983.qmail@web40806.mail.yahoo.com>

I'm curious as to how to interpret free memory in
Linux. It seems as though memory gradually gets used
up more and more each day, until free memory gets very
small. I know this is not what is actually happening,
because even when only a small amount of memory is
free, I can open several programs, like OpenOffice,
Mozilla, Evolution, etc, and the swap file will not be
used.

Does Linux somehow keep old programs and/or data in
memory after they are closed, only removing it from
memory when it is needed?

How can I know how much memory is actually available?

I have attached the output from /proc/meminfo on one
server, which has 2 gigs of RAM and very little
running (Samba and Apache). I have watched memory
utilization grow slowly from ~10% to ~90% in a few
weeks.

cat /proc/meminfo

I know little to nothing about cable access other than I've found some
pretty nutty (and entertaining!) programming on late at night - will
Portland be able to see McMinnville cable access, or are they separate
systems?  And if so, when will your show be broadcast?

Hi everyone -

When I run programs under cygwin, they ring my pc speaker bell, even if
the sound is muted under windows NT. Does anyone know how to completely
disable the bell under cygwin? 

I put "set bell-style none" in .inputrc but this only disables the bell 
for bash, not for other programs like vim.

in my laptop.  I had a lot of trouble keeping a good signal level, and had
occasional driver hangs under RH 8.0.  (The same WPC11 card works fine in my
NT 2000 laptop.)

  I switched to an Orinoco Silver PCMCIA.  The chipset is well supported and
the card has an external antenna jack.  The Orinoco has worked fine running
earlier RH 9.0.  I've recently started seeing some driver problems on the
latest RH kernel.  Signal levels have been good.  I haven't needed to use an
external antenna.

You need a tool which will show you not just free memory, but what the
memory is used for: most of the memory which appears "used" but then
magically becomes available when you start another application is
used for disk caches. Linux will consume all available memory pretty
quickly if there is any disk I/O, and won't release any until it's needed
for something else (i.e. the pages are not marked as free but rather as
available for freeing if needed).

Hi Brent,

Local cable access is only available in the community that is served by 
a given cable company.  That being the case, the show will ( initially ) 
only be broadcast in McMinnville, and possibly in Salem.  I can make a 
tape available to anyone who wants to go through the process of airing 
it in Portland and can step anyone who is interested through the process 
of getting the show aired in their community.

Regards,

Salvador Peralta

Linux is pretty aggressive about using RAM to buffer data from disk.
Try using the 'free' command; it "displays the total amount of free
and used physical memory and swap space in the system, as well as the
buffers and cache consumed by the kernel" (the free(1) man page).

For example, my workstation at work has a half-gig of memory.
According to free, nearly 300 (293) megabytes of RAM is just cached
files. The stuff in cache can be flushed if the kernel should
suddenly need to allocate a big hunk of memory to a new process.

Subject: [PLUG] Onstream bankruptcy, what can I do?
Message-ID: <200306301149.AA219152640@opusnet.com>

I got an onstream DI30 drive off of ebay but would you 
know it, the company is bankrupt.  I've tried getting 
Verbatim cartridges through E-Bay but they were not 
new or at least they're faulty.  Since it's an auction 
I'm stuck with them, the moral is, I don't want to 
waste more money on bad media.  I picked up one good 
cartridge through issi business solutions where this 
company won't sell media for the drive anymore because 
of the bamkruptcy.  Is there a place to trade this drive 
in for credit towards another Linux compatible tape 
drive?  Maybe I should try to sell it at this point.
If I can't pick up at least three good cartridges for
close to or under $100 there's not a whole lot I can 
do with it.

I look at buy.com and they have media for the 25/50 units
but I don't think you can put those cartridges into an 
older drive.

I tried to go to dirt cheap drives to look at buying hard
drives instead of tapes but there site is down for 
"corporate restructuring."

I wonder about all media drive business as IBM has abandoned
their ATA hard drive line and people are telling me that
drives are not profitable enough.  I wonder what's going to
happen considering that no server works without some kind
of nonvolatile memory ( O.K. you can network boot a server
but you still have to have at least one that has nonvolatile memory ).

How can I combine two disks to a single (NFS) directory? Is this done
with RAID? Is there a tutorial available? I have a box with two hard
drives. Another box can be configured to use a NFS mount as an expansion
storage, but only one mount (it's a network appliance). 

Thanks!

Holger,

Look at the LVM stuff:

  http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/

Red Hat includes all the LVM functionality, so you won't have to
rebuild a kernel or anything. Sadly, however, you'll have to backup
your disk data, do some LVM hand waving, reformat your drives, and
then restore your data.

It works pretty well, however. I've got an 860GB LVM partition
(formatted with XFS) at work, and it works pretty well for both NFS
mounts and Samba shares.

Excellent! Thank you so much Paul!

It's a fresh install so the reformatting is not a problem.

Check out my LVM documentation here:

A cloven spoof?

"Spoofs" I think is correct usage. (If there is such a thing...)

I think this is either the reverse look up fail (ip to name) or there was

There are a couple hundred reviews at www.mp3.com of every model on the
market. It's not the best site for comparing features to see what's the
"best" for your use, however.

Rich,
I can't recommend a specific mp3 player, but I recommend the below criteria:

1. Requires no software, appears to your operating system (be it linux mac or windows) as a new file system (Best) OR at least has software for linux.
2. Expandable.
3. Intuitive interface.
4. "Drop" survivable.
5. Uses a generic USB cable.

Just some ideas.

Message-ID: <200306301524.AA533725404@opusnet.com>

I've noticed that 98SE's fdisk and Ranish partition manager
both doing something strange with partitioning.  Under Redhat
7.x and 8 disk druid picks up an extra partition before
each partition created with Ranish or 98 fdisk and Linux
fdisk will give errors about partitions not being on a 
cylinder boundary.  Why does Windows 98 partition 
differently than Linux?  Why do Ranish and Windows 
create a partition that is same cylinder to same cylinder 
before every partition according to Disk Druid?  Ranish 
can create Linux partitions, is this what an XOSL user 
should use to create Linux's partitions?  Can xosl allow 
booting from extended partitions and/or partitions over 
the 1024 cylinder boundary, I thought it could but I 
couldn't get any of this to work.

I just bought the Creative Nomad MuVo and I'm very happy with it.  It's
small enough to fit on my keychain and also doubles as a 128MB USB drive. 
There's no software or drivers to worry about.  You just plug it into your
Windows or Linux box, mount the USB drive, copy your files over, and any
MP3 or WMA files will be playable.

  Thanks, Erik. I was hoping for recommendations from those more
knowledgeable than I regarding those criteria -- for a linux workstation

I've been pretty happy with the new iPod. The default interface is
firewire, which works great for me (using a SIIG 3-port pci firewire
card, with the standard kernel module). gtkpod provides a useable,
albiet buggy interface(it crashes once in a while), there are a few
others, but I haven't looked into them.

The thing I dislike the most is the heavy reliance on id3 tags, I'm
not sure which version of id3, but I'm having a few issues with that.

Overall though, I'm extremely pleased. Battery life is great (haven't
measured it yet, but probably 8 hours+) it's very tiny, and holds more
than one CD of music, which is my main gripe with the solid state
players.

I figured it out.  Browsers use decimal for unicode.  So I would convert
243 in decimal to F3 in hex and then I can print the character:

perl -e 'print "\x{F3}\n"

Nope, it's actually a bounce.  Unfortunately, I cannot remember where
the docs are explaining it, and I lack the motivation to re-write them.

You might need to perform what my friend once called "active matrix
configuration"--take the case off and remove the connector to the
speaker.

Robby, would you guys PLEASE re-think the naming of your group? First you
pick our old group name (PLUG went by Portland Linux Users Group until
sometime around 1995), then you pick a *really* similar domain name
(pdxlug.org versus pdxlinux.org), and lastly you schedule meetings for the
same time as ours (I appreciate that the current one isn't).

As time goes by, and your stuff gets indexed in the search engines, this
is going to cause major confusion. Imagine someone searching for your
group on the web and coming up with our URL, our mailing list archive, or
meeting schedule - how do they know which is which? The fact that you're
posting meeting announcements on our mailing list will make things all the
more confusing.

It's not hard to come up with alternatives. Here's the result of 10
minutes of thought and a little web browsing:

Portland Linux Enthusiasts
Portland Linux Mafia
PDX Linux Group
Puddle City Linux Group
Stumptown Linux Users Group
NW Oregon Linux Users Group

How about it?

Dan

A Discman or other portable CD player.  Most will play MP3s from an
ISO9660 CD these days, at a fraction of the cost of memory-based
players.  None of them do Ogg yet, so I'm still SOL.

Why? Feel free to join the list and bring up that suggestion...but I doubt
that it'll hold much ground.

We changed our meetings to be the first tuesday of the month after our
first meeting which conflicted with PLUGs. It was a group vote to do so,
out of courtesy of those who are involved in both groups.

We've been in existance for about 6 months now, have about 100
subscribers, several sponsors, print material, our own bootable distro, a
large media library, our highly active irc channel, etc, etc...

Why doesn't PLUG change it's name?

Are you implying that the average person who looks up Portland Linux User
Group shouldn't see our name towards the top of the list as well?

If Linux has taught me/us one thing about our world...it's choice. Give
people a choice.

We're not trying to take away PLUG subscribers...and this isn't a
competition. Is it wrong to have more than 1 group in town? Is it wrong to
have more than 3 in town? Who cares.

I prolly would've joined your list if it weren't for the obvious silly game 
you're playing.  IIRC you left this list in a huff, can't remember the 
circumstances, but I'm sure it was a major deal at the time.  It's just too 
immature for me to go on.

Bobby and Dan,

Why don't you guys both come on my show and talk about both of your groups
this Thursday?  You can promote your installfests, get a copy of the
tape to air in Portland, and tell people about your success stories and
your experiences.  

One of my  guests fell through, but I am not ruling out the
possibility of having beers or dinner with one of the speakers at OSCON
after we tape.

This is a great opportunity for you guys to promote Linux and your LUGs on
a show with a highly agreeable host.

Subject: [PLUG] Red Hat 9.0 and Open Office
Message-ID: <20030701033743.6174.qmail@web10505.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi

I upgraded my 7.3 Red Hat Machine to 9.0.

Open Office worked fine

For some reason the x-windows server started acting
oddly so I reinstalled RH 9.0.  

Now the wheel mouse finally works fine, but the Menu
choices for Open Office Applications are about 4
inches high on the screen.  I use an ATI 32 Mb card
for video.

Has anyone else had a similar problem and what did you
do to fix it?

Thanks

Don

I was using port 995 for POP ever since the change from @Home to ATTBI 
occurred back in 2001. I use KMail and when I setup the account I had 
it check what sort of security was supported and used to most secure 
method available to me.

Not to mention the fragility and wastefullness of those (kinda) big
plastic disks.  (Not that I think Rich thinks twice about disposable
anything.)

And many of them have odd limitations like 256 tracks per directory and so
on.

Does anyone make a keychain-sized thing that is ID3-aware and has an LCD?

Ideally, I'd like something that understood m3u playlists.  That'd be the
bizormb.
