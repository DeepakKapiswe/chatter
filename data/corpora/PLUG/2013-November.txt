Last night about 12:15 am in the morning, I lost the Google DNS
connectivity for at least 1/2 hour.  Today, my ntp program is no longer
listing the alphabetical domain names, but strictly the IPV4 addresses. Did
something happen with the public Google DNS's ?

Seems to work for me.  Where did you get your v6 from?  Doesn't look
like 6to4 or Teredo.  A tunnel or Comcast/native?

Belay that.  Mozilla got "server not found" but chrome and wget work.
Pretty sure I turned ipv6 off in Mozilla to fix someone's broken ipv6

Subject: [PLUG] Disk partitioning confusion
Message-ID: <20131101220757.093aa8bc@Devil8>

Normally my good friend Mr. Google helps me, but this time all he has
created is confusion.

I have a brand new 4TB Western Digital hard disk (WD4001FAEX-0,
SATA-3, the expensive one ("Black") with 5-year warranty). I want to
format it as one partition ext4. I will never want to boot from this
disk; it is purely for data storage. 

I started with Palimpsest, which sees it (/dev/sdc), but can't seem to
do anything with it. So I installed Gparted, which offers to create
partitions, but fails. My confusion started when Gparted asked me if I
wanted a primary partition or an extended partition. In the end it
didn't matter, because Gparted failed to create either kind of
partition. Google has utterly failed to explain the difference between
primary and secondary to me. There is also the matter of GUID
partitions, which I also can't get a clear understanding of. 

My (dim) understanding is that the old 2TB partition limit is no longer
an issue since kernel 2.6. But that doesn't mean that the tools I am
using are aware that the limit no longer exists. 

I tried fdisk, which sees the drive (sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdc), but it
says that it is not suitable for large partitions and refers me to
parted. The man page for parted is too cursory for me to understand the
syntax. I think I need mkpart, but I'm not sure. 

I could use some pointers here.

Never mind. I tried Palimpsest again, and succeeded. At first
Palimpsest offered to make a partition (which it did not do before),
but the partitioning failed. Then I tried to format it without a
partition. Amazingly, it worked. It is now mounted and happy.

Thanks for the confirmation that it works for you.

The VM is hosted in the Rackspace cloud, so it's native IPv6.

I can't offer any assistance with Palimpsest; I don't use it and fdisk 
and parted have worked just fine for me so far.

What I can offer is a bit of information about the partition types and 
partition tables.

The disk partitions, as you know, segment the available space on a drive 
into smaller chunks of space. Initially, the primary partition was where 
the operating system was stored and how the system booted. There can 
only be four primary partitions on a drive, and only one of them as 
"active". Because this was seen as a limitation, by converting the 
fourth primary partition to be an extended partition and using logical 
partitions it became possible to have up to seven partitions on a drive.

The GUID partition table (IIRC) is the way a partition table is written 
to the disk and read by the hardware on boot. The original partition 
table was the MBR (I think), and was constrained to the four partitions 
mentioned above and cannot support filesystems above a certain size.

This is mostly from memory and may have some gaps or inaccuracies in it, 
but hopefully this provides a bit of insight for you.

Subject: [PLUG] Searching for reliable T60 laptop fan
Message-ID: <20131102224215.GA20509@shoshoni.info>

Hello list,

I'm trying to find a vendor which sells a reliable replacement fan
for an IBM/Lenovo T60 laptop, part no. 41V9932.  (Note that there
are two different, incompatible designs for the heatsink/fan
assembly in the T60).

The original fan lasted about 5 years before failing entirely.
The replacement I ordered from a vendor on Amazon lasted about 2
years before it stopped reporting the fan speed to the BIOS, which
caused the laptop to think that the fan had failed and would no
longer boot.

I recently ordered another fan from a different vendor which works
fine so far, but makes a high-pitched grinding noise when the
laptop is in "performance" mode as opposed to "cool running" mode.
It will also spin down for a second, then spin up to a very high
speed before leveling off, only to repeat the same about once every
second or so.

Since I keep my laptop in "cool running" mode 99% of the time,
it's working fine so far, but I obviously have a defective fan.
Some machine oil might fix it, but it's very tedious disassembling
a T60 because almost everything must be removed before one can
access the fan assembly so I'm going to live with it for the time
being (one must also replace the thermal grease on the CPU, which
is somewhat laborious).  Nevertheless, I would like to have a
spare on-hand in case it decides to fail at an in-opportune time.

Does anyone know of a vendor that sells a RELIABLE replacement fan
for a T60?  The two fans I bought were obviously not genuine IBM
manufactured parts, but I really don't care who the manufacturer
is so long as it's reliable, though it would be nice to get an IBM
original.  I see many vendors online offering a "genuine IBM
compatible" or somesuch fan, which obviously means it's a
third-party fan and also makes it difficult to find a genuine fan
via a search engine.

Any pointers or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: [PLUG] Mythtv questions
Message-ID: <20131102174317.18eced63@Devil8>

I finally did it. I bought an HDHomeRun Prime and I have it set up. I
also upgraded the RAM in the desktop that it will run on to 4 GB, added
a 4 TB hard disk (in addition to the two existing 320 GB disks), and
even a BluRay burner. However, after installing and spending a couple
hours trying to get Mythtv working, I remain puzzled and unable to get
the HDHomeRun working to provide me with TV. 

I also bought a plain rabbit-ears type antenna from Radio Shack. It
works great with my real TV set upstairs, so I assume it will suffice
for the HDHomeRun.

I should preface my questions by making it clear what I know about
television: There is a knob, usually on the left side and when you turn
it to the right it makes a click (turning the TV on), and if you
continue to turn it to the right the volume goes up. On the other side
there is a similar knob that makes clicking noises as you turn it to
the left and right, thus changing the channels.

That's it. 

I have recently seen a lot of terms like "NTSC" and "ATSC," among
others. I don't know what they mean, and I don't even know if I should
care. I was hoping that Mythtv would come up on my computer screen with
a knob on the left and a knob on the right, but no such luck.

So here are some preliminary questions:

1) When I run any of the GUI tools, is there a way to run them in the
window manager, like with a title bar and buttons, that I can move
around on the screen? Oh, and with the mouse working, too? Or a least
a bit of instructions about which keyboard actions do what?

2) I found a place where the GUI front end found my HDHomeRun and
set up its ID and IP address. But when I try to do anything I get an
error message "could not connect to the master backend server." What is
a master backend server? Is this needed for viewing S&M programs?
'Cause that's so not me and I can do without it. If I need it, where is
it supposed to be? How do I create one and tell Mythtv where it is
located? 

Oh, and I have Mythtv 2.0.25 on Xubuntu 12.04. Any suggestions
gratefully received.

Well, sort of. I still can't figure out the front end or what is wrong
with the backend server. But I found a program called HDHomeRun Config
GUI. It lets me select the HDHomeRun tuner, then click on Scan, and it
scans for channels. Amazingly, it found a couple dozen of them. And
there is a button that says View, which launches VLC and plays the
channel. I'm watching Rick Steves on OPB as I write this. 

I don't think this Config GUI tool is what I am supposed to be using to
watch TV, but it works.

Have you gone through the Myth config/setup? I believe if there's no tuner 
configured the backend won't run.

Check the logs. They generally have useful information.

You'll need program guide data. If you haven't already go to
 http://www.schedulesdirect.org/
and sign up. It's $25 a year, but it's worth it.

I am interested too.  I have a T60p whose fan is getting creaky.  I
ordered a replacement, but it showed up with not enough heatsink pads
on the heatpipe.  So, I put a drop of oil on the motor spindle and the
problem went away for 6 months.  However, it has been acting up again
recently, getting all rattlely, and a replacement wouldn't be
completely out of order.

So I was shopping on Amazon and decided to see what Newegg offered. I
opened a new tab and typed "newegg.com" in the URL bar. Up popped
Amazon's front page. I tried it several times, then in Opera, where it
always came up Amazon as well.

Then I googled on "newegg" and clicked on the Google link. That finally
brought up Newegg. It's good to see that they haven't merged with
Amazon.

John,

   Does it do the same thing if you enter the entire URL in the address bar,
i.e., http://www.newegg.com/ ?

   I always enter the complete URL and have not suffered your experience.
However, I've landed on several web sites that would not let me return to
the calling link when I use the back button. Serious PITA that is.

Portland Linux/Unix Group Meeting Announcement

Who: Brian Martin
What: Samba 4
Where: PSU, 1930 SW 4th Ave. Room FAB 86-01 (Lower Level)
When: Thursday, November 7th, 2013 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of technology freedom

See location H-10 on the PSU map at http://pdxLinux.org/campus_map.jpg

Brian Marin will talk about his early experiences with Samba 4

Samba provides open-source support for the Microsoft file sharing
protocol. Version 4 of Samba was released late last year. It represented
years of work and a major, some would say massive upgrade to Samba to
include the ability to be a fully functional Active Directory server.
Given the large scale changes, many people have been avoiding production
Samba 4 use while waiting for the bugs to be worked out. Brian Martin
has now started migrating production environments to Samba 4 and will
discuss his early experiences.

Bio:
Brian Martin is the chief consultant for Martin Consulting Services,
Inc. Martin Consulting has provided system administration services in
Unix, Linux and Windows systems in the Portland metro area and across
the country since 1996.  Brian is a frequent attendee at PLUG. His past
presentations include VMWare, production grade scripting, disaster
recovery experiences, Linux containers, and logical volume management.

Many attendees will break for a social hour at the Lucky Lab Brew Pub NW
at 1945 NW Quimby

I don't know what happened, but it stopped doing it. I'd still like to
know what caused it and what made it stop doing it.

Then again, I've decided not to buy things at Newegg any more. I only
bought from them once and I'm still getting spams from them in spite
of unsubscribing to everything I can find. That is not acceptable
marketing practice.

Okay. This isn't really Linux related, but it's something we need for 
MythTV, so unless there are objections I'm inclined to leave the thread 
on this list instead of moving over to PLUG-talk. If there are serious 
objections, then we can move over there.

I tried this one a couple of months ago:

http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/how-to/tv/build-your-own-digital-tv-antenna

I didn't have the right kind of washers and the wires kept slipping out 
from under the screws. But I have been a do-it-yourselfer for as long as 
I can remember. I was around at the dawn of skateboarding. (This is in 
the category of having to walk uphill both ways to school and back.) I 
made my own skateboard out of a 1x3 board and an old skate, the kind you 
put on under your street shoes. That worked well enough to get me 
started, and I've followed that philosophy since then.

 From tvfool it looks like I'm just under 15 miles from the towers. I 
got a good signal on my simple dipole when I first tried it, but now, 
not so much. I can get 23 channels, but not OPB or KGW.

Finally, a technical question: Is there something about a fractal design 
that improves performance? I can see how it saves space, but does it do 
a better job than the simple Vs on their sides style?

Also, is there anything important about the 1" spacing and the 120/60 
degree bends?

I'm guessing that what matters is that the wire is a certain length 
relating to some fraction of the wavelength of the signal. For saving 
space would any shape the wires took have the same effect, like a 
spiral, or a squared off spiral?

My wife used to do stained glass work and still has some copper foil 
tape. One of those designs talked about poking the intersections of the 
tape with a pin to make the connection between them since the adhesive 
on the tape is not conductive. I would think that a pin hole through the 
two pieces of tape would make a connection, but how long would that 
last. Wouldn't it be better to solder the two pieces of tape together?

I did finally get MythTV and my HDHomeRun working, sort of. That is,
the MythTV Frontend application refuses to allow me to view TV because
it complains that it can't find the Master Backend Server. But if I use
HDHomeRun Config GUI application I can find the channel I want and
click on View, and then it opens the channel in VLC. I should probably
figure out a better way, but at least I know the hardware is working. I
should probably start by trying to figure out what a Master Backend
Server is. 

I wanted an antenna right away, so I was limited to what I could find
in local stores. Radio Shack supposedly sells a dipole antenna, but
it's not in stock in any of the stores locally. I bought an "HDTV
Antenna" from them for $24.95. It looks like a fancy set-top rabbit
ears antenna. My first experiment with it was to see if it would work
with the television I have upstairs. It worked surprisingly well - so
well that I left it connected and disconnected the Comcast cable. Then
I went back and bought another one for the HDHomeRun downstairs, which
seems to work equally well.

The picture I get over the air is far better than what Comcast gives
me, although the signal sometimes breaks up a bit. There is a
12-position knob on the antenna and I found that I get improved signal
in different positions. I need to spend some time experimenting to find
out which position works the best. At the moment it gets channel 10-1
perfectly, and that's all I really want to watch anyway.

As for making my own, I considered that, but by the time I bought the
wire and spent the time putting it together I decided that it was
cheaper just to buy one ready-made.

Sounds like you need to go through the setup for the backend. This is 
what Galen and I were doing at the last clinic. I had the same error 
message before the clinic. Completing the backend setup solved the problem.

To run the backend setup program exit the front end by hitting <ESC> 
until it asks you if you want to quit. Select Yes, naturally. You are 
then back at the minimal Xubuntu screen. At the top left is a button for 
Applications. The bottom entry under that is System. The fourth entry 
under System is MythTV Backend Setup. When it starts up it warns you 
that the backend is running and gives you the option to stop it, which 
you want to do. Then you have the backend setup menu.

I'm going to walk through the backend setup, but it's more than should 
go in this reply. I'll post a separate message about running the backend 
setup this afternoon.

Yes. That is a very handy tool to see that the HDHomeRun is running and 
that you're getting signals out of the ether. While it's possible to 
watch a show that way that's all it can do. If you know ahead of time 
that you want to watch a show live, then it works.

> I should probably start by trying to figure out what a Master Backend

When you installed Mythbuntu it installed one backend server and one 
front end. In MythTV you can have multiple backends and frontends, but 
only one master backend. The one installed with Mythbuntu is your master 
backend server. If, for some reason, you wanted another backend 
somewhere on your network you would have to ensure that it was not the 
master. (I'm sure there's documentation for that, but I'm guessing you 
aren't planning on multiple backends.)

Basically, the backend receives signals, and does any recording, while 
the front end displays programs on your monitor or TV.

Two or three questions, depending on how you count.

The last windows computer in our mostly-Linux household has crashed and
apparently died. Does not pass POST, does not collect anything -
motherboard is probably dead. This computer was used specifically for the
entertainment center, to stream audio/video to our tv (which mainly has
functioned as a monitor) and stereo.

Main reason we had windows on that one was Netflix, which I long heard did
not mesh with Linux. In the last year I've been reading about Netflix video
playing capability on Linux (as at
http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/linux-and-open-source/how-to-get-netflix-streaming-on-ubuntu-1210/);
in the experience of people here who have tried it, does it work well?

I'd like to set up the new entertainment-dedicated computer (just
streaming, no games or such) as a Linux machine, sufficient for the task
but keeping an eye on cost. So: Any recommendations on where (in the
PDX-Salem area) to best look for such a beast? I know this sort of question
comes up periodically, but it's probably good to revisit it occasionally.
I'd be ok with installing the OS (probably Ubuntu) myself, but does anyone
have any cautionary notes about what to keep alert for, in addition to
Linux-friendy wireless cards?

Advice would be most welcome.

Subject: [PLUG] Running MythTV Backend Setup on Mythbuntu
Message-ID: <52798338.6060301@dicksteffens.com>

What follows is my experience running MythTV Backend Setup on Mythbuntu. 
There are plenty of items in the various screens that I don't 
understand, but I'll provide comments on what I do know, since it seems 
to be enough to have my system running, for now.

To run the backend setup program exit the front end by hitting <ESC> 
until it asks you if you want to quit. Select Yes, naturally. You are 
then back at the minimal Xubuntu screen. At the top left is a button for 
Applications. The bottom entry under that is System. The fourth entry 
under System is MythTV Backend Setup. When it starts up it warns you 
that the backend is running and gives you the option to stop it, which 
you want to do. Then you have the backend setup menu.

The setting choices shown below are for the Portland, Oregon, area. So, 
if you're reading this from another part of the world, keep in mind that 
several of your choices will be different.


1. Global

The first screen in the Global menu option is titled Host Address 
Backend Setup. I left everything on this screen the way it was.

The next screen is Locale Settings. While we just finished (in another 
post) talking about how we're now using ATSC instead of NTSC, NTSC is 
the correct setting for TV Format. I have VBI format set to none. I 
don't know what that does. Channel frequency table should be set to 
us-bcast. Your local time zone (for XMLTV) is set to None. Again, I'm 
not sure what this is for, but it's not something I'm using -- at least 
I don't think I'm using it.

I left everything on the Miscellaneous Settings screen as is.

I also left the entries on the EIT Scanner Options screen alone.

Ditto for the Shutdown/Wakeup Options screen, the Backend Wakeup 
settings screen, the Backend Control screen, the Job Queue 
(Backend-Specific) screen, the Job Queue (Global) screen, the Job Queue 
(Job Commands) screen, and the Program Schedule Downloading Options screen.


2. Capture Cards

Here is where you tell the backend what you're using to grab signals 
from the ether or the cable. You'll create a separate capture card for 
each signal source. For your HDHomeRun, assuming you have the one with 
two coax connectors on the back, you'll need to create two capture cards 
if you have separate antennas going into them. So far I'm just using one 
of them. Mine has the name HDHOMERUN:10102DC6-0. I'm guessing that I'll 
have another one ending in -1 once I put a second antenna on the box. An 
alternative would be to put an antenna splitter between your antenna and 
your HDHomeRun box, connecting to each of the inputs.

I'll walk through editing the settings of my existing capture card. I'm 
hoping that will be close enough to creating a new one.

On the Capture Card Setup screen the first line is for the Card Type. I 
chose HDHomeRun DTV tuner box.

The next line is for Available devices. I chose 10102DC6-0. The only 
alternative is 10102DC6-1. (I have my antenna connected to port 0 on the 
HDHomeRun box.)

The next three lines are information only, providing a description of 
the device, it's IP Address, and which Tuner you're using on the device.

Recording options gives you a new screen. I kept the defaults. Finish 
takes you back to the Capture Card Setup screen, and Finish on that 
screen takes you back to the Capture Cards screen.

If I understand the HDHomeRun Prime correctly it has three tuners in it. 
If you're using one of those you probably have to go through this 
process three times, once for each tuner.

<ESC> takes you back to the main backend setup menu.


3. Recording Profiles.

I kept the defaults for this menu entry.


4. Video Sources.

This screen is where you tell the backend where to get information about 
the programs available to you. You'll give the video source a name. I 
called mine HDHomeRun - Antenna. I don't know if I'll have to do this 
again for a second antenna, but I suspect I will need to do it if I get 
a HDHomeRun Prime box and get a cable card from Comcast.

For the Listings grabber line I chose North America 
(SchedulesDirect.org) (Internal). The User ID and password are for the 
SchedulesDirect account. As mentioned in an earlier post, this is a 
subscription service that costs about $25 a year. It provides the names 
and various other bits of information that they were able to collect for 
the programs. After putting in your user ID and password, select 
Retrieve Lineups. You may or may not see a popup window that says it's 
part way finished. I think that's okay. I'll come back to this later, 
because I think a later screen has something related to it.

I have an entry for the DataDirect lineup which says, PC:97045. That's 
my zip code.

Perform EIT scan is unchecked. I don't know what this does, but the 
default was unchecked, so I left it unchecked.

The Channel frequency table should be us-bcast.

Finish takes you back to the Video Sources screen, and <ESC> takes you 
back to the main backend setup menu.


5. Input Connec...

This takes you to the Input Connections screen. I have one entry, 
[HDHOMERUN: 10102DC6-0] (MPEG2TS) -> HDHomeRun - Antenna. When selecting 
that one I get a screen titled Connect source to input.

The Capture device is [HDHOMERUN: 10102DC6-0] and the Input is MPEG2TS. 
I gave it a display name -- which is optional -- of HDHomeRun Video 
Source. I'm guessing that name won't make sense when I get more video 
sources through HDHomeRun devices.

For Video Source I chose HDHomeRun - Antenna, and I left Use quick 
tuning at never.

The next two were confusing to us at the Plug Clinic. Thanks again, 
Galen, for your invaluable assistance.

What you have to do is select the first button, Scan for channels, 
first, wait for that to finish, and then select the second button, Fetch 
channels from listing source. I think what this does is to do a channel 
scan on the HDHomeRun, much like the one done by HDHomeRun Config GUI. 
Once it knows all the channels it can then make the connection between 
those and the programs listed by SchedulesDirect. Not doing these 
results in an error message when you try to exit the backend setup 
program, and is probably the cause of the error message about not being 
able to find a backend server when you try to run the front end. At 
least I think that's why I got those error messages.

Once the channels are scanned you can choose which one to start with. 
Once you're running the front end, when you select Watch TV, this is the 
channel that will show up first.

The next screen, titled Interactions between inputs, I'm pretty sure I 
left as it appeared.

Finish takes you back to the Input Connections screen, and <ESC> takes 
you back to the main backend setup menu.


There are three more entries on the backend setup menu, 6. Channel 
Editor, 7. Storage Directories, and 8. System Events. I have not changed 
anything on any of those screens.


Hit <ESC> to exit the backend setup program. When you do you'll get a 
warning reminding you to run mythfilldatabase on the master backend. 
After acknowledging that a popup window asks if you want to "start the 
mythtv backend?" I chose Yes. After entering my password I was asked if 
I wanted to run mythfilldatabase. Again I said Yes. You'll see a 
terminal window open and see that process running. It might take awhile 
because it goes out and gets a couple of weeks worth of programming info.

After that, go to Applications > Multimedia > MythTV Frontend, and you 
may be returned to your regularly scheduled program(s).

Several of us are playing with MythTV.

Check out our archives for various MythTV posts. (Okay. I just tried to 
check out our archives with Google advanced search and couldn't do that. 
Do we still have access to the archives? I thought there used to be 
instructions on doing that by putting http://www.pdxlinux.org/ in the 
site or domain box on the Google Advanced Search page.)

I'm not sure, but if you have a recent TV that supports HD I think you may 
want ATSC. I'd have to check my setup to be sure.

VBI = Vertical Blank Interval. Some places (used to) encode data in there,
like Teletext. Nothing here uses it.

Good choice. EIT is Event Information Table, which is program data that's 
broadcast as part of the digital signal stream, including upcoming shows.
I think it also includes the channel mapping data (For instance, channel 6,
KOIN, is actually channel 40. A channel scan will find the signal on channel 
40 and the EIT will tell the TV to refer to it as channel 6).

If you have any reception issues this can fill up your log files. :-(

I think all HDHomerun devices have at least two tuners. But some later ones
only have a single antenna connection with an internal splitter.

AFAIK, this is a misnomer. It seems to be more a source for video content 
information, not the actual video. I.e., what video is available and when.

No, not generally. There may be something here if you're dealing with multiple 
sources, such as OTA and cable on the same system, but I'm not sure. In most 
cases there's just one source of content info. I called mine "SchedulesDirect", 
which is might be a little less confusing.

This associates the capture card with a listings source, i.e., what tuner to 
use when recording video associated with the listings. If you have both tuners 
configured you'll associate both of them with the same "Video Source". That way 
it will know that for a particular show from the guide it can use either tuner.

I don't know all your criteria for success, so this suggestion may be 
off the mark, but have you considered a Roku box?

   http://www.roku.com/

For $80-ish plus shipping you'll get HD TV, Netflix, and other 
streaming apps. I don't think it can do YouTube, nor can it stream 
from a LAN-shared disk, but otherwise it might do the trick for you.

Roku boxes run MIPS-flavored Linux under the hood, but various web 
threads suggest that they aren't easy to hack.

There is no ATSC option to select in the list. There's stuff like PAL 
and SECAM and a few others, but no ATSC -- at least not on my Mythbuntu 
installation. NTSC seems to work just fine, though.

Thanks for the clarifications and additional info. I'm still relatively 
new to this, and happy to learn more as I go.

Hi

I use Ubuntu, 12.04,  to stream my netflix.   Not a problem..

I have a Belkin wireless router and a Samsung Blu-Ray player.

Never a problem

I left the SchedulesDirect lines empty, because I do not want their

Still not working. Same error message as before - cannot connect to
Master Backend Server.

Having gone through the above I notice that now I have a list of
channels in the Backend Setup utility: 6. Channel Editor.

Under 7. Storage Directories I had Default set to /media/Data (a 4 TB
drive). Just now I tried to edit this line, but it says "Enter directory
name or press Select to enter text via the onscreen keyboard." The
onscreen keyboard pops up, but is useless because there is no mouse. I
finally managed to get a cursor in the line and changed it
to /home/jjj/. There are a lot of other things to set directories for:
LiveTV, DB Backups, Videos, Trailers, Coverart, Fanart, Screenshots,
Banners, Streaming, and <Create new group>. I entered nothing in any of
them.

When running mythfilldatabase there are a lot of error messages
"content-type missing in HTTP POST, defaulting to
application-octet-stream." It seems to be trying to get the program
guide for the next several days or weeks.

Bear in mind that I do not watch TV much. And if I do I just turn it on
and find something interesting, usually channel 10-1. It is highly
unlikely that I would ever want to record a program for viewing later.
Nor would I ever want to view TV on any computer other than the one
MythTV is installed on. I wonder if I even need a Master Backend
Server. 

Also, the MythTV front end seems to run fullscreen with no titlebar or
buttons to change that, or mouse, for that matter. I dislike this
arrangement. Maybe I don't even want to use the MythTV front end.

It can however, run Plex, which can talk to your local NAS (I?m using FreeNAS) running Plex Server to index all your media.

I soldered the wires together.  Also, A sheet of aluminum foil as a back

Optimal position is about 30 ft above ground level to avoid signal
scattering. I can pick up OPB and KGW with the antenna new the ceiling
(7-8 ft up).  Also, I am on a bit of a ridge above the Columbia.

There's a bunch of mathematics re: fractal antenna designs. Heck, I've
forgotten just about everything (brain seems to be getting full...old
stuff drips out...).  The 120/60deg bends are particular to the Koch (ie
snowflake) fractal, other fractals will have other angles. The Koch is
the easier one to make. The 1 inch has to do with the fractional
wavelength, IIRC.  Fractals are nice since the have a very wide
frequency response over UHF and VHF.  As you so to higher Koch fractal
orders (more bends at 1/2 and 1/4 inch, it gets tricky.

Loops won't work: these are for AM and shortwave:

Yep, you can "tin" or brush a bit o' solder over the top of the
overlapping ends. Be quick so as to not melt the adhesive or substrate.

I have an left over thin sheet on Lexan I am hoping to have time soon to
paint on a nice 2nd or 3rd order Koch fractal for the that HDHomerun I
have my eye on, for when I get around to firing up MythTV.  In the
meantime, I might just run coax straight to each LCD TV.

A fair amount of the functionality of MythTV uses the schedule info.

Yep. The program guide is one of the things the database keeps track of.

Actually, what it sounds like is that your use model doesn't need 
anything more than HDHomeRun Config Gui and VLC media player. For those 
few times you might want to see a program full screen, VLC media player 
has that feature.

But, if you don't plan to record anything by program name, you probably 
don't need the functionality of MythTV.

The hdhomerun-config-gui does what I need, but it's a bit clunky and
hard to use; e.g., you have to type in the number of the channel you
want to view rather than just have a list to click on. I spent some time
today looking for alternatives to the hdhomerun-config-gui, but I
didn't find anything other than MythTV. However, I did find some
attempts at doing something similar to what I want with bash scripts,
and that got me thinking of the possibility of simply cooking up what I
need - except I know very little about bash scripts.

I wonder if the hdhomerun-config utility keeps a list of channels that
it found the last time the user did a scan. If so, and if the list also
includes the information necessary to connect to each channel, it should
be simple enough to present the user with a GUI list of the channels,
each with a Play button, and setting it up so that clicking on a button
sends that stream to VLC, while terminating any previous streams that
VLC was playing, or launching VLC if it was not already running.

Ditto.  At that time, I will be on a bus from Brooklyn
(where I will be visiting my supertechnologist gulag-
refugee friend A.B.) to Annapolis (for a niece's wedding).

If my inventor friend builds a star trek transporter,
I could visit him AND attend the wedding AND see Brian's
talk.  Samba is a magical bit of software, perhaps I can
use that to attend. :-)

Otherwise, a recording may be the best remaining option.

Here's a start. Mr. Google responded with these to the following foo:

hdhomerun command line linux

http://www.silicondust.com/hdhomerun/hdhomerun_development.pdf
http://www.silicondust.com/hdhomerun/hdhomerun_tech.pdf

Plus several others that look promising.

What's needed next is an understanding of how to program for a GUI. I've 
been taking pokes at it -- I wouldn't call what I've done so far a stab. 
But each time I find something I run into issues getting it to work. 
What would be nice is a start to finish, with pictures, of hello world 
in a GUI for Ubuntu 12.04 running with gnome-session-fallback. I've got 
a couple of Python programs I'd like to make work in this environment, 
too. If I can figure out what GUI development tools to use, and get them 
working, I could take a stab (instead of a poke) at scripting a TV to 
VLC widget. I think the command line options for the HDHomeRun should be 
able to be sent from a GUI widget.

The following command will do what you want:

    M-x write-region

You'll have to set the region first, of course.

   Thanks, Dale. I was looking for a key stoke chord, but this will certainly
do the job. I need to find a list of all these commands; the one I use the
most is M-x revert-buffer.

Much appreciated,

Portland Linux/Unix Group Meeting Announcement

Who: Brian Martin
What: Samba 4
Where: PSU, 1930 SW 4th Ave. Room FAB 86-01 (Lower Level)
When: Thursday, November 7th, 2013 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of technology freedom

See location H-10 on the PSU map at http://pdxLinux.org/campus_map.jpg

Brian Marin will talk about his early experiences with Samba 4

Samba provides open-source support for the Microsoft file sharing
protocol. Version 4 of Samba was released late last year. It represented
years of work and a major, some would say massive upgrade to Samba to
include the ability to be a fully functional Active Directory server.
Given the large scale changes, many people have been avoiding production
Samba 4 use while waiting for the bugs to be worked out. Brian Martin
has now started migrating production environments to Samba 4 and will
discuss his early experiences.

Bio:
Brian Martin is the chief consultant for Martin Consulting Services,
Inc. Martin Consulting has provided system administration services in
Unix, Linux and Windows systems in the Portland metro area and across
the country since 1996.  Brian is a frequent attendee at PLUG. His past
presentations include VMWare, production grade scripting, disaster
recovery experiences, Linux containers, and logical volume management.

Many attendees will break for a social hour at the Lucky Lab Brew Pub NW
at 1945 NW Quimby

If you are using Xemacs, the mouse has some really convenient and 
powerful features.

Hold the left mouse button down and drag to mark a region.
Press the middle button (or if you don't have a 3 button mouse, press 
both the left and right buttons) to paste.
After marking a section, press the right button to cut.

   Just as easy to mark a region (keyboard or pointy device), then press
ctrl-x w to cut and ctrl-x y to yank it back.

C-x RET r will execute revert-buffer-with-coding-system (there being
no plain "revert-buffer" that I can find).  The manual makes it plain
that the Emacs authors consider that command rather dangerous.  You
can use the  undo  command (C-_ or C-/) more safely.

You can get a list of keybindings with the command C-h b (or <f1> b).
Also, the PDF Emacs manual (which I consider easier to read than
the .info version) has the function/command and keybindings indexes.

Hope this helps.

That procedure works fine, except that it marks the buffer as
modified.  That can be fixed with M-~ .  So, being terminally lazy, I
created a macro in my .init.el:

(global-set-key (kbd "C-x w") 'copy-region-as-kill)

I do quite a bit of copy/paste, and this command makes things more
convenient.

kill-ring-save, which is bound to M-w (by default) does the same thing with
one minor change:

"This command is similar to `copy-region-as-kill', except that it gives
visual feedback indicating the extent of the region being copied."

(I'm also not sure where C-x y is defined for Rich -- C-y performs yank for
me.)

   Well, it is modified if I delete content.

   When I want to copy a marked block I use C-x w followed by C-x y. Doesn't
need an additional macro.

Thanks,

Rogan,

   You're correct on both points. I use M-w to copy marked block and C-y to
yank it. My fingers just do it so when writing my messages I did not report it

???

Do you perhaps mean C-w (kill-region)?  I chose "C-x w" specifically
because that key combo was not bound to anything else.  Also, while
kill-region / yank-region leaves the buffer essentially unchanged, the
buffer is still marked as modified.  That's why I created that little
bit of code.  I got tired of telling Emacs that yes, I know the buffer
is modified and no, I really do not want to save it.

Also, what is "C-x y"?  It's not in my copy of the manual.

   I'm so used to typing C-x C-s to save the buffer that I do it
automatically. I cannot think when I modified the buffer and did not want to
save the new state.

Thanks very much,

The first URL above gets me a PDF for the model that you have, but I
have the Prime. The second one got me a PDF with interesting
information about controlling the HDHomeRun from the command line. Most
interesting was the part about streaming to VLC on pages 8 and 9.
Unfortunately, I must have a different version of VLC than they used to
create the instructions.

Nevertheless, it occurred to me even before reading the above PDFs that
VLC has a fully configurable playlist function. All I need to do is
create a playlist item for each channel, where clicking on the playlist
entry makes VLC get the stream for that particular channel. If I can
succeed in doing that then there is no need for a bash script or GUI
program at all. I can do everything I want just with VLC.

Unfortunately, so far I have failed to figure out how to define the
stream for a given channel in a way that VLC can understand. The PDF
says "Run VLC: File, Open Network Stream. Select UDP/RTP. Specify port
5000," but when I open File > Network Stream I have no option to select
UDP/RTP or to specify a port. But if I go to View > Playlist I do have
the option to specify UDP<legacy>, although after going through the
screens various times I failed to get it working.

By the way, using my HDHomeRUN device ID 103D39F1, the command:

hdhomerun_config scan 103D39F1 /tuner0 ~/channels.txt

Produces a text file with the channels. Again, I fail to understand all
of the text file. Here is an example from it:

SCANNING: 683000000 (us-bcast:49)
LOCK: 8vsb (ss=60 snq=59 seq=100)
TSID: 0x0E1B
PROGRAM 3: 17.2 KWVT DT
PROGRAM 4: 27.2 RetroTV
PROGRAM 5: 37.2 Azteca

And so on for all the channels. 

I'm not giving up. I think it's possible to make a playlist in VLC,
it's just going to take more poking around before I figure it out.

I paid less than $10 for it and it's not worth shipping back to Newegg.

It's an ORICO PCI-Express (1 or 16) card that will add four USB 3.0
ports on the back of a desktop computer. It's for an older system that
does not have USB 3.0. It requires a Molex connector for power (the big
four-pin plugs that are about one inch wide).

I haven't actually tried it or tested it to see how fast it is.

With a DOCSIS 3 modem on Comcast's network, you get a /64 IPv6 address 
space.

You might want to check if your workstation has a global IPv6 address. 
If so, make sure you've got some sort of ingress filtering, either at 
your border router or on each host.

My router has a firewall. Otherwise, I don't know why I should be
concerned. I've used computers behind the router for over a decade and
there has never been a problem. My previous router didn't even have a
firewall, and still never a problem.

I am aware of the existence of /64 IPv6 address space, but I know zero
about it. Does this increase security concerns?

Even though your DOCSIS 3 modem might support IPv6 now, your router (if
it isn't very new) probably doesn't, so you *probably* don't have
anything to worry about.  But, IPv6 generally means no Network Address
Translation (the poor-man's firewall that has protected most people's
LANs for the last decade plus or so from connections from the outside,
as a side effect).  No NAT means your host's IPv6 address (if it has a
global one) is globally routable and anybody on the IPv6 interwebs can
reach your hosts IPv6 address.  Your router might now have an IPv6
address, but as long as it doesn't advertise it on the LAN, then your
internal hosts won't have a globally routable IPv6 address and they
are "safe".

Newer routers are probably going to start coming with IPv6 out of the
box though, so something to be aware of.

Run:

  $ ip a

and see if there are any inet6 addresses that don't start with 'f'
(fe80 is a local prefix, 2000:... or 2001:... or suchlike are global).

On the other hand, an attacker trying to scan your /64 is likely going
to wait a very very long time (2^64 is a LARGE NUMBER (not quite
avagadro's but in the general ballpark) and it will take MANY DAYS to
check all of the possible addresses).  

If he can find out your address though (e.g. by seeing some of your
IPv6 traffic), he can try to connect directly to your computer.  Your
computer is free to ignore him, but it might not always when, in the
fullness of time, you think it should have.  Hence the need for
greater firewally vigilance in the IPv6 context, or at least more
consciousness about host security.

Russell's response is quite good, so I'll just add a few other 
data to the mix.

My brand new ASUS wireless router runs Linux under the hood. It has 
the typical IPv4 firewall/NAT features and supports IPv6 via its GUI, 
but it provides no IPv6 ingress filtering.

It thinks it does. It's got ip6tables running with what appears to be 
a decent ruleset, but in reality the rules aren't blocking inbound 
traffic. (I verified this using nc to listen on arbitrary ports.)

I had to enable host-based firewalls to manage inbound IPv6 traffic.

Anyway, the lesson seems to be that if you've got a Comcast IPv6 
netblock assigned to your router, it's probably best to check that 
your firewall is working in IPv6 land as well as IPv4.

I have friend who used a lot of those boxes running pfense and had lots or
performance problems with any applications that required encryption or
decryption.  Also had a high failure rate.  Which wouldn't have been a
problem except they would fail in interesting ways.  Several couldn't push
10Mbe on one of their interfaces.  Wasn't a configuration because identical
models running identical code was fine.  Makes you look really bad when it
really is not the cable companies fault that you can't push a solid 3 Mbe
link.

FWIW, we have about 15 of them in the field since about 2009 or so.
We've had one failure.  Otherwise, rock solid for us with uptimes of a
year plus.  CPU percent utilization rarely goes above low single digits.

Of course, we are using a modern OS.  ;-)

Oh perhaps it was somewhat climate and housing related then.  I suppose it
depends on your use case.  If you don't cause any load on them I am sure
they are fine.

Which OS would that be?  There are many things that are great about Linux
but I find your use of the term "modern" somewhat confusing.  Whether you
are talking about the kernel or the user land would we really say that
Linux is modern?  Free, powerful, familiar, robust, ?  I mean of the
packaged router in a box systems I think it is really hard to beat pfsense.
 And I have used most of them.  That said if you are gonna do it all from
the command line it probably doesn't matter which one you use if it has
crypto library support for the onboard chipset.

The hope with these boards was that they had the cpu to do the vpn and
routing we needed at the time.  If properly tuned they would just get by.
 But given the hot climate they were installed in perhaps the case and
complete packaging where at fault there.

I mean they are sort of between a full PC router and a linksys class
OpenWRT box.  There was basically one OpenVPN setting that would work with
the on board accelerator.  The rest would work but could only push like
50-80Kbits between the links.  No crypto was 2Mbit as was the one
compatible library setting.

This borders on off-topic, but since Personal Telco originated as a
spin-off from PLUG, I convinced myself it's okay to skirt the edge:

Hello all,

I have not heard back from my potential AT speaker this month and I am
off to the Supercomputing convention the next morning on a
horribly-early flight.

Can I sway people towards an informal meeting at the Lucky Lab or might
another keyholder have something in mind?

One self-serving idea I could drag myself out for is a hackathon on
booting Linux in bhyve. I see that every distro does things a bit
differently and it's slow going to get them working. :)

All the best,

Were they using the older "wrap" board or the newer "alix"? The wraps did 
have reliability and performance problems. But we have hundreds of the alix 
3c/d boards in outdoor settings in widely varying temperatures runing Slack, 
and they have been rock-solid and quite speedy for us.

The older stuff, like the Soekris 45xx boards (133 Mhz AMD ElanSC520)
are super-slow on launching ssh sessions for us, like 30 seconds
regardless of link-speed.  Clearly some kind CPU issue.  Fortunately,
we only have a few of those floating around in the field, and we
rarely have to log in to them. ;-) Even the Soekris 48xx boards are
much better.  I think they must do some kind of NSA-offload (rot13?),
they encrypt super-fast!

Portland Linux/Unix Group Advanced Topics Meeting Announcement

Who: Rogan Creswick
What: Multi-App Security Analysis: Looking for Android App Collusion
Where: Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Avenue, Portland (Left Entrance)
When: Tuesday, November 19th, 2013 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of technology freedom

The Android permission model opens up a number of opportunities for apps
to bypass the established single-app permission checks that Android
users rely on to control data flow and application behavior on their
devices. I'll do my best to terrify the Android-using audience by
describing the attack surface for colluding applications and showing
interactive visualizations of multi-app data flow.  We'll look at the
Android permission model, the user-interface it results in, and I'll
show just how easy it is to make apps that look innocuous.

Bio:

Rogan Creswick develops unique tools and techniques for software
development and security analysis at Galois, Inc. His research interests
focus on improving the state of the art in software engineering tools
and user interfaces. His experience also reaches into the areas of user
interface automation and customization via integrated assistants and
automated documentation aides at IBM Research. He has striven to provide
natural interfaces to ease communication with complex and semi-sentient
agents through existing tools that have already become trustworthy and
familiar to their users.

Many will head to the Lucky Lab on Hawthorne after the meeting.

I run two Alixes (Ali?) as firewalls at two sites, both running a
stripped-down version of the CentOS 5 distro, and connected to 
each other, my outside servers, and road warriors with OpenVPN.  
I have not seen the failures Chris talks about, though I keep a
third ALIX ready as a spare, just in case.

I don't really know about performance.  They move unencrypted 
bits through the FIOS link just fine (15Mbps upload, 5Mbps
download, as advertised), and rsync backups over the VPN
from a server in California are just a little slower. 

The AMD Geode that drives these machines has an encryption engine
that OpenVPN is not currently using.  Perhaps that can help with
speed, if someone tells me how to engage it.  Also, in both cases
I shove all the logging bits (unencrypted) to local servers, so
I do few writes to the compact flash card I use as main storage. 
If I did more local read/writes, I imagine the ALIX would be a
lot slower and less reliable.

I am using "x133" CF cards.  8GB cards are $10 from Newegg, and
I only use about 1.2GB of that.  Are faster cards worth it?

While I do not need Yet Another Spare, it would be good to prove
the usability of these machines, so that more local users would
have them, and more people could teach me to do it right.  So if
anyone can suggest some easy measurements, or do them in their
own lab, perhaps we can demonstrate the quality and speed of
these little machines, either to convince others to join us,
or to find a better alternative.  Either way, we should use
what PTP uses, and leverage from their experience.

If I upgrade from an Alix, I would like something small, X86,
solid state, low power (4 watts or less), and inexpensive. 
I don't know of anything better in that class.

On the pfsense side there is one OpenVPN encryption setting supported.  It
is the difference between usable and usable encryption links.  Though it is
lower then the settings I would prefer for end users.  Seems fine for
running links across the cable companies network.

These guys carry a pretty good variety of small low power systems:

In brief, the firmware running the Infineon or Qualcomm voice
channel hardware on your smart phone is closed source, patented,
buggy and exploitable.  The article didn't say whether this
also applies to ancient dumb phones, but it is implied.

Which is why I won't buy a smart phone until I can program the
whole software stack.  Maybe never.  There will be other ways
to move voice that bypass the cell network, sooner or later.
I can wait.

BTW, I hope someday there will be a similar analysis performed
on internal firmware for magnetic hard disks, which may be my
own biggest vulnerability.  There's a lot of room for factory-
sourced mischief in the firmware boot and spare tracks.  Solid
state drives could be as vulnerable, but they are easier to
observe and reverse engineer with measurement systems,
spinning platters not so much.

Is there a tool out there that will make an mpg or other 'movie format' 
file from a sequence of stills?  I'm making movies in Scilab that I can 
only watch in Scilab.  I can export each frame as a gif or whatever, but 
I want to be able to compile an mpg, hopefully smaller than an animated 
gif, and distribute it.

Suggestions welcome.

Thanks.

Imagemagick tools can do this.

Thanks.  This looks like it'll do the trick.

Message-ID: <52880473.8000703@dicksteffens.com>

I want to copy music onto my new (to me) mythbuntu system 
(mythbuntu-12.04.3-desktop-amd64 on a Jetway ION-TOP). From the machine 
where the music lives I can see the Jetway. Using Nautilus I can open 
the Music directory on the Jetway. I can drag a folder of music from the 
source machine to the Jetway and watch the progress bar as the copy is 
being made. However, on the Jetway I don't find anything. I tried 
looking at the folder with Thunar and also with a terminal window, but 
nothing is there.

Any idea what I'm missing?

Also, Thunar appears to not include network browsing like Nautilus does. 
Is there some other way to sit at the mythbuntu machine and access 
another machine?

Dick,

   Try scp (secure copy).

My spouse is considering getting such a laptop and we would probably put 
OpenSUSE on it.  There's what looks like a really good deal on a Samsung 
Series 3 in town, but we've seen some scary articles about Samsungs and 
UEFI problems that rendered the machines unusable bricks - does anybody 
have any experiences with such?

-- Nautilus should work just fine for you in this situation. I came across
this interesting piece of information on a forum thread.

"*Note:* Nautilus works best in 'pull' mode, (that is) copying from the
remote PC to your local PC. In 'push' mode (copying to a remote host) it
will often replace file date-stamps (due to a Nautilus and/or SSH/SFTP bug)
with today's time/date."
