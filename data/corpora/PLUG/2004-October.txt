Hey, any of y'all do any math typesetting?

I started back to school this week and find myself in a position where I
should be emailing my proofs to my profs.

I figure PDFs are best, but I'll have to generate them in some relatively
fast way.

What do y'all use for equations?

I'm particularly interested in decent sigma notation, binomial
coefficients, matrices, and set notation.

Something with variable styles would also be great... it seems that
analysis and algebra want to use different symbols for the same ideas.

   Yup. It's all over my book, particularly in the chapter, "Introduction to
Fuzzy Sets and Fuzzy Logic".

   LaTex via LyX <http://www.lyx.org/>. Historically, mathematical
typesetting is exactly why Donald Knuty wrote TeX in the early 1970s.

   LaTeX does nothing without decency.

   Between TLC2 (The LaTeX Companion, 2nd Edition) and the 200-page pdf book
on mathematical typesetting by Herbert Voss (I believe) you can produce
output any way you want.

I've had a few calc professors that swear by html. Strange.
I've used maple, mathmagic, lyx, and even tried various equation editors 
that come with office products..
I'd say if you're doing proofs, lyx (or TeX in general) would be the way 
to go. It makes things very pretty :)

Hey folks-

Windows XP has been, to put it delicately, having its way with my 
sweetie for some time now. It's been causing him endless grief and 
heartache, and I've been a bit subtle about things like "You know, 
there is not a single distribution of Linux that requires this 
'activation' bs" and so on.

To convert him I need (Linux equivalents of) three things:

1. Quicken
2. Outlook
3. digital camera software (to import the pix from his Powershot)

So anything you guys can recommend (including flavors! I'm looking for 
Linux for TOTAL Windows users here) is greatly appreciated. I've done 
some web searching but I want to get opinions from some folks with 
actual mileage on these applications. Thanks!

I'm not really sure about this piece of software, but I'm sure somebody

   Personal or business? Gnucash for the former (it even imports the Quicken
file formatted data) and SQL-Ledger for the latter.

   GUI mail user agents? Thunderchicken ... er, thunderbird; sylpheed,
mozilla plus whatever comes with gnome and KDE. Text-based MUAs? Pine, mutt,
elm, emacs. All of these do Usenet, too.

   Depends on the chip. I've been using photopc with my Olympus since 1996 or
1997. I understand there's gphoto and at least a half-dozen others.

   I use both gnucash and sql-ledger. Just got going with the latter; it's
different from any other business accounting software I've used before, but
it works well. MUAs: I've used pine since I migrated from DOS to linux; my
fiancee has tried mozilla, sylpheed and thunderbird. She really likes the
latter.

   One of the problems faced by those considering defenestrating is dealing
with all the choices offered by linux. They become so used to using the one
choice bundled by Microsoft that it's frightening having to evaluate and
choose among many competing applications offered on linux. It seems at times
that there are too many choices. Regardless, they can be weened from the
Microsoft teat and learn to forage and fend for themselves with sufficient
guidance and a safe haven for those times the world becomes too frightening.

Ximian Evolution - which I'm using right now.  It doesn't have the new
fancy features of lookOut 2003 (the book-like reading stuff), but is
really a pretty good clone.

What Powershot model?  It looks like gphoto (which I haven't used)
supports at least a few of those.

If he has a fairly overpowered system... ie; half a gig of RAM, fast
hard drive, etc... Mandrake might be the way to go.  Or one of the
simplified Debian distros.  I, personally, like Slackware and Gentoo,
but they aren't for converts who don't want to really learn Linux.

David's comments are right-on.  gphoto (I think a standard GNOME
application) is a GNOME camera tool, for doing exactly what you ask.  My
wife uses it all the time; it supports Canon PowerShots pretty well.

Pen and paper most of the time :)  FWIW, math majors at Reed use LaTeX
these days (although I've heard alumni bragging about using troff).
OpenOffice also has an equation editor if you don't want to learn the
LaTeX markup and can export PDF directly.

Whew... after reading that, if I lived in Portland, Francesconi would
get my vote!  I wonder how expensive it would be to provide free
wireless Internet access to *all* of Portland... the infrastructure
alone would be expensive.  Then again, I suppose a vast number of
Portland residents are all about tax-and-spend.

I wonder if either candidate would actually have any luck converting the
city to F/OSS software, getting them out from under the Microsoft tax.

Mozilla?  Sure.  Firefox?  I wouldn't bet on it.

I'm running KDE at the moment... Konqueror and Firefox load up in
roughly the same amount of time (Firefox wins when it is already in
memory) and Firefox renders, IME, faster than Konqueror.

They both seem to use roughly the same amount of memory (Firefox
currently using about 10% more, but it's been open for a long time).

   What about Knoppix? Isn't this the distribution with training wheels? It
has the advantages of running off the cdrom before being installed onto the
hard drive. Those of you who've played with it can provide more insight.

   I am totally pleased with my move from Red Hat to Slackware but I concur
with Rob that it's not for someone jumping out of Windows.

Another trick that may do as a workaround is to use ctrl-l to focus the
location box and then backspace to clear it.  That way you don't even
need the mouse.

But I wonder why Moz/Firefox hasn't implemented customizable keys.

Unfortunately, you can't really secure a wifi network by blacklisting
(or whitelisting) MAC addresses as they aren't horribly difficult to
change.

Regardless, whenever I am in Portland with my laptop, I already have
access to a wireless or wired network for Internet access.  Luckily, I'm
not in Portland all that often.  :-)

City-wide WiFi is being considered/planned in other cities already. Here 
are a coupe of articles on Philadelphia's plans.

http://www.computerworld.com/mobiletopics/mobile/wifi/story/0,10801,96072,00.html?nas=MW-96072
http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/27/technology/27ecom.html?th

There are some caveats though that need to be considered. Here is an 
excerpt from the NYTimes that cites one example:

City government may be poorly suited to oversee such things as network 
security and customer service, he said. And with the advent of new 
wireless technologies like the Wi-Max standard, in which transmitters 
could send signals 30 miles instead of 300 feet, the city risks adopting 
a system destined for obsolescence.

Credit to Potter here, he was aware of Philadelphia's project and sees 
this as a bit of a contest between the two cities. In addition, he's 
been talking to Intel about Wi-Max and is interested in exploring a 
partnership with them to go with Wi-Max for Portland.

Except Wi-Max is a big, expensive, proprietary joke.

Funny, if that's a real goal, neither Philadelphias proposed network,
or any PDX network which may or may not be proposed, would compete on
paper with the size of what's already up out in Walla Walla.....

Ctrl-U still works here AFAICS.  I can click anywhere in the URL, and 
when I hit Ctrl-U, it erases to the end of the line.  Did I misunderstand
what Matt is doing?

I've seen this a couple of times after the apparently

 ./jbuilder
./jbuilder: error while loading shared libraries:

What's wrong? I get the impression that it's looking

   According to the map the coverage goes into Oregon a bit. This makes me
wonder if it's part of, or separate from, the network that Fred Ziara set up
for the irrigation community in Umatilla and Sherman counties. That was
written up in The Oregonian several months ago. It covers Hermiston,
Umatilla, Boardman and, I believe, Condon.

   Unfortunately, one needs to be a subscriber to have access. I tried the
last time I was out that way and could not connect.

   I did not know about ctrl-u. I just tried it with firefox-0.9.3 and it
cleared the entire line while the cursor was in the center of the string.

Tim,

   What do you get when you type "locate libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3"?

Doh!  It works here just as you describe.  I must have had Ctrl-K on the
brain.  Nonetheless, Ctrl-U does not bring up the html source.

That just gave me an idea: What if Personal Telco got permission and
cooperation from TriMet to install wifi points set up to run a giant,
seamless network along the MAX lines?  That would be a big win for
commuters, as well as being a nice, "Welcome to Portland, please enjoy
the scenery or browse the web on our cheap, efficient transit" for
tourists.

So for those of us out here in Wood Village, does anybody know who is
opposing vocal opponent of open source, Speaker Karen Minnis (R, Wood
Village)?

If nobody else is going to run against her, I'll run as a write-in
socialist candidate just to give her some opposition.

   Some D. He came to the door a week or two ago but I was working and that
gave me a good excuse to not listen to his sales pitch.

   Candidly, while the Rs have an appallingly bad platform the Ds don't have
a platform. What a mess!

Paul,

   You must have missed the article in The Oregonian not long ago about the
fellow who was mugged and had his laptop stolen by a couple of thugs who
watched him using in on Max. They followed him off the train and stole the
computer.

   Perhaps we don't want to encourage this even if it does expose more people
to linux.

There's a compat-c++ package somewhere that you need...

galen,

   It does here when the cursor is on the page, not in the URL box. I guess
that the feature has been removed in the newest release candidate. Since I
rarely look at page sources I don't suppose it will adversely affect my
viewing pleasure.

Fedora doesn't install it by default, even if you
select the "development" options during setup. You
have to find it on the CD (3). It's "compat-gcc..." or
something like that.

So, if you want to use Jbuilder in Fedora, you must do
this before it will launch.

Well, I don't know about Paul, but I'd rather not stop using my laptop
in public places for fear of being mugged.  Perhaps we should encourage
ideas of self defense and more stringent crime control measures
instead.  :-)

I am using Firefox 1.0PR too. What I have always done is not the 
cleanest solution, but I just double-click, then type or paste. I didn't 
know of the ctrl-u capability, so I am not feeling the pain of 
functionality lost.

WEBDAV is an extension of HTTP.  It uses a newer set of HTTP methods
to extend communication between a client and server allow them to have
better control over files while still using standard HTTP communicaton
and available ports.

I still think that for simple none client installed software to manage
it is your best bet.  You can read all about it here:
http://www.webdav.org/.  Also you can read about Apache mod_dav here:
http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav/  it is actually included in apache.

You clients will not have to do anything beyond creating the first
connection.  You can document for them how to do that with native
window tools.

I would think a couple of Thugs could see that anyone carraying a 
Notebook case around would probably have a notebook inside but maybe 
they need to see the actual system before they nab it, maybe they saw it 
was an IBM Thinkpad and not some crappy Dell or something.  There are a 
lot of people carrying Laptops around and it seems that they are easy to 
spot just by what type of backpack they have. 

Maybe some type of built in Laptop Taser would be the key here.

FYI: That was out near the Hillsboro airport. They didn't get his laptop,
but they did get jail time.

But that's why TriMet chapter 21 was overturned by the courts a few
years ago.  If someone even tried that with me, they'd find themselves

In addition to other people's recommendations, some cameras can be used as
USB mass storage devices and therefore don't require additional software.

For beginners, I'd recommend one of the derivatives of Red Hat Enterprise
Linux:
http://www.whiteboxlinux.org/
http://www.taolinux.org/
http://caosity.org/index.php?option=news&task=viewarticle&sid=34
https://www.scientificlinux.org/

However, Debian is my favorite distro.

Are you even able to find bullets for that or are you relegated to

I like my S&W .38spl snubnose revolver - loaded with 110gr silvertip

When you start the print process (ctrl-P. or File -> Print), a popup 
allows you to select the printer from a pulldown. Within the popup is a 
button for the properties, which includes a greyscale option.

   Thanks, Mel. I see that. However, it resets each time. Is there no way to
make my settings permanent? There is no option other than "default" in any
case.

Thanks,

Two comments here:

A wireless plan for Portland does not necessarily require city funding of
actual network administration or connectivity.  It could be handled simply
by supporting protection zones of some sort that encouraged public
wireless networks and developed a standard for identifying and networks
and their authentication.

Just because the city is working to make something happen doesn't mean the
city is doing it all by itself.  And after all, what is a city if not a
collection of people who live together working on common projects?

Second, what you call "tax-and-spend", some of us call "economy of scale".
We all pay a little to get a whole lot.  If you want stuff, it has to be
funded.  If everyone pays a little, you can not only get the fantastic
services that make your life easier, but also help other people to get
those same services and enjoy a similar quality and style of life.  That,
after all, is the entire purpose of civilization.  That ideal is implicit
in the move from the wild into society.

Oh, I think it could be quite easily done.  The question isn't one of
luck, I think, but raw determination and will.

The thing that REALLY stuns me is all the computers in places like the
library at PSU.  You'd think they'd be using terminals.

Hell, I have a course in a library lecture hall where each student station
has a ThinkPad (or similar, don't recall which model) bolted to the desk.
Why don't they have SunRays or some other simple technology?  Imagine a
smart student ID card that allowed you to use each workstation exactly as
you left it simply by placing the card in the slot (and optionally
entering your password).

Or perhaps we should make sure people have respect for one another and
aren't put in desperate situations where they must hurt one another in
order to meet their needs.

If everyone had a laptop, there would be significantly fewer laptop
thefts for example.

I guess the difference is whether you want to make life harder or easier
for people.

...except to middle-click paste, of course.  And there's also the
cases where I want to paste something into an HTML form field, such as
the Google search bar.  I guess I'll harrass the Firefox developers
and see if they can at least make it an option in about:config.

Yeah, I was certain LaTeX was part of the solution.  I just wanted to know
if folks were using LyX or something similar.

I still can't find anything on a current GTK+ LyX, though.

I'm looking at these and I don't see anything about popups. Are they called

A wireless plan may not - but I think a "free" wireless plan does.  I
suppose it would not be impossible some third party group would provide
the hardware, administration, and bandwidth necessary to provide the
entire city with a wireless Internet connection... but I would assert it
would be a highly unlikely scenario.

   Like the Loch Ness monster, it's a myth. LyX comes in two flavors: xforms
and Qt. The latter is much nicer. <http://www.lyx.org/>. Version 1.3.4 is
current.

   When you build it, specify "./configure --with-frontend=qt".

That would require installing a huge number of libraries for just the one
application.  Not going to happen.

Lots of folks provide free wireless nodes already.  The plan could be as
simple as coordinating, mapping, and applying the appropriate signage to
those zones and helping organizations fill in the dark spots all the while
advising building construction and renovation in such a way that future
wireless lines of sight are not obstructed.

Problem is, new terminals are almost as expensive as new PCs.  OTOH,
converting old PCs to terminals is incredibly cost-effective, but
spending less on IT this year means less money to spend next year.

Bah.  But PSU kindly provides many, many things to be peeved about.

Oh, ya mean like they've been doing at places like PARC for years?
I think that's what VNC was originally written for.

Next time I have time to indulge the playful side of systems
administration, I'll have to see if I can make something like that
work.  We've also got a few boxes of li'l xterms sitting at FreeGeek
and the combo might be an interesting thing to show off.

In this town of successful urban planning, decent public transport,
et cetera, look for the highly unlikely.  You are aware, I trust, of
the Personal Telco Project?  Also, have you taken a peek at NodeDB?

In a vain attempt to steer this thread back to actual Linux discussion,
let me point out that the ability to natively disconnect and reconnect X
sessions is one of the features under development by X.org.

Switching to Smart solves the problem. I spent some time looking for any 
mention of popups in the Konqueror handbook. Then, I spotted the question 
mark on the title bar of the settings window. When clicked, a question mark 
tags along with the cursor until some object is clicked, at which point a 
message box is displayed with some information. The word popup appears in the 
help messages for Allow, Ask, Deny, and Smart, and between them provides 
enough information to allow an informed choice. Smart only allows a new 
window to be opened if it is the result of a mouse click or keyboard action, 
thus allowing, for example, sites to open a new window when you click on a 
link taking you to another site, but blocking windows that are not directly 
related to the click. It works on the site I frequent that sends popup ads.

Thanks for clearing that up.

And all those coordinators, mappers, appropriate sign-appliers, and

Well, the coordinators and advisors would likely be folks from the public
who wanted to be involved in the project for some reason (enthusiasts who
just love having wireless nodes around like the PTP or industry folks who
are getting paid to make it happen so their employer can exploit the
system for profit).  And the signage application could easily be the
responsibility of those who maintain the node which makes sense because
they'll know best where to place the signs and how, exactly, the signs
should read.  Only the type and format of the information on the signs
would be city-managed and that would likely fall on the public
coordination body to set standards.

The entire point, of course, was that the cost of that sort of effort is
quite low in comparison to the cost of building a network from scratch and
maintaining it PLUS doing all those other things.

Remember that the INTENT of public agencies is to provide a forum where
the people of a common place can get together and make that place more
like what they want than it would be had nobody known what anybody else
wanted.  The "government" portion of that system is only a narrow slice of
the whole and, to my way of thinking, largely superfluous (though not
yet entirely so).  Not all public agencies govern.

Message-ID: <20041002213741.GB11926@merlot.com>

This seems like it might be relevant to a lot of us who run small
businesses and who may have fax machines connected all the time.

I joined the junkfax list when fax.com got my number while I was on
vacation and used a whole ink cart sending me junk faxes. Read up on
fax.com before you tell me how rich I should be from suing them.

But before you do that, read the linked articles and do your own
research, then MAKE THE CALL. The ink/toner/foil you save may be your
own.

Sorry for the non-Linux content. I don't subscribe to any of the
auxiliary lists for a reason. This seems really important, though.

Subject: [junkfax] To stop junk faxes, we need you to make a phone call

If you live in Oregon, please read this message and make a call to 
the number listed below. 

You may think your call won't matter. Trust me, it will. Most people 
never call so when a Senate office gets a phone call on an issue, is 
a BIG DEAL.

OREGON Senator Gordon Smith, is the author of a bill in the Senate 
that is going to make your junk fax problem MUCH WORSE.

I NEED YOU TO TAKE ACTION RIGHT NOW. It will take only 3 minutes but 
you'll save the rest of the country from this menace.

The reason is that there is a very bad piece of legislation that 
Smith is sponsoring entitled "The Junk Fax Prevention Bill of 2004" 
that, in fact, would do just the opposite! It will turn your fax 
machine into a printing press for businesses. That is why *every* 
consumer group and all the state Attorney Generals oppose this bill 
as it is drafted. But all businesses are FOR it because it would let 
them advertise to you for free, at YOUR EXPENSE!

We can't let them get away with this.

For example, please see:

http://www.junkfax.org/fax/action/JunkFaxBillsjmn.PDF 

for an excellent editorial (one of several) by the San Jose Mercury 
News regarding this mis-named bill and the reasons it MUST be 
opposed.

But it's MUCH WORSE than they wrote about in that editorial. For 
example, if you call Walmart from your home phone, this bill gives 
them the right to TRY TO SEND YOU FAXES at your home phone even if 
you DO NOT HAVE A FAX MACHINE on the line. So think of getting half 
of your calls at home at all hours from a fax machine where you 
can't even find out how to stop the calls since you don't have a fax 
machine on the line. Same story if you called from work!

But Senator Boxer (California) has proposed an amendment to Senator 
Smith that would FIX THIS BILL and eliminate this problem:
http://www.junkfax.org/fax/action/JunkFaxBillBoxerAmendment.pdf 

I need you to call Smith's office at (202) 224-3753 and ask to speak 
with Wally Hsueh (pronounced "Shoe").

Say something like this:

"My name is xxx xxxx. I am a constituent of Senator Smith. I live at 
xxxxxx. I am calling in reference to S.2603, the junk fax prevention 
act of 2004. I am outraged at this bill because it will increase the 
number of junk faxes I get. PLEASE ACCEPT THE AMENDMENT FROM SENATOR 
BOXER to fix this bill."

Of course, feel free to express your own outrage after you read the 
editorial.

I know you get a lot of emails, but I can tell you, this is only 
going to 50 people in Oregon and I need EVERY single one of you to 
call in order to make a difference.

If nobody calls, they will think nobody minds having their fax 
machines turned into printing presses for business advertisements.

Please call today!!!

Message-ID: <BAY9-F55Fs4iYRZTwRc0001a9b0@hotmail.com>

I have a bit of a off-topic question.
I have a very conventional setup at home.  A cable modem,
D-link cable modem router, and share the cable internet
connection amongst several PCs.  2 Windows and 2 Linux boxes.

>From one of the linux boxes, I want to be able to scan all network
traffic within my intranet.  So basically, I want to be able
to detect all packets travelling from my D-Link router
to each of the other 3 boxes from my linux box.
Is there a way for me to achieve this?

Thanks for any pointer.

Message-ID: <1096761674.32643.13.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

modify an ATX 400W power supply designed for an AMD K7
or Intel P4.  As the guy below says, there's no power 
switch built into an Enorex Microsystems PC164 
motherboard.  Why Enorex didn't include a circuit 
so that commodity ATX power supplies will work 
with their motherboard is beyond me.  

     --  Michael Robinson  



As far as I know there is not a motherboard connection for the power-on
function in the power supply (went down this same road <grin> and had to
reverse engineer the ATX power supply to figure out what was going
on...)...

If you check the power supply wiring definitions (use an ATX Intel based
motherboard for the pin defs) you will find one of the connector pins
(fourth over from the only 3.3V pin on one side I think) labeled
something
like DC_CTL or such - anyway, it is usually a rather thin green wire in
most
ATX power supply wiring to the motherboard - this is the DC power
control
line and when tied to ground will "turn" on the DC output of the power
supply (that is the method the ATX motherboards use to control the DC
power
to the system for power down operation). If you take the wire and tie it
to
ground you can use the power switch on the back of the computer case to
control the power (and it had the advantage where you or someone else
can
not accidentally power down the system from the front "pwr" switch
<grin>)...

Once you make your changes check the power supply outputs PRIOR to
connecting to the motherboard to make sure you have everything wired
correctly - nothing worse than letting the "magic smoke" out of the
motherboard because of a wiring mistake!!!

hope the information helps...

use a hub and tcpdump or ethereal to sniff the packets. switches use
mac adresses to selectivly send packets out certain ports. so you
would need a hub which just broadcast all net trafic to all of the
ports.  Maybe others know how to do it with a swtch.

Can someone tell me how gnome-ssh-askpass gets started when running gnome

at the beginning of my session.  Thus I'd like to duplicate whatever
is being done when running gnome.

[long letter from Kurt on junk faxes and legislation omitted]

I found a great contrary position link from an insurance agent
professional association:

http://www.piaonline.org/GIA/actioncall.shtml

It seems that Kurt was correct to be concerned-- this bill relaxes
restrictions rather than introducing them.  Despite what was said in
the quoted letter from Steve Kirsch, it seems unlikely that any number
of calls to Gordon Smith will change anything since he WROTE the bill.
 It's not like he's going to suddenly come to his senses and say "oh,
never mind, then".  However, he should know how we feel about it.

Instead, calls to Ron Wyden (http://wyden.senate.gov) or David Wu
(http://www.house.gov/wu) are likely to help.  Ron Wyden will know the
bill as S.2603 and David Wu will know it as H.R.4600.  If the bill
ever goes to a vote at least these folks have no vested interest in
having it pass.

When it is a per-thread variable accessed through a function with errno 
defined as a macro.  This is needed for thread safety.  glibc made the 
change in 2.3 which broke lots of software that assumed it was an int 
variable.  ISO C has always defined it this way.

Out of curiosity - how much did the Origin sell for?  If by some stroke

There is a good description of the ATX Mux connector at
http://www.compute-aid.com/atxspec.html

Basically you will need to short Pin 9 to pin 14 to "Power on" the power 
supply.

If you have a switch - use the machine you want to monitor the network as a 
gateway, so all trafic goes through it and then to your D-Link. Then you can 
use any monitoring tools you want.

Thanks very much for the tip.  That was enough to allow me to figure it
out.  Odd that I didn't find it with Google.  

In case it's useful to others, here's what I did to get askpass running
under xfce4:

The version of xfce that I have installed doesn't automatically start
ssh-agent, so I went to 
  http://cvs.xfce.org/viewcvs.cgi/xfce4/xfce-utils/scripts/
and downloaded version 1.27 of xinitrc and copied it to ~/.xfce4/

chmod +x ~/.xfce4/xinitrc

cd ~/Destop/Autostart

ln -s /usr/bin/ssh-add

Even if your application logs an error to a local file, the developer

either log4j or java.util.logging.

That would only work if your monitoring for trafic that needs to
routed to somewhere else.  If your monitoring for traffic between
multiple computers in the same subnet on your LAN then the switch will
just pass the packets to the machine that its destined for, after all
thats what ARP tables are for, right?

You'd need to mirror all ports to one port.. and put a sniffer on that. 
Most cisco switches can do this. You can get a 2900xl off eBay for ~$200.

Other than that.. a hub is really the only way, unless you ditch the 
dlink and put a freebsd or linux box there to act as the router. In this 
case, you'd see everything from outside->inside, but would miss internal 
computer->computer traffic.

Well, lucky me. My RH 8 box got hacked again. That makes Linux just as

But what happened? There is nobody who should be creating users named 
'luis' or 'dudu', but here's what I have in /var/log/secure.1:

Unplug from the net
configure IP tables
get chkrootkit - http://www.chkrootkit.org/
clean system
run rpm -Va and figure out anything that fails the comparison

that's a start

OpenSSH_3.5p1, SSH protocols 1.5/2.

Patched? yes, when I learn of the need on something. But ever since 
RedHat stopped free patch support, I've not been zealous about it. I'm not 
entirely sure it was ssh. Somehow, they added a user and rebooted.

Is your version of SSH uptodate? (what does `ssh -V' output? 3.9p1 is
the latest). If not, get current...

    ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/portable/rpm/
    (see the README file)

What does your Protocol param in /etc/ssh/sshd_config permit? You should
only allow version 2... `man 5 sshd_config'.

The first thing you need to do is make certain you've closed any holes
in your ssh installation. You can keep unwanted visitors at bay via
tcp_wrappers. e.g.,

    /etc/hosts.allow
    #insert ip addresses you want to grant access via SSH
    sshd: 123.123.0.234 192.168.0. 

    /etc/hosts.deny
    sshd: ALL

This allows access via ssh to 123.123.0.234 and anyone in the
192.168.0/24 (Class C) address space. `man 5 hosts_access' for more.

hth,

How do you figure?

It appears you were running insecurely configured services on your 
system. That's your fault, not the operating systems.

ANY operating system is insecure when it's operated in a manner that 
allows crackers to penetrate.

In other words, don't blame the OS when it's the operator that's at 
fault. Even then, it's not the "OS" that's at fault. It's the ssh 
service, or so it appears. Configure it so it's more secure, and this 
won't happen. Any time you are running a service on the internet, it's 
your responsibility to keep up to date on what vulnerabilities are out 
there with regards to what services you are running on your system.

Not trying to be harsh, but this is a common misconception.

WRT Redhats updates and whatnot, if you don't like how they are doing 
things, maybe it's time to consider a different distribution.

Since your logs indicate that this entire episode happened within the 
space of 10 minutes, I'd suspect it was a script. This indicates that 
the vulnerability that was exploited was well known.

   For reasons I do not understand I cannot directly download or view a pdf
file with firefox. The view/download dialog box pops up but the "OK" button
is greyed out and I cannot specify /usr/bin/xpdf to view nor a directory for
downloads. I've no idea what caused this as there have been no problems like
this before. In Edit->Preferences->Downloads there are no tools listed as
plugins for file action; that's greyed out, too.

   Any ideas?

Thanks,

Only as current as 3.5p1. I'll do this next... I just ran chkrootkit and 
it said nothing was infected.

Is there a way to automatically add IP addresses after 5-10 failed
attempts, or to rate limit attempts to frustrate scanners?

You might also add

AllowUsers huey duey luey

to /etc/ssh/sshd_config

This limits who (users) can log into the box using 
ssh.

I would also recommend a separate firewall solution.

I have a webserver on the internet, behind a separate linux firewall.

It's on a separate interface, so even if it's hacked, getting from there
into my home machines is a different challenge.

The latter would probably require some code changes in sshd.

The former should be possible with some log monitoring scripts available
out there.  Freshmeat and Google are your friends there.  :-)

No reboot required, but you need to restart xinetd for the mods to
etc/hosts.(allow|deny) to take effect.

Bill,

   No. If the daemon was stopped and restarted it will re-read its config
file. Rebooting won't do any more for that service.

Try typing "about:config" in your URL widget, and then 'helpers' in the filter
widget.  You should see a couple of mime type files.  (Mine are still on the
defaults of /etc/mime.types and ~/.mime.types.)  Do you have those files,
and does one of them include an entry for pdf?

Windows hacked 3 times, Linux hacked 3 times.

I suppose that's one narrow way to look at it. I'm just a little pissed
right now, and can barely contain myself. If I could afford the time to
learn everything an expert sysadmin knows, or the pay the six-figure
salaries to those who do, or hire a couple of assassins to whack a few
hackers and spammers, I'd be much happier at the moment.

By your logic, people who get hacked deserve it. That's like saying if you
walk down the street in Portland and neglect to wear your body armor or
didn't pay your protection money, and then get assassinated, well, heh...  
your fault, sucker! It's pretty intolerable. 

And don't shove that "If you can't stand the heat..." aphorism down my 
throat. I've had enough to gag on today.

But I really do appreciate the kind help I can still get from most people
here.  It gives me something to hope for.

   I have no /etc/mime.types but ~/.mime.types contains only Star Office and
OpenOffice document types. Strange. I just copied /etc/mime.types from the
tape restore. I'll see if that helps.

Yep!
Its not your fault.. you don't want to be an admin.

Nobody on this list will admit it, but RH/mandrake/etc are all as 
insecure as windows, because they try to appeal to users who don't know 
how to secure a box.
Note: I'l listing distros (that ship with a poor configuration), not 
saying "linux."

Other people have good suggestions... I just had to throw in my $0.02 
about rpm-baded linux being as evil as windows.

Actually, running a distro that was EOL'd more than 9 months ago is like
walking down a particularly bad section of town with $100 bills sticking
out of your pockets. But we all know that analogies don't work.

In addition to running a recent distro with security updates, here's a
few things you can do to protect yourself in the future:

 * Only run services you need. Verify that you're only listening on the
right ports by running 'netstat -nlut' or 'nmap'. nmap is best run from
a machine outside your network so you see what an attacker sees.

 * Use iptables to restrict access to certain ports from certain hosts.
I drop all packets not to ports that I run services on. This prevents
users (and therefore attackers acting as users) from running listening
daemons on arbitrary ports. Also use iptables (or tcpwrappers) to
prevent ssh access except from trusted hosts.

 * If you must open ssh to the world, restrict it to trusted users with
the AllowUsers line. This would have prevented 'luis' from logging in.

These things are pretty simple. Easy to do and easy to understand. In
particular, restricting running services to those you know and trust
keeps you from having to understand every piece of your system.

Basic security doesn't require a six-figure salary or an incredible
investment of your time.

I hope I have been helpful.

Actually, that's not what I took him to mean.  I sympathize with how you feel because I've
definitely been there, but consider the nature of the Web.  You probably wouldn't park your car
with the windows rolled down, keys in the ignition, in a dark alley in a bad neighborhood because
you have a reasonable expectation that you car is not going to be there when you get back.

That's the Web -- except everywhere is a dark alley in a bad neighborhood and there are usually no
witnesses.

Yes, the current state of affairs sucks.  The only people who are probably happy with it are the
well-paid security consultants and the black hats having fun.  Until a better solution is found,
we have no choice but to consciously lock the doors and pocket the keys.

Cheers,

You wrote that they rebooted your machine.  I wouldn't trust a damn thing
after a remote reboot.  They could have changed out the kernel, modified
wget or whatever you were likely to use to install chkrootkit, swapped out
the shell for something that recognizes chkrotokit's output and modifies
it... the list is potentially infinite.

You got cracked.  Assume every executable is tainted.  Rebuild the system
using fresh executables and configuration files where possible.
Configuration files that cannot be generated new should be inspected for
modification or compared against known good copies stored on another host.

Of course, I'd recommend a distribution that keeps on top of security
updates and isn't going to leave you high and dry when the shareholders'
opinions shift or the business model is made obsolete.

I've been running Linux servers for several years, and the one time I
got hacked was on a Red Hat (7.2) system, back when that version was
current.  So I feel that for security, Red Hat is not your best option.

Any system that's unpatched is vulnerable. Red Hat 8, which Red Hat 
stopped supporting on Dec. 31, 2003, is at best ten months out of 
date.

It's certainly possible to run an older version of Red Hat, but to do 
so you have to be willing to take on the responsibility of tracking 
all vulnerabilities and building new versions of packages for which 
exploits are available. It's not impossible, but it's a lot of work.

They dropped Red Hat 8.0 for lack of demand. They support 7.3, 9,
and just started on FC1. Before they dropped 8.0 they did release
some updates. So they would be worth applying at least.

Many times you can get away with installing RPMs from an adjacent
release. I kept a RH 7.0 system alive well beyond its official end of
life by applying security updates meant for 7.1. If that doesn't work
then rebuilding a package from the source RPM has an even better
chance of working when there's a release-version mismatch.

What do you mean "clean system?"  Once you're compromised, that's it!

Well, yeah, RH tends to trade off security testing for release

No, that makes Red Hat 8 as insecure as Windows, one of the reasons I
don't recommend people use Red Hat in general.  I suggest a distro
that doesn't put release deadlines ahead of security, such as
Slackware or Debian.

Is there any prior traffic from that IP?  I suspect there's some

If you haven't done so yet, take that machine offline, format it, and
reinstall from scratch, restoring user data from a pre-compromise
backup and getting the latest patches before you get that back on the
public network.

You're the second one to say that...

I think it isn't accurate, though.  Couldn't you verify the integrity of
the system by booting from a CD or whatnot and checking things, step by
step?

It may be *easier* to wipe and reinstall, but surely not a necessity.

I'd still say that reflects more on the person administering the box, 
not the OS involved. I can run a Windows box without it getting hacked.

Heh, I know many system administrators, and rarely do they make 6 figures.

Keeping up on security issue is a requirement if you are going to put a 
system on the internet. If you can't do that, then you shouldn't be 
running a system exposed to the 'net.

I appreciate that you are upset and frustrated at the moment. I'm simply 
trying to point out that choices one makes in both an OS and the 
maintenance of said OS are the root of the problem here. This is where 
choice of distribution can make a world of difference. One of the 
reasons I don't run Redhat is because I saw that maintaining a Redhat 
system would be more expensive (money AND time) than other choices.

I didn't say you deserved it. I said it's your fault. Big difference. 
You allowed a system with known, well documented vulnerabilities to be 
on the 'net. Given that situation, and the state of the 'net, it's 
simply a matter of time before someone stumbles upon your unlocked 
treasure chest.

Do you deserve it? Probably not.

Will it happen again? Given the same circumstances, I'd bet on it.

I'll bet. I would have offered more of the same. I agree with Jeme on 
this one. I wouldn't trust a thing on that box at this point. A hacked 
kernel can hide processes and do many things that I don't even like to 
think about. I'd nuke and repave that box before I'd let it anywhere 
near a network connection.

Then, make sure you change your passwords, since it's also likely that 
they took a copy of your /etc/passwd, /etc/group and /etc/shadow file. 
Given enough time, it's not difficult to crack passwords.

I'm sorry if you took my comments the wrong way. I feel very strongly 
that people should not run systems on the net without knowing what may 
happen, how to protect it, and how to fix it when it happens. The 
millions of Windows drones out there are the reason for MY irritation. 
Blaming the OS or the hacker is simply misdirection when solutions ARE 
available.

Yes, you could, but are you prepared to check every binary on your
system?  What about other binaries that may be installed?  Are you
sure you're going to be able to remove or even detect a compromised
bootloader?

Redhat 9 isn't that great in my opinion, but Fedora Core 1 
is impressing me so far.  The bios could be hacked, a 
bootloader could appear to be working normally only to 
trigger a hidden virus, perhaps in your hard disk's 
free space, at some point.  

There are tradeoffs, staying current in Redhat makes it easier
to get new hardware, direct from a manufacturer, to work.  With 
slower Linux distros, bugs may be found more frequently before 
release time.  However, if you have to deal with used equipment, 
you're still potentially up a crick without a paddle.

An old version of Redhat on a unpopular architecture, like
an Alpha, may be very reasonable.  I run Redhat without X
Windows, NFS, etc.  I suggest going to http://www.openna.com/
as this company used to put out books on how to secure Redhat.

As far as the board, it's about $25 if it isn't too old, to
replace the bios chip.  That's cheap.  Make sure you replace
the hard disk and any other media drive that a virus could
be hiding on too, unless you have a safe way to get 
these media devices low level purged.  Rehdat 7.2 isn't worth
it, RH 8.0 was a zero version and I never did much with it.
I'd say go to Fedora Core 1, Gentoo, or Slackware 10 for a
server.  If you want to do NFS, network filesystems, network
authentication, try to take advantage of the broadcast nature
of ip networking for better security.  My mail server isn't
on my public subnet.  Selective NAT has it's advantages.  
Learn to forward individual protocols and block access to
certain web sites even if you can't force people through 
a proxy.  For the latter, iptables and some fairly easy
bash programming is the way to go.  

What I would like to see is people who crack systems,
any systems, held legally accountable.  They should be 
pressured to explain what they did and in some cases  
they should be forced to offer compensation.    

The largest problems I see are in computer architecture, we
simply don't have decent equipment these days that we had
even ten years ago.  The 386's were better because the bios 
was usually a ROM.  What a novel concept, a ROM instead of
a flash chip.  The idea that you download a bios and flash
it has created many of the bios problems we have today.  
Add to this that most Antivirus software is woefully out
of date and tries to update itself over the untrusted net, 
some new ideas are needed and fast.

Some good news is that I'm making progress adding intelligence
to my mail server.  E-Mail systems are a favorite attack vector
for crackers.  I've figured out that certain sources will 5xx
off of me forever. So via some bash scripting, and a few common
Unix utilities including: grep, cut, and wc, I've implemented 
temporary ip filtering lists.  If the same ip 5xx's three times 
trying to come in, I start ignoring it for a while at the packet 
level.  Maybe this will, if I can make it aggressive enough, 
deter some crackers.  Most of this is junk mail coming most 
likely off of open relays.  One thought I'm considering is to
permanently ignore the ip address of any system that attempts 
to relay across mine.  I'm getting a lot of China something 
addresses.  Thing is, any cracker can get into a network and 
cause an otherwise trustworthy system to become untrustworthy.
Forcing unknown sources down to plain text is a thought, but
I don't know how to do that with Postfix.

One thing that bothers me a ton, proxies offer the potential
for better security and better use of Internet bandwidth, but
a lot of school and government web sites don't allow you to 
use one.  The site http://my.pcc.edu/ comes to mind.  The same 
seems to be true with http://banweb.pcc.edu/ and
http://banweb.pdx.edu/.  Maybe it's time to pass a law to
gurantee access to public sites for people who intend to 
work behind open source filtering proxies.  Having a web 
site go through clamav before it touches your workstation 
is a good idea.  Maybe if we want better network security
for the Internet, it's going to have to be demanded.

Well, you could boot from a known-good CD, check the size and MD5sum of
every binary on the system and then verify each directive in each
configuration file and carefully read every init script and then browse
every directory for hidden data and rewrite the partition table from a
backup and reload the bootloader... that would give you a very good chance
of nailing the bugger, but you could also be missing something.

The cracker could be more clever than you.  No way of knowing if you've
got it all, really.

If you run tripwire or the like and let it log to a write-only filesystem,
you can narrow down how many steps it takes to do the above, but I
wouldn't say you can be 100% certain with any such technique.

Russ, your quoting of my message left out a VERY important line:

   run rpm -Va and figure out anything that fails the comparison

That's verifies every installed system binary and config file on your
system and prints a list of those without matching MD5 signatures.  
To quote from the man page:

    rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]

    Verifying  a  package compares information about the installed files in
    the package with information about the files  taken  from  the  package
    metadata  stored  in  the  rpm database.  Among other things, verifying
    compares the size, MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner and group of  each
    file.   Any discrepencies are displayed.  Files that were not installed
    from the package, for example, documentation files excluded on  instal-
    lation using the "--excludedocs" option, will be silently ignored.

    The  package  selection  options  are  the same as for package querying
    (including package manifest files as arguments).  Other options  unique
    to verify mode are:

It's trivial to take the output and work through your system verifying things
like a failed MD5 sum on /etc/init.d/sshd is a change you made or a change 
someone else made. 

It's also highly instructive work.

If one is concerned about the integrity of rpm and the rpm database, those can
be reinstalled from CD before performing the task.

You're right, of course. Since I don't know how they broke in, or when
(really), I'm wondering how trustworthy my backups are now too. I guess I
just can't restore binaries from backup now. That suddenly increases the
job to reinstalling the distro from scratch; find all the patches to RH8
(which I doubt is possible for me) and install them; rebuild the source
code for the programs that weren't set up the way I wanted in the RPMs;
and then selectively restore data files from backup. Finally, I'll have to 
check all the config files...

Or I could spend the money to buy a new machine, and then I will be able 
to install the newest FC2 distro (which won't install on my current 
equipment because that old junk is too old.) Probably be a bit of a 
learning curve there too, and I'll still have to restore backups 
selectively.

Or I can switch horses altogether and install Slackware (for example) and 
have an altogether new learning curve.

All the while I'll be under constant attack by destructives more 
knowledgeable than I using automated hacking tools who will bring it all 
crashing down again if I miss even the smallest security patch or make the 
tiniest mistake in security configuration.

Restore user data from a pre-compromise backup?

Russ that's hysterical.  Text files and other user created data aren't a vector
for the crackers to get back into the system.

The insecure binary or config and the compromised binaries they installed
are the vecotr into the system.  Those and only those need to be identified
and replaced.  

If Bill isn't confident[1] that he can do that, a reinstall is a quick fix.
Considering user data as tainted is ridiculous.    

[1] Or if he is not confident but wants to learn from this experience.

Or you can install Debian, run chron-apt whilst you sleep and get an email
every day that tells you whether or not you have to upgrade anything.

As for configurations, Debian comes with sane defaults and doesn't
automatically start things that you didn't explicitly ask to have running.

There will certainly be a learning curve to the packaging system and a few
nuts and bolts re: the location of some configuration files, but most of
that you'll get no matter which direction you move.

Going back to RH8 doesn't seem like a smart move, though.

You can always bring the box down to the clinic and have someone help you
with the new installation and configuration.

I understand your reluctance to use Debian.  It really does sound cultish
the way folks insist that it's so wonderful all the time and that
everything else sucks by comparison.  My first impulse is to avoid that
kind of thing, too.  But in this case, we really are talking about
something that will give you what you want and not what you don't want.
And as much as I believe that diversity is the key to a healthy system
resistant to disease, I have to say that if you want a hassle-free Linux
system, Debian is the first choice.

Yes, this is flame-war country.  I'm not going to argue the point with
anyone, but in your particular circumstance, Bill, this seems like the
appropriate solution.  You want easy, reliable security updates, sane
defaults, you don't want to get left out in the cold, and you've got
oldish hardware.  So there's my advice.

They may not be a vector for further intrusion, but they might certainly be a vector for further
damage.  Imagine a subtle misspelling in your resume.txt*, or numbers slightly munged in key
spreadsheets.  There could be serious repurcussions from either, assuming the cracker had
bothered.  (Admittedly, most don't, but that doesn't invalidate the need to be careful.)

How are you connecting to the net?  Does your machine need to be
directly connected(mail, web, ftp server)?  Do you have a need for any
inbound service at all?  In any case, you probably ought to be behind a
firewall appliance of some sort(or perhaps you are and I missed it).  If
your net connection is cable or DSL, you should be making use of the
firewall capability of your cable or DSL box.  If you need inbound ssh
for instance, set up port forwarding and only forward ssh.  Then keep
you eye on the openssh web site, or better yet, read
http://lwn.net/Articles/ regularly.  They do a good job of pointing out
security issues when they arise.  If your needs are more sophisticated,
I'm sure Wil would be happy to sell you a firewall product.

You know, I've been reading through this "I've been hacked" thread with a
great deal of interest. I think hardening a Linux system is difficult work
-- you got to be smart and experienced (I know there's a contingent that
says it's easy, but I think this is like Tiger Woods saying golf is easy).
I've never been to any of the Riverside clinics. Is it conceivable to like
take a system there and get a security check? (I mean after we've done the
best we know how on our own).

Guess what? ALL of these were modifed on Oct 2 at 09:48, exactly when the
hacker got in, according to the /var/log/messages and /var/log/secure
logs. Why he hasn't done anything more nasty with his new toy yet I have
no idea. Or maybe he has...  I wish I knew how it was done. What good is 
it to restore a system that's so easily compromised?

Anyway, I'm going to move my mail services to my ISP's place and then I've
got to drop off line and waste the day repairing this mess. Thanks for all
your help! I hope to be back again some day...

I can't believe I'm saying this... but I think I agree with Jeme...
Debian might be the distro for you if you're looking for easy-to-
upgrade.  Slackware would be more difficult and isn't as easy to learn
if you don't want to learn to maintain a system.  Gentoo isn't all that
nice unless you have a 500+MHz CPU and 256+MB of RAM... pretty much
leaving Debian.

FWIW, both Debian and Slackware seem to do an excellent job of ensuring
their distributions *are* able to run on low-end and old hardware.  I
can't speak from experience with Debian, but if you install Slackware
10, it shouldn't boot up with exploitable services.  Upgrading Slack is
pretty easy these days, with slapt-get... but setting it up can be more
difficult than Debian, I think.

Bill,

I don't have any have any advice on your problem, but I just wanted to 
offer my moral support. I have been in situations like yours and I know 
what is like. It seems that most of the people that have replied have 
offered constructive help, and for the one's who haven't been, just 
filter it out and keep going.

Good Luck,

Jim

Not patently bad advice, but I'd stay away from firewall appliances.
Many of them have default passwords and are easily cracked.  A lot
of them don't have the scripting power necessary to do more
complex firewalling.  I for one am bridged, otherwise I would be
trapped in Microsoft NAT hell.  A cd booted BSD or Linux system
is probably better than most firewall appliances people buy and
a BSD or Linux system won't be proprietary.

With public subnets, for anyone who wants to run more than one
webserver or gateway at a single site, you can't use your cable 
or dsl box for firewalling.  I've seen some specialty hardware 
Linux NAT boxes, but not at a price level that's worth it for 
anyone who isn't making a lot of money.  I question the value
of these products if they're truly proprietary.

Note:  I've never known Redhat to pass rpm verification even
       when it's freshly installed.  That includes two boxed
       copies.  I seriously question the validity of rpm -Va,
       though on a hunch I have replaced packages in the past
       and it has helped considerably.

Sorry, blew it.  I have two imap accounts under evolution and I keep
sending from the wrong identity.  I've tried su'ing in a terminal to
run evolution as a different user, but that tends to break bonobo
or something similar.  Can postfix do source address correction?

Date: 05 Oct 2004 10:04:44 -0700


I don't have a michael user.  If you look at my website,
http://robinson-west.com, you can find a michael page
that says just this though without giving more than
the correct email prefix.

I greylist, some 450's are ok.  None of these are though.
I think a lot of these could be stopped with a spamtrap.
I'm wondering if I really need to get debian up to
implement one of those or if I can do this under Linux
on my existing Postfix relays?  A spamtrap is a high
numbered exchanger that 554's anybody who tries to
send email to it so long as the lower numbered exchangers
are available.  There's an RFC on this, though I'm certain
it's not 2505.  I could use the spam trap to generate 
ip block lists, not every spammer uses the same system
every time.  

I'm trying to do three strikes and you're out, but it 
might take days for the same ip to blow it three times 
and I only have one level of ip filtering, a three day 
level.  If you reoffend, maybe you should be ignored 
for three weeks that second time, and 9 weeks a third 
time, followed by a three month blackout for a fourth 
offense.  Longer blackouts raise the probability
of false positives, but surely I'll have to block some 
people long enough to get anywhere.  My algorithm 
should probably have a permanently blocked level, but 
I'm trying to be dynamic.  

One thought is to keep track of matching helos as well 
as ip and implement a bulk blocking trick.  The
secret is to get all of the ip's the offender is using
blocked at the same time.  Unfortunately, a lot of
spammers are smart enough to not use the same helo.

I've attached my first version of ip_block for iptables
and postfix-2.1.1.  It doesn't run as part of postfix,
but a cron job seems to do the trick.  I run it every 

six hours, but that was just a guess.  I would it to
work as a daemon instead.  I don't keep track of the
day a 5xx is recorded for possible ip blocking because
that would involve a full blown calendar, but the time
it takes to get someone blocked should probabbly be
used to determine how long they should stay blocked.

I'm after how to tune ip_block, whether to include some of
the 450's, and what difference getting a spamtrap up
might make?

Message-ID: <20041005173826.GA16651@gate.kl-ic.com>

Various distros have been suggested after Bill Thoen's rootkitting.
A week ago, I would have suggested Xandros as a nice supported 
Debian variant for casual users.  Not anymore, their automated
download is all older Debian stable, and does not have the latest
more-secure graphics libs and Mozilla and such.   While most apps
can be upgraded when they are stable and well understood, I expect
up-to-the-minute upgrades for critical security stuff. Worse, after
the most recent upgrade, KDE no longer comes up!  That isn't stability,
that is just sloppy.

One good alternative is Knoppix install-from-CD, followed by apt-get
to upgrade everything.  The Knoppix apt-get configuration seems to
pick and choose among the various versions of Debian.  It did upgrade
the critical Debian security libraries and apps to the latest secure
versions (at least after an apt-get dist-upgrade).  300MB of downloads!

Apparently, though, the install-from-CD version does bring up some
unneeded servers, like Apache and Squid and Tftpd.  I am taking out
some of the features not needed by the casual user, and learning how
to master a safer version.  Perhaps I will have some disks ready by
Plug Thursday.  Suggestions welcomed.

A middle ground between FC2, which will still give you end-of-life
problems next year and a whole new learning curve for Debian/Slackware
might be one of the Red Hat Enterprise Clones.  I grew weary of the
constant Red Hat version changes and finally installed White Box Linux
3.0 on my home system.  Aside from some mediocre USB support I've been
very happy with it.

http://whiteboxlinux.org/

It's pretty much the same thing as Red Hat 9.0, with updates.  Red Hat
9.0 was pretty much the same thing as Red Hat 8.0.

Alas, this is the state of the modern Internet.  I would suggest
investing in a hardware NAT firewall.  This simple step has allowed me
to be a bit more lax on some of my security updates than I would
otherwise need to be.  I've had good luck with Netgear firewalls, and
poor luck with Linksys.  Others' experiences on this list will, I'm
sure, vary.

Be sure to enable the local firewall during the White Box Linux
install.  This serves as an excellent second layer of defense to your
hardware firewall.  Finally, periodically run "yum update" and reboot
to fix any bugs that are discovered in things that you allow through
the second layer of defense.  These patches will likely be available
for four more years, subject to the time the White Box volunteers can
spend on it.  (If you want guaranteed availability, buy Red Hat
Enterprise and update contracts.  $180+ $96/year)

The combination of White Box Linux and a hardware firewall has been a
very low-effort way to keep the bad guys at bay.

Bill,

You had asked about an intrusion detection system that would 
automatically block people who were trying to compromise you. 
Portsentry can do this in conjunction with iptables; it detects 
nefarious activity and then writes an iptables rule to block the ip address.

Partially because of the recent cracking of Bill's system, and that it's 
  time to learn another distribution. I currently run SuSE 9.0 Personal, 
another RPM based solution. I have the fortune of having roughly 20gb of 
free space on my disk, that I left for future use. Currently can dual 
boot WinXP (but rarely do), or SuSE. Burned 
debian-30r2-i386-binary-1.iso cd last night. From what I have read, this 
should be enough to get a bootable image installed, then upgrade/install 
everything via internet from there. I plan to do this the next weekend 
that provides us inclement weather. Any caveats, cautions, insights, 
etc. appreciated.

You don't have to use GCC-2.95.3 to compile the

Anyhow, I compiled the 2.6.8 stock kernel with support

Ted,

   Get yourself a copy of Mick Bauer's "Building Secure Servers with Linux"
and read it. If you've read Mick's columns in Linux Journal the past several
years you know that he 1) knows his subject and B) presents it clearly and
understandably. It's an excellent textbook and reference for those of us who
use linux as a means to an end rather than as an end in itself.

Looks familiar. I would expect you could find a few new directories on
the system that you wouldn't see using the compromised tools. In my
case they had one masquerading as a header file in /usr/src/linux/include.
There were others, too.

When they cracked my system a while back they got in through an unpatched
web server on an orphaned release of Mandrake. I had decided that trying 
to rebuild Apache from source was probably as much work as upgrading to 
a current release, and they hit me before the upgrade percolated to the 
top of my To-Do list.

I'll probably be a bit more inclined now to go through the hassles of moving
to the latest release when the one I'm using approaches end-of-life.

I can't really fault Mandrake. When you're giving away most of your product
for free it's difficult to support the resources needed to maintain a lot
of legacy versions.

John,

   This brings up a very good point. The upgrade path for distributions must
be as painless as possible so folks have no excuse to not keep current. I
remember there were some problems moving from Red Hat 5.x to 6.x but it
wasn't too bad. Going from 6.x to 7.x generated weeks of traffic on this
mail list as folks had all sorts of pain. When I finally made the move, sure
enough, I tripped over a number of issues. I recall that there were similar
pains going to 8.x and 9.x; perhaps to the FC series, too.

   The only other distribution that I have installed and used is Slackware.
Started with 8.1 and moved seamlessly through 9.0, 9.1 and now 10.0. Even
the kernel is upgraded with no hassles. I understand that Debian offers the
same ease of keeping current. It's interesting that this aspect of
distributions doesn't seem to come up in discussions -- or flame wars. But,
in my opinion it's a definite factor in keeping a system current as well as
patched.

FWIW, I did a Knoppix install from CD a while back (circa July) and
after a few weeks it got wedged somehow.  This is wildly anecdotal and
not terribly helpful because I never figured out what went wrong.  I
ended up downloading the debian-netinst.iso (about 120 megabytes) and
reinstalled with that.  Everything golden since then.

I've been using this one:

  <http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/>

in particular, this one:

  <http://cdimage.debian.org/pub/cdimage-testing/sid_d-i/i386/pre-rc2/sarge-i386-netinst.iso>

I have had mixed results with the business-card images, which are
somewhat smaller, apparently with some of the base package
dependencies slewing out from under the installer over time.  That is,
it downloads some of the base packages during the installation, but
they fail some dependency.  The netinst.iso's (about 120 meg) have
been fine and still fit easily on my small 210meg CDRW media.

Which won't catch anything already installed, and what makes you think
rpm wasn't replaced with a version that gives the output the attacker
wants?  Once you're compromised, you can't trust any binary on your
system, and that includes RPM.

Yup, just lock and load.  You might want to read the instructions in
the installer as you go along just to be sure, though; it will make
you read a little bit.

That should work. However, it might be easier to use the sarge
"debian-installer" images. They're technically in pre-release, but I
haven't had any trouble with them.

http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/

Not only is the new installer easier to use, but it installs the testing
distribution, which is *much* more up to date than stable. I recommend
updating to unstable after installing (or during install if the option
is available) because it gets new packages and security updates a good
bit faster than testing.

I have heard that there are occaisonally package problems with unstable,
but I have not experienced any in the last two months I have been
running unstable. I strongly encourage running unstable.

Yeah, I've had problems with the business card (read: I've only ever

Yeah, the netinst is only twice the size of the business card and fits
on most mini CDs I've seen.  It's also considerably more robust than
it's business card counterpart: It'll install on most hardware.

One of the things that sold me on Debian, right there.  All it takes
to upgrade if you have a connection to the outside world or (if you're
insane or otherwise stuck) from the latest CD set:

# apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade

Give it some time to get the updates, and it'll set up the packages
for you (depending on your debconf settings, if you don't have it set
to noninteractive, it'll ask you some questions about how you want the
defaults set).

If you have cron-apt installed, it gets easier: You've already done
the apt-get update *and* already downloaded the packages as of the
last time cron.daily ran and you only have to do the apt-get
dist-upgrade part.

Debian actually does some usability testing on their packages *before*
they go stable.  So if you're running Debian Stable, you can rest
assured that things will upgrade smoothly.

Nice. Not unique to Debian though. Fedora is updated with exact same commands,
and so could RedHat, for a while. In fact, one of my FC1 machines haven't seen
the upgrade installer since it ran RH 7.2. apt-get took it to 7.3 then to 9.0
then to FC1.

I had a difficult time getting a Knoppix HDD install to upgrade
gracefully. I don't recall the exact errors (lots of dpkg failures),
but there were plenty. Copying the Knoppix CD contents to the HDD was
the easiest install I've ever performed (the CD has a handy script for
doing just this), but it doesn't appear to be a straight-up Debian
system (i.e., it doesn't appear to be any of the standard Debian
branches). I ended up wiping the entire box and doing a proper Debian
install.

The key difference here being that the Debian repositories contain a huge
number of packages that are built to fairly rigid guidelines and testing
specifications that go a long way to ensure that two packages won't ever
step on one another and have been made to play nice.

Uh, woah.

If it's a server on the real-live internet, run stable.

If it's your mom's/boss's/work desktop, go ahead and run testing.

If it's your home PC or you don't mind quirks and oddities on (admittedly
rare) occassion, run unstable.

The right tool for the job.

Indeed. There are certain aspects of systems that I like highly tuned to
my preferences, this takes a lot of time to do. Debian does a good job at
leaving custom configurations alone. Also by not forcing me to do a full
distribution update every 6 months, I can avoid even the limited damage
Debian's updates do.

Also there is the apt security repository, so those security updates are
*very* easy to do.

Unfortunatly this negates the factor of ease of distribution upgrade as
the unstable packages will occasionally be badly broken, not often, but
it does happen. This also greatly increases bandwidth and processor
usage, as the constant updates mean constant package downloads and
spending time installing new packages at least once a week. Most of the
time this isn't hard, but you do have to do it consistantly.

Paul (sorry) I haven't encountered a hacked rpm yet.  Certainly reinstalling

Every time I get three 5xx hits from a single ip, that ip gets ignored

like a number of the ip's in the attached file504 after two days of

a few days as I intended soon.  The purpose is to reduce the percentage
of smtp connections that are spam attempts.






A seperate problem concerning greylisting incompatibility...

I've noticed that the 450 records can tell me that aol users are not
getting through my greylist.

What's the easiest way to get the name of every single aol email server
so that I can bypass greylisting for them?  The command "host aol.com"
only gives four out of like twenty some odd servers.  The host command
doesn't reveal im0-m14.mx.aol.com for example as an aol mail exchanger. 
I had to manually vary the 14 to a number between 14 and 29 to create a
list of aol exchangers.  Is there a way in bash to use wildcards with
the host command?  I would like to do something like: 
host imo-m[0-9]+.mx.aol.com.  It would be nice to have all of the 
needed greylisting exceptions before someone important fails to get
through.

At http://greylisting.org there's a list of quite a few sites that
are incompatible with greylisting.  Anyone who is incompatible with
greylisting won't retry after a, "450, service is unavailable,"
warning.  When that happens, I'd like to at least send an automated
warning to the sender and the intended recipient (when the sender 
is legit and improperly blocked).  It is especially important to 
inform people who are on aol since their email service never 
informs them that their message didn't get through.

Has the standard of retryring an smtp transaction when you get a 450
gone by the way side?

The install CDs have a rescue mode.  Much of the restoration could be done
from there.

Most likely, you can't, without manually adding them from your logs.

There's no requirement to list mail exchangers when all they do is send 
mail. You only need to list them if you intend to receive mail at that 
exchanger. Most likely there isn't a complete list anywhere, except in 
the AOL IS department. They don't want you to know, because then people 
can attempt to use them for inbound email.

This is one of the reasons that grey listing is hard (read near 
impossible) without blocking at least part of your legitimate email. 
They can bring up a new outbound mail server without notifying or 
updating any externally facing records.

Now, checking with dig, I get a list of  four mail exchangers that each 
resolve to 4 ip addresses. That's 16 servers covered by 4 domain names. 
However, these servers are listed as mailin-??.mx.aol.com, where ?? is 
01 through 04.

Good luck!

You have to know what you're doing and you have to know the system
pretty well.  I've done it a couple of times with no follow-up
compromises (I didn't set the system up initially; I was called in to
clean up someone else's mess).

Thanks for all the help and advice on what to do after my machine was
hacked. It was an experience. Anyway, I'm back in the saddle, and would
really like not to get shot out of it again for few days at least. So how
do I secure this box once and for all? (Short of unplugging everything ;-)

This time I'm running RH9 and did a clean, wipe-the-disk-first install.
It's set up as a stock text-based server that I want to use for my web
pages, e-mail, and FTP site (using vsftp now.) I want to use SSH also. 
(and for those who know me, I AM running a firewall now...)

The big problem is that RH9 is old and there are some upgrades I need to
apply. The hardware is old too (P-II), so RH9 is as high as I can go in
the RedHat line. Above that, I get hardware-incompatibility errors during
the install. I'm aware that I should probably look at Debian or Slackware
in the long term, but that's a project for another day.

Here's my first problem. I've got the latest update for OpenSSH from the
Fedora Legacy site, but when I try to upgrade the rpms, I get a catch-22 
problem:

[root]# rpm -Uvh openssh-3.5p1-11.i386.rpm
warning: openssh-3.5p1-11.i386.rpm: V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 
db42a60e
error: Failed dependencies:
        openssh = 3.5p1-6 is needed by (installed) openssh-clients-3.5p1-6
        openssh = 3.5p1-6 is needed by (installed) openssh-server-3.5p1-6

Okay, so I then try to upgrade the dependency:

[root]# rpm -Uvh openssh-clients-3.5p1-11.i386.rpm
warning: openssh-clients-3.5p1-11.i386.rpm: V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key 
ID db42a60e
error: Failed dependencies:
        openssh = 3.5p1-11 is needed by openssh-clients-3.5p1-11

Arg! So how do I upgrade 3.5p1-6 to 3.5p1-11 when each rpm whines about 
dependencies on the other?

Try updating both of them in one fell swoop, as in:

[root]# rpm -Uvh openssh-3.5p1-11.i386.rpm openssh-clients-3.5p1-11.i386.rpm

I've been using a program called YUM for some time that will do the 
updates for you.  It is very much like apt-get for Debian.  All you have 
to do is install it and then issue the following command:

    yum update

It will find all of the latest packages and download and install them 
for you.  Check out the URL below for more info on YUM.

That'll work, if you install apt, apt-get will do this for you automatically.
However, rarely, it happens that rpm does not think that dependencies will
be satisfied even if you give it all the needed RPMs. Usually it happens when
some RPS are replaced by different ones or obsoleted (for example, there used
to be foo-1.0, libfoo-1.0, and foo-tools-1.0, now it's repackaged in foo-2.0
with some support libraries gone to a more general-purpose barlib-1.0).
In these cases, you have to force the installation, in no particular order:
rpm -Uvh openssh-3.5p1-11.i386.rpm --nodeps
rpm -Uvh openssh-clients-3.5p1-11.i386.rpm
Sometimes you have to do --force instead of --nodeps.
If you have apt, at the end of this process you can run apt-get -f install to
check that you've got all dependencies after all.

I think this is a little bit exaggerated. I'm not sure what others are
doing these days, but Mandrake provides updates for a year, or 18 months
if you don't care about the GUI desktop parts. Their release schedule
is every 6 months, so you can do it to yourself that often if you want to.

I'd be more concerned about the RPM database. If they changed that then
there'd be no way to know. It wouldn't matter if the rpm binary was OK
or not.

The easiest thing to do would be to install apt for Redhat. You can get 
it from freshrpms.net ( 
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/redhat/9/apt/apt-0.5.5cnc6-fr1.i386.rpm 
). Once that is installed type 'apt-get update'. Then type 'apt-get 
install openssh'. This will install the latest openssh and any 
dependencies.  You can also pull updates from the FC1 repo's if you 
want. In fact I have a system that was trigonally running RH72 that I 
have upgraded to FC1 (7.2 - 7.3 - 8.0 - 9.0 - FC1 ) with no problems 
using apt. Read 'man apt-get' and 'man apt-cache' for all the details.

This shouldn't be an issue. I am running RH9 and FC1 on two dual Pentium Pro 200's without any problems. The only issue I've had during the install is that one of them has weird scsi-raid card that has always given me fits, no matter what distro I was installing. I've also recently installed FC1 on a pair of Dell Precision Pro 400's (P2-450). This also went off without a hitch. There should be no issue installing RH on old hardware, other than speed/memory/disk space.

There used to be an RPM package for Red Hat that would allow you
to install an RPM database for all known RPMs.  So if you were concerned
about database corruption, you could reinstall that RPM and verify
against that.

Also, in an effort to keep updated, you might take a look at the perl 
script, autorpm. (http://www2.autorpm.org:81/)

It will tell you about updates daily. and allows you to install them 
interactively or automatically.

You should head over to http://www.fedoralegacy.org/ and follow their
instructions on setting up "yum" to update your system.  This will
help keep some of the more egregious security holes plugged.

However, as I mentioned before, I would have chosen an Enterprise
Linux clone rather than Red Hat 9 since the patching support for 9
is... patchy.  :-)  Red Hat Enterprise 3 is essentially Red Hat 9, but
with extended patch support.  It runs fine on Pentium II systems, and
even runs great on my Pentium Pro box.

You could get a known-good copy of rpm2cpio (and cpio and bzip2) and use
that to extract the contents of known-good RPMs, thus overwriting the
possibly-compromised files.

That debian reference is to check the packages, not the files installed by
the packages.  Major difference in the context of Bill's problem.

Subject: [PLUG] Help with Evolution
Message-ID: <1097092398.5973.64.camel@hermes.freegeek.org>

I really like a lot of stuff about Evolution and that is why I continue
to use it (that and the fact that it is *really* hard to migrate your
data to something like Thunderbird). I have to admit that 2.0.0 (my
current version) actually is a step backward from the last release
(IMHO).

But one of my biggest frustrations is the fact that there is no easy way
to edit any but the most basic Evolution settings.

Which gets me to the problem at hand, but first some background.

I am running Mandrake 10.1 Community and Evolution 2.0. I specifically
did not install the Epiphany browser because I don't like it. What I
hoped would happen is that when I clicked on an embedded link in my
email, it would fire up Konqueror, my favorite email cliient. Instead it
would start Mozilla.

Fine, I don't mind Mozilla that much.

So then I loaded Firefox. And when I started Firefox, up popped a dialog
asking if it should be the default browser. So I clicked yes, since I do
like Firefox.

And now I don't get squat when I click on a link.

So does anybody out there in the Collective Consciousness know what to
edit where to get me SOMETHING when I click on a link? I've browsed
through the .evolution directory stuff, but found nothing appropriate.

Check your GNOME or KDE preferences.  On FC2 at least, Evolution just
uses the "Preferred Browser".

'debsums' is probably what you (or whoever posed the question) is
looking for:

   Description: Verify installed package files against MD5 checksums.
    debsums can verify the integrity of installed package files
    against MD5 checksums installed by the package, or generated from
    a .deb archive.

Bravo!

In case you're interested, here are some Gentoo equivalents:

rpm                 equery (in app-portage/gentoolkit)
------------------  -------------------------------------------------
rpm -ql <pkg>       equery files <pkg>
rpm -q <pkg>        equery list <pkg>
rpm -V <pkg>        equery check <pkg>
rpm -qf <file>      equery belongs <file>

There's also an rpm-workalike called epm (in app-portage/epm). The 
following commands all function like their rpm equivalents:

epm -qa

epm -q <pkg>  # query package by name
epm -qi <pkg> # package info
epm -ql <pkg> # package file list
epm -qc <pkg> # package config files
epm -qd <pkg> # package documentation files

epm -V <pkg>  # Verify files in package

epm -qf <file> # What package owns what files

Subject: [PLUG] RH9, adding SCSI controller/tape drive
Message-ID: <20041006212047.37628.qmail@web53605.mail.yahoo.com>

I just added a tape drive and a SCSI controller (Adaptec AHA-2940UW PCI
SCSI Controller) to a Red Hat 9 server, but RH doesn't seem to see it.
The tape drive is the only device on the cable, and is set to
terminate. I've used an identical card and a similar tape drive on
another RH9 system, but it was in the computer during the OS install.
In this case, I added the drive to an existing system.

During boot-up, the BIOS sees the controller and the tape drive. Kudzu
found the controller, and I told it to set it up, but Red Hat doesn't
seem to see the tape drive (I would expect it to be /dev/st0):

# mt -f /dev/st0 status
/dev/st0: No such device

Is there some RPM or module or something I need to add for the device
to be seen? I've tried Googling, but I don't think I'm searching for
the right things. Any idea what I need to do?

Thanks in advance,

-Scott

Add this to your /etc/modules.conf if it's not already there:

  alias scsi_hostadapter aic7xxx

(Add the line verbatim-- don't substitute anything for "xxx".  I bet
that hits some spam filters...)

If you can, reboot to test that it comes up OK.  Alternatively, you
can run "modprobe aic7xxx" and you should see some hardware detection
messages in syslog.  Look at the contents of "/proc/scsi/scsi" (e.g.
"cat /proc/scsi/scsi") and you should see your tape device listed.

I don't know why Red Hat doesn't do this for you automatically.  It
really should, since it works fine on the initial install.

Usually it will, when you run Kudzu. However, if you have Kudzu
disabled at startup, then it won't. In this way, RedHat allows you to
control whether you want to autodetect new hardware at boot or not.
You can also run Kudzu manually at any time, and it should autodetect
the card and configure it.

Now, this being said, I prefer not to run Kudzu at all, and configure
all hardware manually. If you want to do it manually, you should first
try to load the right module, in this case the abovementioned aic7xxx.
If it loads,
then you can add the line to modules.conf, run "depmod -a" and you
don't even have to reboot. Note that if you already have a
"scsi_hostadapter" alias, your new line will look like this:
alias scsi_hostadapter1 aic7xxx
or scsi_hostadapter2 or whatever is the next available. These aliases
control the order of the host adapters, all devices on
scsi_hostadapter come before those on scsi_hostadapter1 etc. So you
can change the order, if, for example, you want a real SCSI card to
appear before SCSI-IDE emulation, but then some devices will change,
like if you have IDE CD and SCSI CD, /dev/scd0 will point to the first
CD on the first SCSI adapter, whatever you made that to be. Also, when
you install a module using modprobe, it always becomes the last
scsi_hostadapter, if you are planning to use different order in
modules.cont, reboot to get new device names in the right order.

We have a system here with the same problem.  I'm not the admin on the 
box but I have showed him how to get it started in a pinch.  I left it
to him to figure out how to get to start correctly and I haven't research
the problem myself.

We are using a symbios card that was stuck into the system for backup
after the OS was installed.

do
modprobe aic7xxx

This should start the driver correctly and load any other modules
that are needed.

I just wanted to say thanks to all of you great folks here who helped me
get my machine back from the clutches of 'luis' and 'dudu', the evil
script-kiddies. What a wealth of information this forum is!

Getting hacked is no fun, but boy, do you learn a lot! I finally learned
how throttle down ssh to just my user account and only from designated
IPs. I finally learned how to get an iptables firewall working (still
vague on tweaking it, but at I *have* a firewall now.) And I have learned
how to use apt-get so that updates are (so far) completely painless. 

The next step is to get some scripts that check the logs daily and alert
me to trouble before it gets its foot in the door. It was just luck that I
even found out about the break-in this time. If they hadn't bragged of
their conquest by tagging my web's home page, they could have used my
machine for free, and I wouldn't have known until too late when they
really started consuming mass quantities of resources.

My sincerest thanks to you all!

apt-get install logwatch

There is another script fwlogwatch, but I think logwatch is more full

I would also

apt-get install aide

and for iptables, I would recommend taking a look at shorewall.

Wil,

You may wish to add `rpm -Uvh' for updating packages. `rpm -i' lacks
finesse for packages already installed.

I'd go as far as to say that `rpm -Uvh' should be the "default
choice". If the package is not installed, it'll do the same as -ivh,
i.e. install it. The only time -i is essential is when different
versions of packages can coexist, and you want both. In practice this
means, when you are installing a new kernel :)

Ugh. No, I'm afraid it doesn't. In both the Gnome and the KDE prefs, I
have set Konqueror to be first to be associated with HTML files. The
interesting part is when I try to set it back to Mozilla, just to
get /some/ sort of browser up when I click on a link in a mail post, I
still get absolutely nada.

I've been searching the Novell support site (they consumed Ximian) and
haven't found anything there yet, either.

FWIW, I just switched the default to "firefox %s" and now Evolution
opens firefox (and a new tab if firefox is already running :-).

Debian unstable
Gnome
Evolution 1.4.6

There's a gconf command you can issue that either deals with HTTP URLs
or defines the 'browser' - I forget which - that Evolution will utilize.

Use Google.  If you can't find it, I'll try and see if I can find the
sucker.... but I'm pretty sure it was a gconf command I issued.

I just used some grepping to locate it...

rob at dell .gconf $ grep -R firefox *
desktop/gnome/url-handlers/http/%gconf.xml:<stringvalue>firefox %s</stringvalue>

Hope this helps....

   Or, 'rpm -Uvh openssh*rpm' and let the package manager select the order.

If only one user needs to use ssh, one might consider having the sshd run
with that user's uid; that way, if sshd gets exploited, the person
exploiting it can't get root unless there's also a local root
vulnerability. (However, I think that this also requires that sshd listen
on a non-standard port.)

As explained in other posts, the results Bill was seeing are correct, 
and the dependency checking is absolutely correct as well.

It was simply a matter of needing some instruction on how to install. 
Specifying both RPMs on the command line resolved the issue.

Nothing wrong with the package manager there. It was doing exactly as it 
was designed to do.

As a matter of fact, yes. The Mandrake CDs have a rescue mode that runs 
completely from the CD. Then, specifying the path will ensure that the 
binaries are running from the CD.

Not saying this is the correct thing to do, but it's possible.

I'd probably just get the data I needed off the drive and nuke and 
repave anyway. Otherwise, it's a long row to hoe and rebuilding the 
system is usually faster.

Erm, the st (ScsiTape) module?  Like, say, 'modprobe st'?

If that does it, add 'alias /dev/st0 st' to your modules config.
Likely, you just have to add it to modules.conf, or if your modutils
works like Debian's does, create a file with that line in it in
/etc/modutils and run update-modules.


Good luck,

Especially when you find a backdoor you missed.

Nuke and rebuild is the best answer.

There are few backdoors that can survive mkfs.

On a hacked system you also have to be aware of the "immutable" flag.

--force does not overwrite when that flag is set. (Not a Redhat problem. 
The filesystem is supposed to do that.  Debian does the same thing.)

"find" does not seem to have an option for finding extended attributes in 
an ext2/3 filesystem.  lsattr will do it, but is kind of brute force.  
(i.e. it gives you a lot of crap you do not need.)

Yes and no. Fedora is also doing a total of 18 month support for the
Fedora Core releases. Still I don't enjoy having to update and risk
having to fix things that often (yes, I'm lazy).

Subject: [PLUG] Am I slow?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0410070542090.28196-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

While fighting my way towards a Siesta (perl based mailing list system)
setup I ran into issues I don't have the time to resolve right now so I
decided despite my best intentions I'd install Mailman.

This is on a Fedora Core 1 Vserver and the software install went _very_
smoothly.  And so the story begins.  I'm stuck in a recursive loop now.  

<rant>
   Obvious python's structured nature doesn't apply to documentation.
</rant>

Doing it the correct way I start by reading the INSTALL.REDHAT file.  It
starts to make sense and I do the steps.  Part way through it makes
reference to doing some other steps in the README file.  I go there and it
says make sure you do all the steps in the INSTALL file before doing these
steps.
   Peaking outside my -- recursive -- container I read ahead in the
INSTALL file and find these lines.

2. Customize Mailman
 
    You should do these steps using the account you installed Mailman
    under in section 2 above.
 
Is it me, or what here?  I'm reading section 2 and I'm suppose to have
done the steps already.  Oh yeah, there is no 'account above' that Mailman
is installed under just a list main list created.

Is there a good set of instructions for setting up Mailman I missed while
searching the web?  (I'm starting to really appreciate the
'hates-software' site.  :-)


TIA,
Rod

No, you're not slow: Mailman can be a real pain in serial port.

- It'd be helpful to know what MTA you're using (Sendmail, Postfix, or
   whatever), because that'll impact your local setup.

- What version of Mailman did you install? The latest rpm I can find
   is 2.1.5-7. Is that close?

Creation of the mailman account is handled by the rpm. Actually, the 
mailman package has a ton of pre- and post-install scripting. To see 
it all, try

   rpm -q --scripts mailman | less

Mailman is so heavily tied into your system's web and mail 
infrastructures that it's difficult to guess what 'set of 
instructions' you want. I'd be happy to try to help, but specific 
questions would help me understand where you're stuck.

google:  search term(s) site:pdxlinux.org

Becuase the archives are publically visible, google has them.

Perhaps the problem is that I am running Evolution 2.0 under KDE 3.2. I
have tried modifying the line that AthlonRob suggested to both:

<stringvalue>mozilla-firefox &quot;%s&quot;</stringvalue>

and:

<stringvalue>mozilla-firefox %s</stringvalue>

with no joy.

This is frustrating.

The Gnome program to set your preferred applications for Web Browser,
Mail Reader, Text Editor, and Terminal is

Thank you, thank you, thank you!

And thanks to Keith & Rob, too!

Also, executing gnome-default-applications-properties from KDE didn't do
squat. I had to log out, log in under Gnome, and then execute it.

I try not to expose my stupidity too often to the list, but when I
really can't figure it out, it is nice to have folks who will help.

Glad (?) to hear that.  I've been doing system administration for nearly 
ten years and thought I had seen it all.  If there weren't deadlines 
flying around my head I'd sort it out myself but I was _surprised_ earlier 
this week with the date ... today ... fat chance now. (Oh yeah it's for a 
not-for-profit -- pro bono work -- so I'm not too worried about the 
slipped date.)

Well I'd prefer postfix since I'm trying to move to it from sendmail but 
neither is ativated yet, that is just a few key stokes away.  T oget it 
running I'll go the easy route.

Lastest from the FC1 legacy site this AM "mailman-2.1.5-6".

I tried Mailman once before and found this out.  It was going to go on a 
system that had several virtual web sites and one mail domain and one 
virtual main domain.  Its wants and needs scared me.

So far I've done the RPM install, and ran the commands

	/var/mailman/bin/newlist mailman

   (added the entries in /etc/aliases)

	/sbin/chkconfig --level 35 mailman on
	/etc/init.d/httpd restart

It (the basic page) shows when I try the web address.  (Sorry if I'm not
giving out the particulars but I fear it is still too unsecure/open for
public consumption.  :-)

I'm assuming I need to get postfix or sendmail going now but if there are 
other things that I can do first I'd like that.


Thanks for the offer of help Paul,
Rod

once.  This results in a bulk mailing.  I wonder if 
any of her other recipients aren't getting her 
messages because she emails in bulk?  

I check surriel and am wondering if I caused the 
blacklisting myself.  The other possibility 
is that mountng.kundenserver.de got blacklisted 
because of someone else on her network. 

Does she need to set up a mailing list and subscribe people to
it instead of sending out a bulk message?  I guess if there
was a way to offer a private reply-to address in the mailings
she would send out from a list-server, it wouldn't be too bad
an idea.  Has anyone switched from putting multiple people 
on the TO: and CC: lines to using a mailing list instead 
because of surriel?

Even if I stop using surriel, whose to say other recipients
she sends her message to aren't blocking it as well?  It's
valid email, I've attached the block that happened today.

If my sister is blocked, maybe other email isn't getting 
through now.  Is there a way to use a RHSBL more 
conservatively in Postfix so that the email is accepted, 
but routed to a  junkmail folder, etc?  I'm beginning to 
think that this is the more sensible approach to follow, 
at least for a reasonable length of time.

I need to get a spamtrap up, but until I modify the new power
supply for my alpha I'm kinda stuck.

Perhaps you also started mailman and just didn't mention it in this 
thread, but make sure the mailman service is actually started now, as 
opposed to slated to start at next reboot. :-)

You'll want to make sure that /var/mailman/Mailman/mm_cfg.py is 
seasoned to taste.

Then, you'll need to tell us what's broken and what's working. :-)

Can a postfix server only accept messages that fail helo testing or are
on a blacklist?  I question the blacklist's I'm using for accuracy and
want to use them merely as a starting point.  I also see a lot of
mistakes with helo testing.  I think spamassassin on a special exchanger
can help me determine what's really spam and what's a mistake.  I want
to see what I'm getting, but if I don't look, I want auto cleaning like
on anything that's two weeks old.  I'm thinking my alpha since there's
less chance of it getting a virus than a standard pc could be the
special exchanger and that this exchanger should be at the end of my
exchanger list.  I guess this means that I need to 450 invalid helo
and on blacklist instead of 5xx'ing.  Can I do the latter in Postfix?

Subject: [PLUG] Wine on SuSE 9.1
Message-ID: <200410071739.16283.rsteff.l@comcast.net>

I've been working with the SuSE 9.1 personal distribution since the clinic in 
September. I'm enjoying it, and KDE enough that I'm getting much closer to 
being able to abandon Win98 (I refused to upgrade beyond that). But I still 
have a couple of Win only programs I need to use, so I'm beginning to 
investigate Wine.

I see that Wine is installed on my system, and I've managed to locate the 
documentation at /usr/share/doc/packages/wine/. There is a directory there 
called doc-html, which contains three more directories, wine-devel, 
winelib-user, and wine-user. doc-html is set with permissions to 755 
(drwxr-xr-x), but the three directories it contains are set to 700 
(drwx------). Does this mean that there is some other way I should be getting 
at the user documentation in doc-html/wine-user, or is it likely an oversite? 
I've changed the permissions to 755 and am proceeding to read, but if there's 
a more correct way, I'd like to know about it.

Thanks.

Did you restart gconf?  I find a good way to make sure Evolution is dead
(to be restarted) after I stop it is like this:

kill `pgrep evolution`
kill `pgrep bonobo`
kill `pgrep gconf`

...assuming evolution is the only app you're using that uses bonobo and
gconf.  :-)

I think I'd do exactly what you did. Perhaps a bug report sent to SuSE

To fully stop Evolution, there's a (new?) 'evolution --forceshutdown'.
And you really shouldn't edit ~/.gconf files directly; use the 'gconf-
editor' or the command-line editor.

Actually I did along with postfix butsince I was concerned about security 
I didn't keep it up.

Been away for a few hours since I started this message and have made some
_interesting_ changes.  Got Siesta semi-working with aliases in the
correct postfix file so now I have to get the Mailman aliases in instead.

The Mailman web interface appears to be working OK though I have to do
some more testing.  I wanted to say thanks again for your help and getting
me thinking in the right direction.

There is a really handy python to Postfix plug-in that takes care of
the aliasing for you.  I don't remember the name or URL off the top
of my head, but Google is your friend.

Thanks, folks. I thought I had made it clear in a previous post that I
had gotten it working again. BUT, I didn't know about gconf-editor and
perhaps that can solve my current problem that ALSA stopped working when
I fixed the browser issue. Nope, it didn't.

OK, next question:

For some reason or another, sound stopped working right about the time I
fixed Evolution so it invokes a browser again. I have been using Alsa
for some time, but I also notice that lots of stuff depends on aRts.

I suspect that some symlink is pointed to the wrong spot or something
like that. I've checked syslog and Alsa seems to be starting nicely and
is currently running. But no sound.

Any suggestions on debugging?

1) Try playing a .wav file with aplay. Also, try doing this without any
other sound-using stuff running (e.g. end all GNOME/KDE sessions, press
Ctrl+Alt+F1 to get to a virtual console running [min]getty, log in, and
run aplay). This might help to find out whether it's a problem with ALSA
or some of the sound-using stuff.

2) Check the alsamixer settings. ;-)

You did, but I wanted to follow up the gconf suggestions specifically.

Check your mixer and make sure master or PCM isn't muted.  It starts
that way, although init scripts are supposed to restore the settings,
mine don't, and I don't reboot often enough to bother figuring out why.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0410081858290.28779@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Translating end-of-line characters between DOS and linux uses
dos2unix/unix2dos on Red Hat and fromdos/todos in Slackware. I know from
years of experience that x2x works fast. But, I just tried converting a
104-line html file from DOS to UNIX using 'fromdos' in Slackware. The
application apparently hangs and nothing is done when I kill it.

   Has anyone else experienced this?

   I do believe that dos2unix/unix2dos is available as source so I might just
build and use that.

Thanks,

TIFF can handle multiple layers and alpha channels and anything else
PSD can do. In fact, saving from Photoshop as TIFF results in no loss
of information whatsoever. Now, not every application can handle
multi-layered TIFFs, on Linux most apps use imlib, I don't know how
well it handles complex TIFFs.

GIMP has its own file format, of course, and it can save layers and
channels and other stuff.

On the suse-kde newsgroup, sound has been brought up frequently. IIRC, 
KMix, and KAMix need to be ran and settings adjusted.

   Thanks very much, Fedor. I was looking at Web site templates and
discovered that many of the free ones are a single .psd image. Anyway, after
thinking about it, I decided that I'd take the manual route to re-doing my
Web site.

If you figured out why this wasn't working then just skip onto the next
message, otherwise, did you check to make sure those two scripts were
+x?  If they are then try /etc/rc.d/rc.gpm start from the command line
and see what happens.  It should fire up gpm and /etc/rc.d/rc.gpm stop
should kill it.

Thank you, Mel, Wil, & Andrew!

The sound was muted. But how? Why? Enquiring Minds Want To Know?

But I've got sound back and I am happy.

I'm in a situation where I need to copy a directory tree over the
network and on to a vfat partition. I don't have a cdrom, just a floppy
drive. I don't have an OS on the system.

It would be easiest to use scp, but I suppose a recursive ftp transfer
or nfs mount would also work. What is there out there that does the job?

Thanks,

I'd suggest picking up a CD-ROM drive at FreeGeek, but they're closed
today.  Doing it with a floppy is an interesting challenge, since I've
yet to find a floppy distro that has ssh/scp.  But Tomsrtbt has nc,
which can be used to pipe data over the net.

So you might create the VFAT filesystem however you like, boot
tomsrtbt, bring up networking, change to the destination directory and
run 'nc -l -p 2323 | tar -zvx'

On the machine with the data, run 
'tar -zvc <source-dir> | nc -q 10 <target-ip> 2323' and the directory
will wing its way across the network.

I just tried this between two Debian systems, Your Distro May Vary.

Wonderful! Brilliant!

The tar on tomsrtbt is a little odd, so I had to do this instead:

 # nc -l -p 2323 | gunzip | tar -xfv -

Thanks so much!

   I have a stylesheet (pagestyle.css) file that defines color and typeface
for paragraphs, headings and attributes (such as bold). But, those styles
are not displayed on the page.

   Within the <head></head> tags I have:
   <link href="pagestyle.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css />

and this file contains:

h1 {color: #669933; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif}
h2 {color: #000066; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif}
p {color: #006600; font-family: garamond, times, serif}
b {color: #ff9900}

   What have I missed in having these styles applied to the text on the page?

TIA,

Rich

You need to close the quote in the link tag's type attribute (is that 
a cut-and-paste error?).

Also, the href="pagestyle.css" indicates that the stylesheet is in the 
same directory as the html file that calls it. Is that correct?

Finally, I haven't checked the css spec, but don't you need a 
semi-colon at the end of each declaration? (I.e., are you sure you can 
skip the semi-colon when it's the last one in a bracketed set?)

   Thanks, Paul. They're probably all legitimate errors.

Subject: [PLUG] Comcast email fails helo checking...
Message-ID: <1097388160.9355.30.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Okay, why is a major Internet service provider not listing it's
mail server publicly?  I'm starting to think that a lot of legitimate
email sources are purposely not dns registered.  Who got the bright
idea to do this?  You don't protect an Internet connected email server
by not listing it, you program it not to relay.  If every legitimate 
email server out there today were to be properly registered with an A
record, would there be enough names to go around or not?  The 
only solution I've come up with that makes sense is a trap that 
doesn't check the helo or blacklists down low on my exchanger 
list.  Course, this means using four global ip's so that I can fend
off spammers that tend to gravitate toward my lowest numbered 
exchanger.

To alleviate pain, I've written a bash script to at least inform
my local recipients when an email addressed to them doesn't make it
past smtp and why. 

Out of curiosity, could I set up a mail exchanger record for a computer
I don't set up to simulate an anyone who goes for this exchanger is
blacklisted effect?  Does a spamtrap have to be an actual machine or
can it be a listed exchanger that doesn't ever exist?  Are spammers
smart enough to traverse the exchanger list from the bottom up.

I've discovered that foreign blacklists like surriel can be a good
starting place, but they are often inaccurate.  The email universe
is built on largely unlisted haphazardly addressed infrastructure.
I am starting to think that the majority of anti spam techniques people
use must be doing more harm than good because of deficient addressing. 
You don't build a house without a foundation, but in the absence of 
well deployed public dns that's exactly what's happening.

I don't want to support email from unlisted sources, but that's exactly
the trouble I'm running into now.  The sad thing is, I'm beginning to
get the impression that this is standard practice at many sites.  It
must be getting recommended in the IT community to not publicly list
your outgoing smtp server.

Subject: [PLUG] ssh X11 forwarding nugget
Message-ID: <86is9izve3.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

I just thought I'd share a little experience I've had recently with a
irksome ssh X11 forwarding problem.  A while back I noticed that one
of my boxes stopped forwarding X11 connections.  That is, I try to
"ssh -X <irksome-box> xterm" (or similar) and it doesn't work.  All my
other boxes work fine.  The /etc/ssh/sshd_configs are identical (at
least semantically).  I do the typical sshd debugging thing:

  # sshd -d -p <highport>

and

  $ ssh -vvv -p <highport> <irksome-box>

and scratch my head some more.  The $DISPLAY variable is set
correctly, but /usr/bin/X11/xauth isn't running on the sshd side for
some reason.  /usr/bin/X11/xauth is present, but isn't being called.
I can't figure out what is going wrong.

I strace sshd on the working and non-working sshd hosts, with:

  # strace -f -o /tmp/strace-sshd sshd -d -p <highport>

then just connect and disconnect from a remote host.  Diff doesn't
help much here because the pids differ between the two boxes, though
diff --side-by-side is somewhat useful.  Mostly, things work
identically for quite a while, then there is a little divergence
because I use different shells on these two boxes (zsh and bash), but
then switching to side-by-side xterms with 

  $ less /tmp/strace-sshd-<boxN> 

in either one, I could synchronize things manually.

Finally, I come across the problem.  On <irksome-box> I had added
somewhere along the way a ~/.ssh/rc file to set an environment
variable (though honestly I don't remember doing this, it might have
been a package install did it for me).  Unfortunately, as confirmed by
the sshd manpage (see LOGIN PROCESS), the presence of this file
preempts the default xauth.  Which explains the whole sorry mess.  I
nuke the ~/.ssh/rc and X11 forwarding magically start working again.

Whew.

You can verify that you have valid css consturction from the W3C standards
folks at http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/  I entered your css there and 
you've got it right. 

As Paul pointed out the href="pagestyle.css" link requires the CSS and HTML
be in the same directories.  This is probably what's biting you, as the 
example you give works fine, see http://www.patch.com/rs-test.html

   Thanks, Mike. What I've tried to do is move it into a body class; not sure
I have it correct but I'll look again at the css tutorials I found on the
Web. I'm not getting the colors specified on the headings, but at least the
typeface style (serif/sans-serif) is now correct. My ORA book on HTML is the
3rd edition (1998); probably so far back from the bleeding edge it's fallen
off the back end.

   The files are all in the same directory. I added the closing
double-quotation mark and put semi-colons at the end of each line. That
seems to have done the trick. The dispaly color tweaking will come after I
redo the content. But, with guidance from, and thanks to, Kurt I now have a
better understanding of css and a set of rollover menus that look much nicer
than static links. And, now that the background color is showing up as
defined, it certainly is bright enough to catch the eye. :-)

   The complete revision of the content is on the schedule for today and
tomorrow (along with mowing the lawn and changing the oil in my little
truck). Many thanks to all!

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Hello all,

I am releasing a utility called catchmail to open source under a BSD style
license.

Here is the catchmail homepage:
http://www.users.bigpond.net.au/mysite/catchmail.htm

Catchmail is a Python utility that writes emails into a Postgres database.

Catchmail's SQL schema is based on an extended version of the Yukatan data
model (a SQL schema for relational storage of email RFC822 messages).

I'm no great Python programmer so any volunteers who might be interested in
helping to enhance and help support catchmail would be much appreciated.  I
have set up a newsgroup at http://groups-beta.google.com/group/catchmail

Any feedback on catchmail or your experience with catchmail valued.

Thanks to the great work of Mark Hammond and Jukka Zitting!

   The interim rebuild of my site is in place. However, the header, table
containing the body and the footer are all offset a bit to the right of
center when viewed with firefox or opera. I've no idea what code causes
this.

   Could someone suggest why the page is offset? Is it something in the table
commands?

Same results in Konqueror (which I think is Mozilla based), and also in IE 
(from that other os).

I saved the source and edited out the links to to your style sheets. Without 
them, the page centers itself in the window without having to scroll to the 
right. So, I'd guess the problem is in one of the two style sheets.

Yes, your table commands do have problems.
You open three table rows and close only one as a start.  

Run your page throught the html validator at 
http://validator.w3.org/
Once you have the gross HTML errors cleared out you should have a page displaying as you hope.

Very nice. Wish I knew about it before. I ran my own home page through it and 
see that, even though it seems to work in all the browsers I use, it's not 
valid. I'll spend some time learning about what my code generator and I are 
doing wrong.

Thanks, Michael.

Rich, I think this means that my guess was wrong!

   Thanks, Dick. I'm redoing the whole site so it's xhtml-1.0 compliant and
completely revising the structure and content, too. This will do for now.
Also, I just bought a couple of current books and that will bring my
knowledge froward from the 1998 reference upon which I've been relying.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0410101629270.22405@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   For years the printers were directly connected to the server and printing
from pine invoked enscript so that the messages were nicely formatted. Now
the printers are nodes on the network and pine apparently cannot find them.
I changed the default (Setup -> Printers) on the last line to 'lpr -P
laser5_duplex' and was able to print a message, but unformatted.

   /etc/printcap has the latest definitions from /etc/cups/printers.conf. But
I must need a different invocation of enscript now and I don't have a clue
where to make that change (nor what change to make) in the pine printer
setup.

   Any ideas?

Thanks,

Well, the default printer is called (or aliased) 'lp'.  If you don't
have a printer called that, you prolly can't print from Pine.
You may just have to prepend 'lp|' to the beginning of a printcap entry.

Aaron,

   It also likes 'lpr', too.

   Guess I need to play with it some more. Perhaps it's where enscript is
looking for a place to dump its output.

Hmm.. I wonder if my postfix instance is blocking comcast.  Anyone have a

Mine may not be the preferred way but I tend to create a test directory 
in my current directory and put all of the new pages in that directory.  
Unless you are doing something specific and you have to have your pages 
in the default home directory I don't see any problems with this method.

Subject: [PLUG] Bad shutdown and file system damage
Message-ID: <20041011143150.81856.qmail@web60808.mail.yahoo.com>

Yesterday, my FC2 box hung.  And hung.  And hung.  Nothing I did seemed
to have any effect, even hitting the reset switch on the front.  I was
eventually forced to hit the power switch.

When it rebooted, I opted for it to check my file system since I had an
unclean shutdown, but when it told me I had problems (yeah, my mother
says that, too) and dumped me to a command line, I didn't know what to
do so I rebooted rather than risk damaging things further :(

Now if I launch KDE it hangs.  I can launch fluxbox with no problems,
but I've been having some problems with fluxbox, too (they predated the
boot problem.)

I have my FC2 install disks that I can use for a boot disk, but I don't
know what to do with those, either.  What can I do?  My file system is
ext2.

Cheers,
Ovid

My preferred approach is to set up an entire staging site; it can be 
done in one of two ways, but both involve having a DocumentRoot that 
is the staging ground for anything that goes live.

Approach one: set up a virtual host with a different hostname 
(e.g., stage.appl-ecosys.com).

Approach two: run a second Apache instance on a nonstandard port.

Either way, you'd create a document tree like /var/www/stage and put

If the stuff you're testing gets bad enough that you want to start 
over, then just blow it away, copy the live tree into its place, and 
start over afresh.

This smells to me like hardware trouble. Does memtest86 fail in 
interesting way? Does your system have any builtin diagnostics? (Dells 
often do.)

Robert,

   I'd also prefer to keep them in the directory where they are. If I
understand you correctly, I then need to tell apache where to look for them.
Correct?

   Nothing done here is world-visible. My site is hosted at my ISP so I can
work with the current apache instatiation and host and no one but me can see
them. I want to do this because if I view a page in a browser I don't see
the included header, footer or page background.

Ah. Sorry. I didn't get the gist of your original request.

I don't think you'll encounter any trouble using the standard 
/var/www/htdocs directory. Unless you've already got a development 
tree set up elsewhere, I'd just use the package-supplied location.

One note: The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard is pushing the /srv tree 
as the place to store stuff like web pages:

   http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html

I don't think most distributions have bought into that philosophy yet, 
but it sounds like a good idea: /var for files managed by 
applications, /srv for files fed to applications.

Paul,

   I got myself wrapped around the axel here. I created the directory,
/var/www/htdocs/aesi-devel/ then tried to make that directory a symbolic
link to /home/rshepard/data/web-pages/new-site/. What I get is a symlilnk
called 'new-site' within the new directory that points to the real
directory. I must have made a syntax error in the 'ln -s ...' command or
I've not been in the proper directory.

   Unwrapping help desired.

Thanks,

Rich

I'd try this

   rm /var/www/htdocs/aesi-devel/new-site
   rmdir /var/www/htdocs/aesi-devel
   cd /var/www/htdocs
   ln -s /home/rshepard/data/web-pages/new-site aesi-devel

Of course, you'll want to double-check things before executing rm, 
since I don't know the contents of your filesystem. :-)

   Perhaps it was because I had terminal slashes when I tried this that it
didn't work correctly. Now, in /var/www/htdocs/ I have a link to the
development directory, but when I try "ls aesi-devel" I don't see the
contents of that directory. This is why I thought I did not have the proper
command syntax.

[root at salmo ~]# ls /var/www/htdocs/aesi-devel 
/var/www/htdocs/aesi-devel@

   Shouldn't I see the contents of the linked directory? And, when I do, how
do I address it in a browser? http://localhost/aesi-devel/?

Thanks,

Rich

Trailing slashes have also tripped me up in this sort of situation.

Here again, a trailing slash will make a big difference:

   [heinlein]$ ls projects
   projects@
   [heinlein]$ ls projects/
   ataboy/         eduspam/         net-snmp/       solaris/

If you create a "virtual host" in your apache config', you can set up a
second Web root for testing, using a different port.  That way you can
still use absolute paths for your inter-page links if you like.  (I
usually keep all my Web content among my other work, since I keep it all
checked into CVS in a common repository.)

Sounds like a hardware lockup.

You still need to check the filesystem. What you should have done
after it dropped you to command line is run e2fsck on all filesystems
manually. Now you need to boot single-user and check all filesystems.
You are probably using grub, then hit 'e' to edit the boot entry
instead of letting grub boot at the grub menu, select the line with
the kernel image, usually the second line, hit 'e' again, type
'single' at the end of that line, and hit 'b' to boot the modified
grub entry. After getting the prompt, you need to remount root
filesystem, everything else you can unmount (unless /usr is a separate
filesystem):
umount -a (it'll complain that "/" is busy, that's ok)
mount -o ro,remount /
Now you can check filesystems:
e2fsck -C0 -f /dev/hda1 (or whatever "/" is, check /etc/fstab if you
don't know). If it offers to make changes, say yes (your only other
option is manual recovery with filesystem editor). Repeat for all
otehr filesystems.
Hopefilly the damaged files were not from any critical packages (KDE
does not count as critical). Then verify all packages with rpm:
rpm -Va (verify everything)
or rpm -V <package> (one by one)
and force reinstall of everything which seems broken, like
rpm -Uvh --force kdebase-3.0-1.i386.rpm (you need to download the
packages of the same version as what you are using, of course). It'll
just install right over the existing package.
You may be unlucky and have damage to rpm itself or glibc or something
else critical, but odds are you don't, otherwise your system probably
would be dead now.

The person who set this up for me only created two partitions, one for
swap and one for everything else.  I seem to recall this is a bad idea.
 Is this going to cause problems?

No problem. It just means you have nothing to unmount and you can
just remount "/" to be read-only and fsck it. And, just in case, you
can recreate the swap:
swapoff -a
mkswap /dev/hda2 (assuming that is the swap, check fstab - be careful
here, if you point this to your other partition it will destroy all
data)
swapon -a

Hi folks,

No need always to go to the w3c validator.  HTMLTidy will do the trick 
for you locally, along with optionally formatting the HTML into nicely 
indented, readable form.  Plus, if you want to get all advanced, you can 
do neat things with find or xargs, plus I think even get vim or emacs to 
automatically run it for you.

Let me second Randall's recommendation. tidy is very cool:

   http://tidy.sourceforge.net/

It sits in the toolchain of my personal web site:

   DocBook XML -> xsltproc -> tidy -> XHTML

The one oddity is that tidy is a poor Makefile citizen because it can 
return either 0 or 1 as a success value. So instead of invoking tidy 
directly, I use a wrapper script:

   #!/bin/sh
   USAGE="usage: $(basename $0) infile outfile"
   INFILE=${1:?$USAGE}
   OUTFILE=${2:?$USAGE}

   /usr/bin/tidy -wrap 132 -quiet -utf8 -indent -o $OUTFILE $INFILE
   RETVAL=$?
   if test $RETVAL -lt 2; then
     exit 0
   else
     exit $RETVAL
   fi

It's such a great tool. I don't even consider posting pages to my web 
site that haven't been tidy-ed.

Impressive managing to disable the reset button.

Should of given you minimal instructions before that command line. Mainly
to run `fsck` by hand, though I guess you're not familiar with fsck.
Quite possibly most folks aren't. Unfortunatly rebooting, and continuing
to use the system could of made things a *lot* worse.

Hmm, easiest approach to describe...  There are two reasonable options.
The first option is next time shutdown the machine with `shutdown -F`,
and that will force the invocation of fsck. From your description though
it will likely dump you back at the command line. So the second option of
going for the rescue disk may be best and get you to the command line
quicker.

Once at the command run `fsck -f -t <fstype> <device>` for each of your
filesystems. `fdisk -l /dev/hda` will likely list them for you. The other
option would be to mount your root filesystem READ-ONLY and get the list
from etc/fstab. Or if you remember all of your filesystem devices, that
will work too.

e2fsck is pretty good, and most of the time answering yes to its
questions is pretty safe; I'll have to recommend you do in fact answer
yes to all of them. Depending on the severity of the damage there is a
decent chance that fsck will dump files in the directory "lost+found" at
the root of each of the filesystem(s). You'll have to decide whether to
keep those or discard them.

Dead wrong. It smells like precisely what the system said, filesystem
damage. Though this doesn't explain the original hang (but Fedora's
non-release status could).

   Well, now that I have apache pointed to the Web page development directory
I thought that I'd see the entire page -- including header and footer. But,
I don't. I can load the page but it's no different from opening a file in a
browser; all I see is the information in that file but the header and footer
are not displayed. Sigh.

   I thought this would be simple. Guess I was wrong. When I tell firefox to
open http://localhost/aesi-devel/ shouldn't I see the default 'index.shtml'
rather than the contents of that directory? Obviously, I'm still missing a
piece of the puzzle here.

The FC2 set may include the equivalent of a standalone boot disk;  I
know RedHat 9 does.  However, even though I run RedHat style distros
on my machines, a Knoppix disk is the best resource for debugging a
wedged machine.  Among other things, it gets me out to the net, where
I can look at web pages and ask folks silly questions.   If it doesn't
run, I can see where it hangs, and if it does, it gives me a working
example of files that I can compare to the ones on my hard drive.  Of
course, I can memtest and fsck with it.

Note that our own talented and brilliant Carla Schroder has written a
dandy article on unwedging a system with a Knoppix disk:

http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-knopx.html

I will bring a few of my remastered Knoppix disks to the next advanced
topics.  Perhaps someone can copy some for the clinic, too.  If you 
need a copy earlier, I am in east Beaverton (but have some redeeming
qualities, too).

Message-ID: <1097537407.9607.18.camel@einstein.seansdomain.org>

I've been working on a script that will return mysql statistics through
snmp.

#!/bin/sh
/usr/bin/mysqladmin extended-status | perl -ne 's/[^\d\s]//g;
s/\s+/\n/g; s/^\n//; print'

this, along with this line added to snmpd.conf

exec .1.3.6.1.4.1.4502.1.6 mysql /usr/local/bin/get-mysql

has been working great for about 2 weeks now.

I did a debian update today and now I'm getting

I find this very odd, because I can run the mysqladmin command as any

script /usr/local/bin/get-mysql as any user and it produces the correct
output.

There's a setting in httpd.conf (on RH it's in /etc/httpd/conf/) where you 
tell apache what the default index files are.

It looks like Outlook has special code to parse the pages at these
webmail accounts. You can this with a separate program that provides a
POP server, like "YahooPOPs":

Bill,

   There's nothing in /etc/apache/httpd.conf. I thought that the built-in
default for apache was "index.html" while for Microsoft it is "default.htm".
At least, that's what I just read.

   Anywho, while there are lots of "default" entries in the conf file none
refers to an index file.

   What I really want is to see the whole page: header, body and footer
rather than only the body.

Thanks,

Rich

Evan,

   Aha! You've caught me with my ignorance showing -- excuse me as I zip up.
Again, this is what I was given in the re-write and I've been wondering what
the prefix 's' meant. Now I know. I'll go fix that right after dinner.

Many thanks,

Rich

Evan,

   Well, shucks. I just did it. Progress has been made: now I see, "[an error
occurred while processing this directive]" where the header and footer
belong.

   What I have in the test page (also in all "real" pages) is:
   <!--#include virtual="/header.html" -->
and
   <!--#include virtual="/footer.html" -->

These work in the live server but now I'm getting that error. Have you an
idea what I need to read to learn about this?

Many thanks,

Rich

The apache documentation above mentions this particular application of
SSI. Use google to find more detail (I don't use SSI so I can't
recommend a reference).

Look at your error log to see exactly what the error message is.

Evan,

   Thanks for the clue stick. As a newcomer I don't think of apache as having
a log. Don't ask why not.

   Anyway, I see the problem and it's a quesiton that I have about specifying
the location of referenced files.

   For example, the #include is for "/header.html" and "/footer.html". The
error log tells me that the server is looking in /var/www/htdocs/ for these
files, not in the same directory as the calling file. That's why it cannot
find them.

   In the books and Web pages I've been reading to learn xhtml and css I see
some links specifed as, <a href="/filename.html"> or <a
href="#filename.html"> or <a href="filename.html">. I'm sure these are all
relative or absolute references but none of the resources that I've read
explains the differences.

   If all .html, .shtml, and .css files are in the same, top-level directory
do I specify the anchors without a leading '/' or '#"? I know that I
reference images by using <src=/images/filename.ext>. Does the leading slash
indicate one directory level higher?

Thanks for the lesson, Evan,

Rich

I don't know where I learned it, but I can explain it.

When referenced from www.hostname.com/subdir/page.html,

/file.html --- means --- www.hostname.com/file.html
file.html  --- means --- www.hostname.com/subdir/file.html

(These two are like paths in UNIX)

#thing     --- means --- www.hostname.com/subdir/page.html#thing

This refers to an anchor on page.html (<a name="thing">anchor</a>).

A little googling ("anchor name") turns up this page:

http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/links.html

Seems to be a good reference for all of this.

Just a sanity check, Rich.  Are the header.html and footer.html in the
document root directory of your server?

I don't know of any MUAs that do this directly, but there are a number
of little clients that will download various sorts of web mail and
deliver them locally, which achieves the same sort of thing.

Thanks to everyone who offered advice.  My system now appears to be up
and running just fine.  I will confess that I didn't understand the
output from rpm -Va, but after running e2fsck on my filesystems,
everything is spiffy.

If the reset button didn't work, then it most definitely hung at the
hardware level, not the software level.  The most probable cause is
overheating of some component (CPU, memory, northbridge, or something
like that).  The filesystem damage is a result of the hardware hang. 
The only way to keep the filesystem from getting damaged is to keep the
hardware from hanging. 

Good Luck,

Unless he just didn't hold it in long enough.  Whoever cooked that

I've seen IDE system lock up in this way. Usually one ends up with a
new hard disk shortly after this happens. You do have backups, right?

That'll show you the list of files modified compared to pristine RPM packages.
Some of them, like configuration files in /etc, are often customized.
But if you see some libraries or executables in this list, you have
some corruption and need to reinstall the RPMs which own these files.

Well, I can't say that I'm all that knowledgeable about Linux (duh!),
but I definitely held in the reset button long enough.

Now that I've run e2fsck and the box is working again, I've noticed
that not everything is the way it was.  Amongst other things, Open
Office is gone (though many of the lib files are there), but running
"apt-get install openoffice" generates an error (below my signoff.)

It appears my problems are not resolved after all.  Any clues? 
Googling for this has led me nowhere :(

Ovid

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.

Since you only requested a single operation it is extremely likely that
the package is simply not installable and a bug report against
that package should be filed.
The following information may help to resolve the situation: 

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  xorg-x11: Obsoletes: XFree86 but 4.3.0-2.90.55 is to be installed
  xorg-x11-base-fonts: Obsoletes: XFree86-base-fonts but 4.3.0-2.90.55

Wow, hang on. Are you running FC2 or FC1? There should not be any
XFree86 on FC2, and FC1 does not know anything about xorg.
Check what XFree86 and xorg packages you have:
rpm -qa | grep XFree86 
rpm -qa | grep xorg

If you are running FC2, you should rpm -e all XFree86 packages. Then
reinstall all xorg packages, just to be sure.

A first guess looks like your apt configuration is setup for FC1... How
about yum?

If your reset switch wasn't working, something was really wrong...
that's a pretty low-level thing on the motherboard (something the OS,
itself, doesn't touch).  I would guess either the switch isn't plugged
in to the board properly or you're looking at some serious motherboard
issues.

Does the reset button work now?

Well, if you're willing use your own hosts mail spools for more than
just system messages (and why not put it to work for what it was
designed for?), you could always use fetchyahoo and similar daemons...

   Thanks, Evan. While it seemed reasonable I assumed nothing because it's in

I have dropped firefox because of these issues.  It says file not found 
or page not found.  I go with mozilla and all is well.  I don't get it 
and don't have the time to fighure it out.

   T'wasn't a firefox issue, Michael, but a user glitch. As soon as I removed
the leading slashes both the header and the footer appeared when I reloaded
the page. I'm stumbling over my newnes to all this. Last time I did anything
with html was 1998. It's changed slightly since then. :-)

   My revised site -- all new content, too -- will be strictly xhtml-1.0
compliant and both styles and layout will be determined by css. Helps me to
think how I'm presenting my new services as I do this.

Thanks all,

Rich

Exactly which issue do you mean?  The quote quoted is clearly an Apache
configuration issue, not user-agent:

To my knowledge, the reset button, assuming it's hooked up, is 
instantaneous. The power button can be set to a (configurable) time delay. 

The reset button just hardware resets the motherboard, and does so 
instantly.

At least, I've never come across a reset button that required being 
pushed for more than an instant.

You're right; I was thinking of power.  A lot of Big Vendor Systems only
have power buttons.

Usually it is on some page with a login.  once I type the name in it 
tells me page not found.

I dont want to spend much time on it so I am happily back with mozilla

I was a bit frustrated yesterday, as I am running a print server on Red
Hat 9 and had to kill a print-job-gone-bonkers that my son had started.
I was of course not logged in as root. When running Print Manager, I
could see the job, but didn't have permission to cancel the job. I
finally had to log out and then log in as root to use this graphical
tool to kill the job, as I didn't know how to do it from command line.

IMHO this is a big weakness to Linux on the desktop, or even on the
server for those that like the GUI. I personally don't normally use the
GUI for administration, but when I have, I've wished there was a way to
do something like XP's "run as" option, where you right-click on a file
and click "run as" to run the application as root or another user. Is
there a way to do this that I just haven't found? If not, maybe it
should be submitted to the KDE or Gnome teams or whatever to be added
in the future. I've run all versions of Red Hat since 7.1, and more
recently SuSE 9.1 on the desktop and haven't seen a feature like this.
SuSE has that option when run Yast, but I haven't seen that for running
an application from a file browser like Nautilus or Konqueror.

Check out the su(1) and sudo(8) man pages. In this case, try

   su -c redhat-config-printer

And, though it probably needn't be said: su predates "run as" by years 
and years.

As an extention of what Paul talked about.....

When I come across those programs that need root access I right click on
the program in the menu and choose properties. Then I change it to use
gksu.

gksu -u root /usr/bin/ethereal

This pops up a gui password box where you can type in the root password
to "run as".

Change your "shebang" line from:

#!/bin/sh

to

#!/bin/sh -x

That will cause the output to be much more verbose, and you may see the 
problem.

I'm assuming, of course, that you are getting an email with the output 
from your command.

What I'm suspecting is that your getting a "command not found" error. 
You may be able to fix this easily by specifying the path to the command 
you are using.

Not enough to go on here. It would help if you posted the script you are 
running. Also check /var/log/messages for error information. You might 
try "tail -f /var/log/messages" just prior to the cron kicking off the 
script.

Others have answered your main question, so ...

To check on print jobs from the command line, use lpq.
To kill print jobs from the command line, use lprm.
This may be dependent on the printing system you are using.  


tinman:~$ lp -d laserjet testfile

   These are all great answers, but they leave the frustration in place for a
quick solution. I assume that CUPS is the printing system and that the
attempt to kill the job as root was via /usr/sbin/printers.

   Two factors at play here. First, to kill a cups print job started by a
user, run /users/sbin/printers as that user. Works every time. As root, you
can "su <son's login name>" and run the program that way.

   Second, if you switch to root by running "su" then you're still in your
user shell environment. If you switch by running "su -" then you'll get
root's shell environment and that will often let you override a user print
job.

HTH,

Rich

My first hunch is that the command that doesn't run is in /usr/local 
or some other directory that's not in the default cron $PATH. Try 
specifying the full path to the program and see if that helps.

I'm using cups on rh9, and I don't have that particular comand.  How is
it better than lpq followed by sudo lprm?

"which" is my friend.  Been bitten too many times by having the wrong PATH 
for the commands -- especially those in /root/bin -- so I get it working 
form the command line then which (-hunt :-) for each command.

galen,

   It is probably not better. I thought that cups replaced lpd as the
printing system and that lpr was a link to cups. I never looked to see if
all the lpr tools were still in place. I'm surprised that you don't have
/usr/sbin/printers as I had it on Red Hat up through 7.3 and it's on the
Slackware installations.

Many of you noticed the recent outage of the PLUG mailing lists; I hope
you found it a refreshing break :)  Microsharp, who has provided our
hosting for the last few years, is changing their business and will
shortly be unable to provide our hosting.  Earlier yesterday or today
their DNS servers went down.

Fortunately, Ed Sawiki has been providing PLUG secondary DNS service and
was available and we got a fix in place.  Soon the hosting will be
moving to Naked Ape Consulting's hosting environment, which will provide
me greater flexibility in managing the lists and web site.  It is of
course likely that there will be some problems--I'm going to be
migrating the lists to the latest version of Mailman and performing spam
and virus scanning on the messages, among other things, which might
cause problems.  Just bear with us and things will be stable again soon.

   Somehow firefox-0.9.3 has lost the settings for pdf files. When I try to
download (or view) a pdf file the dialog box pops up but the "OK" button is
greyed out and there are no defaults for viewing (xpdf) or downloading.
Sigh.

   I've just looked in about:config and there is no string "pdf" to be found.
Will someone please tell me again where to set this? It's frustrating that
it keeps getting lost.

TIA,

Rich

   I want to manipulate some images with the newest version of The GIMP. The
two books I have are rather ancient. Can anyone recommend current
documentation?

   The two immediate tasks are extracting my new logo from the white
background so I can put it on a transparent background and learning how to
make an image "faded" so it appears semi-transparent when used as a
background layer.

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] Getting mail addressed to another user
Message-ID: <i5l156.1d7@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

Occasionally, I get an email that is addressed to another user,
without any indication of why I'm getting a copy of the mail.
I thought that if I was BCCed on an email that there
would be some indication in the headers, for example - this is what
happens when I send mail from my yahoo account to non-existent user
and BCC 'mike' ...

Note how it says "for <mike at computer-arts.net>" in the line where my server "lserver"
accepts the mail.

But occasionally I get email addressed to somebody else without the

When this happens, sendmail still clearly makes an entry in /var/log/maillog
that it's handing me the mail. Does the sender have some control over
this part of the header? I always thought it was something that sendmail
was adding on locally?

Preferences -> Downloads, in the Filetypes box is a button for plugins. 
  Mine has PDF enabled. I am running 1.0PR though.

   Perhaps this is the core of the problem, Mel. I have nothing in that
plugin box and no idea how to add them. When I click on the "plugin" button
another dialog box opens -- empty -- and it has only "OK" and "Cancel"
buttons. Check mate.

For me, it seems to be the following line in /etc/mime.types, which is 
firefox's helper.global_mime_types_file:

  application/pdf                 pdf

I don't pretend to understand the magic that translates this into the
default of 'ggv' that ends up in my dialog box.

But... my dialog box also has an 'Other..' entry.  If I chose that and
navigate to /usr/bin/xpdf, I can use that instead of the default.  And
the next time I click on a pdf file that comes up as the highlighted
choice.

Now what happened here?  Ah, firefox seems to have added an entry to my
.mozilla/firefox/default.randomnumber/mimeTypes.rdf file.

Ali,

   I have that line in /etc/mime.types, too. That file was set up by
apache-1.3.31.

   To which dialog box do you refer? When I try to view/download a pdf I get
a dialog box with an "other" button. But, that brings up only a single,
blank box just like the one above it. I'm not offered the option of
navigating to a file.

   Hmm-m-m. Perhaps that's the problem here. In my installation it's
~/.mozilla/firefox/default.0mg/mimeType.rdf. Really light-weight is that
default directory: 0 mg. Anyway, I see that it's looking in /usr/X11R6/bin/
for xpdf and the binary is installed here in /usr/local/bin. I just changed
the path so I'll see if that makes a difference.

Many thanks,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] Installing Linux on an old PowerPC
Message-ID: <416F0D20.9040902@adnap.no-ip.com>

I have here in front of me a pile of very old Power Machintosh machines. 
They have 32MB of memory and are running Mac OS 8.1. It's got a beige or 
white case, a floppy drive, and a tray-loading CDROM drive. A sticker on 
the side indicates it was purchased in April of 1998. It says "Power 
Machintosh 5500/225" on the front.

I want to put a light Linux system on these so they can act as clients 
to an LTSP system. All I need to do is boot the system and start up
"X -indirect servername".

How can I accomplish this? The debian-ppc boot floppies are spit out on 
boot.

This is entirely uknown territory for me. Any help is appreciated.

Evan

   I can select only the background on my logo image and now I want to change

the color selection dialog box, but I don't know how to change the color to
the specified value. I enter it in the data entry box, but the color doesn't

   Does anyone know the secret of doing this?

A question from Captain Obvious: did you use dd/rawrite/etc. to write
the boot-floppies images to the disks? Have you tried other disks?

This page makes it sound like bad disks or improperly written disks are
the most common source of problems w/ Debian boot-floppies
installations:

I have used rawrite and dd to write these, but there's a few
combinations of disks, images, and writer that I haven't tried. Thanks
for the link.

1998 isn't *that* old. :-)  They should run Debian-PPC just fine. No
guarantees for X, but since they have on-board Apple video it
shouldn't be an issue.

The 5500s have the "OldWorld" OpenFirmware release, which means you'll
very likely have to leave a small MacOS partition in place for booting
Linux via the "BootX" control panel. One hundred MB should be more
than enough. I find it only adds ten seconds or so to the boot
sequence, and works well.

If you wish to use the Debian install floppies, you'll need to find an
image for the HFS-formatted rescue floppy (the Mac firmware will
refuse to recognize "foreign" floppy formats, as you've found).

An easier method is to install the BootX control panel, which looks
into a special folder nested in the MacOS' "System" folder for a
kernel and RAMdisk image. IIRC, Debian has a special pair of kernel
and initrd images just for installation. After that, it's a simple
matter of rebooting and selecting the Linux images from the BootX
control panel that will appear at the beginning of the boot sequence.

If it's the background, what does making it transparent accomplish?

You also have to be careful about semitransparency in PNG's. Old (and
maybe new) versions of IE can't handle it and put an ugly gray
background around the image. Regular transparency is OK.

Sometime in the last 48 hours the spam filters at pobox.com started
filtering all PLUG list traffic. According to the headers from the
recovered messages this is because address 198.107.38.238 (drizzle)
has no PTR record. No doubt other spam filters are triggering off
of this as well.

Would it be too much to ask that drizzle have a PTR record?

Evan,

   It makes it impossible to save as a .jpg.

   What I've learned this past week is that IE is so non-standard, one way or
another and in each version, that there needs to be a work-around for them.

   Actually, I found the ideal work-around: I changed the background of the
image to match the background of the pages. Blends in very well and
accomplishes the same thing.

At the moment, it would.  We have no control over the reverse DNS (and
only have partial DNS) due to stuff happening at Microsharp.  There will
be proper DNS in a few days after I've taken over the hosting.

you need to leave some apple on there.  (minimal install) then put a 
bootloader then install.  I have put gentoo on 20 or thirty of these old 
world machines.

Good afternoon, evening, or morning.

I've mentioned before, I think, that I am semi-responsible for a
redhat 7.2 server. It's located over at rackspace, and I was just
looking at _all the freakin exploits_ running around for RH 7.2 (cough
fubared ssh key) which got me thinking about how easy it would be for
this server to be rootkitted.

If I use fedoralegacy.org/ to try to keep it fairly updated (with
yum!), my main concern is: will it break currently running php scripts
in web pages (ie, there's about 25 small sites on it, will I need to
go through each and every one to fix issues?), will it break anything
else? It looks like they try to "live lightly" so I don't think so,
but I wanted a second opinion.

Thanks :)

I use fedoralegacy with apt on a RH 7.3 box running apache/mod_perl,
and I've had no problems upgrading anything, from the kernel to apache.

I agree with Wil.  One would have to add to ptr record to MicroSharp's
DNS, and I don't want to ask them for too many favors at the moment.

I want to thank everyone Ed and Wil for their help with this Outage.

I will fill people in on more later, but for now:

    (1)  MicroSharp has hosted PLUG for free for over 4 years and has
         given PLUG very good service.  We want to thank them very much.

    (2)  MicroSharp is changing.  Among other things they are giving up
         their servers and outsourcing everything they have.

    (3)  I have been trying to purchase the PLUG server.
         Unfortunately, the PLUG server has been sold to another company
         along with all of MicroSharp's other servers.  I'm now trying to 
         buy it from the new owner, but may not succeed.  The hardware
         is OLD OLD OLD and isn't worth, but I would like our data.

    (4)  MicroSharp also sold the machine which should have PLUG's 
         backups on it.

    (5)  Fortunately, I have been doing remote backups on a weekly basis.
         I will have a copy of everything on the PLUG server when it
         goes down, but I may be miss a couple days at the end.

    (6)  I have been working with MicroSharp to see how long we can keep 
         the machine up, but they no longer own it and can not promise
         anything.

    (7)  I have also lost all of my personal domains and resulting
         email addresses.  However, people should be able to get
         a hold of me at dmandel at PioneerPacific.edu or by calling
         me at 541-730-5285.

    (8)  To complicate matters, I have just had a death in the family
         (an 92 year old uncle) and need to tend to family matters
         today.


                                          Sincerely,
                                          David Mandel

If you're short a machine, I have a PII 450 with 128MB of RAM and a
smallish (10GB?) hard drive that is collecting dust.  I've had it since
July and still haven't thought of anything to use it for....

hehehehe....  :-)

It was an old customer's computer... we moved him over to his laptop
when he moved to smaller living quarters and he didn't want his desktop
any more.  I gave him a small discount on the bill and took the system,
thinking I could do something with it.

FWIW, my laptop has a Pentium 4 in it.  :-\

The main problem for you is that Fedora Legacy no longer supports Red

constant upgrade shuffle I'd suggest getting one of the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux clones and installing it instead of Red Hat.

I've used White Box Linux (http://www.whiteboxlinux.org/) with
excellent results, and others on this list have mentioned CentOS
(http://www.centos.org/).  Red Hat Enterprise 2.1 is essentially Red
Hat 7.3 so you're likely to run into fewer compatibility issues using
a clone of this (e.g. CentOS-2) rather than the Red Hat 9.0-equivalent
Enterprise Linux 3.

Barring an upgrade to one of these, upgrade your 7.2 box to 7.3 and
use the Fedora Legacy patches.  They work fine, but often lag the
"real" vendor patches by a couple of weeks-- during which time you're
extra vulnerable to an unwanted transfer of ownership on your server. 
:-(

To answer your question of "will it break anything"-- it probably will
not break anything if you upgrade to CentOS-2 or Red Hat 7.3.  There
may be some minor issues to work through if you use White Box or
CentOS-3.

If you're the one managing those PHP scripts, you should do the following:
  + make a list of each script and how it's accessed (URL)
  + build (or get a consultant to build) a wget script to test each one
  + make sure the tests work before the upgrade
  + get an eval copy of vmware for your workstation
  + install White Box Linux or CentOS-3 in it
  + install your PHP scripts there
  + run the tests against the scripts
  + fix any problems
  + install White Box Linux or CentOS-3 on your real system
  + install your updated PHP scripts
  + run the tests
  + fix any problems and figure out why your vmware test system was different

Well I'm not really sure what it called.  I'd like to capture a 'listen on
line' feed from the local public radio station so I can hear them later in
the day.

The stations options don't include ogg and I'm at a lost anyway as to how
to get what I need.  I'm running Fedora Core 1 -- so no real mp3 option
standard.  The feed provides RealPlayer, WinAMP/XMMS, amd Windows Media
Player (WMP).

My understanding is that mplayer will handle audio only and save to disk 
but my attempts so far haven't been successful.

Anyone on the list doing this?  If so how.  I'm not against using mp3
formats if that's what it takes, ie. downloading/building the xmms package 
with mp3 enabled.


TIA,
Rod

Colin,

   I've not used courier (except as a typeface), but I am running qpopper. It
ran just fine on Red Hat 7.3 and still runs fine on Slackware-10.0. It is
well documented and easy to set up. Grab it from the qualcomm Web site and
have at it.

Dovecot supports POP3... it's a darned good IMAP server, IMHO.  It would
provide a nice means of migrating your users over to IMAP.  :-)

What have you tried?

I searched google for "save realaudio stream linux" and found the 
following on 
http://all-streaming-media.com/record-video-stream/record-streaming-video-windows-media-and-real-video.htm

*MPlayer <http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/design6/dload.html> and 
Related projects 
<http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/design6/projects.html>* 
(/Free/Windows, Linux, Mac OS X,.../)
MPlayer is a movie player for Linux (runs on many other Unices, and 
non-x86 CPUs), Windows, Mac OS X. It plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI, OGG/OGM, 
VIVO, ASF/WMA/WMV, QT/MOV/MP4, FLI, RM, NuppelVideo, YUV4MPEG, FILM, 
RoQ, PVA files, supported by many native, XAnim, and Win32 DLL codecs. 
You can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, DivX 3/4/5 and even WMV movies, 
too (without the avifile library).
To record streaming media get a URL of a stream and use command line 
strings like in the following examples:

    mplayer.exe -dumpstream rtsp://somehost.com/somedirectory/somefile.rm
    mplayer.exe -dumpstream rtsp://somehost.com/somedirectory/somefile.ra
    mplayer.exe -dumpstream rtsp://somehost.com/somedirectory/somefile.asf
    mplayer.exe -dumpstream mms://somehost.com/somedirectory/somefile.wmv 

After recording you will get the file stream.dump. You should rename it 
to .rm, .ra, .asf, .wmv or other format you are using. MPlayer supports 
HTTP, RTSP, MMS protocols to record Windows Media, RealVideo/RealAudio, 
QuickTime Video
Recommended free MPlayer package with GUI for Windows: MPlayer + 
frontend by Gabor Szecsi <http://www.extra.hu/deje/mpf_index.html> (When 
using it enter your URL in a Media file editbox and "-dumpstream" 
(without quotes) in MPlayer Extra parameters editbox, then click "Start" 
button to start recording process).

I have tried any of this. But is looks like it should work.

I love these situations that allow me to demonstrate my complete
ignorance.

What are the advantages/differences between IMAP and POP?

Assume that:

1) my users are all remote
2) They're mainly computer iliterate
3) I don't want them keeping their email stored on my server.

Does that make a difference?

IMAP is generally used when you're keeping the email on the remote
server.. POP3 is generally used to download email to your local
computer.  POP3 is great if you only ever want to access your email from
one computer... IMAP lets you have the same emails on many computers.

> Assume that:

If they were local, you'd want to just read from the spool.  :-)

> 2) They're mainly computer iliterate

This really shouldn't matter... IMAP is as easy to set up and utilize as
POP3, IMHO.

> 3) I don't want them keeping their email stored on my server.

In that case, go with POP3.  Dovecot can work as a pop3-only server,
AFAIK.

POP3 vs IMAP

One of the major diffrenced between the two is how mail is stored.
POP3 downloads the mail to your local system for viewing and IMAP
keeps the mail on the server.

POP3 is used more often by ISP's because it needs less maintenance,
fewer headaches, and no need to worry about mailbox storage.

With IMAP you can provide all sorts of added services like :
centralized management, remote access to mail, web access to saved
mail, mailbox backups, client roaming etc etc. IMAP also allows you to
have multiple folder on the mail server but POP3 only allows one.

I would reccomend a IMAP server for a small business just because they
can share folders and organized thier mail better.

I forgot to mention that IMAP allows you to DL the headers from the
messages before you actually DL the whole message, would kinda help
with windows virus spread(but we dont have to worry about that
....right?).

I forgot to mention that IMAP basicly required to have a live
conenction to the network/internet to view the mail because the mail
is stored on the server, where as POP3 allows you to DL the mail and
view it Offline.

I'll second dovecot -- with the caveat that I only use its IMAP 
personality. I've never even tried its POP capabilities; in fact, I've 
got POP turned off. :-)

Dovecot has got a decent set of authentication options: PAM, system 
passwords, password database specific to dovecot, LDAP, etc.

And it does SSL (pop3s, 995/tcp, supported by most clients these days)

FWIW, in Gentoo Dovecot does SSL OOTB.

Used them running ices to send streaming .ogg files from the club venues 
  during South By Southwest Music festival. We would send the streams to 
a big g4 icecast server.  They would then be fed from there.

We (actually myself and the sxsw webmaster) have done it for two years 
and kinda hoped to have video ready for this year but it looks kinda 
farther away.

Why apples?  Because Schlotskys lent us the boxes and that is what they 
were.

Sadly, the dovecot ebuild is still marked as ~sparc, and I don't use 
any experimental packages, so for now I build it myself.

Mostly a few quick thing I picked up but without any heavy research.  I

feed.
   I was also fighting a nForce sound card (onboard) issue so between my
frustration with that (ended up installing a "real" sound card) and some
other issues I mostly gave up.  I was thinking someone might say "yes I
did it with xyz player and used this commandline".  Then I could go home 
for the weekend and have more fun figuring out why I couldn't install xyz 
or it wouldn't recognize my sound card, or the station would go off line 
right in the middle of a test.
   Better to know I have an anvil in my hands that may fall on my foot
then to have to find the anvil myself before dropping it.  Call me lazy
but I was hoping for only one kind of pain.

Also my other attempts were a few weeks, of work-hell, ago.  I'm getting
most of this Saturday to myself (wife, daughter, and grandkids are
visiting great-grands) so wanted to get the most out of it.  :-)

CYA eh?  Famous last word -- should.  We have a saying at work.  'Should'

involves computers.

Thanks though. They do look good and not like anything I'd tried already.

Sorry for jumping on you guys. Because of the above problem the explanation

hadn't seen any of that yet when I complained about reverse DNS not working.

Message-ID: <20041016010006.GA25750@gate.kl-ic.com>

If there is nobody willing to take on the task of personally hosting
pdxlinux.com, I have some suggestions, and I could contribute some
effort and a bit of the money to make them happen.

keithl.com and my 4 other domains are currently being hosted with a
virtual colo at www.vcolo.com , Mike and Erik's company.  DNS for my
sites is handled by www.dyndns.org .  With Brian Martin's able assistance,
I have the virtual machine connected to my internal network over a VPN
tunnel, and I back the machine up every night, with Dirvish, of course.

A similar setup would work for PLUG.   Dyndns and Vcolo are not free;
they might cost us $300 per year.  We could pay for them with a 
"stupid comment or question" tax at Advanced Topics;  at a buck per
penalty, we could pay for the server AND buy the speaker drinks, with
money left over. :-) 

While I would prefer to see the PLUG site taken care of for free by
some organization like Naked Ape, it would be nice to distribute
control to three or four of us, and Wil's security may not permit
that.  We could back the virtual machine up to two or three remote
sites, and with a simple dyndns address change, we could move the 
site to a new IP address very quickly if needed.

I would like Dave Mandel to keep owning the PLUG "brand", of course,
and he should retain executive control over who gets access to the 
dyndns account.  But others should be doing the day to day management,
so Dave can concentrate on "the vision thing", and do all the other
myriad things he does for us.

I think things complicate when PLUG starts having to deal with money.

IMHO, it's easier to take an existing box somebody isn't using and drop
it in a closet with a 'net connection provided by somebody who has such
things to spare.

We're not dealing with a high-demand service that must be kept online at
all times at all costs... we don't really need all that redundancy.  If
PLUG is down for a day, all is not lost.

Picking a few members to be in charge of the server sounds too
formalized for PLUG, as well.  Naw, I really think we should keep it as-
is, for the most part... if we're voting, anyway.  :-)

Not necessarily. IMAP can be used to delete messages from the server, and
POP3 doesn't force you to delete messages from the server. For example,
fetchmail behaves much the same regardless of which protocol is being
used.

   Anyone here fluent in css for Web page layout?

   I have a page layout with all divisions positioned as "relative". I've
adjusted them so they look perfect on the index page. However, as soon as I
copy the template to use it for different content, the menu and footer are
repositioned.

   If I use "position: fixed", which is supposed to anchor the division to
it's containing element, not the browser window, then the division remains
fixed as I scroll the content. Something's wrong. If I use "float" it gets
screwy.

   This was all built based on Eric Meyer's "More ... on CSS".

   Ideas, anyone? I can provide a copy of all code and images as a gzipped
tarball.

TIA,

Rich

I'm going to be taking over hosting shortly.  I've got my own boxes

Jeez, thats freaken awesome.  That's cooler then what Evan and I are
going to use ours for.

I got Debian on one today but we're having trouble with the network
card. I replaced the card but the problem persisted with the new one. 
It works for a couple seconds then totally trips out.  I can't
remember what the error is but we're going to try a new kernel on
Monday.

Thanks for the tips.  They really helped.

My company would be able to help out if PLUG needs a place to host
web/mailing lists. We have a 2Mb SDSL line with bandwidth to spare. I
might be able to provide a server with a DDS2 drive in it as well as
your own IP. PLUG would need to be able to do it's own system
administration though as I wouldn't have the time. 

I would even be able to help set this up tomorrow afternoon (Saturday).
If you need to get moving on this right away, please give me a call on
my cell phone at 503.799.4656

Thanks,

Jack Morgan

Your best bet is to capture the mp3 stream (WinAMP/XMMS) with
streamripper.  That way you can save the compressed stream as-is, in a
common format.

Subject: [PLUG] Advanced Topics speaker this month?
Message-ID: <86k6trmfnf.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

Is there a speaker for next week's Advanced Topics talk yet?  I've
emailed Alan twice now without response, so either he hates me or he
isn't reading that particular mailbox.

If anyone is interested, I am willing to try to pull together a talk
on the project I recently finished involving computation of electric
fields and electric field exposure near transmission line towers.  It
threads its way through a variety of free software tools, kind of cool
distributed parallel processing that various PLUG members helped me
out with (thank you!  thank you!), and assorted other details and
problems.

I thought I was going to be out of town this month, but that got
scrubbed, so I am available again.  If not this month, maybe another
one.  That is, unless no one is interested and/or Alan really does
hate me. ;-)

Ack!  Don't they realize outsourcing all the services provided is what
boned California[1] into the electric crisis a few years ago?  That
being said, Microsharp was a reliable host for PLUG, I just consider
the transition an astounding lack of judgement on their part.

Without giving PLUG a chance to recover what they have?  That's plain
rude.  Why no warning?

[1] Not that California or Californians matters more than the dogshit
scraped off my shoe after an inconsiderate dog owner failed to scoop,
but I bring up the electric matter as lessons not learned by
Microsharp.

Sorry about that. Mail is hard for me to deal with.  (Evolution is eating 
up more memory than I have.)

I don't hate you.  You got the spot.  I just have not gotten back to you.

Well in general the idea behind POP was to have the end user download
the mail to thier local machine. And i never said the user could not
delete, i was just stating the ideas behind using the two protocols.

Subject: [PLUG] vmstat question
Message-ID: <9e0a3578041016081820c5d812@mail.gmail.com>

Can someone explain how to track down which processes are waiting to
run when listed by vmstat?  For example, vmstat might show 15 procs
waiting for run time.  How can I find out what those processes
actually are?  Or more importantly, how can I determine what is
bogging the system down?
Here's a sample output from vmstat:

   procs                      memory      swap          io     system      cpu
 r  b  w   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in    cs us sy id

Well, I haven't attended an advanced topics meeting before, but this one
looks very interesting. 

Russell, do you post an abstract with things we should know to avoid stupid
questions? I'm not an expert in this but curious about the parallelism
(loop-level vs. process level, multiple CPUs in one computer vs multiple
computers, MIMD with message passing vs SIMD, that sort of stuff), the
mathematics (finite element?), and the tools (GSL? GMP? plotting?). I
suspect you use a database and how you designed that is also interesting.

Thanks for offering to do this.

 -Ted

Don't worry about the stupid questions.  Although I think it was in
Zot's original design, we stopped throwing things at people a long
time ago.  I think this is going to be mostly a sort of case study of
how I solved a series of problems involved.

The more your questions drift away from how I actually ended up doing
things, the more likely my answer is likely to be a simple "I don't
know".  I'll talk a little about what I thought about, what I tried,
and what didn't work (at least for me) also.

Ted> Thanks for offering to do this.

If I were you, I'd reserve judgement until afterwards, but I guess I
should say "you are welcome" now quickly, before you can withdraw it. ;-)

   How gracious! But, what happens in the winter when the passes are closed
and the road over Mt. Hood is all ice? :-) It's been bad enough with
rush-hour traffice between Portland and Vancouver.

Well, that's the first thing that caught my eye.  Looks like some
runaway process hoovered up all your memory and triggered the OOM
Killer.

Wonder what it was?

oom-killer is the evidence that your kernel has exhausted its memory 
supply and is now killing off what it considers to be low-priority 
processes.

It could be that your hardware is at fault, but my first hunch is that 
you've got a runaway application that's eaten up all available 
physical and virtual memory. Errant database queries can do that in a 
hurry, but that's only one possibility.

Can you run top on TomServo? If so, press 'M' to sort the processes by 
memory usage to see if anything stands out.

   Well, part of my problem is the usual confusion between "absolute" and
"fixed" positioning. Got that straightened out.

   However, two pages varing only in the amount of body content display
differently; both incorrectly, too.

   Is there someone who will look at the xhtml and css code (both of which
validate on the W3C tests, by the way) and teach me why I'm not getting the
behavior I want and how to get that consistency in presentation?

TIA,

Rich

Actually, right after I sent my first reply, I tried it (should have been
"haven't" above) and it worked like a charm.

Subject: [PLUG] EWRT workshop was fun
Message-ID: <20041017051151.GB2349@gate.kl-ic.com>

Today (saturday October 16) the Personal Telco Project had a EWRT
hack day.  The EWRT project takes a linux-based Linksys WRT54G
router and modifies the firmware;  in this case, adding a nocat
splash page and local content web pages.  Brandon Psmythe of
Portless Networks talked about this project at Advanced Topics in July.  

In any case, today we had about 20 people merrily crosscompiling and
loading up their WRTs with all sorts of interesting things.  I would
have announced the meeting to PLUG, but we were pretty full and it was
Linux Clinic day besides.  However, it might be a worthwhile thing to
do in a separate room at a future Linux Clinic;  especially if we could
prepare some fast local server space to store the working environment
for people to grab.

Note, right now we are working with the $60 WRT54G devices, not the
more-expensive WRT54GS speedboost devices.  The latter will probably
be supported someday (or now, if you want to do the port) but are not
the right thing to buy for now.

So, we had fun with our little $60 Linux boxes.  Plan on more fun
in the future.

Wrong tool for this, run `top`. Default sorting order is by usage of
processor time. Processes trying to use lots of processor time are
obviously candidates you're looking for. Depending on the flavor of top
pressing 'M' will tell it to sort by resident memory usage. By forcing
the system to swap, processes using lots of memory can also slow things
down.

You might of noticed that it was a series of repeats of the same pattern?
In such cases what occurs early is most important, and what occurs last
is sometimes important. Pretty often the stuff in the middle is
unimportant. Sometimes the whole thing is important, but here where it is
pretty well identical throughout we only needed a slice near the top.

This could be a triggering event, or it could be an unrelated event.
Either way, this is of note but it isn't the main thing.

Exactly what it says. Notice that the first letters of "Out of Memory"
are "oom". Either you need more swap, or you need to remove things from
this system.

You've got memory overcommitting enabled (I believe this is the default
with 2.6). One or more processes are growing very large, so large that
you're exhausting all memory plus swap. With memory overcommitting, the
process already thinks it has a page allocated so the kernel can't give
it an error that it is out of memory.

So a very simple coping strategy, it simply kills whichever process tried
to allocate memory, another strategy is to simply randomly kill a
process. Definitely a bad thing, but it is either that or randomly
panic.

So, more swap, or remove something. I'm noticing the main thing being
killed were kdeinit processes. I also notice you have Postgress running.
If this is a desktop, then it is a good idea to whack Postgress, if this
is a server then KDE is a very good candidate for whacking.

What should I expect for AV?  

I recall we used the big-screen TV last month.  I've been fiddling
with the TV-out on my laptop and so far failing under Linux (it is an
ATI Rage Mobility M3 on a Compaq Presario 1800T).  If we're stuck with
the TV, I might have to do it from, *urk*, W2K.

A projector would be better if we can swing it.  Can someone let me
know please?

Thanks!

top was the first program I ran before vmstat and it didn't show
anything unusual.  The CPU is close to 100% idle all the time.  I'm
guessing it's memory bound and the swapping is slowing things down. 
vmstat shows the si and so values to be almost identical to the bi and
bo values, so this leads me to believe that nearly all the disk
activity is swap related.  Does this sound correct?
Thanks,

Anyone else out there using KMail? I've been fiddling with it for a few weeks. 
I like it because it is so familiar; I've been living on Netscape for years.

One thing I haven't been able to find is where they expect to find a signature 
file. Some of the documentation is great, but some of it is a little thin. 
Anyone know where to look for this one?

I don't use kmail, but $HOME/.signature is the old-time standard. Have 
you tried that filename?

~/.sig is what I always used when things wanted a file.

Are you sure kmail wants a *file*?  It's probably a configuration
setting somewhere...

Try Settings->Configure Kmail->(select the account you want to set up a sig 
for,)->Modify

When that window comes up it is the last tab.. you will have a few options.. 
from a static file to output of a command (fortune or what have you,)

Hope this helps..

I just went through this with my HP laptop.

Do you know what PCMCIA chipset your laptop has?

Yes, very much, thanks.

Thanks to Paul and Rob, for your suggestions. Some day I may need to know

If the above was during the times of sluggishness, then it isn't either
of these. What are you doing that seems to be slow? Graphics? (slow
integrated graphics chip?) Disk activity? (DMA turned on?)

I guess I missed this thread, but as Wil has said we have things in
hand pretty well.

We have backups of the data from the old PLUG server, and Wil is
putting a new server up for us - thanks to nakedape.com.

I have a few personal domains at MicroSharp, but these are very low band width
and I can afford to have some down time on these.  I will probably put
these on a server in my house for them.

                                                                      
                        David Mandel

P.S.  DavidMandel.com and most of my other domains are down at the
moment, and I
         have more pressing items than getting these back on-line.
         If you need to contact me via email, send it to
dmandel at PioneerPacific.edu.
         DavidMandel.com should be back up in a week or so.

   Then you do not have a driver loaded for the card. Try searching google
for that card +linux and find a Web site that will tell you what driver it
wants loaded.

Subject: [PLUG] [Fwd: Cyrus Delete/Rename user]
Message-ID: <4173FD14.8060205@comcast.net>

I'm running Fedora Core 2 with the latest versions of Postfix and

Cyrus.  I need to delete and rename users but the documentation I have 
isn't working for me so I'm wondering if the commands have been changed 
in the latest version or if I'm missing something.  Here is what I have 
for these commands:

To Delete a user:
1) logon as cyrus user
2) Go into cyradm, connect to server, and login
3) setaclmailbox user.johndoe cyrusadm d  ( I also tried changing 
cyrusadm to cyrus since I logon as cyrus)
4) deletemailbox user.johndoe

Here is what I get in response "deletemailbox: Permission denied"

To Rename (followed same steps (1-3) as shown above):
renamemailx user.johndoe user.fredflintstone
renamemailbox: Operation is not supported on mailbox

Any help is much appreciated.

Thanks

Subject: [PLUG] BIND slow to restart- sometimes
Message-ID: <35060.207.173.0.68.1098125318.squirrel@207.173.0.68>

Running 9.2.1 at home hosting a few domains and reverse dns for two
netblocks.  Dunno for sure if it was just coincidence or not, but when
adding the zone files for the latest domain, BIND started sometimes taking
literally a few minutes to start working again after a restart (or even a
system reboot).
Subsequent restarts of named will usually go off without a hitch, ready in
just a second or less.  It never fails to start, but sometimes just takes
a few minutes to load all the zone files.
Any idea what would cause this slowness?
<http://sparky.woo-hoo.com/badbind.txt>
The log excerpt above shows two manual named restarts.  The first one
starting at 11:13:53 was over by 11:13:55 (meaning all the zone files were
loaded and name resolution was responsive).
The next reload, at 11:14:10, did not finish until 11:16:46, a good 2.5
minutes or so later.  No change in the zone files, nothing, just a
"service named restart" and the results shown.  "top" reported no excess
CPU utilization during the reload and name resolution on that server
resulted in only timeouts throughout.
The slow restart does not happen all the time (I can never "make" it
happen), apparently just at random, and sometimes during bootup.  When
that happens the startup is especially slow as any services relying DNS
get bogged down.
Could it be a problem with my zone file(s)?  If the zones were hosed up,
wouldn't it be slow all the time?  FWIW, I have never noticed the slow
restarts after removing the suspect problem zones' reference from
named.conf (but have not tested enough to be sure).  Here are the zones:
<http://sparky.woo-hoo.com/badzone.txt>
Thanks for any advice on fixing this problem.

Subject: [PLUG] Finally back up...
Message-ID: <1098131449.7205.25.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I ordered a Cantenna on ebay that is evidently not painted but
coated.  It has an N type connector and is advertised as having
a range of at least a little over 1 mile.
It cost me about $40.  

My DSL has been out for week and I've come to the decision that
I want to solve this problem by building a community wireless 
network in Scappoose.  Even if I were to buy cable, $41.95 
extra a month is a lot.  You aren't allowed to run your 
own mail or web servers on Comcast.  I'm also wary of whether
or not Comcast cable service in Scappoose is any better in
addition to what the time commitments are on cable.  Can you
do 1 month of cable?  

The problem here in Scappoose is a technician at CenturyTel
that botched an equipment upgrade.  It only wiped out five
people in one exchange of which we were one of those five.  
Had there been a wireless patch into a neighboring exchange
or even to a functional person in the same exchange, I may 
not have gone down entirely.

Whether I target a local cable customer and offer to pay 
$5/day when I need to go through them or establish a
cooperative I'm not sure yet.  What I'd like to do is 
run a radio link throughout Scappoose and into Opus
headquarters in the Yeon area.  At least I think that
503-972-6690 goes to a business in that area.

The Cantenna needs to be connected to a Zew 1300B pci card 
made by Zonet.  I'm going to need at least two of these
if it's any good, but I don't know how I'd order another 
one from this guy.

Here's a link to the cantenna I purchased off of EBay:

http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&rd=1&item=5131646971&ssPageName=STRK:MEWA:IT

I have been down since 8:30 last Monday.  At least Opus gave me a
dial-in backup.

Message-ID: <477eba8c04101814173d01bc3d@mail.gmail.com>

Hello PLUG,

I've lurked for a couple weeks now, this is my first post:

I ssh'ed from work into my home box just now and the connection seemed
really slow.  My first instinct was to browse the logs and I found
about a million attempts to log into my box like this one:

Oct 18 07:39:13 murdockfamily sshd(pam_unix)[11742]: authentication
failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser=
rhost=210.116.107.105  user=root
Oct 18 07:39:15 murdockfamily sshd[11742]: Failed password for root
from ::ffff:210.116.107.105 port 42409 ssh2

This was all around 7 am this morning, none lately.  Would a bunch of
failed attempts like this cause any slowdown hours later?  Is there
something else going on here?

Bryan

This sort of attempt at breaking in via weak ssh passwords is, sadly, 
all too common. You can reduce the number of incidents by running ssh 
on a non-standard port (personally, I like port 222).

The only other alternative of which I'm aware is to block inbound ssh 
packets from certain IP blocks; tcp_wrappers or iptables can 
accomplish this. I've not taken that route, however, because I like 
the idea that I can ssh into my machines from anywhere on the 
Internet.

It could be slow or badly configured DNS. If you login to your system 
and type "host some.fqdn" (where 'some.fqdn' == an obscure Internet 
hostname that's unlikely to be cached on your system), does host 
return a hostname quickly?

Also... Make sure you DISALLOW login as root through ssh. Only allow

This is good advice -- but it's easy to hose yourself if your 
authentication server is unavailable and you get your login 
information via NIS, LDAP, or whatever.

In that case, always create a local user with a hard-to-guess but 
easy-to-remember username so you can still login when network 
authentication is unavailable.

It's redhat 9 and I don't have a root.hints file.  I do have
/var/named/named.root and it lists all the same root servers as your
command above, and all the ip addresses are the same (and dated Jan 29
2004).  Same deal?

Thanks

It did return quickly at the time, so I don't think it was DNS.  The
slowness went away after a little while too (unfortunately?  makes it
hard to debug anyway...).  Some quircky thing I guess.

Thanks for the lighting-quick replies!  Sorry I'm so slow in mine.

You should only have to define $ORIGIN just once per zone file. Actually 
IIRC the newer version of bind does not even require that it be defined. 
  None of the 14 zones files of my have it.


One last thing is the $GENERATE,  is this really needed?  Why generate 
resource records for hosts that probably don't exist?

K, will try trimming that out.

Here is where my ignorance will show.  The need for the $GENERATE is due
to the fact that am doing a reverse zone for only a /28; BIND presumes you
are delegated the entire /24 otherwise?  In this case the zone file only
covers this guy's actual IP subnet x.x.x.144 through .159, or 16 addresses
resulting in CIDR /28.

The $GENERATE tells this machine to refer back to the, uh, parent(?) name
servers which really hold (or have delegations) for the rest of the
reverse zone for the /24.  Without doing so this server would think it had
been delegated the whole /24 which it has not.

Make any sense whatsoever?

And so will mine.  If your ego can stand it, a public display of 
ignorance/stupidity (hard to tell which one it is sometimes) can be a 
great learning experience.  Then one hopes that a  DNS 
guru/master/sensei will step in and show the error of your ways. 
Imparting knowledge/enlightenment/wisdom to your pathetic life.  Oops, 
sorry.  Been watching too much anime.

I can only say that, sadly it does.  I have been party to only one CIDR 
reverse DNS party.  It was mine, a /27, Qwest is the holder of the IP's 
according to ICAAN.  Painful, research intensive, probably spent 80 
hours trying to find examples that worked.  Fortunately I asked a guru 
who helped me.  Also pestered the bejeezus out of the Qwest NOC DNS 
support staff.  Mine did not require any $GENERATE wizardry, but that 
may be only due to the requirements of the actual authoritative Name 
Servers for the ip block that my subnet is a part of.  Doubtless other 
authoritative Name Servers admins will have differing requirements.  If 
you're willing go to www.dnsstuff.com and do a mx record lookup on my 
domain.  Then using www.dnsstuff.com do a "Reverse DNS" lookup on the ip 
address of the "A" record for my mail server and note the search path 
that develops from the query.  You'll notice that when it gets to 
Qwest's Name server it uses  a CNAME record to refer to my Name server.

DNS tools I've learned to love:

	dig,  obviously
	www.dnstools.com,  too bad there is no command line equivalent.
	vi,  well actually, vim.
	http://groups.google.com/advanced_group_search?hl=en ,  focusing
		of course on the comp.os.protocol.bind.* hierarchy
	any variant of obfuscated bind/named reference beit in man,
		info, infodoc form.  Pure and true learning by suffering
		exists in this path.

It says that for root...

Won't say that for anyone else.

I'm trying to use awk to print several columns, however, I also want
to run an external script on one of those columns.  So, for example:

cat $1 | tr -s ' ' | cut -f1,7,8 -d' ' | awk "{print $1,`foo.pl $1`,$3,$2}"

This, of course, doesn't work.  Basically I want to run foo.pl on
awk's $1 and not bash's $1 and then print that value as the second
column.

Any ideas how to do this?
Thanks,

This initiative is doing really well. The number of contributers has
increased by over 200 in the hour since I upped the ante by thirty
bucks. 1980 of the hoped for 2500 at last count - and ten more days to
go.

Not sure about the foo.pl part, but you could simplify that a lot:

 $ cat $1 | tr -s ' ' | cut -f1,7,8 -d' ' | awk '{ print $1,$3,$2 }'

is the same as:

 $ awk '{ print $1,$8,$7 }' $1

Note for third parties, the two $1 are different: within the awk
script it refers to the first field; at the end, it is a shell
variable, presumably referring to a filename.

You could use the --assign option to awk:

 $ awk --assign=TURD=`foo.pl $1` '{ print $1,TURD,$8,$7 }'

Untested.

Do it all in perl?

while (<>) {
  tr/ / /s;
  @columns = split;
  @columns = @columns(1,7,8); #Check for 0 based indexing versus 1 based
  ##Do what foo.pl does here
  print join ',', @columns;

I do not know if we have a working projector.  The one I have only works
reliably with the s-video connector.

Russell's talk will be on computation of electric fields and electric field exposure near transmission line towers.  It
threads its way through a variety of free software tools, kind of cool
distributed parallel processing that various PLUG members helped him out
with, and assorted other details and problems.

Usual meeting rules apply. Void where prohibited by natural law.

Dan Young has volunteered to bring one this time, so unless he gets
hit by a bus in the interim, I guess we're set.  I've even got a

Subject: [PLUG] Xconq GIS Help Wanted
Message-ID: <200410192019.38001.cooper@cooper.stevenson.name>

Dear All,

A few weeks ago I came up with what I thought was a great idea. I thought, 
"what would happen if people could play a strategy game with real-world 
terrain? What would happen if you could run military campaigns in the 
Columbia Gorge?

I first embarked to see if I could create maps with actual GIS data. Sure 
enough, you can! I wrote a HOWTO (with screenshots) here:

  http://wiki.xconqgis.org/index.php?UsgsMapImportHowto

Yeah, I know it's cool.

Here's a screenshot of what a GIS game map might look like sans units:

  http://wiki.xconqgis.org/index.php?WhatGisImageMightLookLike

Then I started looking around for a mature strategy game platform that I could 
incorporate the GIS data in. I found Xconq. Xconq is well known by many 
strategy gamers as it's been actively developed for years. I liked the 
project so much I developed a new website for it:

  http://www.xconq.org

Note: There's also a generic strategy game framework here:

  http://regcom.sourceforge.net/index.html

The best way to incorporate GIS data into Xconq is by converting an ASCII GIS 
output file to an Xconq input file. Don't worry, you don't have to understand 
the ins-and-outs of Xconq to see what needs to happen.

Here's the good news:

  * Exporting GIS data into ASCII may be automated using just one command

  * The ASCII file format is simple

Here's the bad news: 

  * I haven't written (but do respect) the C language in a long time and it 
shows; I've had a tough go of it getting the application to work.

I think it's time to ask for help.

As I mentioned above, the GIS ASCII file format is simple. Here's a 
description:

 The first 7 or so lines represent the header of the file. The most relevant 
numbers for our purposes are the "rows" and "cols" numbers. The last line is 
the actual elevation (or landcover) data. Here's an example:

  north: 3980319.16466812
  south: 3978824.85093895
  east: 443960
  west: 442296
  rows: 747
  cols: 832
  10 10 10 9 9 ...........

Each number represents a terrain type. Well, that's not exactly true, but it's 
close. 1-3 say, is beach, 4-6 is plains and so on.
 
So if you want an area of 54 x 42 cells, you would want to sample a "box" of 
13 x 20 cells. 

In other words:

  1) Sample the first 13 numbers across by 20 lines down. A "mode" calculation 
(the number that shows up the most)  is best. An average will do I think. 
Export this number to a terrain file; this is the first cell type.

  2) Jump to the next "box," i.e. column 14-27 while still on lines 1-20 and 
output it to a file. This is the second cell type.

  3) Repeat until the file is finished.

Here is my code so far:

  http://www.xconq.org/ascii/parsegis.c

Here is the actual GIS file (Huge: 21M):

  http://www.xconq.org/ascii/seattle.arx

If you can offer a little help I'd be greatfull.


Thanks,


Cooper

My first question for you is... what made you chose C?

IMHO, C is really going a few steps too low when what you're really
doing is advanced text manipulation.  It seems to me a scripting
language such as Python (or perl) might be better suited to this task
(and less prone to sloppy code causing problems).

I just thought of something that might be kind of fun.  

My laptop has wifi with the hostap driver, which means it can be
configured in master mode.  If someone brings an access point, it'll
be even easier.

If people bring wifi-enabled laptops and can compile a C++ application
consisting of two source files, you could connect to my laptop and run
slaves during a demonstration.  Probably need to configure your
network manually, since my laptop probably won't have DHCP by then.

Email me for details.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.52.0410200329040.16587@shaft.bitmine.net>

So, I've got a fairly straightforward but not totally simple apt
arrangement here (with a tiny bit of pinning and a handful of sources) and
I kind of want to rebuild my system for my own reasons.

Anyway, I thought it might minimize my down-time if I could just download
all of my currently installed packages (my cache is empty at the moment)
so the debs for those packages I choose to reinstall will be handy when it
comes time to reinstall them.

Can anyone think of a simple way to do this?  I just want to walk down my
list of installed packages and download them from their respective
sources.

All suggestions welcome.

Cheers.

$ apt-get

It seems you could just do this:

# apt-get -d install <packages>

I haven't tried it.

Check the debian-user archives, this comes up often enough that people

Actually, I was a bit hasty here, as you will get currently installed
programs, with updates overwriting some, depending on when your last
"apt-get upgrade" was.  Also, I forgot to mention that your package
database needs to indicate that the packages are newly "updated", to
force re-downloading.  I'm using an RPM based distribution, and don't
have a Debian machine handy, so don't know and can't verify a quick
reset.  I suspect you could figure this out as fast as I could, anyway.

So:
1) Reset package database to think it has not downloaded or installed
any of your current packages, as if all were freshly updated.
2) apt-get -d upgrade

I suspect you wanted a quick answer to step 1.  Sorry.

I've been using Red Had for years, but I'm thinking about making a
change. I downloaded the 8 Debian CD images yesterday (after finding
that they don't sell them at Fry's anymore.)

I attempted to install today. I basically chose all the defaults,
and got as far as the first reboot. The system came up okay and after
that I verified that I wanted to install from CD. I said
I wanted "ALL" in the "task select" screen. It had me scan each CD
and then started installing from CD #1. A little ways into this, I
started getting continuous "no space left on device" errors.

I'm using a 20Gig drive. After the initial scan, I *believe* it
said it was going to use somewhere between 1 and 2 gig of space.

I guess my question is simply have I missed something obvious, or
is 20Gig not really enough. And, would I be better off finding
somewhere to buy a set of disks?

If you've got the broadband to download ISOs, you've got the bandwidth
to just get the ~120 meg netinst.iso [1] to install the base, then
install whatever other packages you want off the network.  I
personally have a hard time imagining being happy with debian without
broadband.  And if you've got broadband, you don't need or even want
the 8 CDs.

Curiosity got me.  Couldn't leave well enough alone.  Did some research.

To download a list of packages that are already installed:
	apt-get -d --reinstall install <list of packages>

To download all packages currently installed:
	apt-get -d --reinstall upgrade
Should work, but doesn't for at least my apt version (0.5.15cnc6), which
is running on Fedora Core 2 using rpm's.  Or maybe:
	apt-get declean  or
	apt-get dirty
But, alas not valid.  The information on what is installed is in
/var/cache/apt/lists (/var/cache/apt/genpkglists on Fedora).  Except,
that directory is empty on my machine, and a binary file seems to have
the information, /var/cache/apt/genpkglists.bin -- maybe only on
RPM/Fedora machines.

Now that you have my curiosity up, I will have to check yum and
redcarpet.  Have better things to do, but just got to know now!

Good luck,
- Peter

TOT - Terribly Off Topic.  Well OS wise since I can't test thin on my 
Linux system at home right now.

I've been noticing the last week or so that Mozilla 1.7.3 (Windows) is not
displaying images that are specified in the (X)HTML incorrectly.  Hech
there appeas to be a lot of incorrectly formatted tags.  Mostly I'm seeing
sites that send the attribute values un-delimited ie. no double quotes
around them.  I noticed this today when I went to Amazon.Com to order from
a Wishlist and there were no buttons on many of the pages and the fianl 
page had not image but a big honking image map.

I'd hit Bugzilla with this but that last time was less than fruitful.

Any hints, pointers, or ideas?

I agree with Rob on this one.  Converting/resampling the GIS data
using perl should be pretty easy.  Here is a model for most of my
"translation" perl scripts:

+ figure out what the input looks like, put it in a comment
+ figure out what the output should look like, put it in a comment
+ read the whole input file into a complex hash of hashes data
structure suitable for the input data
 o In the Old Days this was a big no-no because of the memory
required, nowadays memory is fairly plentiful so even those monster
20MB GIS files probably won't overload your PC
 o If there's a perl module to parse the data input, use it
+ pull out the data you want from this monster hash and manipulate it
as needed into a new data structure suitable for your output data
 o Sometimes I'll omit this second data structure and just print it,
if the output is line-oriented
+ iterate over the output structure to send the info to the right
place (screen, CSV file, HTML, XML, database, etc.)
 o If a perl module is available for the API I need, use it!

For your project, this should be maybe 1 or 2 days' work for someone
marginally familiar with perl, or maybe a week for a total newbie.

The hard part is getting good data structures figured out.

I agree completely with you guys on this. If I had my way I would write this 
in Perl or shell script in a "New York Minute." 

Xconq is cross-platform so we have to write it in C. This ensures that Windows 
users will have the ability to import GIS data.

Let me stress, however, that I am absolutely in your corner on the script 
thing, If I had a choice I would absolutely use a scripting language. If you 
have some ideas on how I may get away with using Perl et al. while 
maintaining cross-platform compatibility, please let me know.

Okay, thanks. I'm trying an install over the network now. It seems
to be going better. I guess it will be a while before I know for sure.
This does make me think of the (OT) question of whether DSL is
broadband or baseband, but I don't know if that distinction is even
made anymore.

Comcast says it is disallowed, but their techs (a year or 2 ago) say if
you have servers that you use privately, that no one would bother me.

Don't know about the radio link speed and necessary equipment, but if
you have line-of-sight to another Internet user with a good connection,
a pair of discarded satellite TV antennas work well as far as you can
see connected to wireless equipment and homemade heads on the antennas. 
Plans for this are on the Internet, I don't remember where -- Google.

Comcast, if they find out will be very unhappy, and cut you and your
friend off.  But, it is difficult for them to find out, if you are using
a single computer as a gateway.  Also, their broad band is very
asynchronous (3 Mb down / .25 Mb up)!  But, that doesn't matter for web
surfing and downloads.

Qwest DSL doesn't care how you use your connection, and allows servers
and sharing.  You can also get multiple lines and load balance a whole
neighborhood.  Plus, I get 1.5 Mb down /.75 Mb up bandwidth, and don't
have to pay for email or web pages -- I get a much better deal through
lowcost-web-hosting.net ($8.45/year domain reg. + $1.20/*year* hosting
(50MB + 500MB bandwidth/month).

Hum that's what I thought ActiveState was all about.  Yeah so they have to 
install ActiveState Perl or IndigoStar Perl (for those unaware that there 
is -- at least -- one other option).  A bugger for a dialup connection but 
that's what CD-RWs is all about.

How many of those using it would have a C/C++/C# compiler?  But a binary 
would be nice.  Hey that's why I bought perl2exe so I could build a .exe 
for several of my perl scripts on Windows systems.  And I'd be more than 
willing to compile it for all.

   Along with this I wrote a few Perl scripts many years ago (10+) to
convert MOSS and DEM formatted data files to AutoCAD script input.  This
was in the i386 days so the import to AutoCAD of a USGS quad (from the
MOSS data) took nearly a hour.  We would also convert the DEM data into
contours and import that.  Pretty slick if I say so myself.  When I view
the Perl code now I cringe.  Well it was for Perl 4 on a DOS system.

So if it would be of any help I'll offer them up for slice and dice.

Of course I should have looked at the links first.  My code would be of
no use since the data is in SDDS (and friends) format.  Sorry.

Hi everyone,

We have a K12LTSP lab here and I'm trying to resurect these old macs
to be clients for the lab.  I got Debian installed on the machine with
a 2.6.8.1 kernel!  I want the machine to connect to the server via `X
-indirect <ip address>`. This works great.  I created an init script
that runs that command so that when the machine boots it automaticaly
shows the XDMCP server list.  The problem I am having is that when the
students use "ctrl + alt + bkspc" to logout they find themselves at a
console login.  I want it to act like GDM.  So that when they hit
those xserver kill keys they find themselves back at the server list. 
Any ideas?

Python... there is a free python2exe thing available somewhere... but
python under win32 isn't all that difficult to begin with.

Python is all about being cross-platform capable.

I wrote a little shell-thingie to do this.  I guess I was just too tired
last night to put all the little pieces together.  It's actually quite
simple:

dpkg --get-selections|grep -v deinstall|sed -e 's/	.*//'|while read
file; do apt-get -dy --reinstall install $file; done

That seems to be working on a file by file basis.  I'd like to hand them
all to apt for one big download, but that seems harder even if it'd be a
little faster.

I will bring my Ewrt-upgraded WRT54G, which does do DHCP, and we can
use it as a wired hub (4 wired ports), plus B (11Mbps) wireless.  I
will configure it to channel 11, the SSID is "klic".  I think there
is already a pay wireless site somewhere near Jax, so we may have to
move the channel to avoid it.

The WRT is set to offer DHCP addresses at 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.149.

Changing subnets on WRTs is not impossible, but a little tricky (one
mistake and you can't administer it any more, and you have to reset it
and start from scratch).  I hope Russell can set his machine to a fixed
IP address of, say, 192.168.1.9 , and we can all connect to that. 

Russell, you want to show up a half hour early so we can debug this thing?

Something like this happened to me a while back.  It turns out that the
problem was operator error - I'd tried to block an ad, and ended up blocking
images from the whole domain.

Trever Marshall's BiQuad 802.11b Antenna is what you're referring too.
http://www.trevormarshall.com/biquad.htm

We had an Antenna Mod Workshop once.. 

http://www.personaltelco.net/gallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=AntennaModWorkshop01

They end up making really huge cumbersome antennas that work pretty darn
well on the cheap. But you can usually do it for a reasonable amount of
money, 30-50 bucks, with more professionally built antennas. Like the
8dBi patch antennas or the 12dBi Yagi's(probably over kill if you're
doing point to point less than a mile) 
http://netgate.com/product_antennas.html 

Or even two cantennas you build yourself for that matter.
http://www.netscum.com/~clapp/wireless.html

There are many interesting ways something like this can be accomplished.
I'd be happy to fill in some of the gaps if you have more specific
questions about the type of link you're thinking of creating.

Subject: [PLUG] X11 to remote client
Message-ID: <20041020232926.GA9585@gate.kl-ic.com>

I want to display X programs on a local client, from a remote server,
using ssh.  I expect there is a correct, automagical way to do that.
Right now, it involves jumping through a couple of hoops.

# locally, in a client xterm:

client> xhost +server


# in another client xterm, ssh'ed to the server:

server> export DISPLAY=client:0.0
server> an_X_application

... and that will pop up an X window for an_X_application on my client
screen.  But I expect that I can accomplish the same thing with by
twiddling, say, .bashrc on the server and /etc/ssh/<someconfigfile>
on the client.  Or something.  

What is the correct way to do this?

Well that's what I thought also and I 'un-blocked' everything but had no 
need to go back to the site.  In fact the site wasn't on the list.  Who 
knows.  Just one more reason to really hate MS Windows.
   I'll test them tonight at home on a computer with a real OS!  Then 
maybe update Mozilla and see if it still happens.


Thanks,
Rod

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0410201638150.21096-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I'm on a roll today it appears.  Is there a package for doing 
pseudo-windows in a console screen?  Curses is the ticket but I hoping for 
something that made it easier ... like the old 4DOS package did.

I'm trying to monitor several process on a headless server via ssh login.  
One is the colorized output of tail -f /var/log/maillog which would be 
fine in the bottom 10-15 lines.  I have, currently, one other that 
monitors the Postfix queues every 30 seconds but only needs 5 lines or so 
and around 20 character columns.
   Having both scripts running (background) and writing to their screen 
areas would make it very nice and pretty cool also.

So is there something like this out there?

I assume you're referring to ssh clients and servers, rather than X
clients and servers.

I don't know an an automagical way to do _exactly_ that, but there is
this (from ssh(1) openssh man page):
     -X      Enables X11 forwarding.  This can also be specified on a per-host
             basis in a configuration file.

             X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the
             ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the
             user's X authorization database) can access the local X11 display
             through the forwarded connection.  An attacker may then be able
             to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring.

If you're running a local X server, just ssh -X to the remote host.. and 
run a gui app.

This should work by default, but if not, there's some ssh and sshd 
options that deal with enabling X11 tunneling.

There is. A note first: the export DISPLAY= thing is not secure. There is a 
secure way to export displays using encrypted X cookies but this seems to 
have been superseded by running an X display through SSH.

Here's how:

  ^^^^^^ Note: That is the server side.  X is backwards.

Correct, open X to allow connections from the remote client.

Then on the same server enter:
# ssh -l <username> <host> <an X application>

Accept keys as needed and enter your password:

Before talking about stuff like this, you need to be sure to put your
X11 hat on.  Remember that the display that you look at is managed by
an X11 *server*.  The applications that are displayed on the screen
are X11 *clients*.

In your case, I'm guessing that you want to run an X11 application(the
client) on a remote system and have the output displayed on your local
screen(the X11 server).  Since you have ssh set up, a simple way to do
this is:

  ssh -X remote_system remote_application

For instance:

  ssh -X remote_system xclock

should run the xclock application on your remote system and display the
output on your local system, which is running an X11 server.

You want screen.

<URL: http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/ >

But if you want to view them simultaneously, well, I'm not sure how one
could do that.  Screen only creates full-screen windows.

Hmm... what would be the negative effects of building screen functionality
into bash?

For me should is still not a word to use.  I've putzed around like crazy 
and go nowhere.  The interesting thing is taht the link on hte Web site 
is:

	http://www.kpbx.org/audio/listenonline/kpbx.m3u

But is I do a wget on it I get:

	http://dj.argia.net:8000/kpbx

I've tried both in xmms (mplayer tonight or tomorrow AM) with no results.  
Xmms acts like I'm not even there!
   Anyone have a site they know works so I cna test to see if I have 
firewall issues or somesuch other thing?

Not true.  'screen' can split the terminal horizontally.  I think
'splitvt' will also, without all the other stuff that screen does.

I took your URL above and used the following command line:

It's dumping as I type to the file ~/stream.dump

I press CTRL-c to stop the dump, rename the file to stream.ra. Now I 
play it with the command:

mplayer stream.ra

It's playing like it was live.

I found a box with a copy of the old Apple Unix system, A/UX, in my
garage.  I don't remember for sure which Apple's this run on, but it
would be in the m68020/m68030 generation of systems.  It includes
both manuals and cd's.  If I remember correctly, this was based on
one of the AT&T System 5 releases.

If anyone is interested enough to come and pick it up from my house,
they can have it for free.  Otherwise it will be recycled a week or so
from now.

Crazy.  I didn't do deep research, I just saw this line that confirmed my
experience:

<quote src="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">
When screen is called, it creates a single window with a shell in it (or
the specified command) and then gets out of your way so that you can use
the program as you normally would. Then, at any time, you can create new
(full-screen) windows with other programs in them (including more shells),
kill the current window, view a list of the active windows, turn output
logging on and off, copy text between windows, view the scrollback
history, switch between windows, etc. All windows run their programs
completely independent of each other.
</quote>

So I took that to mean it was only capable of full-screen windows.

Hello!

I have subscribed to this list for the past five years and all 
of a sudden last Saturday Something must have happened that has 
caused my to no longer get postings.

I have e-mailed the appropriate people (or at least I think I 
have) an I have not received any as of yet. 

Are any other people having this problem?
Since I am no longer getting postings I have no way of knowing.

Thank you,

I finally relocated the lists to my server tonight.  I've sent a few
test messages and everything seems to be working fine.  Please let me
know if you find anything wrong.  The web interface to Mailman and the
archives should be functional too.

Those who had pdxlinux.org e-mail addresses: Please let me know ASAP
what you'd like the address forwarded to.  Those of you who had .forward
files on drizzle have already been taken care of.  Right now I've got
soft bounces enabled, so it'll sit in my queue until it can be delivered
or I disable the soft bounce.  If I haven't heard from you by mid next
week, I'll assume you're no longer interested.

I also took this opportunity to disable a few of the unused lists; let
me know if any of these should continue to exist for some reason:
  apt-listchanges
  plug-business
  plug-devel
  plug-edu
  plug-government

Thanks!  This looks like the ticket.  His English is a little 'odd' (but
anyone that deals with 2+ languages impresses me) so getting through the
tutorial will be interesting.  Still it looks like just what I need.  It
will be great if it works with(in) a PuTTY terminal connection.

<soapbox>
This brings up one of my pet peeves.  We, in the Linux community, seem to
be driven (or allow ourselves to be driven) towards X-GUI or Web-interface
everything.  Managing servers remotely or from the console can be a pain.  
   I'm probably biased as I tend towards Redhat/Fedora (been using it too 
long and have a tough time breaking the habit) and the local users' group 
(North Idaho) really likes SuSE.  The other distributions probably rely 
less on X-Windows and Web-Interfaces so I'm getting what I ask for.

Thanks for _*ALL*_ the help.

Message-ID: <4177ADFE.3030503@comcast.net>

I have a nasty problem. I'm writing this on my Win 2000 harddrive 
because my Fedora Core I drive won't let me in. My error message is;

/data2: clean, blah, blah,blah

etc., etc., etc,. through all of disk and then

An error occured during the filesystem check.

If I ^-D I just repeat this scenario, but if I give my psswd, I get;

and after a few moments of harddrive action I'm rewarded with;

Repair filesystem2:

And on and on. I've gone up to Filesystem 65, and began to wonder what 
good I'm actually doing. /data1 at block 516 is my obvious problem Can 
someone tell me how to resolve this mess? If nothing else, should I 
upgrade with a CD version of Fedora Core II or another distro so I can 
save my data on the harddrive and then buy a new drive? This same thing 
happened to my wife's drive about one year ago and after getting her 
drive to work about 5 times, I gave up and tried Win 2000 on her drive 
and it has worked perfectly for her ever since. Could it be Fedora 
rather than the drive?

Now that I've whitelisted the list it's getting through. After the
switch, list mail was being quarantined due to the (very aggressive)
MAIL_HOST trap I've got enabled in spasm[1]...

    * SF_MAIL_HOST:  This is a very aggressive filter, and will often
    catch legitimate email. This checks the second-level domain portion
    of the sender's email address against the second-level domain
    portion of the sending server's hostname. If they do not match, the
    message is rejected. This filter will stop messages which have been
    relayed through other servers. However, this means it will also stop
    messages that are legitimately being relayed (e.g. virtual domain
    email).

Part of me wants to stand up and shout, "Amen, brother!" and repeat 
Heinlein's law: "A real server is fully function with only three 
cables: power, ethernet, and serial console." :-)

OTOH, if Linux is really striving for world domination, then it's 
likely that GUI-based administration will become more common, not 
less, in the next few years.

My unscientific observation is that the average computer user 
(Windows, Linux, or otherwise) who needs to manage only a small number 
of systems (say, fewer than five) will be more efficient with a well 
built GUI interface than with its text equivalent.

If you're managing dozens or hundreds of systems, the time invested in 
learning how to script and remotely manage things is time well spent.

For a single system or a small SOHO LAN, learning those skills may be 
cool, but it's probably a less than efficient use of available time.

I think it's highly unlikely that my mom or brother-in-law will ever 
be interested in (much less thrilled by) command-line administration. 
Only a well designed GUI will convince them that Linux is a usable 
alternative to their current OS.

And I agree.  What bothers me most is the console/non-GUI tools are 
disappearing; typically being replaced with a GUI or web only interface 
no text/console or command line option.

I'm a long time Linuxconf user.  I know others have issues with it but
every time one came up I've seen the solution/fix out in a few days.  I
mention Linuxconf because it has all three interfaces (well actually four
if you count the command line options); text/console, gui, and web.  So
for my text/console challenged Windows folks I set up the web based
interface. When I'm on site I do the command line, text/console, or
long-hand.  (Sometimes I'm lazy and use the web interface myself. :-)

So no one loses.  One time I had the gui interface running on my desktop
with connections to three servers.  Kind of cool to just un-minimize an
icon and control a server.

Now back to our regularly scheduled postings.  :-)

Hey I worked for me also.  I don't know what I was doing before.  
Probably a brain-fart.  I even got weird and tried wget on the URL.  It
worked also.

> I press CTRL-c to stop the dump, rename the file to stream.ra.

A problem for sure and when using wget also.  How do I record a one hour
program in the middle of the day each week-day.  Streamripper has a -l
(length) switch but mplayer doesn't and I still have to look at the man
page for wget to see if there is a time/size limit switch/option.

   So the options appear to be hack the mplayer code and add a limiting 
switch which is well beyond my capabilities.  Or find/write a simple 
program/script/whatever to kill the process after a length of time.  

    Before I do this does anyone know, off the top of their head, if such
functionality already exists?


Cheers,
Rod

What do you mean?

$ which vim
/usr/bin/vim

Seems to be there for me... ;)

Ah, sorry. My caffeine level wasn't high enough to understand your 
point.

I have to admit, however, that I have no trouble administering any of 
my systems (Fedora Core, Gentoo, Debian) via the command line.

The only GUI lock-in I've encountered has been in third-party 
applications like MATLAB or Oracle -- and then only during 
installation.

Can I ask what administrative step you encountered required a GUI?

This looks wrong to me, because /dev/hda1 isn't a directory (unless
you're using a non-traditional /dev, e.g. devfs or udev). The manpage
says:
	filesys  can  be  a device name (e.g.  /dev/hdc1, /dev/sdb2), a
	mount point (e.g.  /, /usr, /home), or an ext2 label or UUID specifier
	(e.g.   UUID=8868abf6-88c5-4a83-98b8-bfc24057f7bd or LABEL=root).

So, I think that what you were trying to do was "fsck -y /dev/hda1".

_HOWEVER_, I'm afraid that the "short read" error might indicate that the
disk drive is failing, so running fsck might not be the best thing to do.

I think Debian is more or less not following this trend.

Debian gives you choice.  You can install webmin if you really want
it, but the Debian philosophy is to give you a sane default config
file with lots of comments to help you through configuring everything
with an editor.  debconf (Debian's configuration tool called by apt)
is pretty good about putting comments in configs warning when it might
be more sane to do a dpkg-reconfigure -plow <package> instead, but you
still have options.

No kidding. I've almost entirely forgotten that this mailing list was

Nope.  It'll do split-screen stuff as well.  If there isn't a tutorial
that comes with screen, I'm pretty certain that Google will find you
at least one.

Umm, you only need the first one, not all of them, if you're
installing on a computer with internet access.  No need to use more
bandwidth than you have to getting packages you don't need off the
other CDs.  This is explained in the installation manual.

There's only one reboot.

I strongly suggest you only install what you need instead of all.
Debian is the largest distribution out there, trying to install all
packages.

Start over.  Use the network install once you get to the installation
method part.  Select just the packages you need.

I'd like to keep the governement list up. The News4Neighbors.net recent 
endorsement of Sam Adams for example:

http://www.news4neighbors.net/article.pl?sid=04/10/20/1620253

was partially based on his being open to open source software. We intend 
to continue to press governement officials on their use of Linux and 
open source. However,  posting to the main PLUG list about those 
articles would risk diverting from it's core function of discussing 
Linux technical issues.

Worse yet, many of these interfaces preclude being able to change
things by hand in the configs without screwing up the graphical luser
interface.

You could write a script that starts the program and then ends it
after a certain amount of time by saving the PID and run that through
cron as often as you like.  Hope that helps point you in the right

This was my plan.  I just figured it might be something I'd not needed but 
other had and had scratched the itch.

Works great for the start point.  It's stopping the process when I need it
to -- in one hour.  Heck I use cron to send text messages to my phone to
remind me of specific meetings and even bill payment days.  I don't always
hear my Pilot beep at me but the phone has a really irritating ring for
messages.  Beats the tarnation out of a suspense file!

------------------

Thanks guys!  I thought that was what you are *supposed* to do.
But ... while the -X option does eliminate the need for the
"xhost +ssh-server" command (yay!), I am still having the same problem:

ssh-client> ssh -X ssh-server
Last login: Thu Oct 21 13:49:19 2004 from ...

ssh-server> x-application
X11 connection rejected because of wrong authentication.
X connection to localhost:13.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).

ssh-server> 

     ( ssh-server=X-client , ssh-client=X-server, but you knew that ... )


If I do: 

ssh-server>export DISPLAY=ssh-client:0.0

... then things work. 


Perhaps I need to put something special in my .bashrc on ssh-server to
set the DISPLAY, or perhaps ssh at the ssh-client end is sending the
wrong information to set up the environment on ssh-server.  I do have
"ForwardX11 yes" set in /etc/ssh/ssh_config on both client and server,
and I do not have a personal version of that file in ~/.ssh on either
end.  I have ssh keys in all the appropriate places.  When the error
occurs, nothing appears in the logs for client or server.

Does this narrow the problem and solution down enough?

Greg Kroah-Hartman
Linux Kernel maintainer
IBM
Portland, OR

Current State of the Linux Kernel

This talk will go into the current status of the 2.6 Linux kernel
development process, detailing the prior history of the 2.5 development
process, and attempt to explain the brash claim by the kernel developers
that a 2.7 fork will not happen any time soon as they "are happy the way
things currently are." It will also go into how the development process
for the kernel maintainers has changed without anyone else noticing, and
how the whole kernel development process seems to be breaking all
traditional software engineering rules about how a project should be
successfully run.

Biography

Greg Kroah-Hartman is currently the Linux kernel maintainer of USB, PCI,
and a handful of other subsystems. He is also in charge of the
linux-hotplug and udev projects, along with maintaining the Gentoo Linux
kernel package. He is a contributing editor to Linux Journal, writing a
bi-monthly column about Linux kernel driver programming, and is the
co-author of the upcoming "Linux Device Drivers, third edition" book
from O'Reilly. He works for IBM in Portland, Oregon, doing various Linux
kernel related things.

Subject: [PLUG] Perl hash/array/reference question 
Message-ID: <20041021214308.GB17690@gate.kl-ic.com>


PLUG perl hackers:

I'm learning Perl.  And Randal has the book royalties to prove it.
I am not sure where to ask newbie questions about Perl without some 
disgruntled eurotrash telling me to read some irrelevant FAQ I have
already read.  So I ask locally, because we orytrash are a lot
friendlier ...


I am trying to make a reference to a array referenced in a hash.

This works:

$a_hash{ $key }[0] = $foo ;  # autovivify
$a_hash{ $key }[1] = $bar ;

@an_array = $a_hash{ $key } ;
$an_array_reference = \@an_array ;

Now I do things like:  $fum = $$an_array_reference[1] ;
But not like:          $$an_array_reference[1] = $fum ;
  ... not if I want the element of the original hash array changed.


However, what I really want to do is something like ( pardon my 
strong C accent ):

$an_array_reference = \@a_hash{ $key } ;


I want to be able to write back to an element of the hash of arrays,
and I want to avoid copying arrays around.  

Is this possible?  What is the correct syntax?  What is the correct
thought process that leads to that syntax?  Where can I read about it?

Is there "Less Than One Way To Do It?"

Is the xauth command available on the remote system?  I'm fairly certain
that it is required for X11 forwarding to work.  There is an
XAuthLocation keyword in the ssh_config man page.  Perhaps xauth is
unavailable on your remote system for some reason.

galen

ps  I didn't mean to sound condescending when describing the X11 remote/
local stuff.  I suspected you already knew about it.

Keith> Does this narrow the problem and solution down enough?

The server and client both have to agree to forward X.  Check
/etc/ssh/sshd_config on the server:

  X11Forwarding yes
  X11DisplayOffset 10

You shouldn't have to do anything with DISPLAY.  

Make sure there is an xauth on the server.

Debugging this can make your head hurt, but it is possible.  If you
are still having trouble, run a sshd in debugging mode on the remote host:

 # sshd -d -p <port>

and run ssh in verbose mode on the local host:

 $ ssh -v -X -p <port> <remote-host> xclock

and look closely at the respective messages until you figure it out.

Quick review:

%a_hash is a hash
$a_hash{ $key } is a hash value that is a reference to an array
$a_hash{ $key }[$n] is a value from the array

> $an_array_reference = \@a_hash{ $key } ;

So this should be:

$an_array_reference = $a_hash{ $key } ;

Happy hacking,
Colin

Make sure "which xauth" returns something of use. Otherwise, you'll 
want to locate it on the remote host and insert it into your $PATH.

Also, you'll want to make sure that the $XAUTHORITY environment 
variable is either empty or pointing to $HOME/.Xauthority.

Let me know if I'm barking up the wrong tree here; that's just the 
most typical source of this sort of problem.

Looks like you changed the plug-admin account to the plug-bounces
account, this is an issue if you're using procmail with somewhat tight
rules. In my case where they're very tight this ment I had to scrape the
messages out of a spam trap mailbox. It was nice to have the number of
messages in a digest message listed in the subject line. Not a big deal
but it was nice.

There is a right friendly group right in Portland.

So far they haven't called me anything nasty and I've asked some pretty 
simplistic (ie. stupid) questions.

Thanks, that worked, and thanks for the explanatory logic.  While I
thought I had tried that (the simplest way) before, I must have typo'ed
or maybe think'oed.  

Set a fire for a man, and you warm him for a night.  Set a man on fire,
and you warm him for the rest of his life.  Thanks for lighting my fire. :-)

Out of curiosity, what is the package count up to?

My *unofficial* count in Gentoo is 7729 different packages.

So why not use streamripper?  Kick it off as a user cron job.
(e.g. type 'crontab -e' as a regular user)

Does this mean we're not going to have shell accounts any more?  I liked
having a Debian shell account so I could pop in and see how Debian did
something when helping a crazy Debian-using friend...

I don't think I actively used my Drizzle email, but go ahead and forward
my email (I was user 'athlonrob') to rob at axpr.net to help feed
dspam.  :-)

At least 15,000 from what I recall. Paul Johnson probably knows more 
accurately.

I occasionally found that useful too, but I don't have the resources
(time and expertise, mainly) to run a Debian box, even as an ancillary
shell server.  Maybe in the future.

Done; although it probably won't help train your DSPAM now...

Oh well, I'll try and find somebody else running Debian who might
provide something similar.

What *are* you running on the server?  Any chance you might offer shell
access to it, if it's something I don't have access to?  :-)

8710, though that's according to debian.org, so that only counts
stable.  Keep in mind that sid and testing are almost guaranteed to be
larger.  It's unclear whether or not that includes packages that have
duplicates for the various sub-architectures where such optimizations
actual, real differences that aren't figments of Gentoo's imagination
(maybe a dozen packages, tops).

I'm not quite sure where you get 15,000 from...I tried multiplying the
official count by the number of architectures supported and got over
104,000...but I admit that's sort of cheating...

I couldn't get it to work.  Kept getting an error about no http header 
information.

This is the message I'm getting back.

$ streamripper http://dj.argia.net:8000/kpbx
Warning: splitpoint sanity 
check not yet complete.
Connecting...
 
error -14 [SR_ERROR_NO_HTTP_HEADER]
bye..
shutting down


I'd love to have it work for me but until I can get time to chase down the
problem (probably because this is not a Shoutcast or ICEcast? feed which
is what the documention mentions ) I'll take the 15 minutes to work out my
kludge solution.

If anyone is interested the actual site is:  http://www.kpbx.org (Spokane
NPR station).  Or if there is another local NPR station that works with
streamripper point me and I'll see if I can sort it out.

I saw this but it doesn't seem to apply to -dumpaudio.  Tried it and got 
called names by the program.

I read that number somewhere. I did just find the current answer (at 
least for the i86 arch).

One of my stable boxes:
keith at woody:~$ apt-cache stats
Total Package Names : 11166 (447k)
   Normal Packages: 8896
   Pure Virtual Packages: 225
   Single Virtual Packages: 368
   Mixed Virtual Packages: 114
   Missing: 1563
Total Distinct Versions: 9702 (466k)

One of my testing boxes:

Total Package Names : 18143 (726k)
   Normal Packages: 14168
   Pure Virtual Packages: 243
   Single Virtual Packages: 824
   Mixed Virtual Packages: 149
   Missing: 2759
Total Distinct Versions: 14383 (690k)

My unstable laptop:

   Mixed Virtual Packages: 177
   Missing: 3446

I'm sure that was more info than anybody wanted :-)

   You'd be slapped with violations from the Gorge Commission, EPA and NOAA

Build that into the simulation. Don't just deal with the fantasy of a military 
assault, deal with a real life legal assault! I don't think I'd want to play 
it, but it might be fun for some folks.

Hi all,

I was just wondering if posting notices about Perl Monger meetings
would be inappropriate for this list?  I know that quite a number of
you
dabble in Perl, but I just wanted a quick etiquette check.

Perl meetings, on plug or plug-announce, would be great.  
That way, we can track them down, and ...

Well, now we know you fantasize about pounding on people who dislike
John Kerry.  What a hypocrite.  It's too bad the American prefer 
amoral candidates over moral ones, call them smarter, pretend that
even if the guy never showed up to work in the Senate when he was
in Intelligence that he can somehow do a better job than Bush.

Clinton cut the intelligence budget.  John Kerry will do that when
he realizes there isn't enough money for his social plans.  Iraq
underr John Kerry will become Vietnam because John Kerry doesn't
have the moral courage to fight for the peace there.  He's a pacifist
who can't understand fighting for peace even if the enemy is a muslim
zealot extremist.

I went too far.  I owe Rogan an apology.  But one of the tenets
of American democracy is that I have a right to believe something
and I shouldn't have to hide it because people are too prejudiced 
to deal with it.  I also owe Rogan's mother an apology, she's a 
fine person.

I wish Rogan that you hadn't gone where you did.  I remember going
to church with you and I came to your house once even though I looked
like an idiot.  More recently, you're place in Corvallis impressed me
very much.  It's been a very hard and tiring week.  I was up
till 3 a.m. last night because I'm having trouble with physics.
I don't want you to go to hell, but you seem to hate the church
and as a consequence of that, me too.

Bush isn't perfect, I don't like his stand on capital punishment and he
could do more for the environment.  However, I voted for him because I
believe he deserves a chance to finish in Iraq and I am against the
human experimentation that Kerry wants.  I am also angry at Kerry's 
attitude toward poor people that they have to have abortions.
A loving and decent society says to these people, "we will help you
raise your child."

It is a shame that Kerry who is supposedly Catholic essentially has
decided that it's wrong for any Catholic values to shape American
government in any way.  He will not appoint conservative judges,
he said this in the debates.  I wonder if anyone was listening?  

Should we not love one another including the unborn as we love
ourselves?  Should we not look for God in every person?  Are we
to leave Iraq before it stabilizes condemning the Christian 
population there to ethnic cleansing?  And no, we shouldn't 
just care about the Christians in Iraq.  Our Christian ethic 
tells us to care about muslims even when they are our bitter 
enemies.  

Rogan, I'd like to be treated with more respect even if I say something
that goes too far.  There was once a time that I thought we were
friends.  Even if we are not friends anymore, I don't want to fight 
with you like this.  The election will be over and whoever wins I'm
sure we'll move forward somehow.

To those on the list who are upset, the apology extends to you as well.

     God Bless You Rogan,

     Michael C. Robinson

Well, since no one seems to have any objections...

November 10th, 2004 6:30pm at Free Geek, 1741 SE 10th Ave

Testing with Ovid

We hear a lot about testing, including testimonials, talks, rants, etc.
However, the biggest obstacle to testing is taking those first steps.
At
this meeting, Ovid (that's me) will sit down at his laptop and actually
write a module, from scratch, using test driven development. You'll see
how tests work, how they're applied in the real world and you might
even
learn a thing or two even if you're already comfortable with testing.

Afterwards, as always, beer at the Lucky Lab!

Cheers,
Ovid

Are you sure?  I was taught that when the pronoun is in the subject,
it's "I" and when it's in the predicate, it's "me".  "that's me" has
the pronoun in the predicate, which means the "me" form is correct.

I guess the tricky part is whether "that is X" makes X into a
predicate nominative... Surely, if you had said "this is X", then X
indicates the subject, which makes it a predicate nominative.  But,
since you said "that's X", I'm not so sure.

To justify this post [grin]... Are there any linux tools that help
with grammar?  In particular, I do alot of writing in GNU Emacs... so,
it would be very cool if there were a tool I could summon from emacs.
But, I'd be happy with something for abiword or openoffice.

Not even close sir.  Not even close.  There were postings when I
was trying to write auto blacklisting scripts for Postfix and there
were postings about the Intel 536EP modem as well as a posting 
asking if a wireless antenna I bought recently was a good choice
complete with a link to it.  Those were not political postings
at all.  If you want to go statistics, there are people on
here who make a political statement every single time they post in the
form of a footer.  I consider many of these footers in bad taste
and rude, but I haven't flamed much if at all over them.

"Have a good life."

Why are my political speech rights on this list less 
than those of a person bashing a Republican or praising a 
Democrat?  Noone who talked about the open source bill 
that bashed a Republican got told to "Have a good life."
It should only ever be a complement, but it obviously 
wasn't meant in this way.  

I didn't post that much to this list really and I have
apologized for my excess with Rogan.  But I apologize
to him again now. 

I am tired of the cutting personal nature of what I've been 
getting from people over this.  I don't appreciate being 
called a source of crap.  I don't think anyone on here would 
like to be called this either.  That is right up there with 
the vandalism of Goli Ameri signs near Rock Creek.

Other political statements get on plug so this is where my reply
belongs.  It was a small thing, Rogan was out of line but I was too
and I've already stated this.  I can not respect people pressuring 
me to talk to them directly off list over this and I will not give 
in to that unless the level of respect is very different than what 
I've been getting and I want to respond to them.

There have been constant assaults on Karen Minnis among other
"unpopoular" politicians on here.  I am not the political 
devil here with everyone else being political saints.  And 
no, being a "saint" should NOT be a partisan thing.  Anyone 
who says there are no political excesses on here when I'm
not around is simply a liar.

Many get by and there is nowhere near the flaming that is being
seen in this thread.  I have to tolerate liberal democrats, but 
Oregon is almost 50/50.  The political dialogoue should improve.
It's a shame that the current and former governor aren't calling 
for more civility.  They are not setting a good political example.  
The greater shame is on individuals who have chosen not to behave
in a civil manner.

Politics are relevant to Linux in Oregon because there is an excessive
political bias on this list and clearly people who will make it matter
by saying that you're posting crap instead of saying that you are just
off topic.  A simple one line private message without anything
inflammatory hasn't been good enough for anyone who has responded to my
post publically or privately.

People's political and religious views are not crap, they are views.
Even if someone posts in the wrong place, there has to be a better 
way to treat them than saying, "that's crap."  Ever wonder if political
rudeness is one of the reasons why Al-Qaueda hates us so much?  What
if I were a marginal Al-Qaueda recruit who had just been flamed here?
Arguably the content would be very different, but I still think the
point is very valid.  Some people on here are not being good
representatives of Oregon let alone the United States and I daresay
that the reach of this list is probably world wide.  

Perhaps the sense is that my initial was in bad taste.  Okay, it was.
The reality though is that this list is a little more politically
balanced now, albeit I'm going to get blamed for that.  I belongs on
plug-talk, but I can't get subscribed for some reason so I couldn't
put it there.

I would, but I can't get on and I'm really discouraged about Rogan.
I don't think this is worth it.  If you like, you can take it there.
I was frustrated with the pro Kerry talk at school and made a bad
decision putting this on the list.  I should know by now that it's
dangerous to talk about this topic here or pretty much anywhere
in northwestern Oregon if you're not a liberal Democrat.  Such
is life.  I hope people look at leadership instead of being angry
that we are in a war because it's arguable that that would have
happened eventually anyways and the president was given the 
authority by Kerry himself.  It would be more worthwhile to find
a way to avoid future fights with Rogan.  It may be that my only 
choice is staying away from venues that can put me in contact with 
him, which is too bad really.  I really did go too far, I 
shouldn't have posted that short message.  I am done posting and
sincerely hope any further replies I read to this aren't as bad
as the others I've seen.

Yes, I'm sure.  "Is", in this case, is a linking verb and as such, the
pronoun in the predicate takes the nominative case.  Reference:

The wonder of Linux is that it doesn't discriminate.  It's free to
everyone, anywhere, anytime.  Unlike some people.  We could change
this though, after all it seems like we're all being shoved into
MS-Office and other like programs where the trouble with Linux
is a lack of businesses to take over maintenance for you
when you don't want to do it.  This may especially be a problem
here in Oregon which is approaching 50/50 democrats/republicans.
The ratio of democrats to republicans in computer information 
technology may be higher right now though.  Of course, the latter
assumes that partisan problems here on the plug list characterize
what kind of trouble you'll have off list looking for on 
site or shop support.  So much for service with a smile.

Although, my Linux instructor at PCC did say that this list is
especially whiney.  Nothing like an ax to grind, eh?  Have we
all seen Tux in legal getups?  He looks sharp, doesn't 
he?  So is he a male or a female penguin?  After all, the name 
Tux could be gender neutral.

Not that It's polite to post under someone else's blog, but it is
fun sometimes.

Wow, such a long string of non-sequiturs! Maybe ADD isn't the issue. Maybe

Message-ID: <20041023043630.GC29785@gate.kl-ic.com>


1) Politics does NOT belong on the plug list.  Plug-TALK.  Please.

2) Cluesticks should NOT be smashed vigorously into the empty space
   between a clueless troll's ears.

3) I won't if you won't.

4) People that RESPOND to the clueless troll are showing regrettable
   cluelessness themselves.  Let the churlish and inappropriate
   mispostings of the clueless troll stand as a perfect demonstration
   of the clueless troll's own inability to think.  Responding only
   encourages the clueless troll, and wastes everyone else's time.

5) Relax, take a warm bath, read some Terry Pratchett or something 
   else to bring on a smile.  Then write some code.  Leave the
   anger and the fear to the clueless trolls of the world.  Let
   the clueless troll blow a gasket in rage and frustration, and
   the world will be a more peaceful place.

Now, let's see if I can code that in perl:

if( $posting == $politics ) {
   ( open PLUG-TALK and redirect( $posting ) ) or {

      $head{ $clueless_troll } += 10 * $cluestick ; 
   }
}

unless $clueless_troll {
  relax() ;
  take( $bath{ $warm } ) ;
  read( PRATCHETT, $brain, 200000 );
  haha() ;
  smile() ;
  write CODE ;
  $anger = 0 ;
  $fear = 0 ;
} else {
  use Rage ;
  use Frustration ;
  blow( $gasket ) and die;
}
$world += $peace ;

Nope, it does not look like it is valid perl.

Hello!
I have been viewing the posts of the plug for quite some time 
and for some reason I have stopped getting the posts.

I have written and asked t have this problem looked at and I 
have had no response. I have checked the filters, I use Kmail, 
I have talked to my ISP and they have changed nothing. As far 
as I can tell the PLUG is the only thig I am not getting out of 
the 50 or so news groups I receive posting from.

Could this be looked into.

Thanks, 

Dale

Oh, are we counting kernels plus architectures?  Then Debian's closer
to 300,000 or so.

Could someone drop Darkhorse off the list as he's long since stopped
posting on topic, ignored many requests from various people to stop,
and is now hashing private discussions out onto the list?

Wil,

I've just noticed that the news gateway isn't working currently
either.  That is, I can connect, but new email traffic isn't getting
forwarded to the nntp server.  There is at least one "high value" user
of the nntp server, so ensuring its continued workie-ness is probably
desirable.

Yes, I'm aware of the problem; I haven't had time to get to it.  My time
has been in short supply lately, so I've only gotten the list done.
I'll do it ASAP.

Damn it might be my firewall (Asante) blocking it.  Doesn't appear to be 
the firewall on the system itself.  Oh yeah time to break out the old 
tcpdump and see what's going on.

Perhaps a negative assertion would better catch the breadth of 
nonsense that some feel entitle to post to this list:

   # perhaps needs seasoning

       linux gnu unix computing programming open-source

   Every MTA has UCE filters. Take personal responsibility and use 'em for
yourself. I did this months ago so other than smtp rejection totals (81
yesterday!) in the pflogsumm daily report, the only indication I have of
trolling is everyone else's response.

   Ostrasizing by rejection at the SMTP gateway is highly effective and can
be done individually. I've also found the 'd' key in pine quite reliable.

Actually, I think anyone who resorts to the type of insult Michael used
should be automatically bounced. Neither personal insult, nor intimidation
should have any place here.

Given PLUG's history, I'm not holding my breath.

Not really.. some try hard to avoid doing jobs that aren't theirs :)

But anyways, I agree. Dorkhorse isn't going to understand: "if you feel 
the need to put OT in subject, just don't say it."

Its stuff like this that makes people unsubscribe. I did for about a 
year, and when I returned, the list was much different (better!).

The list is just as bad, again.
I second the motion to remove anyone who repeatedly posts off-topic.

I really don't care to hear about anything but *nix, cool toys, etc. 
"etc" does not cover politics. I don't surround myself with political 
zealots in real life, and I don't want to hear people whining about 
politics on my mailing lists either.

Sorry, it's an open list, he'll just re-sub.  He's been chased away a
few times from PLUG and PDXLUG lists but he always comes back. 

Michael's on a fairly regular cycle; give him a few days and he'll
calm down and go back to asking obscure spam-filter questions and
Google-able Linux questions.

   What do you see when you type 'which make'? Here, it's /usr/bin/make.
Also, /usr/bin/make should have 755 permissions.

has the extra data lines terminated.  HP sells them from $25, but as I

Anybody have one they wish to part with, or know of the whereabouts of

You can find various SCSI connector adaptors on eBay in the $10-15

If I am not mistaken, the proprietor Gary Grosshoeme died recently.  I
haven't been by recently to see if anyone is keeping it open or not.
I would guess not, but may be wrong.  He was a real gem.  The last
words he spoke to me were: "I'll leave you to your devices".

   Oh, wow! I wasn't aware of Gary's death. He was a fascinating, no-nonsense
resource and I never minded paying what he asked because the value always
exceeded the price.

   While I'm sorry to read of his passing, I'm glad you told us, Russell.

I don't.

The most effective response to OT topics on a mailing list is to
completely ignore them. People with an axe to grid really hate that. Like
beggars, irritating OT posts eventually move elsewhere unless people feed

Unfortunately, I will have to agree with Bill on this one...

Generally we all are posting off topic about something at one time or
another. It really doesn't matter the subject... it could just as easy be
<name your social/political group's> rights to where I should go for a
swim.. ;)

Yes.. we're all guilty at one time or another... 

Of course we would all like to hear the latest on 
How to get LINUX going on the latest <name your favorite

I don't.

The most effective response to OT topics on a mailing list is to
completely ignore them. People with an axe to grid really hate that. Like
beggars, irritating OT posts eventually move elsewhere unless people feed
them. And if people feel the need to encourage a thread by responding,
maybe the message needs to be considered.

Greetings...

I managed to get my hands on an old HP NetServer LD Pro..

Yes it's an old beast with a Pentium Pro 180Mhz, ~168MB ram, SCSI out the
wazoo, Hot Swapable SCSI drives (2.1 gig, 4 gig, and the third isn't
working) and generally speaking it works...  ;)

(Knoppix 3.6 Boots up just fine on it...)

I've got several things I'm looking to do...

The first thing to do is get LINUX up and running on it... :)
Just to actually use it as a server...

Second: Replace these blasted fans with something quieter...

Third: Replace the Power Supply...

Fourth: Replace the Motherboard, Memory, etc...

Any ideas? Thoughts? Suggestions?

Subject: [PLUG] IDE drive - "hard error reading fsbn..." - recoverable? 
Message-ID: <20041023204209.N2480@grond.sourballs.org>

This problem may be irrelevant (and incomprehensible) to anyone not using 
FreeBSD.  However, with all the expertise in this group, I figured I float 
this cry for help...

I'm using a FreeBSD 4.9-RELEASE-p11 system.

Experimenting with cdda2wav this morning, I managed to get my system into a 
completely non-responsive state- no keyboard, mouse, or console activity; the 
machine responded to about 20% of ping packets, with many-second delays; 
attempts to ssh into the box failed.  So I power-cycled the machine.

After an apparently normal reboot, I noticed I could no longer access certain 
files:

  dcf>$ ls .mozilla/firefox/dcf/bookmarks.html
  ls: .mozilla/firefox/dcf/bookmarks.html: Input/output error

and these errors were accompanied by kernel warnings:

  Oct 23 16:58:12 grond /kernel: ad0s1e: hard error reading fsbn 29926527 of 
9843232-9843263 (ad0s1 bn 29926527; cn 1862 tn 214 sn 15) status=59 error=40

Other files in /home/dcf were affected, also - many seemed to be related to 
firefox, which had been running when the system froze/was rebooted.

I dropped to single user mode and started fsck - and got the following:

** /dev/ad0s1e
** Last Mounted on /home
** Phase 1 - Check Blocks and Sizes


CONTINUE? [yn]
THE FOLLOWING DISK SECTORS COULD NOT BE READ: 9843232, 9843233, 9843234, 
9843235, 9843236, 9843237, 9843238, 9843239, 9843240, 9843241, 9843242, 
9843243, 9843244, 9843245, 9843246, 9843247, 9843248, 9843249, 9843250, 
9843251, 9843252, 9843253, 9843254, 9843255, 9843256, 9843257, 9843258, 
9843259, 9843260, 9843261, 9843262, 9843263, 9843264, 9843265, 9843266,

9843291, 9843292, 9843293, 9843294, 9843295,


CONTINUE? [yn]

...many, many times, interspersed with as many kernel errors:

ad0s1e: hard error reading fsbn 9843238 (ad0s1 bn 9843238; cn 612 tn 181 sn 55) status=59 error=40
ad0s1e: hard error reading fsbn 9843239 (ad0s1 bn 9843239; cn 612 tn 181 sn 56) status=59 error=40
ad0s1e: hard error reading fsbn 9843240 (ad0s1 bn 9843240; cn 612 tn 181 sn 57) status=59 error=40
ad0s1e: hard error reading fsbn 9843241 (ad0s1 bn 9843241; cn 612 tn 181 sn 58) status=59 error=40
ad0s1e: hard error reading fsbn 9843242 (ad0s1 bn 9843242; cn 612 tn 181 sn 59) status=59 error=40
ad0s1e: hard error reading fsbn 9843243 (ad0s1 bn 9843243; cn 612 tn 181 sn 60) status=59 error=40
...etc.

So I figure somehow I suffered hard drive damage in the system freeze or my 
reboot.  My questions, now, are:

Is this likely a one-time thing, or a symptom of creeping disk death?
   (The 'hard error' messages only started after the reboot.)

If it's one-time, is the disk still usable?  Can I flag the affected sectors as 
bad, and work around them?

How can I best determine the extent of the damage? I'd rather not do a manual 
fsck for a whole afternoon if I can help it.

How best can I recover from the damage?  Many of the affected files appear to 
be in my home directory.  Can I just blow away the entire /home/dcf and restore 
from backup (I think I have those...)?  The system appears to be largely 
functional - I'm using it to write this e-mail, for instance, and mozilla 
works ok (though with many error messages being written to syslog).

Thanks in advance for any advice you might have -

I'd go with 5-RELEASE. (that's 5.3 ..and will be out um.. today! I need

It can do background fsck, among other life-saving things (SMP! and O(1) 
scheduling are my favorite reasons).

Hard to tell.. unless it happens again. If so, I'd replace the drive.

I would.
You might download the manufacturer's floppy image for testing drives. I 
think they still do that. Maybe Seagate just has a windows program now.

Indeed.. that'd be a pain, but since you're on 4.9, I don't know of 
anything else to do.
If fsck can't recover the files that are damaged, then they're gone ;)

UFS2 is far better..
(am I right in thinking 4.9 uses 'normal' UFS?)

I've been on FreeBSD 5 since 5.0 came out.. the first upgrade from 4 was 
annoying, since I "don't need to read UPDATING"... but its been rock 
solid otherwise.

Should go pretty well.

Good luck.  Often they use weird sizes, and a lot of the noise has
more to do with case design; put something directly in front of a fan
and you'll get a fair bit more noise.  I think Marketing tells the
engineers to make the things as loud as possible so the customer
thinks they're getting more for their kilobucks.

> Third: Replace the Power Supply...

Custom case and hardware, so it's hard to fit standard ATX components.
Will likely take some drilling and hacksawing.

> Any ideas? Thoughts? Suggestions?

Sounds like you want to keep the sheet metal and throw away everything
else.  It's fun to get a beastie like that up and running your
favorite OS as-is, but I'd save the case re-engineering for something
more interesting, like an old microwave or something.

FreeGeek recycles lots of old weird computer hardware, and I've been
wanting to find a way to get some of the nicer examples into the hands
of folks who'll do strange and wonderous things to them.

Most likely the system froze *because* of the HDD errors.

Modern HDDs hide bad sectors from the system by mapping around them.
If you see bad sectors on a drive, it's already on its way to an early
grave.  Copy off what you can, then throw it away or turn it into art.

OK, some imperative advice: 
Don't power up the bad drive unless you absolutely have to.  There may
be crud floating around inside, destroying more data the longer it's
spinning.  Don't write to it, either, since you're risking serious
filesystem corruption.  Get another drive, install an OS and then
install the bad one and copy what you can over to the new drive.

Hey if you could dredge up some drives that would work with this thing it
would be great. It's interesting to know that who ever had this machine in
the past didn't use the SCSI for RAID, they just used them as independent
drives!!?!!

For those wondering it still has EISA capability... and PCI...

Personally, I just need a quiet server... that has RAID enabled...

So I can set-up a web-server and Mail-Server...

I'm afraid I have to agree with Bill, et al. Please, don't boot people
from this list because of their insane propensities for repeatedly
trying to bring non-linux discussions onto the list.

I think we all post "mostly" on topic- where "mostly" is a judgement
based on our own perceptions. Maybe he considers his topics "germane"
to the worldwide takeover by Linux. Who knows. But I agree- if he
riles you, just plonk him. Bullies of all types hate to be ignored,

Rich: Usually it means the HTTP server will parse through the page and
look for CGI scripts (i.e. a page counter). Since you can change the
file extension freely on the server side it could also be something
different.

Sometimes an answer is closer than you think:

  [root at tire mailman]# grep shtml /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
  DirectoryIndex index.html index.cgi index.shtml index.html.var
  AddIcon /icons/layout.gif .html .shtml .htm .pdf
  # To parse .shtml files for server-side includes (SSI):
  AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml
  [root at tire mailman]#

The convention is that file with the extention .shtml should be parsed
by the web server for server-side includes.

Which model is it exactly?
What is the BIOS running on it?
I have an LS4 that's been tweaked, although it has a dead drive right
now and I'm awaiting sufficient funds to replace all of them with some
9gb drives.
I've found that SUSE 7.2 will install as will Redhat 7.2, however
nothing newer seem to want to install.
Not having enough free funds to experiment, it's taken a back burner
position in projects.
I did have it set up doing dns and nfs for my network. Seriously
lacking in Video and that was my "future" experiment that never seemed
to get time or funds.

As for parts:
Ebay
and there is/was a place mentioned here on plug that had access to the
sca drives at a reasonable price.

Good luck, and I'd be interested in hearing what happens as you
experiment.

Yes, I understand.  However the word "that" implies something other
than the subject.  When one says "That is green", for example, 
they're not normally referring to themselves.  "That" indicates
"other" where "this" indicates "self".  The predicate nominative is
based on the subject being identical with the predicate.  The subject
and object both refer to the same thing.  But, when you use "that",
the subject and object don't refer to the same thing.  When you
say "That is me", you've stepped outside yourself... you're referring
to yourself in the third person, not the first.  So, the first person
form of the pronoun would NOT be appropriate.

So, I think the correct forms are "That is me" and "This is I".  Note,
of course, that I don't really care what's correct or
not... especially as dictated by an elitist community who somehow
suppose themselves the regulators of a living language. [grin] (That's
why I'm ok with putting punctuation on the outside of "s, splitting my
infinitives, using words like "productize", and ending a sentence in a
preposition.)

   I'm puzzled how to exchange dsa keys between machines and keep them
synchronized. Right now, my problem is getting a portable talking to the
server. Specifically, I need to copy a revised /etc/cups/printers.conf from
the server to the portable.

   The problem, I'm almost certain, is that there is no key from that
portable in ~/.ssh/known_hosts.

   I think the most parsimonious solution is to regenerate keys for the two
of us on both workstations and portables. I believe that I need to run
keygen on each box, then copy the keys onto a floppy and copy all onto each
host.

   Is there a better way?

TIA,

Rich

Dunno about an automated way to keep the keys syncrhonized, but the keys
only get stale after a password or some other change, yes (ie infrequently
enough to not be a hassle)?

This is what I do sans floppy:

On "source" box:

[root at sparky .ssh]# ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
eb:3a:ff:13:a1:fa:61:f1:da:69:6d:ff:65:e2:83 root at sparky.woo-hoo.com
[root at sparky .ssh]#

Note don't put anything in for pass phrase.

Put it onto the "target" box:
[root at sparky .ssh]# scp id_rsa.pub root at spud:/root/.ssh/
root at spud's password:
id_rsa.pub           100% |*****************************|   233       00:00
[root at sparky .ssh]#

Rename the file on "target" box:
[root at spud .ssh]# mv id_rsa.pub authorized_keys

I suppose you'll want to cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys if you're
adding more than one host.

Steve,

   Well, setting up new systems and changing distributions required new
pass phrases. So now I don't know what's current where and figured that it
would be easier to reset 'em all since there are only 4 boxes involved. That
would get me straightened out.

   Two questions: 1) Why do this as root rather than as a user? I block root
logins via ssh. 2) Why no pass phrase? I skip that and use my password when
I'm here but I always use the pass phrase when I'm away.

   The only difficulty with this technique is that it requires being able to
scp from one box to another. It is my inability to do this that prompted my
question. It's an infinite loop: I cannot get the pass phrases coordinated
between two machines until I'm able to connect via ssh or scp; I cannot
connect via ssh/scp until I coordinate the two machines with the same pass
phrase in known_hosts. Check mate.

   Well, I'll get it worked out when I return from a business trip tomorrow
evening.

Thanks,

Rich

Ah, I see.  Am only guessing but suppose that replacing your known_hosts
file would accomplish that objective.

No particular reason, this snippet was just something I saved for myself
long ago when trying to create a scripted rsync backup that facilitated
the script running w/o scp prompting user for root password.

2) Why no pass phrase? I skip that and use my password
> when

Um, I really don't understand what the purpose of the pass phrase is in
that context- sorry.  It seems to be completely independent of your
regular username/password credentials.  My goal with that script was just
to be able to scp in a script in the middle of the night w/o having a
password be manually entered.

Am confused.  My example required that you need to supply your regular ssh
login only the first time, when doing the scp of id_rsa.pub file.  Meaning
when you ssh (or scp) w/o the host key, it interactively prompts you for
your password.  In my experience, I must supply my password every time I
ssh to a host, _unless_ I first use the technique I showed previous email
to store a key on the remote machine.  Once that is done, I can
subsequently just "ssh hostname" either interactively or scripted and am
not prompted for a password.  Perhaps I misunderstood your goals in the
first place.  Are you unable to ssh to the hosts at all, now?

That's normally used for files that have Server-side Includes.

Apache's (default?) configuration only allows .shtml files to use SSI's.

What leads you to that conclusion?  Are you perhaps confusing
known_hosts with authorized_keys?  Does password authentication not
work?  Does it complain about the remote machine having the wrong key?

If it's the last, just delete or comment out the line in known_hosts
for the remote host.

Sounds like a scorched-earth approach that may or may not help.

HP NetServer LD Pro 6/180
Phoenix Bios 4.05.16
BIOS Date: 06/10/98

Which model is it exactly?
What is the BIOS running on it?
I have an LS4 that's been tweaked, although it has a dead drive right
now and I'm awaiting sufficient funds to replace all of them with some
9gb drives.
I've found that SUSE 7.2 will install as will Redhat 7.2, however
nothing newer seem to want to install.
Not having enough free funds to experiment, it's taken a back burner
position in projects.
I did have it set up doing dns and nfs for my network. Seriously
lacking in Video and that was my "future" experiment that never seemed
to get time or funds.

As for parts:
Ebay
and there is/was a place mentioned here on plug that had access to the
sca drives at a reasonable price.

Good luck, and I'd be interested in hearing what happens as you
experiment.

You might also try NWCS, Northwest Computer Support (I think) They're

 They have lots of SCSI stuff, or they used to...

I could have the letters screwed up, like it could be NWCA...

mark,

   In linux (and other unices) file and directory access is controlled. There
are three categories: the User (who created the file or directory), the
Group (to which that user belongs) and all Others (or, the world). Within
each group there are permissions for Reading, Writing and eXecuting files.
This yields a group of 9 characters that you see when you do a long listing,
'ls -l' on a file or directory. I'm also ignoring the initial bit here;.

   So, if you see a file's permissions as rwxrwxrwx it can be read, written
and executed by the owners, other members of his main group, and anyone
else.

   Each position represents a bit in the binary system; reading from left to
right: 4, 2, 1. The total value of those bits set the permissions. (Which
can also be set by letters; read 'man chmod' for details.) Therefore,
permissions of 755 allows the owner to read, write and execute the file,
everyone else can read and execute it. That's what you want for
/usr/bin/make because it's owned by root but is executed by users.

   Mick Bauer has an execllent introduction to permissions in the two most
recent issues of Linux Journal.

HTH,

Rich

: Yes, I understand.  However the word "that" implies something other
: than the subject.

'That' and 'which' also imply that the object is inanimate or sub-human.
Examples: 'a desk that I bought,' and ''the horse that I rode,' but not 'the 
waiter that served me' (unless it's a robot, or if you are a stuffed-up bigot 
implying that the waiter is, for some other reason, far below your standing 
and possibly an evolutionary degenerate - or worse, a nasty racial slur.)

: When one says "That is green", for example,
: they're not normally referring to themselves. 

OUCH! One NEVER uses a plural 'they' to indicate a SINGULAR. (that's from my 
Strunk & White.) If you want to escape the fact that in Standard English the 
masculine gender subsumes the feminine, but you cower in fear that this FACT 
may make some people upset, then use plural throughout, or use the second 
person, and finally, for those rare sentences where you've painted yourself 
into a corner, muster your courage and say 'his,' and 'himself,' and stand 
your ground. You have centuries of English grammar to back you up on this.

: say "That is me", you've stepped outside yourself... you're referring
: to yourself in the third person, not the first.

The simple "X is Y[period]" sentence is one of the rare instances where both X 
and Y are conjugated as subjects, so "That is I" is correct but "That is me" 
by itself is incorrect. It becomes usable if another clause follows, such as 
"That is me, in the lower left corner of the photo."

Message-ID: <06cd01c4bace$3e8e77d0$4901a8c0@mango>

I am involved in a gaming tourney that we have some problems with
"hackers" that have been banned, continue to get their way in -
Specifics: Half-Life Day-of-Defeat servers using the Steam_ID
server/client. When we get guys using wall hacks and such, we try to ban
them from our gaming servers. At the moment we ban by Steam_ID which is
resolved when they get into the server. The problem with this solution,
all they need to do is buy a cheap copy of DoD or Counter-Strike, reload
and get a new Steam_ID account.
We can't really ban by IP address as too many people (btw, this is an
international tourney), can obtain the same ISP number when using Cable.

So, my thoughts... Is there a way we can obtain the MAC address when
they log on to our server? I know if we can, I'm sure we can write a
script to ban that address if it's on our list.

Is this possible?

Thanks,
Steve

This isn't really my area of expertise (he says, pretending he 
actually does have such an area :-), but I think all your server will 
see is the MAC of the router sitting between you and the larger 
Internet.

AFAIK, the only way to get access to a remote host's HWaddress is to 
bypass any routers, i.e., be on the same subnet.

Assuming Linux on the remote hosts if the game can get the client to
return `ifconfig -a` that would give you the information.  For a Windows
 machine you'd want the output from "ipconfig /all".

But even if you do that it's possible for the owner of the remote box
to manually change the HWaddress.  It's not too difficult, and easy to
teach to another, so your lockout method would be short lived.

I'm trying to help a friend debug some ongoing SMTP problems
with his system.  We're not sure if the problem is with his connection
to the internet (which is known to be flaky) or if it's the server
itself.

When you get a bounce message and it says:

<user at remote_spot.org>... Deferred: Connection refused by server.remote_spot.org.

What does that mean?

It means server.remote_spot.org isn't listening for SMTP connections
and your server is going to hang on to the message for up to 4 days,
retrying occasionally until the message goes through or becomes 4 days
old (and times out, in which the sender will get a bounce).

Okay, but does it mean that we've actually handshaked with the daemon
on server.remote_spot.org or that we're just talking out into the ether?

Neither.  It means your server got "connection refused" when it tried
connecting to server.remote_spot.org, which is exactly what the error
tells you.

Sorry but the book is at home and there is a dragon breathing down my
neck.  Is there a standard for creating MessageIDs?  Most I've seen are
formatted something like this:

	CCYYMMDDHHmmRandomLooking-SomethingOrOther

Is there a standard method for creating the RandomLooking and what is the 
SomethingOrOther?

Let me take that back.  I just looked at another one and it was totally
random appearing.


TIA,

Along with what Paul said I suggest you try doing a dig for the mx 
records.

	dig remote_spot.org mx

They could have a hung mail exchanger or a bogus DNS record.

This sounds a bit like the remote end is doing greylisting.

  <http://greylisting.org/>

Or maybe not.  Hard to tell from the info provided.

A lot of things have to work correctly to get this message.  DNS
properly looked up server.remote_spot.org.  The first packet in your
attempt to set up a TCP connection to port 25 (SMTP) made it to the
remote server through any firewalls or flaky connections along the
way.  The remote server is up and sent you a packet back letting you
know that there was nothing for you to connect with on that port.

Usually "connection refused" means that there is no software (mail
server) up on the remote side, however it could also be due to a
firewall someplace.  Some ISPs may block outgoing E-mail with
"connection refused" in order to keep the spam-bot virus-infested
masses in check.  However, this should show up for all mail
destinations, not just one remote server.

If it's just the one remote server, it's probably their fault...

Thnaks Wil.  This gave me a fine chuckle last week but just getting around
to replying.

Vi is daily becoming my tool.  I prefer emacs but it tends to be kind of
bloated and always tries to open a graphical window (and quite often
hangs) on my system if I forget to include the -nw switch.  So for my
lean-and-mean servers vi gets to be the tool.

A couple things wrong with this:

1) If he's getting connection refused, DNS is working.  2) MX isn't
required, A may also be the record indicating which server is
receiving mail for that site.

An overloaded server would also return the same thing.  By overloaded, I
mean that the smtp server has reached its maximum number of concurrent
connections.  Most servers have a configurable limit on the number of
connections.  This is to help keep the kernel up and running under high
load.

No, not as flame bait.

I asked yesterday about email message-ids; how to create them etc.  Well
this AM (after forgetting to dig my "Programming Internet Mail" book out
last night) I did a search on CPAN and guess what?  Yup, a module,
Email::MessageID.  Installed it (with one dependency) and my messages were
no longer being caught a SPAM by 'our' SPAM software.

So if a reply from my previous message was bubbling to the top ther eis no 
need.

   Some of you may remember that I posted a query some weeks ago about
strange behavior of 'less' and 'joe'. Specifically, having parts of an
immediately previous file still show up in the 'less' display and having
joe's spell checking overwrite the displayed file rather than be in a
separate window at the bottom. Well, I figured out the problem source:
aterm.

   I like aterms because they're light-weight and can be made transparent
(while darkening the background shade for better contrast with the text),
and a few other features. However, the inability to properly handle the
pager 'less' and 'joe' edit sessions is not acceptable.

   When I revert to using rxvt the problems go away. While rxvt windows
cannot be made transparent, I learned from the man page that I can place the
scroll bar on the right rather than on the left. I like that because I don't
need to reach across the window with the pointy device.

   Thought that I'd pass this on in case you had a burning desire to try
aterms on your boxes.

You might check out Eterm. I like it, and it has the transparent ability 
too.

Russ,

   Thanks. I am aware of eterm's abilities. Now I only need something to work
and not build and install a fourth virtual terminal application. Rxvt is
already here, and any of the alternatives are more sprightly than the
venerable ol' xterm.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0410261338420.26110-100000@gisnet.com>

I've just learned of a security upgrade for Slackware that made me wonder 
about how up-to-date my RH9 system is. Here's what I received:

> New apache and mod_ssl packages are available for Slackware 8.1, 9.0,

So I immediately ran apt-get update and then apt-get upgrade, and found 
that as far as apt-get was concerned I'm as current as I can be. Hmm...

Then I checked my RPM database:

# rpm -q httpd mod_ssl php
httpd-2.0.40-21.11
mod_ssl-2.0.40-21.11
php-4.2.2-17.2

So it looks like I'm way ahead with Apache using version 2, but not so
with the other two. Or is this one of those RedHat "back-port" things
where they upgrade the RPMs, but not the version number? 

Or is this a case of RH9 being EOL'ed and therefore I have the newest 
upgrades available, but they're not new enough?

How do I tell what the *real* version numbers are, or if apt-get needs a
newer source (I'm currently using ayo.freshrpms.net for updates), or is 
RH9 RPM maintainence no longer done by anyone?

More to the point, these buffer overflow problems are never going to
disappear --there's always another one yet to be discovered-- so how does
one keep old versions of Linux secure? I'm sorry to be asking such vague
and broad questions, but I don't think I know enough to even know what
ask. Any general or specific advice would be welcome!

TIA,
- Bill Thoen

I'm unsure how many patches have made their way to Fedora Legacy, but 
at least some of them have:

Fedora Legacy is a good option to patch some of the more commonly
exploited holes:

http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/2004-October/036107.html

White Box Linux or Centos are also good options since they will have a
much longer "lifetime", putting off the dreaded end-of-life for
several years:

There is a Fedora Legacy project to deal with just these issues.

http://fedoralegacy.org/

Keeping up with the security updates is a full time job.  Especially since 
so few of them describe the real problem.  (Not to mention backporting 
patches so as to not break dependancies.)

Ken,
if your still needing a 50 or 68 pin adapter I have a couple.
Unless this is some special kind of adapter.

Subject: [PLUG] Sniffing networking traffic
Message-ID: <BAY9-F44HxvZ9aZ1i6b0000e308@hotmail.com>


Hi:

I have one linux box and a VOIP adaptor.  They are connected to
the same hub, then to a cable modem router and then
to my cable modem.

I want the linux box to be able to capture network traffic
that is directed to the VOIP adator.  I have turned on eth0
to promiscuous mode.  I tried running both
tcpdump and ethereal.  Neither detected anything
beyond what is meant for the Linux box.

It is my understanding that by putting the linux on a hub, and turning
its eth0 to promiscuous, I should be able to detect
all traffic going through on the same hub.
Am I missing a step?

Thanks for any pointer.

Are you sure it is a hub and not a switch?  It's getting hard to find hubs
these days.

Subject: [PLUG] A Pine Role Question
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0410270710310.10280@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have set up an alternate role in pine so that I can send messages from
that alternate domain as well as from this, default, domain.

   This works just fine when I compose a new message. I'm asked if I want to
use the default role or the alternate role as the sender. However, when I
reply to a message sent by a mail list to which I've subscribed with that
alternate role, I have no option. Any response is sent from the default
account and is then held for moderation because that username is not the one
I used to subscribe.

   This keeps biting me on the gnucash list. When I want to reply to a posted
message it's not in the alternate role and I'm not given the opportunity to
select the desired role for the response. I therefore assume that I have
something not correct in the setup of roles. I don't see what's missing. If
someone can offer the setup of a properly functioning role within pine (4.60
here), I can check what I've done against that standard and probably find
what I missed.

TIA,

Rich

All,

I have managed to break a Fedora Core test 3 boot partition. On boot the 
error messages are /var and /tmp dirs are read only. The result is the 
boot hangs on start log. This is before interactive and therefore cannot 
be avoided.

What would cause the OS to think /var and /tmp were ro??

How can this be repaired?

The system is dual boot; the other OS is Fedora Core 1 and boots cleanly.

Thanks,
Dan

Double check that the hub is not a switch.  A lot of new gear these days are
actually ethernet switches.  And if that is the case you won't see any
traffic.

Ettercap will sniff on switched networks too (using ARP poisoning).

I don't know, is the VOIP adapter turned on and really doing
something?  Plug something else into the hub and see if you can sniff
it's network traffic.

Thanks for all that has replied.  I will double check when I go home

But I am very sure (without double checking) that I am using this:

   http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=34&scid=31&prid=148

It is a 5-port workgroup hub.

I will try to stick in something else to see if I can sniff the traffic too.

How do you set the default boot partition for GRUB?  I looked in the

Message-ID: <2828.134.244.174.76.1098913493.squirrel@134.244.174.76>

hello all,

I hope you are getting away from your computers and enjoying this one
day of sun.

Me, I'm trying to resolve a little multiple network card and default
gateway problem.  I've been told that TCP/IP doesn't work the way I
want but thought to ask anyway.

I have two nic cards. One connected to an external/internet connection
and the other to an internal network.  Now I have a VPN connection
that I make on the external connection and it changes my default
gateway so I can no longer get to my internal network.

Is there a way around this?  I need a solution for windows but I may
be resolving that with a Virtual PC but I'm also looking for a
solution on Linux.   I want to be able to set up a default Gateway for
each nic card. I think that would resolve the issue.

Thanks,

Josh

Hi; it's me again :).
For reasons known only to the gods, I have permission from my lovely
wifey to install Linux on my laptop.  I like using it when I'm "out
and about" to connect, etc.  I was thinking it would be
extra-convenient if I could set up a vpn and then "see" the printer
and other network shares from whereever I happen to be "out and about"
to.
I have a debian ('testing') box in the basement; I have port 22
forwarded from the
comcast cable box's little router to it (so I can ssh into the Debian
box). The other computers on the network are windows beasts (windows
XP).

So; do I enable the little router thing's VPN support, and if so- do I
need to do anything else? Is there a good walk through available on
the web somewhere for this?

Thanks a lot-

If you don't explicity state otherwise, then the first entry in your
menu.lst file is the default. You can use the command 'default' in your
menu.lst to specify another entry. Note that 'default' counts from zero
(e.g., the second entry in your list would be set as default via
"default 1").

You can also use "default saved" to have GRUB automatically default to
the last entry booted.

Use "info grub" to read the full documentation (if it's installed on
your machine). Unfortunately, the docs can sometimes be less than
enlightening.

If "info" or "man" is too stiff, here's a friendly tutorial on GRUB by 
Daniel Robbins, that takes about an hour:

Yea.. that's a pain.
If you're on windows, uncheck "use default gateway on server" in the VPN 
connection (advanced) settings. It will then assume classful networks.. 
and route vpn traffic accordingly (sigh).
You can much with windows' routing table the same as:

If you're using *nix, just:
a) change your default gateway to what you normally use.
b) add a route for what you need to go through the vpn, to go through 
the tunnel.
optional, to avoid a,b) configure your client to *not* change your 
default route. It should only send traffic through the tunnel that's 
destined for the remote subnet.

Alternatively, just add a route for your local subnet. It will match, 
instead of the default route.
route add -net 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0
(assuming you use 10.0.0.0/24 and its on eth0)

C++ does not have built-in graphic functionality. You
can't do things like plot(x,y) that are a feature of
BASIC, for example.

Would those who are doing C++ graphics care to say
what their favorite toolkit(s) are? Qt has come to my
attention, and I am willing to accept the EULA. ("Good
commercial software is better than bad free
software.") I've heard of others, though, and I'd like
to assess their relative strengths and weaknesses.

Tim,

   If you separate the UI from the rest of the code you can use python,
java, tcl/tk and many other options. Heck, you could use gtk+, too. The nice
thing about a modular organization is the ease of maintanance or change of
one part without affecting the other parts.

Yup, it is a language, not a full toolkit.

Well time for the fight. You've got three options. First will be GTK. I
suspect you'll be avoiding GTK as it is good old pure C bindings (nice
ones, but still C).

So you're more likely to opt for GTK--, which is the C++ bindings for
GTK. I've never actually touched these, but I have touched GTK. I like
GTK, it is quite nicely constructed. If you ever wish to port to a less
desirable platform, GTK is written in such a way that porting would be
easy (speaking of which, does anyone have a GTK build for Wintel?).

Then you've got the option you've already pointed to, Qt. Can't give
references for it. It exists, quite a few folks use it, can't say much
else.

I've used OO.o, but the margins were less than exact, at least on my 
printing gear. What works best for me is glabels:

* http://glabels.sourceforge.net/

It's got quite a dependency list of GNOME stuff, but for me it works 
as advertised.

What kind of graphics? 

All purpose desktop windowing UI: 
GTK with Glade (http://glade.gnome.org)

For small footprint GUI (semi-embedded, game, single app box): 
FLTK (http://www.fltk.org). There is also a GUI designer, haven't used
it though. Real C++. 

No windows, direct to framebuffer: 
svgalib (http://www.arava.co.il/matan/svgalib)

Rich, I use Photoshop, hence Gimp should work, too. Just draw two
circles, print this out and adjust until they match your label. Didn't
take that long, really and you get all the power from a real graphics
program.

Also take a look at wxWidgets, it's native C++, licensed under
"extended LGPL" (the end result looks like a BSD-ish license, you can
use the toolkit in GPL programs and in proprietary ones),
cross-platform (Linux, Windoze, even Mac I think).

I think the "self-install" is going to prevent any descent OS's from

Unless one is William Shakespeare or Jane Austen or Lewis Carroll or the
Oxford English Dictionary or somebody equally ignorant.

<URL: http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/austheir.html >

Use of the "singular they" goes back to the 14th century.

I refer you here

<URL: http://www.uoregon.edu/~spike/ling290/badEnglish.html >

to see that much of prescriptive grammar is based on nothing more than a
few people trying to feel superior and tell others what to do.  And here

<URL: http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/s-pinker.html >

to see what noted linguist/cognitive scientist Steven Pinker has to say on
the subject.

Anyway, you and your prescriptive grammar can go try to make someone else
feel less educated or intelligent.  We're not buying it.

Steve,

   I'll see if I can modify it to fit the Avery labels I have. He designed it
for Memorex labels.

   For those who are interested, OO.o has a cd-w label template, but it's for
the box and not the disk itself.

Thanks,

Rich

For the record:  I WAS KIDDING when I made the "that's I" comment which
spawned this thread.  Given the flames that were tearing through the
corridors or PLUG, I was offering a light-hearted deflection.  How the
heck is kidding around about grammar pissing people off?  (That's a
rhetorical question:  if you must answer it, please do so offlist.)

Since I'm the one who inadvertently started this round of carping, may
I humbly suggest it end?

My Knoppix disk labels are hand-coded postscript with some graphics
lifted out of other postscript.  Zero dependencies, but pretty extreme.

In the best of all worlds, I would use a Postscript massage package
that could lift elements out of the postscript generated by Gimp or
another tool, replace text elements and graphics includes with 
editable variable fields at the top of the document, then place two
or three images on the printed page according to adjustable coordinates.
There are some things where editable text is far superior to a gui or
a form-based program, and Postscript variables are dead-easy to edit.

In general, most gui design programs are rather sucky in that they do 
not permit "late binding" of information in their output.  A program
that produces an editable "your name here" postscript output would
be good.  One that emitted postscript that could elegantly place blocks
of text (drop the font size if it does not fit) would be even better. 
Postscript is a programming language, and damned few tools make use
of that.  Repeated labels should be subroutines!

But to solve Rich's immediate problem, I would suggest building a
single label with gimp and print that.

Later, as time permits, experiment with wrapping the post-header,
pre-showpage portion of the postscript with a "/CDimage { gsave"
in front and a "grestore } def" before the showpage.  Then you 
can do something like:

/CenterOne { 203 580 } def
/CenterTwo { 410 207 } def
gsave CenterOne translate  CDimage  grestore
gsave CenterTwo translate  CDimage  grestore
showpage

...at the end of the program.   Tweak the centers of the labels (in
72dpi picas) to match the scale and offset of your particular printer.  

The biggest problem with labels is that different manufacturers have
different centers, and different printers have different offsets (and
slightly different scales).   Tweaking these in GIMP every time I changed
printers would drive me nuts.

But then, I already am crazy, so it might be best to ignore my advice. :-)

Keith,

   And you prefer to develop hardware using a machine language HDL, too, no
doubt. :-)

   I appreciate the thoughts and the detail. I have Avery #5692 labels so the
most parsimonious solution seems to be to build my own OO.o template.

> But then, I already am crazy, so it might be best to ignore my advice. :-)

   Have you seen the python-based HDL in the latest Linux Journal?

Enjoy the right coast,

Rich

HDL?  Hah!  Keith designs transistors out of raw silicon and hand aligns

Next you'll be telling me that you use some fancy-shmancy editing program

Therefore, no <br> allowed.

If I use <pre>...</pre> I preserve the lines but the font changes to courier

   Anyone?

Is <br/> allowed as a valid XHTML unary tag?

Colin,

   Sigh. Yes it is. As long as it's closed with the final slash it's still
valid in xhtml-1.0.

   I must have had an NPU failure there.

Many thanks,

Aaron Baer just alerted me to the fact that some messages were not going

were being discarded by Mailman.  There seems to be some bug in the new
MIME-filtering code ("new" being somewhat of a misnomer; 2.1.5 was
released 6 months ago) or I am misunderstanding the configuration.
Aaron's and my messages were both PGP/MIME-signed messages, sent through

Generally links to the Internet are between 2Mb and 1Mb often
symmetrical. Of course local LAN speeds are faster than that for those
of you looking for a good place for a meeting or some impromptu gaming
sessions.. 

More nodes added all the time..

It is also valid HTML 4.01 Transitional, so you're safe to start
changing all your HTML, if you so desire.  Although, it's recommended to
add a space before the slash, as "<br />", for enhanced compatibility
with older browsers.

Jason,

   Since I re-wrote all the pages using css rather than tables I made them
compliant with strict xhtml-1.0. They validate that way. And I did learn
about putting the space before the slash on all open tags (e.g., <br /> and
<img ... />.

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] Backscatter and Qmail
Message-ID: <1099009311.2788.172.camel@spectacled.orangeowl.lan>

Hi,

I'm experiencing a high volume of backscatter (about 2 bounce
messages/minute) on a production smtp server at work.  It's running
qmail 1.03 with qmail-scanner/clamav.  I've been researching various
patches to drop requests for invalid addresses at the smtp connection
level.  Anyone have experience and recommendations on this - on patching
qmail for backscatter or backscatter in general?  I've looked at both
validrcptto and realrcptto.

Is it at all advisable to simply wait out the storm or I should I be
prompt and deal with it now?

I've looked through logs to be sure that the server isn't being used for
unseemly purposes (I know what you're thinking) and have found no
evidence of ill-doing.  Also, I don't notice any evidence in the headers
of the bounces that it originated from our mail server (for example -
pretend our domain is monkeybusiness.com):

Return-Path: <Rodrigo at monkeybusiness.com>

For jpgs, it asks you about compression and quality and the like AFTER
you hit the save button.  I suspect that that's where it does it for 
all compressable image formats.

Ali,

   Aha! I knew I had seen it somewhere. But, I use the GIMP so infrequently
that I don't remember from time to time.

Many thanks!

Subject: [PLUG] Serial Port Programming 
Message-ID: <200410282014.36356.rsteff.l@comcast.net>

I'm playing with a device called an X-10 Powerhouse model CP290. It's a 
computer interface for the X-10 home control system* that connects to a 
computer via a serial port. I used to have it connected to my old DOS laptop 
running software that came with it many years ago (1980's, I think). For some 
reason, this software will not work with Pentium class processors, and 
although I've never found an explanation, in my experience, it is true. This 
little device has worked well for years, only needing to be reloaded after a 
power failure.

A few weeks ago, the hard drive on the laptop died. I decided that it was time 
to find a Linux solution to communicating with the thing and went looking on 
the web. I found a program**, downloaded and compiled it, and tried to get it 
to work. I've gotten it to the point where I've confirmed that I'm trying to 
talk to the right serial port, ttyS0, made the correct owner:group 
assignments, and made the error message change from not being able to open 
the serial port to Input/output error.

The first time I compiled it, I didn't notice a warning:

tty.c: In function `setup_tty':
tty.c:96: warning: passing arg 2 of `connect' from incompatible pointer type

Lines 95-98 read:

? /* connect to serial port daemon */
? r = connect (tty, &inaddr, size of (inaddr));
? if (r==0)
?return;

As this message is already getting long, I'll start by asking: is chasing this 
warning ?likely to be productive in getting communication working between the 
computer and the CP290? If not, do you have any suggestions as to where to 
look. (I realize that I haven't provided much of the code from the file 
tty.c, and will do so for anyone who'd like to look deeper.) 

A couple of other details: The CP290 has a simple RS-232 hardware interface, 
three wires: Transmit, Receive, Ground. There is no hardware handshake.

With a little light box just attached to the CP290 the green LED for RD lights 
up. With it just attached to my laptop, TD, RTS, and DTR are lit***. 

Alternatively, can anyone recommend an example of a working program that can 
communicate with a serial port and let me set the baud rate, parity, stop 
bits, etc, without that program needing to hear back from the device on the 
other end of the port right away? (I've tried cu, but it appears to want more 
in the way of handshaking from a terminal, or modem, or something.)

Thanks for any advice.

* X-10 automation sends control signals over the 110 volt power lines to 
modules that plug into a standard outlet, and then control devices, such as 
lamps that are plugged into them. It takes advantage of the very short period 
of time when the AC voltage on the power line is 0 to send out a DC pulse 
with an address and an instruction. If you're not familiar with it, and want 
more details, I can get more long winded about it. :-)

The CP290 is an odd beast. It communicates at 600 baud but it requires
a one millisecond delay between each transmitted byte. It's that delay, if 
poorly implemented, that breaks when you move CP290 control software
up to a faster PC. I think your best bet is to find that delay mechanism
in the code and either tune it for your PC or fix it properly for all PCs.
I don't think the compiler warning is the source of your problem.

I'm in the middle of a from-scratch implementation of X10 control software
using Python and pyserial. The CP290 portion is working more or less
though there's still a lot of clean-up to do before I'm ready to thrust it on
to the world. The one millisecond delay is implemented using Python's
time.sleep() function. This works fine on my development box. It will be
interesting to see what happens when it's exposed to other computers.

I'm also planning for the CM11A and CM17A controllers. I have nothing at
all for those yet.

Dick,

   Have you tried minicom? It's a great terminal program and will let you
play with the serial port settings as much as you'd like.

   Yeah, yeah: uphill both ways. Right. When I was a kid we were so poor we
couldn't afford to buy water. We had to smash together two hydrogen atoms
and an oxygen atom for each molecule. Keop Mom busy all day and it was our
chore after school.

Ever think of just striking a match? Then nature would have combined the

There may be a few more gotchas waiting around the bend.  I'm moving
into XHTML now, myself, and yesterday I learned that URIs--even those in
link tags--must be XML-escaped.  Thus, you can't write:

<a href="http://my.domain/my-file?param1=one&param2=two">link</a>

Instead you have to go with:

<a href="http://my.domain/my-file?param1=one&amp;param2=two">link</a>

This is a real drag.  I serve my blog from an XML file.  URIs must be
encoded in that file already, so now I have to read and then re-escape
everything for XHTML output.  Ugh!

Very interested to be a test animal if you're needing one. I've been a 
fan of X10 for a  long time and what said above is rather enticing.

I've acquired a Panasonic laser that needs a home and a fuser bulb, at
least. I'm not sure how well it works, may make a great parts machine
for somebody with a shop full of them. Parallel interface only.

I may be able to help get it from Sandy to wherever you are.

   For those who want to print cd-rom/dvd labels on a linux box: OO.o has
templates under the "label" directory.

   The package I had bought is the Avery 5692. OO.o does not have that
number, but each sheet is printed with "Use template for 5931 or 8931." OO.o
has the former (I didn't look further). Any generic lable compatable with
the Avery number will work, of course.

   I had to tweak the label in the properties box, but once I did it worked
just fine.

   So, no more disks handed out with hand-written contents, OK? :-)

So I noticed in the CP290 manual.

I'll see if I can figure that out.

I'd be happy to give it a shot on a couple of my machines:

200 MHz Pentium MMX running RH 7.0
Thinkpad 390X (400? MHz Pentium) Running RH 8.0

I've got another serial interface with the IBM Home Director logo on it, model 
HD11A, which I'm guessing is the same as the CM11A. It never worked with the 
Windows software that came with it. I never got around to sending it back. 
Seems to me there's an RF remote control with it, too. I'll have to dig into 
the back of the shelf it's stored on.

Again, if you're looking for alpha or beta testers, I'm game.

Interesting, and it is already installed on my machine! Unfortunately, it does 
not offer 600 Baud as one of the speed options. So, while I can fiddle with 
it, I can't try to force anything into my CP290.

Thanks.

Interesting! Voice output, car tracking, all kinds of odd stuff. No CP290, but 
if my HD11A actually works, I should be able to use it. 

Thanks for the pointer.

Rich,

I scale my image to the pixel size I want it to be.  Webpages use about
75 pixels per inch.  So I size the picture accordingly.  

I am going to have to try the quality thing.  

Just wondering what values would be good for web images.
