Testing out my new web server and ran into this issue.  When attempting 
to run php scripts from the browser I get the option to either open the 
file with an editor or save it to disk.  Obviously, neither of these 
runs the script.  I'm running Debian etch 4.0 with apache 2.2.3 viewing 
with iceweasel 2.0.0.13.  There must be a configuration error someplace 
and I need some help.

Frank,
Do you have this line in your httpd.conf


  #AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
    AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
    AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

I can't speak for Debian, but CentOS loads PHP as a Dynamic Shared
Object. If Debian statically links php, it should show up in `httpd -l'
in the compiled in modules. If not, do you have LoadModule and
AddModules lines in your httpd.conf file? e.g.

LoadModule unique_id_module   libexec/mod_unique_id.so
LoadModule setenvif_module    libexec/mod_setenvif.so
LoadModule php5_module        libexec/libphp5.so
<IfDefine SSL>
LoadModule ssl_module         libexec/libssl.so
</IfDefine>
LoadModule gzip_module        libexec/mod_gzip.so
[...]
AddModule mod_unique_id.c
AddModule mod_so.c
AddModule mod_setenvif.c
AddModule mod_php5.c
<IfDefine SSL>
AddModule mod_ssl.c
</IfDefine>
AddModule mod_gzip.c

Note that I've included more than what's needed for libphp5.so since the
order is important.

I think the debian equivalent of this is the set of symbolic links in
/etc/apache2/mods-enabled

You can add/remove modules with a2enmod and a2dismod (they are in
/usr/sbin), eg:

a2enmod php5

It's worth checking, for sure -- I had the same problem about 2 months
back, but I didn't take notes.  This is one of the things I did in the
process of getting it to work though, so that may help. (I think I was
having conflicting php modules/versions, but don't quote me on that.)

Alternatively you can get a directory listing of /etc/apache2/mods-enabled and
if php5.conf and php5.load aren't there create the symlinks.  The files will
be found in /etc/apache2/mods-available

Log file entries from attempting to execute phpinfo (test.php):

[Tue Apr 01 18:12:26 2008] [error] [client 192.168.0.199] (13)Permission 
denied: exec of '/web/httpd/htdocs/test/test.php' failed
[Tue Apr 01 18:12:26 2008] [error] [client 192.168.0.199] Premature end 
of script headers: test.php

Any clues there?  The permission denied line is interesting.  Wonder 
where that is coming from . . .

Is it outside a scipt aliased directory? Might have to enable ExecCGI if it
isn't ..  or so I read in my httpd.conf file.

ExecCGI is enabled in the root of the site so should be ok throughout.

This is a Web-based application to control video-capture devices, and seems a little tricky to set up. I am attempting to use it with SuSE 10.3.

I have Apache2, MySQL, and ZM daemons all running, and the Web interface opens at http://localhost/zm. However, I'm having trouble getting the capture devices to work. One of them is a bttv-based TV tuner. It shows a caption and the kind of random visual effects of a tuner that is not adjusted for a particular station. The other, a Phillips-based Webcam, flickers from time to time but does not display an image. (That Webcam, however, has kernel support, because it works with Ekiga.)

Has anyone else experienced such a problem, and if so, have they successfully solved it? This seems like a very worthwhile application, if it can be made to work properly.

Well, I've pretty much given up with (a) apache 2; (b) php; (c) debian.  
Life should not be this difficult.  This web site is running just fine 
on an older version of RHEL.  I'm tired of playing hide and seek with 
some (probably) obscure parameter.  In my googlage I have discovered 
many others in the same situation -- but no solutions other than to try 
a zillion different things.  Poor me :-(  <sigh>

I'm *sure* the fix isn't that hard -- and I really wish I could tell
you exacatly what it is, but since I can't here are some more
questions to try and jog my memory / your googleage.

Do you have multiple versions of php installed? (try removing php4, if
you have it and php5 installed)

Try reconfiguring apache/package X where X is something php/apache
related that you installed recently. (use dpkg --reconfigure
<package>).  Some of the installers, such as certain versions of
phppgadmin don't properly order the installation of their
dependencies.  If you apt-get phppgadmin without having apache
installed already, you stand a good chance of seeing this problem.
(disclaimer: this *might* be something I only ran into on an ubuntu
box... I'm not certain.)

What shows up in the apache logs when you try to load a php generated
page? (anything other than a standard file fetch? any errors about
php?)

How many php scripts have you tried this with? (It *might* be
application-local, and if your only test case was phppgadmin, maybe it
will work with something else..)

Based on old email logs of mine, it looks like I had this problem once
because only php5-common was installed, and I needed to aptitude get
php5 and some others (php5-mysql, but I don't think that was really
necessary for the downloading issue).

I hope none of those send you off on a wild goose chase.

ii  php4-common                         6:4.4.4-9+lenny1

I did have php4 and 5 installed a few iterations ago, but only 4 
currently.  I suppose I could switch from 4 to 5 and see if apache likes 
that.

I just nuked php4 and re-installed php5
same results, that is when attempting to execute ANY .php code, apache 
cannot seem to figure out who to send it to thus it gives me the options 
of opening the file or saving it someplace.

Hmmm, you have both php4 and php5 installed, eh? Maybe I will try that. 
Talk about grasping at straws! Could you send me a phpinfo output?

It turned out to be rather trivial: "Color Palette" had to be set to YUV420P, instead of RGB or Grey, which I would have considered more likely. I don't know whether this is generally true for Phillips Webcams.

Robert Kopp <iconoklastic at yahoo.com> wrote: This is a Web-based application to control video-capture devices, and seems a little tricky to set up. I am attempting to use it with SuSE 10.3.

I have Apache2, MySQL, and ZM daemons all running, and the Web interface opens at http://localhost/zm. However, I'm having trouble getting the capture devices to work. One of them is a bttv-based TV tuner. It shows a caption and the kind of random visual effects of a tuner that is not adjusted for a particular station. The other, a Phillips-based Webcam, flickers from time to time but does not display an image. (That Webcam, however, has kernel support, because it works with Ekiga.)

Has anyone else experienced such a problem, and if so, have they successfully solved it? This seems like a very worthwhile application, if it can be made to work properly.

What sort of quality have you gotten?  My brother tried to
use it in his store only to find that too much could happen
between frames.

If you have any suggestions/pointer I could pass along that
be cool.

Silly question but one that bites me all the time, are the .php scripts 
executable by the Apache user (User in the httpd.conf file).  Also, from 
my experience with Apache/PHP/Perl/etc, do not depend on the 
distributions packaging of Apache, it is usually broken wrt PHP, and 
other modules you might need are missing (web dav and dav fs).  Build 
Apache from source and point the configure script to php etc with 
--with-php=/path/to/php/dev.

Not unlikely; the YUV colorspace is used for video more than RGB (no
idea how greyscale is modeled). See

I highly doubt that this is the case with debian.  At most, you would 
need to install the appropriate package, which will typically configure 
itself.  If that fails, read the directions.

Googling the error "exec format failed" implies that you're trying to 
run it as a cgi without a shebang, which means your mod_php isn't 
catching it.

If you're using httpd.conf and not apache2.conf, that might be part of 
the problem.

Folks, 

I gather that registration for Ubuntu Live 2008 here in Portland is
open, at https://en.oreilly.com/ubuntu2008/public/register . It's being
held July 21-22.

Marsee Henson tells me that the User Group discount code is "ubu08usrg"

Unlike last year, that's only a 15% discount. (Last year, user group
members got in for $100) That's like $550 for the full enchilada. The
exhibits are still freely available.

Thanks,
Mike

What sort of quality have you gotten?  My brother tried to
use it in his store only to find that too much could happen
between frames.

If you have any suggestions/pointer I could pass along that
be cool.
My general impression is that the image quality is acceptable (at 320 x 240, at least), though the spectrum is shifted toward yellow. Other computers on a LAN can also view the image at http://hostname/zm.php. I haven't had a chance to put the application through its paces yet, but I'll post again within a few days for the benefit of others who might be considering using it.

I think I should learn more about the LAMP business, partly with this application in mind. I note that there are currently many postings on that subject. Can anyone recommend good texts for self-instruction on LAMP (or any of its components)?

Huh?  The Y in YUV is a luminence value, translating directly into greyscale. 
One of the format design goals was backwards compatibility with B&W
televisions.

Cool, I didn't know that. I have only had to deal with color video so

All,

months.  Can someone recommend a good alternative for colocation in Portland
and the surrounding area?  At this point our primary concern is reliability,

looking to colocate 5-6 1U and 2U servers, and as far as bandwidth goes we
would be looking at something like dedicated 3Mbps up and down, burstable to
6.  Thanks.

My company uses Easystreet. I can't recommend them enough. They have been
just awesome to work with, they have some of the best infrastructure I've
seen, and have had zero downtime in the two years we've worked with them.
I'll send you my sales reps contact info off-list.

It is going to take them about 2 weeks to get it to me. None of the
prebuilt models were very fast or had much memory or very good video.  The
configure-your-own models were much better.

Alan,

If yours has a webcam and you get it working, I would be interested in 
knowing how you did it.  I haven't had any luck with mine.  I keep 
trying to make it to a FreeGeek clinic, but haven't made it yet.  I am 
running Gutsy AMD 64.

Wow thats a lot of money. This Laptop should be compatible with:

Ultumix, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and other Debian based Distros. It may also work with some RPM based distros. 

You will most likely need to remove the internal wireless card and install a GNU/Linux compatible one. I would recommend an ASUS PCMCIA card I like but you probably have PCI Express. I would go with USB.

If it's an Intel card, which is reasonably likely, it should work
okay.  Intel is actively working on the driver.  If it is Atheros,
which is also very possible, Alan *might* be out-of-luck for a while
yet, as the driver for newer cards is being pieced together using
sheer observation, brain-power and sweat, but not any inside
information about the design of the device.

Google and HP say it is the Intel Pro/Wireless 4965AGN radio.  I don't
have one, but I believe that should be working now.

Not exactly working. I have the Intel 4965agn in my Thinkpad with Gutsy
x86_64. The wireless connects reasonably well if you have a strong
signal. But then it just hangs up on you at random. The fix is to
upgrade your kernel or, as I decided to do, put up with it until Hardy
comes out. Hardy comes with a kernel that makes it work. 

I understand 64-bit Windows also has similar problems with the 4965agn. 

If yours won't arrive for a couple of weeks yet, Hardy Final may be out
by the time it gets here.

Thanks, Quentin, I think I am going to start looking into Easystreet.  If
you get a chance, shoot me your sales rep contact info.  If not, no worries
I will find some sales numbers through their website.

If you come to the clinic with this issue, please do a bit of homework
first.  Look at your laptop on http://www.linux-laptop.net/ .  Do an
"lspci" as root and find out what model of camera you have, then Google
for that device number and Linux. Check the Ubuntu Forums.  And read
the pointers for this article: http://snurl.com/23jv7 (inquirer news
2007/04/30 article on USB cameras).  That is what we would start out
by doing, and if you come in with some of this knowledge we are more
likely to solve the problem in the time available.

I will do as you request.  I will also find some time for more tinkering 
before I show up...I have seen some of the threads on the Ubuntu forums 
and need to do more.

I have a T61 running 32-bit Gutsy and a 3945ABG.  It became less-stable when I
upgraded from Feisty to Gutsy crashing 1-4 times per day requiring a reboot
(most times a hard power off).  It installs by default using the ipw3945 module
which is now deprecated by Intel in favor of the iwlwifi system.

Here's what I did to use the latest version of iwlwifi (from memory):

aptitude install linux-source
cd /usr/src
tar jxf linux-source-2.6.22.tar.bz2

cd /lib/modules
rsync -axHP 2.6.22-14-generic/ 2.6.22-14-generic.bak/
rsync -axHP /lib/firmware/ /lib/firmware.bak/
cd 2.6.22-14-generic
ln -s /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.22 source
cp /boot/config-2.6.22-14-generic source/.config.old
cd source
make oldconfig

cd /usr/src
wget http://intellinuxwireless.org/iwlwifi/downloads/iwlwifi-1.2.25.tgz

wget \
http://intellinuxwireless.org/iwlwifi/downloads/iwlwifi-3945-ucode-2.14.1.5.tgz

tar zxf iwlwifi-3945-ucode-2.14.1.5.tgz
tar zxf iwlwifi-1.2.25.tgz

cp iwlwifi-3945-ucode-2.14.1.5/iwlwifi-3945-1.ucode \
/lib/firmware/2.6.22-14-generic/

chmod 644 /lib/firmware/2.6.22-14-generic/iwlwifi-3945-1.ucode

cd iwlwifi-1.2.25
make
sudo make install

rm \
/lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic/ubuntu/wireless/iwlwifi/iwlwifi/origin/iwl3945.ko

Take note that I did this, well, early today; I am still testing.  So far my
laptop has been up for 20 hours, with one move 20 miles from home to office
(where I am now).  Network at home is open, and office WPA.  So far so good.

In my experience you can avoid the reboot by unloading and loading the
iwl4965 kernel module (modprobe -r iwl4965;modprobe iwl4965).
However, I have yet to find a way to avoid the issue with the iwl4965
card.

I wish it worked as well as the older iwl3945 card in my old thinkpad.

That hasn't been my experience at all. I have a T61p with a 4965 card
and I run both U710 and F8. I've had zero problems with Ubuntu. A few
Fedora kernels have had locking problems, but I've had no problems with
the last couple. Of course, I haven't been compiling the drivers from
source, so that might have something to do with it.

Message-ID: <200804061349.40343.griffint@pobox.com>

Hi all,

Would someone with root access to an Fedora 8 box please do me a small favor
and run this command as root:

  lshal -u foobar

with the literal string "foobar" (or any invalid UDI). Then send the output.

I've been requested to update a bugzilla entry I made a long time ago against
an older version of Fedora. I don't have a Fedora 8 box handy and I don't want
to install it just to run this one stupid command.

Note that lshal is harmless. It's a view-only utility. Run "lshal --help" for
details.

Much thanks,
Terry

No output at all (same as with non-root).

Interesting. I guess they fixed it. The same command on FC6 gives an error
message that could only be useful to the developer and is otherwise
completely useless.

I get the same results. Additionally the command returns exit code 0 [success].

Yeah. I reported that as well in my original bug report. Apparently that
part didn't get fixed.

Bill,

Gutsy comes with Sound Recorder, which should be able to record the
radio talk shows. I've never used it, however, so I don't know how easy
it would be to set it up to do so unattended. 

Regarding youtube, I am not aware of any way to record them. In the
past I poked around a couple times trying to figure out how to save a
youtube video, but never found out how. Having said that, with only 256
Mb (I'm sure you meant Mb, not Kb), you might find recording video to
be a problem. Your RAM is barely enough to run Gutsy, and I'm sure
you've seen your computer using the swap file. The problem is that the
swap is painfully slow compared to RAM, and it may not work fast enough
to process the video.

Hello Linux folkz,
Could somebody please advise based on personal experience,
are there any good Linux compatible WYSIWYG HTML
editors. I tried NVU (which is not maintained any longer), then its
bugfix derivative Kompozer, which is in general the same thing.
In short I need a Linux compatible tool which would allow me to do
HTML page layout, without digging through HTML tags, and possibly
support CSS. I don't mind if someone advises on any commercial
Linux compatible HTML editing tool.

Thank you in advance for any hints or opinions,

Quanta Plus (part of KDE) is the most WYSIWIG I've seen among the free 
tools. Komodo will run on Linux but is non-free. I use Komodo for Ruby 
and Perl development but not for web pages.

In general, a lot depends on what your web pages have to do to earn 
their keep. If you're building something like Ruby on Rails web 
applications, I'd recommend investing in a good overall IDE, like Komodo.

One thought might be monodevelop.  It has a GUI designer, though I
don't know if it can be used for aspx pages.  The screenshot on their
website shows a GUI designer for a gtk-sharp app.

Eclipse is another strong possibility.  If there isn't an eclipse
plugin for GUI web design now, there probably will be one soon.  See
http://www.eclipseplugincentral.com/ .  One possible choice of plugin
might be

Take a look at the DownloadHelper add-on for firefox -- I believe it
will let you save youtube videos, and it may do so with radio streams
too, but I'm unsure about that.

Before This American Life had a sanctioned podcast available for 
download I used a program called "streamripper" to record it from OPB's 
live radio stream on Sunday mornings, it worked well and was simple to 
set up and use.  As for downloading youtube videos, there used to be a 
couple different greasmonkey scripts which allowed you to download the 
flash video.

Alex,

   I suggest that you think more about what you want to do. HTML was always
supposed to be used for content, but its role was hijacked for layout, too.
Layout should be separate from content. Use CSS for layout, and by changing
that file you can alter appearance without touching the .html context. Look
at the W3C web site to learn the few differences between html and xhtml, and
how to design your web site to be compliant with those standards.

   If you're going to learn you might as well learn how it should be done.
Also, by using any text editor of your choice to write the html and css
files you can see how they look on various web browsers (firefox, opera,
lynx, etc.). I doubt that a GUI developer shows you the differences.

Rich

There is 'youtube-dl': http://www.arrakis.es/~rggi3/youtube-dl/
It's a command-line app, but it's simple enough to use:

  youtube-dl http:<YOUR_YOUTUBE_URL_HERE> -o amazing_video.flv

It seems to break every six months or so (changes on the YouTube side
of things, presumably), but the author quickly updates the software
and all is well again.

Maintainability, readability.  It also reduces the number of bytes a
website user has to pull per page request.  An external CSS file gets
loaded once per browser session.  And a web page built on the CSS
principle is much shorter than one using tables for layout.  Another
reason: it is easier to render the content differently accoring to
media type (handheld, browser, printer) using CSS, since it has
built-in support for @media types.  Say goodbye to the "printer
friendly page" button.  Just print and let CSS work its magic
(provided you defined a set of styles for @media printer).  Every page
now has a printer friendly version lurking.

You could take it a step further and send XML to the browser, with a
reference to an XSLT stylesheet to digest the data in the XML document
and render it as HTML, which itself pulls in a CSS stylesheet for the
actual browser formatting.  But that might be overkill.  And XSLT is
not exactly terse.

All this talk about separation of content and style brings up another
idea for the whizzywig coveters: a CMS system.

Well, that depends.

If you're throwing together a couple pages to share pictures of your cat
with friends, don't bother. Go ahead, use every dirty trick in the book
to get the job done quickly and move on with life.

If you're creating a small site (< 20 pages) to advertise your
on-the-side consulting business, there are several advantages to
semantic markup and CSS. One is that it tends to result in higher Google
rankings. Another is that it tends to be more future proof, so long as
you resist the urge to indulge in too many hacks for IE (or keep them in
a separate stylesheet). In other words, it tends to work better as more
standards compliant browsers are released and viewers increasingly moves
from computer screens to cell phones and other devices.

If you're a medium sized business with hundreds or thousands of pages,
separation of content and design makes it _much_ easier to rebrand you
site without rewriting all those pages.  To be honest, unless you're a
Web designer, a hobbyist that likes to tinker with CSS, or a company
trying to find success through rebranding, the ability to restyle your
entire site probably isn't a big sell. But for some people it is.

If you're a programmers, separating content and design is like building
good modular code according to a recognized style guide. Sure your code
might work even if it isn't well implemented, but 3 years from now as
you suffer trying to add "just one more feature" you'll wish you'd taken
the time to do things right.

If you're a neat freaks like me, mixing content and design is like
hiding dirty socks under your bed. Sure no one else will ever know or
care, but it'll drive you crazy 'cause it just ain't right.

Richard,
I totally agree with you on this matter.
The content shall be always separate from the layout.
I feel myself very comfortable with writing HTML/XHTML code and CSS formatting 
directives by hand using just plain vi or Geany.
However, the the person with whom I'm developing a new site, doesn't know a 
thing about HTML/XHTML or CSS. He is a great artist but not technically 
inclined. Therefore, I'm trying to find a graphical tool which would allow him 
at least to create a basic site layout and all that eye candy. So I can code it 
up and make it working within existing CGI::Application framework.

Consider four visitors to your web space:

 Renee on her new iPhone
 Cal with his text only browser
 Michael viewing it on a computer display
 John printing a copy to read offline

All of those want to see your content.  All of their displays have different
requirements for how layout will optimally fit the presentation space. If you
tightly bind the layout and content you have to redo your entire web space for
each of the target displays.

On another level the powers that be are finicky about how their pages dislay
and are prone to making changes to freshen up the appearance for the style du
jour.  Best to have the content separate so you can just update the layout.

For how well this can work in real life see the examples at:

I've been using `slrn' since forever. There hasn't been an update since
Oct 2004 (v0.9.8.1), but the old tried & true works just fine. It's
available via yum and at http://slrn.org/.

I can't recommend free Usenet providers from experience. My feed is
bundled into my FiOS.

Thanks for the clarifications, I think.

In my case I would have to become extremely hungry to become a web
designer. I will never design more than a simple little site like the
IPA site that I recently created, using its GUI:

http://www.ipa4linguists.com

I don't know anything about CSS, but when I see the word "style" I
grasp the idea - that is, assuming there is some parallel in meaning to
styles as used in word processors. I have been using styles in word
processors since they first appeared.

My problem is that I am accustomed to applying the formatting (styles)
*as I produce the content*. It seems a total waste of time to just
create the content willy-nilly and then have to go all the way back
through it to do the formatting and design. In a sense, when I create a
paper document I create a "CSS" before I start, then tag the various
parts with the styles as I go along. In fact, the design factors even
determine to some extent the content. Should I start this topic on this
page? Will it fit? Or should I put it in a sidebar? Should I use a
pull-quote? If so, where would be a good place to put it? 

Therefore, design and content are part of the same process to me.
Separating them might make sense if you are a newspaper with dozens of
writers producing articles - then you need someone to put it all
together at the end. But when I am doing everything myself, it's much
more efficient to do it all at once.

But maybe I misunderstood the meanings of "content" and "layout."

There is a huge parallel.  And you understand how being able to redefine the
style and having the change apply all through the document is a great saver of
effort while ensuring the change is applied correctly and consistantly.

Yeah, so?  Do the styles first and fill in the content.  Or iterate and change
styles as the content shows issues with your original decisions.  That's a
workflow issue, not a content/layout separation issue.

Slrn has a fairly steep learning curve, but it is still unbeatable for
usenet texts.  For batch binaries, hellanzb is the best, IMO.  Pan is

ASUS motherboards have a solid reputation and I've installed many 
variants of Linux on them with minimal fuss.  Recently, my ASUS 
motherboard of 6 years died (probably static discharge...was on a 
carpet).  I replaced it with another ASUS (AMD based) with onboard 
video/lan/sound and CentOS picked it all up beautifully on install.

Alex,

   Well, why not do what I did when I re-wrote our web site several years
ago? Search with Google for web site templates, find one he likes, download
the .css files and salt to taste.

   Looking at the examples is the quickest and best way to see what's
possible. I actually combined two samples into the design I wanted, but he
may find someting exactly to his liking.

   The nice thing about this approach is the speed with which the site can be
created and tweaked. No need to start from scratch. Also, the two Eric Meyer
books on CSS were -- and continue to be -- exceptionally helpful for
designing menus, creating a printer version .css, and other useful ideas.

I've had good luck with Tyan motherboards recently.  They're typically
built more for servers, but there are also some desktop-oriented models
available.  I don't know about the CPU compatability, but you should be
able  to figure that out from their site.  They are well known for their
overall quality, but you also end up paying for that.

HTH,

   Which is exactly why you want semantic markup and to separate the styles
completely. That's the advantage of separating the styles (.css) from the
content (.xhtml) for web sites, and one of the advantages of separating the
styles (.sty) from the content (.tex) when writing in LaTeX.

   Rather than willy-nillying your processed words, John, you focus on
content and make sure you are clearly and effectively communicting. Then you
apply the style that you want, because that's already prepared in a separate
template file.

   By the way, there are specific style templates (i.e., package) for
typesetting linguistic papers with LaTeX. They also work with the GUI front
end called LyX.

   Futzing with styles in a complex document using a word processor turns out
results of the same visual and nutritive quality as processed cheese. This
is one reason many universities have their own LaTeX thesis classes: they
determine the style they want for all submitted theses and dissertations,
then each student creates the individual content.

   However, ...

I know this is awfully close to taboo, but is there any chance he
could run Visio? I have yet to find a comparable Linux compatible tool
for creating mockups, but Inkscape *might* be a viable alternative,
depending on how much effort/structure he wants.  At my office, we do
almost all of our UI design in Visio, regardless of what it will end
up being implemented with. No other tool I've found offers the same
combination of flexibility and reusable components (buttons,
scrollbars, etc.).

I have a Thinkpad T61 and Intels iwlwifi iwl3945 driver works perfectly. 
I didn't have any luck until upgrading to kernel 2.6.24, however.  I'm 
using the prepackaged Debian 2.6.24-1.686-bigmem kernel (on my Core2 Duo 
w/ 4GB RAM).

Your audience may be different but unless Cal is a blind/visually 
impaired person who uses a screen reader, which is in many ways like a 
text-only browser, I've *never* had a legitimate text-only browser hit 
any of the websites I've ever worked on and I consider it an absolute 
and total waste of time developing for text-only users.  Designing 
content for blind users isn't a bad idea though.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0804071315080.11158@shadow.bitmine.net>


I recently acquired an advanced minidock for my Thinkapd T61.  I dropped 
the laptop in and the USB ports fired up and did the right thing.  The 
external hard drive kicked in and mounted.  All seemed good.

Until...

1)
I plugged in the external audio connector for my desktop stereo system and 
found that it didn't work... only the onboard speakers worked.  Subsequent 
testing showed that even headphones in the port on the laptop do not work. 
The onboard spekaers are not muted and the headphones do not play sound.

Whatever y'all that could be shared is appreciated.  From LSPCI:

00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801H (ICH8 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 03)

--------------

2)
Undocking didn't work.  Now, I should let y'all know right now that I 
(perhaps stupidly) removed the partition that had all those Thinkpad 
utilities and this blue ThinkVantage button is apparently useless. 
Pressing the undock button made the little green triangle flash a bit, but 
the second button was still it with a big red NO sign.  I had to shut down 
the machine to get the undock to work properly.

Resolutions?  IBM wants huge money for a restore CD that will put the 
partition back in place.  I should have made one, I know.  Too late.  Shut 
up... but help me, anyway.

3)
The external video did nothing.  I have a Samsung 213TW LCD on the DVI 
output and it has the same native resolution as the 15.4" WXGA display on 
the laptop.  Can I get them both working with xinerama behavior?  If not, 
can I get a mirrored display?  And if not, can I at least get the LCD to 
work at all via the minidock?

Those are my issues.  Googling hasn't yielded anything significant, but 
hints are welcome.

Thanks.
Je.

Except I will be installing Fedora 9 beta on it. The kernel on that is
seriously bleeding edge.

I did manage to fix my other laptop.  The heat sink was separating from the
processor.  (Either they did not tighten it down correctly or the screws
worked loose.)  I had to regrease the heat sink and tighten it back down.
Works well now.  (Though my wife is pissed I ordered the new laptop before
trying to fix the old one.)

Uh, can't y'all just pull down the Debian 2.6.24 kernel package?  Are they 
not quite that compatible?

I guess I always figured Ubuntu was just Debian with cosmetic changes and 
more package dependencies to include autoconfigure scripts.

I installed Debian Sid on my laptop with no hassle whatsoever and no 
config file hacking that I can recall (except one line to make the hwclock 
update properly with ntpdate).

Anyway, mine's rock solid with the 3945ABG card.

Would not text-only compatibility be easily implementable with the CSS
paradigm we're pushing?  Lynx would simply ignore the styles, and all
that's left is the content (and [lack of] javascript; here is where
you would have to spend compatibility efforts).

An actual place I've used text/plain HTTP responses is in web actions
that are designed to be called from cron, and their output parsed by
another program.  I call it poorman's SOA.

Sometimes people confuse "text-only" with section 508c, which are the
government accessibility requirements for websites to help
people with disabilities.

Mostly, yes, but not entirely; how your content is ordered in the source 
matters to users using browsers like lynx, it doesn't matter to users 
using a regular gui browser.

That sounds like an API and not a web site.. and a XML or JSON response 
is (usually) just text too, content type headers are set to be pleasant 
and to indicate what the content which follows might be for clients that 
care.

I have a dual Pentium II 250 Mhz ASUS board that I just got back up as a 
server.  I can't even remember when I bought it; 1998, 1999.  Before it 
had a SCSI host card and would stomp the bogomips out of the 1.4 GHz AMD 
with ATA drives I am using for a workstation right now.

So 10+ years for that ASUS board.

I got almost 8 years x 24hrs out of a similar (asus/300mhz pII) setup
before it went flaky (never troubleshot to see if it was the m/b,
processor (which had been running fanless for 4 years without a fan!),
scsi card, or memory).  I also built a few clusters out of asus-based
machines that far outlived some of their no-name counterparts.  so
count another vote for asus.

I have been installing Asus boards for years. I pretty much felt that they
were the best.  As of about a year ago I installed 10 Asus boards and they
all display the same problem.  They lock up on boot, intermittently die if I
am able to get them running. Sometimes they run for a month or two, then
start up with that again.  I figured it was probably that type of board, but
have since installed several more Asus boards, all displaying this problem.
Pace Computers says they have never seen this problem before.  I have never
seen anything on the Asus website for a fix for it.  

Personally, I'll never buy another Asus board.  It will be Intel, if
anything.

Forgot to mention that to get the Asus boards running, I have to unplug the
Network cable, then it boots..but if I try to plug it back in after it gets
to the desktop..I may or may see it continue to run.  Tried disabling the
internal NIC and adding an external nic..not much help.

I have the iwl4965agn and I am told I need the 2.6.24 kernel to fix it.
It works OK as is, but I get random disconnects, especially if I have a
less than ideal signal. I would just upgrade the kernel, but I have
Gutsy now and Hardy will be out imminently. Hardy comes with the newer
kernel, so I have decided to take the lazy path and just put up with it
until Hardy gets here.  But I can afford to do so because I use
wireless maybe a couple hours once a week or so. At home I am wired, so
it is not necessary.

I have a T61 with Gutsy x86_64 and lspci reveals that I have the same
exact audio device. I also have a dock, but I think there are two
kjinds of docks and mine is the "mini-dock" or something like that. The
audio works just fine - internal speakers work until I plug in
headphones, then the sound goes to the headphones. If I plug a
headphone-to-RCA jack into the headphone plug (either one) I can
connect it to my home stereo and it works fine. The sound sucks,
however, because I think there is a mismatch between the output and the
stereo input - impedance?

When docked the audio out connector works the same as if I connect to
the one on the left side of the laptop.

The first thing I did after opening the box on my new T61 was to insert
an Ubuntu live CD, install Ubuntu, and nuke the existing partition. The
store I bought it from assured me that my license for Windows (license
number on the bottom of the Thinkpad) would entitle me to a Windows XP
Pro CD if I cared to pay Intel "a few bucks" for it. I never did, so I
don't know how much it might actually cost. I own the license, however,
so I could use it as long as I have an XP install CD.

Meantime, the ThinkVantage button works during the only time I want it
to work - when booting. It is the entry to the BIOS, and that is all I
need it for. Supposedly it also gets you to help files which explain
the functioning of the Thinkpad. That's what you need that old Windows
partition for. But I suspect it won't work unless you are also booted
to Windows. I don't have Windows on this computer, so Windows help
files are not very useful to me.

I never undock until I power off, 'cause why would I want to? If I
undock it means I am going somewhere across town with it. Right now it
is docked and the green arrow next to the wide silver button is lit up,
and the red light with the slash through it on the "2" (undock) button
is lit up. After I shut down the red light goes out and the green arrow
light comes on. Then I can push down on the button and it will undock.
The topmost "power" button does exactly the same as the power button on
the laptop, when docked. I don't know what the point of that button is.
If it works the same as the power button on the laptop, and the laptop
is obviously right there, what do I need another power button for? Oh
well.

I have never attached an external video to my T61, or any other laptop
or desktop I have ever owned. It's all I can do to figure out what is
on one monitor.

I'm a hug ASUS fan, and I've owned both the dual slot1 boards w/ SCSI 
that were offered by ASUS. But if your 1.4GHz machine is getting the 
"bogomips" stomped out if it by that ancient setup then somethings 
dearly wrong with your newer machine. ;)

Hmmm ... speaking of LyX:

1. LyX will save to HTML -- you ought to be able to do a static web page 
  with it.

2. The LyX/R integration on "literate" documents is near perfect now. 
You can edit a document in LyX with embedded R code to generate the 
graphs, for example. It might not be much of a stretch to embed a 
scripting language like Python in a LyX page and make dynamic web sites 
with LyX.

Ed,

    Yes, but that's the long way to get there.

   More directly, PSTricks can be used with LaTeX, and I've written it within
LyX, too.

   I just sent Jose' Matos (at his request) for inclusion in the LyX wiki my
little development app that embeds LaTeX in a Python function. I don't know
of examples of doing it the other way: python within LaTeX, unless it's in
the code environment for display purposes only.

While I don't have a T61, I suspect all three issues stem from the recent
migration of Linux and/or Gnome to "Hardware Abstraction Layer".   The
audio connection may be something as simple as gain control, and the 
GUI you are using should have an applet that communicates the gain setting
through the HAL.  

Note that headphones, and PC external speakers,  have impedances of around 
200 ohms while consumer audio equipment inputs have impedances of about
10K ohms.  Studio audio equipment is typically 600 ohms impedance. I can
imagine some Chinese engineer that doesn't understand this, designing
a headphone amplifier that doesn't work right with higher impedance than
cheap headphones.  However, it is also possible to cut down the output
gain from the laptop and increase the gain of the audio equipment and
avoid clipping and distortion.  So the first trick is to get the headphone
output port working right with with some cheap headphones, then move on
to the external equipment.

Personally, I order laptops with the smallest hard drive available.  After
verifying that the machine begins to boot, but before seeing any EULA 
screens, I shut down and store the original drive in a safe place.  Then I
put in a different large hard drive and install Linux on that.   Thus, I
have two unused T31 boot drives, one with WinXP and one with Win2K, waiting 
n a shelf for the day I decide to reverse-compile them ("EULA?  I didn't
agree to no stinking EULA!  If you don't want the bits examined, don't
put them on my hardware!")

Not that that does you any good, but other folks are buying T61s and 
perhaps one of them will do the same, and perhaps a copy of the hard
drive bits can be made available to you.

That said - undocking in Linux is also managed by the HAL ... badly.
If you are using gnome, the information filters through the applet
"Power Manager" (written by Ritchie Hughes in the UK).  Like everything
involved in power in HAL, it takes a while for it to detect AC adapter
changes, lid closure, etc.   Perhaps 10 seconds.  If I unplug my T31
from the minidock, I have to wait about 10 seconds before closing it
and sticking it in the backpack.  I also remember having to fiddle 
with some of the Power Manager settings to make it work approximately
right (I forget which settings).

HAL again.  Dammit.  With pre-HAL distros, my T31 would do the right
thing, recognizing external monitors and projectors when they were plugged
in during operation.  Now I need to reboot for the T31 to recognize the
external video connections.  I am told that this is fixed in the bleeding
edge kernels and Xorg servers, but I haven't tried those myself.  For
now, try rebooting with the monitor attached.  Also, use LSPCI and look
at /var/log/Xorg.0.log to see what hardware you are running, and look at
the results when booting with and without the external hardware.

- - - - - - - - - -

In general, I suggest trying these things out with a variety of Live CDs
of various ages.  The newest thing you can get your hands on, and some 2
and 4 year old stuff.  That is a relatively quick way of identifying
incompatabilities.  Most of it seems to be HAL.

Also, look at the linux-laptop.net website, the thinkwiki.org website,
and see if there is a version of "tpctl" or Thinkpad Control that works
with the T61.  

After the rest of you get the T61 debugged, I might buy one :-)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0804080920230.25840@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Question for all you ?ubuntu SysAdmins.

   When my wife sends a file to be printed from her laptop, and the printer
is off, instead of landing in the print server queue it tries to reach the
printer and reports failure.

   Having not had this situation before (print jobs always went into the
queue) I'm not sure where to look in this distribution.

   Hints appreciated.

It sounds like her machine is sending jobs directly to the printer, 
not to another computer acting as a print server.

What does the DeviceURI setting look like in /etc/cups/printers.conf?

Message-ID: <47FC0377.50108@acm.org>

If that topic doesn't confuse you let me try harder.

I'm looking for the correct terms to use to search for HOWTOs etc. to 
build my own Gnome desktop menus.

Back in the good-old-days when I used a simpler window manager I could 
just edit a file a line ot two and when I right-clicked on the 
background a sub menu showed up with these new items.
    It now takes a small army of XML-ers and strong drink to add 
something to the menu system. (See, I have done a little research.)

In a typical day I ssh into 3 to 20+ servers; each one from one to 
I-don't-know how many times a day.  This means opening a terminal, 
Ctrl-R and type a part of the username or hostname (if I've gone there 
recently) and then when I get the right one press enter.

I'm looking for a way to do what PuTTY does with it's aliased list of 
systems, but a little more.  I'd like to subdivided the hosts and 
accounts into categories.

With a little Perl I could do it but if something to do this already 
exists then let my laziness and impatience reign.


Thanks,
Rod

Folks,

Please take a moment to point out your favorite rs232-serial-to-usb
converter cable (and/or device).  Note I am talking about "regular"
rs232, not TTL voltages.  Must have good linux support.  There is a
bonus for a device not based on the pl2303 chip, since I've already
got one of those in the system I am designing and I'd like to be able
to distinguish them easily.  A model number and your vendor/source
would be helpful as well.  Additional bonuses for: inexpensive (<
$25); and local sources.

If you could have small print in an email, it would say that bonus

Hello Richard,
Thanks to you and every one else for the posted hints or suggestions.
However, you know those pesky artists.
They would never accept some one else's piece of work to be included into their 
creation. So, using pre-programmed HTML templates is out of the picture.
My artistic friend thinks in terms of shapes, colors and its combinations.
He wants to play freely with web page objects changing their colors, shapes and 
combinations without thinking about underlying HTML/XHTML tags and CSS 
formatting directives.
He gave me an example of Photoshop or GIMP, where you're actually creating a 
piece of art without thinking about what is going on under the hood.
The same kind of tool he would like to have for the web design as well.
I must admit, that there is a truth to these words.

Alex

How about using the GIMP or Photoshop to do his mock up? Would you be
able to translate his view of what he wants from that?

Most artist types use flash for building websites.  I know some myself
that don't know squat about HTML or anything, but can build websites
using flash.

Mine *appears* to not come back from suspend (dunno if this is different 
from hibernate), but it's just a weird video issue.  If I switch to a 
different virtual console, then switch back, the video comes up fine.

Sometimes I do it twice, just to make sure.

Oddly, the headphone jack seems to work fine when it's not in the 
minidock.  Headphones in -> speakers mute.  As expected.

I'll play with it some more.

The other issues are still pending.  I have been somewhat busy.

I have that same issue with Ubuntu 7.10 on my ThinkPad T61 and use the
exact same workaround.

Subject: [PLUG] Wireless (sigh)
Message-ID: <20080409121037.77d464bf.johnxj@comcast.net>

Now I've done it. The Intel 4965agn in my Thinkpad T61 has always been
flaky - sudden disconnects, especially when the signal is weak.
Supposedly Hardy will fix this, so I have been using a Netgear WG511T
borrowed from Keith instead. However, the wireless LED above the
keyboard has never come on regardless of which device I use.

There has recently been a discussion on the Thinkpad e-list that I
subscribe to about how to get the LED to work and, at the same time,
upgrade to the latest driver from Intel. I did it. The LED now works.
Yay!

And now the wireless is completely dead. 

However, I suspect there is a different problem than the driver. Some
facts:

1) The Netgear card also fails to work now. (That alone should be proof
that something else is boogered up.)

2) If I do iwlist wlan0 scan, about half the time it shows all the
networks, the rest of the time it says no networks were found. Doing
killall  NetworkManager, then restarting it, restores the scanning
ability. I can also restore it by doing modprobe -r iwl4965, then
modprobing it to restart it. But eventually iwlist scan fails again.

3) If I use kwifimanager it never sees any networks, even when iwlist
at the command line is working. If I use System > Administration >
Network, go into the Properties, gturn off roaming, and click on the
drop-down button it will display all the available networks about one
try out of 50.

4) If I do iwconfig wlan0 essid <name of network> I never fail to
connect. But that just gets me connected. I still don't have an IP
address, and nothing I have tried so far can get me an IP address.

I have concluded that my problem is that I can connect fine (although
some of the software tools seems kind of flaky), but I cannot ever get
an IP address. 

So my queries are:

1) Is there a command line tool to get an IP address from an access
point? 

2) I searched all over Ubuntu forums and failed to get a definition of
"roaming mode." Does anyone know what it is?

2) Does anyone have any other suggestions?

to get an ip for.

I think there is another dhcp implementation called dhcp-client, but
dhclient is what shows up on my ubuntu box.

Another way to tweak networking is with the boot-up scripts in /etc/init.d

# stopping your network:
$ sudo /etc/init.d/networking stop

# start up the network:
$ sudo /etc/init.d/networking start

# both in one command:
$ sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart


The /etc/init.d/networking script will use values from /etc/network/interfaces

Example interfaces file:

# Local loop-back interface:
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# my wifi interface (from memory... I'm not near my laptop)
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet dhcp
wireless-essid myWirelessAPid
# wireless-essid someOtherWirelessEssid

When I change APs I "just" edit the interfaces file to uncomment the
essid I want to use, commenting out all the others (I have 6-8 listed
in there) and then run the restart script.  It's annoying, but it's
good to know about for debugging.

Some T60s can be fixed by adding 'acpi_sleep=s3_bios' to the kernel
param list. (ati video only though).  There are other notes about
various models of the T60 on that page too, (my apologies if it
doesn't apply to the T61s being discussed here)

I was told that the bios didn't support the wifi LED in Linux (even the 
updated new one which was supposed to fix the volume keys in Linux -- and 
didn't, for me).

So what did you do?  Can you point us to this?

I'm not going to do something that'll break my iwl module, of course.

Dear John, 

I normally connect as Rogan has suggested, configuring
the /etc/network/interfaces configuration file. It can also be
configured with static network information, available with the "man
interfaces" command. My /etc/network/interfaces looks something like:

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

iface eth1 inet static
address 192.168.x.x
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.x.x
wireless-essid someid

auto eth1

That serves me well at home, where I have 3 essid's, and prefer to stay
connected to one. Of course, this assumes you understand IPv4
addressing,and know appropriate static IP addresses. If so, just be
careful to cite an address not used or assigned on your LAN.

When I connect remotely, I do as you do to connect to a remote network,
(sudo iwconfig eth1 essid someremote) and then run the 

sudo dhclient eth1

command - substitute your device name (wlan0) for eth1 (in both the
command and /etc/network/interfaces).

One other thing, I find the iwlist command finds more networks when
prefaced with the administrative sudo. It does even better if I first
"connect" the wireless card to a random essid 

sudo iwconfig eth1 essid bogus
sudo iwlist eth1 scan

Thanks,
Mike

It's a good question and/or idea.
I can possibly translate about 60 - 70% of his graphical ideas into
HTML/CSS. The rest will be complicated by HTML/CSS limitations and my 
insufficient experience in the graphical design itself.
The problem, however, is that any slight changes in the original design
would require big modifications in its corresponding HTML/CSS translations.

I can already envision a necessity for the Web designer's tool which would 
instantly translate page objects and their descriptions into corresponding HTML 
tags, forms, tables and such, and translate their positions, orientations, 
colors and other properties into corresponding CSS directives.

At the present moment creating a Web page is like creating a scientific 
publication in LaTEX in the mids of 90's.

Well, that doesn't getting me anywhere. As I said before, I can connect to an AP, I just can't get an IP address from any of them. That includes pubnet at PSU, Metrofi (wifiradar showed a strong signal), and in McMenamin's (also a strong signal). Whatever is wrong is blocking me from getting an IP address and it is happening regardless of what AP I connect to.

Here is what I get from the command line:

When I first tried this all it gave me was (but see below):

jjj at Devil7:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
Reconfiguring network interfaces...done.

> The /etc/init.d/networking script will use values from /etc/network/interfaces

There is something weird going on with the interfaces file. Originally it said:

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
auto wlan1
iface wlan1 inet dhcp
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

So I edited it to change the wlan1 to wlan0. After rebooting it now said:

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

And that's all it said. So I edited it and added:

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp

And saved it, then reran the restart command, and this is what I got:

done.

So again, it is still not getting an IP address. I can connect to anything just fine, but none of the networks will give me an IP address. And I get the same results if I use the Netgear WG511T card. There must be something unrelated to the iwl4965 driver that is messed up. What could cause networks not to give me an IP address? One thing that occurs to me is, what if they can't hear me?

I think I need more suggestions for troubleshooting.

Dear John, 

One other thought - when I connect via dhclient successfully, I get
messages in /var/log/daemon.log and /var/log/syslog. 

When there are problems, I think they also appear there. 

Thanks,
Mike

I just looked. I see just about all the error messages that appeared in
the terminal window when I tried to get an IP address. But no more
explanation than what I saw in the terminal window, e.g.:

wmaster0: unknown hardware address type 801

DHCPDISCOVER on wlan0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 4

Thanks for the suggestions. I haven't googled yet on the problem, so
that is what I will do next. I can't do any more testing until Friday
when I am back on campus where I have a wireless network to attempt to
connect to.

John,
You can run "tcpdump"  on the wlan0 interface to see the interaction of
packets going back and forth between you and the AP while trying to get a
DHCP lease.

IIRC correctly when you get a valid lease it should be something like

Request
Offer
Ack
Offer
Accept

If you sniff the traffic you should be able to see if the AP is sending any
traffic at all to you. Pretty much the sniffer dump won't mean much to you
so post it here and I'll look at it and see if we can figure out whats going
on.

It also just occurred to me that you might be getting a false association to
the AP and thats why you're not getting an IP address. Its not that the
software is flaky per se. You can configure whatever you want on the command
line and the interface will come up even if the AP isn't associating with
your laptop, I'll double check this to make sure this statement is correct
but I'm almost certain of it. Maybe googling for "unable to associate to
access point" will point you in the right direction.

I have seen an odd problem with dhcp and wireless -- and an even odder
solution.

Try the following commands as root and see if they fix the problem.

  touch /etc/dhclient.conf
  touch /etc/dhclient-wlan0.conf

When I create these two files my wireless dhcp connect problems go away. 
I have no clue why.

Tell me if that works.

I fixed the old laptop.  The heatsink was loose.  I added more heatsink

I got word that the new laptop shipped today!  I might even have it before

something is probably wrong with your system if you cannot redirect
output for any application run from the shell.  however, you might
want to check that you are trying to use /dev/null rather than
/dev/nul (note the second "l").

the permissions on /dev/null should be 666.


>    I don't want to send stderr to stdout,

then you'll have to redirect them both separately.  1> /dev/null 2>
/dev/null.  why not do > /dev/null 2>&1 which has the same effect?

   No, yes. I thought about it and decided that Null is a SQL data type so
what I want is nul. Now I know that I'm wrong.

Hi Rich,

You should be able to do this as a normal user.  Is the "/dev/nul" typo
above just in this email, or were you not trying to write to the correct
"/dev/null"?  If you were trying to write to /dev/nul, you certainly
would be restricted as a normal user since that file wouldn't exist and
only root can write new files to that directory.

Not sure this is the problem, but that would be /dev/null, not /dev/nul 
(see below)

Hm, I can do this as a user (Ubuntu).

krisa at kavula(~)$ ls &> /dev/null
krisa at kavula(~)$

Just to verify:

krisa at kavula(~)$ ls -ld music  &> foo
krisa at kavula(~)$ cat foo
drwx------ 19 krisa krisa 4096 2008-03-23 16:58 music


Maybe check permissions on /dev/null?

krisa at kavula(~)$ ls -l /dev/null
crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1, 3 2008-02-28 12:07 /dev/null

That doesn't sound like it will do what you describe above as that
will redirect stdout to a file called 2 in the background.  As Chris
mentioned, you probably want to do something like this:

$ { date ; zdate ; }  2> log.stderr 1> log.stdout

2 is the filedescriptor for stderr and 1 is for stdout.

Be careful with redirection as order matters.  For example, these are
not the same:

$ { date ; zdate ; }  2>&1 > /dev/null
$ { date ; zdate ; }  > /dev/null 2>&1

Although the latter command is similar to this command:

$ { date ; zdate ; } &> /dev/null

What should the LPI level 1 certification test cost and what other

If sample is written in Perl add 
$|++;
during the initialization sections.

If your program is written in C, you could try using fflush(3) or
fsync(2) to clear the buffer after each line or other logical data chunk
is written.

If your program is a Python script, then try sys.stdout.flush().

take the test and start studying..but I'm curious about the freegeek
offering. So even though I'm not really giving any information....I'll be
following to see how this turns out.  As well I might be interested in a

FREE GEEK does not currently offer LPI certifications. Please check

It used to be $40/exam at FreeGeek, which was split with LPI.

Unfortunately, FreeGeek has recently told us on their mailing list that
LPI would now charge them full price for the exam. Since FreeGeek can no
longer use these exams to raise funds, they have decided to stop
offering the LPI exams.

Unfortunately (IMO), the options are Prometric and Vue.

Thanks,
Mike

Use -s.  The default is 1.0 seconds.  Decrease that.  For example,
contrast this:

$ true && {
for i in {1..100} ; do echo $i ; sleep 0.1 ; done > output.txt &
tail -f output.txt
}

with this:

$ true && {
for i in {1..100} ; do echo $i ; sleep 0.1 ; done > output.txt &
tail -s 0.2 -f output.txt
}

Subject: [PLUG] best tool to convert a bitfield structure to #define?
Message-ID: <47FFAB98.20901@seitzassoc.com>

I need to convert a bunch of structures with bitfields to #defines. 
The structures describe hardware registers that I need to access via 
assembly code.  What tool would you use to do this, awk, perl, python, 
or something else?


This:
struct ADCTRL1_BITS {     // bits  description
     Uint16  rsvd1:4;      // 3:0   reserved
     Uint16  SEQ_CASC:1;   // 4     Cascaded sequencer mode
     Uint16  SEQ_OVRD:1;   // 5     Sequencer override
     Uint16  CONT_RUN:1;   // 6     Continuous run
     Uint16  CPS:1;        // 7     ADC core clock pre-scalar
     Uint16  ACQ_PS:4;     // 11:8  Acquisition window size
     Uint16  SUSMOD:2;     // 13:12 Emulation suspend mode
     Uint16  RESET:1;      // 14    ADC reset
     Uint16  rsvd2:1;      // 15    reserved
};

needs to be converted to this:
#define ADCTRL1_SEQ_CASC  0x0010
#define ADCTRL1_SEQ_OVRD  0x0020
#define ADCTRL1_CONT_RUN  0x0040
#define ADCTRL1_CPS       0x0080
#define ADCTRL1_ACQ_PS    0x0100
#define ADCTRL1_SUSMOD    0x1000
#define ADCTRL1_RESET     0x4000

or perhaps this:
#define ADCTRL1_SEQ_CASC  4
#define ADCTRL1_SEQ_OVRD  5
#define ADCTRL1_CONT_RUN  6
#define ADCTRL1_CPS       7
#define ADCTRL1_ACQ_PS    8
#define ADCTRL1_SUSMOD    12
#define ADCTRL1_RESET     14

BTW, using information contained in the comments is not allowed, as 
the comments are not guaranteed to be correct.

thanks,
galen

The second example should be easy enough with SED, but either shouldn't 
be too difficult with AWK ... I am basing that reply on the observation 
that the lines of interest have a common address pattern "Uint16", 
followed by the field of interest, which is in turn two fields separated 
by a colon.  Hope this helps, or have I missed something?

Subject: [PLUG] IMAP: Using and Administration
Message-ID: <47FFC04A.5030108@acm.org>

Anyone know of a good article, paper or book on IMAP.  Not just how to 
set it up on a server or how to configure a mail client to use IMAP but 
somethnig explains the really neat features and how to use them.

Some I'm kind-of aware of are: shared folders (well actually mailboxes 
in IMAP terms), server administrators that can create/modify users and 
access their mailboxes/folders without having their password.

I've seen references to these capabilities in reading the RFCs and 
looking at modules on CPAN.

I think some of this is tied to how the IMAP server (software) is built.

I am creating an application that needs to inventory a users IMAP 
mailboxes and create a report for them.  Fortunately the software I'm 
writing this for stores users passwords in plain text in a database I 
have access to but that may go away in a future version.


Thanks for any pointers of ideas,
Rod

Thanks Daniel.  Looked but didn't see what I was looking for.  The 
search continues and a third of forth re-read of several CPAN modules 
indicates I might not be able to do what I want, remotely.

There's an old O'Reilly book about it. The chapters on Cyrus are old.
Reading the cyrus-users list and documentation helps, as does reading
the RFCs, which I needed to do for some of my scripts.

Indeed. There is a variety of optional IMAP features and not every
client and server implements all of them.

You might find some examples in the couple of little scripts that I've
written:

http://haus.nakedape.cc/svn/public/trunk/small-projects/mail-utils/

Are you looking for a way around having to store the user's passwords?
You can use proxy authentication, where you authenticate as an
administrator and be authorized as a user. The IMAP server
implementation needs to support it; Cyrus does, I know. I have not
actually used it, however.

I don't suppose there is any chance the firewall has been turned on, is
there?

Run 'iptables -nvL' as root to list. If your firewall is disabled, it
should look like:

Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination

Thanks for the suggestion. Tried it, didn't work. 

Also tried Drew's suggestion to google on "unable to associate with
access point," but didn't find anything that worked. I've spent hours
on this with no luck. 

If I use the Netgear WG511T card it also acts weird. There are two
lights on it. Normally they are alternating back and forth until it
gets associated and an IP address, then both lights flash in unison.
But now only one light comes on and just stays on. If I do something
like remove the ath5k module and then replace it, or restart the
networking, the single light jiggles for a moment, but it never gets
both lights working.

I also tried a suggestion from Ubuntu forums that I install wicd. Wicd
uninstalls Network Manager (also uninstalls wifi-radar), but I let it
go ahead. I think wicd is very nice, but it didn't make any difference
in the problem. Then I searched in Synaptic on "dhcp" and reinstalled
everything. Still no joy. Finally I reinstalled Network Manager (which
uninstalled wicd). Still no improvement.

I got the instructions for how to install the new drivers from the
Thinkpad e-list, but no one there has any idea what is wrong.

Because the Netgear card is also acting weird I have concluded that
using the new driver goobers up something really basic, fundamental and
down deep inside the kernel. 

I only installed the new drivers from Intel (for the built-in 4965agn)
because I was having random disconnects with it and because the new
drivers promised to get the wireless LED to light up. So I finally
decided enough was enough. I went to the folder and did "sudo make
uninstall." Then I rebooted. And all is now back where it was. The
wireless is working as before. I'll probably still have random
disconnects with the 4965agn, but I'll wait and see what happens when
Hardy goes final.

Topic: PostgreSQL monitoring

Ever wanted a command-line tool for monitoring PostgreSQL? ptop is the
answer! Derived from the UNIX utility top, ptop automates some of the
most common troubleshooting queries. This talk will provide an
introduction to PostgreSQL monitoring, supported features in ptop, and
plans for future development.

Features include:

    * List of currently running queries
    * Viewing query plans
    * Viewing locks
    * View current user table and index statistics
    * Deltas on statistics at configurable intervals

Development is active, and the tool is currently supported on *BSD and
Linux, with a Mac OS X port on the way.

The project's home page is at:

Good suggestion, but it comes a few hours too late. I uninstalled the
new drivers. The 4965agn and the Netgear WG511T are now working as
before. I am disinclined to reinstall them to see if there is a
firewall problem. Why would the new drivers change the firewall
settings?

Thanks for the suggestion.  I ended up grabbing my Camel book and 
cobbling together the following:

#!/usr/bin/perl

while ($line = <>) {
     next if (!($line =~ /^struct\s+\w+_BITS\s*/));
     ($register) = ($line =~ /^struct\s+(\w+)_BITS\s*/);
     $position = 0;
     while ($line = <>) {
	last if ($line =~ /}\s*;/);
         ($field, $size) = ($line =~ /\s+(\w+):(\d+);/);
         print ("#define ${register}_$field $position\n") if (!($field 
=~ /rsvd\d*/));
         $position += $size;
     }
}

I'm sure it's not great Perl, but it does seem to work.

Do the structs consist entirely of bitfields?  Or are there other
non-bitfield fields mixed in?

Shouldn't that be:

?

I suppose it would be nice to preserve the 'description' part of the

Well I have currently two different IMAP servers I want/need to work 
with.  Dovecot as it was the simplest to set up (CentOS 5) after several 
  attempts with the the others and iMail (Ipswitch) on Windows systems. 
  I looked at the book but wasn't sure how applicable it would be to my 
needs.

Client capabilities are not an issue as I'm trying to write a 
mini-client; a report generator.

Thanks Will.  Interesting.  Looks familiar as I've been fiddling with 
the same modules.

Found the same information last week and again today.  Just not sure 
where/how to apply it.  Time for some more test code.  I've been using 
Mail::IMAPClient as well as fooling around with Mail::Box::IMAP4.

Yes, the full field width would be more correct.  I think I'll 
probably stick with the second version which just defines the bit 
number.  I could create masks as well, but most fields are one bit.

The original files with comments are available and in use, so no need 
to dupe the comments.

Subject: [PLUG] find | while read
Message-ID: <1208016753.7119.22.camel@simplicity.buscaluz.org>

Ever since I was taught "while read" as a method to avoid whitespace
problems, it has been one of my favorite shell scripting tricks.
Unfortunately, while working on a git script yesterday, I discovered an
instance where it doesn't work. Specifically, Bash is leaking the output
of find to the screen and horking stdin.

I found a workaround, but it's more complex than I like. I've included
three generations of a simplified script as an example. What I'd like to
know is, does anyone know a more sane method for looping over a list of
files produced by a command like find, git or anything else?

NOTE: To save time, let me point out that git doesn't have an equivalent
of find's --exec, so that's out. In addition, the script has to handle
whitespace in filenames so "for FILE in $( ... )" is also out. I have a
sneaking suspicion that changing $IFS could lead to a solution, but the
mere idea freaks me out.

Any takers?

# ==================================
# Simple but doesn't work
# ==================================
find . -name '*.txt' | \
while read FILE

# ==================================
# Insane but works and more secure

TEMP=$(mktemp)

I'm not intimately familiar with what you've got going, but often I rely
on the combination of find and xargs with NUL termination.  The only
characters not allowed in a file name in UNIX are '\0' and '/'.  If the
file names are NUL terminated, then you don't have to worry about nasty
parsing issues.  Unfortunately not too many tools support parsing based
on this, but xargs does:

  find . -name '*.txt' -print0 | xargs -0 aspell -c

To do multiple commands at once for a single file, you'd probably need
to muck around with the -I option in xargs.

good luck,
tim

I was using Mail::IMAPClient but found it really hard to work with.  I
also found that the bodystructure parser it was using did things
incorrectly (after manually parsing by hand, and also trying other
parsers).

I switched to using IMAP::Client, and have been much much happier.
It's not as object oriented.  Almost everything is an unblessed hash
so you will have to walk trees yourself.  I found it very straight
forward though.

Unfortunately, xargs doesn't work for what I need. But your reminder did
inspire an idea I might use in the future:

git diff --name-only HEAD~2 | tr '\012' '\0' | xargs -0 -L 1 echo

Um, if you're processing find output, wouldn't you be better off using the 
-exec option rather than a pipe?  That should avoid problems with the 
filename parsing.

I had a major spam problem on my hands.  Even with a mail setup that
includes amavisd and spamasassin, tons of spam was getting through.

Then I stumbled across
dev-perl/Mail-SpamAssassin-Plugin-GoogleSafeBrowsing (at least this is
what it is called in the gentoo portage tree).  The URL to it is
http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Mail-SpamAssassin-Plugin-GoogleSafeBrowsing&mode=dist

I've only been running it for a week, but this spamasassin module has
been working with a 100% success rate.  There must be over 500 spams
in my quarantine thanks to it, but no false positives whatsoever.

I also installed mail-filter/spamassassin-botnet
( http://people.ucsc.edu/~jrudd/spamassassin/ ), which also has
contributed to higher spam scores.  I think the problem I had was that
spams were being identified, but not generating high enough scores to
reach the threshold.  More filters = higher scores.

Well, keep in mind that file names can contain new lines.  Unlikely to
happen in normal situations, but if someone wanted to sabotage your
script, they could easily create one.  The output from git in this case
would probably be hopelessly ambiguous.

Please pardon the security paranoia... =)

You must not have read the part of my message that said that wasn't an
option because I'm not actually using find.

Carlos,

   I don't understand the context. Are you running your own mail server with
spamassassin, and still having too much spam getting into your inbox? Have
you periodically trained SA on saved spam as well as on ham?

   In my postfix UCE rules I have several RBLs checking incoming messages,
and some time last year I spent a couple of days tuning SA. Since then I get
no more than 2-3 spam per day (most days none at all) that slip past all the
filters.

Subject: [PLUG] automounting a dm-crypt based filesystem on a fixed device
Message-ID: <48013277.4070400@seitzassoc.com>

I would like to automount a dm-crypt based filesystem that is located 
on a fixed device.  The idea here is for both my wife and myself to 
have access to a shared directory structure that contains sensitive 
data(tax returns, etc.).  I don't want the filesystem or dm-crypt 
device to always be active, as most of the time it is not needed.  I'd 
like access to be demand-based.  Does anyone know how to do this? 
There are lots of instructions on the net for doing this with 
removable devices, but I haven't found any that would apply to a fixed 
device.

If there is a way to have autofs trigger hal, it might be possible to 
warp the following to my needs.
   http://www.flyn.org/easycrypto/easycrypto.html

It might look something like this:
   autofs calls hal
   hal calls gnome volumer manager
   gnome volume manager asks user for passphrase
   gnome volume manager hands passphrase to hal
   hal calls cryptsetup
   autofs mounts dm-crypt device
   filesystem available
   autofs idle timeout expires
   autofs umounts dm-crypt device
   autofs calls hal
   hal performs cryptsetup close

Thoughts?

thanks,
galen

Yes, I am running postfix, and this is server-side filtering.  But I
think the google module would work equally well with a client-side
spamasassin implementation.  By the time the google plugin gets to see
the email, we're well within the spamasassin process, and it shoudn't
matter how we got there.  The same blacklist is used by google for
their firefox plugin for detecting phishing sites.

I guess I like the idea that I can so easily take advantage of all
that hard work google does to maintain its blacklist.  This has the
potential for making a homebrewed linux mail server as spam-free as
any corporate lunker.  Where I work we route all our mail through
Postini (an expensive corporate offsite solution), yet some of us
still get all kinds of obvious, easily filterable spam (you can
imagine some of the keywords these emails contain).  I have to wonder
if our vendors (like Oracle) are selling our email addresses!

Looks interesting.  I just installed it, to see if it works.

The instructions on the page are a little wonky.

I had to install the module  "Net::Google::SafeBrowsing::Blocklist" 
by downloading the tar.gz file through the webpage, untarring it,
then doing the usual "perl Makefile.PL"  followed by  "make install"
(as root).  Then I could install the other two modules with "cpan -i"

The page suggests installing a cron job that runs every 25 minutes.
That is a little difficult to describe in /etc/crontab .  I made the
script ( which I called spamgoogle) run every 15 minutes with the
crontab entry:

   05,20,35,50 * * * * root /usr/local/sbin/spamgoogle > /dev/null

At the bottom of the page, there are 7 lines to be added to 
/etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf .  These are all supposed to be
in the box, but some typos goofed up the first three lines.

I'm eagerly anticipating the absence of spam, and the continued 
presence of the mail I want.  I am combining this with greylisting
at my outside facing server (which catches one spam attempt every
2 seconds) so hopefully this will turn the recent 30 spams per day
into one or less per day.

Can you provide a test case which produces the error you are observing
and what the desired output should look like?

Uhm... I already did but you snipped it out in your reply. At the risk
of sounding like a jerk while I'm still coming out of lurker mode, I
assumed everyone would be able to create there own files with misspelled
words.

echo "Thiss is mispeled." > foo.txt
echo "I luv spel checkurs." > bar.txt

If you actually ran the broken screen, you'd noticed that either (a)
aspell just dies or (b) aspell launches but a partial filename ends up
somewhere on the screen and aspell responds erratically to key presses
(like something else is stealing data from stdin).

I haven't yet established my reputation, so I don't expect everyone to
realize I'm already quite experienced with shell scripting. Perhaps I
should have done more to make it clear that I'm not looking for hand
holding. I'm looking for novel solutions to the problem of looping over
output produced by an arbitrary program and assigned each line to a
variable. Any solution must be able to handle output containing
whitespace without corrupting it. I would also prefer to be able to call
functions instead of resorting to helper scripts.

Right.  You can't have your stdin and have your stdin too.

  $ echo 'a
  b
  o q' | while read FILE; do perl -e 'while(my $line = <STDIN>) {
    warn "I ate your $line"}'; done
  I ate your b
  I ate your o q

So, if your loop command expects STDIN to be a TTY, xargs -d '\n' -n 1 
won't help either unless you want to find a way to stick a terminal 
between the xargs and the command:

  find . -name '*.txt' | xargs -d '\n' -n 1 xterm -e  aspell -c

Alternatively, you could do it in perl with the find (git) command as a 
piped open fork, thus the parent process still has a STDIN to lend to 
the aspell.

  perl -e '
  open(my $fh, "-|", qw(find . -name *.txt));
  while(my $file = <$fh>) {
    chomp($file);
    system(qw(aspell -c), $file) and die "ouch";
  }

Until this moment I thought this was a Bash bug. Now I realize it's just
a direct result of loop IO redirection. I don't know why it took me so
long to make the connection... Too bad things weren't designed
differently, I rarely need to redirect IO for an entire loop.

Which is actually what I already did a couple of days ago, but I enjoy
pushing Bash to its limits. It never ceases to amaze me how shell
scripting makes trivial, incorrect solutions easy and robust, correct
solutions near impossible.

So why do you say that setting IFS freaks you out?

  IFS=$'\n'; for FILE in $(find -name '*.txt'); do aspell -c $FILE; done

Seems pretty un-freaky to me.  In fact, I'm glad you mentioned it.

I've done it in trivial scripts and small inner loops, but because its a
pretty low-level setting and I don't yet fully understand the effects of
changing it, I tend to fear it. Instinct tells me that modifying $IFS in
anything other than trivial scripts is just asking for trouble, but
maybe that isn't true if you know how to manage the consequences.

Have you written any non-trival scripts that modify $IFS? Are you
familiar with the side effects of changing it, and can you give advice
on how to control them?

What about a filename with a newline? Pathological, I know:

touch "`echo -e 'foo\nbar.txt'`"

I would assume that you would use 'local' in that case and not call 
anything which is likely to choke until you leave the scope under which 
the local is in effect.  That's just based on my knowledge of perl and 
reading of `help local`, but the general theme is the same everywhere:  
when you modify a magic global which effects the core of the 
interpreter, you either use your language's scoping tools to restrict 
the range of influence or you put it back where you found it when 
you're done.

Thus, we have perl idioms like the following, and often see $|, $_, and 
various "knobs" from `perldoc perlvar` used with local().

  my $string = do { open(my $fh, '<', $file) or die; local $/; <$fh>};

   A spam message just came into my inbox. When I tried to learn the

   The line in the spam header is:

   According to the IANA page I found via Google, 116/8 is assigned to apnic.

   Why can't I get ISP information for this address?

Yep, that's a question which the emitter (git) must address, but in this 
context it can probably be treated as extremely pathological for the 
forseeable future.

Aside: It appears that IFS=$'\0' doesn't work -- bug?

Plan9 gets this right, right? ;-)

Fred,

   I got the same results with host, nslookup, and dig. So I must not have
asked the correct question.

   Since this was the only header (usually there are several between the
originator and here), I did not think that it could be so completely spoofed
as to leave no trail.

   If a direct connection can be made with a spoofed IP address, is this the
next form of spam with which we will need to deal?

Thanks,

Rich

A host is not a network.  whois will provide you with information about the
network.

I'm using dnsbl.sorbs.net and bl.spamcop.net.
I tried to set up my own blacklist, but what to
populate it with and how is a major problem.

I'm also using sqlgrey, but I notice some down sides.
It seems to quit blocking all mail, I'll have to watch
to see if this is true.  Another downside is that it
deals with clients who are trying to access an invalid
recipient.  I want them to get blocked before the 
sqlgrey test.  Allowing anyone who retries to get on
the whitelist isn't what I want, but it seems to be
the default for sqlgrey.  I don't think there are very
many spam sources that don't retry anymore.  A lot of
spam is getting through sqlgrey,though razor catches
some.

Michael Rasmussen gave a better example of usage (see his post).  But to 
the question "If a direct connection can be made with a spoofed IP 
address ..." - this is email we are talking about, yes?  (a) It isn't 
new, and (b) it is possible the IP has no relationship to the actual 
point of origin.

Subject: [PLUG] Converting .mov to .mp4 ... on Linux
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0804131500470.29366@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have one downloaded video in .mov format. When I tried to play it with
mplayer the attempt failed because libdivxdecore.so.0 could not be found. My
Google search for the library's parent turns up a lot of *BSD hits, but
nothing in source that I can build on my Slackware box. Looking further, I
see that DivX is a DVD pay-per-view codec, which I neither want nor need.

   Looking next for .mov to .mp4 converters all I find are tools for winduhs;
nothing I saw runs on linux.

   I'd appreciate suggestions from those of you who are more knowledgeable of
video formats on what to do to enable me to view this file.

Well... Here's my take on it.  The big question is: who added that
Received header?  Any number of forged Received headers are trivial to
add before the spammer sends it on to it's destination or relay, but
once it is out of her control, the Received headers are usually
relatively trustworthy.  The big question is, what is the first
trustworthy Received header?  Remember these are stamped in a stack of
sorts, with the oldest toward the bottom.

Assuming you can trust the Received header (i.e. the server that stamped
it is trustworthy), then the likelihood of a spammer spoofing a TCP/SMTP
converstaion is likely very low.  Provided you're using an even remotely
recent operating system, then you should have mostly unpredictable TCP
sequence numbers and an attacker would generally need to guess these in
the right order to keep the conversation alive long enough to complete
the transaction*.

Hope that answers your question on spoofing,
tim


* There are exceptions to this.  If the target mail server honors loose
  source routing, an attacker could spoof the source address while
  embedding her real address in the list of routers.  It is my
  impression that few, if any, hosts will allow this and certainly
  firewalls generally block these headers.  Within a local network
  these attacks are often still possible though.

Not that this will help you play them, but DivX and DIVX are two
different things:

   Therefore, my original question. There was only one Received header on

I have one .mov file to play with. I can get it to play with totem, 
although it fist complains about the GStreamer. I haven't found anything 
to convert video.  I might have the winduhs tools available.

Mel,

   Ah, well. Totem requires Gnome.

Thanks anyway,

mov's are quicktime, not DivX. So unless that codec also does quicktime 
you're outa luck. VLC should have no problem playing it, but then again, 
neither should mplayer with the proper codecs installed.

   Then let me explain what I did and perhaps you can point me in the right
direction.

   When I try to view the video with mplayer I get a missing library:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ mplayer Placing_Shadows_on_Zone_IV.mov 
mplayer: error while loading shared libraries: libdivxdecore.so.0: cannot
open shared object file: No such file or directory

   When I searched the web with Google for libdivxdecore I found many
references, but all for *BSD. Looking for libdivx, I see many .dll files for
winduhs and a couple of ubuntu references to divx.com. That site is offering
DivX for Winduhs. But, I followed a link in one ubuntu forum referencing a
linux version of their codec, but that page was not to be found (404 error).
Their latest release is also only for winduhs.

   If I can avoid this hassle I'll do so. What might I try since mplayer
wants a library I cannot seem to find?

Thanks,

Rich

spot meter the shadows, expose at one EV below metered value, bracket for
safety.

Shawdows on IV?  That's pretty hot exposure.

   I understan the Zone System, Michael. Actually, the meter reports 18% grey
which is Zone V, so to place the shadows on Zone III one increases the EV by
2. No need to bracket; that wastes film.

Message-ID: <20080414152708.GA4188@gate.kl-ic.com>


I reserved a hotel room for Linuxfest, and I won't be able to make it
this year.  It is at the Rodeway Inn on Meridian.  Two beds (allowing
for two people), no smoking, free wifi.  There is a 10% discount for
Linuxfest, so I expect it will cost $60.71 per night.  For two nights
(Friday and Saturday night, Apr25-27) the total will be around $134
with the 10.4% room tax.  

If anyone wants it, we should be able to transfer it by calling the
front desk.  Otherwise, I will cancel it sometime this week.

I'd like to match all occurrences of a given word that are not

to match all occurrences of the word 'bit' that are not in an assembly 
language comment, where the comment character is ';'.  For example, I 
want to match the second line, but not the first.

       sacl mode,2   ; set mode bit2=1 to SCS
       bit my_settings,bit11   ; am I articulated?

I've tried these:
  grep '[^;]*bit' foo.asm   # matches all bit
  grep '[^;]+bit' foo.asm   # matches nothing


Thanks for your help.

That's because the "bit" is preceeded by one or more non-; characters.

Make sure you match the start of the line in your regex and you're good:

grep "^[^;]*bit" foo.asm  # matches what you need!

Would it ever happen that 'bit' could appear multiple times on a 
single line, both in the code and in the comments?

Thanks!  So simple, and yet I wasn't seeing the problem.  Now I can do 
what I really want, which is catching bit0-bit19.

grep -i '^[^;]*bit1*[0-9]' *.asm

Yes.  I think the regex above meets my needs.

A little trick I like to use to help me design REs is to add the
--color option to grep:

$ grep --color '[^;]*bit' foo.asm
$ grep --color '[^;]+bit' foo.asm
$ grep --color "^[^;]*bit" foo.asm

The --color option shows me the pattern that matched.  If I want
context, I'll use one of the -A, -B, or -C option, or I'll tack on an
extra expression -e ^.  For example:

$ grep -C 100 --color "^[^;]*bit" foo.asm
$ grep --color -e "^[^;]*bit"  -e ^ foo.asm

And if there's a lot of data, I'll adjust --color and pipe the output into less:

$ grep --color=always -e "^[^;]*bit"  -e ^ foo.asm | less -r

Good luck and let us know how things go.

Regards,
- Robert

You are missing a "start of line"

Try:

Anyone familiar with:

reject_unlisted_recipient

I can't find it in the O'Reilly book, Postfix, the definitive guide.
That book it turns out is five years old...

Using this high up in my recipient restrictions seems to keep 
sqlgrey from greylisting when the recipient is bogus.  Does 
it check relay_recipient_maps or how does it work?

I'm having trouble finding documentation for this option.

Okay, but now why did putting this in 
smtpd_recipient_restrictions make a difference for sqlgrey???
I'm guessing that it's the default, but that it isn't applied
before sqlgrey is if it isn't explicitly stated.  I wish it 
was in my book...  Is there a newer syntax I should be using???
I'm hoping to keep the greylist from filling up with bogus
email attempts that will poison the whitelist.

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =    reject_non_fqdn_recipient,
                            reject_unknown_recipient_domain,
                                  reject_unlisted_recipient,

If I'm understanding the Postfix documentation correctly,
smtpd_recipient_restrictions either applies a default restriction, or
exactly what you tell it to. So, if you have the parameter and do not have
"reject_unlisted_recipient," this rejection is not performed. Anyone more
familiar with this able to confirm or reject this reading of the docs? It's
been a while since I actually administered a Postfix mailer.

There are a lot of "smtpd_recipient_restrictions" that _CAN_ be used but 
if you don't tell postfix to use them then it won't. 
"smtpd_recipient_restrictions" are applied in the order you list them so 
by putting this before the greylisting it gets applied first.

That make any sense?  Did to me!

On some mail spoolers I support we go even farther to cut-the-crap out.

         reject_unauth_pipelining,
         reject_non_fqdn_sender,
         reject_non_fqdn_recipient,
         reject_unknown_recipient_domain,
         reject_unknown_sender_domain,
         reject_unlisted_recipient,
         permit_mynetworks,
         ...

We typically get a 75-80+ percent rejection rate and the only customers 
that have complain are those on yahoo-groups and that was for 
header_checks that tossed messages with six or more of the same 
character in a row in the Subject.

   DeviceURI socket://lj5:9100

   Same as on the server and other hosts. But, when I (for example) send a
job to the printer and it's off, it stacks up in the print queue. The jobs
from her machine used to do that, too.

Thanks, Paul,

My understanding is that cups will try to spool to /var/spool/cups (or 
its moral equivalent on your wife's computer). That directory is 
usually owned by user root and some printing group (lp, sys, or 
whatever). It holds a tmp directory that's group-writable.

You might check permissions on those directories; perhaps they've 
gotten too tight or your wife isn't a member of some necessary group.

Have you installed the codec pack for Mplayer?

http://www.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/codecs/

Honestly, I don't know much about this sort of thing on the Linux front. 
But if it's an MOV file, that's Quicktime, and the essential codec pack 
has quicktime support in it.

As I mentioned, VLC.

Message-ID: <alpine.OSX.1.10.0804150909520.26432@guild.galois.com>

This is an "Ask Slashdot" sort of question:

   What are your best practices for maintaining negative
   namespace deltas?

I maintain the typical sort of system namespaces -- DNS hostnames and 
cnames, DHCP MAC tables, e-mail aliases -- along with what I imagine 
are more atypical ones like Xen virtual hosts and Trac (wiki) 
instances.

Adding to those namespaces is a clear process: someone submits a 
ticket and I push the relevant bits into production.

Subtracting from those namespaces is murkier. People don't always tell 
me when a system has retired or an e-mail alias is obsolete. Those 
namespace entries lurk like so much kruft in my config files.

What are the best methods you've developed for identifying negative 
deltas and getting the appropriate customer to approve the change?

Thanks.

This is a good question.  While I haven't had to deal with this issue
specifically related to the configuration elements you listed, I have
worked in security departments where the issue was about user accounts.
The same problem comes up with contractors and "process" accounts
(network accounts assigned for daemons and other automated processes).

Managers are all too eager to get an account set up for what ever their
project is, but they are very bad at asking those accounts to be
disabled when they are done.  Since this does have a significant
security impact over time, the approach to deal with it was somewhat
heavy handed (which may not be possible in your case).  Any account
granted in certain classes (essentially for non-employees) must have an
expiration date.  Managers are notified shortly before that date to
ensure they don't need the account any more.  If not, or if there is no
response, the account is disabled.

Of course this tends to anger lots of managers, but the trade off is
reasonable.  In your situation, it may not be as reasonable for most of
the configurations you listed.  However, for others, such as firewall
rule changes and external DNS configurations, it might be reasonable to
have expiration dates.  Perhaps if someone needs a permanent change with
no expiration, a management person higher up in the food chain should be
required to authorize it. 

Not a great answer, but hope that gives you some ideas.

In addition to the other suggestions, you may need to explicitly specify
the whois server from which to query. Your client might not be smart
enough to know that you're looking for a network object rather than a
domain object.

Try the same request thusly:

whois -h whois.arin.net 116.71.190.196

How about garbage collection?  Just expire everyone and wait for them
to ask for new resources.

Michael's right, of course -- assuming "likes" means "wants to keep."

If, however, I took "like" to mean "get extreme amusement from, at 
least for the short period of time it took the powers-that-be to show 
me the door," I could certainly like my job taking Russell's approach.

Hmm. Such a dilemma!

For MAC addresses you could pull the MAC tables on your switches and put them
into a db.  Same goes for IP addresses from the ARP tables on your routers; you
could then even associate the two to get MAC-IP pairings for historical analysis.

Once you had this data you could use it to audit DNS.  If an IP hadn't been seen
in the db reports for X days/months, flag it for removal via some sort of
notification.  Or transverse your zone files checking it against the last
timestamp of the IP addresses in your database.

Email aliases are a bit tricky, as most would always have spam coming to it, and
might not necessarily be used for outgoing email.

For aliases that having outgoing email, you could script up something to search
logs for outgoing email.

At PSU we had some crusty perl called macmon and arpmon which would scoop up all
the MAC tables and router ARP tables to show all IP/MAC use on campus.  This was
pushed into mysql which another system (ipdb) used to manage IP space (static
assignments, jack #'s, switchport info).

I pushed for collaboration between PSU and OSU to revamp the system using OSU's
Maintain project in 2004, but it never gained a foothold.  You might check it out:

I won't let Linux touch an NTFS partition on a dual-booted box, even 
read-only. And I don't care who says it's safe ... I've wasted too much 
of my life undoing stupid things relative to partitions and filesystems 
already. :)

Paul,

   Yes, it's all owned by root.lp on that machine. The tmp directory is 77T;
but I forget what the 'T' represents.

   The perms are the same as on the workstation/server. Very strange that the
message box pops up frequently telling the viewer that the printer may not
be connected ... even though no job's been sent there. Sigh. One thing or
the other, eh?

Thanks,

Isn't the LED on the laptop just for the internal card? The Netgear card 
you've installed is external, and therefor wouldn't use the LED on the 
laptop as it has it's own, on the card.

It doesn't come on for either device. However, when I installed the new
4965 drivers there were instructions for getting it working. After
following the instructions it worked for both devices.

A bit over a week to Hardy. Then we'll see if the 4965 is fixed.

Where are these instructions? (Since my iwl card works dandily.)

They are on the Lenovo Thinkpad e-list

I probably could. But I'd have to learn how and that takes more time than I have available right now. It's far easier just to reconnect when I get disconnected now and then and wait for Hardy. As for the LED, who needs it anyway?

If Hardy doesn't fix it, then I'll budget the time for figuring out and fixing the problem.

I heard that at least one other person on the list is interested in LPI

Thanks for you input.  I ended up grabbing a couple random ones at ENU
for under $20 that claimed linux support.  They turned out to use
pl2303 parts.  In order to distinguish the two devices, I am
standardizing the hub ports utilized (e.g. gps goes in hub port 2, the
line to the instrumentation goes in hub port 3) and then getting the
associated /dev/ttyUSB<n>'s by pawing through /sys.

It worked well for me, through Level II. Tip - for Level II - I didn't
quite believe that Procmail recipes would be covered on the exam,
despite the published LPI objectives or the book. Well, I guess it's
safe to say that they're fair game ;)

But the passing grade is like just over 50% of the questions - so while
studying helps, there's no need to stress out about it.

I remember Brian of Opensourcery telling me that he wanted to get his
people LPI certified. Don't know if he's done that already. If not, I
suspect he might be interested in a study group.

LPIC-1 and LPIC-2 have two tests each (4 total), Unfortunately, I think
the standard per test rate is $150. 

Thanks,
Mike

PCC Capital Center is located just south of the Tannasborne retail
complex... at 185th and Walker Rd.

In addition to Prometric testing, this campus hosts classes from
Portland Community College, Oregon Graduate Institute, Oregon Health
Sciences University and several other public institutions of higher
learning.

More exciting still, it hosts the Capital Career Center where you can
find dozens of free services to help build your job search skills. I
highly recommend Becky Meier's High-Tech Networking groups on Wednesday
and/or Friday mornings as a place where you can go to meet people who
may know a thing or two that can give you an advantage with regard to
your next prospective employer. They've got free classes in resume and
letter writing, interview skills, and programs to help overcome all
sorts of challenges (career path change, recent incarceration, senior
citizen, recent graduate, limited English skills, HIV/AIDS, presently
employed, long absence from the world of work, Windows user, etc.) and
find satisfying work. They are also good at helping "just plain folks,"
whatever that may mean to you.

They even have a resource room where you can use freely use their
Internet-connected computers for your job search. It never hurts to get
another pair of eyes to examine your resume, and all of their services
are free to the job seeker. (Grant money from folks interested in
seeing Oregonians employed pays for it all.)

They have been invaluable to me in my job search activities for several
years now.

No one hosts classes from the Oregon Graduate Institute any more; OGI 
no longer exists as an independent institution, having been swallowed 
up by the large hospital on the hill. The Capital Center may, however, 
host classes from OHSU's OGI School of Science & Engineering. :-)

Hi everyone,

My family and I are moving to Portland at the end of April. I've been 
lurking on the list for a few months to get an idea of what's going on.

Now that the time is getting closer, I wanted to ask if people would be 
so kind as to offer me a few recommendations for things like:

- what broadband service is best?

- what cellular company?

- cafes/bars with wifi

- computer repair shops?

- good stores for computer parts/supplies?

- anything else? favorite beer? best indian restaurant? :)


thanks. I'm looking forward to meeting people at the PLUG meetings.

   I've been with Aracnet/SpiritOne for ... 9 years now. Other folks have had
equally good service from easystreet, dslonly, and others.

   Depends on what you want from them. I use Verizon, but don't pay the $50
per month for web/'Net access because I have such little use for it that the
cost cannot be justified, even as a business expense.

   Yes. Many. You might have difficulty finding one that's not a wifi hot
spot.

   I like Northwest Computer Support in the far southwest reaches of southern
Beaverton. They're highly competent and reasonably priced.

   My preference is ENU, Inc. The one on NE 122nd Ave. just north of Sandy
Blvd.

   Buy rubber boots for everyone. Umbrellas are not cool. Good restaurants
all over the place.

Safe travels,

DSL providers Easystreet, Stephouse and Speakeasy.  The first two are local
companies.

If you're going cable you won't have a choice.

Almost all of them, scads of choices.

Enu and Pacific Solutions, depending on where in the metro area you end up
living.

Favorite beer?  Singular? 
What time of year?  With what food?  In what context? There is no one favorite
beer.  I will admit to being partial to Hallucinator.  

Tandoor at 4th and Oak downtown is pretty good.  
Thai and Pho are well represented locally.

Depends on what your needs are. The "big three" are Verizon, Comcast and

> - what cellular company?
Best coverage in the Portland area, Verizon. If you have an iPhone, 
you're locked into them. I have Verizon but I'm seriously considering an 
iPhone when the next versions come out. I don't know about the others.

> - good stores for computer parts/supplies?

Fry's if you don't mind driving to Wilsonville and back. It's not 
bicycling distance from downtown.


>favorite beer?

When I could drink beer, I never could pick a favorite. There are so 
many local beers of every recipe, including some recipes that were 
invented here, that you could drink a different one every day of your 
adult life.

A couple of other notes: Tri-Met plus bicycles is a great way to get 
around. Gasoline prices tend to be a tad higher here than some other 
parts of the world for a couple of reasons.

There are dozens of open source users' groups here. PLUG you know about, 
but there are one or two other Linux groups, a strong Ruby brigade, a 
functional languages group, a strong PostgreSQL group and quite a few 
others. Check out http://calagator.org (and if you're a Rails hacker, 
you can help out.) :)

Oh, yeah ... do you play "Werewolf?"

Depending on where you move you won't always have all the choices that
are being provided.  Qwest and Verizon divide most of the area for
broadband with
only Comcast providing an alternative.  Yes, you can get a local
provider but you will
still have to pay the local loop provider $15-25/month to get them.
If Verizon is offering
FIOS in your area DSL cannot be had even from the alternate local provider.

I have Comcast, high price but reliable fast service.  I live in Qwest 
land so can't get Verizon FIOS and to far from the CO to get DSL, so I'm 
stuck.

I don't drink beer, but Portland is to micro-brew as Seattle is to 
coffee.  We drink a lot of coffee also.  Lot's of brew pubs with their 
own brands.  Indian is all over, Bombay Cricket Club in Hawthorne 
district is excellent.   Swagat has a good lunch buffet but skip it for 
dinner.  There's lots of little store fronts all over.

Welcome.

When you want some tour guide info, give a holler off list and I'll do a
memory dump from my tour guide days.

If you need but don't have a real estate agent, I'll be happy to talk
with you about that, too.

As others have mentioned, Comcast for cable works well. I recently had a
cable modem failure. It was their modem. They sent a guy out on a Sunday
afternoon with a replacement.

> - what cellular company?

Verizon.

I'll second Rich's recommendation of NW Computer Support. Haven't needed
them too often, but they came through each time.

> - good stores for computer parts/supplies?

Ditto on ENU and Pacific Solutions. Many happy acquisitions from both of
them.

Also, for accessories and cables, NWCA in Clackamas.

Fry's was mentioned. If you go there (Wilsonville -- to the south on
I-5), be prepared to find someone who knows what they are doing on one
day, and nobody that knows what their doing on others.

Favorite beer, is anything local.

I am sure that we can give you a good list of great restaurants.

A lot?  A Seinfeld said when he appeared here,

   You people have a problem with coffee.  Where else do people stop for

There are scads of independent roasters here, Stumptown being the biggest.

I prefer my beers toward the hoppy rather than the malty side of 
things. Hawthorn's Best Bitter at the Lucky Lab on the near eastside 
of downtown is wonderful. Mirror Pond Pale Ale, despite its wide 
marketing, tends toward greatness (imho).

When malt is the order of the day, however, there are so many good 
stouts in Portland that it makes my head swim.

> Thai and Pho are well represented locally.

>From my office in suburban Beaverton, there are five Thai restaurants 
within a seven-minute walk. There's also Pho, Korean BBQ, and a couple 
independent coffee shops. The walk to the brew-pub is more on the 
order of 15 minutes <sniff/>.

I'm lucky to be in FIOS territory. I was an early adopter (Sep 2005) and
have been 100% satisfied. I have business FIOS so that I can run my
vanity web server (commercial accounts have port 80 blocked).
Unfortunately, having a static IP makes it difficult-to-impossible to
get FIOS TV (I have DirectTV). My 15/2 FIOS connection has been rock
solid.

Also Verizon - best coverage in pdx area. I get a discount through work.

I use Spirit One for my DSL service and I've had very good luck and
service from them.  On the other hand some of the Condos we've been
looking at were already wired for FiOS high speed internet which is
probably the fastest option in the area.

I currently have AT&T/Cingular and though the coverage they have is
pretty good here, I've had consistent issues with calls not going
through (I.E. getting a all lines are busy message when trying to make
a call).  I've also had Sprint when I first got here, they didn't have
as much coverage but when I had coverage their service worked well.

That said, it seems like all the Cellular companies suck in some way
shape or form.  If you already have cell service it might be easier to
just keep using it instead of paying for new service.

No idea, I'm in the suburbs and most independent coffee places have
free wifi.  However, the coverage at least out on the south side is
sparse enough that I normally use my cell phone to connect my laptop
to the internet.

>  - good stores for computer parts/supplies?

There are some local large chains like PC Club and Frys that have tons
of computer parts and supplies.

If you don't need brand spanking new computer parts freegeek is the 
place to go for used computer parts in the area.

It's an Olympus VN4100PC. Ubuntu sees it, but does not automount it and I can't figure out how to mount it manually.

I notice you snipped the output from dmesg. Did it give you a /dev entry
like /dev/sdb1  or anything?

No, it didn't give me anything like /dev - anything. 

However, after ten pages of Google hits I finally came upon this:

http://code.google.com/p/odvr/

And happily there is an amd-64 .deb, which installed just fine.
Unfortunately, I cannot for the life of me find any documentation that
says what ODVR is supposed to do or how to use it. There is no man
page. With the recorder plugged in I get:

jjj at Devil7:~$ odvr
Model: 4100PC

That's really grand. I already knew it was a 4100PC. I unplugged it and
plugged it back in, but still no automount, and dmesg / lsusb still say
the same things.

Any ideas how to use it?

I would assume you'll need to modprobe the driver into the running kernel

/sbin/modprobe odvr or /sbin/insmod odvr

then plug the device in

Doesn't seem to be a module. I just get "Module odvr not found." But it
might be called something else. When I do "locate odvr" I get nothing. 

I just e-mailed the developer. We'll see if he can tell me what to do.

Just got a reply from the developer. It is not a driver that allows the
device to be mounted. It's a command-line tool that just goes out and
downloads files from the device. The instructions are at "odvr -h." I
had already recorded a couple short files and when I tried to download
them I got an error message that the quality was not supported. And if
it had actually downloaded the files it doesn't show what the filename
is or where it plans to put it.

Tomorrow the POS goes back to the PSU bookstore. Now I'm off to google
for something that actually works on Linux. If anyone knows of any
digital voice recorders that are known to automount, please let me know.

There are voice recorder devices that you attach to an ipod that will let
you record. And the ipod automounts on Linux just fine =)

Yeah, but I already have an iPod, and it is too old for the recorder
device. So I'd have to trash a working iPod, spend a fortune on a new
one, and then spend even more money on the recorder device. In
contrast, the digital voice recorders run $30-100 or so. Plus they are
designed for recording voice in a lecture hall, which is what I want it
for.

Google is not helping much. Evidently some of the older Olympus
recorders automount on Linux, but that's about all I've found. Surely
there are other brands besides Olympus, but I'm not finding much.

All,

I was hoping that someone on the list could recommend a development

I recommend the folks at OpenSourcery:

   http://www.opensourcery.com/

I'm a customer of their systems services, not their development 
services, but they certainly have a clue or two.

Subject: [PLUG] wireless takes over in Ubuntu Gutsy
Message-ID: <4808C301.2050402@easystreet.net>

Both the built-in ethernet and wirelss devices work fine on my Clevo 
M570ru laptop. Well, almost. No matter how i configure the Network 
Settings applet, both the ethernet and wireless are on and active by 
default. Alarmingly often (though not always), the machine will intially 
connect via the lan (DHCP from my DSL modem), but after a while the 
wireless autoconnects to a neighbor's network, and my poor box is 
confused & can't connect to anything - it has a new ip address, but 
connections time out.

I can disable the wireless connection and "/etc/init.d/networking 
restart" and all is well, but that's annoying.

If, upon login, i manually disable the wireless connection via the 
Network Settings applet, all is well, but that's annoying too.

i found one old post in the Ubuntu Forums that describes the problem 
exactly (aside from hardware), but it got no responses. 
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=125046

Any suggestions on either preventing this, or disabling the wireless 
adapter except when i need it?

TIA,
Joe

For beer, you need to visit "The Horse Brass" on 52nd(?) and Belmont.  Many
many beers, hard cider on tap, and good British pub food.  It will be even
better starting the first of the year when all bars go non-smoking.

For Indian food, I usually do the all-you-can eat lunch at India House
downtown.

Make that 48th and Belmont.

or Produce Row, or the Green Dragon, or HUB, or Pilsner Room, or ...

Heck, I'll just follow up with a virtual pub crawl post.

   Recently I upgraded from OO.o-2.1 to -2.4. Today was the first time I
fired up the new version and I discovered that all the installed fonts were
gone. Remembering vaguely that there was a stand-alone tool to install
printers and fonts, I found and ran it.

   Now, however, while the fonts are visible in the selection box, they don't
seem to be applied to marked text.

   Is there something I missed in the process? I don't recall having this
issue before.

musiciansfriend.com and other music equipment sites have digital
recorders with a more musical orientation. They are significantly more
expensive, but some of them record on removable media or plug into USB
as a flash drive might. You might be able to find something second-hand
on eBay or portland.craigsllist.com

Message-ID: <48090705.4070503@acm.org>

I spent far too much time (enjoyable time that is) trying to get my cell 
phone headset to work with my workstation and ZoIPer soft phone.

Didn't make it as far ZoIPer because I didn't really get the bluetooth 
headset and ALSA to work as I understood it should.  I did the hcitool 
inq, scan, cc; and all worked fine but an ALSA device never showed up 
anywhere on my system.  I connected to my cell phone and N800 just fine.

Has anyone tried or succeeded at getting a bluetooth headset to work 
with a soft phone?

In my case I'm working with CentOS 5.

If the networks it's picking up are not conflicting (that is, as long
as they use different IP spaces, like 192.168.1.x and 192.168.0.x)
then you could almost certainly solve this problem by specifying a
route (with 'route').

I'm afraid I can't really help with the specifics though, maybe:

# assuming your wired 'net is on eth0:
$ route add default dev eth0

# see if that did something:
$ netstat -rn

that *may* break things horribly, but a reboot should set it all back
to normal... The netstat -rn command alone may be enough to clarify
what's going on, and make a solution more obvious.  (You'll probably
want to run that before and after any route tweaking you do.)

Not exactly with a cell phone (never tried the phone), but I do have
bluetooth headphones working flawlessly in Gutsy x86_64. I had a lot of
trouble until I installed Blueman, a GUI sync program. Blueman is not
in the repos, and I can't remember the URL, but you can download it.

Whenever anyone has trouble with bluetooth the first thing I recommend
is Blueman.

Since posting that I have discovered that the Zoom H2 is reputed to
work well with Linux. It uses a removable SDRAM chip. However, the
company says it only supports Windows and MacOS. It does save in MP3
and WAV formats, though. The big drawback is the cheapest you can find
it for is ~ $150. Plus it has too many features. Very bewildering for
those of us who are gadget-challenged.

Thanks.  I seem to remember seeing it but just skipped along past it.

Well I had a cell phone wireless headset (ear dongle) handy so it seemed 
like the thing to try.  And re-reading your post I see headphones.  I 
need the microphone also but will try it if it shows up in a RPM/Yum Repo.

these upgrades tend to be a

like all the stuff I have collected...

Gregory,

   While one can certainly reformat and install each distribution version
from scratch, almost no one does. It's not necessary. Only the system files,
libraries, and bundled applications are upgraded.

   You might want to test this by installing Grumpy Gnome before Hardly
Harry. (Or whatever the silly names are.)

The upgrade from 6.whatever to the current 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon, i think) 
was quite smooth, though i think icons for somw of the new applets (e.g. 
advanced compiz config) didn't autaomatically show up in the menus, but 
that's a minor nit.

For those requiring a more familiar versioning scheme, you can refer to them as
Ubuntu late-2007, and Ubuntu early-2008.  Since the one that comes out next week
is an LTS release, you might even call it Ubuntu Server 2008. ;)

I'd like to add greylisting to a postfix mail server.  There seem be

the following:

smtpd-policy/greylist.pl that comes with postfix
SQLgrey
greylistd

Does anyone have any strong opinions about these?  This is for a small

Be curious to know why postgrey didn't make the cut. Dead simple to  
use. No SQL server required; I suppose SQLite would be OK, but  
PostgreSQL or MySQL seem heavy for a 20 user mail server.

Greylistd looked like it's intended for Exim. Did I miss something?

I'm also curious, although I wasn't curious enough to bother bringing up
the topic myself. In part, I guess, because I've been using postgrey for
years with zero complaints.

I was trying to avoid installing an rpm of unknown pedigree. 
greylist.pl is in the postfix rpm, and the other two are both 
available from the epel repository.  If postgrey is the one to use, 
I'll look into creating my own package.

Thanks for the feedback!

Postgrey in written in Perl and is a noarch package, so you could just
drop in the Fedora package.

Go with sqlgrey and the php interface to it.

List the relay recipients explicitly amd
make sure you use reject_unlisted_recipient 
in recipient restrictions or your whitelist 
will fill up with junk.  I use postgresql
with it.  I had problems getting greylist.pl
to work at all, that's why I went to sqlgrey.

I just performed the automatic upgrade from gutsy to hardy on my ubuntu 
box. Compared to some previous ubuntu upgrades (like from dapper to 
edgy) this one was a snap. The only problems I ran into were due to my 
own arrogance. I chose to keep my original menu.lst and xorg.conf files 
instead of letting the updater handle them automatically. This 
(partially) broke my system and I tried repairing them manually but had 
to end up letting the automated system recreate the defaults (like it 
wanted too in the first place). Once I did this then ubuntu worked 
flawlessly again and I was able to easily rewrite the modifications I 
had been trying to keep.


Do not be afraid to joust a giant just because some people insist on believing in windmills.

   Each Slackware distribution puts all changed config files in the proper
directory with a .new extension. This allows us to go through them, one at a
time, and apply any modifications we made to the old ones. Tedious and time
consuming, but it works.

Galen,

   I tried greylist.pl and greylistd, but was never happy with either one. At
first, in ignorance, I invoked the greylisting too early in the mail
checking sequence. Ergo, _every_ message was grey listed and nothing came
through. I suffled them down the sequence but never came up with a
satisfactory solution.

   Whatever I tried seemed to require more attention and maintenance on my
part than the potential benefit it provided.

   After removing them and spending some time learning how to tune
SpamAssassin I achieved the results I still see: perhaps 1-3 spam per day
coming in. Of course, I have extensive postfix UCE rule lists and use
several RBLs for checking.

YMMV, as it is written,

Rich

Another vote for postgrey.  It stops perhaps 98% of the incoming
crud before spamassassing has to deal with it (and postfix on my
Mail Transport Agent firewall machine is getting about 1500 spam
attempts per hour).  

There is one postfix/firefox enhancement that I would like; perhaps
it is already out there and I haven't found it yet.

Some websites have some kind of email confirmation - "enter your
email address into this form and we will continue doing business
after you confirm an email we will send to you".

If the web page is a domain that postgrey hasn't seen before, it 
may be an hour before I actually see the email confirmation.  Unless
I add that domain to /etc/postfix/postgrey_whitelist_clients.local
on my MTA/firewall machine before I click "send" on the web form.
For me, that is an ssh login and a text edit.  Annoying.

Wouldn't it be cool if firefox had a plugin that recognized that
my email address was being sent out on a form, and it automagically
sent the domain up to the MTA/firewall to get added to the whitelist
(after a confirmation popup with the proposed domain in an edit
window)?  Besides the plugin, that would also require some sort
of listening process running on the firewall.  These two bits of
software are a bit beyond my meager programming ability.  

That would remove the last minor annoyance of greylisting for me.
Postgrey doesn't have it, but nobody else does either, AFAIK.

We can spend some time at the Linux Clinic setting up postgrey.
You will need to have postfix already configured and working, and
you will need ssh access to your postfix gateway machine, but the
last step of getting postfix running is fairly easy if you can
see an example (mine).

Message-ID: <20080419155153.GC5016@gate.kl-ic.com>


On Wednesday the technicians will install Verizon FIOS.
    (and yes, I will ask to keep my copper, and they will say no, and
     I will let them replace it anyway because the wires here are 60
     years old and get wet and noisy - I can put a one week UPS on the
     FIOS battery box for emergencies.  Ignore that issue, please!)

Some folks say that Verizon blocks inbound port 80.  That is not a
problem for me, my hosting is elsewhere.  Are there any other ports
blocked?

The Verizon terms of service and acceptable use policy appear more
permissive than the Comcast TOS that I suffer under now, so there
will be some services (VPN, nonstandard port SSH) that I would like
to send directly to my local firewall instead of to my distant
hosting machine.  If there are ports or ranges of ports that are
blocked on incoming, it would be nice to know about them while I
plan the transition.

John,

I know nothing about recorders, but I know that I record from records onto the 
computer using Audacity.  (Do I recall you bad-mouthed Audacity in the past?). 
I believe you can restrict the bandwidth and the # channels.  Maybe a script 
could be generated to launch things in the right configuration.

I've _heard_ port 25 outbound is blocked, but I can't confirm it. That
would be a real bummer for those using STARTTLS and authentication,
since it typically still listens on port 25. Looks like Google lets
you send to their Gmail relay on 465 or 587.

They (Verizon's contractor anyways) have been painting my lawn marking
underground services all this week rolling out FiOS in my neck of the
woods:

http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS222954+22-Jan-2008+PRN20080122

Though I have only good things to say about my current ISP, Spiritone,
I'm tempted to jump ship for 15 Mbit symmetric. Wish I could keep them
as the ISP and just have Verizon for the "local loop".

I haven't had any issues at all with port 25 being blocked. I don't  
run ssh on port 22 normally, but when I did, it was not blocked.

No, I often good-mouth Audacity. I use it a lot for phonetics work
because it has the wonderful capability of slowing down speech without
changing the pitch. Even Praat can't do that (although Praat is the
tool to use if you need spectrograms).

However, this problem is completely different. I need a simple digital
voice recorder which also functions as a USB mass storage device so I
can pull the recordings off the device and put them on my computer. The
Olympus VN series uses a crackpot way of recording that makes this
impossible. First, the recordings are saved on the device as DSS files,
but you cannot access them that way. Instead, you must install their
proprietary software which knows the signature of the device, looks for
it on the USB bus, then downloads the files while converting them to
WMA. The software is the only thing that can see the files on the
recorder. And the software runs only on 32-bit XP and Vista. It won't
run on Windows 2000, any 64-bit Windows, or any version of MacOS. How
lame is that? What was so hard about just making it a USB mass storage
device so any computer could see the files? What was the point of going
to the expense of writing their own proprietary software, and then
limiting their market to just 32-bit Windows users?

Once I acquire a device from which I can pull the files I'll probably
use Audacity to play them back, especially if they're WMAs. That is, I
think Audacity can play WMAs; if not I know how to convert them at the
command line.

Meanwhile, there is a VN4100PC on its way back to Olympus. Maybe if
enough disgusted customers send them back they'll catch on.

I worked with a group of network engineers that were concerned with
the same thing.
I was the first to switch and after I switch I ran a port scan from my
work (with permission)
to check for blocked ports.
The only port that was confirmed to be blocked (at that time) was
inbound port 80.  This was
in May 2006.  I haven't checked recently but I do run a VPN connection
to home for various things
and haven't had any problems.

It costs $150 because it's worth it.  It's a serious recorder with a great
sound, and capable of 90, 120, and 180 degree separation for L-R recording.
Heck, you can even record quad if you want.

I'm using it a lot for my podcasts now.  I even use it as my "desk" mike for
voiceovers/intros/outros, because it'll go "live" over the USB link and look
like a mike to the OS.

However, the default setting is trivial, and works.  Flip it on, hit the
record button twice.  Hit the stop button when you're done.

Dick,

I do my searching here:

http://lists.pdxlinux.org/mailman/listinfo/plug and it has a spot to 
search here http://www.gmane.org/.  It lists them with a percentage rating.

What I want it for is recording lectures. (Yes, legally.) That's why I
was hoping to find something cheaper without all the great features.

But having said that, your recommendation makes me want to put the H2
back on the list. Tell me, how good is the microphone at picking up
voice over a distance, e.g., in a lecture hall?

Last time I checked, port 80 was still blocked (they will unblock it for 
a "business account" at about $100).  You have to go about three levels 
deep in Verizon's support maze to get to anyone who has even heard of 
port 80 or who doesn't think it is some kind of nautical term for 
turning left.

It will sound like what it sounds like to your ears.  So, it can't remove the
mud from multipath sound, but if you can hear it, you can record it with the
H2.  I've never had such a clean sound before.

For some samples, you can download a few of the last dozen podcasts from
http://podcast.insightcruises.com/.  Everything from the "Scientific American"
cruise published so far was recorded with my H2.  (A few of the upcoming shows
required me to use a backup recording from Steve Mirsky's H4, for reasons that
are embarassing. :) Keep in mind that I'm recording in fairly hostile
situations (such as, the speaker has a mike, but I'm just recording the
ambient room and not tied into the audio system), and I'm compressing the
sound a bit to keep my download bandwidth within reason.  If you ask nicely, I
can forward you a snippet of the original recording.

The sound in those recordings was plenty clean enough. How far away
were you from the speaker?

I haven't had any problems with any port other than 80.  They do block
destination port 80 inbound, but nothing else for me.  I relay mail to
my home server on the FIOS line from my colo server right now, and vice
versa, and it works great.  I had called them when I first saw port 80
being blocked and a technician confirmed port 80 was the only port.

Not that I really trust them to be consistent or fair with this policy,
but that's been my experience.

hmmm... when wlan0 connects to the neighbor's wireless access point, 
this is what the routing table looks like


Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt 
Iface
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 
wlan0
192.168.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 br0
169.254.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U         0 0          0 br0
0.0.0.0         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 
wlan0

eth0 is completely missing! br0 is a bridge interface for 
VirtualBox.After disabling the wireless adatper in the Network manager 
applet and restarting networking, the table look good, and everything 
works just fine:

Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt 
Iface
192.168.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 br0
192.168.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 
eth0
169.254.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U         0 0          0 br0
0.0.0.0         192.168.0.1     0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 
eth0
0.0.0.0         192.168.0.1     0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 br0

running "route add default dev eth0" when wlan0 has already connected to 
the neighbor works, but doesn't stick through a reboot. i'm still 
puzzled about the Network Manager's behavior.

How did you search? I recently added a Google search of the local
archives, in addition to the GMane search that I set up some years ago.
I just searched with the Google search and it returns regular pages, not
the gzipped archived mailboxes.

<blinks> wow, I'm frankly quite amazed that actually worked :) it
*seemed* reasonable, but that's the first route command I've actually
come up with on my own.  Please don't make any assumptions about my
knowledge in the area--it's beginner's luck.

well, you could give wifi-radar a shot, and/or rmmod the wireless
device when you're on eth0.

I put pdxlinux.org in the text box labeled

	Search within a site or domain:

I don't recall exactly what combination of words I was searching for,
but I know it had the phrase "case fans" in it. I just ran that search,
without whatever else it was that I tried the other day, and found a
number of "normal" hits, plus a few gzip hits.

It appears that the unique search I did matched only the gzip hits the
other day.

So, nothing wrong with searching the archives -- just the search parameters.

Gutsy or Hardy?  We're three days away from Hardy Heron...

There are many hits on

Subject: [PLUG] Debian djb
Message-ID: <480D35A9.5090409@subtend.net>

I've been a fan of djb software for quite some time.  I used qmail from
1999-2002 before moving on to postfix, and djbdns from 1999-present.

The new DPL says next stable release is a goal for 2008.  Maybe my time enjoying
Ubuntu 8.04 will be less than I thought.

Debian Project News seems to be kicking again, and this gem was in it:


Debian Lenny to be shipped with qmail and djbdns in main
--------------------------------------------------------
In the past Debian users who favoured using the popular software from
Dan J. Bernstein (like qmail or djbdns) needed to use packages shipping
only the source and compile these programmes them self or use packages
provided by external services. This was due to a restrictive license
used by him to distribute his software. However, since Bernstein
decided to change the licence[sic] terms for his software, qmail and djbdns
may be distributed in Debian main and already efforts are going on to
provide packages with the next stable release.

Ok, I'm paring more news today than I normally do.

This is interesting.  New Cisco OS is IOS look & feel on top of a Linux kernel.
 I'm sure there are many long-time Cisco engineers rolling in their GSR chassis'.

It didn't. with the alternative disc in the drive, it could not find any 
upgrades.
the update manager refused to say that 7.10 was available. I don't know 
why.

Or, is it not created at all until I do so? Broader yet, is procmail

   SpamAssassin is re-writing the subject line of spam messages, but they

Try this:

Go into System > Administration > Software Sources

Somewhere in the dialog box that opens there is an option to add the CD
drive to the available places (like adding it as an additional
repository). I can't tell you exactly where it is because I have Gutsy
and the appearance of the dialog box is slightly different.

If that doesn't work, you can get the same options from within
Synaptic, Settings > Repositories.

If that doesn't work you can add it manually to the /etc/sources.list
file. Afterwards you have to refresh the repository list. I don't know
how to add it (the syntax for adding the CD - probably something
like /dev/CDROM). I also can't remember the command to refresh the
repository list, but someone else here will chime in I'm sure.

If none of that gets it seeing the CD-ROM, then it's time to search the
Ubuntu forums.

Subject: [PLUG] apache rewrite
Message-ID: <480E9C23.9020908@seitzassoc.com>

I can't seem to find the magic incantation to enable rewrite in 
apache.  I have the following in my /etc/httpd/conf/http.conf file:

...
LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
...
<VirtualHost *:80>
     ServerAdmin webmaster at foo.bar
     DocumentRoot /var/www/external/html
     ServerName www.foo.bar
     ErrorLog logs/www-error_log
     CustomLog logs/www-access_log combined

     RewriteEngine On
RewriteLog /tmp/rewrite-www.log
RewriteLevel 9
     RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}    !^www\.foo\.bar [NC]
     RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}    !^$
     RewriteRule           ^/(.*) http://www.foo.bar/$1 [L,R]
</VirtualHost>


I don't even get a rewrite log file with this, so I clearly have 
something basic wrong.  The rewritecond and rewrite rule were copied 
out of the apache docs.  This is apache 2.2.3 on CentOS 5.1.

The application of a cluestick would be much appreciated.  I've wasted 
far too much time on this.

thanks,
galen

I went to the Ubuntu Forums, and learned this Arcane Spell: sudo 
do-release-upgrade
(this worked)
So, with the Main Release Cd, (from you) and the Alternate Release CD, 
(from me) Two hairy hands and a Flashlight, it was unable to find it's 
own butt.
I hope gibbon at least has longer arms than the fawn and can reach that 
far...

    *sigh* I hope all this learning is worth it...

I downloaded the Ubuntu 8.04LTS Release Candidate (Hardy Heron) (*)
Live CD and tried it out.

Hardy uses X.org 7.3 for display.  One of the nice features is that
it GETS PROJECTORS RIGHT.  For distros from about the last 1.5 years,
you had to reboot the computer to make it see an external display -
it was not plug-and-go, the way it was 2 years ago before HAL.

You can either select a fixed external display configuration
with "Applications/Other/Screens_and_Graphics", or you can call
Preferences/Screen Resolution from the System menu, and set the
appropriate resolution for the external projector (or whatever)
and PRESTO,  the screen is cloned to the external display without
rebooting.   I hope we can try a few different laptops with my
projector and the Hardy live CD at the next Advanced Topics meeting.

(*) Note: in preparation for downloading the final iso image with
rsync.  I'm hoping that an rsync download onto a mostly correct RC
iso will be a lot faster than a virgin download of the final.  I'll
keep you folks posted on how the speeds compare when I try this next
weekend.

It varied.  For the Steve Mirsky talk, I had stupidly placed the H2 on the
podium, but directly behind where his laptop was sitting, so there's no direct
sound path from him to the H2... just the multipath from the room audio.

For the talk with Dr Gaby, she was walking around on a wireless mike, and I
had just set the recorder on a table at the front of the room.  Again, no
direct audio path - just picking up what you would have heard had you sat
there.  I think it was near her laptop though, so you could sometimes hear her
moving to the laptop to change screens or type something.

That's what I'm liking about this recorder.. it seems to be very much a great
set of virtual ears... whatever you would have heard sitting somewhere, you
can record.  It's absolutely a bargain at this pricepoint, and very portable
as well.

FWIW, I haven't had to reboot my laptop to connect to a projector
using Gutsy.  I've just had to log out and log back in.  Although, it
will be nice not to even have to do that.

If you've got SELinux enabled, Apache won't write to /tmp without a 
policy adjustment. Put your rewrite log in /var/log/httpd instead.

Keith-
	You can also use Jigdo. Jigdo, if you were not aware, takes an existing image, compares it to what is on the new image, downloads the changed files, and creates a new iso image. Works very nicely. I think it took a minute or two to update my beta iso to the RC iso.

I downloaded jigdo, and fooled with it a bit, but I'm not sure how to
run it.  I'm using the pdx.edu mirror at:
   http://mirrors.cat.pdx.edu/ubuntu-releases/8.04/

I don't see .jigdo files for "ubuntu-8.04-rc-desktop-i386.iso" but I
assume "ubuntu-8.04-rc-alternate-i386.jigdo" is related in some way.
There are some instructions on the Ubuntu site for running it,
involving loopback mounting of the iso, but I guess I need more of a
cookbook for the specific task.  Can you suggest something?

Note that the purpose of the exercise is to build an exact binary 
image of the official Ubuntu ISO when I am done.  Will Jigdo do this,
or will there be small differences, and the published MD5 checksum 
for that ISO will be different than my image?

----------------------------------------------
BTW, the rsync commands I used were:

(1) Listing the PSU Hardy repository:
rsync -v rsync://mirrors.cat.pdx.edu/ubuntu-releases/.pool/ubuntu-8.04*

(2) Using rsync to update the file:
rsync -v rsync://mirrors.cat.pdx.edu/ubuntu-releases/.pool/ubuntu-8.04-rc-desktop-i386.iso ubuntu-8.04-rc-desktop-i386.iso

What I expect to do if I use rsync:
  cp  ubuntu-8.04-rc-desktop-i386.iso  ubuntu-8.04-desktop-i386.iso 
  rsync -v rsync://mirrors.cat.pdx.edu/ubuntu-releases/.pool/ubuntu-8.04-desktop-i386.iso ubuntu-8.04-desktop-i386.iso

I did something similar from the beta to the r.c ;  at 400KB/sec
download, it took about 10 minutes to replace about half the image.
I imagine on Hardy release day, that will be quite a bit slower.
So if there is a quick set of user level commands to update it with
jigdo, I will be a happy camper. 

BTW, I run cloned RHEL5 on all my machines, but I spread Ubuntu among
people with less specific needs, and help Ubuntu users at the clinic,
hence the desire for Hardy.

That's very, very funny -- though I'm dubious about the no-alcohol

Keith,
    Sorry, I should have mentioned that Jigdo doesn't work for the 
'desktop' images because of the way they are packaged. It only works for 
the Alt/Server disks. The 'desktop' disk basically consists of a few 
files and then a giant squashfs file. This file contains the live disk 
and all of the .deb files needed for the install. Jigdo works by 
comparing the individual .deb files on the disk with the files on the 
server using the .jigdo file as a reference. Since there are no 
individual .deb files on the 'desktop' disk, you are out of luck. A 
similar thing is probably going to happen why trying to rsync the 
desktop iso. I'm betting it is going to want to get all of the squashfs 
file, but I've never tried it. I'd be interested to know how it works.

Jigdo will do this, just not for the desktop disk. It will create you a 
disk that is identical to the real iso, it just does it on a file by 
file basis. I know when I did this in the past, the difference between 
the beta releases was only a handful of files, so it was lightning quick.

Ok, so it rsync can see the differences, even with the squashfs image. 
Good to know. I'll keep that in mind when it comes time to update.

Ubuntu is definitely more desktop friendly. I use CentOS on most all of 
my servers, and Ubuntu on all of my desktops/laptops.

rm -- --one-file-system

Most core utilities that could be confused by names starting with a dash
allow you to use -- as a separator between options and arguments.

That's a little overboard, but does the job ;-)  Usually the '--' 
or './' are enough to disambiguate, but distinguishing options from 
arguments *is* left to the program and not the shell (though the '--' 
convention holds for most utilities (or at least those which did not 
reinvent the option parsing wheel.))

In any case, I'm reminded of:

Many programs reinvent the option parsing wheel.  I didn't think of ./
but I think that would be my standard way.  Still though API's often
give you easier access to edge cases with shell parsing.  For example
filenames with whitespace can be a pain.

Another trick that I've used is to let the shell tell me the file name
by expanding all the files onto the command line and then editing the
command for the files I want.  For example, let's say your directory
looks like this:

$ ls -1
--one-file-system
a
b
c
|
|foo

Yes, that's a vertical bar (i.e. pipe) in the last two files.  Start
typing this:

$ echo rm ./

Then press the escape key followed by the asterisk:

$ echo rm ./<ESC>*

Your command line should now look like this:

$ echo rm ./--one-file-system ./a ./b ./c ./\| ./\|foo

Edit the line to create the desire command:

$ rm ./--one-file-system ./\| ./\|foo

Under Ubuntu, bash gives you some hints to try if it doesn't
understand the command:

$ rm --one-file-system
rm: unrecognized option `--one-file-system'
Try `rm ./--one-file-system' to remove the file `--one-file-system'.
Try `rm --help' for more information.

Either 'rm --help' or 'man rm' on Ubuntu will give you this:

<quote>
       To remove a file whose name starts with a '-', for example
'-foo', use one of these commands:

              rm -- -foo

              rm ./-foo
</quote>

Good luck and let us know what works for you.

Regards,
- Robert

I appreciate the tip - I think I've just jigdo'ed the server CD from
http://ubuntu.osuosl.org/releases/8.04/ (which already has the mirror of
the final LTS), but the md5sum isn't what it's supposed to be. 

Perhaps that's a function of the way jigdo produces the new ISO file -
can someone more experienced with jigdo comment?

Thanks,
Mike

Thanks for the details, Garl.  I just finished using my "rsync
overwrite the rc" method to update Heron. It took less than 5
minutes.  Probably not as fast as optimized Jigdo, but a lot
less strain on PSU's network than a full download.

Here is the command I used:
$ rsync -v rsync://mirrors.cat.pdx.edu/ubuntu-releases/.pool/ubuntu-8.04-desktop-i386.iso ubuntu-8.04-desktop-i386.iso
ubuntu-8.04-desktop-i386.iso

sent 188420 bytes  received 150809993 bytes  595654.49 bytes/sec
total size is 733079552  speedup is 4.85

The md5sum was the same 8895...f1f1f .  It worked!  Now to burn a
bunch of Heron CDs.  That is a big image, I hope it fits.  I must
make sure that multisession is turned off in K3B when I do this.

For which chipset? I am not certain if this will work with nVIDIA and the nv
driver.  (It might with the commercial driver, but then again it might not.
Both are a bit of a pain.)

The shell expands the glob and passes it to the program.  Thus, if 
anything in ./ starts with '-', it is likely to be seen as an option 
and complained about unless you use the form `rm -i -- *` or 
`rm -i ./*`

The one option for doing this that is most likely to be portable across
different UNIX-like systems would be prepending with a "./"

In this example, you'd do the following:

rm ./--one-file-system

What do you guys think of the ReactOS project right now?  The group
believes that a free Windows compatible OS is needed for people who
have Windows software.  The 0.3.5 release is supposed to be out now,
but for whatever reason it isn't.  According to the roadmap, 0.5 is
supposed to come out this year, but I seriously doubt that that is
going to happen.  Asking about the delay on the ReactOS forums, I
got more flack than anything about it being an open source project
and therefore not constrained by time lines.  I have to say, building
a Windows compatible OS would be more interesting if the group would
meet a deadline for a beta version.  Unfortunately, 0.3.5 is apparently
not going to be the last 0.3.x release.  Why is it that Linux has enough
attention, developers, yet ReactOS does not?

If anyone has played Diablo II demo on ReactOS 0.3.4, you know that
there has been some progress.

That would work in this example, but with the filename that starts
with a pipe it wouldn't.

Maybe when Microsoft pulls the plug on Windows XP (which was going to happen
June 2008 but is now delayed) it will get more attention.

Those are different issues.  The '--blah' form is an argument to the 
program which suffers from no shell expansion but is likely to be 
treated as an option by the option parser unless prefixed with './' or 
preceded by a '--' argument.

Characters like  <,>,|,*,?,#,{},$,!,&,;,(),',",\, and ` have various 
meanings to the shell and result in expansion, interpolation, or other 
effects unless appropriately quoted or escaped.

The difference is seen in `echo \|` vs `echo --blah` -- the former is a 
matter of needing to escape the special meaning for the shell.  This is 
also why multi-argument system/exec is usually preferable to the single 
argument form (because the latter will fire-up a shell and parse the 
command as if you had typed it at a console.)

  perl -e 'system("echo", "|")'

  perl -e 'system("echo |")'

Subject: [PLUG] Routing problem...
Message-ID: <20080424145713.dnejtikiyokogg48@web.robinson-west.com>

There is an FVX 538 VPN box that is replacing
my local area Linux based network.  Uge!  Okay,
how can I set things up so that people can stay
on my local area network without losing access
to the FVX 538???  Actually, I don't want access,
but everyone else does.  Sadly, every time someone
moves over to the FVX 538, a printer or other shared
resource disappears from the local area network.
This also makes backing machines up harder to do.
It's a netgear FVX 538.

|---|                 |---|
| G |------|          | X |
|---|      |          |---|
            |            |
            --------------------
|---|        |  | | | | | |
| W |---------  | | | | | |
|---|           | | | | | |

The above diagram shows the three
original servers hooked up to a
backbone switch.  People are pulling
off the switch and moving to the FVX
538 accordingly.  G for goose is the
mailhub/dhcp server.  W and X for web
and xerxes are the lan routers to the
Internet.

One thought is to hook the FVX 538 to a
new router, but how to get people who
want to go through it to route to it???

Another thought is to make that new router
a smart switch that replaces the backbone
switch.  I've never programmed a box to
do that.

I suppose one option is to statically
configure machines that want to go out
on the FVX 538 via a new router.

A possible option is to masquerade from
W or X onto the FVX 538, if that will work.

Adding another machine is not an ideal
solution.

I have S-Video out working on my notebook. And I can see my normal screen.
When I start up Kaffeine or MPlayer to play a DVD the DVD play image does not
display on the external S-Video driven screen.

Sound familiar?   I had the same problem last summer (?) some time.

Someone provided a start up option to the movie player software that worked.

I can't find my notes on the matter and my search-foo of the PLUG archives
isn't finding it either.

So what was that solution?

No actually, there hasn't. And your example speaks alot to as why. You 
mention progress when this OS can finally play a 7 year old game. That's 
not what the word progress means. Regular Linux distros are light years 
ahead of ReactOS when it comes to running Windows programs. I don't know 
why that project exists still. IMO it offers nothing.

I looked through the list of supported applications, and they seem to be very limited. I'm sure that WINE on Linux will allow a greater number of applications to run. Perhaps those who are involved in the ReactOS project see some hope for the future, but at the present it's disappointing.

While yes wine does appear to be better capable of running windows 
software at this time, if reactOS progresses far enough I see it as 
being potentially useful in getting people to use open source software. 
Many people don't know what open source really is and just think it's 
'amateur software that only geeks know how to use' not realizing that 
all the 'amateurs' in the world combined together can generally make a 
superior product then the big software companies. Generally once people 
start using open source and realize how good it is they are more likely 
to continue using it but it's hard for people to just immediately jump 
right into linux where everythings different and many of their most 
familiar applications (that they wasted good money on) won't work 
anymore. Also, I personally don't think any open source project is a 
waste. Take reactOS for example, even if the project were to die 
tomorrow for some reason alot of the code they write is merged into wine 
and their very existence improves the wine project. Thats one of the big 
strengths of open source compared to closed source. If a closed source 
project dies it is completely dead and was just a waste of time. If an 
open source project dies then it's code can be used be reused in a 
different project meaning even projects that don't complete their 
objectives still provide to the open source community.


Do not be afraid to joust a giant just because some people insist on believing in windmills.

What circle of people are we talking about here? "Many people" would 
just gloss over at what you just said. Many people don't care at all 
about any philosophical openness that is important to some other people, 
that is if you're talking about end users.

People want stuff to work fuss free. They want it to work with what 
their their friends and co-workers use if they use something different. 
They want it to be easy to use. All three of those things are very 
important.

There are people that are willing to put in the time to get an 
alternative to work for them. JJJ on this list is a person like this and 
I applaud him. But most end users, "many people", don't want to work or 
learn such things. And they don't care about the restrictive aspects of 
certain proprietary environments as it doesn't affect them /enough/ to 
matter or cause them to want to change.

If the .lock file exists, it there as a temporary file.  After a reboot, or
worst case after a restore, these files are of no value.  They are of
no value to the backup either.  Figure out a way to ignore the .lock files
in your backup.

As I understand it, a lock file is used by a program to tell other
instances of that program, or other programs that it is using some
resource. You have a program, or programs that use .lock files for this
purpose.

Ordinarily, the program should clean up after itself and delete the lock
file when it is finished with it. If the program halts abnormally, the
lock file won't go away. At that point, the lock file is no longer
relevant, and may be deleted.

Subject: [PLUG] apache auth based on uri
Message-ID: <4811FA25.7040900@seitzassoc.com>

In apache, is it possible to do authorization based on a pattern in 
the uri?  I'd like to be able to create a single container that would 
control access to various directories where the directory name is the 
same as an auth group name.  For example:

<DirectoryMatch /share/([^/]+) >
     ...
     Require group \1
</DirectoryMatch>


Instead of:

<Directory /share/proj1 >
     ...
     Require group proj1
</Directory>

<Directory /share/proj2 >
     ...
     Require group proj2
</Directory>

<Directory /share/proj3 >
     ...
     Require group proj3
</Directory>


Any ideas?

thanks,
galen

while file locking under unix is a hairy story
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_locking#File_locking_in_UNIX),
backing up locks needs not be.  in fact, backing up a lock file really
shouldn't even hang--i'd be interested to see (the relevant portion
of) an strace of the backup process.  running as root should get every
file, regardless of type, if you use the right options (backing up
device files can be tricky if you're not careful.../dev/sda is a
really big file if you try to read its contents, and won't fit onto
/dev/sda1 without some compression =))

all that aside, if you (or your backup program) is using something like tar,

   tar --exclude=.lock

will dodge the problem.  if not using tar, generating a filelist and
then putting the files into the backup should somewhere, somewhen,
give you an opportunity to:

   grep -v /.lock$

luck++;

I think the second one is illegal. It should read

   droberts  ALL = (ALL) ALL

The "(ALL)" is what sudo calls the Runas_Spec, which consists of a 
Runas_List in parens. By default, the Runas_List is "root," but it's 
configurable.

In the default configuration, there's not much practical difference 
between the two. In configuration #1, droberts would have to jump a 
hoop or two if he wanted to run a process as, e.g., the Apache user. 
Typically the hoop is navigated by using the su command:

   sudo su apache command

A legal version of configuration #2, otoh, would mean he could do it 
directly, e.g.,

   sudo -u apache command

The real power of the runas stuff becomes more apparent when you set 
runas_default to something other than root. In that case, you have to 
explicitly add root to your Runas_Spec.

as i understand from the sudoers(5) man page and a bit of testing, the
(ALL) is what userid's the user on the left is allowed to run the
commands on the right as.

ALL is pretty self explanatory, but if it's absent, it actually
creates the restriction that the authorized user can run commands ONLY
as root, and not as, say, www-data or any other userid.

of course, in the case of ALL = ALL, it's not changing anything, since
you can always sudo su - otheruser and do the same thing...

allow your power users to perform?
I am getting shredded on trying to implement a policy that says no one
is to have full sudo to root access..But I am also arguing that it is a
reasonable approach to all specific sudo to root acccess to a LIMITED
command subset..
What might be those command subset in your experience that seems
reasonable?

Reasonable or not, at my workplace sudo rights are only assigned and allowed
on a "need to do it for your job function" basis.  There's no generic listing
of what's reasonable.  

This is backed up with security department held root passwords and passwords
to accounts with elevated, even with full root sudo, privleges.  These are
used when the pre-defined sudo lists prove insufficient to resolve an issue.

in my experience, it's really hard to securely set up sudo so that
people can't subvert it--a few simple commands are easy enough
(shutdown, ls), but once you get into anything complicated or
explicitly excluding commands, it doesn't take much for a clever
person to get a root shell (most editors all you to shell out;
disincluding shells is great until i copy a shell into a binary called
"notashell" and run that instead; a surprising number of innocuous
commands can be used to subvert the system---think cat /etc/shadow and
then running crack on it).

in the past, i've taken a functional view on this--what is it you
*actually need to do* and then crafting access methods that give the
minimum privilege needed to accomplish the task.  it usually comes
down to group ownership/permissions on certain files, rather than
sudo, and i usually sleep decently at night knowing that they aren't
going to have done something naughty in the interim.

unfortunately cranky power users are the hardest to pin down, but if
you have buy-in on the policy and can inconvenience them a little into
waiting until they run up against something they can't do and having
you enable that (after they justify their need!), you have a much
better likelihood (IMHO) of keeping them from shooting you in the
foot.

That's kind of what I figured a .lock file was. 

I back up only sporadically because I don't create important stuff
every day. I just back up after I have done something that I want to be
sure I don't lose - which ends up averaging about once a week.
Sometimes it might be every day for several days in a row, then none
for a couple of weeks during which all I did was browse and read
e-mails. I also use my thumb drive for a quickie backup of new work.

Because of my simple needs I use Nautilus to drag ~/ on my laptop to a
folder on my desktop computer. That's where I run into the .lock
problem. Today I decided to try the cp command instead, but cp won't
copy directories unless I can figure out the command, and the man page
eludes my comprehension. 

Today I wanted to make a more thorough backup in anticipation of doing
an apt-get dist-upgrade to Hardy. I decided to try to rsync to an empty
folder on the desktop. It worked great for ~/, but when I tried other
folders I got a lot of errors - permission denied, even when I sudo'ed
it. From past experience, rsync is a pain. Lots of bugs, and horribly
complex. I've also used tar and dar, but I don't like my backups
compressed and everything all in one file. Disk space is cheap. I want
to be able to look at the folder where I backed stuff up to,
right-click and do Properties, and have it tell me that it has the same
exact number of files and the number of bytes is identical to the
original folder. Then I feel comfortable that it's all there. Plus, if
I accidentally delete a file I can just go grab it from the backup
folder without having to untar it or run a restore program. I like to
KISS.

I know there are scripts, but I don't understand them either, or how to
modify them to suit my needs.

Thanks to all for the replies. I'll just keep struggling.

The real question is the trust you have for your users. If you don't 
trust them, don't give them sudo with any root privileges.

Run as uid 0 (root), a large percentage of command-line utilities can 
undermine a system. E.g., say you want to allow some users to run 
"less" so they can view log files or other protected configurations. 
Well, less can be used to launch an editor (press 'v' to try it 
yourself). So anyone with access to "less /etc/sudoers" will be able 
to edit the file!

File utils (cp, mv, and ln) or stream editors (awk, sed) are just as 
easily abused.

I'm not saying that a limited sudo set isn't a good idea. It can allow 
conscientious users to care for themselves *and* stay out of harm's 
way.

Start with the trust question, however, because any root access is a 
wide-open door for a malicious or too-inquisitive user.

if you own all the files, try simply "cp -a sourcedir destdir" (or do
it via sudo).

Scripts are just something that you would normally type a command
prompt that you don't want to type over and over again because
it is long or complicated.  The only thing is to mark them executable.

cp -r will not preserve permissions correctly.  Adding "--preserve=all" will
preserve everything, including security contexts.

Newer versions of sudo have a program and rule called 'sudoedit', which 
gets around the editor hole. It:
   1. Makes a copy of the file to edit in /tmp
   2. Runs $EDITOR on the file as the user
   3. Copies the file in place when the editor exits

OTOH there are still plenty of seemingly innocuous ways to get in, like 
"less".

I don't understand how these files cause Nautilus to "lock". I have 
never seen it do anything like that. Does it prompt you when it stops? 
There is something about dragging and dropping large quantities of files 
that always makes me a little nervous... I am clumsy enough that it 
seems far too easy to let go at the wrong moment and have things start 
going into totally the wrong place.

Since you're doing this between computers, are you using Nautilus to 
copy these files over a network?

Well, I guess you have to know that by default SOURCE can only be a 
file, not a directory and I guess the man page doesn't mention that 
directly. If the man page is too terse, though, you will find that such 
basic UNIX commands are documented in friendlier terms all over the web. 
Any college with UNIX or Linux will have some; try our own for example:

	http://www.cat.pdx.edu/unix/the-unix-file-system.html

In fact,  I would suggest if the topics covered on that page are 
unfamiliar to you that you spend some time reviewing it; it's pretty 
fundamental stuff. It is a testament to how well developed our desktop 
interfaces are that you have been able to get along this far without it, 
but it also explains many of the troubles you have. Spending time 
learning core UNIX stuff like this will make your life much easier.

rsync is indeed a complex tool; there are subtleties that are easy to 
miss, like the difference in including a trailing slash in the source 
directory or not. But it isn't especially buggy; aside from an 
occasional cryptic errors when rsyncing with remote servers that I have 
no access to (which, it seems, turns out to be the result of system 
load), every error I have run into has been of the PEBKAC sort.

Beware -- sudoedit doesn't seem to do any form of file locking, so the
last editor to exit gets the final say.

Does anyone know if/how sudo determines that a given comand is
actually the one that should be allowed? (Say I have root access to
ls, I add "." to my PATH, then create a copy of /bin/bash that's
called /tmp/ls, cd to /tmp and run 'sudo ls')

sudoers takes program arguments with full paths only:

     A Cmnd_List is a list of one or more commandnames, directories,
     and other aliases.  A commandname is a fully qualified filename
     which may include shell-style wildcards (see the Wildcards section
     below). [...] When you specify a directory in a a Cmnd_List, the
     user will be able to run any file within that directory (but not
     in any subdirectories therein).

it tries to be smart even when you're not, but really, you need to
specify fully qualified commands in /etc/sudoers to have any hope
of things working out the way you (as an access-restricting sysadmin)
would want.  except, apparently, in old debian.

the SECURITY NOTES section of the sudo man page will say the rest
better than i can.

My command of choice to copy files from one filesystem to another is  
the following:

'cd /this/is/the/source/directory; find . | cpio -pdm /this/is/the/

Others will mention theirs, I'm sure.

Just because I don't share their goals, does not mean I need to
denigrate their efforts.  If they have in fact gotten closer to their
goal, then they have made progress.  The fact that I have little or no
use for their efforts does not mean I should deny them.

If you're running a mailing list, you should get it to filter out anything
that's not text/plain anyway.  Then, all users, including the iPhone user,
will have the proper experience.

Configuration options for the display of messages are typical Apple,
i.e. the empty set. No way I can see to prefer text/plain over
text/html.

Mine displays HTML messages (mixed MIME w/ text/plain and text/html
alternative parts) via a Mailman list fine, FWIW.

That's kinda out of my hands.  I provide the platform, the representative for
the group (Astronomers in this case) sets the parameters to serve their

No.

With Apache 2.2 or lower, the best you can do is use
mod_rewrite to map from / or /group/ or (your choice)
to an appropriate directory based on REMOTE_USER
with a "Require valid-user".

In future versions, we hope to offer better options.

You can also use mod_macro to take the pain out of that.

Message-ID: <48138567.3000702@dslnorthwest.net>

Help.  I am trying to communicate with a CP-290, and X10 controller.  I did this
last year, so I know it is possible.  Here is a summary of the status.

Required: Baud rate : 600, Data bits : 8, Parity : None, Stop bits : 1

setserial says:
  setserial /dev/ttyS1 -a
/dev/ttyS1, Line 1, UART: 16550A, Port: 0x02f8, IRQ: 3
         Baud_base: 115200, close_delay: 50, divisor: 192
         closing_wait: 3000
         Flags: spd_cust skip_test

Running x10 -t says it will take about 10 seconds, but it runs forever. ^c to stop.

So the first thing I would like to determine and possibly change are the serial
parameters.  Is the use of spd_cust and divisor the way to set the baud down to
600?  How do I set the other parameters?

Running Kubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn)

Thanks for any pointers.

Are you attempting to communicate with the CP-290 through a program you
are writing, or are you using someone else's program?

I have a CP-290 that I use with a program called X10. I don't recall
where I got it, but it came as X10.tar.gz. The program takes care of
setting up the parameters, which are a bit strange. Apparently this
program has appropriate delays built into it's serial port
communications subroutine.

I remember reading something about the old DOS program that came with
the CP-290. It said that there was a special timing requirement that
would not work with Windows. I don't know why, but it appears to be
true. I was never able to get the included program working under Win95
or Win98.

X10, the Linux program, works fine. I had to set up a configuration file
and then run the usual make process. It's still available for download from:

ftp://ftp.foxharp.boston.ma.us/pub/pgf/x10/

The program I am using is x10 (lower case).  It is written by Aaron Hightower. 
You will note that I mentioned running x10 -t, the self-test option.  I have 
been assuming that setting up the serial is the problem.  I do not think that 
the x10 program is the problem.  It ran last year and the year before, after 
finding the correct serial port.  If I have the wrong serial port, it tells me 
it cannot communicate with the CP-290.

I am interested in your mention of a configuration file.  I assume that is for 
compiling, not for running?

Now that I pay attention when I look at it, the program I use is also
spelled in lower case.

Mine is a revision by Paul Fox of a program by Larry Campbell.

> You will note that I mentioned running x10 -t, the self-test option. 

Mine doesn't have that as an option. It has a similar one:

rsteff at Moonguide:~> x10 -h
Command error: Invalid command name
Usage:
<...>
x10 diagnostic              run interface self-test diagnostics
<...>

All of the options for my version start with x10, and are followed by a
word or words, but no dash.

Do you have the source code? Perhaps you could search it for what it
wants in the way of a serial port. I'm not a C programmer, but I can
sort of follow what's going on when I read the file that has the code to
access the serial port.

> I am interested in your mention of a configuration file.  I assume that is for

Yes. I run my with CRONTAB entries.

My file, x10config, contains the following:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# this file should contain x10 appliance aliases, one per line, as:
#   appliance-name  housecode  modulenumber
# for example:
#  mydesklamp	A	4
#  atticfan	B	3
#
# In addition, the devicename for the line the Powerhouse is attached to may
# be specified with:
#  TTY	/dev/tty00
# and the default housecode with:
#  HOUSECODE	A
# this is only used by the switches on the unit itself, and units
#  specified by number only on the command line.
#
LR-AcornLts	K 1
BR-GentsChest	K 3
LR-TableLmp	K 7
BR-PictureLmp	K 8
#
#
# Oregon City:
LATITUDE	45:34
LONGITUDE	-122.57
#
# set default housecode -- the one the switches will use
HOUSECODE	K
TTY		/dev/ttyX10
#TTY		annex:7002
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If I ever re-compile it I'll just use /dev/ttyS0 for TTY. I have to
re-create a sym link after every boot to get it to work. I finally
figured out how to do that with an entry in /etc/init.d/boot.local

# create a symlink for the X10 program
ln -s /dev/ttyS0 /dev/ttyX10

I suspect that is not particularly relevant to your program, but maybe
it will trigger a thought.

No source, and I cannot decipher it even if I had it.  I downloaded your program 
source, and found that it was Greek to me.

The docs for my program mention the symlink to set the serial port, as well as 
setting an environment variable X10_PORTNAME.  I chose the latter.  But here is 
what I get with various settings:


parents at R2D2:~$ X10_PORTNAME=/dev/ttys0
parents at R2D2:~$ x10 -t
Could not access serial port /dev/ttys0
Please set environment variable X10_PORTNAME to proper serial device
or else make the appropriate soft link as superuser.
parents at R2D2:~$ X10_PORTNAME=/dev/ttys1
parents at R2D2:~$ x10 -t
Could not access serial port /dev/ttys1
Please set environment variable X10_PORTNAME to proper serial device
or else make the appropriate soft link as superuser.
parents at R2D2:~$ X10_PORTNAME=/dev/ttyS0
parents at R2D2:~$ x10 -t
Performing self-test (This will take about 10 seconds)
Sorry, something is wrong
parents at R2D2:~$ X10_PORTNAME=/dev/ttyS1
parents at R2D2:~$ x10 -t
Performing self-test (This will take about 10 seconds)

This last required a ^c to force a termination.

I note that setserial tells me that only ttyS0 and ttyS1 are valid:

parents at R2D2:~$ setserial /dev/ttyS0 -a
/dev/ttyS0, Line 0, UART: 16550A, Port: 0x03f8, IRQ: 4
         Baud_base: 115200, close_delay: 50, divisor: 0
         closing_wait: 3000
         Flags: spd_normal skip_test

parents at R2D2:~$ setserial /dev/ttyS1 -a
/dev/ttyS1, Line 1, UART: 16550A, Port: 0x02f8, IRQ: 3
         Baud_base: 115200, close_delay: 50, divisor: 0
         closing_wait: 3000
         Flags: spd_normal skip_test

parents at R2D2:~$ setserial /dev/ttys0 -a
/dev/ttys0: Input/output error
parents at R2D2:~$ setserial /dev/ttys1 -a
/dev/ttys1: Input/output error
parents at R2D2:~$ setserial /dev/ttyS2 -a
/dev/ttyS2, Line 2, UART: unknown, Port: 0x03e8, IRQ: 4
         Baud_base: 115200, close_delay: 50, divisor: 0
         closing_wait: 3000
         Flags: spd_normal skip_test

Does this info give anybody here some ideas which might help me?

8.04 appears to use the latest Intel ipw2200 driver from the sourceforge

Is there a known issue here I missed the memo on?

Did you try switching between passcode/hex/ascii mode?

Do not be afraid to joust a giant just because some people insist on believing in windmills.

Ed,

Your article is a good one.
It refers to a scanning tool for alternate stream files that is no longer

Would you be aware of any modern day equivalents.

I had the same problem a while back and switching from a "shared key" to 
an "open key" allowed the box to connect.

You have to export the environment variable for processes other than the
current shell to see it:

$ X10_PORTNAME=/dev/ttyS0
$ export X10_PORTNAME

or just:

$ export X10_PORTNAME=/dev/ttyS0

I'm rebuilding my Gentoo Linux box (new motherboard, etc) and saw that 
the production date on my network card is 1998. Its a 3Com Cyclone TBase 
10/100 PCI. My question is will I see a difference if I get something 
newer to replace it?...Or is my typical Comcast (ugh!) connection such 
that a 10 year old NIC won't make any real difference and thus I should 
just save some money and keep what I have for now?
Thanks for any thoughts on this.

Comcast itself isn't a good reason to upgrade from the card, as the transfer
rates don't come close to utilizing the full speed of that card.  How much
internal transfer do you do at your location?  If you did a lot of
computer-to-computer or computer-to-nas as I do, a gigabit card might be
worth the cost.

It is more than adequate for Comcasts fastest speeds though, if that is your
concern.

That really was my only concern as I dont have
 any computer to computer or network stuff going on right now.
My only two concerns are:
1)Am I taking full advantage of my Comcast connection (such as it is)
2)Do NICs wear out over time and lose speed (like my old Linksys router 
did once...wheezing to a slow slow death...)

You answered the first for me. Thank you much!

Message-ID: <4816CD1D.8030008@gmail.com>

I'm looking for recommendations on where to purchase a SSL cert for our 
small business.

I bought one before through godaddy and I wasn't really impressed with 
the "chaining" antics of what you purchase.

Preferable this would be a "wildcard" cert that could be applied to any 
subdomain.

I'm looking for recommendations based on

1) price
2) quality of support
3) do no evil business ethics.


Thanks,

This is important to me as well.  I've used gandi.net as my DNS registrar since 
2000 and feel confident they do the right thing when it comes to handling domain 
suspensions.

I went to see if they offer SSL certificates.  The do not, but I can across this 
article from Sept of last year:

http://www.news.com/2100-1025_3-6155614.html

Some of the companies mentioned in this article provide SSL certs.  Put GoDaddy 
and Verisign at the bottom of your list and you should generally be ok.

I don't know about other's experiences, but I have had NICs wear out.
Generally they are cheaper manufacturers (generally corrosion on the pins).
It is rare though.

If you start noticing packet loss, try replacing the cable you are using, if
that doesn't work, inspect the RJ45 jack on the network card for any signs
of pin damage (either bent of corroded).

Does your new motherboard have an on-board NIC?  Most do now, and it
is likely a gigabit NIC.

Message-ID: <48173C8C.5040506@acm.org>

I haven't done any serious research but was hoping to get some ideas on 
what terms to use or applications to consider before going further.

BACKGROUND:

I use Cepstral's "Text To Speech" (TTS) engine to generate messages for 
use by Asterisk.  Though the engine and selected voice works very well 
there are still a few rough spots in speech generated.  Cepstrals TTS 
engine does support a mark-up language but I'm thinking there should be 
some application that would (automagically?) allow me to smooth the 
glitches out.

I've tried Audacity but didn't notice any option to do this.  Most 
probably I didn't recognize it for what it is.

Any suggestions of what to search for?


Thanks,
Rod

There are two issues here:

1. You don't mention what level of trust you want the certificate
    to inspire in your customers.

2. The number of independent certificate authorities (CAs) has
    dropped recently because VeriSign has been buying all its
    competitors.

If you just want a cert signed by a CA that has its root certificates 
in most browsers, RapidSSL.com is fine. You can get a single-host cert 
for $69 or a wilcard cert for $199.

RapidSSL certs are merely "domain control validated," however, meaning 
that all RapidSSL guarantees is that you're pretty likely to own the 
domain advertised in your cert. That's probably good enough for most 
uses, but you're the one who has to make the decision. Also, RapidSSL 
was purchased by VeriSign a couple years ago.

If you're dealing with customers with stricter needs, then you'll 
probably have to find a CA that does something resembling real due 
diligence to verify your identity. That probably means a 
VeriSign-branded certificate.

First I think you need to better define what you mean by "smooth". Are there
pitch problems? Cadence problems? Inflection problems? If Cepstrals supports
mark-up to adjust pronunciation I'd attack it from that direction, you're
likely to have much better results. Manipulating audio is definitely an art.
I doubt you will find anything that  will automagically do what you are
after, unless there are clear and well defined aberrations that are simple
to isolate. It doesn't sound like that's the case though.

Thanks for the clue-stick tap.  :-)  I listened to the files again and 
realized it was more a phone system issue.  Could be my home phone, cell 
phone or maybe even the Asterisk box is causing the problems.  Most of 
the choppy pieces were not so bad when played on my workstation.  I 
think I need to add some codes to slow sections down; especially in one 
sentence that where the word "leave" gets mashed down pretty bad.


Again thanks for the input.

I shouldn't be a problem, unless you want faster speeds for inside your
network.

Currently I am converting the home network to gigabit throughout.  Makes
pulling the mail from the internal mail server much faster.

Also keep in mind the wildcard cert from RapidSSL for $199 can only be tied to 
one key.  This is fine for IP-based virtualhosts, but is riskier for SSL 
services spread out over a bunch of servers.  A single server compromise and all 
your services are at risk.

Something happened and the scheduled PLUG speaker is not available.
Iwasn't worried s we had a back up speaker, but he has emergency to
deal with so we are without a speaker.

Would anyone like to fill in?  Maybe someone who has prepared
something for the Portland BarCamp (this Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday)?  If so, give me a call at 541 730-5285.  Please call as I'm
on the road today and may not be available by email.  If we don't get
a speaker, we will have a structured discussion of various OpenSource
topics.

Subject: [PLUG] Speech recognition on Linux
Message-ID: <20080430075350.GE31240@gate.kl-ic.com>


My wife is spending about $8000 a year on medical transcription, and
is hearing encouraging things about the proprietary program "Dragon
Naturally Speaking" (D.N.S.).  The medical version is $1200 (yikes).  
Sadly, there does not appear to be any Linux software in the same
league, though progress is being made and I expect things to get
much better in a year or two.

We run a nearly pure Linux shop, with a few Windoze tools running
under VMware.  I would rather not run any native Windows machines.

There are reports that D.N.S. can be cobbled into Wine, so we can
run it under Linux.  If anybody has experience with that, I would
like to hear about it.  We would also like to work out some kind
of sharing setup so she can use it at both her office and at home,
perhaps by moving sound data over the VPN link (60msec ping time
through Seattle) or by buying 2 copies ( 2*yikes !!!) and sharing
the config and training files over the network.  Of course, security
and patient confidentiality are paramount;  I doubt we could achieve
sufficient security with a Windows machine in the mix.

If you have knowledge of moving clean sound over that much latency,
please share it;  we would rather buy a single copy of D.N.S. 

BTW, the stories you hear about "rich doctors" are about as truthful
as the 1930's stories about "rich Jews".  Most doctors work long hours
for lower wages than most technical professionals.  Spending $2400
*hurts*.  Not as much as spending $8000/yr, granted, but there will
be staff costs associated with cleaning up the inevitable speech
recognition mistakes, so it may prove to be an expensive mistake.

I presume that you are feeding the audio in from output on a sound card?
Make sure the gain is not too high. If the bad parts tend to be at louder
points or "s" or "t" sounds in the speech, your telephony card might be
clipping due to too high volume. Does your analog interface card do any sort
of audio processing in hardware? If so, try turning that on/off and see if
it makes any difference. Finally, make sure whatever voice settings you are
using are not producing any weird high or low-pitched tones. Phone systems
are really only meant to carry frequencies found in normal speech, and
adding frequencies outside of that range can sound really awful.

Actually they are generated from text files to .wav (8kHz) files then 
converted to .gsm.  I understand there are some setting I can tweak in 
Asterisk or during the conversion but haven't had a chance to get back 
to that.

I do want to experiment with Audacity and see what I can do when 
recording so these suggestions will help.  On the Asterisk box I'd 
prefer my messages in my voice but that requires a bit more patience 
than typing in the text, converting, listening and then fiddling with 
the text and repeat.

Back when I was doing a ham radio project I found the AT&T natural voices
program.   They have a demo page that you can enter stuff and download
the audio.  It does pretty well.

If running in a VM is an option, then maybe you could put it in its own
VM and move it back and forth on its own USB stick/drive, so you have to
pay for only one license. You could encrypt the drive to protect the
data and remove NICs from the VM so it is isolated from the rest of the
world. Getting data in and out of it then becomes an exercise in local
storage manipulation.

Hello:
I often have programs that operate a server and one or more clients on a

move the program to another computer, I need to change my IP address 
data file. I would like to modify my program to get the IP address of 
it's host not knowing the host name. Any ideas?

You should be able to parse it from the stdout of /sbin/ifconfig. I
don't have a system with 2 NIC's, so I don't know how much complexity
that would introduce (in the event that's a concern for you).

Or from /sbin/ip, e.g.,

   ip addr show eth0 | awk '/inet / {print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1

If you want something that works most of the time then just grab the IP
address of eth0 from "ifconfig eth0" output. If you want something that
works all of the time, well, that can be surprisingly tricky, say if
there is no eth0 or if it's not configured. And even if eth0 is present
and configured, it may have been intended that eth1 have the primary
IP address for the host?

This topic came up on the kernel list a couple years ago and it turns
out there is no universal answer to knowing which IP address of possibly
several is meant to be primary IP address for a host.

My understanding of your question is:

* You have an application running in a client-server model
* The server component is running on one server machine
* Client components are running on any number of workstations
* You want to be able to move the application's server component around to
different machines at will
* You want the clients to learn on which machine the server is running
automatically

I would use DNS to accomplish this. I would create a DNS hostname
specifically for the program, and set its A record to the IP of the current
server machine. Then just have the clients connect to the hostname, and it
will use the workstation's DNS resolver to look up the IP on demand.

Another way of doing this would be to use a network broadcast request. The
client would send a request to the network broadcast address, and the server
would pick up on the message and respond with its IP. The client would then
establish its application protocol connection using this IP.

Most languages should have the gethostent() suite of functions.  You can
look at `man 3 gethostent` for a quick look.  Most languages just access
the C library to do this (I know Perl does) and wraps it in their
specific style.

Even better would be to choose the interface that is the default
gateway:

ip route ls|awk '/^default/ {print $5}'|xargs ip addr show|awk '/inet / {print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1

Is there some reason you want the server piece to bind to a specific
IP?  Most languages/network libraries will allow you to either bind to
all IPs or bind to "0.0.0.0" which will cause the server to listen on
all interfaces/all IPs.  If you're worried about security you can then
use iptables to block incoming requests to IPs you don't want to
service, but it sounds like you are running this on a local network so
it wouldn't be an issue anyway.

Still nothing.  I am going to try a windows program just in case my memory of 
x10 working last year is faulty.

Well, it turns out the problem IS in the Linux program (or the system).  I was 
able to communicate with the CP290 from the Windows program.  The windows 
program is also called X10 (no surprise) v. 1.31 by D. Huras.

I would still like to get Linux to do this job.

I am confused.  The program you cite seems to be for another controller,
quote:

"x10 is a little program for hacking a BSR X10 "Powerhouse" home
control device."

I can find no references to the CP290 and the BSR X10 being the same.  Do you 
know differently?

It must be a marketing thing. The label on the back of my CP-290 says:

------------------------------
X10 Powerhouse
RS-232 Computer Interface
Model Number CP 290
------------------------------

Down near the bottom of the label it says:

------------------------------
FCC ID B4S5WF CP290
Made in Hong Kong
------------------------------

------------------------------
X10 (USA) Inc.
Northvale, NJ 07647
------------------------------

My guess is that the CP290 came from more than one vendor selling X10
compatible gear.

                             Short Topic Discussion

     For the first time in a long time, we do not have a scheduled
     speaker this month - unless someone volunteers at the last minute.

     Instead, we plan to have a series of short discussions and "show
     and tell" topics by anyone wanting to speak for 5 or 10 minutes.
     It should also be a good chance to ask questions and get people
     opinions about some topic.

     *******************************************************************

         Agenda:

             7:00 - 7:30  Business
                  We will discuss the status of our ongoing projects
                  including PLUG's monthly Advanced Topics meetings,
                  PLUG's monthly hands on clinics, PLUG for Education,
                  etc.

             7:30 - 8:30  Presentation

                  See above

             9:00 - ...  Beer
                                 Jax Bar And Restaurant
                                 826 SW 2nd Avenue
                                 Portland
                                 (Note:  We no longer use the Lucky Lab.)

         P.S.  The Mid Willamette Valley Linux Users Group meets
               every month.  They are currently meeting at 6:00 PM
               on the third Wednesday of the month at the Corvallis
               Chamber of Commerce in Corvallis.
               As of May 2008, the Mid Willamette Valley Linux Users
               Group was under reconstruction.  Once this is done
               see http://www.lug.corvallis.or.us/ for details.

         P.S.  The Eugene Linux Users Group meets several times a month.
               See http://www.euglug.org for details.

If Nina is found alive...  

I'm ashamed of the jurors, there doesn't seem to be any solid 
evidence to prove that Nina died let alone that there was a 
murder.  The whole thing stinks.

I guess the moral of the trial is, don't act guilty even if 
all the evidence against you is circumstantial.  Hans shouldn't 
have admitted to evading the police.  I will say, it's dangerous
to speak on your own behalf in a court room because it's easy to
make a bad impression.

25 years for a murder case where there is no body and no murder
weapon seems extreme to say the least.  Statutes that allow
murder convictions on circumstantial evidence alone should be 
revised.  What kind of jury convicts based solely on it's
collective opinion of someone with no hard evidence to back 
that opinion up?  I hope that Hans will file for an appeal.

It's hard to believe reading the linked to site that this is
for real.
