Subject: [PLUG] Re-establishing Working POP3
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0902010739510.7985@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Since fixing my server problems my wife can no longer download her
incoming mail from the server's /var/spool/mail/<username> to her
Xubuntu-running laptop. I need to fix this for her.

   I've had qpopper4.0.5 installed, but the version is up to 4.0.16 so I
might as well build, install, and reconfigure the latest version. Reading
the Qualcomm information page and the configure options, I know that I want
to --enable-specialauth because we use /etc/shadow passwords here. I'm not
so sure about the other options and would appreciate advice on these. For
example, do I need to explicitly include --with-openssl=/usr/bin/openssl or
is that found automatically?

   The mail travels via radio from the server to her laptop. I'm not overly
concerned about someone snatching the signals for nefarious purposes, but I
ought to make the transfer as secure as possible. This includes changing
/etc/mail/qpopper.config to specify clear text handling as 'tls' or 'ssl'
rather than the default.

   Before I preceed further, please offer your suggestions to configure the
build, tune the .config file, and get it going once again so she can
retrieve her mail.

   All fixed. I configured, built, and installed qpopper4.0.16, then
uncommented the pop3 service in /etc/inetd.conf and it works (as long as all
directories in the path are correctly spelled.)

   Now to find the Xubuntu repositories and upgrade her machine. I suppose I
should not do this remotely while she's working on it, eh? :-)

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0902010940390.5783@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   My reading of the Xubuntu web site is that all the steps for a debian-type
release upgrade are done out of sight by the GUI. That is, for the installed
7.04 distribution there is no need to manually find the 8.10 repositories
then run the sequence of 'apt-get update,' 'apt-get upgrade,' 'apt-get
dist-upgrade.' Have I read this correctly?

   If I have, is is also correct that the upgrade can be done in the
background? Or, is it better to have no user activity during the process.

TIA,

Rich

Bruce,

   This surprises me. Debian has the reputation of smooth, trouble-free
upgrades and the Ubuntus are intended for the geek-phobic public.

   I am not following what you're telling me. You do the complete install in
/home? I can copy her /home directory to a USB flash drive for restoration.
(Until I learn how to enable ssh on that host I cannot access it remotely
and use rsync to copy her /home directory to the server for backup.

   Oh, goody! More time under the hood working as a linux mechanic getting
the darn vehicles running right again. Sigh. :-)

   OK.

one of my favorite 'this file is broken but almost ok' tricks is to
convert it to itself.   i usually use convert(1) since it handles most
of the files (save word docs) that arrive broken.  ghostscript often
does the trick for ps files when convert won't handle em (which is
rare but has happened to me occasionally).

resaving in the gimp is the same sort of trick.

Rich,

Let me try to answer this...

In my experience, upgrading has not gone well.  It usually leaves 
different things broken.  I have taken to using a /home partition and 
installing the newer version (do not put a check mark in the format box 
of /home).  That said, others have used the upgrade process with no flaws.

I would do the upgrade/install when she didn't need the computer for 
several hours in case you need to do some tweaking on the box.  It can 
probably be done in the background as you have suggested, up until the 
time for a computer restart for the new kernel.  You are correct on the 
use of the GUI.  It will find the proper repositories and do it's thing 
in the background.  I have never tried doing an install/upgrade while 
using the computer for something else.

Keep us posted...inquiring minds want to know...

Bruce

Subject: [PLUG] Troubleshooting Slow Laptop
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0902011302520.5783@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I'm about to upgrade Xubuntu on my wife's Toshiba Techra 8000 -- as soon
as I finish backing up her ~/ to a USB flash drive. While this is taking
place, I want to ask for ideas on what might be causing this laptop to be
working very slowly.

   The battery is pretty well shot and I need to buy a replacement (any local
source?), so it runs on the A/C all the time. I checked the BIOS settings
and it shows battery power mode on Full Power, but I don't see any setting
for CPU speed. (Didn't find anything about it in the manual, either.)

   She complains that web pages take minutes to load, and I am not convinced
that it's the wireless connection to the router that's at fault. More
important is that when she types in AbiWord the text does not display
immediately, but will slowly display (character-by-character) when she takes
her hands off the keyboard.

   I suspect both issues are related to mis-configuration somewhere, not
inherent in the hardware or it's WiFi connection to the server or router.
But, I'm not sufficiently proficient in portables to know where to start
looking. Could this be related to a non-functional battery?

Thanks,

Rich

Try running top and see what is eating the cpu time.  My suspicion is
Firefox, which I need to restart occasionally, or at least close the
offending page whose JavaScript has run amok.

   Here's more information. I discovered the system monitor and I'm looking
at the GUI display of resource use. The CPU started at 100% for several
seconds, then dropped near zero. Now it's about 47% with nothing running but
the monitor. 'top' on this machine shows CPU use near zero. Wonder what's
consuming processor cycles.

   In reply to Bill, it's the system monitor! I closed that, opened a virtual
console, and ran top. It showed 0.7-1.0%. Then I started the GUI system
monitor and the usage shot up to 43+%. Sheesh!

Bill,

   See my updates. Nothing running but the system monitor, and that's eating
almost half the available cycles!

   After the dist-upgrade I'll check usage again ... with top, not the system
monitor!

Thanks,

All monitors modify the system they are monitoring, but this is pretty
extreme. Does it explain the initial page loading problem though?

Bill,

   I doubt it. I'll see how it does after the upgrade is done (we're stuck on
getting file #1 of 265 files.)

  I must have said that badly.  When I got tired of the upgrade process, I made a /home partition and use that instead of the default /home directory.  During the install process, the partitioning section, I choose manual, then tell it where to install the root directory /, then I point it to the /home partition in the list (using the check box, and the drop down list to use it as /home), making sure not to tick the format box.  This process leaves me not having to do any special backup of the /home directory.  All warnings about data loss apply here.

  There are others here that can guide you through the SSH process.  IIRC, you need to install SSH Server (SSH is installed by default) and add the individual IP addresses to the /etc/hosts file.  It will give you the dire warning the first time you log in, and you can then verify that you really want to do that.

  Hope this helps.

I wondered about that, just before getting the link to a "good" version 
of the image. It may be why one scaling of the image I did worked and 
others did not. Unfortunately, I don't remember what I did differently.

The maximum memory on a Tecra is 256MB .   Xubuntu is designed for
small memories (192MB min, >256MB recommended) , but the applications
themselves have bloated over the years.  There are lighter browsers,
but you may have to forgo Flash and Java and movies and such, and
a lot of web pages won't render correctly.  If automated updates are
running at the same time as the desktop and browser, the machine will
be glacially slow.

Run "free" from the command line.  On my laptop, with 2GB of memory 
and running an RHEL5 clone, the results are:

             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       2075132    1481864     593268          0     473388     476564
-/+ buffers/cache:     531912    1543220
Swap:      2072376        416    2071960

The important number is 531912 KB - that means that the program code
itself uses more than half a GB.  The buffers and cache speed things
up, a lot.  If I was trying to fit all of that into 256MB, more than
half the program code would be continuously swapping on and off of
disk, there would be no cache, and buffers would be erased almost as
soon as they were used.  Combined with a slow processor, (the Tecra
8000s range from 233MHz to 400MHz) things slow to a crawl.

You can estimate machine speed by running "dmesg | grep BogoMIPS"
The number should be larger than the rated clock speed of your
machine.  On the 500MHz Geode in my ALIX firewall, I see:

Calibrating delay using timer specific routine.. 997.10 BogoMIPS (lpj=498553)

That is a crude speed estimate, but if the number is smaller than the
MHz rating of your processor, you've got configuration trouble.  You
may need to replace the BIOS battery to remember faster settings.

You might be able to add more memory than the manufacturer recommends. 
The maximum memory for my Thinkpad T30 is supposedly 2x512MB, but I am
running fine with 2x1024MB.  Check around on the web and see if anyone
else is successfully running with larger-than-recommended memory on their
Tecra 8000 .  That will depend on BIOS level and version numbers.

The software world keeps moving on, so at some point you will want 
newer hardware.  Ebay sells used 2GHz laptops for $300 or less.  You
can use the old Tecra as a router/firewall, without X or graphics. 
However, a $200 single board computer like my ALIX will do the same
task with 10% of the electricity, so the Tecra may be too old for even
that.  You should be proud, though, that you kept that old beast
running for years after most Windoze users would have gone into debt
buying faster and faster machines to do the same simple tasks.

Good luck!

   Ah, so. I always have /home as a separate partition on all my systems.
Regardless, I tarred and gzipped her 1.3G /home to a 200+M tarball that
easily fit on the thumb drive.

   When her laptop ran Slackware I had ssh set up on that, too. I've not
futzed with it since switching to Xubuntu so I need to figure out where to
tell the system to start sshd upon boot and I'll copy the /etc/hosts file to
the system and configure /etc/ssh/ssh.conf and /etc/ssh/sshd.conf.

Keith,

   I suspected limited memory was a problem, even with Xfce.

   I'll see if Opera consumes fewer resources. I'm not familiar with others,
but dillo is still not quite there, or so I've read recently.

   No. Updates are never done automatically.

   Good thought. I'll look into it.

   Yeah, that has to wait, however. I also have a working ThinkPad 600E and a
Toshiba Portege 3025CT. Both vintage 1999.

Hmmm ... only 256 MB??

1. There are lighter desktops than even XFCE4 if you are willing to
forgo some eye candy. I've had very good luck with WindowMaker. It's a
bit tricky to get set up, but once you do, you can customize it to
just about any work flow. One of these days I'm going to try LXDE,
which has a pretty good reputation for lightness.

2. I did some memory size testing on browsers the other day. Firefox
is the largest in real and virtual memory. Seamonkey had the smallest
RSS and Opera had the smallest VSZ. My recommendation is to go with
Seamonkey because it has both a browser and an email client that's
pretty close to Thunderbird, and it's open source. Incidentally, the
Debian "unbranded" version of Seamonkey is called "iceape". The
unbranded version may be lighter weight than the official branded
Mozilla version, but I haven't tested that.

3. I haven't done much with either AbiWord or Gnumeric since
OpenOffice 3 came out. I don't know about the Ubuntu builds, but the
openSUSE builds of OO 3 seem to have finally wrung out a lot of the
performance issues. I haven't taken back *all* the nasty things I said
about OO, but at least they've cleaned up their act a bit.

4. When you're looking for memory hogs, "pmap -d" is your friend. For
some details, there's a great article at
http://lwn.net/Articles/230975/

5. IIRC "evince" uses less RAM than Acrobat Reader for reading PDFs.

   I ran Xfce on my Toshiba Portege with a full load of 96M RAM. :-) Of
course, that was an earlier version of Xfce before all the eye candy and
superfluous (IMO) junk.

   Good advice. I'll look at WM, fluxbox, or the others.

   OK. If they look and feel close enough to Firefox and Thunderchicken she
may adjust to them. Since seamonkey/iceape/whatever is also a Mozilla
product I'm surprised it takes fewer resouces than the individual apps.

   She needs nothing other than a writing tool. That's why I moved her from
OO.o to AbiWord.

IceWM is very light and surprisingly functional. However, I have never
been able to figure out how to get a font big enough to read with it, so
I gave up on it. Actually, when you get used to it, "twm" isn't as bad
as you might think. :)

The only place I've found Seamonkey inferior to Firefox as a browser is
that Seamonkey doesn't handle RSS feeds. There may be an add-on for
that. I didn't really do a full comparison of the Seamonkey email client
with Thunderbird, but the look and feel was substantially the same.

I've had some dependency issues with "xpdf". Then again, I have a big
enough machine to run Acrobat Reader, so I usually use that.

Bruce,

   The first time I started the upgrade it went catatonic on me. So after an
hour or so I cancelled the attempt (which took a while, too), power cycled
the LinkSys wireless access point (it gets constipated and needs to be
cleaned out sporatically), and started again.

   This time it's going much faster. All 265 packages came across the
airwaves and they're being installed now; about 5 minutes remaining.

   So, it looks like a clean upgrade from 8.04 to 8.10.

   Now, if someone can advise me on making her firefox bookmarks and her
thunderchicken mail boxes visible to seamonkey/iceape (they do need better
names for these things), I'll be able to get her going again.

   First step is to try the combined web browser/MUA and see how that does.
Next is to try different window managers/virtual desktop managers and see
how that helps.

   All the advice is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Rich

If Xubuntu doesn't fix your memory consumption issues, then try one of 
the extremely small Linux distros like DSL (Damn Small Linux) or 
Knoppix.  DSL has a 50MB install image and still includes a browser.

Michael,

   Xfce has always been light on resources. I can turn off all the applets
that aren't used. I don't want to start with another distribution because
she's used to this one (after running Slackware on the ThinkPad) and that's
enough change for a while. When I learn how to migrate her bookmarks from
Firefox to SeaMonkey, and her mail files, too, that's a good start. About
the only applications she uses are the MUA, Web browser, a writing tool
(AbiWord currently), and jpilot. That and the wm should fit comfortably in
256M of RAM.

My .02, try LXDE.  I've installed it on an old POS (Point of Sale, not the
other one!) computer that choked on xfce and xubuntu.  LXDE and Arch, but
I'm sure it would run just as smooth on a Debain backend.  It runs smooth as
silk and will actually stream youtube.  I'm thinking its about 800Mhz and
512Mb of ram.  LXDE is not the prettiest, but plenty functional.

figure out what the current directory is if I get say the chdir command

   Looking at the Tecra manual I learn that it has two DIMM slots, and each
one can hold a stick of 160M, 192M, or 256M. Adding a second DIMM of the
largest size will go a _long_ way to making it a more responsive system.

Yeah ... I'm running essentially a full openSUSE 11.1 / Gnome stack on
my 512 MB Compaq Presario. I did have to de-install Beagle to get it to
work, but just about everything else on the Gnome LiveCD is still there.

Message-ID: <49873028.1070504@pacifier.com>

My brother is in Iraq with a laptop. The laptop dual-boots Windoze / 
Linux Mint (don't remember which  Linux Mint version, probably 4 or 5). 
He is sick of Windoze, but doesn't have enough knowledge to get his 
Linux Mint on the WiFi.

When running Windoze, his laptop "just finds" the WiFi connection. He 
then clicks on an icon that appears on his desktop, enters his credit 
card information and purchases access for a week / month etc.  For the 
period that he has purchased, thereafter, he just clicks on the icon and 
is then able to start up his browser etc.

Where would be a good place for him to start?
Or is there one?

Wayne

I must keep both OpenOffice.org 2.4.1 (that came with Intrepid) and 3.0
installed. I want 3.0 to be the default version. I have tried
everything, but unless I open the file from within OOo 3.0 it will open
in 2.4.1. Right now I am explaining my desires to Firefox. I am using
three languages.

I can find an OOo Writer document with Nautilus and click on "Other" to
get a list of applications. Then I can select OOo Writer 3.0 and it
will open in 3.0. And 3.0 will be the default for that specific
document in the future. But I cannot figure out how to set Writer 3.0
to be the default for *all* .doc and .odt documents.

I have similar problems with other document types. Does anyone know
where the secret panel is to set the default application for document
types?

Great idea. Embarassed that I didn't already have that before I posted.
Will get email off to him today. He is not going to know how to do this 
and I am not sure how I will get the output into an email from his 
Windoze machine.

Could have him mount his Windoze partition and save the output of lspci to a
file in his Windoze partition. Could also see if he has a USB flash 
drive. Might have an answer tomorrow - might not. I'll se if he can do a 
couple of these things.

Wayne,

   Also, direct him to determine what drivers and wireless tools are already
installed on the machine. Is the wireless device built in, a pcmcia or card
services card, or usb device? Any and all information will help us advise
you.

It might be a problem at the wifi driver level as you and Rich are
discussing, but it might just be at the security level.
Most of these For Pay Wifi systems have to allow you to connect
without any wep/wap security. But they don't let you access the net
without paying, so they give you routing and nameserver information
that only allows you to connect to their access point. Then when you
open up a browser and try to go to some website you get redirected to
their website where they collect their toll and then they route you
out to the internet. It is called a captive portal.  Has he just tried
opening a browser and going to a website. As for knowing if it is a
driver problem, has he ever successfully connected to other access
points from the Linux side?

Are you using Ubuntu (GNOME) or Kubuntu (KDE)?
If it is GNOME then try this.

Open the file manager (Nautilus), go to any document of the type you
want to change (.doc), right click on it.
Go down to Properties.  In the new window that opens, there should be
a tab along the top that says "Open With".  In there it should have
listed the currently registered applications that can open that type
of document.  Just pick the one you want and close the window.

If it is KDE then let one of the KDE gurus come forward... ;)

Is there a particular reason you need both OOo 2.4.1 and OOo 3?  OOo 3
should be backwards compatible with 2.4.1.

I am using Gnome, Intrepid x86_64. However, I have already done that
and it makes the choice stick only for the document that is selected.
Opening any other document of the same type (e.g., .odt) causes it to
open in OOo 2.4.1.

And the most annoying part is when someone sends me a .doc file in an
e-mail (web-based) or I find one on a website. There seems to be no way
to tell Firefox that it should use 3.0.

Part of the problem is that 2.4.1 came with Intrepid, and I installed
3.0 with the .deb file downloaded from OOo. You can just add the 3.0
repository in Synaptic and install 3.0 that way, but if you do it will
overwrite 2.4.1. The advantage is that if you let it overwrite 2.4.1
you will get all the launch buttons and Gnome integration. That is what
I am missing. I need to create the integration manually, but I can't
figure out how. Somewhere there must be a config file of some sort.

Because 3.0 is not terribly stable on Intrepid x86_64. And I utterly
depend on OOo for school. I am not ready to commit to 3.0 completely.

If it's a *really* simple shell, you don't care.  You just
pass the argument to cd to the chdir() call, and you're done.

chdir("..") does the right thing to the OS.  Early shells never cared where
they were.

Subject: [PLUG] Convert LVM partition(s)?
Message-ID: <49878C40.2090609@cyber-office.net>

It's a really long and embarrassing story so I'll cut to the chase.

Is there anyway to convert a drive that was part of a LVM Group to a 
simple partition?

I have two SATA drives that were part of a LVM Group that I'm hoping to 
pull the data off of.  I have a SATA to USB adapter and can see the 
drive but mount doesn't work as it wants me to specify the partition 
type.  Auto doesn't work.

    fdisk -l /dev/sda

reports Linux LVM.

Searched via Google but mostly found boot from CD in rescue mode as a 
solution.  I'm trying to kludge a system together to do this but it just 
seems wrong to have to do this.


Thanks for any help or pointers,
Rod

If you mean you want access it without using LVM, the answer is 
probably no.

Do you know how the logical volumes were laid out?  Do you have a 
backup of the LVM metadata?  On a Redhat system this is stored under 
/etc/lvm.  I think the rescue CD is your best bet.  I suggest you 
review the LVM HOWTO and subscribe to the LVM mailing list.  People on 
the list may be able to help you recover your data.

My thoughts too so I finally gave up on that idea and built the system.

Well it was a disaster case.  No preparation on my part at all ... so no 
I don't know any of this but ... I found a page that explained how to 
get to the data using the rescue mode and it is working.

Never had to do too much with LVM before as it has always just worked 
out of the box.  Time to do the research.

Does the Edit -> Preferences -> Applications firefox dialog not work?
You should be able to set your preferences in there for the various
office formats.

It does take a moment or two for that dialog to populate the content
types -- it may appear empty initially.

Since he's demonstrated twice now he's incapable of un-subscribing 
himself (for whatever reason), can someone just do it for him? Maybe 
Ultamix's default mail client removes the unsubscribe footers from list

The hostility is probably justified.
He would have gotten the standard monthly email with unsubscribe
instructions
 the same day as the email he responded to with the Unsubscribe request.
People with such room temp IQs should not be Admins.

Randal

The hostility is probably justified.
He would have gotten the standard monthly email with unsubscribe
instructions
 the same day as the email he responded to with the Unsubscribe request.
People with such room temp IQs should not be Admins.

It does indeed display the default application. Unfortunately, for .odt
document types it unhelpfully lists "OpenOffice Writer" without saying
what version. However, since it sends them to 2.4.1 we can assume that
"OpenOffice Writer" means 2.4.1. There is an option to choose "Other,"
but when you click on it all you get is a browser window to your home
folder, not a list of installed applications. 

I know the command to launch Writer 3.0 is
"/opt/openoffice.org3/program/soffice" (found by looking at the
properties of the launch button). However, in that folder there is a
"soffice" file and a "soffice.bin" file. The former appears to be a
text document. I tried them both, but neither work. For example, having
selected "soffice.bin" the window with the list of applications says
"Use soffice.bin." It does not maintain the path, and there is another
"soffice.bin" on my computer for 2.4.1. Guess which one it chooses?

Worse, the majority of text documents that are sent to me are in MS
Word format. The application list window does not show such a program.
Oddly, it does show "Word template document." I can't find any way to
add an application type for "Word document" to the window. Yet somehow
it must have .doc somewhere inside it's little electronic heart,
because when I click on a .doc file in a web page it reliably launches
Writer 2.4.1.

I am not sure we should - his "signature" paragraph says that is

perhaps a better move for having both versions around is downloading a
new copy of the stable version and also installing it in /opt (with a
different subdirectory than v3) and removing the system version.  then
you can symlink whatever you want onto the default $PATH.

i suppose an easier option would be to put /opt/whatever first in your
personal $PATH (as set before xwin startup/login).  i don't use
"desktop environments" so i don't know whether gnome respects that,
but it sure ought to, IMNSHO.

This will answer all your questions.  In much the same
unfortunate way that the defaults answer your needs.  :-/

                                PRESENTATION

                         Intro to Digital Forensics
                    (aka Groveling Through File Systems)


                                     by

                                Hal Pomeranz
                            Deer Run Associates

 While it may not be as sexy as they make it look on TV, there are a
 number of powerful Open Source tools available for analyzing file
 systems and recovering data-- even data that may have been deleted by
 the attacker. This talk will start with an overview of the standard
 Unix file system architecture and discuss tools for imaging file
 systems, suggest a few useful tools and idioms for finding clues in
 your images, and cover how to discover "interesting" data from deleted
 files and re-assemble that data into an actual file image.

 Hal Pomeranz is the founder and technical lead of Deer Run Associates,
 and has been active in the system and network management/security
 field for over twenty years. As a senior member of the Faculty for the
 SANS Institute, Hal developed the SANS "Step-by-Step" course model and
 currently serves as the track coordinator and primary instructor for
 the SANS/GIAC Linux/Unix Security Certification track (GCUX). In 2001
 he was given the SAGE Outstanding Achievement Award for his teaching
 and leadership in the field of System Administration.

                 We will discuss the status of our ongoing projects
                 including PLUG's monthly Advanced Topics meetings,
                 PLUG's monthly hands on clinics, PLUG for Education,
                 etc.

        P.S.  The Mid Willamette Valley Linux Users Group meets
              every month.  They are currently meeting at 6:00 PM
              on the third Wednesday of the month at the Corvallis
              Chamber of Commerce in Corvallis.
              As of May 2008, the Mid Willamette Valley Linux Users
              Group was under reconstruction.  Once this is done
              see http://www.lug.corvallis.or.us/ for details.

        P.S.  The Eugene Linux Users Group meets several times a month.
              See http://www.euglug.org for details.

I forgot about Jax going away when I wrote the meeting announcement.

It looks like we will discuss locations for the after event at the
general meeting.
I will try to come up early and scout out a couple places, but it is good that
other people seem to be checking around as I don't have much time for this;
and if some which way PLUG, and POSSE, and others can coordinate our
needs our bargaining position is much stronger.

Sorry, old information!

Afters will NOT be at Jax - their landlord took away the room
we've been using.  The tentative plan is to go to one of two
places in southeast Portland:

Roots Organic Brewing 1520 SE 7th, Portland  503-235-7668
(half a block south of Hawthorne)

Lucky Labrador 915 SE Hawthorne Blvd, Portland  503-236-3555

These are 3 blocks apart, and Roots has a meeting area that we
hope to snag (for free) for our Advanced Topics meeting.  I
propose we try out Roots, then walk to the Lab if Roots is not
suitable.

It is better to choose the approximate location now, so people
can plan transit.

More discussion on the main plug list ( plug at lists.pdxlinux.org )
and at the meeting itself, please.

Keith

   There are issues with Adobe's Flash 10 and Firefox-3.0.5 and I cannot get
it to work here. I needed it for a java/web application I want to run.

   My Google search turned up a hit where the respondent told the original
poster to look for general.useragent in about:config, and reset any found.
There is no such animal in my installation.

   Has anyone here successfully installed flash-10 in firefox-3.0.5? If so,
please tell me how you did it.

TIA,

Rich

   OK. Took a different route to installing the library (the SlackBuild
script) and it worked.

   This application (snapCRM) is written in java and uses a BUI that requires
flash! Groan! But, if it works, what the heck, eh?

Does Ubuntu use the Debian alternatives system, or did they strip that
out?  If you installed OO.org 3.0 with a .deb, then it might show up
in the alternatives system, and you could indicate there that you want
v3.0 to be the default.  But if Ubuntu doesn't include the
alternatives system, that won't be possible.

Sometimes Debian's alternatives system fights with your DE/WM's own
settings for preferred applications.  This can be a source of
frustration to newer users who don't know about the alternatives
system and wonder why their choices aren't sticking.  It certainly was
to me.  But once you get the hang of it, it's a pretty good method of
managing default apps across a wide range of categories -- browsers,
editors, mail clients, viewers, etc.

Try 'man update-alternatives' and see if anything happens.

Got an email response from Sarah at Roots this afternoon, with apologies for
the slow response.  Keith had warned me that communications might be fraught
with
phone/email tag.

PLUG is penciled in for the next meeting.  I told her Third Wednesday, which
would be
the 18th in this case, and estimated 7-9.  If that's wrong, or any
adjustments are needed, let me know asap.  I didn't mention afters, she
didn't mention money, but I
can't imagine that they would refuse to sell us food and beers.  The
aforementioned
'minors admitted' notice says 9:30pm is the cutoff.  The web page,
   http://rootsorganicbrewing.com/blog/about
has a menu link.

I think the afters at roots suggestion is still a good idea.

   On my desktop server/workstation any time I open a link that requires a
media connection (flash, mplayer, xgine) I get a black window with a +x in
the upper right corner. Clicking on the x opens the display. On my notebook,
running the same version of firefox, the display opens directly.

   This has been the case for several years and I'm curious why the desktop
does not respond properly. It's not a critical issue but a minor annoyance
I'd like to eliminate if I can.

Sounds like some sort of adblock-like plugin.

   Huh! That didn't occur to me, Quentin. Wonder why the adblocker would
affect the immediate display of video. But, you may have hit the source
since I've never gotten around to installing the adblock extension on my
notebook.

Thanks,

Yep.  I purposefully run "flash block", which shows me a right-oriented
triangle or a script "f".  I have to click on it to see any flash media.
 I'd be grateful for something that blocked all the plugins so
gracefully ... especially java applets.

That looks great.  The POSSE group meets from 5 to 7 that
same Wednesday, formerly at Jax.  I will pass this along
to them, and perhaps they will also contact Sarah about
using the room.

One concern:  On their website, they mention comedy nights
on first and third wednesday.  Sounds like a potential
conflict.

> I think the afters at roots suggestion is still a good idea.

I do too.  We will have a discussion during the Thursday
general meeting, but unless I hear strong objections, I
plan to be at Roots after 9pm.

Three cheers for Tony!  Thursday night, his meal and beer
are on me, but I will step aside on subsequent nights if
anyone else offers to feed the gentleman.

Subject: [PLUG] Saving terminal commands
Message-ID: <20090204091036.92a0f64d.johnxj@comcast.net>

I'm more a GUI kinda guy, but there are certain commands that I use
repeatedly in the terminal. For example, I use cdparanoia and lame to
rip and encode CDs from my collection. But sometimes I don't use those
commands for several months. I have the commands saved in an OOo Writer
document, and I can use the arrow keys to go back in the terminal
window, but there must be a faster way. After several months of not
using a command the arrow keys require 40-50 strokes to get back to the
command I want. And launching OOo and copying and pasting from it into
the terminal is also time consuming.

I note that the Gnome terminal allows me to open new tabs, and I do
that a lot when working on something. It would be really nice if I
could save a tab that has the specific commands for a particular
activity. Maybe there is a better terminal than the Gnome terminal?
Maybe there are some other commands besides the arrows that I could
use? I'm looking for suggestions.

there are a thousand options here.  a couple that come to mind:

I'm going to assume that you're using bash.

You can hit Ctrl-R to search backwards through your command history.
This certainly is much more reasonable than hitting the up arrow 40-50
times, but it won't allow you to access commands that have fallen off
the back of your log.

You can also create command aliases, and place them in your ~/.bashrc
file. This will give you much quicker access to commands. The format
for aliases are as follows:

  alias some_name='your command here -param1 -param2 -etc'

For example,

  alias grep='grep --color=auto'

You can view all your current aliases by typing 'alias' with no parameters.

**INTRODUCING LINUXCON ? THE NEW TECHNICAL CONFERENCE FOR ALL MATTERS LINUX**

The Linux Foundation is pleased to announce the launch of LinuxCon, a
brand new annual North American technical conference.  The 1st Annual
LinuxCon is taking place September 21 ? 25, 2009 in Portland, OR.

Linux is poised to become a 50 billion dollar ecosystem by 2011. While
there are many point developer conferences for Linux today, there is
not a comprehensive and high quality gathering for developers and
users of Linux to come together and collaborate.  LinuxCon will do
just this ? bringing together the best and brightest the Linux
community has to offer, including core developers, administrators, end
users, community managers and industry experts.  It will also touch on
those areas that revolve around Linux, including enterprise computing,
the mobile/embedded arena, cloud computing and virtualization.
LinuxCon will gather the best technical talent in the world with the
decision makers and experts guiding the Linux ecosystem into the
future.  ATTEND LINUXCON AND BE A PART OF THIS COMMUNITY.

LinuxCon will feature over 75 conference presentations divided among
five tracks and three audience types (Developers, Operations and
Business), tutorials, BoF sessions, keynotes, roundtables, a product &
technology showcase and sponsored mini-summits, as well as countless
networking opportunities in developer lounges and evening events.
LinuxCon offers a unique conference experience that encourages
collaboration, progress and interaction.

With top notch educational content and collaboration opportunities,
those that attend LinuxCon will leave more knowledgeable and better
positioned for success in the year to come.

**CALL FOR PAPERS IS NOW OPEN**
We encourage everyone in the community who is interested in speaking to apply.

There will be three different categories for submissions:
*Developer (kernel, core development, software engineering),
*Operations (sys admin and management, systems architecture, Linux
migration and deployment)
*Business (open source governance, enterprise, ecosystem)

Each of these groups plays a key role in the Linux community and we
want to make sure that they are represented at LinuxCon.  The deadline
for paper submissions is April 15th.

**REGISTER TO ATTEND BY APRIL 15TH FOR THE DISCOUNTED RATE OF $299!**

Back in the days when I was an admin, I used the shell 'alias' feature for
this.  If
you're using the bash shell,  There is a place in the file .bashrc in your
home directory
that has some aliases already defined, things like 'll' and 'la'.  Here's an
example
from my default .bashrc:

# some more ls aliases
> alias ll='ls -l'
> alias la='ls -A'
> alias l='ls -CF'


Choose some otherwise unclaimed 2 or 3 letter alias/command and simply add
your definitions.  Note that the syntax is exact: no spaces around the '=',
and
quotes around the aliased command string, especially if the command contains
spaces.

The new aliases (aliae? aliai?) will be available in any new gnome terminal,
and maybe
in new tabs in an existing terminal, but I haven't tried that.

The alias syntax will be different for other shells like tcsh etc.

   If you 'source .bashrc' the changes should be effective since that file is
accessed every time a new terminal is invoked, while .bash_profile is
invoked at login. You can avoid conflicts if you include ~/.bashrc in
~/.bash_profile.

Some options:

   * There is a command called 'script' that may work.  It records
*everything* input and output, including all the funky invisible
characters like linefeeds, so the resulting files generally need to be
cleaned up.  Catting one to a gnome terminal seems to do exactly what
I wanted though -- the colors and characters were properly rendered.

   To use script, just run "script <filename>" and then press Ctrl-D
when you're done.  The script will be in <filename>

   * Create your own bash scripts.  You can take the commands you run
(eg: from script recording mentioned above) and put them all in a file
that starts with

    #!/bin/bash

 Then make that file executable, and you can run all the commands by
executing that one script.  For example, here's a script that will use
lame to encode a .wav to a .mp3 using variable bit rate.  (The $1
refers to the first command line param, the $2, the second--not tested
though)

   ---------------------------------------
   #!/bin/bash

   lame -V 6 "$1" "$2"
   ----------------------------------------

  There are *many* tutorials for bash scripting.  It's quite easy to
get very basic things going, and if nothing else, you at least have a
file with the commands listed.

   * Create a Makefile.  This is an idea I just saw last weekend, and
I'm trying it out.  Makefiles are a lot like collections of scripts.
You can set up chunks of commands with names, and then later run them
with commands like:

    make resetNetwork

 (that's what I run when I can't seem to pull down an IP over wireless
-- it unloads and reloads the wlagn modules and restarts the network)

   * Bash functions.  Aliases aren't expressive enough for everything,
but you can also define functions in your .bashrc, and they aren't as
intimidating as it sounds :)  Here's a bash function that runs ls when
you cd into a directory:

   function mycd {
      cd $1
      ls
   }

  Here, the $1 refers to the parameter to the function, much like it
did in the scripting example above, so you'd use it like 'mycd /tmp'.
(You'll have to run 'source ~/.bashrc' to have changes to your bashrc
take effect in any existing terminals.)

Oh, you are in for a treat!  This is exactly what Linux is for,
all the rest is window dressing.

Shell scripts.

Put the commands, plus explanation in comments, in shell scripts.
You don't even have to remember what the shell scripts are named;
it is easy to build desktop launchers from the gnome menu, and
you can provide your own graphic icon as a .png or whatever.

The script is just the list of commands, with a "#!/bin/bash" for
the first line.  No special naming needed (.bat? ugh!), just do a 
"chmod 755 scriptname" and it will be executable.  You can add the
script to /usr/local/bin, or you can make your own bin directory.

I have made hundreds of shell scripts.  With a leaky memory like
mine, it is the only way to keep track of past successes.  Shell
scripts can call other shell scripts.  They can have command line
parameters.  If you look around your system, you will be astonished
at how many functions, command line and gui, are implemented as
shell scripts.  While many of the scripts will be too arcane for
a newbie to understand, some are dead simple, and you can copy
them to new names, then mutate them for new functions.  

You have an advantage - you are a linguist.  The hardest part
of scripting for me is keeping track of which three year old
script does what.  While I can grep for comments, it is easier
to just *name the damned things correctly*.  Linguists should
be excellent at designing naming conventions.

Shell is a complete programming language.  You can do a lot of
amazing stuff with it.  Before too long, you may find yourself
moving on to Perl or Python, allowing you to do far more amazing
stuff.  Remember, copy and modify are allowed and even encouraged
in Linux, and it is how fellows like myself, with very limited
programming ability, are able to accomplish things that required
PhDs two decades ago.

I visualize John firing up his brand new 5 horsepower concrete
drill.  No more tap-tap chisel-chisel.  Oooh, this is exciting!

In John's defense, he has stated several times to this list that he is not a
programmer.
I admit that simple shell scripts are not 'programming', but are getting
close.  Whether
or not adding lines to .bashrc can be considered 'programming' may be
arguable, but
I think John is looking for the simplest solution that doesn't require a lot
of effort, and
that is probably GUI-based (with a click click here and a click click there,
here a click
there a click everywhere a click click...).

That said,  John, shell scripting really would open up a whole new world of
control
for you.

FWIW, I have taken to capturing build logs using script lately, e.g.:

While poking around the desktop last night I discovered an application, 
under the Gnome Applications - Accessories menu, called Tomboy Notes. I 
haven't actually used it, but it looks like it presents a familiar tree, 
like the ones used in Nautilus and Thunderbird, in which one may post 
notes. When started, it puts an icon in the collection on the upper 
right of the screen. It sounds like Tomboy Notes might solve John's problem.

For this task, in particular, I recommend installing grip.  It allows you 
to save custom commands for doing the ripping and encoding while providing 
a GUI for track selection.   And while it does pull track information from 
the internets, it's very easy to edit that track informatoin before 
writing metadata to your ripped files.

Yes, this does not answer your question.  However, I think there are GUIs 
for many common tasks that allow for custom commands to do the real work.

But I do use a whole lot of scripting at the command line, so I can 
understand the desire to have quick-references for the ones you don't use 
so often.

Parphrasing Satayana, those who forget history are condemned to repeat it.

For a simple answer to your question, use the history command.

Show all the commands stored in your history:
  history

Pipe it to less because it will all scroll by too fast
history | less

just look at the times you used lame
history | grep lame

ditto wrt paranoia
history | grep cdparanoia

You can just cut and paste to a new command line to repeat.  You'll also see
that history prints a number before each command, for example
  575  gvim
  576  mkdir s1
  577  cd s1
  578  scp system1:/opt/application/net*rc* .
  579  cd ..
  580  diff cct/nethealthrc.sh s1/nethealthrc.sh
  581  diff cct/nethealthrc.sh s1/nethealthrc.sh | less
  582  cd cct
  583  scp *usr testbox:/var/tmp

You can type !<number> to repeat the command referenced by <number>
in my example if I canted to launch gvim again I could do so by typing !575

Having said that Jamie's suggestion to install grip to automate the whole rip
thing is to be considered.  If you're a KDE person K3B is a great CD/DVD rip,
copy and more application. I find K3B to be more useful than grip, though I've
used and like both.

Another option is "tee":

    make yourtargethere 2>&1 | tee build-foo.log

That'll capture STDOUT and STDERR, displaying both while saving them
to the log file. TMTOWTDI!

 While it may not be as sexy as they make it look on TV, there are a
 number of powerful Open Source tools available for analyzing file
 systems and recovering data-- even data that may have been deleted by
 the attacker. This talk will start with an overview of the standard
 Unix file system architecture and discuss tools for imaging file
 systems, suggest a few useful tools and idioms for finding clues in
 your images, and cover how to discover "interesting" data from deleted
 files and re-assemble that data into an actual file image.

 Hal Pomeranz is the founder and technical lead of Deer Run Associates,
 and has been active in the system and network management/security
 field for over twenty years. As a senior member of the Faculty for the
 SANS Institute, Hal developed the SANS "Step-by-Step" course model and
 currently serves as the track coordinator and primary instructor for
 the SANS/GIAC Linux/Unix Security Certification track (GCUX). In 2001
 he was given the SAGE Outstanding Achievement Award for his teaching
 and leadership in the field of System Administration.

Ctrl-r does incremental reverse search in your command history as well
in non-caveman shells.  See $HISTSIZE and make it big enough to

That's probably the more traditional way, but (maybe I'm an idiot ...
strike that, I *am* an idiot, at least in this particular way) I seem
to recall seeing some buffering artifacts doing it that way.  That is,
STDOUT and STDERR buffer up lines and dump them potentially out of
sequence.  The nice thing I think I am getting with the script
approach is that I get output as it's emitted without the buffering.

Maybe I am just doing something dumb, or remembering (or
misremembering) from the caveman days.

One command-line app I run frequently is wget, but I always want one
or more of several different options, depending upon what I'm going to
use it to download and when.  It got tedious looking up the various
options in the man page and it got tedious typing out different logins
I sometimes need, so I put those I use most often in a text file.
Whenever I'm going to use wget, I first 'cat' my text file, then just
highlight the particular argument(s) I want at the moment and paste
them (with a middle-click) into the command.  Definitely not as
efficient as writing a script or making an alias for wget, but in this
case I would need multiple scripts or multiple aliases to accomplish
what I want to accomplish.  I think of it as a sort of edited man
page, or cheat sheet -- i.e, here are the options that are important
to me.

It's much the same as what you're doing now, except OO.org complicates
the process, because you can't 'cat' an OO.org document.  Text files
are much more flexible -- you can read and edit them on the console,
in a terminal, in a GUI text editor, or in a word processor.

I use a small script for converting *.wav to *.mp3 with lame.  Since I
always use the same options, it's faster that way.

URxvt (also called rxvt-unicode) is nice.  It has a perl extension
that enables tabs, and it has pseudo-transparency, like GNOME
terminal, so it's pretty; and it supports 88 colors.  It also seems a
bit faster than GNOME terminal.  Various bits and pieces of GNOME have
been giving me problems lately, so I'm using it less and less.

I've used it.  It has some elements that make it wiki like.  The only
issue that I
had with it was the install. At the time I had to manually build it
and pull in mono
from a non-standard repository.

   A new quirk showed up today: when I use my default editor (joe) in a
terminal to create a .txt file and try to check the spelling I see:
          Error: No word lists can be found for the language "en_US".

   Not only has this not occurred before now, but joe is also the default
editor in my MUA (alpine), and it happily checks the spelling of messages
before I send them.

   Is the LANG locale variable incorrect (e.g., should it be "C"?) Why might
a word list be found in the MUA but not in a terminal when both use the same
editor?

Puzzled,

Rich

Thanks to everyone for all the replies. I have a few comments.

First, Tomboy is inscrutable. I cannot figure out what it is good for.
It says it is to manage your thoughts and ideas. Well, that will be a
short list. I don't think I need a whole app for that. Plus it takes a
long time to load. So I discarded Tomboy as a solution.

The !corn command returned an error message "command not found." Don't
know why.

The history command looks promising, although it takes a lot of typing
to add |grep <something>. 

Keeping the commands in a text file is what I do now. I keep the
cdparanoia and lame commands in an OOo document, but most of the rest
are in Gedit. Still, I have to open Gedit, scroll down, select the
command, switch to the terminal, then click on Paste because it can't
take Ctrl-v. It would be so much easier if I could recall the command
from within the terminal.

I also searched through Synaptic looking for alternative terminals. I
tried several, but they were all lame compared to Gnome-terminal - with
the exception of Konsole. Even Konsole adds only one functionality - it
can save folder locations as bookmarks. You can even create folders for
your bookmarks. Unfortunately, I did so while poking around and now I
can't find any way to delete the folder or edit its contents. Oh well.

Creating aliases might be worth doing, but I'll leave that for later.
One thing I can't have is that typing the alias command actually runs
the command. For example, my lame command has to end each time with the
name of the new .mp3 file that I am going to create. If the alias will
just pump in the first part of the command and leave the cursor at the
end for me to type the filename in, that will work. But if it actually
excutes the command I'll be overwriting a file that I created a few
minutes ago and forgot to rename. Similarly, the cdparanoia command has
to let me tell it which track(s) to rip. I do have a few other commands
that don't require additional input, though.

One thing that aliases will not help with is saving a "session." Let me
explain what I mean by that with an example. Ever since I upgraded from
Hardy to Intrepid I have not been able to get so much as a beep out of
my bluetooth headphones. They worked fine in Hardy, but something
broke. I spent dozens of hours at the command line trying all kinds of
commands - mostly related to pulseaudio, but also a lot relating to
bluetooth, and some to alsa. It would be nice to capture all those
commands that I used as a "session" that I can load into a tab in the
future. The up and down arrows would then work on just the commands
used in that "session." Basically I want to be able to save everything
that happened in a tab under a tab name that I can recall later. The
"script" feature that someone mentioned is a step in that direction,
but I don't want it saved in a text file. I just want to save a tab and
have the commands used in that tab come with the tab when I reopen it.
Otherwise Im back to copying and pasting again.

Oh, and is it really possible to run a jackhammer from a Linux command
line? Wouldn't that be kinda rough on the computer?

Didn't you just mess with your locale settings in relation to your postgres

Do you have a command in your history that begins with "corn" ?

This is where CTRL-R comes in.

You could do something that is very similar - save each command as its own
plaintext file. Then make that file executable, and you have just created a
shell script. (Just don't let Keith find out you omitted the #! part at the
beginning. It'll still work fine.)

I'm pretty sure that what you're looking for is not a different terminal
app.

Creating aliases might be worth doing, but I'll leave that for later.

This is exactly how aliases work. Anything you type after the alias name
gets appended to the alias itself.

In my line of work, I make extensive use of the "host" command. I use it so
often, that 4 characters just is not short enough for me. I created an alias
to "h" to get it down as short as possible.

prompt$ alias h='host'

Now, I can run "h [hostname]" whenever I want.

prompt$ h www.google.com
www.google.com          CNAME   www.l.google.com
[etc]

It's the same as if I had typed "host www.google.com."

Ummm.... I have not heard of this. I'm imagining ways it could be
accomplished with creative renaming of .bash_history files (or specifying a
custom one, if bash supports that), but to be frank, you're asking for a
crutch when you really just need to learn how to walk properly.

Anything is possible. Anything. While I have not heard of this specific
application, I'm sure that someone, somewhere, has done this or something
very similar.

A minor rebuttal on Tomboy - I use Tomboy a lot and have found it very
helpful. For years I have used post-it notes, text files,
self-addressed emails, and open text editors to poorly manage my todo
lists, short term ideas and things that I need to temporarily paste
some place. Tomboy stays running in my tool bar and makes it very easy
to keep track of this stuff in a single location. It doesn't have a
lot of features, it just sits there and lets me quickly type something
that I know won't be deleted on accident and that I'll be able to
retrieve later.

i'm sorry, apparently i should have provided a better example.

i often run a command "mpg123 -Z -@ /spoo/mp3/all.m3u"  it is pretty
much the only command line i have in my command history that uses the
command mpg123, and in fact is the only command i use that starts with
the letters "mpg".

so instead of scrolling back to it, or retyping it, i just type

!mpg

and the shell reproduces and runs my old command.

doesn't require anything special to set up;  it's free and automatic
in most shells.

Tomboy gets installed on my openSUSE desktop by default. I assumed it
was some kind of "virtual Post-it Notes" and have been ignoring it.
Maybe I should open it up and poke it and see which way it moves?? :)

Ah, now I understand. 

However, it is not suitable. Just now I typed "!la" expecting to get
the lame command the last time I ran it. Indeed it did, but it *ran the
command*, automatically overwriting a file that I had created earlier!

I need something that pops the command into the terminal, but lets me
edit it before running it. I don't mind hitting the Enter button by
myself. Really, I can manage that. :)

Is there a way to make it just give me the command but not run it?

sure.  run 'shopt -s histverify' first.
(you can stick that command in your .bashrc or .profile to be run non
every login if you want the setting to "stick" between restarts of
your terminal window.

Ctrl+r will bring up history search. Start typing, and bash will match
the latest command that contains the string you have typed, as you
type. It doesn't match from the beginning, but other than that.

and Ctrl+r just brings up the commands, you can then edit them, hit
enter and execute them.

The beauty of text files is that you *don't* have to open them to
access their contents.

It works like this:

mcubed at debdesk:$ cat cheat_wget.txt
wget options
-S     #use to see server headers
-c     #use to continue a partially downloaded file
-a [name of log]     #use to generate a logfile
--limit-rate=??k     #use to limit download rate
--http-user=XXXXX --http-password=XXXXX     #use for Easynew login
mcubed at debdesk:$ wget

The wget options I use 95% of the time are all there -- no opening man
pages and scrolling through them, no opening text editors and
scrolling and selecting and right-clicking and selecting "copy" and
switching back to the terminal and right clicking again and selecting
"paste".

I just highlight, with the mouse, or retype the particular option(s) I
need for the file I'm about to download, and paste into the next line
(after $ wget) using the middle mouse button.  When it's a one-letter
option, it's faster just to type the letter, rather than highlighting
and pasting.  My problem is that I have a hard time remembering what
the letter is, and whether it needs one dash ("-") or two dashes
("--"), and whether it needs to be capitalized or lower-case.  So now
it's right there, as a readily accessible reference.

You don't need Ctrl-v and Ctrl-c in the terminal and you never need to
right-click and select from a menu of options.  Just highlight a some
text anywhere (a website, an email, a word-processing document, a text
file, or a pre-existing line in the terminal), move to the position
you want to paste the text into, and push the middle mouse button.
That pastes whatever text is currently highlighted, wherever it might
be highlighted.

Here, highlight this:

PASTING IS FUN

Switch over to a terminal and push your middle mouse button.

See?  Much faster than opening file/highlighting
text/right-clicking/selecting "copy"/switching to
terminal/right-clicking again/selecting "paste".

Tomboy is actually pretty nice, though I don't use it anymore.  It
allows you to create notes on the fly, which any post-it type app can
do, but more than that it brings wiki-type functionality to those
notes.  So it's really easy (practically automatic) to have one note
reference another, or to reference several other notes, and link all
the notes you want to each other as needed.  You can get the same kind
of functionality with small wiki application like Zim [1] or
TiddlyWiki [2], but Tomboy is nicely integrated into GNOME.  Tomboy is
extremely flexible, so flexible that I think a lot of users dismiss it
out-of-hand as being trivial.  They mistake simplicity for
uselessness.

Here's an interesting blog post about using Tomboy to implement a GTD
(Getting Things Done) program:

http://chakravyuh.blogspot.com/2005/09/gtd-with-linux-gnome-and-tomboy.html

The downsides of Tomboy are that it requires Mono ... that's ginormous
overhead if you aren't using anything else that requires Mono.  Beagle
uses Mono also, so if you already use Beagle, you aren't incurring
much extra overhead by using Tomboy.  The other is that it isn't very
portable.  I'm sure there are ways to extract and reformat the XML
data to use in other apps, but I never looked into it.  Having to do
that pretty much cancels out the benefit of "simplicity."  Basically,
using Tomboy pretty much weds you to GNOME.  If you're a lifelong
GNOME devotee, that's not an issue; but if you like a little more
flexibility, it's a problem.

Yes. aliases will do that.  For example,

alias gh='history | grep'

allows me to type

   gh foo

and any of my past commands containing 'foo' will be listed. NOT executed, 
listed.

wes,

   Yes, and I reset them all to C. Logging out and back in makes no
difference. When I type 'locale' they all show up as C, and aspell
apparently finds the appropriate word list when checking outgoing e-mails.

   So, after changing the locale in /etc/profile.d/lang.sh, what do I do so
aspell does not look for 'en_US' word lists, but 'C' word lists?

   BTW, I got all those postgres and CRM issues resolved by taking a totally
different approach and using TreeLine instead.

   Here's an alternative that does the equivalent: TreeLine
                    <http://treeline.bellz.org/index.html>

As the website answers its own question, what is TreeLine:

"Do you have lots of sticky notes lying around with various useful
information jotted down? Or many lists of books, movies, website logins,
personal contacts, or things to do? Can you find them when you need them?
Well, I often couldn't. So here's my answer.

"Some would call TreeLine an Outliner, others would call it a PIM. Basically,
it just stores almost any kind of information. A tree structure makes it
easy to keep things organized. And each node in the tree can contain several
fields, forming a mini-database. The output format for each node can be
defined, and the output can be shown on the screen, printed, or exported to
html."

   Not better than Tomboy (or the old DOS InfoSelect), not worse, just
different.

Does joe have a "drop to shell" or "execute system command" or similar
function? If so, I would use it to run "env" while in both conditions
(working and not working). Then you can compare variables and hopefully one
will show up incorrect.

I don't specifically know the answer to your question. I have not used joe
nor alpine.

asumming a history that includes:

 482 less /long/path/to/some/other_file
 502 less /long/path/to/some/viewed_file

and has no other less commands.

My irritation with ctrl+r is as I type command 502 comes up, I know it's not
what I want, since I'm thinking of other_file.  What can one do to skip the
current match and go to the next?

I abandoned ctrl+r and started grepping history because of this PITA.

Hit CTRL+R again.

1. CTRL+R
2. less
3. CTRL+R (as many times as it takes to reach the particular "less" you're
looking for)

Gah, it, ah, err, no.  NO.  It can't be that's TOO EASY.  What is this?
Keep doing intuitive, easy to learn and remember stuff like that and the
command line will lose its "I'm picky about my friends" functionality.

Which is to say, Thank you.  That's just what I needed.

Another way to get the environment for a running process (in case you
can't drop to a shell) is to run:

  cat /proc/{PID}/environ | tr '\0' '\n'

Here, "{PID}" is the process ID.

Good luck,

yeah, tell that to john. I think the command line has a ways to go yet

Cool! I am still not familiar enough with /proc since most of my old tricks

   What that shows is my shell environment, not explicitly joe's environment.
Within the env listing is LANG=C.

   Perhaps I should add the aspell en_US word list from the extra package.
I've not before needed to do this.

Thanks, Wes,

And if you go too far, you can use backspace to step back to the one
you want, and then munge as needed from there.  

Just to restate for emphasis, your reverse incremental search can
match anything in the commandline, not just the command.  Like, for
example, you can match hostnames from rsync commands to get directly
to the one you want to repeat.  Just think about what it's doing, what
you are looking for, and what is in your history and use your head to
optimize the query.

The reverse incremental search (and its forward-direction sibling) is
pretty familiar and natural to us Emacs users, which may have been
where the feature originated.

In theory, it should be the same. Also, it's important to compare with the
"working" joe's environment.

 (Feb 20 - 22)
Message-ID: <498B311B.8030000@zenlinux.com>

Hi all,

Some discussion started on the PDX Ubuntu LoCo mailing list about having
an informal get-together to participate in the Ubuntu Global Bug Jam,
which is scheduled for the weekend of February 20-22:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GlobalBugJam

The idea is to get more people involved in triaging bugs and becoming
familiar with the bug reporting process. You do not need ANY experience
to get started with this; the purpose of it is to be a welcoming
environment to allow people to make contributions to the FOSS projects
they use and enjoy, without necessarily having the technical experience
to fix bugs.

If you're interested in joining us, please get in touch with me after
tonight's meeting; I'll be wearing a black baseball cap with the
Specialized (bike) logo on it
(http://www.pinnedmtb.com/specialized-Logo.gif).

Thanks,

Scott

I like Ctrl-r. It gives me the command, but doesn't run it. Thus, I can
get a previous command and edit it before running it. It also takes
less typing than the history command. Using ! is even shorter, but it
automatically runs the command.

I don't suppose there is a way to make Ctrl-r skip the first word, or
specifically the word "sudo" when it searches? It would saving having
to type the word every time.

I'd still like to be able to save everything that happened in a tab
over a period of time. It would be very handy when troubleshooting
where you did not resolve the problem and need to come back to it
later. If you could save everything that happened in a tab then you
could just reload the tab later and use the history command in the tab
to remind yourself of all the commands you tried. And then you could
use Ctrl-r to get the ones you want to retry.

Yes, that is always an option. But it takes much more effort. And I'm a
big fan of tabs. And I notice that (at least in the Gnome terminal) the
up and down arrows are specific to the tab you are in. For example, I
can be ripping and encoding CDs in one tab and solving a problem with
pulseaudio in another. In the ripping and encoding tab I use just two
or three commands, and the up and down arrows display only those
commands and none of the commands that I am using in the other tab, and
vice-versa. Having said that, Ctrl-r does access all the commands from
all tabs over all of recorded history.

My point is that the terminal is already somewhat configured for tabs
having distinct identies and histories. The feature I want does not
exist, but I'm guessing it wouldn't be too hard to implement, given the
way tabs currently work. In fact, you can even give your tabs different
names, a feature which I use occasionally when I have several tabs open
- makes it easier to get to the right one. It would be so simple if I
could just "save" the tab and all of its history. Next time I launch
the terminal I can just select the tab from a list of saved tabs and
I'm back where I was when I quit. A quick "history" command would
refresh my memory as to all the commands I used during that session.

The problem with a text file is that it takes more effort. Just
remembering what I called it and where I put it is a challenge. I am
used to tabs.

Sure, just <Ctrl-R> and start typing the second word. The search
doesn't need to match from the first character.

???  I'm not sure what you mean.  C-r searches for strings appearing 
anywhere in your history.  The search does *not* start at the 
beginning of each line in your history.

Given this in your history:
  echo foo bar baz
  echo fee fie foe fum
typing C-r f brings up the last echo command.  Continuing with an o, 
nothing changes.  Continuing with a second o gets you the first echo 
command.

You can "preview" a command without running it by adding ":p" to the
end of the ! erm... an example is probably simpler:


$ lame -v 6 my.wav my.mp3

$ !la
 lame -v 6 my.wav my.mp3

$ !la:p
 lame -v 6 my.wav my.mp3
$

Note that with the :p, lame did *not* run, it just: (1) printed the
command line, and (2) added that command line to your history, so you
can press  and edit it.

Personally, I much prefer ctr-r, as others have suggested, but :p is
worth knowing about.

(most of these tricks I've picked up from _Unix_Power_Tools_ by Jerry
Peak, Tim O'Reilly, and Mike Loukides.  It's a great book, but the
tricks are getting rather dated as new features obviate the need for
some of the content.  I also wish it were more clear which shell
examples are for csh and which are for bash.)

I use Tomboy every day and it works very well for me too.  One of the
things I really like about it is the synchronization features.  You can
sync to a local directory or even a remote system.  Being able to sync
my notes on all of the systems I work or is very handy to me so that I
can always have my notes handy.  I have mine set up to sync to a file
server so that I can get a copy of my notes on any computer I use.  Well
any computer that has tomboy installed.

There is also basket which is a kde application that is dockable and is
supposed to be a nice note taking application.

this is the same effect as the 'shopt -s histverify' setting i posted
about last night.  and that works automatically every time, and you
can set it once (in your startup files) and forget it.

Subject: [PLUG] Removing a storage media icon from the desktop
Message-ID: <498B843C.4010504@comcast.net>

I forgot to unmount a USB connected hard drive before disconnecting it 
from my Ubuntu machine (Gnome) and am stuck with a "40.0 GB Media" icon 
that won't go away. Re-connecting the drive gives me a new icon, which I 
can unmount.

Attempting to delete gives me a message that says "There was an error 
getting information ..." Dragging it to the trash icon produces another 
error message and offers to delete, but doesn't.

Any ideas how to get rid of it?

Thanks.

It looks like a "hanging chad" type situation, a link to the media is
left hanging since it was not properly removed.
Have you checked in the Desktop folder, going through the browser, or
in a terminal, to /home/$USER/Desktop, tried removing the icon as sudo
or root?

You might try to restart the hal-daemon or hal service:
/etc/init.d/[hal_whateveritscalled] restart

Or you could try the Winders way and just reboot.  That should clean
out the temporary link on the desktop.

I'm more a GUI kinda guy, but there are certain commands that I use
repeatedly in the terminal. For example, I use cdparanoia and lame to
rip and encode CDs from my collection. But sometimes I don't use those


Thank you for this conversation.  It has been educational for me also.  I have been trying to rely more on the shell as I continue to learn!

shopt -s histverify

This is a bash built-in shell command that does exactly that. If you put
that in your ~/.bashrc, it should always be in effect.

While you're at it, if you find yourself fat-fingering certain commands
frequently, you can make aliases and save yourself a little frustration:

alias grpe='grep'
alias les='less'
alias suod='sudo'
alias chmog='chmod'
alias chwon='chown'

These are my personal favorites ;)

Oddly, none of the media icons are in /home/rsteff/Desktop.

There is a directory /etc/init.d/hal but this is what happens when I try 
to restart it:

rsteff at moonguide:~$ sudo etc/init.d/hal restart
[sudo] password for rsteff:
sudo: etc/init.d/hal: command not found
rsteff at moonguide:~$

There are some directories under hal, but they are mostly empty.

I tried a <ctrl><alt><bksp>. An icon appeared that is just labeled 
"disk". Trying to "unmount" it, I get an error message that says:

    /sbin/umount.hal: /media/disk is not recognized by hal

I assume that told me where to look, so I tried to delete the empty 
directory:

rsteff at moonguide:/media$ sudo rm -rf disk
rm: cannot remove directory `disk': Device or resource busy
rsteff at moonguide:/media$

How do I find out what's keeping "disk" busy and tell it let it go?

Dick,

   I don't sudo, but use su -c ' '. Wonder if you could put the whole command
in single quotes so sudo knows that both the script and the following
command belong together.

> How do I find out what's keeping "disk" busy and tell it let it go?

   ps ax | grep media

You forgot the leading /.  It should be /etc/init.d/hal.

Oops. But, it didn't help:


rsteff at moonguide:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/hal restart
[sudo] password for rsteff:
 * Restarting Hardware abstraction layer hald                            
[ OK ]
rsteff at moonguide:~$

The icon is still on the desktop, and the entry is still in /media.

rsteff at moonguide:/media$ sudo rm -rf disk
rm: cannot remove directory `disk': Device or resource busy
rsteff at moonguide:/media$

Did you try to actually reboot, not just restart X?
I am wondering if the cleanup activites during a reboot might clear this up.

Hmmm ... only 256 MB??

1. There are lighter desktops than even XFCE4 if you are willing to
forgo some eye candy. I've had very good luck with WindowMaker. It's a
bit tricky to get set up, but once you do, you can customize it to
just about any work flow. One of these days I'm going to try LXDE,
which has a pretty good reputation for lightness.

2. I did some memory size testing on browsers the other day. Firefox
is the largest in real and virtual memory. Seamonkey had the smallest
RSS and Opera had the smallest VSZ. My recommendation is to go with
Seamonkey because it has both a browser and an email client that's
pretty close to Thunderbird, and it's open source. Incidentally, the
Debian "unbranded" version of Seamonkey is called "iceape". The
unbranded version may be lighter weight than the official branded
Mozilla version, but I haven't tested that.

3. I haven't done much with either AbiWord or Gnumeric since
OpenOffice 3 came out. I don't know about the Ubuntu builds, but the
openSUSE builds of OO 3 seem to have finally wrung out a lot of the
performance issues. I haven't taken back *all* the nasty things I said
about OO, but at least they've cleaned up their act a bit.

4. When you're looking for memory hogs, "pmap -d" is your friend. For
some details, there's a great article at
http://lwn.net/Articles/230975/

5. IIRC "evince" uses less RAM than Acrobat Reader for reading PDFs.

Not a KDE 'guru' but..


If you want to change default file associations in KDE 4.x for the
default web browser, email client, terminal program or messenger, you
need to open up System settings/Default applications tabs and the
dialogue will take you from there 

To change other default file associations in KDE 4.x, open up Konqueror
(default web browser), open the Settings/Configure Konqueror dialogue
and you'll see an applications tree   in which you can change every
imaginable file type association.

Being new to Ubuntu I miss the old KDE 3 and kcontrol tools but this
Konqueror access, as illogical as it seems (to me anyway), will perform
the required tasks. 


Now if only a real KDE/Konqueror guru could explain how to enable a
working Flash plug-in for Konqueror. I've installed the
flashplugin-nonfree and it works greet in Seamonkey and Firefox but I
get nothing in Konqueror

I only restarted X. It just felt wrong to have to reboot. Alas, that is 
what finally fixed the problem. The icon is gone from the desktop, and 
there is no directory "disk" in /media.

We had PLUG general meeting afters in the main bar section of
Roots, and looked at the meeting room.  The main bar section
was noisy, but the food and beer were good.   The wifi worked.

The meeting room at the southwest corner of the building
looks great for Advanced Topics.  We can project against the
wall.  It is about twice as large as the Jax dining room.  
It is glassed in and facing southeast, so there may be issues
with sunlight interfering with slides during midsummer, but
during most parts of the year the room should be dark enough
at 730p.  It is well separated from the main part of Roots
(the brewing tanks are in between) so it is quieter than Jax,
and definitely quieter than meeting room at the Lucky Lab.

The room wasn't lit up when we looked, but next time I am in
the neighborhood during daytime I will stop in and examine it
more closely.  I didn't scout out wall sockets, so I'm not
sure what laptop power is like.  There is enough space on the
floor that people could haul in a few desktop/tower machines,
and that makes for interesting alternatives, like special
topic install clinics, when Alan can't find a speaker.  

The third Wednesday comedy nights are in the main bar.  As 
Randal pointed out, our comedy may be funnier than theirs, 
but we won't have to take turns in the same space.

Tony already made arrangements for Wednesday the 18th.  So unless
We hear differently from Alan, I say we should go for it!  Roots
is at 1520 SE 7th, on the east side of the street, half a block
south of Hawthorne.  They are two blocks from the Lucky Lab and
about three blocks from Free Geek.  It looks like there will be
lots of free street parking around there.

So, three cheers for Tony for making the arrangements!  I will
contact the POSSE group and perhaps they can move into the slot
in front of us as before - same time, new channel.

MacFreda Publishing has made a PDF edition of "Ubuntu Pocket Guide and
Reference" by Keir Thomas available as a free download.  It seems to
have been published in 2008, so shouldn't be too dated yet.  The print
edition is on sale at Amazon (and presumably elsewhere) for $9.94.

I can't speak to it's quality since I haven't seen it and don't use
Ubuntu, but since many here do I thought some folk might be
interested.  Maybe it would be useful to have on hand at one of the
clinics.

My sources tell me that this is indeed the "same thing" as the Linux
Plumbers Conference, not in competition with it.

Did you find out anything about seating?  There weren't nearly enough chairs
when I was there, and I've had no response yet to my latest inquiries.

Pretty good deal, although the page numbers in the TOC are off. 

It will be especially good for newcomers.

Subject: [PLUG] PC speaker volume
Message-ID: <ae2db4620902061051y19f1b691ve0dd8ffc739adb7d@mail.gmail.com>

hi folks,

i have done some unsuccessful googling on this, but perhaps someone here knows:

how can i control the volume of the internal PC speaker?  with the
pcspkr module loaded, i get beeps when i request them, but they are
pretty quiet.  my cubicle-neighbors think this is swell.  however, i
have a few important processes set up to try to get my attention when
they are occurring/completed, and the quiet beep rarely imposes itself
on my conscious mind.  i suspect this speaker has more decibel range
than it is currently displaying (quiet beep, or nothing) and is
somehow controllable from userland.

i use ubuntu 8.04 (which uses alsa) and alsamixer, but don't use (or
even have installed) any desktop environment, so alsamixer is really
my main interface to the audio system.  i've seen some ubuntu forum
posts that suggest that some piece of gnome can be convinced to
control pc speaker volume, but they were not a "run
gnome-volume-control" style suggestion, which might enable me to find
the util and give it a try.  i'm not unwilling to try other tools, but
i'd rather not have to install kde or gnome just to test a tool.  if
anyone can get their system to control the internal speaker beeps, and
can even tell me the name of the actual tool (rather than "click the
speaker icon by the clock"), that would be helpful.  if someone knows
the appropriate ioctl and parameters i can cram into a C program, even
better.  if someone has an entirely other way (modify a file in /proc?
 drip goats' blood directly on it?), advice of any kind is welcomed.

thanks in advance for your help!

Don't know about Ubuntu, but I had the same problem on Fedora 10.

Do you mean that the PCSPEAKER control in alsamixer has no effect, or that
there is no PCSPEAKER control?  On my
laptop (Dell 2650, Ubuntu 8.04) I can raise and lower the PCSPEAKER volume
and hear volume level changes with ctl-g.  This is in a simple text console
(no
window manager). I do have to exit alsamixer to hear the changes.

there is no PCSPEAKER control in my alsamixer.  all the sliders fit on
one page in my terminal (i also use the text version), so it's not
just hiding off to the right (an interesting UI decision to allow a
text-ui window to scroll left/right, though that's a separate
discussion).

hmm, that post seems to be about an entirely different problem.  i
have no issues with the pcspkr module loaded or unloaded, i just can't
control the volume (i'd like to make it louder) once it is loaded.

Chris,

   When I log in on a console and type 'alsamixer' it takes up the entire
screen and there are little 'arrows' on the right border of the display.
Arrowing to the right, the 14th column is PCSPEAKER. I'm surprised that your
version is not as complete.

In my limited experience, it is the capabilities of the sound hardware that
determine
what controls show up in alsamixer.  Here's what lsmod shows on my laptop.
There
is boocoo snd/sound related stuff.  pcspkr is there, too, but doesn't seem
to be referenced by any other driver.  I'm not sure what driver is actually
controlling
the speaker in this case. Not much help, I guess.

yeah, that burned me once back when i did desktop support, so it was
the first thing i checked, before i started googling or wrote here =)

you and me both.

i only have 12 sliders categories, of which 3 are totally disabled (no
sliders, just the label and the option to mute/unmute).  i've tried
turning everything all the way up and unmuting to no avail.

here's what amixer says i have as far as controllable audio devices
(and yes, the pcspkr module is loaded):

fool at kailarose$ amixer scontrols
Simple mixer control 'Master',0
Simple mixer control 'Headphone',0
Simple mixer control 'PCM',0
Simple mixer control 'Front',0
Simple mixer control 'Front Mic',0
Simple mixer control 'Front Mic Boost',0

Simple mixer control 'IEC958 Playback Source',0
Simple mixer control 'Mono',0
Simple mixer control 'Capture',0
Simple mixer control 'Capture',1
Simple mixer control 'Input Source',0

Tony, can you tell me what yours says?  lsmod outputs don't show
anything important & different to me--the pcspkr module is obviously
effective since removing it silences the beeps entirely.

This is a dell precision t5400, which seems rather well-supported by ubuntu...

One of these says that the volume control for pcspkr should be in kernel

I'm running the latest kernel update for 8.04 (2.6.24-23-generic)

I occurred to me to ask amixer what it thinks the controller is:

interesting!  i suppose i could compile my own 2.4.26 kernel, since i
too am running ubuntu's latest which clocks in before .26.


> http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/7/1/467

i looked at that thread before i mailed the list, and as far as i
could tell that didn't actually end up getting put into the kernel,
ever.

i've got a:

Card default 'Intel'/'HDA Intel at 0xfbffc000 irq 16'
  Mixer name    : 'Analog Devices AD1984'
  Components    : 'HDA:11d41984'
  Controls      : 27
  Simple ctrls  : 16

if only there were a couple more simple ctrls that happened to
correspond to the beeper...

thanks all for your help & suggestions so far!

The command "alsamixer" does not always display all the controls. To
see them all on my computer I had to do "alsamixer -hw:0." At least
that is how I remembered the command. Once I saw all the sliders I
found the ones that were not turned all the way up.

alsamixer -c0

forces the sound card selection if there happens to be more than one.

FWIW, when I was messing with sound on Macs at Freegeek,  I  sometimes
had to go back to oss to get some things to work.  I don't have any idea
whether or not this is at all applicable in Chris's  case.

hmmm.... that's very interesting.  This spec sheet
http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/products/precn/en/precn_t5400_specsheet.pdf

says that the controller is a

Am I looking a the wrong Dell Precision T5400?  Do you have a sound card
over
and above onboard AC97, with maybe onboard audio switched off in BIOS?  (
really
reaching now)?

just whatever came with the system is in there--my audio comes out of
the front panel ports as well as the chassis-mounted (not
card-mounted) ports in the rear.  i didn't purchase the system, but i
seem to recall many dells having more than one audio card option?

Good question - I saw about 20 places to sit.  Barb Davis probably
has extra furniture;  perhaps she can sell it to Roots!

Subject: [PLUG] Arduino password extractor for Free Geek
Message-ID: <20090207021221.GA17308@gate.kl-ic.com>

Who wants to do some Arduino work?

I am working on fixturing and procedures to make a "BIOS password
remover" for Free Geek.   Currently, some of the Thinkpad laptops
donated to Free Geek have the BIOS password set, which makes them
impossible to re-use.  The password is stored in an NVRAM on the
main board and is accessed during BIOS startup;  without knowing
the password, there is no way to remove it.  Even Levono scraps
the mainboards if they don't have the passwords.

The fixture I have is designed to clip onto the NVRAM, send signals
into the pins, and make it emit the password.  The recoverd password
can be typed into the keyboard to enter the BIOS, where the password
can be removed.  So far I have followed the procedure here:

http://sodoityourself.com/hacking-ibm-thinkpad-bios-password/

... substituting a "dip clip" for the soldering.  The control
software used in the article is closed source, for Windoze.  Yuk.
It makes logic signals out of serial port levels.  Yuck again.  
This should be pretty easy to do with a USB powered Arduino to
make the logic signals,  and open source code substituting for
the Windoze code.  

I don't have time to do an Arduino programming project anytime
soon.  Free Geek is going to get an old Win95 Thinkpad 560 and
the closed source software for now.  But if someone wants to
take this on as an Arduino software project, I can provide
NVRAM knowledge, and buy and build the Arduinos and cables.  

Is anybody interested?

I don't know from more than one audio controller.  If there were such, I
would hope
that BIOS would know about it.   I convinced myself that the sound card
reported
by amixer is the right one (AD1984 codec seems to be right).  However, the
spec
says SigmaTel STAC9200 codec.  All of my amixer info indicates SigmaTel
awareness, and yours does not.   AD1984 codec support seems to have arrived
in the kernel about 2.6.23,
http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_23
and my interpretation (possibly flawed) is that pcspkr
volume control didn't get there until 2.6.26 (link in previous post).  Even
farther
asea now, I have no idea at this point what might be done about this.

My hardware control background is sketchy, but this is the kind of
challenging
project I'm looking for.  Plus, I currently have time on my hands (hopefully
not
for long, but things don't look pretty out there.)  I have also been looking
for  something else to do for Freegeek.   If nobody else with more
resources/experiences
wants to take it on, I will leap into the breach.  I'll get Arduino and
start playing
with it, at any rate.

I guess maybe you could, as a test, roll back to 2.6.22 or thereabout, and
see
if there is any change in sound control.

There's an Arduino Cult Induction tomorrow (Sunday, Feb 8) from 1-5 at
PNCA.  $25 gets you a Dorkboard kit, a Benito (USB interface), and lots
of assistance getting it all working. Bring your laptop and we'll help
you get the Arduino IDE running.

Oooh, late reply. I hope this is still useful. Yes, 1241 NW Johnson, ask
about the room at the front desk. It's always upstairs, but I don't
remember the room number.

Message-ID: <183D1F88B1BC449EBF5FA6CBB23ADC54@RAMA>

I recently got a Icy Dock MB671SK-B from NewEgg (with $10 rebate).
I have yet to install it.

The unit takes SATA drives directly (no drawer).

What I am seeking is a solution for storing the drives not in use.
All I can find are racks to hold active drives.
I want a rack to hold "loose" drives.
What I have in mind, might look like a rack for storing 8-track tapes
(remember those?).
Both stationary racks or racks in a (brief) case are of interest here.
Anybody seen such?

Thanks in advance.

I don't know of anything off the shelf that is exactly what you are
looking for. My first thought though is to go browsing around at Ikea
and finding something inexpensive that can be hacked into a good
solution. Probably should hit the scratch-and-dent room first. As far
as the briefcase goes, I would think a Pelican case of appropriate
size with the cut-suit foam padding inside would work nicely, assuming
you kept the drives in static bags.

My typical solution loose drive storage is to use the plastic
clamshells that OEM drives often ship in. Seagate calls then
"Sea-shells". They stack nicely and protect the drives pretty well
from minor bumps and whatnot. Another thing I use are silicone sleeves
similar to these:
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817998030

Again, they stack nicely, protect from bumps, and have the added bonus
of preventing the drives from sliding around and the drive can remain
"protected" when using a USB adapter with it.

Neither of those are quite what you seem to be looking for, but they
might work in a pinch.

We are happy to announce that the Open Source Bridge Call for
Proposals is now open!

We would love to hear all of those interesting ideas you have in your
head?and so would everyone else. That's why we will be accepting your
proposals for Open Source Bridge talks through March 31.

What kind of proposals, you ask? Open Source Bridge strives to be a
different kind of open source conference. We're not focusing on
specific languages, platforms, or pursuits. We're focusing on what it
means to be a responsible open source citizen. As such, we've worked
to craft categories that allow people to share their thoughts and
ideas, independent of their chosen development methods.

Those categories include:

    * Cooking: Crafting useful recipes for software development,
systems administration, and working with open source.
    * Chemistry: Understanding how our systems work, in order to
improve and extend.
    * Business: Building open source businesses that thrive.
    * Culture: Exploring how open source extends through technology
into our communities.
    * Hacks: Tinkering, experimenting and bending the rules to make
hardware and software do what we want.

Need more details? See the guidance for submitting a proposal.

http://opensourcebridge.org/call-for-proposals/

So what are you waiting for? We'd love to hear what you have to say.
Begin creating your proposal today.

Subject: [PLUG] Guile/SLIB Questions
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0902091554010.16615@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I am, once again, having difficulties building gnucash. This time I'm
using the SlackBuild script and I carefully installed all 18 prerequisite
packages. It used to bail out during the build step, and I thought that I
traced that down to residual old guile and slib files. I removed both the
slib and guile packages, cleaned out remaining files/directories, then
reinstalled guile-1.8.5 and slib-3b1 (in that order). Then I ran 'ldconfig'.

   Now the build is bailing out during the configuration stage:

checking for guile - 1.6.0 <= version < 99.99.99... yes: 1.8.5
checking for guile - 1.8.0 <= version < 99.99.99... yes: 1.8.5
checking for SLIB support... configure: error:

    Cannot find SLIB.  Are you sure you have it installed?
    See http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=347922
    and http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=483631

   There are no conflicting libraries so I'm out of ideas why slib is not
seen; it's /usr/bin/slib. However, when I look at /usr/bin/slib it starts
this way:

#! /bin/sh
SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/SBo/package-slib/usr/lib/slib/
S48_VICINITY=/tmp/SBo/package-slib/usr/lib/scheme48/
VERSION=3b1

   Why it references the /tmp/SBo directory path rather than /usr/lib I've no
idea (but I've written to the package maintainer asking). Also, there is no
scheme48/ directory; for that matter, there is no scheme48.

   Any ideas are appreciated.

Well, I installed the Ubuntu Hardy slib (3a4), and /usr/bin/slib doesn't
look
anything like that.  So I got he 3b1 zip file, and the slib.sh that's in
there,
and that I assume becomes /usr/bin/slib, looks pretty much like my
installed version, so I;d have to guess that your /usr/bin/slib is corrupt,
which does not auger well.

tony,

   The package's author re-wrote it to place the libraries in /usr/lib/slib,
but there's still a path reference to scheme48 and that does not exist on my
hard drive. He's probably going to work on that, too.

   Thanks for confirming that the path is wrong.

Rich

I met Sarah (Event Coordinator) at Roots this evening and got a little more
detail.

Seating consists of 12 chairs, one sofa, and 5 or 6 picnic tables.
That's it.

Wall sockets are available but limited to the bare wall that Keith
mentioned a projector screen possibility.  Sarah said we could connect
power strips if we wanted to.  Using a standalone screen on the stage
would require a substantial extension cord to get to a projector.

There is a separate door to the street, which is usually locked.  First
person in could unlock it, and we would need to lock up at some point.

No charge for use of the space, but we would need to cover staff cost
if we wanted wait service.  In such case the menu is
'reduced' to those items easiest to prepare, so as not to overload the
kitchen.   Otherwise we need to be 'self-sufficient'.

Minors are allowed until 9pm.  I must have read the notice wrong.

I had her pencil in Wednesdays for March 18 and April 15.

I think all the difficulties you mentioned can be overcome. We can
bring a few power strips and extension cords. Our computers don't draw
much power, so that should work out OK.

The big issue is lack of chairs. I wonder if Free Geek has a surplus
they would sell us on the cheap. Maybe we could buy a dozen chairs for
cheap enough that we could just give leave them at Roots.

Tony - I'm copying this to the list.  Good questions and answers.
Thanks for checking up on this.

This all sounds good.  The space needs development, and we can help. 
Perhaps there are folks in the group with chairs to get rid of -
downsizing from foreclosed houses or closed businesses, but hopefully
for happier reasons.  We can help build the space.  

We use extension cords at Jax now;   that doesn't change.  The cool
thing is that there is space to bring stuff in.  Next time I'm 
there in daylight, we learn how many amps the room can supply;
enough for servers and LAN parties?  I wonder what businesses were
there before Roots, and how much power they took?

People can go to the bar to order food.   We can watch out for each
other.

However, if some programmer is feeling frisky, perhaps we can set
up a computer and display and printer in the kitchen, and a web app
running someplace for displaying the menu and taking orders, which
we access with laptops over the wifi.  Then we can enter our orders
over the web (perhaps even a day before, so they can buy materials)
and they can just load orders on a roller cart.  One of us is selected
(perhaps randomly by the web app) to go get the roller cart and bring
it back to the room, distribute the food, and take the cart back for
more.  We can reduce the burden on them as much as necessary, and
perhaps develop a new open source app while we are at it.

Yesterday, I was working in VirtualBox and installed a program from CD 
rom.  I removed the CD and went on about my business.  Later I noticed 
the icon hanging around the regular Gnome desktop.

My solution at the command line:

robin at moose:~$ mount
/dev/cdrom0 on /media/cdrom0
sudo umount /media/cdrom0

The offending icon left.
This happened on the wife's laptop running Ubuntu 8.10.

Hope this helps,

That seems like a job for a conveyor belt.  Yes, the plates would have 
to go back...  perhaps it's more like a tram with baskets.

Not that it's just for John, but in light of the long (and, IMO, very
interesting and informative) thread about different methods of
recalling, preserving, aliasing, and so on, commands previously used,
I now present .... <<<drum_rolllllllll>>>

shell_sink
http://shell-sink.blogspot.com/

Someone just wrote a brief intro to it at the Debian Administration blog:
http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/625

In a nut-shell (heh heh):

"If you've ever wasted time trying to remember a particular command
line incantation, shell_sink is for you. It stores commands and makes
them easily accessible with searching and tagging. If you work on
multiple computers shell_sink can aggregate your history across all
machines. System administrators can even use it to aggregate commands
issued across an entire organization making them fully searchable.
Never lose a command again."

Might be something to take a look at.

In early November, 2008, Deer Run purchased Apple iPhones for it's
Executive Officers (i.e., my wife Laura and me). Laura was really
jazzed about her "cool new iPhone". My excitement was tempered by the
fact that I knew it was going to take me several days of fiddling to

First, you lob the bucket at a general area, based on a vague target.

Then, you tune the bucket lobbing based on accuracy of previous lobs
*or*
You use large bucket loads to saturate the area (with a load of, say,  
cows), and assume the target will be hit, or the load will cascade  
onto another target to be hit.

Here are the instructions:

If you have a Debian based distribution you can install
shellsink-client by adding the following line to your apt sources
file.

deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/shellsink/ubuntu hardy main

Then update your package lists and install the client with

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install shellsink

It also says you need to append this to your ~/.bashrc:
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~joshuacronemeyer/shellsink/trunk/annotate/head%3A/bash_profile

(See: http://shell-sink.blogspot.com/2008/12/installing-shellsink-client-application.html
)

This guy seems to be fragging with dates of his posts so that they
appear on the page in the order he wants them to, rather than the
order in which he posted them.  That's the only explanation I can
think of for why he has two posts dated 2010.  He probably shouldn't
be using blogging software for this purpose.  Anyway, this is pretty
recent software, though I don't think it does that much to your
system.  It's mainly a way of enabling end-users to access Google Apps
Engine for the purpose of saving, indexing, and searching their bash
history (which does mean you need a Google account to use it).

I've found I don't have time to hack around on the Freerunner like I'd
hoped, so rather than let it collect dust, I'd like to get it in the
hands of someone who can. I've most of the original packaging and will
be including all of the original kit (512MB SD, laser stylus, AC, etc)
and the carrying pouch. I'll also include the headset if I can find
it. It's currently running the Qtopia distro. It's in like-new
condition, it's hardly left my office.

I'd like to get $300 for it.

Please respond off list if you are interested

OK, I get it now. I didn't realize that it stored your bash history on the net. 

So what if the problem I am trying to fix is that my nework isn't working?

   Well, now I have an apparent issue with procmail. Messages sent to me
Monday and this morning by an individual are successfully accepted by
postfix and handed off to procmail. But, they are not deliverd to my inbox.

   I've just turned procmail logging back on and asked this individual to
reply to my latest message so I have a test case. I've not before had any
problems with procmail and I wonder if anyone here has had a similar
experience of lost mail.

Thanks,

Rich

Does your PM log show where they did get delivered?
You do have a procmail log file, right?

Do you have a default folder set up?
If not why not?

   I understood that my inbox was the de facto default file. It's been this
way for about a dozen years now and hasn't failed to deliver a message
passed to it by the MTA. If there is something in the procmail man page
about a default delivery file I missed seeing it this afternoon. (There is
reference in the man page of non-matching incoming messages being placed in
the default mailbox, but does not say how that is defined.)

Uh ... internet cafe?  :-)

I don't think that's a problem it can solve, though you can pull
commands off the server:

"Using tags to pull: The shellsink-client application normally just
pushes your commands out to the server, but it can also pull commands
from the server and put them into your history file. If you issue

shellsink-client -pt gloop

"The most recent 20 commands tagged with gloop will be pulled into
your bash history file. This is especially useful for making all the
commands for a particular task immediately available in your history
file."

Still, you would have to have done that *before* your network went down.

I think the main benefit is for people using multiple machines at
different locations, like if you were at PSU on one of their machines
or on your laptop, and you wanted to see the history from your desktop
at home, this would be one way you could do that easily.  Or if you
can't remember what machine you were using when you did this-or-that
command-line fu, this would be a place where you could find it.

But it does mean entrusting your bash history to Google, which could
have security implications.

Rich,

Quick thought, as I seem to remember getting bit by this before, are you
doing anything "interesting" with the messages?  Anything beyond filing
them into a folder.  No Subject (or other header) rewrite etc.  There
were/are some other programs that are used in procmail examples that may
not have been installed and are failing silently.  Try putting a
VERBOSE=3 or higher in .procmailrc.  Should be more info.  I was getting
every test shown until one passed in the log file when I had mine set
higher.

Rod,

   No, I do nothing to the messages. If they're not from a mail list they
dump into my inbox.

   The first line in ~/.procmailrc was VERBOSE=yes, I just changed the yes to
3.

Thanks,

Rich

You only filter on headers?

>From the procmail (and procmailrc second paragraph) man page:
  If no rcfile is found, or processing of the rcfile falls off the end,
procmail will store the mail in the default system mailbox.

  A sample small $HOME/.procmailrc:

  PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin
  MAILDIR=$HOME/Mail      #you'd better make sure it exists
  DEFAULT=$MAILDIR/mbox   #completely optional
  LOGFILE=$MAILDIR/from   #recommended

if DEFAULT is not defined it defaults to $ORGMAIL which defaults to
/var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME

If anyone in this thread gets tired of writing and bugging procmail recipes
by hand, I highly recommend Autoproc.  It's a tool that lets you write your
filtering rules in a much simpler language, then it compiles them and
generates the appropriate procmailrc.

   Close enough:

VERBOSE=3

# Remove ## when debugging; set to no if you want minimal logging; to all

LOGABSTRACT=no

We seem to be straying from the topic of Afters (and Advanced Topics)
at Roots.  This is about pitchers of beer, not pitchers of rocks,
incendiaries, cows, plague-ridden corpses, and other items I hope
we will not invite to Advanced Topics on the 18th.

I will make an exception for the plague-ridden corpses of Steve
Ballmer or Daryl McBride, which are welcome anytime. 
Alive, not so much.

Subject: [PLUG] emacs, svn, and the modeline
Message-ID: <4994DEE3.6060703@seitzassoc.com>

Hi,

Is there anyone here using emacs and svn?  I have the psvn.el package 
installed in order to integrate svn with emacs.  In general, this is 
working fine, but there is one feature of psvn that I can't get to 
work.  psvn is supposed to add a colored dot to the emacs modeline. 
The color of the dot reflects the svn status of the file(up to date, 
modified, etc.).  Here's an example:
http://www.tedcarnahan.com/2008/10/24/a-brief-introduction-to-emacs-psvn/

Unfortunately I don't see the dot at all, despite this variable setting:
svn-status-fancy-file-state-in-modeline's value is t

Ideas?

thanks,
galen

I figured it out.  The fancy modeline requires vc-mode to be active. 
I'm running emacs 21.4, which does not include vc-svn.el.  vc-svn is 
needed in order to get the basic svn status information in the 
modeline.  Once I got that working, the fancy dot showed up as well. 
I downloaded a version of vc-svn.el here:
   http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/contrib/client-side/emacs/
Not that this is not the latest version of vc-svn.el.  It has been 
integrated into the emacs tree and should be included with later 
versions of emacs.

Here's the relevant section of my ~/.emacs

;; Subversion interface
(require 'psvn)
(add-to-list 'vc-handled-backends 'SVN)

Subject: [PLUG] GCC library Incompatibility
Message-ID: <4995CA27.3080204@gisnet.com>

I'm trying to unpack a MrSID image into a geoTIFF using the Linux 
version of the MrSID decode tool that I got from Lizardtech's website 
(http://www.lizardtech.com/download/dl_download.php?detail=geo_mrsiddecode&platform=lin), 
but I got an error that said it was looking for libstdc++.so.5. I don't 
have that, but I do have libstdc++.so.6.0.10. So I tried making a 
symbolic link to that as libstdc++.so.5 and tried again. This time it 
complained about something else:

./mrsidgeodecode: /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.5: version `CXXABI_1.2' not 
found (required by ./mrsidgeodecode)
./mrsidgeodecode: /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.5: version `GLIBCPP_3.2' not 
found (required by ./mrsidgeodecode)

I also tried installing the gcc compatability rpm, compat-gcc-34, but 
that didn't fix things. Lizardtech provides this tool for free, but they 
don't offer tech support on it for free. Is there anything simple I can 
do to get this utility to run with an older version of the gcc library?

Wild guess is lizardtech compiled/linked with the version of libstdc++ 
coded in instead of just libstdc++.

You didn't mention distro, but for Fedora 10, libstdc++.so.5 is provided by:

compat-libstdc++-33

which I found via:

yum provides '*/libstdc++.so.5'

   I'm trying to build gnucash and have installed the prerequisite libraries.
The configure stage fails because it cannot find /usr/lib/slib/:

checking for guile... /usr/bin/guile
checking for guile - 1.6.0 <= version < 99.99.99... yes: 1.8.5
checking for guile - 1.8.0 <= version < 99.99.99... yes: 1.8.5
checking for SLIB support... configure: error:

    Cannot find SLIB.  Are you sure you have it installed?
    See http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=347922
    and http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=483631

   I read the long thread on the first URL above and learned that 1) this
happens on a lot of distributions, 2) has been an issue for at least 2
years, and 3) everyone who manages to resolve the problem takes a different
approach to it.

   I'm using the gnucash.SlackBuild script and the author of that does not
encounter the above problem. We're both running Slackware-12.2 so I've no
idea why the problem occurs here. I've tried specifying /usr/lib/slib/ to
the configurator, but that doesn't work. I've checked for old library
versions stuck in /usr/local/lib that would be seen first, but there is
nothing I've identified as a conflicting library.

   If anyone has thoughts on how to make the scheme library directory visible
so the code is properly configured, I can then build and install the
application and actually use it.

I should think so.

I don't know if this will help.  I use Ubuntu and don't know much about
Slackware.  I had to arrange for slib to appear in the guile installation

The installation info with slib doesn't mention anything about

Tony,

   The URL cited in the error report included problems with Ubuntu, Fedora,
RHEL, Debian, and probably more that I don't recall.

   Regardless, I changed the soft link I had from /usr/share/guile/ to
/usr/share/guile/1.8/ and ...

> AND define environment variable SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH
>    SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/share/lib/guile/1.8
>    export SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH

redefined the SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH from /usr/lib/slib to the above.

> The configuration file executes a scheme statement to verify guile

   I keep running the above, but don't know how to fix it so it doesn't fail:

[root at salmo ]# guile -c "(use-modules (ice-9 slib)) (require 'printf)"
ERROR: In procedure open-file:
ERROR: No such file or directory: "/usr/share/guile/site/slibcat

   I have no directory /usr/share/guile/site, and there is no slibcat on the
system. My Google search suggests that the catelog is not built until scheme
is run.

   The SlackBuild package maintainer has no problem getting gnucash to build
and run on his system but so far I've not been able to identify the
differenc(s) in my system.

   More ideas are certainly welcome!

Thanks,

Rich

   I'd like to understand the factors that might affect web page loading
speed on the laptop here. It's connected wirelessly to the local network,
but I can ping external web sites and get a very quick response time while a
page from that same site can take minutes to load.

   Could this be related to the 256M of RAM? Is there some other factor that
could be affecting the speed? Sometimes all pages load very quickly, other
times excessively slowly. At these slow loading times, I don't see the same
time delay when loading pages on my workstation here.

   Any insights on what factors might be involved will help me determine if I
can get it to consistently quickly load pages.

Yes, the limited RAM can definitely cause exactly what you're describing.
What kind of processor speed do you have in that laptop?

With a modern OS running on 256MB of RAM, you will see a lot of swapping to
the hard drive. Since the hard drive is much slower than RAM, it will take
much longer to do anything.

   I think it's a 500MHz PIII.

   Haven't seeen hard drive led activity, but I don't stare at it, either.

   Well, time to bite the bullet and get to Memory Time. The rarity factor
has driven up the price: $60/DIMM. Sigh.

Thanks for the confirmation,

As others have stated, upgrading the RAM will definitely help.

Also a ping to a webserver tells you nothing about how long it will take to
load a full web page, especially if it is loaded with javascript, flash,
etc.

What distro are you running, and have you tried any other browsers?

At any rate a RAM upgrade, if your laptop supports more, is definitely a
good way to go.

   Did that a couple of weeks ago. They have a few 128M modules, and don't
see 256M ones.

   That's true. I want to ensure that there is an open pipe to the outside
world.

   Xubuntu-8.10. She had been using Firefox and Thunderbird, but is equally
happy with the smaller footprint SeaMonkey.

My knee jerk reaction would be to upgrade the memory as well, but top 
will show you if and how much swap is being used at the moment you're 
wondering. Just look at the summary at the above the processes listed.

   Regardless, doubling the memory to 512M makes sense because the unit still
has a lot of life left. If the extra memory doesn't make a visible
difference then I'll start digging deeper.

   My Toshiba Portege 3025CT was a great little notebook; small and highly
functionsl. However, even after maxing the total RAM -- 96M -- it would not
be suitable for the bloated apps currently available. It did run Slackware
and Xfce very well, but that was about 5 years ago when I replaced it.

         IBM

Subject: Linux Schedulers - Past and present

Rick will be speaking on the Linux scheduler, how it used to work, how it
works now and how to get the most out of it.

Since this is a new location, please be patient with the staff. This is
probably new for all of us.

iPhones and Linux (Some Tips For Preserving Your Sanity)
Hal Pomeranz, Deer Run Associates
6:30pm Tuesday, Feb 17th -- Eugene City Brewery (downstairs)

In early November, 2008, Deer Run purchased Apple iPhones for its
Executive Officers (i.e., my wife Laura and me). Laura was really
jazzed about her "cool new iPhone". My excitement was tempered by the
fact that I knew it was going to take me several days of fiddling to
make the darn phones work with our largely Linux-based infrastructure.
Come hear what I learned through this process and get some tips that
will make things go smoother for you when integrating iPhones even
into mostly non-Linux environments.

Roots has wall sockets along the front wall, on which we will be
projecting.  There are 5 small tables, with 12 chairs, somewhat
near this wall.  One will be used for the projector.  There are
also 5 picnic tables, with built-in benches, each of which could
seat 6 friendly folk.  The picnic tables are about 20 feet from
the front wall.  If these get dragged closer, the person(s) who
does this should remember where they came from, and drag them back.

There is wifi, a "two bar" signal throughout the room.

There are two wall plates with 4 sockets each on the front wall.
The breaker box has about forty 20amp breakers to drive the
whole establishment - I imagine each plate has its own breaker.  
Plenty of power for nefarious deeds.  However, if you at a
picnic table with a power hungry laptop, you will need a long
extension cord to reach the front.   The cord should be white
or brightly colored so people can see it in the dark.  

As Alan said, be gentle with these folks.   After years of
practice, Jax got very good at serving us, and I expect it will
be three or four months before Roots learns how to accomodate us.  
It will pay off in the long term if we are nice to them.

And BTW, Free Geek is about 3 blocks away, and their thrift store
is open until 7pm.  I don't think F.G. has extension cords, but
they do have power strips for expanding the extension cords that
others bring.

Message-ID: <c834ec80902162227l6b7908ddq65959e1b93387fc8@mail.gmail.com>

I need to run some experiments on the full histories of a large number
of wikipedia articles, so I downloaded the only dataset archive
supplied by wikipedia that includes page histories -- the *entire*
data set, as of the time the crawler stopped working. (it's dated Jan.
3, 2008, if anyone is curious, and if anyone wants a copy just let me
know.  It's no longer hosted on the wikipedia servers for some
reason--I don't have a checksum either <sigh> so hopefully it's
actually valid ;)

The problem is two-fold:

   (1) I just don't have enough space.  The 7zip file is 17 gigs, and
the contents will extract to 2.8 terabytes (I know that from
inspection of the 7zip file.)  I *think* I can partially get around
this by using FUSE and cromfs to mount the 7z file as a compressed
filesystem.

   (2) The real problem.... I've had issues running xml/xslt tools on
xml files that were 100's of megs in size.  How on earth do I manage a
2.8tb xml file?  Assuming I can get this zip file to mount as a
filesystem, are there any off-the-shelf tools that will actually
process it?  (I obviously don't have the virtual memory or temp file
space for the whole thing.)  I'm searching for the schema, and hoping
that I can put together sample data to test out xslt transforms on, or
somehow prune the file down to a "manageable" 100gigs or so, but even
then, we're talking about gigantic chunks of xml.

Anyhow, I'm just biting into these problems, but I don't have very
many ideas, so any suggestions would be very welcome.  (For
comparison, our "big" machine here has 300 gigs free, so I am somewhat
interested in suggestions on how to build a 3tb+ filesystem, but as
much fun as that would be, we probably can't actually afford it, so
I'm looking for software solutions first.)

Thanks!
Rogan

I don't know if this is of any use at all Rogan but it looks like someone
was doing something similar in terms of working with the same dataset you
are.

http://hewgill.com/journal/entries/461-wikipedia-blame

In terms of storage, http://www.enuinc.com/

For just over 300 bucks or so you could build a 3TB LVM filesystem to handle
the dataset uncompressed.

I'm seeing a lot of stuff referencing libs and such that you can hook into
but nothing "off the shelf" that would work. I don't have a ton of
experience in XML so I'm looking forward to seeing what you end up coming up
with.

Cheers,

You should be able to stream uncompress on a pipe into any SAX parser 
(e.g. Expat) without needing any sort of huge memory space.  Not sure 
how long one pass will take (with decompression), but you probably 
don't want to be trying anything that's not a streaming extraction.  
Maybe start with just the first several hundred/thousand lines -- 
assuming reasonable line lengths.

The good news is that if you know what you're looking for, you can 
probably get a reasonably small subset of the data out on one pass and 
into something saner than XML!  Perhaps a bdb?

Is there some kind of "wayback machine" on the Internet build /
maintained by someone other than Wikipedia that you could search /
crawl / index, rather than trying to beat this huge, year-old,
possibly invalid data set that's larger than the subset you *really*
want to process into submission? :)

You know, AI is starting to scare me. I am mostly reading my email
with Google GMail these days. At the top of the window where I am
reading this thread and posting replies, there is an unobtrusive but
suspiciously relevant advertisement. I've noticed this before, but
they've always been fairly obvious. For example, on a Ruby mailing
list, I'll get a link to a Rails hosting site.

Anyhow, for *this* thread, I got this:

Parse Big XML - www.roguewave.com/XML - Parse and Process Very Large
XML Documents. White Paper

I would think that the very notion of a huge XML file would assuage any 
fears you might have had that computers were going to become sentient.

If that doesn't do it, try SQL.

Along this same line of thought: instead of attacking bloat with more
bloat, definitely consider eschewing XSL for a lighter weight solution. 
Read the file one line at a time, and use perl or some such to process the
text.  I wonder if it is possible to unzip the file to a pipe, and process
the file as it is unzipping?  In this way, you might be able to avoid
having the entire file unpacked on disk.

Crom-fs and streaming could both achieve this -- in theory.  I'm
trying to put that into practice now, and it's proving more difficult
than one would expect ;)

Thanks for all the suggestions! I'll be back with more details as I
exhaust the options, and hopefully a solution :)

I've also looked into wikipedia's Special:export api, but I don't
think it offers the level of detail I need (It apparently only
provides access to the last 100 revisions)

That would be a lot like using Expat (XML::Parser::Expat), but possibly 
more painful depending on encoding, quoting, and fun.

Yes?  Where did my first mail on the subject go?

`man 7z` implies that `7z x -so` gives you something resembling 
`gunzip -c`

Yup -- I just got that to work.  7z does some "too fancy for my
tastes" pipe detection / etc. that made this trick appear to not work
initially (it won't print the program output to the same stream as the
data, and the program gets priority <sigh>).

This did the trick for getting data to stream:

$ 7z x enwiki-20080103-pages-meta-history.xml.7z -so
enwiki-20080103-pages-meta-history.xml | head -n 1000 >
enwiki-head.txt

(that's one line)

Now to try and figure out the xml schema, and pull data.  I'm working
remotely today, and I haven't tried slurping up a large chunk of data
yet, but so far it looks like this will work.

For what it's worth -- cromfs will not mount a 7z archive in the same
way as a crom filesystem, even if they use the same compression.
(There may be a way, but streaming seems to do the trick.)

   I'm missing a configuration value in /etc/httpd/httpd.conf, but I don't
know what it's called. When I view our web site on the Web, the menu in the
left column is visible, but when I view it locally the menu is not there.

   The code to include the menu is:

     <div id="navigation">
       <!--#include virtual="navlist.html" -->
     </div>  <!-- nav -->

   I have the server-side includes uncommented, but the above needs something
else to be uncommented. And, I have no recollection of what that is. Your
help is needed.

if you browse via a file:///some/path/to/index.shtml type URL, server
side includes won't happen, since the server is not processing the
request.  not sure if you're viewing it locally like that or not.

well, it looks to me to be either server side includes or a difference
in the CSS that styles that div.

are you sure that SSI is uncommented for all accesses, not just some?
for instance if you have a <location> with some allows and some deny's
that includes options +includes, it might not be triggered in all
cases.  also check that your file is of an extension that ssi gets
triggered on (.shtml on my server)?

as well, are you certain that the webserver can read navlist.html and
the CSS style file the same as your userid?

   No, I'm using the browser to access
http://localhost/appl-ecosys/index.shtml.

   But, in /etc/httpd/httpd.conf I see:

ServerRoot "/usr"

which must be different from the document root in
/var/www/htdocs/appl-ecosys/

   As far as I can tell, yes.

   No, the file is navlist.html.

   It always had in the past. It's just worked long enough that I completely
forgot how I set it up to work initially.

Do you have virtual hosts that could be causing requests to
'localhost' to go elsewhere (or go to the same place, but with
different settings) than requests to whatever domain you use remotely?

right, but it is obviously not working now, so something must have
changed.  did you check the permissions in case something has changed?

Rogan,

   There's only the one virtual host. I see the index page (or any other I
specify on the URI line), but no navlist or footer is included. I obviously
broke something.

   Joe Pruitt wrote me off the list and asked to see my httpd.conf. I sent it
to him.

Thanks,

Rich

   They're all 644 or 666 and owned by me.

Any progress with this?

I was looking at possibly using a benito to do this.
http://dorkbotpdx.org/wiki/benito

I also have a teensy that uses the same chip, but has more IO pins available.
http://pjrc.com/teensy/

I found the doc for that chip, and it seems that it has an RFID
interface.  Any idea if it's actually wired up, as that makes it seem
like it might be possible to read without even disassembling the
laptop.

Good ideas.  No, the RFID pins are not used, and the laptops are 
shielded to minimize radio interference anyway.


It turns out I was laboring under a mistaken assumption.  Tony
and I went to Free Geek last Thursday afternoon to demonstrate
the password removal procedure on a few laptops, then begin an
inventory of the laptops that needed it.    Two of Thursday's
laptops used the same password as the two that I had already
worked on.  Those took 1 minute.  One of the laptops was old
enough to store the supervisor password in battery-powered RAM. 
Pull the batteries, wait 5 minutes, and no more password. 
A fourth laptop uses a tiny-pin-spacing (0.025 inch) version of
the Atmel NVRAM chip - the fixture I built only has a 0.05 inch
clip.  The last laptop awaits a finer-pitched clip, though I may
end up doing it with semiconductor wafer microprobes instead.

Then came a surprise.  After we finished the laptops that we had,
we asked if we could see the rest so we could map out the work for
the future.  "Those were all the passworded laptops we had" sez 
our host.  "For the last few weeks?" sez I.  "All we have ever
gotten.  Only a very small percentage have the password set". 

Uh ...

So it turns out I was preparing a sledge hammer to swat a fly. 
The Arduino was predicated on the idea that we would have to
process hundreds of these laptops, and we would need to set
up a simple-as-dirt procedure for technically unsophisticated
volunteers.  As it is, there will only be a few per year, and
they will probably come in batches, all with the same password. 
I don't need to train anybody else to do it.  I can do it (or
Tony Rick can) once or twice a year, and the setup we already
have is usable, if a bit clumsy and M$ polluted.

So thanks for thinking about this, Daniel, but we won't need
an Arduino for password removal.  There are probably other
Free Geek tasks that Arduinos could help with, like cable and
battery testers, so your knowledge can be applied elsewhere.

let HAL mount it, I'm told that the drive doesn't exist in fstab or mtab so
it cannot be mounted.

   But, if I su to root and issue 'mount /dev/hdd /mnt/cdrom' it works.

   What the HAL is going on? It won't automount with HAL, and it will no
longer allow me as a peon user to mount the drive.

   The cdrw drive behaves, by the way.

Puzzled,

Typically /dev/cdrom and /dev/dvd are just symlinks to some /dev/hd?
device.  You might want to double check that it does indeed point to
/dev/hdd.  This could have changed if you swapped out your drive with
another or hooked it up as a slave rather than a master on the secondary
ATA cable, etc.

HTH,

Tim,

   Actually, /dev/cdrom points to /dev/sr0. I've no idea what that is as I've
not seen that series before. I do know that hdd is the cdrom; I don't recall
how I wired the drives, but it worked OK before the distribution upgrade.

   Regardless of whether I specify /dev/cdrom or /dev/sr0 I'm told no medium
is found. The actual line in /etc/fstab is:

/dev/cdrom       /mnt/cdrom       iso9660     noauto,users,ro,unhide  0 0

sr0 is scsi cdrom 0, which could happen for a real scsi cdrom, one using 
the ide-scsi driver, or even a sata drive.  if you run a redhat based 
system, you might want to run kudzu and see if it patches things up.

One little to watch out for: if you issue a command like "mount
/dev/cdrom", you are using fstab to determine mounting options (including
the mount point and mount command options).  If you type "mount /dev/cdrom
/mnt/cdrom", you are bypassing fstab.  Since mount does not need to look
at fstab to figure out missing information, it won't.

If the /dev/cdrom symlink turns out to be valid, maybe try mounting as a
normal user with the former method, thereby forcing a peek into the fstab
file.  That's how you are going to pick up the ro,noauto,user,exec flags.

I noticed a hal update on my gentoo box this morning.  Did you do a recent
update?  Could the behavior of hal have changed?  I saw a message saying
that you have to be a member of the plugdev group.  Might be worth looking
into.

How does pmount behave?

   Ah, so! No, no Red Hat here.

   But that suggests to me how to fix the problem ... yup! That fixed it. I
changed the softlink to point cdrom at hdd. Now it works again.

Thanks, Joe!

Rich, use the noauto option in your fstab entry.  Here's what I have:

/dev/scd0       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0

so just change that /dev/cdrom to /dev/hdd already and be done with it?

   To close, successfully, the thread of a while back about aspell not
finding a word list for 'en_US', I send this note.

   Stumbling around the Web I discovered that aspell no longer comes with a
default word list. Learning this, I pulled out my trusty Slackware-12.2 box
o'disks and on Disk #4 in the /extras/ directory, there is a collection of
aspell words in just about every language known to man. Installing the
English list solved the problem and now I can check the spelling of text in
a text editor.

nm will show you all of the symbols in a library.  I don't think it's 
possible to get any header file information, although there might be 
some information in the debug version of the library.

Display all of the symbols in the .text section:
  nm /lib/libc.so.6 | grep ' T '

...

I just learned something new.  On my CentOS 5.2 machine, 
/usr/lib/libc.so is not a link to the library, it's a linker script.

galens at toto:~$ cat /usr/lib/libc.so
/* GNU ld script
    Use the shared library, but some functions are only in
    the static library, so try that secondarily.  */
OUTPUT_FORMAT(elf32-i386)
GROUP ( /lib/libc.so.6 /usr/lib/libc_nonshared.a  AS_NEEDED ( 
/lib/ld-linux.so.2 ) )

So it looks like you may need to examine multiple library files in 
order to see all the symbols.

To come at it a different way than Galen's suggestion, you could just
read the documentation.

http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/libc/index.html

aside from being a real beast of a manual (quantity-wise), it has
listings of specifically what you asked for:

functions: http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/libc/Function-Index.html#Function-Index
files: http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/libc/File-Index.html#File-Index

the appendices may be more useful to you if you're really looking for
a list, but i used to read the long-form manual while, er, in the
smallest room of the house, if you catch my meaning.  it was in one
such session that i found the funny that is strfry(3), proving that my
time was not entirely wasted =)

Subject: [PLUG] I think my new RAM died
Message-ID: <20090220121931.ade594b7.johnxj@comcast.net>

My Thinkpad T61 had two 1-GB sticks in it for a couple of years. Last
November I replaced them with two brand new 2-GB sticks. 

Everything continued to work fine until this morning. Suddenly
everything was running very slow. I was unable to send a 40 MB PDF file
to a printer, even with the cp command. The System > Administration >
System Monitor GUI and top did not show anything unusual, except that
xorg would cycle up and down between 7-8% CPU and 50-60%. I had been
using Xsane quite a lot over the previous 24 hours, so I suspected a
memory leak. I did free at the command line and it appeared that all
four GB were used up and I was into the 4 GB swap partition.

I started trying to repair the problem by shutting down all running
programs, starting with Xsane. Nothing helped. Eventually I rebooted.
And when X tried to come up I got that endless loop between the nVidia
splash screen and a command line. (I've seen this before on occasion,
althopugh I don't recall if it was my computer or someone else's at the
Clinic.) I couldn't get it to stop the looping long enough to take an
Alt-F1 command, so I rebooted again in recovery mode, and then got a
root command line.

All I did at the command line was switch /etc/X11/xorg.conf from the
nVidia driver to the nv driver by editing it with nano. Then I rebooted
to the normal boot option. When it came up it took forever, but
eventually X came up, I got a login prompt, and here I am back with a
functioning computer (sans nVidia driver).

Side comment: This time the nVidia splash screen did not come up, so I
assume I'm using the nv driver. However, I know that when someone is
using the nVidia driver the text in the login boxes will be very large.
When using the nv driver the username and password asterisks will
appear much smaller. OK, this time I did not get the nVidia splash
screen, but I did get the supersized text. Not sure what that means. A
command to find out which driver I'm actually using at the moment would
be helpful.

But here is the real issue. The computer is running, but it takes way
too long for stuff to happen. Just opening a terminal window takes 30
seconds, where it should pop up in three or four seconds. 

Here is what I get for memory usage:

jjj at Devil7:~$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers
cached Mem:       3988812    3964632      24180          0
16844    2912324 -/+ buffers/cache:    1035464    2953348
Swap:      3903752       2320    3901432

I do not know how to read the above. It appears that it is using all 4
GB or RAM and also some of the swap. Yet I just rebooted. The only
thing that is running is the terminal window and Sylpheed (mail
client). If it is using that much RAM, something is seriously wrong.

Suggestions needed!

when you run top, hit M to sort by memory usage.  that will show what 
processes are using the most amount of memory and you can then debug from 
there.

You could do:

$ sudo cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep LoadModule

That should tell you all the modules xorg has loaded.

You might want to look at the whole log to see if there are any issues
that jump out (look at "EE" for errors and "WW" for warnings).

Have you tried running Memtest86?
Good way to determine if it is a hardware RAM issue.
I usually run at least 2 passes with any new RAM purchase to make sure they
aren't duds (DOA, or static shock or etc).  MemTest isn't perfect but it can
catch a number of problems.

Thanks for all the suggestions.

Unfortunately, hitting M did not disclose anything consuming huge
amounts of RAM. However, I did notice that there was a program called
pdftopdf that was consuming huge CPU cycles. That brought up the
question as to why this program should be running at all. As far as I
know it is a translation thing that CUPS uses when printing to
non-PostScript printers. All my printers are genuine Adobe PostScript.
Also, I had just rebooted and there should be nothing being printed.

And finally a bit more sleuthing and I discovered that the print job
that I had canceled previously was still trying to run, even after
rebooting. I couldn't find the print job to re-kill it because it did
not appear in Manage Print Jobs. So I decided to kill pdftopdf. Shortly
thereafter Manage Print Jobs popped up a notice that there was a
problem printing the print job. And then the rogue print job finally
appeared in the Manage Print Jobs window. Once I killed it everything
went back to normal. 

The free command now says:

jjj at Devil7:~$ free -m
		total	used	free
shared	buffers	cached Mem:	3895	1168
2727	0		39		677 -/+
buffers/cache	451		3444 Swap	3812
6		3806

I still don't understand exactly what the numbers mean, but it looks
like it is using much less.

Having said all that, while the computer is now responding properly, 1)
I don't know what will happen when I reboot - will I still have
problems with X?, and 2) I still can't print the PDF file. I wonder if
the latter problem is another stuck print job. Does anyone know of an
command line tools to find out what CUPS is up to? 'Cause, clearly the
GUI lies.

Message-ID: <20090220152708.ab5748fe.johnxj@comcast.net>

OK, the print queue is not jammed up. I read the man page for lpr and
discovered the -l option. This option says "don't mess with this file,
it is already formatted for the printer, so just send it and shut up."
I was printing to a Phaser 7400DN, which I understand has the new Adobe
PDF print engine (in addition to genuine Adobe PS3 and PCL-something.
Well guess what happened? I sent the obstreperous PDF file with lpr
using the -l option, and a few moments later a single sheet popped out
of the printer. The sheet says "This printer is not configured to
support direct PDF printing. Please use Adobe Acrobat to print your PDF
file."

Well, that's really special. First, either the printer is lying or
Xerox (who sold it to me directly) is lying. Second, it is really
annoying that Xerox tells users that they must print from Adobe Acrobat
for this printer. Not only have I printed to it regularly with the free
Adobe Reader, but I also have at my disposal Okular, Evince and Xpdf,
all of which are FOSS and can print PDF files to it. There is no need
to buy a $350 software package to print to this printer. Grrr.

So then I decided that, as long as I am sure there is nothing hung up
in the print queue, I should try Adobe Reader again. Reader happily
sent the job to the printer, the print job appeared in the Manage Print
Jobs window, and I waited for something to happen at the printer.
Meanwhile I also had top running. Right after sending the print job
from Reader I noticed that top reported that Ghostscript was running,
and consuming huge CPU cycles. I left it alone for a few minutes, then
Ghostscript disappeared and pdftops replaced it, also consuming a lot
of CPU horsepower. I left it for a few minutes longer, whereupon
pdftops disappeared and the print job disappeared from the Manage Print
Jobs window. 

Nothing came out of the printer and its display said "Ready to Print"
throughout the entire process.

So where did it send the print job? (CUPS is properly configured - just
now I printed a document from OOo.) Oh, and I was also monitoring the
ethernet and no bytes were sent anywhere during the process.

And why is an Adobe product using Ghostscript, eh? And pdftops? Too
cheap to write their own software?

I also tried sending the print job with lpr, but without the -l option.
This time top reported that pdftopdf was running and consuming a lot of
CPU time. I watched it until pdftopdf disappeared, However, this time the
print job did not disappear from the Manage Print Jobs window. The
printer still never received a signal and the network device manager
reported zero bytes going out during the process.

what does your CUPS log file (probably handled via syslogd) say?
sounds to me from the lack of ethernet traffic like it's dropping
things on the floor somewhere, and maybe cups has records of it
somewhere that your GUI is not reporting to you?

it (cups) also might be responsible for the pdftops thing, despite
your insistence that cups not mess with the file en route to the
printer.  or not.  funny story, PS is also Made By Adobe, though
everyone else has coopted it by now.

it does seem odd that it is invoking ghostscript and pdftops.  adobe 
reader should be producing postscript and if you set the printer up right, 
cups should send it directly through.  you may want to recheck how you 
configured the printer in cups.  it might also make sense to try a raw 
queue and see if that works any better for this job.

   Ahhh! This looks just like the problem I had printing from SQL-Ledger, and
no other application. Try two things:

   1) In /etc/cups/client.conf specify
 	CUPS_SERVER=localhost

   b) As a user, 'export CUPS_SERVER=localhost' (without the quotes, of
course. You can also put that line in ~/.bash_profile.

   No. Gs provides pdftops, and the printers work with PostScript.

I don't seem to have an /etc/cups/client.conf file. I do have a
cupsd.conf file there, however.

I did use the CUPS_SERVER=localhost command, but it didn't help. Still
couldn't get Adobe Reader to print to the 7400DN (or any other printer).

I don't understand this. The printer in question has genuine Adobe PS
Level 3, plus some version or another of PCL, and (I thought) the new
Adobe PDF print engine. Does Adobe Reader not provide its own image to
the printer? 

However, the above questions are idle curiosity. At the moment I have
the problem resolved with a workaround. I closed Adobe Reader and
opened the PDF in Okular. Okular was just thrilled to send it to the
printer and the printer was so happy to have a file to print that it
output all five copies that I wanted without a complaint.

Perhaps ATT is now implementing some anti-spam measure, like DKIM.  I go
through this same hassle when trying to send mail to a yahoo recipient
from my mail server.  The problem with yahoo is that they are still using
DomainKeys instead of the newer DKIM (at least the last time I checked;
perhaps they have since upgraded).

Try a gmail test.  Gmail uses DKIM.  Send an email to a gmail account, and
then examine the headers of the received email (if you receive it).

Heck, Gmail didn't even greylist my email.  
It's especially aggravating that the only mail from my system to ATT since the
accepted mail on Jan 17 was ... none.  Where did they get the "abuse" from? I
haven't sent any email to one of their clients since the last message they
received. 

If spammers are forging my IP on their packets I'd better buy a lottery
ticket. The odds of that are just too great.

i've been dealing with at&t a bit lately trying to get an entire /20 block 
removed from the blacklist after we got a new block from arin that used to 
belong to adelphia.  after getting some individual ips taken off i thought 
i had finally convinced them to get the whole block removed when suddenly 
the single ips got put back on again.  then a few days later the single 
ips came back off.  so i think that the at&t blacklist may be having some 
issues and that is how you ended up on the list again.

i am a firm believer that these kind of anti-spam measures are far worse 
than the spam they try to prevent.

I am going to guess they have received complaints for the range you're
in and then go overboard and blackhole entire /24's or some such. Or
someone is forging mail headers with your IP in it. I've seen it
happen before at the ISP I used to work for.

An auto response from ATT just arrived.  "We're not blocking your mail."  
And they're not.  As easy as I got on the BH list, I'm off.

go figure.

Subject: [PLUG] Printers and Postscript and ...
Message-ID: <20090221222706.GA28521@gate.kl-ic.com>

I second the general grousing about printers and postscript.  

For years, before the appearance of Acrobat 7 and Firefox 3, I could
print postscript level 2 to my HP Laserjet 4M and things would Just
Work.  I got an HP2605dn color postscript printer, and that Just
Worked too.  While the 2605 is pretty, the toner cartridges are
expensive and chipped.  The 4M toner cartridges are cheaper and
higher capacity, and I can do a refill for $20 (and an occasional
ruined pair of old pants).  So color when I need it, B&W on the
4M, happy happy joy joy.

Now, Acrobat 7 insists on using Postscript level 3, which won't
print on the 4M .  Firefox 3 throws an Invalid Font message on
the 4M , and displays really ugly text on the 2605.   WTF???

Worse yet is that these tools emit Really Ugly postscript.  The
original postcript language is strange and stack oriented, but 
it is readable;  I've written quite a few tools in raw postscript. 
The obfuscated crap turned out Acrobat and Firefox builds deeply
nested macros, sends text embedded in binaries or rendered as
pixels, and in general is nearly impossible for humans to read.
It is also bloated and slow to render.  The new Firefox uses
"cairo" as part of the tool chain, so the "postscript" files
are now even larger and even more obtuse and hard to render.

So I use Firefox 2.0.0.19 and Acrobat 5 a lot.   It would be nice
to have a backend tool that turned postscript 3 into postscript
2 that I could filter the output of the newer tools through.
Or at least some debugging tools that could help me interpret
it.  Unlikely;  it surprises me that printers could ever make
sense of it, much less filter tools and people.

In my spare time, I imagine postscript purgatory, the afterlife
where the programmers that wrote this crap are required to render,
by hand, every page output that ever passed through their godawful
code.  When they finally manage to render every pixel on all the
billions of pages that users worldwide have suffered through, their
work is checked.  If they get every pixel right, they go to Heaven
(to make a few centuries of groveling personal apologies).  

Otherwise, they start over.

Subject: [PLUG] disk problem
Message-ID: <49A2E435.5040105@dslnorthwest.net>

I got a sudden Firefox crash, after which most attempts at anything generated 
the message:

Conf file "/home/xxxx/.kde/share/config/konsolerc" not writeable
           "/home/xxxx/.kde/share/config/kdeglobals" not writeable
Contact your system administrator.

dmsg shows Ext-3 fs error (stb1); remounting file system read only

I finally ran fsck, (not really understanding what I was doing);I told it to 
repair the damage. "Inodes that were part of a corrupted orphan linked list 
found".  Other errors involved Block map and Block count differences.

I am back up with everything appearing normal.

The drive shows one locked folder (lost+found), but it has a modified date of 
19June2008. I have been unable to look inside.

Is lost+found where the error/recovery resides?
Is this a warning that the drive may give up the ghost real soon now?

Denis,

> dmsg shows Ext-3 fs error (stb1); remounting file system read only

This is a pretty clear indication that either your drive is dying or you
did something very bad to your filesystem (many hard reboots,
accidential writes to the raw disk device, etc).  I'm thinking the most
likely is that your drive is dying, since EXT3 is pretty good about
recovering from hard reboots.

To help verify this, check through your dmesg/kernel logs for more
drive failure information.  For instance, the Linux kernel typically
prints out something similar to the following when there are signs of
hardware failures:

hdd: set_multmode: status=0x61 { DriveReady DeviceFault Error }
hdd: set_multmode: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
hdd: recal_intr: status=0x61 { DriveReady DeviceFault Error }
hdd: recal_intr: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
ide1: reset: success 

If you see these, then surely the kernel is having trouble with the
hardware.  The two main explanations are either that the drive is flat
out going bad and is returning CRC errors on sector reads, OR your
cabling is bad and there are CRC errors in messages between the drive
and the controller.  (I'm sure there are other possible explanations,
but I know how to check for these two fairly common issues easily.)

To get more information about such errors, i suggest you use smartctl 
(a part of the smartmontools package on Debian) on the drive.  For
instance, on my drive I get:

# smartctl -a /dev/sda

Each drive will output slightly different values.  I don't konw what
many of these mean, and on my drive, there's a lot of questionably high
values...  However, the two that are most important in my output are
Reallocated_Sector_Ct and UDMA_CRC_Error_Count.  Anything above 0 in the
former may be indicative of a drive being on it's last legs (according
to a Google research paper).  If you have a large number of UDMA CRC
errors, that may be indicative of a bad cable.  Other errors may be
useful if you do the research on them.

For smartctl and possibly for reading your kernel logs, you will need to
have root privileges.

The lost+found folder is where orphaned files are placed after a fsck.
Orphaned files are those which were not deleted normally, but were
unlinked from their parent directory... in other words, files still on
disk but were forgotten about.  You should look through these files to
see if anything of importance is there.  Commonly they'll just be
temporary files (perhaps generated by firefox and the like).  I
encourage you to use the "file" command on them to determine the file
content type, then use an appropriate tool to open the ones you can.
Note that you must have root privileges to look at files in this
directory.

Good luck,
tim

I will also look at the orphaned files.  Should I infer from your comments that 
the presence of such files are likely NOT due to the crash?

Thanks for the ideas.

Huh, that does seem to point toward a cabling problem, but are there any
other messages (that don't have the string "error" in them) before or
after those specific instances?

Well, not exactly.  The files were probably orphaned during the crash.
fsck found them and didn't know what to do with them, so it stuck them
under that directory for you to review at your leisure.

Here are two sections.  (I did not realize that dmesg generates a new set of 
messages during each boot, so I did not save the result from the first boot 
following the crash. But the same errors appear from this boot.)  I shut down 
and reboot often--saving kW.

In a punch drunk state I rm -rf'd a directory that I didn't intend to.
I wasn't unable to immediately unmount the filesystem but was able to
make a complete image of it to a backup device. The fs is ext3 and
google led me to debugfs and I was able to see the deleted directory
and associated inode. It has yet to be deleted as undel inode# said it
was still allocated. My question is. How do I relink the inode to
userland so I can grab the directory and back it up properly :)

if you give your credit card to a site that uses ssl and you don't accept 
ssl certificates that don't fully validate, then you're as safe as you can 
get.  ssl provides end to end encryption (from your computer to the server 
a the other end) so anyone in between can see the bits, but not decode 
them.  but that is all predicated on the fact that the certificate is 
signed by an authority that your browser trusts.  if you see a warning 
that the certificate isn't valid for any reason, then you shouldn't trust 
it and shouldn't give sensitive information to that website.

You'd hope that a credit card purchase would be encrypted end-to-end 
via SSL.

Still, it's difficult to know for sure that any given public wifi 
network hasn't had DNS spoofed -- pointing to rogue servers that can 
launch man-in-the-middle attacks, for instance.

OpenVPN has a coffee-shop mode that can tunnel *all* of your traffic 
back through your home network (assuming it's accessible via the 
Internet). DNS, mail, web -- everything travels encrypted between your 
laptop and home VPN server before being routed to its final 
destination.

Considering the fact that you would be connected to a wide open WiFi not
using any manner of encryption, online purchasing in that type of
environment would be similar to posting your SSN and Credit card numbers
on twitter.

Yes, that would be foolish!  Why take chances like that?  Your only
hope of security is if the web page is SSL encrypted.  SSL has a
mechanism to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, but if that is
defeated, you're screwed.  If I were the type of individual who was
looking to prey on unsuspecting WIFI users, I would head straight for
a hot spot.

if you don't accept bogus certificates and we trust the ssl certificate 
authorities, ssl is supposed to be immune to man in the middle attacks. 
the middle host wouldn't be able to forge a handshake for the domain 
you're trying to connect to.

i guess there are some human factor issues that can crop up. getting 
redirected to micr0s0ft.com and not noticing that the url isn't what you 
expected.

i don't know how the guts of ext3 works, but it is possible that the inode 
unlinking hadn't made it to the disk driver yet.  when you look at your 
copy, the directory is gone?  if the file system had activity, your inode 
could have already been reallocated so that is why it is active.  a find 
-inum will show where it is in the copied filesystem.

The short answer is you can't do this, and it wouldn't help even if
you could because ext3 generally zeroes the contents of the inode
before placing it on the free list.  This means you lose all the block
pointer information that would allow you to reconstruct the file.  I
would recommend trying to use a tool like foremost
(foremost.sourceforce.net) to recover the individual files in the
directory you deleted.

Subject: [PLUG] Problems with resume on X61 tablet (ubuntu)
Message-ID: <c834ec80902251016w890badcw10ccd3ef57a1e120@mail.gmail.com>

I'm running the latest Ubuntu on my X61 tablet, and I have a strange
suspend/resume problem.  Most of the time, suspend/resume works fine
-- closing the lid puts the thing to sleep, and opening it causes it
to resume to the previous state.

However, every morning the following happens:

   *  I resume it in it's ultrabase, disable the screensaver lock, and
eject it from the ultrabase (using the button and level, as directed)
   * Close the lid, let it get sleeping (waiting for the green
moon-crescent to lite up)
   * stow it in a sleeve in my messenger bag
   * travel 15 min by bus to work
   * pull the tablet out, and open the lid.

Now, without fail, the tablet will not wake up fully.  The bezel
lights flash around as they normally do when waking, finally settling
on the battery and the power lights
(http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Image:PowerLED.png).  Normally, it
seems that the wifi, bluetooth, power, and battery lights turn on.

The screen, however, never wakes up, and the computer appears
completely unresponsive.  I've only found two things that will make it
do anything:  plugging it back into an ultrabase causes it to reboot
immediately, and holding the power button for a few seconds will make
it turn off.  This has happened once or twice under other
circumstances, but it's extremely rare aside from this trip *to* work
-- taking the tablet home involves almost exactly the same sequence of
events, but has never caused this problem.

Normally, I would assume that the screen is simply not waking up,
however, I happen to have a script that runs and writes a timestamp to
a file in my home directory every time the laptop is resumed, and that
is not running when I resume the machine -- so it's (probably)
something more nefarious than just a display issue.

I've also not been able to find anything of interest in the
/var/log/messages, syslog or kern.log -- everything looks normal right
up until the "oh, we're starting!" messages begin.  I don't actually
see any indication of the system going to sleep in there, though.

The only environmental difference I know of is that there is no wifi
at work (so I've tried disabling networking before leaving home, and
I've tried letting the system sit at work with it's black screen to
see if it's waiting for a network time out.  Nothing happens until the
battery dies.)

Since it may be relevant:

   * I'm not using gnome / kde / xfce -- I run Enlightenment DR17, and
invoke the gnome-power-manager to handle suspend/resume (it runs in
the background, and is started by my .xsession)
   * This happens with both the 4-cell and 8-cell batteries.
   * I just went through 6 suspend/resume cycles here at work (after
doing the obligatory reboot when I got here) and everything worked
fine, although gnome-power-manager stopped responding and wouldn't put
it to sleep a 7th time until I killed it and started that program back
up.  The 8th suspend-resume worked fine too.  I rarely put the machine
to sleep more than 4 times per day, for reference.
   * I have an ultrabase at home and at work, and when at those
locations, it spends most of the time in the ultrabases. (which are
connected to the wall for power.)

I would *really* like some suggestions on how I can debug this
problem.  It's driving me nuts, since I loose all my state every time
I go to work, and the only way I've been able to reproduce the problem
is by traveling to work.  (I've spent a lot of time doing
suspend/resume cycles to fix a different bug -- relating to the stylus
calibration, and this only happened a few times out of the hundreds of
cycles I did then.)


Thanks!
Rogan

Hal,
Thanks. I have foremost installed. My problem is that I'm not certain of all
the file types in the directory. If I recall correctly they were mostly perl
scripts. I had read somewhere that I could just tell foremost to grab ASCII
files which would include said perl scripts.

I have rebooted the machine with said filesystem unmounted now. I also have
the disk image I created which is just under 100GB since I dd'd the
partition. Would it be advisable to use foremost on the disk image or the
actual filesystem while unmounted in order to collect the data?

Thanks,
Drew

Meh.  Foremost is not generally good at ASCII text files.  You might
try "-t cpp" which grabs C source code.  I suspect Perl is close enough
that you'll get some hits.

Otherwise you may be stuck with using tools like dls from the Sleuthkit

Doesn't hurt to try both.  The disk image might be corrupt because you
took it from a running file system.  OTOH, the file system might have
re-used some of the data blocks between the time you took the image
and the time you got the file system unmounted.

By the way, I also have to be a PITA and point out that you wouldn't
be going through any of this pain if you had backups on hand.  Consider
spending $125 on an external 1TB drive and a little of your time 
implementing an automated backup strategy.

Hopefully. It's not the end of the world but I'd like to get them back.

I have Sleuthkit installed also but didn't see dsl as one of the install

Funny as it is, I have an external drive attached to the machine already. I
was doing some housecleaning so that I could then have a clean "tree" as it
were to start my backups.


I do appreciate your advice/information though it is greatly appreciated =)

It's "dls", not "dsl".  If you have a newer version of the Sleuthkit,
the "d" tools have been renamed with the "blk" prefix: try "blkls".

since #! /usr/bin/perl is always on the first line of a file you can
probably speed it up by using seek to only look at the beginnings of
blocks.  So something like this. Would give you a list of byte offsets
for the beginnings of perl files.  UNTESTED!

#!/usr/bin/perl

my PARTITION;
open(PARTITION,'<','/dev/sda1');

while(seek (PARTITION,512,1))
{ if(qr{^#!\ */usr/bin/perl}){print tell(), "\n";}}

I've often had better stability and responsiveness if the network is off 
and the wifi driver is unloaded before suspend.  Recent Debian seem to 
get that automatically, but perhaps I've tweaked something and 
forgotten it.

You might try unplugging your wifi access point at home while suspended 
and see if you can replicate it there.  Or in a metal box?

Is it possible that the ultrabase (driver) is involved?

Joe hit the nail on the head.

SSL/TLS can protect you perfectly well, in theory, regardless of how
unsafe the network is.

However, there are a number of gotchas in practice.  You need to ensure
at least the following:

- The site's certificate validates correctly, with no warnings
  whatsoever, as previously mentioned.

- The site is the one you think it is.  SSL's authentication only
  attempts to guarantee that the system you're communicating with
  matches the domain name it's hosted at.  If you're sending sensitive
  info to a phishing site, such as paypa1.com, then you have no
  protection.   Of course that applies to ALL transfers of sensitive
  information, not just ones over an insecure wireless link.

- You disable SSL version 2.  Recent versions of browsers have this off
  by default.

- The site you're communicating with sets the "secure" cookie flag on
  all sensitive session cookies.  This is a pain to check sometimes.  If
  you view the cookies for the site in firefox, there is a line
  indicating what kind of connection they may be used for.  This should
  indicate encrypted/secure connections only for all cookies.  If you
  don't see this, then it is remotely possible that your session could
  be hijacked by a man in the middle or a passive sniffer.

- The site you're communicating with has a login form served over SSL.
  Many major sites, for a long time, would serve their login form over
  HTTP which posted to HTTPS pages.  This is really really unsafe when
  it comes to man-in-the-middle attacks.

- ... probably a handful of other things ...


So, while I disagree with Tim and Carlos in their paranoia, you can see
why one might think it's very unsafe to do these kinds of transactions,
for the typical user, over an insecure wireless link.

However, consider for a moment the issues with WEP and WPA-PSK.  If
you're using a single password for a wireless network, then every user
of that wireless network can still conduct man-in-the-middle attacks on
you.  For all of the attacks listed above, these kinds of networks DO
NOT PROTECT YOU.  

The perpetual problem with secure protocols is not the protocols.  It is
the authentication.  No one wants to deal with the hassle of giving
every individual user a separate WPA password, so they don't.  Well that
also means all users can muck with all other users of that network.
SSL's PKI is weak and fragile, but it's still better authentication than
a shared password amongst a bunch of random customers...

To get the wifi module to suspend and resume correctly in Debian I had to
create a file
 /etc/pm/config.d/wireless
which consists of a single line
SUSPEND_MODULES="ndiswrapper"

I don't think this will fix the black screen problem though.  I had a
problem with a black screen on resume with an HP Pavilion dv6000z. There
were many suggested fixes I found, but the only thing that really fixed it
was upgrading to a 64 bit system with a 64 bit kernel. This cured all my
suspend/resume problems except the wifi which was solved with the pm tweak
above. 64 bit may have not been necessary, probably just a newer kernel
would have solved the problem, but I did both switches at once.

Hmm, you are touching on some great ideas for wireless security, perhaps
if wireless devices can integrate certificate based
authentication...certificates that also use a pin (this as a layered
feature inside of the WPA cloud).  I am going to start combing through
the web to see if there are vendors out there providing wireless
solutions with two factor authentication.

This still does not fully address endpoint security though, as one is
still responsible for ascertaining security between their computer and
the target site.  But it would be a good starting point for mitigating
mitm attempts.

I've had good results with ext3grep:

http://www.xs4all.nl/~carlo17/howto/undelete_ext3.html

ext3grep $IMAGE --dump-names
and

were particularly helpful.

Yeah, I'm not as familiar with the more advanced modes of WPA, such as
EAP, but there are certainly much safer variants.  It's just that you're
highly unlikely to find that used at a coffee shop.

It would be cool to see a WPA-PSK AP to be integrated with OpenID or at
least with an interface that easily allows random, short-lived one-user
passwords to be generated and used securely in an environment like that.

The list of things I mentioned one needs to check are definitely a
problem with software implementations.  The fact that browsers even
*give you the option* to accept an invalid certificate is a huge issue.
If they had simply rejected these from day one, site admins would get
their act together and get certs (via public CAs or ones users could
install once).

Session cookies distributed over SSL should just never be sent over
non-SSL connections by browsers.   But since they have been for historic
reasons, site admins have expected this, they have to explicitly set the
secure flag to be secure.

At least SSLv2 is finally being phased out... SSLv3 has been available
for what, 10+ years?

I could go on and on, but yeah, it's definitely an end-point issue and a
user education issue more than anything with SSL/TLS.  If you know what
you're doing, you can be perfectly safe, but most people don't.

cheers,
tim

I'm working with that now. I appreciate everyone's input. I've never
dealt with a fs issue like this before and if I lose the data then its
a lesson learned. However it is a good exercise for any future issues
if they god forbid happen.

Okay this is tested, and works to find the byte offsets of perl files.
 Don't have a good extractor to go with it.

Thanks Daniel! I'll give it a spin and see what happens. As Hal mentioned
earlier the image I created might have been corrupted (which it turns out it
was) I was able to fix it with e2fsck, which may have done more damage in
terms of getting my data back but we'll see. I did manage, using sleuthkit
and foremost to grab some data albeit with some issues in the files but the
recovered data was useable enough to restore some of the missing data.

Glad I'm learning the lessons and techniques now on non-mission critical
data instead of something really blowing up and causing issues for me. I'd
really like to invest in a Netapp Filer to go along with this server but the
drive capacities available are pretty small for the heads that I can find on
ebay that are cheap enough for me to afford right now given that I'm not
working. The machine I have is physically located in the Infinity Internet
Data Center in Downtown, not a home machine where I can attach some non-rack
mountable SAN/NAS device.

The issue there is the rent-seeking CA's.  If the CA-signed certs

SSL *is* a manner of encryption, and the preferred one for online
purchasing.  Open wireless is also preferred in some quarters for its
community benefits.  Relying on any wireless encryption just ignores
all the other hops your packets are taking.

All the protocol security issues/certs etc have already been brought up in
the thread which are all very valid and good points. What might consider
given the situation with everything involved between SSL certs for the
sites, open AP's and such is just purchase a reloadable credit card for web
purchases so that it someone does capture the information then you're not
going to end up having to deal with the problems associated with credit
reporting agencies or someone draining your bank account etc.

Or perhaps get an account with freeshell.org or some other provider that
would allow you to run a proxy process so that you can use an ssh tunnel for
your browsing activity while out in the wild.

Since virtually every online transaction that involves money *is* SSL
encrypted, then it becomes un-foolish again.  These things were pretty
much solved _years_ ago.

The biggest wifi security problem we see is people checking their
email from pop3 servers and the like.

--restore-all --after seem to be very useful. It dumped a large amount of
data that was good to go before tanking for some unknown reason, I believe
space constraints but I'm not sure yet. At least I know I have a usable
image and that I can restore some data from it. I'm just hoping I can get
what I want restored.

Thanks to all for your valuable help and insights.

Yeah, it's true. That comment was sort of tongue in cheek since I know
that under the current CA regime it would be impossible for the little
guy to put certificates on everything.

There are some major issues with SSL's all-or-nothing PKI.  If there are
problems with any one certificate in your browser's CA list, all
websites are now vulnerable.

CA certificate distribution is almost completely driven by browsers and
the money they may or may not charge to get a CA added to the list.   If
we had a better way to compartmentalize trust, such as is used in PGP's
web of trust, then it wouldn't be as scary for users to add different
networks' CA certificates to their browsers.

I think there have been some attempts to do this before, but none have
caught on well.  I place much of the blame on browsers, all of them, for
not providing a more flexible authentication heirarchy.

I hadn't had a chance to jump in earlier, but thought I would mention
you can try out scalpel <http://www.digitalforensicssolutions.com/Scalpel/> 
instead of foremost if it isn't working for you. It's supposed to be a
somewhat improved version of it.  If you craft your own file header
rules for the perl scripts, or any other files, you should be able to
get quite a bit of your data back.

You of course have to edit that to point to the right partition as I
didn't create an interface yet.  Also it just gives you the byte
offset to what it found.

I just got some code working to dump a file from a byte offset.  It
doesn't have an interface yet, but I thought you might be interested
in some progress.

On my system it is copytoeof.cpp.  Compile with "g++ copytoeof.cpp -o copytoeof"

#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

long blockoffset = 41420800; // where I found a perl file

int main()
{
  ifstream partition("/dev/sdb2",ifstream::in | ifstream::binary);
  partition.seekg(blockoffset);
  unsigned char c;
  ofstream writefile("foundfiles/file_cout",ofstream::out | ofstream::binary);
  while (c = partition.get())
    if(c != 0)
      {
	writefile << c;
      }
    else
      {
	break;
      }
  writefile.close();
  partition.close();
  return 0;
}

   I've had several experiences (e.g., trying to register online for
conferences) where the site says it's a secure link, but I don't see the
color of the URL and status line change from white to yellow, and I don't
see the locked padlock in both places.

   When I call the organization/business they try to tell me it really is

Ah.. that did help narrow things down a bit!  I can reproduce the
problem at home by:

   * removing the tablet from the ultrabase
   * putting it to sleep (closing the lid, and waiting a few min.)
   * unplugging the power from my WAP
   * wake the laptop up (while not in the ultrabase)

This *only* happens on the first suspend/resume from the dock, and
only if the wap goes away while the tablet is asleep.

It seems like it must be involved somehow.  It's been a long day, so
I'm still absorbing implications of all this - I'll try to pursue some
more options tomorrow (rmmoding the wifi drivers/ultrabase driver on
sleep and insmoding them on resume, anyway.)

Subject: [PLUG] ECC RAM failure data   - jre
Message-ID: <1235647715.26727.1302505341@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Do you use ECC RAM? Do you have any data about failure rates?

I'm evaluating this for a system with 8GB DRAM, &
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random_access_memory#Errors_and_error_correction
says
"Tests[ecc]give widely varying error rates, but about 10-12upset/bit-hr
is typical, roughly one bit error, per month, per gigabyte of memory.

In most computers used for serious scientific or financial computing and
as servers, ECC is the rule rather than the exception, as can be seen by
examining manufacturers' specifications."


So, for that data 8GB DRAM is about 8 errors per month, ie about
one per 3-4 days.

What rates do you have?

Do people use Java Web start with Ubuntu? I'm running Hardy and I did  
get it to work, but it does not work out of the box. I wanted to run  
the example at
  http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/javawebstart/ 
demos.html
I have Sun's Java ... not the one that comes with Ubuntu.

To get this to work I had to
1.
As root go to my /opt/sunjava6_u3/jdk1.6.0+03/jre/lib/i386/xawt (which
is just where I installed java) and issue

sed -i 's/XINERAMA/FAKEEXTN/g' libmawt.so
Reasons for this I somewhat but do not fully understand.

2.
Install libstdc++.so.5 .... apparently the 5 is important.

Webstart works for me on Ubuntu Intrepid.  But I had problems with both
old applications like Matlab as well as Netbeans.  The route I took was
to downgrade to libx11-6 1.1.1.1 (Gutsy, I think).  See:

This apparently doesn't work if you have a Hardy or Intrepid X11... at
least it didn't work for me.  Or, perhaps it does and I just didn't do
it right.  I kept getting problems with libxcb.

I run Hardy on my Mac Book Pro under Parallels. All the demos now work  
for me. After I did the two steps I listed earlier, not before. It was  
very frustrating to find this out. Most of the people in the Java  
group are straight Mac users (majority) or Windows users (minority)  
and don't deal with Linux issues. I was amazed that it didn't work  
right off ... Java being so key to opensource.

In fact before I applied those steps I could not even invoke "javaws -

Did you try using an ubuntu-packaged java install? (eg: sun-java6-jdk?) Why did you choose to do the install manually (or automatically into /opt...)?

The only problems I've had with java on Ubuntu have been caused by GCJ installs -- which have *never* worked for me, and frequently cause me increased frustration and lost time.  

If you have gcj installed, you'll need to remove it (highly recommended ;) or change your java defaults with update-alternatives.  (and there are a number of them that, afaik, need to be changed individually.  You can see them in /etc/alternatives )

Some sites use SSL encrypted *forms* just for submission.  So you end
up with a non-SSL page that you type your info into, and when you hit
the submit button the info is sent to a SSL URL.  Theoretically this
would be secure, but there are security problems with this which was
recently discussed at BlackHat (see http://www.doxpara.com/?p=1269 and
https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-dc-09/Marlinspike/BlackHat-DC-09-Marlinspike-Defeating-SSL.pdf).
 Mainly you can downgrade the connection, and also you can inject
javascript into the non-SSL page and sniff the data from the form.

Jason

Yeah, this specific item is old news.  My coworker and I once wrote a
simple MitM script for this specific issue in Yahoo!'s login form before
they started making it SSL by default.  All we did was change the form
destination to our own CGI script.  The CGI script responded with a
redirect which sent the user's browser back to the proper SSL page.
In most browsers, the users will never know the difference.  It's a
trivial attack, and quite fun to demonstrate.

I guess the reason for installing sun java manually is that I often  
want to have several versions of Java JDK available and then point my  
Eclipse or Hudson to different JDKs. I think (or hope!) that I have  
removed all of GCJ.

I would love to see a talk on the ins-and-outs of NetworkManager, and how to get it to actually work.  It *seems* like a great idea (what little I know about it) but I have nothing but issues when it comes to associating with common APs, determining if we're online or not, and apps with "off-line mode" like Firefox and Pidgin (which has no user-accessible toggle, as far as I can tell).

Thanks for the link!

That might be really interesting even for a technoidiot like me. Mostly
I just want to know how I can get and stay connected at PSU. I can
connect instantly and stay connected reliably anywhere else, but after
they did stuff(1) to the wireless network last summer it has become a
pain to get and stay connected.

Maybe if I knew more about how these things work it would help.

(1) Stuff = rearranging the wireless network in ways of which I have no
ken and, apparently, of which PSU's tech support has no ken either.

Sometimes I use T-Mobile's Total Internet to obtain a connection when nothing else is available, using ActiveSync with a USB connection on a Windows laptop. Now I am thinking about getting a netbook, but it would save money if Linux was an option. 

When I connect the phone to a desktop running Ubuntu 8.10, with no other network connection present, it reports that a connection has been made (and so does the phone), but I am not able to browse the Web. Is anyone familiar with this application?

Subject: [PLUG] back to basics (some advice sought)
Message-ID: <49A84EC7.3060502@writemoore.net>

For a variety of reasons too numerous to go into, I'm getting a yen 
really to simplify computing things as much as possible -- within 
reason, I guess, though maybe even unreasonably at first.  Call it a 
learning experience.  2 thousand 0 0 party over oops out of time, 
tonight we're gonna compute like it's 1999.

So I'm looking at various elements I have installed, currently, which is 
already much reduced from what I had installed in the past, and 
wondering what else I can free myself from.  It's a little more 
difficult to figure out, in some cases, than I thought it would be.  I 
think this is partly due to the inexorable march toward automation and 
"ease-of-use" efforts brought to bear on the Linux ecosystem in recent 
years.

Case in point:  the display manager.  I can't really find a good 
explanation of what is does in a single-user/simple-needs/home-user 
set-up, aside from provide a pretty place to type in one's user name and 
password.  The [1] Wikipedia entry and some [2] TLDP guides explain its 
usefulness in situations involving dumb terminals and multiple screens 
or monitors; Carla's excellent "Linux Cookbook" explains how to change 
it (Problem: "You don't like your login display manager, and you want to 
try a different one") and how to use 'startx' instead, but not what 
using a display manager gets you; even the [3] SLiM (which calls itself 
a "login manager," rather than a "display manager") website says SLiM 
"is suitable for machines on which remote login functionalities are not 
needed" without saying, exactly, what it does that 'startx' doesn't do 
or what a display manager does that it doesn't do, beyond "remote login 
functionalities."  Though it also says this, which I don't understand: 
"Single (GDM-like) or double (XDM-like) input control."  What does that 
mean?

So, assuming I'm not interested in a multi-head setup, not connecting to 
remote terminals or something, not at all put out by logging in from a 
console rather that a pretty screen with flowers and butterflies, nor by 
editing .xinitrc if I want to change my window manager, do I really need 
a display manager?  Are there any other essential or desirable functions 
I'd be missing?

I just thought, since most distros seem to use one by default, it must 
do Something Important.  But I don't know what that might be.

My understanding is that it is a security-related.  I can't test this
at the moment, but I think you can kill X with the 3-finger salute
(ctrl-alt-bksp) even when a screen locker is running. If you're using
a login manager that launches X directly, then killing X just puts you
at a login prompt.  However, if you're launching X from a logged-in
shell, then killing X puts you at the current user's command prompt.
Now, if you give someone you don't trust physical access to your
machine, they can wreak all kinds of havok, anyway, but it takes
substantially less time to do so if they can get directly to a prompt
with one keystroke.

Granted, that may still not be a huge concern -- it all depends on your useage.

its all about personal preference.  I totally lock my laptop down so
that it only comes up in console mode only with everything in place
(encrypted file systems, bastille, noshell, etc) and try at all possible
to conduct all my internet activity using console based tools only. 
Snownews for rss, mutt for mail, lynx for web, why they even have
calendars, project planners, and so much more that can be done using
console or curses based environments.  No eye candy but I can get my job
done and have a lot less exploitable applications running.  I suppose if
I wanted to be extremely paranoid I could run each and every one of
these applications in a chroot but too much work.  If and when I am
forced to use a desktop environment (such as a java based web page -I
can't wait until someone builds a curses or text based browser that can
run java), I resort to using startx with XFCE4.  Login managers use
unnecessary resources and can easily be done without imo.

However, if you have a serious high power computer and have a need to
use multiple desktop environments (KDE, Gnome, XFCE4, etc), then a login
manager is necessary.

the easy workaround for this is to run startx as "exec startx" so that
when X dies/is killed, the login prompt is all that comes back.

Simply put, they handle graphical login. Some of the more
sophisticated ones, like GDM, allow for remote login, timed login, and
other shiny things. A lot of shiny things you probably don't need,
want, or care about. And they are things most people don't care about.
They do care about a pretty login screen though, so distros use them.


<Devil's advocate>

For me the question becomes, "Why not use it?". It's already there.
For my use, it's functionally the same as any other login method, and
offers no perceptible drawbacks[1]. Removing it would simply be more
effort without real purpose, which seems it would be counter to your
"simplify" mantra. Isn't the goal of simplicity to make things be less
work?

-QH-


[1] - Sure it consumes some resources, but come on, it's not 1999. I
don't care about something that is consuming some fraction of a single
percent of my "mostly-idle most of the time anyway" computer's
resources. Computer time is cheap, my time is not.

Under normal operation in a data center environment on high quality
server-class hardware, I'll see one or two ECC corrected single bit
errors per quarter on hosts with 24GB+ of RAM.  When RAM is on its way
out, those rates go WAY up even though it's still functional.

Under harsher circumstances (e.g. non-data center) the rates are
probably higher, but I have no hard data on them.

After corrupting many TB of data on one of my home systems (yes,
including backups) due to creeping memory problems, I think it will be
a while before I skip ECC for cost reasons again.

Michael,

   You're approaching this from the wrong end. The first question for you to
answer is what you want to do that requires (or is facilitated by) the
computer. If the answer is 'nothing' then perhaps an Etch-A-Sketch(R) is
more appropriate.

   When you have a list of things to do on the computer, make a list of the
tools you can use for each one. Then consider how they may interact, what
would make it easier and more productive for the time you spend on the
computer, and how you prefer to work.

   Then you can decide if you want a GUI desktop/window manager or you can do
everything by logging in on multiple terminals. Regardless of what you
decide, you do not need to log in via a GUI (KDM, GDM, XDM). You can log
into a terminal then manually run 'startx' when you desire.

I appreciate the advocacy.  :-)

The reason is I'm figuring on doing a minimal reinstall; that is, on 
Debian anyway, installing just the base system and proceeding from 
there, installing what I need.  So it's not so much a question of 
removing what's already here as it is, should I reinstall this?  And the 
reason for that is, as I intimated, primarily as learning experience. 
I'd kind of like to work a bit with the bare bones to get to know them 
better, then add more bones and some flesh as I learn.  I don't really 
want to go the whole Linux from Scratch route -- not enough time, 
energy, or interest to do that with a system I probably would get tired 
of trying to maintain anyway.  I want a sandbox, but I don't want to 
have to haul in the sand.

I've been using Debian for a while now, am pretty wedded to it I think, 
and it is sufficiently complex (to me, anyway) that by the time all 
these extras and do-dads are layered on top, I really don't understand 
very much about what's going on, especially when it comes to solving 
problems.  It's like trying to learn anatomy by poking at a full-grown 
person -- it's really easier if you start with a skeleton.

My approach to problem-solving has been: 1) Google, 2) mailing lists and 
newsgroups, 3) reference books.  These have mostly come through for me, 
but it's left me with a spotty, haphazard and incomplete understanding 
of how this Linux thingy really works.  And considering how long I've 
been using Linux, I'm pretty disappointed with myself that I don't get 
more of it and haven't advanced beyond where I am.  I've no tech

Yes, but I would like to invest some time in learning what uses those 
resources.  I'd like to see, what does 'top' look like with a minimal 
install?  What does it look like after adding various capabilities?  How 
do system configurations and directories change?  At what stages do all

which got dramatically better when I got rid of GNOME.  I'd like to get 
to the bottom of the problem (which may very well be, I need a new 
something-or-another, probably motherboard or power supply or CPU).

I still have some more ducks to row before I do this.  I can learn 
plenty with what I've got going, and intend to practice some more with 
certain CLI and ncurses apps, some bash lessons, some perl practice, so 
that I'm not lost in the dark with a minimal system and don't reinstall 
everything in a panic.  That's why I'm taking a closer look at what I've

I *highly* reccomend doing one LFS install, and using it for a week.

Doing the LFS install was the single most enlightening linux
experience I've ever gone through, and 2-3 weeks after installing it,
I blew it all away anda put debian on, but it was still well, well
worth the effort.

That's pretty close to what I am trying to determine -- how do things 
interact, what do I find easier, more productive, more enjoyable to use.

That's exactly why I was asking the question -- I couldn't find anything 
that said "You need a display manager because..." it provides 
this-or-that function I already know I need, or it interacts with 
something I already know I need in a certain way that makes that thing 
function better, or provides extra something-or-other.  So I was coming 
to the conclusion that, nope, I don't need it.  But these are complex 
things, these operating systems, and I thought I might be overlooking 
something.

Roger brought up one issue I hadn't come across, security, but in my 
present circumstances, the potential problems he pointed out aren't 
really a concern.  If someone breaks into my apartment, I will have more 
to worry about than can he gain access to my user login.  And if my cat 
gives X the 3-finger salute and gets a command prompt, I doubt he'll be 
capable of using my credit card to order cases of Greenies.

So it looks like, for my purposes, no, I don't need a display manager.

Hooray!

garrrrr... correction to that last reply ... I typed "Roger" ... I meant 
"Rogan."

Clearly, I may not need a display manager, but I do need a brain.

Michael,

   I've preferred the CLI (command line interface) since I stopped punching
80-column Hollerith cards on the 029 Keypunch and accesing the DEC System/10
via a gen-u-wine Teletype 1011 terminal. But, I find it much more productive
working with Xfce and its multiple desktops.

   I keep 4 virtual consoles open on two virtual desktops, and do all sorts
of administrative and writing in them using joe. I can cut and paste among
the terminals as well as with alpine (mail), web pages (firefox), coding
(emacs), serious writing (LyX/LaTeX), and my sales tracking tool (built from
TreeLine). Much, much more productive and convenient than working logged
into multiple terminals.

   However, I use the computer to run my business and not just to learn more
about linux, networking, or security. I passed through that phase a long
time ago.

Rich

I had missed that nuance. Based on your expanded explanation, I think
this would be a great, useful exercise. And to simply answer the
"core" question (again?), no, you do not "need" display manager for
"normal" single-user installs. I ran without a display manager for
years and years, and was never at a disadvantage for it.

But.

Unless you already have multiple computers, and perhaps even if you
do, consider doing your paring and learning in a virtual machine.
VMware server and Virtual Box are free and quite capable
virtualization environments. Vbox would be a better choice if your
experimentation will tend to be "desktop" oriented because it has
better multimedia capabilities than vmware server. Vmware server would
be better if you will be more "server" oriented because it handles
varied network configs a bit more easily and gracefully. If you are
looking for another interesting learning adventure, KVM may also be
good choice, as it is emerging as a contender for the de-facto
virtualization system on Linux going forward.

regardless of which you choose, the odds of you ending up cornered
because you tatered your primary computer are much smaller, which is
always a good thing.

A good way to give your machine a workout is to use Breakin from
Advanced Clustering. It might help you isolate your hardware problems.
And, if you are feeling adventurous, building it from source is an
interesting learning exercise as well.

Thanks for the advice.  Virtualization and the various methods for doing 
that is yet another thing I've been meaning to try, and will make a 
point of doing so before I reinstall.

I do have an old iMac on which I dual-boot a dated (and increasingly 
semi-useless) version of OS X and Debian (PPC, recently upgraded to 
Lenny).  It's not exactly a joy to use, but it has gotten me out of jams 
when I've mucked something up on my main computer and need to figure out 
how to fix things.

I'll check out Breakin.  I already had this machine looked at by 
professionals, who suggested it was probably the video card, which I've 
replaced.  That made things better for a while, but then the problem 
(machine freezes, keyboard and mouse is unresponsive) started coming 
back.  Then I removed GNOME, switching to Openbox, and no more freezes, 
until two days ago, when it did it again.  There's no pattern to it. 
It's always the same problem -- machine is working great, then just 
freezes -- but there's no obvious trigger, like heavy load or 
problematic application(s).  Once, but only once, I got the blinking 
keyboard lights that I believe indicates a kernel panic.

Cool!  The only downloads I could find were 64 bit versions.  It would
be nice to build a 32 bit version of this for the linux clinic, where
64 bit machines are scarce.  A few minutes of searching failed to
locate the sources.  Suggestions?

Anyone have any way's to detect that cd has been inserted?

I've poked around the /proc and /sys directories and I haven't found

This is running ubuntu-server intrepid.

the general info you want to be googling is hotplug.  it handles removable

Sometimes I use T-Mobile's Total Internet to obtain a connection when nothing else is available, using ActiveSync with a USB connection on a Windows laptop. Now I am thinking about getting a netbook, but it would save money if Linux was an option. 

When I connect the phone to a desktop running Ubuntu 8.10, with no other network connection present, it reports that a connection has been made (and so does the phone), but I am not able to browse the Web. Is anyone familiar with this application?

   I thought hotplug was replace by HAL; perhaps HAL-9000 if you're running
Microsoft.

hotplug is the very low level kernel interface.  hal is the userland stuff
