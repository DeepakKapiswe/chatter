I've been happy with my Logitech optical notebook mouse.
http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2142,CONTENTID=8142

Unlike most of the recommendations so far it has a cord (which wraps
around the base of the mouse for storage).

PS: Shouldn't a cordless mouse be called a hamster?

Thank you to every one who responded.  The decision for this go round is ... Kinkos.j

Show up with a PDF on a USB thumb drive and for small jobs print to the HP color
laser in the PC area for 99 cents a page.  For larger jobs turn over to the
counter folks for printing.  Duplex is available.  Having it run by the counter
folks is something like 86 cents a page for 8.5x11.  Scaling to other sizes
available.

Summary of responses:
Samsung makes a reasonable printer.
Epson gives the option of specialty inks if you have archival concerns.[1]
HP and Epson are the suggested lines, http://www.linuxprinting.org/suggested.html
Carla's links are a wonderful overview.
Canon, if you can get the driver, has the lowest cost for ink.


[1] If you've ever enjoyed looking at old photographs you've benefitted from
archival processing.  I'm right now scanning color photos from the 60s that are
yellowed and have other color shifts.  The lack of archival color process from
that era is hurting.  We're talking less than half a projected lifespan here. 
Your family photos should outlive you.  EndOfRant.

WTF?  I ask people in my community if they have any good or bad things to say
about a product and you construe that as a request for consulting services?

THANK YOU RON!
I understand the security implications of bad code.
The "PHP is insecure" statement seemed to imply that there was something
inherent I the PHP engine that caused all systems using PHP to be
vulnerable.
>From your explanation below I gather this is not the case.
Perhaps the statements about PHP insecurity stem from common configuration
and coding practices with PHP.
I'll take care when I try it out.

Short? Aw geez....

Okay, here's the shortest summary I can come up with:
1. User submitted data is insecure by nature.
2. PHP makes it really easy to do things with user submitted data.
3. PHP also runs (typically) in the UID of the web server, thus, if you 
have 50 users on one server, they all have the *exact* *same* *perms*.

Longer? Well, that's where the meat is. Let's look at perl tainting, 
variable types and scoping, and secure programming practices, and then 
perms.

First up at bat: Tainting.
In PHP, by default, a script can use:
<? if ($foo = "yes") { bar();} ?>

Perl, OTOH, is kind of protective, and will throw a warning depending 
on whether or not $foo comes from user-supplied data, or a server 
script. PHP often doesn't care. Of course, a savvy programmer will 
actually *check* where data is coming from, and *validate* the data 
used. Using register_globals can help a bit, as can making sure that 
all server variables are initialized (ahead of time) which are not 
user-supplied.

Next up: Variable types.
In client->server web programming, there is *no* *such* *thing* as a 
user-supplied int. Or a float. Anybody who tries to sell you a package 
based on such things is either deluded, or doesn't understand HTTP. All 
web text comes in as *strings*. Period. Programmers can *cast* that 
string data one way or another, but people used to concepts such as a 
float not being assigned a string value may be really alarmed when 
their assumed "int" or "float" turns out to be a string, which can make 
SQL injection quite easy.

Another swing at the issue: Variable scoping.
PHP, by default, is big on global vars. Very handy in some cases, very 
scary in others. People used to protected variables should *really* 
read the docs first. Rather than a model of "protected unless global", 
PHP often went with "global unless protected". (I once saw 11K users 
shut out because of this... not pretty).

And now, Secure programming practices.
This is a pet peeve of mine. Take variable "$foo=1". This can 
eventually make the var true/bool, a string, an int, a float, etc. If 
you are passing it though python, PHP, C, java, and whatever-else in 
the chain, each part of the chain needs to make sure that the data is 
within expected values, and that the value will not compromise the next 
part of the chain. Let's take a recent MySQL exploit, where a long 
string, passed by PHP, can create a string-format exploit with mysql.  
A programmer can limit the mysql_connect() (and subsequent arguments) 
to less than 1K (or even 256 bytes). Newbie programmers who don't 
expect attacks, and thus do not sanitize every variable used for a) 
size, b) casted data type, c) removing special (escape) characters, 
etc., get caught.

Finally: Perms.
PHP often runs as the apache (etc) user. If each user has an apache 
instance, for their *own* UID, this is not a problem. However, hosting 
sites often want to keep CPU load down, and thus, there is "one" PHP 
(aka web) user. This is where PHP's "safe mode" (which most PHP devs 
hate) comes in. "safe mode" is functionally about having ten trusted 
programmers on a home server. It doesn't work for 3K users on a box... 
they still have a sandbox to break out of, unless they each have their 
own webserver instance.

So, in conclusion, you asked how can a:
> "secure" PHP can be implemented

How can a secure C program be implemented on the server? You cannot 
make C secure anymore than PHP. What you *can* do is check if every C, 
or PHP program, is good. Lacking that, chroot each PHP user and 
webserver into their own box. This adds to CPU costs.

It's possible because Windows XP drive two monitors connected to the
dock instead of the laptop LCD and one monitor.

However, I have never gotten it to work under Linux :-(

Oooh... what dock / laptop are you using?  Does the dock have two svga
connectors, or does it use a dvi-split cable of some sort?

Message-ID: <43E103D5.3080702@schluting.com>

Since my upgrade to the new thunderbird (1.5) I've been rendered quite 
useless.

When I send email at work, I'm normally typing something into a custom 
header. Previously, I could tab and shift-tab between the "header 
selection button" and the text entry field. Now, tabbing through headers 
only lets you skip to the next text entry box. Therefore I have to click 
on the header buttons and select my custom header :(
(I hope that clear, it's hard to describe.)

Does anyone know of a setting to make this behave like it used to? 
Alternatively, is there a setting to make your custom headers show up by 
default? That way I could just tab to the text entry box and start typing..

nit-pickily,

-Charlie

Part of security is dependent on the developers using the language,
but part of it is the language design, whether it makes doing things in
the language securely easy or difficult. Here's a discussion on some of
the poor design decisions the php development team have made, and how
difficult it is for a php author to write secure code:

  http://www.greebo.net/?p=320

C is another prime example -- it's possible to write non-stupid code in
C, but the original string library functions made it very easy to make
mistakes (strcpy et al). Even some of the replacement functions are
not that well thought out, people have gotten the length args wrong in
strncpy and it's lack of null termination when truncating is unhelpful.

<troll>
Around 1998 or so, I guessed that soon Perl would replace C as the
security grumble of the day, based on my assumption that most web apps
would be written in Perl. And along came php, completely throwing that
assumption off, by making Perl look good...

To everybody here...

I think the point Paul was trying to make..
(albiet slightly less then humerous...)

Was that Michael found this list to be enough of value to ask the list a 
good question. Unfortunately, he asked to be replied to off list; which 
defeats the purpose of why this list is so helpful to so many people!! 
Therefore Paul, jokingly, replied that he expected payment to be 
utilized as a private consultant.

Then Paul proceeded to answer the initial question.

So in the future...

IF you find this list valueable enough to ask the question...
THEN don't ask for a private e-mail response.

We're all in this together...

I didn't feel the original question warrented bandwidth burning public discussions

Charles and Rich...

According to RFC-821...
A "550 Error" is:
     550 Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable
            [E.g., mailbox not found, no access]

I haven't got a clue what "Rule B697" corresponds to; however, I will 
note that I was able to E-Mail Rich earlier today. :)
So the E-Mail address in the message below does work.

Hey now, perl is just fine.  As long as you don't mind the end result
looking like a cat walked across your keyboard, that is!

(perl6 is/should be far, far better in that respect)

Binary encoding is more efficient that Base64.

There are some replacements for those replacements now. OpenBSD fixed
that and made the strl*() group, trying to make length consistant and
guarenteeing termination. Both FreeBSD and SunOS have picked them up,
unfortunately as of 2.3.2, glibc hadn't picked them up.  :-(

Subject: [PLUG] thoughts on debian's newfangled iptables startup
Message-ID: <200602011506.55023.carla@bratgrrl.com>

Sometime when I wasn't looking, Debian went and ditched /etc/init.d/iptables. 
The newfangled way to start iptables automatically is to write your usual 
iptables script, then drop it into /etc/network/if-up.d. (You can also make 
inline entries in /etc/network/interfaces.)

I suppose it makes sense to bring up iptables only when networking is up. But 
I'm more comfortable keeping stuff separate, it's easier to debug and test. 
Any thoughts on advantages/disadvantages of the new way? 

There's a bit of information at /usr/share/doc/iptables/README.Debian.gz, and 
you can still use the old init script if you prefer.

Or to use another firewall application like shorewall to handle iptables
 management.  Shorewall comes with a very nice /etc/init.d/shorewall
script that can even be configured to set up a "down" iptables
configuration when it's stopped.  When shorewall is stopped, my internet
interface is unreachable, but my DMZ is still accessible.

Subject: [PLUG] Wireless bridge to LAN
Message-ID: <43E15D29.8090908@frankhunt.com>

OK, here's what I want to do: I need to get my home LAN out to my garage 
from my office without running a cable down  the hall, through the 
family room, laundry room, and out into the garage where my workbench 
and tools and stuff lives. Basically, it's a "wireless bridge" - an 
802.11 receiver with LAN ports on it.  Sort of a reverse wireless 
router.  I know I can do this with a small system with a wireless 
interface and a LAN interface, but that is (a) big; (b) noisy; (c) not cool.

Any of you network wizards out there got any ideas?  I have searched the 
internets to no avail.

I have no opinion on the issue. But this thread reminded me that I 
have been wondering about security on my Ubuntu-64 Breezy 
laptop.

At home it connects to the internet via ethernet to the hub and 
router. The router has no firewall. The only other computer on the 
ethernet is my Windows 2000 computer, on which I have Sygate 
firewall. In several years of operation there has never been a 
problem. I assume the Sygate firewall is doing its thing. Plus, 
since the computers are behind the router, I guess no one out 
there can actually see what they are. All they see is the router, 
right?

On occasion I take the laptop to PSU and connect via pub.net. And 
occasionally I connect at other locations, including once in a while 
at a coffee shop. 

I have never touched the security settings on this computer. If 
Ubuntu-64 Breezy did not install any security, then there is none. I 
assume it did, however. But is it adequate? How can I check? No 
problems so far, but I know zero about these things. Maybe it's 
time to enhance my knowledge in this area. 

Suggestions welcome.

PS, I've been thinking that the resurrected clinics at Free Geek 
(assuming everything works out) might occasionally feature a little 
mini-class on something. This might be a good topic. Or does Free 
Geek already have classes on these issues?

Wireless bridging can be "challenging" for reasons associated with the
way that 802.11 works.  Some gear advertised as a client bridge only
works with other gear from the same manufacturer.  There are some
wireless routers based on Linux, such as the Linksys WRT54G (be
careful about revision numbers) or the Netgear WGT634U, where with
third-party firmware you can set the radio up in client mode and
route.

I recently built a two-radio device from a WGT (which has a host USB
port), a USB wifi device (a Hawking HWU54G), and OpenWGT to act as a
repeater.  The HWU54G is configured as a client device to an existing
network, and the built-in radio works as another Access Point.  I am
routing between the interfaces with NAT.

When you ask for a private response, yes, you're either being incredibly 
selfish or begging for free consulting.

If you understand that, why did you ask to forgo the shared experience?

The default Ubuntu install leaves no open ports, so there is nothing to 
attack. So not having a firewall is probably OK. But it's pretty rare to be 
able to function this way- users usually need to at least share printers and 
files. Run nmap on your laptop from a second computer to double-check, 
something like this:

# nmap -sV -O ip-address

As far as winduhs goes, I wouldn't be too sure. It's not always obvious.

It is the difference between an unencoded v.s. encoded file.  I expect
the encoding to make it able to pass through a mail server correctly is
adding the extra size.

I'm wondering if any list members have heard of a OSS project that
replicates this functionality?  I've been doing a good deal of free tech
support with relatives and friends on their their MS Windows based
pc's.  It would be nice if I could gain access to their desktop rather
than having them verbally relay what they see.

I'd have control of a server acting as proxy or controller and one leg
of the connection (my workstation).  Also, VNC would be an acceptable
protocol to use.

I've also tried the Remote Assistance tool provided by Microsoft, but it
fails when the client pc is behind a NAT firewall as the RA tool
utilizes the RFC1918 address assigned to the client workstation.

   Thank you, Alan. I was focused on the mail and not thinking about having to
encode it as a MIME attachment. This means that when I forward it, it's
already converted to a text form so that it can squeeze between the molecules
an into the wires.

   You and Paul have been your usual helpful selves.

    Dick Steffens was after the same solution to provide tech support for his
Mom. If there's not an existing solution, then there certainly seems to be a
defined need. Looks like a nacent  sourceforge.net project.

Have you heard of the Hamachi VPN software? It's not OS, but it's free
and it runs on the big three platforms. There is a posting in the forum
on how to tunnel VNC through it.

I've noticed that the quality of best Buy varies from store to store.
Some are competent; others are obviously incompetent. I've come to the
point where if I can't buy an item online, I'll go to the CompUSA/Good Guys
near the airport to buy it. YMMV.

Sometimes I think it might be worth every reasonably intelligent person's
time to work retail for 3-6 months -- just to learn exactly how this
part of business actually works. That way the experienced person knows
when to ask for the manager, when you should just return the product for
a full refund & avoid the retailer in the future, & when someone actually
has done a commendable job in helping you.

I hope at some point in this ongoing learning experience you have taught
her how to backup the data on her computer. (I don't mean to pick on you,
but after such repeated demonstrations of incompetence by Best Buy, I'd
expect this had occured to you if you care about her.)

EchoVNC is supposed to do this.  The client is windows-only, but I think
some other VNC clients, such as TightVNC support it.  The relay daemon
is Windows or Linux; they also provide a relay server for you to use so
you don't have to set up your own.

Sounds like a config issue.  Poor design, in any case.

Wonder if there's something like this for freeNX?

US Robotics and probably other manufacturers make consumer-class "Wireless Access Points" which can be configured as wireless bridges.

I personally use a pair of USR 802.11B wireless APs to bridge two different LANs across the street (shared internet between two houses) in two different locations.

There are two ways to accomplish what you want using the USR APs (I don't have enough firsthand experience with other brands to walk you through it):

1. Use two wireless APs and configure them as a bridge. You give each the other's wireless MAC address and they become a virtual wire in the ethernet jungle - connect one to the switch in the house and the other to a switch in the garage. Magic!

2. Use one wireless AP as a client to another wireless AP, like an existing linksys or something you may have in the house already. You feed it the MAC of the AP to connect to and it basically accomplishes the same as #1, except the connection is shared with other users of the AP (less range, sometimes prone to more packet loss in high traffic areas)

The drawback to this method is "Access Points" (not to be confused with 'AP Routers' or 'Wireless Gateways') cost more, since they have more functionality (but usually lack routing).

For instance, the USR 5450 (802.11g TURBO) http://www.usr.com/products/networking/wireless-product.asp?sku=USR5450 is over $100.

If you already have a wireless AP in the house, I'd just pick one of these up and configure it as a client. If you don't have an AP in the house, I'd start with two USR models and build a dedicated wireless bridge for the best reliability.

HTH,
Aaron

P.S. If you use two of the USR APs as a bridge with each other, they will still be able to have IPs that are valid on your network (either via DHCP or static) so you can configure them, but otherwise they will be completely transparent to the network and follow the standard ethernet bridging rules with spanning tree protocol and all that good stuff. It's pretty cool :)

Keith and all,

    Thank you for checking into this.
I mentioned it to them a while back and then dropped the ball.
However, I think having clinics at FreeGeek would be cool.
Indeed, this would be a major change from Riverdale, but
change is good.

Subject: O'Reilly Podcast Includes NSA Wiretapping News Scoop

Hello--

"Distributing the Future" this week features a scoop we
thought was worth sharing:

Wiretapping doesn't require someone lurking in the bushes with a
directional antenna and headphones, or a pair of aligator clips and a
tape recorder, or someone sneaking into your room while you're out to
place a transmitter on your phone. In the U.S., if it's the government
doing the wiretapping, it's technically simple. At the O'Reilly Emerging
Telephony Conference Jack Herrington, author of "Podcasting Hacks"
interviewed Electronic Frontier Foundation Chairman of the Board Brad
Templeton about the technical, social, and political aspects of
wiretapping. At the end there's a nice juicy hint about upcoming action
from the EFF with regards to the recent NSA wiretapping case.

Companies used to make wireless bridges for just this situation.  For
whatever reason they seem to have been abandoned.

That said, I'd personally get a second AP that is OpenWRT-able and put
OpenWRT on it... running it in client mode instead of in Master mode.
In fact, I have a friend in Kansas that did exactly that for exactly
your situation.

A $75 solution.

Well, it looks like there is a veritable plethora of options for 
wireless bridges out there.  Linksys, Belkin, Buffalo Technologies - to 
name a few - all offer just what I'm looking for.  I guess it's off to 
Fry's on my way to FreeGeek Thursday (like Wilsonville is on the way to 
Portland from Hillsboro).  They usually have a pretty good selection and 
their return policy is OK.

Thanks for all the knowledge . . .

I used to do exactly this with a WRT54G and the Sveasoft firmware. 
These days you're probably better off with the OpenWRT instead of
Sveasoft, but same idea.

One caveat I ran across when originally trying to set this up is not
to confuse using a wireless router in client mode (where the wireless
device in the router acts just as a wireless card does) with WDS mode
(which is intended to extend the range of your network wirelessly, but
cuts your bandwidth down, I think in half).  You want client, not WDS.

Eventually silently losing my connection every time our neighbor used
their 2.4GHz phone drove me nuts enough to abandon the wireless
bridge, but it worked well other than the interference problem.

To clarify, all I did was have a 2 minute conversation and post the
results to the list.  Adam did (and will do) a lot more.  If this
thing comes off, it will be the sum of many contributions, large and
small, and that includes a lot of you that we haven't heard from yet.
I hope a bunch of you volunteer, and show up at the meeting on the 12th.

The latest release of openssh, version 4.3, contains experimental support
for VPNs.

 * Add support for tunneling arbitrary network packets over a
   connection between an OpenSSH client and server via tun(4) virtual
   network interfaces. This allows the use of OpenSSH (4.3+) to create
   a true VPN between the client and server providing real network
   connectivity at layer 2 or 3. This feature is experimental and is 
   currently supported on OpenBSD, Linux, NetBSD (IPv4 only) and 
   FreeBSD. Other operating systems with tun/tap interface capability 
   may be added in future portable OpenSSH releases. Please refer to 
   the README.tun file in the source distribution for further details
   and usage examples.

So far I have been very happy with Tight VNC. It has a listen mode so I 
can watch with out affecting their machine.  Also I have the option to 
buy RealVNC which is the commercial version and has better 
security/features and works the same way.

Message-ID: <Pine.OSX.4.64.0602021551530.5736@arrowhead.galois.com>

At work today, a user's laptop hard drive headed south. A replacement 
is being shipped, so I extracted the old HD, put it in an external USB 
enclosure, and am recovering what files I can.

In the meantime, I've got this HD-less Dell Latitude 6000. It occured 
to me that I had an old but viable HD with Linux installed. True, the 
HD had been running in an IBM X41, but ...?

Sure enough, the Linux (Debian) HD booted with no trouble in the Dell. 
Network, sound, USB, etc. were all there. The only non-starter was X, 
but I'd assumed that going in.

Nothing like a little portability to brighten my day. :-)

A reply to my original question as I'm not sure who's response is best
to reply to as well as for documenting purposes.

So far, three ideas have come to light.

EchoVNC

hamachi    ------    http://www.hamachi.cc/

http://faq.gotomyvnc.com/fom-serve/cache/88.html




Hamachi looks very interesting, though it still keeps the "server" under
someone else's control.  Which, I am trying to avoid.

Also a notable mention.  Some brought to light that the next release of
openssh will have vpn capability.  I haven't looked on the web site to
see, but based on what I know about openssh there is no "server" piece
that coordinates two seperate sources that want to hook up.

Well, that would be the server.  The only thing you have to handle then 
is where you locate it and how you configure it.  If two clients 
connect to one box and that box routes them to each other, then they 
are connected.  You don't have to wait for the next version, just 
tunnel a ppp connection through ssh today.

Probably, but you'll need to provide a little more info:

* By 'IMAP folders' you mean messages stored on a machine other
   than the the one on which you're running pine, right?

* Are those folders currently visible to your other mail client(s)?

* Are those folders in their own directory hierarchy, unmixed with
   non-mail files?

If you provide a munged version of the remote hostname and the logical 
path to (e.g., ~/imap) to your folders, I'd be happy to show you the 
alterations you need to make to your ~/.pinerc.

My daughter loves those things.  ;-)  I put her on a linux system when
she was 3.  She's 6 now.  She doesn't really know the difference, of
course.  She just wants to play the games.  She calls tuxracer, "the
penguin game".  ;-)

David,

   I presume that means you'd like them for her. OK. They are now bespoken.

   When I return from my meeting in Salem later today I'll contact you off the
list to arrange adoption.

Well, she doesn't need all of them.  I'm sure there are more than my
daughter that would like one.  However, that said, if nobody else wants
one then I'll be sure to share them with other children my daughter
knows.  Gotta spread the love of course.  ;-)

I'd be interested in both of them (or one, if someone else wants one.) 

	My better half loves penguins, which works out nicely as I am
becoming more and more of a Linux enthusiast.

	If you want, you can contact me off list with the logistics.

   I have a couple of fuzzy Tux figures sitting here. One came with a copy
of
Wine from Corel, the other with something else; both in the late 1990s. I'd
like to donate them to anyone with kids -- or without kids. I suppose I can
donate them to FreeGeek if no one else wants 'em.

   Make that "both." And they're small: 3" and 6" from cloaca to head.

By "IMAP folders" I mean messages that I access through an IMAP server,
which in this case happens to be localhost.

I can access those folders currently with Thunderbird and Evolution
locally and remotely

Those folders are stored in ~/Maildir and are (unsurprisingly) in
maildir format and mixed with the things that dovecot leaves around.  I
am not running a maildir patched Pine.

My remote hostname is localhost, in my ~/.pinerc currently I can specify
an IMAP folder like this {localhost}foldername and
{localhost}foldername.subfolder

Thanks,
Brent

Subject: [PLUG] mgetty-voice...
Message-ID: <1138823005.43e10f5d8f7a4@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

It's recording messages okay, but I don't think it's hanging up when the 
caller hangs up.  I don't want half a dozen recordings of, "if you'd like
to make a call..."  Is there a configuration parameter that can be changed
to get mgetty-voice to properly detect when the remote party hangs up
early?

My other theory is that I have a phone off the hook, but I'm getting these,
"if you'd like to make a call...," when that clearly isn't the case.






I want to do speaker-phone off of the mgetty-voice controlled
modem, anyone have experience doing this?  I want to use my answering
service as a means to filter callers, this means that I need to be able
to pick up after mgetty-voice has started recording a message.  

I want to replace my cron process that translates the messages to wav
files and posts them to another server with a daemon process so that
my messages show up in real time instead of within 10 minutes of being
recorded.  For harassment calls, it's important to know exactly when
the message was recorded.  

If I have caller ID, I want to leverage that information to further 
screen callers.  For the random unknown caller, I want mgetty-voice 
to play a different greeting that says, "You are an unidentified 
caller.  Goodbye."  I'm sick and tired of telemarketers.  I feel 
that the public needs stronger protection when it comes to being 
put on call lists and what it takes to get off of them.  Why are 
we an opt-out instead of an opt-in society when it comes to 
telemarketers?  You pay for your phone, what gives a stranger the 
right to call you up on it and try to sell you something?

I use mgetty-voice because it means that my messages are available
to me on my computer network, and I want to show the people I live 
with that I'm intelligent ;-)  I don't want an answering machine 
that you buy at a store, most of them anymore don't have an output 
to allow easy dumping to a computer or some other digital playback 
device.

OK, try this:

   folder-collections="Home" {localhost}[]

The square brackets tell pine to view the entire folder space below 
the imap root. That configuration works well with my Dovecot/Maildir 
IMAP server and pine.

I'm having a hard time framing this question in a way to get helpful results from freshmeat or google. Either an answer or ... something to help with the 'framing' would be useful.

The problem is that we've several users with very large email mailbox files on an older sendmail server. I want to automatically remove old messages (say, older than a month), so the mail file stays 'relevant.'  If it were a Maildir like on our qmail server, the solution would be relatively trivial (using find, delete messages older than a month).

I don't see a way to disable "leave messages on server," which would solve half of the problem. Could I run a mutt script to remove them? Is there an easier way?

I don't want to bounce messages, which would happen with a quota solution.  Patching sendmail on this server is an option, but "upgrading to qmail" isn't, at the moment (my credibility has taken a hit with the qmail issues lately).

Your help is appreciated.

There's a utility called archmbox that might do what you want.
(http://adc-archmbox.sourceforge.net/). You'd have to set up a
cron job to run it periodically. I use it this way to automatically
prune spam quarantine folders.

WARNING: archmbox is implemented in perl, and some of the perl modules
it uses have behaviors that are dependent on your LANG setting. I find
for example that if LANG is set to en_US.UTF-8 (a typical default) them
archmbox has difficulty parsing mail boxes, in particular when those
mail boxes have non-English email as you might find in a spam quarantine
folders. I find I can avoid trouble if I do this before running archmbox:

   export LANG=en_US

Please note that while PHP is used as an example in this posting, the
same points could be made about almost any language in which web apps
can be built. Isn't formmail.cgi a Perl script? Google for "formmail.cgi
spam" when you have a minute.

PHP makes it easy for coders to make something that sort of works (but
is horribly insecure). Perl has a higher barrier to entry, but that
doesn't mean that people can't write insecure CGI scripts in Perl.

I stand by my original assertion:

  No, developers have security problems.

I use archivemail for that sort of thing.  Written in Python, works OK.

Also, which POP/IMAP server are you using?  Dovecot does indexing, which
improves things a bit for mbox users.  Ultimately, I always find myself
finding a way to switch to Maildir, typically with Postfix.  If you're
running Procmail as your MDA, you can use it to deliver to Maildirs,
and I think you can even do that with Sendmail.

Subject: [PLUG] Sorting out land parcels - A Fuzzy Logic Problem?
Message-ID: <20060204014435.GB31987@www.gisnet.com>

I sent this to a friend of mine in the Portland area and asked him if this
was a "fuzzy logic" problem, but he replied that it's really a parsing
problem, and that I should post my message to the PLUG list because, he
assured me, this is where the experts on parsing problem are.

I've been trying to tackle this with sed and awk, but it's been slow going.
Still, is this the right track? Would Perl be a better choice? What's the
best approach to this problem?

Here's a repeat of the message I sent:

I've got a table with thousands of records containing a column that
describes one or more land parcels. These descriptions are coded in a
somewhat free form manner, and generally in each county they have a similar
pattern (similar, but not identical!) What I need to do is pick out the
township, range, section and quarter section elements in this column and
create a clean normalized file of this information which I can pass on to
MapInfo to construct the polygons from the PLSS grid (which I have.)

Here's a sample of the first few records:
1          001T47R27/NWSE SWNE NESW SEC 7 AITKIN TWP
2          001T43R22/E2NE SEC 16 WAGNER TWP
3          001T47R27/W2SE NESE SENE SEC 16 AITKIN TWP
4          001T47R27/SENE SE4 SEC 33 S2NW SEC 34 AITKIN TWP
5          001T47R27/SEC 15 & 16 AITKIN TWP
6          001T136R25/SEC 13 N2 SEC 24 AITKIN TWP
7          001T47R27/NE4-SEC 6-AITKIN TWP
8          001T47R27/N2SE E2NW E2SW SEC 18 AITKIN TWP
9          001T47R27/N2N2 SEC 7 AITKIN TWP
10         001T47R27/S2NW N2SW NWSE SEC 22 AITKIN TWP
11         001T48R27/S33 S2SE E2NE UNORG T47R27 S4 & 5 AITKIN
12         001T47R27/NW SWNE SEC11 LESS N2NE AITKIN TWP
13         001T47R27/SEC 11 N2NE AITKIN TWP
14         001T47R27/S3&2,S2-SW4,T48R27/S35-S2SE,S36 AITKN TWP

The record id is the first column, then the 001 indicates the county. The
rest of the line is what I'm interested in.  The data actually varies quite
a bit more than this sample shows, but in general, it is easy to parse in
my head. It's very hard to do it with a computer. What I want is the
following:

1          001T47N R27W S7 NWSE
1          001T47N R27W S7 SWNE
1          001T47N R27W S7 NESW
2          001T43N R22W S16 E2NE

3          001T47N R27W S16 NESE
3          001T47N R27W S16 SENE 
4          001T47N R27W S33 SENE
4          001T47N R27W S33 SE
4          001T47N R27W S33 S2NW 
4          001T47N R27W S34 
5          001T47N R27W S15
5          001T47N R27W S16
6          001T136N R25W S13 N2
6          001T136N R25W S24
7          001T47N R27W S6 NE
8          001T47N R27W S18 N2SE
8          001T47N R27W S18 E2NW
8          001T47N R27W S18 E2SW 
9          001T47N R27W S7 N2N2
10         001T47N R27W S22 S2NW
10         001T47N R27W S22 N2SW
10         001T47N R27W S22 NWSE
11         001T48N R27W S33 S2SE
11         001T48N R27W S33 E2NE
11         001T47N R27W S4
11         001T47N R27W S5
12         001T47N R27W S11 NW
12         001T47N R27W S11 SWNE
13         001T47N R27W S11 N2NE

Notice where there are multiple descriptions, I want to split them into
separate lines. And #14 is ambigous... I don't know how to interpret that.
However, in most cases there's a way to convert it into normalized form.

I'm attempting to do this with sed and awk (to take advantage of regular
expressions) although I'm contemplating learning enough Perl to do this if
that's what it's going to take. Even so, what's so easy for me to do in my
head is proving very difficult to do in a machine. *I* can see the patterns
easily and have no trouble rearranging them to get what I want, but why is
it so hard to teach a stupid machine to do it? Do you know of any method or
software that I can use to do this? Is it a fuzzy logic problem or just a
hairy mess?

Any ideas would be welcome!

TIA,

 - Bill Thoen

Fuzzy Logic is a different sort of animal.  It looks like you want to
make a pretty smart parser.  I'd start working with Perl or Python,
making something that starts with getting what it understands (the stuff
on the left, stuff from a dictionary like NWSE, obvious terms like "SEC ##"
and "xxxx TWP") and think up any sanity checks I can (e.g. Aitkin Twp. is
always Section 7)

Then you just keep tweaking the parser 'til it gets enough of the cases
to be worth the effort.

Excellent, that mostly works, thank you!

It is missing several sub folders and all of the sub-sub folders under 
them.. any idea why that might be?

Check to see if you have a ~/.mailbox file. If so, try shutting down 
pine, moving .mailbox out of the way, and restarting pine.

Beyond that, you might try checking your mail or system logs to see if 
your imap server is reporting problems with broken indices or 
unreadable files.

Subject: [PLUG] xterm not starting correctly
Message-ID: <1139077389.7735.17.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi all,

I recently had a root partition go south on me, I was able to salvage
most of the files, but on the whole it is no longer usable.  After
installing a new root file system (Debian unstable), I mounted my
old /home partition and everything seemed to be working just fine.

Then I tried to open xterm, all I got was a window with an all black
interior.  At first I thought maybe the background, text and cursor are
all the same color, but using a launcher program to launch midnight
commander (a mostly blue application) resulted in the same all black
window.

Other terminal emulators run just fine, only xterm has this problem.  Of
course, xterm is my preferred emulator.

I've looked for possible configuration problems, but I can't figure out
what xterm looks for that is different from the other emulators.

Does anyone have a clue?

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] Graphical audio normalization software
Message-ID: <200602041853.50166.aaron@madebyai.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to find an application which has a simple graphical interface to normalize audio ripped from CDs. I recently switched my family's computers to Linux and one of the things they like to do is rip commercial CDs and make their own compilations by mixing tracks from different discs.

Unfortunately, it seems there's a wide range of volumes these discs come recorded at, and that's not always pleasant when listening to a mixed CD. They'd like some software to go through and normalize their music collections so all the tracks are the same volume.

It needs to be fairly simple and hopefully have a graphical interface for them to use. It may not be practical to re-rip all the tracks they have with a ripper application that does the normalization, but if there's no alternative they will consider it.

It'd be nice if this normalization software can directly open MP3 and FLAC files without having to manually convert them to WAV, then reencode after normalization.

So far I've looked at normalize, which is a CLI app, and KWave, an audio editor that's far more sophisticated than they'd like to use.

Any suggestions would be appreciated!

It seems like you want something to automate normalizing a large
number of files, which would be hard to find in a GUI app.  One
command line option is mp3gain, detailed here:

Message-ID: <43E67A5C.30802@comcast.net>

I'm trying to setup MythTV on a Suse 10 box, and I'm currently stuck on 
some mysql issues.  I have never used mysql before.  I installed mysql 
using Yast along with the dependencies.  I think the version is 4.1.x.

The daemon is up and running.  I set the root password and created the 
mythconverg database.  After doing those two steps, I can't access mysql 
without extra hassle:

mythtv at linux:~> mysql -u root
ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using
password: NO)
mythtv at linux:~>

But if I issue the command 'mysql -u root -p', then it will prompt me 
for a password and enter a mysql session.  How do I set mysql so that 
'using password' is YES?  Also, do I have to create a 'mythtv' (which is 
my username) user in mysql?  If so, how?

This issue is preventing me from being able to launch 'mythtv-setup' 
because the program can't access mysql.  Any assistance would be very 
much appreciated.

Thanks,

Ken

Using the "-p" parameter causes it it to use a password, which you can 
enter from the command line (if you don't want to enter a password from 
the command line - there are solutions but it reduces security).

The easiest way to create users in MySQL is to use a tool like 
phpMyAdmin.  However, the following commands would work as well:

insert into user (host, user) values ('localhost', 'mythtvuser' );
create database mythtv;
grant all on mythtv to mythtvuser;
flush privileges;

This will create the user mythtvuser and grant it all permissions.  The 
account will NOT have any password associated with it.

I'd recommend installing phpMyAdmin or downloading the manual for MySQL.

BTW, it should be MySQL v4.1.16 for SuSE (and OpenSuSE) to cover the 
latest security vulnerabilities.

I produce 8.5" x 5.5" booklets in .pdf format, and
would like to "impose" them so a newly-created file
looks like you pulled the staples out and spread the
sheets out flat. Service bureaus like this.

Fytex does have such an application for Linux, and it
appears to work. (The bottom margins of the pages are
way too wide, and the tops are cut off, so this is a
show-stopper unless it can be solved. And they haven't
got back to me with a price quote. In short, I might
go this route if it looks attractive.)

Any other ideas?

Being new to Linux, I don't have any suggestions that will work in 
Linux, although I hope a solution exists. I need to do this from time 
to time. I use Windows for it, but I want to go totally Linux 
eventually.

In Windows I would use InDesign, which comes with a script that 
will place pages of a multipage PDF on pages of an InDesign 
document. When it places the pages you can specify the position 
and how many per page. I tell the script to do it twice, one each 
side, in landscape. Takes a few minutes and works like a charm. If 
I want I can export the resulting file as a new PDF. 

On Linux Scribus is the closest I have seen to InDesign, but it has 
quite a ways to go. I'm not sure it's even scriptable. But it's worth 
checking out. I've only messed around with it a bit so far. Maybe it 
already has this capability.

If your mind can handle the non-GUI of TeX, maybe you can do it 
there. I'm told TeX can do anything. :)

Let me know how you finally solve the problem.

Tim,

   Have you looked at the pdf tool kit (pdftk)? I believe that does exactly
what you want. enscript will print 2-up, but I don't think it reorganizes the
logical pages on the physical pages. Also, OO.o probably has this ability and
I know that Scribus does.

HTH,

Rich

The Debian mythtv package came with a small mysql script

CREATE DATABASE mythconverg;
GRANT ALL ON mythconverg.* TO mythtv at localhost IDENTIFIED BY "mythtv";
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
GRANT CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES ON mythconverg.* TO mythtv at localhost
IDENTIFIED BY "<replace with your mythtv password>";
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

that might help

I also second installing phpmyadmin....

   Thank you, Coop. After 30 years of writing I think I'm getting a handle on
how to do it well. As for typesetting, I draft behind the professionals who
develop LaTeX and LyX. And now, Scribus, when I need brochures, newsletters,
booklets, and the like.

   FWIW, Scribus does have a HOWTO on booklet printing and it is fully
scriptable in Python.

Message-ID: <8db4a1910602060928k64e17d41r1f5ba2b570a5c411@mail.gmail.com>

Hey PLUG,

FreeGeek has, for a while, sold cheap old equipment, refurbished to work but
slow by your new equipment standards. It's mostly been commodity desktop
hardware, now up to the 500Mhz range. Now we're looking at selling some of
the more obscure, arcane, and interesting workstation and server-class
equipment on a regular basis. Here's the problem: what do you all want? I'm
a part of the project to get this equipment back on the streets, back making
deals and digital trouble and I figure a good part of the demand for old
refurbished server hardware at low low prices is likely to come from, well,
geeks. So I'd like to ask you, pardon me for assuming you might be geeks,
what you'd be interested in if you were interested in buying a server at
maybe $50-200.

Here are a few of the questions I've thought of. Maybe you've even got more
questions?

Would you rather 10-20G IDE drives or 4-9G SCSI drives?
Would you rather pay a little extra and have RAID (probably software)
installed on the system when you get it?
Would you just like tested equipment, no drives, because you're happy with
an old processor but you're going to need to go out and get a 500 G drive to
hold all your music files?
Do you even care what OS is on it (we'd likely put Debian, Mandriva, or
Ubuntu on it)? Are you just going to wipe it the moment you get it?
What's your bottom end processor you'd consider? If it were dual?
Are there other specializations we should be considering to systems to make
them more appealing?


I'm going to try to follow the discussion, assuming there is one (please! I
want ideas!), but I also want to mention that if there's something specific
you're looking for and this makes you realize you want it, please at least
CC me directly to make sure I see it and can let you know if we can do it.

Thanks,

Jeff

I've typically used psbook and psnup from the psutils package to do that
with PostScript files.  It looks like pdftk doesn't do that sort of
thing, so you might convert the PDF to PS with pdftops (which works
better than pdf2ps), repaginate/scale/whatever and then converte back
with ps2pdf.

Nice thing about psbook is that you have pretty good control over
signature size.  You can either make the whole booklet one stack of
sheets folded down the middle, or break it up into smaller signatures
(it's hard to fold more than about 5 sheets of copy paper and get nice
results.)

   A nice tie-dye paint pattern on the case would be appropriate; perhaps a
portrait of Jerry Garcia or Frank Zappa on the front.

You know, I would love one of those two. I learned how to do microcode 
on one of those beasts. And I *loved* the Macro 11 Assembler.

Webmin has a really good mysql admin interface. The best setup guide for
MythTV is here...

I realize you are not using Fedora, but it's still worth looking at. Very
detailed step by step instructions.

I will wipe it the moment I get it.  Maybe a placeholder OS on it to
make sure it functions, but nothing more than a console, and some
network utilties....

Could perhaps your terminfo/termcap files for xterm have gotten messed up?
(under /etc)... If you exec command, say, 'xterm -fg lightblue -bg black',
instead of just 'xterm', does that help?

Depends on what the server is for. For a true /server/, SCSI all the way.

> Would you rather pay a little extra and have RAID (probably software)
> installed on the system when you get it?

All these have multiple disks, or is this an option? Certainly with 4GB
disks, I'd need several to get the necessary aggregate space. There is the
question you ask below though...

> Would you just like tested equipment, no drives, because you're happy with
> an old processor but you're going to need to go out and get a 500 G drive to
> hold all your music files?

Not in the general case. In particular SCSI drives are pricy. I might add
a giant IDE disk for big files, but the existing space is important.

> Do you even care what OS is on it (we'd likely put Debian, Mandriva, or
> Ubuntu on it)? Are you just going to wipe it the moment you get it?

Print out a hardware configuration and tape it to the system. Include
what hardware kernel modules are loaded, /proc/ioports, /proc/irq and
/proc/pci. Amount of memory, type and speed; number, size and type of
disks.

I /might/ preserve a Debian installation, but in most cases I'd be wiping
and reloading. This might include setting up software RAID (note to the
above question, I can setup software RAID myself).

> What's your bottom end processor you'd consider? If it were dual?

Well, with paying for it, 1GHz single, 600MHz dual. I might use slower,
but I'd be unwilling to pay.

> Are there other specializations we should be considering to systems to make
> them more appealing?

You may be assuming it, but ECC memory is an important factor (registered
memory is worth noting). 64-bit and 66MHz PCI would be worth noting as
well.

I have a couple of servers running VERY low traffic web and my personal

I am using webhostfreaks.com Linux servers and cpanel interface. 7.50

I would check them out.

Redwood Virtual is exactly that.  Minimum UML for like $10/mo or $100/yr,
decent connectivity but there's been a couple multi-hour outages a year.
I'm currently dumping my $5/mo UML account 'cos my brother and I are
sharing an Ubuntu server at his lab.

I'd love to see hosting with Xen, especially using its migration
features to allow zero-downtime maintenance. (and doesn't it do
checkpointing?)

For a much higher geek level look for a hosting provider that uses 
Linux-Vserver.  Off the top of my head I don't know of any any more as I 
run Linux-Vserver on my own systems but they are out there.

I started with RWV about the same time they became RWV... there were a
couple multi-day outages, as I recall.  However, a few multi-hour
outages seemed to be the norm over the last year I was with them.

If you need high reliability, it's going to cost you money.  I haven't
found a UML provider that does a good job of that yet - and I think I've
been with four over the years.  I've had multi-day outages from all of
them at one point or another and the customer service generally sucked.
 That said, for ten bucks a month, a RWV UML is perfect... as long as
you aren't going to be dead in the water with a twelve-hour outage while
they rebuild their RAID array /again/.

I have quite a bit of experience with software raid, and a modest amount with hardware raid. Which are you using?

I'd be glad to help if I can, I'm a Gentoo guy myself but Slackware shouldn't be too hard to work with, I think it basically tries to accomplish the same thing (build your own distro)

Gentoo also supports the 2.4 kernel series, by the way.

What kind of RAID controller?  We can probably help you for free on this
list, or if you'd rather I can do it for you for $80/hr billed in
whole-hour increments.  I do consider myself a Slackware expert.. I've
been using it for quite a few years now.  But that's a lot of money -
I'm sure we can help you out here if you give us a chance.  :-)

Try the Foresight Nanotech Institute:

http://www.foresight.org/

They're particularly involved with the implications for humanity's 
future when molecular nanotechnology allows for self replicating 
machines. A number of eff guys are involved with both.

vcolo.com is local. $20/mo for a UML.  When I signed up, they had pretty
reliable service, but they have "upgraded" their control system and it
is half-busted IMHO.  On the other hand, perhaps they would offer a
discount in return for some coding help.

I am currently using rimuhosting out of NZ and Dallas (definitely NOT
local), which is Xen-based.  They are a little quirky, but I haven't
had any downtime in the last 8 months.

If you want even cheaper than that, get some "room-mates" and split
up one of the virtual machines (who do you trust with root access to
your machine?).  I run 9 websites, multiple mailing lists and wikis
and so forth - Plone may be coming soon.  It could certainly handle
the needs of more than one person, unless the disk space needs are
heavy.  These usually come with like 3GB for everything, and that is
too small for your DVD movie collection.

One thing I found (unfortunately) is that when 8.5" x
5.5" is converted to .ps, it appears on an 11" x 8.5"
page with wide margins. I downloaded the demo of
Fytek's "PDF Meld," and when I discovered that it
would work, I purchased it for $30. I'm sure they
appreciated it.

Okay,

Here is the question I am wrestling with.
I am considering trying Slackware.  I am running Ubuntu and it uses GRUB 
as the bootloader.  Slackware seems to install LiLO.  If I don't install 
LiLO, will GRUB recognize Slackware?
Will they work together?
Or is this more trouble than it is worth?

Some of the rants about Slackware say that I will learn more about Linux 
in one install of Slack than most other Linux flavors...what say you Mr. 
Expert? :~)

Bruce,

   I'm far from an expert since I've used slackware only about 2.5 years now.
However, it will work with either GRUB or LILO. My Sony from Emperor Linux
came with GRUB installed. When I inadvertently trashed /usr (don't ask!) and
went through the recovery process it came up with LILO. I've left it there
since I have only one or two kernels on a system at any given time. Only once
in the past 8+ years have I forgotten to run /sbin/lilo after changing
/etc/lilo.conf. That lesson has really sunk in past the hubs.

   I have found it much easier to install and maintain slackware (from
8.0-10.2) than I did Red Hat (from 4.1-7.3). The major differences are that
Slackware uses the BSD-style init scripts (/etc/rc.d/rc.<whatever>) and other
distributions (Red Hat I know) use the SysV-style init scripts; Patrick likes
KDE and not Gnome so the latter is not included; Patrick likes MySQL and not
PostgreSQL so that latter is not included.

   Nothing's been a show-stopper for me. It's far back from the bleeding edge.
Unless I get a security update from the team, I do nothing between
distribution upgrades. Those take about 1/2-hour per machine; most of the
time is drinking coffee and watching the packages upgrade, then sweeping up
some detritus. Very smooth, very simple. There are a couple of package
grabbing/management tools for those who want to upgrade to the current
version periodically; I don't use either.

   But, listen to Rob. He's the real expert (and has helped me tremendously
a number of times). I just use the stuff to get my work done.

David,

No ~/.mailbox file to move out of the way, no errors reported in the logs.

The missing folders have messages in them as well as sub-folders, but
there are other folders containing messages and sub-folders that do show
up fine.

No, it did not help, except that it spit out some errors.

You might try opening one of the missing folders manually:

   G   # goto folder)
   ^N  # cycle through collections until you get to the right one

Type the name of the folder using '.' instead of '/' as the path 
separator, e.g.,

   mailinglists.plug

Subject: [PLUG] Perl regex query
Message-ID: <20060207193116.GA25804@www.gisnet.com>

Last week I was asking questions about sed, and as was pointed out, the
answer was Perl. But I still have questions regarding some tricky stuff
with regex epressions. I've orderd a copy of "Mastering Regular
Expression", but while I'm waiting for it to arrive I hope someone here can
help me with another problem.

Basically, how do you specify a multi-character regex pattern that may 
repeat for up to 4 times? For example, I'm trying to pick out some land 
parcel quarter-section descriptions that look something like the 
following:

N2SWSE
SWNENENW
...

The first one means "the north half of the southwest of southeast corner of
the section, and the second means the southwest of the northeast of the
northeast of the northwest corner of a section. Essentially each "quarter"
can be described as one of the following: NE, SE, SW, NW, N2, E2, S2, W2,
and there may be none to four of them in the description. These strings may
or may not be delimited by spaces (or dashes or a slash... in the table I
have, these vary) so for example, you might have a complete descriptions that
look like these:

T47R22/NWNE SEC 12 (township 47, range 22 northwest of the northeast corner 
                    of section 12)
T48R22S13SENENEDOU (twp 48 rge 22, section 13, southeast of the northeast
                    of the northeast corner in the DOUglas township)

So with my feeble knowledge of Perl, I try:

#!/usr/bin/perl
while (<>) {
   if (/((NE|SE|SW|NW|N2|E2|S2|W2){0,4})/) {
      $qtr = $1;
      print $qtr," : ", $_ ;
   }
}

and feed it a file containing records like these:

7          001T47R27/NE4-SEC 6-AITKIN TWP
8          001T47R27/N2SE E2NW E2SW SEC 18 AITKIN TWP
9          001T47R27/N2N2 SEC 7 AITKIN TWP
10         001T47R27/S2NW N2SW NWSE SEC 22 AITKIN TWP
11         001T48R27/S33 S2SE E2NE UNORG T47R27 S4 & 5 AITKIN
12         001T47R27/NW SWNE SEC11 LESS N2NE AITKIN TWP
13         001T47R27/SEC 11 N2NE AITKIN TWP
14         001T47R27/S3&2,S2-SW4,T48R27/S35-S2SE,S36 AITKN TWP

I don't get anything. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?

TIA,

- Bill Thoen

The problem is with the {0,4}.  When you say 0, perl says, okay that
means that I can match on nothing.  Literally nothing.

Change that 0 to a 1 and you'll be much happier with the results.

Might try a couple things: "(NE|SE|SW|NW|N2|E2|S2|W2)+" (match one or
more of those) and you might also see how things work with the split
command.  The \b (word boundary) metacharacter might come in handy here.

A successive series of search/replace, and split might do the job.

I Googled for "perl regex" and found this to be nifty:
http://www.perl.com/doc/manual/html/pod/perlre.html

And do you have "Learning Perl"?  The author posts here sometimes... ;)

Actually the best answer was to use {1,4} in pattern instead of {0,4}. In
this case the '0' allowed it to match on nothing, and since it's an "eager"
engine it will always go for the null result if you allow it that option.
The correct code should be:

#!/usr/bin/perl
while (<>) {
  if (/((NE|SE|SW|NW|N2|E2|S2|W2){1,4})/) {
    $qtr = $1;
    print $qtr," : ", $_ ;
  }
}

Sure you can use GRUB - just set it up to boot the Slackware kernel and
use the Slackware root filesystem instead of the Ubuntu stuff.

I've used GRUB with Slackware a few times.

Definitely.  IMHO, you won't learn more in any other popular distro
except perhaps LFS, if you consider LFS a popular distro.  Slackware
leaves you with a bare system to learn to use...

You may be missing your rgb.txt file.  See if /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt
exists.  That's where black would be defined.

My first inclination would be to stop and think about what you're trying
to do.

(NE|SE|SW..) etc will match *one* of the 'NE', 'SE', 'SW' etc and
capture that into $1 for you.

Break it up into it's components and use character classes, ie,
([NSEW][EW2]) and use some sort of quantifier or look-behind on it --
It's a little early and I've not had my caffinated beverages yet, so
don't yell if that doesn't work!

And, if you've the time and inclination, perldoc perlretut and perldoc
perlre tend to be great references.

That was the culprit!  Somehow, on my system, that file turned out to be
a dead symlink to /etc/X11/rgb.txt but there was no such beast.  I
copied one over from another system, restarted X and xterm is good now.
Strange that nothing else was broken.

Thanks a million.

I think you're being optimistic.  :-)

Have you looked at Software RAID ever or are you just assuming it sucks?
 Seriously, give it a shot - its performance is excellent and it can add
additional flexibility not found in inexpensive hardware RAID (true
hardware RAID) setups.

You obviously haven't been in web development long.  :-)

When you start getting in to database-backed sites, especially ones
doing complicated things, you start eating up CPU cycles like candy.
200MHz just isn't enough juice for the complexity of pages and number of
visitors I get on my small-time server.  Try running a MediaWiki site
that gets a few thousand hits an hour on a 200MHz box and get back to
me.  :-)

> Form factor. Rack units count for small sites.

Definitely - we couldn't afford more than 1U.

> RAM capacity and cost.

More RAM the better... a GB doesn't go as far as it used to.

Possibly. :-) Since RAID was mentioned I assumed there was at least 2 
drives. ;-)

I've used it on various platforms over the years, and while I've had 
numerous problems with different software RAID setups, I haven't had 
the same level of problems with hardware RAID. In addition, by putting 
hardware RAID on a different physical controller, the CPU/mobo can 
offload more work (thus needing less CPU/mobo power).

Any specific recommendations on current software RAID (closed or open 
source, I don't care) that you've found reliable? I may simply have 
been burned by the first few generations of buggy code.

LOL, only long enough to have built some pretty intense sites on 200Mhz 
boxes (because that's what was the *fastest* X86 box on the market at 
one time, geez, way to make me feel old)... about 9 years, total. Why 
did I just know I should be expecting further discussion on this topic? 
;-)

How one builds such sites *definitely* affects how the CPU cycles get 
used, no?  Most of my sites have rather heavy db backends, but then 
again, I'm also the kind of programmer who both counts *every* db and 
file hit taken per page, and profiles all of my SQL (and other data 
fetching) for optimal query speeds and engines (I've been known to 
combine 2 openldap calls, 2 bdb hits, and 3 PostgreSQL queries on one 
page to maximize speed). I've actually done quite a few rewrites to 
reduce speeds on brutal pages from 10-12 CPU seconds (bleagh!) per page 
fetch to <.02 seconds on the same hardware, just by ripping out 
redundant/un-needed code routines and sub-optimal db access.

By the same token, I've also seen some.... interesting... sites where 
every page load has 20-30(!) db hits to handle user and system 
variables, then 40-50(!) file hits to load up functions/modules/classes 
(etc.), another 50-100(!) db hits to generate actual page content, and 
then another chunk of CPU cycles to simply assemble it all... into a 
mere 25-50K page. Sadly, this kind of page programming seems to be the 
norm for many folks right now (whose law is it that "programming 
expands to fill the CPU cycles available"?)

Worst example I saw ran over 1 million (really) SQL queries per page 
load, and then ran 35 queries based on each result, just to populate a 
page with a subset of the ~1 million items a page *could* be 
displaying.... it went from a 4 hour script (per page generated!) to 
under 3 seconds per page once I was done with it. Sadly, I'm not making 
this up.

And of course, how one *thinks* about distributing tasks over boxes 
also makes a difference. I tend to balance out tasks across multiple 
boxen, for redundancy. I also tend to prefer custom-written software, 
as generic F/OSS software often tends to spend lots of CPU cycles on 
things most of my clients don't need.

MediaWiki? Ah, well..... MediaWiki does not have the best of 
optimizations applied, which is why it can barely manage a page per 
second on slowish hardware (and why squid is taking the brunt of the 
load for wikipedia, 18 squids for 93 apache/PHP boxen). It (MediaWiki) 
wasn't written as a web page program so much as a program which outputs 
web pages... and that's not always the fastest way to write dynamic PHP 
pages. :-)

I'm using coherenthosting.com out of Portland.  They are UML and very steady. 
They are more expensive than the numbers I've seen on this list in answer to 
your question but you pay for what you get. I'm very satisfied with them, 
running production web servers and email there.

Subject: [PLUG] OSDL & the Kernel Community
Message-ID: <20060209173259.GP11927@syrinxpc.com>

OK, this is week-old news via LWN, but I think it's relevant here.

Greg Kroah-Hartman has often criticized how the OSDL interacts with the
Linux Kernel community, and I've long been in agreement.  (And not
*just* because I hated my boss there.)

Well, he's gone and done something about it.  He and several other
kernel-devs got together and submitted a set of far-reaching proposals
to the OSDL board.  The board agreed to every stinkin' one of them!

http://www.kroah.com/log/2006/01/26/#osdl_board_proposal

At least six of those proposals have been long-running gripes of mine,
things I thought were obvious, so if the OSDL hadn't implemented them,
they weren't gonna.  But they *did*.

I guess it (a) is not always as obvious to the brass as it is to techies 
and (b) depends on the presentation.

Also proves something Keith Lofstrom said a while ago:
"Windows comes out of a box.  Linux comes out of a community." 

Have fun,
  Aaron

It's a continuation of an event that's been hosted for many, many years.
Folks get together and offer Linux help to anyone who comes in.

So if you can't figure out how to get that WiFi card working on your

Wonderful for small-time home sites, not reliable enough for anything
with money involved.

Home 'net connections go down all the time.  Servers you own go down all
the time.  Small Business 'net connections go down all the time.  Any of
these outages could keep potential customers away from your business for
days while they are investigated and repaired.  And what about power
outages?

While that kind of stuff does happen in a more professional data center,
they are far far less common.

A (for example) RackSpace hosted solution would still give full control and fits
my definition of "self hosted."  You have your virtual machine under your full
control, they have the responsibility of keeping it up and connected to the world.

   Are you a linux advocate living in Washington state? If so, it's time to
visit your state legislators and pound your shoe on their desks demanding
that the state make available their information gathering tools to all
citizens under an open standard.

   If you visit the Dept. of Natural Resources web site, and wander over to
their Forest Practices/Desired Future Condition Worksheet page
<http://www.dnr.wa.gov/forestpractices/dfc/> you'll see that this is a
Winduhs application. Now, I agree that when they say that one's computer must
use Winduhs 95 or better, linux and OS X certainly apply to the "better"
part, but it's closed off to us. That's not right.

   Coop? Where are you? Do you have a twin in Olympia?

I have Cyrillic fonts and keyboard drivers installed

Hi Robert Kopp.

I did some digging and from what I found, running the following commands 
should fix your problem:

# mkfontdir /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/local
# mkfontdir /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/CID

You can double-check my research by going to 
http://wiki.x.org/wiki/FAQErrorMessages and scrolling down to
Section 1.1. Keep looking until you find "mkfontdir".


I hope this helps.

Wow.  Next you will only be able to drive a specific make and model of 
car on WA highways.  I really like the portion that goes

"Forest practices applications must be submitted with a printout from 
the DFC 1.1.12 version"

So run Windows or don't apply!

However, the fonts.dir that it makes is empty except
for a "0" at the bottom. Yet the binary mkfontdir is

Chris,

I gotta tell ya, www.webhostfreaks.com is a great isp. They have cpanel 
if you like it. I switched over to them from lunarpages, because they 
were cheaper, but have found that they have been very reliable. I plan 
on keeping them for as long as I need the site. You can pay monthly or 
get it even cheaper if you pay yearly. They offer unlimited email as 
well. (Accessed through your client or web apps. Squirl, or one of the 
other two.)

Rod,

   That's why I think it's a linux/OSS issue.

   The Oregon Dept. of State Lands and US Army Corps of Engineers provide
templates for their permit applications as Word files. I never had any
problems importing thowse into WordPerfect/Linux or OO.o and working with
them that way. Not once did either agency have an issue with my submitting
the applications on my version of the forms.

   Massachusettes, as you well know, just went through a very bloody fight
with Microsoft over their adoption of ODF for all documents produced by the
executive branch of government. Of course, Microsoft _could_ easily support
that data format, just like every other proprietary vendor has agreed to do,
but it doesn't fit their business model. I suspect that opening Washington
state public documents to everyone will be more difficult.

   I'm not a resident there so anything I write or say will be ignored.

   I wonder if anyone else has found that the upgrade from Firefox-1.0.7 to
-1.5 has changed the was the ad block extension works. Or, is it something
here that I lost?

   In 1.0.x versions I had the ad block extension in place and once I had
marked the frames/images in the sites I regularly visited, they no longer
appeared. Now it appears that the blocking is momentary at best. I have
popups blocked in the preferences as well as having installed the proper
version of the extension.

Suggestions welcome,

As we know Oracle bought the company that
is currently the core to MySQL's future,
InnoDB. As their web site now sez'
"Innobase Oy is an Oracle company" right next
to the MySQL logo. Although Oracle will not
say what is going to happen when the
MySQL/InnoDB contract runs out next year, and
yes the code is GPL, but .. 

Oracle has made bids for

      Zend - The core engine behind PHP
 SleepyCat - Berkeley DB
     JBoss - J2EE Server and other

http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2006/tc20060209_810527.htm

At least one Oracle corp. blog has said that once
the InnoDB contract is over, it will not renew 
with MySQL.

I have met Ellison, and remember him saying in
a conference that he will do anything he can
to eliminate any potential competition.

The legislators may not pay much attention to you, but they would pay 
attention to WA businesses you deal with. If you have a close enough 
relationship with any of them, you could put this same bug in their 
ears. Are you in touch with any [water resources]* folks in WA? Maybe 
they would be interested in the problem.

Hello PLUG,

I am Kendrick's sister Christine.  I would like to ask your help with 
getting the news to PLUG of Kendrick's untimely death yesterday Wed Feb 8th.

Here is the link to the Oregon Live 
http://www.oregonlive.com/search/index.ssf?/base/news/1139451966239040.xml?oregonian?lcps&coll=7

We need to ask help from PLUG.  Kendrick's computer has Linux on it, 
and none of his close family or friends know how to access it.  We'd 
like to use his email list to send out news to his friends that he's 
gone.  Could one of your members who knew Kendrick be available to help us?

You can reach me at perala at pacifier.com, or on 503.826.1839.  Please 
do post the news for his friends at PLUG.

Thank you,

Christine Perala

How are you starting X?  I've never seen a fontpath error/warning like
that cause X to not work -- my first guess is that this is a red
herring, and the problem lies with a porrly configured .xsession or
.xinitcr in your user's home dir.  Can you provide those files for the
user that is having problems?

Does this mean the old accounts have their own XF86Config (or
Xorg.conf) files?  I wasn't aware you could install fonts on a
per-user basis, so I don't know the implications of this.  I am
curious, though.

Since the "John Smith" account was functioning
(john) and the other unprivileged accounts were not, I
thought I'd log in as root and bring john and timmy up
in separate viewers to compare the hidden files in
them. And what did I find? In the john account,
.fonts.cache-1 had a full list of fonts, while the
corresponding file in timmy had a bunch of crap in it.
Gently I right clicked that file and clicked "delete."
Then I copied the corresponding John Smith file to
timmy. And reset the X-server!

It would be a good idea to keep .fonts.cache-1 out of
harm's way, so I copied it to another dirctory outside
any conceivable search path. Refreshing this file once
every two weeks, should it happen again, is not too
much effort.

And here are the contents of the "corrupt"
.fonts.cache-1:

"/home/timmy/.fonts" 0 1138006406 ".dir"

An answer, but I hope there's a better long-term solution.  Possibly, 
you've acquired an unstable version of something in a recent upgrade 
(most likely via dependencies.)  Maybe you can catch the culprit by 
running a perl daemon built with SGI::FAM and dumping a ps listing to a 
log.  (Though I make no guarantees about that guess.)

On a mildly related note and just for the sake of useful archives, I'll 
mention that I recently broke my X in a completely different way.  KDM 
wouldn't start on reboot because I had recently reformatted my /tmp/ 
partition and forgotten to set it as world-writable!

Subject: [PLUG] Debugging APM for 2.6 kernels - ideas?
Message-ID: <20060211231226.GA4295@gate.kl-ic.com>


I am *still* bringing up 2.6.9 on my T30 laptop, a version of RHEL4.2
called Scientific Linux, maintained by Fermilabs.  This is a clean
install - I have not kept any old apps or configs out of the previous
2.4.22 that has run on this laptop for ages.

Unfortunately, like the 2.6 kernel that came with SUSE10, the pesky
thing occasionally hangs coming out of suspend (blinking caps-lock
and scroll-lock, often a sign of kernel panics).  I have not yet
found a repeatable pattern, and I have tried a few dozen things to
see if they stop the hangs.  I am using APM, having (as one of my
frobs) turned off all the APIC stuff, since some folks on various
lists out there think that is the problem.

Is there anything I can run, or compile into the kernel, to capture
some data on what is causing the panics?  There is nothing revealing
in the logs now.  Return-from-suspend is a particularly nasty time
for things to go wrong.

I am not very interested in more suggested frobs, unless you have
actual experience on a similar laptop with a similar kernel.  I am
more interested in finding out WHY this is happening, and that
is best accomplished through observation and information capture.

Keith,

   Why that version? I have 2.6.13.4 running on my Sony Vaio. I've not seen
any problems when I shut the door for a while, then open it again. Is there
something unique about that kernel version that makes it preferred on your
T30?

Just curious,

Rich

Both the Windows and Linux versions seem to working OK for me. I find

I have an out-of-town friend who is obese.  He eats far too much.
He doesn't like doctors, who tell him to eat less and exercise, 
but cannot provide him with a pill that will cause him to lose
weight (while still eating too much).  He wants to fix his eating
problem by ... eating.  A very modern consumer attitude, I
suppose, but not my style.

I would rather have enlightenment than enlargement.  My natural
tendency when encountering a problem is not to consume something
more, but to try to understand the problem.  Frobbing kernels will
not help me understand what is going on with this one - unless
someone has evidence that there is a known problem in 2.6.9 that
causes this hangup which was fixed in later kernels.  I switched
FROM a distro that uses 2.6.13-15.7, which had a somewhat similar
lockup problem (and many other problems), partly because so far
there is little written about these later kernels. 

So I repeat my question -

HOW DO I OBSERVE WHAT IS GOING ON DURING AN APM RETURN-FROM-SUSPEND ???

If 2.6.13+ kernels provide some new feature that increases
observability during return-from-suspend, I am interested. 
Otherwise, trying yet another kernel is not interesting, even if
it does have a small chance of making this particular problem
happen less often.  Without understanding and tools, I am at the
mercy of the next problem that comes along, and unable to help
others.  I will leave the "upgrade and hope the new bugs are
better than the old bugs" approach to the Micro-softheads.  If
I can observe the problem, I can help fix the kernel.

And if you want to question from tools and kernel debugging to
"why newest is best", please change the subject line, OK?

I think you would get better answers on how to debug this by asking on
LKML, or perhaps by asking your distro.  You cannot blame people for
trying to answer with the quick fix, since that is more often than not
what people really want.

Since I'm guessing you can't see the kernel panic (since you mention
the keyboard blinking) you probably need to figure out how to *get*
the kernel panic output, since that would be the most useful to the
developers.  If you are not seeing the dump because you're putting
your laptop to sleep from X, then try putting it to sleep from a
virtual console.  If that doesn't work, you'll have to try one of the
crash dump patches or remote network crash dump patches.  I believe
RedHat kernels have netdump built in, so you could investigate
enabling that and setting up the netdump server on a remote machine. 
Of course that might not work since going to S3 likely turns off your
NIC, and I don't know how netdump works upon going back to S0.

So, in summary, since what I said is probably not all that useful, try
LKML.  Of course LKML is not likely to help you unless you're running
the latest kernel.  So we go back to the beginning.

Subject: [PLUG] The command line hates me
Message-ID: <43EE77A5.9354.2C3D8F23@localhost>

OK, trying to make a backup to my pocket USB drive. I do this 
only about once a month, because in between I copy files over 
ethernet to a folder on my Windows 2000 desktop. I use dump to 
make the backup to the pocket drive, then I delete the files from 
the Windows share.

So today I decide it's about time to make a backup to the pocket 
drive. I put the cable in a USB port, open my special file where I 
keep command lines that I can never remember, then copy and 
paste the dump command line to a terminal:

sudo dump 0uf /media/usbdisk/<filename>

And after I give it my pass it says:

DUMP: must specify disk or filename
DUMP: the ENTIRE dump is aborted

The command I pasted in worked last time (after changing the 
filename, of course.)

So I'm thinking, for some reason Ubuntu-64 Breezy can't see the 
pocket drive. Opening Konqueror it appears to be mounted. And I 
changed files on it by renaming them, so it must be mounted. And 
just for good measure, I shut down and restarted. But it still gives 
me the same error message. 

I also typed "mount" and it gave me a list of things of which I have 
no ken. However, I did not see /media/cdrom0 in the mess.

Any ideas what I am doing wrong?

I'm skeptical of this. Unless this is a really old machine (<800MHz) ACPI
is likely good. Or perhaps I'm biased against APM because on
multi-processor machines it is ACPI or nothing.

What this does sound like is borderline hardware/BIOS. If the BIOS isn't
careful and either assumes the machine is in a state that other OSes
never change or fail to restore such state suspend/resume become
Russian Roulette. Suspend/resume is always a bit of a risky proposition
as you're trusting the BIOS writers to of done their job well.

Seems unlikely the network hardware would be brought back up if the rest
of the kernel fails on resume. Trying a VT does seem plausible as that is
more likely to come back on resume. Another optimistic approach if the
network hardware comes back would be to do remote-sysloging and see if
anything shows up there. A serial console would also be a place to look.

You're either leaving out the archive name or the filesystem name. The
'f' option needs to be directly followed by the archive/output filename,
and then after that you specify the name of the filesystem you wish to
save.

Ah. That was it. For some reason the / at the end of the command 
was not saved in the text file where I save little-used commands. 
Duh!

My main problem with the command line is that the error 
messages are hard to figure out. I assumed "must specify disk or 
filename" referred to the destination, not the source. That led me to 
assume that the USB disk was somehow not mounted, a common 
problem for me. (Don't get me started on mount problems.) It never 
occurred to me that it was the source that was missing. OK, it was 
late at night. :(

Thanks. :)

Dale,

   It could be coincidence, but I don't know for sure. I saw something
yesterday that suggests there's a way to see the list of blocks and edit it.
I'll try to find how to do this.

Dick,

   All my clients are beholden to Microsoft for all their computer software.
I don't know of a single business in the industries I server, or in the trade
associations that represent them, that uses linux. That written, there were a
couple of IT guys at a silver mine in Nevada who played with linux at home.
That was four years ago, however.

   I suspect that this is a non-issue to everyone I know (with a single
exception).

   Is 'enlightenment' the next spam fad?

   You know that I'm not a linux guru by any means. When I asked why that
kernel it was because I thought that each kernel release brought with it new
capabilities or fixes for things that did not work as well as desired. But,
you're absolutely correct that I mis-worded my question. What I should have
asked was, "Have you looked to see if a newer kernel solved that particular
problem?"

   If I may gently poke fun at you, your insistence on a solution using the
2.6.9 kernel ("I want to do it my way!") seems to be analogous to your
friend's attitude. I certainly did not mean to frustrate you by asking a
question which you read differently than I intended. I will presume that Rob
meant the same thing: has this issue been defrobbed in a newer kernel?

Sorry for the misunderstanding,

Rich

John,

   When you get a case of late-night indigestion from the command line, take
one 'man <command>' and see if that provides relief. Now, I don't have a
'dump' command in my shell, but I'm confident that if you have a command to
use then it is documented somewhere.

I will look into netdump - there is an init script for that in my
distro (RHEL4.2) and documentation on the web.  I will report back
to the list when I figure out what is going on.

The LKML folk will indeed want the latest kernel - which will break
other things, unfortunately.  So my best option is to FIND the bug,
and verify that it is still in the sources for 2.6.666 or whatever,
and post that to LKML.  I have a feeling that it is something related
to the T30, or to 1GB of RAM, or an 80GB Toshiba hard disk, or
something else that was not anticipated when APM was updated to 2.6.X .  

Jason, thank you for your on-target help.  I realize I got a little
testy with the "try a new kernel" answers.  My apologies to Rich
and Rob for my impatience.

I have had many bad experiences with a new component A breaking B, C,
D, E, F ... followed by a horrific journey of restoration from Anew
back to Aold.  This is especially awful when the wholesale component
replacement is caused by some thoughtlessly written install script,
or by some "helpful" person at a clinic who frobs on my machine 
attempting to get A running, doesn't suceed, and breaks many other
things in the process.  That approach isn't Linux specific, it is
worse for Windoze - but it is an approach to "problem solving" that
pervades software and really jerks my chain.  You can't manage
complexity that way.

A former boss once taught me that "too many things that oughta work
is a NOT-oughta work".  You move from *oughta* to *guaranteed*
through observation, understanding, and meticulous testing and
assumption checking.  You don't get great leaps of functionality
that way, but you don't get massive rewrites from scratch, either.
Just steady accumulative progress.  That said, open source software
is closer to this accumulative process than anything else that
software people do, which is why it is advancing while Microsoft
appears stalled.

My rebuild would be a lot easier if I wasn't trying to run so many odd
things - emulators and proprietary CAD tools, plus the usual mix of
compilers, wifi, media codecs, and common apps, all in the mostly
closed hardware environment of a laptop.  It is good when I finally
have it working, but boy-oh-boy I wish there were many more diagnostic
tools to get me there.

That's why automated backups are important.  Yeah, it's not exactly 
something that you can put in a cron job since you would have to make 
sure that the usb stick is plugged in.  It's possible to trigger the 
job with udev, but that's maybe too complicated for right now.

But, something very simple that you can do to remove the possibility of 
typos from your backup process:  make a script.  Just pick any 
directory in your $PATH (run "echo $PATH" to see it) that seems 
appropriate and make a file like:

  #!/bin/sh
  sodo dump <correct options and filenames>

Assuming that file is "/usr/local/bin/johnbackup", you then only need to 
set it as executable (chmod 755) and then you can just run "johnbackup" 
and forget about the details.

Just one notch more automated than copy/paste from your notes.

PHP settings are per-apache process and per-script execution.... they 
can all use their own config, or a separate config per process. Depends 
on the server setup.

If you are asking if web user 'a' sets $foo = bar, well, web user 'b' 
cannot see it. PHP globals only exist per-request. They aren't "global" 
per web server instance, or "global" for much of anything beyond an 
individual user request.

As far as the setting itself (in php.ini scripts), register_globals is 
a band aid. It merely looks to see if a malicious request is a 
GET/POST/COOKIE. Smart folks who are hacking sites will already know 
how to set up a request to break things. It's (register_globals) 
basically a dumb PHP emulation of Perl's taint mode, but it's not done 
in the same way, thus, it's not really much in the way of protection,

Anyways, if you have three sites, two of which are programmed with 
register_globals off, and the third requires that setting to be on, the 
two original sites, if coded weakly, *could* become more vulnerable 
when responding to requests, if they use the same apache instance, and 
PHP settings.

Let me give you an example of what I mean. I have heard the terms 
"volume," "partition," "drive," "extended partition," "active partition," 
and several others relating to disk drives. I have no idea what the 
differences in meaning are. And no, don't try to explain to me here 
or refer me to a website with the answers. I can read the answers, 
but it just goes in one ear and out the other. You see, I learn 
nothing until I actually use the knowledge. I can read it and 15 
minutes later I have no idea what I just read. But if I get into a 
crunch and use something to solve a problem -- now I will 
remember it. But even then, I remember only what I needed in order 
to solve the problem, and for a relatively short time. Sometimes 
you comp sci guys forget how long you have been doing this stuff. :)

And why did I bring up disk drives for an example? Well, because I 
got bit this morning with a disk drive problem. I tried to log in and 
couldn't. The error message was that it could not write to my 
authority file. (This was after aborting a dump when it couldn't write 
to the pocket drive any more, and a subsequent shutdown and 
restart.) From past experience I have learned how to get out 
Gnome and into a command line (and back again, thanks, 
Adrienne). So from the command line (and using my Windows 
computer which gives me access to the internet), I was able to 
determine that the disk drive on the laptop was full. I mean totally 
full.

And that brings me to a new question. Why is it full?

The drive is 60 Gb, with a 1.5 Gb swap partition and a 55Gb main 
partition for Linux and everything installed on it, plus my Linux 
data. The remainder is formatting overhead.

I already knew I had two huge folders with mp3 files. One contained 
the originals after ripping, and the other contained the same mp3s, 
but as exported from my iPod with gtkpod. The latter folder was the 
"keeper" because some of the tags had been edited. The originals 
were superfluous, so I nuked that whole folder. That freed up about 
7 Gb. Then I was able to log in.

Once I logged in I used Konqueror to move the other folder to a 
USB disk hanging on my Windows computer. That freed up 
another 7 Gb. When I do df -h it tells me that I have 14 Gb available 
out of 55. Now, the only other data I have on this computer is 
various homework files, mostly done in OpenOffice.org, and 
Konqueror tells me that they total 1.5 Gb.

So does Ubuntu-64 Breezy together with my installed programs 
take up 39.5 Gb? I thought Linux was supposed to be lean and 
efficient. :):)

Obviously, somewhere I have some big-ass file(s) that are sucking 
up my disk space. Probably they are unnecessary, left over from 
some process that failed to delete them when it finished. I checked 
/tmp and it has only half a dozen tiny files in it. And the dump 
process from earlier this morning did write to the pocket drive, not 
the laptop drive. And I have Show Hidden Files checked.

I also did a right-click for Properties for each folder from the root in 
Konqueror. The big folders were:

chroot	3.4 GB
home	1.5 GB
proc	1.2 GB
usr		2.1 GB

Everything else came to about 600 MB, so the whole thing is well 
under 9 GB. What is eating up the remaining 30 GB?

Oh, and the dump this morning got to 18 GB before it asked for 
another volume because the pocket drive was full. The previous 
dump was 22 GB. So whatever is taking up the disk space is 
getting backed up by dump.

How do I find the mystery files?

   This is true if you're trying to learn the command from the man page. But,
if you know what command you want but need to check the syntax then the man
page is what you want. You don't need to read beyond the synopsis at the top
unless you're looking for the appropriate option.

Message-ID: <20060212202600.GA24085@gate.kl-ic.com>


This might shade towards plug-talk, but I thought I should give reasons
why I was adamant about a 2.6.9 kernel.  Others might find this useful.

I am not a computer professional.  While I would enjoy spending full
time tweaking on new kernels and installing software, I am theoretically
a full-time chip designer, which in the heat of design can require an
80 hour a week commitment.  There are slack periods (like the one I am
in now) where I can work on upgrading computers and tracking long-standing
annoyances.  However, this slack period will end soon, and at the end
of it I must have a laptop with a stable software suite, while permitting
critical security-related upgrades.  A supported distro is a good way
to get there.

I run some professional ($$K) CAD tools for designing integrated circuits.
These are written around transistor models that are produced by fabs,
which are extremely complicated and very exacting.  The fabs usually
produce numbers for mostly-closed circuit simulation models (HSPICE
modified BSIM4) and for geometry testing (Mentor Calibre) which can
be read by a very small set of closed-source professional CAD tools.
Only a very few of those run under Linux, and they typically are 
targetted on distros like Redhat 5 and Redhat 7 (!!!!).  They often
run some nasty binary-only copy protection code.  It usually requires
an annoying amount of kernel tweaking to get them to run on something
more modern - the last time I tried this was with RH9.

Yes, there are some open source tools, but these are like TRS80 basic
compared to GCC in terms of capability.  You cannot read the wafer fab
data with them, they do not have the proprietary models.  There are
some capable open-source models (EKV, Philips) out there, but the
wafer fabs don't generate data for them.  At a conference last week,
I talked with a senior researcher from Philips, and even they don't
have the influence necessary to make fabs like TSMC and UMC (and IBM!)
produce data for the open models.  When that changes, I will get out
of the proprietary tools and into open ones very quickly.  Until
then, I still have chips to design.

I used to be a Redhat fanboy (7x 8x 9x) - the major upgrades were
fairly painless, and the up2date service took care of security
needs.  Then they started retiring distros early, while the
still-supported RHEL distros were pretty ancient and constrained. 
I tried Fedora Core, but the support for those distros vanish soon
after their initial release.  

Two well supported distros emerged from a recent search - SUSE, and 
the Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)-derived Scientific Linux (SL). 
CENTOS was another RHEL derivative that looked interesting, but SL
has some full time staffers at Fermilabs and a commitment to keep
it updated approximately forever.  I gave SUSE a try first - it
installed cleanly, and their support is good.  However, the SUSE
universe is a little insular;  while they provide a large set of
near-bleeding-edge software, they don't update very well outside
their own community.  SL/RHEL had the edge there, but the decision
was close.  What pushed me firmly into SL is the close ties with
the Fedora project;  while I don't want to depend on the zero-
support-for-last-weeks-distro Fedora legacy support, the online
information that the Fedora debug process generates is awesome. 
If I have a problem with SL/RHEL4.2 , I can often find an answer
related to Fedora Core 3.  Yes, FC4 and FCt5 are more bleeding
edge, but I have a job to do.

So I now have an RHEL4.2 clone running.  It comes with a 2.6.9
kernel.  I could certainly install a 2.6.666 bleeding edge kernel,
and sometimes I may do that and set it up as a boot option, but
the SL folks won't be supporting it or providing security updates,
while I can get them for the 2.6.9 they do support .   Again, Murphy's
Law almost guarantees that I will need to do a critical security
update during an 80-hour-a-week design marathon, and that had better
be no more than a 30 minute download, patch, and reboot.  I can (and
do) run all sorts of crazy stuff on my experimental machine, but
I am as dependent on this production laptop as I am on my eyeglasses. 
No screwing around allowed.

Now, back to tweaking and debug.  netdump looks promising ...

A couple things...

While Linux *can* be very efficient with disk space usage, more often
than not (on desktop systems, especially) it is not.  Things like
prelinking are used to speed up launches, sometimes debugging symbols
aren't stripped, and things just aren't optimized for space.  They're
optimized for speed.

Additionally, your Ubuntu-64 setup is doubled.  You've got your regular
64-bit stuff and then you've got a whole bunch of stuff you've installed
in your chroot environment.  A lot of your stuff is duplicated by that
setup, wasting tons of space.

If you're concerned about space, there are ways to shrink stuff down...
although 39.5GB is excessive either way.  There's probably something
large lurking about.

Keith-

Pardon my ignorance... but if you're paying them to support 2.6.9 and if
you upgraded to 2.6.whateverisnew they would no longer provide you your
support... why don't you request they support your 2.6.9 and figure out
WTF is wrong with 2.6.9's APM?  :-)

See my recent desperate message. Something large is, indeed, 
lurking around. And it's evil and it's growing. I can't even log in. I 
free up space and, without even touching the computer, within 
minutes the disk is full again. If this was Windows I'd think it was a 
virus.

Apologies if I missed this already in the discussion- did you try booting with 
Knoppix, and examining your drive from there?

What removed the option of using Debian? Quite inferior, but `alien` does
allow installation of RPM packages; and if they're using mature
libraries, Debian is likely to have sufficiently recent ones.

Yeah, I prefer to choose my fights. Continuous breakage does not seem a
worthwhile fight.

I'm more worried today than I was last night, but that and non-X VT seem
the only options.

   Thanks Pete. That's an interesting list. I suspect that the DAS up there
has no more influenence on other departments that it would down here. But, I
may drop them a line and enquire.

The settings in php.ini are global.

You can override those settings on a per-site basis in the Apache
configuration (sometimes even in .htaccess):

Hello,
  Does anybody know of a <some graphics format>2<something in ascii>
program that can be run from the command line?  Preferably one that has
the same "high quality" rendering that aa-lib will do.   I've googled
for a while now but can't find anything decent; they either output ascii
 that doesn't use the shape of the characters to increase the effective
resolution (imagemagick) or are keyboard interface only (aview, cacaview).

Yes I have looked at that and I mentioned that in my original question.
 They don't have a command line only version of their tool available as

With Keith's help the problem is resolved. Evidently when you tell 
Dump to "Abort" it doesn't stop running; it just takes it upon itself 
to find another place to continue the backup. So when I unplugged 
my USB pocket drive this morning after telling Dump to abort, 
Dump appeared to quit but, in fact, continued writing to the mount 
point instead of the USB disk. 

After shutting down and restarting, and then shelling to a command 
line and deleting even more files, I still couldn't log in. It seems that 
if the backup wasn't finished, Dump will restart itself the minute the 
computer is turned back on, and then continue to write the backup 
file.

When I got home from FreeGeek this evening and had time to look, 
there was a 26 GB backup file in /media/usbdisk. No wonder my 
laptop's hard disk kept getting filled up. The more files I deleted, 
the more dump added to the backup file, keeping my hard disk at 
100% used.

So now I'm back shopping for a decent backup solution. Everything 
is either massive, designed for huge networked environments with 
thousands of users, or hopelessly buggy and useless (e.g., Simple 
Backup). Why can't Linux have a simple little one-user utility to 
back up to an external hard disk?

There is such a simple backup utility, it is just not called backup.
It is called rsync. Here is an outline of a script for doing simple backups.

#!/bin/bash
some command to mount your usb drive
/usr/bin/rsync --verbose --archive --one-file-system --delete   /

For future consideration, there are more complex variations of this
you can do, like daily  rotating backups etc.

Sorry, this should've gone out a few hours ago.

Rick from Free Geek called a meeting for today, and several folks from
PLUG and from FreeGeek got together to discuss the Linux Clinic.  
We had a good talk and nailed down some details.

Next step is for Rick and I to attend the Freegeek Council meeting
Wednesday night (same time as the AT meeting, durn it) and make our
pitch.  I'm crossing my fingers, but I think it should go well.  
I've heard nothing but positive reactions from Free Geek folks.

More Wednesday,

Well, I am and I don't build kernels either.  I cannot remember the last
time I actually built a kernel from source.  Building and tweaking like
that is fun for messing around with (or doing actual kernel
development), but I manage too many systems to not pursue
standardization and uniformity.

But, you do realize that what you wrote above is Greek to me, 
right? Wait ... as a linguistics major I might be able to piece it out if 
it were in Greek. I couldn't write a script if my life depended on it. 
Not even if I spent ten years using Linux. That's from lack of 
motivation. If I have to become a programmer to run Linux, then I 
might as well just wipe out the hard disk and install Windows. Or 
buy a Mac or something. I tried programming once and it was a 
horrible, frustrating experience. I totally hate it and I'm too ornery to 
do things I hate.

Rsync has been suggested to me before. I tried to read the 
documentation, but found it incomprehensible. I couldn't even figure 
out what the basic purpose of the program was.

The point I want to make is that most everything available for 
Windows is available in Linux, and in a GUI that equals the 
Windows equivalent, sometimes even exceeding it -- except a 
simple user-friendly backup utility. In Linux there is just nothing 
that a dummy can use to back up a standalone computer to an 
external hard disk on an as-needed basis. Simple Backup is a nice 
start, but it has a long way to go.

So if you *are* a programmer, here is a great opportunity. :)

Hate to tell ya, but you might not want to return that license on
Windows Refund Day then.  Or maybe you just haven't realized yet that
every time you type a command you're effectively programming...

Do you know what a bash script is?  It's essentially a series of
commands that are run in order.  Can you type a command from bash?  Can
you type two of them, one after the other?  Then you can write a bash
script.

If that is all really too complicated for you, you don't sound like
Linux's target market.  If you have no qualms about remaining ignorant
about how and why a computer works the way it does, I would suggest you
seriously consider moving back to Microsoft-land.  Or get a Mac.  But
Linux doesn't quite seem like a good fit for you, from where I stand.

I think PLUG should make it a policy that the next (and possibly
subsequent) time someone says "RAID" when someone asks "Backup", that
person shall be required to buy a round of drinks after the next general
meeting.

RAID protects against some disk failures, but not agains numerous other
sorts of hardware failures, nor human error. In particular RAID does not
substitute for backups at all.


On the original topic, I'd stick with `dump`. It is very effective. Just
perhaps your notetaking method needs to be enhanced somehow. Perhaps by
having it refer to a tiny little script, perhaps by being more verbose in
your notes. We are doing our best to keep it simple, but there is some
complexity involved. Are those GUIs you mention truely any simpler than
good text documentation?

Well, I used dump because I finally figured out a command line that 
would work. Except I didn't save it correctly to the document where 
I save command line things that I need once in a while but can't 
remember. However, having been stung by it, I am now so leery of 
it that I want to have nothing to do with it. For the time being I am 
going to just drag and drop my /home/jjj folder to a share on my 
Windows computer from time to time, as needed. That will keep 
critical stuff safe until I can find something better.

As for the GUI stuff -- yeah, it is way better. On my Windows 
computer, with an attached external 250 GB USB drive, I launch 
BackUpMyPC, make a couple mouse clicks, type in the name of 
the backup file, and the backup is underway. And when it finishes 
it is always right. It never stops suddenly in the middle and wants 
volume 2. If the backup media I have chosen will not hold the 
backup I told it to do, it would tell me that before I start the backup.

Have you even looked? A google search for "Linux graphical backup" returns a 
lot of useful information. Like this page: 
http://www.linux.org/apps/all/Administration/Backup.html

While I sympathize with your frustration, I lose patience with PC users who 
refuse to learn things, or rant about the quality of free help they are 
getting. Perhaps hiring some help is the best option. Have you bought any 
books? There are lots of good ones. Have you tried the manuals for your Linux 
distribution? The Internet is cram-full of great Linux howtos- and you never 
have to leave your chair. It doesn't get any easier.

You've forgotten how many years you have invested in learning your way around 
Windows. Windows is not easy- look at all the thousands of Windows howto 
books. Macs aren't instantly perfect either- 'Mac OS X: The Missing Manual, 
Tiger Ed, and 'Switching to the Mac: The Missing Manual, Tiger Edition' have 
been in the O'Reilly top 25 for months.

When you can get into the system, run "du -h --max-depth=1 /" and see 
where the space is getting eaten. (Keep descending down until you isolate 
where the problem is at.  I would guess something is dumping into 
var (like log files) and spinning out of control.

Of course I have looked. I have already tried half a dozen and found them all 
wanting in one way or another. And one of them was dump, so obviously I am not 
averse to using the command line, as long as it can be done by a beginner.

First, my Linux distrbution did not come with any manuals. And yes, I have been 
to Powell's and have several books on my shelf. The problem, which you Linux 
gurus fail to grasp, is that I can't UNDERSTAND the books. I don't have the 
vocabulary.

Not at all. I never said Windows was easier for a beginner to use than Linux. What 
I said was that *backup utilities* for beginners are better on Windows than on 
Linux. In fact, I said that was the only lack.

So thanks for the link, because you did provide me with one more possibility 
that I hadn't found before. But also please note that all the backup solutions that 
you network admins think are so awesome are useless for a single user with a 
standalone computer. That's my point. Linux has been a network server OS for 
so long that there are lots of solutions for that environment. But now that people 
want to use it on a home desktop, there is stuff that still needs development. 
That's where Windows is still ahead.

So go ahead and be pissed off at me for criticizing Linux if you want to. Lose 
all the patience you want, and go ahead and assume I refuse to learn new 
things. Of course, that can't be true, or I wouldn't be using Linux at all, now 
would I? After all, I have a spare Windows 2000 license I'm not using. I could 
just as easily have installed it on my laptop as Linux.

I calls 'em the way I sees 'em, and I'm too ornery to be worried about it. :)

Now I have to get some homework done and get my obstinate ass off to 
school. When I get home tonight I will play with KDar and see how it goes. 
Thanks for helping me find it.

   Nonsense on your "ditto." The one mission critical application I demanded
before I moved my business to linux in 1997 was a reliable backup program. I
bought a license to BRU and have used it since then. My company is not
enterprise-level; I've had no more than two workstation/servers and a few
portables here. Several years ago I stopped upgrading because version 17.1
does everything I need it to do and it has worked flawlessly for more than 8
years now. It's used every night except Saturday and Sunday; incremental
backups daily and full backups weekly.

   Instead of trying to prove that we're all wrong, John, take a careful look
at what you write when you ask for help. If you're not willing to learn new
things then 1) you should not be using linux at all, and 2) you probably are
no better in a university classroom than you are in this mail list. Education
means being exposed to new things, and putting in the effort to learn them.
If you want to be educated you need to accept that the world works in may
different ways, and if you want to shift from one way to another then do so
willingly and not trying to make the world work your way. Instead of being
open to learning and finding new -- and better -- ways of doing things, you
ask for help then come up with extensive excuses why the advice is no good.
If you don't like the answers, don't ask the questions.

   Change is inevitable ... except from a vending machine.

What distribution are you using?  And I agree  A LOT of books are really
no help till you already have a grasp on the fact.  The other thing is
bind fate.   Just believe, without totally understanding, that if you
throw this switch lights will come on...  You throw the switch and sure

back and attempt to see why.... Or just accept that fact that.. Throwing

I'm in the same boat as you regarding Linux system admistration and 
ability/time to learn to do everything myself (and then remember it 
later!)  The solution I found was to simply hire a guru for the stuff I 
couldn't deal with, get it done right, and then concern myself with 
learning to use the applications I was interested in. At least this way 
I have time to learn the things I want to learn without having to repel 
boarders and keep the ship from sinking. I don't think you're going to 
score points asking for help on things that you can't resolve due to 
lack of inexperience, ability, interest or time, and then complain about 
the help offered. If you depend on your Linux system for business or 
some other mission-critical purpose, then get an expert, and later when 
you're not desparately bailing, trying to keep your system afloat, 
you'll have some peace and time to learn the things you need or want to 
learn.

Or, if you're like me, decide that you will probably never know enough 
about servers and security, and just pay someone to do it for you, 
freeing you up to fool around with the applications and less 
system-critical stuff. I've been *a lot* happier with my Linux system 
and office network ever since I realized that. And it cost me a lot less 
than it did in my (otherwise billable) time to repair my system every 
time some daemon crapped on the floor or some script-kiddie exploited 
something stupid I did.

Well, actually, I have a 4.0 cume in my graduate courses. And my 
undergraduate degree was cum laude. So I guess I am capable of 
learning in the university. 

The point, which you touched on, is that I am not interested in 
knowing certain things. As Vram said, just knowing that the light 
switch makes the light come on is enough for some people. Now, 
in fact, being a homeowner, I have had to learn how to do house 
wiring. I have also been using computers long enough that I have 
built my own desktops for the last couple computers. And why did I 
learn how to do those things? Because I had to. Electricians are to 
effing expensive. And I could never find a ready-built computer that 
had the features I needed. But there are lots of other things that I 
have zero desire to know about and will learn only if I absolutely 
have to. At the same time, there are things that fascinate me 
(linguistics) and I will spend hours on even though I have no need 
whatsoever to do so. So you see, we're all different. And that's 
cool. Just please don't assume I am stupid or should not be using 
Linux because I criticize certain things about it. It's an OS, fer 
cripes sake, not a religion.

John,

If you can install something because you do not understand it do this:
1. GOOGLE it
2. check out the ubuntu guide at http://ubuntuguide.org

Obviously, if you do so well in school then you should have the skills 
to find the answers online. The first time that I installed a linux 
version on my laptop, I had many issues to resolve. It is good to have 
some issues so that you can become familiar to the Linux works. Think 
like Linux. I realize that you do not wish to learn how to run it, but 
why are you using it if you do not desire to learn it? Doesn't make much 
sense to me. Ok, so don't LEARN how to fix the issues, but do you think 
that you can type in the command and press enter? 1. realize the issue. 
2. phrase the issue 3. find the solution online 4. follow directions 
Really, that is all you need to do. You do not even need to understand 
what the commands do, like Nike says 'Just Do It."

Forgot to mention this. Arkeia has a free Smart Backup client for Linux,
http://www.arkeia.com/asb/nocost/ 
There is a 50-gigabyte limit. If you can deal with entrusting your data to 
someone else, it's a pretty nice deal.

Perhaps then that is precisely the backup method you need. Quite
inelegant, but reasonably effective for backing up a small number of
files.

That sounds suspiciously like you've done just as much work to learn
BackUpMyPC as is required to conquer dump. The above only works as long
as your backup media is larger than your source. Notice how often this
assumption fails. So the complexity is necessary.

All have complexity roughly equal to that of dump. In fact given that
dump has perhaps 20 options (and 0-9 are consistant and exclusive), while
the above have 50+ I'd be tempted to conclude they're worse. Even worse
it is non-obvious which set you need for backups. With dump, you'll
easily get a complete/incremental backup or really obvious failure. The
above are surprisingly easy to accidentally get a partial backup.

Indeed. This is part of what I was meaning to suggest in mentioning it
isn't a completely trivial task.

Time for more coffee- it's their standard backup software, using your own

I took part in a survey a while back.
The results have just been released and some of you may find them 
useful - especially if you are trying to sell your management on
a Linux solution.
Links to the papers are in the discussion below.

Hi David,

 

You might remember in November last year, I asked for assistance from
you and members of the Portland Linux/Unix Group (PLUG) for our research
on the cost and effort involved in managing Linux server environments.
Your members' responses to our web survey were added to a wide-ranging
random telephone survey and in-depth interviews to get a vendor-neutral
look at Linux system management. 

 

Well, the study is complete now, and I promised to send it to you when
it was done. You can get the executive summary from OSDL's web site at
http://osdl.org/newsroom/studies/EMA, and the full PDF is available at
the web site of the main sponsor (Levanta) at
http://www.levanta.com/linuxstudy/. Please feel free to pass these links
along to your members, at your discretion. Both the summary and the full
report are available free of charge.

 

I want to thank you again for your help with collecting primary data for
this study. Due to the anonymous nature of the web survey, I cannot be
sure that your members contributed, but I am sure they will be
interested to see the results anyway.

 

If you have any questions or comment, please feel free to contact me.

 

Regards,

I have been looking for a better backup solution than 
tar/dump/cpio/whathaveyou so I downloaded the software and lit it up.  
Seems not too bad so far.  The GUI is almost intuitive and the software 
seems to work as advertised.  Management of Linux clients is 
straightforward - I haven't tried it on a WinDoze system yet.  I have a 
fairly large web site and 10 or so user directorys.  It will be 
interesting to see if I gain much in the way of compression/time/etc.

The license is free as long as you don't try to backup more than 50GB.

   Wow! I didn't know they were still in business. About 9 years ago they and
another commercial X server vendor advertised regularly in Linux Journal.

   But, to answer your question, I suppose it all depends on what you're doing
graphically.

Wow.  I have not heard anything about them in YEARS.

The ATI 9200 should be supported by ATI's closed source driver.  

Xi was useful back when most vendors had no clue as to what Linux was.  A 
lot has changed since then.  (Including X performance.)

I don't know what you would gain over using ATI's proprietary driver.  I 
don't think Xi ships with source.

Is there a wireless interface that is being assigned as eth1?
Yes, that is odd.

That's odd.  You're right the kernel should configure it as eth1.  If you do an ifconfig is there an eth1? Has there ever been?

I'm wondering if lspci might have some more info for you there (like 
eth0 is actually a crippled dual card or similar nonsense.)

But this also reminds me of the "all my cards are eth0" thing which I 
read over a year ago.  Can't find the exact reference now (thought it 
had something to do with udev, but might have been an ifup/guessnet 
related thing.)

  http://www.xenotime.net/linux/doc/network-interface-names.txt

nameif is interesting, but with 2.6.12, udev "should" be stable

  http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html

No, it won't answer why eth2 and not eth1, but I'm hoping we'll 
eventually get to the point where udev "just works" and we can forget 
about eth0, eth1, sda, sdb, etc altogether.

A lot of distros tie a particular combination of PCI ID and MAC
address (or sometimes just MAC address) to a name to keep you from
getting screwed up if you install a new kernel or driver that
discovers the devices in a different way.  If the box used to have
three adapters, and then one was removed (eth1) then it probably
didn't reorder them.

Check your init scripts and see if the MAC is being tied to a particular name.

My system gives eth1 to a firewire port.  I'd recommend inspecting
your bootup messages for a clue as to what gets eth1 and why.

You may want to check out /etc/modules.conf most distro's will link a
particular NIC module to an interface.

You can force an interface to a particular name with the ifrename utility
(part of the wireless-tools package on redhat/fedora distros). It stores
the naming rules in file /etc/iftab. Maybe you already have an /etc/iftab
that is making the eth0/eth2 assignments.

The relevant man pages are ifrename(8) and iftab(5).

privoxy is a nice filtering proxy.  You run it as a daemon and just set 
the port number in your browser's config.  If you're talking 
workstations and not portables, you can set it as the proxy for all of 
your boxen.  It does a nice job blocking most ad sites with the default 
configs and has white/black lists if you want to expand the rules.

Message-ID: <ca5165530602150925n4d0770f3u8820cf3f8e3f75f9@mail.gmail.com>

I have a problem that I have spent at least two days searching on google and
not found a solution.

Problem background.

I want to have a process wake up every x time period and send a network packet.
Doing this is not hard but what seems hard to me is that I need this x
period to be
close to the same every time.  Minor variations are allowed and can be
compensated
in the program.  Basically keep a constant packet rate, whatever rate
is required

When using select or nanosleep (stock kernel 2.6.15-1.1830_FC4smp), I get wild
variations of output.  Example: request sleep for 2.4 msec. get
7.9msec.;  then have
to send three packets to make up for the time the process did not send
because it
was sleeping.

The original program that I was using is iperf but when I want to use
two different rates
using two copies of the program running at the same time they conflict
as the program
is using a spin loop to get the timing correct.  I replace this spin
loop with nanosleep
and the program output is no longer constant.

The really strange thing is when I increase the packet rate (decrease
the sleep period)
the programs using nanosleep or select don't get as much error ( 1
msec. request get
980 usec. to 1020 usec.).

The programs use posix threads (which is NPTL) and don't do any
special calls for
scheduling or priority settings.

Any help?

Eric,

   Ah, yes. I do have privoxy installed on my main workstation/server, but she
works on a ThinkPad connected wirelessly from the den.

Thanks,

I don't have experience with the Xi Graphics software,
but I have a Radeon 9200 which while maybe not
being fully supported does have DRI support
using xorg and has good fullscreen support with mplayer.
Am I missing out on something by not using the binary
drivers?

Editing iftab does the job. It had eth0 already mapped to the MAC of the 
onboard ethernet, so I'm guessing it picked it up during Kubuntu 
installation, since the second NIC was added later, but was not present in 
iftab. 

Interestingly, man iftab says "It is discouraged to try to map interfaces to 
default interfaces names such as eth0, wlan0  or ppp0.   The  kernel use 
those as the default name for any new interface, therefore most likely an 
interface will already use this name and prevent ifrename  to  use  it."

I have always used the interface configuration files to map interface names to 
devices, like this:

Debian, /etc/network/interfaces 

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# Map LAN and WAN NICs to MAC addresses
auto eth0 eth1
mapping eth0 eth1
     script /etc/network/get-mac-address.sh
     map 11:22:33:44:55:66 lan
     map AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF wan

iface lan inet static
     address 192.168.1.1
     netmask 255.255.255.0
     broadcast 192.168.1.255

iface wan inet dhcp

The get-mac-address.sh script is part of ifupdown on Debian.

Red Hat, /etc/sysconfig/networking/devices/ifcg-eth*

#ifcg-eth0, LAN
DEVICE=eth0
HWADDR=11:22:33:44:55:66
BOOTPROTO=none
ONBOOT=yes
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
IPADDR=192.168.1.1
USERCTL=no

#ifcg-eth1, WAN
DEVICE=eth1
HWADDR=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
BOOTPROTO=dhcp

The HWADDR and DEVICE directives taken together bind the device name to the 
MAC. I haven't tried Red Hat yet, but on Debian eth1 never came up, so the 
config file didn't work. I'm guessing that ifrename kicks in earlier in the 
boot process.

This is what dmesg shows without using iftab:

$ dmesg|grep eth
[4294676.545000] eth0: ADMtek Comet rev 17 at 0001d400, 00:04:5A:55:5C:9D, IRQ 
19.
[4294677.312000] eth1: VIA Rhine II at 0x1bc00, 00:0b:6a:ef:7e:8d, IRQ 23.

[4294724.158000] eth0: no IPv6 routers present
[4294724.537000] eth2: no IPv6 routers present

This is how it looks using iftab:

$ dmesg|grep eth
[4294676.545000] eth0: ADMtek Comet rev 17 at 0001d400, 00:04:5A:55:5C:9D, IRQ

[4294724.158000] eth1: no IPv6 routers present
[4294724.537000] eth0: no IPv6 routers present

Russell asked about weird shared chipsets, which is always a good question for 
onboard controllers, but as near as I can tell it's not a shared chip. The 
second one is the onboard controller:

0000:00:0b.0 Ethernet controller: Linksys NC100 Network Everywhere Fast 
Ethernet 10/100 (rev 11)
        Subsystem: Linksys: Unknown device 0574
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 19
        I/O ports at d400 [size=256]
        Memory at defebc00 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=1K]
        Expansion ROM at fffe0000 [disabled] [size=128K]
        Capabilities: [c0] Power Management version 2

0000:00:12.0 Ethernet controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT6102 [Rhine-II] 
(rev 78)
        Subsystem: Unknown device 1849:3065
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 23
        I/O ports at bc00 [size=256]
        Memory at defeb900 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=256]
        Capabilities: [40] Power Management version 2

So, unless there is yet another config file that I missed (nothing 
in /etc/init.d/networking, or /etc/network/*, or /etc/modutils/*), I'm going 
to blame it either on the onboard drivers, or PCI bus weirdness. I haven't 
tried moving the second NIC to a different slot, but I just might.

thanks everyone for helping.

Try:
  pthread_attr_init()
  pthread_attr_setschedpolicy() with a policy of SCHED_RR.
  pthread_create() using the attribute initialized above.

The process will have to be started as root for this to work,
but after the new thread is running you may setuid() to a
not-root user and retain the SCHED_RR policy.

Man pages: pthread_attr_init(3), pthread_create(3), and setuid(2).

Interesting.  It is Novell centered, and seems to offer no advantage
over something like Novell certification.

Probably can be prevented by adjusting the security settings in firefox, 
though I'm curious about why the default settings allowed such a thing.  
Is this a win-d'ohs box?  IE in use?  (/me imagines an IE exploit 
twiddling firefox configs!)

Tried SCHED_RR and SCHED_FIFO. No help.
Is there a default process time slice (tick) that can be adjusted down?

Would a low latency/preemptive kernel make a difference?

Wow.  Firefox allows homepage switching on a Linux box.  Scary.

I'm sure the list and firefox devs would be interested in knowing about 
this vulnerability assuming that you can identify the source and that 
it wasn't a result of applying overly permissive settings.

   Well, ... I don't know what happened. I suspect it was user error but she's
never remember just what she did. She also makes the current page her
homepage so she can find it again. I've mentioned that's the function of
bookmarks but .... Shrug.

   This is the first and only time it's happed in the 7+ years she's been
using mozilla/firefox so I suspect that it's a transient anomaly. If it ever
occurs again I'll ask her to try to write down just what she was doing at the
time.

Preemptive/low-latency kernel might help. Might be overkill for your
purposes, but you might look at the real-time stuff; since that really
sounds like what you want done.

If your process has CAP_SYS_NICE, you might try bumping the priority of
your process. The Linux-specific varient of this is you could bump the
priority after starting threads, and thereby give only the one thread
higher priority. The generic way would be to do that prior to starting
threads.

Perhaps HZ is set too low on your system?  There was a fairly recent
change to allow HZ to be configurable (2.6.15? 14?  don't
remember...), so perhaps you need to set it back to 1000.

Hmm. What kernel version is this?

For regular (SCHED_OTHER) processes the time slice is directly
related to the nice level. Nicer processes get shorter time slices
before they must surrender the CPU to other processes. No
SCHED_OTHER process may be preempted by another SCHED_OTHER process.
However a SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO process will preempt SCHED_OTHER
process before their time slice is done. So a SCHED_RR process
should wake up from a sleep with fairly good accuracy.

I don't know of any way to change the default time slice (or the
default nice level) without modifying the kernel. Be warned that
tweaking the scheduler leads to unintended consequences more often
than not. See MAX_TIMESLICE and MIN_TIMESLICE in sched.c. The default
nice level is zero. I don't think there's a macro for it.

A preemptive kernel might help. Without a preemptive kernel a
SCHED_RR process can't preempt a SCHED_OTHER process while the
SCHED_OTHER process is executing in kernel space. It must wait
until it returns to user space. With a preemptive kernel the
SCHED_RR process would be able to preempt the SCHED_OTHER process
while it was still in kernel space.

Can you change that value on the kernel without a re-compile?

No, it is a .config option.  If you have the .config for your current
kernel you can just search for CONFIG_HZ to see what it is set to.

I did find the HZ value in the .config file.  It is set to 250.  This
explains why I am jumping
between ~8ms and almost none.  It is the interaction of the program
with nanosleep.
nanosleep with values >1ms (or is that 2) will not return for at least
the default time slice
if they are running sched_other which is the default scheduler.
(Please correct me if
I am wrong).

Using select() with no file descriptor and a timeout value returns 1ms
too soon or 1ms too
late.  So select timeout seems to have a different timing method.

It still does not explain why when I changed to SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO I didn't
get better results. Maybe nanosleep does not change it's behavior when
the scheduler
is changed.

Does anyone know if the posix high resolution timers have been added
to the kernel and
which version?  I would be happy just to get down to < 10 microsecond
process wakeup
accuracy.

Subject: [PLUG] AT followup - found my problem
Message-ID: <20060216133035.GA15701@patch.com>

You may recall (didn't you have enough beer?) that my little sample
programs worked, but the big and real one didn't.

I found the cause.

In the documentation there's a section called cleanup.

       _Cleanup_
       $success = $table->commit()
           This attempts to commit all changes made to the IP chains in
           the table that $table points to, and closes the connection
           to the kernel-level netfilter subsystem.

I'd initially blown by that thinking "I don't want to close the
connection, I want to keep it open and keep making changes."

But this morning around 4:30 (four beers don't keep me from an early
start when I've got a problem to solve) while poking at the problem and
viewing strace output and reading my more verbose than ever debug logs
a thought (yeah, it does happen occasionally) occured to me:

   What is the little test programs have commit called automagically
   during shut down?

That's easy to test, add a "getc;" after the $fw->insert_entry() and
check the system status.

And yep, the change wasn't applied until the mini program exited.

So the module code is set up to:

  init
  do operations
  commit (and commit closes your connection)

My original model treated the FW connection like a pipe that I'd
read from and write to.  When I did something like FW->append_entry()
and receive a true response I assumed the rule was applied, not queued
up to be applied.

It's all so clear now...

Time to rework the code with this in mind.

Subject: [PLUG] hash verses pile of scalars
Message-ID: <43F4B353.4020204@acm.org>

What are the down side issues with using a hash to hold configuration 
values over using a pile of scalars?

I am working at a redesign/enhancement of a web application ( that 
currently does not use mod_perl ) and need to know if there are 
processing speed/memory issues with using a hash to hold the values.
Both with and without mod_perl involved would be nice.

I have traditional used the hash because it makes suing TT 
easier/simpler but the app I'm reworking uses scalars.

The original developer , from three years ago , is no longer around but 
he did some pretty nifty stuff code-wise so I figured he had a reason 
for using scalars instead of a hash.


Thanks,
Rod

I'd use a hash so that it'd be easier to pass the whole configuration 
set to a subroutine or a foreign module. It's also convenient if you 
want to read and/or dump your configuration using a CPAN module like 
Data::Dumper or XML::Dumper.

Message-ID: <1140113984.3786.277.camel@localhost.localdomain>

A meeting was held last Sunday.  We gathered commitments from people to
run the Clinic at Free Geek, discussed the facilities, and formed a
proposal that was taken to the Free Geek Council Meeting last night. 
The Free Geek Council approved the proposal unanimously.

Since time is short, and I have not seen a notice posted about the Linux
Clinic, I will post it now.  Hopefully someone will take over future
notices.

The first Linux Clinic at Free Geek will be held this weekend :  Sunday,
February 19, from 1 to 5 pm.  Free Geek is located at 1731 SE 10th in
Portland (third block south of Hawthorne on 10th).  The Clinic is open
to all, and we hope lots of folks who have knowledge to share will come
and assist us.

This was my thoughts also but based on the other work he did ( and I 
don't even know his name ) I was thinking there was a reason.  As Andy 
Lester said 'premature optimization'.

The whole point is if one power supply fails (losing power should 
constitute a failure) then the other takes over.  If the machine turns 
off what was the point of the option?

It's a good idea to test this sort of functionality out before you 
depend on the machine.  Knowing what the machine will do when it's happy 
is good and all, but knowing what the machine will do when you start 
throwing sticks at it is equally important. ;)

   No.

   Are the power supplies redundant? That is, if one fails does the other
automatically kick in and carry the whole load? If so, there's no difference
between a failed power supply and unplugging it to insert into a different
UPS. OTOH, if both are needed to keep the server up and running, then ...
you'll probably end up rebooting.

   No?

Good :)

One point of clarification: most servers will use BOTH power supplies at 
ones, in theory reducing the load and making each last longer. Only 
really old braindead systems use the 2nd power supply for "failover."

Rod,

   Well, gee whiz! You gotta' be more careful when you pull out plugs so you
don't hurt the poor thing and cause it to cry out in pain.

Charlie,

   I see ads in Linux Journal for rack mount servers with hot-swap power
supplies. How do these fit into your scenario above? Are they sold only to
braindead customers?

My experience has been...

You get a light..or email notification.. Telling you that you are now on
one power supply..

Change out the dead PS and the light goes out... or What ever...

Subject: [PLUG] I need a router...
Message-ID: <43F525F1.10405@axpr.net>

I need to retire my old server that lives in the closet.

I need to replace it with something that will be advanced enough for me
while I am still living here.  I need to replace it with something that
will last forever for when I have moved elsewhere.

I need something reasonably reliable.  These crappy wireless access
points aren't doing the trick.  I have two.  They both require reboots.
 One after doing a few GB of data over UDP.  The other about once a
month.  And that's just with them acting as bridges!  I haven't used
them as routers yet.

So I'm leaning towards something OpenWRT-able.  I need it to be able to
run a reasonably powerful DHCP daemon and a caching DNS server.  This
leaves me looking at one of the OpenWRT-able router/wifi boxen with 8MB
of Flash and 32MB of RAM - like the Linksys WRT54GS 3.0 or earlier.
Unfortunately, they don't make those any more and I don't need the Wifi
half of it.

Have y'all tackled simple linux-based routers (that don't eat up so much
power as a full-blown box) much lately?

Any pointers would be appreciated... and a used WRT54GS 3.0 would be
even better.  :-)

Glad to see it worked the Right Way.  Dual power cables means you can
"walk" the server to other power sources.  I've done it a few times.
Beware, though; some power supplies won't turn themselves back on
automatically when the power cord is plugged back in.

Cisco Makes Linksys. I've actually talked to a couple of Cisco engineers 
that said the Linksys WRT54G was their favorite product... I'm not 
surprised, I love mine.

Are you sure about that? The WRT54G version 5 hardware runs VxWorks and
is not OpenWRT capable, but they still make the WRT54G v4 hardware; of
note the WRT54GL is simply the v4 hardware with a new moniker (and the
old price, while the v5 G is cheaper). Linksys's web page lists them all,
not mentioning anything about discontinuing them.

ENU's web page lists them as having both WRT54G and WRT54GS hardware as
in stock at both stores. There are quite a few other devices as well that
OpenWRT can handle, http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware

Unfortunately, WRT54G is ambiguous.  They've changed rather drastically
between revisions (mostly this 5.0 crap).  Which revision do you have?

You're misreading what he said. He was pointing out that most systems,
when both power supplies are operational will use *both* at somewhere
below 50% capacity; rather than one at 100% and one at 0%. The point
being that utilizing both at roughly 50% more than doubles their
lifespan. Note it is possible to load a system so heavily that you're
using more than 50% and you're no longer redundant. There is also the
situation of two smaller power supplies are cheaper than one larger power
supply.

A more common situation is that of having 3 power supplies and needing 2
of them operational to run, so one can fail, but two failing will put you
offline. Might of seemed thoughful, but actually a problem when they set
it up so all three share a powercord.

They are supposed to be making a version specifically to keep running
Linux, instead of the VxWorks version.  I think it costs more, but you
should be able to buy a new one.  Just not at Circuit City or Best
Buy.

Ah, I ass-u-me'd you couldn't get any v5 hardware.  I've emailed ENU to
see what revisions it is they have in stock.

Consider a soekris board:

Not as inexpensive as a wifi router, but probably more robust.

Ah, I wish I could afford one!  That's very close to an ideal setup
(although I'm not a fan of the "traditional bios" stuff) except for the
high cost - I'd be looking at $177 plus shipping and the cost of a
compact flash card.

The only possibility I'm aware of that might be less than $177 (and not by much) is a GumStix micro ARM-based computer with the dual LAN adapter. (http://www.gumstix.com)

I don't know about all the hardware out there, but I think in general what you're asking for (custom, non-x86 hardware to do routing) is hard to obtain for < $150-ish.

I've been using old Pentium-233 MMX machines running Gentoo for a few years now, I have dozens of them all over the area at friends' houses, my mothers' house, etc. We have OpenVPN tunnels creating a large virtual LAN that allows for gaming in LAN mode over WAN.

Occasionally they fail, but it seems to be the old hard drives that go. For about $20-$30 I've acquired compactflash to IDE adapters, which would eliminate the mechanical components and probably extend the life of the system.

From my quick-and-dirty analysis, most of these systems are pulling 10 watts or less, which is a bit more than a Linksys but still very low for a "general purpose computer".

I think Charlie's thought is "use both, not need both."  So you can 
power down, or pull the plug, on one and the other will keep the system 
working.

   I know there are other pine nuts here, so this may be of interest to you,
too. Then again, you may already know how to add custom addressbooks to pine,
but I discovered how only today. It's simple -- but boring.

   Create a dot-file with the name of the addressbook you want. Enter data
separated by [Tab]s: nickname, full name, address, fcc, and comment.

   In Setup->Addressbooks, you can add either local or remote global addressbooks.

The dual-LAN adapter itself is $94, plus $99 for a basic Gumstix... but
geeze that would be cool!  It would just look like some sort of adapter
between the DSL modem and the switch.

Well, a Linksys WRT54G[S] that supports OpenWRT with a reasonable amount
of flash should do the trick.  I was hoping there would be something out
there that was *like* one of those WRT54's except without the Wifi part
of the equation, with still enough power to run OpenWRT or similar.
Unfortunately, it seems no work has been done on porting Linux to
old-fashioned routers such as that.  Oh well.  :-)

My googling turned up nothing.  And my posts here seem to be showing
either I should go with some pre-latest-revision Linksys hardware or a
more expensive solution (like the routerboard, soekris setup, or gumstix
- any of those solutions running me close to $200).

So now I shall work a bit harder on tracking down a Linksys WRT54GS
3.0... the one that has the most flash and RAM available!

Ten watts from a Pentium 233MMX?  I would think you'd be losing more
than ten watts just to heat dissipation in the power supply!  How was
your quick-and-dirty analysis performed, if you don't mind my asking?  :-)

Thanks.

[mailto:plug-bounces at lists.pdxlinux.org] On Behalf Of Elliott Mitchell

You're misreading what he said. He was pointing out that most systems,
when both power supplies are operational will use *both* at somewhere
below 50% capacity; rather than one at 100% and one at 0%. The point
being that utilizing both at roughly 50% more than doubles their
lifespan. Note it is possible to load a system so heavily that you're
using more than 50% and you're no longer redundant. There is also the
situation of two smaller power supplies are cheaper than one larger power
supply.

Being over-configured can be a problem.  I use a little gizmo called
"Watts-Up" to measure the power draw of a system whenever I change its
hardware config.  It's also useful for checking the power draw through a
UPS.

Elliott's clarification was spot-on. I think I was trying to make the 
point that "hot-swap" doesn't imply anything about the failover 
capabilities or "how it uses both."

Indeed - I had hoped to save a few bucks finding a box that didn't
*have* the Wifi part.  Why pay for parts you aren't going to use?

I'll take what I can get, however!

Because you're talking about pennies.  The WRT54G is so cheap now, and 
the value added of OpenWRT firmware should end the discussion.  The 
popularity of that device speaks for itself.  Aside from that, you have 
the expandability of wireless should you wish to start using it in the 
future.  Why not just set up the wireless securely so it's there if you 
ever need it anyway?

There are 27 brands listed on the OpenWRT firmware page of supported 
hardware.  So if Linksys isn't what you want it shouldn't be hard to 
find something else.

WRT's - good units.  Shit power supplies. 

1) Find a Thinkpad barrel-connector AC adapter.  It makes a regulated
and ripple-free 16V, but the 12V WRT units can work with up to 20V (the
wall warts produce a time-varying 9V to 18V).  I suspect some of the
reboots will go away with more reliable power.  If you are using a
different router, find a different laptop AC adapter with the right
voltage, and build a cable to adapt the plugs.  Note that most wall
warts are pretty awful - they have high internal resistance so they
can have their outputs shorted without catching fire, but this makes
them inefficient, and unreliable when the line voltage sags.

2) Alternately - cheap old used laptop.  The advantage here is that the
unit is easy to program, and comes with built-in battery backup.  There
might be somebody on the list with a laptop with a smashed screen; 
that would be even better, no display power (set up with an external
monitor) and less of a theft target.

I use option 2.  During the power outages in last week's wind storms,
I stayed connected by powering my cable modem with my Ncharge battery,
the laptop router/firewall running on its own batteries, and a crossover
ethernet cable from the laptop firewall to my user laptop.

The Netgear WGT634U has its wifi radio on a miniPCI card, which you
could remove. ;-) Sadly, the low-cost (~$40) refurbs are presently
out-of-stock.  OpenWRT is still a Work In Progress, but you could
probably make it work from current SVN.  Also, there is an older
OpenWGT that does work with moderate tweeking.

That sounds like two different boxes.  For the first, a StoreBox from
Free Geek running IPCop might do 'er for ya.  For the second, a simple
NAT router (The FG store had a couple Linksys boxes last I saw) might
cover it.  People understand "if the net don't work, reset the router."

. The Freegeek Storebox sells for $50 at the thrift store.
. Get a 50% discount off "everything" by volunteering 4 hours quarterly.
. The specs for the Storebox are near the "bottom" of this link:

Well, it was one box.  :-)

Router/firewall and a server.  Hey, for home, I'm okay with the idea of
running services on my firewall.  Call me crazy....

I actually already have two other servers set up to handle things I need
handled - a 16MB UML in California and a dual P3 server sitting in a
rack in Atlanta.

I just need a new router here at home.  :-)

With a $20 DMM in series on the AC input. Approximate amperage * average voltage = rough Watts.

The reason I say quick and dirty is because these DMMs (*coughradiocoughshack*) are well-known for an accuracy of about 40%.

But I'm using mostly old Intel mini-boxen. These things have integrated 55W PSUs and hold one HDD, no floppy or CD drive. They are either decently efficient PSUs or that 40% is in the negative direction.

Even assuming a horribly inefficient modern ATX FF PSU, with an old socket 7 and board, one HDD and two NICs, you shouldn't be looking at more than 20 watts. Especially since CPU usage is near 0 persistently.

Message-ID: <43F66E3B.3070601@alcpress.com>

It seems like the iPod is a pain in the butt. It doesn't
work easily with Linux. I have a Mac iBook but its copy
of OS X is too old to run the Apple software. I'll have
to buy the OS X upgrade at $125 if I want to use it.
I normally don't have a Windows machine running.

Are the other iPod-like devices that I see advertised less
troublesome?
I'd like to just plug a player into a USB port on my
Linux computer and copy music files to it.

Does anyone here have experience with non-iPods?

I have a 'Rave MP' thing with 2.5G and a reasonable UI. It looks to a
computer like a USB storage device, and I mount it as a FAT filesystem
and copy files.

I got it for $50 when the new CompUSA opened on 82nd. They're usually
$130, and it's not worth that much to me; I'm not big on isolating from
my surroundings. I use it to listen to lectures and interviews while I'm
working out, and that's about it. 

I've heard that there are many such devices, but I don't care enough
about them to know any more than I do. #:)

I use my iPod with Linux exclusively and there's no pain in my butt.

Well, there's other ways to get a new copy of OSX...

But, yeah, iPod and Linux play just fine together... especially if you 
only want to use it with Linux (except in disk mode, which works fine 
everywhere with no trouble).  The only real trouble is if you want to use 
your iPod with iTunes AND gtkpod.  But from what I understand, even using 
an iPod on more than one computer or more than one iPod on single machine 
is kind of a hassle... I'm not sure.

> Are the other iPod-like devices that I see advertised less troublesome?

I hear wonderful things about the iRiver.  But, again, I think the iPod is 
the best thing out there.  The interface really is a thousand times better 
than any of the other devices... and usability is a very big deal for a 
portable device that you could potentially use most of every day.

> I'd like to just plug a player into a USB port on my Linux computer and

Ah, yes, the devices that just read directories of MP3s are pretty cool, 
but the database on the iPod can do some pretty cool things that a 
copy-and-play device probably wouldn't do.  (As I would imagine one that 
just reads directory structures wouldn't have the horsepower to scan 
itself completely and compile a database of all the information in the ID3 
tags.)

> Does anyone here have experience with non-iPods?

Yeah, I know you didn't ask for my opinions on the iPod, but my experience 
with non-iPods hasn't been so great... at least not when compared to my 
iPod experiences.

What part do you fear with an iPod?

The Neuros Audio player is nice; bulkier than the iPod, but supports
Ogg Vorbis and has a relatively open firmware.

I use my iPod with Linux and it works well.  I even run iTunes under
CrossOver Office and then use gtkpod to sync the downloaded files via
a symlink to the iTunes download directory.

Subject: [PLUG] network routing
Message-ID: <1140225227.43f674cb07c1b@mail.fiddlers-green.info>

All,

I'm having an interesting problem with my ClarkConnect box. I've currently got a
post on their forums. However, I'm looking to fill in the gaps I have about how
a gateway routes traffic.

My CC box acted as the gateway/firewall/router for my network:

ISP
||
Wireless router/AP
||
CC box
||
hub
||
clients

Now the routing table on my clients looks like this:

 Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
192.168.81.0    *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 vmnet1
10.10.10.0      *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
172.16.106.0    *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 vmnet8
169.254.0.0     *               255.255.0.0     U     0      0        0 eth0
default         10.10.10.1      0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0

And on my CC box:

Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
192.168.1.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
10.10.10.0      *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth1
default         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0

What this all syas to me is that anoything sent from 10.10.10.140 to
66.102.7.104 (www.google.com) should be sent up to 10.10.10.1 (the CC box).
Then 10.10.10.1 should see that it the address doesn't fit either 192.168.1.0
or 10.10.10.0 and should send it up to 192.168.1.1 for further processing. Am I
correct in this?

What happens in practice is that my ping to 66.102.7.104 from 10.10.10.140
simply disappears somewhere (I'm assuming at the CC box). It's not just ping
though, anything sent just doesn't come back.

What's more interesting is that one of my wireless clients can ping
10.10.10.140, but 10.10.10.140 can not ping back. Am I missing or just don't
understand something about how gateways work?

thanks,
Dan H.

Sadly, no.  But cleaning and monitor testing count for double hours.
(And maybe recycling.  Destroy computers!  Woo!)

You left out one pertinent piece of information: how is the routing
configured on the wireless AP?  I don't know what a ClarkConnect box
is.  Noting which device(s) is(are) doing NAT would be useful as well.

In normal routing, the kernel picks the best fit route based on the
destination address and sends the packet in the indicated direction.
Of course, reply packets have to be routed back as well.  For example,
your wireless router _probably_ doesn't have a route for
10.10.10.0/24.  So it sends it off to the default route.  The other
way around, one of the boxes in between is probably NAT'ing
(translating the source address, outbound, to the external interfaces'
IP), so pinging from 10.10.10.0/24 to an IP on your wireless network
works (ping reply's can make it back).

Ed,

The sony mp3 player is recognized on windoze as a drive. It should show 
up on your linux box as a usb drive as well. (I know it will no an 
ubuntu & Debian box.) If you are considering upgrading to Tiger (OS 
10.4.x), I would totally recommend it. It is so much better than 
previous versions.

Forgive me, I changed majors before I had to take any EE classes while I
was an ME major.  :-)

I suppose this leaves me with a few questions:

1)  The cause of the instability in these things is power related - are
the wall warts only giving crappy power when the line voltage drops or
other such issues with the line?

2)  Will providing more conditioned power to the wall warts cause them
to be reliable enough for stable operation?

3)  Will my el-cheapo UPS provide conditioned-enough power to keep a
wall wart happy for longer?

4)  If not, is there anything I can purchase that *would* be enough to
keep Wally the Wart happy?

Thanks.  :-)

In the olden days, back at Riverdale, there were lots of monitors and
other peripheral hardware around that could be used.  I sort of assume
the Free Geek will have a similar pile to borrow from for testing, but
since it's a new environment for the Clinic, I am not sure.
Hopefully, one of the clued-in organizers can fill us in.

The safe bet would be to put it in the car and bring it along.  You
might not need to unload it, if things turn out right.  And, of
course, if it is relevant to what you are trying to get working, then
definitely bring it.

JK,

   Do you a proxy running? How about adblock? If you do have the latter
running, take a look at how ads are blocked; you may have specified the
entire domain rather than just the ads. I did this accidentally a few weeks
ago and cut off the heading on a site.

   In firefox-1.5.x, Tools->Adblock->Preferences (ctrl-shift-P) lets you
access the entire list of URLs. Highlight and edit or delete as you wish. I
suggest specifying sorting the list in alphabetical order; then you can
easily find Google and others if they're there.

   If not, I'll hand you off to a real expert with real answers.

Just a guess... Do you have congestion notification enabled? Check 
using sysctl:

   sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_ecn

If the result is non-zero, you might try modifying it:

   sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_ecn=0

I have to concur with other opinions expressed here that the iPod is 
a pain. I did get my 60GB photo iPod working finally with Linux. My 
initial problem was getting it formatted FAT32. I was trying to be a 
Linux purist and do it without using Windows. After a week of 
struggling with instructions I found on the web I finally broke down 
and installed iTunes on my Windows computer to do the job. 

But that was the only big hurdle. Once I did that I uninstalled 
iTunes (what an annoying piece of crap!) and found that gtkpod 
worked fine for editing tags and getting stuff on and off the iPod. 
And, with help from people in here, I finally figured out how to rip 
my CD collection to mp3s from the command line with cdparanoia 
and lame.

The only further problem I have had with it is when I inadvertently 
forgot to umount it before unplugging it one day. Totally hosed the 
database on the iPod. And the only solution is to reformat and start 
over, which requires iTunes. That was a major PITA to fix. I really 
wish someone would write a Linux database so we could just 
format it ext3 and go 100% Linux on it.

At the meeting when last Sunday there was some discussion of 
having a box where we could have "PLUG stuff" -- for things like a 
mouse, keyboard and other parts that someone might need. The 
point was that many times at a Clinic the user's problem turned out 
to be equipment failure instead of a problem with Linux. And even if 
the user's equipment is fine, sometimes you need to swap out 
something to rule out equipment failure. 

So maybe we should just buy a monitor from Free Geek and put it 
on the shelf next to the PLUG stuff box. That way we wouldn't have 
to worry about borrowing one from Free Geek. I would be willing to 
chip in a few bucks.

In the meantime, Bruce, I noted that there were a number of roll-
around carts at Free Geek. If you can get it into your car I'm sure 
we can get it inside.

I recently donated a bunch of good working monitors to FreeGeek so I can
only imagine they have stock to borrow against. It's never safe to assume,
so pack one in the trunk just in case.

   Anyone here using AXS on a remote web server? I thought that I had it
properly installed, but when I try to access the ax-admin.pl page all I see
is the source code.

   My ISP hosts my web site so I have only ftp access to it. The path is
../public_html/cgi/axs. I've written to tech support there (it was one of the
fine folks there who suggested axs to me), but if I can resolve it sooner,
it's one more thing off my plate.

   Also, if anyone has modified axs to mail the log results daily, please tell
me what to do.

Thanks,

I have the same problem with my system and Firefox 1.5.0.1.
I have the same modem running on Ubuntu.  The last time this happened, I

   Oh, never mind. I just learned that I need to specify /cgi-bin/ in the URL,
not /cgi/. Sigh.

I believe we can borrow monitors and such from the classroom computers, as
long as we're good about putting them back.  FG has *lots* of monitors.

Bring your mouse, at least.  There's so many different kinds.

Line voltage is pretty stable.  But you may be able to get better power
stability from one'a those newfangled switching wall-warts.  They often
look like skinnier versions of normal wall-warts, but they're *much*
lighter.  You may have one already.  If not, the Free Geek Store has 'em.

Wouldn't rely on it.  A good power supply should be stable anyway.

I had a similar issue happen to me with Firefox 1.07 on Ubuntu-64. 
I first noticed it while on Pub.Net at PSU. When I came home and 
connected with cable the problem resolved itself completely except 
for streaming radio stations, which still won't work. Dunno why they 
stopped working. I just copied all the bookmarks for them into 
RealPlayer and forgot about using the browser for them.

But considering that the problem resolved itself when I came home, 
I suspect there was some kind of DNS issue going on.

Anybody know how to modify a system so that it powers on without pushing 
the power button on the front panel?   In the "old days" the button was 
a switch but now it is not.   I want my UPS connected systems to come 
back up (unattended) when power comes back on.

That's going to be a BIOS setting now.  The motherboard controls when it
is turned on these days...

The WGT634U also has USB 2.0!  8MB flash, 32MB RAM, looks like it can be
had new for under $80 shipped (barely)... or refurb from a
less-than-reputable dealer for $40, shipped.

An eBayer just got back to me about a version WRT54GS 2.0 he has... if
his price isn't great, I'll definitely start looking at this WGT634U -
which looks like it should work fine with the latest-and-greatest (SVN)
OpenWrt.  It would provide expandability for the future (I'd like this
to be a VPN server as well, if reasonably possible).

Thanks for the pointer on this one!

Actually, no.  You don't need iTunes to do the formatting.  There's a 
simple "iPod Updater" utility from Apple that will install the latest 
firmware and format the iPod without iTunes.  Very simple.  It's a 
one-button GUI.

You CAN install Linux on your iPod... that seems like more of a pain than 
just using the thing as-is.  Furthermore, having a portable FAT32 drive is 
pretty handy as EVERY computer can mount it.

I've been snooping the BIOS but cannot locate the item.  Any idea what

But you *do* need Windows in order to set up your iPod to work in Linux?

If it's an older motherboard, the BIOS may not have an option to force a
power on after a power loss.

Assuming you have an ATX power supply, a single wire can be installed that
will force the supply on.  You need just a little experience with a soldering
iron.

http://www.hardwarebook.net/connector/power/atxpower.html

Pin 14 is the power supply output control.  Grounding this will turn on the
supply.  Pins 13 and 15 are grounds, so simply shorting between 14 and either
13 or 15 will force the supply on.  BTW, if you get this wrong, you could
fry your power supply, motherboard, and everything else that's connected,
so DON'T TRY IT UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.  Consider yourself
warned.

I've connected to a couple networks serviced by what I think is this 
DSL modem and in both cases the modem's DHCP issued me two DNS entries: 
the modem's IP (192.168.0.1, I think) and the IP of the ISP's main DNS 
server.

I had the same symptoms in Firefox, and I noticed that DNS queries to 
the modem's IP were all failing.  Removing 192.168.0.1 from 
/etc/resolv.conf made the problem go away.

Not sure why it issued that, or how Windows users on the networks were 
able to get reliable DNS service without tweaking anything.

I haven't tested this myself, but I've heard from others that Windows will fallback to either doing it's own resolution, or querying some hardcoded microsoft servers if the local DNS is failing. Seems unlikely to me, but I guess it's possible.

There are a couple things you may want to consider if you have unreliable DNS from lots of locations:

1) Set up a DNS server from your home network with a reasonably-static address. Then enter this address in /etc/resolv.conf and make sure your DHCP client doesn't overwrite that file.

2) Hardcode a public DNS server like Verizon's (4.2.2.1, 4.2.2.2, etc.) as the primary or fallback server in /etc/resolv.conf. Again, make sure your DHCP client either doesn't overwrite the file, or just appends the local network's servers to it. Verizon's servers are very fast, but if you can use the local ones you should, as per normal netiquette.

.. On rereading this thread, it appears you're only talking about your home system. The above recommendations were with a mobile laptop user in mind, and may still help someone else.

In your case, perhaps you should just hardcode some reliable DNS servers for your boxen and not use the DSL modem?

HTH,
Aaron

I found what I need in 3 out of four systems - wouldn't you know that 
the one I need most, the one running IPCop, doesn't have the option in 
the BIOS.  Not much value in the servers coming up if the firewall 
doesn't.  Rats.  Looks like I have to get out the 'ol soldering gizmo.

Sounds like rpm is complaining about the lack of an rpm package.  Either 
both rpm, or both cpan, or rpm and then cpan, but never cpan and then 
rpm.

Sounds like you're looking for the perl-Digest-HMAC_MD5 rpm.

QCad is about the best it gets for now.  Probably enough to do what you 
need.  You might also try pythoncad, which is a younger and has fewer 
features, but a less clicky-clicky-clicky interface.  You may also run 
across varkon and brlcad, but these are way more complicated, not too 
user-friendly, and not really well-suited for simple floor plans.

OpenOffice Draw, xfig, and inkscape are capable of this sort of thing, 
but you'll pull your hair out trying to draw anything dimensionally 
precise with them.

Unfortunately, CAD on Linux and in open source is rather barren and 
going to stay that way for a while given that most of the industry is 
rather comfortably in the pocket of autodesk and ms.  That, and all of 
the interested and able developers have to either design water 
reservoirs or write webapps to make a living.

On the commercial front, you can also run AutoCAD on Linux with wine (at 
least I've managed it with 2k and heard some reports about LT.)

Steer completely clear of LinuxCAD.

James,

   I think there's still a CAD for linux that's worth trying. I've not looked
in several years, but there is a site with scientific applications for linux.
Google will find it. That's a good place to start.

   I think that Varkon died several years ago. It was a drawing language, and
did a nice job, but did have a steep learning curve.

   If you want dimensional stability, draw using PSTricks. You can place

How is it that you compare running ACAD in wine with running it in 2K? 
That's not a comparison at all unless I am not picking up on what you're 
saying.  I would love to see ACAD in wine but AFAIK it's not possible. 
It's one of the only programs keeping me tied to Windows.

True, the updater utility will work. However, it wouldn't install on my 
Windows 2000 computer because it requires Service Pack 4. I've 
tried over and over to install SP4 on it, but it gets almost to the 
end, bombs, and rolls back to SP2. I've asked everywhere and no 
one knows why. "It's not supposed to happen" is the only answer I 
can get from Microsoft people. Yeah. Riiiight.

What I meant was not to install Linux on it, but a Linux clone of the 
Apple database thingy that will run on ext3. I want the same 
functionality; I just don't like having to deal with Apple and 
Windows.

I'm not sure whether they would always work with "good clean power",
but there is no such thing coming from real power wires.  The worst
things that sag power lines are induction motors, such as are found
in refrigerators and furnace blowers.  Move to a neighborhood without
motors and winds and you are fine ...

(we just had a 0.2 second or so power glitch that shut down some
equipment while writing this).

Beyond that, if the connections get resistive due to corrosion, the
edgy nature of the devices means that what is adequate voltage during
install may be inadequate during use.  In "mechanical engineer" terms,
it is like designing in a material with wide variance and a safety
factor of 1.5 .  When the same 10 cents can buy either more reliability,
or a million more transistors worth of function, what would you expect
a manufacturer to chose?

> 2)  Will providing more conditioned power to the wall warts cause them
> to be reliable enough for stable operation?

There are items called "constant voltage transformers" that will take
care of brownouts (voltage sags) but not short blackouts.  It is all
a matter of energy storage, and that is why the AC adapters for laptops
are superior.  These typically store about half a second of power for
a 50 watt laptop, which means about 4 seconds of power for a 6 watt WRT.

Measuring these glitches is difficult, so I am only doing some
educated speculation.  However, things like a WRT will typically
have some circuit that does "power on reset" and puts the unit into
a known state if the power to the unit ramps from zero to usable in
a fraction of a second - the sort of thing you get when you plug it
in or close a switch to it.  If the power dribbles up slowly, or if
if goes down to "not enough to function right" but not "low enough
to trip the power on reset", then you can end up with a circuit in
an indeterminate (and nonfunctional) state.

> 3)  Will my el-cheapo UPS provide conditioned-enough power to keep a
> wall wart happy for longer?

No.  Cheapo UPSes do something called "failover";  if the voltage
drops below a certain level they throw a big relay and turn on the
inverter from the batteries.  A short glitch or voltage sag in the
line passes right through.  Again, there is not enough "energy bucket"
in the WRT to ride through even a short glitch, and the power provided
by the wallwarts is only marginally adequate under good conditions.

> 4)  If not, is there anything I can purchase that *would* be enough to
> keep Wally the Wart happy?

You can purchase used AC adapters for Thinkpads off Ebay for like
$10.  If you scour the surplus stores (I saw something that would
work at Surplus Gizmos on Wednesday) you can probably get something
for $5.  I imagine Free Geek has a wad of unmated laptop AC adapters
that produce >10V (adequate for a WRT).

A non-cheapo continuous-regulation UPS would keep the P.O.S. wallwart
happy.  That would cost hundreds of dollars.  These always run the
input power through a battery charger, and back out an inverter, 
running continuously.  They are energy-inefficent, but very reliable.
You can tell you have one of these because it is always humming and
warm, and you shelled out a lot of money for it.

You need an energy bucket somewhere.  A laptop AC adapter is the
easiest form.  A 12V battery and a charger is another form (not a
car-connected battery - huge voltage spikes!).    Wiring a big
25V capacitor onto the wire from the transformer to the WRT would
be another form.  Or buying a more expensive router with a very
well designed power-on-reset circuit (that always engages when the
voltage is inadequate for function) would be yet another way to
accomplish the task.

As we move into winter, and the furnace blowers engage more often,
sagging the power in the building, we can expect more system
failures.  I like laptop AC adapters to deal with this, because
they are plentiful and cheap on the used market, and store enough
energy to survive a short sag.  I like laptops as routers because
I want my routes to survive 5 minute power outages.  I like UPSes
not so much, because you don't find out the batteries are dead
until the power goes out (unlike Martha Stewart, I don't test my
smoke alarms and UPSes monthly).

Powerwise, it is a jungle out there.  Looking at wall voltage with
an oscilloscope dispels any notion that you are buying a sine wave
from the power company - it looks more like a dog that lost a fight.
It costs money to design a power supply that can always work with
such crap coming in, and you will not find such power supplies in
inexpensive consumer-grade gear;  lamentably, you will not always
find good power supplies in very expensive stuff.  The worst power
supplies *catch fire* and *emit flames* when they are mistreated.

Second this!   I bought a copy and it was c**p.  Too long ago to list 
all that I found wrong but it _WAS NOT_ and AutoCAD work-alike.

There is also VariCAD (http://www.varicad.com/) but it is more 
mechanical oriented.  I bought a copy several years ago but then about 
10 minutes later the project I was going to us it on got pulled.  I 
still get upgrade motices.  Development is active on it.

Nope.

An iPod can be formatted either HFS or FAT32.  Both are useful under Linux 
if you have the appropriate kernel modules (for the partition scheme and 
filesystem driver).  If one finds FAT32 more useful and bought an HFS 
iPod, one has to reformat it.  You can do this on Linux OR on Windows. 
The Linux instructions were too hairy for John (I've never tried to follow 
them, myself), so he installed iTunes to do it.  He didn't have to go that 
far.

Uh, what would be the point of that?  And how does using FAT32 on your 
iPod mean dealing with Apple or Windows?

What you've got is a portable hard disk.  Seems like it makes most sense 
to have a filesystem on the thing that is universaly read/writable.  EXT3 
ain't.

No, it does not look like lynx or konqueror are part of a basic FC4 installation
however the "links" browser is installed. To use it, just open up a terminal
(under Applications->System Tools) and  type
links http://www.google.com
and see if that gets you to google.

I have purchased (or seen purchased) on the order of about 25 WGT's
from justdeals.com.  Of that, 5 of them had a readily apparent
problem.  I was able to get purchase price refunded on those without
too much hassle.  There are several PersonalTelco people using them as

However, justdeals is currently (as of a couple days ago) out of
stock.  Furthermore, these amazing devices are (apparently) no longer
being manufactured.  Netgear was hoping to sell them for $150 or so
with the ubercool usb (network storage) feature.  That turned out to
not being a terribly compelling feature in the mass market, and they
ended up selling for normal AP prices.  Long and short is that they
are edging towards scarce.  If you want one, grab one while you can.
CompUSA had them on the shelf a couple weeks ago for around $70-80.

Sorry, I'm not making myself clear. I have no real objection to 
FAT32, other than the fact that from what I read, ext3 is more 
robust. My main problem is with the Apple software. The iTunes 
database on the iPod is far from robust. Plus, it kind of sucks, from 
a user interface standpoint. Few options. You're stuck with what 
Apple thought you wanted. And if you want to interface with it 
without using iTunes you need an application that has essentially 
reverse-engineered the Apple software, e.g., gtkpod. Wouldn't life 
with an iPod on Linux be a lot easier if we just put an all-Linux 
database program on it, written from the ground up as a Linux app? 
And while we're at it, we could run it on a sturdy filesystem like 
ext3.

Maybe I'm just trying too hard to be a Linux purist. OK, I'm far from 
being a Linux purist. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't like to be.

JustDeals is, indeed, out of stock.  I wonder if they'll get any more in
or not... it seems the OpenWrt crowd has figured out just how cool these
things are and are snatching them up wherever possible.  CompUSA's price
is currently $89.99.  Ouch.  But that's only about ten bucks more than
what I'd end up paying for a WRT54GS and has the added benefit of USB.

There was some discussion in #openwrt about how they're vanishing...
*sigh* ... I wish there were a way to make an enthusiast router box that
was also affordable.

PC Engines makes some boards called WRAP that are a little cheaper
than the Soekris.  See:

Still over $100.  Maybe you just need to re-evaluate what you consider

Yeah, well, you can blame Microsoft for that.  When you format your 
portable hard disk, you go for universality.  And since Windows doesn't 
recognize much...

The firmware on the iPod or iTunes?

I've yet to see a music database that has the features I want.

What's the issue here?  I think the UI on the iPod is far superior to any 
of the other portable devices I've used.  The menus give you several ways 
of accessing the same items and there are several ways of playing them 
back.  I don't like that albums and playlists are treated the same (as in, 
if you want to randomize a playlist you have to set a global for 
randomizing album tracks), but that's my first substantial gripe with the 
thing.

> Few options. You're stuck with what Apple thought you wanted.

You're always stuck with what someone else thought you wanted unless you 
write your own application... and that just ain't practical (not to 
mention elitist).

> application that has essentially reverse-engineered the Apple software,

If you want a database, you have to use a specialized application that 
feeds the database entries to the device... or you have to read the 
metadata and compile the database ON the device.  The latter option 
requires way too much of a thing smaller than a deck of cards (consider 
the wear on that little, expensive disk every time you load something and 
it has to scan the filesystem for new files, extract the metadata, and add 
it to the database in addition to the load on a general purpose 
processor).  The former means doing it more or less the way Apple does it.

You can do that if you like.  There's a microLinux kernel that runs on the 
thing and all the utilities to do exactly what you describe.  There are 
trade-offs, of course.  You end up with what the developers of THAT system 
wanted (rather than Apple)... and I think the developers of that system 
probably had access to fewer usability studies, focus groups, and 
industrial designers.

There's no such thing as a one-size-fits-all solution, of course.  If you 
want a device that does exactly what you want and has a tiny form factor, 
it's going to have to NOT do most of the things you DON'T want... and 
you'll have to fabricate it yourself.

> And while we're at it, we could run it on a sturdy filesystem like ext3.

You don't get to plug it into other people's computers and use it like a 
portable hard disk, though.

> Maybe I'm just trying too hard to be a Linux purist. OK, I'm far from

I'm a Free Software purist.  I don't think much about my iPod because it's 
a piece of consumer electronics, not a general purpose computer.  I don't 
really worry too much about the firmware in my stereo or clock radio or 
microwave (OK, I don't have a clock radio or a microwave).  I can 
interface with it and my general purpose computers can interface with it 
using Free Software.

And while it doesn't do EVERYTHING I can imagine such a device doing, it 
does most of those things and it does them VERY well.

And the click-wheel is kind of the shit.  I can't imagine many other 
interfaces that I could operate THROUGH my jacket (as I do every day with 
my iPod) and not end up lost in some deep menu structure and have to pull 
it out and look at the screen to do what I want to do.

Ubuntu-64 Breezy, Gnome desktop, love it. But some time ago I banned Nautilus after it ate some files one day. Ever since I have been trying to find a file manager that suits me. For lack of anything better, I have been using Konqueror. In fact, my only problem with it is that it takes forever to launch. I suspect the problem is that it is also an internet browser and it's looking for a connection. I wish I could turn that off, but evidently that can't be done.

So last night I found XFE, and I love it. Fast, simple, does what I want and no more. However, I can't figure out how to get it to see my Windows 2000 desktop. In Konqueror I have this set up as a bookmark. If I click on the bookmark it pops up a dialog box asking for my password on the Windows 2000 computer, I enter it, and I'm in. I can drag and drop stuff back and forth. Cool. But I can't find where Konqueror is mounting the Windows computer. Or is "mounting" the right term? All I know is that in the Konqueror location bar it says "smb://jcj at devil4/" but when I copy and paste this into the location bar in XFE it goes nowhere. I think the problem is that in Konqueror it just starts with "smb ..." and in XFE I can't get rid of the initial folder -- I can get all the way down to root, but then there is still a "/" in the location bar, so it says "/smb://jcj at devil4/."

Surely there is a simple way to do this. XFE does allow me to create bookmarks. Maybe I need to create a mount point for the Windows share?

You might give Xffm, the Xfce file manager, a shot.  It does support SMB
browsing.

No, mounting isn't the right term.  How you're using it, SMB is
essentially just a file sharing protocol like FTP or SCP.  Yes, you can
simply mount it for easier access... but then the your samba client is
just hiding all that other stuff from you.

Konqueror is *not* mounting it for you.  It's browsing the share as
though you typed in \\devil4\ in Windows Explorer... or if it were FTP,
ftp://jcj at devil4/.  They wrote their own samba bindings to allow you to
easily browse samba shares without mounting them.

It appears from my brief google that XFM doesn't have such support.  If
you want to browse your Windows 2000 SMB shares, you'll need to mount
the share to a directory on your local machine.  Outside of XFM.

> Surely there is a simple way to do this. XFE does allow me to create

Yes, there is a simple way to do this:  Use a file manager that supports
all the features you need.  :-)

The latest Banshee ( 0.10.4 )supports iPods directly playing and copying
tracks to and from your iPod. 

It also has bindings to avahi for daapd sharing and libmusicbrainz for
metadata and album covers for your tracks. You can share your music
library to the network and also view and play from any daapd share on
the network. (iTunes music sharing is an example of daapd) You can also
burn audio cds directly from within Banshee.

Banshee is the sniz.. version 0.10.4 is in Ubuntu Dapper and works
GREAT. It has easily surpassed rythmbox in usefulness.

imho,

More likely, it's spawning a new kdeinit process each time you run it. Whether it's a bug or a feature is up to you, but KDE is tightly integrated in that all of it's components 'depend' on a sub-structure of programs, from kded and kdeinit to artsd if available.

I don't know how feasible it would be to rebuild konqueror in such a way that it could run standalone. (You can actually see a bunch of KDE processes running after you start konqueror if you run 'ps aux' or the like.)

The only reason konqueror should look for the 'net is if you have a homepage set. At least on my distro, the 'home page' is a "welcome to konqueror" which doesn't try to access the 'net at all.

Good point!

OK, went back to the Google page I found which listed all the Linux file managers and tried a couple more that I passed over the first time. I just installed Krusader and it appears to work just fine. Fast, simple, bookmarks, and sees the smb share just fine. Even knew I was already logged in and didn't ask for my password a second time. Also has a search capability built in, which Konqueror did not. I think I'll stick with it, at least until I find something I need that it won't do. :)

So I just downloaded this and it's... weird.

For instance, you can't sort by artist AND album.  If I sort by artist, 
the order in which tracks appear doesn't even depend on the album with 
which they're associated.  If I sort by album, the albums are listed and 
seem to be properly ordered by track number, but the albums are sorted 
alphabetically regardless of artist.

Furthermore, in the "encoding" section, there's a list of three encoding 
options (ogg, flac, and pcm).  I guess I can understand why they wouldn't 
want to link to an MP3 encoding library, but no line for an arbitrary 
external encoder?

As for linking to external databases, well, there's no means for directly 
accessing those queries that I can find.  Is none of it available until 
all of the queries are through?  (It's doing queries in the background and 
dumping info to stderr.)

And what's this with "ipod transcoding"?  The iPod will play MP3s 
directly.  Is it going to make AAC files from them and put them onto the 
iPod?  The compression won't be the same and my music probably won't fit 
anymore.

All in all, I think I'll be sticking with the annoying gtkpod.  Except for 
the daapd sharing, I don't see any advantages to using this software.

I would love to be given information to convince me otherwise.

Russell,

Thanks for the reply. ClarkConnect is just a linux based router distro.
(http://www.clarkconnect.com). It has some other neat features as well, but I
just use it for my router/gateway.

The Wireless AP is doing NAT, and the CC Box is also doing NAT. I added a route
along the lines of:

#route add net 10.10.10.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.104

to the AP's routing table and then this allowed to go back and forth between a
wireless client (in the 192.168* net) and a wired client (in the 10.10* net).

Originally, I had the CC box directly connected to the cable modem up until
Thursday morning when I inserted a third nic. I had planned to run the wireless
AP off this third NIC so I can have open wireless access, but then provied no
route between my wired and wirless nets. However, when I rebooted the CC box, I
could no longer get from any of my wired clients out to the internet. Due to my
need for internet access, I had to rollover to having the Wireless AP acts as
the router/gateway, and stick my CC box behind it. I'd like to go back the
other way.

The routing table on the CC box was (eth0 67.170.150.151, eth1 192.168.2.1):
192.168.2.0    *    255.255.255.0   U    0    0    0   eth1
67.170.150.0   *    255.255.255.0   U    0    0    0   eth0
default      67-170-150-1.hl    0.0.0.0  UG    0     0    0   eth0

and I don't see the difference between that and the way the routing table is
now:
192.168.1.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
10.10.10.0      *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth1
default         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0

Since I had to add the 10.10.10.0 route to the AP, does that mean CC wasn't
doing NAT? Could that be the problem? I'm assuming that CC is doing NAT, but
maybe it's not. Thanks for your help, I'll check into the firewall service on
the ClarkConnect box.

RPM and CPAN are separate and different.  Installing a module through
the cpan utility does not satisfy the RPM dependency.  RPM only looks
at the RPM database and RPM packages.  CPAN only manages Perl modules.
 It will detect modules installed through RPM.

Where did you get the perl-Net-DNS RPM?  If it came from one of the
standard repositories, you can use yum to install the package and all
of its dependencies.
On my machine, "yum install perl-Net-DNS" installs perl-Net-DNS and
perl-Digest-HMAC.

This is really all dependent on how reliable your metadata is in your
mp3's. All my tracks that I don't have consistent data on definitely
fall into what you're describing. However, if the files all have track
numbers, artist, album, and song names the sorting works really great
from what I can tell. You can however edit the metadata right withing
banshee and just start making your tracks behave better. The icon in the
bottom right corner will open a dialog to edit that data. I believe
right clicking on the object will as well. Any albums you rip yourself
will have the correct data retrieved via musicbrainz as long as you have
adequate access to their Internet database. I know I've been working on
cleaning up my tracks for a while now. Seems a never ending battle.
There is a setting in Banshee's plugin, Metadata Searcher, that trys
it's best at repairing the metadata as well.

Banshee uses the Gstreamer frame work. You'll need gstreamer0.8-lame for
mp3 encoding.

others that may also be helpful:
gstreamer0.8-plugins-multiverse
gstreamer0.8-mad
gstreamer0.8-flac
gstreamer0.8-vorbis
gstreamer0.8-theora

When you have the gstreamer-lame stuff installed you'll have a Lame Mp3
option for moving files to the iPod. You can have it transcode them to
aac on the way to the iPod if you want.. but you can definitely move
mp3's to it.

To each their own.. However, I've been enjoying the powerful all in one
wonderment that is banshee.. 

encode cd's to multiple formats
burn audio cd's
share your music to the network
listen to shared music on the network
listen to your local music library
listen to tracks off of your ipod
put tracks on your ipod
get cool album cover art
edit metadata and get updated info from the Internet
create playlists

That's a mighty spicy meatball!

I am using Kopete 0.10.4 under KDE 3.4.3, Jabber protocol.  Kubuntu 5.10 
distribution.

My display name in the chat window uses my JabberID (25 charaters long).  I 
would like to shorten that to a reasonable length.  When I attempt to Edit User 
Info... (menu from the task bar icon), I get dialog entitled Jabber 
vCard-Kopete.  If enter my JabberID entry and click the Save User Info, I get a 
message "Error Kopete Cannot enter vCard for ".  If I click on Save Nickname to 
Contact List, Kopete crashes.

I have tried to change kopeterc, but there seems to be no entry for display 
name, so I have no idea if it is even possible.

Is anybody out there who might be able to help?

Thanks,

Have you tried Psi (debian package: psi) instead?  That does what you want it 
to, and more.  Kopete is really lacking in the Jabber support department...

My metadata has been meticulously reviewed.  When I ripped my CD 
collection, I even babysat every single rip and made sure that the 
spellings, capitalization, and punctuation were correct for every track on 
every album.

But if I sort by album, for instance, all of the "Greatest Hits" albums 
are intermixed regardless of artist.  The tracks "1" are all clustered, 
followed by the tracks "2" and so on.

Again, not at all the problem I'm experiencing.

The issue here is that the sorting is munged.

When I sort by artist, the tracks within that artist are not strictly 
clustered by album (sometimes a track from another album will be stuck in 
the middle of another) and within each album, they are ordered 
alphabetically by title.  When I sort by album, the albums are sorted by 
name alphabetically regardless of artist, but the tracks are, in fact, in 
track number order.

I'll look into that.

I'll try to confirm that if I can see if there's something to be done

If I can resolve these few things, then perhaps I will start using it.

> edit metadata and get updated info from the Internet

If I'm ripping a CD, I use grip for these things.

For editting metadata, I find shell scripts to be much faster and less 
tedious.

This I also do from the command line for flexibility and decrease in 
tedium.

These are the things for which it might be good.

Here's a question:  If an initial lookup fails (I'm watching the stderr as 
it runs and seeing the lookups fail for some things -- timeouts or 
otherwise), is there a way to force a recheck of a particular album?  Is 
there a way to modify the search so that I can continue to use the name I 
use but get the metadata as it appears in musicbrainz?

> create playlists

I do this with shell scripts as well... or xmms.  This would replace the 
xmms uses.

I'm looking for a Linux distro to run an apache server on a low-power

I've tried pebble, but it's focussed on wifi access points.  It's
debian-based, so I'd expect to be able to just apt-get my way from an
install to exactly what I want, but no such luck.  Before I go trying
to figure out what's wrong, I'm hoping to find something closer to
what I need out of the box.

Thanks,

It was a great start of what I'm sure will become a huge benefit to 
Free Geek and the Linux community. I was pleased to discover 
that Linux-idiot-moi was actually able to do something positive to 
help repay the debt I owe the Clinic for all the help it has been to 
me in the past.

Some things not already mentioned that we need for our "PLUG 
box" at Free Geek:

A long-ass telephone cable so we can get a phone connection to 
the meeting room area. Or is there some kind of attachment so cell 
phones can be used for that? 

Some of those cool Ubuntu Live and Install CD packs. Can we 
order some from Ubuntu? And ditto for other popular distros.

Signs: I will take care of this. I have major DTP equipment, 
includng tabloid printers. I also have lots of scrap plywood left over 
from work on my house. It will cost me nothing.

And speaking of signs, how about some notices on the wall in the 
classroom at Free Geek so n00bs besides those on this list will 
hear of the Clinic? Also add to the PLUG web site. And can it be 
added to the Free Geek site as well? And can anyone think of 
other free ways to get the word out?

I think the "new" Clinic is going to be even better than the old one. 
Someone should communicate the success of our first Clinic to the 
Council. Communication is always key.

And special thanks to everyone who particpated, especially the 
n00bs who took a chance and showed up. You are, after all, the 
reason for the Clinic. I hope the experience was as positive for you 
as past Clinics have been for me.

Buildroot?  http://buildroot.uclibc.org/

I haven't successfully built an image with it yet, but the OpenWRT and
other embedded folks use it extensively.

LimeyLinux is a good example of what BuildRoot can do on x86:

Hmmm.  I'm hoping for something closer to a standard linux distro, but
optimized to run off a CF card.  Usually that means the root FS and
other frequently modified files are loaded onto a RAM disk rather than
being run in place on the card.

The WRAP board has an x86 processor, 128M of RAM, and with a 1G CF
card enough storage for a desktop distro, especially if it excludes
anything requiring X.  But CF cards wear out pretty quickly if you let
the OS touch them as often as it wants to touch a disk.  So some
changes are necessary, or at least advised.

(Yeah, one option is to keep the receipt on the "lifetime warranty" CF
card.  But I don't want to replace and rebuild every six months. :-)

Thanks,

--Eric

Use a distribution made to be run from a CD (like INSERT or LNX-BBC) or
one made to be run from a USB stick (I modified INSERT to run on my USB
stick).  They're already set up to copy anything that needs to be RW to
RAM... it should be trivial to add a RW partition to your flash to store
things you need to modify.

Ubuntu ships free (at least it did) you can order them online at 
shipit.ubuntulinux.org  Also, I have about 100 ubuntu disks, but they 
are the older version. These have the live cd, x86 cd, and the 64bit cd. 
If you want them you can have them. I am out in OC, but can meet you

Message-ID: <43FA43A2.2020402@verizon.net>

All,

I sent this earlier today and it never came through.  If it shows up 
twice...forgive me...still having Actiontec issues.



Some thoughts gleaned from attending yesterday's clinic at Free Geek:

1)  Thanks to the folks at Free Geek for the space and time to put the 
clinic on!!!!

2)  Unhooking my computer and hauling it down to Free Geek showed a few 
things unseen at home.

In recent posts we talked about Firefox having issues.  I noted then the 
common denominator was the Actiontec modem but didn't put 2 & 2 
together.  At the clinic I had no issues with Firefox.  It worked perfectly.
My second issue was that my computer wasn't syncronizing with the NTP 
pool of servers and keeping my system clock up to date.  I told Aaron to 
watch as the failure went by booting Ubuntu...it didn't fail!!  So I 
came home (after an expensive tow back to Sandy, Oregon) hooked my box 
back up, jumped into the modem setup and changed the level of security 
on the firewall, saved and restarted, Firefox suddenly had issues again, 
and upon reboot, the NTP failure was still there.
FWIW the issue seems to be the Actiontec.  More study to follow.  There 
must be a way to change something that will not inhibit what I want to 
happen here.

Thanks again to all who made the clinic possible!!

Bruce

BTW...any ideas you all have will be gratefully read!!

What is the exact setup you have on the actiontec? The NTP issue seems
self-explanatory, what issues are you having with firefox?

Subject: [PLUG] "Enter email address" CGI code for web page
Message-ID: <20060221023303.GB4919@gate.kl-ic.com>


I am implementing postgrey graylisting now, and it works great.
However,  every month or so, somebody with a goofy mailer is unable
to get through with a message. 

I would like to set up an "enter your email, and interpret the
screwy looking text in this box" authenticator form to my web
pages, so a human being whose mailer gets trapped by the graylisting
can whitelist themselves.  This would also be an easy way for me
to whitelist somebody from an insecure remote site.  

I could pungle something up, but this seems like such a common task
that somebody somewhere has already written some code for it.  Does
anyone know of such code (Perl preferred)?  Suggestions for the proper
google search words?   Any sites that elegantly use such a feature
that I might at least mimic?  I could probably extract something
from slashcode ...

I will also need a Perl snippet that verifies a correctly formed
email address;  if that is not attached to the code above, I can
probably find that somewhere on CPAN.

Google for CAPTCHA.  Might even be CPAN'ed already.

Great pointer - the magic word is "CAPTCHA", (an acronym for "Completely
Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart").  The
Wikipedia article goes into it at great length, points at coding examples,
and points out that there are some laboratory demonstrations of cracking
techniques, as well as problems for blind folks. 

One of the cool pointers is to http://captchas.net/ , a free site that
provides both visual and audio captchas (for the blind) that I can link
a Perl program to.  That seems like the easiest way to provide an 
accessable page, reduce dependencies, and let somebody else keep the
technology updated.  If they go away, there are other options.

It is not like this must be absolutely great - if a spammer decides to
burn valuable compute resources cracking my captchas, they have earned
the right to get through greylisting and talk to spamassassin.  Further,
since I expect this to be used rather rarely, a burst of usage probably
indicates abuse, and I can simply throw those addresses away, or perhaps
use them to Detect Crimes.  It is unlikely that I will have to worry 
about it - spammers have higher value victims.

Is there any benefit to having IP addresses in the hosts.deny and

I'm running DenyHosts (http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/) to cut down on 
the ssh attacks on several systems.  The files are getting quite large. 
  Since sshd has read them each time I figured sorted order would be a

Hi Rod,

A far easier solution is to move ssh to a non-standard port.

I know y'all will find the subject amusing, but it was scary.

I have Ubuntu-64 Breezy on my laptop. My desktop is Windows 
2000. Hanging on a USB 2.0 port on the Windows computer is a 
big-ass external hard disk that I use for backups. Since it is on the 
Windows computer, I created a share for it so the laptop can see it 
as well. The laptop and the desktop are networked with ethernet, 
both 10/100, only a few feet apart.

Some time ago I had copied 8.9 GB of mp3s from the laptop to the 
USB drive as a backup. A few days ago I had a mess caused by 
dump, where it overloaded the hard drive in the laptop. In order to 
get some space I deleted the 8.9 GB of mp3s on the laptop, 
knowing that I had a safe copy on the USB drive so I could just 
copy them back later. 

So today I decided to do that. The copy process was about 2/3 of 
the way through when suddenly I was staring at a blue screen on 
the Windows computer. "Exception not handled" or something. 
(Why does MS give us these error messages? No one understands 
what they mean.) 

The Windows computer is totally stable. It runs 24/7 for months 
without being restarted. In fact, this is perhaps the first time it has 
ever crashed in several years of running it, not counting six months 
ago when the hard disk was dying.

I had no problems when I originally copied the files to the USB 
disk. It was just copying them back this morning when something 
evil happened. I normally use the network just for moving incidental 
things back and forth, and for printing to my big Laserjets. There 
has never been a problem before.

I realize it's probably something on the Windows computer and not 
the laptop, but has anyone ever seen something like this? I don't 
like stuff I can't trust.

Aside from Windows crashing during the copy, how exactly do you come to 
the conclusion that this was the event that caused the BSoD?

Also, nonsensical error messages are not something unique to Windows.

It was, indeed, entirely on the Windows computer.  My guess would be it
was due to the high traffic flowing either over USB or your network from
the copy.  Next time you get a BSOD on Windows, try and see if there is
a driver associated with it.. you should be able to see the BSOD
information in the Windows Event Viewer if you want to diagnose the one
you already had.

John,

 Are you able to reboot the Win box successfully?

If it were me, I would run error checking on the drive, then defrag.

Consider that the Windows computer is 4 years old and has never 
crashed ever, except when the hard disk was failing last April. 
Programs crash and burn from time to time, but the OS is solid. 
Yet, this morning's activity was something I'd never done before -- 
transferring a huge load of files over the network. The pathway had 
to go through the Windows computer. Hence my conclusion that 
something in the Windows networking stuff went haywire. 

Admittedly, the evidence is circumstantial. But we've hanged 
people on skimpier proof.

Ah, Event Viewer. Why didn't I think of that?

OK, the previous message prior to the crash was several days ago. 
Then this morning at 7:55 there are messages from the reboot. But 
nothing prior to the reboot saying what was going on at the time of 
the crash. However, the first message on the reboot says:

The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck.  The bugcheck was: 0x0000001e 
(0xc0000005, 0x804373f6, 0x00028892, 0x00000001). Microsoft Windows 2000 
[v15.2195]. A dump was saved in: C:\WINNT\Minidump\Mini022106-01.dmp. 

So I opened the Minidump file in Notepad, but it's just a bunch of gibberish. No 
human words in it.

Something else you said makes me suspicious -- "over USB." When I built this 
computer it just had USB 1.1 on the motherboard, which Windows 2000 was 
happy to configure and use. But a couple years ago I added a USB 2.0 + Firewire 
card. Originally I used the drivers that came from the manufacturer, but after adding 
SP2 I was able to switch to Windows drivers for it. The external disk I was copying 
from is on one of the ports on that card. I'll just bet that's where the problem is.

OK, I think what I will do is ignore the problem for the time being. If it's the driver for 
that card, there may be a better driver, but it may also be a hardware problem on 
the card. If it ever happens again I will carefully write down everything on the 
BSoD before rebooting. Then maybe I can tell for sure where the problem lies. I 
don't have time to spend hours googling all over the net looking for solutions when 
I'm not sure that's where the problem lies in the first place. 

Thanks for the response. It's interesting that I find out more about Windows from 
Linux people than from Windows forums. :)

Yeah, we all got that it's a Windows problem and it clearly doesn't matter

Um, isn't the whole friggin' point of a USB drive that it's portable?

Why bother with network transfer speeds when you can just move the USB 
cable?  After all, as you wrote, it's only a few feet.

That's ridiculous.  It should work as he has it set up.  Off the cuff it 
sounds like a shady network driver, or at least a network issue on the 
Windows side.  But really it could be anything, even just a random anomaly.

Just because something is portable doesn't mean it must always be. 
Actually your idea sounds rather inconvenient in a modern world.

It's not ridiculous at all.  The transfer would be many times faster and 
the effort is minimal.

Of course, it should.  It should also work if he set up radio tranceivers 
and sent the bits across as amplitude spikes at 500kHz.  Doesn't make it 
the best way to do the job.

You think it sounds inconvenient to unplug a device and plug it into 
another when they're a few feet apart?

Well, my understanding of Windows increased tenfold when I started using
Linux.  I started applying some *nix principles to how I looked at
Windows and started to understand the *whys* of it better.  I see how
Linux does something and think to myself "Windows has to solve this
problem, too - how the hell did they do it?"  .... which I usually
answer with "oh wow, I can't believe they did it like that.  They're
insane!"  :-)

So since I stopped using Windows, my ability to troubleshoot it has
stayed about the same.  I don't have as much real-world experience with
the latest stuff as I used to, but I can fudge that with a better
understanding of how it works...

BTW, I *hate* fixing Windows computers.  UGH!  I have two dead ones
sitting here right now I need to fix.  :-\

That doesn't help when you're behind a firewall that blocks any
non-standard ports.

I just recently began using a nifty iptables trick that limits the
rate of new incoming SSH connections (three/minute in this case):

  iptables -N SSH_LIMIT
  iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -j SSH_LIMIT
  iptables -A SSH_LIMIT -m state --state NEW -m recent --set --name SSH
  iptables -A SSH_LIMIT -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 4 --name SSH
  iptables -A SSH_LIMIT -m state --state NEW -m recent --rcheck --seconds 60 --hitcount 4 --name SSH -j DROP

So far it works great. Where there used to be a zillion worm turds in
my auth.log, now there are only three per attacker. Seems like the
worms are smart enough to go away after being ignored.

If I were him, and I had gigs of data to transfer like that once in a 
while then no (assuming his older Win2K machine uses a 100Mb 
connection).  It's more convenient to get the transfer done faster.  But 
moving things back and forth frequently, if that's the case, then yes. 
Even if they were 1ft apart.  It would be better to invest in Gb 
ethernet then and put the bottleneck back on the USB.

On a side note, I have never had one but I've read a Firewire device can 
be shared via a Firewire hub.  Both machines would see the device as 
natively attached.  You would retain almost as much portability and gain 
transfer speed over a 10/100 network.

If you want it, you must provide transport.  (It will not fit on my bike.)

It is actually a bit inconvenient. It is plugged into the back of the 
Windows 2000 computer, because that's where the USB 
connectors on the card are. The box is sitting under my desk. The 
USB drive is also under the desk. So I'd have to get down on my 
hands and knees and crawl around. It's dusty down there too. (So, 
housekeeping is not my strong suit -- who eats off the floor 
anyway?) Add the fact that I'm lazy and I'm sitting in an extremely 
comfortable chair in front of the computer. It's so much easier to 
tell Krusader to go get the files. 

It's not like I'm in a hurry, so throughput speed is not an issue, 
either. Yeah, I realize most people here are into major networking 
issues for big installations, where speed is a serious concern. This 
is just a little home peer to peer situation and I rarely need to 
transfer that much at once. Once in a while I need to move a single 
file back and forth, that's all. So forget gigabyte networks and all 
that stuff. 

Now I have to go see if I can recover yesterday's homework file that 
I just accidentally overwrote with OO.o Writer half an hour ago. 
Without thinking I did a Save when I meant to do a Save As. 
Automatic backups are turned on, but I searched from the root and 
no backup file exists. 

This is seriously not my day for computers.

Very nice.  Question ( as I'm an iptables neophite ) is this total 
connections or per connecting IP?  Say 5 people, that should be 
connecting, try in the same one minute period.  Do they all get in if 
they make the connection in the first try?

Terrible phrasing and terminology ... I know.  Hopefully it gets my 
question across.

One of the captcha cracking techniques is to present your captcha image to someone
requesting access to a porn site.  The human wanting porn access becomes part of
your spammers computing system.

Subject: [PJUG Javamail] Spring, Forms, etc.

Hi all,

This is probably simple once you know the answers.  :-)

I have a client who is insisting that our web site open a new window (no
problem), that connects to their site (no
problem) with a post.  (uh-oh)

We're using Spring.  The page where the link to their site appears is
already a form.  If I put a form within a form, our form controller grabs
the inner submit and prevents the desired behavior.  

So I make the link to point to a new jsp (or html) with a very simple
controller that says basically "return the FormView."  I can make that page
a form with their site the <action = xxx>, but then --- how do I make the
page submit itself?  (If I do a meta-refresh, we lose the password that the
other guy wants in a field of the form.)

Any ideas?

Is there a clean way to do this with Spring?  Alternatively, is there a
clean way to call a vanilla html page and get it to call "submit" on itself?

But aren't you the boss of the firewall, since you're creating these rules? 
Anyway, your iptables hack is very excellent.

 It does not discriminate on the basis of source address. It simply 
rate-limits the number of new connections per minute from anywhere. So if 
your limit is 4/minute, and 5 people try to connect, the last one will be 
blocked, and will have to wait. OpenSSH keeps trying

You might want to create an allow rule if you log in from the same remote 
address a lot. Something like this that puts no restrictions on SSH traffic 
from a particular address:

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 12.34.56.78 --dport 22 ?sport 1024:65535 -m state 
--state NEW -j ACCEPT

Put this rule way high up in your script, to come before any other rules. This 
example restricts the source ports because anything coming from a privileged 
port is probably trouble, like from a compromised host using a spoofed IP.

Some of our ISPs filter out more stuff.  Mine doesn't filter much
*incoming* ... but I wouldn't put it past them to start.  I wouldn't be
surprised if some folks on the list *did* have most non-standard ports
filtered out (although to have ssh be one of the open ones would be rare).

I hadn't.
I have now.
How do I make it "do what I want it to"?  I do not need the "more".
In the chat, my messages appear with the time stamp followed by 15 characters 
(my jabberid up to the @ sign).  So I have shaved 10  characters off my messages 
in the chat window vis-a-vis Kopete.
The name I gave it when I started psi was 5 characters long.  That is what I 
expected would appear in the chat window.  The contacts have an alias which can 
be short.  I find no way to set an alias for me, in either Koptete or Psi.

This I mostly have on the servers I control.  And some of those are 
locked down pretty darn tight.  Sometimes too tight.  I've need to get 
in so had to ssh to one that was _more open_ so I could ssh to the one 
that was locked down but allowed the other to connect.

I'll experiment with this.  Thanks to you and Paul.

Ah, the original post. :) DenyHosts is quite nice, and a lot easier than 
learning iptables. I don't think sorted order would gain much. Plain text 
files are very fast for even old computers to read. If your hosts.deny and 
hosts.allow files are so large that this would make a difference, I suggest 
making your PURGE_DENY setting lower. Your hosts.deny file is the one that 
should be big anyway, if your hosts.allow file is growing out of control I 
would wonder what is going on.

Message-ID: <ca5165530602211552t60453bb2s5dfb4edf6073eb92@mail.gmail.com>

I have done this before but I cannot seem to find the resources that
explain it to me now.

The problem:
I have built a kernel from kernel.org (with various patches) to try to
help me solve one
of my problems with process scheduling.  It gets built but fails with a kernel
panic.  I have fixed the initrd image to include the various things
that the FC4 kernels
have in the initrd file. The grub lines look exactly like any of the
other FC4 kernel lines.

The question:
1) How to get the kernel build to place the correct files for loading
modules into
the initrd? (LVM and ata_piix modules).
2) How to tell grub the proper configuration to boot my kernel?

I am. I was referring to when I'm a client on someone else's network,
one with a firewall that blocks most outbound ports. In that sort of
situation, if my server doesn't listen on the usual SSH port, I'm
hosed.

That doesn't seem to be the case in my experience. After three
consecutive logins from client A, I can switch to client B (on an
entirely different network) and get through just fine. Unfortunately
I'm not yet good enough with iptables to explain how/why this is the
case.

So it looks like it does check the source IPs and counts them, rather than all 
connections like I thought. Quite ingenious.

_Very_ nice.  I'll set it for those id10ts out there that slam my 
systems but at a higher rate; say 10 per minute.  Then let DenyHosts 
pick up the clever ones that might hit at a slower rate.   Most of them 
are too stupid and will pound away ( typically I see once every two 
seconds ) and the iptables rules will get them.

Again thanks Paul and Carla.

Last summer, 4 Beaverton friends and I rented a UHaul truck, filled
it with Ejunk, and hauled this vast pile over to Free Geek (we called
first to warn them).  This might be a useful PLUG activity, sharing
a truck (and some strong backs and strong wills) to get rid of stuff.
The psychological aspect is important - many of us have old stuff
"that might be useful someday" and is just dragging down our Karma.
Liberate the atoms and liberate your life!

Today I liberated the atoms of the car my wife and I have used for
22 years.  It felt weird, but among the sadness there is a bit of
lightness, too.  This might be a good winter cheer-up activity, 
especially if the piles of junk have been blocking the windows...

Keith,

   Several of us have pickup trucks. I even have a ramp and board for getting
big, heavy things on and off (such as large copiers). I'm sure that a convoy
could be arranged. Of course, I'm on the east side so I'd prefer to assist
folks on this side of the river.

Message-ID: <20060222005946.GA18333@gate.kl-ic.com>


USB Flash Drives.  Handy, but they tend to migrate to pockets, and
pockets tend to migrate to washing machines.   I just lost my second
one.  Bits do not like laundry soap.

I bought a pqi 128MB USB flash drive at Fry's today for $11, with the
packaging claiming waterproof.  A soak in the sink falsified that. 
Fryed again!

Allegedly, A-DATA makes a rubber-covered flash drive that is waterproof.
SanDisk makes one that is ruggedized waterproof, but it is only available
to OEM customers.  

Does anyone have experience with waterproof USB drives?  A quick 
Google search shows that thousands have had the alternative experience.

[...]

Here's how I'd do it:

 -- isp ---- 67.170.150.151 [ CCBox ] 192.168.0.1 --- lan
                              192.168.1.1 
                                    \
                                     \_ Wireless AP
                                        192.168.1.2

 
If you've got three NICs in the CC box, it should look something like
this.  It is possible that when you put the third NIC into the CC box
before, it disrupted the NIC order, which caused it not to have the
right IP connected to the right wire.

One little trick, you can plug the ethernet cable into one of the
Wireless AP's LAN ports (not the WAN port) and it should bridge the
traffic.  Turn off DHCP on the AP and give it an IP of 192.168.1.2 and
you can still talk to it.  Configure DHCP on the CC Box to hand out
addresses on the 192.168.1.0/24 network too.

Oh.  And set your ESSID to "www.personaltelco.net" at the same time!
;-)

I've got a bunch of the A-DATA rubber-coated drives.  I haven't dunked 
them to be sure, but I doubt they'd survive.  The cap does not sit 
tightly against the body- there is a slight gap and it doesn't take 
much to wiggle the gap even wider.  There is also a small gap between 
the body of the drive and it's rubber exterior.  Any water that got in 
through the cap would probably migrate down into the guts pretty easily.

The rubber coating is very effective against accidental drops though.

Dang.  After a rinse in distilled water, did it come back to life?

I wouldn't trust the waterproofing unless I'd personally potted it in
silicone.  The USB connector's pins are gold-plated and widely-spaced
enough to avoid problems with water or mineral residue.

Heck--take it out of its case, stick it in the finger of a disposable
glove, fill with silicone, and you have a Lofstrom Special ducky-drive.
(Maybe you can stick an o-ring in too so you have a handy lanyard loop.)

Hmm... I just saw a row of dime-sized "devil duckies" on someone's desk...

Keith,

Just wondering if you were not suppose to take them out of the package
to test to see if they were waterproof.  87)

Dry it out... it'll come back to life with data accessible. I recently 
sent my dane 512 through the washer, it was in 3 peices when I got it 
back. I plugged it in, and it worked. I would have thought that the 
circuitry would have been fried, but still works like a champ.... too 
bad I didn't know about that the last time I sent one through the washer.

There's a "Show Self Contact" button on the current Psi.  Do that, click
on yourself, F2 to rename.

I got this favorable response from Drew when I suggested that he give a talk
on PHP coding with an eye toward web site security.

Who should this be coordinated with?

Hi Chaz-

I'd certainly be willing to. I am currently out of town on a business trip
to Atlanta Georgia until the end of February but once I'm back in town and
settled in again I think it'd be a great opportunity.

Thanks, Wil.

But I cannot get a response from F2, and when I look at the context menu, the 
closest I come to rename is user info.  Clicking that produces a window which 
looks like a vCard entry.  Changes there require "publish" to avoid discarding, 
and I receive the message Cannot Publish: Reason (blank).  I am using Psi 0.9.3. 
  Is that the "current" version?  I am using what comes with Kubuntu 5.10.

   There are other leakproof containers that can be used for safe computing.

All right, lets see if I can get through now.  For some reason I was 
messing with the list's filters and getting blacklisted.

Whenever I change the settings on the Actiontec (including turning the 
wireless on of off) Firefox opens but hangs at about 50% of the process 
of finding google, Intellicast, or most places I try to browse to.  It 
will go to Ubuntu/wiki (most of the time) when it is having issues 
(which seems a little confusing).  Most of the time Konqueror works fine 
at these times and Firefox just seems to work it's temper tantrum out 
after a time (sometimes hours, at least once it was days).

All,

I sent this earlier today and it never came through.  If it shows up
twice...forgive me...still having Actiontec issues.



Some thoughts gleaned from attending yesterday's clinic at Free Geek:

1)  Thanks to the folks at Free Geek for the space and time to put the
clinic on!!!!

2)  Unhooking my computer and hauling it down to Free Geek showed a few
things unseen at home.

In recent posts we talked about Firefox having issues.  I noted then the
common denominator was the Actiontec modem but didn't put 2 & 2
together.  At the clinic I had no issues with Firefox.  It worked
perfectly.
My second issue was that my computer wasn't syncronizing with the NTP
pool of servers and keeping my system clock up to date.  I told Aaron to
watch as the failure went by booting Ubuntu...it didn't fail!!  So I
came home (after an expensive tow back to Sandy, Oregon) hooked my box
back up, jumped into the modem setup and changed the level of security
on the firewall, saved and restarted, Firefox suddenly had issues again,
and upon reboot, the NTP failure was still there.
FWIW the issue seems to be the Actiontec.  More study to follow.  There
must be a way to change something that will not inhibit what I want to
happen here.

Thanks again to all who made the clinic possible!!

Bruce

BTW...any ideas you all have will be gratefully read!!

Well, it's here, so I presume it was the HTML setting in Thunderbird.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0602231433140.17083@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I would appreciate a pointer to a step-by-step guide to enabling sound on
this box.

   I see in dmesg that the via82xx driver is installed (via82xx: Assuming DXS
channels with 48k fixed sample rate.). Running alsactl finds and configures
that card. Then, alsamixer comes up, and alsactl tells me that everything
should work. xmms runs and I can see the oscilliscope image dancing with the
music, but no sound through the speakers in the monitor. I'm testing with a
mp3 file.

   There's a blue-plugged cable that is connected to the blue-rimmed outlet on
the back of the box, and the green end is plugged into the socket on the
monitor (a Hyundai ImageQuest L70S).

   What have I missed in this?

Thanks,

Rich

The standard for main speakers is the green rimmed jack. (Me thinks
this should be
the front speakers if you have three or six jacks on the back of the box)

   I just went through the trouble-shooting steps on the alsa Web site.
Everything seems to be correct, but there's no sound.

Have you checked the output plugin for xmms?  Is it using alsa?

Larry,

   A-ha! I had not looked closely at the back of the monitor (with a
flashlight and reading glasses). Sure enough, the green jack is marked with a
little headphone, and the blue jack is marked with what's supposed to be a
speaker pair.

   Swapping the cable so it connects green on the box to blue on the monitor
fixed it right up.

   Thank you very much. Never before paid any attention to this.

On the two or three occasions I've had a similar problem (spaced months 
apart), I've always found that the mixer comes up with the channel I 
need muted. It's the software version of "did you check the cables?" I 
trust you've already thought of it, but in case you didn't...

Rich, I have no idea what your mixer looks like, but I recently had a
'no sound' experience that was cured by *muting* the digital(SPDIF)
output.

   Right and left.

   One of the reasons I like working in virtual terminals is that I don't need

   Since I'm cheering you all up with my naivete today, let me ask the next
question: How to I tell Firefox to open xmms when it finds an mms file on a
link? I've gone to Edit->Preferences->Downloads and tried to enter 'mms' in
the downloads action dialog box. No joy there.

   There's a Web site that has sample files in mms format. My Google search
taught me that this is the "multimedia messaging service" follow up to the
infamous SMS text messaging. I've no idea why this is the format they
provide, but ... there it is.

   Is this unavailable to us antiques who could not care less about text
messaging?

TIA,

Rich

Message-ID: <20060224010529.T13578@eehouse.org>

I've lost the mail, but I posted earlier looking for a distro meant to
be run off of a CF card.  Like pebble, but with apt-get working.  One
response suggested a new google search term, and that led me to Voyage
Linux.

http://www.voyage.hk/software/voyage.html

I installed it following the directions on a 128M CF card, used
apt-get to remove the wireless-related packages and to install enough
of apache and perl to run cgi scripts, and I now have a decent little
web server that draws 3 watts and makes no noise at all.  I'm happy so
far, thankful for the suggestions, and hope this is useful to
somebody.

Hello all,

I'm going to embark on building another server in the next 2 days and 
was looking for some advise on how to move all my users/home dirs/ 
config files(mail, http, ftp, etc.) 

I have a fedora 1 server and plan to go with CentOS4.2 as the new server. 

Is there any tools or thoughts of actions or tips that one could point 
me towards that I could read as I build the new system and get ready to 
move the new tools.  I do plan on using SELinux as well on the new 
server.  Thoughts on that as well will be appreciated.  I haven't dived 
into that area yet. 

Thanks,

Josh

According to the description given at http://sourceforge.net (do NOT 
prefix sourceforge with "www." or you will go to the wrong site), "you 
can clone a system to many (~40 ) clients simultaneously," (see 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/clonezilla).

Thank you for asking a question about Clonezilla. Because of your 
question and the effort I put forth to answer it (a quick search at 
sourceforge.net), I think I found a solution for making full disk images 
that is better than taking a dump (using the dump command to backup your 
entire system)!

I hope this helps.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0602232007320.31299@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Since getting sound working on the workstation/server was so easy -- once I
had the wire plugged in correctly -- I decided to get sound working again on
the two portables. But, so far no luck.

   The Sony Vaio had working sound with the 2.4.24 kernel, now that I'm
running 2.6.13 I cannot find /proc/asound nor any indication in dmesg of what
the sound chip might be. There's also no /dev/dsp. The IBM ThinkPad 600E is
running the 2.4.31 kernel (same as my workstation/server), but that, too, has
no /proc/asound/ and no indication in dmesg of what the sound chip is. Sound
used to work on both.

   Starting at the beginning, what are the options for determining the sound
chips in these two portables? Once I know that I can make sure I have the
modules loaded and running and run down the trouble-shooting list at the ALSA
Web site.

Thanks,

Rich

I assume that you are using Ghost for distributing Windows... (We all 
know what happens when you assume) disregard the rest of this message if 
you are not.

No experience with Clonezilla, but another option may be Unattended.
http://unattended.sourceforge.net/

The server is fairly straight forward to set up, you can customize 
driver templates, integrate apps and hot fixes. Unlike Ghost, it is 
truly a unique install to each machine, which does have some 
advantages.  Once you have it configured like you want, you can drop in 
a CD and come back in thirty minutes and have a fully configured 
machine. Unfortunately for us, this has not replaced Ghost completely, 
we use it in addition to (we still use Ghost for large labs). Unattended 
has been good for the areas that do not have such a large install base. 
For some it may be able to replace it completely.
Good luck,
Dave Poirier

lscpi reveals all, grasshopper. Run update-pciids first to bring it up to 
date. Then you can google on the chipsets to see what drivers they need.

I could well believe that is what it stands for, but to my knowledge it
is completely unrelated to SMS.

Unless you've found something bizzare, you might want MiMMS. Simple MMS
client which simply downloads MMS streams, rather than being a player.

Hmm, made no difference here. I /did/ go to a different site if I used

"MMS" stands for something like "Microsoft Media Server", and is the
protocol Bill, etc. use to deliver streaming audio/video. I use a neat
little command-line app called "mimms" every so often to save an MMS
stream to disk. A lot of media outlets use MMS to deliver their audio
programming over the web.

Unfortunately, I've never had the need to add a new protocol handler
to Firefox. The following page appears helpful, though:

"lspci" as root is a good start.  On my Thinkpad T30, it says,
among many other things:

...
00:1f.5 Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corp. 82801CA/CAM AC'97 Audio (rev 02)
...

There is also good information on the Linux for Laptops site:
http://www.linux-laptop.net/ .  Look up your machines there, 
and see what others have done to get their sound working.

Paul,

   I shouldda' known it was Winduhs-specific. I'll try mimms.

   There is a Web page with instructions for adding that protocol to Firefox.
Worked for the guy who posted it, but not for me. I suspect that it's because
there are multiple definitions of 'mms'.

Thank you very much,

   Thanks, Elliott. Am I correct in assuming that once downloaded it can be
played with some tool I have? I'll go find some documentation for Ms MiMMS.

Paul,

   My search on Google turned up a number of Debian packages and
documentation. At the Koders Web site I found mimms.cpp, but it won't compile
here. I suspect from my look at the screen that it's because Slackware does
not have the CPP STLs installed.

   So, the beat goes on. If someone has a working binary to share, please
e-mail it to me and I'll take it for a test drive. The man page would also be
helpful.

Thanks,

Rich

   I found the docs for the Sony last evening. It has the Intel i810 chip.
Unfortunately, it also lost the default route to the network, so I called it
a night and shut it down.

   Thank you, Keith. It had been working before the upgrade to 10.2 and the
2.4.31 kernel. I forget the driver name, but it was there before; I'll find
it again this weekend.

You probably want snd-intel8x0 then.

Subject: [PLUG] A New (to me) phishing attack
Message-ID: <43FF46B3.7050005@comcast.net>

I've gotten a couple of e-mails claiming that I've successfully added a 
new e-mail address to my PayPal (or PayPa1, or PayPaI) account. All I 
have to do is click on this handy link. I have not done so, nor do I 
plan to. The link is as follows:

Am I correct in assuming that this link goes to someplace within Yahoo? 
I sent the entire e-mail off to abuse at yahoo.com, but they think I'm 
complaining about the e-mail coming from yahoo mail, I'm on my third 
exchange with them to get them to look at the link, and not the spoofed 
(is that the right term for it?) e-mail header.

Anyway, can anyone take a guess as to what that http string is trying to do?

And, just in case anyone wonders, no, I haven't tried to add an e-mail 
address to my PayPal account, nor done anything else with that account 
in the last couple of weeks!

Message-ID: <1140778260.43fee51455a24@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I recently tried to go from two to three add on 100baseTX cards
on an Intel D815EEA2 motherboard.  Ended up jerking my wireless 
card and a modem to make this work.  What frustrates me is that 
the USB takes two interrupts and can't be disabled.  Why is it
that USB didn't replace all the PS/2 ports, serial ports, and
parallel port?  How hard would it be to keep these ports in
the same place on the motherboard but make them part of the
USB system to save interrupts? 

Why did PC manufacturers violate the hard drives go on IRQ 14
standard and extend them out over 15 as well?  Why is there
IRQ sharing and confusing ACPI steering instead of something
less insane such as more IRQ's?  Why is it that PCI slot 1
and slot 5 on this motherboard are somehow tied together in
the bios?

USB is supposed to be the new standard replacing the old serial,
parallel, and PS/2 port standards.  I've yet to see a PC
motherboard that is solely PS/2 based for the keyboard, mouse,
din serial devices, centronic parallel devices, etc.  If something
were done to get the hard drive back to one interrupt and
all serial devices down to one interrupt, IRQ conflicts would 
be less of an issue.  For that matter, the floppy controller
anymore seems to be a waste.

That's a standard yahoo redirect. It's being abused by someone to "mask" a destination URL.  It's been abused since the dawn of time, who knows why Yahoo still has it.

The destination URL is the last part there after the asterisk. The destination URL is a decimal encoded IP address (3639747790) which becomes 216.242.36.206. Port is 84, and URI is /page/webscr/.

It has nothing to do with Yahoo!. They just have this braindead scheme of "all links must go to our redirect page!" and so it's a very convenient way for phishers and other black-hats to confuse people.

Aaron

This is just redirecting people to:

216.242.36.206

The IP has just been converted to a long. The actual link the browser 
uses starts at the * so all the stuff before it, yahoo's stuff, is just 
disregarded. It's actually not bad as once you get to the site, it tells 
you to click a link which resizes the browser while removing the address 
bar.

Takes you to http://3639747790:84/page/webscr/

(I believe the numeric address there is simply the IP address converted
to decimal format)

...which then says the page moved, requiring you click "here" to go to
the updated page, which is a javascript popup to a php page that looks a
bit like the paypal login page, asking you for your username and password.

The username and password PHP page sends your username and password (if
supplied) to..

http://3639747790:84/page/webscr/login.php

...as POST data.  I think it would probably be trivial to write up a
quick bash/cURL script to flood that page with a ton of incorrect
usernames and passwords.  If you were in to that kind of thing.  :-)

Thanks. I figured I'd get a better answer here than from Yahoo!

Dick,

   Yes, it's at yahoo. What you want to do is turn on full headers, then
forward the entire message to 'abuse at paypal.com'; since they're owned by
eBay I also copy 'spoof at ebay.com' to the address line. Let eBay and PayPal
talk with the yahoo yahoos.

   I've been getting these (from supposedly both ebay.com and paypal.com) for
months. As soon as I turn on the full headers I can see the actual IP address
of their link. It's almost always in Asia.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0602241022010.8018@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Well! I finally got it all working ... I think. I don't know if the 'wma'
are supposed to include video with the audio, but the process I found creates
large mp3 files which are only audio. That's OK with me; I don't know that
looking at people speaking adds much to the content's value.

   Here's what I did:

   1.) Set up Firefox to use ximms to process .wma files. When I tried this, I
discovered that the files were not run, but were copied to disk.

   2.) Went hunting on Google and learned that it's a rather involved process
to convert .wma to .mp3 (stupid Winduhs stuff). Requires Mplayer and lame,
plus libtheora and cdparanoia (which I didn't discover until later in the
process). Went to linuxpackages.net and got mplayer, mplayer_codecs, and lame;
installed same. Went back later for libtheora and cdparanoia.

   3.) Built the conversion shell script to convert formats:

#!/bin/bash

current_directory=$( pwd )

#remove spaces
for i in *.wma; do mv "$i" `echo $i | tr ' ' '_'`; done

#remove uppercase
for i in *.[Ww][Mm][Aa]; do mv "$i" `echo $i | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'`; done

#Rip with Mplayer / encode with LAME
for i in *.wma ; do mplayer -vo null -vc dummy -af resample=44100 -ao pcm:waveheader $i && lame -m s audiodump.wav -o $i; done

#convert file names
for i in *.wma; do mv "$i" "`basename "$i" .wma`.mp3"; done

rm audiodump.wav

   Made above executable and copied to /usr/local/bin.

   4.) Made a subdirectory for the conversion, just in case it got messy and
splattered bits around. Moved all .wma into that subdirectory and ran
'wmamp3'. After several false starts because of missing packages, it woiked!

   Wow!

   Now for you multimedia gurus: is there any way to watch/listen to a live
feed of this stuff?

You've got lots of great information but I'll throw in my 00000010 
cents.  When I have spare time I love to play with these.  I'll go in 
and use a bogus email address "imblank at nowhere.com" and a very obscene 
password.  If there is more to fill in I like to get nastier ( if that 
is possible? )
    I use a VISA card number of 411111111111111 ( used for testing CC 
handling as it will verify via most CC processing software ) and some 
date in the future for expiration.  A IL or UKN for CVV or if that isn't 
accepted a "666".

How you get more than one version installed I have not tried but I
know it is possible.

you can have a gcc4 and gcc4 directory tree, and
when you need to compile something with the older
gcc, do something like cc=gcc3 if you are using
./configure or cc == gcc version 4 and cc3 == v' 3

i dont know if their is a naming 'standard' for
mixing them.

***Register for O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference
We're five years into the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference and
the stuff of which it is made shows no sign of abating: bandwidth
continues to broaden, storage grows ever larger and cheaper, and content
keeps spraying from the fire hose. How do we visualize all of this
digital data, filter it, remix it, and access it in meaningful ways? The
coming technical challenge is not about generating digital content-we
have more than enough already. It's time to do something with that data.
It's time to build The Attention Economy.

***Introducing Lua 
Scripting is highly important to extensible applications. Not only is it
easier to write logic in higher-level languages, but it's often safer. 
It can be effective, too--consider that World of Warcraft and
other games embed the Lua language and use it for scripts, AI,
configuration, and even user interface management. Why Lua? Keith
Fieldhouse introduces the language and explains why it's so appropriate.

***Building a High-Availability MySQL Cluster 
Serious business services really can't go down, whether due to hardware

redundant, failure-proof replication and availability of their data.

Webex (www.webex.com) is a web-based teleconferencing app, which
supposedly works with Netscape/Mozilla/Firefox on Linux.  I attempted
to join in a conference with a fellow at HP today and failed. 
It probably was the nut holding the mouse.

Has anyone else used webex?  Any suggestions?  Is there an open 
source manual for howto for this?  Almost everything on the web

Since I started using Thunderbird, which lets me hide the headers on the 
screen even when they are on, I've left full headers turned on so 
they'll go with whatever I forward. I've got PayPal's address in my 
address book, since I seem to need it somewhat regularly. I hadn't 
thought of ebay, though. I'll add them to my list.

I've been getting enough spam that now I check for it using Comcast's 
web client, where I can check a box next to all the messages I want to 
report as spam and take care of them in one go. Then I download them 
with T-Bird. The only ones I spend any more time on are obvious fraud 
attempts like these two. The rest are too much trouble for me to waste 
my time on.

Do the Yahoo redirects or the integer encoding of an IP?  An IP address
is just a four-byte address.  Convert the four bytes to an integer and

   Have you thought about installing SpamAssassin locally? I created a new
mail file called 'spam-uncaught' and save what gets past the guards at the
gate in there. Once a week I run SA in learning mode against those messages,
then I delete them. (Periodically I run SA in 'ham' learning mode, too.) The
results are interesting.

   I receive 3-7 spam per day now; most are rejected before they get into the
system (1,881 yesterday alone). The patterns keep changing. As SA learns to
identify the patterns of one type of spam, those no longer make it through,
but the new garbage does. The ones that I now see would take a very dedicated
reader to figure them out: lots of spaces in words, numbers instead of
letters, gross misspellings, and so on. No particular pattern that I see, but
SA figures it out.

   The number that come through now are easily dealt with. If I see the
actual originator is a major ISP or cable provider, I forward it to their
abuse department. Otherwise, I just save it in 'spam-uncaught' for a while.

   Works for me.

I might actually get some spare time, soon, so I should start thinking 
about it. In my current setup, T-Bird goes to Comcast to get my e-mail. 
To use SA, would I have it go to Comcast and get all the e-mail, and 
then point T-Bird at something local to my machine for incoming e-mail?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0602250912360.413@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Earlier this week I installed AXS on my web server to track visitors to the
site. It's great, and the first time I've done this in years.

   Anyway, when I graph the data I see an entry 'IP addr' in the Domains and
Top Level Domains sections, 4 visits recorded. My assumption is that the
domain name is shrouded somehow.

   Doing a reverse DNS lookup tells me that the IP address belongs to
'siliconforestcorvetteclub.com'. Why would this not show up as do other
addresses? It may be a long string for the full domain name graph, but
certainly not too long to be included in the count of all the other dot-coms.

   Any ideas?

Thanks,

Rich

   I'm no expert on this, Dick. Here, SA sits between postfix (which does the
same functions as comcast does for you) and procmail (which delivers
locally). Others on the list are much more knowledgeable and can tell you
just how to set it up quickly, easily, and properly.

   Wrong reference. Looking at the raw log, I see the source. For some reason,
AXS cannot do the reverse DNS lookup, but I can do so manually.

A million reverse DNS lookups start to become expensive.  Most of those
web stats apps (I, personally, use AWStats) have reverse DNS disabled by
default.. but configurably enabled.

So, postfix collects e-mail from your ISP, SA has a look at it and culls 
what it doesn't like. Then, procmail collects what's left and ... ? Do 
you read e-mail with procmail? If that's the case, then for my 
installation I'd set up postfix to collect e-mail from Comcast, and 
configure SA to get the mail from postfix, and then point T-bird at ? to 
get what's left. Sounds like it's probably just a little more complex 
than that, but not too difficult. (Of course, that's what the nuclear 
fusion guys have been saying for the last 50 years or so.)

I suppose I should start by reading up on postfix and procmail.

I assume that since T-bird has separate configurations for sending and 
receiving, I can leave sending alone and just change receiving.

   No. Postfix is the MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) and handles all mail sent to
us. It comes directly here, without passing Go. Fetchmail can be used to
collect mail sent to an ISP or other remote host.

   Postfix does what Comcast's MTA does: it's the destination to which mail is
sent when it's addressed to you. The MTA then hands mail off to the local
delivery agent, procmail here. Procmail sends it to SA before dumping it as
spam or sorting it into the proper local mailbox.

> Do you read e-mail with procmail?

   I read mail with pine; my fiancee uses Thunderchicken. These are called the
MUA (Mail User Agent).

   Mail can be quite confusing. There are four components:

   1) The one like fetchmail that collects incoming mail from a server (MTA),
These tools specify a remote server, the protocol to use (POP3 or IMAP), the
user(s) name(s), and associated password(s). They act as the bicycle
messengers scooting around downtown Portland.

   2) The "mail server" (in the vernacular), which is the machine hosting the
MTA. I use Postfix, others use exim, qmail, smail, and (in the One True World
According to Bill) Exchange. This component looks at an incoming message and
determines where it needs to go next; like the messager service's dispatcher.
If the mail originates in your node of the Internet, then the MTA determines
where to send it next on its way to its destination. If the message
originates elsewhere and is addressed to you, then the MTA hands it off for
local delivery. In your case, I believe that's at your private mailbox on
Comcast's server somewhere.

   3) The mail delivery agent (MDA) receives incoming mail from the MTA and
puts it in the appropriate local mailbox. In your case, this is all at
Comcast's racks.

   4) The MUA is the mail user agent, what the vernacular calls the "mail
reader." There are many options here: pine, mutt, elm, Sylpheed, Thunderbird,
Kmail, Lookout!, and probably dozens more of which I am blissfully ignorant.

   No, in your case you need to set up SA so it filters what Thunderbird
collects for you from Comcast. Just how this is done I don't know. But, I
know that a lot of folks here do know how to do this.

> I suppose I should start by reading up on postfix and procmail.

   No, read up on SA at their Web site: <http://www.spamassassin.apache.org/>.

   Yup.

   I'm sure that this advice may seem about as useful to you as the advice an
owl once gave to a grasshopper:

   A weary grasshopper had come to the owl for counsel. "Oh, wise one, I
dispair of this constant struggle. I work all day, from Spring through Fall,
just to lay in enough food to barely survive the Winter. How can I get
ahead?"

   The owl blinked and nodded. "I see your problem, and the solution is clear.
You must become a cricket."

   "But why, oh wise one?"

   "The cricket does not waste his time as you do. He eats what he needs,
makes music when he likes, and when the cold weather comes, he crawls into a
snug hole and hibernates. Become a cricket, my son, and your days will be
light and joyful."

   The grasshopper was ecstatic, contemplating his coming good fortune. He
thanked the owl and began to hop happily away. A small doubt struck him,
however, and he turned back.

   "Oh wise one, just one last small thing. Exactly how does one become a
cricket when one starts as a grasshopper?"

   The owl blinked in dismissal. "I have given you the strategy. The details
are up to you."

Rob,

   "Million?" I should be so lucky! Of the 228 visits over the past four days,
146 are from web-crawling bots (73 from MSN alone). Interesting -- to me, at
least -- is that the four failed reverse DNS lookups come from the same
domain, but from two completely different IP address blocks.

While the vast majority of people using these things aren't getting
millions of hits between report generations... they *are* designed to
scale up that high.  :-)

The biggest hit generating sites on my (and three friends') server only
push 12-15K hits per day out the door each.  Even then, though, those
reverse DNS queries take a while if I let them stack up (I update the
awstats hourly for them, though).

This is starting to sound familiar. Now that I think about it, I asked 
this type of question several months ago. (Looks deep into saved 
e-mail...) Sure enough, we had a very similar discussion back in late 
October of last year. You even generated almost the same explanation of 
how e-mail moves about. Russ Johnson said that Fetchmail / SA / T-bird 
can be done, and I allowed as how I'd have to look into it. Well, I'm 
almost to the point of having time for it, so I'll try to leave this 
message somewhere near the top of the stack as a reminder of what I 
already know!

Thanks, again(!), for the advice.

   I believe that AXS does the lookup on each hit. When I look at the raw
database file the domain name is there, along with the IP address. Of course,
I'm only an amateur at this stuff. I think the last time I had visitor
reporting on the site was 1998 or 1999.

   No 'update-pciids' on that Slackware box, owl.

   However, lspci reveals all: the multimedia audio controller is a Cirrus

   Update:

   cs4232 is loaded; it's also in /etc/modules.conf so it should be loaded
upon boot. I've restarted /etc/rc.d/rc.sound. 'aumix' shows the volume at
83%. When I run xmms, there's still no sound.

   What might I have missed after all this?

Thanks,

Rich

   More update:

   Checking the alsa sound wiki's trouble-shooting page, I can confirm that
there is no /proc/asound/. Also, alsaconf tries to find a legacy CS4236 card,
but fails; the CS4232 driver worked on the 600E before.

   /dev/sndstat exits. So does /dev/snd; it contains a mess of file names. I'm
stuck here and looking for some ideas and help. What puzzles me is why
there's no /proc/asound/ on that box since the module is loaded and so is
alsa. Sigh.

Can you give us the full output of lsmod?  Also, check dmesg for
anything sound-related.  But don't post the full output of dmesg, as it
can be a bit too large for mailing lists.

1) There are a lot of slider tabs on aumix - try fiddling with all of them.
2) My laptop has 3 control buttons for sound, one of them mutes the output.
3) BIOS?

Webex should support Linux.  You are probably correct that it was
operator error on the other end.  It's kind of a neat product,
especially for distributed support with computers that are owned by
somebody else.  Here are the requirements for Linux from
http://developers.webex.com/api/jointest/index.php
via google search using the terms: webex requirements linux

It seems the requirements are:
Linux Kernel 2.4+
Java Plug-In 1.4.1 or later
Xfree86
Netscape 7, Mozilla 1.6, or later

This IS a phishing scam.  It takes you to a fake web
site asking you to log into paypal, in a false paypal
window that it generates. Then, it prompts you to
input your credit card information, your cvs # from
the back of the card, and your pin# for atm
withdrawals.  Once you enter this information, it then
forwards you to the login page for paypal and attempts
to enter in the information you entered on the first
page of the Phishing window. 

Yes, its fake.  No, yahoo wont do a thing about it. 
Yes, forward it to the paypal abuse folks, as well as
your friendly local law enforcement officer who
handles internet fraud.

Never thought of them. I assumed that the Clackamas County Sheriff 
wouldn't have the time or budget for something like that, since the site 
is probably nowhere near here. I do send a copy to:

reportphishing at antiphishing.org
and
uce at ftc.gov

but I hadn't thought of adding anyone in state or local law enforcement 
to the list.

Frank,

   I figured that out.

   The "IP addr" entry showed 4 visits, so I looked at the few domains with 4
visits and connected the incorrect dots. It turns out that there were 2
visits from the same domain, but with different IP address blocks. Why those
did not resolve I don't know; whois found them right away.

I used Webex a few times and it worked quite well.
However, I have always used Windows machines with IE 
with Webex.  I'm not sure if I needed to do this or
not.  I did because it was recommended and easier than
trying an alternative.

Ironically, the topic of the Webex meetings were totally
Open Source.

Josh,

Try looking here  http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/.
You can click on the "view by thread" link and search to your hearts 
content.
You can also see things here

Google is your friend. Go to the Google advanced search page, put in 
whatever you want search for, Procmail, for example, and then go down 
near the bottom of the page and enter:

pdxlinux.org

in the box for restricting the search to a specific domain.

You could also just put this into a Google search box:

Procmail site:pdxlinux.org

and get the same result.

Webex and Learnlinc are both cool products for on-line meetings
and classes.  They can significantly reduce the cost of 
corporate meetings and corporate training and as a result
help deliver information when it is needed instead of when
it fits into the budget.

Both of these products have so much potential.

Unfortunately, they are both still too expensive for many of
the things I would like to use them for.  We could really
use a peer2peer OpenSource equivalent to these; and I don't
think one exists.  Maybe gnu-meeting does some of these 
things.  I don't know.  Haven't used it.

OK, "ls" lists the files in a folder. But it doesn't list hidden (._) files. 
I've googled for the past half hour, but nada. How do I amend the ls 
command to make it show all files?

And as a second issue, when does Free Geek have command line 
classes? I probably can't go until after finals the week of 3/15, but 
I'd like to do something formally to improve my knowledge.

Sorry, I missed the second part of your question.  FreeGeek has command 
line classes as part of the build program.  Call them for a schedule.  
They also offer an "adoption class" for the FreekBox program which goes 
through operational aspects of the system and covers lots of handy stuff 
to know.  There's also the PLUG clinics at FreeGeek - a bit less 
structured but lots of Linux knowledge is there.

John,

'man' is your friend.  Spend some time with him and ls is a great one
to start with.

You might also look at 'ls -A'.  This shows all the "dot" files EXCEPT
'.' and '..'

People forget command line options all the time, although typing "ls
-al" or sometimes "ls -lart" are the kinds of things that become
automatic.  When you forget the option you are looking for, you
typically try the --help option to the command to get a quick
summary/reminder of options and what they do.  The --help option
doesn't work for everything, but it is a good default thing to try.
If it is insufficient or doesn't work, try man.

Yes.  Learn to read man pages.  Just squint at them until it makes sense 
(try thinking about how you would express options, arguments, 
opterands, and optional arguments without rich text formatting and the 
<arg> [opt] syntax begins to make sense.)  apropos is a good way to 
find out what you don't know too.

And don't be too proud to admit to the computer that you are helpless.

Isn't that a bit over kill and very complex?  Shouldn't we just have our 
own search tools?  I knew we had one before.  I'll check out the other 
links.  Personally I think any site worth having that is for a community 
knowledge should have a search dialog.  Maybe something we could consider. 

Thanks for the ideas though.

Subject: [PLUG] SATA with Linux RAID
Message-ID: <4402C12F.5000806@emediatedesigns.com>

Well it has been a busy day of server repairs and now a new system 
install that is giving me a headache.  Well not a headache but is 
bothering me beyond my willingness to continue without some expert 
advice.  Heck I'd settle for some little advice. 

So, I bought all new parts for a server running 3 SATA drives to make a 
RAID 5 system.  This was going to be a software raid with CentOS 4.2.  
The install went well.  It found the drives and installed a RAID 
system.  I actually installed about 3 times now.  Tried LVM on RAID 5 
with RAID 1 for /boot.  That didn't work so I rebuilt with RAID 5 and 
RAID 1 only and that didn't work.  What I'm seeing is that when I reboot 
I only get a flashing cursor after it gets past POST.   I thought since 
the installer recognized the hard drives and the BIOS has an option to 
boot to the 3rd IDE Master (SATA drives) that I'd be fine.  Well, it 
turns out that Linux or CentOS is looking for something a bit different. 

So my questions would be:

1. Do you know what would cause this behavior
2. Is there a 4 Channel SATA Motherboard that others have used to make a 
bootable RAID install of LINUX that they would recommend?
3. Is there an inexpensive 4 channel SATA card that I could buy that 
would work? 


Thanks for any suggestions.  I've been reading all over the Web for the 
last 5 hours and no concrete solutions so far. 

Josh

The boot loader isn't working. Likely it wasn't installed, or perhaps
some bit of weird installation killed it. LILO? GRUB? Do you need to
manually install the loader?

Just thought of that and ran the rescue disk and it mounted the system 
just fine.  So, yep the boot loader is screwed.  It is grub.  How do I 
go about finding out what is wrong or do I just need to reinstall the 
boot loader? 

Thanks,

Also wondering now if Grub doesn't have the SATA_ild driver to see the 
Hard Drives.  That or from what I read it is not in the MBR.  Do think 
that is correct?

Someday we may all hate Google for what it has become and our dependency on
it.  That day isn't here yet.  A Google search for 
   [TERM]... [site:SITENAME]

Is fast and works for all publically visible pages.  Try comparing the results
of a Google search with those you find on many site's internal search engines. 
In many cases Google does a far better job.

Two tips for reading man pages:

Skim - just skim through the thing with an intent of looking for stuff that's
interesting.  Ignore everything that's of no interest.  Just look for stuff
that may be useful someday so you can remember it's in the man page when you
need it.

The / key - you can search through the man page by using the / key and then
the n (for next) to find a word of interest.

   man ls

   Then look at the options. About line 103 you'll find your answer. That's
why there are man pages.

I'm still in the category of folk for whom man pages make sense only 
part of the time, but I'm getting better. One of my gripes about man 
pages was not being able to search them. I suspect this would be second 
nature to died in the wool command line users, but for those of us who 
aren't forced to use it, and get most of what we want done with GUI 
tools, searching by using / is one of those things that is easy to 
forget about -- well, for me it was, anyway.

So, thanks for reminding me about / and how it can be used in more than 
just vi.

I'm trying to program Bind 9 which comes with Fedora Core 1 to
not forward any requests to Internet name servers.  So far, I've
tried commenting out the hints section of named.conf.  I'm still
seeing FORWARD requests to port 53 on this nameserver's Internet 
gateway.  How do you disable direct to Internet queries in 
Bind 9?  How does a bind 9 server know where the Internet 
nameservers are if the hints section of named.conf is 
commented out?

If anyone is wondering why there's an Internet gateway, I need
to allow a specific remote client to come in.  A secure tunnel
is properly in order, but that's another topic ;-)

The perhaps it would help you to learn that you can search the current
page in Firefox using the same key.  Unfortunately, find-next is
CTRL-G instead of 'n', but at least you can still use the same key for
the initial search.

Okay, I give up.  I'm on page three of the Google search and still can't
figure out what HWOps is.  I figure it must be a blindingly obvious acronym
or a cultural reference that disqualifies most people over the age of 40.

Bind knows about the root servers because they are listed in named.ca. For me, that's at /var/bind/named.ca but may be elsewhere for FC1. It uses them to resolve any domains it can't answer locally, that's it's purpose in life.

I wouldn't advise removing them. If you need to have a local-hosts-only resolver, I suggest either dnsmasq or dnrd. Both have suitable configuration options for doing what you want. Bind does not.

If you must disable internet queries from bind, remove the root nameservers, but be aware that bind may not start or perform as expected and will definitely complain to your log files endlessly.

HTH,
Aaron

103?  It's closer to line 11 for me.

Thanks to all for the suggestions -- but!

To everyone who exhorts me to read man pages, we've already 
discussed that a while back. Once in a while I can actually 
understand parts of them now. But I still don't have any idea what 
an "argument" is. (OK, I do know what it is in Semantics, but that's 
not a computer meaning.) Nor do I know what an "operand" is, or 
why I should care to know.

But having sat in on part of one of Aj's classes at Free Geek where 
she discussed some rudimentary command line things, I 
discovered that it helped a great deal. For some reason, it sticks 
when I get it in a classroom. Plus it's more efficient -- if I didn't 
understand I can just say so, instead of spending half an hour 
googling around for wading through man pages looking for a better 
explanation. There's also the group dynamic of a classroom setting 
that makes learning more effective.

So back to the original question. Nothing on freegeek.org about 
classes. So how do I find out when Free Geek has command line 
classes?

This is a day for learning basics!

I get links to two separate files,

man:/usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz

and

man:/usr/share/man/man1p/ls.1p.gz

The first one looks just like the man pages I'm used to seeing from the 
command line. The second one describes what is going on in much more 
detail. Now that I know it's there, it's probably the version I'll end 
up referring to when I want to learn what's going on. For me, the usual 
man pages are better suited for reminding me what the right letter is 
for a certain option, etc. Most of the time, when I need man, I need 
what's in the wordier version.

Thanks for the tip!

Subject: [PLUG] firewall
Message-ID: <44035296.8040707@verizon.net>

The Ubuntu faq states:


        Does Ubuntu come with a firewall installed?

Since Ubuntu doesn't run any daemons that listen to the outside world by 
default (the postfix install only listens on localhost) there's no need 
for a default firewall.

The rationale is that if a user's got a need for installing a 
world-facing daemon, they'll be aware that they should configure a 
firewall/ACL for it too.

Does this mean that I don't really need the firewall in the Actiontec 
DSL modem turned on?  What daemons that listen to the outside world 
might I have turned on in my experimentation with Ubuntu 5.10?

The only thing I am doing with this box at this time is email and 
browsing the Internet, and I have no WinDoze box running at this time.

While on the subject of man pages, don't forget our old friend "man -k"
If you have a hint that there may be a command that does what you want, 
sometimes this can help you find it.  For instance, to format a disk one 
could enter "man -k disk" , but then you get back the phone book,  Maybe 
better to try "man -k disk | grep format".

Sometimes saves me a bunch of googling

Bruce,

I was really surprised when I saw that Ubuntu didn't implement a
firewall on install.  Even if the only service listening to ports
is openssh we still firewall all our machines whether or not they're
exposed to the internet.  Better safe than sorry.

You're going to find life with Linux a lot easier if you stop fighting
it.  Why should you care to know?  Because these are critical words in
the answer to your question.  If you're not going to bother looking them
up or caring to know, why should we bother or care to answer you?
Really, we're here to help, but we won't bait your hook for you.

Okay, I'll dangle the worm a little closer:

Do you learn other languages without learning vocabulary one word at a

   No. It means take every precaution available to you to keep out those you
don't want in your system(s). Linux boxes can be rooted, too. Take a gander
at the list archives for Bill Thoen's agonizing experiences with cracked
linux boxes.

   Firewall. Always.

Technically, they are correct that no open ports means no point of attack. But 
it's shortsighted to not include a firewall-builder tool as part of the 
installer- no one sticks to the default install. Things change, mistakes 
happen. Plus, even if your application-level security is perfect, why have 
all the automated attacks that infest the internet pounding on your machine 
anyway? Layered defenses are smart. In this case the Ubuntu devs are not 
being smart.

This might help, if you're thinking of looking around for a nice firewall 
builder:

The easiest and most effective (restrictive) firewall config for a
Ubuntu desktop is done as shown:

(case sensitive)

sudo su
iptables -P FORWARD DROP
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -A INPUT -p ALL -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p ALL -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT


Unfortunately, this will only stick for the current session and when
you reboot or shutdown the firewall configuration will be gone.  To
get around this you must do the following:

mkdir -p /var/lib/iptables
cd /usr/share/doc/iptables/examples
gunzip oldinitscript.gz
cp oldinitscript /etc/init.d/iptables
chmod 755 /etc/init.d/iptables
cd /etc/rc2.d
ln -s ../init.d/iptables S99iptables
/etc/init.d/iptables save active


Verify that the iptables config has been saved by checking for the
file "active" in /var/lib/iptables

If you require your firewall config to allow any inbound connections
then just add them in using "iptables -A INPUT".

I guess that is where it doesn't work so well.  I tend to design web 
pages that are back with Databases and such you can't really mine them.  
So, a local search engine is better.  Perhaps in this case it is not but 
that other link to
http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.portland
Worked really well.

That's factually correct.  It's also wrong.

A properly configured firewall not only controlls what comes in, but what goes
out.   Consider the trojaned windows system functioning as a spambot.  If it had a
firewall restricting SMTP connections to configured mail relays it couldn't spam.

This assumes the user realizes the risks and __remembers__ to do the firewall/acl
thing.

Leave it on.  An added layer of protection is a good thing.

What daemons might you have turned on?  web, database, mail ... who knows?  But
you can find out.

run:  `netstat -nt` and look for the word LISTEN.  If it's there you're running
something.


I think the Ubuntu stance on this issue is terrible.  netfilter is built into the
kernel.  iptables is available to use and there are many tools available to help
build rule sets.

Wil,

I looked at that page and it blew right past me.  I guess the UI has a 
little work.  I expected it to be on this page:
http://lists.pdxlinux.org/mailman/listinfo
or
http://lists.pdxlinux.org/pipermail/plug/

Now that you asked me to look for it I see it.  I "Skimmed" over that 
page and saw just how to sign up and such.  But you are right.  It is 
right there.  Could you make it Red and Flashing for me. ;-) 

Thanks,

Josh

Why not?  If you can crawl links and retrieve pages you can index them.
Google et.al. don't care what the back end storage is.

Hopefully you're building in reasonable search capabilities.

Actually, yes. If we learned languages one word at a time we'd be 
still grunting and pointing. Humans don't live long enough to learn 
natural languages that way.

But as to me personally, I'm into linguistics, not foreign languages. 
Linguists don't learn languages. We study them.

And none of this has anything to do with learning the command 
line, which is not a natural language in the first place.

As for Free Geek command line classes, I guess I'll find out 
another way. A while back someone invented a new device to 
communicate in real time. It's called a telephone.

But stay tuned. The dumb-ass n00b has yet more questions to 
annoy his seniors with. :)

I'm assuming there is a script somewhere which makes all the 
things happen when I boot my computer, right? What is it? Is there 
a place in it where I can enter a command to run a program on 
booting the computer? Or have I missed the point completely? 
(And please, I can't read the man page because I don't know what 
it's called yet.)

The reason is that I just found Klipper, a cool little app that solves

On most Linux systems you will find all the startup stuff in /etc/rc.d
If you want to add your own stuff, the easiest place to put your startup 
script(s) is in
/etc/rc.d/rc.local

If you are using Gnome, go to Preferences->More Preferences->Sessions
and select the Startup Settings tab.  You can add things there.
(Unfortunately you cannot define what screen it starts up on.)

It's not "a" script.  It's several scripts. 
http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/From-PowerUp-To-Bash-Prompt-HOWTO.html
is a nice place to start.

The standard place to store scripts to run on bootup, on places that use the
SYSV init system, is /etc/rc.local.  I notice it doesn't exist on my debian
based systems ...

It's called init.  `apropos init` will give you lots of man page choices.

Perhaps what you want to do is add it to the task bar?  
Right click on task bar, wander through the menus until you find Add App...

Are you using the kde desktop?  Mine has just always been there.  
There's an applet called "system tray" that it lives in.

True, but how often do folks bother to firewall what is coming out? If
this was to become prevalent, wouldn't the crackers simply adjust their
rootkit so it flushed all firewall rules? I wouldn't be surprised to
learn they're already doing this since it is easy and rectifies problems
with their malware.

Firewalling is quite helpful to protect machines behind you, but for
localhost, far better to kill the daemons since that frees up processor
and memory as well.

Absolutely nothing. Oh, you also need -a (`netstat -ant`), at which point
there are things that are supposed to be there. Of crucial note, things
runnng on 127.0.0.1 or ::1 (localhost) are harmless as they can't be
gotten to.

Perhaps, but no worse than any other distribution or OS. I'd guess
getting rid of the daemons is a *much* more significant step than
enabling firewall support. As above, it would be quite easy for a rootkit
to turn that off.

Mike,

   I believe that Debian and it children, as well as Slackware, use the
BSD-style init scripts. They are in /etc/rc.d/rc.<whatever>.

I've been reading this thread with interest, not that I have 
understood most of it. At home I have Comcast cable and my 
ethernet is behind a router, which does not have a firewall. My 
Windows 2000 desktop has Sygate personal firewall, in which I 
have blocked everything from going out except specific programs, 
e.g., Firefox, etc., although even Internet Explorer is blocked. The 
Ubuntu-64 Breezy laptop also connects the same way, through the 
ethernet and router to the modem. I did recently install Firestarter, 
although I did nothing to its configuration. I also connect the laptop 
at PSU and occasionally at other wifi spots. So far I have not had a 
problem with either computer (major knocking on wood, salt over 
shoulder and crossed fingers).

The point I want to make is that there are a lot of us n00bies out 
here running Linux without much knowledge of what we are doing 
with respect to firewalls. I know I wish I knew more about the 
subject, but I fear the time it would take to learn it on my own 
would be prohibitive. Might it be possible to have firewalls be a 
Clinic topic some day? Or a class at Free Geek? Or something?

No KDE here, although I have a lot of KDE apps installed. I use 
Gnome. It's just an esthetics choice. KDE looks too much like a 
circus.

   OK. On Slackware there's /etc/rc.d/rc.M (for multiuser mode),
/etc/rc.d/rc.S (for single-user mode), /etc/rc.d/rc.0, .../rc.6, .../rc.K,
and all the rest. I had to add rc0.d through rc6.d to get VMware to work.

 My recommendation for noobs, until they get the hang of iptables, is to use 
one of those little broadband routers from D-Link and Linksys and the like. 
You can find them for less than $50, and they do a good job for a home 
network. You're up and running, protected, and learning basic concepts. 
They're small and don't use much power. I like a standalone firewall/router 
because it stops the junk before it bogs down your LAN.

Hi David,

Could you help me get the word out that
LinuxFest Northwest 2006 is happening on
Apr. 29th this year in Bellingham, at BTC?

FYI, so far we have SuSE/Novell, Oracle, IBM, RedHat,
Tim Bray (father of XML), and many many others
presenting this year. (Personally I think this year will be the
"Mother of all LinuxFests".)

We still have open slots for tables and speakers.

People can register for table space or speaking slots at:

www.linuxfestnorthwest.org

Also, do you have any suggestions to help me get to the word out?

Thanks,

Bill

And once they get a good understanding of Linux, they can put OpenWrt on
it.  :-)

You would, if you were trying to start something on *boot* (which is
what you asked, and what all the reference to init scripts and rc* in
the responses were about).  However, since what you want is to start
something on *login*, you can just use the session stuff for Gnome or
KDE, whichever you're using.

For a Windows person the init scripts match the services (which are
detached from a login session), and the sessions match the startup
folder (and login scripts, and several registry keys, and any other
places to hide troja^H^H^H^H^Hstartup programs).

That's all fine and dandy for n00bs who only have a system connected
to their home LAN, but doesn't solve the issue for n00bs who use their
system elsewhere, like a Wi-Fi hotspot, or campus LAN, or a friends
house who is even more clueless about network security.  Those people
need a host-based firewall, and need to be able to configure it in a
mostly basic way.  Iptables is too complicated in it's raw form, as
are some of the good firewall wrappers such as Shorewall.

I still think the RedHat/Fedora host-based firewall is a good options
for standard workstations/home systems, and anyone who needs more
complicated options should uninstall it and figure out one of the more
complicated ones.

You could still edit a script file!

Generally, and I know with KDE (I haven't even bothered logging in with
GNOME beyond the intial "oh my god, the default is GNOME *logout*"
moment) that the file '.xsession' is run before your X Session starts.

This, by the way, is an EXCELLENT place to put the ssh-add and imwheel
commands. ;)

Subject: [PLUG] St00pid n00bie documentation question
Message-ID: <44042809.5060307@writemoore.net>

Following up on the interesting, educational and entertaining thread 
started by John Jordan, I have a somewhat related and equally st00pid 
n00b question related to non-man documentation:  What's the best way to 
read it?

I tried accessing it with w3m, but the results weren't what I expected 
-- kind of a two column list of what looked like html files, but not the 
contents of those files, which is what I want to read.  I also tried, in 
Firefox, "file:///usr/share/doc/..." but that didn't work right either. 
  (Although, I was having a problem with FF at the time ... maybe I 
should try it again.)  Can anyone offer any suggestions as to how they 
access these docs?

I use Debian GNU/Linux as my OS, Openbox as my WM, Firefox and w3m as 
web browsers, vim and gedit for text editing.  I also have Gnome 
installed (the full gnome-desktop-environment package, for those who use 
Debian and know what that means.)  So I probably have what I need, if I 
only knew how to use it.  KDE-oriented suggestions wouldn't be very 
helpful for me.

BTW, I'm Michael ... this is my first post to the list ... I've been 
lurking for a few days.  I moved to Portland not long ago (though I went 
to high school in Hillsboro many years ago, so I'm not strictly speaking 
new to the NW) and have not yet been to any PLUG events, but I was very 
glad to find that there is a PLUG.

That's excellent advice.  It is simple to implement and provides perimeter security.

HWOps ?

While I'm sure the thread could go on this way for days, can somebody
tell me what this acronym actually means at Google?  I might invite

Carla's advice is good, but Jason's point is what worries me. And at 
home I have a router, but I know it has no firewall. And it took me 
the better part of a day to figure out how to set it up, and I have 
since forgotten how I did it. It works, and I'd rather not go buy one 
with a firewall and spend another day getting it installed and 
working. These things are easy for you guys who work with them 
all the time, but I have to puzzle out the documentation and poke 
at stuff a lot before I get it going.

I suspect the only reason my Linux laptop has not been hit with 
something while away from home is because there are few evil 
things targeting Linux compared to Windows. I connect all the time 
at PSU, but I have no idea if pub.net gives me any security. At the 
Clinic I connected af Free Geek, but again, I have no idea if I was 
behind something secure. And what if I connect at a Starbucks? I 
just know nothing about these things, how they work, or what I 
should do to be protected. But it does seem to me that a software 
firewall on my computer is what I need.

If your home router provides your systems behind the router with private
IP addresses and does not route traffic destined for your public IP
address directly to your systems with private IP addresses, then it
does, in fact, act as a kind of firewall.

Hello all:
I am interested in having my ISP host a web site for my small business. 
I am a C / C++ programmer that specializes in industrial automation, but 
I know nothing about web site development.

It seems reasonable to me that I should be able to code and test my web 
site on one of my Linux systems and when it is complete, sign the 
agreement with my ISP (Pacifier) to have them serve up the pages. Is 
this reasonable?

If you knew nothing about web development, where would you start? What 
would you read? What tools would you use?

Shouldn't we make a distinction between init scripts and GUI tools that
depend on X Windows?  I'm thinking writing an init.d script for a GUI tool
will fail if X isn't started.  The place for that might be ~/.xinitrc, which
is the script that typically run with the startx command.

Wayne,

   I recommend Eric Meyers' books on CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and a
current book on HTML.

   Two approaches to take: 1) Create your own from scratch using a text editor
(or, GUI HTML editor if that's your proclivity), and 2) find a web site you
like, view the page source (ctrl-u in firefox), then download the code and
use it as the basis for your own.

   Most important: spend time thinking about what you want to communicate. who
you are trying to reach, and what image you want to project.

Generally, I just cd into /usr/share/doc/<package> and look at files
with ls & less, or emacs.

I don't *think* there is any standard format or index in there, but I
could certianly be wrong.

There is something in /usr/share/doc-base, it seems, but that looks
horribly incomplete (at least on the box I'm at now).

That all depends on what you want your site to do.  If it's just static
content, it'll work almost anywhere, and any hosting service will work.  If
your site has to "think", then you'll want to select an appropriate
server-side technology.  I write Java servlets and JSP, but there are many
options.  You may find PHP easier to learn, and probably more hosting shops
will support it.

Once you've selected a platform (HTML version, server-side
scripting/programming language, possibly a database), you'll find lots of
online documentation.  And if you're developing in linux, JEdit is a good
editor that runs on Java.

Wayne,

 Also consider the update process, content management, etc. when you
choose technologies.  It may be worthwhile to just build a custom skin
for a CMS or a wiki and use that. (Drupal and mediawiki come to mind).
 (the Firefox page is a mediawiki instance, IIRC).

Consider pages.google.com, for example.  Free hosting, unlimited bandwidth,
newbie guides...  basically the "free hosting killer" that just got rolled

That makes sense to me. This way you don't have to worry about
constantly ftp'ing your changes.  That can be bothersome.

For reading check out the world wide web consortium
(http://www.w3.org/). The tools I use are vim (great for editing
remotely) and bluefish (great for editing locally). 

Take the easy way out. View the source of whatever web site(s) you find
attractive, save it and edit to fill your needs.

One more thing to consider is getting a catchy domain name and making 
sure that your ISP will support pointing that name at your site on their 
server.  You don't want your site to be something like:
www.pacifier.com/freewebhosting/userstuff/~Jason/index.html  - no one 
would ever find it.  You want something like www.consultingbyjason.com 
or whatever and have that point at the site on pacifier.

Unless you want to be a web developer then forget the books.  Use a 
program like NVU and be done with it.  It's a WYSIWYG editor and should 
be easy enough to use.  Most small company sites that I do end up being 
an online business card and rarely see updates.  This sort of thing 
would be great for NVU.

Now if you see many pages and constant updating, then I would choose a 
Content Management System (CMS) like Mambo, or if you prefer, learn html 
and get the books.  Check your ISP to see if it supports things like 
Mambo though.  CMS's are like a blank website in a box, though they can 
require a bit of setup.

If you want a truly professional looking site, then consider hiring someone.

   Allow me to disagree. I've had my business web site up since 1998. I'm far
from a web developer. But, the site is important to us and I try to update it
now and then. With a bit of reading and thinking it's quite easy to create a
standards-compliant site that is highly individualized and distinctive.

   Take a look at some of the thrown-together web sites out there and think
what they suggest about the business. Like a business card, dress when
meeting prospective (and actual) clients, and attitude, our web sites are a
powerful first impression. It's worth the time and effort -- for many of us,
anyway -- to try for the best first impression we can create.

   NVU wasn't ready for prime time the last I looked. I use emacs.

   What I did was create several major divisions: masthead, middle, footer,
and menu system. Each sits in its own file on disk. When I want to create a
new page I import them and the page is done. Real Soon Now I'll re-learn how
to keep them separate and pull them in on the fly. Then I can change one part
and it's automatically reflected in all pages.

And here I'll recommend good ol' SSI, which is a simple apache mod.  I've
used that on a few sites that shared pages elements but were essentially
static content.  You just have to add a line to your apache config' and to
learn one or two directives for including partial HTML files.  A hammer for
your nail, sir.

Jason,

   Thank you. I think that's what I had used before.

   I neglected the site for years; it was barely usable html-4.0, tables, and
a mess. Early last year I spent one day in research, another in design, and
two days creating a whole new site. It's just been revised in content, but I
like the look. However, I did just receive an e-mail suggesting that I
increase the default font size. Perhaps IE doesn't let one use ctrl-+?

Internet Exploder does not use ctrl + - or much of anything else.

Frank,

   Well, ... I'm not surprised.

   Is there a convention for basic font size on Web pages for viewers with
40+-year-old eyes stuck with IE?

Thanks,

Rich

Not sure if there is a convention - I usually use a 12 or 14 depending 
on context.  But then, what do I know?   Of course, it all depends on 
the viewer's screen resolution.

Good point.  I use Joker.com, which will redirect websites and forward
mail for your domain, all for pretty cheap.  Nice folks.

As for the website, think about what you want it to do, start with a
simple static page written in whatever HTML you can figure out.  You can
open the HTML file directly in your web browser and see what it does,
then upload it to your regular ISP's web-hosting area.

Then you can get fancier from there.

Yes, there is.  In a nutshell, you should not be setting the font size.
If you leave it alone, then the font will display in whatever size the
user has configured their browser to use, which will be, presumably,
one that they can actually read with their eyesight and screen resolution.

Good point, but I've seen that approach cause the view to become 
scrambled.  Especially when the browser  defaults are messed with by 
someone who, well - you know . . an induhvidual.

There is no such thing. Different browsers, or different settings will
cause HTML to be rendered differently. In fact if you can possibly avoid
it, you really shouldn't be overriding the browsers defaults. Sometimes
they're customized heavily, of note people with poor eyesight will use
larger fonts and colors with more contrast, if you override you may piss
people off.

All too often keeping things simple is best. Are you trying to look
snazzy, or are you trying to get information across?

That is why you use CSS.  If used properly, someone who has trouble
with the design you created can simply turn off the CSS and get the
boring but easy to read browser defaults.

Yes.  They are not mutually exclusive.

Specify font sizes in em rather than px.  This allows a readers browser
configuration to determine the default font scaling.

Aside from the issue of 40+ IE users, the desirable font size differs from display
to display.  Consider the differences between:

  * a 21" CRT
  * a 17" LCD
  * an 11" laptop
  * a PDA
  * a cell phone

I was pleasantly surprised when people at a randonneuring event thanked me for
making the Oregon Randonneurs site readable on their PDAs.  I hadn't done anything
special - aside from going light on the graphics and specifying all font sizes in
em units.

Ali,

   I had totally forgotten that I had a font-size specified in the body
section of the css file. That's now commented out. I see no difference here,
perhaps others can.

Thanks,

   Thank you. I changed it to em units and it is larger. Helps greatly to save
the modified file before putting it on the server.

   Hee-hee! Tricked you all. I hadn't saved the modified file before putting
it up. Mea culpa! Now the base size is 0.9 em and it is noticably larger.

Thanks all,

That's better.  Though that font is just hard on the eyes for me.  And 
when it gets italicized it's still almost illegible.

Problem is there might be 7 or perhaps 8 people world-wide that know how
to do that and have actually done it.. at least in my experience.  YMMV.

I've done it, although I can't think of an example off the top of my

It's tough.  In Firefox, View->Page Style->No Style.  In IE,
Tools->Internet Options->Accessibility->turn on all the formatting
"Ignore" options.

Anyway, use the relative sizes for fonts, then the increase/decrease
font size functionality will work.

It is a celeron board, has an onboard video card.

I tried to set up my friend's computer with 
Fedora Core 3, can't get the X Windows resolution 
above 640x480.  I suspect that the video card may 
be making the system unstable.  

I've tried running vmware and have had a couple 
instances of the system resetting for no apparent 
reason.  Wondering if problem with the design of 
the onboard video card and if replacing that card 
with an addon will help?  I've also noticed that
iptraf doesn't work correctly in a virtual 
terminal on this system.

Has anyone else experienced trouble using this board
with Fedora Core 3?

I didn't know vim would read *.gz files.  I thought if they were 
compressed like that you needed something other than a text editor like 
emacs or vi(m).  Also, I did try it again with Firefox for the html 
files (like: file:///usr/share/doc/debian/FAQ/index.html), and this time 
it worked.  I don't know why I had a problem before, maybe I did 
something wrong.

I have a bunch of text files in there, most of which seem just to 
reference other files.  I don't quite get what purpose this is supposed 
to serve.

Methinks I need to get my hands on that Martin Krafft book about Debian 
that came out recently.

If you're using firefox, you can install the Read Easily extension:

https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=1224&application=firefox

Then Ctrl-Shift-Z will toggle the styles on and off.

Oh, I totally do!

I am printing to a Laserjet 5SiMx and to a Laserjet 8000 DN. Both are pretty well decked out with 2000 sheet bottom tray, duplexers, and the 8000 has a 3000 sheet stacker. I am printing from Ubuntu-64 Breezy.

The problem is that options available on the printer do not appear in the print dialog boxes. Now, this *may* be a problem of the application rather than the driver. But I don't know enough about how these things are supposed to work to be able to figure out the answer to that question. However, I can say that printing from Adobe Reader 7.0 is the worst. I can't even select the number of copies, let alone duplexing, paper trays, or anything else. Totally pathetic. OpenOffice.org is much better, but still doesn't know about input and output trays or any of the dozens of other options that are available when I print from Windows 2000 -- and I mean from *any* Windows 2000 app I get the same full list of options.

Si I don't know if the problem is the driver, Linux, the app, or an evil spirit. Do you know anything about these issues?

vim might -- it does on my system.  If not, they are just gzipped (and
most certianly text files) so, 'zcat | less' will work.

Neither did I, but I just now attempted to open a few gzip'd text
files with vim and it worked just fine. You learn something new every
day!  Previously I used to "gunzip -c happyfuncompressedfile.gz | less",
which would accomplish something similar.

Hot damn. Two new somethings learned in one day! I'll never

They generally don't run Linux or anything open source as far 
as I know.  If anything, I question the use of these as security 
devices.  

In all the talk about firewalling, only packet 
filtering is apparently being considered.  Is TCP/IP the only 
open standard networking protocol that a home network can be 
built on?  The most effective firewalls do content 
based filtering which cannot happen at the packet layer.  

I hear Novell IPX is a good protocol, but it's hardly a free 
one and I doubt it's ubiquitous.  Sadly Novell Netware appears
to be going to IP networking offering no advantage anymore.  

With my own confusion about ports, flags, and addressing, it 
seems that IP networking needs a lot of work.  Supposedly IPv6 
is out, but doesn't IPv6 require new hardware?  It appears with 
IPv6 that there are security problems, at least with Bind 9 
aleady.

A smart person would figure out how to make yesterdays computer,
the Pentium, fit into a router sized box and run Linux...  With
flash rams exceeding a gigabyte, this shouldn't be too hard.
Realistically though, you may want to use a Linux system based 
on the 2.2 kernel.  You don't need everything that 2.6 supports
to run an old Pentium or 486 computer.  Firewall appliances, to
be the most effective, shouldn't be proprietary inside.  If you
are talking about firewalling seriously, my experience says 
that the ultimate level of effectiveness calls for filtering
of data at the application layer in addition to the packet
layer.  A good firewall will let you know not only what is being
blocked, but also what is going through.  A good firewall should
be adaptive.  Admittedly from hints about what this means
looking at http://grc.com/, I don't know how to create one that is.
A good firewall builder knows the weaknesses of his/her IP network
and can adapt to attacks that take advantage of them in real
time.  A good firewall is one that changes dynamically
in real time based on current network conditions.  

A firewall, traditionally, was anything that kept fire from spreading
from one area to another.  It means something similar in the computer
world encompassing far more than the subject of IP packet filtering.

An open source protocol that is specifically for LANS
with native Linux support might help noobies.  I seriously 
question the need for IP networking in a small network.  
Does it really make sense to learn about subnetting etc. 
for just a couple of computers?  How many people understand 
what all the ports and flags are in IP networking?  Has 
anyone gotten lost trying to look at an explanation of 
IPv4 headers?  Where is the documentation for a newbie 
Linux admin to understand IP networking thoroughly?  If 
IP networking is not appropriate for setting up a small 
secure LAN quickly, what alternatives are there?

Linux seems to be most popular on IA32 and I guess Itanium
architecture as well now.  These aren't necessarily the best 
computer lines for building small reliable applicances.  
Something that runs cooler and that is optimized for IO is 
a better choice than say a Pentium or any of it's grand 
nephews.  A 486 should work without mechanical cooling, but 
it will still get awfully hot.  I'd love to see someone
build a miniature dual 486 DX-100 that will fit into a box 
the size of a DSS8+ Dlink switch and boot off of a 1 gig or 
larger usb2 thumb drive, as long as it doesn't need fans.
It should be headless and have 8 built-in network cards. 
Talk about a switch, smart router, etc.  Here's something
you could take with you to firewall a small network 
quickly, especially if you can add a battery pack to it.
