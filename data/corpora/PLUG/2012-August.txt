Subject: [PLUG] Where a program stores temporary files
Message-ID: <50198662.2040505@comcast.net>

I use a program called transcribe. It's a python program for playing 
back audio files for transcription purposes. The company from which I 
get assignments requires that I delete the audio files when I've 
finished the work, since the material is usually confidential. I do this 
by deleting the audio file from the directory in which I had stored it, 
and then deleting it from the Trash folder.

Sometimes this program (transcribe) gets confused. I start playing a new 
audio file, and I hear an old one along with the one. I discovered that 
when I closed transcribe "yesterday" the program did not completely 
quit. I use ps ax | grep transcribe and discover three entries (one of 
which is the grep process). So, I shut down the instance of transcribe I 
can see, and then use kill to shut down the other instance. Running ps 
ax | grep transcribe returns the reference to itself.

My question relates to the audio source for the errant instance of 
transcribe.

How do I go about locating that file? Was it even a file, or was it 
buffered in memory somewhere, and killing the instance removed it?

This is mostly so I can affirm that I have deleted the audio completely 
from my computer.

Thanks for any clues.

Dick Steffens

it is very possible it was all in memory. /tmp is a popular place for
programs to store temporary files (which are not always deleted). if you're
interested, you can also dig in by using tools like strace and /proc.

use ps to find the pid of the transcription program. then, in a terminal,
do:

ls -la /proc/(pid goes here)/fd

that should give you a list of the files currently open by that process.

I see some interesting possibilities in /tmp. IIRC, transcribe uses 
pulse audio. There are two directories in /tmp that start with pulse-. 
When I have some time I'll dig into them. One of them is locked. I also 
see some files whose names I recognize. It doesn't make sense for at 
least one of them to be there. It's locked. It's an rtf file that opens 
with Wine Wordpad. I know where the original copy of that file is. No 
idea why this one would be here and be locked. Maybe a Wine thing. But, 
other than the two pulse- directories, nothing obviously related to a 
sound file.

In /proc, I see mostly pipes and sockets. I also see inotify, /dev/nul, 
/home/rsteff.xsession-errors twice, and the file on which I am currently 
working.

Next time I have an issue with multiple files playing back at the same 
time, I'll try this again and see what's different.

Thanks.

Dick,

You might try starting your transcription program with strace, to
see what files the program normally opens.  Something like this:

    $ strace -e trace=file transcribe [options]

strace will spew a lot of stuff to the terminal, and it can be a
pain to wade through.  But there are times when it's invaluable.
You'll probably want to consult the man page for strace(1) for all
the gory details.

Hope this helps.  If not, remember that it's worth every penny you
paid for it.  :-)  (Yes, I'm in a strange mood today.  Moo.)

lsof is another option.  It should tell you what files each process
has open.

Wow, Mike - what a great offer. Thank you so much. I expect to take my first LPI exam when I finish up my CCNA in September. I'll be sure to keep you updated.

Again, thanks so much. I've read a lot of technical books in the last year and I've never had an author make that offer.

Dear Nathan, Eamonn, 

Assuming the indulgence of the group, you're welcome to ask questions
here (or privately by email) if you run into book related issues.
(Nathan, your lab sounds fine.)

Or isn't possible that it is still on the disk temporarily?  If a 
process still has the file open, even if you remove it doesn't it keep 
the data around until all the inode references are freed? That would 
mean that killing the last of the processes found using lsof, for 
instance, should finally remove the file. Or am I still living in the 
last century?

I tried for quite some time to actually take the RHCSA exam in Seattle
and had it cancelled three times for low enrollment. Major bummer...
Finally flew to San Francisco to take it as "guaranteed to run" exam.

I found that the exam objectives do in fact cover exactly what you
need to be able to do. If you're comfortable with doing those things,
you're in pretty good shape:
http://www.redhat.com/training/courses/ex200/examobjective

During the exam you have access to any resources normally installed,
so knowing where to find documentation (man pages, READMEs, etc) can
be helpful.

Good luck!

while this is true, it does not particularly impact the specific scenario
laid out by the original poster. in the context of "not keeping data
around" due to privacy or confidentiality concerns, the data can be
considered "deleted" just by removing the reference to it in the file
system (rm). If we were discussing issues related to disk space usage or
another applicable topic, this detail would become a factor.

If the data were extraordinarily sensitive, or if there was a serious
threat of compromise, we could be more aggressive about wiping the data
away. Even after the last process to hold an open file handle on a file
closes that handle, the data is still on the disk until that spot on the
disk has new data written to it by some future process.

The glass is half full of air, half full of water, therefore, the
glass is completely full.

True, once you've deleted the target file, you can make certain it's
no longer recoverable by using scrub or another disk wiping package. I
use scrub v2.2 occasionally on my /home partition to obliterate all
deleted files with a one-line script called scrubit, as follows:

#!/bin/sh
scrub -XS /home/scratch && rm -rf /home/scratch && exit 0

It writes random data over all free space on my /home partition, in
two passes I think, then one pass of binary zeros followed by a verify
pass.

You can also set up /tmp as a ramdisk in /etc/fstab using the line:

none /tmp tmpfs defaults 0 0

That will rebuild /tmp in memory at every reboot, for those who reboot.

And if you're leery of Adobe Flash Player, you can clear that out, too:

cd ~
rm -rf ./.adobe/Flash_Player/AssetCache/*
rm -rf ./.macromedia/Flash_Player/#SharedObjects/*

HTH,
Robert

Subject: [PLUG] [OT?] Setting up to do repetitive installs on ONE machine
	(cf BabelBox)
Message-ID: <5020F0A0.7080104@cloud85.net>

[I posted this to two Debian lists - the silence was deafening.
Can anyone comment on the logic of my approach?
Anyone doing something related on any Debian related 
distribution?
Thank you]


I have two objectives:
    1. Define, by experimentation, optimal installation 
parameters to meet my
       idiosyncratic concept of a "minimal install".
    2. Determine if there are bugs in Debian Installer, the 
instructions for
       the installer, or MY reading of those instructions.

I've bought the 8 DVD set of Debian 6.0.5 and have set aside 
a laptop as a testbed. I would divvy up the 80GB drive with 
8-10GB for a quasi-static Debian install [some other 
experiments, possible supervisor for these tests] and ~40GB 
for DVD content [possibly some additional packages]. The 
rest would be for the resulting test install and possibly 
preserving some log files.

"Debian GNU/Linux Installation Guide" (particularly sections 
4 & 5 and appendix B) give some indication that what I want 
to do is feasible. BabelBox 
{http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/BabelBox} indicates 
that something quite _similar_ has been done.


Open questions about BabelBox and its suitability for my goals:

BabelBox is apparently aimed at a fully scripted fully 
automated repetitive install install dependent only on the 
first DVD of a release [e.g. "When you get to partitioning, 
create a Linux partition on /dev/sda1 ( *_about 1.5 to 4GB_* 
depending on which media you want to use as installation 
media)..." {EMPHASIS added}].

I will, initially, be doing only manual installs using 
preseeding to avoid entering fixed data - keyboard, time 
zone, user name/password, no networking etc.

Can I simply copy all 8 DVD's to the root of my supervising 
Debian install?
After an install will I be able to do apt-get to access the 
DVD content now residing on the hard drive?
Am I missing something?
Are there other routes to my goals I should investigate?

TIA

Message-ID: <20120807074026.241e3eac@mailhost.pdx.edu>

When I bought my Thinkpad T61 almost five years ago I started by wiping
Windows and installing Ubuntu (currrently Fedora 16, x86_64). The next
thing I did was go into the BIOS and disable the touchpad because I use
an external mouse and the touchpad drives me nuts. OK, I'm already
nuts, but no point in becoming nuttier.

Imagine my surprise yesterday to discover that the touchpad was
working. I rebooted and went into the BIOS (for the first time in
nearly five years). Sure enough, the touchpad was enabled. I disabled
it again, and all is back to normal.

I have never heard of an operating system or program that can alter
BIOS settings. Is this possible? OK, evidently it is possible, since it
definitely happened. But what could have changed the BIOS setting? And
why?

Sure, it's possible. It is generally not done.

BIOS settings are maintained by a battery. Could yours be going out?

There are also tools from this site: http://flashrom.org/Flashrom

Also the new BIOS have the ability to go online themselves to check for
updates which might reset the settings.

Richard,

I don't know BabelBox -- but assume it's some form of automated
installation instructions similar to FAI or Red Hat's Kickstart.

In general, there are excellent reasons to set up a local repo based on
available packages, and I think (it's been a few years) that one step is
copying all Debian disks to a dedicated directory (which then can be
shared via NFS/FTP/HTTP for local apt* installs/updates). You'll need to
set up a database for those updates, I forget the apt* command that sets
it up in some fashion, I gather the latest relates to the repropro
package.

As for the installs -- one option is to just mirror some "gold" minimal
install, once you're satisfied with the config. 

I know that Ubuntu was working with Kickstart for some automated
installs -- don't know if that has been ported back to Debian.

Thanks,
Mike

BabelBox runs completely on a single machine. I gather from 
comments on the site that the original motivation Debian 
installs, perhaps at a show.

Part of my method/motivation is doing multiple installs. One 
result is refining my personal definition of an optimal 
install. It will also allow me to document a perceived 
glitch/bug/undocumented feature in the install procedure. 
It's possible the bug is the operator at the keyboard.

A Google search for "Ubuntu + Kickstart" gives an 
interesting initial hits, including one which apparently 
compares Kickstart's method and Debian's preseeding.

Unless, of course, the glass is half full of water, and the rest is a
vacuum.  For your amusement and edification, here is Randall Munroe's

Does anyone know where to get previous-version Ubuntu iso images?  I

I've got a problem that is either hardware or software, I'd like try the
hardware out on 10.04 (on which I know it works, on another machine)
before I go and do anything really expensive.

Did you check any mirrors? OSU OSL? I'm offline atm so can't look it
up, memory being what it is.

If you are local (ie near Portland OR) Free Geek should have copies.
Also, I'll rummage about in the old distro box. I can post a D/L link
for you if I find one later today.

Btw, if its a possible hardware issue, you can also try another distro
(Slackwas FTW! - shameless "plug").

I have all versions of 10.04, 10.10, 11.04, 11.10 and 12.04. "All
versions" means desktop, server and alternate, in 32- and 64-bit.
I also have most of the Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Kubuntu, Mythbuntu, Ubuntu
Studio, and the Edubuntu add-ons, for the same versions.

I can burn a CD or whatever else works for you.

Thanks.  Downloading now.

To everyone else:  Thanks for the offers.  I'm on travel right now or 
I'd just try the suspect hardware on my office machine (which is running 
10.04).  The hardware in question is a USB JTAG debugger for ARM 
processors, not the PC itself -- it worked quite recently on my office 
machine, but that doesn't mean it hasn't broken in some subtle way.

If I can get OpenOCD to talk to it on a virtual machine on this laptop, 
running 10.04, then I know it's a software or setup issue -- and if it's 
a setup issue, there may be enough clues in the different installations 
so that I can fix it.

Yet another idea, if none of the above is enough.  Set up a virtual
machine, install all the software you need on it and take a snapshot of it.
 Then do your confidential work on the virtual machine.  When the project
is done, the product is shipped and accepted, restore the virtual machine
from the snapshot.

strange and hasn't happened before. I commented out that check in postfix's

   Has anyone else encountered this? What RBLs are you checking in mail.cf?

Michael,

Although it's generally safe to delete items in /tmp, not all applications are well designed.  For example, the Groupwise email server has flat file databases that depend on files in /tmp and will become significantly corrupted if you delete items from there.

Subject: [PLUG] Java on Ubuntu 10.04
Message-ID: <50259264.9090103@comcast.net>

Which version of Java should I be trying to use?

It's been said here on several occasions, "The great thing about 
standards is that there are so many to chose from." I seem to be 
floundering in a small sea of them.

I've discovered that at some point, probably one of the last Firefox 
upgrades, that I no longer have Java support in Firefox. I want to 
upload a photo to Costco's photo web site, which I successfully did back 
in December, 2011, and found that the uploader didn't work. The 
recommendation was to go get the current version of Java.

After spending some time looking at 
http://java.com/en/download/linux_manual.jsp?locale=en I finally found a 
link to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java which tells me that 
"Oracle (Sun) Java 6 is no longer available to be distributed by Ubuntu, 
because of license issues." As I look in Synaptic I see that Sun Java 6 
is what I have. I also see on the above mentioned Ubuntu help page that 
I can download and install Oracle Java 7, but that there are no .deb 
packages available. I can install the JRE from a script or the entire 
Java development version from the command line, and that there are 
instructions that I can follow.

My main concern is that LibreOffice continues to run after going through 
all the uninstall and install steps. That's one reason why I have Ubuntu 
10.04 installed on both my laptop and my desktop. This lets me test an 
install on the laptop before committing to it on the desktop. While not 
perfect it seems to work reasonably well. So, I started by completely 
removing Sun Java 6, using Synaptic. Selecting that also selected 
LibreOffice. I went ahead and uninstalled. After finishing, LibreOffice 
still works. Also, after rebooting, LibreOffice still works. I don't 
know what that implies.

I looked at the LibreOffice site and saw that it is happy with OpenJDK. 
On the OpenJDK site I saw that I can install openjdk-7-jre with apt-get. 
But, when I try running

$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre

I get an error message that says, "Package openjdk-7-jre is not 
available, bit is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source.
E: Package openjdk-7-jre has no installation candidate"

I also note that on the OpenJDK site there are also JDK 6 and JDK 8 
versions. JDK 8 appears to be very much in a development state. And on 
openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk6/ there is a chart under the heading 
"Genealogy" that only adds to my confusion.

I also find openjdk-6-jre in Synaptic, but there are three different 
versions, openjdk-6-jre-headless, openjdk-6-jre and openjdk-6-jre-zero. 
The first two use Hotspot JIT and the  second uses Zero/Shark.

So, I'm confused. How do I decide which version to use?

TIA for any recommendations.

You can have various Javas installed simultaneously. In LibreOffice you
can select which one it should use. There is also a command line tool
(since forgotten) that allows you to set one as the default. I
currently have four Javas installed, although I don't know which is the
default. Everything is working, so I haven't fussed with it.

Also, if a .deb is not available, but there is an .rpm, you can convert
the .rpm to .deb with alien at the command line. Alien comes as
standard equipment on Ubuntus, at least as far as 10.04.

Thanks, John. I'll just pick one and give it a try. I see that Alien is 
installed on my machine, so I'll try that, too.

I installed openjdk-6-jre using Synaptic. Then, with Firefox, I went to 
a Java test page:

http://javatester.org/version.html

Firefox displayed a bar above the content of the page that said a 
plug-in was needed to display the some of the content on the page. At 
that point, there was a box a little below that said something to the 
effect that Java wasn't working or not installed. I clicked on the 
button in the bar above and iced-tea installed itself in Firefox. After 
that, the box a little below showed a pink rectangle telling me that 
Java Version: 1.6.0_24 from Sun Microsystems Inc." is installed.

I can now successfully access the Costco photo upload page.

>> In LibreOffice you

Yes. I found it under Tools/Options. In the first section there is a 
list with Java at the bottom. Clicking on that changes what is displayed 
on the right to the Java options panel. I now have the choice of two 
environments. I changed from the version at location:

  /use/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.26/jre

to the version at location:

  usr/libljvm/java-6-openjdk/jre

LibreOffice Writer appears to be working normally.

Thanks to all who responded.

Rod,

We have recommended The Data Recovery Room out of Seattle before 
(206.575.7773 http://recoroom.com) with reasonable results.  I met with 
a guy in Hayden that is offering some data recovery services, Ben Keele 
of QualityByte Computers (208.714.4221 http://www.qualitybyte.com) but I 
haven't heard of anyone using his services.

Rod,

We have recommended The Data Recovery Room out of Seattle before

Anybody out there had any experience using a touch screen as a

This would be a touch screen upon which an operator would press one of 
several on-screen "buttons" depending upon the quality / grade of 
products in an inspection area.

Thanks

A reminder: the $400+ needed to recover a hard drive is a lot
slower and more expensive than backing up to another hard drive. 
Prices have started down again.  See http://dirvish.org for one
way to get a lot of backups on one backup drive.

If you don't have two copies, you may end up with zero copies.

Sounds like a typical touchscreen HMI setup.  Sorry, didn't get that far in
my Industrial Controls training, and I don't have contact info handy for my
old instructor.

The impression I get (from reading lots of engineering magazines) is that
touch screens are used for occasional inputs, or ones that can be repeated
if the touch screen fails to register-- e.g. selecting info screens,
tweaking parameters or starting a process.

This would make sense, given the limited wear-resistance of touchscreens
as well as their poor performance with gloves and dirty hands.

For high-use and/or high-importance inputs, physical switches still rule.

Can you really call it a linux box if the owner doesn't have root access?

I don't think what the owner is doing really defines the box. If that were the case, many of the computers I've helped administrate over the years were not DOS boxes, or Windows boxes. They were rolodexes. Personal opinion, we shouldn't be that pedantic and narrow in our definitions. 

The important part is what kernel is the device in question running? If it's a linux kernel, then it's a linux box.

I use xubuntu on mine (also upgraded to 2g, but no SSD.  still runs a
windows VM or two acceptably) with a lighter weight WM than XFCE
(ratpoison--this is a great machine not to use the trackpad on!).  But
then, i tend to put something on and stick with it forever, and you're
clearly feeling the wanderlust, so maybe you should go with something
totally wacky like chromeos?

Define "owner" ? ;-)

Also, your question implies that the end-user doesn't have root
access, which is not necessarily the case.  

It also implies that having root access means you haven't been
compromised by some other more devious means (e.g. keylogging
bootloader or hardware or something).

While this article is pretty dated (2005), it gives a broad overview of 
some things you'll want to consider:

http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-playscreen/

It also has a ton of useful links in the Resources section.

Basically you will want to get a touchscreen controller that interfaces 
over an RS232 serial port or USB to the host computer, and an LCD 
touchscreen that works with that controller.

I have not selected one yet. My thought was to see if there was one that 
someone was able to get working without too much of a hassle or what 
problems kept them from getting it to work.

I would kind of like to keep my screen resolution up in the range of 
previous projects, 1920 x 1080. I see that Newegg has a few, Planar, HP, 
and Viewsonic. None of them claim to be LED backlit. I've had the 
florescent backlit screens die and hope that LED backlit would have much 
longer life.

I'm still working on the big picture. There is a kernel module??? Some 
sort of changes in xorg.conf??? Most of the information I've come upon 
utilizes the UART serial port and XFree86 , I would guess that is out of 
date.

I'd love to know physically how the touch-screen works - what happens 
when the screen is touched - what data is transmitted through the USB 
connection, etc.  Still googling around looking.

Just saw the response from Scott Garman. Will check that out.

Thanks
Wayne

Thanks Chris.  Not feeling whacky, feeling left alone since Fedora 12 is 
no longer supported.  I've been thinking of running some VMs (the last 
time was a _*long*_ time ago with VMware.

I'll give xubuntu a look.

I use xubuntu on my eeepc (it's maybe an "HE" model?  less than 2
years old) and the performance of the VM's is acceptable, though not
stellar.  Then again, the "native" windows install that came with it
is pretty sluggish too.

Definitely would prefer xubuntu to ubuntu on this (though I haven't
tried ubuntu 12.04 to see if things have improved with Ubuntu's
desktop manager), since there's a ton less associated overhead with
running a simple WM rather than a desktop manager.

  Anybody successfully or unsuccessfully interfaced a touch screen to a Linux box (non laptop).

While far from a Linux application...

We use a touchscreen for a time clock application.  In the few years we have been using it (5-6 drivers per shift, 2 shifts per day, 7 days per week, we have replaced one screen already.

I am the guy that gets the phone call (it affects the on board recorders/electronic log books) when the screen doesn't really accept the input of the driver.  I get those phone calls pretty regularly.  The drivers that use the keyboard for input call me much less often than the ones that make use of the screen.

Hope that's helpful.

Of course, what you really want to do is to use your favorite widget
toolkit and it will handle both the painting of the screen and the
touchscreen clicks.

Subject: [PLUG] Victor is perplexed over duplex
Message-ID: <CALNOJ_gxUbWowkz3p-auqVu3VNcP1uwUwpwUatseMf0Gkej8zw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear PLUG,

I have an HL-2270DW monochrome laser printer on Ubuntu 10.04 hooked up
to a usb port.  The following indicate the drivers on my system, I
think...

oem at freekbox:~$ dpkg  -l  |  grep  Brother
ii  cupswrapperhl2270dw                           2.0.4-2
                                         Brother HL2270DW CUPS wrapper driver
ii  hl2270dwlpr                                   2.1.0-1
                                         Brother HL-2270DW LPR driver
ii  openprinting-ppds-postscript-brother          20101122-1lsb3.2
                                Manufacturer-supplied PPD files for Brother'


The problem I have is that sometimes I don't want my printer to print
duplex.  I sometimes want it to print on just one side of the paper.
Sometimes I use paper that is already printed on one side.  If the
document that I'm printing has 10 pages to print, then I want the
printer to print the 10 pages on one side, not duplex.  I reuse paper
that has a blank page on one side sometimes.  I would not like to
print 10 separate pages, one at a time, on one side of the page, each
time.

When I go in a program to print a document I go to File, then
Print..., then a dialog box comes up entitled "Print".  In this dialog
box is a tab entitled, "Page Setup".  When I go to the "Page Setup"
tab, there is a label called, "Two-sided:".  This label is next to a
drop down box, which has three options, "One Sided", "Long Edge
(Standard)", and "Short Edge (Flip)"  When I pick "One Sided", my
printer still prints duplex.  Does "One Sided", not mean what I think
it means?

When I go to a dialog box entitled, "Printer Properties - 'HL2270DW'
on localhost", I can go to "Printer Options".  Then I see a label that
says, "Duplex:"  Next to this label is a drop down box whose choices
are, "None", "DuplexNoTumble", and "DuplexTumble".  When I choose,
"None", I still get duplex printing on my printer, when all I want is
single sided printing.  Does, "None", not mean what I think it means?

Do I have incorrect drivers on my system?  Do I need to configure
something else.

I have a feeling that the ability to turn off duplex printing is in
the Windows driver, but not in the linux driver.  Can I somehow use
wine, and the windows driver, just to be able to turn off the duplex
printing when I want, and have single sided printing.  How do I go
about doing that?  Would it somehow interfere with my linux driver?
Do I use both a windows wine, and linux driver at the same time?

I'll come to the PLUG clinic for help, but maybe someone will already
know what I need to do.  At least someone will have a heads up if they
read this email before, presumably, helping me at the clinic.

Sincerely perplexed over duplex,
Victor Soich

Victor, It looks like a bug in the proprietary driver supplied by
Brother. Maybe their customer service could answer your question.
http://www.brother-usa.com/support/CustServ.aspx

Or you could try the generic pcl driver as described here
http://roysjosh.blogspot.com/2011/05/linux-and-brother-hl-2270dw-printer.html
but it may have the same problem with duplex, since duplex is the
default on that printer.

I "think" you're asking how to do if statements in bash?

if so, it's like this:

if true
then echo yes
else echo no
fi

("fi" being "if" backwards... those crazy Bourne people)

Hello and good afternoon,

 : Is there some sort of Bourne or Bash shell equivalent to #if 0 ...
 : #endif?  I've got a group of commands in my script that take a long
 : time to execute, so I'd like to temporarily disable them.

Those are macros, sometimes called defines, sometimes called ifdefs.  
Unless you are (pre)processing your shell, no there really isn't 
something similar, however, you could simply use an if block.

Insert this around the code you do not want to run (did you know 
that there's a /bin/false and a /bin/true):

  if false; then
      ... code you want to skip
  fi

Then, naturally, you'll want to make that a shell variable, which 
means you probably get to use 'test'.  Note that 'test' is 
sometimes also written more portable as '[':

  SKIP_STUFF=please
  if test -z "$SKIP_STUFF" ; then
      ... code you still want to skip
  fi

Then, when you are done with your temporary disability....

  unset SKIP_STUFF
  if test -z "$SKIP_STUFF" ; then
      ... code you desperately wish to see running
  fi

Happy trails!

-Martin

Subject: [PLUG] Help with Xmodmap
Message-ID: <502ED3CB.3020007@zenlinux.com>

Hello,

I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around Xmodmap.

I have a laptop keyboard which has an Alt_R key but no Control_R key. I 
would like the change this Alt key to a Ctrl key.

I think what I'm supposed to do is:

clear Mod1
add Mod1 = Control_R NoSymbol Control_R

in my ~/.Xmodmap file, but when I run xmodmap on this, it returns:

Warning: Only changing the first 15 of 24 buttons.
X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for 
operation)
   Major opcode of failed request:  118 (X_SetModifierMapping)
   Value in failed request:  0x17
   Serial number of failed request:  13
   Current serial number in output stream:  13

If I simply comment out the add line, xmodmap runs without reporting any 
errors and the both of my Alt keys no longer do anything.

Is this enough information for someone to give me some suggestions?

Thanks,

Scott

Close.  Try this and see if it works:
remove Mod1 = Alt_R
add Control = Alt_R

Scott,

   Does take some time to get used to it.

> in my ~/.Xmodmap file, but when I run xmodmap on this, it returns:

   Sometimes you need to make the changes as root, not as a user. This also
has bitten me with .keymap, the console equivalent of .Xmodmap. I still
don't completely grok the tool because I need to change it so infrequently.

It is WAY too hot to be clever today.  But the Linux clinic
needs to be announced. 

So I'll let you do it.  You need to mention these things:

 * The clinic is at Free Geek at 1731 SE 10th
 * The clinic runs from 1 to 5 pm on the 3rd Sunday (8/19)
 * We fix linux problems on the computer you bring
 * We have keyboards, mice, monitors, wifi, distros
 * Expert help welcomed
 * whatever else I forgot

I could offer a prize for best announcement, but I'm too hot
to think of one.  Everybody bring a prize, and the winner
gets them all.

Thanks Daniel, that's exactly what I needed!

I can see how I had my mapping reversed when using the add command, but 
out of curiosity, can you explain why you needed the "= Alt_R" for the 
remove command?

Thanks,

Scott

Because that's how it's described in the xmodmap(1) man page?  Remove is
supposed to remove one or more keys associated with a specific modifier, in
your case Mod1:

       remove MODIFIERNAME = KEYSYMNAME ...
               This removes all keys containing the given keysyms from the
indicated modi?
               fier  map.   Unlike add, the keysym names are evaluated as
the line is read
               in.  This allows you to remove keys from a modifier without
having to worry
               about whether or not they have been reassigned.

"Clear"ing a modifier will clear all keys associated with that modifier,
which removes both Alt_L and Alt_R (and possibly Meta_L if it's mapped to a
physical key):

       clear MODIFIERNAME
               This  removes all entries in the modifier map for the given
modifier, where valid name are: Shift, Lock, Control, Mod1, Mod2, Mod3,
Mod4, and Mod5 (case does
               not matter in modifier names, although it does matter for
all other names).  For example, ``clear Lock'' will remove all any keys
 that  were  bound  to  the
               shift lock modifier.

If it's just for commenting out multi-line commands, you could wrap
them in a subshell with the first command being exit:

( exit

Portland Linux/Unix Group Advanced Topics Meeting Announcement

Who: Stephen Hemminger
What: Vyatta
Where: Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Avenue, Portland (Left Entrance)
When: Tuesday, August 21st, 2012 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of awesome, open technologies.

Linux has been used for network routing for many years, but the
interface is different than the standard network appliances.  Vyatta
is a Debian based distribution that provides an open command line
interface that looks like Cisco or Juniper. The command line is built
on top of standard bash shell with extensible template language.

This talk will go into the history of Vyatta, where it came from
and how it is used today. For those who want to contribute or modify,
it will also cover the internals of how this implemented.


Stephen Hemminger is a software engineer working remotely in Portland
for Vyatta. He has been involved with Linux networking for 8 years
and currently maintains bridging and routing utilities. Steve
regularly presents at Linux conferences.


Many will break for the Lucky Lab on Hawthorne afterwards.

Great timing. :)

I have the Macintosh Command key hard-wired to my thumb and have been 
experimenting with Xmodmap. I can swap ALT and CTRL but was hoping to 
add more Mac-like behavior: Use ALT only in conjunction with TAB and 
hopefully ` for window switching within application, then map CTRL to 
ALT so I can do ALT-C ALT-V for copy and paste.

Can this be done?

No and yes.

I subscribe to the Calagator feed which includes PLUG events.

Would a feed be welcomed by many?

Also... does anyone know of a phone app that will allow you to add an

Message-ID: <CANdpE5XxYmHk2e4mHb17Jg=b=WcMA9FJ2_KKgYdw-b6Wta_HYw@mail.gmail.com>

There seems to be quite a bit of Asterisk and phone expertise in the
meetings so I thought I'd reach out to the group to see if my SIP provider
is being unreasonable. I have an outbound SIP trunk configured with our
provider, nexVortex. On this SIP trunk, I have allowed the g729 codec and
disabled all others. There are a couple numbers that when we call out on
this trunk, give us a "488 Not acceptable here", usually a codec error.
Working with our provider, the common thread is that those numbers are all
hosted by nexVortex themselves, and not hitting the PSTN. They are simply
proxying the connection to the other customer's phone server.

Am I unreasonable in thinking that it is nexVortex's job to transcode this
connection, and not burden us with supporting all codecs their customers
might be using? Or should I be allowing more codecs on my trunk? Thanks!

You should be transcoding or allowing more codecs.  NexVortex is just a
broker, and they're most likely not even in the middle of the RTP stream.

Also, g.729 usually requires a license to use, so it's often disabled.

Uness bandwidth is significantly constrained, I usually use g.711a/u - it's
still the best-sounding codec(s), and universally supported.

Oh, how many times I have seen this message..... must be in the
thousands (I used to do SEO work back in the day.)

It usually results from somebody being on a network where some kind of
bot is running some kind of automatic query system, to, for example,
find google SERP rankings of different web pages for a given search,
or something similar.

It works on a timer, and is tied to IP address, so you can just wait,
or try from a different network, or through a proxy. If you know what
system on your network is slamming google with requests, and you have
some control over it, you can throttle it down, and/or encourage them
to launder through multiple source IP addresses (via proxies)....

sudo let the user in question that his activity would be recorded and

Back when I worked in a CS department with a thousand inquisitive
students, we wrote our own kernel modules to stop forkbombs and were
generally proactive and had few actual security incidents.  But the
best moment perhaps was a sudo message like this, which started with a
command like your first one, and then was followed by:

YYYYYY: Aug 23 15:41:46 : ZZZZZZ : user NOT in sudoers ; TTY=pts/1 ;
PWD=/home/ZZZZZZ ; USER=root ; COMMAND=make me a sandwich

   In the early 1970s at the U. of Illinois (Champaign/Urbana) _all_ CS
students thought it was a right of passage to crash the IBM mainframes. This
was with Hollerith card decks, too, or the few terminals running 300 baud in
the room off the mainframe area. PITA, too.

   But, we grad students had our revenge. Toward the end of each semester the
CS100 and CS101 students would wait until the last minute to get their
projects run through the system. One course I took was in ecosystem modeling
and I'd written a rather large (2 card boxes worth) program in FORTRAN IV to
model energy flow through Cedar Lake, MN. It was not unusual during the week
before finals for someone to call my lab and ask me to walk my deck to the
remote job entry card reader in the building next door and run my model.
When it got to the front of the process queue it consumed all resources for
a few hours. Shortly thereafter I'd get a call from another grad student
that the system cleared out so I'd cancel my model and other grad students
could get their work done.

Dear PLUG,

I am now able to print in Duplex, and Not In Duplex!  I also need to
change the name of my printers.  Keep reading if you can help me
figure out how to change the name of my printers, and keep reading
furthermore, if your interested in know how my Duplex, Not In Duplex,
printing issue was resolved, or more accurately, hacked to make it
work.

I have two printer drivers on my system.  One is named,
"Brother-HL-2270DW-series", and I want to rename it,
"Brother-HL-2270DW-series Not Duplex", and the other is named,
"HL2270DW", and I want to rename it, "HL2270DW Duplex".  I want to
rename it so that when I go to print something, I know which driver to
use in order to get "Not Duplex", or "Duplex", printing.  I am able to
change the description of these printers, but that doesn't show up
when I go to print something.

When I tried to change the name of the two printers within the dialog
box , "Printing - localhost", I got another dialog box that popped up
and said, "CUPS server error There was an error during the CUPS
operation: 'client-error-bad-request'. "

I figure I'm not root when I try to change the name.  Usually, I'm
prompted for a root password when I try to mess with admin stuff.
But, I'm not sure.  So....how do I change the name, and not just the
description, so that when I go to print, I'll be reminded which driver
is Duplex, and which is Not In Duplex?

I am now able to print duplex on my printer, AND not to print duplex
on my printer!  The following is how this came to be, if you care to
read and / or comment.

By a combination of what Bill Barry told me on this list, and the
rhetoric I heard at the PLUG clinic regarding printers, I was able to
make my way to the web site
http://www.openprinting.org/printer/Generic/Generic-PCL_6_PCL_XL_Printer
and eventually figured out how to download the appropriate PPD file,
i.e. Generic PCL 6/PCL XL Printer

I then went to install a new printer, and instead of letting ubuntu
10.04 find a driver, I had it "install", if that's the right word, the
PPD file, i.e. Generic PCL 6/PCL XL Printer

Now I have two print drivers for my Brother HL-2270DW printer.  One
driver is from the manufacturer Brother, and does duplex printing, and
the duplex printing can't be shut off.  This is an unresolved bug, as
far as I can tell....
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/foomatic-db/+bug/684314

The other printer driver is the PPD file, i.e. Generic PCL 6/PCL XL
Printer which doesn't have the ability to print in duplex, i.e. it can
only print on one side of the page, and does not make use of my
printer's capability to do duplex.

So, I have one "good" driver, to do the duplex, and one, "cut rate"
driver, to do the Not In Duplex, i.e. singleplex, monoplex?

Thank you all for helping me resolve this issue.  It has not been fun!
 I specifically made sure I bought a printer that had a reputation for
working with linux, at least according to Newegg feedback.

According to
http://www.openprinting.org/printer/Brother/Brother-HL-2270DW
my printer gets a rating of 3 penguins!!!

and according to
http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/openprinting/database/databaseintro

3 penguins mean....
Perfect printers work perfectly; everything the printer can do is
working also under Linux and Unix. For multifunction devices, this
must include scanning/faxing/etc.

So....an end (L)user like me did his due diligence in buying a
printer, and still runs into hassle, consternation, angst, and most of
all, inconvenience in trying to embrace the gosh darn linuxy ethos!
Still, thank you all for your help, and, most importantly of all,
thanks for listening to me kvetch!

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

As far as I know, CUPS does not allow for changing the name of a printer.
You have to add a new one and delete the old one.

I have done so. I have half a dozen "printers" installed for my Xerox
Phaser 7400DN, each with a different PPD and/or driver. I was able to
call each one different things. The name works in the dialog box and
when I use lpr at the command line.

I am pouring concrete today and don't have time to give details. I also
have other comments re editing the PPD file, but they will have to wait
until later. Concrete waits for no man.

I know you can do it by editing the config file. For Victor's particular
case, I would suggest going the add/remove route.

I tried on my CUPS interface and the name field is not editable when I
click Modify Printer. That, combined with my experience on Mac and from
Victor's description of what he's doing, tells me CUPS really doesn't want
us renaming things.

OK, let me say first that I am using Fedora 16, x86_64, not Ubuntu.
Therefore, some configurations may be different for me.

To change the name of the printer I just open Administration >
Printing, which opens system-config-printer 1.3.8, "a cups
configuration tool" in a dialog box showing all my installed printers.
If I right click on a printer one of the options is Rename. Selecting
that pops up a warning that renaming the printer will lose history. If
I select OK to ignore the warning the name under the printer icon
becomes editable. I can call it anything I want. 

Regarding the PPD files, Victor has a partial solution by installing a
different "printer" that he wishes to rename. The different printer
uses a PPD file that apparently can print only in simplex. His other
printer can seemingly only print in duplex. So his plan is to use one
"printer" when he needs simplex and the other when he needs duplex.

That is a solution that will work, but a more elegant solution would be
to edit the PPD file for the newly installed printer so that it will
offer the option of printing duplex OR simplex, and will do so
reliably. If that can be achieved, then he can just delete the original
"printer."

PPD files are plain text documents of only a couple pages. It is
trivial to edit a PPD file. However, knowing *how* to edit the PPD file
is not so trivial. You need to understand the syntax. In Victor's case,
however, the only syntax knowledge required is the language for the
simplex-duplex options. The syntax for PPD files is doubtless
documented somewhere on the net (Adobe would be a likely guess), but
you could also just open a lot of PPD files and read through them until
you find the right lines. 

Before I conclude let me point out something about PPD files. When you
download a PPD file your browser placed it in your default download
folder, probably Desktop or Downloads or something. When you install
the printer using the PPD file you point the installer to the
downloaded file. At that point CUPS makes a copy of the PPD file in
(too lazy to check) /etc/cups/ppd/. It is the copy that the driver
uses, not the one in your download folder. So edit away, but your edits
won't take effect until they are made on the copy that CUPS uses.

I hope that adds something to the discussion. It is 8 pm, all my
muscles ache and my hands hurt. I'm going to bed.

The best news I know of with regards to Linux and e-readers is that Sony 
uses the Android OS to power their e-reader, which in my opinion is the 
best candidate for a becoming a Kindle-killer, boasting the best book 
annotation and best PDF reading / annotating capabilities of any device 
on the market, save for perhaps the Kindle. The software on the computer 
side appears to have recently undergone a complete overhaul about two 
years ago, judging from the number of rough corners still in the 
software, but the software itself is usable and the device is excellent. 
I don't entirely sure how you would transfer books from a GNU/Linux 
based PC to the Sony e-Reader, since I use a Windows-based PC at home, 
but I'm fairly certain it's as simple as mounting the device, copying 
over your files and categorizing them as you see fit device-side. The 
internal databases are SQL lite databases from what I can tell, so the 
more adventurous types can try and modify the database directly if they 
want (back up your data first, though).

There's also the Kobo, but I haven't really looked into that particular 
device too much.

It's  morning and I'm back among the living.

Here is a link to a PDF from Adobe for the syntax of PPD files:

http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/ps/5003.PPD_Spec_v4.3.pdf

The above document also contains a couple sample PPD files. There are
also hundreds of PPD files on Adobe's website. Here is a link to
download all of them as a single compressed file:

http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=204

I would suggest downloading all of them from the link above and then
open a few in Gedit. Select PPD files for printers that are similar,
even older or newer models of the same printer that you have. There may
even be one for your exact model. If so, open it and the one you
already downloaded and compare them.

Hello all,

I am waiting from two people out of six or so contenders for the 
September 6th PLUG General meeting but time is running out. Most are too 
busy with their returns to work and school.

Might anyone have a presentation they would like to give?

In the works are UEFI, licensing (slated for Sep. AT), Hadoop/Lustre, 
packet radio, USB 3.0, a Mozilla update, open source photo editing plus 
a few more topics out of Intel.

Given the popularity of the FreePBX talk, is anyone using FreeSWITCH?

How about Kazoo? (recently of FLOSS weekly) pfSense? Raspberry Pi?

Michael

interesting! the Fedora devs must have scripted it such that it will remove
and re-add the printer in CUPS for you. hence the loss of the history. how
nice of them.

I couldn't help but notice that Webmin 1. is still around and 2. now has 
VM and cloud management features.

Is anyone using it?

Might anyone want to present on it?

I don't, but my coworker uses it extensively. I'll see what he thinks about doing a talk.

Hi

Just upgraded from Ubuntu 10.4 to 12.4

Broke the printer.

Epson Stuylus 88+

Worked great before the upgrade.

Shows up in printers.

Accepts jobs.

Just no printing.


Darn I get this


Aug 30 12:57:39 home: kernel: Kernel logging (proc) stopped.
This is when I did the upgrade yesterday..  No new messages since then

I need to get Kernel logging back on.. How do I do that?

TIA

Marvin
