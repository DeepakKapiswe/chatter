I just booted 2.6.10 last night and was initially surprised and
confused when my USB storage (actually a SmartMedia reader) wasn't
appearing at the usual /dev/sda1 location.  Turns out, it is showing
up at /dev/uba1 instead.  That is new, at least since 2.6.8.1 which
this box was running until a few days ago.  

Just a heads up for other usb-storage users.

If you are like me, you hardly ever actually use the reset button, so
why not just unplug it from your motherboard?  You can always power
cycle if you lock-up the machine.

Just a thought,

I once (circa 1995) rewired a "turbo" switch (which were once a common
feature on PC cases) to select either 5V or 12V for a DC fan cooling
disks.  Turned out, 5V cooled fine and 12V was too noisy anyway, so
the selector was mostly useless after the first 5 minutes of use.

Russell,

I've never done serial terminals but I did see the following section 
when I was looking at the grub manual, maybe it will give you some leads.

Well, that's interesting...

Are you using devfs or udev?

Derek,

   An excellent thought. However, now that I look at the box, it was the
power switch that I accidently hit. The reset button is on the other side.

   This was the case from the beginning. In the 1980s we used to jumper the
motherboards for turbo and not plug in the switch.

   This is an opening for me to ask a question about grub versus lilo. I know
that grub offers more than lilo in several contexts. My impression, however,
and based on limited grub experience is that it really doesn't matter which
loader one uses if there's only a single OS on the system. Is this correct?

   I used to triple-boot PC-DOS/7, NT/4 and Red Hat-4.x using lilo with no
problems. For the past several years I've booted only linux, and usually
only a single kernel version. In this situation I fail to see any difference
between the two. And, when I trashed /usr on my new notebook (please don't
ask how I did such a stupid thing!), and restored it from the rescue
partition, grub was replaced with lilo. Woiks just fine.

   No flame war intended, just curiosity.

Thanks,

Rich

   For some reason not yet identified, I cannot ping outside my network from

   This is all related, I think, to Dan Bernstein's svscan. But, I've not

   I also have a zombie process:

   Can anyone help?

Yeah, that would be useful *after* I was able to type at it.  Problem
is getting to type anything at it at all.  The serial console was
working on the old hard disk.  Oh, and throw in a malfunctioning
floppy drive and no locally available monitors to plug in.

How far back, chronologically, is a USB key type device likely to work
as a boot device?

24-48 months... boards that booted USB 48 months ago, however, were rare
(if they existed at all - I'm not sure they did).

Booting from a USB key is tricky, too.

It's not the cause of the network problem, but it's possibly a result.

I've never seen that error, but I Googled for this and got a lot of hits:

   multilog fatal: unable to lock directory:

It sounds like one cause of that error is when there is a multilog 
process running and another one tries to start, the new one can't get 
the lock.

Did you restart Qmail while you were troubleshooting? Is there more than 
one multilog process running? You may want to do that same Google and 
dig through the results.

As for the pinging issue, can you ping the gateway even? Can you access 
outside web sites, email, etc.? If you can do other things but not ping, 
then there is probably packet filtering that is blocking at least some 
ICMP traffic. If you can't use the web, email, etc., then you'll want to 
check and make sure you have the right gateway, DNS servers, etc.

Are you certain that rsync copied /boot/grub.conf?  Did you remember to 
install grub on the boot partition of the new disk?

   Well, I need to resolve both so the order doesn't matter to me. :-)

   Nuts! I should have thought of that, too. Thanks.

   I don't know what is a 'multilog' process. Guess I need to learn that
fast, eh?

   Don't run qmail. But, yesterday, I stopped postfix, upgraded from 2.1.4 to
2.1.5, then restarted it. Perhaps that's the issue? I'll stop postfix, look
at the process list, and restart it.

> As for the pinging issue, can you ping the gateway even?

   Yes. I can ping internal hosts with no problem.

> Can you access outside web sites, email, etc.?

   No. It was when I tried to load a Web page from that host that I
discovered the problem. And, both 'netstat -rn' and 'route' show me that the
proper gateway is up and available. '/etc/resolve.conf' also has both the
server IP address and an external dns server as a backup.

   I thought -- still think -- it's a dns issue. Perhaps that got mangled the
last time I used the machine, which was when I was away from the office and
using the WiFi link. I'll copy /etc/resolv.conf from the server to the
notebook and try again.

   Stay tuned for reports on both the multilog (wonder if that's like
multi-grain bread?) and dns issues.

Many thanks,

Rich

Do you not have a CD drive?

You will need to boot something to get to the point to install GRUB on 
the new drive. I like this rescue CD a lot, and it has GRUB on it:

http://www.sysresccd.org/

I did find this page that has info on rolling your own version of it 
with a kernel that supports serial output:

http://www.sysresccd.org/howto/sysresccd-howto-advanced-customization.php

It looks like it should be pretty bootable to burn yourself a CD that 
would do what you need. You could skip the grsecurity patch he mentions. 
You might ask for more help on their forums if you run into problems.

Their manual has a lot of good info, too, including info on how to boot 
it from a USB stick.

It doesn't sound like it. I think he needs to boot from some other media 
to get to the point where he can run grub-install...

Pretty doable, I mean, but you would want to make the CD bootable :)

I wouldn't think it has anything to do with Postfix. You said you're 
using svscan though, right? People usually use that with Qmail, they are 
both written by DJB. Multilog and svscan are both part of his daemontools:

If you really can ping the gateway address that netstat -rn shows, but 
you can't get to outside hosts, then it may be DNS. One way to 
troubleshoot that would be to ping an outside host using it's IP 
address. You could look something up from the box that's working to get 
an IP to use.

Hopefully the new resiolv.conf fixes it, though.

Rich,

   Yes, I discovered that. I read the Web page on multilog but it doesn't
tell me how to get rid of a zombie instance. What do I need to kill and
restart? It doesn't say.

   However, by stopping postfix and restarting it I lost that multilog access
error mess in the process list. Shrug. The zombie, of course, does no harm,
but the readproctitle access error is still there. Do I do a SIGHUP on that
process ID? Can't hurt, can it?

   It does. I had an ineffective backup (/etc/resolv.conf.staticIP) for
situations like this. Used scp to get the one from the server and that fixed
the problem.

   Interesting. When I'm at the hotels in Corvallis (Hilton Garden Inn or
Salbasgeon Suites), I use dhcpcd to get an IP address that works while I'm
there, but it leaves /etc/resolv.conf alone. This last trip, to the Hood
River Inn, ended up adding a new dns server to the file and leaving the
static, local IP address not working. But, it's fixed now. At least, after
all these years I've learned that such issues are related to dns and to look
at the resolv.conf file. :-)

   Now, about that readproctitle ....

Thanks,

Rich

If it's a zombie I don't think a HUP will do anything. You could kill -9 
it to get rid of it.

Rich,

   No, that didn't get rid of it. But, it did clear up that 'readproctitle
service errors" ... momentarily.

   I shut down and put the UPS with the new battery back on line, traded
monitors since Hyundai sent the warranty replacement (and it has built-in
speakers which the Samsung replacement doesn't) and rebooted.

   That error -- and the zombie is back.

   Time to google and find someone who can help with a daemontools problem.
Dan won't, I know.

Thanks,

Rich

   Oh, boy! I'm not alone in finding this multilog error, but virtually every
reference google turns up is with qmail. That's not the MTA here. I did,
however, learn to find the details, here they are:

[root at salmo]# cat /proc/1384/cmdline
readproctitleserviceerrors:...ccess denied
multilog: fatal: unable to lock directory ./main: access denied
multilog: fatal: unable to lock directory ./main: access denied
multilog: fatal: unable to lock directory ./main: access denied
multilog: fatal: unable to lock directory ./main: access denied
multilog: fatal: unable to lock directory ./main: access denied
multilog: fatal: unable to lock directory ./main: access denied

   Can anyone suggest where I look to learn what this means? Where is that
main directory located? How do I fix this? It's obviously not fatal, but
it's also not clean. A google search on the phrase, "unable to lock
directory ./main" returns 7 hits; all qmail related.

   Does this mean that daemontools should be removed? In my naivety it struck
me as a useful inet service controller.

Thanks,

Rich

Okay, I'll come clean.  The problem is solved already, and in pretty
much exactly the way Galen suggests (the latter part, anyway, I had
successfully rsync'd the old /boot/grub stuff).

I was previously unaware of how to install grub on a new disk when it
was not in the final working position.  That is, I knew how to boot
from a Grub floppy and "grub-install /dev/hda" and presto-chango, it
worked fine.  My initial attempt was to build a grub floppy with its
own filesystem.  Usually I just do the:

  # dd if=stage1 of=/dev/fd0 bs=512 count=1
  # dd if=stage2 of=/dev/fd0 bs=512 seek=1

But in order to get a boot floppy with its own menu.lst (aka
grub.conf) so that you can tell it to talk to the serial console,
you've got to do something like this instead:

  # mount /dev/fd0 /mnt
  # mkdir -p /mnt/boot/grub
  # cp stage1 stage2 /mnt/boot/grub

  # cat > /mnt/boot/grub/menu.lst <<EOF
  serial --unit=0 --speed=9600
  terminal console serial
  EOF  
 
  # grub
  grub> root (fd0)
  grub> setup (fd0)
  grub> quit

  # umount /mnt

Now, that'll give you a grub boot floppy that should work... if the
floppy/floppy-drive is working.  If (like, say, after the third
floppy) nothing comes up on the serial console during boot, and you
don't know why, and the only attachable monitor in the office is dead,
you might get annoyed and drive home and get your spare monitor.

Then once you plug in the working monitor, you might (hypothetically,
of course) figure out that you seem to be getting a consistent error
reading the floppy during stage2 loading.  Maybe some dust in the
pretty-much-unused-for-three-years floppy drive.  Then you might
scratch your head for a few minutes and think about what you just did,
and then adapt that to the situation where you install grub boot
sector stuff to a random device.  Boot off the old hard disk, which
naturally still works, with the new one plugged in at /dev/hdc, and do
something like:

  # grub
  grub> root (hd1,0)
  grub> setup (hd1)
  grub> quit

then connect the new disk back to /dev/hda and boot fine.

Yeah, I went and looked at your backup/restore stuff while thinking
about this.  I remembed that you had dealt with this problem.  I still
don't quite understand the significance of "root" in the context of
"setup", nor precisely what "setup" is doing.  I should do some more
reading.

Just thinking about how grub _has_ to work, something you write to the
boot sector has to tell grub where to look for the menu.lst file.  The
"root" line must be doing that.  

Another unrelated grub mystery is where the "savedefault" value gets
stored between boots.  It'd be kind of handy to be able to mutate that
value to get a set-next-default kind of utility.

Seems pretty general to me.  How more general do you want to make it?

Message-ID: <ca51655305010121095631d1fc@mail.gmail.com>

I have a system that seems to be working in
all cases except the screen blanks during the boot
process.  

I'm running Fedora Core 3.  Kernel 2.6.9-1.681_FC3
with selinux enabled.

This system worked until I removed the CD-ROM and
replaced it with a compact Flash disk as slave drive.

Now after I have changed everything back to original
it still blanks the screen.

I can still get into the box with ssh to change things
but with the LVM volume mounting I cannot seem 
to run a boot disk to make other changes when 
things are not mounted.

Any ideas?

Can the interfaces on those be used as a pair of 802.11g interfaces
instead of the dual mode? This would be great for a repeater, or talking

I have been actively trying to recruit speakers lately, but haven't 
been very successful.  Maybe things will improve after the holidays,
but for now:

    (1)  Is anyone interested in speaking at the Jan 6, 2005 meeting?
         If not, we will come up with something but it would be best
         if someone could speak.

    (2)  Does anyone know anyone I should contact about speaking?
         I have a couple possibilities, but haven't been able to
         contact them due to the holidays and what not.


                                          Sincerely,

Fry's is offering a "Great Quality" brand laptop for $499.

Obviously, at this low price, I am suspicious of the quality.

Does anyone know of quality data about this item?

Thanks

   Obviously was, Piet.

   I'm running dnscache, but not tinydns. Regardless, running 'locate run'
showed on in /etc/dnscache/log. When I looked in that directory I discovered
that the main/ subdirectory was owned by 508.508 (and so was the 0 byte
status file). I changed owner.group to root.root on main/ and all its
contents. That should do it, thank you very much.

   Yesterday I ran 'kill -HUP <procreadtitle pic>' and that removed the
process. The defunct multilog zombie is still there, but that's OK with me.
I don't think I'll see the access error again whenever procreadtitle is
again run, which may not be until the system is re-booted.

   So much to learn, ... so little time. I wonder how many other incorrect
owner.group IDs are hanging around.

Again, thanks,

Rich

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0501021112480.20312-100000@gisnet.com>

I'm trying to create a procmail filter to add one to the score every time
it sees a word or its plural.

Say the word was "dog" (it's not, but I don't want to trigger everyone's 
spam filter!) and I want to catch all messages with at least 4 occurrences 
of the word "dog" in them.

I try this:

:0:
* -3^0
* 1^1 HB ?? ()\<dog\>
CANINE-MAIL

And it traps messages like:

The dog chased the other dog out of his dog house into the dog kennel.

But I want it to pass message like:

It's a doggone world in which doggerel is preached to dogfaces, though 
Omidog.

(and BTW, why does "dog dog dog dog" pass through? It shouldn't)

But ultimately, I want it to be able to trap a message like this:

The dog chased the other dogs out of his dog house into the dog kennel.


Anyone know how to specify a full word or its plural without having to 
make two entries?

Anecdotal data:  I bought one of their "Great Quality" PCs for $100. 
The hardware is low quality and the USB controller has a Via chipset
that's caused me a bit of grief but the latest drivers seem to have
resolved the issues.

All things considered, I think I got a fair deal.  I didn't pay a lot. 
I didn't get a lot.  Once I added some extra ram and got rid of Lindows
(er, Linspire), everything was just fine.

Cheers,

Heh.

E.g., This morning I discovered that one of my reiserfs partitions was
failing (hard disk i/o errors).  I wonder why smartd didn't tell me
about this?  I only noticed it because I happened to wake up unusually
early and was present when updatedb was running and heard the
chirping.  Checking the logs, it only started about a week ago when
the affected disk space got used (just 12 4k blocks, near the end of
the media).

I was able to rsync off everything that was valuable (only
affected directory was in a kernel source tree), but trying to repair
the filesystem (in order to facilitate data recovery) failed because
one of the bad blocks was in a system area.  I could have dd_rescue'd
the whole disk image onto reliable media and reiserfsck
--rebuild-tree'd, but because of the limited and (it turns out)
unimportant damage, it wasn't necessary.  Luckily, I just bought a
couple spare 80 gig drives on new years eve, so I had a place for the
data to land.

The dying drive is another IBM Deskstar (DTLA-307030), which according
to Hitachi is now 7 months out of warranty.

IBM Deskstar are two words that bring memories of pain and fear to many, 
I'm sure. I rememeber a review I saw on Amazone for one of the models 
that said something like, "I can't sleep at night." :)

the file.

   The RealPlayer installation put softlinks to ~/.mozilla/plugins. I have a
directory, ~/.mozilla/firefox/ with a file named "pluginreg.dat". That is a
generated file (from something) and doesn't seem to be what I need.

   Any ideas how I configure firefox to open RealPlayer10 for these files?

Thanks,

Rich

   I should mention that I searched google and found references only for

There's info on PLugins under the Help (look at Index, then PLugins.) 
Also, they say you can add plugins under Tools > Options > Downloads > Plugins

Hmm... I see your problem, Rich. The help file under Plug-ins says, "You
can also install plug-ins after you install Firefox."  But it doesn't say
how, and all the options off the Tools menu lead to managing *existing*
plug-ins, and it doesn't say nada about how to get a plug-in into the
program in the first place.

Now *I* want to know too. MAybe there's some help at the mozilla.org site.

Piet,

   Interestingly enough, it didn't. I changed the directory, but when the
system shut down (UPS failure -- it ain't the battery) and I rebooted, the
same error showed up in the process list. Annoying.

Thanks,

And, for reference, I have a Deathstar 75GXP (*the* model that initiated
the lawsuit)...

It's been running virtually nonstop for a few years now without any real
issues.  Every few months it starts chirping or clicking... giving me
cause for concern... but every time it settles back down within a few
days.

However, early this morning it started clicking again - only this time a
different click.  They're shorter sounding and higher pitched than
before.  No data loss yet, SMART (as usual) doesn't say anything is
wrong... so I'll let it continue on.  I'm thinking about decommissioning
the box it's in, though, it doesn't get used very much any more, only
acting as my VPN server and for a few automated scripts that could
easily be moved to a different server.

Of course, then what would I do with the box?

Reading dmesg I see the following:

Use a HIGHMEM enabled kernel.
896MB LOWMEM available.

   I have 1G RAM installed. I don't recall seeing a kernel configuration

Lazy man, why don't you tediously click through all the kernel configs like 
the rest of us.

;)

For the 2.4 kernel, look under Processor type -> features -> High Memory 
Support. I dunno for 2.6.

If my elderly memory is not playing tricks on me, I thought LOWMEM was up to 1 
gigabyte.

   Well, you're memory is not that old that it would be considered elderly,
but for whatever reason the kernel only likes just under 900M worth. Seems a
rather strange cut-off value for me, too.

I am trying to boot into console mode (no X-server) to
install something on Debian Sarge. Ordinarily one
modifies inittab for this purpose, but it says

id:2:initdefault:

Since runlevel 5 is usually X mode, I'm not sure why X
is coming up now! Anyhow, what is the easiest way to
do this?

Debian doesn't do runlevels like RedHat.  I think I read that you have
to set up seperate ones for console and X yourself if you want them,
but I'll let the Debian experts explain it to you better.

In Debian, runlevels 2-5 are all the same. So whatever you select at 
installation- text or graphical login- applies to all runlevels. Debian 
assumes you are smart enuff to customize it however you like. Or something 
like that.

Anyway you want the 'update-rc.d' command. For example, to make runlevel 5 the 
graphical runlevel, and all others text, assuming gdm is your graphical login 
manager:

# update-rc.d -f gdm remove
# update-rc.d gdm start 99 5 . stop 01 0 1 2 3 4 6 .

First remove all startup links for gdm, then explicitly assign gdm start and 
stop for each runlevel. A smart Debian noobie would buy my book and have all 
these answers at his fingertips. ;)

I want to thank everyone who responded to my request for help with USB 
flash drive.

I could not duplicate most of the suggestions including the one below that 
'Prefreneces' has a 'Removable Storage' entry. I appear to be running 
Gnome, but do not know how to find which Fedore, but I now suspect that I 
installed FC1 since that was included with the Sams book that I got.

I am now downloading the FC3 set of CDs from Red Hat as I write. Presumably 
a new installation will cure this problem. Will it preserve the Apachie 
etc. settings?

Thanks again
JK

Bryan,

   Thank you. I have ~/.mozilla/plugins/ which contains soft links to both
libraries. I don't seem to have a mozilla components directory.

   I'm also not sure about #3: "Make sure a symbolic link to the realplay
script is in your PATH". If this refers to the realplayer script in
~/RealPlayer/ then I just made a link to it from /usr/local/bin.

   Now, I tried it with a Reuters TV feed. In the download dialog box I
specified opening the ram.jsp file with ~/RealPlayer/realplayer ... et
voila! Video. No sound, but video.

   So, I'm half-way there. Now to figure out why the sound isn't working.

Thanks,

Rich

Yeah, your memory is right, although the 2.4 config help isn't too clear on
this.  (They give a lower number as the LOWMEM limit.)  But the 2.6 config
help does advise you to use HIGHMEM if you have more than 1GB of RAM.

And yes, I've tried building a 2.4 kernel with 1GB of RAM and with HIGHMEM set,
and no, it didn't help my memory addressing problem.

Or even better, just open the config file in a text editor and search. 
It's pretty easy to track things down that way.

   The RealPlayer installation made soft links to ~/.mozilla/plugins. That
does let me view the video when I set the download to use realplayer.
Getting sound to work will need to wait until I have time.

Yes; and then putting "startkde" in a newly-created
.xinitrc has the desired effect.

There is still a potential problem with the
installation of the NVIDIA driver. It is intended to
supplant the rivafb now loaded when the system boots,
and conflicts with it. Is it necessary to compile a
kernel that doesn't support the module now used? Or
can it be prevented from loading?

Or another card, perhaps? I can tell that another book
would definitely be useful. And probably a little
cheaper than the card.

Do "cat /etc/*release", on SuSE this file is /etc/SuSE-release, on
Redhat it should be /etc/redhat-release, fedora should have something
similar.

I just moments ago read an article in this months Linux Magazine that
described a problem mounting the Apple iPod on Linux, that may be
related, since I've ssen similar lock up problems trying to access my
camera and thumb drive on SuSE 9.1.

In a nutshell the problem is with the EFI partition table support in the
2.6 kernels, the EFI partition table is stored at the last block of the
drive rather than the first.  If the USB device reports an incorrect
number of blocks and the EFI code goes looking for a partition table
there, you get a locked out drive.  The suggestion in the article was to
disable CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION and rebuild the kernel.

Yes, that part is kind of important. :)
Debian's documentation is pretty decent, look on http://www.debian.org/doc/

I'm rather lame on video drivers, but I don't believe there will be a 
conflict. rivafb is a framebuffer driver- the nVidia installer should set up 
everything correctly. Anyway you can always use good ole modconf to remove 
any kernel modules you want to get rid of.

There is apparently some conflict (too much to
tolerate). Changing the XF86Config file back leaves me
where I was; there is no need to *uninstall* the new
driver.

Since modconf doesn't find the rivafb "module" (but
does find the new one) I assume that the former
support is built into the kernel. (This is a stock
Sarge kernel, 2.4.27-1-386.) There are a few possible
remedies, such as rebuilding the kernel without this
support or a different card.

All I really want to do is get a TV card working,
perhaps with an image of mediocre quality. For some
reason xawtv doesn't work, and tvtime insists on a
good driver. With the same hardware, FreeBSD's
primitive FXTV works fine.

Suppose I were to compile a kernel for Sarge because I
needed a feature changed. Should I stick with the
above, or use a different one? If this enabled me to
use my present hardware, it would probably justify the
trouble. 

If you go for 2.6 you need to switch to ALSA and stuff
like that. Is this a problem?

I note that Debian seems to use a text-based
configuration tool for the 2.4 kernel. That seems unfortunate.

I switched my wife's Debian (testing) box to 2.6 and there were 
absolutely no hiccups whatsoever. I have a vague memory that I 
followed a HOWTO to ensure that I'd installed all the correct 
supporting packages -- but the switchover was incredibly trouble-free. 
Kudos to all the developers who made that bit of sweetness possible!

See Pluggers, mixed marriages can work! Even Red Hat/Debian marriages.

Debian users can have 'make menuconfig' or 'make xconfig' just like the other 
Linuxes. 'make config' is for masochists. There are some Debian-specific 
kernel-building utilities that are quite nice; somewhere in the docs on 
http://www.debian.org/doc/ is a howto or two.

One issue I recall reading about with the 2.6 kernel is problems with 
cdrecord; dunno if those are resolved yet.

It doesn't really make much difference.  If you like, you can install
the kernel-source package, which will give you the exact same treei
that was built from, or use a tarball from kernel.org, which will also
work nicely, and may work better with external patches and drivers.

Not really.  ALSA emulates OSS so you don't have to change your
programs.  You'll need module-init-tools, that's about it.  Best way
is to install kernel-image-2.6 and see how it works.

You can config however you like--xconfig, menuconfig, whatever.
If you want a Debian package for your kernel, just install
kernel-package and from the kernel tree, do :
  make-kpkg --rootcmd fakeroot kernel_image

Have fun,

In my nearly-humble opinion, Fedora is good if you are a seasoned Red Hat 
admin and don't mind working around the broken bits. Because Fedora always 
has broken bits.

Have you looked at any of the RHEL derivatives? Quite a number of folks are 
grabbing the RHEL SRPMs and rolling their own RHEL clones:

I'll chime in that FC3 needs some settling in.  FC2 has worked OK for
me so far, though.

I feel dumb asking this, but, I bought a cheap IDE removeable drive
tray from Fry's today without thinking too much about it.  This is for
my home computer, I just want to be able to swap a second hard drive 
in and out, for backups and stuff.  There's no way this would be hot
swap-able, right?  I mean, I'm thinking in Linux I could just unmount
it, turn the key (which turns of the power) and slide it right out,
but something tells me that probably isn't going to work.  Does anyone
know for sure?

Not supposed to be hot-swappable, but if it's on its own channel and
you use the hdparm -R/-U/-w commands, you may be able to hot-swap
without immediately crashing your system.

Since IDE wasn't designed for it, you also run a small risk of
damaging the controller or drive.

In other words: might work, don't do it with anything valuable.

I have used umount and then removing the drive OK, but IDE controllers
generally are not designed to allow restarting the drive. You can get IDE
PCI cards that do support hot swap. I have tried (just curious) to hot start
a drive and some of the time the system locks up. The rest of the time,
provided the drives are identical, it worked. To use a different drive
requires changing the drive parameters, which if you get them wrong is
a great way to FUBAR the data. 

It is much easier to do this with SATA or SCSI, even some of the on-board
controllers support hot swap.

What I am using now is a external USB box I bought that uses an IDE hard
drive. Got it from Neutron Express for $33-$34. If you want to use it on a
laptop you will need an external power supply.

So, my DVDROM drive is hanging open.  No idea how long it's been that way.
Could be months.  I tried to put it back in and it just spits right back
out again.  This happens whether it's got a disc or not.

If I put a DVD disc in there and then run something like

mplayer DVD://1

then it takes in the disc and spits it out again with this in the output
of mplayer (as well as in syslog):

sr1: CDROM not ready.  Make sure there is a disc in the drive.
cdrom: open failed.

Tres frustrating.  I fear the hardware has failed, but I'd like to exhaust
software possibilities.

`sg_reset /dev/sg1` appears to do nothing.

Anyone?

Bryan,

Why don't you buy a USB 2.0 external drive enclosure.  You can mount the
drive in directly or mount your drive drawer.  You can "hot swap" by
disconnecting the USB, swap drive drawers and plug the USB back in.  I
suggest that you power down the drive enclosure before drive swapping
however.

What brand DVD drive? I have seen a couple of Toshiba's do this when 
when of the switches inside the drive failed. This usually means that 
the drive is toast.

Have you cycled power on the drive?  What happens if you power up the drive
with the controller cable disconnected?

I recently went to the thrift store since I couldn't bring myself to
pay $30 for a new IDE CD-ROM going into a secondary PC.  For $10 I
picked up two, both of which worked great.  I could also feel good
that my money was going towards something helpful instead of into the
coffers of Fry's.

Now I just need to find a way to free up a few Saturday mornings so I
can go help 'em build some PCs.

I've seen Free Geek mentioned many times on this list and it finally sunk 
into the grey-matter that this is exactly what we need up here in the 
Coeur d'Alene, ID and Spokane, WA area.
   We've had several discussions at our user group ( North Idaho Linux
Users Group -- NILUG ) about recycling computers.  I saw on the about 
page that Free Geek does Oregon and the World :-) so I'm wondering if 
there is anyway we can cooperate.
   I have a garage sale planned for this spring ( going to be advertised
as "Guy Stuff" ) with the proceeds going to a local non-profit /
not-for-profit I provide other support to (North Idaho Communities ONline 
- nicon.org ).  This will work for a one off but there is a lot of old 
semi-usable computers floating around here that could use a more permanent 
process.

So I'm looking for any suggestions.

Go to http://lists.freegeek.org/listinfo and sign up on the startup list
and introduce yourself. Of course, this will pull you over the event
horizon and you will end up starting a local Free Geek. ;)

Thanks.  I'm in the process of doing this right now.  A local Free Geek
doesn't hurt my feelings at all.  Anything to keep the stuff out of the
land fill.  The means and the ends don't conflict at all.

Bryan:  Not a dumb question at all.  Only the subject line "dumb
hardware question" was dumb (irrelevant and insufficent information),
but then, you warned us.  In the future, skip the self-deprecation,
(you are no dummy, you are here, aren't you?) concentrate on "direct
and informative".  On to your question ...

IDE hotswap is indeed possible, but only with the later 2.4.X series
of kernels.  Alan Cox put code in there to permit live hotswap of IDE
drives;  the 2.5.X and 2.6.X kernel folk took it back out again.  I
think they did it to impress Jodie Foster.

With a 2.4.X kernel from late 2003 or 2004, such as RH9 or Fedora Core 1
(not 2 or 3!) you can do this:

   umount /dev/hde   (for example)
   hdparm  -b 0 /dev/hde
   (turn key, pull drive, insert drive, turn key)
   hdparm -zb 1 /dev/hde
   mount  /dev/hde  /mnt/tempdrive

The "hdparm" instruction tristates the bus that the drive is on, to
protect it from damage.  You should only have one drive on the cable.  
The "z" for the re-attach is important, it tells the kernel to rebuild
the drive parameter table, which is otherwise left over from the previous
drive.

The kernel developers will probably remain fixated on Jodie Foster, or
the little voices in their heads, rather than users or Alan Cox, so
don't count on this being fixed in 2.6.X any time soon.  Meanwhile, a
more modern way to do this is to follow wamorita's suggestion and use
a USB2 enclosure, where hot swap is supported.  The problem with the
USB2 approach is that a significant number of the chipsets are not
properly supported by the kernel, and external drives will hang for
minutes in the middle of transfers.  Two known-bad enclosures are the
Maxtor USB2 enclosure, and the Sanmax InClose USB2 enclosures at Fry's.
A known-good enclosure is the ViPower, which unfortunately is a little
hard to find;  you may find it at ENU, or you may have to mail-order
some of these.  Go for the slide switch rather than the key switch!

I gave a talk on using swappable hard drives for backups at the March
2004 PLUG meeting;  I will be presenting an updated version of that
talk to PANUG later this month, and to the Oregon IEEE Consultant's
Network (members.eeconsult.org).  Some of the information can be found
at www.keithl.com/linuxbackup.html, and some can be found in a three
part article about dirvish, starting with the January 2005 Sys Admin
magazine, available at Powell's Technical and other places.

I hope that answers your question in effusive detail.  Note the change
in subject line - my answer will be in the PLUG email archives forever,
and I want other Googlers to be able to find it!

Ha. 

No, We are moving to a country whose ideals and values better reflect
our own. With the added bonus of fully funded schools, universal health
care, a sane foreign policy, and a functional democracy. Plus, no
Christian/Muslim/Hindu/Zoroastrian Taliban.

I'm looking for FOSS work in the Vancouver area, preferable in the
not-for-profit sector.

Peace,

Wow, thanks for a very complete answer, specially the tips on avoiding
the wrong USB2 enclosures, I never would have thought those pitfalls
existed.  I will definitely check out your articles.

Subject: [PLUG] Rebuilding software RAID after disk failure
Message-ID: <9e0a3578050104134376e371f4@mail.gmail.com>

I have a RedHat 7.2 server with two disks that was setup with software
RAID level 1.  One of the disks failed and was replaced.  There are
three partitions, root, data, and the swap partition.  Now I'm trying
to rebuild the array.  Using the info in /etc/raidtab, I tried to
rebuild the md0 array with this command:

raidhotadd /dev/md0 /dev/sdb2
/dev/md0: can not hot-add disk: invalid argument.

This is a new disk so /dev/sdb2 doesn't exist yet.  So I assume that I
need to partition it first and then run raidhotadd?  If so, how do I
give the new disk the same parition info as the other disk?

Out of curiosity, I ran the following command and it worked, but
/proc/mdstat shows that the entire new disk was used for md0:

raidhotadd /dev/md0 /dev/sdb

But when I try to remove sdb with raidhotremove /dev/md0 /dev/sdb, I get:

/dev/md0: can not hot-remove disk: disk busy!

Here's my /etc/raidtab:

raiddev             /dev/md1
raid-level                  1
nr-raid-disks               2

Well, considering that you've got on a couple partitions, you could write
down the geometry from 'fdisk -l /dev/sda'.  Alternatively, you can use
'sfdisk' to dump the geometry from one and restore on the other.  Then you
call raidhotadd.

I got to take a bit more time at this.  I never saw any of this stuff but 
I was flying through the site pretty fast.  I'm hoping to get a plan 
together before the next LUG meeting up here.

Thanks for the pointer.

It is, in fact, a Toshiba.

But what switch would make the tray come back out and say the drive's not
ready?

And why would it be toast?  I've replaced and "repaired" microswitches
before with really great results.  My minidisc deck, for example, kept
telling me there was no disc and wouldn't eject or play or anything.  I
pulled the thing apart, wrapped some electrical tape around the little
lever arm that pressed the switch to make it press even further... work
like bear-bone charm.

I'm going to move on to Galen's suggestions and report back.

From: Josh <josh at naked-ape.com>

The Portland Perl Mongers are giving Lightning Talks, January 12th, 2004
6:30pm at Free Geek, 1741 SE 10th Ave

Feel free to sign up to give a lightning talk on the sign-up sheet,
http://pdx.pm.org/kwiki/

What is a Lightning Talk?

About Lightning Talks

Q: What is a lightning talk?

Any Perlish or geekish lecture, rant, speech, poem, droll witticism, or
(hopefully) constructive criticism that you can fit into N MINUTES (where
N usually equals 5, 8, 10 or 15).

Q: Who talks?

You do!

Q: Why would you want to do this?

(Copied from Perl Paraphernalia verbatim; minor edits)

Maybe you've never given a talk before, and you'd like to start small. For
a Lightning Talk, you don't need to make slides, and if you do decide to
make slides, you only need to make four.

Maybe you're nervous and you're afraid you'll mess up. It's a lot easier
to plan and deliver a eight minute talk than it is to deliver a long talk.
And if you do mess up, at least the painful part will be over quickly.

Maybe you don't have much to say. Maybe you just want to ask a question,
or invite people to help you with your project, or boast about something
you did, or tell a short cautionary story. These things are all
interesting and worth talking about, but there might not be enough to say
about them to fill up thirty minutes.

Maybe you have a lot of things to say, and you're already going to give a
long talk on one of them, and you don't want to hog the spotlight. There's
nothing wrong with giving several Lightning Talks. Hey, they're only eight
minutes.

Q: What do I talk about?

Why not take a look at prior lightning talks? A sampling:

Here's a list of the talks from last time we did this:

    * Allison Randal - On her upcoming book, Perl 6 Essentials
    * Annett Sullivan - Perl and Water Quality (with GD animations!)
    * Jeff Zucker - Everything is database. Nothing is database
    * Josh Heumann - Perljxta, an implementation of Sun's JXTA P2P protocols
    * Michael G. Schwern - MakeMaker Is Doomed
    * Brian Ingerson - Two Tails of OOP Adventures in Data-Driven Design
    * Brian Ingerson - Lightn-ingy Strikes Twice
    * Ben Marcotte - From the Dark Side Back to the Light How having to
use Win32::TieRegistry led to experimenting with "hierarchical" hashes
    * Clint Moore - Experiences Gained From Working Alone on a Large Project

There are even more examples at Perl Paraphernalia.

Q: I still have questions! Mark-Jason probably answers your question on
Perl Paraphernalia's "Lightning Talks" page: http://perl.plover.com/lt/

Message-ID: <86vfac2ogu.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


Remember the box with the serial console I was talking about the other
day?  Well, it has taken to (apparently) shutting itself off in the
middle of the night.  The three times it has occurred were all during
a scsi DAT tape backup.  Three crashes for three tape backup attempts
since Jan 1.  So far, I haven't captured anything from the serial
console, but that is probably next.  Seems to run during the day as a
Samba server with no problems.  Unfortunately, I don't have access to
the building at night, so have to wait until morning for a manual
power cycle.

The descriptions I am getting are that there are LED lights on the
back (associated with the RJ45 ethernet jack), but no fan noise and
apparently shutdown.  The box reboots (with fan noise) after a power
cycle.  Other devices plugged into the same UPS give the appearance of
not having lost power.  Somewhat baffled.  The machine, identical
except for a new HD, had just been up for 280 days straight and made
innumerable tape backups.  I had upgraded the kernel from 2.4.25 to
2.4.28, but just downgraded again to check and got the same "crash".

This is on an Intel D815 motherboard.

Any ideas?

Hi,

We had similar symptoms from an underpowered box.  Problem solved with a
higher wattage power supply.

Sometimes it's not just the wattage, but the quality: I had a 430W
supply, good brand too (Antec), and I started to have crashes, more
when PC was busy doing something, especially with disks. Then I
started having disk errors on boot. So I started testing disks one by
one and noticed that I never have errors with just one disk, but with
more disks I get more errors. I checked voltages in BIOS, they were
low (12V was only about 11.2). So I got an Enermax supply, 450W,
almost the same power, but from the high end of their line. Stable
voltages, and no more crashes.

Hmm.  That's something I hadn't considered.  On the surface, it
doesn't seem likely, since I just removed two disks and only put one
back in, so you'd think the load would be less now than before,
however, it be a dodgy connection or a failing power supply.  Right
now, I'll grasp at just about anything.  I am going to see if I can
catch an oops tonight, and if nothing appears, I'll look more closely
at the power supply.

This is just a plain-jane Intel P3 motherboard with integrated video,
lan, and sound.  The only PCI card in it is an old NCR SCSI and it has
one hard disk and a floppy.  The power supply is probably just 250W
(or maybe 300W) and has been chugging along reliably for about 3 or 4
years.  The tape drive is external, and the only thing on the SCSI bus.

With all of the glowing comments about Debian on this list I just had to
switch my Dell C800 from dual boot XP/FC1 to XP/Debian. Currently I have
beat it into submission except for wireless, which I haven't been able to
get working. Where I am at:

- Sarge with kernel 2.6.8 using netinstall
- the card is a Linksys WPC11 ver. 3
- built in ethernet works fine.
- lsmod shows, among other things: orinco_cs, orinco, hermes, ds
- cardinfo shows the card in socket 1 and ready
- ifconfig doesn't show the interface
- the GUI Network Administration tool under Add doesn't list the card.

Google has turned up several things to try - some of which appear to my
"noobie" eye to contradict each other. I have tried to install the driver
from Linksys which looks like the wlan-ng driver that I also tried. I did
find references that said to avoid those drivers with this kernel. 


Thank you for any tips, pointers or clues

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0501051528400.12018@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   A fellow in Alabama posted a request for help on the SQL-Leger mail list
and mentioned that he was in transition from Maytech on SCO-UNIX to
SQL-Ledger on linux for his paper distribution business.

   Being the curious sort I wrote and asked if he was leaving SCO for linux
all-together. He replied that he is; that from what he's learned he thinks
it's in his best interests. For comparison, he told me that the previous
owner paid $33,000 for the Maytech accounting/inventory software, plus $425
per month. Now they're raising the monthly protection payment to $550 and
he's decided that's enough.

   I have been wondering if the mad-SCO disease is causing existing customers
to abandon the company and, at least this one is. I thought it was
interesting and worth while sharing with you. And, look at the cost savings!

If this kind of thing is frowned on, lemme know, and I'll attend the public
flogging..

Three questions:

1)  How did he end up with so many of them?
2)  Why does he need to "unload" them?
3)  What kind are they?

Take that in any order you like.  :-)

	The company he works for manufactures computers locally. They got a
pallet of monitors that needed new power button boards. They can't sell them
as new, so they've lowered the price to get rid of them.

See above.

I have a linksys wireless-g card and found that no linux drivers even exist for this card.  Though I still haven't done it, what I'll need to do is load ndiswrapper which will, supposedly, allow me to use the wintel binary drivers.

You may have to go a similar route.  If so, try googling "ndiswrapper" and linksys. I found a couple of forums where folks gave step-by-step instructions.

This looks like a job for ndiswrapper <http://ndiswrapper.sf.net>. I
have had my troubles with it in the past on Gentoo (works fine now), but
it has worked flawlessly in my limited experience with Debian (Knoppix,
actually). Although, I don't have the same card as you.

ndiswrapper is a kernel module (with a userspace configure utility) that
lets you use Windows wireless drivers on Linux. I looked up your card on
the ndiswrapper's wiki and the closest match I found was for the WPC11
ver. 4. Do a `lspci -n` and if '1186:3300' is listed, this should work.

The chipset in your card is a RealTek and they provide Linux drivers for
the 2.4.x kernel and a few variations of Windows. The chipset I use (TI
1130) only works with the XP drivers and ndiswrapper but YMMV. Aside
from a normal ndiswrapper setup, to use the good RealTek driver, you
need to go out of your way and modify an .INF file packaged with the
driver: <http://www.xs4all.nl/~bsamwel/dwl-510-on-linux-2.6.html>

Good Luck!

Note that ndiswrapper only works for 32bit versions of Linux.  It is not
an option if you are using a 64 bit kernel.  (Like the one on my laptop
with the broadcomm wireless chipset.)

Oddly enough, I haven't yet been able to play .mid
files on Sarge. I have a Creative Labs PCI512 and
sound is generally working.

Kmid reports that it can't access /dev/sequencer
(which exists) and that another device is using it. I
have no idea what it means. (The error message here
causes a funny noise to play.)

TiMidity has been my strength and refuge on other UNIX
clones, including SuSE and FreeBSD. When I install it
using apt-get, however, what do I get? It's looking
for a freepats.cfg file in /etc/timidity that's not
there, and what I thought was a default file I found
on the Web doesn't work. I'm not particular about
which application I use, but the compactness of .mid
files encourages their widespread use, and I don't
want to be without this functionality.

Should work with the linux-wlan-ng drivers, which are in Sarge.
Unfortunately, those are only compiled against the 2.4 kernel.  
I run 2.6 and compile my own from: 
ftp://ftp.linux-wlan.org/pub/linux-wlan-ng/


Good luck,

It came back with "unrecognized wireless request up" 
Entering iwconfig showed the wireless card on eth2. I tried making an entry

I don't know if this changes anything but I believe the ver.3 uses a Prism
chipset. The same card Ver.4 changed to the RealTek chipset.

It does work when booting with Knoppix (Helix with kernel 2.6.7) One
difference is the wlan-ng entries in the /pcmcia directory. I suppose this
means that I will need to compile them as Aaron suggested. I tried earlier
but didn't get it working. 

To compile it requires a "configured kernel source" - completely new
territory for me and where I think my previous attempt failed. Looks like I
will be back into the DOCs unless there is a good shortcut for getting this
done.

An OT note - I have been lurking on the list for awhile but this is my first
post. Thanks to everyone who responded.

Try `/usr/sbin/lsof /dev/sequencer` to find out what has it open.

If you do not have lsof installed, you should.  it is a very useful
debugging tool.

   This is admittedly a little off-topic, but a friend of mine is trying to

wouldn't touch, but they are also roughly half-price with a 90 day
manufacturer warranty. I picked up two of them myself, and my work picked
about six of them.

They run about $225. We've got about 20 of them left..

Here is a comparison of some LCDs:

Costco has 17" new LCDs $250-$300:

Pacific Solutions carries the CTL 7Tx  for $299 new:

Planar, a local mfgr of LCDs, just ended a holiday factory refurb sale with good prices:
$249 was the best 17" LCD price there:   http://www.planar.com/sale/about_sale.html 

It looks like the CTL refurbs are priced fairly.

If you are still struggling with it in another week or so, bring it to
the clinic (every third saturday, this month the 15th).

I've got one of your cards (it is a prism-based version, and a Proxim
Rangelan and a Senao), and use the hostap drivers.

I didn't change *anything* in the BIOS on the box and it was just up
for 280 days straight.  And of course, without a monitor I can't
confirm what the BIOS settings are.

I got to four-for-four this evening, but it failed early enough that I
was able to get in and take a look.  No oops.  I was able to confirm
lack of fan noise.  The reset button did nothing.  The front panel
switch did nothing.  I had to power off with the power supply rocker
switch and then back on to get it to come back up.

I tried to get it to fail while I was watching, by running the tape
forwards and backwards while running bonnie, etc, but naturally it was
fine then.  It's been up for about 4 hours now, rerunning a tape
backup, so maybe I'll shatter my perfect record just to make diagnosis
even less tractable.

I even shut off the power going to the UPS, and the UPS held it up
fine for the 20 seconds or so of my test.

If I can't think of anything else, maybe I'll try the power supply.
And given the symptoms, it seems plausible, but what is the trigger??
why doesn't it fail all the time rather than just in the middle of the
night?  A little voodoo here and there is acceptable, but please, no
one suggest that I defragment my hard disk.

Nope.  5 for 5.  It is not *just* night, it is seems to be something
to due with running the tape backup.  It survived the first night when
there was no backup run.  Every night (during the tape backup, though
not at any consistent point) since then it has spontaneously powered
off.

If there is no oops this time, I guess we'll have to try a new power
supply.

I have an ssh tunnel that I use for piping mail to my laptop over a wifi

It stopped working, giving me weird errors about bind not being able to
bind the port.  (But not telling me which end of the tunnel it could not
bind.)

It turns out "lo" had gotten unbound from 127.0.0.1 and had to be
reconnected.

I have seen this happen once before.

I have no clue why it happens.  It causes all sorts of subtle nastiness
when it does.

/sbin/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
route add -host 127.0.0.1 lo

fixed the problem.

I had heard a rumor that Comcast was switching to Giganews for their
newsfeed.  Had not confirmed it since I will not buy Internet service
from them.  (And I will drop them for cable when I can afford to get

Also try running memtest86 and see if there is some memory problem that

Are there any other devices on the scsi chain? Could it be a bad scsi
card?  Any errors left in the /var/log/messages?  Are you logging kernel
messages with syslog?

As a subscriber you should have gotten spam from Comcast saying they

Harlan,

   Darn! Well, I'm far from being an expert on WiFi. I know just enough to be
dangerous. I know there are better qualified folks here.

   If this is a portable machine, consider bringing it to the clinic on the

If iwconfig has it listed, then you are almost there.  A correct entry
in /etc/network/interfaces should do it.  What didn't work about it?
How are you testing?  What kind of setup are you trying to do?

Subject: [PLUG] Tape Drives and Power Supplies ( was strange crashes ... )
Message-ID: <20050106160754.GA18405@gate.kl-ic.com>


Russell Senior is having problems with his computer during tape backups.
The power supply VERY likely is the problem, but the tape drive may also
be the problem.  And it WILL behave strangely.  I have seen system 
failures because of tape drives, at odd times in odd ways.

Unless a tape drive is designed specifically with power supply
friendliness in mind, it is probably the nastiest power load in your
box.  The problem is that it takes a heap of energy to get a spool full
of tape moving.   Motors have a phenomena called "slip", which is 
where the rotating magnetic field moves but the mechanical part isn't
moving as fast.  Worst case is when the motor is just starting.
Electically, a stopped motor has infinite slip and looks like a dead
short, and if the tape drive designer is clueless, they will connect
this shorted motor directly to the 12V supply, causing large currents
to flow during startup, limited only by the circuit and wiring resistance.

Another way to think about it for a motor is that current causes force,
velocity causes voltage.  That is why the lights dim when a refrigerator
motor stops up from zero velocity;  it thinks it is a short circuit.
And that is why "green" motor controllers are cool - these electronic
gizzies convert high-voltage low-amp grid power to low-voltage high-amp
motor startup power, improving efficiency and reducing voltage sag.

What this means to your debugging process is that the amount of tape on
each spool will affect the inertia of the tape, and hence the time and
acceleration and force and voltage and current drawn.  So depending on
where the tape is on the spool, it may fail or not.  Combined, of course,
with the power draw for the CPU and everything else, which is dependent
on what kinds of computation it is doing.  And whether the heads are
seeking on the hard drive.  Etc.  Etc.

Even worse, something in that cabinet could be close to failure.  One 
of the power transistors in a motor controller or a drive servo could
be partly shorted, and drawing a lot of excess current during some
motion operation.  

And if that wasn't enough, there is a question of power regulation. 
Historically, PC power supplies were made to regulate on only one
supply (usually 5V), and the 12V and other supplies were left to flop
around in tandem with the power needs of the 5V supply.  So if the
5V power draw jumped from 10 amps to 20 amps, the power supply would
work harder, and cause the +12V supply to increase voltage a little
bit (or a large bit) as a result.  The power supply would make little
response to a 12V power surge, besides sagging.  I assume more modern
supplies are not as "5V centric".

And to add insult to injury, there is the "winter" problem.  Remember
the power sag associated with motor starts?  That happens with your
furnace motor, too.  When it kicks in early in the morning, while the
tape drive is starting and stopping and the heads are thrashing and
the CPU is calculating MD5 checksums and the like, the power surges and
voltage sags added together can cause some power supplies to give up.

The solution to all these problems is to GET A BIGGER POWER SUPPLY.
*Especially* a bigger supply on the 12V rail, which is the one that
gets all the power variation from tape drive and head seek motors.
MORE AMPS!

Then, if there IS a problem with excess power draw in a failing
motor controller circuit, it will have less effect on power supply
operation.  It also means that power will be available to finish
toasting any balky power transistors on your drives, making further
debugging easy - look for smoke!

Here's one other possibility, albeit unlikely.  Has someone changed the
thermostat?  Higher temperatures combined with a weak PS might be 
causing the problem.  I agree with Keith.  It's time to swap the supply.

For a number of years, I've been hand building my web sites with a text

I will soon want to post it to one of my Comcast sites. I recall from previous

don't recall what is preferred. From the list archives I see mentions of

Command-line FTP is really obnoxious, IMO, unless you're scripting something. 
A nice graphical client is fast and easy. I like gftp, though you'll probably 
find there are a lot of good FTP clients. gftp has a bookmark feature that 
lets you saves your logins, and automatically switches to whatever local 
directory you like. A nice timesaver. gftp also supports SSH and HTTP 
transfers.

Dick,

   I've used only ncftp and it's great. You can automate 'puts' and 'gets',
take up where a download left off and more. Stable, solid, secure and highly
functional.

Hi all,

 Just a quick question as to what firewall software or iptables scripts
you all recommend. I am looking to upgrade one of my machines to a 2.6
kernel and I think I have evolved enough that I dont need to have any X
programs running on the new system. I want to get rid of that GUI
crutch... ;)

 I currently use a really nice KDE program called guarddog along with
guidedog for ip masquerading and I dont want to lose the granularity
that I have with these. I have been doing a little reading and gshield
seems to get a bit of press. 

 Any recommendations would be great.

Thanks everyone!

If you're using Kate, you're probably using KDE, right? There's a
fantastic IDE for web projects called Quanta, written by a Portlander
even. I just updated to 3.3.1 yesterday, but I've been using it for
about 4 years and it just keeps getting better. 

One of the features it inherits from KDE is the ability to load and save
project files (HTML, scripts, CSS, etc.) via any installed kioslave. I
use the 'fish' kioslave (ssh/scp) almost exclusively, but one client
requires the use of ftp.

It's not the ftp program that is a problem, it's the ftp protocol,
specifically cleartext logins and the requirement for PASV connections
from behind a NAT router. Some NAT routers handle the FTP connections
better than others...

If Comcast only supports FTP, it doesn't matter what you use. I think
you can use fish in the file save dialog on Kate if they support ssh, or
ftp if they don't.

E.g. file/save as, in the 'Location' box enter
ftp://my.comcast.server/dir/path/file.html and save it. Easy.

I'll second the ncftp client.  My only real gripe is its semi-commercial nature.

I particularly like "ncftpget" which is a non-interactive file
fetcher.  I'm also quite fond of its batch scheduled downloads.

A nice thing about ncftp is that you can build a Makefile to send over
only the files that have changed since you last updated. You'll have to
have a shell open, but that shouldn't be a problem, right?

By using 'touch -r file .filedep' (replace 'file' with the filename) you
can set up a rule that copies only changed files. 

Makefiles are not just for C code...

Well, if it is high temperatures then I can rule that out.  I was

The only problem with this scenario I see is that the tape drive is an
external unit and it is being powered independently from the computer,
but it is the computer that is powering "off".  Is it plausible that a
problem in the tape drive could affect the box across the SCSI bus
(through an external cable)?  After a few hours of tape operation?

I am not against swapping out the power supply, as it might have
incidental benefits, but the more you describe the scenario where it
might be the problem, the less it seems to match my observables.

Russell Senior and his amazing disappearing computer continued ...


Although Russell's problem sounds like the PC power supply, another 
source of strange crashes in the early morning that appears this time
of year is weak batteries on the UPS.  We discussed this source of
"scheduled" crashes on the PLUG list about this time last year.

The cause is similar; power line sags from furnace blowers turning on. 
The specific pathway is different - the sags cause the UPS to kick in,
attempting to draw battery power that is no longer there due to weak
batteries.  You can test for this - make sure your whole computer
setup is properly grounded, and your UPS is connected to power through
a switched power strip.  Turn off the power strip.  See what happens.

Rich led a recent discussion about the replacement of UPS batteries.
Refer to that if you end up needing replacements.

- - - - -

BTW, this is an opportunity to write a bit of useful software.  PC
laptops can sense when the AC adapter is no longer providing power,
and this information is available to the O.S., causing a switchover
from charge to discharge mode.  So if the line power sag is extreme,
enough to trip the switchover, the exact time of the event can be
logged.  With my thinkpad T30 laptop, this effect can be enhanced. 
The T30 is designed for a 72W AC adapter, but it is plug compatable
with the 35W adapters for older Thinkpads.  When the power even flickers
using one of those old adapters, it toggles the switchover on the PC. 
Quite distressing to watch, clicking in and out 5 times a minute, with
the power-saver on the screen dimming and brightening ...

   Germane to this point: anyone want to purchase a brand-new RBC-4 for an
APC UPS for $27 (my cost)? (Gawd, aren't acronyms great?) It was the UPS
electronics that went, not the battery. Unfortunately, I cannot use that in
my Back-UPS 600 because it has two, 6V batteries rather than the one, 12V
battery in the Back-UPS Pro 650. Sigh. Anyway, a refurbished Smart-1400
(950W) UPS is on its way to me; all 60 pounds worth.

I have a client in NC who would like to finish his move from 
SCO/Unixware to Linux but can not find reasonable replacements for a few 
of his current SCO/Unixware apps.

The recent SCO behaviour, to the extent he is aware of it, has increased 
his motivation to finish; perhaps more accurately, increased his 
frustration with not being able to finish, the move.

I've almost convinced him he should bite-the-bullet and migrate his LEX 
wordprocessing, macros, and boiler-plate to OpenOffice or WordPerfect on 
Linux.

I have not, however, been able to find a nice way to migrate his 
Informix SE (v4.x) and SCO Integra database applications.  The problem 
is not the databases themselves. He has Oracle and MySQL databases 
running on his Linux server.  The problem is he really needs a means to 
migrate the ton of Informix/Integra forms and reports.  He just can not 
afford the time/money required to rewrite all this. Ideally, he wants to 
run a Linux version/replacement of Informix and/or Integra that would 
only require recompiling and minor fixes to get things working.

Any advice, war-stories, etc. greatly appreciated.

Huh.  Well, one theory all shot to hell ... ;-)

Check the note I just sent out about UPS battery failures.  While a
voltage sag in the tape box can lock up the SCSI bus (I have seen that
happen), I've never seen it take out the whole OS.  Unless your disks
are on the same SCSI bus, too, in which case all sorts of nonsense
can result.

Associated story of tapes in external boxes:  I have a largish heap
of old DC300/DC600 cartridge tapes, with lots of tiny little backup 
images on them.  To copy them onto disk, I built "tapezilla", an
external box with 4 half-height drives in it.  The power supply in
the box was designed for one tape and one disk.  I found I could only
reliably read two tape drives at once - three or more would sag the
supply and hang the SCSI bus.  The connected Linux box stayed up 
just fine after the SCSI hang, though it needed to be power-cycled
to clear the hang.

Randall,

   Not advice, but suggestions. Python has a module that integrates with
postgres; not sure about the others. It also has a selection of UI
development tools. There is also gambas <http://gambas.sourceforge.net/>, a
better Visual Basic for linux that can be used to develop forms and reports.
Unfortunately, it will cost time and/or money to move to anything other than
what he has.

   For a word processor, go with OO.o. The last I read, Microsoft bought a
stake in Corel to help save the company, insisted that WP/Linux be killed,
then pulled their financial interest out. Classic Microsoft. OO.o is the
future for an office suite.

> P.S. Anyone know if LEX runs on Linux? :)  Anyone remember LEX? :)

   No and no.

For what it's worth, I tried exactly this (I think this was even
during a tape operation) and got nary a flicker on the computer or the
tape drive.

The tape drive *is* plugged into the same rather small UPS (an APC
Backup-UPS ES 500, I think), so it is possible that some high-torque
tape operation plausibly could overload the UPS and kill the computer.
Wouldn't that be likely to blow a fuse in the tape drive though?  We
are planning to try to swap in a different tape drive (another Seagate
STD624000N) and see what comes out the other side.

On the other hand, I repeatedly ran 'mt -f /dev/nst0 fsf 1 ; mt -f
/dev/nst0 rewind' last night while I was there and nothing nefarious
occurred.

What's to prevent him from running them under iBCS or Linux-ABI?
Library licensing issues?

Are you running a firewall on a separate box?

I recommend ipcop (www.ipcop.org). It has minimal hardware requirements, 
configures with a web based gui, and just generally runs once it's set 
up. On top of that, it's linux, and you have full control through ssh if 
you so desire. It's in active development, so updates are coming out as 
needed.

One of the advantages of a firewall distribution is that it's ONLY a 
firewall. It's not trying to be a print/file/mail/etc server as well. 
Services don't belong on a firewall. :)

I've been using it for over a year now.

Russ

Russ,

  Well that definitely helps. One of my tasks in the coming months is to
crate a firewall to temporarily replace our pix while we upgrade it. I
will take a look sounds like it would be a great solution for that
problem.
  However the unit I want to upgrade will be housing at the very least
an asterisk server in addition to being a firewall... Probably not the
most secure idea but its a machine that I can gamble with..
  Thanks for the link I will go check it out.

IBM now owns Informix, and way before then, Informix was, if I recall,
the first big database vendor that had Linux versions of their products.

Is Integra a SCO product specifically, or third party? Has your customer
looked to see if there might actually be a Linux version of it?

Does guarddog create scripts for iptables?  Read 'em and learn.

This rumor is true. I had to configure my stupid windows news reader
with stupid authentication stuff; and it's a giganews feed. You get a
free gigabyte of transfer as a comcast client, you're cut off from the
feed after that (for the month).

Subject: [PLUG] Using variables for procmail matches
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0501061615420.6841-100000@gisnet.com>

I'm trying to get a Procmail recipe to use a variable in the match
expression, but I can't seem too get it to expand correctly. It works with
egrep (which is what I thought Procmail uses), but I can't make it work in 
Procmail. Here's a short example:

# This recipe is supposed to catch any mail that has the string "pills" 
# in it, with the 'i' spelled in any one of the spammish variations.

FILT_=[i1jl:\!|]
:0:
* 1^0 HB ?? p${FILT_}lls
TESTFOLDER


But it doesn't seem to work. It appears that it is comparing against the 
literal string "p{FILT_}lls", not the string "p[i1jl:\!|]lls" 

This doesn't work either:

FILT=p[i1jl:\!|]lls
:0B:
* $FILT_
TESTFOLDER

How do I get it to expand that FILT_ variable?

I've searched the man pages (procmailrc, procmailsc, procmailex, etc.) and
tried various combinations of "procmail match variables" on Google, but I
think I don't know how to search for this because I don't know the
terminology.

I'm using Procmail 3.22 on RH 9.

Can anyone here help?

TIA,

I think that's a pretty broad statement, some of the command line

I've found it to be one of the better command line clients and very 
flexible.

Bill,

   The metacharacter '.*' should match 0 or more of anything. I'd try:
                                    p[.*]ll

That will catch pull, poll, pll, pall, pyll, powerfull, etc.... 

Is that what's wanted?

Actually no. I'm trying to use a variable because I'd rather not hard code
the test string for every occurrence of 'i' spelled sideways, or e (as in
[e3]) or 'o' (as in [o0].)  The reason I'd like to do this with a variable
is so I can change the string easily from one place should I want to...  
and it's less to type if I can get it to work. For example, if I have
variables like:

I_=[i1jl:\!|]
A_=[a at 4]

Then I can use filters like v${I_}${A_}gr${A_}, or even
v.?${I_}.?${A_}.?g.?r.?${A_}, and catch every madly spelled reference to
the little blue quicker dicker upper so I can trash the message
automatically. I don't want to filter too loosely like ".*" would
(although that would work, it would literally be throwing the baby out
with the bath water.)

But I'm not even sure if Procmail allows variable expansion in the match
conditions. Like I said, I've searched and found no reference to that, but
as the lawyers say, "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."

You'll find plenty of online resources that are somewhat less cryptic
than the `man' pages. Here's a start...

I am the one who steered him in this direction. A little over a year ago, I helped move his database from an old Motorola w/ System V to his way overpriced system that he has now running SCO. He got a real bad taste in his mouth after spending so much money on the new system, and the software company couldn't even move his data from one system to another. I had to figure it out for them. You can actually check the archives on PLUG for SysV networking where I was trying to figure it all out. 

Once our test system is fully functional, I will be formating SCO off his drive and installing Debian, then moving all info from the test system. Once the whole project is complete, he will only have one M$ machine to run his FedEx software and that's it. Mission "almost" completed.

The mad-SCO disease definately had an impact on his decision, plus the fact that there was an available solution with in Linux. And yes, his savings will be huge. Even after paying me. :)

Jeff

P.S. I know it doesn't really matter, but if your wondering why someone from Arkansas is on the PLUG list, I actually cut my first teeth on Linux while living in Portland. PLUG was the first list I joined, and I attended several meetings while there.

Yes, but I must not be making myself clear. This works too, no problem:
:0:
* 1^0 HB ?? p[i1jl:\!|]lls
TESTFOLDER

But I don't want it hard-coded. I'm hoping there's a way that I can use a 
varialble for alternate character expressions in square brackets.
Is it possible to set a variable that can be expanded in the match 
expression? Something like the following?

MYVAR=[ilj1:]
:0:
* 1^0 HB ?? p${MYVAR}lls
TESTFOLDER

In reality, the definition of MYVAR will be at the top of a long recipe
and I have several words I'm looking for that need to make one or more
tests for alternate spellings of 'i'.

Keith,

I also have this problem on my T30 when I'm plugged in
at home.  How can you tell which of the AC adapters
you are using?

Thanks.

Okay. Try...

I_='(i|1|j|l|:|!|\|)'
PILL_="P($I_)ll(s)?"
:0:

I thought of that, but it dint work. Same problem. The variable is not 
expanded.

But I *think* I may have found it deep under your Procmail tips page. I'm 
looking at an Aug 25 message from the Procmail mailing list. Here's the 
relevant bit:

That looks like what I'm searching for... I'll know in a few minutes...

Bingo! That's it! Here's how I managed to fix my earlier script.

# This Procmail script will catch all messages with the string 
# "pills" in the body.

# create a varible that contains alternate spellings for 'i'
I_=[i1lj:\!|]

# the '$' by itself in the front of the match expresion
# tells Procmail to expand following variables
:0B:
* 1^0 $ p${I_}lls
TESTFOLDER

Still haven't figured out where to place the '$' in the following (it's 
not all that obvious):
:0:
* 1^0 HB ?? p${I_}lls
TESTFOLDER

But I guess now at least I have a key...

Subject: [PLUG] Perplexing Boot Problem
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0501062009350.3371@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I'd scratch my head over this but I cannot afford the hair loss. My
newish Slackware-10 box boots only part way. That is, only some of the
daemons called to be started by /etc/rc.d/rc.M are; it stops after calling
postfix.

   It doesn't start anything after that (including what's in rc.local). But,
after logging in as boot I can manually start each daemon with no problem.
The file rc.M is attached.

   In the years I've been running linux I've not encountered this. All the
daemons are executable and owned by root.root. As you'll see in rc.M, it is
only executable files that are invoked with the 'start' command.

   Why a text file should execute part of the way, then stop and complete the
boot process to a login prompt is beyond my understanding. This past Monday
I sent a request for help to support at slackware.com but have not seen
anything from anyone there. My experience with comp.os.linux.slackware has
been less than satisfactory. I know that we have the premier group of
SysAdmins here on this list so I would appreciate insight or suggestions
that will lead me to understand what's broken so I can fix it.

Many thanks,

Rich

Is this the normal Slackware rc.M? It's written in an odd way.
The leading dot before each /etc/rc.d/rc.whatever is making rc.M
vulnerable to the rc scripts terminating themselves with an "exit" 
command. If rc.postfix is terminating with an exit that would expain
what you are seeing.

When you start the services manually do you include the leading dot
or not? If not, try it again with the dot and see what happens when
you start postfix. If your shell closes then an exit in rc.postfix
is your problem.

Sorry about the lack of information. I got it working by adding entries in
/etc/network/interfaces:
 auto eth2
 iface eth2 inet dhcp
 name wireless LAN card
 wireless_essid laptop

Then ifconfig eth2 up followed by pump. Even works on the reboot.

Thanks again everybody for all of your help.

Terry,

   It is the normal rc.M, but I added some services toward the end when they
were not picked up in rc.local.

   I noticed the leading dot but have no idea what it means or why it's
there. What do I read to learn about it? Perhaps it should not be there.

   No. I'd just do, for example, '/etc/rc.d/rc.httpd start' and it would.

   OK. I think I'll wait until the new UPS arrives to shutdown and reboot.

Rich

I don't have a slackware box around to help with your problem, but I 
believe the . is the equivalent of  running the command  "source 
some_file", basically it brings in all variables in the script and also 
runs all commands which are included in the script.

David,

   Well then, what's left out when the script is executed without the leading
dot?

   I'm not challenging you, just trying to learn.

With the leading dot the commands are executed within the current shell
process, thus an exit an would cause the script to exit.

Without the dot, the commands are executed in a new child process.  An
exit causes the child to exit, which causes the parent to resume execution
with the next line.

galen,

   I just learned this from reading my ORA bash book (i.e., '.' == 'source')
and information about source. So, this leads to the obvious question: Why
are some daemon startup commands run within the current shell and some in a
subshell?

   Since sourcing the script will cause the shell to exit to a login prompt
when the script is completed, I wonder why this did not happen earlier in
the init process.

   While I'm still trying to grok the rationale for sourcing vs. running in a
subshell during boot, I'll look at rc.postfix and see how that's exiting
that's different from other scripts.

Thanks,

Rich

   Aha! I think that I found the problem. I suspect that the rc.postfix I'm
using was renamed -- by me in my naivety -- from the Red Hat postfix startup
script. D'oh! That will do it.

   Anyone have a gen-u-wine Slackware rc.postfix I can use?

Thanks,

Rich

   Belay that request. I found one. Sigh, I'll bet that's it.

   I'd still like to know why some scripts are sourced and others aren't. Is
there a recommended resource for me to read?

There's no such thing.... Postfix isn't part of Slackware.  :-)

Whatever rc.postfix you may have was written by something who isn't Pat.

Does postfix successfully start?

I see that the script also looks for an rc.sendmail right after postfix.
Is it actually trying to start sendmail, and maybe hanging on that
script since you already have postfix running?

Rob,

   That's true! It was written by Manolis Tzanidakis on 2003-08-28. It came
as a gift when I upgraded the 2.1.4 installed postfix with the 2.1.5
Slackware package from linuxpackages.net. Dummy me didn't compare init
scripts at the time.

Thanks,

Rich

   In /etc/rc.d/, rc.postfix is executable and rc.sendmail is not so the
latter is not invoked. The next test comes next week. My new, replacement
UPS will arrive and I'll let the battery(ies) charge for a day before
shutting down, crawling in the dog fur under the desk and swapping UPSs.
When I fire up the system I suspect that I'll see proper behavior with the
new (and correct) rc.postfix.

   I was looking in the wrong place until it occurred to me this morning to
look in rc.postfix.

Thanks, Stafford,

I would be somewhat careful dealing with lp.net packages.  After
conversing with Jim Simmons, the owner of linuxpackages.net, I really
have to question the quality.

There are no real controls in place.  Jim tests to make sure the
packages are in the format he likes.  The packages are *not* tested to
see if they contain any malicious code.

Additionally, Jim is an old-school script kiddie.  If you have an IRC
client installed, you might sit back and idle on #linuxpackages on
Freenode for a few days... it's rather... enlightening.

At first I didn't realize why he was intent on attacking SlackSec, but
after I got to know him a bit more, I realized it was because we didn't
even think of working together with lp.net, as our mission and
requirements were so different.

If you know and trust the packager from lp.net, great... keep using
it... but just be a bit careful is all.  The best way to install
something in Slackware if it doesn't come on the CDs is to compile it
from source.  :-)

The problem with playing .mid files is the only thing
that really perplexes me. It's not clear to me why
timidity needs to be configured, since it works out of
the box on most platforms.

You source a script when you want it to modify your current shell
and/or environment, for example, setting an environment variable,
set-ing or unset-ing shell options, or adding aliases or functions.  A
script that tries to do any of those for you in a sub-shell that goes
away once the script exits won't be much help to you.

I found out that TiMidity is supposed to have a
configuration file called freepats.cfg in
/etc/timidity. It isn't set up right. I looked into my
FreeBSD partition, which has TiMidity working, but
they must use a different setup. I then downloaded a
freepats.cfg file that doesn't work, and a .mid file
to illustrate the problem. The choice of file was
arbitrary, the first one I came across.

You have to install another Debian package, in
addition to timidity:

apt-get install freepats

If it's Debian, it's not going to be too easy. Anyhow,
I no longer need advice about kmid, although it would
be interesting to know why it doesn't work.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0501071451370.13018@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I built junkbuster-2.0 and tweaked some of the settings in junkbstr.ini.
Then I invoked it with '/usr/local/bin/junkbuster /etc/junkbstr.ini &' and
configured Firefox to use localhost:8000 as the place to listen for the
tool.

   When I try reloading a page I get a message that the proxy is listening on
the wrong socket.

   I've been all through the junkbuster Web site (which seems quite out of
date in a number of areas) without seeing anything helpful. However, it does
say that socks should be disabled, and that's not possible in Firefox-1.0;
one must select either socks-4 or socks-5.

   Does anyone know how to make these two play nicely together?

Thanks,

Rich

Does this site help at all?

In the quick looks that I have made it looks like you
could also have a ~/.timidity.cfg  that would override other things.

Does anyone know of a tool which I can use to read raw sectors from

Am hoping someone can point me to a tool which can accept retrieve

I apologize for the vague references-- if nobody comes up with
something better I'll dig around for more specifics.

I used to use a free tool for DOS that would read a floppy to an
image, bypassing the BIOS for speed.  One of its features was a
configurable number of error retries before giving up.  On moderately
damaged floppies, setting this to a few hundred gave pretty reliable
reads.  Eventually the floppy would be read in such a way that the
embedded ECC would correct the errors.

I can probably find the name of it given a 30-60 minute search through
my Ancient Software collection-- if nobody comes up with something
better.  ;-)

I thought junkbuster had changed into privoxy. If it's similar, you have 
to use port 8118.

Works fine on my debian unstable box.

This would be ultra cool, although it would be much better if there was
something specific for Linux.

I have a similar problem, but on a MUCH larger scale. I have about 40
CD-ROMs that are either suffering from CD rot or the recorder that
burned them was pretty out of alignment. I would REALLY like to get the
data off these CDs, because I have NO other copies of some of the stuff.

Hi Don,

I've never had to do that, but I did some poking around and found this 
mini-Howto:

http://www.praeclarus.demon.co.uk/tech/e2-undel/howto.txt

It mentions a pprogram called fsgrab. I don't think it's exactly what 
you're looking for, but it may work. Maybe not if dd won't, though.

BTW, I found that link at the site for The Coroner's Toolkit, which 
jumped to my mind when I read your message:

http://www.fish.com/tct/

But Lazarus is also more oriented towards recovering deleted data from a 
working disk, I don't think it will be of help to you. It's cool, though :)

Good luck,


Rich

HI,

I've been trying to get Slackware to install from the ISO cd I burned.
The cdrom sees the disc , but won't boot from it.
The Kernel gives an error that it can't find the cdrom, which is SCSI.
I've even tried several different CD -Rom drives, to no avail.
Is there a work around for this, like in the Suse 9.0 case were I built a set of
boot floppies?

TIA,

What about using dd with the options to just read N blocks after skipping 
X number?


       count=BLOCKS
              copy only BLOCKS input blocks
 
       of=FILE
              write to FILE instead of stdout
 
       seek=BLOCKS
              skip BLOCKS obs-sized blocks at start of output
 
       skip=BLOCKS
              skip BLOCKS ibs-sized blocks at start of input

I once did this manually for a whole stack of rotting floppy disks
containing old data transmissions to us.  By manually, I mean I used
dd, but when I found errors I seek'd around them (i.e. started at a
block after the error, usually a multiple of 2 sectors would be bad).

In my recent disk recovery work, I discovered a thing called
dd_rescue.  I initially assumed that it would have the same interface
as dd.  It didn't, but it did the job.  Here's the man page
description:

  dd_rescue is a program that copies data from one file or block
  device to another, it is a tool to help you to save data from
  crashed partition.  It tries to read and if it fails it will go on
  with the next sectors, where tools like dd will fail.  If the
  copying process is interrupted by the user it is possible to
  continue at any position later.  It can copy backwards.

Sounds like just the thing for you.

Try specifying a SCSI capable kernel.
Boot using 'scsi.s' or something, Tab shows you a list of different 
pre-built SCSI kernels you can try, depending on your controller.

Harry,

   This may be a rhetorical question, but did you burn the cd-rom as
bootable? IIRC, that's not standard and it requires an option to be set on
the cdrecord command line.

Hi Brent,
No, this is something different.
As the CD begins the boot of the ISO image, it is not finding the cd drive.
Or atleast that's the way I'm reading the error message.

It is an option to mkisofs, not cdrecord.  See, e.g.:

If you've got iso's, their bootable-ness has already been established
(or not).

I am trying to repartition hda and trying to use QTParted under Knoppix.
The problem I am encountering is that QTParted insists that hda is "busy".
By comparison hdb is not "busy".  
Mount does not show any hda? Mounted.  
I can mount and umount hda1, hda2 and hda3 and this does not change the
"busy" condition of hda.
What am I overlooking????

Subject: [PLUG] Renaming batches of files
Message-ID: <200501080836.54572.rsteff.l@comcast.net>

I have a large number of image files for which I wish to create a consistent 
naming convention whereby I put a date in front of any other part of the 
name. For example, I have a series of pictures, taken on April 28, 2001, near 
Bend, named Crooked-River-Gorge-1.jpg, Crooked-River-Gorge-2.jpg, and so 
forth. What I want is to prepend each filename with the string 20010428-, so 
I'd end up with 20010428-Crooked-River-Gorge-1.jpg, etc.

The tool I learned to use to rename files is mv. However, when I try to rename 
multiple files, mv is not happy with my instructions, telling me that, "when 
moving multiple files, last argument must be a directory"

I tried rename, which never complained about any of the ways I tried to tell 
it to work, but also never did anything.

Is there another command for this kind of procedure? Or do I need to write (or 
find) a script to do it?

I tried rename again, this time using as an example instructions from the 
archives. This command gave me what I wanted:

rename "Crooked-River-Gorge-" "20010428-Crooked-River-Gorge-" *.jpg

Silly question perhaps, but do you have any file managers or any program 
open with something from the drive still showing?

close every program except QTParted

You can use a shell for loop to do them all.  In the example case you described:

for i in Crooked*.jpg
do
   mv $i 20010428-$i
done

If the files are still timestamped with the date they were taken, then
you can do something like this:

$ for i in *.jpg ; do NEWFN=`date -r $i +'%Y%m%d'`-$i ; echo $i ${NEWFN} ; done

When you are certain this is doing what you want, replace "echo" with
"mv" and you'll be done.  You can add a --interactive option to mv if
you want to be prompted before overwriting a file with the new filename.

Salt to taste.

If you're going to go to that length, why not just pull the exif data?

for i in *jpg
do
   NEWFN=`exif -t 0x9003 $i | grep Value: | cut -d\  -f4`-$i
   mv -i $i $NEWFN
done

No relying on memory from when the image was made.

Yeah that's probably better if you've got the exif-pulling software
available; date and mv are pretty ubiquitous.  Although, sometimes
your memory is better than the camera's if the camera's clock is
wrong.  Data recording devices, such as cameras, ought to be equipped
with GPS receivers to get atomic clock time from space, or some other
automatic and robust clock synchronization mechanism.

Frankly, though, prepending the date wouldn't be my preferred method.
Personally, I'd be inclined to retain the original camera-given
filenames and create directories of links (hard or symbolic) to supply
other characterizing information.

Don,

You were right, Knoppix had started using the swap partition (hda3).
So I did a "swapoff /dev/hda3"; exited and restarted QTParted.
Now hda shows as "available", but when selected none of the partitions on
hda enable the resize option.  
They are all primary partitions (hda1-3)and were generated by the default
partitioning in the White Box Linux load.
I still seem to be missing something.  Any suggestions.

I thought it was a shame that you couldn't just ask the exif program to return
a tag value without having to parse a bunch of information.  The grep and cut
in the example I gave above are because the standard exif output for a single
tag request looks like:

   mikeraz at swift:~$ exif -t 0x9003 img_1645.jpg
   EXIF entry 'Date and Time (original)' (0x9003, 'Date and Time (original)') exists in IFD 'EXIF':> Tag: 0x9003 ('DateTimeOriginal')
     Format: 2 ('Ascii')
     Components: 20
     Size: 20
     Value: 2004:07:06 12:19:20
   mikeraz at swift:~$

So I wrote to the program author and he responded quickly:

A prepended date is what the camera uses when naming the files. Actually, it's 
what the download software uses. I haven't tried a different convention as 
yet. I don't have a reader for the kind of memory this camera uses, so I've 
always downloaded using the camera's USB connection. Also, I have yet to 
download to my Linux machine, so I don't know what it would see for a name.

I use a date convention on the directories for my photos, and include 
something about the subject matter. So far, all but a few collections of 
images were made during trips, so the date and the location we visited works 
pretty well for me. I am, as I type, uploading some images to RitzPix for 
printing. I'm doing all those from a folder that has links to images in a 
variety of other folders. The link concept did occur to me, and I'll be using 
that concept for other purposes.

Thanks to all for all the ideas. Now that I've gotten the hang of the rename 
command, it works well for me. It took me a bit to realize that what it 
wanted was two strings and the subset of files on which to work. Once I 
understood that, it was much easier.

HI,

I've been trying to get Slackware to install from the ISO cd I burned.
The cdrom sees the disc , but won't boot from it.
The Kernel gives an error that it can't find the cdrom, which is SCSI.
I've even tried several different CD -Rom drives, to no avail.
Is there a work around for this, like in the Suse 9.0 case were I built a
set of boot floppies?

TIA,

Harry
============================================================================
===================

I had a similar issue when I installed Slackware, except I had an old IDE
CDROM.
I swapped the drive out with another box and then I had no more problems.  I
had the same problems with that drive 
installing Mandrake and Gentoo also.  My Linux box deserved my best CDROM
drive anyway!

Hope that helps.

Hi William,

What filesystem are they? There are restrictions on some filesystems

   Good point. I had a perfectly good cd-rom drive (24x) except it was not
capable of properly reading a bootable disk.

Subject: [PLUG] Converting Mixed-Case File Names
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0501081826030.14297@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I've received a whole bunch of code from a Winduhs coder. File names are,
literally, mixed cases. Some names are uppercase with uppercase extensions,
some uppercase names with lowercase extensions. Others are every possible
combination of cases.

   Is there a bash builtin that converts every character to lower case? I can
do a short "for i in ... do" script, but I have not found a function that
will do this. Alternatively, I suppose there's a way to use tr with the
:upper and :lower commands, yes?

   Haven't tried this before. Could be an interesting time.

Thanks,

Rich

Rich,

The file systems in question are all ext3.
You are correct.  It would appear that resize is not supported for ext3.
What a bitch. Looks like I will have to copy the partition content out,
delete, repartition and copy back.

Thanks for pointing this out.  So much for assumptions.

An update on the funny powering-off box.  It is clearly related to
running the tape backup.  On the two nights in the last 9 days that we
didn't run tape backups, the box remained operating.  On 7 of 7 tape
backup attempts, it has killed the box (after a variable amount of
time).  In the last two permutations, I moved the tape drive power
supply off the UPS and tried swapping in a different external tape
drive (and terminator), respectively.

I guess it could still be some fault on the SCSI card or the cable,
but I guess I am coming back to the power supply as the currently most
likely culprit.  I am still not clear how the tape backup could be
inducing a dodgy power supply to shut off the computer, particularly
when the failure occurs well (like hours in some cases) into the
backup, but then again *nothing* about this is clear.

I don't know much about QTparted, but ext3 itself can be resized.  If
you see support for ext2, then ext3 can be resized also--there is little
difference between the two format-wise and ext3 is backwards compatible
with ext2 (you can umount an ext3 and remount it as ext2, for
example).  On my EL3 systems, I generally set them up with LVM, leaving
only swap and /boot out and size everything on-demand.  With FC3 support
on-line resizing, it's even easier.

Could the tapedrive be causing unusualy high disk activity? (reading
from numerous disks, while writing logs to another, or something like
that?).  Could it be causing optical drives to spin up also?    That
might explain a higher-than-normal load, which would again lead to
power issues.

Pretty straight-forward:

for FiLe in *; do
    file=$(echo "${FiLe}"|tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
    echo mv -i "${FiLe}" "${file}"
done

(Remove the 'echo' once you've checked that it works.)

It gets slightly more interesting if you have a lot of directories, but
not too much.

It doesn't matter whether the name or extension is the wrong case--as
far as a shell is concerned they're just parts of a string.

Nope.  This is a bare box, with only one HD, a floppy and a SCSI card
in a PCI slot.  LAN, Audio and Video are all on the motherboard, but
of those only the LAN has anything connected.  Otherwise, only a
serial console and the SCSI cable to the external tape drive.

I tried to induce a load with heavy disk seeking and it didn't seem to
bother it in the least.  Also, I just removed two IDE drives and
replaced them with one IDE drive.  You'd think the electrical load
would have gone down from that.

The tape-related failures started immediately after the disk change.

   Many thanks, Wil. I did not understand the syntax of using the case
options with tr when I read the man page. And, when I followed the
suggestion at the bottom of the man page to try the info page what popped up
was information on removing trailing white space.

   This is a follow up report for archive archeologists.

   On a source directory with two levels of subdirectories I used both the
shell script as provided by Wil and the perl script pointed to by Carla. The
latter is both faster and traverses the directory structure in one fell
swoop. The shell script needed to be run from within each directory.

   I know that there is a way to modify the shell script to traverse the
directory tree. However, they both work and the perl script was finished in
an eye blink.

Thanks Carla and Wil!

Yeah, that page on the QTParted site says it will not resize either ext3 
or ext2. I'm actually not 100% sure that's current. I thought it would 
resize them but that you could not move the start point of the 
partition, just the end. It may have changed, I'm not sure.

I believe it will work using parted.

Another option is to covert ext3 to ext2 and then use ext2resize:

http://ext2resize.sourceforge.net/

I have never tried that, just read about it :)

Message-ID: <3896.216.99.218.67.1105304737.squirrel@sautez.com>

Happy Sunday all,

Well spending some time going over logs and updating some tools and I
notice that there is again a renew attack on the server on the sshd
protocol.  It is a dictionary attack to get into the system and I have
my logs getting filled up with:

Illegal user <someuser> from <some IP>

Is there a way in SSHD to automatically ban an IP from my system if I
see this sort of attack?  My only guess is that I would need to write
a script to look at the logs and then put then in the hosts.deny file.
 I'm sure I'm the only one that is getting these and wondered what
some of you may be doing about it.

I do have sshd setup to only allow on user and to use RSA
authenication only so it would difficult although I'm sure not
impossible to get in this way.  Just would like to stop them sooner.

Thanks,

Josh

According to the parted documentation, it can handle ext3, but somehow the

Yeah, that page on the QTParted site says it will not resize either ext3 or
ext2. I'm actually not 100% sure that's current. I thought it would resize
them but that you could not move the start point of the partition, just the
end. It may have changed, I'm not sure.

I believe it will work using parted.

Another option is to covert ext3 to ext2 and then use ext2resize:

http://ext2resize.sourceforge.net/

I have never tried that, just read about it :)

Since this is after a drive change, and since you are presumably using
a +80GB drive to replace a couple of 10's or 20's, you may be taxing
something in the disk formatting, or in the BIOS;  backups may be
thrashing areas of disk space or memory that were not used before,
and are only accessed during backups.

You mentioned originally that you were using an Intel D815.  A bit of
Googling for "D815" and "shutdown" found a vague reference to the need
for a BIOS upgrade.  Look into that.  Perhaps older, smaller disks did
not stretch the BIOS quite as much, or tickle the memory space that
throws the power-off switch.

Of course, do an fsck -c to find/heal bad blocks, and check your
partitions.  Given your earlier comments about grub and disk setup,
there may a mismatch between the partition tables and the filesystems
stored on them.  

You did remember to do a "mkswap" on your swap partition, yes?  Is the
swap partition the same size as before?  What happens to available
memory as the backup program runs?  

Also try a dd if=/dev/hda of=dev/null and see if the drive gets 
unhappy as you read its entire length.

You mentioned that you reseated the connectors.  I would do that with
ALL the connections, including the RAM and CPU and mobo power connectors
and PCI slots.  Something might have pulled /almost/ loose during the
disk replacement adventure.  Or the flexing the mobo made an internal
wire intermittent. You may kill the mobo with the extra stretching and
squeezing, but better to spend $100 replacing a mobo than losing client
data.

Last, if nothing else worked, I would put the old disks back in for
a weekend, run the backups again, and see if the problem goes away.
I would also try the new hard disk on another system, and repeat some
of the above tests.

Fascinating problem you have.  I look forward to your exultant bragging
about a clever solution, preferably soon.

Another option is to run sshd on a different port say 2222 instead of
port 22. All you need to do is specifiy the port when you connect to the
box...

ssh user at domain.com -p 2222

or 

scp -P 2222 user at domain.com

Since this box is on the Internet I would look at defense in depth....

I would make sure that I have a firewall box (which doens't respond to
SSH from the internet) set up (using PIX, iptables, ipchains, or
whatever).  It should forward all ssh requests to port 22 on this
server.  I would set up iptables then to deny the IP address.  This will
lessen the load on the ssh server and allow the firewall box to drop the
packets silently.

Josh,

   This has been going on for quite a while. It did drop off significantly,
but for a while the script was being tried by numerous cretins on the 'Net.

   If sshd is configured to allow only specific users in, the names tried in
the script (user, admin, guest, nobody, etc.) fail. I just shrug and let it
go. The IP addresses are blocked by postfix but not by my floppyfw.

   I think you need to put deny rules in your iptables/net filter setup.

Thanks all.  I see I either have to write a script to read the logs
and place in the iptables filter or do it manually or just forget
about it and let it be.

I suppose I could just limit which ip is allow to ssh into the box. 
That would surely slow down the attacks but also limits my ability to
connect to the box when I travel as my laptop changes ip as I move. 
Too bad you can't get a fix but mobile IP number.  Hmm. I'll have to
think about that one.

Thanks again.

Josh

On side note I'm having a good day getting all sorts of other things
working today.  I good productive day.  I like that.

   Here, I allow only two users to ssh in. And, authentication is by
pass-phrase primarily. Even though that drops down to password after a
couple of tries, I suspect that the scripts don't keep trying. Even if they
do, the standard "usernames" they're using are not allowed entry by default.

You could also setup Port Knocking to only open port 22 after a 
successful knock.

Thing is port knocking merely amounts to another password. An interesting
one, but still simply a password. If port knocking was to become really
popular, the scripts would simply start attempting to attack it. Like
passwords, port knocking is completely vulnerable to sniffing.

Sure, but it's another layer. The attacker would need to compromise it 
just to get the sshd port open, and then they would still need to 
compromise the service it's protecting. That's kind of the point of 
thinking in terms of defense in depth - you don't expect (or count on) 
any one measure to be enough to protect the system on its own.

I've never used port knocking, but it looks interesting. Generally with 
sshd I'd want to restrict access to it to as few IPs as possible, both 
through sshd itself and through the firewall. That's harder to do if 
you're in a situation where people need access from multiple or dynamic IPs.

Another helpful option is to turn off password access for sshd and 
require keys. That might work better for someone who is travelling but 
will have their laptop with them.

I'm fairly sure that this is exactly what portsentry does.  When it 
detects an attack signature, it writes an iptables rule and inserts it. 
  You can set up things like "whitelists," so that you don't lock 
yourself out whilst nmapping.

The only problem with portsentry is that it's sort of incompatible with 
a strict firewall -- it usually (to my understanding) relies upon seeing 
a bunch of ports opened from the same host in order to spot an attack 
script, and a good firewall will have those ports blocked off, so it's 
kind of a wash.

Hi All..
Hope someone knows this. I have a Sun Ultra5 system and I am trying to
install Linux over it. The danged OpenBoot system just won't let me
execute a different boot disk, etc. It keeps going to it's default Sun
system.
I don't want to keep the data or the OS, it's old stuff and I'm using
the box to install our new firewall using Linux.

Any clues to get around this and have it execute the boot disk would
really help.

Thanks,

I'm not sure what version of UltraLinux you are installing, but Debian
has some really good resources....

I assume you want to boot to a CD-ROM to install Linux?  (Sorry, I've
never tried to install Linux on a Sun, just Solaris.)  Typically to boot
to cdrom you type 'boot cdrom' at the OpenBoot prompt.  If you don't
care about the current status of the filesystems (because you're going
to wipe them anyway), you can just hit Stop-A to drop into the boot
monitor.

Press ' stop + A ' when the machine powers on.. then type  "boot cdrom"
at the boot prompt.. it will restart the machine and boot from the
cdrom.

First, do stop + A to get to the OBP. Then type "probe-scsi"[1] to get a
list of installed hard disks. You can also type "printenv" to get a list
of environment variables and "help" should do just that :)  

As already mentioned, can do "boot cdrom" to boot from the cdrom
(assuming you have one) or "boot disk" to boot of the first disk, "boot
disk1" to boot off the second disk.

A good price, but ...  before buying a projector, check out:

http://www.projectorcentral.com/

A good site with lots of projector data.  It is good to check user reviews
before buying a projector;  it is also good to check for noise, maximum
resolution, reliability, lamp life, and lamp cost.  The lamps for some
of these projectors cost $500, so an extra 1000 hours of lamp life may
make up for $200 of initial price.

Also check the warranty;  some of the "3 year" warranties only apply to
the original purchaser, or have other noxious restrictions.  

All that said, the 3M unit looks a little better than average, and the
sale price is half of MSRP.  You might be able to get a little better
prices for similar units mail-order, but there is an advantage to being
able to pound on the counter if you need to return it.

In addition to all the other good info, let me also put in a plug for 
Gentoo on SPARC. I have Gentoo installed on my SunBlade (US IIe). I 
don't use it as a workstation (e.g., there's no X anywhere on this 
system), but it's worked wonderfully for me as a server.

This is not to mean that Debian won't do a good job; I'm just trying

Sure, off-topic, but good science in any field can be very interesting.

My most interesting undergrad class was the "Geology of Natural
Disasters", which covered earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides, and
tsunamis.

It helped, of course, to have a very enthusiastic and experienced
instructor, who did a lot of field work.

Message-ID: <20050111220437.86238.qmail@web50609.mail.yahoo.com>

When I booted my Linux installation (Sarge) this
morning, X failed to start with a signal 11 error.
(Debian automatically turns off the display manager if
this happens, unlike other Linux distributions I have
used.) When I rebooted, X came up normally, but this
perplexes me a little.

I have molested the kernel recently and have two
potentially conflicting display drivers. I expect to
compile another kernel soon which will not have this
characteristic.

Sometimes signal 11 is associated with hardware
problems. Does anyone have advice for investigating this?

Subject: [PLUG] Knoppix command line disk ghosting
Message-ID: <1105496843.8908.17.camel@gimli>

I reinstall windows 98 on my sons system every 9 months or so.  He uses
it to play games, listen to music, instant message, edit documents and
browse the web.  It takes about a day of elapsed time to get the system
back up to speed: installing win98, and all the necessary drivers,
setting up the printer, anti-virus program, open office, mozilla, yahoo
messenger, etc.  So I was motivated to looking in to getting an image of
his disk.  

I was tickled pink when I found a way to do it without any special
tools.  I just needed a Knoppix disk.  Here's how I did it.


# Boot knoppix, su to root.

# Mount the windows partition, hda1.  hda1 is the only partition.
mkdir /mnt/local
mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/local
cd /mnt/local

# Fill all unused blocks with zeros to allow them to 
# be compressed when imaging.
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do cat /dev/zero >zero$i; done

# Free up the space.
rm zero?

cd /
umount /mnt/local

# Image the whole disk by copying it to another machine after 
# compressing it.
gzip - </dev/hda | ssh chgenly at 10.0.0.10 'cat >r2d2_image.gz'


I could even run 'sshdstart' and then do the whole backup thing
remotely.  Just too cool.  The image fit on to one CD.  Very convenient.

Restoring it is easier.

# Boot knoppix, su to root.
ssh chgenly at 10.0.0.10 'cat r2d2_image.gz' | gunzip - >/dev/hda


Surprisingly it takes about three times longer to reload the image with
gunzip, than to create the image with gzip.   I have tested the restore
by zeroing the whole hard drive first.  It worked great.  You get the
boot block, partition table and win98.  Everything.

I had such great success I thought I'd image my wifes system.   I use
the same procedure, but it fails to create a tidy image.  She is using
2Gb on a 10Gb drive.  But when I try the backup procedure described
above, the image file gets up to about 4.6Gb before I abort the imaging.
I found this very strange.  So I tried doing a disk defrag, and then
doing the whole imaging procedure including zeroing unused blocks.
Still a no go.   Anyone have any idea what might be going wrong?

Chris

It might be a good idea to consult Microsoft's EULA
before deciding whether to describe such procedures in
a public forum. It would probably be possible to
produce a version of Windows XP that would run from a
CD and store user data on a microdrive, as Knoppix
does. But Bill Gates might frown on this.

Update.  Still no final resolution, but a little more information.  I
got in on Monday afternoon, updated the BIOS (an Intel D815EEA2L
motherboard) from P10 to P21.  Swapped in a different powersupply (a
300W puppy I had pulled from a box when installing a P4-capable
powersupply).  I am back on a 2.4.28 kernel (fwiw).

I tried a backup to file rather than backup to tape, writing the file
to a third (unbackedup) partition.  Did both 'create' and 'diff'
operations on both backups.  Both of these succeeded without death.

Next, my backup script ran, but rapidly failed with errors like:

  Jan 11 21:25:01 hostname kernel: st0: Error with sense data: Info fld=0x1, Current st09:00: sense key Medium Error
  Jan 11 21:25:01 hostname kernel: Additional sense indicates Excessive write errors

Looked like a dirty tape drive, so I requested a run of the cleaning
cartridge today, which reportedly occurred.  Tried again this evening
and got the same thing, so I am requesting new and/or different media
for tomorrow's attempt.

Does anyone know of an easy way to untar/zip multiple files at once?  I
figure a script is probably the best solution but unfortunately my
scripting skills are about non-existent at this point.

Thanks

Learn for loops:

bash$ for i in *.tar.gz; do tar -xvzf $i; done

The bootable CD is great. I ran it through four cycles
without an error, and conclude that memory is probably
OK. 

It's probably a bum kernel, though I must have
rebooted six times today without getting another
signal 11. I'm planning on building a 2.6 kernel,
which introduces new challenges. (Maybe. I've built
one on a system that already used 2.6, but not yet on Sarge.)

Russell,

   I saw the sense data errors when my tape drives were failing. I don't
recall the brand/model that I had before going to the Tandberg, but it was a
failing drive that gave me those errors in the log.

   The Tandbergs have been flawless. The original, SLR-5, worked, but I
discovered a year or so later that it's one of the slowest drives ever made.
Tandberg allowed me to purchase a SLR-60 for evaluation at 50% off and I've
been using that for the past three or so years. No errors at all.

   What Tandberg tech support told me is that too much cleaning kills the
drive. The original instructions were to clean the drive after every 8 or so
hours of use. So, I cleaned the silly thing each week. Turns out that's a
no-no. The SLR-60 now tells me (with an orange light on the front panel)
when it wants a cleaning. This occurs about every eight months or so. The
only nights the drive is not used are Saturday and Sunday.

   It may not be the most modern or least expensive technology, but the
Tandberg SLR drives have been rock solid and the tech support unsurpassed.
And, restores using BRU continue to work flawlessly when I screw up or when
I move everything onto a new system.

If your local network is secure, you might want to try using NFS or
Samba to transfer the file.  The ssh encrypt/decrypt may or may not
be slowing the transfer.

   When I upgraded the java2 sdk to subversion 6 (to fix the vulnerability in
Web-served applets), it appeared to add a new version of the jre, too. Is
this correct? If so, then I don't need to install the latest j2re on top of
it.

Thanks,

The xargs utility might be what you want:

Or if you want them to be done in parallel:

bash$ for i in *.tar.gz; do tar -xvzf $i & done

Or if you have a lot and you want to run a few in parallel at a time,
see 1.5 on my ShellHacks page:

dd will work to get an image.  But since the system uses 2GB, I wanted
the image to be compressed to this size or less.  I didn't want to fetch
all 10GB.

Rod,

   I recommend looking at Web sites run by newegg.com, monarchcomputers.com
and so on. Look at the AMD 64 combos they sell and that will give you a
solid idea of what components work together.

Thats correct. The JRE is a subset of the SDK. The SDK includes the
JRE + compilers and all the developer tools.

If you are interested in using SATA, I highly recommend reading about the
current state of Linux SATA support.

http://linux.yyz.us/sata/

Capsule summary:
  Many so called RAID controllers are really software RAID, where you 
  would be better off using the md driver.

  Most of today's controllers do not support TCQ/NCQ.

IBM Corp. the nation?s top patent receiver, and tech giant, announced
yesterday that it will be donating 500 technology patents to open source
software developers. 

...

Open source groups developing free software for the masses and business
that are always looking for alternatives to such programs as Microsoft
Windows now have an ally in IBM. The patents will be available to any
individual, community, or company working on or using software that
meets the definition of open source software now or in the future. They

Message-ID: <75D481373A76D311A5790090274F2B5C05B71CDD@mailsrv1.gemstone.com>

I just installed a SCSI card in a Dell PowerEdge 2850 without so much as
using a screwdriver, wow. Now I need to add a tape drive. The tape drive is
currently connected to the SCSI card.

Funny thing is that the tape drive has absolutely not markings on it to give
me a clue what brand it is. It takes a DDS4 (DG4-150 tape was in it when I
started using it) tape. It is beige with four rubber grips on the sides of
it. 

Anyway that is not as important, I think anyway, as how to get it working.
It is currently set to target 6. I think I should execute commands something
like:

# ln -s /dev/st6 /dev/ftape - to create a tape drive device symbolic link
# mt -f /dev/ftape command - to mount it
 
Is this right, enough, should I do something else first? Someone please
point me in the right direction. Are there ways to see if the tape drive was
found by the system when it booted?

Norm,

   How strange that there isn't a manufacturer's plate on it with model and
serial number.

> # ln -s /dev/st6 /dev/ftape - to create a tape drive device symbolic link
> # mt -f /dev/ftape command - to mount it

   It is not a floppy tape; that would be connected to the floppy drive
connector on the mother board, not the SCSI bus. However, if you want to
name the mount point 'ftape' that's OK.

   Look at dmesg to see what the kernel found on the SCSI bus. My server
shows:

   If you don't have the driver loaded you won't see anything useful. I'm not
sure how one probes for the appropriate driver; more hardware-knowledgeable
folks here can tell you that.

   To test the drive, once you know the proper driver loaded, are the 'mt'
(move tape) commands. Read 'man st' for details. You can rewind, seek,
retention and so forth from the command line.

Interesting read.  I bought a SATA controller awhile ago and still haven't 
got it installed.  I didn't buy it for RAID just for a little extra speed 
for a PVR.  Now I need to look at it again and see what make/model it is

That's not a "mount point".  You don't "mount" tapes.  The interface
with tape is through a character device.  Probably the tape device is
at /dev/st0 or /dev/nst0 (I use the latter, a non-rewinding device
which doesn't rewind after every operation, you do it manually
instead).

As for device, check dmesg output.

"man mt".  Typically, you want to check the status before you do
anything else:

 # mt -f /dev/nst0 status

Also, don't be surprised if your device doesn't support all of the mt
commands.  My DDS3 doesn't do retentioning, for example.

   True. I use both st and nst. The weekly, full backups rewind the tape and
write from the beginning; the daily, incremental backups start at the end of
the last one.

Subject: [PLUG] Mandrake netprofiles
Message-ID: <41E5ABD5.5010209@dimstar.net>

I'm using Mandrake 10.1 official download version.

I'm trying to use netprofile on my laptop.

I've found docs that say you can put append="PROFILE=profile" in
lilo.conf, run lilo and it will choose that profile upon boot. This
was for Mandrake 9.2...

Netprofile does appear to change the files it's supposed to change,
according to the profile specified in lilo.conf, but the changed files
were too late to make a difference during boot. Rebooting with the
same profile works the second time, because the changed files are now
in place before the boot.

On RPMFind, I see in the latest version changelog some reference to
another place to specify profile, but no mention of what that place is.

Booting and then changing profiles is a hassle, especially when you
are trying to attach to a YP server... One must then go through and
manually restart services to connect to the server etc.

I'm finding little or no documentation, and a how-to link on the
Mandrake website just says it needs to be written... Uh, yeah... I'll
write it if I can get it working...

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Russ

I've successfully used "apcupsd" daemon for monitoring the APC UPSs we have in 
our office. It works with the older UPSs we have that use a serial port for 
signaling as well as the newer APC models which use USB. All of the UPSs we 
have are the "smart" ones that provide a variety of information regarding 
battery charge, load, time remaining, etc.

Tony,

   Thanks very much! That's the real-life feedback I was seeking. The new
unit is a APC SmartUPS-1400 with serial port. And, my server has a free
serial port so that works out for me.

   Gotta' read up on the apcupsd when I get this report finished.

Okay, more wackiness.  The drive is a Seagate STD624000N.  I have two
drives to test.  Both behave indistinguishably.  When I initially saw
the write errors on the tape device, I started to do some testing
using dd, to take filesystem interaction out of the picture.  Because
of the hardware data compression on the device, I didn't want to just
write zeros because the built-in compression would have a field day
with that.  So I did this instead:

  # mt -f /dev/nst0 setblk 512
  # dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/nst0 obs=512 count=32768

Given the experience I've subsequently had, I recommend *NEVER* doing
that in the future!  At least until I figure out what is going wrong.
I don't know why, but that seems to nuke the cartridge.  Even if I
completely disconnect the drive from the SCSI bus, inserting a
"treated" tape cartridge drives the device insane.  Lights continually
blink on and off slowly and I never get access to the device.  Even
manually ejecting the tape takes a *loooong* time.

Inserting a fresh tape, right out of the shrink wrap and the tape
drive behaves normally.  Insertion goes normally, a little
blinky-blinky and then stops to wait for instructions.  This time I
turned off compression and writing zeros instead of random bytes:

  # mt -f /dev/nst0 datcompression 0
  # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nst0 obs=512 count=32768

which takes about 20-25 seconds.

I can only assume that the tape drive is interpretting the
/dev/urandom data as data corruption.  Or maybe the random data is
causing the hardware compression algorithm to go insane.  I've got no
idea.  Has anyone seen anything like this before?

Going to give the backup another whirl tonight.

I downloaded the 5 CD set for Fedora Core3, checked them with md5sum and 
burned a set of 5 CDs. Three of the five failed the CD test. (on a windows 
98 machine) I tried redoing some with the same problem. Disk one & the 
rescue disk burned OK, but the others would not.

So I downloaded another set of iso filed to my Linux machine and burned CDs 
there. Same problem. Only disk one worked. (didn't try rescue disk)

I also noticed that a hard drive in one slot (all my drives are removable, 
so they get moved around a bit) would click (head returning noise) several 
times on startup. Turns out that slot shared power cable with the CD/DVD 
burner. (That drive slot was EMPTY) during the filed burn attempts above)

I replaced the 250watt power supply with a 450 watt unit, loaded up all 
three cages with hard drives and booted with no problem.

I tried burning a CD. No problem. Did a whole set.

I did not attempt to find if the supply is defective or if a 250 watt 
supply just can't power three 15 watt hard drives, a 30 watt CD/DVD burner 
+ mother board.

Maybe the Linux machine needs a new supply too.

I just posted this in hopes it might help someone else, but any comments or 
similar experiences?

Thanks

Yep.. I had a PSU go up in flames (literally) about 4 months ago. Before that 
happened, some of my 15K RPM scsi drives would click-n-seek many times during 
boot, and sometimes not be recgonized.
I woke up one morning to the smoke detector, and noticed smoke pouring out of 
my office. It took me about 30 seconds to figure out it was coming from MY 
computer, and when I pulled it out, smoke was rolling out like crazy. Not a 
good smell.
Ran to Fry's (ugh) to grab an emergency motherboard and PSU. After dinking with 
windows so I wouldn't have to reinstall (this is my gaming desktop :)) it 
booted fine and I haven't seen anything strange with the HDs since.
I've also seen the loud click-n-seek be a result of crappy molex Y connectors.

Good times.

I've never seen anything like that with my DDS2 drive.  If you feel like

I *think* there are known problems with the media verifier that was

yo pluggers,

I rarely have the luxury of a healthy budget for buying or building new boxes; 
like most of us, I've made a career out of coaxing a little more life out of 
old Frankenhardware. Well, I'm starting a new project where there is actually 
enough budget to purchase some decent hardware. I am giddy with excitement. 
There will be two standalone servers: one IMAP and one Apache web server. The 
mailserver will have about 300 accounts. Not sure yet how much traffic is 
expected for the Web server, or if it is going to be burdened with horrid 
scripts or what. These are not quite mission-critical, maybe one step below 
mission-critical.

Would it make sense to go for server-quality mainboards, NICs, power supplies, 
and all those good things? We already decided on tower cases, for easy 
maintenance and future expansion, so box real estate is not a problem. What 
do you get in a "server" mobo or NIC anyway that you don't get in the cheep 
stuff?

thanks!

I recomment NUT: http://us1.networkupstools.org/

Unlike the free APC PowerChute (I don't know about apcupsd; APC does make
expensive editions that are network-aware), it operates in client/server mode,
so the monitoring host can inform other hosts of the power outage and they,
too, will shutdown.

I wouldn't depend on it. Tthe dern thing has never worked right. Go ahead and 
try your disks, I bet the install goes fine.

Reliability, or course!
And depending on what you mean by cheap, performance. If you meant cheap, 
but with good specs; you probably won't notice a huge difference.

I'm sure people will post lots of links, so I'll leave that to them/google.
We recently bought 2 3.0GHz P4's and threw them in an Intel server board 
with 2GB of 400MHz RAM. Talk about sweet. With appropriate tweaks, 900Mb/s 
between the two is very possible.

Oh, and you get the ability to redirect the console to a serial port with 
server motherboards!

Many more.. but I must run and eat dinner now :)

For me what makes a server is the hard drive subsystem, namely a
top-of-the-line SCSI controller with top-of-the-line SCSI drives.
Generally you'll get better results if you get a SCSI controller on
the mainboard instead of using an add-on card. So that's the main
consideration for the mainboard.

Next put your money toward top-quality power supplies and fans,
and select your case for good airflow.

After that I tend to go for the same commodity components that you
might find in a typical desktop PC, but things that some people
would look for depending on the intended use include:

- Server management functionality on the mainboard such as IPMI
- Wake-on-LAN feature in the NICs
- Hardware RAID

And more things that are not coming to my mind at the moment.

What are the requirements for uptime, response time, expansion, time
before upgrading is reasonable/expected? How much downtime is allowed in
the event of a failure? How much planned downtime will  your customers
allow?

How much admin time have you allocated for these boxes and the services
running on them? Will they be in your facility or a colo?

You can buy uptime, but it's very expensive unless you have written
contract guaranteeing that you will be lucky. If you find the gods who
issue those contracts, let me know. #:)

You can run both email and web on one server and use drbd and heartbeat
to make the other a hot spare. Apply a 4x multiplier to your normal
admin time if you go this way.  Actually, I think it's close to n^2
where n is the number of services you're using heartbeat to fail over. I
started down this path about a year ago then went a lower-reliability
path to save my sanity. I couldn't afford that much uptime. #:)

The Google formula is to use so many cheap computers that when a few of
them fail, it doesn't affect you. Of course, they wrote their software
to facilitate this behavior and you may not have this option. And they
have teams of contractors sitting in their data centers rebuilding
failed systems 24/7, another cost you probably don't want to bear.

Bottom line: it's a balance, and I don't know enough about what you've
got on each side of the equation to make a detailed suggestion. Except
to say that my last pair of servers have dual LAN onboard, one 10/100
and 1 gigE. I used the gigE as a back net for communication between the
two, and it works VERY well. If they have to talk to each other (for
authentication? backups?), I suggest that you use a motherboard with
dual LAN ports like my Tyan S2099 (though I'm not a big Tyan fan, this
board works very well).

Thinking along the lines that Kurt mentioned about expansion you might 
want to consider the ability to add processors, additional hard drives, 
and memory.  What maybe a low end server now could be a middle/high end 
server faster than expected.

Also as Terry mentioned fast hard drives.  SCSI is perferred but I must 
say that I'm using a board with SATA controller built in that handles 
1600+ email accounts with no problem.

Just rereading what I wrote, I started trying to think of alternative
interpretations.  I was able to write, error, rewind and write again
dd'd data from /dev/urandom last night with one tape.  The one thing I
didn't do last night was eject/reinsert.  Then we put in another tape
today and did the same thing.  The tape drive "does something" when
you insert it, probably reads some user-invisible information in a
tape preamble or something.  Then this afternoon I took a shrink
wrapped cartridge and put that in, was able to write my /dev/urandom
data, got an error, rewound, and ejected.  Reran a cleaning cartridge
and when I put the just-unwrapped, just-written tape back in, the
insertion-reading business went insane.  I *think* I'd seen the same
thing when I'd put in the second of the two previous tapes this
afternoon, but am not sure now and will have to check later.  The
behavior was totally unexpected.  I'll try again after I get this poor
guy's machine backing up reliably again.  Maybe try out the "broken"
tapes on my drive at home.

The problem began when I was searching message bodies for a string. I

  a) new motherboard BIOS;

I'll try reverting (b) and (c) one at a time until I get another

"apcupsd" also supports monitoring over a network. We have several systems 
powered on some of our larger UPSs and so I have one server dedicated as the 
monitoring server with the signaling cable connected to it. The remaining 
systems are clients monitoring the UPS through the server.

The only caveat with this approach is that the network switch that is used for 
the interconnect needs to also be plugged into an UPS so no signaling is lost 
between any server and its associated clients in the event of a powerfailure.

Are you using the Exchange connector? I've seen a few threads on other lists 
where people are having problems with crashes with Evolution 2.x when using 
the Exchange connector.

I'm very interested in Evolution 2.x issues since we have an Exchange server 
in our office for email and calendar. I'm running Evolution 1.4.6 which is 
the version that was included with SuSE 9.1. I'm gonna stick with this older 
version for the time being since I'd have to switch back to using WinXP for 
Exchange connectivity if I couldn't use Evolution.

I installed FC3 on a hard drive in one machine and moved that hard drive to 
another machine. It hangs on power up.

Is this normal?

Is there a way to tell it that it is on a new machine?

The "new machine" is currently runing FC1, so it should not be a hardware 
issue.

For one, you don't get "floor sweeps."  Literally, the pieces in the 
"free after rebate" NICs you get at Fry's may have been swept off the 
floor of a factory.

Another example is that with HP (Compaq) servers, you get ILO 
(integrated lights-out), which provides remote console access and remote 
power-off via a separate on-board NIC.

Another benefit (this more with a "system" than an individual board) is 
the availability of *exactly* the same part, by part number, be it from 
the manufacturer or off eBay -- not a putatively "compatible" part for 
replacement.  Also, others have likely tested your OS on *exactly* that 
same hardware -- no combinatorical nightmares with varying chipsets, etc.

With a complete server system, furthermore, you're getting something 
that's engineered, not just assembled.  Someone took the time to map the 
airflow through the case, measure the power demands of the RAID array, 
etc., not just plug things together until it boots OK.

Look at the resellers on eBay who sell new or refurb stuff that's still 
under warranty from IBM, HP, Dell (caveat lector, Dell has had in the 
past a mixed reputation on servers, including using the same model 
number for different grab-bags of parts).  Check 2 "speed increments" 
down from the blistering fastest new stuff, and you can fly 
business-class for nearly coach-price.

I hate to sound like a server sales rep, but I've had multiple white box 
clone PSUs and RAM sticks fail over many years, but I'm still waiting 
(with a box of factory-supplied backups) for any of the server-grade 
stuff to fail.

Best,

Randall

   Having done just that (it arrived yesterday), allow me to recommend
www.refurbups.com. I purchased a Smart-UPS 1400 for $189 + shipping. New
battery, guarantee, and a _lot_ less than new. This unit accommodates up to
950W so it will work with my server and workstation here at my desk.

   The sales staff there was candid and helpful in spec'ing my needs. The
data cable wasn't in the box but a quick e-mail exchange with them (it was
after 5:00 pm New York time) was followed by a message this morning that the
replacement has been sent and will be here Monday.

   I'll even donate the mouse pad they sent. :-)

I've recently been searching for a suitable motherboard for a server.
The board I found is a Supermicro P8SAA.  It's not an official server
motherboard, but it covers most of my wishlist.

  ECC
  SATA with NCQ support (Intel ICH6R)
  Intel Gbit ethernet
  serial ports
  no onboard video, but the BIOS can be redirected to a serial port

All of my previous systems have been SCSI, but I've decided to give SATA
a try.  I will probably install a Seagate SATA drive.

I never thought about this much until working at a startup I was the lone 
Linux resource at the company at the time. We needed a system that was 
reliable and had a certain level of redundancy in it. We ended up going with 
HP/Compaq DL380G3 systems. Our requirements were for a server that could be 
used for our CVS repository, in house WIKI, and Bugzilla database.

The system is very critical and the HP server gave us the following features 
for reliability.

o Dual hot-swappable power supplies

o Built-in support for hardware RAID. We run hardware RAID-5 so we can hot 
swap a failed disk.

o The DIMMs are installed in pairs and so if one fails the system runs on the 
secondary. In fact we had a DIMM failure in one of our critical DL380G3 
system and the system just failed over to the spare DIMM in the pair and the 
amber system health LED was lit on the system. Obviously we replaced the 
failed DIMM at the earlest opportunity. The mainboard has numerous fault LEDs 
on it and so identifying the failed DIMM was trivial once we opened the case.

o The cooling fans are hot swappable and so the 2U rack system can be slide 
out, the top cover removed and cooling fans popped out and replaced.

Critical systems are connected to large UPSs and we have UPS monitoring 
enabled on all of our Linux servers. This allows us to have a clean shutdown 
if for some reason a poweroutage lasts longer than our UPS's battery 
capacity.

Obviously the HP DL380G3 systems are not cheap but it's nice that they have 
proven to be very reliable and they afford us the ability to hotswap some of 
the components without having to down a system to replace them.

After having DL380G3 systems running for nearly the last 1 1/2 years, the only 
reason any of our DL380G3 systems have gone down was to get new Linux kernels 
installed or the case of the one that had a failed DIMM.

I'm actually a developer at my company but since we lack knowledgeable Linux 
people in our small IT group I get tasked with doing most of the SA work for 
our Linux servers. I like to spend as little time as I can on Linux SA work 
and so having reliable servers keeps me doing what I like best which is 
software development.

Since web server service is cheap these days have you considered 
outsourcing the hardware and connectivity to somebody else?  Depending 
on your needs you can get managed, reliable and dedicated boxes sitting 
in somebody else's data center that will have far more bandwidth and UPS 
capacity than you could afford, and a 24 hour staff to replace 
components if the magic smoke does get let out for what I consider to be 
reasonable prices; it may pencil out for you guys.

Possibly a processor mismatch between the old and new machine. A binary
kernel can be very particular about wanting to run on the processor for
which it was compiled.

Jim,

My first thought is that the harddrive was a different IDE device on the 
install machine than on the new machine. If you installed FC3 while the 
HD was master on 2nd IDE channel(/dev/hdc) and then installed it as 
master on 1st IDE channel (/dev/hda) then the boot loader would try the 
wrong device.

Thanks to all that responded. Tried some of those options and then
some.. Discovered what my real problem was is trying to load x86
platform software on a "risk ? " OS environment so it has no way of
reading the boot files (no x86 bios).

Thanks again for the quick response, just thought I'd update what I
discovered.

First, do stop + A to get to the OBP. Then type "probe-scsi"[1] to get a
list of installed hard disks. You can also type "printenv" to get a list
of environment variables and "help" should do just that :)  

As already mentioned, can do "boot cdrom" to boot from the cdrom
(assuming you have one) or "boot disk" to boot of the first disk, "boot
disk1" to boot off the second disk.

Yes, you will need disks with linux compiled for Sun Sparc or UltraSparc

Hi Jim,

It would be good to have more details about what happens when it fails. 
Like what you see on the screen.

  The SPARC's use a completely different processor chip than WinTel boxen.
The executables have to be compiled for the architecture.  

SPARC - Scalable Processor ARChitecture
RISC - Reduced Instruction Set Computer 

See the Wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC

  It not just using the correct install disks.  You'll also need to locate
SPARC binaries or compile any programs which are not on the install media.

IBM xSeries servers have a "press F2 for Diagnostics" option when the 
system boots.

Too many white-box, desktop systems come with no diagnostics at all!  
(Not even
a companion CD.)  So if the system is behaving flaky, you're unable to 
do anything
to verify the hardware.  Built-in mem and disk checkers are probably the 
sub-diag
sections I use most.

Here's an entry level server motherboard from Intel that might be worth
a look.

  http://www.intel.com/design/servers/boards/SE7221BK1-E/index.htm

It's very similar to the Supermicro board I mentioned earlier, but this
one has onboard video.

Thanks everyone, that is a lot of great information.
I'm kicking myself for not thinking of a big tuff UPS. Power out here is quite 
flakey- when it's not gone completely, it's blipping in and out. Not good for 
electronic things.

Subject: [PLUG] Kernel upgrade
Message-ID: <20050114050057.55831.qmail@web50610.mail.yahoo.com>

I presently use Sarge, whose default kernel is 2.4.27,
but since I would like to try my hand at UDF packet
writing, I wanted to install one of the latest
kernels. I downloaded 2.6.9 kernel sources from
kernel.org and configured them in my home directory.

Upon booting the new kernel, it looked just like the
other one. Or so I thought. The digital camera didn't
work, and I noted that there was no support for
CONFIG_USB_UHCI or CONFIG_USB_OHCI in my .config, and
that's probably why. So now I want to rebuild the
kernel with just those changes (for now).

Do you have to put a dash in the "extraversion"
variable in the Makefile in order for it to appear in
the kernel version? In other words, if you put just
"A" after =, would it appear as 2.6.9A or 2.6.9-A?

According to one source, it is "necessary" to add such
a line as this to fstab when using a 2.6 kernel:

none  /sys   sysfs   defaults  0   0

I have /sys, but not the new line in fstab. I am
thinking about keeping a 2.4 kernel in /boot, just in
case a worthwhile program still needs it. Would a 2.4
kernel still boot properly if that line were added to
fstab?

Swapped client's tape drive back in and now I can't write more than
about a meg and a half, which is extremely reminiscent of the behavior
I was seeing a couple days ago.  And it appears that must be stuck in
a buffer anyway (and never makes it to tape), because:

  # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nst0 bs=32768 count=1    
  dd: writing `/dev/nst0': Input/output error
  1+0 records in
  0+0 records out
  dd: closing output file `/dev/nst0': Input/output error

and because even after:

  # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nst0 obs=512 count=32768
  dd: writing to `/dev/nst0': Input/output error
  2944+0 records in
  2943+0 records out
  dd: closing output file `/dev/nst0': Input/output error

which apparently writes the ~1.5 meg to tape, a rewind is nearly
instantaneous.

It is possible there is a faulty connection at the tape drive.  I
noticed today that one of the wire retention mechanisms on the
connector didn't close.  The connector felt and looked seated, but I
couldn't get the wire (for those not familiar with the 50-pin
centronics connectors, think the printer end of a parallel port cable)
into the little holder ears on one side.

  <http://www.cablestogo.com/images/connectors/c50F.jpg>

I'll check again tomorrow.  Anyway, the plot thickens.

2.6.9A. There are no built-in spaces or anything, so type in exactly what you 
want.

No problem, it will boot fine. Any filesystems that it does not find simply 
won't be mounted, and you'll see some complaining in dmesg.

The office light was on, so I stopped in this evening and checked.
Although the wire retention mechanism doesn't close on one side, that
looks innocuous.  I moved the cable to the other connector, swapping
with the terminator.  When I powered up the drive and reinserted the
tape cartridge, it was still blinking when I left the office, and now
from home I am seeing the same ~1.5meg write behavior and then error,
e.g.:

  # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nst0 bs=1024 count=2048
  dd: writing `/dev/nst0': Input/output error
  1440+0 records in
  1439+0 records out
  dd: closing output file `/dev/nst0': Input/output error

Hmm.  But now, my short writes are succeeding, e.g.:

  # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nst0 bs=1024 count=1 
  1+0 records in
  1+0 records out
  
Double hmm:

  # mt -f /dev/nst0 rewind
  mt: /dev/nst0: Input/output error
  # mt -f /dev/nst0 rewind
  # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nst0 bs=1024 count=1024
  1024+0 records in
  1024+0 records out
  # mt -f /dev/nst0 rewind
  mt: /dev/nst0: Input/output error
  # mt -f /dev/nst0 rewind
  # dd if=/dev/nst0 of=/tmp/test.out bs=1024 count=1024
  dd: reading `/dev/nst0': Input/output error
  0+0 records in
  0+0 records out

One clue.  Specs indicate the drive has a 2meg buffer.

Sigh.  I'll try the other drive again tomorrow.

FC2 installed, and, when I changed the display
adapter, Kudzu removed nearly all the hardware and I
never used the installation again. "Normal" may have
at least two meanings: Does it indicate that
everything is all right, or is it something you can
expect. In the latter sense, yes.

Subject: [PLUG] Sony SDT - 10000 tape drive connected and can't find device
	name
Message-ID: <75D481373A76D311A5790090274F2B5C05B71F49@mailsrv1.gemstone.com>

Problem:
Tape drive connected and not able to identify what device it is.
 
Background:
I have a question regarding installing a Sony SDT-10000 tape drive in a Dell
PowerEdge 2850
I added an adaptec SCSI controller card and connected it to the tape drive
via a 69pin cable. Lights displaying on the tape drive
When I watch the boot process I can see after the LSI logic stuff the
adaptec SCSI controller showing up. It even displays that if finds the Sony
tape drive complete with the model SDT-10000
>From System Tools, Hardware Browser, SCSI devices I can see the following:
AHA-2940WPRO/AIC-788X
Manufacture: Adeptec
Driver: aic7xxx
I even checked to make sure that the device is showing up by pressing Ctrl A
during external SCSI controller card was displaying on boot up. It shows up
exactly where it should on target 6
The problem I am having is using the thing.
 
I have run 
[root at boomer log]# /sbin/modprobe st - to load the 'st' driver, the SCSI
Tape device driver, which /dev/*st* connects to.
 
I tried entering:
[root at boomer log]# pwd
/var/log
[root at boomer log]# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10
(wheel),1(bin),300(web)
[root at boomer log]# hostname
boomer
[root at boomer etc]# mt -f /dev/st6 status
/dev/st6: No such device
[root at boomer etc]# mt -f /dev/nst6 status
/dev/nst6: No such device
[root at boomer etc]# mt -f /dev/nst0 status
/dev/nst0: No such device
[root at boomer etc]# mt status
/dev/tape: No such file or directory
[root at boomer etc]# mt -f /dev/tape status
/dev/tape: No such file or directory
[root at boomer etc]#
 
I pulled it out of another Linux machine so I know it works though I have
never used it. It doesn't have a tape in it, but that shouldn't matter.
What do I do next to get this thing to work? 
Sorry to be so long winded, but I wanted to supply as much information as
possible. From the find below (at the bottom) it looks like I at least have
the source code so the device driver should/could be loaded. Where would I
look for the device driver aic7xxx? Whoops, I just showed my ignorance, too
bad.

Russell, Ron --

Thanks for the info.  "dd_rescue" is exactly what was needed!

I've grabbed all the nice ASCII text fragments.  Next chore will
be trying to find, piece together, and decipher an OpenOffice.org
spreadsheet ....

Subject: [PLUG] Cool FreeBSD sysadmin job for someone!
Message-ID: <1105723940.6322.49.camel@hermes.braithwaites.net>

Well, I saw a posting on a list for a sysadmin job with www.truthout.org
and foolishly applied for it. And they hired me.

Why did I do that? I have too much to do in too short a period of time
to take this on. I'm moving to Canada and studying for the LPI exam
(that's why I quit Free Geek). I must have been nuts.

If I could give them a lead or two for the sysadmin position, we would
all feel better about it.

Here's the scoop. They've got a bunch of FreeBSD machines (and 1 W2K box
you don't have to touch) hosted at rackspace. They want someone to
install Scoop (a very cool Perl app - http://scoop.kuro5hin.org/) on a
new machine and to answer their editors' technical questions. You
generally wouldn't need to deal with end users, just the folks working
on the site. This is a work from home gig, too.

If you want more info, please send an email to Marc Ash
<director at truthout.org> and tell him about yourself. This is a left-wing
news aggregation site, so bear that in mind...

If you want any more info on this, just give me a call at 503-267-3250.

-Ron

[Norm, please subscribe to the list so I don't have to manually approve
your posts.]

Does 'lsmod' show the 'st' driver?  If not, then you'll have to manually
load it--'modprobe st'.  Then see if dmesg shows anything.

I recall reading somewhere that OpenOffice uses XML for their file formats. 
Maybe that will help you put the parts back together.

  Correct... An OpenOffice spreadsheet is a multi-part file, in XML,
contained in a ZIP archive.  

  Thusly...

[steve at linux Temp]$ ls
temp.sxc

[steve at linux Temp]$ file temp.sxc 
temp.sxc: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract

[steve at linux Temp]$ unzip temp.sxc

Did Apple really forge the From: field and send me spam?  If so,
that's very disappointing.

P.S. I've actually never gone by Barrie, and have no idea who kenmur

oddly enough.

Dick,

   Yes, they do. But, when the file is stored on disk it is in a compressed
format and includes "helper" files.

Does anyone have any pointers on burning data to DVD+RW from Linux?
All I can currently find seems to be limited to CD.

I've used "dvd+rw tools" to great success. They work very similarly to
the mkisofs/cdrecord tools used for burning CDs.

Hello everyone!

I'm new to Linux and the only distribution I have so
far is Damn Sall Linux.  Its a small, pretty limited
distribution.  I've enjoyed my time with Linux so far
and want to get something better.  I was pointed
toward Mandrake.  I was wondering if anyone here is
possibly selling burned copies of the software? I cant
really afford to pay the 150 bucks they are asking
for, and it would take about 84 hours to download on
Dial-Up.  If anyone is interested in selling a burned
copy, please let me know!

   You're in luck -- maybe (it all depends on the weather). Today is when the
clinic is scheduled and almost certainly someone can bring a set of disks to
be copied or they can be downloaded on the high-speed line.

   That's one of the purposes of the clinic.

Barbara,

   Privoxy is based on junkbuster, according to their site.

   Got it; reading the manual now and will install and tune today.

Russell> Sigh.  I'll try the other drive again tomorrow.

Okay, so I go in yesterday.  The tape I tried to write on Thursday
caused drive grief on insertion in my drive too, but with another
pristine tape I was able to write 5 meg of zeros (compression off),
then read it back out.  

  # mt -f /dev/nst0 datcompression 0
  # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nst0 bs=512 count=10240
  # dd if=/dev/nst0 of=/tmp/test.out bs=512 count=10240

Replace it with clients tape drive and it *very* slowly read it back
out.  My drive read it back in less than 10 seconds.  His drive was
still reading with the read/write light going on/off irregularly for
several minutes before I interrupted the dd read.  When I did
interrupt it, there was some data (circa 1+ meg) that had been read.
I swapped my drive back in and the same tape read fine in a few
seconds, just like before.  So it looks like something wrong with
clients tape drive.  I leave my tape drive connected and prepare to
go.

Then I think that we might as well test the power supply at the same
time, so I disconnected my temporary 300W power supply and reconnect
the case power supply (still attached to the box) and fire it back up.
Tape backup ran last night.  This morning, I have no contact with the
box again.  Looks (from home) like the same behavior of powering off.
So, it looks like the power supply probably *is* a culprit, but that
the client's tape drive is behaving badly as well.  Or maybe the
poweroff'ing behavior is related to the SCSI card or external cable.
We are definitely seeing a deviation between the tape drives, so that
explains part of the pathology, but evidently not all of it.

$150?? I don't think so. Try $50 for the 3-cd boxed set with a printed manual. 
For super-cheep, without manuals or pretty packaging, go to 
http://cheapbytes.com/

Doubtless someone will home-burn some CDs for you, but now you know about 
Cheapbytes.

According to one of the TV stations, there have been several hundred
fender-benders so far today. Please do not try to come to the Clinic. We
won't be there and we don't want someone hurt trying to get there.

Depends on the applicaton. For example in a cluster, or distributed
configuration single point is lower on the matrix. And even though
high(er) end mother boards, Intel, Serverworks for example may have
higher throughput, or be able to hold more RAM, the cost ratio may
not be all that good.

As in any system analysis, I suggest doing a matrix of requirements,
and then match up the kit you find.

You mentioned towers, did you go with a 'server' quality case ? 400W+
power supplies, extra fans, etc ? Sometimes $150-200 for a
case is worth it.

I'm not knocking higher end kit, there is a reason servers such as
the SUN 280s I filled a a rack with were worth the price.

Be careful about over spec-ing a UPS unit - Most units are designed to work in 
the 40% to 90% load range and will not regulate the power correctly out side 
that range. 
I worked on a server in a small business once where they had purchased a used 
2KVA unit with new batteries and one PC server on it that was constantly 
giving them problems. The "fix" was to plug in the server's monitor, their 
switch and three other computers to the UPS, after that I did not touch the 
server for 6 months.

Dang, I was going to go today because the traffic's not bad, and unlike

I do not have a speaker.  I have tried to get one, but I have gotten a
whole lot of silence.


We have a could of options at this point...

1) We can have a question and answer session.  People can ask the hard
questions and see what answers come up.

2) I can try and throw together a presentation.  (Probably be on RPM
construction.)

3) We can drink ourselves into an Advanced state.

4) We can cancel and try again next month.

Any comments?

I have Mandrake 10.1 on DVD.  (From the Linux Format issue.)

What format do you need?

I also have Fedora Core 2 & 3 and I can get pretty much anything else.
(SuSE, Slackware, Mandrake, Gentoo, CentOS, etc.)

What hardware are you planning on installing on?

Might check out ubuntu linux. They will even send you a CD in the mail.

Its very user friendly, and is debian-based, so installing software is a 
snap. I've heard great things about all hardware "just working" as well.

Subject: [PLUG] memtest86 interpretation
Message-ID: <86y8eto9ex.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


Someone hates me.

Back in December, I built an NFS server with four 80gig IDE drives, a
gig of RAM and a 2.53 GHz P4 on an Intel D845GBV motherboard.  Two
days ago, after working flawlessly for a month, it oops'd and locked
up.  I didn't notice it right away because I haven't moved anything
crucial to it yet.

I rebooted and it came back up fine.  A few hours later it crashed
again.  I decided to maybe try building a new kernel, however while
doing so I got classic random gcc errors.  When I'd rerun "make" it
would carry on over the same places it had seen errors.  Started
looking like maybe memory errors.  So, I downloaded memtest86 3.2 and
ran it.  Found errors.  There are two memory modules (crucial), and I
tried them one at a time in different slots and get errors on both of
them.  What are the chances two different parts failed at the same
time?  

Tomorrow I plan to test the memory in a different motherboard and see
what I get there.  I could try the CPU too.

Is this the same one you had a bad processor for a while back at the

Virtually nil.  You might want to swap in a different power supply and
rerun memtest86.  Also double check the BIOS memory settings to be sure
that the memory timing is using the SPD data.

I wouldn't bother swapping CPUs since the memory controller is in the
north bridge.  I think you may end up having to send the board back to
Intel.

Yeah, sort of.  

You might recall that last time I had replaced the motherboard while
trying to find the problem.  The machine wouldn't POST then and it
wasn't clear what the guilty party was.  When I discovered that the
CPU was bad (thanks to your generous loan), I RMA'd the CPU and got a
replacement that has worked since in a desktop box.

The box involved now has the replacement CPU, the pre-clinic
motherboard and brand new memory.  When I built this NFS server, I
ordered a new CPU (a 2.8 GHz) which I put in the desktop box and moved
the 2.53 GHz CPU into the NFS server.

So, actually, none of the physical parts I brought to the clinic are
involved now, except that it involves a motherboard that I had
previously replaced during debugging of that problem and a CPU that I
received as a consequence of that clinic.

The memory timing stuff is all set to default.  I'll see if I can
scrounge up another power supply to test.

Try the 'display' utility included with the ImageMagick suite. I think
ImageMagick is included with most distros.

Terry,

   Ah! I wasn't aware of this tool within ImageMagick! And, when it's not on
the distribution cds, it builds just fine.

   Many thanks. Problem solved.

Xv is in the RH Enterprise / White Box distribution.  You can try getting

Do the memory errors appear at the same spot or different ones?  Can you
get some good ram to test?  Possible that something has gone wrong on
the motherboard and its flaking.

Also make sure that your power supply is strong enough for the
motherboard.  Some of the AMD motherboards want a pretty beefy power
supply.

Bill,

   It was in RH 4.x-7.x and that's where I got used to using it.

   However, 'display' will do just fine, thank you.

go get it installed then I'll have a choice of two viewers.

Maybe some kind of cache failure?  These CPU's were originally boxed

fans in both boxes spin.  Beyond that, I can't say much.

   Did the 266MHz RAM work properly with the 2.53GHz CPU before this began?

Memtest86 spits out a bunch of information that mostly scrolls out of
the 10 lines dedicated to it.  Is there a way to capture that to a
file?  I *think* it is different every time, but am not sure.  The
Err-Bits column in Memtest86 shows 00001000 on all of the errors that
I've seen.

Just to round out the tests I posted a few minutes ago, for
"Configuration 4" I put the DDR,333,2.5CL memory back in, with the
2.53 GHz CPU in the desktop box and it failed too.

I hadn't explicitly tested it, but it has been installed in the NFS
box running for about a month without apparent problems.

And in configuration (2) we see that it passed memtest86 in the
desktop box with the 2.8GHz P4.

Because I need the NFS server more than the desktop for the next few
days, I've just plugged in the 2.8GHz CPU into the NFS server and am
compiling a new kernel there without the random gcc deaths I was
seeing before.

I think we have enough evidence to indict the CPU at this stage.

Maybe slightly worn at this point, but I think we can conclude that it
isn't a memory slot issue.  When the 2.8GHz CPU is in (on two
different motherboards), the memory tests fine.  When the 2.53GHz CPU
is in (on the same two different motherboards) the memory tests bad.
Two different sets of RAM.

I think we can conclude it is the 2.53GHz CPU.  I don't quite
understand what would cause it to fail just now, but the behavior
clearly moves with the CPU.  My records indicate the purchase was
about 15 months ago, and (after the original was RMA'd) it has been
performing without obvious flaw over that period, up until last
Thursday evening.

If the problem follows the CPU, then it pretty much has to be the CPU.
It's a bit odd that you are able to run any code at all.

You've been building up some nice detective skills lately.  Now I know
who to call when I hit a nasty hw problem.

Unfortunately, it isn't so much a matter of developing detective
skills, it is the availability of the spares necessary to inform the
detective skills.  That, and the fortitude to tear apart working
hardware (insert chest pain here) in order to create the test
facilities.  ;-)

It *is* odd, isn't it?

I had a similar thing happen to me some time back.  I had artifacts
appearing when I watched DVDs or AVIs on my old Duron 650.  They would
get pretty bad, but then drop off to nothing.  If I used VLC on the box,
they were there.  If I used VLS on it, then VLC on a different box, they
weren't there.

Sometimes (not always) mencoder-created files would have these
artifacts.  Sometimes they were clean.  Sometimes mencoder would seg
fault instead of encoding.

I figured it was the video chip on my motherboard, so I swapped
motherboards.  I was wrong.  Eventually I finally replaced the CPU...
and the problem magically disappeared.  I'd never heard of CPUs halfway
going out like that... it was an educational experience.  :-)

I loved that old Duron, though.. it was a good chip.

Hi,

I've been working on real-time networked strategy game that incorporates
actual Geographic Information Systems (GIS) information and NATO map
symbology standards.

Here's the project's (temporary) web site with screen images here:

  http://www.intrinzix.net

I can map the entire globe this way.

This project has turned out to be a fun way to use work with GIS and
it's reasonable to say that I've learned a good deal about civil
engineering as well.

I'm happy to share the source code; I should have a CVS repository up in
a few days. 

Enjoy!

Wouldn't it be easier to have the sender rename the file and change the .exe 
extension, or just drop it? Or does amavis inspect the content of the file in 
addition to looking at the filename?

amavis runs the file command to determine the file type, so renaming 
wouldn't help.

I figured out my mistake.  Whitelisting only works on the recipient address,
since the sender address is easily forged.

That should be *your* e-mail address, not the sender's.  Also, you might
consider upgrading... There have been lots of improvements.

   I ended up giving up on trying to build it. The feh source wants imlib2.
So, I get that and try to build it, but it wants 'edb', a wrapper for the
Berkeley DB (of a particular vintage, I gather) and I cannot find 'edb'.
There was also a freetype version issue. So, feh! I'll live without it. :-)

Thanks anyway,

Rich

That will work with his version of amavisd-new; however, newer versions can
be configured to hold or reject password-protected zip files in response to
the recent virus that sent them.

Another one is `xloadimage`. I suspect most distributions have it

This just in:

http://www.osdl.org/newsroom/press_releases/2005/2005_01_17_beaverton.html

Andrew Tridgell, the Australian fellow who started both the Samba and
the Rsync projects, has joined the Open Source Development Labs of
Beaverton as the second appointed Fellow (Linus Torvalds was the first).

tridge, as you may remember, visited us in August and attended the
Advanced Topics meeting for Chris Wright's talk on the Virtualization
of Linux.

The article doesn't mention it, but I assume he will stay in Oz and
work remotely.  Perhaps it is time to lobby OSDL to hire Larry Wall
of Perl fame as their *third* appointed Fellow.  

Then they can set up a subsidiary, the Free Software Development Labs,
and hire Stallman.

Thanks Keith.  I guess I never took the time to find or look at the OSDL 
site.  Got off to all kinds of other interesting areas after read the

1) Unmount the file system, and remove it's current mount point.
    # umount /hot2
    # rmdir /hot2

2) Update the entry in /etc/fstab.
    # vi /etc/fstab
        ... use whatever editor you like ... my bias is 'vi'
        ... change the "hot2" in 2nd column to "hoth2"

3) Create a new mount point (an empty directory with the correct pathname),
   and mount it.
    # mkdir /hoth2
    # mount /hoth2

4) ... if you need to change the filesystem label, that easily done, too.

Perhaps I don't understand what your problem is but all you should have to
do is create the directory /hoth2 and edit /etc/fstab to mount your second
disk to it.
umount /hot2
mkdir /hoth2
vi /etc/fstab
mount /hoth2

Let me know if you need more...

It sounds like you're looking for the e2label command.

NAME
   e2label - Change the label on an ext2 filesystem

SYNOPSIS
   e2label device [ new-label ]

DESCRIPTION
   e2label  will  display  or  change  the  filesystem  label  on the ext2
   filesystem located on device.

   If the optional argument new-label is not present, e2label will  simply
   display the current filesystem label.

   If  the  optional  argument new-label is present, then e2label will set
   the filesystem label to be new-label.  Ext2 filesystem labels can be at
   most  16  characters  long;  if new-label is longer than 16 characters,
   e2label will truncate it and print a warning message.

OK, some silly semantics: There are two things you could be talking
about: the "mount point" (where the file system shows up in the
directory structure, e.g. /boot) and the "label", which is a name
stuck on a file system.  Red Hat likes to make the label of a
filesystem the same as its mount point, so the filesystem mounted at
/boot would be labeled "/boot", but it don't gotta be that way.

I'm gonna guess you want to do both, so it'd be like this:

Figure out what device is /hot2 (e.g. /dev/hdc3)

Become Root

edit /etc/fstab, find the line that looks something like:
  label=/hot2   /hot2   ext3  blahblah  some numbers
and change both instances of /hot2 to /hoth2

umount /hot2

mv /hot2 /hoth2

If it's ext2 or ext3, do:
  tune2fs -L /hoth2 /dev/hdc3  (or whatever device is /hot2)

mount /hoth2

and Bob's yer uncle.

  Or you can use the "tune2fs -L" to change the label.

I screwed up a bios flash on a consumer electronics device (in an attempt
to modify it for running Linux, so you could call this "on topic").

I can spend forty bucks on a new rom chip and then deal with the
installation or find someone who can remove the chip and write the proper
image to the thing.

I've openned the device and located the eprom and it's clear of other
components and looks like as simple a procedure as that sort of thing
could be.

I have the image that should work.  I have a backup image (old version)
should that fail.

Whom should I call?  Anybody here got equipment and skills to give me
a hand?  Some remuneration is totally possible, but I don't think I could
afford the going corporate rate.

Any suggestions welcome.

What's the part number on the device?  I'd like to know what I'm signing
myself up for.  Also, I'll need to check whether I can program it once
it is removed.

This is going to cost you at least one pitcher, and that's not Bud either.

Might as well throw a socket on there as long as you're taking the
entire ROM device off the board. That way it'll only cost Jeme a pint
or two the next time he needs it reprogrammed. :-)

Theoretically, I can flash it whenever I want... just so long as I make
sure it's the right version of the right bios.

Apparently the earlier versions of the device had a dipswitch to toggle
between banks of memory on the ROM.  That would be ideal.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0501190910180.13073-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I'm attempting to move from sendmail, and a logon ( to access pine ) to 
IMAP for my personal mail account.

So far I've got postfix running just fine, calling procmail for the
delivery agent, processing my personal .procmailrc file ( placing messages
in folders ), and Thunderbird connecting to the IMAP server (IMAPS).  The
issue I'm having Thunderbird doens't see folder layout ( Maildir ) that
procmail (?) is creating.  In the directory $HOME/Maildir the messages end
up -- mostly -- in the correct directory(/folder) but in a subdirectory
named cur.

Anyone using this combination that could offer some insight as to why
Thunderbird doesn't see the folders.  I've done this with a different IMAP
server and it works.  ( I know about subscribing to the folders and
refreshing the folder list, etc. )  The main difference is the other IMAP
server uses mbox and I'm trying to use Maildir.

Much as I like pine I'd prefer to use one mail client to access the half
dozen accounts I have to monitor from two different locations ( home and
work ).


TIA,
Rod

Subject: [PLUG] JavaScript Communication Between Frames
Message-ID: <200501191035.01431.rsteff.l@comcast.net>

Are then any JavaScript guru's out there?

I understand from a book I'm reading (Danny Goodman's JavaScript Handbook) 
that it is possible to put JavaScript code in the head of a frameset page 
that can be called from the other pages loaded by the frameset. I've seen an 
example work, but I don't see what I'm missing to get my example to work. 

Here's my example:

(file name: twoFrame.html)
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Two Frame Test</title>
		<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
		<!-- Start Script
			// function to process the click of the button
			function btnClick() {
				document.form1.text1.value = "You clicked this button."
				document.form2.text2.value = "You clicked the button on the other form."
			}
		// End Script -->
		</script>
	</head>
	<frameset frameborder=1 rows="25%,*">
		<frame name="frameOne" src="frameOne.html">
		<frame name="frameTwo" src="frameTwo.html">
	</frameset>
</html>

(file name: frameOne.html)
<html>
	<body>
		This is Frame One<br />
		<form name = "form1" action = "action">
		  <input type = "button" value = "Push this button"
			onclick="parent.btnClick()" />
		  <br />
		  <br />
		  <input type="text" name="text1" size="50" />
		</form>
	</body>
</html>

(file name: frameTwo.html)
<html>
	<body>
		This is Frame Two<br />
		<form name = "form2" action = "action">
		  <input type="text" name="text2" size="50" />
		</form>
	</body>
</html>


I assume there's something important I'm missing. Any idea what? And, any 
recommendation on where to find JavaScript examples that do this sort of 
thing?

Thanks in advance.

It isn't Thunderbird not seeing them, it's Dovecot ignoring them.  If
the folder isn't created/subscribed in Dovecot, it doesn't exist to
Dovecot.... you can edit /path/to/Maildir/root/.subscriptions manually
to add these additional folders if you want to.

I'd stop Dovecot while you do that, though.

The way *I* set up new folders is I create them in my MUA *then* set up
Procmail to send mail to them.

So if I understand this correctly the folders created by procmail aren't 
recognized by dovecot.

I have to create the folder using Thunderbird, ( subscribe to it, )
then create the procmail recipe(s)?

That sucks air!  Are there other options file messages that might work
better with dovecot?  A method to force dovecot (re)read the user's 
mail setup?

Little more reading on dovecot is in order on my part.

Never mind.  Rebooted and installed from terminal mode. Went smoothly.

I've had cases like this under Red Hat and usually find I need to erase the 
following files;

/var/lib/rpm/__db*

P.S. I don't know if Fedora 3 is the same as RH in terms of file placement.

I'm not a JavaScript guru, but I've done something like that.  You
might try accessing the forms using the document.forms array (instead
of by name).

Like so:


document.forms[0].text1.value = "You clicked this button."
document.forms[1].text2.value = "You clicked the button on the other
form."

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0501191342530.14916-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

This will seem pretty lame I'm sure but I'm having a problem with
determining , visually , if the slots on a main board are PCI 2.2 or
earlier ... and if this tells be if they are 5 or 3.3 volt.  I found a
document on the web that talks about the PCI standard ( I can't remember
where I found ) but it says it's by Peripheral Express.  It claims that 
PCI 2.2 was suppose to be in effect 1998 and 2.2 is suppose to be 3.3 
volt.  I'm looking at a couple of main boards ( one fairly new < 1 yr, and 
the other 4+ years old ) and they both have slots that according to the 
document are 5 volt PCI slots.

So to the hardware gurus ; was/is there any significant fudging going on 
with the standard?  And what will happen if I , by mistake , plug a 3.3 
card ( universal form ) into a 5 volt slot and power uP>

And does anyone have a good reference to PCI information.  Something a 
mear mortal could mostly understand?

Remove RPM lock files, it's usually done from rc.sysinit so if you
grep it for "rpm" you should find where they are, on FC1 it's done
like this:

rm -f /var/lib/rpm/__db*

While I can't directly answer your question.... about 99% of the time,
when working with things inside your computer... if it plugs in in, it
won't fry anything, including itself.

It may not *work* ... but it won't cause any damage.

If a 3.3V PCI card would be fried in a 5V slot, it *should* be notched
such that it cannot go in to a 5V slot.

The same is true, generally speaking, of RAM, AGP, CPUs, power supplies
(except I think it was Gateway), etc....

Now, this isn't a steadfast 100% rule... it's a generalization.  :-)

Thanks again !

So look at the POST messages, if it says PCI 2.2, plug in ( after 
powering down ) , make some burnt offerings , and reboot. Hopefully those 
burnt offerings will the only thing that burns.

Just becaue I made this mistake I'll ask.  You did substitute in the 
<input> tags id for text1 and text2 ?

Typically cgi uses the name and JavaScript uses the id.

Both 5V and 3.3V slots are allowed by PCI 2.2.  The keying of a 5V slot
is closer to the center of the motherboard.  The keying of a 3.3V slot
is closer to the edge of the motherboard.  

It's not surprising that both motherboards have 5V slots.  They are
far more common.  3.3V tends to show up in high performance situations.
3.3V is required for 66 MHz PCI.  5V 66MHz slots are not allowed by the
spec.  Once the jump is made to 66 MHz, it's not unusual to see the slots
go to 64 bits at the same time.  BTW, it is legal to install a 32 bit
card into a 64 bit slot.

A universal PCI card is just that.  It can be plugged into either type
of slot.  5V and 3.3V cards are keyed such that they can only be installed
in an appropriate slot.

The Mindshare book "PCI System Architecture" is relatively readable, but
it's probably overkill for your needs.

Can't say about PCI version, but there is a notching system to ensure
the right cards go in the right slots.  If you look at a card, you'll
see a notch or two cut in the PCI connector.  If you look at a slot,
you'll see a li'l bar across the connector that slides into the notch.

So the bar keeps the card out of the slot, unless it's notched in the
right place.  And it'll be notched in the right place if the card
voltage is the same as the slot voltage.

Some cards are dual-voltage and have two notches.

So if the card fits, the voltage is OK.

Generally, it seems like I only see 3.3V PCI in server-class machines
with 64-bit PCI slots, and most of those are dual-voltage anyway.

Reminds me of the introduction of unleaded-gas cars, which had special
filler-necks that wouldn't take a leaded gas nozzle.

Galen, Aaron;

Thanks for the enlightenment.

The main board has a 5 volt slot and the card is universal.  So I've just 
just messaged the supplier to find out if it is 5 or 3.3 volt.

And I might have saved some electrons if I'd have just said it was a 
TDM400P for an Asterisk system I'm proto-typing and asked if anyone 
is doing Asterisk and knows?


Cheers,
Rod

If you are asking whether your universal card is 5V or 3.3V, your
question doesn't make sense.  A universal card is just that.  It can be
used in either a 5V or 3.3V PCI slot.  That's why the edge connector of
your card has two cutouts.  This is to allow it to be installed
in either a 5V or 3.3V PCI slot.

The picture on the diginum web site shows two cutouts in the edge
connector.  The card that is pictured is a universal card.

I'm planning to attend tonight's advanced topics meeting.  I can 
explain more there if you like.

Message-ID: <41EF33ED.6010901@ahapala.net>

To add calendaring to Thunderbird, go to the page below and save the 
linux thunderbird calendar extension to your computer. Then in Tbird go 
to Tools->Extensions, click install, and then browse to your download. 
You'll have to restart Tbird to finish the install.

http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/download.html#download_thunderbird

After you restart Tbird there will be a new menu entry (Tools->Calendar) 
to bring up the calendar.

Then you can find public calendars and copy the .ics links for a public
calendar and, in the calendar app, choose File->"Subscribe to Remote
Calendar" and paste in your .ics link.

or the "mother" of all ical sites

http://icalshare.com/

Speaking of public calendars, would this be something that PLUG would 
benefit from for our various events? If we could get all the info in the 
calendar entry then a cron job script could mail the list a day or two 
ahead to keep up the usual notification. Anyone set up the server side 
of public calendars with webDAV?

Thunderbird rocks! :-)

That did it. I had tried frameOne.form1.text1.value earlier, but didn't

I figured it must be something like that. Thanks.

It depends on the speed of your connection. Typically it will be 300- 600 
megabytes of files. 

Sid works fine, the "unstable" name sounds scarier than it is. My main 
workstation is a Sid box. The only drawback is the lack of security updates- 
there might be a few, but don't count on them.

Well, that depends on how fat your internet pipe is. I guess it also
depends on how much you have installed. I wouldn't be suprised if it was
150Mb for a gnome/kde upgrade to Sid. I've had no trouble upgrading from
testing to unstable in the past.

Once you are on Sid be ready for the occasional blip associated with
updates. As great as the developers/packagers are, sometimes bugs come
through. When a problem does come up, make sure you read the error
message thoroughly, they usually are good pointers to what's gone wrong.
I find the #debian chat channel on irc.debian.org a good place to go.
Many times the #topic will contain info on fixing up to the minute problems.

Also, I'd recommend updating pretty frequently. I'd much rather have a
few updates more often than big, hairy updates less frequently.

Wow, 300-600Mb. Much more than I thought. I only run one Sid machine and
that is my laptop (and it's been sid for a long time). I wouldn't want
to keep up with the updates on more than one :-)

Have fun :-)

You're right, it shouldn't be a huge amount. I don't know what I was thinking 
of, but 150-200 is more realistic. Never mind. :) Anyway you can find out 
easily enough:

# apt-get dist-upgrade -u

or 

# apt-get dist-upgrade --dry-run

will show you what will happen without changing anything.

Well, go for it if you don't mind completely random, possibly severe 
breakage.

How fast is your connection?  Are you using a local (faster) mirror or 
the main, US mirror that Debian tells you not to use unless it's the 
fastest for you (debian.oregonstate.edu is probably your best bet 
around here)?

Security updates are about the only thing that get fast-tracked from sid 
to sarge.

What do you mean, fast-tracked? As far as I know from hanging out on the 
lists, whatever security updates are made to unstable are few and far 
between. There is a security archive for testing, but it's not very active. 
Or am I missing something?

http://www.debian.org/security/faq#testing
Q: How is security handled for testing and unstable?
A: The short answer is: it's not. 

The lack of security updates in either testing or unstable, and the antiquity 
of stable have me looking for another distribution to use on servers.

If you want to take this a step further check out the following:

This will link your webdav folder to the phpicalendar calendars folder 
you'll get a webpage interface to your calendars as well.

Subject: [PLUG] Random? Crashing of router
Message-ID: <41f575d1050120110442226f10@mail.gmail.com>

I'm having some various issues with a system I'm using as a router,
and am hoping for some general advice.

I think part of the problem may be two Compaq dual port Nettelligent
ethernet cards using the thunderlan (TLAN) driver. These cards have
had problems in two seperate systems, running both 2.4 and 2.6
kernels.

When I awoke this morning, no network traffic could go anywhere. I
investigated and found the router box completely locked up. No
messages had been written to console, and upon hard-rebooting and
checking the syslog, I found a bunch of garbage. Here's a snippit:

--- snip ---

Jan 20 07:35:34 router syslog-ng[1130]: syslog-ng version 1.6.5 starting
--- snip ---

Note the series of messages from NETDEV WATCHDOG to ethX: Link active
occurs several hundred times in the logs prior to the end of logging.
I am guessing the garbage is due to fs corruption after the freeze?

The only conclusions I can draw are related to the TLAN drivers and/or
hardware, since this box ran fine with 2 Realtek gigabit NICs and two
Intel pro100 NICs for months. The more I think about it, all the
problems related to this box have affected networks connected via TLAN
cards. The only time other networks lost connectivity to the router
was today when it locked up completely.

Any advice would be appreciated. Google found some discussions about
TLAN driver issues, especially on other platforms, but nothing seemed
relevant to this. (Maybe I don't know how to search effectively... I
tried "linux (thunderlan OR tlan) problems"

I'm running kernel 2.4.28-gentoo-r5 on this box, patched with
2.4.28-ja2.diff from http://www.ssi.bg/~ja/#combinations

TIA,
Aaron

Message-ID: <1106264864.10312.5.camel@dagon.fnordora.org>


I need to build a small dmz device.  I prefer it being small and cheap.
I may have to "just use an old PC for it.

What I need is a device that runs Linux and has three ethernet ports.

I have two networks that are separate, but they want to share a printer.

What seems to be the only useful solution will be to build a small linux
box with an iptables setup that will nat each network to a dmz network
that has the printer.  (But not allow traffic between the two networks.)

Anyone know of a small cheap piece of hardware that will do this or am I
stuck with an old PC and three ethernet cards?

Hello all,

I have a client who can not ftp to my server.  I'm using vsftpd and I
turned on the protocol logging but after he his prompted for a user
and that returns successful my logs say he is sent the password prompt
then it says he timesout.

He reports to me the same behavior.  Any thoughts?  I have tried the
same user/server and such from many different host and ftp clients and
they all worked.  He is using WS_FTP Pro, Version 8.03.  I've tried
and older version of ws_ftp and that worked both passive and not.

thanks,

Josh

At the AT meeting last night I mentioned how impressive the Athlon 64
Winchester core power numbers are.  Here's a couple of charts that show
it dissipating just 3W at idle and ~30W under load.  Note that these
numbers are measured while running Windows.  I don't know whether the
Linux numbers would be similar or not.

Nice.

I need to determine which version of the Athlon 64 3700+ is in this
laptop.

You'll need to add a wall wart and CompactFlash card; should total around $225.
Of course, you'll also need something on the PC to actually *write* the CF
card--SanDisk makes a PCMCIA for around $12.)

Galen/Russell,

This was the thing whose name I couldn't think of last night at the AT
meeting, in case "the thing in the ads in the back of Linux Journal"
wasn't descriptive enough.

This was in the context of looking for a diskless front-end for a MythTV
project. I'm noting that these don't have video out, but I suppose you
could put a VGA card in the PCI slot on the model Wil linked to. Maybe
an EPIA box would be easier:

You definitely don't want to try to use a Soekris for video stuff; it's
got a mere 133MHz 486-class processor.  Good enough for a firewall,
access point or remote data-collection unit, but not for video or audio.

Yup.  With exceptions as rare as major lottery jackpot winners,

Have you considered a Linksys WRT54G?  With OpenWRT (for example) you
can vlan each of the ethernet ports to a separate network.  You can
turn off the radio if you don't want/need it.  You won't be able to
connect your printer to it with USB or parallel, of course.

Also beware that the newest hardware versions break previously working
OpenWRT and similar because of some new components (e.g. new broadcom
ethernet device replaced an adm part).  See <http://openwrt.org/> for
details.

check your firewall settings.  Could be blocking the data ports after
the establishment of a session.  The user may have to try passive
mode.  

Active mode establishes another session on another port from the client.
You need to have the server establish the session to go through your
firewall.

Thanks Ken.  I got it to work.  He is having big DNS issues but I
can't resolve those and he has router problems with his ISP.  Then
again there is the fact that he did enter in the wrong IP.  Blah.  It
was a pain to trouble shoot and spent a long time figuring it out.

Although your information is great.  I do think I've set that up
correctly.  I have experienced these settings before being all wrong.

thanks.

Seems an inelegant solution, but if the above is *all* that is required
then a WRT54G could do the job. Have the uplink/WAN port be on one
network, and the printer being part of the other. The printer does appear
on one of the two networks, but the above doesn't strictly disallow this.

I'm unsure whether it will beat the price of the already suggested
options, but a pair of WRT54Gs could be used and make a full DMZ network
for the printer.

First, make sure you update that serial in your zone files when you
update the zone files.  :-)

Second, make sure your name servers are listed in the zone files.

Third, make sure the master server allows transfers from the slaves
(named.conf).

Fourth, make sure the slaves know where the master is (named.conf).

If you've added the specified slave server as a server to send notifies, 
everytime the zone if modified it will automaticaly send a notify.

named.conf:

zone "somedomain.com" {
         type master;
         file "/chroot/blah/somedomain.com";
         allow-transfer { 66.66.66.66; 77.77.77.77; };
         };

And your slave should be set to receive the notify, by having a similar 
setup, by instead of type master; it will be type slave;
And so-forth.

Understand.  But is there a way that I can now tell the slave to go
ask the master for changes and new files and have those transferred
down?  Or have the Master send send record changes to the slave when
they are created?

It seems with nsnotify I should be able to fun that or nsupdate and
have the slave pull all the new records and changes down.

thanks,

Josh

The slave shouldnt be asking for updates. Once the master loads a new 
zone file, restarts, or has a zone update, it will send a notify to all 
the slaves, and start a zone-transfer.

When BIND notices a new zone file (by the serial increase), it sends out
notifies to the slave zones mentioned in the zone file.  The slaves then
contact the master defined in their named.conf file and grab the new
zone file.

Ah, that is what I was thinking should happen but wasn't seeing that. 
I'll check over my files and make sure the Master knows about the
Slave and the Slave knows about the Master.

Thanks. If I just restart Bind on the Slave then the Master after I
have the configs right will they transfer over the files?

Subject: [PLUG] URL viewer in Pine on Mac OS X
Message-ID: <Pine.OSX.4.62.0501210759520.866@paul-heinleins-computer.local>

I recently switched jobs, and my main workstation these days is a 
PowerBook G4 running Mac OS X.

The Apple Mail application is pretty good, but I'm more or less hooked 
on pine and really don't want to change clients. So I compiled Pine 
4.62 and it runs great.

It took me a little while to figure out how to invoke Safari (the 
KHTML-based browser from Apple) from pine, but a little googling 
pointed me at the open(1) application and from there it was easy 
going. The resulting entry in my .pinerc is

url-viewers="/usr/bin/open _URL_"

open(1) will automatically figure out my preferred browser (I'm using 
Safaris but may switch to Firefox in the future) and feed it the URL. 
Pretty slick!

Is your server by chance running a 2.6 kernel?  I had a similar problem,
changed to a 2.4 kernel and everything started working.

Good Luck,

Note that if you aren't in control of your slave server, for instance
it's a secondary provided by your registrar, you can't force the slave
to start the transfer.  You can only send the notify and wait for the
secondary NS to initiate update.  This may take much longer than you'd 
like.  

If I recall correctly the secondary is allowed to defer requesting the
update until the refresh time limit has elapsed.  If you're planning 
network changes and wish for your DNS updates to propagate more quickly
cranking this value down in advance is one option for getting updates
propagated more quickly.  Just remember to reset it to a reasonable 
value after your environment has stabilized.

   I want to confirm that if I want filesystems on a second workstation to be
backed up on tape in a drive installed on another box, then the filesystems
must be exported from the remote system and nfs-mounted on the system with
the tape drive. Is this correct?

   I think I need to modify my cron jobs so they mount the exported
filesystems before running the backup, then umount them afterwards.

So say that I control both master and slave. I do.  Now say I want to
add a new slave or have added new records to the master and want to
tell the slave to add them as well.  The only way I've found so far is
to go to the slave and add the record and then it will keep the
updates in sync.  There doesn't seem to be a way to have the master
tell the slave to add a new record.

Is this normal?  Or is this just a big timing issue and for some of my
none controlled slaves it will just take a while?

thanks,

Josh

Isn't that the only way the first drive will be able to see the second
computer?  Unless you are using some other protocol in your backup
util like ftp I'd have to think you will have to mount the drives
first.  We mount the drives here for that exact same reason.

Josh,

   Yup. I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't overlooking a
better/easier/more elegant way. Otherwise, sure, the tape unit doesn't know
about anyone not local.

"must"?  no.

You can run tar on the remote (backed-up) machine and pipe it through
ssh and dd it onto tape, e.g.:

  ssh root at remotehost 'tar -C / clf - .' | dd of=/dev/nst0 obs=<tapeblocksize>

The corresponding compare pass is something like this:

  dd ibs=<tapeblocksize> if=/dev/nst0 | ssh root at remotehost 'tar -C / -dlf -'

Salt to taste.

Well my favorite more elegant way is to have the little pixie faries
come by and do the work magically for me at night.  Unfortunately,
they tend to never show and when I've tried to explain to others that
these little fairies were suppose to backup the system they all seem
to move away from me.  :-)

Josh,

   Now wait a minute, isn't there a cron version written by the pixie? Oops!
That's Vixie cron, not pixie cron. Perhaps that's why it doesn't work for
you.

   I'll export and nfs-mount so the fullbru backup can do it automagically

Of course, this very much depends on the tools you are using.  Rdump
will push data at a remote file, and the client process can be
initiated from a server by running a command with ssh.  It sounds
like you want to pull data with a server, in which case you will
indeed need to remote-mount the files on the server.

But those are all 1980's solutions;  expensive, slow, insecure,
inconvenient, inefficient, and a lot of other perjorative adjectives.
At the risk of sounding like a broken record, look at dirvish 
( www.dirvish.org ) or some other rsync-based disk-to-disk mechanism.
The savings in effort, cost, and time are spectacular, without even
getting into the security and indexing and ease-of-restore issues. 

I gave a dirvish presentation at the PANUG meeting last night, and
like the presentations last year at PLUG and at LinuxFest, it was
well received.  I will be giving a similar presentation next Thursday
( 2005-01-27 ) evening at the Oregon IEEE Consultant's Network
meeting, http://www.eeconsult.org/members/presentation.html .  Public
meeting, all are welcome - if they can tolerate IHOP food.   I also
would be glad to head out to Gresham/Troutdale and present, if someone
provides a venue and an audience of a dozen or more.

Cast OUT those Satanic tape drives!  Be reborn in BITS EVERLASTING! 
HEAL!  :-)

Hi Josh,

Are you talking about adding new zones? I don't think there's a way to 
have the master notify the slave about new zones that exist. The slave 
will need to have the new zone set up in it's conf file. The master will 
notify the slave about updates to zones the slave already knows about.

Of course I've been wrong before, if there is a way then I'm sure 
someone here will know :)

I used to work at an ISP, and sometimes we ran into weird situations 
where we wanted to get the slave to update immediately (like when 
someone on our end had screwed up a record). In those cases we would use 
the named-xfer command to manually slurp over the record. man named-xfer 
for more info.

Subject: [PLUG] ssh less secure when PasswordAuthentication allowed?
Message-ID: <20050121201821.GZ27236@peak.org>

I always configure sshd to not allow PasswordAuthentication, believing
that it's most secure if I only accept connections from hosts whose
public keys I already have -- my work machine, my ISP's shell account
servers, etc.

Now I have a Nokia 9300 for which there's a version of Putty.
Unfortunately, that Putty doesn't support ssh2-compatible keys.  So if
I want to connect into my home network from my phone I have to allow
password authentication.  (That or allow ssh1, which seems like a
worse idea.)

I can't find any online explanation of how/whether disallowing
password authentication is any less secure.  Does anybody know of one
-- or just plain know?

BTW, Sourceforge.net's ssh configuration allowed me to connect, and I
was able to use emacs to add a new page to a website -- all from a
cellphone.  Pretty cool stuff!

Yes I would like to add new Zones.  I'd think that the slaves like a
caching DNS server would be able to take directions from a Master. 
Then again there has always been cases in history when the slaves
revolt.  Maybe if I refer to them as clients then they would listen to
and obey my primary server. :-)

If this is truely the case then I'd be surprised as that would mean
everytime a new Zone is added each slave has to also be manually
updated.

I'll look into named-xfer and see what I find.

Thanks,

Josh

Funny.  Okay.  Maybe I'll write a Pixie Program tonight.  That dirvish

Subject: [PLUG] Apache Mod Q'
Message-ID: <20050121125951.18c5fd3d.jason@vancleve.com>

I've got a problem trying to get Apache to work my way.  I have several
virtual hosts, all of which map to J2EE Web app's (CGI, as far as Apache
is concerned).  Now, I want to have a certain base URL--relevant to site
A--to map to a different base URL (different hostname) that is relevant
to site B.  So,

  http://a.org/foo/bar/* --> http://b.net/fubar/*

mod_alias doesn't do it, because that only seems to work within a single
virtual host.  mod_rewrite changes the URL, but then it reports an error
400 "Bad Request" for the new URL, "http://b.net/fubar/whatever".

This is odd, because "http://b.net/fubar/whatever" works using wget on
the server itself.  Any idea what I'm missing?

I'm trying to avoid mod_proxy, because that seems indirect and
inefficient.  Is apache unable to rewrite a request to one virtual host
and then process it in another, without that external proxy action?

Thanks,

--Jason

No, this isn't normal.  Your slave should log when it receives a notify message
from the master, which should happen pretty much immediately when you reload
the master.  If you're editing zone files on the slave, you've either not
got a real slave or named cannot write to the zone files or something else.

I suggest spending a little time reading over the BOG (BIND Operations
Guide) and/or "DNS & BIND".

Within the VirtualHost entry for a.org (or in any relevant .htaccess 
file), can't you just do a redirect?

Redirect permanent  /foo/bar/  http://b.net/fubar/

Well, now you're talking about something different.  The master/slave
notification only applies to zones that are already configured.  When
you say "records", these are the NS, SOA, MX, A, PTR entries in each
zone; a zone maps roughly to a domain name--nakedape.cc for example.
When I set up DNS for nakedape.cc, I create an a zone file on the
master:

######
$TTL 14400
@ IN SOA dns1.nakedape.cc. hostmaster.nakedape.cc. (
                2004112801
                86400
                3600
                2592000
                14400
            )
                IN    NS    dns1.nakedape.cc.
                IN    NS    dns2.nakedape.cc.
                IN    MX    10    smtp1.nakedape.cc.
@               IN    A    63.105.18.11
www             IN    A    63.105.18.11
# etc
######

However, I *also* have to tell BIND about the zone:

# /etc/named.conf on the master
zone "nakedape.cc" IN {
    type master;
    file "master/nakedape.cc";
};

# /etc/named.conf on the slave
zone "nakedape.cc" IN {
    type slave;
    file "slave/nakedape.cc";
    masters { 63.105.18.11; };
};

And yes, there's not way within BIND itself to create this slave configuration.
I use rsync and some scripts manage the domains I host.  My /etc/named.conf
has 'include "master.conf"' or 'include "slave.conf"' depending on the host.
I run a script that generates the master.conf and slave.conf from a list of
zones on the master, than rsync all the files over to slave.  (In reality,
mine's a tad messier because I'm using views.)

As I've said, ssh is one of those pixie fairies.  Or maybe it is three

Let's make sure we're talking the same language here.

Zone:  a domain record

So when I add a new zone to my bind configuration, say myhotnewdomain.org,
just inserting the secondary's information in the zone file won't cause the
secondary to pick it up.  

Otherwise I'd be able to make Wil be a DNS secondary for all my domaains whether
he wanted to be or not.  

What I can expect is for the secondaries to reflect changes in zones/domains that
they are configured to carry.

Well, no, I can't do a client-side redirect for a couple of reasons. 
First, I want b.net to appear as part of a.org, so I just need the munge
those URLs correctly.  Second, b.net is not a real domain, just
something I put into my server's hosts file, so that the virtual host
will work.  (This is a hack, but I'm really not sure how else to do that
using virtual hosts).

So I want apache to back out of the a.org virtual host and invoke the
one for b.net, transparently to the client.

In that case, I think mod_proxy (via mod_rewrite) is your only hope.

   # the first of these two is a workaround for IE
   RewriteRule  ^/foo/bar$       http://b.net/fubar/   [P]
   RewriteRule  ^/foo/bar/(.*)$  http://b.net/fubar/$1 [P]

That's the only solution I've ever been able to devise with the 
problem set you describe.

I added unstable sources to sources.list for my Sarge
installation and did a dist-upgrade. Nothing dramatic
happened, although KDE 3.3 is noticeably different
from 3.2 when it starts. All services are okay.

You don't get a new kernel? I may install a kernel
image package, since I have no unusual requirements.

My two enduring headaches are: I haven't been able to
set up Java. I was hoping it would be easier than it
turned out to be. Same for mplayer. The unofficial
package gives me signal 11 errors, and building it
from source is not an easy task.

I know Carla Schroder's book is at Powell's. If I have
time this weekend I'll drop by there and take a look
at it. Hopefully it has a large proportion of
Debian-specific information, since the book I have on
Fedora says a lot about shell programming, etc.

Hi Eric,

The reason it's better to use keys if possible is that a password can be 
guessed or social engineered out of someone. When you have a key that's 
protected with a passphrase, then the attacker would is required to get 
both the key and the passphrase associated with it.

Using password authentication with SSH is pretty secure, though. The 
passwords are encrypted, so they are not vulnerable to being sniffed as 
plaintext telet or FTP passwords are. For protecting your home network, 
I think password authentication should be fine.

Just make sure to keep your sshd patched and up to date.

Well that isn't quite true because the Slave could be configured to
only accept transfers from a particular Master.  In fact, that is
already in place.  So to send a create Zone from the Trusted Master to
a Trusted Slave would make a lot of sense to me.  Having me have to
create a Master Zone record for example.com on the Master server then
go create a Slave Zone record for example.com on the Slave seems a
very inefficient process to acheive what everyone is going to want to
do any way.

But heck that is just me.  I expect slaves to listen to the master not
listen after I told them what to listen for.

Jason,

I do this a lot with my computer.  I just use:

ProxyPass /foo/bar/* http://b.net/fubar/*
ProxyPassReverse /foo/bar/* http://b.net/fubar/*

inside the virtual host for a.org.  You mentioned something about not
wanting to use mod_proxy but this works great for me.  Don't know if
it won't work because of some J2EE items you may be using but I don't
see why not.  I have used it for my J2EE servers as well.

Thanks Wil.  It still baffles me why anyone would not want the slaves
to get and receive a notification from a trusted master to add a zone
in the remote slaves.  This would save a lot of time.  So, what this
means is that I need to manually(or write a script) to create the new
Zone.  Sorry about the 'records' lingo use poor choice.

I would think that Bind would have thought about this and added the
creation call to the notification method in the master.  Sure would
save lots of time and would be really simple to achieve.  Or I would
think.

Personally, I'd rather add them by hand than have the chance that 
someone could get around Bind's security and add them for me. Some of 
the phishing attackers now are compromising DNS servers to make it seem 
as if users are really going to the domain they think they are. If they 
could trick servers to automatically add new zones that could be pretty 
ugly.

It only takes a few seconds to add a new zone, just yy a previous entry 
in vi and change the domain name. We had thousands of zones at the ISP I 
worked at and we managed to cope with this :)

That's the solution I'm working on now, but no cigar, yet.  Looks like I
need to compile mod_proxy into my apache.  But what about a RewriteRule
in the main configuration, outside of any virtual hosts?  Does that bear
any likelihood of working?

The problem with software as rich as apache is, you know you can
probably do what you want to do, but you're never sure just how to do
it!

Did you do an "apt-get update" before "dist-upgrade"? If not, then you
wouldn't have received many (if any) packages from unstable.

That may help, though according to apache.org, RewriteRule with "[P]" is
more powerful than ProxyPass.  By the way, what's the "...Reverse"
option for?

As long as apache can munge the URL first and then forward on to the
servlet container, it should work.  I guess the reason I didn't want to
use mod_proxy is that I suppose it will incur a certain overhead, if it
actually makes a new HTTP connection (which seems like what a mod_proxy
would do).  I'd rather the process were more inline.

the ProxyPassReverse just allows all connections coming back to go
back to where they were requested from.  Yes, it may be another
connection. I never cared much to figure that all out as the solution
was fast, easy and not noticable on the server load I ran it.  If you
were talking a huge load then perhaps you do need to look into
rewrite.

Back at it again after a few side trips.

I had something set up wrong.  It appears dovecot(/IMAP) wants the folders
to have a dot at the beginning (hidden) and procmail must deliver to them.
Not to the name created (sans the dot).  So I created a folder Test and 
have procmail deliver to .Test .

A bit more experimentation and I'll be switching.  Then to test pine using

Well dovecot has fit with lots of errors going to the procmail log file 
but as soon as I created the folder using Thunderbird it delivered the 
message.

Well normally I don't edit my procmail recipes very often but I think a
script that made sure the right stuff was in .subscriptions , and other
places , per the procmail recipes would be nice.  Nice project for this 
week end!  YEah right.  The honey-do pot is full but I might find the 
time.

Have a great week end all.

Is it just me, or do other people dislike having to skip past the
August 2019 and September 2006 lines on the plug Archives page.

Is there any way we could make them go away (like changing the dates to
the dates they were received)?

The response to this might be of general interest.
Yes, I did. I noted that only perhaps a third of the
newly-installed packages were from "unstable," the
rest from testing. (So it's not purely unstable. And
it doesn't say "Welcome to Sid.")

I cannot "cvs login" to a CVS server I have setup.  
The cvs repository directory and below are all set to user=cvs
group=cvsusers
The login id is a member of group cvsusers.
I am able to ssh into the system successfully from another box.
On a another box I do:
 export CVSROOT=":pserver:wamorita at frodo:/shares/cvs-repository"
When attempting a "cvs login" I get the following error:
  cvs [login aborted]: connect to frodo(192.168.1.150):2401 failed:

Do you have cvs blocked by IPChains?

Alan,

I do not believe I have IP chains turned on.  
This is an out-of-the-box RH9 system with firewall disabled.
Is it possible that there is a different password for CVS that the local uid
login?

Thanks

That's what 'make' is for. It makes these things very quick and easy.
When I add a zone, I type "make dist" and it copies a newly generated 
secondary named.conf to 5 slaves, HUP's the daemon, and the world is happy.

And sure, you don't exist to do this, but if you aren't capable of 
completing the task efficiently... well, I'll stop there.

And, no, it makes no sense to have a slave automatically pick up new zones. 
Talk to Paul Vixie with ISC, he'll be happy to flame you about this :)

Hi Bill,

The "connection refused" error doesn't sound like a password problem. 
That's an error you typically get if you try to connect to a port where 
there's not a service running. Which is probably why Alan asked about a 
firewall.

One thing to check would be whether the CVS server is even accepting 
connections. It may not be running or may not be configured properly. 
You could try connecting to it from a shell on the server itself.

Are you running it from inetd or xinetd? If so, make sure that process 
is actually running and listening on the appropriate port.

Why not let ssh handle your authentication?
export CVSROOT=":ext:wamorita at frodo:/shares/cvs-repository"

The "ext" makes ssh do the authentication.  Pretty slick.

I think Java already is "opensource" - albeit probably not with an OSI

As could I.

During the GCC 2.95 -> 3.2 conversion a while back, it seems to me a lot
of folks *were* compiling Java themselves to fix the C++ ABI
compatibility issue with Mozilla plugins.

More frustrating than scary, all OS's could ssh to the 2.6 kernel, and
both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels could hook to the ftp server, but none of
Bill's OS's could login to the ftp server (I tried several).

I changed back to a 2.4 kernel and Bill's OS's started behaving.

I didn't investigate any further, my client was willing to run the 2.4
kernel.

I have been (slowly) trying to get myself acquainted with debian.  Here
is my issue, I cannot seem to mount any cifs/smb partitions, I get the
"wrong fs or bad superblock" error.  So I read somewhere I should
upgrade to the latest 2.6 kernel.  I have successfully built a 2.6.9
kernel but cannot get the thing to boot.  Prior to this i was using
2.6.8-1.  The error I get is "VFS-cannot open root device "hdb2" or
unknown block(0,0)".  What I cant figure out is I am using the
same .config file that was created by the debian kernel package for my
2.6.8 kernel and all my options in grub are correct...

I know my way around RedHat and Gentoo pretty well, but Debian makes me
feel like I am starting all over again :-) I would really like to get
acquainted with it because it seems to be the distro all the gurus use,
so I think that says something. Any tips would be appreciated.

Thanks

Dave P

Rich,

When I do that and try CVS login I get:

cvs login: can only use `login' command with the 'pserver' method
cvs [login aborted]: CVSROOT: :ext:wamorita at frodo:/shares/cvs-repository

I was wanting to use the tkCVS GUI.  That is why I want the pserver setup.

Thanks

Why not let ssh handle your authentication?
export CVSROOT=":ext:wamorita at frodo:/shares/cvs-repository"

The "ext" makes ssh do the authentication.  Pretty slick.

Rich, Ken,

I seem to be making some progress (I think).  I was missing file:
/etc/xinetd.d/cvspserver :
service cvspserver
{
        socket_type     = stream
        wait            = no
        user            = root
        group           = cvsusers
        env             = HOME=/shares/cvs-repository 
        server          = /usr/bin/cvs
        server_args     = -f --allow-root=/shares/cvs-repository
        disable         = no
}

Now the problem has changed to:

cvs [login aborted]: unrecognized auth response from frodo: Usage: cvs
[cvs-opti
ons] command [command-options-and-arguments]

Hopefully I have not headed up a dead end!

Hi Bill,

The "connection refused" error doesn't sound like a password problem. 
That's an error you typically get if you try to connect to a port where
there's not a service running. Which is probably why Alan asked about a
firewall.

One thing to check would be whether the CVS server is even accepting
connections. It may not be running or may not be configured properly. 
You could try connecting to it from a shell on the server itself.

Are you running it from inetd or xinetd? If so, make sure that process is
actually running and listening on the appropriate port.


Rich

Well, that's progress, you are connecting now but not authenticating. 
I'm sorry but I don't know the fix to that one, it's been a while since 
I've used CVS...

Maybe google for:

cvs "unrecognized auth response"

?

Maybe I'm missing something, but I think mod_alias should do it:

        Alias directive
        
        Syntax: Alias URL-path file-path|directory-path
        Context: server config, virtual host

So, assuming that http://b.net/fubar/ is at /web/b.net/fubar/, this line
in the a.org virtualhost should do it:

Alias /foo/bar /web/b.net/fubar

It doesn't matter that /web/b.net/fubar is in the b.net virtualhost --
it's just another directory.

This isn't really a debian specific problem, but more of a kernel
configuration/build problem.  My guess is that the disk controller
driver module isn't getting loaded by the time the kernel tries to read
the fstab file.  Since you are building your own, you might as well
configure the kernel to have the driver built in.

Good Luck,

Derek Loree

Thats what I was thinking. But if I am using my same .config file as
2.6.8 kernel, why isnt it working?  They only things I have really added
is switching samba and cifs fs from modules to built in.  So it should
be loading the same things correct?

Russell,
   I was able to use dd_rescue (via dd_rhelp) and pulled an image off

No, you need to explicitly tell it you want a new kernel by version and

Installing Sun's official version of Java by downloading it from sun.com 
worked for me.  Mplayer installed cleanly from the debian-marrillat 
source if you search for mplayer on apt-get.org for me.

As far as I know, Sun's Java Runtime Environment is the *only* one that 
supports a lot of Java apps. I've had lots of trouble with the others. 
The fly in the ointment is the "religious wars" over the 
non-free-as-in-freedom nature of the JRE. Debian and some Debian-based 
distros like Agnula avoid Java apps as much as possible for this reason. 
Gentoo, on the other hand, has excellent Java support. You have to 
download the Sun software manually from the Sun site, but after that, 
you can use a lot of Java apps that are in Portage but not Debian.

Hi Bill,

The "connection refused" error doesn't sound like a password problem. 
That's an error you typically get if you try to connect to a port where
there's not a service running. Which is probably why Alan asked about a
firewall.

One thing to check would be whether the CVS server is even accepting
connections. It may not be running or may not be configured properly. 
You could try connecting to it from a shell on the server itself.

Are you running it from inetd or xinetd? If so, make sure that process is
actually running and listening on the appropriate port.


Rich

No, you are using the configuration file from a different kernel
version.  It may be a good starting point, but there will be some
differences between them -- they are different versions after all.  It
is up to you to do a sanity check on the more important settings.

Where did you get your kernel source?  Debian has kernel-source packages
that come with their own default config and have debian specific patches
applied, the settings are pretty conservative, but they work, most of
the time.

Good Luck,

I downloaded the debian sources via apt, I didn't realize they came with
their own config file.  I solved my main problem (smbfs) so at this
point I hopefully wont need to rebuild the kernel anyway.  System is
usable now for a desktop, so now I just need to spend the hours getting
familiar so maybe I can make a final transition.

Thanks for the tips.

Subject: [PLUG] UPS Test Load
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0501231158360.7116@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I want to test my Back-UPS Pro 650 to determine if I did not properly
charge the battery or if the circuits are really shot. This unit has a
maximum rated capacity of 410W. I don't have a spare computer to hook up to
it and Home Depot does not have 300W light bulbs I could use for testing.

   Other devices I have here are all heating ones that draw more than 410W.
Can you EE types suggest a test load for this UPS? If it runs for more than
an hour or so I'll know that the boards are OK and I just did not properly
charge the battery.

TIA,

Rich

How about 3  100w bulbs?

   OK. I'm trying to not need to purchase anything I don't have here. And, I
don't have an extra bathroom light bar hanging around, but I do have a
single lamp socket mounted on a board. Besides, who in the Portland area
uses incandescent lights any more? Or, will admit to not using compact
flouresents. :-)

   I do have the bulbs ... guess I can hook the UPS up to two lamps in the
den. That'll give me 240W. Hmmm-m-m. I suppose that will do, eh?

   Is there a stress-test for UPSs that can be done at home by a
non-professional?

Thanks, Keith,

Rich

   The total power consumed is the same but the load on the UPS is not. When
I tried it on my server, it shut down in about a half-hour. The server has a
425W power supply but is lightly loaded (e.g., a single ATA hard drive). I'm
trying to approximate that load to see if the UPS again shuts down.

Thanks,

Rich

Don't you have one of those $5 power strips kicking around? Then you can plug 
in up to six lamps at once.

So with loss of AC power how long do you want to stay up?

If the power is lost to my ups for 5 minutes I start shutdown sequence
starts..

Carla,

   Yup. I'll strip the house of lamps to get that many, though. :-) Well, if
I run during daylight it won't be inconvenient.

   OK. It's not elegant, but the office now looks like a lamp store showroom
with 4 lamps (310W total bulb ratings) plugged into the UPS.

   I thought there was a more sophisticated approach, but this will do.

Why Rich, this is quite sophisticated. After all, even MacGyver can't make 
light bulbs and lamps out of raw materials. We're taking high-tech here.

   I've had 310W worth of lamps plugged in now for more than 2 hours and the
UPS is still feeding them juice. So, what have I learned? Two things: 1) the
Back-UPS Pro 650 needs to be turned on to charge and 2) I now have a
Back-UPS Pro 650 with a brand-new battery for sale. $50.

Did you also remove any mention of "testing" sources from your
sources.list file? AFAIK, there's no reason to still include testing
if you're intent on using unstable.

Mr. Project is dead; CodeFactory went out of business, I think.  The
source was picked up and is now Imendio Planner:

The current Mailman version detects bogus dates by requiring them to
fall within a smallish delta of the current time.  The previous
configuration also used the header's date, rather than the received
date.  So, it shouldn't happen any more.  I'll try to fiddle with the
re-generating the archives to fix the bad dates.

Planner is pretty lame compared to Microsoft Project, which itself is 
pretty lame compared with Prima Vera. You pretty much get what you pay 
for; if you have to do *real* project management, as opposed to just 
printing Gantt charts, there really isn't a free-as-in-freedom option.

pete,

   Just goest to show how long it's been since I looked at it. It did not do
PERT or critical path analysis so I gave up on it.

   What I want is a native linux version of the ol' DOS TImeLine. That was a

   I don't think I have the old 5.25" disks any more, I no longer have a
5.25" drive and I've not been able to get dosemu working on my Slackware
systems. Oh, I no longer have the ducumentation, either.

   Otherwise, it's a great suggestion. :-)

There's a big difference between groupware, software project 
coordination and "project management". There is not an acceptable 
project management package in the free-as-in-freedom domain ... I spent 
weeks trying to find something that would do 1/10 of what Microsoft 
Project does. Maybe if enough developers join the Planner team, it will 
evolve that way. Meanwhile, if you have a non-software project to 
manage, you're stuck with Microsoft at the moment.

Having never used Microsoft Project I wouldn't know.  We are using 
egroupware for sales and marketing projects and everyone seems happy 
with it.

Subject: [PLUG] Working Web proxie quit upon reboot
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0501240702510.29356@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Yesterday I had to shut down my machines to install the new UPS. They
seemed to reboot cleanly and completely. However, I cannot get privoxy going
again and I cannot figure out why.

   I noticed that I had neglected to add rc.privoxy to rc.local, so I started
it manually this morning -- as root, of course. However, I cannot connect to
any Web page (internal or external) when the proxy is enabled (same
localhost address and port as before). When the proxy is disabled everything
works.

   I've looked at the docs and see nothing that might have changed just by
shutting down the system. '/etc/rc.d/rc.privoxy status' shows nothing at
all. No privoxy process shows up in the process list.

   If someone can suggest diagnostics -- or a cure -- I'd greatly appreciate
the clue.

Thanks,

Rich

   Thank you, Ed. I used TimeLine to manage major hydroelectric dam
re-licensing projects with a cast of dozens, a large budget and several
hundred tasks. The ability to re-assign/re-level resources automatically
when things slipped, to recalculate the critial path and to produce weekly
expense reports comparing budgeted and spent amounts was vital. It just
ain't like a software project or a group of folks putting out a common memo.

   There is a knowledgeable local resource, but the reality is that those who
could produce a native linux version of TimeLine need to make a living, too.
Unless we can come up with a sponsor (and I have no ideas on who or why),
I'm afraid it just will not happen. Doing professional project management
software is a very far from trivial exercise. It probably equals in
complexity computational geometry for spatial analyses.

Kurt,

   No one's listening on 8118, the port recommended by privoxy. Here's what I
see when the manual proxies are enabled in firefox-1.0 and I try to load a
page -- see the attachment as a screen capture.

Subject: [PLUG] Maybe y'all can help with this.
Message-ID: <41F53994.6030402@linuxlink.com>

I took over this email server late in 2003.  According to the nasd a 
copy of all broker emails must be kept. At first we were using mbox and 
now we use Maildir.  One user has a copy of all email including "[SPAM]" 
mails.
We have discussed it and want to remove all the mail marked as [SPAM] 
and send it to the bit bucket before archiving it.  I found some perl 
scripts and other scripts which are supposed to do what I want but they 
all either segfault or don't do anything.
Then I thought I could maybe run them through SA with a procmail entry 
to send them off to never never land.  Could someone explain how to do 
this with both types of inboxes.  I think I know how with Maildir but am 
not so sure with the old mbox files.  If I don't need to fool with 
procmail so much the better.

This will probably remove 10 gigs of mail from what I need to archive.

Thanks ahead.


Some of you may have seen this on the spamassassin list but no one 
wanted to allow me to do it.  The powers that be here have decided to do 
it even knowing all the possible repucussions.

Thanks ahead.

As root:

netstat -tanp

That will show you who's listening on each port. Look only at the ports
you care about by piping the netstat output to 'grep 80' or whatever
your port of choice might be.

Yeah, mod_alias only works for exposing files directly, like symlinks. 
But I have dynamic content being generated by different Java Web-app's

This is an uncommon problem, I'm sure; but I think I'll be able to solve

Michael,

   I run pine as my MUA so it's the mbox type. When I run SA on the
spam-uncaught file I use the --mbox option. Since you know how to specify
Maildir, this should get you going.

HTH,

Rich

Right, with :ext:, you log in once for every command, instead of using
"login".  Your local username is passed to the server by default, so
you'll just get a password prompt.  More tedious, but more secure.

Does anything privoxy related appear in your logs when you try and start
it?

Look at the rc.privoxy script, under the start() section, for the exact
command used to start the proxy.  Run that manually and look for any
kind of error output.  You may have a stale lockfile or something
similar laying around that's causing grief.

If you're already writing dynamic content, you might as well code the
redirection stuff yourself.  It's not particularly difficult and leaves
you far more flexibility than mod_rewrite or mod_proxy can offer.

Your java web-apps (or something else you write) can send HTTP responses
back themselves.  All mod_rewrite does is send a 302 back to the client.

http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html ...has a list of
everything you could need, I think.

   Apologies, Rob. I looked there (/var/log/messages) but neglected to
mention it. Nothing there.

   I've been running it manually and I don't see any of the messages (i.e.,
"Starting ", "Retrying ..." or "Already running". Here's that section of the
script:

start () {
         # start daemon
         echo -n $"Starting $PRIVOXY_PRG: "

         if [ ! -f $PRIVOXY_PID ]; then
                 ($PRIVOXY --user $PRIVOXY_USER.$PRIVOXY_GROUP  --pidfile
$PRIVO
XY_PID 2>/dev/tty9 ) \
                         && echo " OK" \
                         && /bin/touch /var/lock/$PRIVOXY_PRG \
                         && RETVAL=0
         elif [ $check -lt 3 ]; then
                 echo "Zombie lock file found"
                 /bin/rm -f /var/lock/$PRIVOXY_PRG $PRIVOXY_PID
                 echo "Retrying..."
                 start
         else
                 echo "Already running"
         fi
         echo
}

and here's what I see when I try running it:

[root at salmo /etc/rc.d]# ./rc.privoxy start
[root at salmo /etc/rc.d]#

   Nobody's home.

Thanks,

Rich

   Oops! ... but no.

   There is /var/log/privoxy/logfile, but that ends yesterday when I shut
down the system:

Jan 23 16:31:26 Privoxy(16384) Info: exiting by signal 15 .. bye

   and off it went, not to be seen again. :-(

   Nah. Not even a login prompt. I didn't understand why errors are directed
to tty9; still don't. Must be a SysAdmin secret.

   On host 'tux' (I was not inventive that day) I export /usr2, /usr3, and
/usr4; all are owned by root.users and have permissions 777.

   On host 'salmo' I try to mount them based on the entries in /etc/fstab:

tux:/usr4        /mnt/usr4        nfs     rw,rsize=8192,wsize=8192 0 0

   When I -- as root -- try to mount them I'm getting a permissions error:

[root at salmo ~]# mount /mnt/usr2
mount: tux:/usr2 failed, reason given by server: Permission denied

   I'm not seeing what permission is incorrect. A better pair of eyes would

If /etc/exports on tux is in good shape, you'll want to make sure

1. that the portmapper is running on both tux and salmo

2. that the /etc/hosts.{allow,deny} files on tux don't restrict
    traffic (since portmap is compiled against libwrap)

3. that salmo has the IP address tux thinks it should have

What does tux's /etc/exports contain, and did you remember to run exportfs?

If you just want something to make creating cron jobs easier I like 
Webmin.  Webmin will let you administer your entire server via a web 
browser so it might be a bit over kill, but you can limit what options 
are available to administer.

   /etc/hosts, /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny are the same on both
hosts.

   As far as I can tell from the hosts files, it does.

   This is why I'm puzzled. Tux is set up like caddis used to be and that
worked.

galen,

   The answer to your first question is in the reply I posted to Paul's
message. The answer to your second question is "no". I don't recall having
run that before so I didn't. But, I just did with no difference in results.

Thanks,

Galen,

   To elaborate, I just reran /usr/sbin/exportfs -a on tux; saw messages
about not explicitly stating 'sync' or 'async' so the former was used as a
default. But, on salmo still no mount permitted.

Thanks,

Rich

Pretty straight-forward; just add to /etc/syslog.conf:

*.debug<TAB>/dev/tty9

(<TAB> must be a literal tab, not a space!)

Then HUP syslogd and you'll have a quick way to always get to log
messages.

  I real batch schedule tool is much more complex that cron.  Batch jobs
usually exist as queues or streams if individual.  Each job execution may be
dependant on one or more previous job ending successfully and creating the
correct output files.  A good job scheduler will monitor each job in turn.
It waits for the correct input files, make sure the job runs on time,
doesn't run too long, and creates the correct output files.  All with proper
logging and notification to the system operators.  It should alert the
operators when a batch stream gets stuck because a job failed or is waiting
for resources.  

  We've talked about writing something using Shell, Perl, and cron.  It
would be a lot easier to start with a batch scheduling tool and configure it
to our needs.  There are a couple of packages on SourceForge that might
work.  I was just wondering if somebody had a tool they were happy with.

OK. It may be time for some surgery. I hate doing this, but on more 
than one occasion this is the only trick that worked.

   cd /var/lib
   tar cWvf /tmp/nfs-backup.tar ./nfs
   cd nfs
   grep -l salmo *

Now, carefully open all files returned by grep in a text editor that 
does NOT automatically wrap lines; vi will do the trick, as will "nano 
-w" or "pico -w". Excise all references to salmo and save the files in 
place.

   exportfs -rv

Then give it another spin. If things work, you can delete 
/tmp/nfs-backup.tar. If things go horribly awry, restore /var/lib/nfs 
from /tmp/nfs-backup.tar and try again.

Paul,

   I assume this is to be on 'tux' who's trying to export the files. Is this
correct?

   No mention of salmo.

   The files in /var/lib/nfs are etab (which lists the expanded -- with
defaults -- /etc/exports), rmtab, state and xtab. Two subdirectories are sm/
and sm.bak/.

Is this the first time you've rebooted the box since installing the 
software? It's not unusual to find problems when you reboot the first 
time after making a change, in that case it's usually the program's init 
script. That begs the question of how it got started up in the first 
place, but we won't know the answer to that.

Try running the start command that's in the script, manually. Don't run 
the script, run the command itself, type it out in your shell. You will 
need to subsitute the contents of those variables yourself when you do 
it, they should be defined in the script. In other words, instead of 
typing $PRIVOXY in the start command, type what is assigned to that 
variable earlier in the script.

Runnning the command by hand at the command line will be the best way to 
get feedback about what's happening.

Rich,

   Yeah, that's the case, and I want to learn why not.

   I looked in /var/lock, but there's no privoxy lock file there.

   Yes. I normally don't reboot between distribution upgrades or after fixing
hardware failures.

   I followed the privoxy instructions, then manually ran
/etc/rc.d/rc.privoxy. It fired up and chugged away at a low idle with no
smoke or dripping oil.

A few days ago I noticed Yahoo instant messenger started behaving 
strange. I attempted to fix that by removing  and re-installing it, 
which didn't resolve my problem. Today, I ran chkrootkit, and this 
disturbing line was in the output:

Checking `bindshell'... INFECTED (PORTS:  600)

I decided to run chkrootkit because of some interesting things from  
"netstat -tanp |more", which had been mentioned in another post. I wish 
that I had scripted to a file, so that I could post that output now. I 
have since killed a couple of suspicious processes, so the output 
doesn't have anything all that interesting anymore.  So, what should I 
do next, to ensure I closed this up and cleaned house?

Ok. Try running the command by hand. You can leave off the part 
redirecting stderr to tty9, that way you'll see stdout and stderr both 
right there in your window. It it's too much into to fit on one screen 
then send it to a file.

One other question is whether the service was configured properly to 
start and stop in the needed runlevels. I'm not sure what distro you're 
using, but usually there's a GUI tool for managing services in the 
different runlevels. If the box is using xdm/gdm/kdm then you're looking 
for runlevel 5. You can see the default runlevel in /etc/inittab.

If the service is not configured to stop automatically, then it would 
not have been shut down properly. You say you're not seeing a lockfile, 
so something else may have been messed up. If that's the case you may 
get better support from whatever mailing lists or forums exist for the 
privoxy software, since those are pretty specific questions.

Mel, how much do you want to learn about your system?
Start by searching the PLUG archives, there is at least one thread covering
how to recover.  Note, I'm the in minority of people who believe that an
infected system can be cleaned and restored to safe behavior.  

Also, check google for chkrootkit and bindshell - there are enough instances
of false positives that this combination receives a special entry in the FAQ.

Rich, et al.:

   I tracked down the problem, and it is subtle. I'll document it here for
archive archeologists when they come up with the same situation.

SUMMARY: The initial configuration was done from the privoxy Web site, and
that's where it was configured and started. That process never made a local
copy of the config file. Privoxy will not start without a config file.

   Spelunking through /opt/privoxy/doc/text/user-manual.txt I learned that
the executable (/usr/local/sbin/privoxy) wants to find the config file in
/etc/privoxy/. That directory was not created during the installation and
tweaking process. Neither was the file in it.

   So, I created /etc/privoxy/ and created config. The user-manual.txt has
the requirements; confdir and logdir are mandatory, all else is optional.
Here's my config:

confdir		/etc/privoxy
logdir		/var/log/privoxy
actionsfile	standard
actionsfile	default
actionsfile	user
filterfile	default.filter
logfile		logfile
jarfile		jarfile
trustfile 
debug		8192
listen-address	127.0.0.1:8118
toggle		1

   Now, the application also wants to look at the action files. They're in
the directory where it was installed (/usr/local/etc/privoxy). So I made
softlinks from /etc/privoxy to /usr/local/etc/privoxy -- including the
template/ directory.

   Then I ran '/usr/local/sbin/privoxy /etc/privoxy/config' and it worked.
Oh, you need to turn on the proxy in your browser before firing it up.

   I don't know if I need to export the $PRIVOX_xxx environment variables for
the Slackware rc.privoxy script. Guess I'll find out when I next need to
reboot this box.

Excelsior! (Not the packing version.)

Hi Mel,

You can get a sense of what's been replaced if you have Tripwire or a 
similar program installed. If you are using RPM, a quick and dirty check 
is rpm -Va, but that is not infallible. If someone insttalled an RPM 
with trojans in it, it would check out ok.

I did a quick Google and I'm not 100% sure that message means you've 
been hacked. I saw one post that identified that as a false positive, 
saying it was actually rpc.statd:

http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2004/03/msg17020.html

Here's an article with some good suggestions on intrustion detection, it 
contains some info on using the RPM vrify:

http://www.linuxexposed.com/internal.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=571&mode=&order=0

If you do find you've been hacked, though, there's no reliable way to 
clean house on a compromised box. Once the tools you're using can't be 
trusted, then it's all downhill. You'll need to reinstall the OS from 
scratch and then apply all security patches for your release.

Those two statements don't logically tie together.  One can reinstall the 
tools - boot from a resuce CD so you are assured that RPM is OK. Once RPM
(or apt tools) are known good you can verify and reinstall any other system
binaries.

I think that's possible if you have a method like Tripwire to check the 
integity of the system files, and you know what you're doing. But then 
you have to check for a lot of other things as well. Other backdoors, 
accounts with no passwords or UID 0, SUID copies of bash laying about, 
malicous cron jobs, init scripts and CGI scripts, and more. It's really 
hard to know that you've covered every possible scenario that could 
allow the attacker root access again.

For some people (especially people without a lot of practical security 
experience) wiping and installing from scratch will actually be easier 
than dealing with all of that. But, then again, if you don't investigate 
things you don't learn.

This may have been a false positive, and I'd certainly investigate that 
first before doing anything drastic.

Perhaps not technically, but if the box actually *has* been rooted, it's
at least required practically.

Sure it can.  After you verify virtually everything on the system is
infection free.  You need to verify *every* script, *every*
configuration file, *every* binary.  

Imagine you're a black-hat cracker interested in keeping a rooted box.
How many different ways would you go about protecting yourself?  I'd
trojan every ~/.bashrc, every crontab, every binary I could think of,
every script sourced at boot or log on.  I'd trojan lilo, you know it
can execute something upon startup?  I'd trojan inittab.  I'd trojan
everybody's .forward.  I'd trojan the aliases DB.  I'd figure out how to
add a DSO to Apache that would allow me access.

Hey, a lot of these things may only grant me user access... but if
you've been rooted once, how difficult do you think it's going to be for
an attacker to gain root privs from a mere mortal user?  Not very.

Sure you could check all these things and *not* wipe the box clean and
start over - but why would you want to?

Indeed, of course you verify you *are* rooted before doing anything to
fix the problem.  You want to be 100% sure, I think....

You can verify RPMs against known good packages if you have them all, 
yes. But doing the straight RPM verify from the RPM database is not 
enough to assure you things are ok.

Say I hack your box and get root. At that point I can install whatever 
RPMs I want. It's not hard to make an RPM that appears to be the real 
thing once it's installed, you can spoof all that info that shows up in 
rpm -qi for example, like the build host.

Now, when you as a sysadmin do RPM -va, the RPM I installed will show up 
as having the correct MD5 sums. That's because the sums that are checked 
are the ones from the package last installed, the trojaned one I 
installed, not the original package. The sums will be the same as the 
ones generated when I built the package, and RPM will not report a problem.

Of course I can't fake the signature, but rpm -Va doesn't check that.

If you're talking about reinstalling all the software, then that's 
pretty much what I was suggesting in the first place. I'm not saying you 
neccessarily need to wipe the disk clean, but you are probably looking 
at reinstalling the OS.

Now again, I'm not disagreeing with you that it's possible for someone 
who knows what they are doing to do a reasonably decent job of cleaning 
up after a box that's been hacked. But I think for the average person, 
reinstalling may be easier.

If it was a box that had valuable data on it, then I would want to back 
up the data, wipe it, and reinstall. Or replace it with a new box and 
migrate the data.

I don't see a particularly elegant solution there, frankly.  I guess I'd
either have to alter my servlet base class (for "a.org") to step in as
needed and forward somehow (can I even RequestDispatcher.forward() to a
different Web app'?), or I'd need to write a servlet filter.  Neither of
these is as clean as using mod_rewrite (once I get it right), and both
would taint my application proper.  (I certainly don't want to combine
these Web app's into one, for that would be senseless.  One of them is
blojsom, which is distributed as its own Web app'.)

I believe that depends on the value in brackets (e.g., "[PT]" for "pass
through") after each RewriteRule.  I'm using "[P]" for this, which uses
mod_proxy, so I don't think the 302 response applies there.  Indeed, I
want to avoid a second client connection altogether.

Do you have the lsof utility? If so, what does "lsof -i :600" tell you?
If it shows a process id (pid) for whatever is bound to port 600, then
you can do a "ps -fp (PID)" - replace (PID) with the actual process id
you're looking for.

Granted, if you really are compromised, then certainly ps will have been
trojaned, and possibly also lsof. However, this method might turn up
something that would suggest you just have a false positive from
chkrootkit.

Hm.  Well procmail comes with a program called formail that can
process mboxes and maildirs, piping one email at a time to a program
using the -e command.  It's a great way to convert mboxes to maildir
and vice-versa.  I think it also can select emails based on header
info, so you could e.g. use it to archive messages and tell it to
ignore messages with "Subject: [SPAM].*" in the header when archiving.

Checkiddout.  I've found formail to be an amazingly useful tool.

Subject: [PLUG] Dovecot and Thunderbird revisited
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0501241717220.21340-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

Well I'm happy to say that between all the excellant suggestions I got 
from this list and some serious re-reading I have postfix, procmail and  
dovecot ( mostly ) playing nicely together.  Mail goes in and gets filed 
in the correct folders.
   I've done one pass at loading my mbox formatted mail into the new 
account and it works as slick as can be.  For those that might be 
interested two directories are needed/used by Dovecot.  The actual named 
"folder" and a hidden version ".folder".  To make them show up 
automagically the actual name has to be in the file ".subscriptions".
   Down-ish side is they all show up as new messages but a quick Ctrl-A, 
right click, mark all as read and that was fixed.  I haven't gone hot with 
the server yet , just testing how things work.

I have one last question that I need enlightenment on.  How do I get ssl 
connections working?

I created the SSL certificates ( self signed I think they are called ) and
got them in the ( hopefully ) correct place.  Once or twice I could get
logged in by telling TB to use a ssl connection but got warnings about
certificate and host name missmatch.  I recreated the certificates with 
"better" information ( hostname, etc. ) and now get server timeouts.  So I 
whimped out and went with plain old IMAP for now.
   This mail server is running in a Linux-Vserver so I'm not sure if the 
main server's iptables is causing a problem or it is inside the vserver 
that is acting up.

I found a couple of HOWTOs for doing this but they tended to wander away
from what I wanted/needed -- too simple or too complex.  Anyone have a
pointer to a good HOWTO on Dovecot ( or IMAP in general ) SSL connections?


TIA,
Rod

I had a similar experience with 2.6.9.  An C++ network application
that I wrote was
working on 2.4.20+ and 2.6.8 but not on 2.6.9.  Same code, same compiler.
The customer decided it was not worth the trouble to figure out why it didn't
work and went back to a 2.4.26 kernel.

I noticed yahoo messenger starting malfunctioning a few days ago as
well, however, I know I'm not hacked.  I'm assuming yahoo changed
something in their protocol or something of that nature that broke
things for us Linux users.  :-(

Okay, I believe the bindshell probably is a false positive. One of the 
processes I killed off was fam, as I could think of no reason 
(application) for it to be running. And there was the peculiar change in 
the Yahoo messenger display, which is yet to be resolved. I've checked 
that I can still perform my job duties without firing up their WinXP 
laptop, so I think I am okay for the short term.  I know enough to be a 
little more than dangerous, but not enough to ease my mind about 
manually checking everything.

So, I think I'll want to reload the OS. I sliced up hda into thirds, 
(WinXP, Suse, future use) and have been planning to take a stab at 
installing debian on the remaining portion. That way I could mount my 
current linux filesystem, and copy over my email, and other personal 
stuff. Once comfortable with debian, and confident I won't need the suse 
filesystem, I'll blow it away and save it for the next upgrade/project. 
I also have been wanting to get the laptop wireless, but that means 
buying a wireless router too, or what's the point when I work from home? 
So, I'll probably get the Linksys WRT54G. I should gain a layer of 
security, and my linux box won't have to do IP forwarding anymore. I'll 
probably opt for a PCMCIA wireless card for the laptop, because I expect 
there will be more linux support for that.  And, that will be the next 
thing, setting up the employer's WinXP laptop to dual boot to linux.

I agree with Rob.  However, before going to all the trouble, verify
that you've really been hacked.  Disconnect the network and boot from
known good media (e.g. the Knoppix Security Tools Distribution
downloaded and burned from another computer. 
http://www.knoppix-std.org/) Run chkrootkit from the CD.  Nothing on
your original PC hard drive can be trusted.

The warning from chkrootkit by itself doesn't necessarily mean you've
been hacked.  The "suspicious" processes are of more concern.  The
info from the SANS Intrusion Detection "cheat sheet" might be helpful:

http://www.sans.org/score/checklists/ID_Linux.pdf

(This is also a good quick read for the PLUG list in general.)

Others also agree with Rob's quick summary:

http://www-jerry.oit.duke.edu/linux/HOWTO/what_to_do_if_hacked.html

Here is a nice series on incident response from techrepublic.com
offering in-depth advice that boils down to what Rob said:

http://techrepublic.com.com/5100-6264_11-5034937.html
http://techrepublic.com.com/5100-6264_11-5034945.html
http://techrepublic.com.com/5100-6264_11-5034940.html

The advice listed elsewhere on this list about booting from known good
media, downloading trusted RPM signatures, and checking every binary
on your system is good-intentioned but ultimately impractical.  There
is simply no way to ensure that every binary is good in less time that
it would take to re-install.

Your data files are probably fine-- e.g. images, MP3s, text files,
OpenOffice docs.  There's no harm saving them off someplace for a
later restore (e.g. CD-R).  Make two copies, since it really, really
sucks to find out that your entire digtal photo collection just
happened to be on that one CD-R that was bad.  There is a small but
nonzero chance that these could be used to re-compromise your system. 
However, this risk is so small and the effort to safely re-create the
data so large that these are either restored from backup or assumed to
be safe.

The SANS Institute (http://www.sans.org) method of incident response is simple:
1) Prepare (too late)
2) Identify (you just did)
3) Contain (the "unplug")
4) Eradicate (the "wipe and reinstall" plus eliminate the likely
causes of the intrusion)
5) Recover (hooking the network back up, copying in data files)
6) Lessons Learned

The most likely cause for the intrusion is an under-patched system. 
Retire those ancient Red Hat systems that aren't updated any more and
install something that is-- like CentOS or White Box Linux (both Red
Hat Enterprise clones.)

So you have some special directive making all request go straight to the
Java app, like this? (on a.org)

ScriptAlias / /path/to/cgi/script-a-org.cgi

Then put this on a.org:

ScriptAlias /a-org-mirror /path/to/cgi/script-a-org.cgi

Pick some pathname that you won't mind committing to this purpose. Users
won't see it (but could if they typed it in).

Then this rule would make /a-org-mirror/foo/bar appear at /fubar:

RewriteRule ^/fubar(.*) /a-org-mirror/foo/bar$1

You may need to adjust that to deal with trailing slashes or paths that
start with fubar.

I hope this helps,

Evan

   It occurred to me this evening that my nfs problem might be a remnant from
several years ago. Wasn't there a problem with Red Hat using the kernel-land
nfs a while back? I know that I fixed that by using a user-land nfs instead.

   In Slackware-10 I have nfsd and I think I read that it's run by the
kernel. Could this still be an issue?

You know you've really been hacked when:

2)  Your online music collection is now Nigerian tribal music.

3)  You stop getting spam (it wastes bandwidth, you know).

4)  Kevin Mitnick sends you a birthday card.

5)  Your man pages are now in Russian and Korean.

6)  Inexplicable free hardware upgrades are delivered daily.

7)  You start getting 147 credit card bills.

8)  Which is all right, you now have the money from 147 mortgages to pay
    the bills with.

9)  Tripwire reports your system is clean - but you didn't RUN tripwire!

... and the main way you know you've really been hacked is:

Subject: [PLUG] Best motherboard with Linux
Message-ID: <41F5DD88.4090406@comcast.net>

Hello PLUG:

We're using Linux right now on a Dell machine, and it works fine, but we 
want to get a new AMD 64 computer. We visited Fry's and bought the combo 
Athlon 64 3000+ and Lanparty motherboard, among other things, and we 
asked the people at Fry's whether it would work. They said that they 
didn't know, but they knew Gigabyte motherboards worked and suggested we 
do some research and return it if it wouldn't work. We found no trace of 
a driver for the motherboard's onboard LAN (as the name suggests) and 
sound and also couldn't find anything for the video card we'd purchased.

We returned the motherboard, CPU, and video, (the CPU and motherboard 
had to be returned as a combo) and sought help for a motherboard that 
was known to work with Linux. The person we spoke to said it should work 
(it was based on the nVidia 3 chipset or something like that, and he 
used nVidia 2 and Linux worked fine for him). We were skeptical and 
decided to ask you what the best motherboard (and video card, although 
we could always use VESA) for Linux would be that works with AMD 64.

We look forward to your response.

Thanks,
Todd Bauman

Rich, why are you using Slackware 10?  :)

I'm not one to get into distro wars, but I've heard you describe 
yourself in the past as kind of a reluctant sysadmin, someone who does 
it not because they want to but because it enables them to do their job. 
So if that is case (and I don't mean to put words in your mouth, if I'm 
wrong about that let me know), why would you pick the one distro that is 
probably the least user friendly of all of them?

I think you could get a list of all the other distros, close your eyes 
and point at one, and find something that way which is easier to use.

I started using RedHat when version 2.1 came out. I had been using 
Slackware before then, but I found that RPM is pretty cool and I have 
never looked back. Since then I've used many other distros, and there 
are some others I like a lot (Gentoo, Mandrake), but I can't imagine 
going back to Slackware. And I am someone who likes being a sysadmin, I 
chose it as a profession :)

In terms of your NFS question, someone here may know, but you might have 
better luck on the Slackware list. If there are big NFS problems with 
it, that will be a known issue.


Rich

I understand the distinction between hacker and cracker, but when 
someone says their box has been hacked they mean it's been compromised. 
There's really not another usage for the term in that context. They're 
not saying someone installed a Perl script for them that made their life 
a lot easier :)

I disagree with your assumption....

Slackware is *simple*.  There's nothing hiding you from the guts of the
thing.  It's just the admin and his box without any complicated tools
getting in the way.  It's about doing things the UNIX way - doing one
thing and doing it well.

For me, this makes it *very* user friendly.  It also makes me more Linux
friendly.  IMHO, there's nothing wrong with Slackware at all....

Subject: [PLUG] How do I debug Linux crash
Message-ID: <BAY20-F32ED3E056EE014AF82275DB8860@phx.gbl>


Hi:

My Linux box crashed twice last week and I could not figure
out what had happened.  Any tips/pointers much aprpeciated.
Here is what happened:

The box is running kernel 2.6.6.  I got it through Fedora 2.
It has been running fine for at least a year and a half.  The box
is a P4 2.4 Ghz 800 Mhz FSB.  One GB of memory.  Recently,
we have setup and run Oracle 9i on it.   There are about 2 Oracle
users and they do run pretty heavy database reports out of the Oracle 
instance
installed on this box.  Last Thursday, it was business as usual and there
were some sort of Oracle work going on.  I had to burn a CD and
burning at a lower speed would take up less resources.  So I was burning
my CD at speed 8 using cdrecord.  All of a sudden, my screen turns blank, 
the
CD ejected itself but the CD burning job wasn't finish.  I cannot ssh or 
telnet into the
box and console screen is blank.  I had to press the reset button.  When it 
finished
booting, I looked into /var/log but could not find anything indicating 
problems in
any of the log file.  Then I looked at /etc/syslog.conf and found
that kernel.* wasn't being logged to anywhere.  So I added kernel.* into 
/var/log/messages.
Then I restarted Oracle and informed the 2 users to resume their work.     I 
then began
to burn the same CD that did not go through.  This time, I lowered the speed
to 4.  Again the same crash behavior appeared about 10 minutes later.  After
the box was rebooted, I once again look into /var/log for any clue.  And 
again,
nothing relevant was found.   There aren't anything major
running other than Oracle and my cdrecord process.  I have used cdrecord
on this system before and it worked fine.  Oracle has been running
for two months already and the box never crashed until last Thursday.


My questions:
Is there somewhere other than /var/log I should go and look for clues
as to what happened?  Is logging kernel.* inside /etc/syslog.conf enough
to debug this type of situation?

Luckily, the box is running just fine ever since.  I was able to burn the CD 
that I needed.
Nonetheless, I still want to know how I can debug so I know what to do
next time.

Thanks in advance for any tips...

I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it. For me, I'm fairly 
atheistic when it comes to distros. I think they all have their 
strengths and weaknesses, and I like to choose the tool that's best for 
the job. For some jobs it's not even Linux - I like FreeBSD for web 
serving, and if I had to choose a *nix for an important firewall it 
would probably be OpenBSD.

I would rather use Slackware than Windoze any day, but I would not 
describe Slackware as "user friendly."

My point is that Rich is someone who has described himself as a 
reluctant syadmin (IIRC). For someone like that, I'm not sure a system 
with all the guts exposed is really the best fit. You mention 
complicated tools getting in the way - I think the majority of the tools 
than other distros add on make things easier, not harder. There is a 
reason people have added those tools. Things like package managemnt are 
good things, IMHO.

I am confortable editing text config files directly, and in many cases I 
prefer it. But again, I'm not a reluctant sysadmin, I'm anything but that.

My Sarge installation originally had a 2.4.27 kernel,
but I installed the 2.6.9 kernel-image package. I had
no trouble playing multimedia DVD's using the original
kernel (never), but with the new one I can play only
some. (Otherwise the DVD just doesn't launch.) I can't
think of any obvious explanation for this: has anyone
else had a similar experience?

Have you tried running the binary defined by $PRIVOXY_PRG directly?
Perhaps the variable is not configured properly in your rc script. I
only noticed a post about trying to run the rc script manually, maybe
I'm being redundant.

That doesn't make the usage any more correct, though.

Rich,

   Because Patrick hasn't been well enough to get 10.1 out yet. The short
answer is stability and reliability.

   I've had more grief with dependencies and bleeding-edge packages in Red
Hat (from 4.0-7.3) than I've had with Slackware (8.0-10.0, so far). Other
than security patches and the occasional productivity application (e.g.,
OO.o, R-statistical system, ncftp), I don't do any maintenance from one
release to the next. Like the energizer bunny it just keeps going ... and
going ... and going. No muss, no fuss, no bother.

   All depends on one's point of view. I have found Slackware (once I got
used to the BSD-style init system) much easier than Red Hat. If you look at
the PLUG list archives from 1998 or 1999 you'll see a long thread initiated
by me about nfs and how a networked host would suddenly go AWOL from the
network. I don't recall if this was when RH went from 5.x to 6.0 or 6.x to
7.0; it was during the shift of nfsd to knfsd.

   The workstation that's giving me problems is quite new and while I've had
the two hosts networked without any problems, I've decided to move all
spatial and other data to the faster box with the speedier processor. That's
why I want to mount the three user filesystems via nfs.

   With regard to distributions, I see more gnashed teeth on the mail list
with fedora, debian, gentoo, and mandrake than I do with slackware. And, I'm
not the only one here running that distribution. Then again, my vehicles
have manual transmissions (and window winders), not automatic, and I prefer
to do things myself rather than having them delivered all prepared. So I
suppose that slackware fits this mindset better than do other distributions.

   Three suggestions for you:

   1.) Either ENU, Inc or Pacific Solutions will give you local advice on
what runs well with linux.

   2.) Look at the ads in Linux Journal (and the articles, too) to learn what
combinations work. Also, check out the linux-oriented suppliers such as
Monarch Computers (http://www.monarchcomputers.com) to see what they package
together.

   3.) Rummage around the Linux Hardware Compatibility Web site.

Pacific Solutions at SE 50th and Powell.  If they don't have it in 
stock, and they can't backorder it, it probably doesn't exist.

Huh.  I heard that nForce3 chipset's gigabit lan support was merged
into forcedeth a while ago.  But I know it can be a hassle to get
newer hardware working initially.

I haven't heard of a mobo that doesn't work with recent Linux x86 or
ath64 distros.  Yeah, the sound or LAN might not work 'til you run an
update and install a fresh kernel, but you can get by on a $5 PCI lan
card 'til then.

I just got some ath64 Ubuntu Linux CDs from shipit.ubuntu.org.  I'd
recommend trying it out.  Heck--I can hand one to you at a meeting.

When did Gary pass away?

That's really sad news. He and I worked together at the Byte Shop back
in 1980 and I ran into him every few years or, more recently, when I
needed an odd cable. He was a genuinely odd person (but then so were
Marx, Willing, Crunchy, & Jim Bell), but I liked him despite, or perhaps
because of, that. Jim Willing now owns a bowling alley in Kansas, Jim
Bell has passed through this life like a giant roman candle, and I have
heard of/from Crunchy (aka Jim Christionson (sp?)) or Bill Marx in
probably 20 years.

Any more details about Gary? Any news of the rest of them would be
appreciated, too.

-Ron

   Interesting, Galen. Same error message. So, since I cannot mount tux:/usr2
on tux's /mnt, the permissions must be on /usr2, eh?

   Something is really screwy here. On tux:

   - /usr1 is on /dev/hda, /usr2-4 are all of /dev/hdb

   - I changed /etc/exports from 192.168.55/24(rw) to
salmo.appl-ecosys.com(rw), then ran /usr/sbin/exportfs -a. The results still
showed the numeric IP address.

   - Added /usr1 to /etc/exports (on a different hard drive), ran exportfs
with both the -a, then the -r (refresh) options. /usr1 did not show up in
the list.

   - Both before and after adding /usr1 /var/lib/nfs/xtab shows only /usr2-4
with the numeric IP address and not the domain_name address.

   - In /etc/fstab all hard drive partitions are mounted with default values
(rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, async).

   Sigh. Another new wedgie I've not before encountered. What might possibly
be going on here?

Thanks,

Rich

Well, it sounds like you're getting hard-freezes, which are hard to
diagnose since the system doesn't get a chance to log anything.  No
way to get around that.

Really, it should be safe to burn at any speed (yeah, 48x might impact
your users some) but if there's something hinky about the CD drive or
the controller, you'll get hard-freezes.

You might want to move the CD drive to another box to protect your
users from more crashes, then test at your leisure.  You might also
try a newer (2.6.9 or .10) kernel.

Also, CD burners are really cheap these days.  Weigh the value of your
time vs. the cost of a new burner.  Heck, might be time to upgrade to
DVD.

Good luck,
  Aaron

Besides the fact you can't get NFS working? :)

That can be explained by statistics alone. Those other distros must have 
many times the installed base that Slackware has.

And I'm guessing the average user of Slackware at this point is going to 
be a more experienced Linux person, and less in need of asking lots of 
questions and gnashing teeth. Most newer users are going to start up 
with Fedora or Mandrake, or maybe even Gentoo or one of the Debian-based 
distros.

Well, again, I was going off of previous comments you had made here. If 
I remember correctly you had characterized yourself as a reluctant 
admin, someone who was learning to use Linux because it helped them to 
do their other work. But it sounded like your preference would be to 
spend the time on the other work, not futzing around with Linux.

That doesn't sound like the description above, so perhaps I am 
misremembering it, or perhaps your mindset has changed.

In any case, it seems that you have been running into a lot of problems 
lately, so I'm not sure that the description of everything being smooth 
sailing with Slackware is accurate. This NFS problem, for example - I'm 
not sure if it's something with the distro, or something else (like a 
configuration issue). If it is shipping with a non-working NFS that 
would be bad, but it's hard to believe that.

Anyway, it's certainly up to you what distro you use. Just trying to add 
a helpful $0.02, but I'll zip it now :)

Well, if you write the dictionary, you can make "correct" anything you 
want it to be :) But that's the usage. If the vast majority of people 
use it that way, then perhaps the people hanging on to their own 
dictionary definition are the ones not being correct, or realistic.

I did consider that possibility but I have 1GB of RAM and 2GB of swap.  Not 
so
sure what is the conventional amount but I do consider those to be
quite an ample amount.  At the time of both crash, the only
2 major events going on was cdrecord and Oracle.  I can understand
Oracle can demand a lot of memory and swap but cdrecord
should not be (I think).  And Oracle was running for 2 months just fine.
And it has been since last Thursday when I stopped burning CD.

So I am not so sure.

You might be surprised.  Your comment brings up an interesting issue...
figuring out how popular Linux, or a particular linux distribution, is.
It's not easy, and really not even possible, IMHO.  Due to the free
availability of most distributions, the complex mirroring systems, cheap
CDs available, you can't count downloads or sales.

Slackware is, I think, far more popular than most people give it credit
for.  It may not be up there with Mandrake or Debian, but on a ranking
scale, I think it isn't very far behind.

You would be surprised at the number of folks who start off with
Slackware.  I, personally, used RedHat and Mandrake before finding
Slackware... but I didn't really *use* Linux until Slackware.

If you want to learn Linux, Slackware is the best beginner distribution
except perhaps LFS, if you count that as a distribution at all.

Thanks, but note that, as with Alias, the second argument for
ScriptAlias is a directory path, according to the doc's.  Java servlets
are not files that apache finds and hands off to a module:  apache just
hands over the URI to the servlet container plugin, so if I understand
it, mod_alias won't help me here.

I posted an extensive writeup to plug-talk.  Yeah, a lot us miss him!

BTW, SCSI cables - Norvac in Beaverton, PCH cables in Hillsboro (maybe),
and check the surplus bins at Wacky Willies and at Tektronix RAMS
surplus.

   Problem solved. In part I know why, in part I don't know why.

   On tux I changed /etc/exports to the host.domainname.tld(rw) rather than
Class C IP address(rw). Stopped and restarted nfsd. Checked
/var/lib/nfs/etab and that matched what showmount -e had to offer. Re-ran
exportfs -r and that sync'd /var/lib/nfs/xtab. Of course, rmtab was still
empty because no remote host had mounted any exported filesystem.

   On salmo (as root) I ran 'mount /mnt/usr2' and the same for usr3 and usr4.
No error messages about permissions. Only /mnt/usr2 was actually mounted.
Checked ownership of /mnt and discovered that /usr2 was owned by
rshepard.users and /usr3-4 was owned by root.root. Chown on 3 and 4 and they
are now all mounted.

   SUMMARY: For whatever reason, /etc/exports wants host.domain rather than
IP address. The mounting host wants the mount point to be owned by a user
(or, by root.users, but I didn't check that option as I'm the only one
working on this box).

Thanks -- particulary to Galen -- who taught me a couple of new options and
pointed me to the nfs.sourceforge.net page where the question about
permissions had no apparent relevance but made me experiment until I rolled
7 on the first try.

   FWIW, as a part-time/strictly amateur SysAdmin, I've had absolutely no
problems installing Slackware or upgrading 8.0->8.1->9.0->9.1->10.0 on two
desktop and three portable machines (two of which are vintage 1999). I had
fits upgrading major Red Hat releases. Just my experience.

   I think that the most distinguishing characteristic of linux versus any
other OS on any platform past or present is the plethora of choices. There
must be a gazillion distributions, some forked from major brands such as Red
Hat and Debian, some based on the Leggo(R) principle. I don't know that one
could count the number of distributions and variants around.

   Then there are applications that run on top of all the various GNU tools.
Probably enough editors and scritping languages to stock the old dirigible
hanger in Tillamook from floor to ceiling. And, best of all, it doesn't
matter who likes what: it's mix-and-match and they all work. Even better,
they can be customized to express one's inner geek (or nerd as we used to be
called back in the early Pleistecene).

The same thing goes for Microsoft Windows and Apple.  They know how many 
are sold.  We don't know since it is free.  The latest word from the 
hats is that the tipping point for apple/linux has been reached.  I 
would say we are ahead of Apple by quite a margin just because 1/2 of 
the people running linux never bought anything.  Thus there is no way to 
really know.

If you are able to re-create the crash at will, then I'd try using top,

Even if that's the case, the installed base of the other distros would 
outweigh it greatly. It has to be at least 5:1. So again, the fact that 
there are more complaints about all the other distros makes sense simply 
from a statistical point of view.

I do not have a domain setup in my LAN.
The problem is that when I boot Linux, sendmail and sm-client each hang for
a considerable time.
The best I can deduce from the logs is that the system is spinning its
wheels looking for the domain server.
My /etc/hosts starts out:
127.0.0.1		Goku localhost.localdomain localhost

Is it looking for "localdomain"?

Bill,

   You're not running a local dns server so you need to point your system(s)
at an IP address where names can be resolved into numeric dot-quad (IP
address) format. Your ISP almost certainly has dns servers running and you
can put those names into /etc/resolv.conf.

   On my system I have:

nameserver 192.168.55.1		# I run DJB's dnscache here
nameserver 208.187.192.2
nameserver 208.187.226.2

   The first one won't do you any good, but you can use the others and those
of your ISP. Well, Hevanet hides it deeply (Tech
Support->Miscellaneous->Settings, but here're their DNS servers:

198.5.254.1  #Primary
198.5.254.5  #Secondary

You might want to use those in /etc/resolv.conf.

I think that if you tell sendmail its hostname, it will just assume that.

sendmail.cf: Dj<made up name>

That's what the hosts file is for.
Make sure it checks /etc/hosts first, though. This is normally defined in 
nsswitch.conf.

If you would like to learn a bit about DNS, how about setting
yourself up a dummy domain. Great way to learn about bind (named),
or you could use tinyDNS.

First question...

If you don't have a domain setup on your lan, why are you running 
sendmail and sm-client?

If you don't need them, then you should shut them off.

>The best I can deduce from the logs is that the system is spinning its

Yes, spinning wheels..

Trying to determine it's fully qualified domain name (fqdn).

Since you don't have one, it won't be able to find one. Either tell it 
to use something you specify in it's config file or turn it off.

No, the hosts file is one of the places that are used for lookup. 
Unfortunately, I believe sendmail doesn't use the /etc/hosts file, so it 
won't fine anything there.

For sending local messages, like those from cron.  It looks like he's using
a Fedora or Red hat setup, which initially configures them to listen only
on localhost, so it's not really a security problem.  (Although he should
make sure to alias mail for root to his account.)

I was under the impression that cron, et al would send them through

And what about mail that ended up in the queue? You could set up a cron 
job to flush the queue periodically, but I don't think it's set up that 
way by default. Granted, that shouldn't happen with local mail, but I 
agree with Wil. It should be restricted to local connections if he's 
using Fedora, so I don't see it as a problem to have it running.

Scott,

   Pardon my cynicism, but he's grabbing a political moment from something
that's already happening whether or not he makes a campaign issue from it.

   Note this quote from the article: "...unveiled plans for an Open
Technology center that is designed to boost the adoption of open technology
among developers and industries." Nothing about adoption by state, county or
local governments is there? And who would benefit most from the cost savings
in this era of tight budgets?

   Grandstanding. It's part of the political game.

So, we should each send him a message (letter, fax, e-mail, ?) referencing the 
KATU article, thanking him for his support, and pointing out that he could 
increase his support by encouraging state departments to switch to open 
source solutions, perhaps starting with Firefox. That should be fairly 
painless. Follow that with Open Office. Then, move on to less common 
applications.

   Like e-mail? Wonder if Thunderchicken has been ported to Microsoft.

   I know that OSU's mail server runs linux/postfix; I see that in the
headers of messages I receive. ODOT also runs linux on IBM mainframes
(zSeries a.k.a. S/390). But, there's a lot more that can be done with
minimal disruption.

Depends on which axis of simpler you're talking about. I've been watching
a *lot* of security alerts for exim pass by. Sendmail and Postfix don't
force you to baby them nearly as often with security fixes.

Yup, we use it at work as it includes a spell checker. A default install of

The lack of a spell-checker makes OE unusable??

Funny, all of a sudden I'm remembering Cyril Kornbluth's "The Marching

What kind of web apps?  Why would they require a specific browser,
period, or be coded such that two cousin browsers like Moz/FF couldn't
both work?

Carla,

   I thought that I posted a message to the list this afternoon ("Software
Politics", I think was the subject) that went into great detail on this
issue, among others. It's a Wired magazine article.

   The short answer: Firefox is much easier in the
Plugin-Development-Department.

Indeed it has.  I've been installing it on customers' virus-ridden

AFAIK, most government entities (Federal, State, and Local) in Oregon
run Exchange for their mail servers.  It costs so much more than Postfix
it must be better.

Getting them to migrate off Exchange would be like trying to get a cat
to migrate off catching birds.

Just because he's not talking about switching over the state and local 
computers doesn't mean he's grandstanding. Remind me never to be mayor 
or governor. You can't please everyone, and you get criticised even when 
you do the right thing.

If the new center helps to establish Portland as the center of the Linux 
world, then I'm not sure why anyone on this list would want to throw 
eggs at him for it.

Heck, as someone who is currently unemployed, I hope it happens and 
creates some new jobs very quickly ;)

Lacking the ability to correct your spelling in a business setting is a 
serious problem, IMHO. The bigger issue I was trying to point out was that MS 
requires you to purchase MS-Office or similar to have that ability. It's not 
included by default.

Rich,

   Last November I heard a story on OPB radio that the Portland area is
already considered to be the North American center for linux and other F/OSS.
Earlier last year one of the BizJournal's Power Breakfasts focused on this
software strength.

   I hope I didn't suggest that Kulongoski's words were unwelcome. I was
disappointed that he wasn't sufficiently enthused to annouce that the state
was going in this direction, too.

> Heck, as someone who is currently unemployed, I hope it happens and creates

   Well, darn! That's no good. We have too many highly qualified and capable
people here who are under- or un-employed. I, too, hope you find something
very soon.

I can't speak for the state of Oregon, and I'd never wish on anyone
the job of Exchange Administrator, but I know the frustration of 
looking for a bona fide calendaring solution that can stack up with 
Exchange.

Oracle makes one (well, Mr. Ellison opened his pocket book and bought 
Steltor's product) that's quite good, but it's not terribly well 
integrated with any clients save its own. MeetingMaker has one that's 
used at Synopsis (among other places), but I haven't installed the 
demo yet. Of course, these are both proprietary products.

We in the Free Software community haven't written a good replacement 
yet. UW is working on a Java-based product, but it's too fragile at 
this stage, and I don't know if its feature set really matches the 
needs of corporate scheduling.

IOW, Exchange offers more than e-mail transport and delivery: its 
users have a best-of-breed calendaring server. There just isn't a 
suite of Free software products that can replace it. For now, anyway.

Ditto Paul's comments on the dearth of decent Free calendaring.
Comparing Postfix to Exchange is like comparing an F1 engine to a
Trabant. No one here doubts the greatness of the F1 engine or the
badness of the Trabant, but let's be frank, the Trabant will take you
places that sitting on an engine block just can't. [1]

Exchange, so much more than a bad MTA!

We desperately need something that offers delegation, meaning the access
model of WebDAV and Mozilla Calendar doesn't cut it.

On the bright side, there are always projects getting our hopes up.
Here's something interesting from Shuttleworth and friends:

     1. I use postfix and have never touched Exchange, thank the maker.

How about having decent language skills? Spell checkers are very fallible. 
That's why you see weirdo punctuation, bad grammar, lose/loose, 
you/your/you're, it's/its and similar confusions. Most spelling and 
grammatical errors are at a middle-school level, not rare and exotic things 
that only grammar geeks grok.

Not that I want to encourage anyone to use OE- it is malware-friendly and uses 
a closed, non-compatible mailbox format.

The story is available in lots of anthologies, it's not hard to find. It's a 
satirical look at a society that has become populated by a large majority of 
stupid people, and the few remaining intelligent people are forced by 
compassion to act as their babysitters and protectors, mostly protecting them 
from themselves. Sure, it's a long leap from ranting against spell-checkers 
to such a scenario. Or maybe not such a long leap....

In my experience, and I've probably been hanging out with the wrong crowd, web 
app developers target a single browser. (Usually IE. :P) 

Every Web browser has its own idiosyncracies, extensions, and quirks, which is 
another reason developers like to choose one as their main target, instead of 
going insane trying make everything work perfectly in all of them. For 
example javascript handling is notoriously non-uniform. Mozilla and Firefox 
each support extensions, pretty much the same set, but these don't work in 
other browsers.

So another way of asking the question is how do you avoid getting locked-in to 
a particular platform? Obviously Aieee is the king of lockin, and migrating 
away from it is going to cause pain and expense. Suppose you wake up one fine 
day, decide Firefox sucks, and want to move your Web apps to something else- 
how painful would it be? Can you really design complex Web applications to be 
browser-agnostic?

Have you tried SuSE OpenExchange, or whatever it is called now since Novell 
bought them? Don't even bother with a mail/groupware client- use the browser 
interface and you get all the goodies, though it supports all the usual 
standalone mail clients, including outlook. IMO it is superior to MS 
Exchange.

Your server is trying to send a another server that is not accepting the

This is most likely a hardware problem, probably an overheating issue.
Pull the case cover off and check your fans, excessive dirt, etc.  Then
give your users a break and pull the burner.  Setup an old pentium box
to do the burning for you, you can even run it headless with VNC or an
exported X-session.

You are, of course, correct; it is in the dictionary.  However, as we were

Certainly not; however, people with excellent language skills do occasionally
make mistakes, particularly the sort caused by discrepancies between the
rhythm and speed of thought, writing and typing.

As to the latter question, I prefer Moz' for development.  It has a
better feature set, IMO.

That's a really good call, the Oracle box is maybe not the best place to 
be doing that sort of thing.

The thermal thing is a good call, too. I've seen a fan get so full of 
dust that it was jammed up, and the Athlon didn't like it much :) Drives 
overheating can be a problem as well.

You're crazy to complain about the lack of a spell checker in a piece of

Express is.

While it may be a valid issue with OE, it really pales in comparison
with the other issues out there...

Dan,

   You folks in the professional linux community know much better than do I
how to get this need in front of the right people. Now is the time to do so
for three major reasons:

   1.) There is a demonstrable need and the lack of such an application to
run on linux and the *BSDs is a serious hinderance to greater F/OSS adoption
in the private and public sectors.

   2.) OSDL has the official backing of Beaverton and the state to promote
and facilitate such projects in the new, Round incubator.

   3.) Large computer companies, IBM in particular and probably H-P, too,
sell a package of services and this is one that they need in their sales
kit. They may well be willing to fund the development because it removes one
sales objection (a legitimate one, you all tell us).

   There are also a number of under- and un-employed SysAdmin and application
programmers (I count two among my friends; one local one in the mid-west)
who can help make this happen. Rather than wringing hands about the
deficiency in the toolbox, look at this as an opportunity for fun and
profit.

Now that the Konqueror browser spell checks when I enter something into a 
textbox I guess I could make the same argument about IE, Mozilla, or 
Firefox. :-)

A spell checker is a nice feature but not an absolute requirement for an email 
client or any other program (like a web browser) IMHO.

For developing web apps, I'd go with Mozilla.  It has a much richer set of
tools to aid in development, whereas Firefox, as it's simply a browser, can 
only be used to test the app.

(Now, with that said, I have to admit that that whenever I write web pages
or apps, I do it with Emacs.)

Carla,

I've read the other replies and will offer this.  I see on the css-d list 
that web apps should be developed using a standards compliant browser (ie. 
Mozilla and I believe Firefox ) and once it displays and performs 
correctly there fix the bug-a-boos that show up in IE and other 
non-compliant browsers.  By compliant I mean XHTML 1.0 ( or at the least 
HTML 4.01 ).

As side note I just fiddled some Javascript to automatically generate 
class dates and when it is displayed in Moz and friends it gets the year 
correct ( var theYear = StartDate.getYear() + 1900 ) in IE it comes out as 
3905.  I just discovered this when the non-HTML class used IE to look at 
it.  The HTML class all used Firefox and Mozilla.

So now I get to do cross browser hacks.

Er, having cleaned out my mailbox prior to seeing the other responses,
I apologize if this has already been covered.

Whether or not I want to port an application to IE depends upon whether
or not I want to give up the benefits of Mozilla and Firefox. 
Specifically, if I am trying to develop a serious application and not
just "another Web app", XUL is a very powerful tool.  I've only had the
opportunity to work with it on one project, but when I did, it made my
life much easier.  When the company saw what I could do with XUL, they
simply said "no IE."

Of course, the company is now bankrupt, but that's another story :)

Cheers,
Ovid

Most interesting, as are all the responses. Thanks Pluggers! So there are at 
least three browser families (or rendering engines) to consider if your goal 
is maximum browser compatibility: IE, Mozilla, and KHTML. Things sure have 
changed from the days of <blink> tags, haven't they.

Rod,

   When I researched CSS and XHTML to re-do my Web site I came across many
Web pages that document how to make various versions of IE work despite
their different non-standard "features". The two CSS books I bought
(cookbooks by Eric Meyer and worth the price) also mention specific
corrections for various solutions.

HTH,

Rich

Carla,

   I've become puzzled as I've read responses to your original question. Are
you asking about using a particular browser for the development of Web
applications or about development of Web applications that can be accessed
via various browsers? We all seem to have provided answers for both
situations.

Got them.  I have a paper copy Eric's first book and his second on Safari.  
They are great and fun to read.
   The problem is I don't use IE and assumed Danny Goodman's book
"Javascript Bible" would have mentioned this issue but I was dodging
bullets as I was pulling the code together.  I also assumed ( poor idea 
when dealing with MS ) that for the most part javascript is javascript.

I've used a couple of Eric's hacks to get IE to use proper/defined css.  I 
have a couple more pages/site to fix up using them.  Now I have to check 
out the Javascript.  Damn!

Hi Alex,

I'm not sure if it supports all of those things, but Mailman seems to be 
a very popular choice for lists nowadays. I'm sure you can find a 
description of its features at the web site:

There are Firefox extensions to support web development.  Since there
have been questions about what the original question meant, here are a
few things you can use these extensions for, regardless of which editor
you use to actually create the content:

    o Document tree modeling; you can select parts of your page or code
    and it will highlight the part of the page or code containing that
    part of the sub-structure.

    o CSS examination; since styles can be inherited, it can be
    confusing to find which attributes are inherited or not.

    o JavaScript console; will show you errors and exceptions from
    JavaScript

    o JavaScript debugger (at least, I think there's one); most of the
    things you'd expect from a regular debugger.

    o Automated submission to various validators

Here's one Moz/Firefox extension:

The HTML Validator plugin for Firefox is one of my favorites:

If HTML Tidy likes the content, odds are it will render fine on MSIE,
Mozilla, Firefox, Netscape, Opera, Safari, Konqueror, Lynx, IBM
WebExplorer, Bob's Big Browser, etc.

If you use ssh keys to authenticate, you will never need to enter a password when running cvs commands.

Rob is correct, this is by far the easiest way to use CVS.

1) Set up ssh authorized_keys so you don't need a password to log in
2) Set CVSROOT=user at host:/path/to/cvsroot
3) Set CVS_RSH=ssh
4) Use CVS, no "cvs login" needed

Here is a quick guide to setting up an SSH "no password" login:

http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~mbonati/WIRC/manual/DATARED/setting_up_no-password_ssh.html

For improved security use ssh-agent to only enter the pass phrase once
while maintaining pass phrases on your keys.  See:

http://www.phy.bnl.gov/computing/gateway/ssh-agent.html

This is WAY easier to maintain than CVS pserver.

Or more probably a simple decision support system.

We have a few common problems that crop up just infrequently enough that
we ('I') can't keep all the answers in the head.  So I was hoping to come
up with a simple expert(ity) system to take us through the hoops.  Some of
the branches would require access to servers that only a few of us have
access to ( but could be accessed via (CGI) scripts ) so a web based
system would be great.

My Google search turned up mostly commercial stuff ; freshmeat only had
three entries , none suitable , and on CPAN I didn't find any example
applications ( since they were AI modules -- and assume you knew what you
were doing ;-).

Anyone know of web based , (preferrably perl coded ) , expert or decision 
support system software?


Once again thanks for all the help,
Rod

Ah, crud.  If you ask again in a few months, I'll have AI::Prolog
(http://search.cpan.org/~ovid/AI-Prolog-0.03/) stable and you'd be able
to whip it out with that.  Unfortunately, I have a job and only work on
it in my spare time, so it's only alpha and still requires that you
know Prolog :/

However, depending upon your needs, you could quite possibly use
FSA::Rules (http://search.cpan.org/~dwheeler/FSA-Rules-0.21/) for
something like this.  Plus, if you have a GraphViz installed, it can
print a graph of the underlying state machine so you can see if you've
modeled it correctly.  An example is at
http://users.easystreet.com/ovid/images/pg_rules.png.  Those are the
rules we are using at work to control how PostgreSQL gets installed.  I
wrote a lot of that module, so you have questions, you could shoot them
to me.

Yet another option, though it takes some work since the docs are awful:

Language::Prolog::Yaswi
(http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/htdocs/Language-Prolog-Yaswi/Language/Prolog/Yaswi.html).
 It's an interface to SWI-Prolog.  There are some caveats to using it
and I've written a bit about it at
http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/22708.    It's the fastest of the
bunch, but it's unmaintained and requires an older version of
SWI-Prolog.

Cheers,
Ovid

Well, for simple HTML and CSS, I like to use these validation tools:

   http://validator.w3.org/     and    http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

Granted these two won't even begin to deal with all the complexities of 
dynamic web
pages.  I'm somewhat surprised there aren't more complex (and probably 
costly) page
validators available that will do more comprehensive checks.

Thanks for all the overheat suggestion.  I will take a look at that 
possibility.
I would have thought that if the CPU overheated, the box will shutdown.
In my case, the box is still running, I just could not access it in any way.

I was not aware that burner can overheat too.  Will look into that.

Vincent,
I would tend to suspect a power or RAM limitation more than overheating.
You should throw a power meter on the box (I use Watts-Up) and see how
close to the edge it's running.
Be aware that Oracle tends to lock up RAM for it's own use.  I'd look at
the Oracle config to see how much RAM it's grabbing for the SGA, etc.

Thanks for all the overheat suggestion.  I will take a look at that 
possibility.
I would have thought that if the CPU overheated, the box will shutdown.
In my case, the box is still running, I just could not access it in any way.

I was not aware that burner can overheat too.  Will look into that.

How about a another set of eyes ?

Software

  Has the system been stable with Oracle before ?

  What kernel settings do you have ? Ah .. may sound dumb, but
  how much RAM did the BIOS find vs what you have ? Loose a
  stick and of the SGA is too big, but that should give some
  sort of message.

  Oh .. what about the oracle logs ?

  BTW What version of Oracle ?

  I'm running 10g on three boxes at home, soon to be redone
  useing CRS. So far been stable, but then I'm not stressing anything.

Hardware

  Do a full inspection, fans, re-seat all connectors, chips etc.

  What size power supply ? What quality PS ? I had a cheap case
  drive me nuts till I replaced the PS.

  What type RAM ? Speed etc. Does the BIOS detect the RAM
  correctly ?

  Are you 'stressing' anything with BIOS settings. Safe vs Fastest.

  Back to heat, make sure the CPU heat sink is attached well, dosn't
  take much to shake one loose. your MB tell what the CPU temp is ?

  Loose or over sized MB mounting screw heads. I fixed a friends
  box that went crazy after a couple years, ended up one MB screw
  head was touching a trace, took 2 years to finally make contact.

  Force overtemp condition but be careful, this should be a last
  resort if not done before. I use to do it as a job :).


Thats all can rattle off for now

Interesting.  Two things wonder me:

> 1) Set up ssh authorized_keys so you don't need a password to log in

According to the (very poorly edited) instructions at caltech.edu, I
must "generate a public/private key pair, and copy the public part into
the appropiate place on the server side".  So the no-password trick will
require some server changes, correct, even if I'm already using :ext:?

> 2) Set CVSROOT=user at host:/path/to/cvsroot

I use several different CVS servers on a regular basis, so I would not
want to set this to any default.  Maybe that step is unnecessary?

Hi Vincent,

When I was referring to drives overheating, I was thinking more of hard 
drives. But, if the burner was getting hot it's possible it could effect 
the other hardware.

It's also possible the problem is not thermal at all, as others have 
mentioned. I've seen various results from CPUs and drives overheating, 
including crashes and spontaneous reboots.

Certainly any kind of hardware diagnostics you can run will be good, and 
the other suggestions in the thread are very good as well. 
Unfortunately, a lot of times with this sort of problem you won't get a 
log message that will point a clear finger at what is causing the crash. 
Many times it's an issue of checking out a lot of potential problems and 
ruling them out one by one.

I would look at moving the burner to another box, though, that was a 
very good suggestion of Derek's.

Changes in your home directory on the server, but not to the SSH server itself.
You run 'ssh-keygen -t dsa', which creates ~/.ssh/id_dsa an ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub.

You then copy ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 on the server.
SSH is usually pretty strict about permissions, so your home directory must
not be group or world writable, and your ~/.ssh and ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2
shouldn't be group or world writable or readable.  (I forget the exact
requirements.)

You can use a shell function or alias to switch between CVS servers;
it's much easier than having to type that after -d everytime:

function cvs-home {
  export CVSROOT=blah
  export CVS_RSH=ssh
}

function cvs-work {
  export CVSROOT=blurg
  unset CVS_RSH
}

Thanks, that's useful.

Okay, but why set CVSROOT at all?  Normally I work with CVS from within
a local checkout.  From there, CVS can determine the CVSROOT from the
current "./CVS/Root" file.  Is it different with this RSH trick?

Your solution does fit for me, anyway, because I already use aliases
like "cvs-update" and "cvs-add".

If you just build a valid website using w3c standards, this is way less 
of an issue. XHTML and CSS are your friends. You still have to deal 
with things such as how IE breaks the box model, but in general your 
app will at least render and you can use the workarounds to deal with 
IE. Designing with Web Standards by Jeffrey Zeldman is a good starter 
book on the hows and whys. http://www.zeldman.com

Your main issues with requiring a specific browser come mostly from 
developing using asps and .Net. Mozilla, Firefox and safari all should 
render about the same. (the latest versions anyhow.)

The CVSROOT is useful if you're checking out a new module, otherwise
as you noted it gets the root from the already checked-out CVS/Root
file.  It's the same when using CVS_RSH=ssh.

Could we propose that the first project for the new center be a decent
calendaring application or replacement for exchange?

Just think, if we can pull this off along with the new center, it
really would put us on the map!

'Beaverton Linux Business Center announces release of Freexchange;
 fully integrated open source email, address book, and calendaring
 system, based on a variety of open source products includeing

As long as the rooted filesystem does not have the immutable bit set. 

And you found all the backdoors.

And you found all the binaries that have been modified.

And the additional processes that the system now loads.

And the rootkits.

Etc, etc, etc.

In my experience, I have found that it is VERY hard to find them all
unless you have some very good tools and no additional users on the box.
Some of the current rootkits add a HUGE number of backdoors and hidden
little gotchas.

It is a REAL bad idea to not reformat and start over.  (Unless you are
into creating a honeypot.)

http://www.nvidia.com/ has AMD64 drivers for the nvnet chipset.  You
have to get it from their site.  It is a binary-only driver with an
installer. http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_nforce_amd64_1.0-0292.html

I have used it on one machine.  Seems to work fairly well.  (It has some
odd error messages due to Win2k sending out bad packets, but it just
drops those.)

How about meeting 1/2 way.

What is Novel/Evolution and Mozilla/Thunderbird up to ?

Can a cal./sched. package be added to their packages ?

Can the skills and talent of those creating other time
based packages be used such as project tools.

Just thinking why reinvent what is out there ?

How about first doing a survey of what is out there, and
then contacting all the players and then seeing if there
is a chance to create something locally ?

Just random thoughts ..

I'm more interested in server boards. But my budget does not
allow for me to afford ServerWorks kit :(. Whats the better
boards for the little guy. I don't want graphics, audio, etc.
all I want is net and a serial port for the console.

If you buy a Dell or Compaq server thats all they are. Server Works M/B,
a Asian P/S, some easy to punch/bend/spot weld metal, and either black
or tan paint, identical kit.

I'd also like to hear more about the mini boards, I've been following
the discussion on the openbios mailing list, and when finally find a
job, I am very  interested in someday building a
baby cluster.

I'm just about ready to set up a Linux cluster at home for m yown
education. I did one about four years ago but things
were pretty primitive then. I can't afford much but have two reasonably
new servers (>2Ghz AMD Athlon/1GB RAM), and two older (<=1Ghz/<=256MB
RAM) servers and maybe an old HP with 2x600 Mhz
Pentium II/768MB, if I can find 3x18GB SCSI disks for it.

Just curious If anyone PLUG members have set one up before, and
suggestions on what you think are the best ways to go.

Thanks,

do you have another box with a serial port ? or an old
dumb tty ?

set up this bad box to getty out the serial port, connect
to it that way. this will eliminate the display/keyboard/mouse
and all the assoc stuff to drive the display. May also help
isolate network as well.

Try dmidecode.  If you have a modernish system (anything i686-class, at
least), you should be able to get all kinds of information.

This is all already in progress.  On the server side, there are at least
two projects with reasonably mature codebases:
    o OpenGroupware.org[1]
    o Open-Xchange[2] (*not* owned by SuSE/Novell; Netline actually owns
        it--SuSE just integrated it and sold it with their distro)

Both provide all the stuff you'd expect--calendar, schedule, lots of
other stuff.

There are also a few proprietary servers, such as Novell Groupwise[3] and
Samsung Contact[4] (formerly HP OpenMail).  Both run on Linux.

On the client side, Mozilla Sunbird[5] and Novell/Ximian Evolution are
developing to either support ical over WebDAV or more native interfaces for
the servers.  OpenOffice.org has a groupware project, part of which is called
Glow[6]; I don't know how much activity is has now; it's also Java-based.

There are other solutions, too, like the Kolab[7] server and the Bynari[8]
Insight Connector.  Both seem to be oriented towards storing information on
an IMAP server, which doesn't seem to be a good way to go IMO.  Also, Bynari
is an Outlook plugin for using a Linux srever--it doesn't help Linux desktops.
Kollab seems mainly oriented towards KDE (as you might guess).

1. http://www.opengroupware.org (in case you couldn't guess)
2. http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/
3. http://www.novell.com/products/groupwise/index.html

5. http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/
6. http://groupware.openoffice.org/glow/
7. http://kolab.org/
8. http://www.bynari.net/

There is still a lot of work to be done, but it's getting there.

I agree that re-invetion of what is already out there would be a waste.

Would it be within the scope of the new Beaverton center to try to bring
these projects together?

I can see something in the line of a full evaluation of what is already
there and the possibly creating any necessary 'glues' to put these
together to form something that is easily plug/play and yet robust.

I am curious, I see that there is some sentiment that LDAP on the back
end may not be suitable.

What would be a suitable back end storage of calendar and adressbook
type data?

I though that LDAP would be ideal as it can be used for authentication
as well.

Would a better solution be a relational database such as postgres/my/sql
for the data and ldap/kerberos for authentication?

This might be possible by reading the SPD data from the currently
installed RAM via the SMBus.  This would involve building the lm_sensors
stuff if not already available, running sensors-detect, loading the
appropriate module, determining the SMBus address of the installed RAM,
reading the SPD contents of the RAM, and decoding the SPD data.  If
all of this sounds foreign to you, it's probably best not to try it.

You may be able to figure out what you need to know just by determining
the motherboard chipset.  This can be done by running lspci and looking
for the part number of the host bridge.  For example, here's my machine:

tinman:~$ /sbin/lspci
00:00.0 Host bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8363/8365 [KT133/KM133] (rev 03)
00:01.0 PCI bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8363/8365 [KT133/KM133 AGP]
00:04.0 ISA bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C686 [Apollo Super South] (rev 40)
00:04.1 IDE interface: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586/B/686A/B PIPC Bus Master IDE (rev 06)
00:04.2 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. USB (rev 16)
00:04.3 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. USB (rev 16)
00:04.4 Bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C686 [Apollo Super ACPI] (rev 40)
00:04.5 Multimedia audio controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C686 AC97 Audio Controller (rev 50)
00:09.0 Ethernet controller: Digital Equipment Corporation DECchip 21140 [FasterNet] (rev 22)
00:0a.0 SCSI storage controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic 53c895 (rev 01)
00:11.0 Unknown mass storage controller: Promise Technology, Inc. 20265 (rev 02)
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Matrox Graphics, Inc. MGA G400 AGP (rev 82)


The host controller is a VIA VT8363 or VT8365.  Since the motherboard's
memory controller usually resides in the host bridge, it should be
possible to determine what type of memory is needed.  A few searches 
should tell you what you need to know.  If you post the output of lspci,
I can probably help.  No guarantees though.

I agree that re-invetion of what is already out there would be a waste.

Would it be within the scope of the new Beaverton center to try to bring
these projects together?

I can see something in the line of a full evaluation of what is already
there and the possibly creating any necessary 'glues' to put these
together to form something that is easily plug/play and yet robust.

I am curious, I see that there is some sentiment that LDAP on the back
end may not be suitable.

What would be a suitable back end storage of calendar and adressbook
type data?

I though that LDAP would be ideal as it can be used for authentication
as well.

Would a better solution be a relational database such as postgres/my/sql
for the data and ldap/kerberos for authentication?

I'd like to try (learn) a few different things.

Oh..

- First a few filter of some sort, graphics, engineering,
  FEA, ray tracing etc. basically pthreads, PVM, MPI.
  This to learn the APIs etc.

- I will soon have two database products but that
  should be easy, Oracle 10g w/CRS (already done but
  removed to rebuild the PCs). And MySQL,
  especially now that 4.1.8+ is out. But to me that
  not the type of cluster I'm thinking off.

- Finally something where I know nothing about the
  math, the financial world.

- And what should be first, cluster management
  tools

Another approach is to run `lspci`, given knowledge of the "Northbridge"
you can at a minimum cut it down to two types (likely one).

First line should look something like:

00:00.0 Host bridge:  ...

If you provide the root on the command line to other servers cvs keeps track of
the login info in .cvspass.
So once you checkout a project you don't have to specify all the
parameters again
provided you are in the project directory or don't wipe out .cvspass.

I think you hit the proverbial nail on the head.

We, the FOSS community have basically reached critical mass with
technical talent. But what I believe is missing is organization
talent. What I think would be great is a group that is skilled
at getting support i.e. $'s. And that same group or another that
is skilled at not only formulating a team, but keeping that team
together.

If there was such a shop, where I could get paid a decent wage,
health bennies, and an annual Tri-Met ticket :), I would jump
at the opportunity. [Wait, I don't want to be a programmer again,
but they would need a sys admin :) ]

I keep reading about places like software job shops, but
they all seem to be closed project centric.

I would think something like such a organization would work much
better then something owned by one of the biggies.

OSDL is an example for the technical side, but what is needed
is a business side.

It would be a good PSU Business School project to do a business case
class on starting such a company and getting it funded. Hmmm only
if I could afford right now to goto PSU ..

I agree, keep out of LDAPs DB.

I wish i had saved it, I had a report on a big company, I remember
something over 20,000 desktops. And the size of the cal/sked database.
Wow ... Think of what it must look like at IBM.

To me, it should use ANSI SQL. Keep it down to the basics. This would
allow one to use everything from tinySQL, MySQL, or if the company was
an 'Oracle Shop', then Oracle, or IIS. Remember at may companies it is
not technology that wins, it is who sales team wears the most expensive
suits, and gives out the most Blazer tickets. Back to technology :)

LDAP would work, but I wouldn't want to clutter LDAP's database with
transitory things. Think Windows registry.

To even simplify it, embed or distribute it with a small DB engine,
tinySQL or something like that, or something like DB4.

And don't forget, the most important, totally transparent
import/conversion from MS. It has to be there.

I think you hit the proverbial nail on the head.

We, the FOSS community have basically reached critical mass with
technical talent. But what I believe is missing is organization
talent. What I think would be great is a group that is skilled
at getting support i.e. $'s. And that same group or another that
is skilled at not only formulating a team, but keeping that team
together.

If there was such a shop, where I could get paid a decent wage,
health bennies, and an annual Tri-Met ticket :), I would jump
at the opportunity. [Wait, I don't want to be a programmer again,
but they would need a sys admin :) ]

I keep reading about places like software job shops, but
they all seem to be closed project centric.

I would think something like such a organization would work much
better then something owned by one of the biggies.

OSDL is an example for the technical side, but what is needed
is a business side.

It would be a good PSU Business School project to do a business case
class on starting such a company and getting it funded. Hmmm only
if I could afford right now to goto PSU ..

   I'm looking for pgp4pine. The latest google finds is version 4.1 from
2000. Is this what folks use? Does it matter that it's that old since it is
supposed to be an interface between gpg and pine?

Thanks,

Generally, it means that the service/daemon isn't running on that port. 
Perhaps you are behind a NAT and you don't have port 25 forwarded to you?

I want to put an overline over some signal names to indicate active-low
logic.  To my knowledge, the only way to get an overline is to use math
mode.

$\overline {ACTIVELOWSIGNAL}$

This works, but the text style looks different due to being in math
mode.  It appears to be slanted or in italics.  Is there a way to make
it use the 'normal', non-math text style?  What is the 'normal' text
style?

BTW, I'm using Evil Red Text in Lyx.

thanks,

Thanks Wil.  That gave me the MB # and I code look that up.

I did search around on the internet for a while today and never found

This may be a long shot.

http://www.unet.univie.ac.at/~a8603365/#TeX

See what the soul package might do for you.

you can control the 'depth' of the underline.

What does \ULdepth do for you ? Damn its been a long time, 1986 for
me since last time i hacked LaTex.

http://www.latex-project.org/guides/tlc2-ch3.pdf maybe.

If non of that works, what about taking the font you use,
and hack it in metafont, creating a new 'NOT' font ?

LDAP has its place; storing calendar and scheduling information is probably
not it.  I cannot necessarily say why, but WebDAV seems to be the direction
most of the afforementioned projects are headed.  OpenGroupware.org uses a
relational database to store the calendar data and publishes it through a
WebDAV interface.

One part that's not mentioned is group-centric addressbooks.  The ability to
have department-wide and company-wide addressbooks is generally considered
to be a requirement; LDAP is perfect for this.  It's already supported as
an addressbook source by almost every MUA.

The part that isn't very easy, currently, is actually getting contact
info into LDAP.  There are, of course, a number of web-based addressbook
applications that will manage LDAP contacts, but that adds a number of
steps over having the MUA manage contacts directly.  Evolution is the only
MUA I know of that will actually write to an LDAP directory; with a little
fiddling you can even differentiate between personal and shared contacts.
It's not easy to setup; I broke mine upgrading and moving stuff around a
few months ago and haven't bothered to fix it yet.

Open-Xchange uses OpenLDAP for addressbooks; OpenGroupware.org doesn't:
it publishes contacts as vCards through WebDAV.

I believe this works:

$\overline {\mathrm{ACTIVELOWSIGNAL}}$

probably not the best way though.

   Good for you for using LyX! I've no idea why it's called ERT when it's
just plain ol' LaTeX. Anywho, you can make the math mode type style upright
(roman) via the menus. Hold on while I fire up lyx ...

   OK, I'm back again. Look in Insert -> Math -> Font change and pick what
you like.

HTH,

   LyX, the GUI front end to LaTeX makes life much simpler. It's on the menu
system: Insert -> Math -> Fonts.

If your machines can boot DVDs, check out Quantian at

http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian

Quantian is a LiveDVD built on clusterKnoppix. It has clustering and 
large-scale scientific and computational finance tools out of the box, 
can be installed to hard disk like any Knoppix version, etc.

If your machines can't boot DVDs, you can download the ISO and "unpack" 
it onto your hard drive and boot it directly, then install to hard disk 
if you wish.

Thanks for the suggestion.  That got me pointed in the right direction.
Here's what I did.

\newcommand{\negate}[1]{$\overline\textrm{#1}$}
\negate{MYACTIVELOWSIGNAL}

Just so you know, I was sparing everyone the details.  The Lyx menus
aren't helpful in this instance.  I'm using the bytefield package.
  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/bytefield/
My actual LaTeX code looks something like this:

\newcommand{\negate}[1]{$\overline\textrm{#1}$}
\begin{center}
\scriptsize
\settowidth{\bitwidth}{CCCCCCCi}  % some field names are very wide
\begin{bytefield}{8} \bitheader[b]{0-7} \\
\bitbox{8}{\negate{P4}}
\\
\bitbox{4}{\negate{COL}} &
\bitbox{4}{\negate{ROW}}
\end{bytefield}
\end{center}

This creates a nice diagram of two 8 bit registers, the first having a 
single 8 bit field, and the second having two 4 bit fields.  The
bytefield package is particularly good for documenting things like
protocol headers and such.

Thanks to everyone for their help.

Galen,

   Interesting! Are you aware of the pstricks package, too? It permits us to
develop all sorts of graphics, such as the bitfields in a byte and a lot
more. For future reference, of course.

Thanks for the feedback,

Rich

I've used the browser-based version connected to a WebDAV/HTTPS
server.  The last version I looked at was about 6 months ago, and it
was pretty unstable.

It seemed adequate for basic calendar functions-- e.g. holidays,
appointments, but I wouldn't want to use it for anything serious.

I've been meaning to look into Sunbird in order to avoid losing my
whole browser when it eats itself, but so far laziness has won out.

Subject: [PLUG] ulimit weirdness
Message-ID: <9e0a357805012713329d295f2@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to change the max number of open files for a user (oracle).
 This is on a RedHat ES 3 box.  I've modifed /etc/security/limits.conf
and set the soft and hard limits for "nofile" for the oracle user.  If
I login directly as oracle then I get:

-bash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted

However, if I "su - oracle" then the new ulimit values are set.  The
PAM config files, system-auth and login, both contain pam_limits.so.

Any ideas what's going on here?
Thanks,
~M

Now I remember why I didn't use this-- it seems to lack any HTTP proxy support.

Yes, you're trying to change them over SSH, aren't you?  What happens is that
the limits built in for your shell (forked through sshd, at least indirectly)
are already set and sshd is running with privilege separation, so by the time
you've logged in, the limits cannot be raised.  Try disabling privsep in sshd
and see if that helps.  If so, add ulimit commands to your sshd init script,
re-enable privsep, and restart sshd after doing a full su to root.

If that sounds a little muddled, it's because it is.  I ran into it a few
months ago and the details are a little fuzzy, but I'm fairly certain that
both increasing the ulimits in the init script and disabling privsep in sshd
fixed it, in different ways.

Subject: [PLUG] Mac OS X: when good consoles go bad
Message-ID: <Pine.OSX.4.62.0501271436560.3796@dyn-50-66.galois.com>

I'm such a Mac newbie that I'm reluctant to post messages like this 
for fear that my supervisors might figure out that I shouldn't even be 
touching these machines, but here goes nothing. :-)

Our two OS X rack-mount servers are connected to a KVM. One of our 
long-time Mac users was showing me the cool ">console" login trick, 
whereby you can get a text-mode login screen.

In our setup, for some reason, the text-mode screen disappears after 
about five seconds, leaving me with a blank blue GUI screen. I.e., the 
console was gone, the mouse was active, but no windows or mouse 
actions were available. I have a feeling that the problem is related 
to our KVM, but I haven't confirmed that.

Otherwise, however, the machine was operating normally. I was able to 
use ssh to login to it without any trouble, and all services were 
functioning normally. If it were a Linux box, I'd say that X was 
running but xdm/gdm/kdm was hung somewhere.

We tried all sorts of keyboard tricks to get a login screen (text or 
GUI, we didn't care), all to no avail.

Finally, I logged in using ssh and poked around the process table. I 
saw this bit floating around:

root     11204   0.0  0.0    18072    292  ??  Ss+   1:39PM   0:00.12 
/usr/libexec/getty std.9600 console

Once I killed it, the regular GUI login window reappeared.

So I tried it again, thinking that maybe I needed to keep the 
keystokes a-flowin' to avoid the timeout. No luck. I got my username 
entered when, like before, I got a blank GUI screen. This time, 
however, the stuck process was login:

root     11191   0.0  0.0    27408    516  ??  Ss+   2:17PM   0:00.14 
login -p1 heinlein

Once I killed that process, the login window materialized once again.

Wierd, eh?

The only thing that occurs to me is that our KVM might not provide all 
the feedback necessary for maintaining a 9600 baud getty session, 
though I don't know where the hangup would be.

Although it's not free, http://www.novell.com/products/openexchange/ looks very
cool.  I've been using Evolution w/ Exchange 2k and 2k3 for a bit and it seems
pretty seamless.  At the minimum you might be able to avoid using
LookOut^H^H^Outlook.

If you are root, try mounting with the no_root_squash option.

Apologies in advance if this has already been tried and failed.

Poor, cynical Rich is correct.  This plan was announced by Beaverton
in their green flyers last year sometime.  I wish I'd saved it so I
could quote verbatim.  Perhaps another Beaverton resident whose wife
is less proactive about recycling could comment on what I remember
with solid facts?

The original Beaverton City article, as best I can remember, described
this as a business incubator fund.  I.e. Beaverton will provide space
and what amounts to angel round venture capital funding for companies
trying to make a go at something related to Open Source.  It was not
about trying to convince governments to use Open Source software.

I have not been able to find anything on the Beaverton City website to
back up my recollection, though.  I was hoping at least to find forms
or information about how one might get into the program.  If someone
here can find this, maybe some of you unemployed PLUGgers can get a
business case together and form up an Open Source business with
funding from the city?

Message-ID: <1106871315.6257.38.camel@hermes.braithwaites.net>

That's right! You can get that magic piece of paper really cheap from
Free Geek.

Free Geek is going to offer the Linux Professional Institute
(http://www.lpi.org/) Linux Certification exams on Sunday, March 6, 2005
at 1:00pm.

Actually, we just had a bunch of folks take the test this last Sunday,
but there were quite a few of folks who weren't able to take that test
or, like me, took only one of the two tests. And, of course, there is
the whole Level 2 test to look forward to as well.

We had cram sessions on Tuesday and Thursday evenings the last couple of
weeks before the test and we'll do that again, too. These won't be
classes, per se, but will instead focus on going over the subject areas
covered in some of the different training materials and sharing each
other's knowledge in advance of the test.

An important note! There are various books out there on the LPI exam,
but only one is current. That is Exam Cram 2 LPIC I by Que ISBN
0-7897-3127-4. The O'Reilly book is seriously out of date. This book
isn't perfect, but it does parallel the test pretty closely. Also, the
test software in the book is broken, but Chaz Sliger chased down the
real deal. Contact him or me off line and one of will get you the good
copy.

In keeping with the Free Geek tradition of trying to make technology
available to everyone, we have worked out a very special deal with LPI
on the test pricing so we only need to charge $40 for each exam.

Because we have to let LPI know a few weeks in advance how many people
are going to take the test (there are _very_ rigid rules around taking
the test), we need you to sign up right away.

We can give the test to up to 35 people, so we will sign up the first 35
people to contact Laurel Hoyt (ideath at freegeek.org), the Free Geek
Education Coordinator, with a cut-off date of 14 Feb 2005. Once we hit
the cutoff number or date, that's it.

I have a hunch that this will fill up quickly, so please don't wait.

I took 101 this last Sunday, and really want to take 102, but March 6
(or any first weekend in a month) is really a bad day for me.  Do you
happen to know when else y'all might offer it?

Oh, the Level 2 cert test is going to be given?  I took 102 this last time
and am pretty confident that I passed (I took 101 at OSCON '03).  Anyone else
considering the Level 2 cert?

Thanks all.  I have found a solution from Wil's suggestions.  I don't
know if I posted it to the list but the dmidecode program returned to
me the motherboard model which I could then look up and determine the
memory and other info.

thanks again.  I've figured out that my GB's of Simms will not work in
the DDR server this has.  :-(  Oh, well, buy yet another round of
memory.

There is a fairly comprehensive knowledge base tool called Protege 
that's "sorta" free. It's written in Java, so if you're willing to 
accept Sun's JRE/JDK license, the rest of it is free. The documentation 
is pretty good, but you really need to know "knowledge engineering" to 
use it.

Not yet. Laurel is the one that determines that. Ask her at Laurel Hoyt

I'm sure we can work out something.

Basically, you tell Laurel which of the LPI tests you want to take and
she'll order them up.

   Then there's CLIPS (and FuzzyCLIPS) from Natural Resources Canada and JESS
(Java Expert System Shell; from the folks at Sandia Labs). Bill Siler sells
his FLOPS (windows only and good for pattern detection). There are other
expert system shells out there for crisp logic.

Ron, so this means that Free Geek will periodically proctor exams and on the days
they do any pre-arranged exam will be available for taking?

And I share with Rob a conflict with March 6 and look forward to another testing
date.

   Oregon law prohibits those of us who are self-employed (as
sole-proprietors or the only employee of a Sub-chapter S corporation) from
participating in group health insurance plans offered by professional
societies and trade associations. A company must have two or more employees
to qualify for these plans.

   I'm trying to get this restriction removed during this legislative

assist in this campaign, please meet me on PLUG-TALK. I just signed up for
that list.

Message-ID: <Pine.OSX.4.62.0501280810440.7306@arrowhead.galois.com>

I was having coffee this morning with Jason B., the VP of Ops at 
Vesta: http://www.trustvesta.com/.

He mentioned that he's looking for a Linux admin who's also mildly 
conversant (or willing to become so) in Java. The job description is 
online: http://www.trustvesta.com/jobs/ivr_flow_programmer.asp.

Although the job includes "Programmer" in its title, it's largely a 
sysadmin job, and Jason says that Vesta is willing to provide the 
Java training necessary to come up to speed.

Vesta is pretty friendly toward Free Software, at least on the server 
end of things, and you'd be working with Tony Mancill, author of 
"Linux Routers: A Primer For Network Administrators" (Prentice Hall, 
2000).

Subject: [PLUG] space left on tape, a "clever" idea
Message-ID: <86fz0lv3t3.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


In my various recent struggles with the tape drive failures, I have
been refamiliarized with the tape utilities (mostly scripted long ago)
and reminded by its little inadequacies.  Chief among those, at least
with the DDS drives I possess, is the uncertainty regarding tape
usage.  That is, "how much space did I just use?" or "how much more
data could I fit on the tape?" or similar rephrasings.  In the world
of DDS, the tape only ejects when fully rewound, so you have no way to
judge visually.  And since there is typically compression involved,
you can't judge from how much data you wrote since compression rates
are wildly variable.

It suddenly occurred to me today (possibly after others have
repeatedly suggested this in the past, I am afraid to look), that one
way to judge how much space is left after a backup is simply to write
zeroes with datcompression off and let dd tell you how many blocks go
out before hitting the end of media.

For example:

  # mt -f /dev/nst0 setblk 32768
  # mt -f /dev/nst0 datcompression 2
  # tar -C / -b 64 -clf /dev/nst0 .
  # mt -f /dev/nst0 rewind
  # tar -C / -b 64 -dlf /dev/nst0
  # mt -f /dev/nst0 rewind
  # mt -f /dev/nst0 fsf 1
  # tar -C /aux -b 64 -clf /dev/nst0 .
  # mt -f /dev/nst0 rewind
  # mt -f /dev/nst0 fsf 1
  # tar -C /aux -b 64 -dlf /dev/nst0
  # mt -f /dev/nst0 rewind
  # mt -f /dev/nst0 fsf 2
  # mt -f /dev/nst0 datcompression 0
  # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nst0 bs=32768
  dd: writing `/dev/nst0': No space left on device
  34295+0 records in
  34294+0 records out

Then do the math:

  $ clisp -q -x '(format nil "~R bytes" (* 34294 32768))'
  "one billion, one hundred and twenty-three million, seven hundred and forty-five thousand, seven hundred and ninety-two bytes"

So, a little over a gig of space free on a native 12 gig cartridge.

Yes, that means that Free Geek will occasionally proctor exams, but that
will be based on the perceived level of demand. What that means is that
there has to be enough people signed up for a Sunday afternoon (the only
time that is workable considering the chaos at Free Geek when its open),
to make it worthwhile for Laurel to come in on her day off and/or me
come down from Vancouver BC for the day (I'm certified to proctor, but
am waiting until I've got my certification, since I can't take any exam
I have already proctored).

Of course, you need to take what I say about Free Geek plans with a
grain of salt, since I am no longer on staff at Free Geek, but that was
the plan when Laurel and I last talked.

Ah, the Tony Mancill who ALSO wrote "Linux Routers: A Primer For Network

Who - surprise! - lives, or at least hosts mancill.com , in Vancouver?

Are these two commands necessary?  An nst0 (no-rewind st0) tape
device should be positioned at the end of the first record after it
was written or read.  Perhaps DDS doesn't know how to do that...

... and this is *why* you probably don't want to rewind, at this point.
If you forget the fsf command, or accidentally enter fsf 1 rather than
fsf 2, you write zeros all over one of the tars you just made.  Yikes!

Clever, yes.  But now, how do you figure how many real records you
have on the tape, next time you decide to write on that tape?  Just
assume the last record is all zeros?  Just read a bit of each record
and look for a long string of zeros, then decide?  I suppose you 
could write lots of info on the tape label.

I hate tape labels, almost as much as I hate unlabelled tapes.

Back when I was still using tapes, the real issue was figuring out
whether an about-to-launch set of backups would *fit* on a tape.
With compression, it was always a bit indeterminate.  The strategy
became "try it and see", or else just assume it would be "about the
same as last time".  This really became a problem when dealing with
not-that-regular incremental backups.

Tapes:  Just Say No.  :-)

Hey Paul,

You might get me a job yet :) I did apply for that other one you 
mentioned, no word yet.

This opening sounds very interesting to me. I really haven't done any 
Java programming, but I spent a year and a half in the Ops department at 
  WebMD in a very Java-heavy environment. Almost all of apps on the 
production boxes, including even the web server for the big my.webmd.com 
health site, were all custom Java apps. Our job was to keep them all 
running, and to give the developers and QA people what they needed to do 
their jobs.

I didn't see a way on that web site to submit for a position, besides 
emailing HR. If you think it's appropriate could you give me Jason's 
email address, or pass on a resume for me? I'm going to attach an ASCII 
version. Maybe you should have it on hand anyway, since you are the best 
recruiter I've worked with this week ;)


Thanks man,

Rich

Necessary?  Maybe not.  But safer?  Definitely.  I once (long ago when
I was writing my backup script) played with doing relative tape
movements, but found that mt and the tape drive could find themselves
in disagreement and determined that the only reliable way to establish
position (at least with these drives) was to rewind and fsf.  These
are scripted backups, running overnight, so a little extra time spent
for robust tape positioning was worth it.

These are just full backups, so there are only ever two real tape
files.  To determine how much slack there is on the end, you'd just:  

  # dd if=/dev/nst0 of=/dev/null bs=32768

and wait for dd to tell you how many blocks it read, or perhaps
consult the log file from the corresponding backup where this
information will already exist.

Keith> I hate tape labels, almost as much as I hate unlabelled tapes.

I am assuming you are referring to adhesive backed labels stuck onto
the exterior of the cartridge rather than some data plunked on some
portion of the tape.  I've been using these for years:

  <http://www.labelonce.com/>

Write on with ultra fine point sharpie, erase (without a trace) with a
regular white eraser and write again.

Yes.  This "clever" idea doesn't totally solve the problem, but it
does provide a little bit more clue than the old "try it and see".

Keith> Tapes: Just Say No.  :-)

These are legacy backups, particularly where offsite storage in a 43.8
gram package is a desideratum.  The tape drive is a sunk cost.  Once
we exceed tape capacity, backup-to-disk will be the logical next step
in this application.

I know that this might get me flamed but this is the best place I know
to start to get a question like this answered.  My google searches didn't yield
any useful results.

So some background.

I'm in the process of building an embedded box to do VOIP using Linux and other
tools.  The system will be using a compact flash device as it's hard drive but
will be limited to the amount of writing that will be done to the device except
for a system upgrade.  Because of the niche market that these boxes will be
going into, it is very likely that some of the boxes will be opened and the 
flash removed to determine if they could just place this code elsewhere on
an old PC and use the system.  The result after that would be copying or selling
something that would undercut or stop our sales altogether.  I am being asked
to lock the code down to the hardware such that it would not run if
the detection
methods failed resulting in a kernel panic (root not found).  I fully
expect to have
to share all the sources (that I have) except the lock down portion.

I really don't want this to turn into a lecture about the virtues of
the GPL license.

So the real question,  what does one do for code protection in this
type of case?
Anyone on the list have opinions; done this before, etc?

   There's a lot of good, proprietary code sold for use on linux. WordPerfect
was an example, the XessSE spreadsheet's another and VMware is probably the
best known. The software I'm developing will also be proprietary.

   Let me offer the solution that was suggested to me: a dongle! I'm sure you
can work with the dongleteer to provide a physical connection that will work
only on your hardware. As a matter of fact, several vendors provide an
add-in card that puts the dongle inside the box.

   When you've built a better mousetrap you want to be the big cheese, at
least for a while. :-)

Subject: [PLUG] bash question: can variable contain a variable?
Message-ID: <20050128231247.GK21327@peak.org>

I want to write a bash function that takes a parameter containing the
name of a variable, to test that that variable is bound to a path to
an existing file, and to print an error with the variable name if it's
not found.  If bash's vars were like perl's, it'd look like this:

function checkispath {
    if [ ! -f $$1 ]; then echo "path $$1 in var $1 not found"; exit 1; fi
}

APATH=/tmp/somedir/somefile.txt
checkdir APATH                          # NOT checkdir "$APATH"

But the $$1 (and ${$1}, etc.) doesn't work in bash.  Is this even
possible in bash?  If so, what's the syntax?  For bonus credit, what the
heck do you google for to answer a question like this? :-)

Thanks,

I think you'll want to eval it, e.g.,

   function checkispath {
     eval FILENAME=$`echo $1`
     if test ! -f "$FILENAME"; then ...; fi
   }

See G3: http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/shell/bash/

I'm not using ${!var} syntax because I didn't know about it until the other
day; I've been using plain-old 'eval', like this:

#
# path_append - Appends a path element to any PATH-like variable.
#
# Pass it the name of the PATH-like variable and the string to append.
#
function path_append {
    if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
        printf 'path_append <PATH_LIKE> <path_element>\n'
        return 1
    fi
    
    local x
    eval x=\$$1
    
    if [ -n "$x" ]; then
        eval $1=$x:$2
    else
        eval $1=$2
    fi
}
###

faqs.org is a good place to start.  The newsgroup comp.unix.shell (which you
can search through Google Groups) has lots of this kind of thing; there are
other FAQs that are posted there regularly.

Rich's suggestion of a dongle is a very good one. Another alternative is
using a signed MD5 (or SH1) hash of the MAC address. That wouldn't cost
you beyond your effort.

And, yes, I have done similar stuff in the past.

Thanks guys!  I'm off and running.  Hadn't used eval since lisp, and

An "If you break this seal" license, a copyright and some hidden 
identification in the code could help.  Depends on whether your 
company wants to pursue legal action.

I don't much like calls from headhunters, especially those that can't
tell an analog chip designer from a C programmer, but a fellow from
AZAD (a local body shop) called with these:

http://www.azad.com/openings.htm#ssen
http://www.azad.com/openings.htm#sser

They are looking for somebody who can do C and testing and analog
calibration.  Linux and Real Time Operating Systems, in Portland.
Look at the website and contact AZAD for more info.

Rod,

   Isn't it better to prevent the crime rather than to prosecute after the

It depends on how much effort it takes to prevent it, how effective
the prevention is, how likely it is to actually happen, and the
consequences of not preventing it.

IMO, getting around the licensing issues in protecting something
that's probably built entirely out of GPL software (I'll bet an Ubuntu
CD that we're talking about an Asterisk-based system) is a major task.
And the fact is, folks who'd hack/pirate this appliance system are the
same folks who'd build their own instead of buying one.

And if they just repurpose the box, why care?  You got paid, and your
support costs just went down.  If your business model is based on a
hardware loss-leader, start looking for another one 'cos that's a
great way to burn through your funding.

So put some copyrighted Perl scripts in there and if there's
significant piracy going on, prosecute.  Otherwise, you're just adding
to development (and maybe unit) costs and pushing the ship date out.
That'll cost you sales just like piracy can.

Besides, breaking the GPL makes baby Jesus cry.

Feeling pundit-y,
  Aaron

Another (near closure, I think) update on the tape-backup-power-off
behavior.  We replaced the power supply with a 350W model.  Since
then, we've had no more poweroff events.  Then we noticed that we
couldn't write without errors, we replaced the tape drive.  Oddly,
during the first weeks of this saga, we *could* write to that tape
drive, the power-off failure occurred after hours of activity.  When,
even with the replacement tape drive, we still got errors though not
immediately, we replaced the SCSI card ($10, thank you Free Geek!) and
with it the driver, we got a clean backup two nights in a row.

I have tested the first tape drive on a different box and have the
same problems there.  Basically, the inability to write anything.
I've tried four different shrink wrapped (though not exactly new)
cartridges.  I suppose some of this could be explained by bad media,
but who knows?

How old is the drive, or do you know how many tapes have
been through it ? The head(s) may be worn out, or hopefully
just dirty.

Of the tape types I've used in recent years, DDS and LTO,

This is a DDS3 drive, BTW.

Yeah, the client was on a once-a-month cleaning schedule for about 3
years.  We ran cleaning cartridges several times during this episode.

gramofile

While I haven't recorded anything for several months, I've been working on and 
off  for a few years, on converting my LP's to mp3's and storing them on a 
40Gb hard drive on a machine in the basement (RH 7.0 on 200MHz Pentium). With 
my music database project (see my web site), I have a servicable juke box 
system. The line in and line out are wired to the stereo in the living room. 
Any machine in the house with a web browser can start playing a recording 
that is heard on the living room stereo.

I felt the need to share this with the list, for some reason :)

Rumor said that comcast upgraded residential customers to 4 Mb/s download 
speed last weds. This is true. On friday night I power cycled my "modem" 
and after it came back, I was getting 4 Mb/s (about 500KB/s).
Current speed: 4.0 Mb/384 Kb

Rumor also said that I could upgrade to 6.0 Mb/768 Kb! This costs $10 
more/month. I called them, and in less than 10 minutes that cablem modem 
rebooted, and I was downloading at 6 Mb/s. Amazing. That's 2x the speed I 
had early friday (up and down) for $10 more :-D

Some people don't like cable, and have delusions of speeds varying based on 
congestion. I can assure you, this never happens to most people. Every time 
I download something from my server at PSU I'm always getting the full 
speed. And about 19ms latency between home <-> PSU! And, I've had the same 
IP address for over a year now, btw.

Good stuff.
If you have cable tv already, you get a discount of $10 (total: $45/mo).
Add $10 for amazing speeds, and you're back at $55/mo. I believe this is 
comcast's response to verizon(?) upgrading to 3 Mb/s.
Good job, comcast!

I am experimenting with this right now - copying a audio tape of
my mother's memorial service to CD.

What came with the Redhat 9 on my laptop was "gnome sound recorder"
and "record".  The gnome program was broken as delivered, and I
had to revert to the Redhat 8 version.  It works, but is poorly
thought out.  It records the file as /tmp/untitled.raw, then converts
it as /tmp/untitled.tmp (which you can then rename).  Since raw-format
audio consumes 10MB/minute, a 45 minute cassette side requires 900MB
of storage available in /tmp ... before you save the file where you
really need it.

"record" looks better.  A command line program, it makes a little
ASCII graphic VU meter, which is handy for setting levels.  It looks
like just the sort of thing for driving from a cron script to record
a radio show, for example.

There are probably newer, more capable tools, but a .wav file is
a .wav file.  Next, I learn about building mp3's with "lame".

Sorry about my poor grammar.  I can't remember the last time that "have

I'm pretty sure that gramofile uses record to capture audio. Gramofile adds 
post processing with a number of standard filters to reduce noise, such as 
what you get from a scratched LP.

IIRC, lame is a front end to bladeenc. I haven't used lame, but I've been 
quite happy with bladeenc. It's a simple, command line program, called 
thusly:

 bladeenc [global switches] input1 [output1 [switches]] input2 ...  

I don't remember what the switches do; all I use is:
 
 bladeenc INPUT1 OUTPUT1 -br 256000

You can set the sampling rate to what you prefer. Our music collection is 
mostly classical, and we weren't happy with the lower rates. On the other 
hand, we couldn't tell the difference between 256000 and 3xxxxx (I forget 
what CD quality is, but it starts with a 3, and has six digits!). Saves a 
little space without noticeable loss of quality.

Message-ID: <200501301510.42873.rsteff.l@comcast.net>

Some of you will recall my ongoing saga of finding a keyboard with the right 
touch for my wife. Yesterday, she finally couldn't take it any longer, so we 
went over to Pacific Solutions to see what they had. 

Linda was running the store, as she often is, and plugged in several different 
brands of keyboard for my wife to try out. None of them were satisfactory, 
for one reason or another. Then, Linda recommended trying the keyboard she 
had plugged into her POS computer. While not as wonderful as the old Wyse 
keyboards my wife loves, that Kensington brand keyboard was acceptable.

As it happens, that unit came in a box of product samples Pacific Solutions 
got from Kensington, so there wasn't a new one in a box. Not to worry, 
though. Linda happily sold us her "broken in" keyboard.

So, add this to the growing list of good experiences with that establishment.

Personally, while I can tell the difference between keyboards, it doesn't 
matter that much to me. However, my wife was able to shave 1/2 hour from a 2 
hour transcription project once she had this new keyboard installed.

I haven't given up on the Wyse, yet. A friend of mine designs embedded 
circuits, and has offered to have me bring one over some day, so we can find 
out what thing puts out. Then, maybe we'll be able to design a small circuit 
to go between the Wyse keyboard and a PS/2 port. Maybe I'll be able to get 
one working for an anniversary present (March), but more likely I'll just 
manage to get it done for Christmas!

I got an email from Comcast yesterday announcing this. I powercycled the 
modem. I've only been able to get 3.5 Mbits/sec down in 
Azureus/Bittorrent, though. I haven't tried anything else, though. And I 
think the 384K up is a speed increase too; I think I was getting 256K up 
in Azureus/Bittorrent before.

I think I'll pay the extra ten bucks for six :) I'll pass on the TV though.

Verizon's upgrade to 3 MB/s was *their* response to Comcast's 3 MB/s. :) 
Of course the reason I went with Comcast in the first place is that the 
Verizon line to my house was too old for DSL. :)

I'll have to do a search on those. Somewhere in my stash, I have a split 
keyboard, but my wife can't stand it. She spent many hours behind a 
Selectric, so if I can find one or two of those, that may solve the problem. 
I think I could even get by with the old style, instead of PS2, since I have 
some adapters to convert between AT and PS2.

Thanks for the idea.

The Wyse keyboards are metal, too.

   Keytronic, just east of Spokane, used to make superior quality keyboards.
Had a much better feel than most. Good stuff. But, I still prefer my little
ones now. Of course, I don't do Windows and that makes a difference.

Dunno, but I'll check it out. Thanks for the link.

The keyboards I have were made for a 286 computer. The connection was by means 
of a telephone-like cable and RJ-?? connectors (not RJ-11, the smaller ones 
that go from the handset to the phone base). While one could use a Wyse 
supplied adapter to connect a standard PC keyboard to the 286, it doesn't 
work the other way around.

I thought of them. I've used Keytronic keyboards before and liked them, but 
Pat doesn't, and she's the one that counts on this project.

I believe that would be an RJ-12.

No, an RJ-45 is bigger. Richard was speaking of the smaller ones that 
are used in a telephone handset. Those are RJ-12.

Just to add yet another differing belief. RJ-45 can be up to 10 pins
despite only 8 of those being used for most purposes. The one used by
phones is RJ-14 which is 6. The smaller one used for phone handsets is
RJ-11 with 4 pins.

RJ-45 is what most ethernet cables use.

From a quick look for RJ-12 on Google, it looks like it is a 6-wire version of 
the RJ-11. A picture at: http://www.drahtex.com/pdf_drac/16.pdf shows one 
between an RJ-11 and an RJ-45. It looks to be as wide as a 45, but not as 
heavy. Probably good for three line telephone, but not enough wires for 
CAT-5.

A not so quick look on Google has me more confused than before. References to 
telephone handset cords talk about them having "standard RJ-11" plugs.

Well, I've spent way too much time on it, so I will in the future refer to 
them as "telephone handset plugs or jacks" and leave it at that. :-)

   Thanks, Russ. While I've used these different ones I never paid attention
to the numbers.

Alex,

   Google for 'css editor'. I found a nice one that I like. I don't know if
it will do all you wish because I write xhtml using emacs.

Yes.  But speaking from experience ( unsuccessful though it was ) I was
able to recover a script I wrote that was never paid for by the requester,
stolen by his 'partners', and the original code was lost during a company
reorganization ( went out of business ) before I could grab a copy.  I
found it on another hosting company's computer for a domain that I
recognized as the thieves.  I recognized it by the coding style and notes 
in the code ( CGI script ).  Not very good thieves, they didn't even file 
the serial number off.

Still being able to identify your code, besides helping in legal matters,
could be a deterent if it was "leaked" hidden idetifiers were in the code.  
And I probably shouldn't have brought it up but it still gets my dander up
when I think of it.  ( This is my button! :-)

One place you might look is the Gentoo home page. (www.gentoo.org). 
Their web pages and documentation are mostly written in XML and use CSS. 
If you do some digging, you'll probably find out what tools they're 
using. Of course, it might turn out they use Emacs or some other tool 
designed for folks like me with a well-developed auditory modality. :)

There are plenty of open-source WYSIWYG editors that will *make* an HTML 
document, using LaTeX as an intermediary. Check out LyX and TeXmacs, for 
example. And someone also mentioned Amaya.

Is there a minimum number of pairs necessary for CAT5?

AFAIK, nvu is about your only option.  http://nvu.com

It's based around Mozilla Composer code.

nvu *does* use CSS, but it also doesn't seem to understand <div> tags
very well and utilizes tables for basic layout (which, imho, is very
icky, even if "everybody else does it").

I guess it supports this.

There's definitely no Perl support in nvu.  You'll have a hard time
finding a WYSIWYG editor that supports scripting like that for dynamic
content period.  FrontPage supports FrontPage extensions (I don't think
it supports ASP) and I *think* DreamWeaver has some rudimentary PHP
support.  IMHO, dynamic content is best done in a text editor of some
sort, not a WYSIWYG editor.

I like Eclipse for my PHP/MySQL/HTML jobs.

Subject: [PLUG] mutt configuration question
Message-ID: <20050131170010.GN31264@merlot.com>

I use mutt (version 1.5.6+20040907i). I love mutt. It does what I want
it to do. Almost.

I have been told that a send-hook or folder-hook can be used to set my
outgoing ('From ') address based on who I'm sending to or which folder
I'm in. What I'm doing doesn't work for me.

  send-hook "~t plug at lists\.pdxlinux\.org" my_hdr "From: Kurt Sussman <plug at merlot.com>"
  send-hook "~t plug at lists\.pdxlinux\.org" my_hdr "Sender: Kurt Sussman <plug at merlot.com>"

The result of these two send-hooks is the wrong 'From' address on almost
all outgoing email, as if most email is seen by mutt as going to
'plug at lists.pdxlinux.org'. I have not yet found a pattern that will
allow me to predict when the address will be set incorrectly. 

I've also tried this:

  folder-hook =plug$ my_hdr "From: Kurt Sussman <plug at merlot.com>"
  folder-hook =plug$ my_hdr "Sender: Kurt Sussman <plug at merlot.com>"

and this

  folder-hook plug my_hdr "From: Kurt Sussman <plug at merlot.com>"
  folder-hook plug my_hdr "Sender: Kurt Sussman <plug at merlot.com>"

with the same results.

There's also a setting that is supposed to use the 'To' address in the
message I'm replying to as the 'From' address of the reply. That almost
never works. I see no pattern there either.

Any ideas?

TIA

As a follow up I received the card and it has an installation sheet that 
says either a 3.3 or 5 volt slot.  Now my only issues is to whether the 
PCI bus is 2.2 or greater.  During the boot I haven't noticed this, the 
CMOS doesn't say anything either and after booting I see nothing from 
lspci that states what version.  I assume that I can determine from the MB 
manufacturer so I'll check the the model ( an ASUS PIII system) this 
evening and see what I can find on the site.  In the mean time is there a 
common method to determine the PCI version?

2. You can cut out the other 2, or use them for power, phone, etc.
I've even ran 2 computers off the same cable before (both ends split out into 
two connectors).

Gigabit requires all 4 pairs.

I can't put my hands on it right now, but somewhere I have a booklet that 
defines CAT-5 in its various flavors. IIRC there's TIA568-A and TIA568-B, the 
difference being which pairs are connected to which pins. I'm pretty sure the 
standard requires four pairs, but I also remember reading somewhere that they 
aren't all used in some situations.

Each pair has a different number of twists per foot, which I understand is one 
of the ways to prevent interference between pairs. It just looks like wire, 
but there's some serious engineering behind it.

So, could you get away with just two pair of telephone wire? Over a short 
distance (a few feet) maybe. But across the room, or to the other end of the 
building, probably not.

Uhm, plug it in and see if it works?  It should, it's PCI, it's
designed for that.  BTW, you'd probably get someone saying, "it worked
for me" if you'd say what the card is.

Cat5 itself is a cabling spec.  Four pairs of Unshielded Twisted-Pair,
such-and-such impedence, crosstalk and capacitance for such-and-such
signal bandwidth.

100 Mbps ethernet (100Base-T) uses two of those four pairs.  You can
run 10Mbps (10Base-T) over two pairs of Cat3, which is your typical
phone-grade 4-pair UTP.

The PCI 2.1 spec was released 6/1/95.  The PCI 2.2 spec was released
12/18/98.  The 2.2 spec incorporates 17 ECNs(Engineering Change Notices)
to the 2.1 spec.  None of them are particularly earth shattering.  Six
of the seventeen ECNs are mechanical.  The remaining eleven ECNs cover
fairly specialized cases.

Any PCI equipment built within the last four or five years probably
conforms to 2.2.  Plus, I suspect your board would work fine when
installed in a 2.1 host system.

Not entirely accurate.  CAT5 doesn't really tell us anything about the
number of pairs.  My question was somewhat rhetorical, although I'm not
honestly sure if one or two pairs could be turned in to CAT5.  So I
asked the question.

CAT5 just defines the number of twists per distance and the basics (like
each wire is insulated, stuff like that)... it doesn't tell us how many
pairs are there.  I had a friend ask me a few years back if I wanted
some extra ~48 pair CAT5.  I think it was 48 pairs, it may have been
more or less.  I declined... I don't have much use for something like
that.  :-)

Note Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat5) doesn't mention how
many pairs there are, either.

The problem is that Mutt doesn't reset the headers you change in
send-hook, so you have to also include a match-all send-hook to reset
the header.  Also, I've always done all the changes for a particular
send-hook in one statement; I'm not sure if you can match multiple ones.

send-hook . \
    'my_hdr From: "Kurt Sussman <whatever at merlot.com>";
    my_hdr Sender: "Kurt Sussman <whatever at merlot.com>"'

send-hook '~t plug at lists\.pdxlinux\.org' \

    my_hdr Sender: "Kurt Sussman <plug at merlot.com>"'

I did in my earlier message ( but further down ) and didn't get any

It is pretty specialized ( per my other response ).  It is a TDM400P ( for
an Asterisk system ) and they specify PCI 2.2 .

I should find out tonight or tomorrow AM.  My concern , how , is it has a 
molex (?) connector on it -- "More Power"?  OF course I should worry too 
much.  I got the compter for $100 and the card cost $200.  I just don't 
want to re-start from scratch.

Sorry to inject another hack vs. crack discussion, but do you mean 'cat5
the cable that connects e.g. a NIC to a switch' (the common usage), or
'cat5 the electical spec' (the technically correct usage)?

Two pairs for the former, 4 pairs for the latter.

So, then, your question was both rhetorical and meaningless, and I tried to

Does anyone have any experience with 1&1 hosting?
(http://www.1and1.com)  They seem pretty darn cheap for a basic domain

Working with audio in Linux is not for the feint of heart.  Jack is only
needed for demanding applications:  those needing low latency and
synchronization with other audio app's.  Otherwise, I'd skip jack and
just use alsa.

I'm trying to put together something myself, and I've got rosegarden
working with jack/alsa.  I'm even running a preemptible 2.6 kernel with
the realtime patch, so that I can run 'jackd -R' as a normal user.  MIDI
is working too, but I still can't record audio!  I have an SBLive
Platinum, and jack won't let me connect the 1/4" mic' input (the one on
the LiveDrive) to rosegarden.

This stuff is tricky, and jack makes it trickier; so just be sure you
really need jack.

Sorry?  Hey we all got too much to do.  :-)

I got the developer package.  One of each.  MB is very late 90's so I'm

I'll be interested in the responses to this, too. 

My only experience with them is going to their site, just a few minutes ago, 
at the link you provided. It took a couple of minutes to load. Not a 
particularly good sign, but I noticed that they were preloading a ton of 
images. Maybe just an unfortunate site design choice.

What they have to offer sounds interesting, and I'll look into it some more, 
but I share your hesitation. I guess it's one of those situations where, "if 
it sounds to good to be true, then what's the catch?"

There is a Knopix variant that is designed to record sound.  It is
called DoCoMo or something similar.  I got it on the cover of a European
Linux magazine.  I will make a copy and bring it to the meeting.

Well, they offered free accounts when they first opened shop. I got one, but 
never used it past an initial test.
The tools for configuring your account seemed sound, and this was for the free 
account. I'd be inclined to say they are definitely worth a test drive.

I can't speak for their speed/uptime, but for $6/mo, it can't really hurt to 
check them out :)

There are a couple MAC fanatics here and they got me looking at the new 
mini macs.  Cute for sure.  Also got me thinking that they'd make really 
neat appliances.  Heard one of them say he read that they were going into 
the trunks of cars to run the sound system , hooked up to in-house 
sound systems , TV (PVR) etc.
   So I figured if they could run Linux they'd be way better!  :-)

Anyone tried it yet or thinking of porting Linux to the mini-Mac?

It seems a lot of folks like OS X better than Linux.  In fact, most
everybody I know who has tried Linux on PPC has eventually dropped it in
favor of running OS X full time.

It's the best of both worlds.

Count me as somebody interested in a mini, as soon as their Tiger
CoreImage compatibility is determined.  :-)

Two of my friends use them.  One with just web/mail hosting and the 
other has a "root server".  They've been happy with the service and 
haven't had any complaints.  I've been thinking about using them for the 
root server.  $49/month is pretty damn good.

I am seeing $6.00 for a domain name and $9.99 a month for any real 
hosting packages. and see no mention of php or ssh which I must have.  I 
didn't grep much though.  There are LAMP hosting sites all over those 
internets for $6 or $8 bucks.

I have a Powerbook for work that I dual-boot with Ubuntu. I prefer Linux 
on PPC, when using a distribution that supports PPC properly.

OS X has no real package management to speak of. A bunch of .pkg files 
does not a package manager make. Anything that's not a .app is a 
question mark in terms of upgrades.

I remember reading that one of the Gentoo developers got the PPC port 
working on a mini.

They are nice little devices, that's for sure: not much bigger than a 
Linksys or Netgear firewall/router and pretty quiet. I think they'd 
make a tremendous little server.

Somewhat astoundingly, given Apple's usual pricing scheme, the $500 or 
600 it'll set you back isn't out of line for what you'd pay for a 
whisper-quiet PC with a tiny form factor.

Yesterday I attempted to get debian installed on the laptop. So, 
re-partitioned, et al then started the sarge net inst. I got a base OS 
installed without too many issues. As I have been on an RPM based 
system, the apt-get method is new to me, but I kept getting packages as 
I went along when the system indicated they were needed. My final hurdle 
(well maybe not, I don't know what I don't know yet.) is getting X to 
start. When I issue the startx command, the screen goes blank for a bit 
then displays a "no screens found" message complaining that there are no 
Video BIOS modes for chosen depth. Looking in /var/log/XFree86.0.log, I 
can see that the Intel 82845GM is detected during the PCI scan, detects 
12288kb vidioram which it attempts to tell the BIOS about. Then, where 
the I810 driver checks for attached monitors, TV's and such, the LFP 
line has FALSE for attached and present. Just a little below that, the 
I810 reports Currently active displays on Pipe A, an LFP but complains 
of no display size information. I don't know where to go from here. Any 
pointers, hand-holding, hints greatly appreciated.

I would try these of tactics.

1) look for the (EE) messages in the log file, then let google track
that down for you.

2) man XFree86, look for the -configure option.  It's worked for me on
Debian on more than one occasion.
 
3) Look at the Linux-on-laptops website and find a webpage for the model
you have.  Sometimes they will post the X config file they are using, or
the author will mail it to you.

Just to be sure, you did configure X first?

In addition to the excellent advice from Sean, I would suggest checking
out the Linux-Dell-Laptops Yahoo! group mailing list.  There's all sorts
of good information there if you're having problems getting Linux to
work on your Dell laptop.

Gentoo also has a MAC Mini booting 2004.3; they claim that 2005.0 will

Nothing is wrong with fink. I've used fink and DarwinPorts but that's
not what I'm talking about.

Mac OS X, out of the box, has no sane package management. Anything not
in fink? Sorry, you're out of luck.

Thanks all, for the suggestions.  I ended up using Audacity.  It
didn't work so well on the laptop (I think there was an impedence
problem on the jack, maybe a microphone rather than line-in input?),
so I strung a couple 20-foot extensions upstairs to my EMU10k1 sound
card and it worked much better.  I also used gramofile to filter the
wav file.

These were a couple old vinyl records (1960s british comedy).  I
noticed that one of them had a pretty significant periodic squiggle in
the signal, a low frequency wavelet.  Of course, because it is low
frequency you don't notice it audibly (unless you are an elephant),
but it it pretty obvious visually.

Thanks again!

There's a long list of stuff they provide at:

http://order.1and1.com/xml/order/HostingBus;jsessionid=D40514DCEAB920DF38AAEE8EDB83B72E.TC63b?__frame=_top

About 1/2 way down the page there a section called Site-Building Tools which

Any recommended over the others?

This is the place to find out about Web hosts:
http://www.webhostingtalk.com/

I highly recommend AMS Computer Services, http://amscomputer.com/
Their support is first-rate- trouble tickets are answered quickly, and they 
are very reliable.
