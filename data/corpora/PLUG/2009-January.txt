Is there a way to make an apache webdav folder allow read access to
everybody, but require basic authentication for write access?

It looks like WebDAV supports ACL's for that type of access control but the
documentation I've found so far isn't very good.

=====  3) ProgrammingParty = VOIP
We'll work on learning about the Ekiga & Asterisk software. Goal is to
improve the SW or config to improve aspects of VOIP for the BTIP meeting
- more end user info, details about the connection, communication
between client & server, & server admin interface.

=====  4) INSTALLFEST
In Berkeley we'll likely be working to figure out why a Dell Vostro 1 yr
old with a new KUbuntu 8.04 (I chose that over 8.10 to avoid KDE 4 till
its got more bugs out & more features in) is locking up, in fact might
have messed up the booting SW, cause it hangs booting linux now, but
boots the preinstalled-nonfreesw OS.  Possible suspects: bad WiFi
driver, bad NVidia HW or driver, perhaps leading to bad disk writes. Or,
maybe bad disk or controller or MBoard?

IF item 2: is a possible Ubuntu Intrepid install help.  IF item 3: is a
possible distro upgrade on a 5+yo IBM thinkpad with a several years old
RH.  The owner knows in the past there have been problems with the power
management or battery driver, & hates dealing with the details of having
to investigate & locate a driver, then patch & compile a custom kernel
to make it work.

Looks like I found an RFC:

It's going to take a while to "digest" it (haha, get it?).

Something like this might work.  I'm not sure whether the Satisfy Any 
line is required, so you might want to try it both ways.  Also, don't 
forget that you'll need to set up ssl if you care about the security 
of your passwords.

   # authentication if necessary.
   Satisfy Any

Thank you, this works.  I had to remove "Satisfy Any" though, for this
supressed the login prompt, making it so I could never authenticate.
I also removed REPORT because it seemed to be an unrecognized option.
I base this on the observation that vim highlighted it red.  I didn't
test this thoroughly by any means.

My working setup:

<Directory "/var/www/html/site/svbronze/web/webapps/svbronze/static/media/webdav">
     Dav On
     AuthType Basic
     AuthName "webdav.pippiandcarlos.com"  # for later when I move to digest auth
     AuthUserFile "/var/www/webdav/.htpasswd-webdav.pippiandcarlos.com"
     Order allow,deny
     Allow from all
     <LimitExcept GET PROPFIND OPTIONS>
         Require valid-user
     </LimitExcept>
</Directory>

Subject: [PLUG] Is CentOS the best choice for servers?
Message-ID: <1230934636.11331.19.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Recently I redid my mail server, it was running Fedora Core 3.  I
started with Fedora 10 installing it as a backup system, then I 
decided to go with CentOS 5 for the main system.  Fedora 10 may 
be a sandbox, but it is way ahead of CentOS 5.2.  Ext4 support in 
Fedora 10 comes to mind first.  More current SDL graphics support 
comes to mind next.  CentOS 5.2 is 8 kernel levels behind Fedora 10.  

There are debian derivatives just to round the discussion out somewhat,
but when was the last time anyone found a deb package for openoffice
from the source?  Redhat derivatives seem to be dominating.

Why is CentOS so far behind the curve?

centos is an unbranded re-release of RHEL.
RHEL is redhat's conservative, stable release.
fedora is the bleeding edge lab from which the stable RHEL is
(eventually) extracted.

If you want stable, use centos.
If you want bleeding edge, use fedora.

Because it follows Red Hat's Enterprise Linux 5 to the letter.
Red Hat once a kernel/glibc is released on it's major version they don't
move things except for major performance, security fixes and hardware support.
There is a lot of stability fixes that go into the RHEL releases.
Also long term support meaning
that the ABI will not be changed over the lifetime of the product release.
Most of this is aimed at servers not desktops.  EXT4 is experimental.  I would
not trust a production server to using EXT4 (yet).

CentOS is trying to match all updates and releases but add the desktop tools
that are in a separate repository from the RHEL5 trees.

Couldn't tell you why these are different, as I don't follow these
distributions.  However, why do you need SDL graphics support in a
server?  When you say "way ahead", you're saying it has newer upstream
packages?  Does that mean it's good for a server?  What kind of server
are you running and how stable do you need it to be?  If you want it
stable, then shouldn't you go for a distro with well tested packages and
integration?

Uh... why do you need OO for a server?  And your source package is here:
  http://packages.debian.org/source/experimental/openoffice.org


You might want to better define your requirements in order to avoid an
all out "my distro is better than yours" food fight.

Because on an LTSP server, it needs to be available for terminal users.

Ok... and *when* did you mention this before?  Bad input often results
in bad output.  I had never heard of this acronym before and had to
Google it.  You give no context for what problem you're trying to solve
or project you're undertaking.

Subject: [PLUG] Fixing Obscure Printing Problem
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0901030651350.27803@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I've not received useful responses to my requests for help on various
Slackware mail lists/fora or from the SQL-Ledger mail list. Because we have
a bunch of Perl gurus here perhaps I can get the help I need to find and fix
a specific, but critical, printing problem. Specifically, since my upgrade
to Slackware 12.x I can no longer print directly from SQL-Ledger to the
printer. No invoices, no checks, no reports.

   However, I can print any of these to a PostScript file on disk (but the
checks must be done individually) and use lpr from the command line or from
within gv to print the contents. Displayed web pages in firefox print OK. So
do documents in xpdf, gv, OO.o Word, and text files. Only printing directly
from within SL fails, and only since the upgrade. I'm running
SQL-Ledger-2.8.18, the latest release, and I believe that I upgraded to that
version before the distribution upgrades from -11.0 to 12.0 and 12.1.

   Nothing has been changed by me in /usr/local/sql-ledger/sql-ledger.conf
since 2004. I've not changed printer definitions in /etc/cups/printers.conf.
And, again, there's no problem printing from any other application.

   SQL-Ledger is a series of perl scripts, a language that is as obtuse to me
as Cyrillic writing. I've no idea where to start looking to identify where
the problem might be.

   Later this weekend I'll upgrade to Slackware-12.2 and see if anything
changes. In the meantime, if you experienced SysAdmins can suggest tests to
identify the source of the problem I'd greatly appreciate your help.

Any error messages to stdout, or to /var/log/* or any other logging

David,

   I should have included in the original post that there are no messages
anywhere, including /var/log/httpd/error_log and /var/log/messages. If I
look at the CUPS browser admin page, no pending jobs are shown.

   What may be related is that I can no longer, as root, successfully
run lpq:

[root at salmo ~]# lpq
lpq: Unable to connect to server

   But, this morning, when I run the command as a user, instead of seeing the
same message I now see:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ lpq
laser5_duplex is ready and printing
Rank    Owner   Job     File(s)                         Total Size
active  rshepar 1629    (stdin)                         1024 bytes

after printing that spurious job I see:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ lpq
laser5_duplex is ready
no entries

   Can this be related? Why is root told that lpq is unable to connect to the
server?

Puzzled,

Rich

Yesterday my incoming email died.  I have been using Comcast for outbound and Debian with postfix/spamassassin for incoming mail.
I can still send (on port 587) but cannot receive mail anymore.  Everything was working fine yesterday.  Of course, talking to 
Comcast is non productive, especially after mentioning linux/postfix  etc.  

I don't know where to start.   Anyone got any ideas?  Or tell me what info to gather to make the mystery a bit clearer?

Sure.

Okay, what port were you receiving email on?  I think Comcast
has started blocking port 25.

Look in /var/log/maillog and /var/log/messages.

If you are using greylisting, be aware that the daemons can be
off and this can cause a mail blockage.

Do you have a hard disk failure or an ethernet card failure?
How about media failure, it's rare, but patch cables do go
bad sometimes.

How is your email forwarded to your debian mail server?  Are
you running a static ip or are you using dynamic dns?  Is someone
forwarding your email to you?  Is the outside layer that points
the email at your Debian server working?  If you have a domain,
have you paid for it?

Can you use iptraf to see if email is coming in and a comcast
email account to send test messages to your server?

Is your mail gateway your mailhub?  If it isn't, troubleshoot
the mail gateway before you troubleshoot your hub.

Look for 4[45]x and 5[45]x smtp errors in your mail logs.
cat /var/log/maillog | grep ' [45][45][0-9] '

Is your hard disk full?  This would cause mail to stop
coming in.

What have you changed in your postfix configuration files
since you lost email access?  Anything?  Are your config
files corrupt?

Sorry, out of ideas.

I'm sending email out on port 25 relaying it to Comcast.net's email server. I don't use very often but when I do it works using Postfix.

I was receiving mail on port 25, I currently have both 25 and 587 open on my router and both forwarding to my email server.  Not sure what I need to to with postfix et al to make it listen on 25 OR if I need to do something with IPtables.

>

Nothing in the logs.  I don't think the mail is getting to my server which explains the "silence of the logs".

No greylisting

No failures.  Web site is up and running.  Outbound traffic works fine both web and email.

I use dynamic dns managed by zoneedit.
MX records look good there, and like I said, everything was working till yesterday.
A records work for my web site fine.
Domain is paid up in full.

do not have iptraf but will look for it.
I am using comcast now for this email so that part works.  However if I send mail to my system id just disappears.  Looks like it gets sent, no errors, just silence.

Gateway is my linksys router.  Configuration looks the same as it always has.

Hard disk has plenty of room

No changes in the past week or so other than some spamassassin stuff.  

>

well, it's a good start.
what about iptables?  I am not doing any filtering right now (iptables -F).  Do I need to enable anything to get my system to listen on 587.

I can send, but only on 587.
I cannot receive anything on any port.

I use zoneedit for my dynamic dns needs, and they have a web redirecting service.  I can't find a similar service for email though.  Anyone got any info on how to do this?  I am not locked in to zoneedit by any means (but they are free and that is good), so changing dynamic dns provider is ok.

I have Comcast.

FWIW, I tried telnet to confirm available ports:

telnet smtp.comcast.net 25
telnet smtp.comcast.net 26
telnet smtp.comcast.net 587
telnet mail.comcast.net 110
telnet mail.comcast.net 143

Based on the output, seems like Comcast only supports ports 587 and 110.

Thanks,
Mike

What user does the webserver run as?  Does that user have permission to 
print?  Does the configured 'printer' program from the config exist and 
is it in the $PATH environment of the server (or configured with an 
absolute path?)

You *should* see something in the server's error log, but only if the 
code checks the return value of the system call and prints to stderr.  
A quick glance at the code suggests that this is not the case, but you 
should be getting some kind of error in the browser interface.

I would never write a piped open like this, but it appears to be what is 
happening.

  $form->{OUT} = "| $printer{$form->{media}}";
  ...
  open(OUT, "$form->{OUT}") or $form->error("$form->{OUT} : $!");

If you can su to the web user and lpr works, I would suspect a path 
snafu, but AFAICT from a glance at the code you should probably be 
getting an error message on screen :-/

port 25 inbound to my box on comcast is also being filtered now.

looks like you'll have to host your mail somewhere other than on your
comcast connection. or you can pay for a comcast business account.

I use Google for my domain.

Port 587 is for client-to-server, not server-to-server.  For example, my
email from my laptop mail client would first go to my stonehenge.com server
via port 587, and then if it's for you, will go to your port 25, since that's
server-to-server.

So, while you can likely changing your mail injection (client to server) for
your own machine to 587, you are not going to change the world (server to
server) away from port 25... that's firmly embedded in the design.

As others have said, you'll need to host your domain somewhere else.

Subject: [PLUG] Solved (sort of) -- email broken
Message-ID: <4960F0CC.80606@frankhunt.com>

Well after a late night and early morning session with Comcast and my 
email system and zoneedit, I think I have hacked everything into shape. 
  In the past, I have used Comcast's SMTP server for my outbound mail - 
masquerading and site-hiding makes the mail look like it is coming from 
my domain.  That still works only now I have to use port 587 rather than 
25.  Easy fix.  HOWEVER, Comcast in their infinite wisdom (actually all 
of the providers will be doing this) has changed their incoming mail to 
port 587 and programmed the modem to block port 25.  This presents a 
problem because my MX records are pointing at port 25.  End result of 
this is that my mail was not getting through to my local Linux mail 
server.  There were three choices: (a) somehow figure out how to 
redirect my incoming emails to port 587; (2) reluctantly stop using my 
own server (hard to give up after 15 years) and use Comcastic; (III) 
figure out how to hack the Comcast modem so it opens port 25.  I went 
with #2 because redirection is difficult and costs $$, and hacking the 
modem is probably not a good idea.  I had to generate a bunch of email 
accounts on Comcast (still not enough so I did some consolidation), then 
use zoneedit's mail forwarding service  to send  mail addressed to 
"somebody @ frankhunt.com" to  "somebody else @ comcast.net".  Then I 
changed my mail readers (Thunderbird, mostly) to point at Comcast's pop 
server instead of mine.  Holy Crap!  What a hassle.  I think it is all 
working now, finally. Time will tell.  I feel kind of naked without 
spamassassin though.

Eric,

   Again, nothing has been changed by me since everything worked (and it
worked for 4 years with a series of Slackware versions.) One thing of
potential relevance that did change between Slackware-11.0 and -12.0 (or
-12.1) was that of the apache package to the httpd package.

   One effect of this change I discovered with an earlier printing problem
that affected all applications was the relevant config and log files had
moved from /etc/apache and /var/log/apache to /etc/httpd and /var/log/httpd.
Copying the SQL-Ledger configuration stanza from the apache directory to the
httpd directory restored my ability to access the applicaion. The two
entries at the tail of /var/log/httpd/error_log are from Dec 16 when I had
problems accessing SQL-Ledger:

[Tue Dec 16 08:50:08 2008] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] File does not exist:
/var/www/htdocs/aesi
[Tue Dec 16 08:51:13 2008] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] File does not exist:
/var/www/htdocs/app-ecosys

Once I fixed the location of the config file those went away. I ran SL on
the 30th of December and had to print checks, one-by-one, as postscript
files, then print them from the command line using lpr. No entries in the
error_log for that day. But, the access_log records my activities:

   This shows my attempts to print checks and reports from within SL; the
access is recorded but no errors are shown.

   Another change caused by _something_ that remains unknown to me. was the
need to specify CUPS_SERVER=localhost. Hadn't before needed this. Doing some
investigation after a nudge in the right direction by Kurt suggested that
this should be specified in /etc/cups/client.conf. So I made the change
there, but I still could not print at all. Adding the line, 'export
CUPS_SERVER=localhost' to ~/.bash_profile (and sourcing that file)
immediately allowed printing and that environment variable is now loaded
each time I log into the system.

   Now I'm down to an inability to print directly from only one application
(among those I've tried; there may be others still unknown to me.) Not being
sure I know what information will be helpful to you, I'll try to include as
much as possible.

   From /etc/passwd:

apache:x:80:80:User for Apache:/srv/httpd:/bin/false
(there is no httpd user)

   From ls /srv/httpd:

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 8 2008-12-07 08:43 /srv/httpd -> /var/www/

   Permissions and ownerships:

drwxr-xr-x  21 root     root    616 2008-04-28 19:38 /var/
drwxr-xr-x  6  root	root	144 2008-07-28 12:41 /var/www/

drwxrwxrwx  4  root	root   1192 2008-12-16 09:06 /var/www/htdocs/appl-ecosys/

drwxr-xr-x  27 root     root    808 2008-12-22 15:25 /usr/

drwxr-xr-x  12 apache   apache 1200 2008-11-19 10:06 /usr/local/sql-ledger/

then it gets messy as the upgrades and edits have left that directory with a
collection of owners and groups:

   See above.

   I hope this helps.

This makes me think you may need to define that variable in apache or 
otherwise set it globally.

The problem is Comcast blocking port 25.  You are not the only one hit by
this. I had someone else hit by this and he thought it was a system failure.

was working fine yesterday.  Of course, talking to
Comcast is non productive, especially after mentioning linux/postfix  etc.

I don't know where to start.   Anyone got any ideas?  Or tell me what info
to gather to make the mystery a bit clearer?

thanks,

They changed their outgoing port to 587, not their incoming. Incoming is 
port 110, not 25, and you can't point MX records at ports, only IP's.

How does redirecting cost money? Can't you just tell your mail handler 
to listen on port $whateverTheySaid. Are you /positive/ they said 
incoming on 587? Lots of providers have been using these ports for 
years, this is nothing new other than one more provider decided to make 
the switch, but using 587 for incoming makes me think you misunderstood.

I think you have two much better options. 1) Upgrade to Comcast's 
business service. The price has come WAY down recently. And they give 
you 5 static IP's. The downside is you will pay a little more per month 
possibly. 2) Sign up for Google Apps for Domains. It's free, just use 
their mail service by redirecting your MX records to them (explained 
when signing up) and get SPAM filtering far beyond SPAM Assassin that 
you don't have to keep up to date. Finally use email like you always 
have with either choice.

Maybe since you have it working you don't have the incentive to change
again, but I think  a more robust solution would be the following
setup.
1) get a free google apps account and point your MX record at the
google smtp server
http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/index.html

2) install Fetchmail to download mail from  google and pass it through
your procmail/ spamassassin

3) read mail as before

This keeps a backup of your mail at google for times when you don't
have access to your server and gets around the port 25 blocking
problem.

Rich,

Apache server may be your bain.  The user may have changed in your 
Slackware upgrade.  Check to see if your cgi/perl scripts allow the 
webserver owner visibility to them.  There probably is a perl script 
that does not allow permission to the owner.  You would think that this 
would show in the log, but it would be determined in the perl script how 
the permission error is handled.

Apache authenticates the user, but still runs as itself.

Ken,

   Good point. I also noticed just this morning that the distribution upgrade
went from apache-1.3.7 to http-2.2.9.

Subject: [PLUG] Computer audio out to stereo
Message-ID: <20090104160252.0b922c90.johnxj@comcast.net>

For a long time I have wanted to use my computer as the source of audio
for my home stereo. Not only is it more convenient, but there are more
options - streaming internet radio stations, for example. 

Fifteen years ago I paid $300 each for the speakers in my stereo. I
have investigated high quality computer speakers and they are a joke.
Wagner and plastic are not a good combination. Therefore, the ideal
solution is to get the audio from the sound card into the stereo
preamp. Then I can get the sound into a set of real speakers.

The first thing I tried was simply a cable that had a "headphone" jack
on one end and a pair of RCA jacks on the other. They work, but the
sound is distorted. It has been a long time since my days as an
audiophile, but I seem to remember that the impedance that a preamp
expects is 40,000 ohms, where the impedance delivered by a sound card
is designed for a headset, which is probably 4-32 ohms or so. I am
guessing that this mismatch is the source of the distortion. If my
guess is way off base, please enlighten me.

I also have an FM transmitter thingy for an iPod. Again, it works, but
the sound is still distorted. Plus, it will only plug into an iPod - it
needs an extra plug that iPods have next to the headphone jack where it
can draw power. Plus, its range sucks. The stereo can't find it even
with the iPod sitting on top of the receiver. I have no idea why the
sound is still distorted because I have no clue how the thing works.

Note that I am only interested in audio. If I want to play a DVD I have
an Ubuntu desktop computer right next to me that plays them just fine.
Across the room I have a real television set for watching TV. When the
local television stations start broadcasting Puccini during prime time
I'll be interested in better sound for the video. Meantime I am not
interested in having Hollywood blast me out of my chair with a sound
track written to startle a deaf stone.

Having said that, the Asus M2NPV-VM motherboard in my desktop computer
came with a TV-out add-on gadget. It plugs into a connector on the
motherboard and occupies a slot on the back. It has four RCA jacks for
TV-out. I wonder if two of those might be for sound. If so, considering
that the jacks are standard RCA jacks, might the impedance be
different? The manual says little about it other than to explain how to
connect it to the motherboard.

I know there are PLUGgers who are media gurus. Can anyone suggest a
solution? Or at least help me figure out for sure why the sound is
distorted? Any advice or suggestions welcome.

I'm guessing if you go to the mobo vendor's web site, you'll find a spec
sheet that details exactly what the audio hookups are coming out of the
"sound card". Or, you could ask a gamer. :)

Speaking of Puccini, you *do* know that the Met broadcast next Saturday
is simulcast in HDTV, which is usually live at one of the theaters here
in town (Lloyd Center, perhaps) and which is often repeated the day
after at a number of theaters locally and which is often available
afterwards on a DVD, right? I saw "Peter Grimes" and "The First Emperor"
that way, and it's a spectacular experience!

Assuming your preamp has SPDIF in:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPDIF

The spec page for your motherboard claims it has the SPDIF header
onboard and just needs the cable.

John,
I have such a setup.  I expect that you are using the preamp input to your 
stereo, which would account for the distortion.  (The preamp input is made for 
very low level signals.)  There should be a "line out" on your sound card. 
There should be a "line in" or "aux in" on your amplifier.  RCA cables will link 
the two.  If your amp only has a "Tape input", that should work, but the front 
panel control to get it working will be "tape monitor".

The advice from Dan about SPDIF seems to refer to digital output.  I doubt your 
stereo has inputs to accommodate it.

(You may find that the output from your sound card will be a small phone-type 
jack.  You can buy cables which have the proper phone plug on one end, and two 
RCA plugs on the other.)

Does this make sense?

-Denis

I do have the connector-adapter cables that you mention. One end is a
plug that fits the headphone/speaker jack on the motherboard sound
output panel and the other end terminates in two RCA plugs. And yes, I
did connect the stereo end to the AUX input. (Actually, the preamp has
no AUX input, but it does have inputs for PHONO, CD, MD/TAPE, TV/SAT
and VIDEO. I tried all but the PHONO inputs and the sound was equally
distorted on all. (The PHONO is for magnetic cartridge, I am sure.)

The stereo has no input for SPDIF, so that is probably not an option.

But noting that the stereo has video input jacks and the motherboard
add-on TV-out gadget has video-out jacks, perhaps that is a solution. I
certainly never tried it. Only problem is that the video-out gadget on
the computer has four RCA jacks, but they are not marked, and the
manual says nothing. One is white and slightly recessed, another is
red, and two are green. There is also a round connector about 3/8" in
diameter that looks like it is supposed to take a plug with pins, sort
of like an old-timey keyboard jack. I am clueless, but I can go to
Asus.com and see if I can scare up any further details. 

If I can figure which jacks on the TV-out gadget are the audio I will
try that first. I already have a long RCA cable, so it's just a matter
of repositioning the stereo close enough to the computer to reach.
Hmmm, maybe first I need to tell Ubuntu to find the TV-out gadget and
send the sound to it. Need more clues.

1) The computer only has Intrepid x86_64, no Windows.

2) Thanks for the clarification about the jacks on the TV-out gadget.

3) From Asus I discovered that there is a connector on the motherboard
for an SPDIF-out device, but the device must be purchased separately.
In other words, I ain't got one. 

4) And (most importantly), what is the "auxctl" program? Synaptic has
never heard of it, and Google thinks it is a part for a Chrysler. This
strikes me as very possibly the source of my problem. I never realized
there was a difference between "line-out" and "speaker-out." If it is
on "speaker-out" and I can switch it to "line-out" that may cure the
distortion problem.

You are overdriving the input to your receiver.  Set the volume on your 
receiver to its normal position, then reduce the volume of the computer 
output until the sound is no longer distorted.  At this point the sound 
level from your speakers may be too low.  Increase the volume using the 
*receiver* volume control.

I wouldn't think that that thing should be necessary. I've done the
computer output to stereo input many times and never had a problem. I
don't have a super high end stereo, but I couldn't hear any
distortion.

Phono is for a turntable - you know, a 33 (or 45 or 78) RPM record.
*Don't* use that one. It's got a preamp built in that will go nuts
with regular input.

The video output, if it has audio coming out of RCA plugs, will just
be industry standard signal. But it sounds like someone else found out
that the audio comes out of a mini stereo jack.

Although Galen is probably right that even if you're using an amp out
for speakers that if you have it cranked down low enough you can
probably make things work. I would *highly* suggest using the proper,
un-amplified output which should then make everything just work.

I've been trying to figure out how to set the device to "line out"
instead of "speaker out," but so far have not been successful.
Alsamixer is inscrutable - can't find any documentation addressing
"line out" v. "speaker out." The GUI Volume Control applet does not
show any way to set it to "line out" either. The GUI does show a slider
for PC Speaker, but when I muted it the speakers still worked as
before. 

Then I found a wiki on this and couldn't understand more than two or
three sentences. Hundreds of terms that I have no ken of. It's all very
confusing.

I kind of doubt that there is a way to configure the output connector 
for line out v. speaker out.  Given a typical motherboard/sound card, 
the lime colored connector acts both the line output and headphone 
output.  Not to say that it doesn't exist, but I don't recall ever 
seeing a control in the mixer to this.

It doesn't take much in the way of voltage to drive the typical 
headphones.  Nonetheless, the volume setting that gives you a 
reasonable headphone volume may be too high for your receiver input. 
Try my earlier suggestion regarding volume adjustment.  I think you 
should be able to find a setting that works.  Use any input to your 
receiver except a phono or mic input.  Your main challenge is to find 
all of the volume controls that affect the signal.

Regarding the transformer widget you found, you should only need 
something like this if you run into ground loop problems(AC hum).  For 
this type of signal I think the impedance match argument is bogus. 
Also, $30 for what is essentially just a couple of audio transformers 
plus connectors seems steep to me.

Finally, I have the audio from my computer hooked to a receiver as 
above.  It works fine, but I did run into an issue with Rhythmbox.  If 
the Rhythmbox volume control is set much above the next to lowest 
setting, there will be distortion.  This distortion is independent of 
the mixer settings.  This occurs when playing back a CD that has been 
ripped to ogg.

Not that I'm advocating switching, but when people wonder why some of us
use a Mac, let me describe the Mac Solution:

1) buy an airport express.  It even doubles as a wifi basestation, but it also
has jacks to hook to your sound system over wifi. (think "optimized for the
college student in the dorm room".)

2) send any music or streaming audio from your iTunes to the airport express.

3) if you want *other* sound sent to your sound system, pick up a copy
of airjack from rogue amoeba.

Far less horsing around.  :)

Subject: [PLUG] Vegetarianism
Message-ID: <1231191513.3029.55.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

The assumption that vegetarianism is better than any other diet is
being defended quite aggressively on here, but there is a problem
with vegetarianism.

The human body is not designed for it long term.

The theory is that going lower on the food chain will increase
the amount of food available for people to eat.  This is assuming
that people can get everything they need from plant sources alone.
Plant sources are not a good source of vitamin B12.  Not eating
fish ignores that most of the earth is covered by Ocean where
fish are a good source of iodine among other things.  

If ancient man did indeed develop on the Savannahs of Africa, he
did not survive on plant material.  Grass is not something that
the human body can digest.

There are places in eastern Oregon that you can only set up grazing
animals on and no these aren't corn fed animals.

Let's assume that noone eats food from the rivers and the oceans
anymore, how much more food has to be grown on the land?  Like I said
before, growing grain in the Andes anyone?  How about legumes and soy
beans, do they grow everywhere?  What do you replace soy with if it
isn't healthy to consume soy for extended periods of time?

I'm not saying that the human body doesn't need plant based nutrients.
I am just saying that there are things which come from meat that are
needed as well.

How many healthy Seventh Day Adventists are there?  Do they supplement
their diet with vitamins that come from meat based sources?  I think
you'll find that they do.

Manure is a natural fertilizer and a source of hydrogen.  Feed lots can
be equipped with factories that process the manure to produce chemical
slurry that will flow nicely through pipelines or transport on trucks.

Eggs are high in protein, they are a good substitute for soy even on
a short term basis.  There is also genetically modified corn which is
a complete source of protein.

If corn is grown with dead fish and legumes, fertilizer isn't needed.
This is the way that Native Americans grew corn and the way American
farmers should do it, but it isn't catching on.  Of course, grass is
something that cows can eat that humans can't making hay a choice for
cows.

If you eliminate a source of nutrition, you take the risk that there
is an essential nutrient that we don't know about which only comes
from that source of food.  There is the risk, even though the
nutrients that source of food provides can be found in other sources
of food, that it can not be absorbed by the human body.  There are 
water and fat soluble vitamins and minerals, there is some evidence 
that non fat milk is unhealthy because you can't absorb the calcium.
A vegan won't consume any dairy or meat products, will he/she
find the same fats and possibly other chemicals that are necessary
to get what dairy/meat products provide from other sources of food?

I question the value of vegetarianism on four grounds:

1)  Only grazing animals can utilize a significant portion of the 
    earth's land.

2)  The Ocean covers much of the earth with it's bounty of fish.

3)  There is the risk that meat, dairy, and fish products 
    contain essential nutrients and chemicals that allow us 
    to absorb those nutrients which aren't found in plant 
    sources of food.

4)  Soy and other vegetarian sources of plant based protein 
    may be detrimental to human health over the long term.

I think more research is needed to determine the full effects
of various vegetarian regimes.  Over the short term, a veg
diet may indeed have health benefits for some people.  People
are different, one diet does not fit all.

Sorry, I must have blinked - don't remember the discussion, but it 
really doesn't matter - the subject here is Linux, I should think, and I 
personally doubt that one diet or another qualifies.

I think the subject of what electricity you feed your systems is highly relevant.

My Linux servers are so precious I only feed them locally handcrafted winda nd
water generated electricity. Even then I filter it through a UPS device to
present them with the cleanest, most natural electrons.

I finally have some time to look into this issue -- getting a message 
that says I can't move something to the trash bin, but can delete it. 
The specific case is for my local machine's web files. I created a 
directory, www, in the directory srv. I gave my user ownership of www. I 
can create, edit, save, and delete files in /srv/www, but I can't move 
anything in there to the trash.

 From the above recommended reading I find that someone thought it was a 
security problem to allow moving files to trash from a partition not 
owned by the user. The recommended solution is to add an entry in fstab 
that looks like this:

/dev/sda2 /c ntfs defaults, umask=007,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 1

In their case, the partition is ntfs. In my case it's ext3. I don't 
think that matters. What matters more is that I would have to assign 
that uid/gid to a partition that holds too many other important 
directories, like /etc, /bin, and so on.

If I really want to be able to move files to the trash, instead of 
simply deleting them, it seems like the best solution is to create a 
separate partition for /srv, and then assign the uid/gid of 1000 to that 
one.

Did I miss anything important?

Don't be so fast.

I do buy the PGE green power options for 100% of my electricity, and my ISP
(Stephouse) does the same.

And like any sane computing person all of my servers are powered from UPS
units acting as sag/surge/spike filters.

I just normally don't describe it in such baroque terms.

I didn't know Vegetarianism was an issue here O.o

There is a lot of problems with the "American" Diet, but neither are better.
Is a square better then a oval? Is it better to shower at night or the
morning? They both have pros and cons and whatever a person personally feels
is what they do I would be a vegetarian but I am too lazy and might
accidently kill myself from malnutrition. 

Humans are not designed to drink the lactation milk of another species and
we should stop drinking our own after a short time. Are we talking about
what's normal or better?  

Medical studies indicate that rather than preventing the disease, milk may
actually increase women's risk of getting osteoporosis. A Harvard Nurses'
Study of more than 77,000 women ages 34 to 59 found that those who consumed
two or more glasses of milk per day had higher risks of broken hips and arms
than those who drank one glass or less per day.(D. Feskanich et al., "Milk,
Dietary Calcium, and Bone Fractures in Women: A 12-Year Prospective Study,"
American Journal of Public Health, 87 (1997) 992-97.)

Bottom line:
veggies are better if you love animals.
I grew up on a farm and grew organic and non organic and I would never eat
organic veggies.

meat is better for lazy people and hunters :) 
But if you're going to eat meat find out how the your food is treated how
its killed.
I only eat organic meat.


PS: antacids are a good source of calcium ^_^

Just wanted to add my own 2cents Michael and thank you for doing a little
research. 

Sorry for grammar and spelling issues.

Subject: [PLUG] Vegetarianism

The assumption that vegetarianism is better than any other diet is
being defended quite aggressively on here, but there is a problem
with vegetarianism.

The human body is not designed for it long term.

The theory is that going lower on the food chain will increase
the amount of food available for people to eat.  This is assuming
that people can get everything they need from plant sources alone.
Plant sources are not a good source of vitamin B12.  Not eating
fish ignores that most of the earth is covered by Ocean where
fish are a good source of iodine among other things.  

If ancient man did indeed develop on the Savannahs of Africa, he
did not survive on plant material.  Grass is not something that
the human body can digest.

There are places in eastern Oregon that you can only set up grazing
animals on and no these aren't corn fed animals.

Let's assume that noone eats food from the rivers and the oceans
anymore, how much more food has to be grown on the land?  Like I said
before, growing grain in the Andes anyone?  How about legumes and soy
beans, do they grow everywhere?  What do you replace soy with if it
isn't healthy to consume soy for extended periods of time?

I'm not saying that the human body doesn't need plant based nutrients.
I am just saying that there are things which come from meat that are
needed as well.

How many healthy Seventh Day Adventists are there?  Do they supplement
their diet with vitamins that come from meat based sources?  I think
you'll find that they do.

Manure is a natural fertilizer and a source of hydrogen.  Feed lots can
be equipped with factories that process the manure to produce chemical
slurry that will flow nicely through pipelines or transport on trucks.

Eggs are high in protein, they are a good substitute for soy even on
a short term basis.  There is also genetically modified corn which is
a complete source of protein.

If corn is grown with dead fish and legumes, fertilizer isn't needed.
This is the way that Native Americans grew corn and the way American
farmers should do it, but it isn't catching on.  Of course, grass is
something that cows can eat that humans can't making hay a choice for
cows.

If you eliminate a source of nutrition, you take the risk that there
is an essential nutrient that we don't know about which only comes
from that source of food.  There is the risk, even though the
nutrients that source of food provides can be found in other sources
of food, that it can not be absorbed by the human body.  There are 
water and fat soluble vitamins and minerals, there is some evidence 
that non fat milk is unhealthy because you can't absorb the calcium.
A vegan won't consume any dairy or meat products, will he/she
find the same fats and possibly other chemicals that are necessary
to get what dairy/meat products provide from other sources of food?

I question the value of vegetarianism on four grounds:

1)  Only grazing animals can utilize a significant portion of the 
    earth's land.

2)  The Ocean covers much of the earth with it's bounty of fish.

3)  There is the risk that meat, dairy, and fish products 
    contain essential nutrients and chemicals that allow us 
    to absorb those nutrients which aren't found in plant 
    sources of food.

4)  Soy and other vegetarian sources of plant based protein 
    may be detrimental to human health over the long term.

I think more research is needed to determine the full effects
of various vegetarian regimes.  Over the short term, a veg
diet may indeed have health benefits for some people.  People
are different, one diet does not fit all.

I have it sort of working. 

I am using just the cable that I used before, together with an adapter
for headphone/speaker jack to RCA. I plugged it into the Video Sound-in
connectors on the stereo and it works. That is, it works well as long
as the volume on the computer is tweaked properly to avoid breaking up.

Having said that, the volume remains a problem. Audio programs all have
their own volume slider, and then there is the one in Alsamixer. The
volume slider in some programs automatically affects the volume in
Alsamixer. In other programs the slider doesn't work at all. In other
programs the slider works, but seems to be indpendent of Alsamixer. The
result is that every program I use ends up having a different volume.
If I play an MP3 in Rhythmbox I get one volume. If I play it in Amarok
I get a different volume. If I play it in Realplayer I get yet another
volume level.

At this time I am trying to figure out if I can use just one program
for everything. (OK, I can dream, right?) Realplayer 11 plays the
majority of the radio station formats - far more than any other
program. I have almost 50 working classical stations in my Favorites
list and that's more than enough. And it can also play MP3s. And its
volume control is synced to Alsamixer. 

However, there remains a volume problem. In order to keep the computer
sound from breaking up I have to keep the computer volume control at
about 50%. That is fine - the stereo speakers are efficient and the
stereo amplifier has plenty of spare power - so it is not a problem to
crank up the stereo to compensate. But if I decide to use the tuner or
the CD player in the stereo it will blast me out of the house! I hadn't
planned on this, but I guess I can just use the computer for everything.

1. There are audio-specific Linux distros that might help immensely
here. Most of them run out of the Debian repositories, so you can
probably "make do" with Ubuntu. And if you're into the more exotic
stuff, the CCRMA tools run on top of Fedora. Dyne:Bolic and Studio64 are
the two Debian-based ones that I remember. Dyne:Bolic is interesting for
another reason -- the "Free as in freedom" purists recognize it as being
"pure" in that respect. In any event, the audio-specific distros will
feature low-latency kernel patches and lots of tools.

2. I didn't know there still *were* 50 classical radio stations. Of
course, between my CD collection / Zune and KBPS, I pretty much have my
needs met. :)

3. You're the first classical / audiophile I've heard mention MP3s and
serious listening in the same message. :) I use WMA lossless on my (80
GB) Zune and I think I have something like 120 CDs in 60 GB.

Your  best bet is still to set your audio output to "line out" - with a
second best option of controlling the volume coming out of your output. You
can do this by putting an inline volume control between the output port and
the stereo. These are available from Radio Shack for a few dollars. I use
one on my headphones so I can control things more quickly than I can with
software. (my poor, poor sensitive ears!)

Into a triangle? A round hole?

How about into a sphere, or dare I say it.... a slightly larger

I'd love to set it to line out, but I have all but given up on figuring
out how. How many options are there in Alsamixer? Let me see, if I
recall high school algebra the number of permutations involves
factorials or something. I think the number of possibilities is a very
large number. I wouldn't have time left in my lifespan to listen to the
music.

I don't understand the second option. An inline volume control would
have to be an amplifier, since I can't get the signal out of the
computer at a high enough level without distortion. That's the only way
I can think of to make the volume coming out of the stereo speakers the
same whether I am listening to the computer or a radio station over the
air via the tuner in the stereo.

Yes.  It seems like just about every time I update something about the
audio system breaks.  I was forced to reboot my work machine the other
day (it crashed... one of these days I need to find enough down time
to run memtest) and no sounds are coming out anymore.

Any idea what the latest fix is?  (Currently using a mute 8.10 system.)

Interesting to know. Maybe later I will check out some of these things.

There are actually a couple hundred. Of these only half a dozen are
commercial. Some are run by governments, particularly those outside the
US. And a lot are run by universities. Interestingly, over half the
total streaming stations are located in the US.

Using MP3 format I have several hundred CDs that take only ~60 GB, and
I can't tell the difference in the sound. I rip my CDs to WAV with
cdparanoia, then use lame with variable bit rate to encode to MP3. A
typical symphony boils down to about 40-50 MB that way. The VBR option
leaves me with an averate bit rate of about 160.

I have to admit I've never actually listened to "high-quality" classical
MP3s, and I suppose I should. But I did once rip a few Mozart and
Hovhaness CDs in Ogg format, and they sounded fine with headphones.
Shostakovich symphonies, , on the other hand, have way too much dynamic
range for that. :)

I don't tend to have any trouble with sound on ubuntu, but i entirely
scrap their system audio daemons and desktop software and run one of
the most minimal window managers around with no sound daemon, which
works well for me.  no, i don't want to listen to an mp3 and the sound
from a flash video simultaneously, thanks.

on the upside, upgrades never break my setup...

have you tried logging in from the command line (hit control-alt-f1 to
get a text login prompt) and tried a command line audio player to see
if it's a driver thing, or a brokenness in some higher-level software?

Try it sometime. I think you might be surprised. The beauty of VBR is
that lame uses a high bit rate when it needs to in order to preserve
the integrity of the sound. Otherwise it falls back to as little as
128K. And the silent moments are encoded at close to zero. Therefore,
you do not lose dynamic range, yet keep the file size more reasonable. 

Here is the command the way I run it:

lame --vbr-new -B 320 /home/jjj/MP3s/cdda.wav /home/jjj/MP3s/VaughWilliamsSymphony#3APastoralSymphony.mp3

The only annoyance is that lame can't grok spaces in a filename. I
can't get it to work even by escaping it. Oh well. I need to use
Easytag to fix the tags anyway, so I just change the filename in
Easytag at the same time.

I thought your issue was having the volume too high, not too low. That is
the most common issue in the setup you're using.

What technique can I use to allow someone to "log in" to a place on a 
web site that can make a change to a <div> on the site's home page? The 
<div> needs to be turned on and off, and a situation dependent message 
needs to be added.

As a member of a committee, I take care of a web site for our 
organization. Others on the committee help me come up with ideas and I 
get to code them. Our committee was given the task of coming up with a 
way to alert folks to weather related cancellations of meetings. There 
is a "phone tree" to call members, but no way to reach non-member, 
regular attendees. I can easily add a <div> to the site's home page with 
cancellation info, but I need a way to let others on the committee post 
the same info when, like over Christmas week, I had no Internet connection.

I thought about just teaching each of them how to use a simple text 
editor to create the text of the cancellation message, and upload it to 
the site with ftp, but then I realized that I'd have to make sure each 
of them has an ftp client, and I don't know what's available for Mac's. 
Plus, it's a bit complicated (for them) to actually find the right place 
to put the file.

The site is hosted at SpiritOne, and has MySQL and php available. I use 
php for the site so I can take advantage of the concept of include 
files. I haven't used MySQL, yet, but I suppose that's a possibility, 
although it seems like using a sledge hammer to drive a carpet tack.

Just  a thought ... always have paragraph about the meeting - "meeting 
on" "meeting off due to weather" "or other relevant message"
Then (a) changing the paragraph is the only requirement, and (b) folks 
get used to looking for it.

All the home page has is the time and location of the meeting, 
navigation to other pages. The idea is to have something that is not 
normally there, so that when it is there, it stands out. Thanks for the 
thought, though.

How about an iframe or AJAX div?  The URL of the iframe or div can
point to somewhere that is more easily editable, like a plain text
file.  No one would have to go into a PHP file and edit the HTML.

As for placing the text file on the web server...

Using PHP, it is easy to make a file upload control that would allow
you to upload a new text file.  In fact, it is too easy.  Hackers love
these, for they can use them to plant fake eBay sites on your server.
If you go this route, better use that mysql database for housing
authentication information, and write a login page.

A better approach is a webdav folder that allows world read access,
but requires authentication for write access.  This gets the same job
done with far less work from you.

Or use FTP.  I'm guessing that's what you have right now.

Yeah, I recommend you look into using WebDAV.  It shouldn't be too hard
to configure with HTTP Basic auth for the write methods.  I suggest you
alias a directory outside of your web root as the designated
upload/WebDAV folder and make sure that PHP and CGIs are not permitted
to execute in that folder.

>From there, users can edit the file by simply mounting a "web folder" or
some such thing in Windows, or with other platforms' webdav clients.
It should be pretty easy and cross platform.  What's more, it's probably
easier to debug and support if you want to run it securely, such as over
SSL.

As for embedding the content in another page, an iframe or javascripty
thing would probably work fine.  However, if you want to ensure that
users can't supply HTML (and therefore script), you might want to make
the parent page be a PHP one which reads the contents of the file,
encodes it, and then displays it to prevent cross-site scripting.  All
depends on how much you trust your users.  Whatever, you do, *do not*
use a simple PHP include to pull the file in, as this would permit
uploaded files to execute arbitrary code on the server.

If you aren't experienced with PHP, I strongly recommend you do not try
and implement a file upload form.  If you find yourself having to
support content editing by less savvy users on a regular basis, you
might consider setting up a wiki app or something similar.

good luck,
tim

This is the first I've heard of WebDAV. I Googled it to see what it's 
about. It's the right idea, but way more complicated that is needed for 
this application. However, the basic concept sounds right.

Good plan. I think I have that ability with SpiritOne.

That's the part that's probably too complicated for some of my users.

That makes sense.

There are only three of them, and they are trustworthy, as regards 
intentional mischief. I believe only one of them has any web page coding 
experience, so the problem is more one of unintentional mischief.

Since all I need is to have a simple notice, I'm thinking that I will 
create a form on a page for them to type in the text of the message and 
have my script save that message in a text file. I would then have the 
php on the home page test for the presence of that file and, based on it 
being there, include the <div>, with the message text, and its separate 
style sheet. The page I create for them to use to write the message can 
also have a button to erase the file. That page would not be referenced 
from the other pages on the web site, and would require a password to 
operate.

Thanks for the ideas.

That works too.  So long as you don't allow user-supplied values to
influence the name of the file or directory you save it in, and you keep
it stored outside of your web root, it should be pretty hard to shoot
yourself in the foot.

I was having real trouble with this story, since my assumption has been that the 
output of your card was overdriving the input to your stereo, causing the 
distortion.  Now it appears that the distortion is WITHIN your sound card.

Since you are presently using the headphone output (or is it speaker output?), 
and you are driving a relatively high impedance load, the problem could be that 
the card output stage needs a lower impedance load.  One way to try this would 
be to use a set of earphones as the load at the same time you are connected to 
your stereo.  This requires some strange wiring connections, but might be possible.

I have two sets of earphones.  They have a DC resistance of 16 and 32 ohms.  So 
perhaps a dummy resistive load of something in this range would solve the 
problem.  The only difficulty would be arranging the connections--a trip to 
Radio Shack might be required to get the necessary hardware.

Can you post a link to the documents for your sound card?  How about a schematic

Hello,

Well, here's an idea that is a bit less inventive but may be a better
fit for your organization.

You might consider using one of these services, such as
http://www.flashalert.net/ or http://www.cancellations.com/, which are
in the business of alerting people when weather mucks things up. I
couldn't find anything useful on FlashAlert's site, but
cancellations.com is free for business owners. I've used
cancellations.com in the past, when my girlfriend was a teacher in
another state. You would setup the service for your business, and then
instruct your personnel on how to use it. It's all pretty simple. It
also allows people to signup to email and SMS alerts, if they so
choose.

Then, on your website, you can simple insert an iframe with the
cancellations.com page for your organization inside of it. Or, to
maintain consistency on your site, create a simple PHP page that
slurps up the contents of cancellations.com's page and pretties it up.
Using PHP and curl would also allow you to do some sanity checks on
the content before displaying it to your users.

It's a lot less home-brew than the other suggestions, but I think you
might find it meets your needs with significantly less work than
setting up WebDAV, etc.

Does anyone here use Vonage (VOIP)?

For the past month or so we've been having problems with our Vonage phone
service. Someone calls, or we call them, and we can hear them clearly, but
our voices break up to them. I'm hesitant to call Vonage because I think
they'll tell me it's the network.

I know it's not a download issue, becuase we can clearly hear people on the
line. If anything, it would be the upload from our house out to vonage.
SinceI saw that Comcast is playing with their network ports and just
generally screwing with us again, maybe they're messing with the packets to
push people to their own VOIP? Does anyone else use Vonage and have you seen
any problems?

thanks,

It's comcast. I thought that might be the case, which is why I wanted  
to see if anyone else had seen anything like this.

I work for a company that employs a lot of people using IP phones at their
homes. I have noticed a spike in quality complaints recently with people on
Comcast. It's not bad (yet), but it does indicate something is going on. My
current solution is to have them reboot the modem and it seems to clear up
for a while. Some people have started rebooting their cable modem each day
before starting work.

I gave up on Comcast for anything other tha TV. Way Too Many network 
problems and all the tech know to do is check signal levels. I couldn't 
keep VPN connections to much of any where live. Now with FIOS, no such 
problems.

The other issue with FIOS is that they filter port 80 inbound, and other
standard service ports.

Yes, indeed.

I have the very very same problem you describe.
I have been using a Vonage phone on Comcast for a long time and it worked
great until a couple months ago with I started getting complaints about my
voice breaking up.  I have rebooted my cable modem a few times and I think
maybe that helps for a while; but I'm not sure.

Basically, I suspect Comcast is playing games with their customers.
They have certainly played such games in the past.
I was hoping they had improved, but maybe they haven't.

Last nmap scan I did they only were blocking port 80 but that was about a year
ago.

80 is the only one I explicitly remember, so maybe it's the only one
blocked. either way, it's a dealbreaker for me, and their business-level
service is too much more expensive than comcast.

I just checked their website to see if I could get it yet in Overlook.
Not that I totally trust their website, but evidently not.
Unfortunately, they also have no information about their goals. It
would be nice if I could find out when they plan to get to my
neighborhood. Comcast is OK, but I'm not thrilled with them.

Hey, not far from me.

Don't hold your breath.  Verizon has no plans (at least not active
ones) to expand into Qwest territory.  The reason is because there is
competition.  They can't cut the copper and own you as a customer.

Incumbent carriers are the railroad robberbarons of this century.
Your best bet for network freedom today is DSL and your wide choice of
ISP.  Your best bet for tomorrow is publicly-owned fiber
infrastructure (like roads) over which you reach private services.
Incumbent carriers are in a position to choke off competition with
their control of the last mile.  Why people put up with this boggles
my mind.

One does not have to hypothesize malice when indifference will explain
the results.  To make voice over IP work properly, you don't need a
high packet rate, but you do need low delays for guaranteed packet
delivery.  Packets can't be delayed very long or dropped too often -
they must travel through the system with high QOS or quality of service. 

High QOS is expensive in a bursty traffic infrastructure like the
internet and the backbone.  To make sure high QOS packets always
(or even mostly) arrive on time, you must dedicate part of the fixed
channel and switch bandwidth to it, identify high QOS packets, and
route them through this set-aside bandwidth, and limit "Mother's Day"
initiation of connections.  Otherwise, the inevitable and momentary
burst peaks of internet usage will saturate your pipe and the high
QOS packets will arrive too late. 

This provisioning must occur at every point along the way, and must
be paid for in advance, so it is there during "burst times".  ISPs
must purchase high QOS from their carrier, and dedicate and program
switch hardware, and so forth.  I imagine they do this for clients
who pay extra for the arrangement (say, companies that route their
corporate phone and video systems through the net) but ordinary
residential users have not paid for this and won't get it.

I don't use VOIP, but I see the burstiness when I look at Youtube.
Often, the content delivery bar crawls along just ahead of the viewing
bar, and the video stops a few times per minute while more content is
buffered.  Sometimes, I just pause the video near the start and wait
for a bunch to be delivered, and for popular stuff (remember
Dr. Horrible?) I would either use "youtube download" apps or just
pause for a half an hour before watching the 15 minute video.

The internet is oversubscribed.  If all of us took our 5MB download
links and opened the throttle at once, you betcha the result would be
that data would come dripping out for all of us, because the cable
(Comcast) or the switches (Verizon) would saturate.  It costs far too
much to buy enough cable and switch so that everyone can have all the
bandwidth, all the time.  And it wouldn't trickle, it would drip,
because they don't pay attention to individual subscribers three
switches up where the saturation may be occuring.

Comcast especially - they have very definite limits about how much data
they can push through a cable repeater amplifier without frying it, and
when they increased their maximum download rate for consumers, all they
really did was took the same limited bandwidth and increased the
oversubscription ratio - individual users can take a bigger slice of
the limited bandwidth, and saturation occurs much more often.  Third
party services that were designed to tolerate only a low amount of
saturation (like VOIP and realtime streaming video) get hammered.  

And why should these ISPs that offer phone service do anything to fix
that?  As long as their minute-by-minute usage averages out to the
advertised bandwidth, they've met their obligation to their web-surfing
and downloading customers, whereas increasing their millisecond-level
QOS for all internet traffic requires a hefty investment in cable and
switches and payments for backhaul and intertie with other services. 
What they get for that investment would be less phone business.  
If the network never saturates, they are paying too much money for
it, and charging the customers too much to pay for that.

I expect that some ISPs may intentionally drop some tcp packets that
seem to be VOIP related (requiring a delaying retry), but I doubt they
have enough buffering in the system to delay them. 

I can also imagine VOIP protocols that send multiple copies of the same
sound packets, or overlapping packets, at slightly different times,
and that might break up a little less.  However, too much "oversending"
would just add to saturation, if VOIP ever became popular enough to
use a significant of the net.

So we are left with the sad truth that the internet is a packet network
subject to economic limitations affecting packet delay and resend, that
expensive provisions must be made to provide the minimal QOS needed for
VOIP, and if you aren't paying for low latency and high QOS, you will be
disappointed if you are expecting it.  You want a phone?  Pay for phone-
quality service.  You want a telegraph?  The internet is your baby.

My solution for The People's Network?  First, fiber to the home, 
paid for by the consumer, but to first level switches that can connect
to multiple ISPs.  Second, local mirrors and multicast to lower the
burden on top level switches.  Third?  Track down spammers and other
negabit providers and sell them for dog food.  Fourth, real time 
competitive pricing for the packets, with high prices for high QOS and
very low prices for bulk transfers between mirrors.  Fifth, consumer-
owned agent software that navigates the maze of mirrors, providers, and
service levels, helping the bandwidth consumer balance costs and desires. 

The net effect might be that I can have an Ubuntu download in 15 seconds
for $10, 5 minutes for $1, and overnight for $0.01.  I can make a three
minute phone call to the house next door for $0.05, or from the bottom
of the Grand Canyon for $5 .  And my telephone will give me the price
estimate before I make the call (as well as an estimate of how pissed
I will be when I see the weekly bill aggregating all those decisions).  
Behind the scenes is a "super ebay" of bidding and selling which I don't
have to worry about.


My cred?  I designed silicon for Icube Design Systems, and those chips
switched much of the internet in the early 1990's for companies like
Cisco and others.  We sold "complete matrix" switches suitable for
bursty traffic, while the competition sold overly-baroque Banyan
tree and other switches more suitable for fixed channel telephone
switching.  We creamed the competition, until idiot VCs creamed us. 
While I am sure much has changed in a decade, the nature of the
traffic and the behavior of the switching investment (which goes up as
the number of endpoints squared, and down with Moores Law) has not.

   Looks interesting, Eric. I remember that the HP-125 and -150 PCs in the
early 1970s used the UCSD p-code as an interface to a virtual machine. I
don't recall what higher level languages where used, but they all compiled
to p-code.

Originally, or pretty close to originally, it was UCSD-Pascal.  I don't know
if
that's what. the HPs used, but it's what was used at Northwest MicroSystems
in Eugene in the 70's when I was there.  We built an early desktop based on
the 8086,
and put the p-system on top of CPM (hey there, all you old-timers!) and
UCSD-Pascal
development on top of that.

Hello All:
I am working on a project which required writing a driver.
The hardware is an embedded VersaLogic PC-104 system (ISA bus).
The processor is a Pentium M, 1.6 GHz with 512 MB memory.
Operating system is Slackware 12.0 Linux with a 2.6.25.7 kernel compiled 
with the low latency preemptible kernel.

One of the tasks of the system involves operating a rotary knife device 
to size a product moving at 1,000 Ft. / Min. ( 200 In. / Sec). Our 
desired interrupt period for the driver is 62.5 uSec. generated by a 
counter / timer on one of the ISA I/O boards. At times, the driver's 
clock interrupt may not run for >1.2 milliseconds. This doesn't happen 
very often and when it does happen, it has to happen at the wrong time 
to degrade our product accuracy. But as all of you know, if it can 
happen, given enough time, it will happen.

How does this latency compare to what some of you may have experienced? 
Any suggestions for improvement? Incidentally, running without X doesn't 
improve things. The latencytop utility apparently only works for 
user-land processes, so it didn't help.

As an aside, I have written a simulator to test the system using 
real-time Linux. The real-time Linux system is a 1.8 GHz Athlon that is 
happy running a 31.25 uSec period interrupt with ~ 15 uSec. max latency 
- roughly a 80x improvement. I usually use real-time Linux for something 
like this, but this customer didn't like the idea or at least wanted me 
to give a standard Linux a real good try first.

I plan to be at the PLUG meeting Thursday, so if anyone would like to 
discuss this application (or buy beer ;-), that would be fun.
Thanks,
Wayne

tony,

   There you go: your memory is better than mine. I have no recollection of
the HP's OS; it could have been CP/M.

Thanks for the reminder,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] vmware workstation 6
Message-ID: <1231370295.12847.10.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

Why is it unable to switch name servers?  I couldn't figure out why
NAT networking wasn't working, so on a hunch I removed the nameserver
line that pointed to a machine which isn't hosting DNS anymore.  
Thing is, Linux programs on the host do fine if the first nameserver
in /etc/resolv.conf is down, they just move on to the next one.  
I fixed the problem, but being unable to fall through to other name
servers is not very robust.  Is this ReactOS's fault or vmware's?  Is
there a fix to make vmware NAT networking work when the first name
server in /etc/resolv.conf on the host system is down?  This is an
incredibly annoying problem.

             Chamber of Commerce in Corvallis.
             As of May 2008, the Mid Willamette Valley Linux Users
             Group was under reconstruction.  Once this is done
             see http://www.lug.corvallis.or.us/ for details.

       P.S.  The Eugene Linux Users Group meets several times a month.
             See http://www.euglug.org for details.

The sad truth is that a lot of people don't have much choice.

I personally have some choice at my home in Corvallis - and I keep
thinking about moving away from Comcast, but haven't done so yet.

By contrast, I have few and poor options at my farm - which is only a
couple miles from Corvallis city limits.  It isn't served by cable or
DSL.  We tryed a wireless company and they couldn't get a signal from
the house to any of their towers.  What a pain!  And to think that
this is just a stone's throw away from a major tech town.  Think of
the poor people in Eastern Oregon.

Speaking of which, my sister lives in Grass Valley, Oregon.  This is a
"city" of 150 people and they not only don't have cable or DSL, but
they don't have cell phone coverage - or at least it is very poor.  My
sister says that if she drives about a mile out of town to the top of
the nearest hill, she can use her Verizon cell phone.

David,

   Yellow Pine, ID, got its first ever telephone service about 6 years ago.
Before then radio phones were the only means of communications.

Very odd that networking as a whole would stop working due to a DNS failure.
What specific symptoms did you see?

Is ReactOS the host, or the guest, or both?

What are the guest OS' DNS servers set to?

I would change but nobody seems to offer the choice I want, unlimited
bandwidth for free.

Have you looked into Verizon Wireless Broadband. It's about $60/month
for 5GB of data.
Not quite as good as Comcast, but better than dialup.

ReactOS is the guest.  CentOS 5.2 is the host.
The host's fist nameserver line in /etc/resolv.conf
was not a name server at all, but the second and
third line were.  I recently upgraded one of my
servers, that's why it isn't a DNS name server.

Subject: [PLUG] Afters at Jax - getting Barb on the Announce List
Message-ID: <20090108210148.GB6921@gate.kl-ic.com>

I have a bit of a cold, and while I plan to be at the meeting
and afters tonight, SheWhoMustBeObeyed may ground me.

Life would be much simpler for meeting arrangers and for the
owner of Jax, Barb, if she was on the PLUG announcement list. 
If I am there tonight, I will help her sign up.  If I don't
make it, could somebody else with a laptop take charge of
guiding her through the signup page? 

Be sure to explain that she is in control through that page,
as stated at the bottom of every message, and that subject
lines of "unsubscribe" aren't going to work.  Some less-
computer savvy people (which includes about 2% of the Oregon
IEEE, for example) don't understand this.

The PLUG meeting will be in room 325 of the engineering building. Yes, 
our normal meeting room is in use this month since we are meeting on the 
second instead of the first Thursday of the month.  Flyers will be out 
to redirect PLUG folk to the correct room.

What specific symptoms did you see regarding networking from the guest OS

What are the guest OS' DNS servers set to?

At last nights Plug meeting which I attended virtually (thanks Randall!)
John asked about TV cards for Linux. The pchdtv card is specifically
designed for linux users which is still a rare thing to be encouraged and it
seems to be a pretty nice card http://pchdtv.com/ I don't have one, but if I
were buying one right now that looks like a good option.

I ran into this problem with Fedora 9 as the host also.  
The host Linux system works whether I put a nameserver line 
in that exists or not so long as I have one after that line 
that does exist.  It's the guest vm, ReactOS, that doesn't 
go the next name server.  I don't blame ReactOS though, I
think the vmware dns server is to blame.  I think it only
tries to cache the first name server in /etc/resolv.conf.
This is really bad because redundancy becomes impossible.

I was just able to reproduce this on an Ubuntu host with a windows XP
client under VMWare Player v.2.5.0 build-118166 (I *think* this is the
player version that corresponds to the version 6 workstation).

The dns servers I'm using are internal, and I specified the host's
"real" ip as the first dns server (it is not a dns server).  The
Virtual machine can ping things by ip, but not by name.  (Testing with
google.com and 209.85.171.100, which point to the same place, modulo
load balancing).

Windows networking doesn't seem to be working either, but with windows
networking that could be due to anything...

I don't plan on spending any more time to try and fix this, since it's
just not a big deal to me, but it does sure seem like a VMware issue
from this end.

Are you using a machine with CPU virtualization available?  If so, why not
use KVM instead of VMWare?  You can run VMWare guests with KVM.  I just
got it running today; it's sweet.  Since you bridge a tap interface and an
eth interface together using brctl and tunctl, your networking should work
the same as for any linux bridge and tap.

The machine I use VMWare on does not have virtualization, but I also
did not know about KVM.  I'll keep it in mind though.  Right now, "it
ain't broke", and I almost never need the windows VM anyway, so I
don't have much motivation to try to make it better.  I'm more
interested in getting the few apps I occasionally need to work under
linux directly. (Office and Visio)

Subject: [PLUG] Does anyone need a Lenovo X6x-series ultrabase?
Message-ID: <c834ec80901091339x25a04710lde48db6e62dfdd9a@mail.gmail.com>

I (accidentally) ended up with two ultrabases for my x61 tablet, and I
think returning one of them would be a real pain, since I got them
from the lenovo outlet.

Anyhow, I'd like to sell one if anyone could make use of it.  (I'd
like to get $100 -- I think I paid $116 + shipping, new, they run
$150-200.)  Any offer will be considered though :)

Here's the description:

http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/web/LenovoPortal/en_US/catalog.workflow:item.detail?GroupID=38&Code=40Y8116&current-category-id=34851FD360E5473EB9DFEB639312E18E

For what it's worth, I'm going to hook the one I keep up to a Matrox
DualHead2go, and all the assorted desktop "stuff" (keyboard, mouse, so
on.) and run a dual-head setup with a couple LCDs.  it looks like it
will make a fine dock for that purpose.  It's also more portable than
a "real" dock.

Anyway, it's a cool little toy, and in perfect condition, I just don't
need two of 'em.

I am getting a bad file descriptor error when I try to use myWrite.

Hi Michael,

I'm guessing your problem is here:

> ...
>       if ((fpWrite=open(*(argv+2),O_TRUNC|O_CREAT,S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR))!=-1)
> ...

The open() man page states:

  "The argument flags must include one of the following access modes:
   O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, or O_RDWR."

Since you aren't specifying one, it's probably defaulting to read-only
and that's why it would give you that kind of error on write().

I've made this mistake a few times myself... I wish the man page authors
would list these flags along with the rest of them.

HTH,
tim

I'll hazard a guess - this is C, yes?
    close(fpRead); and close(fpWrite); indicate that these are file 
pointers, yes?
    file pointers are declared as
       FILE *fpRead;
       FILE *fpWrite;
Am I anywhere near on track?  Hope this helps
Regards
Fred James

I was looking at man 2 open, thought from there that I could O_TRUNC ||
O_CREAT.  Changing it to O_WRONLY made the copy work.  Strange.

FYI-

Actually FILE data structures and pointers are used in the libc wrappers
to file I/O.  If you want to use the lower-level system calls, which
pretty much go straight to the kernel, you'd use simple integers to keep
track of file descriptors.  Some people prefer this because the libc
interface is quite cumbersome and unsafe in many ways.

cheers,

Well, if you want truncation behavior, I think you should leave that flag
there.  It's just that O_TRUNC doesn't imply O_WRONLY or O_RDWR.  After
all, which would it be, reading-and-writing or just writing?  So I would
suggest using flags:

  O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC

Good luck,
tim

If that wasn't a typo, that's your problem.

Big huge diff between O_TRUNC || O_CREAT and O_TRUNC | O_CREAT.

Sure.  I guess a good file-related example would be fscanf().  If you
try to read in strings or other variable length arguments without
putting an explicit length limiter in there, you're essentially
guaranteeing yourself a buffer overflow.

Another example might be fprintf() which, while typically safer, is
dangerous to include user-supplied values in the format string itself.
For instance, doing something like:
  fprintf(FILE_pointer, user_supplied_string);

Can allow for arbitrary code execution amongst other things.  Of course
this issue isn't limited to fprintf()...  All of the printf() family
exhibit this.

Finally, consider popen() which returns a FILE object pointing to a
stream.  It executes '/bin/sh -c ...' with your input string.  If any
user-supplied values slip into that string, you're in big trouble.  Even
if this wasn't an issue, popen() and it's friend system() have a
horrible interface in that they don't return good information about
whether or not your external process failed.  If you want to pipe data
to your sub process, forget trying to get anything back on it's stdout.

Other examples of poor wrapper function design (temporary file creation,
many bad string functions) move further away from FILE-specific stuff,
but one often finds that using just some of these higher-level
interfaces is hard.  You often have to either just write it yourself at
the low level or give in and use all of libc's bad wrappers.

In the end, these interfaces can be used safely of course, if you know
what you're doing.  A better interface can of course be used unsafely if
you try hard enough.  To distinguish between the two, you should ask the
question: 
  "Is the most obvious way to do a thing also the safe way of doing it?"

Comments welcome,
tim

Ah, that sounds an awful lot like a classic CS homework assignment/ 
job interview question, slightly rephrased (and yes, I've actually  
been asked this very question in job interviews), where one is asked  
to re-write the program 'cat', which can copy files, append files, or  
create files.... all from other files or source inputs.

Source at:
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/tree/src/cat.c

Always a good thing to look at and learn from.

10-4, that post made it through, rubber ducky. By the way, I sort through a
PHP list which gets about 100 posts a day, the plug list with it's wopping
20 a day, and a few python lists that are pretty countless. I love folders
and mail servers that will stuff the list emails in the correct ones. :)

I use Vonage, as well as IP phones for work. We had been using
Comcast, but their network throttling that got put in place last year,
network quality dropped so far it was nearly unusable.
I would call, complain of the speed, and they simply say "ok, try
now", and boom my downloads would go from 40KB/sec back up to
1,500KB/sec... for about 2 days.
I would routinely get flagged for usage and throttled. I work from
home very often, watch Netflix On-Demand, and 3 others use the
internet in this house.

We finally dumped Comcast and went with 12Mbit down, 1Mbit up Qwest
ADSL2+, and surprisingly it's been really great.
I notice some tiny fluctuations here and there in call quality, but
like I said, others here use the connection too, and they could be
uploading to Flickr or watching Youtube...

Hopefully you have an option of another provider besides Comcast, but
yes, their network throttling is real, and very damaging!

Ew, PHP end-user list?

I tried, really, I did.

Then again, PHP-DEV is pretty hard at times, too.

Comcast stopped their throttling and replaced it with a monthly limit
last October. If you download/upload more than 250 GB in a month you
will have an increase in your bill for the month. That's more than
adequate for me, but I still don't have a good feeling about the
company. They were up front about the new cap, but when they used to
throttle torrents they did so surreptitiously without telling anyone. I
don't trust them.

I can't get FiOS where I live or I would consider changing. I would be
interested in what people get with other alternatives, though. When I
go to speedtest.com I get results of about 3 MB/s download and 400 KB
upload. According to my understanding, that's 24 Mbit down and about
2.5 Mbit up. Can DSL offer anything to match?

We've got Verizon DSL and at speedtest.net (.com was just an
advertising site with search engine stuff.) I saw 2872 KB/s down and
724 kb/s up. And there are definitely other users online here using
that connection, but I don't think they're doing anything very
intensive. We've had very good luck with it so far. We switched from
Comcast because their prices go up so much after the first year and
service wasn't great. Verizon is the only DSL carrier out here, so
we're lucky that it's working well for us! :)

Message-ID: <7802bcd40901101305v54ec4384pfae028ce6323d668@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I work with a group of homeschooling parents interested in the use of
Edubuntu (myself included).  Generally we are local to the Portland, Oregon
area but there are members beyond that.  Initially we started working on an
article for a linux e-mag (which we're still working on) but it's kind of
grown from that.

Eons ago, when rocks were soft and dirt was new, I had heard that the school
systems of Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands were exploring the use of
Linux as a completely integrated system between students, teachers, and
parents.  A more recent search digs up no further information, so we're kind
of going it alone at this point.

If you have any links, information, or wish to participate in the yahoo
group directly please either respond to this list or feel free to join us at
www.groups.yahoo.com/homeschoolfoss to help out.  This group is not just
open to Portland, Oregon area homeschoolers, or even homeschoolers.  If you
are comfortable, please post this notice (or one of your writing) in other
groups that you feel might find it useful.

I find it interesting the correlation between the ethos of the Linux
community and the ethos of the Homeschooling community.  Some might
mistakenly believe them to be opposite forces, assuming Linux to be liberal
and Homeschoolers to be opposite (or vice versa), but a closer examination
will show that their core goals are quite similar.

Cheers,
Jimmy Barrett

That sounds roughly the same as I have with Comcast now. Might be worth
it just to get away from Comcast. Unfortunately Verizon's website
service area database seems to be missing my entire zipcode. Not only
is it unable to fin my address, it can't find addresses of neighbors or
even houses on nearby streets. And no humans available on Saturday or
Sunday. Oh well.

There was/is a project (Knoppix / Debian based) called FreeDuc. They

comes up with a European keymapping and there's no easy way to override
that without doing a Knoppix remaster. It does boot, however, at which
point you have an XFCE desktop with all the menus in French.

The one for older students is a bit more usable, although dated. I
checked out Edubuntu, but it is no longer distributed as a single
LiveCD. You have to install a Ubuntu desktop and then an Edubuntu
add-on. openSUSE also has an education add-on; they either just released
it or are in the final release candidate stage of it.

And, of course, there is the collection of software on the OLPC XO,
which is Fedora-based. In short, there is no shortage of open source
educational software.

May I recommend Skolelinux (http://wiki.debian.org/DebianEdu.). The
developers are all out of Norway and there's 150 reference schools
listed.  It's a great community and they welcome input/feedback. The
developers helped me over IRC when I was installing it for a school
computer lab.

The best resource on this topic I've seen is David Wheeler's free book

My wife the doctor spends a lot of time thinking about her patients,
and insufficient time thinking about keys, pagers, cell phones, etc.
There are some medical apps that she would like to run that store
data on a Palm PDA.  In time, I expect there will be medical apps 
that she can run on Android.  However, I also expect she will lose 
the physical devices from time to time.  It would be bad if she had
to buy new apps and configure them each time she did so.  It would
be disasterous if there was patient data on them.  

An alternative is to run the apps on a virtual machine running on
her (well secured and not going anywhere) Linux desktop.  I know
there is an emulator for the Google Android; perhaps there are
decent emulators for the Palm.  I don't think she needs Garnet
(the latest version of the Palm OS) to run the Palm apps she wants. 

Does anybody have experience or informed opinions about these
emulators?  I'm particularly interested in experience with 
running Palm apps in these environments, as there are a lot of
them out there.

There is the Palm OS Emulator [1]. It is open source but requires ROM
images from Palm. Getting the ROM images requires being signed up for
the free developer program. It can only emulate the old 68K devices
(Palm OS 4 and earlier) and won't run Palm OS 5 only programs. There
is a Palm OS Simulator which simulates Palm OS 5 devices but it only
runs on Windows.

There is also the Garnet VM from Access (which bought PalmSource).
There is an older Garnet VM Compatibility Kit [2] which runs on normal
Linux. I think it also requires a developer account to download. They
have also released the Garnet VM for the Nokia internet tablets [3].

Does Denyhosts look for connects or actual login attempts.  Looks like those
are connects without login attempts.  Part of a port scan?

Apparently it only looks for actual login attempts.  I looked back in 
the log file and there never was a login attempt.  This single entry 
appeared this morning:

Jan 12 10:48:21 zinc sshd[2609]: Did not receive identification string 
from 208.110.91.226


Later, around 1:30PM, I started getting a continuous stream of 
disconnect messages:

Jan 12 13:31:36 zinc sshd[4814]: Received disconnect from 
208.110.91.226: 11: Bye Bye
Jan 12 13:31:40 zinc sshd[4818]: Received disconnect from 
208.110.91.226: 11: Bye Bye
Jan 12 13:31:41 zinc sshd[4822]: Received disconnect from 
208.110.91.226: 11: Bye Bye
Jan 12 13:31:42 zinc sshd[4826]: Received disconnect from 
208.110.91.226: 11: Bye Bye
...


Now that I have manually added this address to hosts.deny, I'm still 
getting attempts every 6 seconds:

Jan 12 14:55:06 zinc sshd[11816]: refused connect from 208.110.91.226 
(208.110.91.226)
Jan 12 14:55:13 zinc sshd[11819]: refused connect from 208.110.91.226 
(208.110.91.226)
Jan 12 14:55:19 zinc sshd[11824]: refused connect from 208.110.91.226 
(208.110.91.226)
Jan 12 14:55:27 zinc sshd[11827]: refused connect from 208.110.91.226 
(208.110.91.226)


... Great!  As I was typing this, the offending host moved on from my 
office machine to my home machine.  However in this case there were 
login attempts and denyhosts quickly added the ip to hosts.deny.  It's 
still making attempts despite having the connection refused.  Sigh.

Check out the website running at http://208.110.91.226/ . It's an odd
thing with some sort of hash that's generated with each request. After
you check that out, query google for "Home page wsi01" and you'll find
a couple dozen identical web servers on the same class C, all with
meaningless domain names.

Fishy enough for me :)

i have a lot more faith in 'grep -v "refused connect"' on my log files
than 'grep -v sshd' or whatever the equivalent would be if the
connections weren't refused.  annoying but harmless.  if you're not
into annoyance, block them with firewalling (router or whatever you
use on the host side)?

I don't know but my approach has always been from the opposite side of 
the spectrum, I only use /etc/hosts.allow with an implicit deny for any 
TCP/UDP based inbound connection.  This approach is not always practical 
when dealing with thousands or millions of potential connecting 
hosts/networks but if it is your home system, save yourself all the 
extra work and use /etc/hosts.allow instead

Message-ID: <5f6af5080901121633i2bc67710p68c4933f6c07f2df@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I'm adding a new cat 5 network cable in the upstairs, and wanted to know if
I could just patch 2 cat 5 cables together through a plug and recepticle on
each end. The desktop would go into the final recepticle, whcih would be the
wall outlet. At some point I'll fix it up with a junction box, but wondered
if the above would work as a hack.

thanks,

Dan H.

It should. Although, I've never tried to wire a plug. I'd put 
receptacles on both ends and use factory made patch cables.

If you use a receptacle from a system like Leviton's, it will snap into 
a cover plate when you get around to putting in the box. It doesn't have 
to be a box, either. There are drywall brackets designed for low voltage 
applications that provide the screw holes for cover plates without a box 
in the back.

It's been a few years since I bought any, but Home Depot used to carry 
all the stuff.

I just recently did exactly that.  I ran a cable from the router to a 
Leviton wall plate, wired through the wall to another Leviton wall 
plate, and my son now plugs into the network in his room.  All purchased 
at Home Depot.

Message-ID: <86skno6kie.fsf@blue.stonehenge.com>


I was able to capture this past general meeting via livestreaming
and a recorded MP3 at http://www.talkshoe.com/tc/25652.

Please download the MP3 and give me feedback (either here or private).  Note
that this is the 3rd recording there.  The first two are failures for various
reasons, and I'll probably delete them soon.

If you find the service useful, I'll continue to do so for every meeting
I attend, and try to find an alternate upstream volunteer when I can't
make it.

Livestreaming actually made it possible for a dozen people to "attend" the
meeting, including asking questions, even though they were not physically at
the meeting.  (All you need is a web browser and a sound card.) And of course
podcasting means that the content is permanently available.

Subject: [PLUG] How to do a ssh flood?
Message-ID: <496BF6E4.3090006@cyber-office.net>

Going with the deny hosts thread I reread some info I found on blocking
sshd DoS attacks using iptables.

Before actually deploying them I thought it might be a good idea to test
on my workstation rather than on the servers 35 miles away.  :-/

Problem is: How do I flood my system with ssh connections?

Is there a neat trick to do this just using ssh or do I need a script?
(Quick search didn't pick up anything obvious.  Wrong terms?  Probably!)


Thanks,
Rod

since the daemon and hosts.allow/deny are all triggered by any kind of
connection, you could do something like

netcat -z localhost 22

in a while or for loop from the command line.

Or just use a half decent password?

Thanks Chris.  My first try didn't get the filter to fire.  Back to the

To be fair, some of us are responsible for systems where we are not
the only user and are not privy to all passwords.

I've done this as well, and it works fine. All I can add is that the
materials are cheaper at Fry's, and they have a much better selection.
However, the travel expenses will eat up any savings, depending on
where you're located.

I cannot regularly make the meetings, but I was able to listen to the
podcast the evening of the meeting last week.  I thought it was
fantastic being able to hear discussions, and commentary by both those
who were "live" and those who were online and chatting.

Thanks for taking that on.  The audio sounded fantastic for a single mic.

   My network, too, has been pounded on by badmorticia.com, as well as
several others. They're all rejected because the user names are not in
/etc/hosts.allow.

   Allowing only a limited number of user names to connect via ssh works for
us because there are fewer than a handful of names. For my edification, is
it impractical to maintain /etc/hosts.allow when there are many users on the
network?

   Second question that comes from this discussion is the relative advantages
of hosts.allow and hosts.deny. It would be nice to have someone clarify the
differences for me.

Subject: [PLUG] Need Help of Perl Expert
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0901130953170.22600@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   The last known issue I need to quickly resolve is the inability of
SQL-Ledger to print directly to the printer. I'm running SL-1.8.18,
httpd-2.2.9, and perl-5.8.8. /var/log/httpd/error_log shows no errors;
/var/log/access shows me logging in and (I think) trying to reprint a check.
The ap.pl script allows me access to that module; I've no idea where control
transfers when I click the "print" button. According to ap.pl, warnings and
error should be displayed in the browser. Nothing appears.

   Without any feedback from the application in the form of error messages or
log entries I've no idea where to look to identify the problem.

   Is there someone here with a solid knowledge of perl who's willing to help
me? If so, please contact me off the list.

TIA,

Rich

No, I just only now went through the requests queue and approved these
couple of messages. Most that were older I just dumped. I neglect to

Subject: [PLUG] Trouble with Asus Eee PC...
Message-ID: <1231917592.3039.17.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

It has Xandros Linux on it where the window manager is decidedly 
custom.  I'm starting to get the hang of apt-get and I've gotten 
vlc media player to play a DVD using an external DVD burner I 
picked up today, but there seem to be many more problems to 
solve.  The firefox version on it is 2.0.0.14, which doesn't 
support the media connectivity plugin.  I bought crossover 
linux and installed IE 6, but it installed it in a win98 
bottle which won't support a decent release of windows media 
player.  Crossover is a pain to work with, it has to be 
launched from the command line because of the custom window 
manager's lack of support for custom shortcuts.  I guess 
the system is just plain old and not very upgradable.
I know that the solid state drive is only 20 gigs, but that
should be plenty of room for a more up to date Linux system.

I'm not sure what all the repositories are for debian, but I
seem to have added the standard suspects by adding a records
that points to the osu open source lab site.  I couldn't find
libdvdcss2, so I finally cheated and downloaded it directly
opting to install it with dpkg instead of apt-get.  

I wish I could add a shortcut to vlc media player to the window 
manager.  Uge!  

Anyone else have experience with the Asus Eee 900 running Linux?

I seem to have the standard C and C++ tools installed for 
programming, which surprisingly appear to be fairly current.

How do I control graphical log ins to X so that some people
can't get an X session?  For example:

/home

/home/foo /home/bar /home/goo /home/boo /home/admin

I want to allow admin, foo, and boo to initiate X sessions, but not 
goo or bar.

Obviously, I don't want to allow anyone to log in as a non standard
user, say as nobody, and get an X session.

I also want to disallow shutdown of the server for anyone other
than admin from an X session.

This X server is running CentOS 5.2.

For example:

/home

/home/foo /home/bar /home/admin /home/goo

Where foo, bar, and admin should be allowed to use firefox but
goo should not.

Could you set the different users with proper SELinux privilege labels?

Well, you could add the users you want to be privileged to a "firefox"
group, and then set the permissions on all applicable binaries to
"rwxr-x---" and set those binaries' groups to "firefox".

Or install firefox into a directory with such permissions, and leave
the binaries themselves alone.

I guess the question becomes, how smart are the users?  since i can
download my own copy of firefox and call the binary "vi", i'm not sure
there's any way of actually preventing someone even mildly interested
in using it from doing so.

SELinux or apparmor might be the best method after all, next to not
giving them account, or not giving them write access (or an extremely
tiny disk quota).

Fortunately, this isn't an exercise in defeating determined users.
I'm not very knowledgeable about how selinux works disabling it
because it gets in the way.

Mike,

There is an almost normal KDE installation on the EEE PC.  Open the file 
manager and add locations tool bar.  Then navigate to the /usr/bin 
directory.  Once I got a konsole window up, I was able to link other 
applications from my home directory, /home/user.  I have not figured out 
how to add to the menu/desktop, yet.

I would add a +1 to ditch the tweaked Xandros and put EEEBuntu (Ubuntu) or
EEEDora (Fedora) on it.
Customize to taste, stir, and serve. :)

The biggest upside to leaving Xandros on is that it boots fast.  I
installed EEEBuntu on an SD card but it takes about 4 minutes to get
me to a prompt.  Xandros is usable in about 30 seconds.

Well that is part of the problem I think, Ubuntu is on the SD card, Xandros
is on the internal flash(?) or hdd, which I would imagine has a faster bus
speed than the SD port.
You might try using a faster capable SD card (still limited by the bus
though), but why not replace Xandros on the internal flash with Ubuntu?

It is similar to comparing a LiveCD distro to one installed on the HDD.  The
access time is going to be longer.

I saw someone at the OSCON last year with EEEDora on the Atom powered EEEPC,
he had customized it and got it to boot very quickly, I think it was around
15-20 seconds.

The issue isn't the distro, it is the media it is installed on.

At any rate I have no first hand experience with these netbooks yet but it
is on my "list", though I have tinkered with them a few times.

Certainly it is *part* of the problem, but unlikely to be the whole
problem.  And therefore, to retain faster booting, pending concrete
information to the contrary, I am keeping Xandros on the internal
flash.

A friend picked up a really cool looking Mac from Freegeek
for public use in his cafe.  It's running Ubuntu, but unless we
can find a Flash player for the Power PC architecture and
Ubuntu O.S., he's going to have to shell out for MacOS.

Does anyone on this list have any pointers to a Linux/PPC
Flash player?

Thanks,

I hope this helps, but I've heard of people using *gnash* for the PPC
versions of Linux. Might give that a shot.

I can think of two possibilities:

1. See if gnash compiles on PPC (or has precompiled packages).  I would
   be surprised at this point if it didn't support PPC, but I have been
   surprised before.

2. Try to run the stock i386 flash from Adobe under Qemu.  No, I'm not
   talking about running a full VM.  Qemu can also do single-process
   instruction translation.  I've heard of people running i386 windows
   processes under Wine under Qemu on PPC.  It's insane that it works,
   but apparently it does. YMMV.

Good luck,
tim

I've had better luck with swfdec on my x86 Ubuntu system.  I recommend

Does someone have a copy ? It is no longer on the Oracle Website.

For the curious, I need to connect to a Oracle 7 db, and the the
clients newer the 8i will not work.

Subject: [PLUG] eee pc box
Message-ID: <20090115194548.GA1943@gate.kl-ic.com>

I bought an EEE PC *BOX* for my wife to use with (sigh) Windows XP
and Dragon Naturally Speaking 10.  It arrived a yesterday.  Before
I let it succumb to the nexus of evil, I booted it to an Ubuntu
Live CD on an external USB CDrom drive.  I am currently typing
this in through an xterm on running on that distro, through
ssh to my mail server.

The box is a repackaged version of the N270 Atom hardware that
makes up the EEE PC micronotebook.  It has a 160GB Seagate SATA
drive preinstalled with (gag again) WinXP home.  This was $330
from Amazon (shipped from Sparks NV) and arrived in 2.5 days
(ordered sunday night).  There are also versions of the same
B202 machine that come with something called LinuxEZOS and cost
$300.  

The box is about the size of a hardback novel, has a DVI port with
an add-on HD15 VGA adapter, 4 USB ports, a GBit Ethernet port, an
SD memory card port, some audio ports,  and a N wireless antenna
connector.  It is powered by an external AC adapter that draws 1W
standby, 14 watts running, probably lots more when doing disk access
while computing its little brains out.

It comes with a keyboard and mouse, and with a mounting plate to
attach it to the back of a flatscreen.

One surprising feature is that it has a miniature version of Linux
running from ROM:  Something called Expressgate powered by splashtop
from a place called DeviceVM.  From poweron, one can click icons on
the splash page to launch a stripped down web browser (resembling
firefox), games, and other web-based stuff.  So if you need a
browser 5 seconds from poweron, this is your baby.  The video 
configurations are limited.

What wireless card?  LSPCI shows:
   Network controller: RaLink Unknown device 0781 
for what I presume is the wireless adapter.  On the side of the
box are these device descriptions:
  AzureWave     FCC id
    AW-NE766    VQF-RT2700E
    AW-NE771    PPD-AR5B91

More to learn.  Linux compatability unknown.  If I use the wireless
at all, it will be as an access point - if possible.  If not, I will
turn it off.

What video display?   /var/log/Xorg.0.log shows an Intel 945GME Express
(or possibly a 943/940GML ) chipset.  The drivers from lsmod look like
the /might/ be i915 and intel_agp ... more investigation needed.  I have
a 1400x1050 LCD display that came up as 1024x768.  If I installed it
for real, I'm pretty sure I could match the LCD.  The Splashtop only
offers a choice of 7 resolutions, but the 1440x1050 choice looks OK.
WinXP connects to the LCD at 1400x1050.

Audio?  LSPCI says:
     Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family)  \
            High Definition Audio Controller (rev 02)

I don't know how well that works, I haven't hooked it up.

So, I now reboot back to XP and prepare the speech recognition app.  
his will either not run on the perhaps-slow Atom, or it will only
run under native XP, or it might run under VMWare or VirtualBox. 
I don't think I can run Xen on the Atom, as it appears to lack the
virtualization instructions needed.

Try using 6i. The last company I was at was able to get the 6i client and
drivers from the Oracle website.

By the way, 1992 called and said they want their database back.

It's a server problem on their end. As to the cause of the server
problem, who knows? They could be under heavy load, or they could have
some sort of mail server flaw snagging SMTP sessions into a blocked

Truth Tables and Karnaugh Maps
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnaugh_map) are the primary tools I
always used when working on things like this.

Don't forget that you can split inputs (signals, wires, copy
variables, whatever you want to call them) and you can use True and
False constants to make a function (gate) that takes two inputs only
require 1.

Yeah, this is the same thing I mentioned at the meeting last week.  It
came on my ASUS core i7 motherboard.  At the point it becomes
hackable, it'll become quite interesting.  I'd prefer an xterm and an
ssh session to the browser.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux and MS Windows, the future...
Message-ID: <1232089289.3601.45.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

ReactOS may be based on 1.6 million lines of code, but it still 
seems incredibly small compared to the system it is trying to 
replace.  That isn't saying much though because ReactOS will 
undoubtedly get bigger and possibly much bigger as it stabilizes.

Where is Linux going in the future?  ReactOS developers claim 
that Linux+WINE is not the best solution.  Maybe they are right,
maybe the best solution is to get more vendors to write native
Linux applications.  Speed wise, native applications are better
than anything that has to be run in a virtual or para virtual
environment.  On the other hand, not having to worry about
legacy support because virtualization is available can keep
Linux from bloating badly.  The trouble of setting up older
Linux distributions in virtual environments to support legacy
Linux apps is that most X installations assume you will be
accessing email, etcetera.  Evolution seems to have become
highly integrated into Gnome.  I guess there's a push to be
able to have one's email application etcetera pop up 
automatically, but there's a lot of work to do.  Firefox 
doesn't support plugins as well on Linux as it does in 
Windows.  I rarely ask Firefox to install something 
automatically where I don't have to install manually.  
Linux preinstalled on new computers still seems to be 
fairly rare and the Asus Eee PC I gave my nephew should 
probably be redone with Ubuntu 8.  I'm afraid that the 
video drivers are proprietary though.

My desktop is completely Linux based.  I have a registered copy of
VMware Workstation 6, but I mostly use it to monitor the progress
of the ReactOS project.  For running games, I could have a Windows
virtual machine, but I don't particularly want to go there.

Maybe Microsoft should do something Earth shattering, like distribute
it's own Linux distribution with a native version of Internet Explorer
and other popular programs for free.  Maybe Microsoft should take
notice of the WINE project and offer a commercial product that emulates
WIN32k on top of Linux even better.  Maybe Microsoft and other companies
that develop for Windows should change how drivers are done so that they
will work equally well in Linux as they will in Windows.  If I were
running Microsoft, I'd refocus the company to work on getting an open
source and free version of Windows XP out and I'd change the company's
focus to making Windows applications run on Linux.  I'd say let's slash
the prices, let's get back to writing small programs, let's take the
kitchen sink out of popular applications and see what they can really
do.

What is this Midora or Midori research project that I keep hearing
about?  Supposedly, Microsoft is going to abandon the NT architecture
for something that is designed to work with web based software.  I'm
thinking this will suck for anyone who cares about privacy or
portability, but Microsoft could certainly offer a less bloated OS
if all Microsoft wants to do is support the running of web based apps.

Subject: [PLUG] /dev/ttyUSB1 not created when PDA connected
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0901160846310.8095@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Something broke yesterday afternoon and prevents me from syncing my PDA
with jpilot on the desktop. Everything worked as usual through 2:53pm
yesterday which was the last successful sync. Then it stopped working, with
the jpilot.log showing:

pi_bind error: /dev/ttyUSB1 No such file or directory
Check your serial port and settings
Exiting with status SYNC_ERROR_BIND
Finished.

   The specified port within jpilot used to work as /dev/tts/USB1. That
desn't work and neither does /dev/ttyUSB1.

   Plugging in the USB cable tells HAL there's a new device, and that's
recorded by /var/log/messages:

Jan 16 08:42:50 salmo kernel: usb 2-1: new full speed USB device using
ohci_hcd and address 69
Jan 16 08:42:50 salmo kernel: usb 2-1: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
Jan 16 08:42:50 salmo kernel: visor 2-1:1.0: Handspring Visor / Palm OS

Jan 16 08:42:50 salmo kernel: usb 2-1: Handspring Visor / Palm OS converter
now attached to ttyUSB0
Jan 16 08:42:50 salmo kernel: usb 2-1: Handspring Visor / Palm OS converter
now attached to ttyUSB1

   However, when I look for /dev/ttyUSB1 it's not found. With the above
showing the device connected, I cannot find any /dev/ttyUSB and /dev/tts/
contains only 1, 2, 3, and 4, not ttyUSB1. I think this is the cause of the
problem. Where do I look to learn what broke?

Drew,

   No. /var/log/messages says the PDA is attached to both ttyUSB0 and
ttyUSB1, but /dev has no USB* or ttyUSB*.

   They used to be created as devices when the PDA was plugged in. That's why
I don't understand what happened between just before 3:00pm yesterday when I
last sync'd successfully and less than an hour later when I tried to sync
new information to the PDA and it failed.

Oldest I can find on the Orakel site is 9.x, I have this
old 7 db that I am proposing being coverted to MySQL on

Is the driver statically built into the kernel or is it a module? If
it's a module try rmmod $module and then insmod $module and plug the
device back in and see what happens.

Just tossing out ideas here.

Drew,

   They're modules:

visor                  19596  0 
usbserial              33384  1 visor

   So, I remove the visor module and cannot reload it. Sigh. Guess that's
part of the problem. It exists:

[root at salmo /]# locate visor.ko
/lib/modules/2.6.24.5-smp/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/visor.ko

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 27758 2008-04-30 11:20 visor.ko

   But,

[root at salmo ~]# insmod visor
insmod: can't read 'visor': No such file or directory

   I've no idea, of course, why it stopped working and even less of an idea
how to get it re-installed.

Rich

try modprobe visor instead.

my memory from the dawn of time suggests that before modprobe was a
mature tool, you could insmod without an explicit path to the .o (back
before we had .ko filename endings on modules) file, but that hasn't
worked in quite some time, at least.

i still try it every time and elicit that error message.

Chris,

   That just hangs. I've tried it.

   Ah, thanks for the reminder. Even changing pwd to the actual directory
doesn't work, but specifying the path and file name does.

   So, visor is reloaded but that does not solve the problem.

   I really dislike having something suddenly stop working for no apparent
reason. This falls in that category.

Thanks,

Rich

me too--that's a huge portion of the draw of linux versus
windows--it's software, it should be deterministic!

that said, the visor driver is the flakiest one i use with any
frequency.  i have more than once had to reboot to get it to work
properly.  sigh.

(bit of an aside here...)
If all your legitimate users are allowed to SSH in, what's the point
of specifically allowing users? All other names will be invalid and
login will fail regardless of whether or not they are allowed. If you
create users that have valid shells configured for ftp access or
whatever else, then it becomes something to worry about. I've seen a
lot of people setup SSH allowed-users lists for no good reason. One
good reason would be to allow root to login, but only from certain
IPs. So adding "root at 10.0.0.1". Another good thing to do with this if
you need remote root access is to set "allowrootlogin =
without-password". That somewhat un-intuitively makes it so that root
can login only with authentication mechanisms _other than_ password,
ie - public keys. The net result of those two settings makes it so
that root can only login using a key file from a certain IP. Very
useful, and still secure enough for most purposes.

The number of users doesn't matter so much as the number of IP's they
will be coming from. If you have a known subset of IP's from which all
legitimate access will originate, hosts.allow with an implicit deny
makes sense. If not, it's likely to become a management headache. Or
an "I'm at the pub and they have wifi and my laptop is in the car, but
I can't login and fix this random problem that I just got paged on
here because of my implicit deny rule so I have to go home/to the
office to fix it anyway and now my friday night is totally disrupted
because I didn't really think that through." sort of headache. :D

In a nutshell, IPs in .deny are not allowed to connect, IPs in .allow
are. That is grossly oversimplified though.

The googley-bear has a ton of info on this, as do the man pages. Do a
search for "hosts.deny hosts.allow" and you'll come up with lots
interesting stuff. A "man hosts.deny" or "man hosts.allow" gives
useful stuff too.

   Interesting. I've been using it for a long time without any issues; almost
two years now since I bought the Treo. This is the first trouble I've had
once I learned the time- and sequence-sensitive steps to sync on a USB
connection rather than on a serial connection.

Just missed on that one - tossed my set of Oracle 8i (8.1.7) for Linux 
(Red Hat 6.1, I think) a couple of months back.  However, if all else 
fails (and you probably already know this), the data from the Oracle 7.x 
can be written out to files (flat, CSV, whatever - one per table), and 
then written into a MySQL database (once the tables are created) - that 
would take a bit of scripting, but it is quite all doable.
Hope this helps

Fred James

the time-sensitivity is half the problem, imho--i miss the window
again and again and finally it'll crap out--it doesn't seem to like
being loaded and unloaded a dozen times in 2 minutes.  when it
happens, it litters the kernel log with messages about the failure, so
at least i know when it's time for a reboot (strangely, reloading the
module doesn't seem to help).

Quantin,

   No implicit deny here. But only known usernames are allowe.

   Actually, your answer to the second part of my first question is a better
answer. By specifying ALL: in /etc/hosts.allow there's no need to specify IP
addresses. That would be a major hassle when traveling on business and
connecting from all sorts of strange places -- including the brewpub on
Friday evening. Therefore, the onus for security is on /etc/hosts.deny and
there the default is ALL: unless it's a known username asking to come in.

Thanks,

Maybe unload the module and then plug the device in and see if it will
load using HAL instead of forcing it.

Have you tried restarting the HAL daemon? /etc/rc.d/rc.hald restart ?

Drew,

   Not before now. I have two similar scripts installed:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1242 2006-11-02 10:07 /etc/rc.d/rc.hal*
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  906 2007-06-27 17:48 /etc/rc.d/rc.hald*

So I stopped both (only the first was effective) and restarted the second.
Makes no difference; still cannot find the device /dev/ttyUSB1.

Ugh. I was hoping that might work. Sorry for the non working ideas but
I'm not sitting in front of a machine at the moment which would help
much more. Do you have another usb device you can plug in and see what
happens? Try and see if it's the usb subsystem casuing the problem
instead of HAL or the visor module.

Fred has a point. I would ditch that database. Oracle 10g and 11g is even
available for free for "development" purposes. But in all honesty I would go
with MySQL.

Drew,

   I put a SD chip in the adapter and plugged it in a USB port. When I tried
to mount it the command prompt never returned and the mount process was in
an uninterruptable sleep state. Pulled it out and eventually the process
went away, but I had to close the virtual console and start a new one.

   Looking at the process list I discovered this:

21983 ?        S<     0:00 /sbin/modprobe usb:v090Cp6000d0100dc00dsc00dp00ic08isc06ip50

I cannot recall seeing a process like this before. Might it be related to
the lack of syncing?

Subject: [PLUG] Tbird msg. forwarding problem
Message-ID: <4970F2C6.7090905@dslnorthwest.net>

I have occasionally had difficulty forwarding a message containing pictures.
This has happened again, so I thought I would take this opportunity to try to
figure out what is happening. Using 2.0.0.18.

The message contains text and a photo.  I do NOT have "display attachments
in-line" checked.  I can right click and save the image.  The image location is

mailbox:///home/xxx/.mozilla-thunderbird/is21drpp.default/Mail/Local%20Folders/Inbox?number=135538562&part=1.2&filename=image.jpg

When I simply forward or reply to the message, the picture is gone.  If I chose
"edit as new", the message appears as I received it.  But when I then attempt to
send it or save it, I get a message box:
"Unable to save your message as draft. [Similar on sending attempt.]
"There was an error attaching.  Please check if you have access to the file."

It is clear that I do not understand what is the nature of the message with
embedded pictures but showing no attachments.

What is going on?  What is the best way to handle these messages?

Thanks,
-Denis

I am thinking based on that that the usb subsystem isn't playing based
on what you posted. Can you do a kill -9 on that process and once it's
gone see what happens?

   While I thought that the '-9' option meant the kill command could not be
ignored, it was. Something really broke yesterday afternoon without any
obvious signs.

   It died a natural death a while ago, Drew. That's no longer an issue. I'm
still stuck with no PDA sync.

Subject: [PLUG] /home/user partition question
Message-ID: <4970FF48.7090601@comcast.net>

Common practice is to have a user directory under /home. Many programs 
assume such a thing, and put stuff there. One of the arguments is that 
it makes backups easier. That's good, except that there are things I've 
kept from old installations that I need to integrate into my current 
installation without messing up other things. So, I can simply replace 
my current /home/rsteff with my old /home/rsteff.

Is it practical to consider creating a separate partition for Documents? 
Or are there programs out there that will want to put installation 
specific things into /home/rsteff/Documents?

If this is practical, then I could consider Documents as the place that 
wouldn't change from distro to distro, should I decide to try loading 
different distros on the machine.

A contrarian suggestion: Have you considered the possibility that the
problem is in the PDA and
not in the desktop? (e.g, Are your headlights on?...Is it plugged in?...)

My bad Rich mus have missed it in the string that it had died off. I
don't see mention of a reboot but that's all I have left to offer for
an idea :(

I certainly hope not. User home directories ought to be determined via 
the getpwent() routines, $HOME, or their moral equivalent. Assuming 
/home/$USER is a recipe for a major disaster. Developers doing such a 
thing ought to be banished!

Other than Mac OS X, I've never seen an auto-created $HOME/Documents.

Nor have I seen Linux applications that assume the existence of 
~/Documents.

But when you say "separate partition," are saying that you want to 
hard-mount a block device as ~rsteff/Documents?

That doesn't sound like a good idea.

A separate partition for stuff that you're going to carry through 
various upgrades is a good idea, but I wouldn't *mount* it under your 
home directory. I'd mount it as, say, /opt/Documents and then symlink 
to it from your home directory.

Does that make sense?

More--> I found that (on this message, anyway), that changing the view to "view 
message body as simple HTML",
then "edit as new" worked.  It seems that the original message has some 
non-conforming HTML in it.  Likely it
has nothing to do with "access".

Tony,

   If the problem was at the PDA end of the wire then /var/log/messages would
not report that HAL found a Handspring Visor/Palm device connected on
ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB1. I'm seeing the errors logged by jpilot.

   In a little while (I've a couple of phone calls to make first), I'll try
syncing directly with pilot-link. Should have done this first.

   Stay tuned ... details at 4:30.

wondering if the USB modules are just not wanting to play nice on a Sunny
Friday.

   Guess folks cut out early today.

   The problem is apparently with pilot-xfer:

[rshepard at salmo ~/.jpilot]$ pilot-xfer -p /dev/ttyUSB1 -s .
    Unable to bind to port: /dev/ttyUSB1
    Please use --help for more information

   Perhaps there's a software equivalent of Imodium?

   I gotta' contact David on this.

   Could be. This started yesterday late afternoon. The PDA's log shows the
last successful sync 15 Jan 2009 at 2:53pm. Go figure.

   It might be a udev issue, or something else. But all I was doing yesterday
afternoon was using the computer as the tool it is, not futzing with it.
Merde! Sigh.

Thanks,

Rich

I was having some issues with my sansa player not long ago and the fix to get 
it recognized was unloading the ehci_hcd module. I don't know if it will 
help, but it's worth a shot.

   Thanks, Chris.

   I posted a message to the pilot-link-general list and I'll see if David or
someone else has ideas.

   Once I get this working again I'll be sure to post the solution here for
posterity.

Agreed!

Ubuntu 8.10 auto-creates a whole slew of directories, including
~/Documents (If I remember correctly: ~/Documents, ~/Music,
~/Pictures, ~/Desktop, ~/Public and ~/Videos).

I don't know what makes use of those locations -- they may just be
there to encourage that organization, but I have a sinking suspicion
that something does... when I find out what, it'll get a quick trip to
the bit bucket.

Can you elaborate on why this is preferable to mounting something like
that in $HOME?

Thanks!

pilot-xfer is EXTREMELY finicky w/usb devices.  it's what i use, but
if your timing isn't right (down to the split-second) on trying to
sync after you plugin and the device is recognized, it won't work and
that is the error message it will give.  (note, this is only a problem
with the usb treo/visor products--i used it for 8 years with a serial
palm and it was rock solid and there was no timing issue).

i wouldn't judge the pilot-xfer software to be the cause of your
current problem, since it's what's used udner the hood of jpilot and
apparently jpilot is better at handling the timing somehow (how, is
beyond me, since i always felt like it was a kernel<->pilot-xfer
problem, and jpilot's not in the middle of that but rather on top of
the pilot-xfer end)

i really think a reboot might be in order.  i hate to suggest it, but
that's my last input on this one.  good luck!

   Yup. Not only that, but the sequence is reversed from that of the serial
connections.

   I count 4-5 seconds and that works. Until it suddenly quits, of course.

   That's what threw me when I moved from a plain Palm PDA and the Kyocera
Phone/PDA to the Treo.

   I really dislike rebooting my server/workstation because so much needs to
be manually turned back on ... despite being in /etc/rc.d/rc.local. However,
tomorrow I'm going to upgrade from 12.1 to 12.2, and that means rebooting to
load the new kernel.

   Well, that really borked the system. Now it does not react when I plug in
the PDA, and that module is not found using find or locate. Sigh. Guess this
all waits for the distribution upgrade and a reboot.

I installed Ubuntu onto another drive, and configured it.  The 
display still came up at 1024x768.  I found the problem - the
chipset and software think there are two screens, with the second
screen defaulting to 1024x768.  Ubuntu as installed clones the
screens, hence locking them both to the smaller resolution.  

In  System -> Preferences -> Screen Resolution  uncheck "Clone
Screen" and then select the (now separate) laptop window and
set the resolution to "off".  I found the latter necessary to
keep the somewhat wonky driver from occasionally rendering an 
extra and enlarged version of some windows onto the desktop.

There may be other bugs awaiting me in Ubuntu - when I bring the 
eee pc box to the Clinic on Sunday, more experienced Ubuntu users
( Ubusers?  Ubunnies? ) can look for more.

It is probably built statically into the kernel Rich so you'd have to
reboot ...... Upgrading is better then admitting you had to reboot
like a windows box heh. Have fun with the upgrade btw, pretty
painless.

Message-ID: <20090117023318.GA9677@gate.kl-ic.com>

As part of my experimentation with the eee pc box, I've been
swapping around SATA laptop drives.   The Tigard Office Depot
(and probably their other stores) has some Seagate 250GB SATA 
notebook drives ( ST90250N1A1AS ) for $69.99 , which is a pretty
good price for that capacity.  I have 3 of them;  I don't know
how well these will hold up, but they have five year warranties 
and Seagate is very good about quickly replacing broken drives.

These show up at $89.99 online - Tigard may have a pricing
mistake.  Lucky us!

This topic is important for utilizing hardware effectively. You can do everything with NORs or NANDs.

Recent Fedora does this also; it's the freedesktop.org XDG user directory spec:

Drew,

   Slackware upgrades within a major version have been absolutely painless.
So were the upgrades from 8.x to 9.x to 10.x. Major changes in 11.0 and 12.0
made those a long drawn-out affair: at least a half-day. The 12.0 to 12.1
was quick and easy so I expect the 12.1 to 12.2 to be the same way. Perhaps
Pat has settled back down now and 13.0 will also be quick and easy.

Carpe weekend,

Rich

1TB laptop drives???
Or do you mean desktop or external?

In any case that isn't a bad deal, but he was talking about laptop form
factor (2.5").

Message-ID: <20090116215104.7ple7ef6ogk0goss@web.robinson-west.com>

I have vmware player running Windows 2000 PRO on top of Fedora 9.  I have
Samba 3 running in work group mode and my work group is simply called home.
Strangely enough, I can access a real Windows 2000 box from the virtual one
that is on the same network media as the host system, but that real 2000
system can't access the virtual one.  I can see the virtual one though from
the real one, which is so strange.  I get some kind of path error problem
when I try to click on the virtual machine from the real one in  
network neighborhood.  Interestingly, I can ping back and forth.  The  
gateways in
my network route packets to the host system of the virtual machine just
fine and I can ping just fine from both the virtual machine to the real
one and vice versa.  I don't know how netbios discovers the path between
two machines, but I get the impression that I might need to propagate
the broadcast somehow.

Can a windows workgroup stretch across two network segments?  Namely, the
virtual network on the vmware host and the real one that the host and real
2000 system are on?

Sorry this is so confusing, but it is hard to describe what I'm doing.

I just bought a 500 GB 2.5" drive. I can't find the receipt, but I
think it was about $110-120.

Wayne,

Since I never saw a "real" response come across the list, I happened to 
see this advert from TI that might help you in your project:

http://focus.ti.com/pr/docs/preldetail.tsp?sectionId=594&prelId=sc08165
"Helping designers bring 32-bit real-time control to cost sensitive 
applications, Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE: TXN) today 
announced two new USB-based tools for Piccolo? 32-bit TMS320F2802x 
microcontrollers (MCU)

...

The $79 Piccolo Experimenter's Kit offers the next step in development 
by allowing designers to prototype and develop full Piccolo MCU-based 
projects quickly and easily. The first F2802x Piccolo MCUs, 
TMX320F28027PTA and TMX320F28023DAA, are available for sampling and

Try specifying the IP address, and verify that you can reach ports 139 and
445 on the virtual 2k instance.

What do you mean by segments? Do you have vmware set up in NAT mode? If so,
it won't work, at least not well. If you set it up in bridged mode, it will
likely work better.

That is quite a few model numbers, but not all of them.  You can
see the list of vulnerable Seagate SATA drives at:

http://seagate.custkb.com/seagate/crm/selfservice/search.jsp?DocId=207931

There are no notebook drives (ST9xxx ) or PATA drives (no trailing S)
on the list.  The good news is that Seagate is very good about 
upporting drives under their 5 year warranty.  The bad news is
that the data may be unrecoverable on a bricked drive. 

Do your backups!

That's the going rate for top-drawer drives at places like newegg
(though they've gone up $10 there since they came out!)  Places like
Office Depot always seem about six months behind on prices for items
whose prices tend to fall rapidly.

Message-ID: <bfc61080901171419p5e49737ar6af66cb8de58a082@mail.gmail.com>

Comcast's Jan 14 transition to digital-only on the channels below 71
in my area just rendered 2 series 1 tivos useless. I've got free DTA
tuner boxes from comcast for manual channel changing, but I've long
since lost the Tivo IR senders, but a few web searches indicate series
1 can't send DTA-compatible IR signals anyway, and not thrilled with
the high error rate with tivos trying to blindly switch channels this
way.

Now I can either spend $500 initial cost plus $14/mo forever (cable
box rental and higher tivo fees) to get slightly newer Tivos that
support a serial connection to the tuner box for reliable channel
changing, or I can 'vote with my feet' and save $1000/yr by cutting
cable TV and going to internet video and maybe over-the-air solutions.

I was thinking mythtv + hulu (+torrent?)  hacks.

Inspired by
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvQNEgEBFYM
http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/MythStreams

Anyone have experience with this kind of usage, or found some other
way to 'cut the cable' and still have the loose equiv of basic cable?

Thinking outside the box (get it??):

I'd recommend just cutting the cord and walking away.  It is 98.5%
time-wasting crap anyway.  Do something useful with your free time
instead, something that makes you smarter instead of dumber, healthier
instead of sicker, and/or that increases the aggregate goodness in the
world.

Well, the 139, 445, 137, and 138 hunch was right.  I had to turn on WINS
manually, since I don't know how to specify it via dhcp.  I am running
the VM in nat mode, but it's working just fine.  As far as supporting
IPX/SPX, bridged would probably be better.  I'd prefer a way to get
IPX/SPX to work when the vm is in nat mode.

Anyways, I have basically resolved the issue.

   After a long session, Kurt discovered the solution. Both
/etc/cups/client.conf and each user's environment need to define
CUPS_SERVER, and both hostnames must be the same.

   I had /etc/cups/client.conf looking at host.domain.tld and ~/.bash_profile
exporting the environment variable as localhost. Same machine, different
names. The only application that noticed the difference and was bothered by
it was SQL-Ledger. Go figure.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux and Freedos...
Message-ID: <1232239028.7610.51.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

Linux and Freedos support a web browser called Arachne.  I don't like
Arachne because it has built in pop3 support. I use imap on my network.
Arachne lacks built in filtering.  I also dislike Arachne due to the
fact that it is woefully behind in supporting html and php based web
pages.  Try to access a horde webmail imp site with Arachne, it is
almost as bad as lynx.

Freedos is nearing a 1.1 release.  I've suggested on the freedos 
list that this is a good time to think about the purpose of 
freedos.  I for one am certain that some people who use dos use 
it thinking that it can't browse the web.  Dos in general is the 
most susceptible to viruses and other malware as far as OS'es go, 
or am I wrong?

I've been disappointed in both Linux and Freedos for poor support
of Netware IPX/SPX networking.  MARS netware emulator seems to be
a dead project.  People say, use samba and IP based networking.
That is great, unless you want to keep your network from accessing
the Internet.  IPX/SPX networks without an IP to IPX gateway cannot
go online.  For dos, this would make a lot of sense.  Because dhcp
to my knowledge doesn't have a reasonable way to support different
network configurations based on the OS of the client, IP based
networking where I want to avoid Internet connectivity is a pain.

I've pushed on the freedos list for revival of the MARS netware
emulator, but I'll probably fail to get much traction.

There's no telling when Freedos 1.1 will come out let alone how
much of an improvement it will be over Freedos 1.0.

As far as software goes, what can be done in Freedos that can't
be done in Linux?  I'd like to host an update site on my Linux
server for Freedos, but I don't know that there will be 
instructions on how to do that.

Netware style IPX/SPX networking under Linux seems dead.

Why is the doszilla project dead?  If firefox were dos
compatible, that wouldn't be bad because firefox has an
effective filtering plugin.

I agree in principle, but I'm actually asking in proxy for my elderly
parents who have a fixed income and low adaptability to changing
circumstances.

Given the totality of circumstances, my judgement is that if I can
make something easy to use and save them $1000/yr, that's a Good
Thing.

Though it claims that Seagate has not acknowledged the problem,
which is not true:

http://seagate.custkb.com/seagate/crm/selfservice/search.jsp?DocId=207931

No date on the Seagate page, which I found today, so perhaps the
tech-news page is merely a little out of date.   Always remember
the two rules of data storage:

1) Shit happens.
  (in Thailand, where the factory is, the phrase is "My Pen Ry")

2) If you don't have two copies, you will end up with zero copies.

The interesting thing will be whether Seagate handles the repairs
and replacements as well as they have in the past.  Fixing this
could suck a lot of cash out of the company during a time when
sales are probably low.  If anyone has good or bad Seagate customer
service experiences to share, I would be interested in hearing
them - if they do well now, they will likely do well in lesser
future crises.  Hint:  don't expect them to recover your data 
from a bricked drive, just a replacement.

It works fine with the computer speakers, but I can't get it to send

I've tried several how-tos, but so far no luck. Before I upgraded from
Hardy to Intrepid the sound system sent sound to them fine. But
something broke in the upgrade to Intrepid. 

Any suggestions welcome.

Novell 7 was all IP based and IPX/SPX tunneling was the default method
of using IPX when it was needed to go across a WAN.

The kernel still has the IPX protocol in the networking stack.
The docs in "make config"  references IPX-HOWTO from http://www.tlpd.org
/docs.html#howto
It also mentions a different project called lwared available from
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/daemons/

You might want to check out the SUSE distros as they are being supported
by Novell now.

Well, a quick google and a HOWTO that talks about kernel 1.2.13.  
It says that lwared is unstable.  Whether or not that is true 
anymore is hard to say.  These HOWTO's really need to be brought 
up to date.  I guess I should pop over to http://www.tldp.org/ 
and see if the HOWTO there is any different.  

I'm beginning to think that I'd be better off coming up with 
a dhcp trick to slip my dos computers onto a different network.  
I find I can install Netware server 4.7 student edition to a 
MS DOS 5 system running under vmware, but getting nic drivers 
for it is another story.  Why won't vmware let you choose what 
network card to emulate?

Just popped over to http://www.tldp.org/ and checked the HOWTO's.  
The IPX HOWTO hasn't been updated since 1998.  I guess there 
isn't much interest in IPX networking.

There's still the problem of coming up with IPX packet drivers
for my built in Intel nic.  I was lucky to happen upon a beta
quality TCP/IP dos packet driver distributed by Intel.  When 
I try to grab Netware drivers that match the vmware nic which
are supposed to work in dos, I get a windows executable.

I don't trust Novell, if I recall Novell tried to offer insurance
to people who run Linux claiming that Linux infringes on Microsoft's
and it's own intellectual property or some other such rubbish.

I guess I'm stuck manually configuring a TCP/IP based network
and isolating it.

Hi Noj,

I currently use mythtv with no cable or fios or anything of the sort.  I
wanted to slowly transition to DTV in a cheap way, so I dropped the
service and used a coupon to buy a converter box.  I also bought an IR
blaster: 
  http://iguanaworks.net/products.psp

which works pretty well.  It's been slightly buggy here and there, but
they're good with supporting it and it's focused on use under Linux.
You can train it to learn just about any remote control on the receive
side, and then use that same configuration in lirc to send signals on to
converter boxes, cable boxes, etc.

Anyway, this was a transition step for me to make sure the IR blaster
would work without blowing money on cable.  If I feel it's worth it, I
might get some kind of basic digital cable or fios later and use the
blaster to change channels on those boxes.  However, for now the digital
broadcast channels + netflix are keeping us happy.

As for the online video stuff you mentioned, I have no experience with
it.  

Also beware of your converter boxes... many of the companies
manufacturing these are just in existence to make a quick buck off of
the government coupon program and crank out really crappy hardware with
little support.  I bought an Apex Digital box because it was featureful
and reasonably priced, but it died after a few months and their support
is horrendous.  If it's for your parents, consider buying an extra
converter box as a backup or something.

Good luck,
tim

You can always have dhcp give out addresses that are un-routeable to
the internet.
Like your network is 192.168.0.1 give out 192.168.16.x for your dhcp
devices without
a gateway address.

Message-ID: <497374E6.705@fredjame.cnc.net>

All
I am scratching my head over this ... nothing I have read/googled makes
any lights go on so far ... below is a partial listing of my
/var/log/messages after a restart this morning, with particular note of
the second line from the top, and lines 6 through 3 from the bottom -
all pointing to "/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket".  The lone line above
the listing is the result of "ls /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket".  To
my admittedly limited knowledge, the system is and has been running fine
- but as I said, what do I know?

The only problem the box is exhibiting that I know of is an
intermittent, random, sort of raspy sound that I associate with a fan
getting ready to bum out - only I have not been able to pinpoint the
origin of the noise even with a listening tube.

Any insights (on either or both)?

Thank you in advance for any help you may be able to offer

There are no U.S. based IPTV providers(well very few and not in our area) which
makes cutting the cable harder.
If you can survive with just Local then the switch is a little easier.
 From what
I read earlier then this is not the case.

Satellite providers have a lower entry cost that may get you what you need.

Sometimes, when the host is running Linux, I want it on the routeable
network.  How do I program dhcp to do something different based on
which OS is running???  This is one of the reasons why I've been
looking into IPX/SPX.  Another reason to look into IPX/SPX is the

I could only see that being a problem if you are "borrowing" a lot of
material from the net to use locally with MythTV, if you are streaming
programs, as discussed, via Hulu it use that much BW.

There was an interesting Slashdot discussion a few days ago about the
Seagate problem.  My take-away from it was:

1) All hard-drive manufacturers periodically go through rough patches,
so just because people have had good/bad experiences with
Seagate/WD/IBM/etc. doesn't mean others should buy/avoid these brands.

2) Whenever possible, buy drives from different manufactures at
different times.  Problem drives tend to come in batches, so avoid
buying drives in batches.  This lessens the chance you'll end up with
a bunch of problems all at once.

3) Maxtor sucks. :-)

Probably nothing people around here didn't already know, but it was
instructive for me.

I believe, except perhaps for the ~/Public folder, that the
organization you're seeing is just Ubuntu devs trying to be helpful.
The default audio player on Ubuntu, Rhythmbox, is pre-configured to
look for audio files in ~/Music, so that if you copy audio files
there, Rhythmbox will find them the first time (and all subsequent
times) you launch it.  Of course, you can put your audio files
anywhere, open Rhythmbox and configure it to look anywhere you want.
Having Rhythmbox set up to look in ~/Music and having an auto-created
folder there is just supposed to make it easier for Ubuntu newbies to
get up and running quickly.

The GNOME screensaver will only do a slideshow of images in
~/Pictures, if you choose the "Pictures folder" option.  At least,
there's no way to change it in the GUI -- there may be a gconf way to
change where it looks for images; I've never explored that.  You can
point Xscreensaver to look in any folder from the GUI configuration,
but I'm not sure if you can make it look in multiple folders.

As for ~/Documents, I can imagine the first post-install moment of
confusion many Windows users new to *nix experience is wondering where
"My Documents" are.  Now they know.

I would love to know that too.

You have the old configuration file laying around anywhere?  You might

Message-ID: <18803.39815.201782.509635@sphinktoo.pippiandcarlos.com>

I have a computer with a VIA KT600 motherboard.  Just purchased a new
SATA2 hard drive, half hoping that SATA2 would be backward compatible
with SATA1.  Turns out it is not.  So I am looking for a cheap but
adequate SATA2 controller card to hold me over until I can replace the
motherboard/CPU/memory with something more modern.

Is there an especially good choice for a card that you would
recommend?  Using the vanilla 2.6.27.10 kernel at the moment on an x86
architecture.

SATA2 Controllers are mostly PCI-E, I'm assuming from your Chipset your
board doesn't have PCI-E, I found the SIIG SATA II-150 PCI which is
relatively inexpensive compared to others. Your transfer rates will be
limited by using PCI versus PCI-E but like you said it's a temporary
solution right?

Client ID can be used to determine IP address, Linux and Dos would
give different
ID in the request.

Can you give an example isc dhcp 3 config file that 
uses the client id?  How do I assign IP addresses 
based off of this?

What you are looking for in the dhcpd documentation is class with match
if on dhcp-client-identifier.

http://www.daemon-systems.org/man/dhcpd.conf.5.html

http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/adrian.white/docs/pxe/ch04.html


This is a forum link below but it has config file that determines if
it is windows
or linux which is close to what you want (I think).

PLUG Advanced Topics Meeting
January 21st, 2008  7pm

Codeless GUI Programming
  A Declarative Syntax Layer for Desktop Graphical User Interfaces

This will be the world premiere of a game-changing advancement in the 
development of desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs).  FreeTUIT 
removes the verbosity, tedium, and confusion from GUI development and 
provides a unified syntax for widget layout and configuration which 
supports good software design practice without getting in the way of 
rapid application development.

FreeTUIT is a syntax and runtime for concisely declaring the layout and 
configuration of GUI widgets (such as forms, toolbars, buttons, and 
dialogs).  The freetuit interpreter drives a unified object layer which 
is accessible from event callbacks.  This takes you from a blank page 
to a static demo of the layout with zero setup and allows desktop 
applications to be developed and deployed faster than web applications 
by simply removing the HTML, CSS, XML, HTTP, Javascript, Database, 
Network, and User Agent components.

Jax is next to the 2nd Ave Max stop.

My guess is that Paul suggested it simply because that's sort of the
standard convention for doing that sort of thing. It's the "right" way
to do it. If at some point you decided you wanted to do something else
with that space, having it mounted directly in /home/$user would make
accommodating that other use much uglier. So, putting it in /opt,
/mnt, /media, etc and then symlinking makes it a little more flexible.
That's really the only technical advantage I can imagine. However,
since that kind of setup is the convention, following the convention
makes things for discoverable and sensible to someone else who might
be using the machine.

Now, all that said, on a personal machine where you are both the only
regular user and the admin, it doesn't really matter. All of that
convention came about from managing multi-user systems with multiple
admins. On your box, do whatever makes you happy and makes sense to
you.

Myself, I tend to do Paul suggested simply because it is my habit, and
as a result, it makes sense to me.

True, it is a personal machine with me as the only user and 
administrator. However, one of the reasons for using Linux at home is to 
learn "the right way" to do things, understanding, of course, that 
sometimes there is more than one "right way."

Thanks for your explanation.

I currently have two drives (60GB & 160GB) organized into the following 
partitions:

Device      Size   Filesystem   Mount Point
-------     ----   ----------   -------------------
sda1                swap
sda2         21     ext3         /
sda3         36     ext3         /home
    
sdb1         64     ext3         /home/rsteff/music
sdb2         42     ext3         /home/rsteff/photos
sdb3         21     ext3         /home/rsteff/backups
sdb4         31     ext3         /home/rsteff/spare

    
If I understand correctly, the "right way" is to mount sdb1-4 as 
/opt/music, /opt/photos, /opt/backups, and /opt/spare. (I would change 
spare to Documents.) Then, in /home/rsteff, create symlinks to point to 
each of them.

I find /opt to typically be for software, and maybe documentation. I would
mount them under /mnt. I usually reserve /media for thumb drives and
external hard drives (things like that).

i see a few benefits aside from "it's tradition", but they may not be
relevant to your usage patterns:

1) i've run into a problem with relative-paths in mainly mp3
playlists.  works great on linux, works not so great when exported for
use on windows via samba.  i think it makes more sense to make a
static dir like /opt (i choose /spoo/mp3 for this application) that
works the same as a windows path (winamp at least is smart enough to
trade \ for / in paths, if the path is otherwise the same).

2) i often wonder "what is using up all my space in this directory?"
and run du -sk * to find out.  oops, i caught another partition in my
output if it's mounted somewhere unexpected like /home or /home/fool.

3) i am much more likely to type rm -rf ~/a* then i am to type rm -rf
/<anything>.

4) i occasionally share my files or allow other user login to the
fileserver to browse.  it's useful to be able to point people
somewhere outside of my homedir, which has 15 years worth of crap in
it, with which i am quite comfortable, but which makes navigating it
for those who don't share my brain quite difficult.

5) i have two user accounts on most of my machines--one for my typical
barebones setup (yay mouseless computing with ratpoison(1)) and
another that fires up whatever desktop environment the distro ships
with.  they necessarily have different homedirs (same uid, though) so
that they don't share config files.  getting used to ~/asdf in one and
/home/fool/asdf in the other is annoying.

there are workarounds for every one of those things, i know.  but hey,
why bother when i get the benefits for free just by mounting it
somewhere else?

I think using /opt is discouraged by the fhs - or at least it is spec'd 
as 'add-on application packages', but then /mnt is supposed to be "a 
temporarily mounted filesystem".  And of course, the fhs doesn't 
concern itself with user data so much as 'application data'.

I've taken to mounting disks which act as "a place where I keep $stuff" 
as /disks/$stuff and then loop mounting into /srv/$stuff.  Similarly, 
any "just a big disk" is e.g. /disks/space.

From there, you can bind mount the whole disk or a subdirectory 
to /srv/nfs/music and so on.

Symlinks can sometimes be problematic, but might be the best way to go 
for making paths appear in your home directory.

Subject: [PLUG] SSH session hangs over WiMAX
Message-ID: <4974da7d.uXKhKGFRXonTaT2/%jgw@tx0.org>

(3rd attempt at posting this; guess mailman is picky)

I recently opted to try Clear.com's WiMAX Home service [1] as a replacement
for DSL.  The Home service consists of a Motorola CPEi150 [2] bridge(?)
device that connects the Clear's WiMAX transmitter and does NAT and DHCP
and some basic firewalling.  It's a dynamically assigned IP unless one
shells out an extra $10/month for a static IP.

Anyways, while basic web surfing seems to work fine, ssh sessions are
either disconnecting or just hanging frequently, usually within 5-10
minutes.  Doesn't seem to matter if I'm actively typing or just running
something like top(1).  I tried adding ServerAliveInterval <sec> with
various time intervals (180, 240, 300) to my ssh_config file without much
improvement.  It's pretty annoying and I'm almost to the point of boxing
it up.  Anyone have any insight as to what might be the problem?  An online
chat with Clear's support service wasn't particularly enlightening; the
tech thought perhaps packet splitting might be the cause.  My NIC is
currently set at MTU=1500 - pretty standard I think.

I'm about 5 days into the 7 day evaluation period, after which I'm locked
into Clear's two year WiMAX contract, so any timely feedback would be
greatly appreciated.  Off-list replies are encouraged as I'm subscribed
to the list's digest.

Thanks,
Jeff

I have always been able to mount a partition from my desktop computer
on my laptop with this command:

sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.0.148:/media/md3 /media/Devil6_md3/

Where 192.168.0.126:/media/md3 is the partition on the desktop
and /media/Devil6_md3/ is the mount point on the laptop. There are two
problems with this that I'd like to resolve:

1) Every time I mount the desktop partition on the laptop I must first
figure out what the desktop address has become. For example, the last
time I did this its address was 192.168.0.126. Today it is
192.168.0.148. It is easy enough to use the GUI on the desktop to
figure it out (System > Adminsitration > Network Tools, then click on
the ethernet device in the dropdown). But I shouldn't have to do this.
Is there a way to make things stay the same?

2) (More critical). Today it won't let me mount it:

jjj at Devil7:~$ sudo mount -t nfs
192.168.0.148:/media/md3 /media/Devil6_md3/ 
mount.nfs: access denied by server while mounting
192.168.0.148:/media/md3

I never got denied access before. What happened? How can I give myself
permission? And while I'm at it, it would be more convenient to GUI-ize
this. Perhaps a script that I can make executable and set up with an
icon in the panel? Something like:

!/bin/bash
sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.0.148:/media/md3 /media/Devil6_md3/ 
#assuming I can get it working

You can probably setup in the router to recognize the desktop by MAC
address, and always give it the same IP address.

John:
I don't know if you will think this is any better or not.

I always set my machines up with static IP addressing. When they boot, 
they always have the same address. If I want to go on line via my 
ethernet DSL MODEM and router, as root "/sbin/dhcpcd" gets an address 
from the router.

When done on line, as root, I reset my IP address back to my static 
address with "ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.xxx up". I can then nfs mount, 
ssh, telnet etc. using the hostname.

Is the dhcp lease very short and your IP address changing over the course of
the ssh session?

Usually, I have no problem setting static IP addresses up if they're
on the same subnet as my router, but outside of the DHCP pool. For
example, my router is set to hand out addresses 192.168.19.64/24 to
192.168.19.96/24. If I set my system to 192.168.19.4/24, it can get
out to the Internet, AND I have a static IP address for it.

In my very brief test, I had multiple instances where my client device
(a laptop connected by ethernet) had to manually release/renew my dhcp
lease on the LAN side of the WiMax device.  In your shoes my
inclination would be to take it back to Clear and tell them you aren't
satisfied.  Once the evaluation period expires, you have no leverage.
If you are prepared to walk away, you are likely to have their maximum
attention.

Two choices:

 a) static network configuration of your client devices rather than
    using dhcp; or 

 b) configuring your dhcp server to always hand out the same ip addrs
    by mac address.

For the laptop:
---------
#		to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync) hostname2(ro,sync)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync)
#
#/ Devil6(rw)
/               192.168.0.101(rw)
--------

Note that the desktop is Devil6 and the laptop is Devil7. 

The GUI on the desktop displays the hardware address of the ethernet
controller. It also shows "ethernet interface (eth1) as IPv4:
192.168.0.148."

On the laptop the GUI displays the hardware address of its ethernet
controller as well, and its IPv4 address as 192.168.0.101.

I don't know offhand what the router's address is. I can't find the
documentation either. But it's a Netgear that's only a year old, so no
doubt I could get the documentation from Netgear online and then figure
out how to determine its address.

Looking at the /etc/exports file on the desktop reveals what may be the
problem. Its last two lines are:

/media/md3	Devil7(rw) 192.168.0.102(rw)
/			Devil7(rw)

It looks to me as though the desktop is willing to give permission to
Devil 7 but only if its address is 192.168.0.102. So I manually changed
the /etc/exports file on the desktop to 192.168.0.101 and tried again
the mount the partition on the laptop. Still got an access denied
message, although the text of the messae is slightly different:

jjj at Devil7:~$ sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.0.148:/media/md3 /media/Devil6_md3/ 
mount.nfs: access denied by server while mounting 192.168.0.148:/media/md3

In any event, yeah, I'll be livestreaming this.  See

But I'm only going to continue if I know I'm doing this for more than
a few people.  It's not *much* work, but it's still work.

Subject: [PLUG] SSH session hangs over WiMAX
Message-ID: <49751904.8X5Af6UKUvGi3uyR%jgw@tx0.org>

Thanks for the prompt replies.  Per Chris M's suggestion, I added a
"TCPKeepAlive yes" to the ssh_config file which seems to help some.  The
DHCP lease time is 1 hour (the CPE's default).  I've not had the IP change
during a session so I don't think that's the problem.

After another disconnect - while I was chatting online with a Clear
CustomerCare person! - I've decided to opt out of the service and and
awaiting the arrival of an email containing the RMA UPS label.  I guess
its an okay service for casual web surfing, but I wouldn't want to cutting
out in the middle of something important like banking or online purchases.

Cheers,
Jeff

Dear John, 

In general, one way to avoid problems like you suggest is:

1) Static IP addresses (or consistent IP address assignments as Russell
suggests)
2) NFS sharing for the entire network. 

You've listed the following in your /etc/exports


/               192.168.0.101(rw)
--------
/media/md3	Devil7(rw) 192.168.0.102(rw)
/			Devil7(rw)

In general, I'd avoid sharing with hostnames and single IP address on a
private network, unless security within your network is at issue. (And
it's also risky to share the top-level root directory (/).)

So you might change your /etc/exports to

/              192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0(rw)

/media/md3     192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0(rw)

Though I'd encourage you to focus the sharing on more regular directory
like /home.

Thanks,
Mike

I generally find it's quite difficult to actually sit down and watch a
recorded meeting -- so I would strongly suggest you *not* base a
decision to record things on my request.

I think recording the meetings is a *great* idea, but I'm not likely
to take advantage of it frequently.

I generally find it's quite difficult to actually sit down and watch a
recorded meeting -- so I would strongly suggest you *not* base a
decision to record things on my request.

I think recording the meetings is a *great* idea, but I'm not likely
to take advantage of it frequently.

I don't recall having any issues picking up my comcast analog channels.
Although I use MythTV with a QAM tuner card and comcast $8/month cable, so
most of my cable TV is already Digital...

The other stuff I generally request on DVD via netflix.  But then I'm cheap
and I don't watch that much TV either :-)

Well, I'm usually only one person and I probably would not use this
frequently.  But I am interested in this topic, so when someone asked
I figured I'd add my interested++; to the mix.  Besides, if it is as
revolutionary as the advertisement promises, there might be quite a
large audience interested!

Thanks to you and all the others for the replies and suggestions.

First, I found and downloaded the manual for my router (D-link Gamer
Gigabit router). Once I reviewed the manual I remembered how I set it
up. It uses a web interface, so you just type 192.168.0.1 into a web
browser and it takes you into the router setup stuff. Unfortunately,
when I set it up I just did the defaults. This time I went into the
various options and discovered I had no knowledge of what the
documentation was talking about. I did get it set to allow connections
only from the MAC addresses of the ethernet devices in the laptop and
the desktop. And having done so, both still function.

However, I still can't mount the desktop's partition on the laptop -
same error messages, access denied.

Regarding sharing only the home folders, I have other folders on the
desktop outside of ~/ that I may occasionally want access to from the
laptop. 

I need to figure out how to set each computer to a fixed IP address.
And then I need to figure out why I did that. And maybe I should just
enroll in a networking course. All to transfer some files from my
laptop to my desktop. Better idea: Get a massive USB disk and transfer
them one diskful at a time. Considering the time I'll hve to invest in
learning how this stuff works it might ne more cost effective.

Sorry for my attitude. It's late and I'm grumpy.

I just looked up and there are different models, but the first one listed by
google was the DGL-4100. In the manual for that, under DHCP there's a
section for "Add Static DHCP Client" which then lets you enter the MAC
address and tell it which IP address that MAC address should get every time
it requests one. This is on page 19 of the pdf manual from this page:
http://games.dlink.com/products/?pid=371&#DGL-4100
Direct link:
ftp://ftp.dlink.com/Gateway/dgl4100/Manual/dgl4100_manual_100.zip

I would expect other models to at least be similar.

Good luck,
Erik

Another option would be ftp or sftp.  Since I have only two machines
and haven't really had the need for a complex (or even simple) local
network, I just use a simple ftp client to move files back and forth.
Debian/Ubuntu have several graphical and command-line ftp clients to
pick from.

I guess it would get tedious if you need to move lots and lots of
files from one machine to another all the time.  But if you're only
doing a handful of files a day, it's quick and easy.

Networking is ... mind-boggling.

I have done that. At least I think I have done so. The page is under
the Basic tab and the section is Network Settings. At the bottom of the
page it says "Add DHCP Reservations." It even has a feature where it
will look at the ethernet device on the computer you are accessing it
from and pop its MAC address in. I set up the two computers each with
their current IP adddresses and even rebooted to be sure they were
getting the same IP address from the router.

But when I try to mount the desktop's partition on the laptop I still
get:

jjj at Devil7:~$ sudo mount -t nfs
192.168.0.148:/media/md3 /media/Devil6_md3/ mount.nfs: access denied by
server while mounting 192.168.0.148:/media/md3

It seems to me that it ought to be popping up a request for my username
and password on the desktop before allowing me to mount its partitions
on the laptop. Or maybe I can specify my username and password for the
desktop when issuing the mount command on the laptop. I can't find any
instructions on this in man mount.

Wouldn't an entry in the /etc/hosts file allow him the access he needs?

Quite some time ago, Arch Linux used /opt for Mozilla apps (Firefox,
SeaMonkey, etc.) and, IIRC, OpenOffice.org.  I was never quite clear
why, and I don't think Arch does that anymore.  It was irritating
because /opt wasn't in a user's path by default and at the time, I
wasn't exactly sure what a path was, how it worked, or how to modify
it.  Debian doesn't seem to use /opt for anything, at least nothing I
have installed.  It's empty.

I keep a "stuff" partition on a second hard drive, but set it up to
automount at boot time under root.  A while ago I asked if there were
any security implications in having a directory mounted under / but
owned by a user & user's group, and no one seemed to think this was a
problem.  I haven't had the kind of relative-path issues Chris
mentioned because I pretty mostly use it for excess stuff I haven't
sorted and pruned.  I tend to think of it as my procrastination
partition.  Once in a while when I'm dual-booting, I might put a few
things there that I want to access from both OS'es, so I don't have to
mount the home partition from the other OS.

Dear John, 

FWIW, NFS doesn't authenticate mounts based on usernames or passwords.
I've tried what I think is equivalent to your configuration, with the
following in my /etc/exports:

/ 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0(rw)

I think /etc/exports is pretty sensitive to things like extra spaces. If
I remember right, even a space after the end of the line could lead to
errors. 

If the share is properly exported, you should be able to read it with a
showmount -e command. For example, if the NFS server is on
192.168.0.148, you'd run the following command, and get the noted export
list:

$ showmount -e 192.168.0.148
Export list for 192.168.0.148:
/                     192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0

After I confirm that works, I run the following command, which works:

$ sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.0.148:/ /mnt/

To confirm, I find the following in my /var/log/syslog file:
Jan 20 11:02:19 ubuntuhardy3 mountd[6807]: authenticated mount request
from 192.168.0.8:776 for / (/)

I also get the following in the output to the mount command:

192.168.0.148:/ on /mnt type nfs (rw,addr=192.168.0.148)


Thanks,
Mike

Subject: [PLUG] question: low power CAT5 switches
Message-ID: <20090120213810.GB26429@gate.kl-ic.com>

I spent way too much time yesterday "rationalizing" a 15 year 
accumulation of cat5 and coax ethernet cables in my office and
the house (among other things).   Now my ALIX firewall/router
and 2 out of 6 ethernet switches are stacked together in one
place (talking to 3 other switches and up to 7 other computers), 
cables are shorter and labelled at the ends, unused cables are
eliminated, etc.  After all the work optimizing power on the 4
watt ALIX, the power drawn by the 8 port Linksys EZXS88W switches
are now the most significant power usage in the network - they
draw around 6W each, idle.

In theory, an ideal 802.3 ethernet PHY driver uses around 80mW
when transmitting a packet (2.8V into 100 ohms) and nothing 
when idle.  The high signalling voltages are legacy, from the
days when ethernet and analog telephones shared cable bundles -
an analog phone going on or off hook can inject a 250mV crosstalk
spike into the ethernet pairs.

A 100% active 8 port switch transmitting on half its ports
should ideally consume less than 0.4W peak, much less idling.
Of course, the internals will take some power, but modern
electronics consumes less and less per digital function than
the old stuff.

There is a new standard coming, 802.3az energy efficient
ethernet, that will reduce the power still more in data
centers.  That probably will not interoperate with existing
gear, so it is not a consideration for me.  Still, it should
be possible to reduce the power a lot for plain old 802.3.

So, I would like to find new switches (4, 8, and 16 port)
that reduce the power.  Suggestions?

Keith

  Seagate's Update Bricking Working HDDs
  http://www.tomshardware.com/news/seagate-500gb-1tb-firmware-update,6867.html

Turns out I went and did a survey of the drives I have deployed last
night and discovered that yesterday Seagate released a firmware
upgrade that they recommended be applied to the affected disk models.
Even though my drives were working fine, the specter of sudden disk
failure loomed, and now I'd been warned by the manufacturer.  I
downloaded the small .iso, booted off the FreeDOS image and applied
the (again, i repeat, *recommended*) upgrade.  Boom.  It bricked the
drive.  BIOS sees it, but attempts to interact with it at boot result
in a "Hard Disk Error" message.  Apparently, the firmware SD1A is
busted for the ST3500320AS.

Now, I didn't lose anything of value, other than the work to install.
Turns out a few hours later last night, Seagate withdrew their update
to do more testing/validation.  I reached someone today and was told
that they were working on a new revision and testing.  The said it
might be a week before it's available.  In the meantime, my machine is
dead-ish (about to boot a live CD).  Thanks Seagate.  Heck of a job.

Apparently, this particular behavior is specific to the 500G model
(ST3500320AS), but it certainly raising understandable questions about
the rigor and competence of Seagates firmware engineering and quality
control.

If you downloaded a Seagate harddisk firmware update yesterday and
haven't applied it yet, for your own sake I urge you to *REVIEW
CAREFULLY* the current status of that update and make sure you've got
a convenient copy of the data on the disk that would be updated.  You
update might be sending it on an extended vacation.

Good luck!

Subject: [PLUG] IOGEAR GCS1764 DVI USB KVM
Message-ID: <20090120221924.GA26811@gate.kl-ic.com>

"IOGEAR GCS1764 DVI USB KVM" - with everything officially all
caps, it sounds like I am shouting, doesn't it?

No questions here, just some experiences.

As part of my office cleanup, I put DVI-output video cards into
all my tower machines, and connected to them through an IOGEAR 
four port digital KVM, feeding a Viewsonic flat screen.  The 
old Gateway VX900 (rebranded Hitachi CM1711, IIRC ) CRT
monotor is now in storage.  More deskspace, less heat.

Like all DVI KVMs, startup order is important - first the 
monitor, then the KVM, then the computers.  The computers must
be selected during boot for the KVM to learn about them.  

The 4 port GCS1764 was on openbox sale at Frys for $162 - they
are on sale at Newegg for $175 with free shipping.  The unit
comes with 4 cable sets, with only the digital video routed.
If you want to route analog video, the box may support it, 
but you will need your own cables (if you are routing analog
video, buy a cheaper analog switch!).  The cables also carry
one USB path, and stereo audio in and out.   There is also
a serial cable for downloading firmware upgrades to the box,
but no downloadable firmware on the IOGEAR site.

The GCS1764 is a bit quirky - apparently it won't talk properly
to NVidia chipsets integrated on motherboards (a USB problem). 
The device has two ports for USB mouse and keyboard on the front.
The front USB ports don't work right for me -  the keyboard will
occasionally behave like it has a stuck key, and repeat.  However,
there are two USB ports on the back, intended for sharing other
peripherals, that work fine for the keyboard.  The KVM (actually
called a "KVMP", and thus a little hard to find on the Newegg
site) controls are a little quirky - four buttons in front.  You
must push and hold the switch for about 5 seconds (!) to make it
switch both the video and the back USB ports. 

The GCS1764 manual explains setting the device up with hotkeys;
however, the keyboard must be connected to the front USB port
for this to work.  I would rather just push the front buttons.

So the IOGEAR GCS1764 KVMP is a little quirky, but it is a lot
better than a bunch of monitors.  If you can put the unit on
your desktop, and the computers are close enough for the 6
foot cables to reach, and the conditions above are met, it will
save you some power and desk space.

BTW, for my wife's new office computer, I bought an IOGEAR two
port USB DVI KVM, assuming I would need to switch between a net
connected Linux EEE and an isolated WinXP EEE.  Now that I have
Dragon Naturally Speaking working under VMWare, I can achieve 
the same isolation with proper passwording and encryption on
one machine.  That KVM worked fine, too.

That helped. It showed that the desktop was still expecting to connect
to 192.168.0.102, when the laptop was -.101. I looked in the exports
file on the desktop and it showed -.101. So then I did
"/etc/init.d/networking restart" on the desktop. But afterwards the
showmount command on the laptop still showed the desktop insisting that
it would connect only to -.102.

Finally, I rebooted the desktop again (about three times now). And then
the showmount command reflected the correct exports. And then I was
finally also able to mount the partitions on the laptop. Whew!

Curious that restarting the network did not update the exports. Oh
well. I am now much better off because each machine has a fixed address
so the command should never fail again. Thanks to all for the advices.

Instead of networking, I think you're supposed to restart the NFS service.

Tim is correct you need to restart the NFS daemon on the machine that is
exporting to clients in order for the changes in /etc/exports to take
effect, restarting networking will only do something meaningful if you
changed the IP address for the NIC/Wireless card etc.

I think the preferred tool for this is exportfs(8).  In this case I 
would do the following:

/usr/sbin/exportfs -r -v

I had a Seagate drive that failed. It had a five-year warranty and
failed at about two years. Seagate made good on it. And it started
making funny noises before it failed so, clever fellow that I am, I
immediately made a couple of thorough backups. No data loss.

Nevertheless, I crossed Seagate off my list. But having said that,
everyone here has heard of drive failures and I'm sure other brands
have had their share of bad stuff. In my case it is just scar tissue
that makes me reject Seagate.

And then just a couple days ago I bought a Maxtor. Maxtor is now owned
by Seagate. I just hope it came out of a different factory. :(

I've never had a Seagate fail but I've had several fail from Western Digital
(all purchased at Wal Mart, so probably more an issue with the re-seller
then WD themselves) and their warranty's aren't as good but if you're out of
warranty and have a failed drive they have a customer loyalty program where
you can upgrade to a new drive at a deeply discounted price.

I have had drives of all varieties fail.  Drives have finite lives.
Failing is expected.  What is more surprising is an update billed as a
recommended action to *prevent* premature failure actually causing
immediate failure of what was previously an apparently functioning
drive.  And then having that followed up by pretty much total silence
about the problem, not providing a way to immediately revert whatever
/sbin/fsckage their broken update did, etc.  That is a monumental,
viability-threatening event in the life of a company.

Subject: [PLUG] The Ubuntu Hard Drive Killing Bug Fixed (I hope)
Message-ID: <1232517691.4983.10.camel@UbuntuHH>

Folks, 

Somewhat related to the Seagate thing is the Ubuntu hard drive bug -
fixes are being released for various Ubuntu releases, through updated
acpi-support packages. 

When I first saw the bug, I checked the number of cycles on my hard
drive with the following command:

$ sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda | grep 193

which reveals the "Load_Cycle_Count". If I remember right, the typical
load cycle count lifetime is about 600,000 cycles. When I checked it on
a fairly new hard drive (less than 2mo) on my Dell e1405, it was at
180,000 cycles. I thought, oh S$(*! and tinkered until I found this fix
which I put in my /etc/rc.local

hdparm -B 200 /dev/sda

But now, everything should be OK with the latest update.

For more info, see
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/acpi-support/+bug/59695 

Thanks,
Mike

I just tried this, but evidently smartctl is not installed. So I did
"sudo apt-get install smartctl," but no luck. Not in my repositories. I
have just about every repository enabled.

apt-cache search <foo> is your friend :)

$  sudo apt-cache search smartctl
smartmontools - control and monitor storage systems using S.M.A.R.T.

that's the package you need.

To find the right package:

$ apt-cache search smartctl

which should lead to the following message:
smartmontools - control and monitor storage systems using S.M.A.R.T.

Then 

$ sudo apt-get install smartmontools

Thanks,

Because he runs his own server, and that's the machine that's giving him 
trouble (I think), he can't get or receive e-mail. I haven't heard from 
him since yesterday morning, so you should probably give him a call at 
503-667-4517.

Subject: [PLUG] Alternatives to gnome-power-manager
Message-ID: <c834ec80901210948q395cf992g7d6b3ad469735232@mail.gmail.com>

I run a number of ubuntu/debian laptops that use Enlightenment DR17 as
the window manager / desktop environment, and since ubuntu ~7 or so
(and about the same time for debian) I've only been able to get the
power-management features to work under these configurations by
running gnome-power-manager in the background.  This has the following
advantages:

* suspend/resume "just works"
* I can configure the power management settings fairly easily (as long
as the settings I want to configure have been deemed "important" to
the Gnome Dieties.)
* Things like screen dimming when unplugging the AC, etc. work
* the screen brightness and volume controls make use of some On-screen
display that looks fairly clean.
* etc..

However, gnome-power-manager crashes frequently.  It often dies when I
unplug the power, leaving the screen brightness OSD on-screen untill I
kill the process, or at times all or some of the above features will
simply stop working.  <rant> In short, I'm sick of babysitting it, and
I'd much rather support a project that has a better design.  IMHO,
power-management has no place in a Desktop Manager, and had this been
designed "properly" then the Gnome power manager would be nothing but
a snazzy UI for some background WM-agnostic daemon that did the actual
work. (Maybe there are some good reasons for this, but I have been
unable to discern any other than ease of implementation.)</rant>

Does anyone know of other applications / daemons / etc. I could try in
order to get similar functionality?

Thanks!
Rogan

Subject: [PLUG] Stopping ssh brute force attacks
Message-ID: <49779A2A.9080401@cyber-office.net>

There have been several threads about handling the ssh login floods
especially the noise that gets into /var/messages.

Well I found and have tested an Iptables solution.  Works quite nice.

I run CentOS 5.x systems so I can't say how to get this into other
iptables but here it goes.

This is an excerpt from a working /etc/sysconfig/iptables file. 
Redhatian users should recognize the first four lines.   This is where I
put it on my systems.  I still have to figure out how to make it hold
for longer than the 60 seconds.
    I also changed syslog to use /var/log/iptables for the
SSH-Brute_force messages.  You could just take the LOG statement out and
then only see actual attempts.

I've added blank lines to make the MUA induced wrap standout.  This is
based on the information I found at
	http://www.la-samhna.de/library/brutessh.html
Which is based on

Subject: [PLUG] Jax dining room going away
Message-ID: <20090122074049.GB4815@gate.kl-ic.com>

Jax is effectively going away in February.

Tonight after Advanced Topics, Alan and I talked with Barb Davis,
co-owner of Jax.  Her landlord won't let her have the large
dining room area at a price she can afford, so it disappears at
the end of January.  We have been using the room for advanced 
topics, and general meeting afters.  POSSE and Personal Telco
also use it for their monthly meetings.  Jax will have a small
room available, seating 10 people, behind the kitchen.  Not 
big enough, and not available until March or April or so.

So, the hunt is on for another venue.  We need free, and a place
we can set up a projector and screen.  The ideal site (which we
are probably not going to find) would have these characteristics:

   1)  Free (unless you volunteer pay for it yourself)
   2)  Seating between 10 and 40
   3)  Reasonably quiet
   4)  Affordable food and beer until 11pm or so
   5)  Not too far from downtown
   6)  Parking
   7)  MAX within walking distance
   8)  Wifi (though we might help them set this up)
   9)  Screen  ("")
  10)  Projector ("")

That is my ordering, YMMV.  If there is a screen and projector,
I get to use MAX myself.  Some places (like McMenamins) are
free if we order enough food, but sometimes advanced topics
doesn't draw a big crowd, while other times we fill the room. 
On the small crowd nights, we don't want to hit the organizers
and speakers with a bill for the difference.

I imagine we will continue to schedule the general meeting on
the first thursday, but we can probably move the Advanced 
Topics meeting to monday or tuesday if necessary.  We can use
two different venues, of course, but we lose some leverage. 
Moving will cost us some attendees, while enabling others, but
may be necessary if that is the only time a venue is available.

I like ethnic restaurants, but many of you do not.  I live in
Beaverton, but a move away from downtown would mean many of
you would no longer appear.  Overall, I will gladly forgo

Recessions stink!!  I have some good friends who closed their down town
restaurant about a year ago because of a combination of increased rents,
disruptive street construction, and simply not getting enough customers.

More to the point, we need to find a new location.
I think we should keep as many of our meetings at their normal times
if at all possible.  We have the room at PSU scheduled and reserved
for us on the first Thursday of the month for the foreseeable future.
I'm reluctant to change this - unless we have to.

Would it make any sense to go back to the Lucky Lab?
Of course, the Lucky Lab has noise problems - and they weren't willing
to give us the meeting room for free.  However given this recession,
they maybe willing to reconsider.  Should I talk to them?

For post-General Meeting, I'd vote for returning to the LuckyLab.  It
is on my way home and I miss their spicy peanut curry bento.  As for
Advanced Topics, I don't have any immediate ideas, except maybe to
look here:

I wouldn't mind the Lucky Lab either. (To my palate) the food isn't all 
that exciting but it's in a relatively safe part of town (NW Quimby,) 
it's an easy-off from fairly high-speed lanes (the I-405 to US30 cutoff 
from the Fremont bridge, only two stoplights,) and free parking nearby 
is often feasible.

Note to drivers: Get off 23rd as soon as you can; those pedestrians are 
the creme-de-la-creme of righteous arrogance - once on 22nd or 21st you 
can repeat the stopsignbrake-glanceleft-glanceright-PUNCH cycle until 
you hit Quimby.

How inconvenient would the Pepper Mill near Kinnaman and Farmington in
Aloha be to people? They have a large back room, good food at reasonable
prices and some alcohol, though they are not a brewpub. It is quiet --
too quiet, actually. I don't know about a projector or screen. There is
lots of free parking. I don't think they have wifi. I don't know if they
charge extra for the room -- I can ask them if there is some consensus
on the Tri-Met issue noted below.

I think the big gotcha will be Tri-Met. There is a bus that goes by, but
I am uncertain of the night schedule and it is a "milk run" between the
Beaverton and Willow Creek transit centers.

http://trimet.org/schedules/r052.htm


In short -- great place, convenient for Beaverton/Aloha/Hillsboro folks
with vehicles but not necessarily for anyone else. So if you're a
Tri-Met person, hit up the trip planner, see if it would work for you
and let me know. The address is

17455 SW Farmington Rd # 26B
Aloha, OR 97007
(503) 642-5193

I may check out the "upscale" restaurants at Beaverton Central MAX
station tonight, since I'm going to be at OTBC for a meeting. I don't
have much hope for that because they look expensive, but I might be wrong.

I like that your solution fits within an existing firewall.

I'm too lazy to crank through somehting like that; I let BlockHosts put
entries in the firewall and take them out after the 'cooling off
period'.

Quimby?  23rd?  Are you talking about some *other* lucky lab?

We're talking about the one at 915 SE Hawthorne.

Yes.  Though there are three lucky labs all together, one of which is
at about 19th on Quimby in NW.  The other is in Multnomah Village.
All three are PTP nodes, btw.  Historically we've used the one on SE
Hawthorne, and it is to that one I suggest we return.

Note to Drivers #2:  Do not turn left on 23rd.  Instead, make a wide
U-turn (as if you were going to go back up to the Fremont Bridge),
then immediately take the Thurman St. exit.  Turn right at the first
stop sign (19th St.).  Proceed 3 blocks south and turn right onto
Quimby for the front entrance.  Or, from the Thurman/19th stop sign, 
proceed only 2 blocks south and turn right onto Raleigh, which gives
access to the big parking lot in the back of the Lab.

As nice as the NW Lab is, I suspect the meeting room at the original
Hawthorne location is a better fit.  IIRC, the NW Lab won't let you
have their room for free.

Hot Lips Pizza at 2nd and Hawthorne. I have not been there, but their
web site says this about it:

There is now BIG HUGE ABUNDANT DINING SPACE AT HAWTHORNE and tables
outside. Lots of room for families, sports teams, birthday parties,
meetings and classes. There is plenty of parking with a lot right in
front of the store including handicapped access and easy on street
parking. This store serves beer and wine in store as well as great
bottles and prices for carry out.  503.234.9999

We hold student meetings at the Hot Lips on PSU campus and they don't
have a place where we could set up easily. But they are happy to have
groups and don't do the room rent thing.

However, the Hawthorne location closes at 10. 

Perhaps someone in the area can stop by to check it out.

Again, PLEASE, check your suggestions out yourself.  Visit the
place, have a meal, ask the proprietors, etc.  Walk the walk.

I live in Beaverton, I'm working 80hrs a week and getting six
hours of sleep a night, I'm a low-carb vegetarian who doesn't
drink beer, and I'm already doing plenty of volunteer work for
PLUG.  The only time I make it to restaurants is for meetings,
so I am a lousy judge of these places.

Dave lives in Corvallis, has a farm to run, and is even busier.
Yet he already spends plenty of time finding speakers and making
announcements, as well as promoting other activities such as 
Linux Fund.  He might be a better judge of restaurants, but he
is a long way away.

Please be a participant, not a yacktivist.  You don't change the
world from the sidelines.  If we all contribute, we can accomplish
almost anything.

Keith

Similar to the way denyhosts works.

I have used denyhosts.  Works fine as an after the fact block.  The down
side is the size of the hosts.deny gets to be.  This Iptables method
gets them on the fourth (or whatever) try.  I have had a situation where
a valid user got locked out.  I think it was the fault of the Windows
ssh/terminal software he was using.

I am thinking of trying a TARPIT instead of a DROP.  This will hold the
connection, won't let them disconnect, for 12-24 minutes according to
the man page.  So I'm thinking four tries in one minute and get held for
a bit.  :-)

Hopefully my fat fingers won't get me in trouble.

All consumer drives suck. Every single brand. If you want far better
reliability, then get SAS drives and controllers. When you're dealing
with this stuff, support becomes a big issue. Seagate is dealing with
the issue and providing free data recovery service to boot. Their
warranties have been the best for a long time, and overall their
reliability sucks way less than the rest. I replace my personal IDE/SATA
drives after about three years.

Message-ID: <20090122231738.cb24f350.johnxj@comcast.net>

You know how you sometimes get that feedback in a PA system? A whine
that changes as people move around or as the mike is positioned?

Well, after connecting my desktop to my stereo and setting it up so I
can use the computer as the sound source, I've got that now in my
study. It's driving me nuts.

Here's the weird part: There are no speakers anywhere near the corner
where the whine is emanating from. The speakers are on another wall and
pointed in another direction. What does exist in the location where the
sound comes from is the stereo receiver, a cable modem, an ethernet
switch and a router. And because of those devices there are quite a lot
of cables in the area.

I have completely disconnected the computer from the receiver by
pulling the cables out of the RCA input jacks. The sound continues. I
have turned the receiver completely off and the sound continues. Now,
with the receiver completely off there is no current going to the
speakers (at least nothing more than what the speaker wires might be
picking up from random rf in the room), so the sound cannot be coming
out of the speakers. And I mean it gets loud.

The only way to get relief is to lean back in my chair or otherwise
reposition myself. 

All I can conclude is that the modem, the switch or the router is
vibrating to produce the whine. The only other things in the corner of
the room where the sound comes from is wood, drywall and some paint.
Has anyone ever had such a device emit an audible feedback pitch? Any
other suggestions?

It's really 22nd and Hawthorne, not 2nd.  I live near there and
find myself  'at liberty' once again, so I'll go by and have a look and ask

Is your computer microphone turned on?   Double-click the speaker
in your tray, select "Capture", and see if the microphone is muted
or not.

Yes, it was turned on. It is now muted.

However, I haven't been hearing the feedback whine for about the past
hour. It comes and goes. However, considering that I get the feedback
noise even with the computer completely disconnected from the receiver
and the receiver turned off, I wonder if turning off the mic in the
computer will make any difference. 

But I'll leave it turned off and see if it helps. Thanks for the
suggestion.

Unplug them each and wait perhaps 10 seconds to allow capacitors to 
drain?  When the sound stops, take that device in the next room (or 
otherwise plug it in by itself) and see if you can replicate it.

Are any of the wires wrapped around your stereo speaker wires?  But 
then, you said the sound isn't coming from the speakers. :-/

And failing all of that:  how loud is it?  Can you hear it over the 
stereo?  Is the stereo loud enough?

Also check for RF interference, I get what sounds like a high pitched 
whistle from the powered speakers on the PC, but listening closely it's 
a radio station being picked up by the wiring. Keith I'm sure would have 
a good explanation and solution to that problem.

The sound is not a radio station. It's exactly that variable wailing
whine you get when there is feedback in an old PA system. As I move my
body around the pitch and volume varies. And from past experience with
old PA systems, the position of the mic, speakers, and the mic gain are
related to the whine.

I thought Keith's suggestion to mute the mic on the desktop PC was
excellent. Unfortunately, having muted the mic in alsamixer, the whine
continues as before. For that matter, there is no microphone plugged in
on the PC. :(

It's really hard to troubleshoot because the slightest movement of my
body affects it. When it starts I want to get up and walk over to the
corner where it is coming from to feel the router, switch and modem
just to see if I can sense vibration from them. But the minute I move
the sound stops. Disconnecting any of them would kill my network. And I
might have to wait for a long time to see if the sound continues
because it is not always present.

The weird thing is that I sometimes get the sound even when the stereo
receiver is completely turned off. That means it has to be coming from
the router, modem or switch. It is also (barely) possible that it is
coming from the desktop PC, which is sitting on top of the table toward
that end of the room. For it to be coming from the PC the sound would
have to be echoing or somehow creating an auditory illusion that it is
coming from the corner. 

The PC is just a $50 box from Fry's with pretty standard stuff in it.
I'm not even sure the speaker in it is capable of making that much
sound. I don't even know where the speaker in it is located, except
that presumably it is toward the front of the case. That means it would
be facing away from the corner where I heard the sound coming from.

Troubleshooting something like this is maddening.

Combined ground loop w/radio reception?
Is all the equipment plugged in using grounded plugs/receptacles?
Anything using 2 prong cords that don't have one side larger than the other?

   Finally got my main server/workstation booting and running
(Slackware-12.2) late this morning (and the notebook earlier this week). The
help and Slackware insight from Drew Wymore was absolutely invaluable, and
Dick Steffen's help as an intermediary to the list is also greatly
appreciated.

   Both Keith Lofstrom and Ed Borasky worked to indentify problems with the
notebook at last Sunday's clinic. A public "thank you" to them, too.

   The key issue with the notebook (after a few re-installations of -12.2)
turns out to be a missing module from the initial ram disk so it will boot
only from a monolithic kernel. This also turned out to be one issue on the
server/workstation, too. A fix for that will be implemented this weekend.

   The two key issues with the desktop were related to udev and the mtimes of
/etc files being newer than the mtimes of the same files on the new
installation of -12.2. In /etc/rc.d/rc.udev under -12.1 is the now-famous
string, "Triggering udev events: /sbin/udevtrigger". However, in -12.2,
there is no "/sbin/udevtrigger", but "/sbin/udevadm trigger". Critical
difference that I had to fix by hand since the USB flash drive was not
recognized as a device when I booted into the Slackware Disk #1.

   For the edification of other Slackware uses as inexperienced as SysAdmins
as I was, it's quite simple to use Disk #1 as a rescue/live disk. Boot as
though you want to install the distribution and when you log in as root,
make a new root-level directory (e.g., /slack), mount your hard drive's root
partition on that mount point (e.g., 'mount /dev/hda1 /slack'), then 'chroot
/slack'. Now you can mount other partitions on their normal mount points and
futz with the system unitl you figure out what needs to be repaired.

   Now to clean up the fuzzy edges and get back to work ....

   Are others running firefox-3.x? That's replace the 2.x series in
Slackware-12.2 and it is a major disappointment. When I open links from
yesterday in the history sidebar the links are copied to the 'Today'
section. But, as soon as I close the 'Yesterday' section, all of today's
links are removed. That makes the history useless. It also does not seem to
be stored in another, hidden place.

   Is this some mis-configuration on my part, or is it a 'feature' of the
latest (and _very_ slow) release?

That happens here too, and seems to make sense.  (Granted, I never use
the history, so I could be misunderstanding something about the best
workflow..)

That does not seem to happen here, but maybe we're using different
"history" views.   There are too many links in each day's history to
make it worthwhile to have more than one day expanded at a time, but
even if I have today and yesterday expanded, collapsing either one has
no effect on the other.

I've not noticed much difference in speed, but 3.x uses substantially
less ram than the 2.x series.  (meaning it only takes 600mb of ram,
rather than 1.2-1.6 gigs, and it's usage seems to be relatively
constant for my use patterns.)

I'd suggest getting a pre-compiled binary and try running it out of
your home directory to compare.  (Note that you will need to close
*all* existing instances of firefox before starting up the new version
or you will probably just spawn another window off of the old version
when you try to start the pre-compiled one.  There are ways to avoid
that, but it is much easier to just test them one at a time if you
don't *need* two instances running concurrently.)

Message-ID: <alpine.OSX.2.00.0901231320020.59035@guild.galois.com>

A colleague who should have known better had the NAT/firewall box 
that came with his Comcast Business account hacked today (and perhaps 
earlier).

I don't know the device make/model, but suffice it to say that it 
shipped with a default password (that he didn't change) and a web 
interface exposed to the wider Internet.

I had him shutdown and reset ASAP, so I don't know the complete 
extent of what the hacker (who resides in .cn) was able to accomplish, 
but at the very least they were able to muck with the built-in DHCP 
server, probably to facilitate DNS spoofing.

If you or your acquaintances have Comcast Business accounts, I suggest 
you verify that the router password (a) has been changed and (b) is 
what you expect. If not, shut down and ask Comcast how to get the box 
back to its factory settings -- and then change the password and, if 
possible, don't allow the world access to port 80.

Of course, the advice in the last paragraph applies to any router 
appliance, in Comcast-land or not.

Glad to see you back up Rich. You found the magic to get it to boot. I just
gave you a few pointers and 2 sets of eyes are always better then one when
figuring out really one-off odd problems like this. Perhaps a summary of the
events and steps taken to get back up might be a worthwhile post to the list
or a blog somewhere for future reference so other people don't have to bash
their heads against the wall like we were :)

On the heels of Rich's issues this week we had a conversation about the

throw out the suggestion to have a place where contact info and

from a person who is most familiar with any given set up to accelerate
getting a br0ken machine back up quickly.

I think it's a great idea. I'm fairly proficient with Gentoo, if you want to 
add me to the list.

Cool. I'll write a quick and dirty ajax type app this weekend and post so
that people can post the information they want to (i.e. phone number, IM
contact info,  distro, software packages etc).

The only "green" switches I know about are the "Green Technology"
switches from D-Link.

I have a couple of these at the office:

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817111030

I haven't actually measured their power draw, but they run noticeably
cooler than the physically identical 10/100 D-Link switches they
replaced, so that has to be a good sign.

At work, we have an internal-only lists.blah.com running Mailman to 
service intra-company mailing lists.

I need to bring up a second Mailman list server, this one accessible 
to the wider Internet. Since we already use the standard "lists" 
hostname internally, I can't recycle it.

Any suggestions for a good (c)name for a host that will primarily be a 
Mailman server?

Well, first off I can say that I am pretty sure it is not a ground loop
problem. If it was a ground loop wouldn't the frequency be 60 Hz? I
definitely know what a 60 Hz hum sounds like, and this is way higher -
around 2K Hz or so. 

As for two-prong plugs, everything in the area has three prong plugs
except the wall warts for the router, switch and modem. And they are
all polarized. And I wired the outlets myself when I redid the house
wiring a few years ago. The main panel has separate ground and common,
and the grounds are connected to two earth poles 20 feet apart, plus a
water bond. 

The wow-ee-wow sound it makes could be from rf. There are a lot of
electronic things in the room, so the possibility that stray rf is
being created is very high. Plus, the fact that the volume and pitch
changes as I move my body around sounds exactly like rf. But what on
earth could be receiving it and turning it into audio? I get the sound
even with the receiver turned off. That's the part that has me shaking
my head.

I did buy some new heavy duty speaker wire today. I've been planning on
replacing the wimpy stuff that's in the wall now anyway. When I
finished the remodeling I used 4x8 panels of 1/2 inch particle board
with screwed on bats instead of sheetrock so that I could open the wall
again. This wall has a lot of stuff in it - cable connection, for
example. I'm going to bore new holes for the speaker wires too. I doubt
that it'll make any difference though.

I'll keep poking at it. I can probably solve it just by repositioning
things over and over until it goes away. I'm just curious what is
causing it.

Rogan,

   I clean out the history list during the day because there are about a
dozen sites I visit each day (business related and news).

   Not collapse, but delete. I also find that trying to delete a history
entry can be an exercise in futility.

   Interesting. I generally have 2-3 tabs open and rarely more than 5-6.
Memory consumption has not been an issue for me.

   That's what I'm using: the Slackware package.

Hot Lips is out of the running, at least in the near term.

They are on winter hours, contrary to what the web site says.
They close at 9 on week nights.  The person I talked to said they
would go back to summer hours sometime, maybe around the
time that we 'Spring forward', but bein' as how this was the first
year they had ever used winter hours, he didn't really know.

That said, the room is big enough.  I counted about forty chairs
at tables, plus a couple of couches.  I didn't ask about projectors
and such.  It's really set up as a dining area, not a meeting room.

Subject: [PLUG] Postfix sender question
Message-ID: <200901231751.30601.aaron@madebyai.com>

Is there an easy way to have Postfix rewrite the From header on an outgoing 
message? Here's an example for clarification:

Cron is running a log check script which prints to standard out. Cron then 
takes the output and emails this to root, which is aliased to an external 
address. However, the From header looks like this:

From: root at somedomain.com (root)

This is confusing to people using certain email clients which expext the From 
line to look like this:

From: "Some Name" <root at somedomain.com>

Any assistance accomplishing this would be greatly appreciated!

I'll recant a little.  It would work for a meeting from 7 to 9 in
the evening, but not beyond that.  There are about six or seven
parking spots on site, the rest is on the street, first-com-first-serve.
I got put off by the 9pm thing, and didn't even ask about WiFi.

http://www.crystalradio.net/crystalplans/xximages/inventions36aug.jpg
Well a crystal radio doesn't need any power. A speaker with cross-over network
with a diode in it could possibly get somewhere close enough to cause this type
of problem.  Even more probable if you have a high power transmitter close by.

Any Ham radio operators in your neighborhood?

Sounds great!! Right now I'm running openSUSE 11.1, but I spent many
years before that on Gentoo. I'm actually thinking of taking the laptop
back to Gentoo -- they essentially abandoned the idea of a LiveCD and an
installer so they'd have the energy to keep the more core parts of the
distro healthy.

   I suggest that the web site, perhaps the wiki?, would be a good place for
this. While my MTA was down I could access the Web from my notebook. Any
such posting will be public so the wiki might be as good as any place.

   It would also be fun to see just how many different distros folks here are
using. They could be categorized by package management scheme.

   Good idea, Drew.

Aaron,

   Would an alias do the job?

Rich,

My understanding is that aliases are used for mail redirection, and have 
nothing to do with the From header that is attached to messages.

The problem is really with the mail clients in question, but I'm not able to 
change them out with more RFC compliant ones. It seems like cron is 
generating the mail header and piping the entire contents to a sendmail-esque 
wrapper provided by postfix. I don't really want to go mucking about in the 
source for that wrapper, there must be an option to have Postfix rewrite the 
From line itself.

Thanks,
Aaron

   I'm sure there is such a solution. Suggestion: send an e-mail message
containing only

subscribe postfix-users

to majordomo at postfix.org and subscribe to the mail list. The help there is
outstanding and someone will definitely guide you to a working solution.

Oof.  I probably *could* have been more cryptic, but it would have
taken substantial effort.

What I meant to recommend was running the mozilla-issued binary for
your platform, and comparing that.  Slackware *may* not have made any
alterations, but it's certainly possible that it was modified in some
subtle way that affected the performance.  (I've certainly noticed
differences between Iceweasle and Firefox, but that's not too
surprising.)

Anyway, the behavior you're seeing seems unusual to me, so that's the
first place I'd look.  It should also be pretty easy to test (you can
run it from it's own self-contained directory, from any location).

I'm specifically not putting Mailman on the main mail server, so 
@$company isn't an option. It'll be @$word.$company -- and the 
question concerns what $word should be.

"lists" and "mail" are already in use.

"listserv" is the old-line variation, and it's definitely an option, 
but it just doesn't appeal to me.

I don't like naming generic functions (e-mail list hosting) by the 
product that provides that function, so "mailman" is out.

Back to the drawing board....

Hey Aaron,

Postfix does provide a very simple way to do precisely what you're
describing. Check out the manpage for "header_checks".

Here's a quick rundown though:

1) Add this to /etc/postfix/main.cf:
   header_checks = pcre:/etc/postfix/header_checks.pcre
2) Add the following to /etc/postfix/header_checks.pcre:
  /^From: root at somedomain.com \(root\)/
    REPLACE From: "Some Name" <root at somedomain.com>
3) postfix reload

It works really well, and header_checks provides a variety of other
fun things that you can do to mail headers and bodies.

Now, regarding your actual problem. There may be a better approach
that deals more directly with the irritant - cron. Your cronjob
currently outputs to standard out and the cron manager is deciding how
to do the mail. Instead of that, manage the email yourself by  piping
your cronjob's output to /bin/mail. Try something like this:

* * * * * /usr/local/bin/my_cron_script | /bin/mail -s "Cronjob
Output" -r "Some Name <root at somedomain.com>" recipient at hostname.com

This should work well, and allows you to keep your cronjob mail hacks
inside the crontab instead of buried inside your MTA config.

Hope that helps!

-Heath

And share the answer with us!

This looks promising:
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=38429

Though on this site:
http://www.akadia.com/services/postfix_mta.html

I see this important note:

"For canonical address mapping the address must not be a local user as
it is in Alias mapping."

This second link seems to explain a lot of stuff pretty well.

Subject: [PLUG] Remaining Mail Issues Need Fixing
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.0901240747020.29623@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   We have two remaining issues with e-mail, and I would like advice and
suggestions from more experienced network admins on how to resolve them.

   1) I use alpine as my MUA. Since the machine successfully rebooted
yesterday and returned on-line there is a very long delay after I press C-x
to send the message; 15-30 seconds. It used to be virtually instantaneous.
The ~/mail directory where copies are stored has 700 perms. Those should be
what they were before. Where should I start looking for a reason for this
delay in sending?

   2) My wife's MUA is thunderchicken on her laptop (Xubuntu). Since the
network was brought back up she can send me messages, but cannot retrieve
received messages from /var/spool/mail/. The message displayed on her
monitor is, "Sending of password did not succeed. Mail server salmo 
responded: unable to process from lines (envelopes), change 
recognition modes or check for corrupted mail drop." A long time ago I set
up poppler so she can retrieve mail over the local wireless connection. The
current poppler package is installed. Where do I start looking for the
clogged pipe on this issue?

TIA,

Rich

the answer to both question is, in the system logs.  both poppler and
your MTA (not sure what slackware uses these days...probably postfix,
qmail, or sendmail i'd think, anyway, for this answer it doesn't
matter) should leave droppings in the logs.  if you have a separate
logfile for mail, they should even both be in there.

the "long sending delay" sounds like an MTA problem--sendmail
definitely used to do this if it had trouble with hostnames (when i've
experienced similar delay, it's been my own host that there's been

anyway, there's somewhere to start looking.  post logs if you got 'em
and they don't make things obvious (in the case of poppler i'd be
looking for failed login attempts or similar)

Subject: [PLUG] Sort of free ethernet stuff and RAM
Message-ID: <20090124093553.d4dc12a7.johnxj@comcast.net>

I have the following needing new homes:

Zonet 8-port 10/100 ethernet switch. Works fine. Replaced with 16-port
gigabit rated switch.

Trendnet 16-port 10/100 patch panel model TC-P24C5E. New in box, never
used. Bought larger gigabit rated panel and it's been too long and
can't return to Fry's where I bought it.

Two SiS 512 MB-667 SODIMM DDR-2 modules, part No. SSX264M8-T6E.

If somebody needs them I will give them to you free with the
expectation that you will donate whatever you think is an appropriate
amount of money/time/whatever to Free Geek. If nobody needs them they
get donated to Free Geek anyway.

Chris,

   If it was only that simple! :-)

   Actually, it's qpopper, not poppler, that is supposed to forward mail from
postfix here. I did post the log message, but here it is again:

Jan 24 04:59:30 salmo qpopper[29187]: pamela at wap.appl-ecosys.com
(192.168.55.200): -ERR [SYS/PERM] Unable to process From lines (envelopes), change
recognition modes or check for corrupted mail drop.

   /etc/mail/qpopper.config has permissions 444 and an mtime of 2004-09-08
06:15. I've not tripped over anything in /etc/mail, /etc/log.d/, or the mail
logs that suggest the problem. Please suggest a place for me to look.

   Slackware does not install postfix. There is a SlackBuild script for it
but it's as easy and better to upgrade using the postfix approach. I'm
running 2.5.2 built and installed 2008-06-17.

   I thought it might be a DNS issue, but I've not changed /etc/resolv.conf
since before the Troubles, and /usr/sbin/dnsmasq is running. If I remember
correctly, postfix sees outgoing mail only long enough to determine the
destination is not local so it throws it out to the 'Net to some upstream
DNS server for address resolution and forwarding. Can you suggest where in
my local postfix installation I should check to ensure that's what it's
doing?

Thanks,

Rich

Thanks, that is the kind of thing I was thinking about!

It would be interesting to slap a power meter on one.  The manual
says 30W max, and the animations on the D-Link website suggest
lower under idle and short cable conditions, but it does not say
how much lower. 

The theoretical minimum for a 16 port switch should be about 2W full
duplex all channels blazing, and close to zero watts for all channels
idle, so it would be nice to see where the D-Link is on the spectrum,
between the total of 18 Watts idle my pair of ancient Linksys 8 ports
(only 10/100) draw, and the theoretical minimum (which is almost
independent of link speed, BTW).

2) create/edit /etc/postfix/generic file:

Rich's idea of the Wiki I think is best, it centralizes it to the plug
affiliated stuff. I don't know who is in charge or how to get edit
permissions so if someone can speak up who has the rights to do it then we
can get folks' info posted.

I've had an account+edit permissions for a while on at least one  
pdxlinux wiki, just went to look at it, and it looks like some more  
volunteer policing might be needed:
http://www.pdxlinux.org/wiki/RecentChanges

Is this the right wiki?

IIRC, accounts can be created by anybody, hence, the spam.

There are Ruby groups, PostgreSQL groups, Python groups, Drupal groups,
etc. here in town. They all have their own mailing lists, wikis, etc.
and meet in many of the same places we find ourselves gathering -- PSU,
CubeSpace, the Lucky Lab, Free Geek, OTBC ...

So my opinion is that we should keep the PLUG list focused on Linux, and
use more generic networking resources like Calagator and LinkedIn and
Twitter for non-Linux technologies.

   The 'networking' referred to in these discussions are computers, not
people. Letting PLUG list subscribers know what _linux_ technical resources
are available is, IMNSHO, a Good Thing. Besides, it's on the wiki, not the
mail list.

I can help with putting a directory together for a webpage. I have server
space that I can give to the cause.

Just let me know.

   Fixed: setting smtp-server=localhost in the alpine configuration/settings

   What I pick up from my Google search is that this is an indication of a
corrupted /var/spool/mail user file. How can I fix this?

   The permissions are 660 on user files. Mine works OK, so it must be
limited to hers.

   Can I rename the file a couple of times and see if that works, or is there
an actual method to recreating a user file in that directory?

The space is plenty big enough.  It's a designated event space, with a
stage.  The Event
Coordinator, Sarah Prevost,  wasn't available and the bar staff didn't have
any particulars (did confirm WiFi, but I didn't see anyone actively using).
I called Sarah and left a voice mail.

The room looks like unfinished warehouse space: concrete floor, cubicle-like
office
corral, stacks of barrels and boxes, but art on the walls of the event part,
and a few
tables and chairs.  It was unheated while I was there, and is a large space
to heat.
Since it's a designated event space I'm expecting that they have extra
chairs around.
Parking is on street but plentiful.  I'll have more info after I talk to
Sarah.

Which version of VMware Player are you running? They upgraded not too
long ago. It might be worth heading to the VMware site and downloading a
fresh copy.

Also, "vmware-config.pl" does not exist in the most recent (6.5.1)
version of VMware *Workstation*. The new utility is called
"vmware-modconfig". Try (as root)

# vmware-modconfig --console --install-all

That should at least give you error messages. It should be in /usr/bin
if you need the whole path.

Subject: [PLUG] Grandma Leeth's Restaurant
Message-ID: <20090125043023.GA24082@gate.kl-ic.com>

First off, I like the idea of Roots Organic Brewing company for
meetings; if that works out, we should have Advanced Topics 
(and perhaps afters) there.

However ...

My wife and I had dinner tonight in an unusual place - Grandma
Leeth's Restaurant ( www.grandmaleeths.com ) in the Cedar Hills
shopping center.   Saturday night is jazz night - I am hard of
hearing, and would rather hear my wife talk, so they seated us
upstairs.  A space about as big as Jax.  I asked, and the space
is available for meetings on weeknights.  

Leeth's is unusual because it is very family oriented.  The
downstairs space is half "play room" - actually, a place where
children between 2 and 9 can play and eat with childcare provided
by the restaurant.  Tonight they had three adult women down
there, supervising half a dozen kids,  while the kids' parents
ate with the grownups and listened to jazz.  Parents can sit
near the rail upstairs and glance down at their kids if they
wish.  Tonight, the parents didn't :-) .

As you would expect, this extra service raises the meal prices
a bit - adult entrees range from $11 to $18 or so.  They serve
beer and wine.  They call their food "world comfort food", and
I would call it "healthy upscale" - I had a paella, my wife
had lean angus beef on rice.  They provide for vegetarians
and gluten-free.  There are appetizers, so the impecunious
could get by on $7 or so.

They have free wifi (WEPed, sigh, but they provide the key).

Huge amounts of parking in the shopping center lot.  They are
about 800 feet from the Sunset Transit Center Max Station.
They are in Washington County, but the mailing address is
10122 SW Park Way, Portland so that still counts as "PLUG",
right?

So...

Most of the current PLUG attendance is guys without childcare
responsibilities.  I don't know how many potential members we
are missing because daddies and mommies can't come.  But if
we can recruit members from that group, I think that would be
worth an extra 30% meal cost.  This might also help us develop
some gender balance.

Please talk with your cow-orkers and friends, and other folks
that don't normally come to plug meetings, and see if this is
an attractive option.  We might try the place out with a
special "family Linux night" and see what kind of response we
get.  This could lead to a fourth meeting per month, focusing
on educational and family Linux topics.  Or, we might alternate
every other month between Advanced Topics at Roots and Family
Linux at Leeth's, providing some respite for Alan.

If this is worth pursuing, I will follow up.

Keith

I like it!! There are a number of Linux folk where I used to work with  
kids of various ages. I'm guessing six months is a little young, but  
there are others. We could probably get the OLPC users' group (I run  
that mailing list) to join us. So ... advanced topics at Roots in  
odd-numbered months and Family Penguin Night with Grandma Leeth in the  
even-numbered months?

Anybody know where I can get a Tux costume? :)

Were there any error messages? It might not have built that module  
("vmnet", I think) correctly. Also, it probably did a "modprobe"  
trying to load the vmnet module. An "lsmod | more" should show it  
loaded. If it isn't there, look for errors in "dmesg" and try a  
"modprobe vmnet".

There's one other thing you might need to look at. After a fresh  
install, there may be a directory "/usr/lib/vmware/modules/binary". If  
there is, move it somewhere before doing the "vmware-modconfig" and  
see if that helps. That's a VMware bug of some kind -- it causes a  
more or less invisible segfault if that directory is present.

> I'm beginning to think that a patch is needed.

If it's the "invisible segfault", yes.

The other question I have, never having been there: is the event space
open to minors?  I know PTP wants to be as inclusive as possible, and
certainly more than welcomes the participation of those under 21.  I am
sure PLUG does as well.  If it is closed to minors, that is a strike
against it.

Speaking for myself, I'd prefer to maintain a more centrally-located
AT talk, and maybe _add_ the Westside night instead of trying to
alternate between multiple locations.  My own experience is that
schedule variation results in fewer attendees.  The more regular, the
easier it is for people to remember to make time for it.

So, count this as a vote for adding a family-friendly night and trying
to maintain a downtown-ish AT meeting.

There's a standard 'Minors admitted until' notice on the main entrance
to the pub.  I didn't note the time.  The meeting space is significantly
separated from the pub space, and has a separate street entrance.
I'll add this to my list of questions.

If it's a regular mail spool file, just use a text editor to open it and
look for anything unusual.

There are no error messages beyond the Virtual ethernet FAILED
message.  I did the move the binary directory thing and yes a
vmnet.o module is loaded.

[root at silene Download]# lsmod|grep vm
vmnet                  39212  0
vmblock                15780  3

vmmon                  64024  0

The vsock module isn't loaded.

wes,

   The distribution upgrade replaced perl-5.8.8 with -5.10.0. However, while
/usr/lib/perl5/site-perl/5.8.8 is filled with files and directories
(including SpamAssassin), the ../5.10.0 directory has only

   How do I migrate everything from the 5.8.8 directory to the 5.10.0

Rich,

What happens if you link the old to the new?  Seems strange they would 
omit most of the packages.

What happens if you run `perl -e 'print "$_\n", for(@INC);'` ?

If you installed all of your modules with the help of the distribution, 
it should have upgraded them.  Otherwise, you should probably have the 
pure-perl modules in a directory without the 5.8.8 (and you could just 
keep using them), but you'll need to reinstall anything with binary 
extensions to get them to link on 5.10.

Hmmm ... I just re-ran the vmware-modconfig:

Starting VMware services:
   Virtual machine monitor                                             done
   Virtual machine communication interface                             done
   Blocking file system                                                done
   Virtual ethernet                                                    done
   Shared Memory Available                                             done
Built vmmon module
Built vmnet module
Built vmblock module
Built vmci module
Built vsock module
DreamScape:~ # lsmod|grep vm
vmnet                  44868  13
vmblock                15744  3
vmci                   55560  0
vmmon                  76000  0
DreamScape:~ # lsmod|grep vs
DreamScape:~ #

So I don't have vsock loaded either, but mine is working. And of course

# /etc/init.d/vmware restart
Stopping VMware services:
   Virtual machine communication interface                          done
   Virtual machine monitor                                          done
   Blocking file system                                             done
Starting VMware services:
   Virtual machine monitor                                          done
   Virtual machine communication interface                          done
   Blocking file system                                             done
   Virtual ethernet                                                 done
   Shared Memory Available                                          done

So I looked at /etc/init.d/vmware and it says there is a log file in
/var/log/vnetlib. That gets appended rather than overwritten, so you
might want to do

cd /var/log
mv vnetlib vnetlib.bak
/etc/init.d/vmware restart

or whatever the equivalent is in Fedora. You should at least get an
error message that way.

Ken,

   It's been the strangest linux week I've had in a dozen years.

   What happens is the system reports that /usr/lib/perl5/site-perl/5.10.0/
is not a file or directory! Really! Yet it exists and holds one
sub-directory.

Sigh,

Rich

Eric,

   This:

[root at salmo ~]# perl -e 'print "$_\n", for(@INC);'

Nothing useful.  The file seems to be /var/log/vmware-installer.
It just has a bunch of gtk errors, nothing related.

That looks like you should still be able to use everything that's not in 
an arch-specific directory (e.g. i486...) under 5.8.8/.

So what's the problem?  (Aside from the fact that you'll need to install 
new versions of anything which *is* in the 5.8.8 arch-specific 
directory -- which is just the way upgrades go.)

Eric,

   One application I tried building barfed at not finding what it wanted in
the 5.10.0 directory. Which one slipped my mind just now because I've been
juggling trying to resolve a half-dozen issues today. I'll identify it Real
Soon Now.

Eric,

   Got it: I was trying to start SpamAssassin after a reboot:

[root at salmo ~]# /etc/rc.d/rc.spamassassin start
/etc/rc.d/rc.spamassassin: /usr/bin/spamd: /usr/bin/perl5.8.8: bad
interpreter: No such file or directory

[root at salmo ~]# ls /usr/bin/perl*
/usr/bin/perl@        /usr/bin/perlbug*  /usr/bin/perlivp*
/usr/bin/perl5.10.0*  /usr/bin/perldoc*

   And I did not see where in SA I need to change 5.8.8 to 5.10.0.

   Perhaps I should just rebuild SA?

   It's been a terribly long week for me.

Rich

Eric,

   All's OK now. When I tried to build the latest SA it complained about
missing modules. I installed them from CPAN, reran the build script, and
installed SA.

Thank you for your help,

Rich

I guess you'll want to try the Fedora and VMware forums. I've seen lots
of posts there on related subjects.

   To close this thread on a happy note: it's all fixed now. After the
Troubles last week when I got the system back up with the new udev system
the PDA would still not sync with jpilot -- except for an exception
immediately after the first successful boot.

   Yesterday's experimentation determined that setting the port to usb:
(which did not work with earlier Slackware releases) now works like a charm.
Doesn't matter to which USB port the PDA is assigned, jpilot sees the
connection and they happily exchange vital bits.

   OK. Got this fixed today. It turns out that the theme I was using caused
all the problems with slow downloads and leaves falling from the link tree.
No idea how or why, but a replacement theme (I decided the first one was
ugly and very hard on my eyes) resolved both issues.

Whew!

Note that this particular error is a matter of the perl *binary* no 
longer existing.  I would typically expect an application to refer 
to /usr/bin/perl and you would maybe have a symlink from there to e.g. 
perl5.10.0.

In any case, the libraries (@INC, and libperl.so) and binary path are 
separate (but all important) issues involved in upgrading.

I'm somewhat surprised that your package manager didn't automatically 
resolve all of that when you upgraded the perl install.

Subject: [PLUG] Two machines versus one
Message-ID: <20090126031352.GA30318@gate.kl-ic.com>

The EEE PC Box is coming along - I reloaded it with Scientific
Linux 5.2 ( ~= RHEL5.2 or CentOS5.2 ) and the video is working
much better.  I have a Win2K VMware Player client running with
Dragon Naturally Speaking - I may recompile the host kernel
with some real time tweaks to see if we can get the accuracy up.

This machine will reside in my wife's office, where she will be
using it for dictations to create patient records.  My original
plan was to set up iptables to block all incoming traffic, only
outbound stuff allowed.  Since it is behind a NAT router, the
only threats are likely to be those carried in by firefox, and
zombied windoze machines on the same internal network.  We need
to make sure the patient records are 99.999% secure.  Right now
patient records are on paper, partly because of security risks
of digital records.  We would like to go digital if we can.

But my wife is not a security geek, and we are both concerned
that in the unlikely event of a successful exploit of a 
net-connected Linux machine, it may go unnoticed.  Not
acceptable.  Yes, you can run software that scans for exploits,
but it is better to have an airgap between the secure data 
and the net.  We can set up something where the data and the
net are not connected at the same time, but if the computer 
gets exploited while net connected, it can copy the data 
when it is not.  Very remote chance, but still there.

So we are considering setting up two machines, one connected
to the net, the other not, and select between them with a KVM
switch.  I'm testing that setup in her office right now.  With
this setup, she will be able to browse the web and do email 
and such with net-connected machine A, and use Dragon and do
secure stuff with isolated machine B, and switch between them
with a pushbutton.

There are problems with the printer sharing device I bought
(it turns out to be a stupid button actuated USB switch, and
HAL starts up a configuration dialog each time it is switched,
fooey!) and the two machine setup will need something more
printer-aware than that.  I am also bothered by the power waste
of two machines, and the inaccessability of machine B for
maintenance (right now, I maintain machine A through a VPN
from my home office).

I suppose another way to do this is to make TWO virtual machines
on host A, one that contains a linux guest running firefox, one
that contains the Win2K guest running Dragon (with net connections
turned off).  If the linux guest gets exploited via firefox, it
stays within the guest.  With the underlying host OS simplified
as much as possible, and set up to provide no services to the
local ethernet segment and potential zombies on it, that might
be suitably secure.  BTW, the Atom N270 used by the EEE PC Box
does not have virtualization instructions, so we can't use Xen.

So the question:  What am I missing here?  Are there good ways to
make one machine secure enough to do surfing and outbound vpn for
ssh, while keeping a VMware Windoze guest acceptably isolated?
Or, are there stupidities to avoid if I must use two machines?

Keith

BTW, physical security - the machines are physically connected
to the monitor, drives embedded behind a metal plate, and the
whole pile will be chained to the desk.  I suppose there could
be somebody a block away looking at this screen through a
telescope, but the windows are dirty!  There are paper records
in the hall, and a copy machine, and there are a few keys to the
office in circulation, so this is not defense-grade security. 
But I'm not looking for perfect security, just pretty good.

Get the vmware-any-any-update117d.tar.gz
Run that.  Works like a charm.  It will patch your vmware-config.pl file 
and allow it to compile a new client.

I don't see disk encryption mentioned anywhere? Which one did you  
decide on, LUKS or TrueCrypt...or something else?

I would say if there is no obvious corruption, it is very likely not a
corrupted mail spool. I would suggest you keep looking.

wes,

   There are a few huge mime attachments (.jpg images, I believe) on one
message. They might be the problem. I deleted a few spam messages from her
inbox and we'll see if the others are sucked across the airwaves to her
laptop.

Thanks for your suggestions,

Rich

Eric,

   'Twasn't the perl package, but the need to upgrade perl modules. I grabbed
the newest version's tarball and when I tried to build and install it saw
everything that needed upgrading. So I upgraded, repeated the build/install
step, and it took. Started nicely and spamd is once again contentedly
humming in the background.

Many thanks for your help,

Keith,

   Seems to me that you need an internal DMZ machine to separate the data box
from the rest of the local network. Any small network appliance should work
for both of you.

Subject: [PLUG] vsftpd + ldap folks around?
Message-ID: <e2aeccd60901260156q5e1c3371gc1fd21a9bb728c4d@mail.gmail.com>

I apologize in advance for the length of the message but I'm trying to
provide as much information as I possibly can.


I have been running openldap for about 5 years now and until now have never
had a problem. Specifically attempting to authenticate an FTP session is
failing in ways that I do not understand.

I am intermittently seeing this happen when attempting an ftp login ( yeah I
know ... from a Windows box -sigh- )

C:\Users\drew\Desktop>ftp
ftp> open techiekb.com
Connected to techiekb.com.
220 (vsFTPd 2.0.5)
User (techiekb.com:(none)): drew
331 Please specify the password.
Password:
500 OOPS: cannot locate user entry:drew
500 OOPS: child died
Connection closed by remote host.
ftp>

What I have been able to track down so far is that vsftpd is now looking for
users in /etc/passwd instead of using LDAP auth. I have LDAP configured via
nsswitch.conf which has worked wonderfully for years. All other services
that use LDAP (SSH, Apache, Squid) are all working fine.

When I don't receive that particular error message, I am able to login
(which tells me that vsftpd is talking to ldap somehow) but it's not pulling
proper group permissions so I can't upload anything to the server nor can
any of the people who are hosted on this machine.

There haven't been any recent package changes. And the configuration files
for vsftpd, inetd (which is what vsftpd was being run from until I decided
to run it in stand alone mode) are the same and nothing has changed in them
in _forever_, the LDAP configs have been changed recently to allow for TLS
support but the FTP service was working after those changes were made and
after LDAP was restarted with the new config, at the time of those changes
FTP was running out of inetd which had also been restarted and was working
fine.

The logs show that up until at least last Tuesday that authentication was
working as expected.

I did do the upgrade of vsftpd/inetd packages for my distro (Slackware) just
for grins and saw the same behaviour and went back to the original stock
packages that shipped with the version I'm running.

I enabled logging for vsftpd transactions and what is weird to me, is that
it shows the request, the response and OK event when the child spawned to
handle my request commits suicide, they seem to indicate that the client is
terminating the connection and not the host which is not the case. When it
*does* authenticate me and I attempt an upload, the logs show an OK status
as well even though the client reports that there was permission denied due
to the fact that the group/user perms aren't being pulled from the LDAP
server.

I'm stumped. I even ran strace on the binary while performing client to
server interaction and didn't see anything that looked out of place for the
behaviour I was seeing.

I have googled for the issue and there are various posts/solutions for it,
none of which have worked in my case. All the documentation I have found so
far indicates that PAM is required for this to work which I know to not be
the case since up until sometime last week apparently it was working fine. I
don't have PAM installed and won't install it unless I absolutely *have* to.
It's ommited from Slackware because of the numerous security flaws its been
a part of in the past, I'm not trying to start a my distro is better then
your distro conversation here though. The less complicated the better and
PAM just complicates things IMHO.

I have even restarted the box on the off chance something else was
interferring and that didn't help the cause either, other then losing 295
days of uptime =*(

Any thoughts, ideas, advice, voodoo chants?

Cheers,
Drew-

P.S.
Rich, we really need to go have that beer or 10.

This morning I follow the steps on:

And ... so far, so good.
the page asserts that PulseAudio is the ESoundD replacement and the default

   It has been written that people tend to take delight when the rich and
famous land in deep doo-doo. I'm not sure that I buy into that sentiment.
However, I am comforted by seeing that I'm not the only one to suffer from
strange problems that come without discernable cause. Not that I want others
to suffer as I have, but because no one can make the case it's all my fault
through ignorance or stupidity.

   Yes, those microbrews are quite appealing about now. (No, not at 6:43am,
but with regard to computer issues resolved and yet-to-be-resolved.)

   Pardon me for jumping in, but my experiences with Slackware may be
applicable to you Ubuntu residents.

   When I need to reboot my workstation all the alsa sound is turned off. I
learned that I need to run (as a user) 'alsamixer' to turn on the sound and
increase the volume. Then it works again ... as long as I remember to turn
on the speakers.

HTH,

Rich

Thanks, I'm not a Linux guru like the rest of you, I just like to build
websites and run Linux. I've been enjoying Fedora 10 64bit and have
discovered a very good lightweight distro: Crunch Bang Linux w/ Openbox
window manager is very nice. :)

The page is essentially right, but the problems are manyfold. 

I have never had problems with sound disappearing on any of my
computers. It has always just worked - even with distros other than my
favorite Ubuntu x86_64. However, after upgrading my laptop from Hardy
to Intrepid I can no longer get sound to my bluetooth headphones. My
other bluetooth devices work fine (phone and mouse), but I haven't been
able to get so much as a beep out of the headphones for over a month.
They are paired up and connect fine but, regardless of the dozens of
fixes I have tried, the sound insists on coming out the speakers.

At the moment pulseaudio has been utterly excised from the computer.
Still no joy, though. All I can get is sound out the speakers. My
current route of inquiry is the confusing maze of stuff that goes on in
bluetooth.

Regarding pulseaudio, there are some optional packages that Ubuntu does
not install. Note, however, that Ubuntu started using pulseaudio with
Hardy and the configuration was the same. Some people have reported
success just by removing it - which is also complicated and I'll
explain how if you decide you want to try it. Pulseaudio does have some
terrific advantages over just ALSA and/or OSS. For example, you can set
sound levels differently for different apps, you can stream sound over
your network, and you can have more than one source playing at the same
time to more than one output device. I could, for example, play Obama's
inauguration speech from one app while having the Stars and Stripes
playing softly from another app, and capture the output with a third
app or device. 

Also remember that pulseaudio is a layer on top of ALSA. As far as I
can understand from the pages and pages of how-tos that I have read you
still need ALSA installed. Thus, you still have to contend with
alsamixer's confusing strangely named sliders and stuff.

Managing cross-domain connections -- in this case, HIPAA and non-HIPAA 
-- is hard. From personal experience I can tell you that the US 
government has put a LOT of money into researching and developing 
cross-domain solutions, but you'll still see

  * naval ships with several completely separate physical networks,
    even though space is at a premium,

  * intelligence employees with two or more computers on their
    desks, each machine connected to a different network (secure,
    secret, top secret, etc),

  * intelligence workers hand-typing data that has to move from
    one domain to another, since machines on one network cannot
    be allowed to operate on another.

Given the current state of technology, two machines is 
probably the safest bet. It's not the most efficient solution, but 
keeping patient data on machines accessible to a public network 
requires huge shovelfuls of vigilance, time your wife probably doesn't 
have to spare.

This is a reasonable solution -- but only if performance isn't a key 
concern and you both are comfortable with VM operations. A relatively 
underpowered Atom processor isn't going to make speed demons out of 
your virtual machines, and it can take some time to learning the in's 
and out's of VM administration.

It's a hard problem. The two-machine solution requires more space, 
more power, and has more breakable parts -- but it probably requires 
the least amount of admin time. A solution running VMs is elegant and 
efficient, except when it comes to administration (and perhaps 
processor utilization).

My bias is to use two machines until you and your wife are completely 
comfortable operating, maintaining, and troubleshooting VM issues -- 
though I'm willing to admit the issue is debatable and others may 
reasonably come to the opposite conclusion.

   The ALSA web site has a trouble-shooting page. Following the step-by-step
instructions has allowed me to fix the sound issues many times.

   On the subject of Ubuntu sound, when I booted the rescue disk made for me
at the clinic by Keith, I heard what sounded like the death rattle of the
splash page's shredded heron. It looks like the logo bird was hit by 3"
magnum #4 goose pellets. Is this the normal Ubuntu sound?

No. 

When the login screen comes up you hear a drumroll - three beats. 

After you log in you should hear a tune that lasts about as long as a
Windows startup tune. I can't remember what it sounds like because I
have had it turned off in System > Preferences > Sessions for a long
time. But it's definitely not the death rattle of a shredded heron.

Just a heads up for local folks... starting a few days ago, I appear to be
blocked on Comcast for all torrent traffic.  Just tested it with the latest
ubuntu distro seeded from ubuntu.org, so it's not about "blocking illegal
content".  I'm on the west side, and I'd be curious to see if it's just me, or
if others are also noticing this.

The symptom is that Transmission (on mac) reports "status 0" when it tries
to contact the tracker.  Normally, this is "status 200", so I imagine
that Comcast is doing deep packet inspection, recognizing the tracker
payload, and somehow replacing that with an empty response.

I haven't tried a torrent download recently, but I'm on the west side
and on Comcast. The "bottom line", though, is that Comcast is in
business to make a profit, and unless "the government" can and will step
in, they will behave in ways that they believe will increase revenues or
lower costs.

I hear FIOS has better bandwidth anyhow. :)

I have a torrent that did not finish but I haven't been trying for the
past couple of days. Just now I launched ktorrent and checked the
tracker window. The torrent in question had two trackers:

torrent-downloads.to:2107/announce
open.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce

The first one connects fine. The second one I get "Unable to connect -
unknown error."

The second one sounds illegal just from the name (it's not). I wonder
if Comcast might be blocking just some domains rather than inspecting
packets. That doesn't explain why they think ubuntu.org is an illegal
provider.

I'm on the east side, near the old Kaiser hospital on Greeley (now
Adidas).

The only event I've been to there was the last BikeCraft fair, and
there were certainly minors present, even though a few people were
walking around with beer.

Here is an article about what Comcast claims it is doing about traffic
management now, after having gotten caught blocking P2P file transfers
and slammed by the FCC.

http://telephonyonline.com/residential_services/news/comcast-congestion-0123/index.html 

Comcast says it's not doing any URL filtering or deep packet inspection,
just congestion management.  If it's being truthful about this, that is.

I switched to vmware server 2.  It's a bit awkward though, I have to
access it through a local web server and it took me a while to figure
out how to get a screen from the virtual machine.  It's a lot more

if I can access the virtual machine from another computer on my
network when I'm using vmware server?

If the virtual machine is set up as "bridged" and all your virtual and  
real network interfaces are working, yes. Just do an "ifconfig" in the  
guest, see what the IP address is, and it should just work.

VMware Server is a lot more flexible than the Player. You can actually  
create virtual machines with the server, while Player makes you create  
them elsewhere. But personally I think Workstation is worth paying for.

After applying the steps described in the link above the system now does audio

(Vivaldi's Spring and the Afro Cuban All Stars are a bizarre mix.)

If you have Ubuntu and sound problems I recommend the pulseaudio fix method

Subject: [PLUG] vmware nat and windows networking...
Message-ID: <1233092928.7507.8.camel@eagle.robinson-west.com>

I have vmware running on two Linux systems, server on one 
and workstation on the other.  I am running ReactOS on one 
box and Windows 2000 on the other.  For some reason, I can 
ping from ReactOS to Windows 2000 but I can't do the 
opposite.  Does ReactOS not implement echo-reply?  I've 
got the routing in my network so that packets end up at 
the correct machine.  I'm using NAT networking on both 
hosts.  One mystery I haven't solved is why I can't access 
shares on the NAT'ed hosts from say a real machine.  Can 
a windows workgroup be stretched across two physical 
subnets?  How about two different networks?

As far as trying to ping ReactOS vm from 2000 vm, I can
see the echo-request packets showing up on the host
machine via iptraf no problem.  It seems that ReactOS
is not generating a reply, yet I can ping it from it's
host system no problem.

I know someone will probably say bridge the virtual machines,
but that would cut off Internet access.

Gnome on CentOS 5 and Fedora 9 has this neat thing under places that
lets me browse the local windows ( or samba for that matter ) network.

Okay, why is it when I click on the samba servers that I don't have
a way to access the user home directories?  From Windows 2000 running
under vmware in bridged mode, the assumption seems to be that the
user I am trying to log into samba as is the user I am now.  The
assumption from the gnome browsing tool seems to be that I don't
browse as a user.  Uge!

I must be missing something.

As an aside, has anyone gotten a Windows style workgroup to work 
where some of the hosts are NAT'ed vmware boxes?

For example, I changed a computer name from foo to bar and for a while

I tracked it down.  Turns out that up until the recent comcast update,
ipv6 travelled safely through my router to the nets.  Apparently, that's
now blocked, and the tracker had an ipv6 address being advertised, which
breaks if ipv6 isn't actually working.  My solution was to turn
off ipv6 on my laptop... when I get more time, I'll also turn it off
in my router so I'm not advertising v6 connections internally.

You might have a look at the "name cache timeout" parameter in
smb.conf(5). I think this is what you're looking for, but I haven't
used it myself. Default is 11 minutes.

Subject: [PLUG] SAMBA config or maybe . . .
Message-ID: <49807BDF.5010906@frankhunt.com>

I recently had to rebuild a broken W2K system and updated it to XP along 
the way.  My environment uses SAMBA on Debian 4.0 for file/printer 
sharing and time services.  From my newly minted XP box, most of the 
"net" commands work fine (net use, net view, etc), however if I do a 
"net view //server2" I get "system error 5 has occurred" and "access is 
denied", innocuous error at best.  net view //any_windows_system works 
fine.  All this works from my other XP boxes so I must have overlooked 
something in the configs.  Ideas, anyone??

BTW, my smb.conf file includes:

server string = SERVER2
security = SHARE
encrypt passwords = yes
nt acl support = no
time server = Yes
socket options = SO_KEEPALIVE TCP_NODELAY SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192
ldap ssl = no

I have changed passwd encryption and acl support back and forth with no 
difference in outcome.  At this point, I must assume that the issue is 
on the XP end, but I have no "proof".

SAMBA log files show:
[2009/01/28 07:20:21, 0] smbd/password.c:authorise_login(795)
   authorise_login: rejected invalid user nobody

Which seems to indicate some user issue.  The user in question is in 
smbpasswd - after all, the mounts work, etc.

Lost as usual

if you use the usbserial driver, they should show up as ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB1

Typically, although depending on the converter chip used, they might
show up elsewhere (e.g. /dev/ttyACM0).  Look in dmesg to see where it
landed with more certainty.

I realize that this wasn't l7 twiddling at Comcast in this case, but
this may be interesting to other users.

Windows XP Home edition or Pro?  If the former, then you need to enable 
guest access or enable per share passwords on the shares you want to 
access from this box. Windows "home edition" cannot be part of a domain 
(read crippled) for authentication purposes since it has no concept of 
user logins.

The 'invalid user nobody' message kinda points that way.

More--> I found that (on this message, anyway), that changing the view to "view
message body as simple HTML",
then "edit as new" worked.  It seems that the original message has some
non-conforming HTML in it.  Likely it
has nothing to do with "access".

-Denis

More still.  Another message does not respond as the one described above.  This 
one presents just place markers for the photos when "forward as new" is used, 
and the same error message occurs when sending (...error attaching...), even 
using simple HTML.  The pictures reside in the same place as above.  I can copy 
them, but cannot figure out how to forward them without copying and attaching 
them to a new message.

I can post the message code if that would be a help (quite large).

Ideas?

Subject: [PLUG] turning off avahi
Message-ID: <20090130022827.GA15124@gate.kl-ic.com>

The distro I use, Scientific Linux 5.0, installs with the avahi
daemon enabled.  Avahi is the open source implementation of
Zeroconf aka Bonjour aka "link local".  Avahi chooses IP
addresses for machines on a network without a DHCP server,
discovers hardware like ethernet-connected printers, etc. 
In the abstract, a fine thing.

In reality, it sucks.  When I operate my laptop unconnected from
the wired network for a few minutes, avahi helpfully assigns an
ethernet address of 169.254.x.x to the port.  Which remains, even
after I plug an ethernet cable back in.  Of course, that address
is not routable on my network, nor can other machines find the
normally fixed DHCP-assigned IP address for my laptop.  That
means I have to stop and restart eth0.  That is broken, IMHO. 

So, I turned off the avahi daemon, and took it out of the boot
sequence.  Sadly,  I am told that the dark gods of dependency
hell have decreed that for the upcoming version 5.3 of my distro,
the cups print management software depends on cups-libs, which
depends on avahi-compat-libdns_sd, which depends on avahi, which
is enabled when it is installed.  Somebody needs a spanking.

What is your DHCP client? Is it assigning the address it discovers to
eth0 when the link comes back up?

Sounds like it's your DHCP client not doing it's job.

Let me first apologize for the post to the list. But I think it's fair
enough to put the info here so it will be archived in case someone else runs
across this issue in the future.

 5 days, many virtual machine re-installs for environment testing, log
reading on the actual machine affected, packing installs, package removals,
restarting daemons, restarting the affected machine, rebuilding packages
from source with different build options, banging my head on the wall,
angrily shaking my fist and cursing ... and I finally found the culprit.

It turned out to be slapd the Open LDAP daemon. What threw me off track was
the fact that no other services appeared to be affected, just vsftpd so I
focused on it. Unfortunately it doesn't provide much useful log information
when logins fail so finding the issue was by sure luck. I ended up greping
the entire /var/log directory for "vsftpd" and found one entry of interest
from January 25th. I believe it was in a log that was overwritten after I
updated a few things tonight to solve the issue but it in effect said
"vsftpd unable to contact LDAP server, decode error".

So googling for LDAP and decode error pointed me to a few posts that said
nss_ldap was the issue, nss_ldap allows for system and service wide
authentication to LDAP databases. So I upgraded to the latest version and
found it still wasn't working, it then occurred to me that maybe it was Open
LDAP itself. Investingating that led me to find that another person who I
allow to administer the machine had done some house cleaning and removed the
version of Berkley DB that Open LDAP was linked against ... AHA!

So I rebuilt Open LDAP against the installed libraries and then nss_ldap
against the newly minted and properly linked LDAP libs and all was well.

All the vsftpd searches for the error I was receiving pointed to issues with
PAM and that PAM was needed for vsftpd to auth against a directory server,
this isn't true. The NSS_LDAP libraries from www.padl.com negate the need to
build PAM support for it which is why it has worked well for so long and
added to my frustration in troubleshooting the issue.

Cheers,
Drew-

p.s. Now I just need to help ressucitate Rich Shepard's machine and life
will be all good once again in Linux Land.

I've been colocated there for more than 5 years.  It used to be okay but
nowadays the service has gone bad in my opinion.  For example, I had two
full cabinets which I no longer use.  When the renewal date approached, I
gave about 40 day advance written notice that I didn't want to renew.  Now
they're trying to make me pay more than $10,000 for the next few years of
service, stating I didn't give them enough notice that I wasn't renewing my
contract.  That's just greed in my opinion.

A long time before that I had a certain amount of bandwidth agreed upon per
cabinet, they later said that no, that was a mistake on their part, and
proceeded to cut my alloted bandwidth by 75% thereby making me pay about
$1000/month extra for bandwidth that I already had in my opinion, and in
writing from them earlier.

The most recent action is an almost 100% price increase for the private cage
i had there.  Their contracts state they can raise their prices by any
amount at anytime and you have no recourse whatsoever.  The only way out is
to pay the entire remainder even if you have years left on your contract.

I had to get a lawyer to deal with them and it's still ongoing.  I know two
other people who were also colocated with Infinity Internet and had similar
experiences, one of whom also had to get a lawyer involved.

IMO, grab your servers and run away as fast as you can.   Try the Pittock
Internet Exchange across the street.

I don't know what is keeping the full message from making it to the 
list, so here's the question without the code sample, in case that's the 
problem.

I thought I'd test for the presence of a file as a way to trigger the 
appearance of the message on a web page. I have created the file (an 
empty .txt file). The code to display or not display the message works. 
During my testing I just renamed the file. However, on my home system 
(Ubuntu running apache), I get this error message: Permission denied in ...

I set the permission for everyone to have read/write access.

How about the directory that the file is contained in?  It needs to be
accessible by the apache user (I'm assuming apache here, as this
sounds like a familiar problem).  Try chowning the directory to 777 as
a test.

I will second Jon's remarks, we used Infinity for several years and 
recently moved to Easystreet because they were so bad.  We had power go 
out in our cabinet 4 times in the last 12 months, and now they are 
trying to make us pay for an additional year saying that we didn't give 
them enough notice about leaving, even though we told them 3 months 
before leaving.  Look elsewhere.  I would recommend Easystreet (they 
even offer an option to run all your servers on green power), but they 
are more expensive.  If you are looking for something comparably priced, 
check out the Integra datacenter located above Whole Foods downtown, 
they were one of the alternatives we considered.

Mandriva, which I run, installs avahi by default as well.  Since I too
don't need zeroconf network discovery, I've simply taken avahi-daemon
out of the init-scripts (actually I turned it off with the system GUI).

That seems to work, though I'd rather remove the avahi package entirely.

Adding NOZEROCONF=yes to /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 also
works to prevent the system from setting 169.254.x.x network addresses.

I agree that distros tacking on zeroconf, wireless and other networking
related packages is a pain - especially when dependencies get involved.

Easystreet is a good one.  If you're on the west side, I'd look at Viawest (
viawest.net) for colo space.  Great service and support, though I admit I'm
a bit biased (I work there and love it).

I see the same problem.  The top image is missing not only on Chrome but 
IE.  Also noticed in Opera that the top image is there but has a black 
background.  Appears that the image type is not recognized.

Thanks for the hint.

So, I need to go back to Energy Trust and ask them how they created that 
jpeg. I don't think the person who sent it is familiar with web 
programming. The original file came with spaces in the filename. (That 
rule still exists, right?)

I added the original file they sent. It doesn't display in IE, Chrome, 
or Firefox. And, it seems to have affected the ability of the Windows 
version of Firefox to display an otherwise working file. My Linux 
version of Firefox still displays the third file, and the first file, 
but not original file ET sent me.

Any image wizards out there know how I can fix it myself?

Are you sure it is a jpeg?  Extensions don't mean nothing.  Try the file 
command on it.  Could be IE or Chrome are trying to handle it as jpeg 
and it is actually something else.

   I had a couple of images that did not want to properly display as .jpg so
I tranlated them to .png and that solved the problem.

I was thinking about exporting it from The Gimp, as a jpeg, again. But 
since the problem is now solved, I won't bother. I will file the idea 
for future reference, though.

I have had problems with images that are saved as cmyk displaying properly
in IE before that was solved by resaving them in rgb.

The original has an Adobe Photoshop tag in it. I suspect the artist is

I found that I could forward the message as an attachment and the recipient gets
