Mike,

   Allow me to explain again: here we use static IP addresses and hosts, such
as the Sony Vaio, use ethernet. This works fine.

   At external, wifi hot spots, dhcpcd (called by wicd-client, too) not only
gets a dynamic IP address for the portable but the server behind the WAP (if
not the WAP itself, but I don't know the specifics of how it works)
_overwrites_ /etc/resolv.conf and puts in its preferred DNS name servers.
That is, it replaces the contents of resolv.conf that are used here with
whatever the remote site server uses. I don't recall what that was at FG,
but the local coffee shop, part of the NETbean coffee shop wifi-profiding
network, assigned two Google DNS server IP addresses: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4.
This content of resolv.conf was set by NETbeans, not by me.

   Does this satisfactorily explain the situation?

   See above and all previous posts where I keep writing that this is exactly
what happens every time a portable computer is conntected to a wireless
network elsewhere. It's been the case for the 15 or so years I've traveled
with a notebook or laptop and it's just what I keep describing in my
messages.

    Just back from another unsuccessful attempt at the coffee shop.

    When the system boots it connects automatically to the shop's wifi server.
The ESSID is 'WEBbeans-Silk Espresso', 'ifconfig wlan0' returns the IP
address 10.5.70.104, broadcast address 10.5.70.255, and netmask
255.255.255.0.

    The kernel routing table (displayed in response to 'netstat -r') has 2
pairs of entries (default and broadcast) for the eth0 and wlan0 interfaces.
For wlan0,
default		10.5.70.1
10.5.70.0	*

    /etc/resolv.conf -- SET BY THE WIRELESS SERVER -- shows
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4

These are Google's nameservers so the WEBbean.com network does not provide
their own DNS servers.

    The access card instructions are to make the connection, then invoke a
browser to enter the provided password and accept their terms and conditions
of use to be allowed access to the 'Net.

    This is where something is broken. No Web page loads with firefox-11.0,
opera-10.61, links, or lynx. Can't load the access page, www.webbeans.com,
or any other page.

    As before, cannot ping any address on the local Class A network (nor any
world-addressible domain name or IP address). Trying to ping the gateway
(10.5.70.1) results in 'Destination unreachable'; trying the namesever
(8.8.8.8) results in 'Destination not reachable'.

    With an IP address, DNS servers, and gateway all assigned by the local
server, what might inhibit loading the 'Net access control page or any other
web page?

Since it is not clear exactly what the problem is, here are some
semi-wild guesses.
Maybe a local dns cache is causing problems. Are you running  dnsmasq
or nscd on the laptop?  Or how about a firewall problem. What does
iptables --list show? I usually use networkmanager, not wicd. Could
wicd be misconfigured?

You say 'netstat -r' has TWO pairs of entries. So you're not disabling the 
ethernet port? What's the full output of 'netstat -r'?

Most likely the ethernet port is being used as the prefered route, and so 
nothing that's not specifically on the wlan network is going out.

Seriously, you're making life way more difficult by trying to use hard-coded 
addresses with interfaces. You can still have fixed addresses, just serve them 
up by DHCP. Then interfaces and routing will "just work", no matter where you 
are.  For instance, what happens if you take your laptop someplace where you 
need to jack into a wired network?

Everything in my house has a fixed IP address, and corresponding entries in the 
bind config files. But nothing is hard-coded - it's all handled by DHCP. When I 
add a new system to the network all I do is find the MAC address and add it to 
dhcpd.conf with an IP address I've selected. I plug the system in and =poof= it 
has the IP address I want it to have.

Bill,

   The problem is the Sony will not connect to any network via the wireless
interface. Here and at three outside 'wifi hot spots' it will be issued a
dynamic IP address (by the WAP, I presume), dns nameserver IP addresses, and
routes to the gateway IP address (by the WAP or the sever behind it).

> Maybe a local dns cache is causing problems. Are you running dnsmasq or

   /usr/bin/dnsmasq is present; there is no dnsmasq in the process list and
every line of /etc/dnsmasq.conf is commented.

> Or how about a firewall problem.

   The portables do not run explicit firewalls.

> What does iptables list show?

   With what option? running 'iptables' returns nothing.

> Could wicd be misconfigured?

   Not likely. The WAPs are all unsecured and wicd connects, gets an IP
address, gateway address, and nameservers. I can run 'dhcpcd wlan0' from the
command line and get the same results.

   Specific question: do WAPs provide gateway IP addresses and set
nameserver IP addresses in /etc/resolv.conf? If not, those must come from a
server on the other side of the WAP from the laptop, correct?

   If gateways and nameservers are assigned from the network server, then the
laptop is communicating to the server via the WAP. In this case, what
portiong of the networking stack is missing and prevents access to the 'Net
or a server Web page?

Rich,
  I missed the clue that you did not get wifi access at home either.
I retract my guesses and concur with John Meissen. Your ethernet
configuration is probably interfering with the wifi.  Is your eth0
configuration set to come up and down automatically when the ethernet
cable is plugged in and out or is it always configured ethernet cable
or not?

Bill

   Without an ethernet cable attached? Are you suggesting that I'm getting a
10.0.0.0 gateway from the wireless network via the eth0 interface with no
cable connecting the two? I don't understand.

> Seriously, you're making life way more difficult by trying to use hard-coded

   Really? Let me repeat: on no portable I've had has the wireless interface
be configured to use anything other than DHCP. The wired interface, eth0, is
used ONLY here in the office and we run static IP addresses on the LAN.
Again, there is no cable attached to the ethernet port so I have difficulty
understanding how any static IP address on that port, or gateways assigned
to it, could affect connections via the wlan0 interface.

> Then interfaces and routing will "just work", no matter where you are.

   Feh! Not true.

   Networking works. This is the situation in the hotel where I stay in Reno.
I plug in their cable to the port in my Dell, run 'dhcpcd eth0' and
... get a local IP address, a re-written /etc/resolv.conf with their
nameservers, and local gateways in the kernel routing table. When I return
to the office I copy /etc/resolv.conf.office to /etc/resolv.conf and I'm
once again connected to my LAN.

   I've used static IP addresses here since 1997 with a bunch of different
desktop machines and 7 different portables (3 Toshibas, 1 ThinkPad, 2 Sony
Vaios, and the Dell Latitude). It is only the new Sony Vaio that has
wireless issues everywhere. Each of the other 6 portables connected
wirelessly everywhere.

   I'm happy you use DHCP, but it's not a universal requirement nor even
necessary in my experience.

   The ethernet interface is RUNNING only when there's a cable attached. On
the Toshiba, Sony, and Dell, ifconfig shows lo, eth0, and wlan0 at all
times. Only lo and EITHER eth0 or wlan0 is RUNNING depending on whether
there's an ethernet cable stuck in the side.

   The configuration of networking on the Sony is exactly the same as it is
on the Dell except for the host IP address; they're both running
Slackware-13.37/x86_64 and both have /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf configured the
same way but for the specific host IP address.

Yes, but apparently the routing information associated with it is still in the 
routing tables. You said so yourself - that there were two default routes, one 
for wlan and one for eth0.

The TC/IP routing software is going to use what it finds in the routing table. 
If the destination doesn't match a specific network in the table, it will look 
for a default route.

If, for some reason, it decides to prefer the eth0 route, that's where it's 
going to send the packet. When it gets to the physical layer it will find out 
it can't actually send it, and the transmission will fail.

If the metric is the same for both default routes then it's very likely it just 
uses the first one, which may or may not correspond to how they're listed on 
the netstat output.

You should only ever have one default route.

Bill,

   Please explain to me how the ethernet interface could interfere with the
wireless interface. I must be missing something critical here because
they're on different interfaces (eth0 and wlan0), and while both are UP,
only one is RUNNING.

Thanks,

John,

   Doesn't the TC/IP software look at the RUNNING interface? In the case of
the Sony, the routing table has a default gateway for wlan0.

> If, for some reason, it decides to prefer the eth0 route, that's where it's
> going to send the packet. When it gets to the physical layer it will find out

   This raises the question of why it would pick the non-running eth0 when
there's a default gateway for the wlan0. And, shouldn't the OS turn off the
eth0 routes when the system boots without an ethernet cable attached?

   Tomorrow I'll trek again to the local coffee shop and bring my Dell along,
too. I'll see what the routing table shows for that. Or, I'll set up my
local WAP (which I set unsecured) and test things here.

   As far as I can tell, both the Dell and Sony have networking configured
the same way.

Thanks,

Rich

No. TCP/IP doesn't know physical interfaces. It knows IP address. How the 
packet gets out onto a physical wire is someone else's problem.

Yes, you have a default gateway for wlan0. But you said you ALSO had one for 
eth0.

Because the routing table says it's available. And either it finds that route 
first, or it has a lower metric...

Normally I would think so, yes.

   OK. That makes sense.

   Tomorrow I'll bring both the Dell and Sony to the coffee shop; the former
has worked for me everywhere I've used it (as long as I don't inadvertently
turn off the radio switch on the front edge). I'll see if I can find
differences.

Thanks,

If they are both configured for the same network, the network stack
doesn't know which one to use.  You hand it a packet with a
destination address.  It says, "hey, wtf?  I have two interfaces that
are configured to deliver to that address!  I give up!" or something
like that.

How about showing us the output of a command that would remove the
PEBKAC issue?

What do:

  $ ip addr

and 
  
  $ ip route

show when it is and isn't working?  Install the iproute2 tools if you
don't have them already.

There can be more than 1 default route in the routing table. This often the
done in a mult-nic configuration as each ip network will have a gateway of
last resort.

The problem here is that your route table has cached the default route for
eth0, eth0 is not connected to any network and that interface is being
preferred either based on metric or just because that interface is listed
in the routing table first based on alphanumeric sequence. Which when I
statically configure eth0 on the same ip net as wlan0, my routing table now
shows eth0 default route listed first...

0.0.0.0         10.0.0.1        0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0
eth0
0.0.0.0         10.0.0.1        0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0
wlan0

The routing table makes the decision on which interface to send packets out
based on metrics. If the default route for eth0 is lower than wlan0 than
that's the interface the routing table sends the packets to. I'm not sure
if metrics are assigned automatically in sequential order by interface name
such that eth0 would always have a lower metric than wlan0.

I did some of my own testing and here's what I've discovered.

1. I added a static ip addr stanza for eth0 to /etc/network/interfaces and
then brought up  eth0 without it being physically connected.

~# ifconfig
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:15:58:82:11:2e
          inet addr:192.168.1.10  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0

Here's the routing table w. 2 default routes on different nets with both
Default Routes have a metric of 0:

:~# route -n
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use
Iface
10.0.0.0        0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0         U     0      0
 0 wlan0
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0       U     0      0        0
eth0
0.0.0.0         10.0.0.1        0.0.0.0                   UG    0      0
     0 wlan0
0.0.0.0         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0                 UG    0      0
   0 eth0

Traceroute shows packets are being routed out wlan0 interface:

:~# traceroute www.google.com
traceroute to www.google.com (74.125.127.104), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1)  2.000 ms  1.997 ms  2.060 ms
 2  * * *
 3  te-0-0-0-6-ur03.troutdale.or.bverton.comcast.net (68.85.150.177)
 10.373 ms  16.574 ms  17.475 ms

So, it seems you have a stale route table cache entry for eth0 that is
buggering up your routing.

I suspect if you run  a traceroute you'll see packets attempting to go via
eth0?

What happens if you run this command to flush the routing table cache and
then connect to the wlan?
"ip route flush scope global type unicast"

Oddly enough, even with 2 default routes on the same ip net, packets are
still be routed through wlan0. I didn't expect this to be the case. Maybe
the superior intelligence of Debian? ;-P

   Today I'll capture the display of 'route -n' and post it here. What I saw
yesterday as the default gatewey for wlan0 was 10.5.70.1 and the default
gateway for eth0 was 192.168.55.4.

while making some connection attempts to verify if or if not traffic is
traversing that interface.  Also, if it was not mentioned in earlier posts,
the correct way to verify iptables is "iptables -L".  You might also want
to manually inject something like the OpenDNS public DNS servers to use in
/etc/resolv.conf (*208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220)*

This is probably normal, as the network is probably configured to not allow you to connect to anything until you accept the Terms and Conditions agreement. This would include other IPs on the local network, except for the server that provides the T&C. 

Have you verified with another patron as to what their DNS servers are set to? If you've answered this previously, I've missed the answer.

Russell,

   No one else with a computer when I'm there. And, I suspect they'd look
completely puzzled because they have no idea what 'DNS server' means. :-)

Well, I also noticed in a message post what I replied to that you plan on taking both the working Dell and the non-working Sony to compare. That should facilitate finding the answer to that question. 

I just find it highly irregular that they would specify a DNS server that is external to the network, and then give a domain name that would require a call to that DNS server, before you are allowed to pass traffic through the gateway. These networks have to have their own DNS server, or at least a proxy DNS server to redirect traffic until you've accepted the T&C. Otherwise, the whole security model breaks down. 

And yes, I use the term "security model" very loosely.

Rich,

I am wondering what permissions you leave the resolv.conf file in when 
you create it in the rc.local for your home.  Does your network manager 
have access to the file afterwards?

> Russel - This was my suspicion where things were breaking down too. But,
consider this. When Rich's DHCP client receives a quarantined ip addr from
the local subnet there's no tcp/ip communication per se. An DHCP request
goes out and then an ip address and additional info is assigned. At that
point a tcp/ip redirect should happen via the DHCP server on the WAP to
send any ip and/or http traffic to the captive portal page

But if the first ip packets from Rich's computer go out eth0, they will
never make in to the WAP DHSP server and be redirected to the captive
portal. It's possible, depending on how the captive portal works and how
it's configured that a call to an internal DNS server doesn't need to
happen.

I'm curious if Russell Senior or anyone else involved with Personal Telco
wifi ap setup can weigh in on how the the captive portal works for their
WAPs and if a local DNS call is made or not.

We don't even know for sure that the cafe Rich is going to has a
captive portal.  They are fairly unusual in coffee shop scenarios
these days, since small operations mostly just buy an AP and plug it
in.  I understand that FreeGeek is using NoCatAuth (as we do), but I
have no idea about Rich's random coffee shop.

I'm still leaning towards the PEBKAC theory, or some custom
"foot-ventilation", but without objective diagnostics, it is
impossible to say.

*If* the problem is related to a captive portal, you probably do *NOT*
want to use public DNS servers, since access to those will be blocked
until you've negotiated the captive portal.  Of course, we don't know
that a captive portal is even implicated here.

However, the wlan0 interface IS getting a response from the DHCP server, or it would not have an IP address. 

Nothing would be going out eth0, since it's not connected to anything, and, as per Rich's message, it's not in a running state. As I recall, the IPs Rich reported are in two different subnets, so, in theory, the IP stack should try both routes, if there are two routes in the routing table. 

Rich has also stated the host name (not the IP address) of the captive portal T&C page. This would require at least one call to some DNS server, to give the network stack someplace to go. 

My theory is that something is not setting the resolv.conf properly. This could be caused by a race condition. As I recall, Rich has a resolv.conf that gets swapped in by rc.local. If the network finishes configuring prior to rc.local running, then it's possible that rc.local is overwriting the DHCP configured resolv.conf. Then, once DNS is broken, everything appears broken. 

Then again, I might be all wet.

Yes, the DHCP client, which sends out a DHCP broadcast on the WLAN is
getting a DHCP response back in wlan0. But, if it's in fact a captive
portal, then Rich's laptop will have an ip addr on a quarantined subnet
that is managed by the dhcp server. He would need to then have ip
connectivity back out through wlan0 to the wap/dhcp server to be redirected
to the captive portal page.

But I think the strongest clue that it's most likely an ip connectivity
issue is the fact that he can't ping the default gateway, which is probably
the WAP, dhcp server, router, captive portal all in one. This tells me his
laptop is isolated from the network.

Routing is done based on the routing entries in the routing table. The
routing algorithm doesn't take into account whether the interface is
connected. If there's an route entry defined in the routing table for a
disconnected interface the routing table manager will use it in it's
routing decision for a locally connected network. Dynamic, higher-end
routing protocols not withstanding.

"In theory, the IP stack should try both routes, if there are two routes in
the routing table."

Routing works by way of longest match, meaning the most specific route. If
there's no specific route defined for the dest ip addr, then packets are
routed out via the default gateway. If you have 2 default gateways, one
will take precedence.

The only time that theory is true, is if it's a broadcast message, such as
DHCP, where the packets are broadcasted out all the interfaces. The point
of a router and routing protocols is to have some intelligence around which
packets get routed out which interfaces. Otherwise, we'd just build the
internet by connecting a bunch of hubs together and have one big LAN.

Mike, Russell J, Russell S, et al.:

   In my naivte about the subtleties of wireless networking I'm floundering
in a sea of good ideas offered by all of you. Obviously, my knowledge is but
a small fraction of what's needed to resolve this issue.

   I am willing to bring the Sony and my Dell to any wifi hot spot in the
area to meet one of you and have you work with me in figuring out the
problem. It will probably take only a short time to fix with someone who
knows much more than do I about wireless connectivity at the keyboard.

   The location is probably immaterial; the coffee shop on the corner of
242nd and Stark is where I've been. My friend tries to connect at a coffee
shop in downtown Gresham. I'll drive to Portland to meet anyone willing to
devote the time to work this out ... and I'll buy the coffee (or lunch).

if you want to drive to the tigard region, I'd be happy to take a shot at
it. I don't know much about wireless, but I do know about network routing
and that seems more the area you're having trouble with. Either way, I may
be able to spot trouble that has flown under your radar.

Until Easter Belgian Abbey beer would count as lunch.

Hi Dick,

Normally it isn't recommended to grab just any .deb off of a web site
and try to install it.  That is because it may be built for some
version of Debian or Ubuntu that is not the same as what you are
using.  You *can* do it, but it is one of those things you do only "if
you know what you are doing".  


> When I try to install it I get an error message:

> Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: libmozjsld (>= 1.9~b4)

In your URL above, that package is likely for an old version of
Debian (named lenny), so a recent version of ubuntu doesn't have the
proper supporting libraries (causing your error).


Instead, try running:

  sudo apt-get install freewrl

Failing that, run synaptic or aptitude and search for the package.
The name may have changed slightly, but read the package descriptions.
On my Debian unstable distribution, that package isn't available.  It
may be that it has been supplanted by a newer package by a different
name.  You could search the package list for "vrml" and "x3d" and see
what comes up.  You could also search around on freshmeat and
sourceforge for alternative packages and then check aptitude/synaptic
for those names.

Note that in aptitude, you may search by regular expressions, so
"free.*wrl" would match "freewrl" and "freeANYTHINGwrl".  Not sure
about synaptic.

Hope that helps,
tim

If you would only provide the little things I ask for, the verbatim

E.g. if you paste these into a shell, and then email PLUG the contents
of the for-plug log files:

  script -c 'echo ip addr ; ip addr ; echo ip route ; ip route ; echo iwconfig ; iwconfig' for-plug.log

  script -c 'for i in $(ip route | grep default | cut -d" " -f3) 4.2.2.2 ; do echo ping $i ; ping -c5 $i ; done' for-plug2.log

  script -c 'echo lspci ; lspci ; echo lsmod ; lsmod' for-plug3.log

Mike,

   I work from home and have enough to do to keep me busy longer than I want
to work each day, so any time will work for me.

   My work phone is 503-667-4517, cell phone 503-730-1423; I can provide
directions or meet you some place between where you are and Troutdale.

Thanks,

Rich

Yet when Rich was at the last Clinic my laptop (Fedora 16) was
connected to the Free Geek wireless without a problem, and nevertheless
we failed to figure out how to get his to connect. And when I say mine
was connected without a problem, trust me when I say that I know zero
about how this stuff works. If I can get my laptop connected just by
cluelessly poking at GUI stuff, then there is something indeed strange
going on.

I have been following this thread, albeit without understanding most of
it. I do note that several command line diagnostics have been
suggested. Were Rich and I at the Clinic again we could run those
commands on my computer and his and see where they produced different
results. This might at least give us a clue where the problem lies.

I also want to thank Rich for sharing his pain with PLUG. Per aspera ad
astra (through difficulties to the stars). Tough problems are learning
experiences for everyone.

   Running 'ifconfig -a' showed routes for both eth0 and wlan0, but only the
latter was RUNNING. So, as root, I ran 'ifconfig eth0 down' to remove the
routes and ... voila! That was the problem.

   I've run linux on the previous 6 portables and did not have this issue
with any of them, including my older Sony Vaio. But, this new Sony Vaio does
have this issue.

   Now, what I'd like from you networking gurus is a script I can put in
rc.local to test if wlan0 is RUNNING. And, if it is, to take down eth0. This
way eth0 is taken out of the stack when the system boots and dhcpcd sees a
WAP, but otherwise it is turned on and RUNNING to use the attached cable.

   Such a script is needed for the Sony's user because it requires no
knowledge or skill to properly set up the networking interfaces.

Thanks very much to all of you,

Rich

   Garmin makes its maps available on in Microsoft and Apple formats.
Winehq.com does not explicitly show that Garmin's BaseCamp map manipulator
works under Wine. Has anyone here tried this?

   I want to load topographic maps of a few states in a Garmin Oregon 450

What I used to do when I had a Windows requirement was I would use one of the vmware freeware versions to run a virtual machine. Of course, this requires a legal license for Windows, since you are running authentic Windows.

I'm glad to hear you got this sorted out. If the interface is down (not
running) any routes for that interface should not be included in the
routing table. Which is what confused me and why I thought you had a stale
route table cache entry.

I cannot get my eth0 to go in / out of the "running" state by running ifup
/ ifdown, although it works with the loopback interface.

Also, two default routes on the same network and I have no problems.

:~# netstat -r
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt
Iface
10.0.0.0        *               255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0
wlan0
10.0.0.0        *               255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0
eth0
default         10.0.0.1        0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0
eth0
default         10.0.0.1        0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0
wlan0

So if the only difference between your two laptops in terms of wireless, is
the radio and more importantly the driver. Which you had problems with
previously. I'm inclined to believe that driver is not functioning the way
it should be.

It shouldn't be in a "running" state unless there is physical connectivity
and packets are flowing across the interface.

As for the script idea, why not just remove the "allow-hotplug eth0"
statement from your /etc/network/interfaces file

allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

"When the Linux kernel detects the physical interface eth0, the *
allow-hotplug* stanza causes ifup to bring up the interface."

That should keep the interface down and trouble free. Then just plug in the
cable and "ifup eth0".

Did you ever try the Win VM with KVM?  I'm about to and if there are

   I have a working script. It uses 'ip' to show what's on wlan0 and brings
eth0 up or down depending on the results.

   Same here with all hosts other than this one Sony Vaio.

   The eth0 interface is not RUNNING, but the routes are there and so is the
constipation.

   'Cause Slackware doesn't have that file. We have /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf
where the ethernet and wireless interfaces are configured (but the latter
isn't in any case).

   May well be a still-immature driver since this version of the wireless
chip came out only last November.

   I need a script to keep things simple for the user. And, I have such a
script using 'ip' which I did not know existed before.

Russell,

   Once upon a time I had VMware workstation installed with win98se. No
longer. Even if I did, I doubt the Garmin software would run on such an
ancient winduhs. Guess I'll see what eBay has.

Michael,

   No, I hadn't. I'll go look for information on KVM on my 64-bit portable.
If it does a basic impression of Windows that should do the trick.

Thanks,

Michael,

   Don't I need a winduhs licensed OS to install when running quemu-kvm?

Rich,
The question was directed to Russel, who has done this or so I hoped.

A Windows license or reasonable facsimile thereof is required for an 
Win install on any VM.  No magic there.

   That's what I figured.

   Perhaps the best solution is to ask my sister if I could install the
Garmin stuff on her machine, then copy what's needed to the GPS receiver.
Since I have no use for win otherwise there's no need to spend money
unnecessarily.

Thanks,

Rich

   OK. I found such on craigslist. Will then learn to get gemu-kvm working on
my Dell Latitude and put the win7 on there just for map transfer.

Actually you are wrong on this point.  As you stated earlier today, once
you 'ifconfig eth0 down' things worked.  If that was truely the case then
the interface was up but
without a carrier.  The routes would remain intact as the kernel doesn't
know when or if the network carrier will return.

I'm late to the comments here and probably taking this in a different
direction.

Have you looked at any tools that could do this under Linux?
I did a quick search and found this tutorial for Ubuntu.

Larry,

   I'm not a network admin so when I see that an interface is up but not
running I assume it's not working. What I uderstand you tell me is that
regardless of whether an interface is running, if it's up the kernel sees
it.

   The Dell, and previous portables, have all been configured the same way
and this issue never came up. Next time I have the Dell at a wifi hot spot
I'll look at the routing table and see what it shows.

Thanks,

Rich

Message-ID: <CAArUT0i65eEW+QC-sJUiNyvCGPaa5C5PkaysAVjQ1TtOAN9tGw@mail.gmail.com>

I have a little routine which reports the value
in /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/voltage_now.

The battery for this netbook is listed as 10.8 V, 6 cell. Assuming Li PO4
with a voltage of 3.6 V matches this (2 parallel; 3 series).

The readings I get indicate just about 12 volts when fully charged.
 Anybody have any idea what is going on?  The readings indicate a
resolution of 2 mV.  This implies a little more than 12 1/2 bits.  Does
this seem reasonable?  [This same routine on an ASUS eee pc 900 showed a
resolution of 9 mV.]

My purpose is to understand the % charge remaining reported by the battery
monitor.

Thanks,

-Denis

I think it's behaving that way do the static ip config of eth0.

With a static ip addr config for eth0 in /etc/network/interfaces, ifup /
ifdown will insert and remove the default route. However, the state as
shown by ifconfig never shows as "running" because there is no carrier.

However, if there wasn't a static ip addr config for eth0 and it was up I
would expect no routes for that interface to be injected in the routing
table because there's nothing configured and with no carrier, the eth0
interface isn't learning any routes to propagate.

Yes, you are correct. A static config won't take the interface down so it
won't flush the routes.

Rich, you might look for documentation on the Virtual Machine Manager,
which both Red Hat and Ubuntu use as a GUI front-end for managing KVM.
It's from the virt-manager RPM at least on RHEL 6, and is pretty
intuitive (aka, I don't think documentation is that important for it,
but some is available at virt-manager.org). The command line tools are
based on virsh and virt-*.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,

   OK. Slackbuilds.org has a GUI front end, too. I'll build and install that.

   (IMO, 'intuitive' means one's learned the interface. Only the nipple is
intuitive, everything else is learned. :-) )

Hi Rich,

I don't personally use ArchLinux, but I find their documentation on 
'ArchWiki' to be quite thorough and up-to-date compared to the other 
popular projects.  I will often check there first.  See if these might 
assist you:

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/QEMU
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/KVM

The Gentoo Linux wiki also has detailed entries on both topics.

Best,
-EJ

As others have mentioned, the libvirt stuff is a great place to start. 
I've never installed Windows into KVM from an optical drive, but I 
have installed it from an ISO of the Windows DVD (produced by using 
dd). Here's a script that uses the virt-install tool:

virt-install \
   --name="winguest" --ram="1024" --vcpus="1" \
   --os-type="windows" --os-variant="winxp" \
   --disk="path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/winguest.img,size=20" \
   --cdrom="/usr/local/src/winxp-sp2.iso" \
   --vnc --hvm --accelerate

The virt-manager tool also has some facilities for installing VMs, but 
I've always used virt-install.

Paul, Dwight, EJ:

   I downloaded and built aqemu, the GUI front end from slackbuilds.org.
It'll do the job.

   Someone also suggested that I could just copy the maps over from the
workstation, but they come as self-installing .exe files from
gpsfiledepot.com. So, since I bit the bullet and bought a copy of win7/home
I might as well use it.

Thanks everyone,

Rich

I believe I was wrong about the Li Fe PO4, but correct about the 3.6V
nominal per cell.  But the maximum charge voltage is 4.2V, so seeing near
12V is not too far out of line.  Now if I assume the lower limit on (safe)
cell voltage is 3V, I can set my routine to read down to 9V and get
meaningful data.

The registrar doesn't matter.  It's the DNS configuration that points names to addresses.

Having said that I prefer Gandi because of the EULA and over a decade of positive experience.

   Dick can use namecheap.com's public DNS servers for this. I have two
domains pointed to the same IP address (which Frontier changes 3-30 times
per night). I've had excellent tech support and response from namecheap;
then again, I moved the two domain registrations to them so I'm on their
other DNS sever system.

Subject: [PLUG] Finding and mounting a second SATA drive
Message-ID: <4F7F14BA.7020208@comcast.net>

When my wife walked into her home office this morning she was greeted 
with an acrid smell and found that her computer was not running. We're 
guessing power supply, but will let the folks at Pacific Solutions make 
sure it's not something in addition to that.

While I have convinced her to do backups, she does not do them as often 
as I think she should. Knowing that her machine might have to sit with 
Pacific Solutions for more than today I offered to pop her drive into my 
USB drive box and get a few files for her. I opened up her machine and 
found a SATA drive. My drive box is for IDE drives. Sigh.

Next, I remembered that my "new" desktop also has a SATA drive. I 
powered down, opened up, connected her drive to a spare SATA connector 
on the mother board, plugged in the drive power and rebooted.

Now for the real problem: How do I find that second drive? I did a bit 
of Googling and found fdisk -l. But that only shows my drive:

$ sudo fdisk -l

Disk /dev/sda: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 60801 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier: 0x0007d83e

    Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda1   *           1       59628   478959616   83  Linux
/dev/sda2           59628       60802     9424897    5  Extended
/dev/sda5           59628       60802     9424896   82  Linux swap / Solaris

I didn't find /dev/sdb or anything similar.

This is now an educational exercise since I put her drive back in her 
machine and she has taken it to Pacific Solutions, but I'd still like to 
know what I'm missing in case the issue arises again.

I would start by looking in the BIOS of your machine - the drive should
appear there. if not, it may be disabled or have some other issue.

Subject: [PLUG] Video Jitters
Message-ID: <4F7F170B.3090700@comcast.net>

This seems to be my week for hardware issues.

I have been running two monitors for a few months. One is a Samsung 
SyncMaster 712N. The other is a ViewSonic BG2030wm. A couple of days ago 
the ViewSonic started blanking briefly, but then was okay. Then it 
developed the jitters -- a shaking of the image left to right, but over 
a very short distance. Powering off and back on fixed it a couple of 
times, but then the jitters returned constantly.

I have grown very accustomed having two monitors. Fortunately a friend 
gave me another SyncMaster 712N, which I have now put into service in 
place of the ViewSonic. It's better than having only one monitor, but 
the ViewSonic was a much bigger screen. I'll live, but I'd like to have 
the ViewSonic back, if it's not to hard (or expensive) to fix.

So, does this sound like a fixable thing?

Does it sound like a relatively inexpensive fix?

Any recommended monitor service shops?

It's been so long since I've had to mess with hardware that I forgot 
about looking for the drive in the BIOS. I'll save this in my collection 
of hardware issues e-mails so I can refer to it the next time.

Alas, it turns out something on her mother board fried the hard drive. 
So I still wouldn't have seen the drive in the BIOS. The tech at Pacific 
Solutions speculated that it could have been a power surge. She does 
have a battery backup/surge protector. So if there was a surge it was 
supposed to stop it.

How does one test or examine a surge protector to see if it failed?

Dick,

   Two options: 1) 'less /proc/partitions/' will show all drives, and B)
'tail -f /var/log/messages' will show you what's connected or disconnected
as the change occurs.

More likely the power supply failed, and created a surge internally. Not 
something an external surge protector would handle.

I've had a number of systems fail that way in the past. In most cases I was 
lucky in that it just took out the CPU and left the peripherals. Most of those 
systems were cheap eMachines. In fact, every eMachine I've ever owned 
eventually failed that way.

I've always had good luck with 'dmesg | grep [hs]d'. There's some noise to filter through, but that should display any drives attached to a sata, pata or scsi bus.

Could be connector noise - what you are seeing is horizontal
sync not getting through.  Try reconnecting the video cable,
and look for corrosion on the cable pins.

Inside the monitor, it could be dust, or more corrosion on internal
connectors.  Beyond that, it is unlikely that you will fix it,
unless you board-swap with another identical Viewsonic with
different problems (like bad pixels or a burned-out backlight).

But I'm betting on connector corrosion.  We've had a lot of 
rain, your office may be higher humidity than normal, so this
is a likely time of year for corrosion problems to appear. 
Hot times of year, dust/ventilation/heat problems are more
likely.  Very cold times of year, furnace cycling, blower
motor starts, and voltage sags can bollix electronic power
supplies.  Leaving equipment on for months, then turning
it off for a couple of weeks of vacation, will also stress
power supplies (moisture bakes out, then re-enters).

Manufacturers are plating connectors with just enough
corrosion protection to make it across the Pacific, not
enough to last very long here in the Pacific NorthWet. 
In a consume-and-throwaway culture, most people just have
a tantrum, discard their old electronics and buy new, with
more pixels and megabytes and useless features.  Please
dispose of your used planet in the nearest trash receptical.

Thanks for all the ideas. I'll file them away for future reference. As I 
mentioned, the problem was a bad drive. While we don't have perfect 
backups for her machine, we do have backups. I'll try to get her to do 
hers more frequently.

I was using her machine for backing up my stuff. I now have a 160 Gb 
drive in my USB drive box where I have put the important stuff this 
morning. I'll continue to give her a place on my machine to put her 
backups, and make copies of that stuff on the USB drive when I do mine. 
I usually leave it powered off and disconnected, thus relying a very 
large air gap surge protector.

I'll take a look. Back in my Prime Computer days I learned how to use a 
Pink Pearl eraser to clean card edges. That's a bit too big for cable 
pins. I think I still have some "radio and TV cleaner" up on a shelf. If 
I sprayed some of that on a q-tip I might be able to get to the pins on 
the cable. I'll give that a try. I don't know how I'll get at the 
sockets, though. This is a DVI connector. The cable has the pins on both 
ends. The monitor and the video card have the sockets.

The card is now driving my second SyncMaster through a DVI to VGA 
adapter plug. No jitters. So, if it's not the cable, it must be the 
monitor. In the past there have been times when just unplugging and 
plugging a cable rubbed off the corrosion. I'll have to give that a try, 
too.

Thanks for the ideas.

This comes up here from time to time. A couple of years ago I called
around and found a guy that can at times repair old failing monitors.

He replaced some caps in a 19" Hitachi 751 CRT monitor for $50 and it
has been working great ever since. He even picked up and returned it.

Another old monitor I'd got at Free Geek for $20 he could not repair,
he said, but he didn't charge me anything to look at it and I let him
keep it for parts.

I cannot read his handwritten name on an old receipt, but his phone
number was 503-860-8268. If you call him, tell him I sent you. YMMV.

Good luck!

Hmm, doing a "+linux +lilo +doc" Google search gave me four hits.  :-)

It might help if we knew what kind of Linux setup you were working
with.  Is there a reason you want to go with the old boot loaders?
Even Fedora has finally gone to Grub2.  :-)

Oooh, high speed paper tape.  Such fond memories of booting the PDP-11
at work off of a Remex reader-punch that had no takeup reel.  It was
designed to make a mess on the floor.  :-)  And core memory!  DVST
terminals!  Toggling the boot loader into the system from the front
panel switches!  300 baud acoustic-coupler modems!  (Is that horrific
enough, do you think?)

It is likely the system power supply - the motherboard only makes 
milliwatt signals, not watts of power.  In really rare cases, a
signal driver might make enough power to roast one of the tiny
high speed signal interfaces on the drive, but those are designed
to take large static spikes - the drivers on the motherboard 
would fail first.  OTOH, this is all speculation.

The most likely failure for the system power supply is the 
electrolytic capacitors at the output - cheap ones fail,
and the output can spike.  If the power supply is dusty,
the electrolytics can fail faster.  If the supply gets hot,
electrolytics can fail faster.  A power surge can kill the
supply dead, but it is hard to imagine it making it through 
complex electronics to spike the outputs.

This is a reminder to me to move my backup drives onto a
different power supply than the main drive.  They used to be,
then I got lazy.

The machine was about six years old. Does what you just described 
suggest that it would be a good idea to blow the dust out of a power 
supply -- and perhaps the rest of the box -- once every so often? The 
box sat on a board on the carpet the floor. It does get dusty down 
there. My wife's new machine is a rather small Lenovo box that sits on 
her desk under a riser on which her monitor sits. It should be less 
dusty up there.

Odd thing. My wife and I have been using each other's machines for 
backup purposes -- at least I have. She thought she was putting some 
stuff on my machine when she was actually putting some stuff in a 
directory on her machine that I used for backups. I'm thinking I need to 
add one of those network storage boxes to our home network so our 
backups won't be on either machine. As mentioned yesterday, I have my 
USB drive, which I keep disconnected. But disconnected means it takes an 
extra step to do the backing up, and I'd like to make it simpler for 
her. Alas, she also insists on using MS Word and Express Scribe for her 
transcribing work; she doesn't like LibreOffice and the transcription 
program I'm using. So, a networked box that Win7 can talk to will be a 
requirement.

BTW - How this fails, as an aid to understanding:

All computers contain "switching" power supplies - the line
power is rectified, stored in large capacitors, then made into
a medium frequency (around 100 KHz) "rectangular wave", banging
back and forth between positive and negative.  The voltages are
around 400V - lethal!

By changing the time ratio between the positive and negative 
half of the pulse, a regulator circuit changes average values
of output to compensate for variations in input voltage, as
well as the droop of the voltage stored in the capacitors between
the 2 times 60Hz charging pulses.

By using a high frequency, switching power supplies can use 
smaller transformers to turn the 400V into the 5 and 12 volts
that the supplies make.  The signals on the output are "AC",
centered around zero, and the positive end of the signal is
selected with a rectifier (or in more sophisticated power 
supplies, a transistor switch).  the output of the switch
bumps up and down, when the signal is present or absent.

After the switch or rectifier, we need to make a steady DC
voltage out of that bumpy one.  We filter it with capacitors
and inductors.  Inductors rarely fail, but the capacitors are
getting hammered with big current spikes in, followed by the
current drain of the disk or motherboard - for disks, the
current drain is also highly bumpy.  And that stresses and
heats the capacitors. 

Cheap capacitors fail over time; they heat up and the magical
electrolytic juice inside either evaporates or is chemically
transformed into sludge.  The capacitors no longer store as
much energy, and their output bumps up and down.  The valleys
cause electronics to forget - the peaks can fry electronic
devices.  These peaks and valleys are happening thousands of
times a second;  you won't see them with a voltmeter, and
need an oscilloscope to really see what is going on.  

First-rate server grade components wear out more slowly,
and have designed in spare capacity, so they will take
longer to fail.  Advertising claims and reputation
manipulation don't make a system server grade; those
of us who aren't experienced power supply designers
(including me) will have a hard time detecting second
rate or counterfeit capacitors and other components.

We want the most trustworthy power supply we can afford
 - if only we could figure out what was trustworthy. 
With outsourcing and rebranding, your Antec Green Watt
800XYZ power supply might be coming from factory A in
Thailand one week, and factory B in Shenzhen the next,
and the components inside the supplies will have a
similar varied history.  You are relying on Antec to
police the supply chain, and they are up against some
very clever people happy to make shoddy substitutes in
return for kickbacks from vendors.

I met a reliability engineer who works at one of Apple's
iPad assembly plants in China.  The iPads are made
from components sourced from more than thirty countries.
The assembly plant has over 500 in-line automated test
stations.  Ex-pat engineers watch every step.  Apple's
walled garden no-add-ons "our way or go away" attitude
limits choice but also removes uncertainty.  Still,
garbage can leak through (starting with stupid decisions
in Cupertino).

The only way I can see that would establish trustworthy
systems is a completely transparent supply chain.  You
should be able to go online with the model and serial
number and trace all the components back through the 
supply chain, identifying every supplier and material
source.  Armed with that, and field failure history, you
(or your quality measurement software) could identify
the incompetent or corrupt manufacturers, managers,
even line workers, on the spot, in the store, and buy
the slightly more trustworthy unit out of all the
supposedly identical units.  Once that got going, it
would rapidly push back through the chain, rewarding
quality and punishing the crapmeisters.  

But then, very few people care about this stuff, and buy
any highly advertised piece of junk they imagine will
cause their neighbors to envy them.  See:

Message-ID: <20120408231456.4eb85cc8@mailhost.pdx.edu>

Not the deep space kind; the penguin kind.

Ages ago, in my Ubuntu days, I used alien a few times to convert
an .rpm to a .deb package. Once or twice it actually worked. And I
dimly recall that it was supposed to work the other direction as well.

So here I am today on Fedora needing to install a program that is
available only as a .deb package, or install from source. I have tried
installing from source half a dozen times in the past, and have yet to
do so successfully. Installing from source is a last ditch desperation
effort. It would be a lot easier if I could convert the .deb package to
an .rpm package.

Not only is alien not installed on my Fedora 16 computer, but it is not
even in the repos. I searched (with Yumex) on ".deb" and found that both
apt and dpkg were in the repos, so I installed them. The information for
each package in Yumex was not clear about exactly what purpose they
might serve on a Fedora computer, but I did quickly discover that dpkg
(not surprisingly) will not install a .deb file.

Is there an equivalent of alien that I can use on an .rpm based distro?

Cleaning the contacts may have worked. When I disconnected the ViewSonic 
from the computer I replaced it with another Samsung. The Samsung is VGA 
only, so I put in a DVI to VGA adapter. That act may have cleaned the 
contacts on the video card. The ViewSonic also has a VGA socket, so this 
morning I moved the VGA cable from the Samsung to the ViewSonic. Once I 
powered up the ViewSonic worked as before -- no jitters.

I guess I don't really know if the problem was dirty contacts on the 
video card, or dirty contacts on the DVI port of the monitor, or 
something else inside the monitor. But I'm happy that it's working again 
because I had grown accustomed to having the 1680 x 1050 monitor next to 
a 1280 x 1024 monitor. I have a couple of applications that need the 
extra width to work well.

Thanks to all for the advice.

   Still don't have the Sony Vaio working with wireless hot spots, but know
why and would like your ideas on how to remedy the problem.

   When I invoke wicd on my Dell Latitude and it connects to the WAP eth0 is
brought down ('ifconfig eth0 down' in Slackware) so the only network
interface in the kernel routing table is wlan0.

   When I invoke wicd on the Sony Vaio and it connects to the WAP eth0
remains UP. It's not RUNNING, but it shows a gateway in the kernel routing
table that is preferred to the gateway on the wlan0 interface.

   The Sony Vaio has ifplugd installed. This brings up and takes down eth0
when the ethernet cable is inserted and removed, but it does not prevent
eth0 from appearing in the routing table when wlan0 is RUNNING.

   The results of lspci -v for the wireless network controllers on both
systems are below.

Dell Latitude (built June 2010; 2.6.37.6 kernel):

Sony Vaio (built November 2011; 3.2.7 kernel):

   Given this (and any other information you'd like me to provide), what
might prevent removal of eth0 from the routing table when wlan0 is connected
to a WAP?

Rich - Based on the information you've provided and the testing I've done
on my Lenovo Laptop running Debian Sid, I suspect there is a problem in the
interaction between the NIC driver and your chosen net mgmt. software. Is
WICD a native app to slackware? If not, is there a native net mgmt. app? If
there's not a native net mgmt app is there another net mgmt app you can do
some testing with? Or perhaps just uninstall WICD and then test
connectivity to a WAP via command line?

Even though we know what's happening, we don't know the root cause as to
why it's happening. Do you have a static ip config for eth0 on your Dell?
Have you tried removing the static ip config for eth0 on the Sony and test
WAP connectivity?

The bottom line here is that a statically configured eth0 that is not
connected and not in a running state should not be the preferred default
gateway. Something is hosing up the logic there.

Mike,

   A) I suppose that wicd is 'native' to Slackware.

   B) There's nothing else in the distribution, but slackbuilds.org provides
the build scripts for network-manager-applet and NetworkManager. I can
download and install those on the Sony for a try.

   C) I've used wpa_supplicant and dhcpcd from the command line. I seem to
recall that they, too, connect to the WAP but do not drop eth0 from the
routing table.

   D) It's not connectivity to the WAP that's the problem, it's accessing the
'Net (directly or via a T&C Web page first) that fails because the packets
apparently insist on forcing themselves on the non-running eth0 and there's
no cable to move them along. So they die.

> Even though we know what's happening, we don't know the root cause as to

   Correct.

> Do you have a static ip config for eth0 on your Dell?

   Yep. The only differences in the network configuration files are the last
(host) digits of the local IP address and where the gateway address is
found. I moved the latter from a generic default position on the Sony to be
part of the eth0 stanza.

> Have you tried removing the static ip config for eth0 on the Sony and test
> WAP connectivity?

   Yep. If I manually (as root) issue 'ifconfig eth0 down' everything works.
What I need to do is automate this for the Sony's user.

> The bottom line here is that a statically configured eth0 that is not

   That's it. As I wrote, eth0 should be shut down when wlan0 comes up but it
doesn't.

Thanks,

Rich

My wife and I are interested in adding a device that will function as a 
place to put backups that is not on either of our regularly used 
machines. It has to be able to be used by whatever version of Linux I'm 
using, plus XP and Win7.

I started Googling network attached storage and find a number of 
"diskless"  boxes starting around $150 and going way up. At least one of 
them specifically mentioned compatibility with Win2000 and on, and 
Ubuntu 9.04 and on. I assume "diskless" means that I still have to buy a 
hard drive to put in the thing. I also assume the only reason to choose 
one of these boxes is that they are likely to be lower power consumption 
than a used computer who's only purpose would be file storage. It seems 
as though I should be able to put together a box that runs Samba and 
configure it to be accessible from the machines on the home network.

Am I missing anything here?

   As recently as a couple of weeks ago OfficeMax was clearing out 3T
external hard drives for about $150. These run on USB connectors (version 2
or 3) and you can copy data to them using rsync, cp, or whatever works on
windoze. You can keep them unplugged (or turned off) until needed.

I have a USB drive box with a 160 Gb drive in it that I connect to my 
machine when I want to back up to it. And I'll use it for my wife's 
files, too. But I was thinking about something that stayed on the 
network so she could do hers and I could do mine whenever we felt like it.

On the other hand, she can always copy files to my machine, send me an 
e-mail, and I'll plug in the USB box and move them over there. Maybe 
that's the better option since it will be disconnected from both power 
and the network unless I'm making a copy. Safer from power surges.

3T would probably last us longer than USB will be a hardware standard!

My backup strategies have evolved over the years. I'm currently running a Macbook Pro, and an Airport Extreme, so my main backups are automatic, using TimeMachine. It's saved my bacon a couple of times. Similar strategies are available for most operating systems. 

However... 

I also have storage where I host my domain. I have a script that runs once a day that rsyncs files to that storage. I pick and choose what I back up there. Mostly it's just the very important files that get this treatment. 

This gives me backups that are readily available, locally, and backups that would survive if something happens to my house and takes the computers with it. I also don't have to remember to back up my files. It happens as needed in one case, and once daily in the other. 

What it comes down to is, how much data loss are you willing to accept and how much effort do you want to expend to mitigate this possibility?

this, above all else is key IMNSHO.  it's my #1 backup requirement.

+1

Regular backups should be automated so you don't have to remember
them, but there ought to be a facility for doing a manual backup,
e.g., before a business trip or an OS upgrade.

Regardless of backup automation, you *do* have to remember 
periodically to test restoration from backups. It's mandatory.

That's not what I meant. I should have written "have you deleted the static
ip config stanza from /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf file and then tested net
connectivity over wifi.?"

Also, as Slackware will start up the interfaces in the order they are found
in that file, have you tried listing wla0 first? Maybe if wlan0 starts up
first, it's def gwy would get preference. The other thing you could do is
not define the def gwy for eth0 or have a rc.inet1.bak with the eth0 static
ip config. When you connect to an eth lan, just copy that file over
inet1.conf.

Of  course these are just band-aids to get you working over wifi assuming
the Dell is similarly configured. All things being the same in this
equation, same distro rev, WICD and static ip config, the only other
variable between the two computers is the NIC driver.

   No. The eth0 interface needs to come down when wlan0 is up, even if eth0
is not running. eth0 is needed on the lan.

   If this was true why would the Dell work just fine without rearranging
rc.inet1.conf?

   Which argues for a kernel upgrade if switching from wicd to
network-manager doesn't cure the symptoms.

What?  Why?
As I understand your use cases:
 - at home running on wired (eth0)
 - at a WiFi hotspot running on air (wlan0)

And you never use both at the same time.  
Yes? No?

   Correct.

   Yes.

   With the wireless issues being a PITA I (with Wes' experience and
expertise) tan a cat5 cable from the office to the den. So, while here the
Sony runs with eth0. When out it needs to run with wlan0.

Yes, I understand that and that's why I'm suggesting to either delete or
comment out (#) the eth0 stanza from /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf. Thdn upon
boot, eth0 will not be brought up and a def route via its interface won't
be injected into the routing table. As I mentioned a temporary fix would
then be to create a rc.inet1.bak file that you copy over rc.inet1.conf when
you want to connect to a wired eth lan.

I believe the static ip config of eth0 is what's causing the problem. I'm
not sure if it's the net mgmt software, the driver or the OS itself that
isn't dealing correctly with it. When I create a static ip config for eth0
it behaves in mostly the same way with the exception that packets aren't
being routed out via eth0 even though there's a def gwy for eth0 in the
routing table.

   These require root access; I'm trying to avoid that and follow the KISS
principal for the uesr's sake.

   I could agree with this if the Sony's behavior was seen on the other 6
portables on which I've run linux and Slackware. This Sony Vaio is unique in
the persistence with which it refuses to connect to wireless networks. :-)

   In the next couple of days, I'll de-activate wicd and install, configure,
and make active at boot network manager. Gotta' try that first.

   My suspicion is that the wireless chip is still new enough that the driver
does not handle it under all circumstances, even with the 3.2.7 kernel.
While kernel versions pop out regularly not all drivers are updated at the
same frequency. I have the 3.2.11 kernel tarball here and can install it or
a higher number kernel and see if that helps.

   This chip has caused issues with different brands and models of portables
running different linux ditributions (arch and ubuntu show up frequently in
web searches). Some have been resolved by upgrading the kernel to 2.6.28 so
it may well be a driver issue. But, in that case, upgrading to the 3.2.7
kernel should have fixed the problem. Shrug.

Rich,

Just throwing this out there... 

Wouldn't this assume it is the responsibility of the wireless driver to take down the wired driver? 

I would never assume that, as in some instances, both interfaces should be up. 

The only things that should be controlling wether the wired driver is up is A) the management software, or B) the driver for the device being brought up or down. There may be a C or later, but it wouldn't be the driver for a different interface. 

As I understand it, the network management software should, on transition from signal to no-signal (i.e. the cable is unplugged) should take the interface down, and it should remain down until another transition. 

My point is that looking for the wireless driver to do something with the wired driver is looking in the wrong location.

Subject: [PLUG] Package management genius needed
Message-ID: <20120411200022.1ef13a99@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I am trying to get a small QT-based application to run on my Fedora 16
x86_64 laptop. The purpose of this application is to display graphs of
data acquired by a medical device. The application is open source.
Someone has created 32- and 64-bit .deb files, although they will not
install on my 64-bit Lucid desktop because they require later
dependencies than are available in Lucid. (Natty and later works, I
think). 

Someone also created a binary installer for Fedora, with no mention of
architecture or dependency requirements. I installed it without error,
but it would not launch. It turns out that it needed the 32-bit version
of the qtwebkit package. I already had the 64-bit version, but
evidently the package installed by the installer is a 32-bit package. I
should add that my lovely Scribus is QT based and probably uses every
hook and whistle that QT provides, but all in 64-bit on my machine. 
All I know about QT is that it is a Very Big Thing. 

However, although I can get the program to run, and it will import the
data, it will not display the graphs. The "window" inside the
application window where the graphs are supposed to appear is literally
transparent. If I drag the application window over another application
window I can see right through it. (This itself is rather interesting.)
It really sounds like some QT component is missing.

My most recent effort involved installing Lubuntu 11.10 on an ancient
computer with 256 MB RAM and a 400 MHz CPU. Having done so I installed
the 32-bit Ubuntu package. It runs and imports the data fine, and
it displays the graphs correctly. This fact tells me that it ought to
be possible to get the application to work correctly on Fedora 16
x86_64 once I figure out what libraries or packages are missing.

While installing the 32-bit package on the Lubuntu machine I got a
message from gDebi package installer that it needed to install a long
list of additional packages, which I allowed it to do. I made a careful
list of the packages before letting it continue. 

My plan was to take the list to the Fedora laptop and install all the
packages. Unfortunately, this has not worked because yum can't find
them. Thinking that they might be files I tried "yum whatprovides foo,"
but yum still couldn't come up with anything useful. Fourteen of the
16 are libraries (mostly libqt4*), plus mysql-common and qdbus. 

The source for this program is also available. I didn't try compiling
from source because it would undoubtedly be a nightmare of missing
dependencies and other errors. 

Having written all that I don't even know what question to ask. Maybe I
just need suggestions and ideas.

John,

Is a virtual install of a 32 bit Lubuntu (or whatever) an acceptable
approach?

It would work, but I need to view this data daily. Having to launch the
virtual machine every day would be a PITA. I already have too many

Unless John has other reasons, intermittent internet will not
be a major hindrance, and we will be out of there before 6pm,
when PGE plays games with Mr. Sparky.  I will remind Vagrant
of our being there.  Perhaps we can help test the net and the
server while they are working, or let them know when DNS is out.

Don't plan on making any big downloads, but we can fix many
problems without a network at all. 

And while they and we are there, perhaps we set up our own
clinic machine as a mirror and have them set up DNS for it; 
then we could put all our distros on that, and serve them at
lightning speed at future clinics.  Setup would require one
or two skilled people focused on that, in addition to the
usual collection of semi-helpful goofballs;  any volunteers?

So, consider this a pre-announcement;  after I hear from John,
I will make my usual strange wordspew.

Keith

To be clear the wireless NIC driver should play no role at all in the
up/down state of eth0. What if you wanted to be mult-homed to many
networks? That same Linux routing engine and tcp/ip stack is used in
high-end routers. It makes no sense to say that eth0 has to come down when
wlan0 comes up.

As I mentioned before, when I test this on my Lenovo laptop running Debian
Sid with a static config for eth0, the iface is up and there's a def gwy
listed in the routing table. Yet, I have no issues routing packets via the
wlan0 interface.

"As I understand it, the network management software should, on transition
from signal to no-signal (i.e. the cable is unplugged) should take the
interface down, and it should remain down until another transition."

=> Agree. However, the behavior is that eth0 is up and injecting a def gwy
into the routing table without a cable connected and it being in a
"running" state. This is due to the static config in rc.inet1.conf. Which
shouldn't be a problem. The problem is that ip packets coming in through
wlan0 from the WAP are attempting to go out eth0. They never make it back
to the WAP and hence Rich never gets to the T&C web page.

They way routing should work is that ip packets go back out the interface
they came in on but something is mucking up the works.

Rich - There are some settings for WICD conf (
http://linux.die.net/man/5/wicd-manager-settings.conf) file that might
help. I'm curious what the following settings are and if they're the same
on your Dell.

*link_detect_tool =* *<0|1|2>
*         0 = autodetect
         1 = ethtool
         2 = mii-tool*wired_connect_mode =* *<0|1>*0 = connect to wired
interface automatically
1 = do not connect to wired interface automatically*prefer_wired =* *
<True|False>*True = Switch to wired interface if a link is detected, even
if already connected to wireless
False = Do not switch to wired interface automatically

My RHAT-fu is a bit rusty, but I think you should be able to do something
like "yum install qtwebket.i686" to get it working.

Failing that, if you can point at the deb, I might be able to throw Alien
at it.

My brain must be failing fast. I have a 64-bit Ubuntu computer right
next to me on my desk. I tried installing the 64-bit .deb on it, but it
failed because of a missing dependency. Why did it not occur to me
that, being an Ubuntu computer, it would have alien on it?

Sure enough, alien was installed, and happily converted the .deb
to .rpm. Transferred to the laptop, and sudo rpm -i happily installed
it. Running perfectly as I write this.

My next question to the list will be where to get brain help.

"Tell it to the bear."  Every group of techies should have a teddy bear (or
penguin, or cardboard cutout of Donald Knuth) to explain technical problems
to.  It's amazing how quickly things get solved.

IRS Commissioner Doug Schulman here, using Mr. Lofstrom's

We've extended the filing date to Tuesday, April 17 so
that you taxpayers can attend the Linux Clinic on Sunday,
get your Linux computers working, then compute your taxes.

We were beating notorious tax evader Keith Lofstrom with
hoses, trying to find out where he got the money to purchase
all his software.  He told us that it was "free".  Right...

Then he told us that the Linux clinic was free as well,
with free wireless and wired ethernet, free use of monitors
and keyboards and mice, and free advice to help people
with their Linux problems.  And free snacks?  Free coffee?  

Preposterous!  We know that Apple Computer and Microsoft
charge thousands of dollars for software and phone support,
Kinkos charges twenty bucks an hour for their workstations,
and Geek Squad charges their malware-plagued customers big
bucks to equip their poorly trained staff with orange and
black Volkswagens and poorly fitting black plastic glasses.

The IRS doesn't like "free".  You can't tax it, and there
is no place on form 8347-6B for "distro downloads" and 
"live CDs", whatever those are.  

At first, Lofstrom told us that the Clinic was at Free Geek, 
1731 SE 10th Avenue, between 1 and 5.  We sent a surveilance
team.  That place is nothing but a bunch of raggedy hippies
recycling old junk.  After using the thumscrews on him,
we finally got the real address, a large lakeside home
near Redmond, Washington.  We'll be waiting for you ...

Subject: [PLUG] Distro machine for Linux Clinic
Message-ID: <20120414171847.GA7830@gate.kl-ic.com>

I am building a new "Clinic" machine, which we can use for 
dispensing distros and writing CDs and DVDs at the clinic.

I took one of my older machines, put in a newer AMD motherboard
and SATA swap tray and PATA swap tray, and one DVD R/W drive. 
It has a USB3 card, and for now has a really old Matrox
PCI video card. 

I'm now loading Scientific Linux 6.2 (Red Hat Enterprise 6.2
clone, 2.6.32 kernel) onto an old 120GB SATA drive.  I will
be testing the USB3 connection with a Seagate 3TB USB3
external drive ($140 at Costco).  John can connect his
portable USB drive (containing his distro collection) to it.

If clinic clients bring in their PATA or SATA drives,
we can use this machine to debug the software on them.

Needs:

1) I could use a volunteer at the Clinic Sunday to configure
the machine as a proper file server.  http and ftp, feeding
files from the external USB drive.  Whatever it takes to 
serve RPM and DEB updates, perhaps stuff for Slackware and
Gentoo if somebody wants that.  This will only be used on
the freegeek internal network, so ultra security would be
nice but is not mandatory.

1a) If our heroic volunteer would rather do this for a
different distro than SL6.2, set that up on a SATA drive
and bring it in.  We can easily swap boot drives.  Note:
it is slightly better to avoid LVM for this - put boot
on /sda1 and root on /sda2, making boot order work off
the drives installed, not partition names or LVM setup.

2) Vagrant and the network wizards will be in on Sunday.
Could a volunteer help get this machine in the Free Geek
name server and dhcpd tables?

3) If someone wants to donate another USB3 drive from Costco
(or elsewhere) and start collecting distros, that would be
spiffy.  They are much faster than USB2 drives.  If someone
is willing to pay for one but isn't a Costco member, let me
know and I'll buy one and you can reimburse me.  The 2TB 
drives are $120.

3a) If someone can build some scripts on the external USB
drive that go out and update from mirrors at night, that
would be spiffy.  Then someone with ?ber-bandwidth can
take the drive home between clinics, run the scripts,
and download updates at night (I have 15mbps).

4) The machine is probably fast enough to write two DVDs
at once, so filling the empty drive bay with a second
R/W drive would double productivity.  Any donations?

5) A better video card might be nice.  There are a few
unused PCI slots, and one unused PCIe-16 slot.  I don't
think we need the speed for normal operations, but if 
someone brings in their hard drive to work on a video
app, it would be nice to have a broadly supported and
faster video card, not a wonky old Matrox with VESA
drivers.   PCI preferred, because that leaves the PCIe
slot open for other tests, but we takes what we gets.


All this is a bit of work, but it will free us from
dependence on John's laptop for writing distro CDs,
and give us a network source of distros and upgrades
which we can add to over the rest of the month.  With
the very fast dual USB3 connection, we can use more
than one USB3 drive, and share the effort of
collecting distros and updates.

More updates during the day, as I bring up the machine.

Keith

I repurposed my portable USB drive for other things at home. I now keep
all the distros on my Thinkpad. They total about 100 GB. I have a 32 GB
USB stick that we can use to transfer, or over the network. 

I do have a 200 GB hard drive that I put into my ancient rescued HP
(tenants left it behind). It has Lubuntu on it, with 194 GB free space.
I need to get some of my hairs cut today, and the barbershop is not too
far from Free Geek. I could stop by and pick up another hard drive.
IIRC a 250 GB drive runs about $50. Or maybe something from a <gasp>
retail store? I'll pick up the tab for a bigger hard drive if you think
it would be useful.

Why invest so much money in a box when you could buy
a big ten pack of 4-8GB Thumbdrives for a fraction of
the cost and not increase FreeGeek's power consumption?

Last time I was at the Costco here in NE they had ten pack's for
around $40 and with ten you could have two copies of every major distro.

I was writing in a open office document when it suddenly went dark and
would no longer let me write.  Then I got the message "Document file is
locked for editing by: unknown user  Open document for Read only or make
copy "

I'm the only user.  I did not "lock" the document.

Why did this happen?

How do I undo this "lock by unknown user"?


Thanks

True reconciliation is never cheap, for it is based on forgiveness, which
is costly. Forgiveness in turn depends on repentance, which has to be
based on an acknowledgment of what was done wrong, and therefore on
disclosure of the truth. You cannot forgive what you do not know.

You don't understand. It would be more *fun* to make a box.

Keith showed off his 3 TB USB 3.0 drive. Using his USB 3.0 Expresscard
in my [now] ancient Thinkpad T61 we got transfer rates of around 80
MB/s. The computer he is planning will have a USB 3.0 card in it, so it
will be fast. Add a couple fast DVD drives and we will be able to
produce any distro needed. The capacity will allow us to store more
than the 100 GB of distros that I currently have on my laptop, freeing
up that space for myself. 

All this makes me think of replacing my 4.5 year old Thinkpad. But it
still works, so I can't justify replacing it. I wish something fatal
would break on it so I could buy a new one.

Hello all,

I haven't heard any feedback about Tuesday's meeting for which the 
speaker has cancelled. I am happy to go down there even if only for an 
open discussion but I would like to hear at least one vote in favor or 
suggestion of an alternative topic.

Options:

1. Does someone else have something they would like to talk about?

2. Is there a hot roundtable free-for-all topic?

3. May I bore you with my BSD Virtualization presentation?

4. Cancel it?

Thanks,

Michael

I would be in favor of an open discussion.  In particular, I'd be interested
in anybody's experience with the systemd initiator/start-up daemon and any
of the Zabbix/Monit/OpenNMS monitoring systems.  If people want, I can also
give the previously failed demo of LXC (about 15 minutes).

Alternately, perhaps we can discuss Asterisk some more.

I just started learning about systemd in the context of Open Embedded
stuff, but I won't be at advanced topics this month.  Someone should
to a systemd talk in *May*. ;-)

I will show up to hide from the IRS, even if nothing else 
is scheduled.

Perhaps we can do card tricks.  Pick a card - is your card
a 3 of clubs AGP video card?

    Given the global lack of available IPv4 space, and limitations in
    IPv4 extension and transition technologies, this document advises
    that IPv6 support is no longer considered optional.

Later in the doc,

    To ensure interoperability and flexibility, the best practices
    are as follows:

    *  New IP implementations must support IPv6.

    *  Updates to current IP implementations should support IPv6.

    *  IPv6 support must be equivalent or better in quality and
       functionality when compared to IPv4 support in a new or
       updated IP implementation.

    *  New and updated IP networking implementations should support
       IPv4 and IPv6 coexistence (dual-stack), but must not require
       IPv4 for proper and complete function.

    *  Implementers are encouraged to update existing hardware and
       software to enable IPv6 wherever technically feasible.

Depends.  Does Michael total his dependents on line 6e?

If I get thrown off the PLUG list for posting time
wasting chatter, and hurt myself when I land, can I

Oregon?  I was thinking alcohol.  If I can drink while I vote from home

Voting while drunk is unlikely to impact you personally to any 
significant degree. Doing taxes while drunk could end with a severe 
financial penalty. But feel free! Experiment! :-)

Subject: [PLUG] Sony Vaio Wireless Connectivity: One Step Closer
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1204171640250.1268@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   This past weekend I and Mike Conners discovered where the inability of
the Sony Vaio to connect to the 'Net happens. I still need serious help from
those who know Slackware better than do I to determine why, and how to
resolve the problem.

   No one's reponded to my thread on linuxquestions.org and I know this area
has many linux experts (kernel, modules, and networking). If no one here
knows the solution, perhaps someone can point me to an appropriate guru.

   Mike and I had the Dell (which works just fine with dynamic IP address
wireless access and static IP address ethernet access) and the Sony running
side-by-side and invoked 'wicd-client -n' simultaneously on both while
tailing /var/log/messages on each.

   The Dell's log showed:

Apr 14 09:35:36 caddis dhcpcd[3096]: version 5.2.12 starting

   It is after dhcpcd forked to the background that ntpd was invoked and
deleted the eth0 interface.

   On the Sony when dhcpcd forked to the background everything stopped. No
further messages because ntpd was not invoked.

   What might prevent ntpd from being called on the Sony? This seems to be
the key issue and I've no idea how to trace it further toward the source.
_Someone_ must have the insight and experience to point me toward a fix.

TIA,

Rich

While time is important, it's not so important as to stop a network connection.
Having said that, what might prevent it from being called is lack of network.
No reasong to use the Network Time Protocol without a net.

Maybe I'm mis-interpreting your statement, but this explanation seems
completely at odds with the NTDP actions and log entries:

pr 14 09:38:36 caddis ntpd[1671]: Listen normally on 5 wlan0 10.5.70.151
UDP 123
Apr 14 09:38:36 caddis ntpd[1671]: Listen normally on 6 wlan0

Apr 14 09:38:36 caddis ntpd[1671]: Deleting interface #3 eth0,

active_time=2101 secs
Apr 14 09:38:36 caddis ntpd[1671]: peers refreshed

Wlan0 is up and has an ip address. Based on the behavior we witnessed on
the Dell, NTPD should be invoked and start  listening start on wlan0 for
NTP packets so that clock sync can be re-established via the wlan0
interface. Which is exactly what we see on the Dell.

Mind you, I was quite surprised that NTPD was responsible for deleting eth0
and hence also the default route associated with it from the route table.
Although, NTPD has permission to do this via WICD, I would've thought the
network manager would perform this action.

The really troubling part here is that these two boxes are running
identical OS versions with default configurations. The only explanation I
can come up with is a permissions problem But again, identical OS versions
w. default configs.

   A) The network is present: the Sony gets an IP address and gateway from
the WAP and the Dell connects just fine.

   B) Why ntpd is involved I've no idea, but it is. And when ntpd on the Dell
finds the connection to the WAP it shuts down eth0.

   C) The question, regardless of the purpose of ntpd being invoked, is why
it is not invoked on the Sony.

   Not sure I completely understand the context of your question, Russell,
but ntpd explicitly drops eth0 from the routing table. The result is the
same as root running 'ifconfig eth0 down'.

Rich,

Do you have ntpd turned on on your Vaio?  Have you compared the ntpd 
scripts between the two machines?

Ken,

   Yes and yes. They're both the default from installation of
Slackware-13.37/x86_64 and on both machines /etc/rc.d/rc.nptd has the
execute bits turned on so it loads when the system boots.

   I'm thinking that I need to dig into the wicd code Real Soon Now ... this
week, anyway.

   I just downloaded the code for wicd-1.7.2.1 (the latest release) and
grep'd for ntpd in the source .py files. Nothing found. But, in wnettools.py
are classes for setting up the base, wired, and wireless interfaces. In the
wired interface class are two procedures to see if there's an actual
connection; if there is none the function should return FALSE. I've not
parsed all the code to see what calls wnettools.py to learn what is supposed
to happen if the ethernet connection is not found.

   Anyone willing to work with me on tracing the code to figure out where the
Sony goes off the rails?

No, it's not. 

NTPd is simply reporting to the log file that eth0 is no longer valid, and it's removing it as the interface that it will use for querying ntp servers. ntp does not, and will not bring down or bring up a network interface. ntpd is at the same level as a mail server. It's a server application that sends and receives packets. It does however, keep track of available/valid network interfaces, and can be configured to use different ntp sources, depending on what interface is available. So it makes sense that it takes note of eth0 not being valid. It makes no sense to assume that ntpd would in any way bring up or down an interface.

!. This suggests that the NTPD "listening" entries in the log are due to
the Dell functioning as a time server.

"If you want the computer you run OpenNTPD on to also be a time server,
*simply uncomment and edit the "listen" directive.*"

- I thought it was odd that NTPD was "listening" as opposed to sending NTP
packets out to find a clock source. So those entries suggest at the very
least that on the Dell you have a Time Server configured and maybe not on
the Sony.


2. The other thing we discovered is that NTPD is being called through
DHCLIENT hooks to start and stop NTPD on the Dell. I would verify the
existence and config of the dhclient hook scripts on the Sony.

-"The following example uses /etc/dhclient-exit-hooks to start and stop
openntpd depending on dhcp status:"

[ "$interface" != "eth0" ] && exit 0

if $if_up; then
    pgrep ntpd &> /dev/null || /etc/rc.d/openntpd start
elif $if_down; then
    pgrep ntpd &> /dev/null && /etc/rc.d/openntpd stop
fi

3. Lastly, it could be related to ntpd failing to initialize.

"ntpd may fail to initialize properly if it is started before the network

NTPD's role is and how it's interacting with the networking. But I do know
that after the "deleting eth0" entries in the message log. Eth0 is in the
"down" state, with no ip address and the default gateway entry for eth0 is
removed from the routing table.

The net effect is that routing via wlan0 works, Rich gets the wifi T&C page
and internet connectivity.

The other thing I noticed that hasn't been mentioned is that in the Sony's
routing table, there are metrics assigned to eth0 and wlan0, with eth0
having a lower metric and hence it's the preferred default route. I suspect
the metric is assigned to eth0.

Another thing that could be tried is stop eth0 from starting at boot
with "rc-update
del net.eth0"

The only problem with that is then eth0 will be in a down state and I don't
think physical link detection will work
when a cable is plugged in Which would require manual intervention and
that's not a solution for the user.

Russell,

   Then something else is dropping that interface between the last dhcpcd log
entry and the first ntpd log entry. As there's no entry between the two
where should I look to learn what drops eth0 on the Dell but not on the
Sony?

I've been using and configuring ntp servers and clients for 10 years. What you are seeing is happening in this order:

1: the interface is going down.
2: ntpd notices it going down and removes the interface from its in memory config. 

So the log entries you are seeing are the result of the interface going down, not the result of ntp taking the interface down. 

I'm positing that the reason you don't see the same behavior on the sony is that something is blocking the command to take the interface down, so ntp isn't able to notice it down, so it never removes the entry from its in memory config. 

If I were debugging this, I would try the install without any special network configuration, i.e. completely stock. Maybe even while at the coffee shop. See if I could get it to work properly without any special configs.

Russell,

   As far as I know, the only thing "non-stock" in either portable is the
static IP information for eth0 in rc.inet1.conf. That comes blank. I've not
had any reason to do anything special in any portable.

On the distributions I use, this is handled by the ifplug daemon. When I google for "slackware ifplugd", I get several hits that indicate the ifplugd is used for automatic configuration of network interfaces.

I guess my point is we've been trying to debug this for a while now. When I'm banging my head against a wall, I tend to 'run home to mama' and remove anything that I've done to make it non-standard. The config you have for your static IP would fall into that category for this discussion.

Russell,

   Huh! I built and installed that on the Sony and that might be part of the
problem, because I just checked on this workstation and it's already
installed.

   I'll check to see if the new installation on the Sony borked an existing
one. Stay tuned for the results ...

Thanks,

Rich

   I built and installed qemu-kvm on my Dell portable. It wants kvm-intel.ko
to be loaded before being invoked. No matter what syntax I try, neither
insmod or modprobe finds the module, even when passed the absolute path to
the module. Also, modprobe responds that it cannot find kvm_intel.ko when
the module name, and the name passed on the command line, is kvm-intel.ko

I have had trouble booting from Win7-x64 install disks on some (multiple)

wouldn't surprise me if a VM had similar problems.

YMMV, HTH, etc.

Primus:  Can you read the Win7 disk from your drive normally?  It
should be a normal (for Winderz) ISO9660/Joliet disk, which Linux
should be able to read just fine.

Secundus:  Can qemu-kvm read _any_ disk from the CD/DVD drive?

If either fails, that's probably the source of your immediate problem.

It's been ages since I did anything with VMs, so I'm afraid I wouldn't
be much help there, sorry.  :-(

Rick,

   The Latitude was built June 2010. Does that qualify as "less than
brand-new"? Regardless, is there a work-around?

Actually, Rich, Rick is referring to the hardware being virtualized in the virtual machine. This may or may not have anything to do with the actual hardware you have in the PC use are using to host the VM. 

I have no idea if there is a work around beyond trying a 32 bit version of the OS.

I would definitely consider that less-than-new for the purposes of Win7-x64
(in my experience)... however, the fact that you're trying to install on a
VM may change that "less-than-new" status, for better OR worse (could make
it act more "new"... or just plain "old"... or maybe it will retain
"less-than-new" status like the hardware itself).

My work around was simply not to boot from those disks on those
computers... this is in my work environment... I simply booted from those
disks, as necessary, on computers that WOULD work... then used imaging
tools (ghost, dd, etc.) to move the OS onto the computers that would not
boot directly. So... the short answer is, yes I found a work around... but
I don't know that it would be helpful in your circumstances - especially
given that we don't even know whether you're having the same problem.

Are you trying to boot from a 64-bit Win7 installation disk? I never had
trouble with the 32-bit versions.

I suspect the issue that I was running into was that, while the computers
were fully 64-bit capable, there was something in the BIOS (or, perhaps
other firmwares on the system) that were not quite up-to-snuff for the new
64-bit world.

Rich, 

When I configure KVM (on RHEL 6) I usually set up an ISO file for the
CD. If you have the Virtual Machine Manager set up, it's elementary to
point to the ISO file from the Console | Details view. Otherwise, I
think there's a virsh command that points a VM to an ISO file, don't
remember what it is off hand.

(I've had trouble in the past with my older Dell laptop w/r/t detecting
inserted CDs.)

Thanks,
Mike

   Oh. The prospective guest OS is win7/home 64-bit. Have no idea what
hardware qemu-kvm is emulating.

   Lemme' see if I can salvage this investment. All I want to do is load

   Well, the Latitude came with some Microsoft flavor installed; I
immediately overwrote that with Slackware-13.37/x86_64. So I imagine that
the Intel i7 (4 core) can handle 64-bit Microsoft.

Mike,

   Ya' know, this brings up two thoughts: 1) I can create an ISO from the
win7 cdrom and B) I know there's a GUI front end to qemu-kvm I put on that
machine but I don't recall what it's called. Digging out the name and trying
that rather than the command line might well be the solution.

   More tomorrow ...

Thanks,

Rich

   Vague recollection of reading somewhere that the GUI front end (aqemu)
works better than does the command line. Again, more tomorrow ...

I think what you're looking for is virt-manager.  It's a nice GUI
front-end for qemu/kvm, and Slackware has it (I just looked :-) ).

   Good guess ... if there was a qemu.conf file somewhere. :-) I looked for
one and found nothing.

   Yep. 'aqemu'. Built and installed; I completely forgot about it since I'm
a CLI user much more than a GUI user.

I've run my search foo into the ground with no joy.

Anyone have a source for these gizmos.  I can find four port HUBs but I 
really need a two port dongle.
    I seem to remember seeing these years ago but can't find them now.

Probably because 2 port or 7, it's still a hub, and the costs to manufacture 2 ports is close to 4 or more??

However, I found this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817270039

Which is a 2 port hub... Dongle means no cable to me, but this is as close as I could find. I do know that Fry's sells four port hubs that don't have a cable.

We discussed ifplug / hotplug before on this thread. The problem could be
with iflplugd as it should configure and deconfigure upon physical link
detection or removal. If memory serves. eth0 on the Sony was coming up with
the static ip address.that is configured for it. Ifplugd uses native ifup /
ifdown, upon boot if no cable was detected, eth0 should not be brought up
by ifplugd.

In fact, by default eth0 should not be enabled:

*-a | --no-auto*
Do not enable interface automatically (default: off)

I found this thread (
http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/how-tho-configure-my-system-to-start-wlan0-instead-of-eth0-847316/)
where
the user doesn't want eth0 to be enabled upon boot to stop eth0 from
attempting to connect via DHCP before connecting to the wifi net.

Perhaps this might be a workaround?

"I have installed ifplugd, which is a daemon who connects to ethernet only
if a cable is connected. With Gentoo this works out of the box. With
Slackware ifplugd is started after rc.inet1 (probably). So the the system
still tries to connect via ethernet before connecting to the wireless
network."

"I've searched by myself and found the following solution. I disabled the
entry for ifplugd to be started in rc.local and inserted it in rc.M instead
of the section where rc.inet1 is started. Here the section in rc.M"

Code:
...
# ifplugd starten bevor rc.inet1 startet
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.ifplugd ]; then
  # Start ifplugd
  echo "Starting ifplugd:  /etc/rc.d/rc.ifplugd start"
  /etc/rc.d/rc.ifplugd start
fi

# Initialize the networking hardware.
#if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 ]; then
#  . /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1
#fi]

Message-ID: <20120420043754.GA31259@gate.kl-ic.com>

Based on Bill Ensley's and other's excellent suggestions,
I ordered some Aastra 9133i phones (used on eBay, cheap)
which will be here soon.  The TFTP files look similar to
the ones I am using for the Cisco 79xx phones we are 
using now.  I hope the Aastra boots faster ...

Bill also suggested Sangoma cards with echo cancellation.

It looks like the Sangoma B600D with 4 FXO (two RJ11 2-line 
connectors), one RJ11 FXS, and hardware echo cancellation
would fit our needs.  There is a used one for $375 on eBay.
New ones are $526 + shipping.

Any recommendations or quibbles about the B600D?  Preferred
vendors?  I can order one tomorrow for delivery next week.

I won't have time for Linuxfest this year, so I will spend
part of next week bringing up the Aastras, and the weekend
after that (Linuxfest weekend) tweaking on the Sangoma.

One option w/o the GUI -- the virt-install command. Try something like

# virt-install --cdrom win7.iso --name=test.com --ram=768
--disk=/var/lib/libvirt/images/abc.img,size=10

For a 10GB virtual hard drive. The virt-install command is pretty
forgiving; if you get some things right, it prompts for needed info.

If you do choose to go with the Virtual Machine Manager GUI -- in RHEL
6, the RPM is named virt-manager. Hopefully Slack uses something
similar. 

Thanks,
Mie

Mike,

   The behavior I observed on the Sony after installing ifplugd was that it
would drop and raise eth0 as the cable was removed and inserted, but only
then. Had no effect after booting with no cable inserted. This weekend I'll
check to ensure that I have only one instance of ifplugd installed.

   I fire up aqemu and find the place to create a new VM. Click that menu
item, enter 'win7' in the dialog box, and see a message that the VM needs
QEMU and that's not found on the system. Strange.

   I have /usr/bin/qemu-kvm, so I make a soft link from that to
/usr/bin/qemu. Still told that QEMU can't be found.

   In the aqemu general settings is a combo box for "Default VM Template". I
have that set to linux-2.6 x86_64; should that be changed to win7? I looked
at 'man aqemu' and found nothing of value in the short file. What does the
template do?

   Any ideas why the front end tells me it cannot find qemu to create the VM
when qemu-kvm is present?

   Invoking aqemu as root fixed the problem.

Mike,

   Running aqemu as root lets me use the wizard to set everything up. There's
now /root/.aqemu/win7_HDA.img and I've told aqemu to use the cdrom. This
seems to be the first step: configuring the VM.

   One menu item/icon on the aqemu window is 'Start'. This brings up an error
box telling me 'no boot devices found.' Seems to me that it's trying to
start the guest OS in the VM, which would be step 3.

   What I'm missing is step 2: installing the guest OS from the cdrom disk
onto the VM. I've searched with Google and find some pages describing how to
install qemu-kvm/aqemu and the guest OS in BSD, but cannot translate their
process to my situation. I do not have virt-install installed. Do I need
this in addition to qemu-kvm and aqemu?

   What I learn on the slackbuilds.org page is that virtinst (the Slackware
equivalent of virt-install, I assume) is used to install Fedora or RHEL in
virtual machines. Nothing about installing a Microsoft OS in a VM.

   Figured it out.

   1) Created an .iso from the win7 cdrom.

   2) Ran 'qemu-img create -f qcow2 win7.img 10G'.

   3) Ran 'qemu -m 1024 -hda win7.img -cdrom win7sp1-home64.iso -boot d'

And it boots!

   Next I'll try step 3 invoking qemu-kvm.

I'm curious of your configuration.  Are you going out on analog lines?  How
about an ascii block diagram or some such.  What PBX are you running?  On
what hardware? What are some of the interesting things that you tried that
did or did not work.  Are your users happy with the system?  What features
do your users use?   Gear heads want to know Keith.   Thanks -- Pat

Subject: [PLUG] extending skipws manipulator for << output question
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHeHng+4NaDJRwnJJjK1T+5M8WmGp=48oGCa4VBR+C+0UQ@mail.gmail.com>

Okay, this is probably going to turn into a tough one, but where is the
source code for the iomanipulator skipws commonly used in input streams in
C++ such as " cin >> skipws >> object"

I am trying to activate skipws for output so it will automatically strip
off whitespace before actually writing to the ostream (or ofstream).

Ios_base.h only shows the member function signatures, but I need access to
the actual code for the manipulator.  I did look in the internet awhile,
but only discovered lots of macaws repeating the same parrot phrases.
(sarcasm)

Thanks if you can point me to the right area of the libstd++ source code.

(I am sure later on I will find out that I should have just dug deep user
archive manger or dissembling some rpm source)

   I have win7 running in qemu-kvm and am now trying to learn how to make USB
devices visible to the guest OS.

   However, there's another issue that folks here might be able to help me
resolve: I'm not able to release the cursor from the guest OS using ctrl-alt
despite this being the way it should work (and it's printed on the VM window
frame, too.)

   Any suggestions on how to do this are welcome. It did work yesterday when
I ran just qemu; perhaps running qemu-kvm alters this?

When I was looking at virtual stuff a few years ago, kvm didn't
support USB passthru except for USB v1 (OHCI).  Maybe that's changed.
But if you need it for your applications (which I recall you do,
talking to your GPS) then you might: a) confirm kvm supports what you
need; or b) look at VirtualBox instead (the open source edition didn't
either, you need the Oracle version).  Oracle's package does support
USB 2 (EHCI) passthru, iirc.

Subject: [PLUG] Vim % behavior
Message-ID: <20120421185729.GA1201@jamhome.us>


I've searched the Vim Tips Wiki, asked on IRC and now here:

Is there a Vim plugin that will change % matching behavior to skip quoted or escaped matches?

Given:

1  var1{
2     ...
3    { Target = 'blah blah.*}',
4     ...
5    }
6    ...
7    $fem = \};
8  }

With the cursor on { on line 1 % would then take you to line 8.

The intent is to navigate through Data::Dumper (a Perl variable analysis tool) 
dumps with embedded quoted code fragments.

Cluestick pointer preferred.


For those of you who don't Vim, when your cursor is on one of [ { ( ) } ] pressing %
will move the cursor to the matching ] } ) ( { or [.
There's also a plugin that will do the same with HTML tags.

Subject: [PLUG] followup to skipws question
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHdm67KKMp2AwQH+8vZRg39AVv4FuJWgA1YYR8iECSvhGA@mail.gmail.com>

Followup to All:

I have spent almost 2 hours going over the code at the gcc libstdc++
repository (not easy to navigate, had to step off the website and search it
externally using Google to quickly locate pertinant items) and have found
out the true story on skipws only working on istreams.

Basically, a special member function is created for the
std::basic_istream<_CharT, _Traits>::sentry class that looks at the Boolean
flag for skipws and uses the one character at a time sgetc() to laboriously
step through the stream to examine the current character to see if it is a
whitespace character (which depends upon the locale settings too), and if
so, jumps over the character and goes to the next.

This is just as we expected.

I am not sure of how easy it is to create a member function for
std::basic_ostream<_CharT, _Traits>::sentry class, because sentry is the
internal layer for setting up the streams, and is not exposed at the top
layers.  All these functions are heavily templatized.

This discussion probably should be moved to Technical talk group???

In the meantime, I will simply use the "cat file | tr -d " " >
stripped_file"  command to do the work.

I really would like to see the skipws work for ostreams, of course.

Russell,

   This may be the case. Finding current information is difficult. A
slackware wiki page was last updated in 2008. Seems to me that qemu and kvm
should be keeping up with current protocols, else why bother with
virtualization at all?

   Perhaps the most pragmatic solution is find someone with a windoze box
who'll let me temporarily install the Garmin BaseCamp tool and the four
state maps so I can install them on the GPS receiver, then remove those
files.

Thanks,

Rich

Oh my bad, I didn't realize you needed the other direction.  Some
keyboards/mice have backward compatibility with PS2 adapters without any
special logic in them. PCH also carries those adapters I believe...

E: Couldn't find package freewrl

I decided to Google freewrl and have a look in the various freewrl list 
archives. The most recent post shows some promise:


http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=COL120-W625BDBBF43F65C9FF975DFB63D0%40phx.gbl&forum_name=freewrl-develop

It shows that the poster is using lubuntu 12.04. I'm still on Ubuntu 
10.04. Rather than put a lot of time into getting freewrl running on 
10.04, I'll wait until I've installed 12.04 and then follow his 
exploits. I should have some time next week to start -- which means I 
probably will have some time in a month or so. :-)

I seem to have problems printing a pdf document.  Document Viewer (2.30.3)
offers to print, and it does print, but the size does not match the
page--some portion of the page gets cut off.  The print view shows the
truncated page.  This has been going on for a long time; it is nothing new,
but I have two single-page documents which I would really like to have
paper copies of (bike part assembly instructions).  A third page printed
fine.  The two that are giving me trouble are landscape, the other is
portrait.  Xpdf does not offer printing.

I am running Ubuntu 10.04.

Suggestions?

Thanks,

Install Okular. It is the later version of kpdf, and offers a lot more
functionality.

There is also Adobe Reader.

Also check the settings in CUPS. Try different drivers.

Push come to shove, print to file, open the file in Ghostscript, and
print from that. Or, once you have a print file (usually ending
in .ps), send it to the printer with lpr from the command line. There
are ton of options for lpr, explained reasonably clearly on man lpr.

Perhaps the document size is A4, in which case you might need to find
a way to scale it to letter.

I print from xpdf all the time.  Do you not have a print button at the
bottom of the window?

Two avenues: 

Does `cat /etc/papersize` return A4 or letter?
If A4, your system is not resizing the printed items properly. 

If letter, when the print dialog is open look for an option to resize the to fit the page.

Boy do I feel stupid!  I never saw the buttons at the bottom.  What are
they doing down there?  It printed fine except for clipping the first
letter of all the words on the left edge.  I will try John's advice and
look for the newer incarnation of Xpdf, but what I have now is passable.
 Thanks Galen for the clue stick whack.

Status:

I played with Document Viewer.  With one of the documents I was able to get
almost error-free printing.  I shut off Auto center and rotate, chose
Reverse Landscape, and scaled to 95%.  The preview looked fine, but on
printing a small amount was cut off on the right edge.  With the other
document I was unable to get even the preview to be reasonable. FWIIW, the
most troublesome document is:
http://www.shimano.com/media/techdocs/content/cycle/SI/105/SI_1M30A/SI-1M30A-003-ENG_v1_m56577569830702207.pdf

I have what I need, but it would be nice to understand what the difficulty
is due to, since I expect that this is not the last time I will experience
such a problem.

I have yet to follow John's suggestion for upgrading Xpdf.

This document has a page size of     1031 x 727 pts
which is approximately 14.3 x 10.1 inches  (72 points/inch)
I would think you need to scale it by about 77% to print on letter sized paper.

I was able to print the PDF in the link with no trouble, using
Document Viewer v2.32.0.  Check "Page Handling => Page Scaling" in the
Print dialog.  Make sure it is set to "Shrink to Printable Area".  It
sounds to me like you've got it set to "None".  The page printed here
in landscape orientation, shrunk to fit an 8.5x11-inch page, with
nothing cut off.  A bit small, but quite readable.

Hope this helps.

Thanks, it helps.  There may be a small problem with my printer driver
because some times a little of one edge or the other gets cut off--1/16
inch or so, but otherwise "Shrink to Printable Area" seems to be the key.
 I expect my long-suffering problems with pdf printing are going to be a
thing of the past.

The Sangoma B600D telephony card I ordered from Telephonyware of
Concord California just arrived.  The used Aastra 9133i phones I
purchased through eBay will hopefully be here before the weekend.  

I was planning on upgrading an Asterisk phone system with these

in NW Portland to participate, or interrupt with questions?

If the phones DON'T arrive, I will reschedule.

Mayday! Mayday!

The speaker I lined up for May 3rd has a new job and will not have time 
to prepare a presentation. Congrats on the job though...

Does anyone have a topic that's bursting for sharing?

Putting the L in Linux, would someone like to talk about the impending 
Ubuntu release? Or OpenBSD 5.1 for that matter?

Going with the SMB theme and the awesome FreePBX talk, is anyone using 
pfSense? Brew on Mac? Ardour with a few words about low-latency kernels?

LinuxCNC with a genuine Real Time kernel and that great CNC machine you 
made out of old MRI scanner parts?

Any Puppet users out there who want to give a crash course?

Finally, is there a nagging talking you would like to hear about?

Thanks!

Michael

Hit Ctrl-Alt-F1 and log in outside of X, edit the file, then go back to X
with Ctrl-Alt-F7 and hit Ctrl-Alt-Backspace.

If F1 doesn't give you anything useful, try F2, F3, F4, etc.

If you can't ssh in as Bill suggested, boot into recovery mode and
edit the file.

I have no idea how to use an external keyboard.  Maybe the live CD (usb

Adding to the chorus of suggestions:  Try using one of the various
on-screen keyboards that are available.  You might have one installed
by default.

The only thing I got to when trying to get to Recovery Mode was "select
boot device".  There is only one, and no recovery mode.

It sounds like you are seeing a bios menu, not grub.  However, if you
have managed to get to the grub menu, edit the kernel options, adding
the word text to the end, then boot.  This should boot into text-only,
no X11.

I think I may be getting somewhere.  I got into Grub (Grub 2 uses shift).
 I was presented with the option to edit the entries.  Now I am presented
with a screen:

setparms ' Ubuntu, with Linux 3.0.0-19-generic'

recordfail
set gfxpayload=$linux_gfx_mode
insmod gzzio
insmod part_msdos
...
initrd /boot/initrd.img-3.0.0-19-generic


Where do I had the "text"?  In the first line setparms..., or in the body
of the commands, or in that last line?

Thanks
-Denis

Assuming you're seeing something like this:
<https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Editing_the_GRUB_2_Menu_During_Boot>

Add "text", without the quotes, to the end of the line that begins
with linux.  You are passing an option to the linux kernel.

BTW, if you want to see all of the kernel boot messages, delete
"quiet".  In some cases the kernel can get hung up due to video driver
issues.  Under those circumstances, you would delete "splash".

Thanks so much for your guidance.  I was able to get to text mode and
modify the file back to where it was. The netbook now is back to where it
was.

Why changing what looked like touch-pad on to touch-pad off killed the
keyboard is a mystery to me.

Subject: [PLUG] Virtual Box problem on Ubuntu 10.04
Message-ID: <4F9AD396.8040402@comcast.net>

I got a notice of an update for VirtualBox this morning. I downloaded 
virtualbox-4.1_4.1.14-77440~Ubuntu~lucid_i386.deb and installed it. Now, 
when I try to start one of my  virtual machines I get the following 
error message:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Failed to open a session for the virtual machine Wirns.

Failed to open/create the internal network 
'HostInterfaceNetworking-eth0' (VERR_SUPDRV_COMPONENT_NOT_FOUND).

One of the kernel modules was not successfully loaded. Make sure that no 
kernel modules from an older version of VirtualBox exist. Then try to 
recompile and reload the kernel modules by executing 
'/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup' as root (VERR_SUPDRV_COMPONENT_NOT_FOUND).

Result Code: NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005)
Component: Console
Interface: IConsole {1968b7d3-e3bf-4ceb-99e0-cb7c913317bb}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This happened to me recently (a few days ago? a week or so?) and I 
solved it by "executing '/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup' as root." Today, 
however, when I try that I get another error message:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
rsteff at moonguide:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup
  * Stopping VirtualBox kernel modules
  * Cannot unload module vboxdrv
rsteff at moonguide:~$
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the instructions above is, "Make sure that no kernel modules from an 
older version of VirtualBox exist." I understand very minimally what a 
kernel module is, but not how to recognize one, or where to look for a 
specific one. Is that what I need to do to fix this problem?

I will reschedule, to an evening next week, or daytime next

Subject: [PLUG] Progress toward switching the touchpad on and off in Xfce
Message-ID: <CAArUT0j+n3gLmXwyeWhR+Z5FSNZgnwct=HNUhRD3OWVgem6jxg@mail.gmail.com>

Fn F3 is the toggle for the touchpad in Gnome.  In Xfce most of the
function keys work as expected except for Fn F3.  Initially on booting
synclient reports TouchpadOff=1 even though the touchpad is functional.
 Subsequently I can turn it on and off using synclient TouchpadOff=0 and
synclient TouchpadOff=1 respectively, and synclient properly reports the
status thereafter.

In a text console, showkey -s: 0x74 0xf4

xev reports on pressing Fn F3:

KeyPress event, serial 34, synthetic NO, window 0x3000001,
    root 0xab, subw 0x3000002, time 3489713, (44,47), root:(672,258),
    state 0x0, keycode 199 (keysym 0x1008ffa9, XF86TouchpadToggle),
same_screen YES,
    XLookupString gives 0 bytes:
    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes:
    XFilterEvent returns: False

KeyRelease event, serial 34, synthetic NO, window 0x3000001,
    root 0xab, subw 0x3000002, time 3489713, (44,47), root:(672,258),
    state 0x0, keycode 199 (keysym 0x1008ffa9, XF86TouchpadToggle),
same_screen YES,
    XLookupString gives 0 bytes:
    XFilterEvent returns: False

I note that this reports the name XF86TouchpadToggle, yet it does nothing
detectable.

I suspect that something has blocked or changed the function.

I wonder if anybody has ideas on what might be broken.  Alternatively a
script could capture the keypress and do the switching.  (I found such a
script on the web.)  I would prefer to fix what is broken just for the
satisfaction.

I turned off the touchpad on my Thinkpad (Fedora 16) in the BIOS.
But I gather from other recent posts that you already tried that and
the outcome was less than satisfactory. Did you finally determine that
it cannot be turned off in the BIOS?

That is affirmative.  The BIOS makes not reference to it (nor to much else).

But  synclient TouchpadOff=1 is easy enough, and if I wanted to shut it off
all the time, I could just add that to the startup stuff.  However would be
nice to enable the function key toggle, and to understand why (or how) Xfce
manages to break that one function key.

OpenBSD is a free *nix-like operating system that focuses on security, 
correctness and developer freedom. With only two remote holes in the 
default install in over 10 years, OpenBSD has a reputation of being one 
of the most secure operating systems in common use.

This talk will present a basic overview of what OpenBSD is,
and will heavily emphasize what its strengths are. It will also
cover the various methods OpenBSD uses to remain secure.

With OpenBSD 5.1 arriving May 1st, we will also discuss some of its new 
features and improvements.

Ubuntu Studio 12.04 is not yet available. In the interest of disk space
did not download the DVD versions, or the Mac and PowerPC versions. I
can get them in a few minutes if someone needs them.

These will be available at the Clinic, or if someone with low bandwidth

Given the short notice for next week's General meeting, I present you an 
audio summary of the OpenBSD project to help prepare:

http://www.openbsd.org/lyrics.html#audio_extra51
http://www.openbsd.org/songs/songsh.mp3
http://www.openbsd.org/songs/songsh.ogg

In short, they are a bunch of hikers who refine Unix.

One result: Their own ACPI stack so their notebooks work while hiking.

By extension:

Their stance on Software Patents: Shut up and Hack

Their stance on Software Licensing: Shut up and Hack (ISC)

Their stance on Communitizing the Community: Shut up and Hack


You may find this refreshing.

Thanks.

I've installed it, and finally figured out how to start clamtk from a 
terminal. I've got a launcher icon, but nothing happens when I click it. 
I edited the properties to put sudo in front of clamtk %f, but that 
didn't help.

I can leave the launcher icon in place as a reminder to fire it up when 
I need it.

I thought I'd chase this down on the VirtualBox forums. It looks like 
the entire VirtualBox site is down.

Rather than wait until Monday I fell back on the bad habit of rebooting 
the machine. After booting I still got an error message about "executing 
'/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup' as root." This time it worked. Once finished 
I started up VirtualBox and one of my virtual machines. It worked as 
expected.

Message-ID: <20120428230608.GA11167@gate.kl-ic.com>

The Aastra phones arrived and power up.  The Sangoma card is here.
Half of the kool kids are at Linuxfest, but they should be back in
time to respond before monday evening.

SO - either Tuesday or Wednesday night, I would like to gather 
Linux/Asterisk/Phone geeks at my wife's clinic on Northwest Lovejoy
for an evening of Asterisk hacking, installing and configuring
phones, cards, dialplans, etc.  Bring a laptop with WEP compatible
G wireless.  Bring code.  Bring books.  Bring your own SIP phones.
Look at the Sangoma site for docs on the B600D card, and the Aastra
site for docs on the 9133i and the related 480i phones.

I expect we will spend two or three hours sometime between 5:30 and
10, depending on when people want to show up.  The actual install
of the Aastra 9133i phones and the Sangoma should be quick, design
and brainstorming will take longer. Perhaps we can grab some takeout
from one of the many restaurants on 23rd near Lovejoy.

Email me, vote for or against Tuesday or Wednesday, preferred times
or avoided times. 

This is major tweaking on a production system.  We will either
finish up, or put the old stuff back.  I have two nightly backups
of everything, and a replacement server if we /really/ mess stuff up.

We will be working near confidential patient data.  Good behavior
and privacy consciousness is required.  I say that to assure the
people who won't be there and worry a lot, rather than the good
people who show up to learn and participate.

I run something similar to the following out of crontab on a regular basis,
with the output mailed to me:

clamscan -r -d /var/lib/clamav -i --exclude-dir /mnt --exclude-dir /media
--exclude-dir /proc --exclude-dir /sys --exclude-dir /dev/pts --exclude-dir
/var/spool/amavis/virusmails  /

You'll want to tweak those options and parameters to meet your own needs, of
course.

Tuesday would work for me, Wednesdays are not.  Would prefer times
ranging from early afternoon to late evening.

So, with this encouragement, I stuck my bluetooth dongle into the usb
port on my desktop. KDE popped up a nice bluetooth icon in the system
tray which allowed me to pair the headset with dongle.  But still no
sounds in my ear when I play an mp3 file.  When I do an aplay -L to
see which devices alsa recognizes, my headset is not there.  If being
dumb is an advantage this would have worked long ago.  What am I
missing? Do I have to restart alsa, reload the modules? It may just be
muted, but my alsamixer doesn't show a bluetooth/usb device so?

This is just a guess, since I've never used a Bluetooth anything, but
are you running PulseAudio?  If so, what does the PulseAudio Volume
Control say?  PA may be muting your Bluetooth audio output.

All I can tell you is what worked on Lucid, which uses PulseAudio. In
the GUI I have a little loudspeaker icon in the panel whose main
function is to raise or lower the volume, but when I click on it I see
an option for Sound Preferences. That opens up a dialog box where I
select the Output tab. In that tab I see the bluetooth headphones as
well as the internal audio analog stereo. If I select the headphones
the sound comes out of the headphones. If I select internal analog
stereo the sound comes out of the speakers. Of course, if the bluetooth
headphones are not turned on they do not appear in the dialog box.
Having paired them once all I have to do is turn them on to get them to
appear, although it takes a moment while Lucid and the dongle think
about it.

I know Lucid uses PulseAudio, as there are launchers for various
PulseAudio tools.

Dale and John, I was not running PulseAudio, so I installed it and now
I do see a volume control for my Bluetooth headset, and it comes and
goes as I turn my headset on and off and it is not muted. But I still
don't hear anything. The other audio device I have, an analog speaker
connected to the sound card, also shows up on the volume control and
it does work fine.  I will continue this investigation, but if you
have any more ideas, let me know.

At the risk of insulting you, is there a volume button on the
headphones? (Mine have buttons for volume and track.) Do you have any
other bluetooth devices that work with the headphones, i.e., a cell
phone? Also, there are other tabs in the Sound Preferences dialog box;
I assume you have poked at all the possibilities. In my experience some
of the labels on the buttons are not very intuitive.

I wish I was there with my bluetooth headphones.

I have poked at all the buttons on  the headphones. The volume is all
the way up. It works fine with my cell phone.  There are lots more
buttons in Sound Preferences to push so there is still hope there.

for me, it's old news in the sense that wireless security is virtually
nonexistent. very, VERY few people actually put a really secure wireless
network together. there's a reason for that - it's hard! and plus, most
people have little they need to protect. most of the danger comes from
someone using your connection to do illegal things, which really is not all
that common.

the best you can hope for is that yours is slightly more difficult to break
than your neighbor's.

it's like parking your car next to a nicer car, in the hopes a vandal would
target the nicer car.

Nor all that dangerous.

The Personal Telco Project line is you should share anyway. ;-)

Also, wireless "security" doesn't help you at all once your bits leave
the wireless hop, so they should be encrypted end-to-end anyway, if
they are anything you don't want snooped.

For any kind of 'wireless encryption', its primary function is just to
tell people, "hey, my intent here is to not share this connection with
you" (which seems slightly rude and ungenerous, but nevermind).  A
wifi user without the key has to demonstrate some intent of his own to
override your wish, which exposes them to some potential legal
liability... unless they are associated with law enforcement somehow,
in which case they can act pretty much with impunity. :-(

IANAL, this is not legal advice.

The response has been strongly in favor of Tuesday, early evening,
for the PLUG Asterisk Hack at my wife's clinic.  

I plan to park at my wife's clinic at 2525 NW Lovejoy.  At 600p,
I'll walk to the Santa Fe Tacqueria at 23rd and Kearney for
some takeout, and be back by 630p to eat.  We start hacking at
700p.  It's over when it's over - I expect some people will
get what they need in an hour,  while I will be there late,
possibly restoring from backups if things get really messed up.

Parking is tricky.  The building gets locked up around 700p.
Contact me directly for more details, cell phone number, and
other random brainfarts.

It's non-news in that my WiFi, like my porch light, the shade of my 
trees and the scents of flowers, are all available for anyone to use.

This is just a short, one-time note to my techie friends and colleagues in
the field to  announce my new blog on all things sys-admin.  Please check it
out (http://www.pdxsys.com) , subscribe via e-mail or like it on Facebook
(http://www.facebook.com/pdxsys) if you wish , and spread the word.
 
Since its brand new, there's always the risk of surprises or design issues.
Please also be my beta testers and let me know of any problems or
improvements I should make.

Subject: [PLUG] PXE Distro Server availability?
Message-ID: <CAEtu1UfHypGdjnOhqxZ5ueSm9tzJLGCiE+5p6m4gnkriwzv8LA@mail.gmail.com>

Is the net boot server only available during the PLUG Sunday Clinic? I have
a Toshiba Netbook with a corrupted Debian install that I've been unable to
recover and the bios on supports net boot and not usb.

Nice job. I found one error when clicking on the Archives link:

Object not found!

The requested URL was not found on this server. The link on the referring
page <http://www.pdxsys.com/> seems to be wrong or outdated. Please inform
the author of that page <http://www.pdxsys.com/> about the error.

If you think this is a server error, please contact the
webmaster<%5bno%20address%20given%5d>
.
Error 404www.pdxsys.com

Apache/2.2.21 (Linux/SUSE)

Mark

P.S. I know you don't have any archived content as yet, but a more user
friendly error page would be more appropriate.

Hey,

Might there be any Django devs hanging around on the list?

I could use one and any recommendations you have.

Thanks,

Michael
