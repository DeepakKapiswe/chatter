Subject: [PLUG] Small hardened server
Message-ID: <4701A950.8040006@subtend.net>

Anyone know if I might find a device that:
 * Is small
 * Preferably fanless, but not a requirement
 * Two free 32-bit PCI slots
 * Redundant 110V power supply
 * Flash capable (CF, PATA port)

Small with redundant power seems to be difficult to find, even in the
extreme-temp embedded market.

I'm looking to build a trixbox server that needs POTS capability that I can wall
mount.  Anything delivering E911 must have redundant power.  I can get
affordable SiliconMechanics 2-U boxes with redundant power, but they're large,
noisy and CPU overkill.

It has content now, I'm guessing it was set up to only show changes  
from the last 7 days (or somesuch), and it (the wiki as a whole)  
hadn't been updated since the 18th.

Two 32-bit slots might be a deal-killer here.

Yeah, it seems to be an either-or thing.

Hm.  Is that strictly necessary, or just recommended?  That said,
there's a couple manufacturers who make redundant PSUs in standard
sizes.  Might check Chenbro.

I suspect you're gonna have to build your own system.

(Hm, that suggests to me an alternative, using a mini-ITX with one of
those 12v->ATX power supplies, powered by a 120VAC->12VDC power-supply
and maybe a float-charged 12V gel-cell, all tied together with diodes.)

Not a deal killer. Most (all?) of the Mini-ITX boards on the market work
just fine with dual-slot PCI risers. Remember that PCI is a bus, so just
because there is only one slot on the board, that doesn't mean it's all you
can use.

I'd suggest a fanless mini-ITX board like this one:
http://www.logicsupply.com/products/cn10000eg
With a riser like this one: http://www.logicsupply.com/products/ext_pcig
With a power supply like this one:
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817104158

I like the idea of powering the thing from redundant wall-wart setup, though
as Aaron suggested, I don't know of anything OTS that can do that. I too
question whether this is strictly required for E911. I've been closely
involved in two E911 telecom installations and I don't recall any of the
equipment used in them having redundant power. They had to be on a UPS, but
did not have to be redundant. These projects were several years ago though,
so the rules may have changed.

Some gotchas:
-All of the mini-itx board I've seen that have built-in CF slots _cannot_
boot from them. I have this feeling that there is one that came out recently
or is coming out soon that has bootable CF, but I'm not sure. So, unless the
specs on the board you find specifically says it can boot from CF, assume
you'll be booting some other way. I've run a couple machines off of IDE->CF
adapters and they work fine.
-Make sure you get "industrial" flash so it has extra long cell life. You
don't want to have to be swapping flash cards after a couple years of use.
-Are you sure that this will be enough horsepower? Since you're looking for
E911 compliance, that implies to me that you are likely doing this for a
larger installation. Is that true? If so, something like
http://www.logicsupply.com/products/ms_7265 will give you substantially more
horsepower, but still keep power consumption down. You can also go with
faster VIA based systems, which will draw less power than the Core machine,
but still not be quite as fast. Maybea good middle ground.
-Redundant power supplies are designed for servers, which means they will be
_loud_.

Thanks for the tips.  I'll take a look at some of these options. Also, before
people bring out very large red books and bombard the list with specs, the E911
redundant power requirement is a personal one, not industry standard. :)

I might go with something like this for something that doesn't have redundant power:

http://tinyurl.com/26o9g8 [advantech.com]

There are a lot of mini-itx based gadgets out there but I think there is
something to be said for long term supported motherboard designs, extended
temperature ranges, and RoHS compliance.  This install will be small, but
located in a hot, humid phone closet.

Just found the PLUG business card in a computer store on SE Powell.
I've been using Linux since about 2000.  And, umm... yep.  That's me in
a nutshell.

Quick question: I wrote a small Java app to do something in a shell
script, but I'm hoping someone knows of an existing native app that 
would do the same thing for me... namely, read an 8x8 pixel monochrome 
.PNG and spit out a string of 1s and 0s corresponding to the pixel 
values. (This is for a proof-of-concept visual similarity duplicate 
image finder, in case anyone wonders.)

Thanks!

Try: 

  $ convert foo.png foo.txt

The "convert" program is part of ImageMagick.  You can apply the
manipulator of your choice to the output to get precisely the format
you want.

Ah... I completely overlooked text in the list of convert's recognized 
formats.  I'm already using it to produce the 8x8 PNGs.

That advantech device looks pretty sweet. If your environment is going to be
relatively high-temp, a fanless design may not be the best bet. If you've
got high ambient, you really need that flow to get the heat off of the
components.

ImageMagick has a bunch of such utilities, also look at compare.
Jerry Peek in Linux Magazine had a series on ImageMagick, you might

I was driving around yesterday in Tualatin near I5 and boones ferry rd

wonder why my vanity plate didn't come thru!  Perhaps it was linus himself?

I've twice seen L1NUX on a Porsche Boxster at Zupans in Beaverton - but
didn't spot Linus inside.

Not that I care or anything, but I passed him on hwy 42 once.  He was in
a yellow sports car.

I don't think he's lived here long enough to have been able to grab
LINUX unless he hunted the owner down and made an offer.

One of my employees, Cooper, has OPN SRC.  It definitely helped him in
the interview[1].



[1] For the archives, no it didn't really help him, we're equal

He owns the trademark.  He can probably sue them to get it.  I guess
that's a kind of offer. ;-)

Message-ID: <20071004001047.GA29083@patch.com>

I know I have a problem with my .procmailrc.  when it's installed mail hangs
with 'status=bounced (Command time limit exceeded: "/usr/bin/procmail")'

My last action on the file was viewing it with vi (save the "you should have
used the proper tool of less" and "you don't have version control?" for off
list admonishments) to transfer a rule to Jennifer .procmailrc (her's is fine,
thank you for asking)

It is a few hundred lines in length.  It would be great to have a tool that
parses it and spits out warnings on the errors.  Is there such a thing?

I'd still like a procmailrc lint program. 
That, however, was not my problem.   See next message.

I've rebuilt it from a handy spam cache.

Don't RBLs usually only blacklist the sending host's IP, not the
domain of the return-address? Either way, if someone reported your
domain, getting off a blacklist is 'usually' a quick 1-2 hour wait
depending on the mood of the abuse department at AOL, Comcast or
whatever RBL you're on.

Backscatter happens all the time, and from my experience it's never a
huge problem on the home server side--just clean the queue if messages
are piling up there. If it's a huge flood, it may be easier on your
mailserver to blackhole instead of rejecting the messages, though I
think this is against some RFC..

Anyway good writeup, and good luck!

Ed,

   Very infrequently, I'll get one or two backscatter messages in the general
format you show. While I recognize what happened, I've no idea either what
to do, and I don't run a DNS server here, other than a cacheing one.

   Messages to fictitious users at my domain are rejected by postfix and are
part of the 6-8K rejections occurring each day.

Been happening to me for years (think of how many times
'merlyn at stonehenge.com' might have been scraped by now :).  I was worried the
first few times, and dutifully informed my ISP, but now it's just a daily
ritual to delete the blowback crap that comes back from spam that used
my name in From.  {sigh}

   The spam attempts that puzzle me the most (and for which the subscribers
of both the mail help and postfix mail lists had no insight) are the
messages addressed to 'rshepardXXXX at ...' where the XXXX represent four
random characters. I can reject hundreds of those per day. Why anyone would
think they'd hit on a legitimate username that way escapes my comprehension.

Thanks for the suggestion but I already do this (without Perl
and without memory issues) for real spammers and it works well.
But this backscatter volume is high and would create thousands
of rules. Besides it's coming from legitimate mail servers just
doing their job - victims like me. I'd like to find a better way.

   This used to be a non-issue with the EasySoftware PrintPro tools. But, now
that that's no longer available and I have only hplip to use, I'm restricted
in the information available to me. (HPLIP seems to be installed, but it
won't recognize the printers even when handed an IP address it knows is
valid. I've given up on getting it to work properly.)

   Anyway, since the system shut down with the crashed power supply I've not
needed to print anything. Today, I do need to print, and nothing seems to be
reaching the printer.

   Employing the troubleshooting hints on the hplip web site, I know this:

   1) I can ping the laser printer by both IP address and host name.

   2) I've restarted CUPS. The tail of /var/log/cups/error_log shows:

I [04/Oct/2007:10:23:57 -0700] Started backend /usr/lib/cups/backend/socket (PID 13955) for job 1886.

   Which looks OK to me.

   3) snmpwalk looks OK, too:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ snmpwalk -Os -c public -v 1 192.168.55.192 1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.3.9.1.1.7.0

5M;CLASS:PRINTER;DESCRIPTION:Hewlett-"

   But, nothing happens at the printer.

   What else can I test? How do I identify the problem so it can be solved?

Sigh. Mail servers that decide the acceptability of messages *after* 
the SMTP transaction has been completed will always create this sort 
of backscatter. The only alternatives are

  1. Scan mail during the SMTP transaction, so a message can be
     rejected without sending a separate rejection notice (which
     these days is almost always wrong-headed, even if it adheres
     to the letter of the SMTP RFCs, since the From: address is
     typically forged).

  2. Silently reject spam, malware, etc. without notifying anyone.

I hate the latter approach because of the possibility of losing a real 
transaction in the bit bucket.

The first approach is much, much better. Our mail server at work only 
accepts for delivery about 1/3 of the messages it receives. The rest 
are all rejected with 55x error codes (RBLs, SpamAssassin, ClamAV) 
during the SMTP transaction. Otherwise, we'd be sending out thousands 
of (99.999% bogus) bounce messages every week.

If you open your browser to http://localhost:631/printers/ (the CUPS 
web interface), can you see your printer?

Paul,

   I forgot about that. Yes, all printers are visible. The two to which I had
sent jobs show:

"Network host 'lj5' is busy; will retry in 25 seconds..."

   Printing a test page from this web page also fails.

To avoid a ton of troubleshooting, I'd suggest deleting your current 
printer definition and recreating it from scratch. It's not the Linux 
way, but CUPS just annoys me...

   I cleared this by stoping and restarting hplip and cups. Test page still
does not print.

   However, the PS files are placed in the queue, /var/spool/cups/.

   Heh. I could log in to "Administration" as root ... once. But it won't let
me do anything.

   I'll copy /etc/cups/printers.conf to a backup file and recreate it,
printer-by-printer. That should do the same as working via the BUI.

   Stay tuned for a report.

You nailed it, Paul. The problem is exactly as you describe.
I've built my policy daemon to deal with almost everything at
SMTP time. Anything that can't be dealt with there (then) is
silently discarded but logged.

Too bad we can't fix other people's mail servers in
the same way attackers change Windows behavior. :-)

   Well, ... this is turning into one of those computer days. Sigh.

   I turned off the printer, grabbed the latest hplip, built and installed
that (using 'make install', not 'hplip-install'), restarted cups, and ...
now the printer's working again.

   My apologies for the thread, but it was not working before at all. I
cannot explain why it started working again.

Another thing to think about.

here) are paying for the number of messages delivered, and some are  
paying for the number of messages sent. It doesn't take too much  
effort to make sure all the messages I send out are delivered  
*SOMEWHERE*.

As long as they aren't rejected, they are delivered.

I think I will do some research into what State governments and the Federal
government is doing to legislate SPAM. IMHO, SPAM is like telemarketing; I
don't like it but there appears to be some legal protections with respect to
free speech.

I am seeing a big increase in mailbounce spam with the return address 
being an admin address for one of my domains.  Most are from Russia.

Quite annoying.

I planned on installing policyd, but it requires using mysql.  I have 
planned on rewriting it to use sqlite, but have not had the time.

This is not Free Speach.  This is abuse of resources. I have yet to find a 
spammer that uses his own machines and bandwidth.  Instead they use any 
machine they can hijack.  They steal resources.

The feds go after them when they can.  Many are off shore.

The only spammer that has been delt with effectivly was a Russian a few 
years back.  I think they found him in a ditch.

------------------------------------------
Well, the same could be said about telemarketing and junk snail-mail. These
are both an abuse of resources and labor. In the instance of telemarketing,
it is abuse of telephone bandwidth. In the instance of junk snail-mail, it
is an abuse of federal income tax revenue dollars that is subsidizing the US
Postal Service (as well as the physical labor the postal carries provide
delivering such junk snail-mail). I don't mean to defend SPAM, I dispise it,
but I have a gut feeling that there are some legal constitutional
protections that allow it to continue.

Russ,

   Interesting. I know nothing about the spam business.

> As long as they aren't rejected, they are delivered.

   Here they're all rejected. Never had one make it through.

   SPAM and telemarketing calls are easily dealt with. FAX spam is a
different story, and one I'd like to see addressed.

    I gather that it has to do with spammers and email,
    Is it a spammer taking over your server or using it to spam with?

I find it a bit offensive for the linked article to assume it is due to a
hacked Windows box. I have a Windows server and a Linux server, and the
Linux server is receptive to this hack whereas the Windows server is not. Go
figure...

That's what I've done. My policy daemon uses sqlite for tables
and tinycdb for relatively static lists. I'm pleased with the 
performance. However, my daemon doesn't fork (yet). If I made it
fork I'm wondering about sqlite concurrency issues. Do you have
any experience with this?

It is no assumption. It is fact as I know it. See my
2005 article on this subject - and remember that this
was written in 2005;  some things have changed since
then.

Not true. Your server is not the cause of the attack.
There's no vulnerability in your server being exploited.

Some other computer in the world is sending spam using
your domain name. The bounces come back to your
server regardless of what operating system your
server uses.

The vulnerability being exploited is in the
computer that's sending the spam.

This just out from eBay - rootkitted Linux boxes are a growing source
http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/scrt/CD0B9D97EE6FE411CC25736A000E4723


When it comes to launching online attacks, criminals are getting more organised
and branching out from the Windows operating system, says eBay's security chief.

[multi-paragraph snip]

Cullinane's experience with phishing goes back to his previous employer,
Washington Mutual, which has been one of the top phishing targets in the US.

While there, he noticed an unusual trend when taking down phishing sites.

"The vast majority of the threats we saw were rootkitted Linux boxes, which was
rather startling. We expected Microsoft boxes," he said.

It's illegal and has been for a long time.  What's more, if you can
track down the FAX spammer, you can collect $500/FAX:

Hosting sites that do not install Yum.  (I know of at least one.)  I blame

Aaron,

   Theoretically, that's true. In Oregon you can even ask for triple
damamges. We tried that once, but got nowhere. The only person I know who
made a little money from suing -- and stopped a portion of his fax spam --
is a Vancouver lawyer. He let me use his letter content, but since his
letterhead showed the threat came from a lawyer, the spammers paid more
attention to him than they did to me.

It is one of those laws that exists, but gets little or no enforcement. 
Given the current political climate, I doubt it will get any any time 
soon.  (Consumer protection is a pretty low priority these days.)

Without belittling the differences in the various security models 
employed by MS, *nix, Apple, etc., the major difference between a 
secure box and a rooted one is the person with administrative 
passwords.

In terms of security, I'll take Windows with a good admin over Linux 
with a doofus any day.

>From my experience:
 * Standard accounts (root, etc) with default or trivial passwords
 * Exploitable web applications (PHP apps are not the only offenders here)
 * Exploitable daemons (FTP and others)
 * Kernel exploits to gain root from user access 

The first is (l)user error on the part of the sysadmin.  The other three
are "unpatched boxes", which is a common condition if the sysadmins are not
perfectly disciplined about tracking and updating what's on their boxes.

It's easy to stay patched if you're running a current distro and
every bit of software was installed with APT or YUM or whatever.

But many hosts are running distros that were installed years ago, hacked
into submission with random tarballs and then ignored until the next
time someone starts shouting about some new website feature.

One of my boxes got hit when a brute-force SSH login script guessed a
password for a test account.  They attempted to get root but failed (I
do a regular apt-get update so it's well-patched) and so they settled
for running a userspace thingy to sling traffic around.

It's nice to have chkrootkit around, but of course you can't really
trust what a rooted machine tells you.  I just keep an eye out for
suspicious net traffic.

Running a current distro with APT or YUM or whatever and a huge
selection of maintained packages (e.g. Debian and its derivatives) saves
a *LOT* of hassle in keeping systems patched and running.

With growing ease of Linux use and tools like, as Alan pointed out, Plesk the

Sorry to hear that.  Besides reporting it to a federal agency that won't
do anything about it, it's all you can do.

They pay even more attention to a lawsuit, a judgement, a lein or a
collection agent, than to a lawyer.

That said, maybe I could get my niece to write something up.

I have a Word template that has form fields. I can fill in the fields,

inserting into place. (I am told by colleagues that Word does not use
pop-ups either.)

I looked through the Options, but there is so much stuff there that I

Subject: [PLUG] Permissions Denied - CDROM
Message-ID: <47066F41.6010109@comcast.net>

Can anyone offer an idea as to why I get "Permissions Denied" when I try
to mount certain CDROMs?

On my recent trip to the Tetons I took along my WinXP laptop so I could
download my Canon Digital Rebel each evening. After downloading, I also
burned a CD so I had a backup of what was on the laptop hard drive.

Today, I tried looking at those CDs on my Linux box (SuSE 10.1). When I
put the CD into the drive, I get an alert box that says, "Permissions
Denied". If I put the CD into the laptop drive, I can read the files
that are on it with the Canon software.

I have already copied the files from the laptop to my Linux box over my
home network. While I have yet to download a program that can deal with
Canon's .crw files, Konqueror happily displays Canon's .thm 160 x 120
jpeg images. (Why Canon chose to put the .thm extension on them I don't
know. Konqueror looked inside and found the jpeg.)

Anyway, I'd like to understand what's going on. I burned those CDs as
multiple sessions, leaving the disk open at the end of each session. I
don't know if that matters to Linux or not.

   Thanks very much for the insight. I looked up Plesk on the Web and see how

It is even worse than that.  Its choices in software are hard to 
administer outside of the tools provided. For example, the version of 
Qmail they use has special hacks that provide their functionality, but 
does not include the patch that 99% of all spam programs for Qmail want to 
hook into it.

Not fun.

As for my opinion of Qmail, please read me sig line...

Plesk is incompatible with secure servers, because it just about  
*requires* one to run vulnerable software, in order for Plesk to keep  
working right, and does not self patch so more secure versions in a  
timely manner.

I don't.

I blame lazy distros, who don't keep on top of security (Cent,  
Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL... the whole lot of 'em are to blame).
I blame lazy admins, who think that uptime is more important than  
security upgrades (if you are running a machine a year old, maybe you  
*deserve* to be rootkit'ed).
I blame users (and admins) who don't understand that a disturbingly  
large number of "web applications" are complete and total rubbish  
(Joomla, WordPress, phpBB, phpNuke, Plesk, phpMyAdmin, cPanel... the  
list is insane) when it comes to security.

So, here's a quick survey:
Who has a web server that was running PHP 5.2.4, openSSL 0.9.8d,  
Apache 2.2.6, and a 2.6.22.9 kernel *before* I sent this message?
(I expect crickets, but will buy a beer (or quite a few) for anybody  
who is keeping *actually* current, rather than "distro-current"....  
Python- and Perl-centric servers can apply, but only if they are  
running the latest security-fix sources as well.)

If not, *why* not, because those *are* the latest security patches  
for those very simple, *core*, pieces of most linux web servers?

What is a secure server?  By your other post, it seems more that the 
level of security on a server is by effort of the admin to keep it up to 
  date in the context of security.  Why does running Plesk not allow 
this?  I am on a couple security mailing lists and semi-regularly check 
a few security sites for reports, but am by no means an expert.  I don't 
know you, but it's possible that you could make me look silly in this 
arena, and no doubt there is always a bigger fish that could make your 
efforts look ameture.  So it's difficult to draw a line here.  Security 
requires multi-facet, multi-level prevention, and sometimes running 
something that has a bad track record is mitigated by other counter 
measures.

I guess my point is, most people (hopefully) sit and put a lot of 
thought into what they want to run on their servers/machines.  Some of 
the decisions yield to business plans and goals, but in any case, 
security should alway be a concern, and effort is required to lessen the 
risk.  SWsoft does provide means for keeping Plesk up to date.  The 
level of effectiveness could be argued, but it's something.  You're not 
wrong, I just think there's more to it.

I'm in the market for a new DVD burner. ENU has several brands - Asus,
LG, LiteOn, NEC, Pioneer. Any preferences?

All of their DVD burner offerings come with Nero software. Nero provides
binaries for 32- and 64-bit systems in DEB and RPM packages. Does anyone
have any experience with Nero?

TIA.

Dick,

   I just bought a replacement for the dying SCSI cd-rw. Upon Galen's
recommendation I bought the Samsung SH-S203B. Here's the description from
Newegg's site:

SAMSUNG Black 20X DVD+R 8X DVD+RW 12X DVD+R DL 20X DVD-R 6X DVD-RW 12X
DVD-RAM 16X DVD-ROM 48X CD-R 32X CD-RW 48X CD-ROM 2MB
Cache SATA 20X DVD?R DVD Burner - OEM

   It may even turn on the coffee maker, but I've not yet tried that. $36
with 3 day shipping.

Rich

Major caveat: I'm not a Suse user, but...

There are many posts out there that turn up by googling ' Suse CD-rom
"permissions denied" '.  A couple of them said that Suse 10.1 doesn't need a
cdrom entry in /etc/fstab,
and that removing that entry  solved the problem.

I've had good luck with all those, except LG. I have no experience with
those positive or negative.
I currently own an NEC, and it's been a workhorse. No problems whatsoever.

As for Nero, eh, I used it when it first came out, but it didn't offer
anything above what the OSS burning tools could give me, and it was wrapped
up in a really cluttered interface. I removed it quickly.

I've generally had good luck with Samsungs as well, and they are usually
really really quiet. However, there was one model of CD-RW that I deployed
at work once and they were super flaky.

By and large, optical drives have become so commoditized, you would be hard
pressed to find a bad one from a major label. I'd suggest deciding if there
is some feature you really want (quiet, particularly good DAO, lightscribe,
ability to rip Wii games, etc) and just get the cheapest one that has that
feature.

Thanks. That did the trick. The only difference is that a Konqueror
window showing the contents of the CD no longer starts automagically.
That is a minor convenience that I can easily get around. The CD still
auto-mounted.

   I wonder if SuSE is using HAL. That's new with Slackware-12.0 and the
upgrade instructions are to remove all optical drive references from
/etc/fstab to avoid confusing the automatic detection of devices. If I
understand correctly, HAL also detects USB, Firewire, and other devices when
they're connected.

Recovering from my forgetting about Google for this sort of thing, I
find that yes, SuSE 10.1 does use HAL.

I have no problem with my USB memory stick. When I stick it into a USB
port a Konqueror window opens and shows the content.

I replaced my stock HP DVD-RW with a BenQ and I've been very happy with
it.  It writes DVD+/-R, DVD-RW, CD+/-R, CD-RW, MP-3, DiVix, etc.  

I think I found the best pricing at Buy or NewEgg.

It is fully supported under Linux and works very nicely with K3B

My recommendation was really just meant as an example of a SATA DVD

I highlighted binary updates, but yes, there is so much more. There's  
iptables, log monitoing, change management (tripwire), password  
rotations, weak password checking, service monitoring, disabling un- 
needed binaries/services/accounts... it's a long list.

>   Why does running Plesk not allow

These are *some* of the packages that have to be constantly monitored  
and upgraded when using Plesk:
http://download1.swsoft.com/Plesk/Plesk8.2/Doc/plesk-8.2-unix- 
installation-guide/18518.htm

(They don't mention managing MySQL in that program list, for  
example... which *must* be running on a Plesk machine.)

Plesk simply loads too many fragile, explosive, packages, and simply  
cannot afford (business-wise) to keep rebuilding and updating all of  
them, without having to do a nightly download/rebuild on *all* of the  
machines it's installed on. So, when a zero-day on PostNuke comes  
out, Plesk users have to get packages built and installed  
immediately... which ain't gonna happen.

As a different, *much* more simple, example of what I think is  
fundamentally wrong with Plesk, an admin-level db password is stored  
on the hard-drive.

....In plaintext.

This kind of architectural/security "no-no" is so jaw dropping, eye- 
popping, just plain *bad* enough that it can make experienced admins  
weep.

(Of course, it's also helped me un-bonk some plesk problems for  
clients, so FYI, the plesk mysql master user is "admin", the pass is  
'hidden' in /etc/psa/.psa.shadow )

I agree, and yet, the weakest link in the chain is where something  
usually breaks....I usually hear this solution referred to as "belt- 
and-suspenders" security, where *two* systems have to blow up as the  
same time, for example, both a hardware firewall and iptables, or  
plesk and tripwire.

> SWsoft does provide means for keeping Plesk up to date.

Yes, but to keep all of Plesk's internal *packages* up to date is the  
challenge, especially with so many known "bad actors" in there.

You are right, I was trying to simplify a great deal, and may have

Oracle has been doing this for years in their enterprise software
offerings.  In fact, I have to supply a username and password on the
command line to fire up an Oracle ERP 11.5.10 application server.
(But it's handy because I can do a "history|grep adstrtal" if I forget
the password.)  All this on an enterprise accounting system, where
security should count for something.  Which planet is Oracle
University located on, anyway?  Maybe it's a perfect world, where no
one does dishonest things online and you can throw 16 CPUs and 16G RAM
at every problem.

Subject: [PLUG] RESOLVED: Debian Xen + Broadcom NetXtreme II (IBM x3655
	7985-AC1)
Message-ID: <470834AB.6050800@subtend.net>

I have a new x3655 IBM and whenever the /etc/xen/scripts/network-bridge
script starts, the ethernet would no longer work.  This post isn't about
the cause, but the fix.  I did a lot of tcpdumps and Googling, but I'll
spare you that.  All they do is prove that yes, there is an issue. :)

I tried Debian 4.0 i386/amd64 and Ubuntu 7.04 Server i386/amd64 and they
all exhibit the problem.

Upgrading the bnx2 driver is the key.  I came to find bnx2 is included
in the initrd.  Debian comes with 1.4.44 and Ubuntu 1.4.45 of the
driver.  As of this writing 1.5.10c is the latest from Broadcom and is
what I ended up using.

Summary:
 * Install kernel source, make config/prepare the distro's config file
 * Download bnx2 source, compile and install
 * Update initrd
Here are step by step instructions for clean install of Debian 4.0 amd64:

aptitude install linux-source unzip
cd /usr/src
tar jxf linux-source-2.6.18.tar.bz2
ln -s linux-source-2.6.18 linux
cd linux
cp /boot/config-2.6.18-5-xen-amd64 ./.config
make oldconfig (<enter> through all the prompts to take defaults)
make prepare
cd /tmp
wget http://www.broadcom.com/docs/driver_download/NXII/linux-1.5.10c.zip
unzip linux-1.5.10c.zip
cp Server/Linux/Driver/bnx2-1.5.10c.tar.gz /usr/src
cd /usr/src
tar zxf bnx2-1.5.10c.tar.gz
cd bnx2-1.5.10c/src
make
make install
mv /boot/initrd.img-2.6.18-5-xen-amd64 \
/boot/initrd.img-2.6.18-5-xen-amd64.orig
update-initramfs -k `uname -r` -c
reboot

Verify:
zcat /boot/initrd.img-2.6.18-5-xen-amd64.orig|strings|grep "bnx2 v"
Broadcom NetXtreme II Gigabit Ethernet Driver bnx2 v1.4.44 (August 10, 2006)

zcat /boot/initrd.img-2.6.18-5-xen-amd64|strings|grep "bnx2 v"
Broadcom NetXtreme II Gigabit Ethernet Driver bnx2 v1.5.10c (May 4, 2007)

Joe jobbing is a (e)smtp mail attack?

My mail server that is Internet facing can only
relay to me and only to mail accounts that are
listed.  My mailhub is behind the Net.  Good
luck joe jobbing me.

Can't SPF filtering checking my own SPF record 
keep people from pretending to be me???

Most spammers don't attempt to pretend they are 
me anyways.

How do I configure postfix to reject any

initiate communication without causing 
outgoing connections to fail?


-------       /-----\
| HUB |--->---| NET |
-------       \-----/

Notice the arrow which means, only from the HUB.

If someone tries to initiate email transfer to 
HUB from NET directly, I want them to get, 
550 this is not a relay.  Noone should be
attempting to do this anyways because my
mailhub receives NET email from one of two
dedicated relays which are listed as the
mail exchangers for the NET.

An only out server on the relay machines
strikes me as an option, but I don't know
how to implement one.

If you have an email address at all you can be joe jobbed.  There are 
different ways it can happen.  Look up the wikipedia article on it as 
has been mentioned already.

What about those of us that don't use PHP for our Web apps because
of it's abysmal security track record? Do we get a beer?

What about those of us who keep on top of the bugs fixed in
the kernel and only upgrade when we're affected?

I don't use Apache for serving all my Web content. My Web proxy
directs requests to the Web server whose features best match
the content. Absolutely static content is served by publicfile.
thttpd serves content that requires includes. Apache is used
for everything else but this is a small percentage of the total
number of Web pages. A Web site might be served by 3 web servers.
Certainly this is worth a beer.

Most people on this list use distributions. They expect that the
distributor will keep all the software current. If they try to
keep their systems more current than the distribution they can
mess things up unless they know what they're doing. I think it's
unrealistic to expect them to take on this task, especially when
they're running sites where a rare break-in is not going to
bankrupt a business or leak national secrets.

I'd take a different approach. If it's not listed as
an MX, I'd use this as a honeypot and blacklist any
host that tries to use it.

For classic phone lines and the USPS though, I don't pay anything to *receive*
a message.  That's why telemarketing calls are forbidden to cell phones,
because in general, the reciever *pays* for airtime.  That's also why spam is
worth being regulated, because in general, the recipient *pays* (in the form
of having to buy more bandwidth, either individually or collectively) for the
delivered message.

1. It is nearly impossible to add software, secure or insecure, to a 
standard stable distribution like RHEL/CentOS or Etch, with standardized 
repositories and built-in security, bug fix and new feature update 
services. If you want to run a stable, secure server using such a 
distro, *don't* think outside the box. Don't run "testing" or "unstable" 
packages, don't get RPMs or DEBs from anywhere other than the built-in 
repositories, and don't install anything from raw source. Period. Full stop.

2. The *only* advantage a secure Linux server has over a secure Windows 
server is that the major Linux server distros release security updates 
much more frequently than Microsoft does. *Both* are exploitable, *both* 
are targets of hackers and crackers, and *both* require eternal 
vigilance as the price of security.

Leaving aside the difference between a hobby server and a business 
server, if Linux becomes the kind of tool for distributed denial of 
service attacks that Windows has become, it's all over for Linux! The 
corporate giants will shove Linux into the flaming pits of Heck. You 
won't be able to get CentOS -- you'll have to buy RHEL. You won't be 
able to get openSuSE, you'll have to buy Novell's version, and you won't 
be able to get Etch/Lenny/Sid, you'll have to buy Ubuntu.

So take on the task! Run secure or face oblivion. :)

It's not nearly impossible. I do it regularly. You just have to
know what parts of the filesystem are off limits to you because
the distribution's package management "owns" that space. You _do_
have to pay attention to, for example, which TCP and UDP ports
daemons use, system startup weirdness, and more.

Given that we're talking about servers here - not desktops:

I think you're giving the open source development model too little
credit for generally producing much more secure code. I'd rather
run older versions (weeks or months older - not years older) of
open source daemons that current Windows services.

I assume you know that there are other advantage of running a
secure Linux server and you limited your comments to security
issues only. If not, I have much more to say.

You're probably correct about this. It's one reason why I'm
not anxious to have Linux replace corporate desktops. That's
Apple's job.

I don't know that ls has a simple way to list only directories, but
there are a few workarounds:

1.  ls -F | grep /
The "-F" option appends an extra character to non-file entries, making
it easier to distinguish them. Directories earn a slash.  grep can be
used to filter out anything that doesn't have a slash.

2.  find -maxdepth 1 -type d
The "-maxdepth 1" option is necessary to keep find from searching all
the way down the file system tree. The "-type d" option lists only
directories (surprise!).

There are many ways to do most things, but here are two I came up with
right away:

  $ find -maxdepth 1 -type d

or if you really want to use ls, something like this:

  $ ls -p1 | grep '/$' | sed 's|/$||'

Thanks guys, you were a help. I'm curious what the "reverse" command would be 
for ls to list JUST files, but not any directories?  I know this could go on 
and on, so I'll stop here....I did try looking this up but no joy, a bit more

It locked up and I can't kill it. I have a Force Quit button that I
keep on my panel. It appeared to have killed it, but when I try to
relaunch Firefox it tells me that it is already running. System Monitor
shows firefox.bin running as a zombie. I right-clicked on it and tried
all the options (stop process, end process, kill process), but it won't
die. I opened a terminal and tried top, but it is not listed in top.
However, System Monitor says it is process 15852, so I just entered
that in top as the process to kill. Still no joy.

Those are the only ways I know of to kill something. Can someone
suggest a tool with a heavier payload? Nuclear?

   Zombies can't be killed. They're left over when a parent process dies and
leaves orphaned child processes.

   If you've run -- as root -- 'kill -9 firefox.bin', you've done as much as
you can without rebooting to clear away the zombies. There may be another
thread or two still open.

"kill -9 {pid]"  is about as nuclear as you can get.
If that won't do it, you'd probably have to reboot the box.

I think top sends sig 15 (term) by default.  To kill it dead, you want 
signal 9 (kill).

  kill -9 15852

   I know others here run Slackware, so this is addressed to those folks.

   This weekend I've sort of upgraded my notebook from Slackware-11.0 to
-12.0, but have encountered major network and X issues. Is
alt.os.linux.slackware the best source for help, or are there mail lists or
other resources that might be better. Yes, there are _major_ changes in the
upgrade, more serious than the upgrade from -10.2 to -11.0. And, I followed
the CHANGES-AND-HINTS file step-by-step.

   For example, I cannot connect to the network and there is no longer
'route' or 'netstat'. And, my Xfce4 configuration was blown away, and
running that app trashes the display. I'm stymied and need expert help.

   Of course, I'm not upgrading -- or starting to, at any rate -- my
workstation/server until I get all these issues resolved and know how to
make the second box go smoothly and error-free.

   Pointers to resources appreciated (and not not to whatever your favorite
distribution is).

No need for workarounds (at least with gnu bash and ls.)

  ls -d */

But that relies on the shell glob */ expanding to all of the 
directories, which means it can't be inverted to "just files" (i.e. 
*[!/] won't do) because glob's won't match / (or leading .) with a 
wildcard (not even in Denmark.)  So, the "invertable pair" is:

  find -maxdepth 1 -type d
  find -maxdepth 1 -not -type d

...but that lists hidden files, so...

  find -maxdepth 1 -type d -not -name '.*'
  find -maxdepth 1 -not -type d -not -name '.*'

And if your vendor is mean enough (bsd/mac) to deprive you of a gnu 
userland, the first argument to find has to be an explicit '.'

  find . -maxdepth 1 -type d -not -name '.*'
  find . -maxdepth 1 -not -type d -not -name '.*'

(or else you'll get the unhelpful:

  find: illegal option -- m
  find: illegal option -- a
  find: illegal option -- e
  find: illegal option -- p
  find: illegal option -- t
  find: illegal option -- h
  find: 1: No such file or directory
)

So, back to our cozy linux box:

  ls --file-type | grep -v '/$'

or (heh)

  ls -- $(ls -l | grep -v '^d') 2>/dev/null

That last one has plenty of caveats though ;-)  (i.e "Professional 
driver, closed course.  Do not attempt.")

You might want to make aliases for 'files'

  alias files="find . -maxdepth 1 -not -type d -not -name '.*' \
    | sed 's/^.\///'"

Then you can have your colors back (but -a won't work here)

  ls $(files)

For continuing fun, see `help alias` and the manpages for ls, find, and 
glob and the bash manual:
  http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#SEC26

specifically:
  http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#SEC30

That's odd.  Maybe there were more.  Next time try `ps ax | grep 
firefox` or maybe `killall -9 /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/firefox-bin` 
(assuming that this is the absolute path you see in ps.)

Kill should always work on userland hang-ups (i.e. anything not 
involving the kernel (like mount) should easily get the rug pulled from 
under it without a reboot), and typically without even needing root 
intervention so long as you're the owner of the given process.

"man find" has the details.

I would say 'while maintaining the existing bug fix and new feature  
update services', and be in total agreement, otherwise, I would be  
inclined to vehemently disagree.

It's quite possible to "fork" a distro, and run secure, current  
versions, provided that the distro *knows* it is no longer going to  
maintain those pieces of software, *and* the appropriate packages  
that are being removed are replaced with sources are compiled and  
installed *into the same locations* as a given distribution expects.  
This can be a bit of work.

I generally prefer to back up the rpm files, uninstall the rpm's, and  
tweak the heck of of the source configure/compiles/installs on things  
I'm using until everything gets installed in the exact right places,  
the exact right ways.... sometimes using a blend of what was provided  
by the sources, and what vendor tweaks have been added. Using a  
"reference" test machine (with original rpm's) and "compiles" test  
machine (with source compiles) can help a lot.

FAIR WARNING:
This is not a process that takes hours. This can take days, or even  
*weeks*, to get right, for each "flavor" of machine, especially if  
you're doing something that has a complex chain, like getting current  
versions of apache/openssl/php/mysql/gd compiled into one screaming- 
fast binary.

Add in variations between RHEL3, RHEL4, RHEL5, FC4, FC9, CentOS 5...  
and you can see why some companies have one person who does nothing  
*but* manage this process as a full time job.

Uhm, that's what started the conversation, no? That such a thing is  
*already* happening? And PLUG discussing ideas on *why* this is  
happening?

Actually, kill -9 15852 just didn't work, but kill -9 firefox.bin gave
me an error message that kill needed a process number.

I couldn't agree more, and I have no explanation for why kill didn't
work, other than the fact that it was a zombie. It seems to me that if
the owner of the process says to kill the process, then there ought to
be a command with sufficient force to kill it. (And I did sudo the
commands as well, just in case forefox.bin thought I wasn't the owner.)
Even if it's a zombie, the owner of the process ought to be able to
nuke it. Maybe I need a "really really really kill it and I mean it"
command.

This is not the first time that Firefox has done this to me. I wish
Opera would hurry up and get their final 64-bit version released. I
have the alpha installed and it actually runs better than Firefox.

That's exactly why you can't 'kill' it. A zombie is already dead.  
It's consuming almost zero resources. A zombie has transfered from  
the userspace to the kernel space and is now a child of init. It's  
waiting to be reaped by it's parent process (ppid in ps -l) If the  
ppid isn't around anymore, then it will never go away until you reboot.

You can't kill what's already dead.

   You've identified the problem here. The process is a zombie because it no
longer has a live owner. It's an orphan process.

   Now, if there was a tool that could specifically seek out zombies and kill
them off, that would be a different story.

When I was running ye olde Slack, I got most of my help in #slackware on
EFnet. I see they also have a freenode channel nowadays. I'm sure someone in
there would be willing and able to help you out.

   Thanks, Quentin. I'll give that a try ... as soon as I find a tool and
learn how to use it. :-)

   And, I just discovered there are mail lists and web-based fora specific to
Slackware, in addition to a.o.l.s.

Kernel vulns are rare.  Remotely-exploitable ones far more so.

PHP does make it easy for newbs to write web-apps quickly, which leads
to big security holes.  But the big-name apps are getting much better.

A lot of mine is older than that.  And patched.
Do you not believe that it's possible to patch vulns in older versions?

I'm sorry, I always assume that everyone is familiar with IRC. If you have
a  functional X setup, xchat is one of the better IRC clients on Linux. If
you are console-only, Irssi is probably your best bet. If stranded on a
Windows machine, Mirc would be my first choice. All of those (except maybe
Irssi?) include server lists out of the box, connect to either the list
Freenode or EFnet server, and once connected, join the #slackware channel.
This can be done by entering "/join #slackware" on the IRC command line.
More good info for new IRC users can be found at http://www.irchelp.org/.

   Well, I know what it is, and I think that I've used it twice in the past
decade. :-) I prefer e-mail, direct and mail lists.

   Think that I had BitchX installed once; it seems to have slipped away.
I'll go find xchat.

Cautions on mIRC:

1. It's shareware, not free in either sense.
2. It's *very* popular, so there are a lot of malware scripts available 
for infecting your PC. I don't know how well #EFnet is policed for stuff 
like that, but some of the other networks just plain aren't safe to run 
mIRC on.

KVirc does have a Windows port, and I think XChat will run under Cygwin.

Because every vendor-driven package manager I've used lately is 1-24  
months behind the latest security and stability fixes for some (or in  
a few cases, many) of its packages. I understand the whole idea of  
"stable" or "tested" (QA'd, certified, whatever) packages, but  
somehow, I tend to think that "this is so stable that it reliably  
lets attackers exploit it every time, and we won't fix it right now  
in case somebody *depends* on that feature!".... is not exactly a  
desirable condition.

This year so far, I counted 6 remote kernel vulns, 14 local kernel  
vulns.

I dunno what the metric for "rare" is, but if we don't find any more  
remote vulns this year, that's an average of a new remotely  
exploitable kernel  vuln every 2 months, or, since we're in october,  
that's an average of two new kernel vulns (20/10) found every month.

For this (getting better), I am thankful. Pity that their names often

Oh, it's *quite* possible, I could put out a  
bind-4.0-12581768179f.rpm package right now, that was built from  
source that's been patched all the way up to bind 9.5 code (without  
bind 9.5 features). Sure, it's misleading, and sure, it leads to  
serious confusion about what version is *actually* being run, and  
sure, without side by side source compares, or a vendor just hoping  
that it's users will "trust them to be current/secure", the end-user  
has no idea if they're running a current version.... but I certainly  
agree, it's *possible*.

I'm not exactly sure it's a *good idea*, though.

But in the spirit of making sure I dole out my beers right, so far, I  
owe Jon Scully for being version complete, Ed Sawiky for dodging the  
bullet by segmenting out (and thus nearly eliminating) the typical  
"problem child" binaries, and if you're actually monitoring the  
source patches, rather than giving a hoot about "version numbers",  
I'll gladly buy you a version of the package beer-0.1a-116987121.rpm  
(an early teaspoon version of beer that was actually patched up to  
being to a full beer).

Actually a zombie is a process that has exited but whose exit status has
not been retrieved by it's parent via a wait system call.  Every process
has a parent, if a processes parent exits, it is inherited by process 1.
Process 1 is init which is always waiting for processes those scavenging
zombies.  There is no way I know of to kill a zombie process as a zombie
is already dead.

Message-ID: <20071008205404.5ce5b2c9.johnxj@comcast.net>

I just installed the newly released Adobe Reader 8.1 for Linux and it
wants the location for a file called libgtkembedmoz. This is the html
rendering library for Firefox. I have this file in /usr/bin/firefox
but, unfortunately, my Firefox is 64 bit. Adobe Reader 8.1 is 32-bit.
(Yeah, don't get me started.) I pointed it at the file, but it insists
that it can't find the file. If someone who has a 32-bit installation
with 32-bit Firefox could e-mail me that file I'll stick it somewhere
and point Reader to it. Hopefully that will shut Reader up about it.

Thanks in advance.

Thanks Rogan and Don. I tried it and it's still not working. But I now

He's giving me more stuff to try.

You may have gotten (and discarded) this solution, but here is what I do-
run 32bit Firefox.  Actually on Linux I run the Swiftfox modified version,
32bit.
I run Fedora 7 64bit, but since most of the Web 2.0 (tm) (roll-eyes)
crap...er stuff out there needs flash or what-have-you, and those are still
as far as I know 32bit only,
the best way to go about web browsing for now anyway is to use 32bit browser
with all the 32bit extensions.
I haven't tried the new Adobe yet but I can only guess that if you use 32bit
Firefox it should work with that OK.
Your 64bit distro does have the 32bit compatibility libraries I am
guessing?

   Pardon me for jumping in, but I have a question because I'm a non-expert,
non-IT professional. I'd appreciate the insight your answer(s) will provide.

   When I read the notices that accompany the infrequent Slackware security
updates I'm struck by their pro-active nature. Every one I can recall said
that it was a potential vulnerability, but no actual exploitation of that
vulnerability was known. Some vulnerabilities are specific to local users,
others to network-external ones. They also seem rather remote to me,
depending on a combination of factors occuring simultaneously that would be
highly infrequent. I upgrade anyway even if they don't seem applicable to
our tiny local network.

   Wouldn't a better metric of security be related to exploitations rather
than vulnerabilities that are potenial rather than actual? We all know that
there are still -- despite all sorts of laws and enforcement activities --
too many drunk (or drugged) drivers on the road, teenage drivers sending
text messages from behind the steering wheel, and folks who fall asleep and
drift across the road into on-coming traffic. Combined, quite high
vulnerabilities every time we're driving state and county highways. Yet the
actual incidence is low compared to the exposure. Isn't this also true in
network/system security?

When connected to the Internet you are on the same road as the billions of
others at the same moment.  Should the automated process that targets the
vulnerability you've not patched and isn't blocked by your firewall sweep into
your IP address you're toast.

   I understand this, Michael. I thought the situation was that most of these
vulnerabilities were conceptual and not actively being exploited. That's why
I thought that measures of exploitation would be more useful.

Actually (at least on Ubuntu amd64) you can get 32-bit flash plugins
working in your 64-bit browser. I use 64-bit Firefox (without flash)
for most browsing, but I also have 64-bit Opera 9.5 (alpha) with flash
in case I want to see something on youtube.

As for the 32-bit libraries, several months ago, when building a new
computer, I experimented with tons of other distros, including 64-bit
Fedora 7, at the time recently released. It was very nice and I was
sorely tempted. One thing that I noticed about it was that installing
32-bit apps was a snap compared to 64-bit Ubuntu. I hated to give that
up, but I missed my Synaptic too much.

The Adobe guy gave me a bunch of other instructions overnight. I'll
fiddle with them later today. But it appears the only advantage to
Reader 8.1 is that now you can have an online meeting with a client to
get design approval, and now you get to play games with additional
Adobe security requirements. I can install 7.0.9 from the medibuntu
repositories and it works without any fuss,* so I'm not going to spend
a lot of time on 8.1. 

* "Without any fuss" means "except that you can't find your printers
installed in CUPS because it requires a bunch of 32-bit CUPS libraries
that 64-bit Ubuntu does not install." I became a beta tester of the 8.1
release in the hope that I could assist Adobe in fixing this for the
8.1 release. As a result of that experience I can say that the entire
Adobe Reader/Linux development team knows exactly what libraries are
needed, but they evidently chose to ignore the issue and release 8.1 as
32-bit only, without even giving a how-to for 64-bit Ubuntu users on
their website. Bah.

Are you sure they are not being exploited?

Depends on what it is.  There are now databases of the most obscure 
exploits that can be automated for attack.  That vulnerability may not be 
a problem by itself, but it could become a problem when used in 
combination with something else.

There are additional things you can do beyond a firewall to protect your 
network.  Look into a package called "snort".

Really?  Do you have specific and significant examples that you could
warn us about?  Name 'n' shame is the security game.

And how do *you* deal with it?  Does it work for an admin who's
time-poor, needs to automate tasks and handles many hosts?

I admit I don't have a whole lot of years as a sysadmin, and I've only
had to manage a handful of critical infrastructure hosts at the same
time, with only a few other co-sysadmins, but I've certainly come to
appreciate distribution packages and updates, and careful
version-control of packages and config files.

Sorry, I couldn't be arsed to patch together a 4-line wrapped URL.  Were
those potential 'sploits or actual ones with usable exploit code?  I'll
admit that one's firewalls can stand to have lots of reboots, but
production hosts should be well protected and if so, can stand to have
nice long uptimes and lots of nines after their availability numbers.

Those nines look awfully nice when one is justifying one's job, salary
and/or budget to Those Who Sign The Checks.

   Not at all. The information sent with the upgrades almost always report
that there are no known exploitations of the identified vulnerability, but
that leaves the whole world of unknown exploitations. Or, in Rummy's words,
the "unknown unknowns."

Message-ID: <4da3d49b0710090949s47bc7378sdf49f61788483e6f@mail.gmail.com>

So let's review.
1. John has a a firefox-bin zombie whose existence, apparently, will not let
him start up a new
    instance of firefox.
2. Zombies can't be 'killed' because they are already dead.
3. There is no user path to removing zombies, short of rebooting.
4. Zombies exist because a parent process didn't 'reap' a child process's
exit status;
    the child process becomes the zombie.
5. All processes are decendents of the 'init' process (PID 1).
6. If there is no parent to 'reap' a child's exit status, the child/zombie
is inherited
    by the 'init' process.
7. Supposedly 'init' periodically 'reaps' exit status from all it's
children, allowing
    zombie processes to be deleted from the process table.
8. None of this helps John solve the original problem.

So where in this sequence does John's example go wrong?  There's bug
material here,
but I can't seem to find any reference to such at Malone.  On my x86 (not
64bit) laptop,
firefox-bin is already a direct child of 'init' (PID 1).  (I use the CLI
command 'ps axwwl',
parent process ID is the fourth column).

There is another,slightly longer, explanation of the zombie thing at
http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_Zombie_Process_and_Orphan_Process

There are a couple of things to try not mentioned yet. 'sudo kill -SIGCHLD
1' should send a signal to the 'init' process which it may (or may not)
handle as a request to reap dead children.  'sudo kill -HUP 1' should send a
signal to the 'init' process to re-read it's tty
config file (and maybe other stuff).  Since the whole 'init' thing is now
some kind of
adjunct to 'upstart', I'm not really sure how/whether any of this signal
behavior still
obtains. Caveat Emptor, YMMV, etc etc etc...

Depends on who is making the claim. CERT is usually pretty good about 
that.  Some vendors less so.

In the last few years when I built a box that was going to face the internet
I generally put each internet facing service in its own virtual machine.
The compartmentalization a VM offers made recovering a hacked server a hell
of a lot easier.  Also, since each VM only had one running service there
where only 2 real entry vectors, remote kernel exploits and the service the
VM was running (well, assuming the virtualization doesn't have some remote
exploits anyways).

I generally wouldn't run any network services on the physical machine which
left it accessible only via a remote access controller like a Dell Drac that
sat behind a VPN or physically going to the system.

I also found it a lot easier to upgrade applications because the VMs made it
easy to clone the existing machine and do the upgrade somewhere else.  Also
since the actual upgrade involved shutting down the old VM and bringing up
the upgraded one rolling back changes was fairly easy.

One other thing I experimented with was building VMs on mirrored disk luns
and having the physical machine split the mirror, fsck the filesystem and
run tripwire and chkrootkit on it.

Of course VMs aren't a replacement for good security practice, they are just
a useful tool.

  Hi all just thought I would check to see if anyone in the group has had extensive experience integrating FDS into their organization. 
  We would like to use FDS as a central authentication server for specific services here however we are lacking tremendously on the side of LDAP knowledge. We may at some point actually hire a contractor to come in and work/train us on this but right now we are still feeling it out a bit. Simply put we would like to have an LDAP repository that would combine our internal active directory and our older SunOne LDAP into one server. We will also want to hang things off of this server such as Radius etc. Some of the questions we have bubbling around in our heads are things like should we bother with setting up replicas or should we simply script ldiff exports and imports. Also has anyone here integrated FDS to AD and would you mind sharing your experiences/pitfalls with us? And if you all think that there is a better product for this please feel free to mention it. I have been pretty fond of FDS since I read Carla's article back in July 06 but if there is a better product for our needs then we would love to hear about it.

PS - If you have any contact information for contractors that you feel would be a good fit for this project we would really appreciate you passing that info along to us.

Thanks Everyone!!!

I just ssh -X into the other machine.

I have been thinking about normalizing the dotfiles across multiple 
machines, which probably has a lot of overlap with the nfs issue, 
except that it is a series of independent, maybe offline, and 
potentially conflicting changes.  I'm leaning toward something 
involving svn or svk (because one machine is a laptop) and per-machine 
settings can be pretty significant (because one machine has three 
monitors to which the kde desktop config is tuned, while the other is a 
laptop and the rest are servers.)  Maybe my answer ultimately involves 
cfengine (but that seems more tuned toward managing /etc than /home.)

Anyway, some thoughts:

caches and tempfiles:
  should be per-machine, but are often found in ~/ (bind mount or 
symlink to a local dir?)

bookmarks, configs, and etc:
  lock/overwrite issues, (vs merging?) -- without even getting into the 
issue of race conditions, depends on whether the app notices on-disk 
changes and/or overwrites with in-memory data

per-machine settings:
  most config files have some sort of include mechanism (e.g. .bashrc,
.vimrc), so it's mostly a matter of defining a per-machine config 
repository and putting a standard include statement in the shared files

The freedesktop.org seems to have put a lot of thought into this sort of 
thing, though they maybe haven't made great headway on the older apps.

Generally speaking, simultaneous text-based login (ssh, telnet, rsh,
console, etc) sessions to multiple hosts having a shared NFS home
directory works nicely.

On the other hand simultaneous GUI logins to multiple hosts with
shared NFS home is problematic. It gets especially ugly if you want
to run the same desktop (KDE, Gnome, whatever) simultaneously on all
hosts. And then there are the apps. Mozilla is by no means the only
one with issues in this regard. There are usually ways to deal with
all of this but it can be a pain.

What normally happens in environments like this is a user will
opt to login to just one host using a GUI session. From there
they will text login to the other hosts. This works well with
a common NFS home.

That would have the same "already open profile" problem for Mozilla.

In my case, I have few desktops (2) and several more headless boxes
that I want for the CPU.  I don't want to have to care which box I
have the shell on from a homedir (other dir too) pov.

Hmm. yeah, maybe there is some potential there.  I have not done
anything with fancy mounts.

Yeah, well in my case that sucks. ;) I've got two desktops and I want
to have browsers running on both of them, while sharing a homedir.  I
guess to refine my query, what's the nicest way to do that.  

The only other application I care about is Emacs, and the only problem
there might be Gnus (and actually, things are getting better in that
regard, with some recent development work), but I am willing to live
with that particular problem for now.

The browser problem is the one I am most interested in finding a good
solution to.

konqueror works fine though (not sure about nfs)

Maybe set an alias or script on the one box which launches the browser 
from the other.

Why do you need to share a home dir on the headless boxes?  Other 
than .bashrc, .emacsrc or whatever?  I've got the same situation, but 
anything needed on the headless boxes could be created roughly once 
(maybe sync'd daily, but they change maybe monthly at most.)

I've never owned a Mac, but I think one of the charms of MacOS is that 
you don't really need to dual-boot it or run a virtualized Linux on it 
-- it can build and run just about any open-source software you'd ever 
want to run. IMHO there is no reason to pay the MacOS and Macintosh 
hardware premium and then waste disk space or processor cycles on Linux. :)

But if she really wants to "explore Linux", I'd think a virtualizer 
would be the way to go rather than a live CD.

I own a few Macs and I agree. When I use the Mac I don't want
the Linux-like experiences that are discussed here regularly,
like CUPS printing issues, USB issues, proprietary driver issues,
etc. - especially when most open source applications are available
for OS X. I want it to just work - and it does.

None of this means that I dislike Linux. I dislike the monopoly,
the patent issues, the lawsuits, and the marketplace enthusiasm
for crappy products that brought us to this point.

So, hokay. A bit about frsirt, and my experience in the field....

I had this hardcore gig for about a year, where I was part of a 24/7  
team that did nothing but monitor the existing known set of exploits,  
write patten matching code (think of something like snort on  
steroids, with end-user clients that could nuke other people (not a  
rhetorical device)), and build detection rules for the exploits. One  
of our best research tools was frsirt, because quite a few (half to  
80%) of their warnings, for a long time, came with PoC (Proof of  
Concept) code to run, which made our lives easier.

Frsirt had to *stop* releasing the PoC examples, because well,  
somewhere along the line, quite a few people decided it was dangerous  
for software exploits to be "known".

Read that last sentence again.

Then ask yourself about what it means when a vendor is saying their  
are no "known" (aka published) exploits.

With that being said, I can say that there is a daily firehose of new  
alerts, and CERT/CVE is waaay behind the ball on this one. Check out:
<http://www.frsirt.com/english/>
..and when you look at the current list, think to yourself that at  
*least* half of those have known (but now not widely published)  
exploits... and the remainder, well, our team usually could build an  
exploit (and a test for an attack, which was the product being sold)  
for 20-30% of them within hours, another 10% within days.

Anecdotally, I'd say up to 90% of publicly released vulns *do* have  
exploits.... just not published ones. I know, because I spent a lot  
of time writing the exploits, testing them, and detecting their  
variations, while writing both exploit and detection code.

Ah, the "infrequent" problem (a *very real* issue when talking to  
managers about budget and man hours). If something only can happen  
one out of 30,000 times, it must not be an issue, right?

Nobody reliably publishes their exploit data, or for that matter  
"successfully unknown" exploit data. It's just not in their interests  
to do so.

Define "low". ;)

I first saw this email hours ago, so I tried to count the driver  
errors on my commute home. I saw 37 in my hour-long commute, which is  
about half the attacks I see per hour on each of my servers.

I used to think that before I owned a mac.  The reality is, if you want 
to run BSD on a case-insensitive filesystem using a broken terminal to 
operate a command-line which can barely communicate with the gui on a 
hood-welded-half-shut system with a nearly empty /etc, they're great.

Shiny, but tedious.

CentOS 5, RHEL5 (etc.):
#php -v

If you're not at 5.2.4 (or a patched equivalent), you're running bad  
code, with literally *thousands* of security and stability patches  
omitted.

I walked into a nightmare on my current job, 4 distros, no standard  
configure strings, no standard libraries, no documentation.
Here's what I'm rolling out (over time, big companies move slow):
One distro.
One .configure for the binaries.
.configure files based on the machine's "role" (mysql server, php  
server, etc.)
..and so on.

It's not the binaries, it's the controlled *process* that matters.

I'm no PHP insider, but I believe it.  Fixing 1000 bugs is not
uncommon in a release cycle of a large piece of software, and neither
is introducing 1000 more.

My favorite is Bug Fixing Day, where every developer concentrates on
closing bug slips as fast as possible in order to win some silly
prize.  Naturally the fixes don't get the kind of attention they
really need when everyone is in a hurry, so new bugs are easily
introduced.  But the project manager feels great because the numbers
look so good.

Well, I don't know how many bugs the PHP people added but we can hope 
it's not 100x the number of named features added.  And the number of 
bugs fixed appears to be somewhat less than than 1000:

MacBooks are Intel-based.  You should be able to use a standard x86 or
AMD64 liveCD, though I'm not sure how to convince it to boot from CD.
Hm, Google "macbook livecd" sez to hold down the C key during bootup.

Actually, if you `ssh -X $hostname -f firefox` firefox will actually
realize that you have a local copy already running, and just start a new
window. It's fancy that way.. though, that's not what you want.

I don't think there is a solution, aside from creating multiple profiles
in FF. You could use google sync to sync the two profiles.. :)

There have been a couple of audit projects.  Coverity has been doing code 
analysis on a number of projects, including PHP.  I can see that many 
problems being fixed.  About time too.

While some people have said "the Mac is better" or "install a
virtualizer", this is not about /replacing/ but /exploring/.  The 
best thing about live CDs is that you can see your machine temporarily
(and reversibly) change personalities, and that is cool even if the
new personality is inferior to the existing one.  Most people react
to Knoppix/Ubuntu/Fedora live CDs with "Wow!  My machine can do that!?"
It is a powerful argument for open platforms, and against the 
monopoly-vendor "our way or else" nonsense.

Even though Ubuntu is not providing Mac live CDs anymore (sigh),  the
older Dapper CDs should work OK.  Provide her with that, and you can
lead her through this introduction to Linux.  If there are hardware
problems (and newer hardware running older live CDs may exhibit this),
then try the Fedora Live CD, or others.  Since you (John) know Ubuntu
better than Fedora, you are a better guide for Ubuntu.

However ... if it is a new X86 Macbook, it may not run an old PowerPC
Ubuntu disk.  Although regular X86 Ubuntu/Fedora/whatever might run
on an X86 Mac when it is installed, I suspect the boot loader on a 
Mac may not know how to handle a "foreign" CD.  You will have to 
investigate that.

Par for the course, innit?  "Well, the backup app that management forced

Correct.  Security is a process.  Reliability is a process.  Keeping
your clients happy is a process.  Systems administration is the process
of balancing all of that against human and technical limitations.

I have found that the various distros patch different things.  (I did an 
audit of such things for DARPA a few years back.)

Red Hat may not use the new version of a package, but they are pretty good 
about backporting patches.  (A thankless and painful task, having done 
it.)

Debian is pretty good. They tend to cover a few patches that other miss, 
but not some that Red Hat uses.

In fact, the security response time is pretty good.  Depends on the 
vulnerability and how much the exploit is seen in the wild.  It also 
depends on when they figure that the admins will be in the office and able 
to apply the patched version(s).

Intel-based, yes. BIOS-based, no.

MacBooks all use Intel's EFI rather than a legacy BIOS. I don't know 
all the issues surrounding EFI, but I know that some versions don't 
provide backward compatibility with BIOS-based bootloaders.

Supposedly, newer EFI releases are able to use BIOS bootloaders -- 
grub, lilo, the Windows bootloader -- but you'll probably want to do 
some testing. elilo (http://elilo.sourceforge.net/) is specifically 
built for EFI boots, but I doubt most Live CDs use it.

There should be no 'if' in that statement.  AFAIK, they changed names 
from 'i-book'/'powerbook' to 'macbook'/'macbook pro' when the x86 cpu's 
arrived.

PDXLUG is the informal GNU/Linux user group.  It's like the PLUG after
meeting without the presentations first.  Come drink socialize.  Talk
about whatever you want.

This will be the first meeting at The Lucky Lab.  The location is
moving largely because of overcrowding at The Fireside Lounge, and the
lack of good food, or any beer whatsoever.  I want to go to sleep
after the meeting not stay up all night so a coffee place isn't the

Thanks to all who replied, including those who pointed out that she has
to hold down C while booting (which I would never have thought of). I
have an old Dapper Mac CD, but I suspect it won't work because her
computer is (as has been pointed out) an Intel-based Mac. I will also
have a Feisty i386 and a Fedora 7 i386 CD with me, and I even have a
Feisty 64 bit and an old Knoppix 5.0 that I keep in my locker at
school. She'll have the MacBook with her so after class tomorrow we'll
spend a little time fiddling with things. Meantime I already got her
started on FOSS by having her install OOo and the Junicode font that I
use for linguistics. She just got this MacBook and it's her first
experience on a Mac. She is fumbling around trying to figure things out
- she couldn't even figure out how to install the font at first. Her only
previous experience was with that other OS, so when she sees Linux it
won't seem any stranger to her than the MacOS. 

Whether she decides to dual boot, stick with MacOS or go completely to
Linux is her decision. For now the whole purpose is for her to explore.

   My first, and only, Mac experience was in 1987. I asked the graphic
designer at the company where we worked if I could try out his Mac since I'd
never used one. Locked it up so tight that he had to pull the power plug to
reboot. When he asked how I managed to do this within 2 minutes, I told him
that I had no idea, I was clicking on icons trying to figure out what they
did since there was no text, and ... oops! There it went. So much for
"intuitive" UIs.

In case anyone is interested in Adobe Reader 8.1 on 64-bit Linux, I
finally succeeded. I documented the procedure on the Ubuntu amd64
forum, but the methods may be necessary on other 64-bit distros as well.

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=571506

I wish there was an open source solution that could use the new Adobe
PDF print engine that many new high end lasers are coming out with,
that could do editable PDFs, and that didn't use Ghostscript for
rendering (slow, unreliable). Meantime at least Adobe has made a Linux
version, even though they made no effort to try to get it to work on
64-bit distros.

There are very few intuitive UIs in the world. Spears and swords are 
very intuitive. Door knobs are usually pretty good. Among more complex 
machines, I suspect single-speed bicycles are pretty intuitive (even 
if the skills needed for riding one aren't), at least when it comes to 
going; stopping is another matter entirely. :-)

But computers? Bwaaahaaaahaaaa!

Given the reliance of current computing UIs on advanced language 
skills and complex metaphors, none will ever even approach intuitive. 
I suspect developers would be better off aiming for more attainable 
targets: "consistent," "attractive," "unambiguous," "efficient," 
"flexible," and perhaps even "easy to learn for fundamental tasks."

Don't forget the fact that we're hobbling along with basically one 
pointer and one button.

Yes, the pointer has ~3 buttons and the keyboard has 105 keys, but 
that's really just two inputs (the mouse is roughly 2D analog and the 
keyboard is basically 1D with 105 discrete values.)  You can't 
(typically) send different keys as simultaneous input to different 
programs and there's only one pointer.  In other words, the opposable 
thumb is not needed (and thus offers no advantage.)

Yes, we're designing for monkeys and expecting them to apply advanced 
language skills to complex metaphors.

Ubuntu may not be providing them, but you can download CDs of Ubuntu 
Feisty 7.04 for the older Macs (PPC variety):

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=427714

In fact, I installed Feisty on a PBG4 laptop a few weeks ago.  With the 
exception of wifi, it works great.  Note that the download page also has 
images for SPARCS, Itaniums, and PlayStation3s.

I'm not sure about the newer x86 Macs.  I believe they can run the 
standard x86 Ubuntu.  My recommendation is to download the iso, burn a 
CD, plop it in a Mac, and boot while holding the C key.

Let us know how it goes.

Regards,
- Robert

One quick-and-dirty metric (hey, how many lines would a unified patch  
be?):
Ronald-Chmaras-Computer:~/Desktop rchmara$ diff -u -r php-5.2.3  
php-5.2.4  | wc -l
   145730

Only ~145 thousand lines of code (and context) to peruse, in case you  
want to manually backport it.

The php codebase changes *fast*. A hundred or so regular developers  
here, a thousand contributors there (PHP has 1221 currently active  
project members), and pretty soon, you're talking about some fairly  
frequent code changes. (There's a reason the whole thing is checked  
out, rebuilt, and re-tested every 2 hours, 24 hours a day...) Often,  
fixing one bug will uncover a few more, or *create* a few more, and  
thus, a simple one-line patch can balloon into a series of 20-30 new  
patches, or a major refactoring project.

So, every so often, somebody will suggest wrapping the latest batch  
of documented bug fixes, or publicly incrementing to highlight a  
critical fix/change/security issue/whatever, and a "Release  
Candidate" is born, and if it's tested clean, will go live.

The most minor version number used by PHP, IOW, can be for a few  
lines of fixing (as has happened)..... or for a 50K LOC change.

So yes, thousands of patches in some cases, 1 patch in other cases.

Do you mean something like the following fictitious situation: I develop 
version 1.0 of a program, and it has (say) 5 known bugs and 10 features. 
  I keep developing and release version 1.1 of the same program which 
fixes the 5 v1.0 bugs and add 3 more features but while developing I 
make 100 mistakes -- which I fix -- along the way before releasing 
v1.1.. it sounds to me like you would consider v1.1 of the program to 
have 105 fewer bugs then v1.0.  Did I parse your email correctly?

I beg to differ (all other issues aside):
EDGY(6.10):   http://releases.ubuntu.com/edgy/
FEISTY(7.04): http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/releases/7.04/release/
GUTSY(7.10beta): http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/daily-live/
  (problematical at the moment, a result of being moved from 'releases' to
'ports')

It is more accurate to say that Ubuntu is not providing Mac live CDs as part
of its
formal release process.

Much of that is pulled from bugs.php.net, which is the normal, public  
facing, bugs server, as well as rough developer logs and CVS  
checkins, and kind of glosses over, uhm, a few things. ;)

So, the PHP development model is kind of a blend between wikipedia,  
and linus' kernel. It's like linus' kernel in that there are *core*  
pieces that very few developers get to patch and modify. It's like  
wikipedia in that there are whole chunks of php's CVS where user abcd  
checks in an updated version, user bcde checks in an update to the  
update, user cdef checks in a revised update, etc., over a matter of  
hours or days.

So, what is publicly listed as something simple like, oh, "Fixed  
array handling bug" can actually be anywhere between 1 and /n/  
patches to the existing codebase.

While it might be more informative to list *every* change to the  
whole of the php codebase, that can be up to 100 different changes.  
Per day. Listing 3,100 patches/reverts/changes each month is not very  
useful to a web developer who just wants to get a current, stable,  
version of PHP for their blog.

CentOS+the occasional exception. Most of the staff were familiar with  
RHEL, Fedora, etc., so it was a matter of choosing from that general  
family. We have exceptions for SVN (debian), a FreeBSD security/ 
utility box, and an Ubuntu desktop for one guy who just adores it,  
but those are VM images, and not publicly accessible.

When I can get a package manager with 24 hour turnaround on zero-day  
releases, snapshots, and bugfixes, I'm more than happy to use such a  
thing. Until then, yes, configure stings and compiles... (though I  
didn't mention the x86/64 bit (and other optimizations) compile  
variations issue.)

Pretty close, but not the whole picture. Let me tell you about snaps,  
and the php bug life cycle. (Others reading this can point and laugh.)

snaps.php.net is where live "code updates" happen. So, say we've  
released 9.0.

Lets say that on monday, a bug report (by somebody named Tom) is  
filed that calling the internal function foo_bar(1.9127) segfaults.

A developer  comes along, sees that foo_bar() handles floats poorly,  
and changes the code for foo_bar() to handle it. The end user  
downloads this "current version" of 9.0 from snaps, and is happy.

On tuesday, *another* bug report is filed (by somebody named Harry),  
because foo_baz(1.681) segfaults (not foo_bar()).

Another developer  comes along, sees that all of the foo_*() library  
handles floats poorly, and changes massive amounts of code for foo_* 
() to handle it. Harry downloads this *newer* "current version" of  
9.0 from snaps, and is happy.

So: User Tom has one "fixed" version of 9.0 code. User Harry has  
another "fixed" version of 9.0 code.

On wednesday, version 9.1 (with all current fixes) is released. User  
Tom sees massive changes, User Harry sees no changes.

On thursday a developer adds a new bar_*() extension to the 9.1  
development tree.

User Dick needs this extension, badly, and over the course of a few  
weeks, downloads snaps, works with the developer, filing bug reports  
every few days, grabbing snaps, and in the course of things,  100  
changes are made.

9.2 is released. And Tom doesn't care about them. Neither does  
Harry.... but Dick sees 100 changes, over time, that matter to *him*  
between 9.1 and 9.2. The release notes merely say "added bar  
functions", and 100 changes show up in the code base.

Hmm.  I guess I still don't "get" or "believe" your math then.. it 
sounds like a way to inflate the number of bugs in software to scare the 
bejesus out of people.. I'm not sure why, particularly when 99.999% of 
the users of mature software don't download every snapshot the 
developers pinch off.

Over in Personal Telco land, we were doing some node maintenance
today.  The node is an apartment building in which we had deployed 5
devices that meshed together using WDS.  A while back we had noticed
that something oily was dripping from several of them and we didn't
(and don't) know what it was.  Today we were there and cracked one
open and found this:

  <http://www.personaltelco.net/gallery/v/nodes/nodeloc/westovertowers/DSC03137.JPG.html>

The goo was melted like that in three of the five devices and in the
other two, remained in a crisply-cornered block above the radio card.

Two questions: 

  a) what is that stuff?  (we thought maybe the remnants of the
     stay-puft marshmallow man, but that was just a guess);

and 

  b) what solvent would be appropriate for washing it off the circuit
     board?

Thanks!

All,

I've got a box setup for my mother who is 300 miles away from me. I've 
got logsentry emailing me unusual system activity once an hour and I can 
ssh into the box from where I am.

Here's the problem:

I started noticing a couple days ago kernel boot messages in some of the 
hourly reports. I thought it was a bit odd but not too serious. This 
morning I see that every hour for the past 24 hours her system has 
rebooted itself. There are no obvious messages pertaining to the reboot 
in the log; presumably something catastrophic happens and the disk isn't 
sync'd before the reboot.

The only pattern I've noticed thus far, by looking at the timing of the 
kernel boot messages, is that it's slowly getting later in the hour. For 
example:

00:32:28
01:32:48
02:33:05
03:33:26
04:33:44
05:34:03
06:34:24
07:34:41
08:35:05
09:35:20
10:35:41

and so on. Any ideas what might be causing this? I spoke to her and she has noticed some unusual fan activity, but I'm not sure how that could explain the reboots.

TIA,
Aaron

Two things come to mind, is power management enabled in the bios or is 
there something wrong with the hardware causing a watchdog reset?  The 
former I have seen cause a periodic system lockup, but bios power 
management events combined with ACPI configuration of the system could 
cause an unexplained periodic reboot.

Actually, that may not need a smiley. I live in a condo, and around my
front door, there is a nearly-continuous strip of tape that (I'm told)
will expand to seal the door at a certain temperature. 

It would be interesting to monitor the temperature in that box after you
clean it up. 

Consider visiting your local fire station. They may not know how to get
it off, but they'll probably know someone who does post-fire cleanup.

Good luck!

If it is a fire suppression material, you probably do not want to install them 
without it--a catastrophe might follow.

Check the hourly cron jobs.  Could be something silly like "makewhatis" or 
it could be something else worth worrying about.

Should be in /etc/cron.hourly.

Not yet.  But that's probably the optimal idea.  I had just never seen
anything like it before, and wondered what planet I'd been living on

Charlie Stross, author of fine open-source related science fiction,
will be signing books tonight 7PM at Powells main store.  There may
or may not be an afters - Stross has a 5am flight to SF tomorrow.

I am currently finishing his latest novel, "Halting State".  The
story involves a bank robbery in an online role-playing game.  One
of the protagonists is a Python-using game hacker.  No code samples
so far, sigh.  "grep" and "ping" figure prominently.  Minor characters
wearing tshirts saying "traceroute is my bitch".  A little dense with
Scottish slang and jargon (Google is both referred to in the book,
and useful for decyphering it), but twisty and fun.

It is hard to tell from the pictures, but it looks like spray foam,
put in there to keep the PCMCIA card anchored.   It is probably a poor
thermal conductor, allowing stuff to heat up too much, melting it.
If you knew what the material was, you could google for the solvent,
otherwise you would risk hurting the electronic components.  You
might consider just heating it in a non-food oven to 250F or so,
inverted above an expendable catch pan, and letting the stuff melt off.

My guess is that a better material was specified in the design, and
the Chinese manufacturing shop substituted some cheap, low melting
point, low thermal conductivity crap.  Perhaps the same crap they
use in pet food and children's toys.

Another endorsement; I read a book of his short stories this summer and
was quite pleasantly surprised at his technical chops. The stories were
great as well.

I've not heard of firestop used in single family residential
construction, but it is used all the time in commercial/industrial
construction. Here's a page with several examples of intumescent
sealants -- sealants that expand when they get hot:

http://www.us.hilti.com/holus/modules/prcat/prca_navigation.jsp?OID=-18981&ref=google_firestop

Here's another page with the "picture is worth a thousand words"

Yeah, I bet firestop material is not supposed to turn gooey.  The

Thanks for the suggestion. I've disabled cron, we'll see if it still 
restarts. The only things cron should be running, aside from emailing 
hourly reports, is a daily rdiff-backup run that happens at 2PM.

This is a relatively new intel board, there's no bios-controlled power 
management. ACPI is enabled in the kernel but no configuration changes 
have happened since when it was fine to when it started rebooting hourly.

How would I go about detecting hardware watchdog(s) and their 
configuration(s)?

Subject: [PLUG] RESOLVED: Debian Xen + Broadcom NetXtreme II (IBM x3655
	7985-AC1)
Message-ID: <47082F9B.3000300@opensourcery.com>

I have a new x3655 IBM and whenever the /etc/xen/scripts/network-bridge
script starts, the ethernet would no longer work.  This post isn't about
the cause, but the fix.  I did a lot of tcpdumps and Googling, but I'll
spare you that.  All they do is prove that yes, there is an issue. :)

I tried Debian 4.0 i386/amd64 and Ubuntu 7.04 Server i386/amd64 and they
all exhibit the problem.

Upgrading the bnx2 driver is the key.  I came to find bnx2 is included
in the initrd.  Debian comes with 1.4.44 and Ubuntu 1.4.45 of the
driver.  As of this writing 1.5.10c is the latest from Broadcom and is
what I ended up using.

Summary:
 * Install kernel source, make config/prepare the distro's config file
 * Download bnx2 source, compile and install
 * Update initrd

Here are step by step instructions for clean install of Debian 4.0 amd64:

aptitude install linux-source unzip
cd /usr/src
tar jxf linux-source-2.6.18.tar.bz2
ln -s linux-source-2.6.18 linux
cd linux
cp /boot/config-2.6.18-5-xen-amd64 ./.config
make oldconfig (<enter> through all the prompts to take defaults)
make prepare
cd /tmp
wget http://www.broadcom.com/docs/driver_download/NXII/linux-1.5.10c.zip
unzip linux-1.5.10c.zip
cp Server/Linux/Driver/bnx2-1.5.10c.tar.gz /usr/src
cd /usr/src
tar zxf bnx2-1.5.10c.tar.gz
cd bnx2-1.5.10c/src
make
make install
mv /boot/initrd.img-2.6.18-5-xen-amd64 \
/boot/initrd.img-2.6.18-5-xen-amd64.orig
update-initramfs -k `uname -r` -c
reboot

Verify:
zcat /boot/initrd.img-2.6.18-5-xen-amd64.orig|strings|grep "bnx2 v"
Broadcom NetXtreme II Gigabit Ethernet Driver bnx2 v1.4.44 (August 10, 2006)

zcat /boot/initrd.img-2.6.18-5-xen-amd64|strings|grep "bnx2 v"

If you have another system (even a Windows system with some additional
software), you could set up remote syslog so you could see what is being
logged (and possibly lost). Also, you should check your BIOS for the
event log; that might tell you something. And make sure your hardware
environmental monitors aren't set too low.

These times seem to eliminate cron. It is good at executing at a
certain time. These are all about 1:00:21 from the previous time.
Looks like "at" or some other scheduler.  How are you getting the
email updates. Is this scheduled, or based on what happens in the
logs?

If we keep following this train of thought. You get emailed unusual
log entries every hour. Let's say that whatever process you use to
generate this warning email also triggers a reboot.  Then you would
get a reboot an hour after there was an unusual event like a reboot.
Could this be what is happening? Can you stop the email warnings and
see if the reboots stop.

The emails are sent by logsentry, which is started by cron.hourly. I 
disabled cron, ntpd, even X ... nothing was running but sshd and a few 
login processes. The system still rebooted dutifully 1:00:20 after the 
previous time.

Wil suggested setting up network logging. I'll look into that. I have no 
experience with it though.

Thanks for your input!

I was going to suggest an nfs mount for /var/log, but then I noticed the 
300mi issue ;-)  Perhaps a usb drive mounted with the 'sync' option?  
Failing that, maybe tail -f over ssh will tell you something.

Didn't terminals used to output to paper?

I'll simplify, without explaining the "why", then:
Over 100K lines of diff between two "minor" revisions (5.2.3 and  
5.2.4) is not (in my mind)  "a few patches", or even a few hundred  
patches. It is thousands. Keep in mind that PHP is up to 65Mb for an  
uncompressed *source* download (of mostly C code, can't totally blame  
OO bloat) for an idea of the sheer scale involved.

Oh, no fear. Just try to stay current. Please.
  <http://www.php.net/manual/en/security.current.php>

If you have backups and don't *mind* being compromised, because you  
have *very good reasons* to run known insecure software, it's all good!

Now, as far as issues listed as "bugs" that were publicly reported  
and closed, the (reported under) 5.2 tree has 562 closed issues, the  
larger 5.x tree has 3,145 closed issues, and 319 open issues (that  
doesn't count bugs open since the 4.x tree).

I'd guess where our thinking, and our perceptions, aren't lining up  
is in the difference between calling something a "bug" and calling  
something, oh, an update, a feature improvement, a stability  
improvement, a "typo patch", a "new unit test feature", or any number  
of other clever euphemisms for saying "this code was broken/wrong in  
some way and had to be altered".

To further reduce the issue, best as I can tell, you are looking at  
dumbed-down changelogs, I am looking at actual code changes, and the  
two simply don't line up. They're not even in the same ballpark.

Yes, but hopefully (not!) 99.99% of the admins and users download the  
latest security-patched version, to avoid being exploited with  
*publicly* known security holes.

*sigh*

Is the system set up to automatically reboot on a kernel panic?  Check
/proc/sys/kernel/panic and/or look for panic=<some number> on the
kernel command line in the bootloader.

What hardware do you have?  You mention newer Intel board, what
specifically?  Have you checked for a BIOS update?

What other hardware is in the system?  lspci?

Lots of questions, just trying to narrow down :-)

In addition to the specific hardware, what OS, assuming Linux what dist 
are you running?  That will help with what config files to modify for 
remote syslog.

I am arriving mid-to-late afternoon Friday (19 Oct) for the PostgreSQL 
Conference and will be staying at the Portland Inn City Center.

It's been years since I was in Portland but remember there were great 
places to eat and drink.  Any suggestions?

Also I'd enjoy meeting and putting a face with the name of anyone 
interested.

What kind or price range and what kind of food?

Trying to remember where the Portland Inn City Center even is...

Paddy's has free wireless, as does Jax (about a block away).  Paddy's also 
has "The Wall of Alcohol".  Both have good food.  (Jax is a bit more into 
spicy food.)  Paddy's is also next to a Max stop.

Thanks Mark.  I've seen almost no traffic on the attendees list so I 
didn't think of it.  Besides I've been on the PLUG list several years 
and didn't want to miss any of that crew.  :-)

The only hardware I would suspect in the system is the LSI Logic PCI 
SCSI controller. It's ancient - but there to run an ancient HP scanner.

I haven't checked for a BIOS update. I'll do that tonight. It's worth 
noting though, that no configuration changes have occurred prior to the 
reboot-syndrome.

I've got Gentoo on there, with Linux 2.6.20. Also the e1000 driver from 
e1000.sf.net version 7.6.5.

There is another system at her house running Gentoo doing routing and 
web proxy which I can send system logs to. I'm sure I can get that setup 
myself, I know about the kernel options for it. I just need to research 
syslog servers and select one to setup.

Thanks,
Aaron

It still looks like it is triggered by some timed event. Many hardware

No oysters, sardines, or rocky mountain oysters and I don't much care 
for liver.  Otherwise if it doesn't move for a few seconds and doesn't 
eat me I'll try it.
    But on the more serious side Mexican or pasta based is great.

The PostgreSQL attendees and speakers are planning a Friday get together

I got one of these last month. I managed to get CentOS 4.5 installed. It's
working well so far. CentOS 5 is not an option because it requires an i686
or equivalent. The CPU in the fit-PC is an i586 clone. This is something to
keep in mind if you are thinking of installing a pre-compiled distribution.
I guess that's why they picked Gentoo.

The intent is for this to become my 24x7 "home management" server, with
X-10 controls, weather station monitoring, etc. Then I don't have to leave
my power-hungry desktop PC turned on all the time. Plus with the desktop PC
relieved of 24x7 duties I'll be able to get back to more expirementation
with various distros.

PLUG Advanced Topics Meeting

October 15th, 2007  7pm

Jax Bar
826 SW 2nd Avenue
Portland, Oregon

Speaker: Mark Gross
           Intel

Title:  "Power Management Quality of Service (PM_QOS)"

Power Management Quality of Service is a new-ish idea pushed by Mark 
at the Linux PM summit in June 2007.  It is based on the notion that 
if drivers knew performance constraints as defined by other subsystems 
and applications, then they would have all the information they need 
to do automatic, and nearly optimal, power management.

This talk describes the idea in terms of a generalization of an 
existing kernel mechanism, its design, implementation, and talks about 
where the technique is expected to work and not work.  The current 
patch has just been posted and is getting some time in the MM tree 
now.  We are hoping to get it into the 2.6.25 kernel, along with more 
PM_QOS applications.


Mark Gross is an Engineer in the Open Source Technology center at 
Intel Corporation. He primarily works on telecommunication computing 
platform Linux OS support for Intel, along with some additional 
activities. Mark is also the chair of the power management working 
group for the Consumer Electronics Linux forum. Mark is a robotics 
hobbyist and participates in PARTS http://portlandrobotics.org and the 
occasional Dorkbot http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotpdx/ get together.


Standard meeting rules apply.

The thing has a harddrive.  Either there have been some technical
advances I missed or the website is lying when it says "absolutely
silent".  I'd personally rather have a CF card slot for a firewall,
but this is the first tiny PC I've seen where you don't have to install
a drive yourself -- meaning they find the 1" IDE cable. :-)

It uses a conventional laptop hard drive. If I put my ear right
next to it I can hear the clicking of disk activity. But at a
more typical distance between ear and PC I can't hear a thing.

$285US for a mini-PC? That seems a bit expensive when you can get a Mac 
Mini for $600US and a stripped 64-bit dual-core laptop for $500US, both 
including a monitor, a non-free OS and some applications. :) The only 
thing this has going for it is the low power consumption. I guess I 
should see how much of Gentoo I can get on an 8 GB flash drive. :)

Actually, the Gentoo LiveDVD runs about 3.7 GB using a compressed 
filesystem, so you'd have about 4 GB left over for data. You'd have to 
be *very* careful about cleaning out your source packages after an 
update, though. :)

Speaking of stripped laptops, I'm thinking about getting one and running 
(gasp) Gentoo Linux on it. Are there any I should avoid for reasons of 
hardware/driver gotchas? My only hard requirement is a dual-core AMD 64, 
although I'd like something that can go up to 4 GB of RAM and I'd prefer 
a 14.1 screen to a 15.4 screen. So far, I've seen ones I like from 
Toshiba, Acer, HP (pavilion), HP/Compaq Presario and Gateway. I'm 
leaning towards the Acer because it has a 3-button mouse. And I'm 
leaning against the Gateway given that Acer bought them out.

The plan is actually to nuke the thing down to bare metal, install 
Gentoo Linux and VMWare Workstation 6 for Linux, then move my Windows XP 
Professional License from its current home on a dual-booted laptop to a 
guest VM on the new laptop. Then the old laptop will get nuked and 
rebuilt with Linux.

Ubuntu 7.04 works great on my lappie's 4GB HDD.  Given that I just saw a
4GB USB flashdrive for $20 (after rebate) at Fry's, I'm thinking that my
next lapdog will have no moving parts.  (Maybe LED backlight, too.)

Message-ID: <498756ed0710132340v6f8b631es9055c8ef6aca1d4d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I installed Debian on my machine.  I have an IP address through
comcast through DHCP.  I am making use of dyndns.org.  I have a VPS
through slicehost.  I am trying to understand DNS and I think I
understand it, but I want to have my understanding verified with a few
possibly naive questions.

In order to set up a primary name server and secondary name server I
have to have a static IP address, i.e.  I can't set up the
aforementioned name servers because dyndns.org takes care of finding
my host computer.  Or is it the case that dyndns.org "finds" my host,
and my host can be a primary name server.  Am I understanding this
correctly?  And am I saying it appropriately?

Also, through my VPS, it's pointless to have a dns server, because my
VPS is a single server, not a network of computers.  Is this correct?

Essentially, the only reason I would set up a primary name server and
secondary name server is if I had a static IP address at my home, and
under that IP address, ( a submask, I think )  I had a network of
computers that I wanted to be accessible by the outside Internet.  Is
this correct?

Anyways, I've gone from almost complete ignorance to a hazy
understanding of the ramifications of a static IP address viz a viz
DNS, and I hope I articulated my questions appropriately.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

The answer to your question is hidden in this set of riddles.

What does a nameserver do?  When do you need one? Does dyndns.org
qualify as a nameserver?

What is a static IP?  If I gave you two IP addresses and one was
static and the other dynamic could you tell me which one was which?
If not then what does it matter, and more importantly when does it
matter?

Bill

A nameserver tells a client what name and domaian of a host is
associated with what IP address.


When do you need one?

You need one when you want a host to be available to the internet clients.


Does dyndns.org
> qualify as a nameserver?

I suppose it does.  It tells a client what host is associated with
which dynamic ip address.

>

It is an IP address that doesn't change.


 If I gave you two IP addresses and one was
> static and the other dynamic could you tell me which one was which?

No, I don't think I could.

As far as what does it matter goes, I guess it doesn't matter.  I
guess I can set up a DNS primary nameserver using my dynamically
allocated IP address from comcast.  But what about my secondary
nameserver.  It seems that one is suppose to set up a seconary
nameserver if your primary one goes done, but then how does dyndns
find the secondary if the primary goes done, and the primary name
server host is associated with my dynamically allocated IP address.


As far as when does it matter goes, I guess it matters when comcast
changes my IP address, which I hear is rare, but it does happen, but
then I think my dyndns configuration file is suppose to update
dyndns.org.  ( I'll be asking questions about the dyndns configuration
file too, when I figure out how to articulate those questions.  )


Did I answer your riddles correctly?  I'm not being flippant, and I'm
not quite sure if my answers were right.  I'm being earnest and hope
for more feedback.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

This is reversed. You send a nameserver a name and it returns an IP address.

Not exactly. If the internet client knows the ip address of the host,
it  does not need a nameserver.  You need the nameserver if the client
only knows the host's name. The client needs the ip address in order
to be able to contact the host, so the client gives the host name to
the nameserver and gets back the ip address it needs.

dyndns.org does have nameservers.  Nameservers take host names and

Primary nameservers and secondary nameservers are both nameservers.
They provide redundancy. If one is busy or not working the other one
does the job.
Both nameservers have to be updated with the dynamic ip address.

 There is a hierarchy of nameservers that starts out at the top with
the root nameservers.  If the name/ip address is not cached locally
the query  goes to the root nameserver.   (See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_nameserver for a more complete
explanation.)

Victor's not wrong. A DNS nameserver can resolve an IP address
to a name as well as the reverse. It's just that resolving a
name to an IP address is more common.

Note that DNS is not just about host names an IP addresses. DNS
can be used to lookup other items of information associated with
a name, such as geographic coordinates, certificates, public
keys and key fingerprints, names of administrators, email
authentication, and general and special purpose text,

In order to add a host computer (one that provides services, e.g. 
webserver) to the Internet, you need three things:

1) a domain name
2) an IP address
3) a domain name server (DNS)

Think of the name server like a telephone book: given a name, it finds 
the address.  You get to pick and register the domain name via a Domain 
Name Registrar.  DynDNS has some freebie names or you can pick a custom 
name for a price.  Your IP address is usually assigned to you by your 
ISP or hosting company, and can be static or dynamic (changes every so 
often, usually weeks).  You get to pick the name servers, although it is 
now common for the company that registers your name to offer DNS 
service, too.  DynDNS has its own name servers, but you can use others 
like EveryDNS.

In your case:

1) What name did you register and with whom?  DynDNS?
2) Comcast provides you with an IP address via DHCP.
3) Who is your DNS provider?  DynDNS?

How does Slicehost fit into this?  Seems like they provide static IP 
addresses to their VMs and provide DNS service, although you still have 
to register your own name.  How many machines are you trying to connect 
to the Internet?

You can't try and find a consistent price/performance/features/etc power 
curve to everything.  I believe you might be able to apply an often used 
term here (slightly modified):

   small, powerful, cheap and feature rich.  Pick two.

If you look at other devices in the same class as this one, then compare 
price.  The Mac and laptop doesn't have dual NIC ports, and the mini 
uses a lot more than ~5 watts.  The laptop is probably pretty good on 
power consumption, and is a lot bigger and more expensive.  What's the 
comparison again?

Reverse DNS, i.e. resolving an ip address to a name is as far as I
understand a slightly different process than regular Forward DNS. It
is indeed handled by nameservers, but  via a different route. If the
ip address is a.b.c.d. It looks up a PTR record in the domain name
d.c.b.a.in-addr.arpa.  The control of these different routes is in
different hands.

 When I register a domain, I have control over which IP address  that
domain name points to. I tell the domain name registrar the
nameservers I will be using for that domain and I tell the nameservers
which IP address I will be using for that domain by creating an A
record.

I do not have the same control over the reverse DNS. That control is
in the hands of the ISP that gave me the address. If I want to have
the reverse DNS work correctly I must get the ISP who gave me the IP
address to change the PTR record  which points from an IP address to a
domain name. They control it, not me.  Can they delegate that
authority to me? How do they do that?

Since I have never done this, the questions are. Is all of this
correct? If so how do you go about setting up Reverse DNS.  Do you
just email the ISP and ask them to do it or is there some other
mechanism?

Thanks,
Bill

I'm not sure you want or need 2 nameservers.  That configuration is
used in situations where you have a class 3 subnet all to yourself
(256 IP addresses, not one), and the root nameserver point directly to
you.  You can't even get a class 3 subnet unless you can prove to
ICANN that you really need one.  If you're like me, you don't.  If you
are the head of IT at a brand-new corporate entity, then you might,
though you wouldn't be messing around with DHCP addresses from Comcast
in that case.

A picture is worth a thousand words.  I'll explain the setup that has
been working for me, with a static IP.  I am absolutely clueless on
dyndns.  If it were me, I'd spring for a static IP.  My explanation
will be told in the first person because it's my actual setup I will
be showing to you.

First, I go to my favorite domain name registrar.  I use 1planhost for
historical reasons, though godaddy, directnic, or most others are just
as good.  The key is finding one that allows you a feature called
"Total DNS Control".  Directnic charges an extra $5 for this feature,
so they suck.

Once I have purchased a domain name and it shows up in my list, I
click on it to enter the details page.  Then I look for that "Total
DNS Control" feature and click that.  This brings me to a web interace
that allows me to set the DNS entries on their nameserver.  Once
there, I set the following rules:

A records:

    HOST    Points to       TTL
    @       72.214.132.23   1 hour
    *       72.214.132.23   1 hour

MX records:

   Priority     Host    Goes to         TTL
   0            @       mail.wrlug.org  1 hour

That's it!  Notice that you use IP addresses in the A records, but
hostnames in the MX records.  BTW, this setup assumes you're running
your own mailserver, and its address can be resolved by the DNS server
running at the IP address specified in the A records.  If your mail is
being served from someone else's mailserver, you need the MX record to
point to them.

At this point, I have two nameservers (go on, do a whois lookup on
"wrlug.org") which are kept running by a 24/7 staff of IT guys, on a
big ol' pipe, and it costs me only $10 per year.  They happen to be
called park3.secureserver.net and park4.secureserver.net.  But all
these nameservers do is forward DNS requests to my own private DNS
server and mailserver.  You'd think the MX record would be redundant
because my private DNS server can resolve it, but DNS checking tools
balk unless there is an MX record on the authoratative nameserver, and
picky mailservers won't accept your mail.

There's actually another nameserver between 1planhost and me: Cox
Communications, the folks I pay for my static IP address and internet
access (the "Comcast" of Idaho).  Since I never have to call them for
any DNS-related stuff with my setup, I just pretend they're not there.
But as you'll see, remote pings and nslookups won't make sense unless
you're aware of their presence.  Cox's nameserver is the one that
actually has the power to tell remote users how to resolve my IP
address.  The IP address I entered in my A record at 1planhost would
be meaningless without Cox's ability to say "That IP address goes to
this node on my network, and I'll send you there."

Now I need a single DNS server listening at the IP address listed in
my A record (72.214.132.23), which is my home IP address.  Any DNS
requests for wrlug.org will go to the 1planhost nameservers first
(since theirs come before me in the Great DNS Hierarchy, starting with
the root nameserves at the top), and those nameservers will forward
the request to me (ignoring Cox in this discussion, but they're right
there, don't worry about that).  Once the DNS request is at my front
door, I can do anything I need with it.  Here's my forward zone file
for wrlug.org:

$TTL 1h

static                  IN  CNAME   ns.wrlug.org.

In my case, I run DNS, mail, web, wiki, blog, and mail on one physical
machine.  That's why all the CNAME records point to ns.wrlug.org.
This is not a requirement by any means.

ns.wrlug.org is a dual-homed box.  One nic card has the address
72.214.132.23, and it hangs out on the internet.  The other nic card
has the address 192.168.1.1, and it feeds my local subnet.  That's
right: my DNS, mail, web, wiki, blog, and mail server is also a router
and firewall.  "A bit dodgy", as the English say.  I use the local IP
addresses in my zone file because they work in all cases.  You might
think that a remote user's DNS request wouldn't resolve, but it does.
If I ping, nslookup and reverse-nslookup wrlug.org from a remote
location, I get this:

(Note: pippiandcarlos.com is my primary domain at home.  It's the only
one listed in my reverse zone file.  That's why 192.168.1.1
reverse-resolves to pippiandcarlos.com in my subnet.  This is of NO
CONSEQUENCE to remote users.)

But if you open a web browser and type in "www.wrlug.org", the IP
address listed by ping in the remote example above eventually resolves
to my DNS server, and once it's there I can further resolve the
request to my local web server, using a local IP address.  My DNS
setup only has to worry about what to do with the request once it
comes to me.  I don't know or care who the client is from a DNS
standpoint.  My webserver cares, but it has its own mechanism for
finding the client.

This is my recipe for success in a nutshell.  I'm sure it's not the
only way to go.  Others might attack it viciously.  I only care about
the people who own the 40 domain names that resolve nicely with this
setup.  None of them are complaining.

Yes, they can - easily. But many or most ISPs won't unless you're
an important customer, have a lot of IP addresses, etc. I suspect
that many ISPs use software rather than human intelligence to
handle the reverse DNS zones, so they're locked in by the
functionality of their software.


  How do they do that?

They just point the reverse DNS "name" to your DNS server.
Your server is configured to answer for those names.
It's exactly the same concept as forward DNS except, as
you point out, control is in different hands in the chain
above you.

Yes, you ask the ISP to set it up for you and you wait for
their reply that tells you they won't or can't.

Depends what you mean by "accessible".  If you wanted those machines on 
your subnet to have unique names to the outside world, e.g. 
red.yourdomain.com, blue.yourdomain.com, etc., then you would need to 
set up a nameserver.  But if you just want these machines to provide 
different services through the same domain name, e.g. a dedicated FTP 
server handling ftp://yourdomain.com, a dedicated Web server handling 
http://yourdomain.com, you wouldn't need to mess with DNS at all.

I've used DynDNS to host a site through Comcast.  I installed a startup 
script and cron job that would automatically update DynDNS nameservers 
if the address Comcast gave me ever changed.  You can find the stuff for 
that on SourceForge.  In fact, I think DynDNS has links to it on their site.

Crocs are sort of good in the rain :)  It will most likely be raining
or drizzling.

All bus/max/streetcar rides are 1.75.  Cabs are relatively cheap
compared to some cities (about $10 or less to get from anywhere below
to a hotel downtown).

Here's my assessment of the options:
Paddy's has a great set of tables in the middle and the back that are
good for groups. Full, very very good bar, excellent microbrews, very
good pub food. Possible pub-crawl to another Irish pub down the street
for late-night go-getters. Fareless square. (Paddy's is tough to park
near - if you're driving, you'll want to go to the nearest Smart
Park.)

Lucky Lab is full of long tables that are good for groups. Food isn't
perfect - it is cheap, with vegetarian options and many types of beer.
Cheapest place in the group, but still nice. It's a neighborhood
hangout. It would be very easy to initiate an epic pub crawl from
there - for those feeling adventurous. Not Fareless square - but easy
few block walk to the Street Car or a little further (~1mi) to the Max
(which is in the fareless square).

The Side Door is the smallest place, but they are awesome, have a few
big tables, and I've been there a lot  over the past couple of weeks.
Excellent food - includes some pasta dishes that are very good -
particularly for a pub! Small but good selection of beers/wine.  Not
Fareless square (but on a very major bus route!).

The Doug Fir is the Doug Fir :)  Great ambiance, good food, amazing
brownie/icecream dessert thing. Full bar. Seating groups there is
challenging (but so far not too many RSVPs), unless we head down to
the bar, which looks like has a series of garage pop bands playing and
will cost $10 (cheap for a good show!). Not Fareless (but on a major
bus route!).

I'm partial to Paddy's. I think everyone who cares should just vote on
where they'd like to go, since the locals are being so shy.

Right now, we've got two votes for Paddy's, one for Doug Fir (I voted
for Robert), and one for the Side Door. See the website for my lo-tech
voting system.

And transit info is now integrated into google maps for Portland.  Enter your
start and end points for "driving directions", and notice the new tab for
"transit".  Under options, select your desired departure or arrival time, and
you'll get one or more tri-met plans for your route.  Very cool.

Note that Google Maps also has a Street View tab for Portland, so the
visually oriented types can get
landmarks.  Somebody (Big Brother?) drove around taking pictures with a
pretty interesting camera
from about 18" above car roof level.  A little creepy if you ask me.

Makes me almost want to get google maps on my phone.  All I need is a 
better phone and a better phone company.

i would buy an iPhone if I did not have to use AT&T.  And it was not 
locked down and closed off.

For those who can only take public transportation, is the Doug Fir
easy enough to get to?  It is also outside fareless square.

I was considering suggesting Henry's on 10 NW 12th Ave but I don't
think they have wireless.  And the second thought was are any of the
suggested places not going to be packed on a Friday night?  I think
Henry's and Doug Fir will be.

Mark

Easy enough? I walked there from the convention center during OSCon, and then 
walked up to the double tree after dinner.  It wasn't a short walk, but 
that's why I pack crocs I guess :-)

I just figure everything will be packed... best to call ahead if we can.

Here's the complete announcement for those who are interested:

   Data Center Security:
   Resolving Core Conflicts Between IT Operations and IT Security
   6:30pm Tuesday, Oct 16th -- Eugene City Brewery (downstairs)

   Why does it seem that security and operations are so often at odds
   with each other?  After all, they both have the same objective to
   ensure that IT is helping the business meet its goals, effectively,
   efficiently and securely.  However, operations and security often have
   an adversarial relationship, each causing the other unplanned work or
   crises, sometimes undoing each others' work, and often unable to agree
   on priorities and perhaps even questioning the others' competence and
   "hidden agendas."  In this session, Gene Kim will share his most
   recent research on how to create a high performing data center with
   optimal security and operational efficiency.

   Gene Kim is the CTO and founder of Tripwire, Inc.  In 1992, he
   co-authored Tripwire while at Purdue University with Dr. Gene
   Spafford.  Since then, Tripwire has been adopted by more than 5,500
   enterprises worldwide.  Since 1999, he has been studying high
   performing IT operations and security organizations, which led Gene to
   co-found the IT Process Institute (ITPI) in 2004, an organization
   dedicated to research, benchmarking and developing prescriptive
   guidance for IT operations, security management, and auditors.  This
   same year Gene co-authored the "Visible Ops Handbook: Implementing
   ITIL in Four Practical And Auditable Steps" which has since sold over
   75,000 copies. And, he was a principal investigator on the IT Controls
   Performance Study project, completed in 2006.

How about a Nokia N800 and use Bluetooth for a DUN or a data plan.  Heck

Subject: [PLUG] Busted computer
Message-ID: <20071016221320.6df62c91@Devil6.hsd1.or.comcast.net>

This time it seems to be a bad superblock. Googling on "superblock"
yields a lot, but the more I google the confuseder I get. Here is what
led up to the problem:

A couple days ago at PSU the computer would not boot. The error message
seemed to have something to do with being unable to find the Realtek
ethernet port. I carry a phillips head screwdriver with me, and I used
it to disassemble the part of the case over the ethernet plug. Then I
tapped on it a lot, loosened and tightened the screws holding the
housing over it, and reassembled it. It booted normally. But later at
home it exhibited the same symptoms. I got it to boot just by banging
it lightly on the corner where the ethernet plug is located. Since then
I have rebooted half a dozen times without incident.

Today, upon returning home from PSU, I got 

Grub loading 1.5
Please wait
Error 2

All the usual disassembly/banging on things/reassembly failed to remedy
the problem. "Error 2" appears to be a Grub error that means (loosely
translated) "dude, sumpin' bad happened to your filesystem." Further
googling and trying various things at the command line after booting to
a Gutsy Release Candidate live CD reveals that evidently I have a bad
superblock on /dev/hda2.

Aside: Although they are scattered all over the place and would be a
PITA to reassemble, I have backup copies of everything on /dev/hda2
that would be bad to lose, except a couple of recent documents and the
last couple of weeks worth of financial data in Quickbooks (restorable
from paper copies). 

Aside 2: On the outside of the case this appears to be a Compaq R3240
laptop. In reality is is a rebadged Piece-O-Shit (tm) laptop assembled
from parts supplied by the lowest bidder by lead-poisoned Chinese
laborers. And yes, I have begun shopping for its replacement.

Returning to the topic at hand, at

http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/understanding-unixlinux-filesystem-superblock.html

I gathered that Linux keeps copies of the superblock data which you can
get with "dumpe2fs /dev/hda3 | grep -i superblock." Unfortunately, that
doesn't work on a filesystem that cannot be mounted (already tried
that). The site also suggests "e2fsck -f /dev/hda2," but that also
fails if the superblock can't be read. Finally, the site suggests "sudo
e2fsck -f /dev/hda2" to get the data. This resulted in:

Block size = 4896 (log=2)
7325696 inodes, 14651288 blocks
732564 blocks 5.88% reserved for the super user
First data block = 0
Maximum filesystem blocks = 4294967296
448 block groups
32768 blocs per group, 32768 fragments per group
16352 inodes per group
Superblock backups stored on blocks:
   32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632,
2654208, 4896000, 7962624, 11239424

And evidently I can repair the superblock with a command like "e2fsck
-f -b 8193 /dev/hda2," except the site let me down by failing to tell
me what the "8193" or the -f and -b mean. I am guessing that the "8193"
should be one of the numbers of where the superblock backups are stored
above, and that any of them will do.

I am about to run:

e2fsck -f -b 32768 /dev/hda2

But before I do it and end up destroying western civilization, I
thought I might ask here first to see if my thinking is correct.

Hi all,

My perl skills are still in the very preliminary stages (although I
highly recommend the "Learning Perl" book from O'Reilly!), but might
anyone know how I could take a large text file that has no hard
wrapping, and apply hard wraps every 80 characters or so? Something
short and to the point would be best.

Any ideas?

Might work, I would install testdisk. There is a deb package so I assume
there is an ubuntu one also.I remember it being able to repair this
superblock problem. On the other hand western civilization does not have
much left so go ahead, destroy what is left.

Perfect! fmt is exactly what I was hoping for, and Text::Wrap will
come in handy someday too.

Well, I did it. For future reference, a switch that would tell e2fsck
"just make all the changes you need to and don't bug me about it
because I wouldn't understand your messages anyway" would have been
useful. I ended up having to hit "y" several thousand times.

When it finished it seems to have repaired the superblock and most of
the other problems, except evidently something Ubuntu needs in order to
boot got deleted or moved, because the boot screen starts and then
hangs. 

I booted again to the Ubuntu live CD and I can mount the
filesystem, but it won't let me move files or anything. So now I'm
going to boot to Knoppix, mount the fileystem as root, copy ~/home to
DVDs, and then let things sit until Thursday when Gutsy finally comes
out. Then I will wipe the hard disk and start over again from scratch.
Dapper was the last time I did a clean install instead of an upgrade,
so it's probably not a bad idea, in spite of the PITA it will be to
reinstall over a hundred apps and reconfigure everything. And while
waiting I will shop for a new laptop.

Western civilization cheated death yet again.

FWIW, most of the time I've personally seen the superblock problem, it
has turned out to be something not wrong with the filesystem.  That
is, the block device is missing or somewhere unexpected.  That doesn't
sound like your problem though.  But for reference.

The added bonus is that fmt works great within vi(m). For instance, 
to wrap a really long line of text, get the cursor to the beginning of 
the line and (in command mode) type

:.!fmt

Or if you've got a paragraph with a really ragged right side, position 
the cursor at the beginning of the paragraph and (in command mode) 
type

!}fmt

Oh, you just had to go an bring up vi.  In emacs, just put your cursor
in the paragraph and type:  M-q

   M-q runs the command fill-paragraph
      which is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `textmodes/fill'.
   (fill-paragraph ARG)

   Fill paragraph at or after point.  Prefix ARG means justify as
   well.  If `sentence-end-double-space' is non-nil, then period
   followed by one space does not end a sentence, so don't break a
   line there.  the variable `fill-column' controls the width for
   filling.

   If `fill-paragraph-function' is non-nil, we call it (passing our
   argument to it), and if it returns non-nil, we simply return its
   value.

   If `fill-paragraph-function' is nil, return the `fill-prefix' used
   for filling.

Lots fewer keystrokes! ;-)

Laptop hard drives are readily available.  No need to replace the entire 
machine unless there are /other/ reasons.  Just a FYI.

Well... in vim you can just map the fmt command and have equally few
keystrokes:

map <C-K> j{!}fmt -w80 -u<cr>}

(You can of course do it in other implementations, but not with this
exact syntax.)

Also, vim has 'gq' and 'gw' which will format text and, unlike fmt, is
smart enough to preserve comment symbols at the beginning of the line.

Yeah, yeah. I've always wished for a vi(m) builtin as handy as M-q, 
which I use copiously when working in emacs. Additionally, the 
fill-paragraph command usually does The Right Thing in regard to 
bullet lists, leading whitespace, etc. Getting fmt to understand all 
that is an exercise in frustration.

In (al)pine, I use Eduardo Chappa's very cool fillpara patch that's 
reasonably good at figuring out line-based text prefixes (such as the 
"Paul> " that Gnus used in your reply) and doing paragraph rewrites 
accordingly. It's very handy when replying to e-mail messages with 
long lines or ragged paragraphs.

> Lots fewer keystrokes! ;-)

Emacs users don't get to say that very often, so enjoy it while you 
can! :-)

Or use Vim's text formatting command:

"To tell Vim to format the current paragraph:

	gqap

This starts with the "gq" command, which is an operator.  Following is
"ap", the text object that stands for "a paragraph".  A paragraph is
separated from the next paragraph by an empty line."

Drats! Didn't check this account until today and see I've missed an
actual meeting! I tried atending a PDXLUG meeting back in the spring
and there was no one else there so I'd given the group up for dead. I
have noted the change of location and will attend next month.

Hard drives and equipment fail, data should not fail with them.  It is
time I taught you how to do automated nightly backups with dirvish.  We
are usually too busy at the clinic to do such things, so perhaps we 
should set up a "dirvish workshop" at some different time and place. 

Who else would be interested?

Yes, there are other reasons. The only good thing I have to say about
this machine is that it runs Ubuntu flawlessly and everything has
always just worked, except I did have to learn how to use ndiswrapper
for the wireless. The quality of the design and the components is the
problem. It's two and a half years old and is now in its second
keyboard, and many other things have had to be fixed as well. 

As for the hard drive, I replaced the original 60 GB 4200-rpm with an
80 GB 7200-rpm drive just to get better speed. Both drives have given
me constant problems similar to the current embroglio. And the reason
has nothing to do with the drives - they are fine. The problem is the
connector on the bottom of the motherboard which is 1/4 inch too far to
the right and 1/8 inch too deep. (See what I mean about rotten design?)
As a result the drive connection is flaky. I can't blame Linux, Ubuntu,
ext3, or even the drive itself when I get a corrupted filesystem. I
have inserted wedges and jimmied the thing around for long enough. I'm
sick of it. Time to move on. 

Back to the problem at hand. It is now morning, the first cup of coffee
is doing its thing, and the synapses are starting to function again. As
a result it occurred to me that I ought to try recovery mode to see
what the boot process is hanging on. That resulted in the following:

Begin: Running /scripts/init-bottom ...
Done.
run-init: /sbin/init: No such file or directory
[   35.786176] Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!
[   35.786242]

Whereupon it hangs. 

This looks repairable to me. Although my backups are sporadic,
elsewhere I do probably have a copy of whatever file it is looking for.
However, I could use some help figuring out exactly what file went 
missing after the thousands of repairs that e2fsck did last night. 

Using a Knoppix CD I find the following in the /boot folder:

/boot
	/grub
		splashimages [folder]
		default
		device.map
		e2fs_stage1_5
		fat_stage1_5
		jfs_stage1_5
		menu.lst (looked at with Gedit, seems intact)
		menu.lst (various backup copies)
		minix_stage1_5
		reiserfs_stage1_5
		stage1
		stage2
		xfs_stage1_5
	abi-2.6.20-15-generic
	abi-2.6.20-16-generic
	config-2.6.20-15-generic
	config-2.6.20-16-generic
	initrd.img-2.6.17-11-generic.bak
	initrd.img-2.6.20-15-generic
	initrd.img-2.6.20-15-generic.bak
	initrd.img-2.6.20-16-generic
	initrd.img-2.6.20-16-generic.bak
	memtest86+.bin
	System.map-2.6.20-15-generic
	System.map-2.6.20-16-generic
	vmlinuz-2.6.20-15-generic
	vmlinuz-2.6.20-16-generic

This looks normal to me. The boot menu lists the 15 and 16 kernels,
recovery modes for each, and memtest (five items total). 

In / there are also:

initrd.img
initrd.img.old
vmlinuz
vmlinuz.old

Any suggestions for what might be missing/corrupted?

I should note for Emacs newbies that M-q is pronounced "Meta Q" and
can be typed by holding down the Alt key while pressing the q key.

The alternative (once upon a time this was useful when logged into
remote machines with broken terminal emulation, I haven't needed to do
this in years) is to press the Escape key (Esc) and then press the q
key.

Dear Mr. Jordan.
    My laptop running Fiesty Fawn is running along just fine. At what 
point should I consider the upgrade to Gutsy Gibbon?
I look at this thing to see how many games I can run on it. Yes, Yes, I 
am aware that the winduhs boxes do that better,
but I want to make a linux box be gamer freindly. (as much as I can 
afford)  The Business software alliance ever looks at me
and I give them the middle finger. to turn on the linux box...

Message-ID: <20071017102708.7882717c@Devil6.hsd1.or.comcast.net>

While fiddling with the boogered up drive, I want to copy ~/ to DVDs
using a Knoppix live CD. The laptop has a DVD drive, but the Knoppix CD
was in it when I launched K3b. I had to use the paper clip to eject it,
after which I inserted a blank DVD. Knoppix sees /dev/hda2 and K3b lets
me drag files from ~/ to its Burn window. But when I tell it to burn
the DVD I get:

Waiting for media...
Writing DVD+R
Using growisofs 6.1 - Copyright ... etc.
Starting writing...
:-( unable to O_EXCL /dev/hdc: someone was in time to remount?
Fatal error at startup: Device or resource busy
mkisofs did not exit cleanly
Error while4 creating ISO image
Unable to eject media

I'm not sure what "someone was in time to remount?" means. I tried
remounting /dev/hdc, but I can't open a terminal without the Knoppix CD
in the drive. This arrangement isn't working. There must be a simpler
way to do this. How do you use a live CD to burn data to the same drive
that the live CD is in?

If that doesn't sounds like a meeting speaker pitch I've never heard one.  I'm
sure either Alan or Dave can find a good opportunity for you.

You are asking the wrong person. I am not a gamer. My Feisty computers
don't even have solitaire on them. Perhaps someone else knows about
running games on Linux.

However, I can suggest that you try the live CD of Gutsy anyway. As
long as you have a net connection you can install anything you want
while it's running live to try it out.

How about just booting off a USB key with a rescue image? Also if the
GUI burning app is giving you hassles, try bashburn--it is about the
best burning software out there.

This would not be a presentation.  Workshops are hands on, and  will
require a site for people to bring their computers and work on them,
not just watch.  Free Geek would be fine, but we will not be there
to solve random problems like we do at the clinics, and there will
even be prerequisites ("read this, do that") because time at the
workshop is limited.  Also, the workshops are likely to repeat
regularly, as new people appear and we learn more.

I can imagine three workshop subjects, each repeated twice a year:
dirvish backups, configuring inbound VPN, and establishing a web
of trust.  If individuals have their machines properly set up for
backups and communication, and can trust specific other people on
their machines, then we can do many other things remotely, and set
up "virtual" clinics and workshops for other problems.  

The regular clinic is fine for general debugging and installing
distros and such.  We can even use it for "workshop prep" for the
folks having trouble meeting the prerequisites.  But the clinic
is too chaotic and unstructured to lead a whole group through a
specific subject.

If you had to use a paper clip to eject the disk then Linux was still using it.
Knoppix had it mounted as it's root FS.

Use a LiveCD that loads the FS into ram so the drive is free for other things.

If you get another one, please consider donating your cast off laptop

we can't use them, they'll go to Free Geek.

It is looking for /sbin/init.  That could be in the initrd file. (I
don't use initrd's typically, so forgive my uncertainty, and someone
smarter please correct me), or might be in the root filesystem.  You
could try substituting init with a kernel option in the grub kernel
line:

  init=/bin/bash

so, if you start with something like this:

  title           Debian GNU/Linux, kernel 2.6.22-2-amd64
  root            (hd0,0)
  kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.22-2-amd64 root=/dev/hda1 ro 
  initrd          /boot/initrd.img-2.6.22-2-amd64
  savedefault
  
stop grub from booting automatically, and (following the on screen
directions), edit the kernel line to say this instead:

  kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.22-2-amd64 root=/dev/hda1 ro init=/bin/bash

and see if it can find that.  That init option tells it to use bash
instead of the init program.

Again, I'll just note that most of the time I've seen this kind of
message it is because it is looking at the wrong filesystem for some
reason.

Thanks for the suggestion, although I already thought of that half an
hour ago. :)

Unfortunately, the only one I had handy was a Fedora 7 Test4 CD. It
works fine, except it doesn't come with K3b or such. It does seem to
grok Nautilus' CD burning tool. However, I can't get it to work. After
loading Fedora into RAM the drive popped open. I inserted a blank DVD,
which subsequently appeared on the desktop. I mounted /dev/hda2, after
figuring out that Fedora decided it should be called /dev/sda2. Then I
dragged some folders from ~/ to the desktop icon. That seemed to get
them into the Nautilus Burn CD folder. However the "Write to Disk"
button just pops up a window where everything is grayed out. Thinking
that the DVD might not be mounted I spent the last 15 minutes trying to
figure out what Fedora calls it so I can mount it. I tried
"cat /proc/devices" but that doesn't list it. Nor does /etc/fstab. And
I already know it's not /dev/hdc or /dev/sdc. Sheesh.

Eventually the Nautilus burner utility stopped responding, although I
could still eject the DVD. I rebooted Fedora and tried again, but this
time it locked up on me. So much for Fedora. Maybe I should try
something else that will run in RAM. Does anyone have any suggestions
for live CDs that will run in RAM, besides Fedora?

Slax!!!

All you Slackware users now have a new devotee. Loads into RAM if you
give it the "copy2ram" boot option, pops the CD out, the instructions
say how to log in as root, how to start x, and there you are - a
complete KDE desktop with an icon for K3b right in the system tray. It
even automatically mounted /dev/hda2. Coolness!

Subject: [PLUG] tape archive problem
Message-ID: <200710171432.58700.t_rex@verizon.net>

I am trying to use a tape drive to archive some important files that took a 
lot of time to create and still take time to maintain.  I use a flash drive 
at the moment and it works, I've had to restore the files from one crash 
already. 

I want to use the tape drive as an extra because I already have it and several 
tapes left over from WIN98 days.

The machine is a Pentium 450MHz  w/256Meg of RAM running Red Hat 8

The tape drive is a HP T1000e formerly Colorado Data connected to the parallel 
port.  The printer is also connected to the same port through the tape drive.

If I type 'mt status', I get an error message to effect NO SUCH DEVICE.

I looked at dmesg and found the message:

parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778)  [PCSSPP, TRISTATE]
parport0: irq 7 detected
parport0 probe: warning, class 'TAPEDRIVE' not understood.
parport 0: Unknown device, Hewlett-Packard Corp. T1000e 

Can anyone help me get this thing working, is it possible to make it work?

   Uh-oh! Years ago I spent a lot of time -- and money -- trying to get
CDS/HP 'floppy' tape drives to work. Finally gave up on 'em. And this was on
the advice of the guy who had written the driver and knew those drives and
linux/UNIX better than anyone. The parallel port drives are just as bad.

> Can anyone help me get this thing working, is it possible to make it work?

   If you want to use tape, get a better system. I've used only tapes for
backup on linux the past decade, and have been happily using a Tandberg Data
SLR-60 drive for the past 6 years. It's a SCSI drive, I replace the tapes
every couple of years, and it works flawlessly from cron jobs. Incremental
backups Monday-Thursday nights, full backups Friday nights. I've been using
the BRU software for years and it's been a rock-solid combination of
hardware and software.

   I've used the tapes to restore the system to a new hard drive as well as
restoring files I've accidently deleted. Hard drive systems are probably
less expensive now, but this works so well for me that I have no incentive
to change. YMMV.

Looks like that model holds less per tape than a CD-R.  Which is for the
best, since it doesn't appear to be supported under Linux.  (I suspect
most old Colorado drives are slow, noisy implementations of /dev/null.)

If you don't have a CD-RW drive, they can be had cheap at the Freegeek
store.  I could even try to have one ready at the Clinic this Sunday.

Decent machine, a bit faster than my main laptop, but how do you get
security updates for a distro that old?

No, next one (8.04, shipping April 2008) will be.

Yes, if you want to roll out a distro and stick with it for 2+ years.

I've been thinking of such things, but it will be a while before I get

I saw your note this morning, but have been too busy all day to try
it. I just did and it didn't work. I still get the kernel panic:

run-init: /bin/bash: no such file or directory
[99.617976] kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!
[99.618042] 

I rebooted to the Slackware live CD (love it, becoming my favorite
rescue CD!) and navigated to /bin. There is definitely a bash
executable there, so it's not that it's missing or located someplace
else.

Can I use something else besides bash? 

And if anyone else is running Ubuntu, what is the init program that
grub is looking for?

Maybe try copying a matching kernel/initrd from somewhere else and try

Omigod, I have been refreshing the main Ubuntu page over and over today.
A couple hours ago the "one day left" suddenly changed to "Download,
More Information." I immediately raced off to the download page, but it
still showed only 7.04. About an hour ago it went back to the "one day
left" message. 

We're on the west coast of North America. It's got to be October 18
somewhere in the world. C'mon Ubuntu. Hurry up! Before I wet my pants!

Dear John, 

In light of the planned 10/20 GutsyRelease Party at FreeGeek,
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OregonTeam/GutsyReleaseParty , 

They might already be planning to leave a few or more Gutsy CDs at
FreeGeek . . . OTOH, I'm sure your CDs will be welcome at the party and
would earn you karma points good for pizza.

Thanks,

I decided to figure out about initrd's a little bit, having managed to
remain mostly ignorant of them 'til now.  According to the mkinitramfs
manpage, an "initramfs [or initrd] is a gzipped cpio archive".  To see
the contents of a particular initrd, you ought to be able to get a
listing with this command, e.g.:

  zcat /boot/initrd.img-2.6.17-2-686 | cpio -i --list -v | less

substituting your own initrd filename.  Or, actually extract it into a
temporary directory, say:

  mkdir /tmp/my-initrd
  cd /tmp/my-initrd
  
  zcat /boot/initrd.img-2.6.17-2-686 | cpio -i -v 

and see if it blows chunks in interesting ways.  If it extracts
cleanly, then I guess it isn't corrupt.  In which case, look at the
init you find there.  It's a shell script and fairly linear.  It might
shed some clues.

Knoppix will load into ram as well, just type "knoppix toram" at the
boot prompt.  Since it copies the entire contents of the CD into RAM,
you will need at least 1Gig on board to hold the CD and still have some
memory to run programs in.

Good Luck,

I think this is not just confined to Ubuntu.  I have this problem with 
later versions of Fedora Core 6 kernels on the AMD64.  Same error with a 
kernel panic added in for fun.

Once I get a better monitor on that box, I will see if I can get better 
answers.  Try a kernel around 2.6.18 and see if it works.

Well, this morning I suddenly realized that the initrd files all had a
backup sitting right there, so why not try them? I didn't know why this
did not occur to me before. However, sadly, the .bak versions resulted
in the same kernel panic. 

	initrd.img-2.6.17-11-generic.bak
	initrd.img-2.6.20-15-generic
	initrd.img-2.6.20-15-generic.bak
	initrd.img-2.6.20-16-generic
	initrd.img-2.6.20-16-generic.bak

So then (using Slax) I unzipped them with Ark into Kate so I could view
them. They are all unreadable, but Kate announced that I should not
save the file because it is a binary file. I don't know what that is
supposed to look like, but there were only a few small sections that
were human readable, things like "qla24xx_get_isp_stats." The rest was
all upper ASCII junk.

Assuming this means they are corrupt, I decided I should just rename
them, then copy over from a full disk backup that I made a month ago.
Unfortunately, I did it over ethernet with nfs to my desktop computer
using cp and, for some reason that I do not understand, the
entire /boot folder is not there. Naturally, the one folder I need. If
I ever find that Murphy dude his ass is dead.

Googling on "initrd" tells me that apparently the initrd.img file is
for loading modules. If that's the case, then it will be unique to the
computer on which it is installed. In other words, I can't just grab an
initrd file from somewhere on ubuntu.com and slap it in my /boot
folder. I do have a couple of USB disks that I have used for backups in
the past, including one which I believe has a full tar image of my hard
disk and perhaps other backups. These would be old files, but I haven't
added any hardware to the computer, so the initrd files should be the
same, assuming I am correct about what their purpose is.

I need to study this some more to see what that kernel panic error
message is all about. I also need to get a large shovel for digging the
USB disks out of the closet where I think they are.

Meantime I am downloading Gutsy, both 32-bit and 64-bit. Evidently the
Kubuntu, Xubuntu and Edubuntu versions are not yet available, but at
least we will have copies of the standard versions for the Clinic on
Sunday. The download is slow, and there are no torrents. :(

The "old way" of using tar.gz archives for initrd went away some time 
back.  They are now gzipped cpio archives.

  gunzip -c < /boot/initrd.img-2.6.18-5-k7 > /tmp/initrd
  cpio --list < /tmp/initrd

I am currious as to the specs of the machine having this problem.  I am 
seeing an AMD64 machine that gets a similar error on boot, but only with a 
new kernel.  If I use an old kernel, it is fine.  (I have a feeling it 
relates to an ata kernel bug that has been fixed by the kernel team, but 
not made it into the current releases.)

Any chance of getting a copy of /sbin/lspci for the problem machine?

Message-ID: <4717A0B3.5020603@comcast.net>

The other day I was wandering around my system looking for how to
upgrade Flash and Java for Firefox on my system. I discovered that I
hadn't run Online Update in some time. So, I ran it. When it was
finished, I rebooted, since it told me that I had some kernel updates
and a reboot would be needed for them to be used.

OK. No problem. I rebooted. The system came up in text mode with an
error message that said something to the effect that X couldn't find any
screens, or something like that. I Googled around a bit and found the
instructions for running tiny-nvidia-installer. That worked.

Today I tried to run VMWare Server, which worked fine recently. As I sit
here, I'm not sure if I tried to run it since the Online Update, but I
think I did. Is there a log file that would tell me the last time it ran?

Oops, must have been a memory blip.  The "old way" was gzipped mountable

Yes, but I thought that Ark would know what they are and use
appropriate unzipping tools, which I think it did.

Using lspci would require that it be booted, and I haven't succeeded at
that yet. I do have Slax running on it, and Slax happily mounted the
hard disk, so I can give you a copy of any file you want, but not the
output of a command. That is, unless there is some magic way of getting
the output of lspci when the machine is not booted.

The two kernels available in the Grub boot menu are 2.6.20-15-generic
and -16-generic. Neither will boot, regardless of which initrd.img file
I try - and I tried all four of them. The date stamps on the -15- kernel
initrd files are 2007-04-24 and 2007-04-25, and for the -16- kernel
2007-09-04 and 2007-09-28. In each case the older of the two was named
-.bak.

I am wondering what would happen if I took an amd64 initrd.img file
from my desktop, which also runs Ubuntu Feisty amd64, and stuck it on
the laptop. Looking at them the date stamps are different. I'm going to
try it this evening after I get back from school, which is where I'm
off to right after I send this.

For VMWare logs, try checking the /var/log, event viewer or what have
you inside the VM you ran for startup messages/timestamps.

And the thing with letting a distro update your kernel for you is that
it typically won't keep track of any 3rd party modules you added
yourself.

When this happened to me for a video card before, and for VirtualBox
recently, I forwent the hassle of trying to figure out how to get the
program to rebuild the modules for the new kernel and just re-ran the
installers.

I can't imagine why you would want to use tape over flash if the data is 
that small.  Evey angle I see it at shows the flash drive as being more 
convenient and cheaper.

I plan on buying an AMD64 dual core machine in the next couple of months. 
I have yet to be able to figure out what of the AMD64 processors support 
the hardware virtualization.  (Hopefully it does since that is one of the 
main reasons I am buying a new machine.)

For what it's worth, my experience is that Pentium D processors are 
fairly pokey when compared to Core 2 models.

You just have to be careful to read motherboard reviews - just because
they support a chip that has VT, doesn't mean they support VT. It's
extremely frustrating to get a new server with VT-enabled chips to find
that 1.5 years after release, IBM still hasn't enabled it in the BIOS.
Grrrrr. (I've seen this happen on some consumer stuff too)

I found /var/log/vmware/vmware-serverd.log

The last entry is:

Oct 16 15:55:53: app| Shutting down vmserverd (0).

That time fits with when I shut down the system after running the upgrade.

There are 11 files with names similar to vmware-serverd-1.log, differing
only by the number after the dash, or having no number or dash. All of
those other files have date modified codes that are earlier than yesterday.

I also found
event-/var/lib/vmware/Virtual%20Machines/Windows%2098/Windows%2098.vmx.log

The last entry is:

<event
type="info"><time>1191969575</time><subject>Power-on</subject><body><p>The
virtual machine was Powered-on</p></body></event>

Is there a tool to convert that integer to something I can understand?

When I try to start vmware server now, I watch the blinking icon for a
minute or so, and then nothing happens. I tried that with top running in
a terminal window and didn't see anything related to vmware. I looked at
ps ax and didn't see anything related to vmware.

However, the date modified is 2007-10-09 15:36. There is one other
event... file, but it's date modified is October of 2006.

Ark rarely gets anything right.  If you don't see a file tree, it isn't 
reading cpio.

Here's a javascript converter for epoch time:

http://www.esqsoft.com/javascript_examples/date-to-epoch.htm

The entry in that log would be Tue Oct 09 2007 15:39:35 GMT-0700 (PDT).

When I said to check the logs, I actually meant to start the VMs,
after you had solved the problem. Try running VMWare from a terminal
window, and I suspect you'll see it freaking out over not having any
kernel modules loaded/available. Run lsmod to make sure, then either
re-install VMWare to get it to build new modules (I'm not familiar
with when/where it'll actually make them), or googlize the issue, as
there may be some easier fix. Once you have the module ready to go and
in the right place, just load it and VMWare -should- work.

Any AMD that is a 2200 series should have AMD-V.  I typically don't buy pentium
servers so don't know which Intel models support it.

I just checked my Lenovo T61, so here is one Intel that supports it. :)

rsteff at Moonguide:~> vmware
vmware is installed, but it has not been (correctly) configured
for this system. To (re-)configure it, invoke the following command:
/usr/bin/vmware-config.pl.

I ran vmware-config.pl as root. It complained about a minor version
difference for gcc, which I told it to ignore. It started just fine
after that, and it fixed a problem with poor quality sound.

Thanks for the pointers.

Cool. Thanks! That is exactly what I needed to know.

   OK. My AMD64 Athlon X2 4800+ _does_ support virtualization. Thanks for
providing the correct flag name, Kris.

   Next: how to tell if the motherboard supports it? I've an Asus M2NPV-VM
board. Do the last two letters stand for Virtual Machine?

Not sure how useful this will be for white-box hardware, but might help.

   Nah. But, ... Google comes through again!

   On the xen-users forum I found a thread that included this useful
information:

"... I just built a system specifically for Xen from what I could find
locally:

"AM2 Athlon64 3200+ (The only single core AM2 in the city, apparently) ASUS
M2NPV-VM motherboard

"There was no BIOS option for enabling/disabling the feature. It just worked
and I have WinXP happily running as a domU."

   So, apparently the -VM does stand for Virtual Machine and this motherboard
does not list a speed limit for the Athlon X2 CPUs.

Thanks, Kris,

Rich

"In the next couple of months", you should be able to get a quad-core 
opteron with virtualization support (given that they "became available" 
almost a month ago.)

The trick is finding a motherboard or any sort of information about 
them.  AMD seems to be doing a great job with press releases and 
absolutely sucking at publishing clear and easily accessible technical 
info (where said info can be easily correlated to a retail site from 
which a customer could perhaps purchase one or more CPUs and a 
motherboard.)  The press releases imply that I can easily get a 
dual-socket motherboard for some quad-core opteron CPUs and have me 8 
cores.  Google seems to think it is a unicorn though.  Links to 
known-to-work-with-linux setups would be great.

Perhaps something with two x16 pci-express slots so that (several 
hundred more dollars later) an argument with the nvidia driver and/or 
X/beryl will answer whether or not 4-monitor xinerama with opengl is 
finally a reality?

I can't afford an Opteron.  The cpu speeds on the Opteron are slow enough 
that I don't quite see the benefit.  Four 2000mhz processors v.s. two 
3000mhz processors at more than double the cost.

The motherboard I am looking at will do a single AM2 processor.

The board I have been looking at will do that. (MSI K{something} Diamond 
board.)

I grabbed the Ubuntu ISO at about 2:00am.  It only took about 25 min to
download another 25 to install.  I personally think Ubuntu gets better and
better with every release.  I cant wait for KDE 4.0 to become the standard
in Kubuntu.  How many more releases? two?

VM doesn't mean that.  I can't recall ATM, but I know VM is typically 
used on most of their smaller footprint motherboards over the years.  I 
belive the "M" is for Micro-ATX.  The V could be for onboard video.  I 
realize this wouldn't be consistent designating across their line up but 
ASUS has never been good about that and I've used them for years.

I can't speak for AMD systems, but at least for Intel there is no
specific motherboard requirement for VMX.  You need a BIOS which does
not disable VMX, since the Intel implementation includes a lock bit,
typically used to provide a BIOS knob to enable/disable VMX
capabilities.  Other than that, you just need a CPU that supports it.

Note that the Wikipedia entry has a pretty good listing of CPUs
supporting both Intel and AMD extensions.

Thanks I have torrents going now for edubuntu and kubuntu, both 32- and
64-bit, and also the 32- and 64-bit regular Ubuntu DVD images (slow!!).
But I can't find torrents for xubuntu. Anyone have any idea where I can
find them. Or have they not yet been released?

Meantime, I'm using my Lightscribe drives to make Ubuntu Gutsy artwork
on the CDs.

   Oh. Well, anyway, it does support virtualization and that was the
question. I could not care less what the letters mean on any system board's
name, regardless of manufacturer. :-)

While we're on the subject, there are now quite a few different ways one 
can virtualize. Does anyone know which ones even require this option and 
what it does for them? As far as I know:

1. VMware Workstation 6 (Linux host) doesn't require it and may not even 
use it.
2. Xen requires it only if you want to run unmodified kernels as guests, 
and if you want to run Linux guests, the Xen-modified guest kernels have 
higher performance than unmodified ones.
3. KVM requires it.

Anybody else know more/disagree, etc.?

Linux-Vserver (www.linux-vserver.org) doesn't.  But it only supports 
Linux in the guests.  There was some discussion about running VMware 
inside a guest.

What Intel VT gives you is the ability to run an unpatched OS in a 
para-virtualized environment i.e. Xen.  Without hardware support for 
virtualization, you cannot run an out-of-the-box OS (Windows, unpatched 
Linux, etc) as a virtual client OS.  There are several good articles 
available on Wikipedia and Xensource on how para-virtualization works, 
versus full hardware abstraction like VMware.

VT will give you a performance boost over full hardware abstraction, 
since your are using the system resources directly rather than multiple 
layers of virtual drivers.

When I'm thinking laptops and not trying to be overly parsimonious,
Thinkpads end up at the top of my list.  They're nice-looking,
well-designed, not unpleasant to support, and usually run the OS of
one's choice beautifully.  When I get a Real Job, I hope to replace my
aging Dell with a Thinkpad X series.

Out of curiosity, what's your answers to these for your last laptop?  
I've never bought a new laptop, but my list of extras are high-cap
battery + spare, power-supply, dock (if cheap) and a DVD-RW drive.
Extra warranty, if cheap.

Find a friendly IBM employee.  You just need their name and ID to get

My company just replaced my old Thinkpad T42P that had overheating issues
with a new T61.

The issues I recall that I encountered.
1. My T61 has a very new nvidia chipset, it did not work properly with the
opensource nvidia driver.  It only worked with the newer nvidia commercial
driver and vesa.
2. The software to run the fingerprint scanner doesn't work very reliably (I
never tried it under windows so it could perform the same there)
3. The battery life isn't any better than the older T42P I'm replacing (not
just a Linux issue, it's not very good under windows XP)

I'd add that these are generally only worth it (in my experience) if they
are available through the manufacturer, or a reputable local shop. Dealing
with third-party warranty companies is a PITA, and the fine print almost
always ends up taking a big bite out of the benefit.

Relatedly, I too am shopping, to replace a Thinkpad T23. The T61 is right up
there for me, as is the Dell XPS M1330. I'd like to support someone like
System 76, and the Darter has all the bullet points, but I'm concerned about
build quality. They seem to use a lot of plastic in their construction, and
after being used to the magnesium alloy tank that is the Thinkpad, I'm
afraid that might be disappointing.

You can get T61's with Intel graphics chipsets.

I just purchased a 14" T61 to replace the T43 that I had been using before
I got laid off. It's got intel graphics, purposefully chosen because
of intel's support for open source drivers, and an intel 3945 wifi
chipset. I skipped frippery like bluetooth and the fingerprint reader,
but grabbed the 9 cell battery. I debated getting the 15" with the wsxga+
display, as I'm a screen real estate glutton, but am happy with the 14"
sxga+ form factor.

I'm running openSUSE 10.3 on it, graphics work fine, sound required
grabbing updated alsa packages and drivers from the multimedia:audio
repository on opensuse's buildservice. The ipw3945 chipset is working
fine with the ipw3945 driver on my simple wifi network at home; I haven't
tried the iwl driver nor have I gone out and about and tried to interface
with other wifi routers (and Metro-Fi hasn't lit up the AP they installed
right in front of my house). I also don't use NetworkManager as reports
from others have indicated that it introduces a lot of flakiness to wifi.
I was able to suspend to ram with 's2ram --force' and resume successfully
(though I had to manually switch back to the console and then back to X to
get my display back), but I've no idea how reliable it is. I have yet to
plug in the e1000 based ethernet port so I haven't verified that it works.

This T61 is quieter, cooler, and less power hungry than the T43 I was
using. According to powertop, it uses about 17W when unplugged with no
tuning on my part; my T43 would use about 24W. With the larger 9 cell
battery, I've been getting over 4 hours of battery life, versus barely
2 hours for the T43 with the 6 cell battery. The keyboard and mouse
buttons feel ever so marginally cheaper than the keys on the T43 to me,
but they still have a quality feel to them; I just wish Lenovo would
stop with the crazy wrist breaker left control key layout. In general,
the T series has been built with quality components, the T61 doesn't
feel like an exception.

All in all, I was very happy with my T43 and was sad to see it go. My
new T61 feels like a nice upgrade.

Hope this helps.

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu security issues
Message-ID: <47190500.7030506@alcpress.com>

This is related to the thread we had a few weeks ago
about ensuring that our servers are running the latest
versions of software so we'd be as secure as possible.

I have a computer running Ubuntu Server (Dapper - AMD
64-bit version). It's never been used in a production
capacity but will starting Monday. So, I did the usual
apt-get update and apt-get upgrade. I noticed that
openssl was one of the packages updated. So I did this:

# openssl
OpenSSL> version
OpenSSL 0.9.8a 11 Oct 2005

Thinking that something went wrong and I now have two
copies of openssl installed, I searched for all occurrences
of openssl. There was only one. Version 0.9.8a is ancient
- circa 2005. Version 0.9.8g was announced today.

Then I checked openssh. It was version 4.2p1 - another
2005 vintage program.

I realize that Dapper is not the latest Ubuntu but shouldn't
important programs like openssl and openssh be kept current
regardless?

Have you checked the patch levels of those packages? Just because the
version is older, doesn't mean security fixes weren't applied..

That's good to hear!  I'm using a 2.5 year old T42p, which I
absolutely love (my only complaint is that it doesn't do xinerama ;)
at least not w/out an expensive dock I just can't justify given it's
age...)

What's the resolution on the T61's sxga+ display?

sxga+ is 1400x1050. I haven't tried the external display either, so
I don't know whether xinerama will work. I know a friend of mine had
some difficulty setting up his x61 to output to an external monitor,
but he did eventually get it to work.

Unless Ubuntu had a better idea, there should also be a
Debian-specific changelog in /usr/share/doc/openssl. It contains
information about the patches the Debian package maintainers applied:

  $ zcat changelog.Debian.gz | head
  openssl (0.9.8c-4etch1) stable-security; urgency=low
  
    * CVE-2007-5135: Fix off by one error in SSL_get_shared_ciphers().
      (Closes: #444435)
    * Add nagios-nrpe-server, clamav-freshclam and clamav-daemon
      to the list of services to check for restart.
  
The "Closes: #nnnnnn" refers to a Debian bug report. If you really
want the gory details, you can look up bug reports at

My current (still kaput) laptop is a Compaq amd64 (single
core). When I bought it I originally ordered the R4000 model, which came
with a larger hard drive and a CD/DVD+- dual layer drive. However, it
also came with ATI video. HP gives you a 30-day no-questions-asked
return privilege. On the 27th day, after hours and hours spent on the
video without being able to get better than 1024 x 768 VESA (including
hours of assistance at my first Clinic), I returned it. Instead I
bought the older R3240 model that has nVidia video. When it arrived I
tried several distros, none of which gave me any better video, until I
put an Ubuntu Hoary amd64 CD in the drive. The 1680 x 1050 video was so
stunning that I became an Ubuntu convert on the spot. Since then I have
occasionally tried other distros, but Ubuntu has won my heart.

Top of my list of things I was looking for when I bought the R4000 was
Linux compatibility, and people on the R3000 e-list indicated that they
didn't have any problems with their R3000 series laptops, so that is
one of the reasons I chose it. It was also cheap considering the
features. But the question, "what's your answers to these for your last
laptop?" isn't completely germane now. For example, it was my first
laptop, and now I'm going to check the weight of whatever I buy next.
I'm tired of schlepping its 10 lbs to PSU and back. I also know a lot
more about Linux and compatibility issues. I won't be getting a laptop
with a Broadcom wireless chip, even though I now know how to fix it
with ndiswrapper. And technology has advanced considerably - now I want
a Core 2 CPU and a SATA hard disk that's big enough to allow me 15 GB
for a Virtualbox guest OS and still have gobs of space for music and
linguistics stuff. And I also want something that has a good reputation
for quality and ruggedness. I don't know how many hours I've spent
fixing corruption on the hard disk because of the flaky connector and
learning how to replace keyboards, RAM sticks and hard drives.

That's a good idea. Thanks for the suggestion.

After posting my question this morning it turns out I had to go to
Jantzen Beach. While there I went to CompUSA, Circuit City, Staples and
Office Depot. Closest to the T61 that I found was a retired demo model
of a T60 at Circuit City that was sitting in a cabinet down under the
display. They also had an identical one that was a customer return.
However, the demo was missing its battery, the other one had a dead
battery, and the clerk couldn't find the power brick for either one.
But at least I got to see the physical layout and it looked acceptable.

I also discovered a store locater page at lenovo.com, and evidently
Computek at 16th and Jefferson is a Lenovo laptop dealer. I called them
and they have a T61 on display. They're open 9-5 and 10-3 Saturday, so
maybe I'll swing by to check it out.

I still haven't given up on the Dell laptops, but I won't be getting
one of their Linux laptops because they are not adequate. 

Thanks to everyone for the responses.

Sounds about right.

I don't entirely understand what you mean by that, but have you checked
inside to make sure there aren't any stray bits of paper, toner leaks or
gummed-up rollers?

Only if you do it yourself.  And you can get a new Samsung for like $100.

Free Geek.  And you could check their thriftstore for another printer.

Parts are still available for most decent printers (even the old
ones). fixyourownprinter.com is a good place to start. You can usually
find repair kits on eBay, too. A typical overhaul kit is usually ~$50.

The $100 Samsung printers are crap, especially compared to an older HP
boat anchor Laserjet.

Howdy.  

I've been remiss in announcing these, but Keith was kind enough to
remind me at last night's (delightful) Oliver Sacks lecture.

Our monthly Linux Clinic at Free Geek is this Sunday, October 21, from
1PM to 5PM.  The address is 1731 SE 10th Ave, enter through the south door.

Bring your misbehaving computer equipment and we will do our best to
help make it behave.  (Warning: We may help it to fail consistently,
rather than intermittnetly.)

We will have CDs and DVDs of Ubuntu 7.10 as well as many other distros,
WiFi and wired internet access, refreshments and coffee, monitors and
keyboards, CD-ROM drives and sledgehammers all available, as needed.

We have a few spare parts, but the thriftstore will NOT be open, so
please plan ahead.  I can sometimes pick up items like HDDs or CD-RW
drives Saturday if you let me know in advance.

Share and enjoy,
  Aaron

Message-ID: <20071019223201.GA29828@gate.kl-ic.com>


I am running a RHEL clone, and occasionally I download a source tarball
and compile and install it.  I would prefer to manage the new files
with RPM, so I would like to build an RPM, and install from that - if
it is easy.  Most source packages use GNU automake, with the usual
mantra "./configure, make, make install", so I expect there is an
automagic tool to build RPMs from such source packages (also DEBs
for our Ubuntu buddies). 

Any suggested tools for the Compleat Idiott?

Dan,

   I just finished upgrading my wife's ThinkPad 600E to xubunutu-7.10, and
there's still no wireless networking. Haven't tested sound or anything else
-- including getting pilot-link working on a USB cradle.

   So, I'll be there tomorrow with the laptop and would appreciate
distribution expertise to get these last couple of items working properly.
I'll bring two pcmcia wifi cards: the Orinoco Gold that worked flawlessly
with Slackware and an AirLink101 MIMO XR model AWLC5025

   It came back up with no route, but the 'route add ...' didn't work; it
wanted inet_route instead. Still no joy.

   See you all tomorrow.

Keith,

   When I ran Red Hat I used 'checkinstall' instead of 'make install.' It
made Red Hat, Debian, and Slackware packages with the user choosing which
one. My Slackware installations had the same tool, but specific to making
Slackware packages. Now I use the appropriate .SlackBuild script, but
checkinstall should still be available and working for your needs.

The "checkinstall" utility sounds exactly like what you're looking for.

Sometimes, there's also a configure or make option to make an RPM, or
even a current .spec file in the tarball.  In ideal cases, you can just
do an "rpmbuild -tb blah.tar.gz".

You might want to take a look at the package name before calling it buggy.
I just found this and it looks like all the patches have been applied
to the old version
but leaving it with the old version tags.

I won't know this for a while (see the following story).

lenovo.com/ibmspp

Use 536686 as the access code. Look for discount codes on
techbargains.com or other deal sites. You can usually stack them with
the ibmspp login.

Of course, 'best' is subjective...

> Is it possible to find one in a store in Portland to look at?

I don't know. Probably, but it will have options you don't want, or
won't have options you want, or both.

> Which distro/architecture do you use on it? Issues?

Ubuntu on the T61 is well-documented, and seems well-supported. I'll be
running kubuntu, probably.

> Any other comments also welcome. 

I ordered it on 9/29, and they told me that it would ship on 10/18. I
ordered a wifi hotspot finder at the same time and that arrived in a
week, so I thought that while nearly 3 weeks seemed like a long time, it
wasn't too bad.

Since they sent me an email when the wifi gadget shipped I expected one
of those for the laptop, and I've been hopeful that it would ship early.
Of course you've guessed by now that it didn't.

This morning I got up early to prepare for a meeting and checked my
email, expecting that there would be a shipping notice. Not there. So I
checked the Lenovo order status page for my order. The shipping date is
now 11/20, about 7 weeks after my order date. OK, things get delayed.
But a MONTH? And they didn't know about it until the day they promised
to ship it? What good is the order status page if it's not kept up to
date?

Of course it's not easy to contact them about an order and what options
do I have anyway, other than wait for it or cancel the order?  It's not
like I can tell them "ship it now or else!"

So while I'm looking forward to getting it and I haven't heard from
anyone who wasn't thrilled with their T61, I'm a little  disappointed in
Lenovo right now.

MY T42p is fantastic in every imaginable way except
that it has a bios lock to the firmware on the hard
drive, making upgrading a royal pain in the a$$.
Battery life is almost 5 hours per charge, and I have
2 batteries which make it so I can run all day without
having to plug in. 
Mine has a 15" wxga screen fwiw, and those times are
as reported by winblows.  I havent timed it when
running linux, thats done plugged in at home. =)

John/Kurt:

   What do the T42p and T61 weigh? I'm curious because a) the 600E is about
7 pounds and b) weight is a critical factor for me. I spent too many years
lugging a heavy (i.e., 7 pounds) laptop through airports and around
conventions. One of the Toshiba Portege 3025 features that was terrific was
the weight: 1 kg. My Sony Vaio weighs twice that and the difference becomes
apparent toward the end of the day of carrying it.

I purchased a T61 in August to replace my HP nc6220.  The HP was great, but was
only a 1.8GHz P-M, and we're doing a lot more with Xen, so I wanted an HVM
capable proc for testing.  Mind you the feisty xen kernel didn't support the
ipw3945 simultaneously (and why would it being a server kernel).

I opted for the Intel video chipset.  I've had awesome luck with nvidia drivers
on my desktop, but believe Intel is better at supporting open source software
than nvidia, and feared there could be a chance of getting a new nvidia mobile
chipset that wasn't supported.

The T61 hardware was a bit too new for Feisty.  Sound didn't work, hibernate
didn't work, and ctrl-F(x) for a text console didn't work.

I'm happy to report that with Gusty, everything is working nicely.  Though I was
a bit surprised that compiz/beryl doesn't work.  Sure I expected crappy 3d
support form the Intel card, but not nothing. :)  No big loss though, it would
have been neat but not functional for me.

Noticeable physical differences between the HP and the Lenovo:
 * HP has a standard desktop keyboard ctrl-alt placement, the lenovo's are
closer together (IBM used to boycott the windows key too.. but this Lenovo now
has it)
 * The LCD is much cooler (in color temp) than the HP, which you just get used
to, but side to side is quite noticeable.  I use greys and blues in my theme
anyway, so I guess I'm cool color-temp kind of person. :)  Compared to my
viewsonic 19" LCD at home laptop LCD's just suck.
 * For the pointer-mouse users like me, Lenovo provides 3 mouse buttons.  The HP
had a pointer-mouse but only two (trackpad on both have only 2).

I have the fingerprint reader but haven't tried to use it (I've been using
dm-crypt on /home since it was available with much success).

My last laptop was an A30 Thinkpad that I bought refurbished on EBay I
looked specifically for a 1440x1050 display, it had a 30GB disk and an
ATI display controller all well supported, though I did have to did a
little have some trouble with one ubuntu upgrade and the ATI. This
spring when I decided it was time to get a new laptop I when to Lenovo
and ordered a new one T60, Dual core Duo, 2 GB memory 160GB disk, the
Intel display controller, the Intel Wireless, 1680x1050 (I'd like more
pixels), bigger battery.  I run ubuntu and this hardware is well
supported, I assume the T61 has similar options.

My wifi wasn't working with 7.10, either, despite the card being 
detected OK.  Finally figured out there was no network start script in 
any /etc/rc?.d!

That's *one* possible clue that a vendor has released a "patched"  
version, as compared to a "newer release version", uhm... version...

OpenSSL (indeed, most projects) do not release tons of versions with  
custom tags like '-7ubuntu0.4'.

Vendors are at their discretion to patch based on their philosophy,  
whether dependancies will create more nightmares, etc.

This can present an issue similar to the following Scenario:
A F/OSS project issues foo-1.0.a
A distro then includes foo-1.0.a
-A major security flaw is found in foo-1.0.a
-A patch is released by the project (not distro), foo-1.0.b
-Another patch is released by the project (not distro), foo-1.0.c,  
which eliminates the need for the prior patch.... by totally changing  
the default behavior of foo, thus possibly altering an unknown number  
of other packages and user compiled binaries.

What's a distro to do?
Update all update/release code to the .c version, possibly breaking  
many more things in the process?
Merge patches between .b and .c, based on the distro's philosophy and  
expansive testing?
Only keep the .b patches and features, to simply preserve back  
compatibility?

Different distros can (and do) do very different things with this  
problem.

A happy update to my saga; I just got an email saying that my order has
shipped. They still need to fix their status reporting, but at least
it's shipping close to the predicted date. Tomorrow I find out whether
it shipping from China or from somewhere in the US.

When mine shipped (a T42 two years ago), I got the most amusing UPS
tracking information.  It left Hong Kong and went to Japan, then LA,
then Alaska, then who knows where.  Before it even showed as in
Portland, they had already delivered it.  Or something.  I may have
the details wrong, but the incoherence of the data I *do* remember.
UPS tracking is horrible.

Anyway, I love my T42.  I have the 1400x1050 display.  I wouldn't want
the wide screen version, as the size tradeoff doesn't seem worth it.
My wife just took a nice looking T60 on a business trip.  The X-series
ThinkPads I'd consider too.  No DVD/CD player, but lightweight!

Thanks to you and others for the comments. I thought this would become
an off-list discussion, but it appears the Lenovo T61 is of general
interest.

About 4:00 today I stopped at Computek, which is a short walk from
PSU, where I needed to go anyway. I spoke there with a fine gentleman
who showed me a sealed box with a T61 inside, and he provided me with
the written specs for it, and a price of $1500. He said he sells
hundreds of Thinkpads to large business customers. After talking with
him for 15 minutes it became apparent that if I am going to buy one
from a local person, he is the man with the knowledge to do a good job
of selling a Lenovo.

The specs on it are:

Core 2 Duo 2 GHz
160 GB HD 5400 rpm SATA (I or II is unclear)
Intel PM965 chipset
15.4" widescreen 1680 x 1050, up to 2048 x 1536 externally
1 GB RAM (he said he can add more)
DVD+- dual layer 24X
800 MHz bus speed
1.56 Kg (with/without battery?)
nVidvia NB8M-GS
Intel wireless 4965AGN
Gigabit ethernet
Bluetooth
Three years warranty
Windows XP Professional

It all looks like what I want, except I want 2 GB RAM.

I went to lenovo.com and put all these specs into the Customize window.
It came to $1473 with free shipping. Considering the stories in this
thread regarding shipping time, the $27 is worth it, plus I'd be
supporting a local merchant. And the Lenovo site gives me one year
warranty; he gives me three years.

I'd like to find out if the hard drive is SATA 150 or SATA 300 (he
didn't know, and I can't find out anything on the Lenovo site). And on
the Lenovo site there is an option for a 1 GB disk cache, which this
computer doesn't seem to have. I wonder if it can be added, because I
want a fast hard drive. It might make up for the fact that the drive is
only 5400 rpm.

Methinks the gentleman is close to making a sale.

The chipset should support SATA 300.  Don't know about the drive,
perhaps see if you can get the actual drive model.  I'd be surprised
if they're hooking up a SATA 150 drive to a SATA 300 port.

The 1GB "cache" is Intel Turbo Memory, which is not a cache in the
same sense as a traditional hard drive cache.  See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Turbo_Memory.  I don't think Linux
is currently supported (or XP, for that matter), only Vista at the
moment since it uses ReadyBoost.

> Methinks the gentleman is close to making a sale.

My wife has a T61, overall it seems to continue the long line of
Thinkpad T-series goodness.  All of the problems we've had with it can
be traced to XP, not the hardware.  BTW, if you can get it, the
extended battery is quite nice.

Rich, Aaron, thanks!  checkinstall worked semi-perfectly.  I ran it first
on a build on system A, and it tried to include some extraneous files in
the RPM file (I suspect something else was simultaneously doing some kind
of update on A).  So I ran checkinstall on system B, and that built an
RPM file that works on both system A and system B.  Someday I will learn
the "proper" way to exclude extraneous files, but I got the job done.  

RPM normally keeps track of dependencies;  I wonder if the RPMs I am
building may fail on some versions of the distro with different packages
installed.  Perhaps I should do these builds on a minimal install inside
a virtual machine,  to keep track of the dependencies.

BTW, I used this to build 4.2.2 gnuplot, which is a great improvement on
the 4.0.0 that shipped with my distribution (Scientific Linux 5, a clone
of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5).  The RPM (which does not use libpdf and
does not provide direct PDF generation) is at:

I must work too closely to the cable industry.  Comcast has deployed their
Sandvine solution.  I knew this was coming last year.  Time-Warner is
deploying Sandvine as well, although their architecture is very different.

Adelphia had Sandvine deployed.  I will bet that Charter is deploying
Sandvine as well.

This really only applies to file sharing applications, although Sandvine
will also allow you to mitigate virus traffic as well.  Usually the way
Sandvine is deployed is it tries to force file sharing applications to
prefer other filesharers who are on the same network, in an effort to lower
outbound traffic costs.

   The folks at the Ubuntu party had no idea why the wireless networking on
the ThinkPad 600E wasn't working. It showed the same symptoms I experienced
last business trip with the Sony: ifconfig showed the network running,
iwconfig showed the wireless card connecting to the access point, iwlist
scan showed all the nodes, but no IP address and no connection anywhere.

   So, I'll be at tomorrow's clinic and hope that you wireless gurus can help
me get wireless networking on this laptop working. The installed
distribution is Xubuntu-7.10.

Bill,

   The laptop has a static IP address on the local network, and dhcpcd was
not installed. I could not connect to the local network which it used to do
when booted. I'll have dhcpcd installed before the clinic tomorrow.

I will be interested in knowing what the solution is when you find it.  
I am having the same issue with an HP laptop in Gnome.  It worked 
perfectly with Feisty, but is having issues with a fresh (beta) install.

Bruce,

   I'll be happy to provide the information. This machine and the Orinoco
Gold card worked fine with Red Hat and Slackware, but I was going bonkers
getting the sound to work ... and continue to work on successive boots. So,
I switched to Xubuntu-7.04 (feisty). Everything but wireless networking
worked. Having been told that the upgrade to -7.10 (grumpy) fixed this issue
for others, I was hopeful that it would for us, too. But, ... the saga
continues.

Rich,
That seems to be the holdup. From your description of the symptoms
this does not seem to be a wireless problem. I expect this would
happen with a wire also, but I don't think the 600e has built-in wired
so you can't test it.  Going into a coffee shop and connecting to some
random network you don't know what static ip address to choose or what
gateway to use, it helps to use dhcp.
I use this configuration in /etc/network/interfaces

iface wlan0 inet dhcp
        wireless-essid any

When I want to use the wireless I bring up the interface with
ifup wlan0

If there are competing wireless access points around I add another
interface for the one I want

iface belkin inet dhcp
        wireless-essid belkin54g

and bring up the interface with
ifup wlan0=belkin

There are fancier ways of doing this, but this works well for me.

Bill

Look forward to seeing you.  Note that many wifi installations start up
with an authentication web splash page - you must enter some information
through a web browser (sometimes a user name, sometimes just an "I agree
to the terms of service" click) before they will let you connect elsewhere.
That is true at the airport, with Metrofi, and with PTP and NoCat sites
(like Free Geek).  I imagine that might be a problem if your laptop is
configured to do its own DNS service, and can't make the first connection
to the TLD servers.

Message-ID: <20071021041033.GA10042@merlot.com>

I have a Dell C640, and it has run Linux all its life. It is currently
running Kubuntu 7.04 (partly because the upgrade to 7.10 fails). 

For the last week, if I shut it down and restart it, I can't log in.
The 't' and 'y' keys don't work, the tab key doesn't work, and I can't
get uppercase to save my life (this is the one that prevents me from
logging in). All other keys seem to work fine.

If I boot a rescue disk and mount the root partition (this can be tricky
when the 't' is unavailable) and reboot, the keys are back to normal.
Originally I chrooted that partition and reset the passwords for my
account and root, but that turns out to be unnecessary; all it needs is
to be mounted.

I tried 'ls -lt /etc' and nothing stands out. Any suggestions?

Thanks.

Bill,

   The 600E works just fine on a wired ethernet connection. That was the
interim solution when wireless stopped working with the installation of
feisty.

   What I discovered later yesterday was that the laptop has dhclient on it
rather than dhcpcd. Perhaps that's what it needs when in a different
location (and I'll test that today at the clinic), but it does not explain
why it won't connect wirelessly here with the same static IP address it's
had since we got it.

   She doesn't take the laptop to other locations to connect wirelessly, but
perfers to use it from the den here rather than at the office desk with the
wired connection. _That's_ the need to be met: how to get Xubuntu-7.10
wireless networking functioning here on the local network.

   True. I'm used to using dhcpcd, and that's not on the Xubuntu
installation. As I noted in my response to Bill's message, I discovered
dhclient on the box, and that may work the same way.

   Our need is to be able to use the wireless connection here in the house,
with a static IP address, just as we have before. But, if we can get
wireless networking functioning using dhclient, accepting TLD splash page
terms, and whatever from a remote location, the probability of it working
here is very much greater.

Kurt,

   Last week most of the right side of my workstation/server keyboard stopped
functioning. Totally dead, but it would print the ASCII ESC sequences for
some of them. The [Enter] key didn't work so I could not kill the X server
that way, nor could I using ctrl-alt-bksp. Thought the keyboard died like a
previous one (and the one on the ThinkPad) did.

   I logged in from my notebook and killed the xinit session. I tested each
key on the right side of the keyboard, row by row, and discovered that the
non-functioning ones were on the embedded number pad. Pressing the Fn key
made no difference. None of the special key lights were on: no caps lock, no
num lock, no scroll lock. But, I pressed the scroll lock key several times
anyway. No indicator light at all, but that fixed the problem here.

   Don't know if your Dell is suffering a mechanical/electrical glitch like
my keyboard, but it's worth a try to see.

Looks like mine is getting a similar vacation. It started in China,
visited a couple cities there, went to Ontario, California, and now it's

That's odd -- or maybe my shipping experience was odd -- when I
ordered my T42p, it shipped from Kowloon bay to NYC (stopping off in
California) in about a week -- by UPS _ground_.  I think it actually
arrived before the estimated shipping date.

Does this happen only at the X login screen? Have you tried switching to
a text-terminal (CTRL-ALT-F1) or booting into runlevel 3, which does not
start X? (if using grub, edit the kernel line and add a '3' at the end)

Have you tried powering it down fully or just done warm reboots? Have
you pulled the battery to make it (almost) really dead?

Have you tried an external, perhaps USB, keyboard?

I was following the recent security thread and it got me wondering. What do
other pluggers do to secure their systems? Is just upgraded packages as they
come out enough for you? Do you have crazy IPTables rules, maybe snort,
Bastille or Tripwire?

I'm a huge fan of LCAP http://www.securityfocus.com/tools/882 which I think
I've mentioned here before briefly. I remove the ability to change files
once I've marked them immutable which at times has been a pain but I think
its a worthwhile trade off for the security it offers. If $badguy does
manage to get in they aren't able to compromise most of the system files or
binaries that I find most important (i.e ssh, named)

So Pluggers what do you do?

   SOHO here. I use a Netgear firewall appliance and turn on only those
services that are absolutely needed. I also install all distribution
upgrades for packages I have installed. SSH allows only named users to
remotely log in; root's not one of them. Telnet is disabled. There may be
more, but the rest are not immediately recalled.

I have tried a text login. Same results.

Yes, I have removed all power sources, several times. It makes no
difference.

I cannot imagine how a physical keyboard issue could be resolved by
mounting a disk partition. I have not tried another keyboard for this
reason. I guess the keyboard chip could be getting initialized
improperly, but that's still not a keyboard issue.

Thanks for the ideas; keep 'em coming!

Kurt,

   Have you tried a live cd with a different distribution on it? Knoppix?
Slax? Something else?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0710211828480.12414@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I know that folks have been waiting breathlessly for the next episode to
learn whether Lassie is able to drag Tommy out of the raging floodwaters
along the curb by grabbing his ear. So, without further ado, or ads from our
sponsors, here's tonight's episode ...

   Recently I bought a LinkSys WRT54GC mini-router. It accommodates wireless
and four wired connections to the 'Net. This evening I took it out and
plugged in the cat5 cable from our firewall/router to one of the ethernet
(not Internet) ports. Now, wireless connection from the ThinkPad works! And,
from the den in the back of the house, too.

   So, something must have gone bad with the LinkSys WAP that had been
working just fine until I changed distributions on the ThinkPad. I don't
know how to troubleshoot that unit, or if it's worth the effort. Perhaps the
most parsimonious solution is to buy another WRT54GC and use it locally.
Apparently I don't even need the additional, external antenna on it.

   Might be a coincidence that the hardware failed at the time of the
software upgrade, but that's apparently what happened.

   Thanks to everyone (Kurt, Russell, Keith, Bill) for ideas and direct help.

Have you updated the firmware in your old Linksys recently.  At one 
point, my Linksys BEFW1154 stopped getting an address from the cable 
company, just would not do it. I figured the cable company did something 
bad so I called them, went through the trouble shooting steps of 
connecting a PC directly to the cable modem.  Guess what that got an 
address, the guy on the phone said to update the firmware on the 
Linksys.  Sure enough, that fixed it.  I really hate it when the cable 
company is right.

The radio on the BEFW1154 finally wore out, got weaker and weaker to the 
point I couldn't go out on the deck to work.  Bought a new WRT54G and 
life is good.  Still have the old guy as the firewall with the radio 
turned off.

   Don't know that I can. This is a WAP56G access point that no longer
accesses.

Xen has 2 modes for guests: paravirtualized and fully-virtualized (aka
HVM). So it is correct to say you can run an unpatched OS under Xen with
VT, but it is not running paravirtualized, it's in HVM mode.

> Without hardware support for

Well you *can* but it's really hard, which is why VMWare were really the
only ones who had it working well before VT and SVM were introduced. Now
everyone's doing it because proper CPU support makes it so much easier :)

> VT will give you a performance boost over full hardware abstraction,

Xen HVM guests are not particularly fast, because VT lets Xen fully
virtualize the CPU, but device accesses require emulation and are slow,
most notably network and block accesses. This is the problem that PV
guest drivers like "VMWare Tools" fix -- the OS is unmodified, but
things are sped up by adding some drivers that know how to send data to
the hypervisor directly instead of simulating hardware for the OS's
existing drivers to talk to. Xen also has these -- but only for Linux.
Virtual Iron and others sell PV guest drivers for Windows as part of
their added value.

So:
* VMWare: doesn't need VT, virtualizes any OS the hard way, has PV
drivers, $$$
* Xen: doesn't need VT, can only run on modified OSes, has PV drivers
* Xen HVM: requires VT, virtualizes any OS the easy way, has PV drivers
only for Linux (VI, Novell, XenSource sell Win PV drivers for $$$)

new T61 with 64-bit Gutsy. If anyone is thinking of a new computer,
this is the one to get. Thanks to everyone at the Clinic for watching,

I'm lax.  I just use a distro that's recent enough that security patches
are kept current, and do an apt-get upgrade whenever I get around to it.
I use Ubuntu so there's no root password.  I try to make sure the rest
of the accounts have good passwords.  

No firewall to speak of.  No snort or tripwire.  I should do all three,
just to keep in practice, but it seems like I only have time to work,
eat, sleep and do minimal husbandly duties.

Looks very interesting!  It's a shame folks find SELinux so cumbersome.
It seems like a very valuable tool, if folks were used to using it.

If you can get into a working X session, see what keyboard layout you have 
defined.  It may have gotten set to some weird non-standard layout.  I am 
not certain where the default keyboard layout is kept.  It has been a long 
time since I have had to change it by hand.  (Not in this century, at 
least...

In Fedora Core 6 it is in /etc/sysconfig/keyboard.  Not certain where 
Ubuntu has it.  (If they can't leave the init level numbers alone, who 
knows what else they muck with.)

In Fedora Core 6 it is in /etc/sysconfig/keyboard.  Not certain where 
Ubuntu has it.  (If they can't leave the init level numbers alone, who 
knows what else they muck with.)

Once (and exactly once) I was able to log in at KDM but typing in an
xterm showed the same key problems. Normally the problem manifested at
boot and I couldn't get past the login prompt or dialog.

Is the keymap loaded when the partition is mounted? That's when the
problem goes away, after I boot into other than the installed OS. I don't
think that's the case, so I haven't checked the keymap. I guess I
should, for completeness.

Thanks.

I think everything defaults to the system keymap.  If that is bjorked, 
then the who system will display the same behavior.

If you load a different OS, it will have a different keymap.

But if the system keymap (or any other keymap) is hosed, wouldn't it
always be hosed? Why would that get better after mounting the root
partition?

Every OS I've booted in the last week has had the "missing 't'" problem
at one time or another, but not consistently. This suggests that the
keymap is not the problem, assuming that any live CD I booted does in
fact have a different keymap, and I think that's a very safe assumption.

For the record, I've tried the following live CDs:

xubuntu 7.04	- yes, this probably has the same keymap
DSL 3.4.4	- 2.4 kernel
CentOS 5 cd#1	- I expect RH uses a different keymap
'ESD'		- someone's custom rescue CD, slackware-based

Am I missing something obvious here?

Thanks.

If it happens with everything, then it is not software.

For the moment i would get a USB keyboard.  It sounds like your keyboard 
is coming unplugged or going bad.

I guess you missed the part about the keys working again after the
root partition is mounted, no matter what OS is booted? I'd say that
proves that it's not hardware. I could be wrong, but I haven't seen a
hardware-related explanation that fits the behavior I described.

After my new laptop arrives (UPS says it's in Kentucky now, hopefully it
will head west soon) I'll spend some time playing with stuff that
doesn't seem logical to me, but in the meantime, I have work to do.

Thanks.

It does not make sense to me either.  (Unless there is some setting in 
initrd or the kernel options that is getting overridden when the main 
partition gets mounted.)

Is anyone else seeing a ton of ssh attacks? I've gotten 2500 login
attempts (I'm not counting the 37 connections that sent no
identification) in the last 24 hours. That's over 10 times the 'normal'
attack level for this box.

BTW, I'm using BlockHosts (http://www.aczoom.com/cms/blockhosts) and
it's very nice. I think I saw someone on this list mention it, so thanks

Yeah. I'm seeing a LOT of failed attempts for user 'mysql'; I wonder 
if some distro or app installed MySQL in a way that renders its user 
account open for easy logins?

Fedora, in the rpmdevtools package, has a rpmdev-newspec program that
generates a spec file.  The default "minimal" template is suitable for
pakcages that do the configure; make; make install dance.  You get to
fill in the version, source files, requirements, and installed file
locations.  I think rpmdevtools is also available for Centos.

Plesk uses the same password for root and mysql admin by default.

You definitely want to use build roots when building RPMs to keep from
polluting your installation and to allow building as a user not root.
rpmbuild will complain if there are files in the buildroot that aren't
listed in the %files section.

RPM automatically finds dependencies on shared libraries.  It also
finds binaries called by scripts.  Other dependencies have to be added
manually with Requires lines in the spec.

The other thing you need to worry about are BuildRequires.  These are
requirements for building a package.  These can be tricky because a
development machine will have lots of packages installed that won't be
on a clean machine.  Fedora and Centos developers use mock for
building packages inside a chroot.  This also allows building for
different distributions.

I bought a T61 a few months ago, and have been enjoying it quite a  
lot. I dual boot XP and Ubuntu, use both a fair amount.
Besides some minor issues in Ubuntu, everything works as it should,  
though the laptop does sometimes fail to come out of Standby mode in  
both Windows and Ubuntu.
Haven't quite figured out why Standby is such an issue, IBM support  
wont help me since I removed Vista, sadly...

I have been reading about problems with the T61. You might find
something useful about suspend and resume here:

http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Install_Ubuntu_Gutsy_Gibbon_on_a_T61p

The reason I have been reading about problems is that I spoke to soon
when I wrote the above. That is, I'm having problems with the video. I
posted about it on Ubuntu this morning, but haven't had a response yet:

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3601701#post3601701

At the moment I am running at 1680 x 1050, but keeping it there is a
problem. Plus, the Preferences > Appearances window appears to let me
change the color of the desktop background, but when I click to change
it nothing happens. I'm stuck with Ubuntu default titty-pink-brown.
That might be a nice color in some contexts, but not on my desktop,
thank you.

If anyone here has a T61 with my video ["01:00.0 VGA compatible
controller: nVidia Corporation Quadro NVS 140M (rev a1)"], and if you
have it running reliably at 1680 x 1050, I'd appreciate a copy of your
xorg.conf file to compare to mine.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0710221548510.19972@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   Different portable, similar problem. My Sony is normally connected to the
local network via a cat5 cable on eth0. Since I got the ThinkPad working
with the LinkSys compact router, I decided to try the wireless card on the
Sony. It works at other locations, and it's worked here before. But, now
it's being recalcitrant.

   eth1 comes up when I boot with the wireless card inserted; I can also take
it out, plug in the cat5 cable, connect to the LAN, reverse the process and
the interface comes back up. iwconfig shows it running; iwconfig shows me
the specs on the access point, including the AP's MAC address and the link
quality of 225/0.

   However, 'host unreachable' when I try pinging another host.

   'route' (or netstat -r) shows me a localnet route for eth1, but there's no
default route. So I run 'route add default gw 192.168.55.4 eth1' and there's
a default route on that interface, too. Still can't ping.

   What have I missed here, or what step should I take to figure out why it's
not connecting? Obviously, /etc/resolv.conf is the same regardless of the
interface and connection via cat5 or air.

Avoid version x.uh-oh and use a mature distribution like openSUSE 
where the x.3 is the usual candidate and 10.3 just came out.

Check the openSUSE mail lists for any threads on user problems with 
the recent release and patches.

Download and burn a CDs or a DVD with 10.3

Partition a non-networked, non-production server and install 10.3

Play, follow your curiosity and learn.

Try various install scenarios and finally, do a custom install with 
only the necessary packages.

Backup to a USB drive or CD if you're broke.

Connect to the network and then to the Internet through a firewall.

Configure the firewall to only use ports for services which you choose.

Configure the firewall to use NAT and DHCP.

Install appropriate patches and upgrades.

Reality is not digital.  A keyboard is accessed differently during
some operating states than others, and a flaky keyboard (or hard
drive, or power supply, or ...) may fail under some conditions and
not others, because of voltage changes, timing changes, etc.  
Keyboards fail like analog devices, not digital ones, and it is
inevitable that they fail first under a subset of all conditions.

Without good builtin hardware and software diagnostics, differential
diagnosis is the only option - performing a series of experiments with one
thing changed.  Diagnose software problems by swapping software (if you
are allowed to ... yay, Linux!), and diagnose hardware problems by swapping
hardware.  An external keyboard (USB or PS/2) is a good way to take a lot
of potentially flaky keyboard hardware (and some software) out of the
picture.  A live CD is a way to swap software.  Moving the disk hard
drive to another, similar laptop is a way to take most of the hardware
out of the picture.  A diagnosis is built from these observations. 

If your diagnosis starts with a lot of assumptions, repair becomes
much harder, because you are testing not only hardware and software but
also the assumptions.  Even the people that design this stuff make too
many assumptions (which is one of the reasons things fail), and your
assumptions can only be less reliable than the deisgners.  So try to
discard as many assumptions as possible, and follow the experimental
data instead.

I have seen keyboards fail mechanically A LOT ( just a little corrosion
can make a keyboard intermittent and timing dependent ) and I have seen
a keyboard controller chip fail twice.  I keep spare keyboards around
for just that reason - they are the most likely component to fail.
Fortunately, keyboards can be removed from most laptops by removing two
or three screws.   And once they are pulled, you can look horizontally
through them at a bright light, and see the jungle of garbage that
collects beneath the keys.  It makes you wonder how they ever work at
all.  A complete disassembly and careful cleaning can sometimes bring
keyboards back to life, but most laptop keyboards are hard to rebuild.

Yes, clever software can be amazingly tolerant of flaky hardware.
Chances are, whoever wrote the software you are using does not have
access to the vast collection of flaky hardware necessary to write
fiendishly clever fault-tolerant software.  So you are stuck with 
software that works /almost/ all the time.  

So - try an external keyboard, first.  Try booting from a Live CD,
next.  If the problem is fixed by an external keyboard, it is most
likely the keyboard hardware, or the connection cable, or the 
keyboard scanner chip.  Once you do get the machine working, keep
the old keyboard for experimentation, and delve into the keyboard
scan software if you have the skills for it.  You just might be
able to make that software a little more fault tolerant.

Keith

P.S. - you can watch the keycodes coming off the keyboard with the
program "xev".  That drags information out of the event pipe before
it is processed by keyboard maps, and is good for software diagnostics. 
You can (somewhat indirectly) launch programs like that through a
remote connection - if the display or keyboard or mouse is out, you
can still diagnose your flaky system from another one.

Dchp was invented so you would not have to muck around with these
problems. The best way to solve this type of problem is to reduce it
to simpler problems. Turn off your encryption and use dhcp network
configuration. If that works add back the encryption and if you really
must, add back your static network configuration.

Doesn't seem to be the case:

Call me a genius if you want.  I won't argue.  But here is your
problem.  You have two interfaces on the same network.  Your packets
are going out the wrong one.  Anyway, that's my guess.  It happens to
me from time to time, leading to momentary confusion.  When you
disconnect your wired connection, type this (assuming eth0 is your
wired interface):

  ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0 down

then configure your wireless interface:

  iwconfig eth1 essid foo
  ifconfig eth1 ...
  route add default via ...

Just try to tell me that isn't your problem.  I dare you!

Aw, geez... it really depends on the box, but, well, here some of the  
requirements for the *really* secure (and yet, publicly networked)  
boxen I've worked on in the last few years.

Disable un-needed services.
Delete un-needed accounts and access (uh, "root"? logging in? from  
*anywhere* but console? hell no.).
Custom written IPtables, of course (Bastille? no thanks.)
All inbound and outbound traffic monitored on a switch's mirror port,  
by additional dedicated, no public access, policy monitoring boxen  
(think snort, if it was paranoid on meth... )
Write *all* disk changes locally, and to a remote (encrypted tunnels  
are good!) write-only logging device.
Audit *all* new code changes at the source level, as pre-built  
binaries are not to be trusted. (yes, this means source code auditing  
of every fricking package, every upgrade, yay.)
Web-cam at console, writing to a remote (encrypted tunnels are good!)  
write only device.
SELinux tuned to the gills, of course.
Oh, and drives are encrypted (again, of course)
At least two biometric measures (retina, hand) to get to console.
At least one physical measure (think rotating keys) to log in as root.
...and a few shelves worth of binders on policy, procedure, etc.,  
with dedicated staffers monitoring every logged action on the box.

For machines that *aren't* quite that delicate, (pretty much "most  
every machine on this planet that has hard drives worth less than a  
million dollars each"), I dial it down a notch. ;)
Minimize installed binaries, accounts and services.
Keep binaries up to date.
Custom iptables + SELinux.
no ssh root access, apf/bfd instead.
Nagios for service monitoring.
Perimeter/VPN firewall boxen as needed.

Not a really great way I think, particularly now that macs do zip 
natively.  You can download a trial of the official stuff/unstuff for 
linux from the maker though:
ftp://ftp.allume.com/pub/archive/linux/StuffIt/stuffit520.611linux-i386.tgz

I believe you must pay for stuff but unstuff is free of cost, both seem 
to run on my gutsy amd64 machine.

You've always been a genius in my book, Russell.  How many times have
you bailed me out when I had lisp questions?  But I digress, for I've
had a few beers.  I just want to say that my money is on you ($10, $20
tops), because it's the classic "vpn into work and then hit a
wan-accessible work website and watch it choke" play.

Thanks. I couldn't find it at all, but now that I see it is proprietary

This is a case where they want something from me, not the other way

In my version of Adept (Kubuntu Feisty) she'd need to look at the lower right
corner of the window for the Apply Changes button.  There is no menu option
to use.

   Accurate guess. That's exactly what was happening.

   Nope, you're correct.

   Even though eth0 is not running, it has routes set up and the packets seem
to prefer it over eth1. All I did now was 'ifconfig eth0 down' and I can
ping other hosts from the notebook.

Many thanks for the lesson,

Top line from left: "Fetch updates" first, then select packages.  This ensures 
that the latest packages will be listed. Then "Preview Changes".  Shows what 
downloads your selections will cause.

Lastly, "Apply Changes".  This is the "go" button.

This is interesting.  My versions of Adept have never had "Apply Changes" button 
on the bottom, unless your doing automatic updates, in which case the full Adept 
screen is not present.

I decided to emulate the new user so my reply to Russell would be reasonably
accurate.  K-Menu -> Add/Remove Programs -> select a random item from the Adept
menu -> look for ways to kick off the installation.

I'll check which version I'm using tonight.

There is a Linux version of unstuffit.  It is pretty lame as archivers go. 
(Contrary to what they tell you on their web site.  For one thing, every 
other archiver will allow you to validate if an archive is complete and 
undamaged.)

Look on freshmeat.net.

Well, this approach is new to me.  I have never used K-Menu -> Add/Remove 
Programs.  I always use Adept from K-Menu -> System -> Adept.  Interesting 
interface.

(For the archives. I know I solved this problem with PLUG assistance,
but I can't find the solution in the archives. This entry should change
that.)

An annoyance of upgrading an otherwise working installation is that
things break. I had a working x10 program that talks to my x10
Powerhouse home automation controller. Since I ran the upgrade from
YaST, it no longer works. Here's the error message:

rsteff at Moonguide:~/Downloads/x10> x10 info
x10: can't open tty line

The x10 program uses a config file called x10config. A line in that file
reads:

TTY             /dev/ttyX10

In order for that to have any meaning, that needs to be a link to ttyS0.
It is created in /dev by typing:

Moonguide:/dev # ln ttyS0 ttyX10

Wow.  They *really* can't get your Lucky Charms.  Are you at liberty to
give some indication as to what was being protected, and from what sort
of attacker?  I especially like the filesystem logging.  I need to
practice the use of snapshot/replay on Linux.  It's not just for backups.

Excellent list.  Restricted SSH keys and sudo work very well, as does
Nagios, if you have a formal system to rotate on-call shifts between
admins.

Ever interfaced Nagios to your IDS?  Or does that just lead to lots of
false alarms?

In the vaguest of terms, discussing the idea: A threat detection and  
mitigation system, so if a new global threat or information leak  
(say, a 0-day IE bug, or a submarine's coordinates, or a reactor's  
design blueprints... whatever) kind of "dangerous traffic" is found  
or suspected at 11am, by midnight (or earlier) that same day, a  
trusted, tested, QA'd, remedy is put in place on a *massive* scale  
across some of the world's most sensitive systems (think TLA) to  
detect and trace the violation.

Summarized further, a system to ensure *hardcore* network security,  
in close to realtime. Not a whole lot of clients for it, but the  
clients who really did need it, would pay a lot for it. Think  
BEADWINDOW monitoring on ISO/OSI level 7.

> and from what sort of attacker?

The kind of attackers who would want to compromise hard drives  
actually worth thousands or a million dollars each, and sometimes,  
have the resources (or skill) to do so. Nations, organized crime,  
political entities, red-blue teams, and, of course, bored kids.... :)

Some of my code is running live at some of the sites here, to explain  
the scope of my more high-intensity work, and why I'm so focused on  
running secure systems at times.:

Yes, and Yes.

The zen of threats is that *all* threats are real. Some are more real  
than others.

Precisely. As an example, I have a neat PS/2 keyboard with a built-in
trackball that I got from the FreeGeek store. I use it with my MythTV
box. However, I could not get the trackball to work correctly, so I
connected it to a PS/2->USB adapter and it works just fine. Go figure!

I don't know that I have seen very many keyboards fail outright. Usually
they just get so boogered up that the keys become painful to use. Or
they have somehow gotten unplugged. I guess both of those count as
mechanical failures though.

Subject: [PLUG] gnu make exported variable expansion
Message-ID: <471FFF83.3010004@seitzassoc.com>


I have a Makefile that is set up to create listing files when gcc is 
run.  This is done with the following switch in CFLAGS.

CFLAGS += -Wa,-adhlns=$(subst $(suffix $<),.lst,$<)

This works fine at the top level, however I'm trying to get it to work 
with a recursive make.  CFLAGS is exported to pass it to the recursive 
make.  I believe my problem is that $< gets expanded to an empty 
string when CFLAGS is exported, leaving the listing filename set to 
.lst instead of sourcefile.lst.  What is the correct way to do 
something like this?

thanks,

Make does some strange stuff which is sometimes hard to understand
unless you have a
guide.

The problem is that what you have is a variable that does not get expanded until
the variable is referenced in the context that it is referenced.

I find that these following reference have helped me figure out how to
fix my makefiles
and make them better.

Subject: [PLUG] Right angle cat6 cable
Message-ID: <20071024224739.d5022076.johnxj@comcast.net>

On my old computer the RJ45 jack was toward the back of the computer.
On my new, beautiful Thinkpad T61 (love it!) it is in the middle of the
left side. This gets in the way of things I want to put there, e.g.,
books. It would be nice if I could find a cat6 cable that has a right
angle connector, or a right-angle adapter. Does anyone know if such can
be obtained, preferably from someone in Stumptown?

Never heard of such a thing. You might check out Greybar on 60th and
Glisan'ish though, they carry telco, network gear and might be able to find
something to fit your needs including custom if it comes to it.

Good luck,

I've never heard of such a think either, but you could probably fab
your own with a crimper, some heat-shrink tubing and strategic wire
length management.

I don't know where to find one in Portland but they do exist, at least 
in cat5 versions: http://vpi.us/cat5e-right-angle.html

I'm rearranging my desk so the books can sit on the right. Maybe that
won't work for you... I'm also plugging a second monitor into my T61
(after Anchorage it went to Kentucky, and then to my door) so I can't
really use a right-angle connector. 

I get all my cables from PCHcables.com. He's out by Intel, but it's not
that far and shipping is reasonable. He has almost everything and if he
doesn't have it, he'll find it. My most recent request was 12" power
cords, very useful for cleaning up rat's nests in the server cabinet and
under the desk.

Answer:  Docking station.  First, it bypasses the "side connections"
issues, second, it is much quicker to disengage, third, it saves wear
and tear on the laptop connectors (and the ethernet socket is much
more fragile than it should be, and damned hard to repair), fourth, it
props up the unit so the keyboard is easier to use and the fan is less
obstructed.  They seem dorky, but they've become essential for me.

Issue to watch out for:  When you undock a laptop, a whole bunch of
interfaces go inactive at once, which seems to keep the Hardware
Abstraction Layer software busy.  If you undock and then close the
lid to suspend, the HAL software may miss the lid close event because
it is still busy with the other stuff.  So close the lid first, wait
for the unit to suspend, then pull it from the docking station.  A few
times I've pulled my laptop out of my bag an hour after undocking, to
learn that I've used half the battery charge and heated up my bag :-(

Full Disclosure:  I have a T30 Thinkpad, and cheap used docking
stations show up all the time.  I bought 10 of them for $10 plus
$20 shipping (10 docking stations are heavy!) and have them littered
all over the house.  It is a pity one of them won't fit your T61,
because you will probably end up spending $100 on a new one.

Beware, I have noticed my wife's T61 sometimes wakes up when undocking
for unknown reasons.  She runs Windows, but I expect the wakeup event
would be the same for Linux, so your method might not work as expected
on the T61.  My T42p works similarly to how you describe, so something
changed on newer models (maybe just BIOS?).  Probably just the BIOS
option that keeps your USB hot.

Yep, the T61 needs a "mini-dock" (~$100), which is totally different
from the old Thinkpad docks.  Don't waste your money on a new full
dock though ($250?), the mini dock has all the connectors you could
want.  I think the new dock is compatible with the T60, so there might
be a few used ones out there.

The full dock (at least one of them) does offer some pretty impressive
benefits though -- it's worth considering, in any case.  (A port
replicator will solve the cable issue also, I think.)  The full dock
has space for additional drive(s?), a desktop video card, and I think
another ultrabay in addition to all the normal "dock" stuff, so you
can run dual displays, store your media collection / etc. at home, but
still only have one computer.. (it also makes the cheaper or
power-saving hardware more appealing since you can still have space
and acceleration at home.)

Keith Lofstom once point out that UPS ground is about 1 day in/around

All this brainstorming has got me thinking of the *perfect* solution.
Strip the outer jacket off of some cat6, crimp a tip on, make a right
angle bend with the now-quite-flexible wires, and then hoop-staple the
loose pairs along the edge of the case to the back, where you can
hot-glue a keystone jack.

Hoop staples are great.

I've looked at x10 stuff, but I really don't need the powerline

I've got some of these I use for out-of-datacenter prototyping where
controlled power is needed:

Other than that, it's pretty cheap (way under $50) to build a

Otherwise, you'll likely find that X10 is actually cheapest, next to
building your own.

The ones we used at OSDL came from Pulizzi, and were not cheap.

Google for "t25 staple". I think that's what he means; that's the image
that popped into my head as soon as read 'hoop staple'. I used to use
T25 staples to run serial cables on baseboards...

Among the several things that stopped working after I ran the upgrade
for SuSE 10.1 last week is the automation of some lights in the house. I
have the following crontab:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
rsteff at Moonguide:~> crontab -l
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE - edit the master and reinstall.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

(Normally, I have the bottom four lines commented out.)

I can run the shell scripts directly from the command line and they work
as expected. They don't run automatically. That caused me to wonder if
there might be a problem with cron, itself. So, next I tried to find out
if cron is running. Since I don't do this very often, I typed it wrong
the first time. However, that did cause me to wonder if somehow
something is configured incorrectly.

Are you running these as part of the system crontab or as a specific user?

If you used 'vi' or something similar:

/etc/init.d/crond restart

If you are running as a regular user, use

crontab -e

to edit the file and it will add it to cron without having to restart.

   I still have some with the insulation across the top. Every hardware store
carried them as 'wire staples' because the insulation would prevent the
staple from cutting the wire's insulation. Most of the time I used them to
run telephone wire around the house.

Run this script:

true ; (
crontab -l > crontab.bak
echo "* * * * * date > /tmp/date.txt" > crontab.new
crontab crontab.new
crontab -l

echo -n > /tmp/date.txt
watch -n 1 'date ; cat /tmp/date.txt'
)

Initially, you should see just the output from the date command.  Then
at the top of the minute, you should see the output of the date
command above the output of the date.txt file.  Also the output of the
date.txt should change every minute. Do you see that?

If you do, then your crond deamon is working.  you can restore you
original crontab with this command:  crontab crontab.bak

If you don't, then as root restart your crond deamon with
/etc/init.d/crond restart

Also, you can rewrite those last two lines like so:

1-59/5 * * * * /home/rsteff/ShellScripts/x10-lights-on.sh
3-59/5 * * * * /home/rsteff/ShellScripts/x10-lights-off.sh

Sometimes it's the seemingly unlikely solution that turns out to be

That script ran as promised.

I edited (to make the just recommended change -- 1-59/5...) and saved
the old version of crontab.bak (the one just created) and restored it
with crontab crontab.bak. However, it still does not run the shell
scripts to turn the lights on and off.

I am getting mail from cron, though. The important part is:
-------------------------------------------------------------
/home/rsteff/ShellScripts/x10-lights-on.sh: line 6: x10: command not found
/home/rsteff/ShellScripts/x10-lights-on.sh: line 9: x10: command not found
-------------------------------------------------------------

That got me to wondering why I could, using a terminal window, run the
script from the /home/rsteff/ShellScripts directory and have it work,
but cron couldn't get it to work.

Then I remembered running make install x10 to fix something and seeing
it installed in /home/rsteff/bin. The shell scripts x10-lights-on.sh and
x10-lights-off.sh did not have full path names to the program x10. By
adding them, cron was able to find the program, and now it works as
expected.

Thanks for indirectly showing me what was wrong. I think I actually
learned something this way!

I e-mailed PCHcables this morning and this afternoon I got a response
that he could sell all the right angle stuff he could get his hands on,
but that he had no ken of a right angle ethernet cable or adapter. I
responded to tell him that someone here was interested in right-angle
USB connectors, so maybe later I'll get a response to that question
that I will pass on here.

Message-ID: <20071025194249.a0e2fd03.johnxj@comcast.net>

Re my new T61: I am having a few issues, of which the only showstopper
is wireless.

Several of you witnessed the birthing of this computer at the Clinic
Sunday. After I installed Gutsy amd64 and got everything pretty much
running, I discovered that wireless was not working. After 20 minutes
of poking at stuff we discovered that the physical switch on the front
of the computer was turned off. Duh! After turning it on wireless was
working fine at Free Geek. I could swear that the wireless light on the
lid was lit up at the time, but can't be 100% certain.

On Tuesday I went to PSU. Wireless would not work. The wireless light
was not lit up (and I have not seen it lit up since). I poked at
everything I could think of, but nothing would get the wireless
working. I took the laptop to the computer lab in the basement of Smith
and a kind Linux expert spent 15 minutes trying to get it working, but
without success. She sent me to "The Cat" in the computer science
building. 

At "The Cat" a fine young fellow (who demonstrated absolute dominance
of the Linux OS and its command line) managed to get wireless working.
To do so he added a couple of lines to /etc/networks/interfaces and ran
"dhclient wlan0." I thought the matter was handled. Today I went to PSU
again. At first I was unable to connect, but after five minutes of
poking in Network Manager I managed to get connected. My connection
lasted for about half an hour, at which point I was suddenly
disconnected. I was unable to get reconnected, so I went back to "The
Cat." The same fine young fellow was there and he spent about 45 minutes
trying to get it running, without success.

1) The chip is working fine, i.e., it is not a hardware failure.

2) When I go to System > Administration > Network and select the
wireless, then Properties, it is set to Roaming Mode. I can uncheck
Roaming mode, but to get the change to stick I have to enter something
in the Network Name (essid), the Password Type, and the Password boxes.
Otherwise, when I click on OK it just goes back to Roaming Mode. After
much searching I discovered that Roaming Mode means "look for a
network." It is interesting to note that in Password Type the choices
are WEP key hexadecimal, WEP key ASCII, and WPA Personal. There is no
option for "unencrypted," which is apparently what PSU wants. More
interesting is that the dropdown for the essid box does not display any
available networks, although the two times I did have wireless working
it did display a dropdown list.

When I run "sudo dhclient wlan0" it fails to find any connections. I
have also installed Kwifimanager, and it fails to find any connections.
Thinking that my problems might be caused by a conflict in
Kwifimanager, I uninstalled it and rebooted, but still no joy.

The modules are iwlwifi_mac80211 and iwl4965. I can modprobe them and
they seem fine. They are listed as loaded in lsmod.

So T61 users, does your wireless work? If so, what distro/architecture
do you have? What is the wireless chipset (mine is Intel 4965)? I need
more suggestions.

John,
I don't have a T61 (drool) but I have encountered my share of weird
wireless  problems on my own laptop.  So hopefully some of these tips will
help or point you in the right direction.

First: The light on the lid, I had the same problem with my Acer Aspire, it
had to do with ACPI not being loaded, I was actually disabling it on purpose
to troubleshoot and found it was required for the wireless nic to function,
when ACPI loaded the light on the lid would come on regardless of whether or
not it was associated with an access point or not, just sort of a "hi i'm
alive" mode. So that might be something worth looking into.

I googled this bit
http://osdir.com/ml/linux.arch.general/2004-10/msg00173.html which was what
I was thinking in terms of getting the laptop to associate with an open AP
(no wep) its entirely possible to do so I'm not sure why the network manager
doesn't allow you to configure this.

Hope this helps or gets you pointed in the right direction.

Cheers!
Drew-

I've seen networks crippled by 20-30% throughput by people  
"neatening" their connections, throwing harsh right angles into the  
mix, or cramming/crimping them all together with zip ties, or using  
poor lengths for patch cords (etc. etc.). It's fairly counter- 
intuitive, and meaningless for idle net-surfing, but if you really  
need to squeeze *every last drop* out of your cables, it's nice to  
know the dark arts (aka "standards based on science") for cable  
handling.

Amusing anecdote, I ran across this *one* workstation where:
a) all the desktop power cables, network cables, the whole shebang  
was zip-tied into one big CF of bleed through. Every time their laser  
printer fired up, their network performance dropped. (Uhm, of course?)
b) Since there was *so much* cable, it was zip-tied into a neatly  
stacked *coil*. (This was apparently not somebody who passed high- 
school science basics, or they slept through the day on making  
electromagnets).
c) Since it "looked nicer", all the cables had harsh right angles,  
which, for *some* reason, were hotter than the rest of the cable, and  
just didn't seem as fast is they should be (hey, lets ram countless  
electrons into our cheap insulation layer, and see what it does!).

While the Malware cleanup tools (*sigh*) were running on their  
machine (based on the above? uhm, yeah, clueless.), I reran power  
with power, reran data with airgaps, removed the bends, re-crimped  
the ends, eliminated coils, etc. Since it's been a few years now, and  
the malware is prolly back, but at least it'll still run faster.

Unless, of course, they decided to "clean up" their cables again.

Solid-state opto-isolated relay and a usb-serial dongle?  I'll be 
building myself a few "real soon now"

There are IIRC, some ethernet-enabled pic devices for around $50, but I 
haven't looked at how the interfacing is done.

I think the Asian retail market has quite a bit in terms of 
usb-controlled power strips, but I can't seem to find anything about 
them in English.

Wireless drivers are under heavy development right now.  I am not sure
what distributions are doing with that development at the moment
(whether they are using it or not) because I use vanilla kernels and
mostly atheros radios (not intel, like yours).  I read something
recently on the linux-wireless mailing list about how someone cured an
association problem by scanning manually (iwlist <iface> scan).  I
have no idea whether that will help you.

I have no engineering degrees and physics was a long time ago, but I do
know what "impedance" means. 

At the same time I have a substantial knowledge of the world of
business, and I see a very good business opportunity here. The product
I am seeking does not exist. If you went into business manufacturing it
you would have a technical monopoly. Considering the interest on this
list and the comments by PCHcables, it sounds as though one could make
a tidy sum on such an enterprise. The real profit comes at the end when
you sell the business and the patents to BigNameCorporation.

That sort of worked. Except it didn't get me anywhere. :(

I am at home right now and the only wireless networks are a few
neighbors. Still, in the past, using the Ubuntu GUI, the networks would
be visible in the dr\op-down list from network-manager. That was using
the old computer with Feisty amd64 and ndiswrapper with the Broadcom
4306 chip.

Running "iwlist wlan0 scan" I can see the neighbors:

jjj at Devil7:~$ sudo iwlist wlan0 scan
wlan0     Scan completed :
          Cell 01 - Address: 00:19:E4:4A:80:A1

                    Mode:Master
                    Channel:6
                    Frequency:2.437 GHz (Channel 6)
                    Quality=35/100  Signal level=-88 dBm  Noise

                    Bit Rates:1 Mb/s; 2 Mb/s; 5.5 Mb/s; 11 Mb/s; 6 Mb/s
                              9 Mb/s; 12 Mb/s; 18 Mb/s; 24 Mb/s; 36 Mb/s
                              48 Mb/s; 54 Mb/s
                    Extra:tsf=00000017787163c3
and so on for the rest of the neighbors.

However, when I go into the GUI the dropdown does not function. It used
to show all the available networks, whether I had a password to connect
to them or not. Now the dropdown button just does nothing. Having said
that, the three times I have been able to get wireless working, the
dropdown did work. I think the problem is in the Gutsy GUI tool.

I also found a post on Ubuntu:

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=587922&highlight=thinkpad+wireless

I posted a followup, but no responses so far.

Thanks for the "iwlist <iface> scan" line. At least it proves that the
wireless is working, the drivers are working, and it can see other
wireless networks. Why I can't actually connect to any of them (e.g.,
at PSU) is the remaining question.

I should add that I added a gnome tray icon for the wireless. It sits
there constantly with a red X through it.

Well, I still can't get those hoop things to work so I just turned the
laptop 90 degrees and now I have the ethernet port pointing in the
right direction. Taking John's suggestion, I have sent in the patent
application.

Even worse, you can get crosstalk between the cables.

Many years ago when I was a PICK programmer (shows you how old I am), I 
worked at a place that had their minicomputer in the old mainframe area. 
Instead of using the arcnet pods as designed, they ran unsheilded cable to 
the various terminals.  And since they did not want to make a bigger hole 
in the wall when they added more terminals, they would just tighten the 
cable ties.  I tried tracing a line with a toner and EVERY cable lit up.

Not the worst though.  A similar business I worked at ran the lines for 
hundreds of feet through a warehouse instead of using the arcnet pods. 
They wound up creating a giant dish antenna.  Every time someone keyed 
their mike in the industrial park, the network would go haywire.

Occasionally I still see such sillyness.  (Ethernet over florecent light 
ballasts, Echerian network configuration, Unterminated cat-2 to nowhere, 
etc.)

Desktop computers just give you a more localized way to mess things up.

   Such as using the cdrom drive tray as a coffee cup holder, and complaining
when all installation floppies cannot all be shoved in the drive. And, let's

LOL, I was thinking of that as well, last night, so two things to  
ponder:
a) That's using a *slightly* different set of materials. ;)
b) It actually *is* why high speed runs, on many high speed computer  
parts, are as short and have as few hard angles as possible. It  
actually factored heavily into supercomputer design as far back as  
the CRAY-1 days, and is still important in the most speed sensitive  
areas.... but *much* slower devices, like video cards, hard drives,  
daughtercard busses, etc (places where anybody can look and see all  
kinds of inventive angling), well, it's just not worth the time, or  
money, or manufacturing expense, to really optimize the "cable run".

Of course, in terms of "bang for the buck", YMMV. One only needs so  
much "ooph" to read email. :)

I trimmed it a tad. *Right angles* are fine within a reasonable bend  
radius. Too harsh of a bend, and signal quality degrades. Hoop  
staples can be great as long as they don't damage the wire.

Again, my caveat:
"It's fairly counter-intuitive, and meaningless for idle net-surfing,  
but if you really need to squeeze *every last drop* out of your  
cables..."

Most people really don't need to squeeze those drops, as they have  
bigger fish to fry when it comes to their speed issues, but when I  
worked for a digital pre-press company in the late '90's (that was  
*paying* people to essentially watch progress bars all day long), I  
was tasked with doing everything I could that could result in as  
*little* of a 2-3% speed boost, as it was essentially a 2-3% increase  
in profit.

Totally unrelated to cabling, but indicative of the many  
"improvements" employed, chasing that tiny margin: Paperclips were  
bent, and used to jam down the space bar, because it was discovered  
that printing speeds improved 40-80% when the program currently  
printing was the foreground task, and was being doled out more CPU  
cycles to receive the 'spacebar' events (Co-operative multi-tasking a  
la Mac OS 7-9 had some nice side benefits as times... like being able  
to deny other tasks CPU).

Bringing this back on topic, it's also when I started transitioning  
from using DG/UX on big iron servers to Linux on small iron servers.  
Compared to DG/UX (and our AIX-on-early-PPC box), RedHat 4 and RedHat  
5 on x86 were a total *dream* to administer and configure. (Note: not  
RHEL, not fedora.... just "RedHat")

At the risk of ruining the joke, the hoop staples remark was meant to
be funny.  John's T61 is gorgeous (if too wide for my tastes).  The
mere idea of stapling some cabling into the plastic shell was meant to
elicit twinges of horror.

Sorry if I was too subtle or not funny enough.

That was supposed to be funny. I have broken plastic all around the
side of my case from trying to get those things in and when I did,
just as Ronald predicted, the bits were strangled and I had no
bandwidth.

A while back (several months at least) somebody at the Clinic set up a modem
dialer for
Chuck Metzger.  The problem was that gnome-ppp wasn't dealing with the modem
properly.
Maybe it was a driver problem, I don't know.  The workaround was to use
wvdial directly.
Whoever helped him set up a 'green telephone'  icon on the upper tool bar
that did that directly.
 I suspicion that it was Aaron who helped.

Now the ISP ( Chuck said 'phone company') has changed the dial-in number,
and Chuck would
like to modify the 'wvdial' config to use the correct number.  I gather this
is not an isolated
phenomenon since my ISP (hevanet) has a note on their web page advising a
dial-in change, and I've seen references to it in other forums.  So the
question is, does anyone
remember helping Chuck set this up? Using a script? Modifying
/etc/wvdial.conf? All control
in the icon properties?  I had Chuck 'ls' his directory, and he didn't see
any
'.wvdialrc'  file.  He's not a CLI guy, so talking him through a manual
modification of
'/etc/wvdial.conf' would be awkward.  If worst come to worst, he will bring
his hardware
to the next clinic (three weeks?).

Did you try having him right click on the icon to see if there is a
"configure" or "properties" option? If the phone number's not there,
maybe some hint as to the location of the file in question might be.

Yes, I did (except that his mouse is setup left handed, so it was really a
left-click).  He reported that there was nothing there.  Of course, what he
thinks
'nothing' is and what I think 'nothing' is are probably different things.
I'm trying
to help him on the phone, which is awkward to start with, and he only has
one
line, so we can't do a full on trial-and-error.

I dimly remember helping someone put a telephone icon on their top
panel in Gnome. However, it was after someone else helped him get the
modem working. And I have no recollection of how I got the icon
connected to the dialing properties. May I suggest that you look in
System > Administration > Network > Modem Connection (select Modem
Connection, then on the Properties button). Navigating through the
screens should lead to a place where you can enter the telephone
number. I think the icon just goes to the (only) modem. Once you change
the dialing properties for the modem the icon should work as before.

I don't want to interrupt, but there is an easy solution for Debian and
Ubuntu Feisty or Gutsy. It is a gnome desktop applet for pppconfig called
ppptray, and you can get it at http://www.getdeb.net/

Thanks, John, for reminding me of the obvious (sez tony, smacking his
forehead
with the heel of his hand, or 'Doh!')

Catch-22.  How can he download anything without a network connection?
Maybe for the future, and I'll mention it to him.

Well, it was a great suggestion, but no help.   Chuck said he already
tried that to no avail.  The Network Modem Connection settings
are associated with the standard Gnome-ppp app and config.
The second dialer setup using wvdial directly, whatever it is, is a complete
end-run.  I think that's why I suspected a direct invocation
of wvdial with an independent configuration.  I was hoping against
hope that someone would remember this particular instance.

Thanks for the contributions, people.  I think Chuck is just going to
wait for the next Clinic.

I do hate to keep interjecting myself into other people's threads, but I
recently went through exactly the same frustrations while attempting to
configure my son's laptop for internet access via a serial modem.  Nothing
on the standard Ubuntu Edgy seemed to work, not the the system -->
administration --> networking, not the wvdial, NADA!  Then I tried
pppconfig and voila!  It worked like a charm.  Of course, it involved a
little cli (of which I'm a novice but not a n00b), but it fired up and
connected flawlessly the very first time.

I'm pretty sure that pppconfig would work, and thanks for the
suggestion.   That's not the issue.  I'm helping someone else.  His modem
works.
The dialer has been working.  The ISP changed the dial-in number.  All he
wants to do is change the number  on his machine wherever it is specified.
He doesn't
know where that is.  Someone at the Linux Clinic set it up for him,
apparently using 'wvdial'.  My original question was whether anybody who
goes to the Clinic
remembered setting it up for him so that I could get a handle on where the
number
might be on his machine.  It was not 'How can we get the modem to work?'.

Finding hidden configurations in a gui morass is annoying.  Not
knowing anything about any of these applications, this is what I'd
try:

  $ sudo grep -r 503-xxx-yyyy /etc | less

and/or

  $ cd ~
  $ grep -r 503-xxx-yyyy . | less

where 503-xxx-yyyy is the expiring phone number.  Figure out which is
the right file, then:

  $ vi <that-filename>

and change the phone number to the new one.

      The Personal Telco Project (www.personaltelco.net) is an
      all volunteer open source oriented organization that
      has been a leader in bringing free wireless internet access
      to Portland for many years.  Personal Telco has brought
      free wireless access to Portland by working with coffee
      shops, bars, and other businesses and individuals who
      are willing to share their internet connections.  Personal
      Telco predates Portland's Metro-fi system by several years
      and judging by Metro-fi's difficulties it may someday postdate
      Metro-fi as well.
      Russell Senior has been active with Personal Telco since
      the early days.  He will discuss the current status of
      Personal Telco and describe it's current projects.  And
      I suspect he will describe Personal Telco's role in the mix
      of wireless services in the Portland area.

Subject: [PLUG] web-based invoicing app suggestions
Message-ID: <20071029185344.GF15771@merlot.com>

I need to set up a simple invoicing app for simultaneous use by 3-4
people. I have been in charge of checkout for the wine-tasting event at
my daughter's school for three years, and my solution has failed to work
properly every time. We haven't lost any invoices, but the 'manualarity'
of the process increased dramatically as the software failed.

So I'm looking for suggestions. We'll have 40 items for sale, and no
inventory. I need to import about 400 names and addresses, and if it can
capture credit card info, great. If not we can handle that separately. 

I need to print a clean, simple, complete invoce on the spot, and
reporting by buyer and by item ordered will be required. There are
really no other requirements. Enter a list of items and quantities,
print an invoice, repeat. Fast entry of invoice items (via lookup of the
40 items that will be pre-entered) seems like it should be easy.

I've looked at a few allegedly multi-user Windows apps, but they all
seem to be based on the Access engine, which is not reliable in my
too-extensive experience. I looked at the invoice pages on SQL-Ledger,
and they seem to be for a single item. I don't mind the complexity of a
full GL package as long as invoice entry is simple. 

Payware sites are probably not an option, since our margins are thin
enough as it is. We could maybe buy software this time as long as it
will be useful for any and all future fundraising events. I would prefer
something free, obviously. I have server space to set up anything that
runs on Linux. I can run Windows in a VM on my laptop (KVM is pretty
cool!) if it comes to that, but that would be really icky.

Suggestions?

TIA!

   Not true, Kurt. Enter each of the 40 items as separate inventory items
(each with its own code), and you can build the invoice from as many items
as appropriate. I've used this for multiple services and expense items on a
single invoice.

   There was also a stand-alone solution presented here a month or two ago. I
don't know if that would be suitable for your needs, but the archives will
have the thread.

It's pretty, but doesn't seem to have the concept of inventory, or maybe
a better word would be 'products'. I need some kind of 'quick-fill'
capability so the invoicing process goes quickly.

Or did I just miss that part?

Thanks!

OK, on the SQL-Ledger demo site, where would I go to look at such an
invoice form?

I followed two invoice links and a POS link. 

Thanks.

Quentin,

   That's the one to which I referred. But, it appears to be designed for
services rather than for products, or a pick-list of items to invoice.

I believe you, but where is that on the menu? Is it an add-on, plugin,
whatever SQL-Ledger calls them?

   Accounts Receivable (AR) -> Sales Invoice. At least, that's where it is on
my system here.

Hi Kurt,

Why web-based?  One Linux box could have many credit-card readers, 
barcode scanners, ten-key pads and lcd displays plugged into it as long 
as you've got enough usb hubs (well, tapering-off at around 127 :-)

IMO, using the mouse on a pick-list in a web app is likely to be a slow 
and error-prone interface, especially if there are any page reloads 
required.

With libhid, you can address each keyboard-like-device separately from 
the main keyboard, even in Perl.

  http://search.cpan.org/~ewilhelm/Linux-USBKeyboard-0.01/

Of course, if you were thinking multi-user web-based, then either you 
have multiple computers or you were expecting cashiers to bring their 
own.  Assuming multiple Linux stations, you could skip the LCD display 
bit.

Using barcodes would be pretty easy if your products are already labeled 
(or you can print them if need be.)

If you decide to go with something web-based for the sake of the 
backend, maybe you can hook the input to it via a web API and lwp or 
WWW::Mechanize.

With a web-based app, you need only a browser on the client end. No
barcode reader, etc. I only have one barcode reader anyway, and no time

Actually, the picklist on SQL-Ledger looks nice and simple. Any my usual
checkers are pretty sharp.

It's a little late in the game to print barcodes, but I've considered
it, and will consider it again for the next event.

Thanks!

According to wvdial's man page, its configuration file defaults
to /etc/wvdial.config.  On my Fedora 7 box, that's where it is.
If it's not there, try doing a "locate wvdial" in the shell and see
where things really are.  Then you can edit it to your heart's content.
See the wvdial(1) and wvdial.config(5) man pages for details.

I used to use wvdial back before I got DSL, but that was a long time
ago and I don't remember the details.  It seems to me that there was a
GUI app available for controlling it, but I can't remember the name
(sorry!).  I don't think it was part of the wvdial package, though.

Subject: [PLUG] printer malfunction
Message-ID: <4727D9D7.90104@verizon.net>

I recently installed Ubunutu Gutsy to an HP laptop.  All went well with 
the exception of the wireless, but that is for another time.

I added my Photosmart 2610xi all-in-one printer as a network printer.  
All was good until today.  Yesterday I printed some photographs and all 
was good.  Today I tried to print a 924k sky chart and it wouldn't 
print.  Text will print from email or from the backside of the skychart.

I skimmed what appeared from dmesg and it follows...


[   63.831189] audit(1193789914.366:3):  type=1503 
operation="inode_permission" requested_mask="a" denied_mask="a" 
name="/dev/tty" pid=5347 profile="/usr/sbin/cupsd"

[ 3496.887396] audit(1193793347.790:4):  type=1503 
operation="inode_permission" requested_mask="rw" denied_mask="rw"

operation="inode_permission" requested_mask="rw" denied_mask="rw" 
name="/dev/tty" pid=8260 profile="/usr/sbin/cupsd"

Any ideas as to what happened here.  It used to print no problemo.

Thanks!!

Bruce

Bruce,
I found this https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cupsys/+bug/148173...
looks to be your exact problem. Might be worth  giving the command
they
given in the comments a try and see if it works.

Cheers!

Thanks Drew, but the above command did nothing.  More information to 
follow...

from the /var/log/cups/error_log

E [31/Oct/2007:01:50:22 +0000] PID 8994 
(/usr/lib/cups/filter/foomatic-rip) stopped with status 3!

Filter errors?

Hmm.  More reading in that thread shows it *could* be an issue with the
driver. I don't have my printer (an HP all in one as well) to test with. Do
you know which driver you're using with the printer?

Hey, this is the first message I've ever left on PLUG, I was just waiting
for the right subject to come in on.... Anyways, thanks for letting me
eavesdrop.

I installed feisty on my hp tx 1000, the wireless didn't, and I found a
thread on the Ubuntu forums that worked for me. Apparently you can just
install the dell drivers. Here's a link with more info:
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=434946&highlight=bcm4310

Took me about a half hour, but worked like a charm. Hope that helps.

There's a Spanish learning web site that ties together students with
under-employed tutors in Guatemala.  Lower cost lessons for the student, way above
average wages for the tutors.  Unfortunately, they have some issues with Linux. 
As the tech support person said:

Any of you familiar with what the problems might be with Flash Communication
Server?   Or video possibilities with Skype?

Michael,

   Ekiga (formerly GnomeMeeting) supports video and _may_ interoperate with
Skype; I don't recall whether it does, but there was a thread on the mail
list about this.

   I'm surprised there's not a F/OSS application that has equivalent
functionality as the Flass stuff while running on Microsoft, linux, and
MacOSX.

It is supposed to, but there is a bug that causes it to core.  It is being 
fixed.

Much of the F/OSS stuff works better.  (Mainly because when problems 
occur, they get fixed.  Not so for a lot of proprietary code.)  When the 
TWiT people tried using Skype for conferencing they got a lot of 
mismatched time delay problems.  (Maybe that is fixed now.  I don't 
teleconference very often.)

Alan,

   Thanks for that insight.

   I would like to use Ekiga for video teleconferences with clients and
prospective clients. But, I found the video part to be problematic; it won't
recognize my web cam that sits here staring at me from the top of the
monitor frame. I'd like to see that fixed RSN.

   In the meantime, voice conference calls for the price of calling an
out-of-state number works for us.

This is good. Very good.  Thank you.
Not as good as having the Flash thing, but still.

And Alan, today is Oct 31 - Halloween, not Christmas.

The wealth of information in the archives are rotting from disuse.

Even the dictionary is aware.

http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Rsync

Perhaps Keith should commission some dervish prayer cycles.

Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes, or a bicycle
messenger bag full of DVDs.

                         <russell at personaltelco.net>


      The Personal Telco Project (www.personaltelco.net) is an
      all volunteer open source oriented organization that
      has been a leader in bringing free wireless internet access
      to Portland for many years.  Personal Telco has brought
      free wireless access to Portland by working with coffee
      shops, bars, and other businesses and individuals who
      are willing to share their internet connections.  Personal
      Telco predates Portland's Metro-fi system by several years
      and judging by Metro-fi's difficulties it may someday postdate
      Metro-fi as well.
      Russell Senior has been active with Personal Telco since
      the early days.  He will discuss the current status of
      Personal Telco and describe it's current projects.  And
      I suspect he will describe Personal Telco's role in the mix
      of wireless services in the Portland area.

Google is your friend. You can limit a Google search to a specific domain.

On the Google Advance Search page, put pdxlinux.org/ in the box for
"return results from the site or domain" and be sure that "only" is
selected from the preceding box on the same line, the one that is just
over 1/2 way down the page, and starts with the word Domain.

Or just include site:domain.tld as one of your search terms.

I regularly use site restricted Google to find things.  It is usually better than
whatever search the site itself has put in place.

Of course I already knew to do this, but would a newbie?  I'd like to 
see something on the plug mailing list page 
(http://www.pdxlinux.org/mail/) to help the unwashed (or forgetful) 
masses.

galen,

   Probably like us oldies: one month at a time and scanning thread titles.

   If there's a better way I'd like to know it, too.

I like and use Bacula, www.bacula.org, a client-server backup system 
that includes support for encrypting over the wire (via TLS) and/or
encrypting to disk/tape. Initial setup can be a headache, but once 
configured, it runs like a champ.

If someone is responsible for figuring out backup for their place it would seem
that using search engines would be among their skill set.

Folks mentioned my usual choices, rsync (basic) and Dirvish (which is
rsync with frosting and sprinkles on top.)  Where were you thinking of
backing up to, and how?  Were you wanting a nice GUI interface with
searches and individual file access or just a "get 'er done" commandline
deal that runs from cron?

I'll note that Dreamhost offers a webhosting plan that includes 500GB of
storage for $120/yr, and you can get like $97 off that price if you find
a coupon.

Thank you Kurt.

I have seen this before.  I have upgraded to Gutsy which supports the 
Broadcoms.  My problem is with signing on to my wireless network.  For 
some reason the router won't accept the WEP from this machine/distro...I 
think.

Dumb question Bruce but have you appended 0x to the WEP key when you're
entering it?  I got  caught by that using Fedora's network setup widget once
and was perplexed by why the key wasn't being accepted by the router.

That's not a dumb question...is that zero x or oh x?
Are we confused yet?
Why do we need to append anything to the WEP...I am only using 64 bit at 
this point, also.

For some reason the widgets require you to do it in order for it to
recognize it as HEX ... I'm sure some distro's have a mechanism for
