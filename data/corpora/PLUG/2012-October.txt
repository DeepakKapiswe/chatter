Hey, Russell.  Sorry to hear you had problems.  I was off the net or I would
have gotten back to you sooner.

As I think I mentioned in my talk, I never put  / or /var on anything fancy
(RAID1 at most, no LVM, etc.) so I never run into this.  I want my minimal
boot environment as simple as possible because everything is so much easier
to fix if the box can at least boot.  I inherit systems with /var in LVM
under a variety of distros though and I've never had any problem.

PVmove is probably the most challenging operation, but it uses a very
reliable and interruptible approach.  It mirrors the logical volume to the
new destination, then shifts the pointers over to the new destination and
drops the old one.  If it gets interrupted anywhere along the way, the
pointers are always left pointing at a valid copy.  A "pvmove" command with
no options will resume a previously interrupted pvmove.  I'd be interested
in knowing if you tried that to get it unstuck.

In any case, glad you got it resolved.

            -Brian

Portland Linux/Unix Group Meeting Announcement

Who: Vincent Zimmer, Intel
What: UEFI Secure Boot and Open Source. It's not a 'general war against 
computation.'
Where: PSU, 1930 SW 4th Ave. Room FAB 86-01 (Lower Level)
When: Thursday, October 4th, 2012 at 7pm
Why: The pursuit of awesome, open technologies.

See location H-10 on the PSU map at http://pdxLinux.org/campus_map.jpg

As 2012 platform firmware embraces UEFI 2.3.1 and ACPI5.0 support, the 
ability to interoperate with UEFI Secure Boot is imperative. This poses 
a unique challenge for open software that may not come pre-installed on 
the platform. With UEFI Secure Boot, though, infrastructure has been put 
in place to preserve openness, owner choice and control in addition to 
mitigating concerns of malware targeting the platform. This talk will 
provide a history of UEFI Secure Boot, an overview of the 
implementation, deployment practices, and details on the engagement with 
the open source community.

Vincent Zimmer is a Principal Engineer with Intel Corporation. He has 
been working on various platform, networking, trusted computing and 
security technologies around EFI since 1999 and platform firmware since 
1992. Vincent has spoken in various forums on this topic, co-authored 3 
books, 10 papers, and several specifications in this area.

Subject: [PLUG] ssh pass-phrase to log on to a system???
Message-ID: <506DBAE2.6010401@gmail.com>

Poor subject so I have to explain.

I've moved to Linux Mint 13 on my netbook from Fedora 12 and would like 
to replicate some of the functionality I had before.  My searches are 
taking me in circles so I'm hoping someone on the list will have the 
solution or a good pointer and/or correct terms to search with.

With Fedora and CentOS (current workstation/desktop) I added a line to 
/etc/pam.d/gdm

    auth       sufficient pam_ssh.so

so when I log onto the system I can use my ssh key pass-phrase.  Once 
logged in I now don't need to enter my pass-phrase when I ssh to a 
remote system that has my public key in .ssh/authorized_keys.

How do I accomplish the same with a Debian based system or just Linux 
Mint?  Which files, what modules, etc?


TIA,
Rod

I wonder if perhaps Mint doesn't have a graphical ssh-agent manager
installed? If you:

ssh-add .ssh/${your_key_file}

does that work for you?

I'm sure it does.  But I believe (the Linux Mint system is not available 
right now :-( so I can't confirm it) that it goes away after you close 
the terminal window where the command was run.

I think there is a gnome-key-agent thingy also but I haven't explored it.

Subject: [PLUG] Odd errors (PATH related?)
Message-ID: <671C5BB8-DA40-4D53-BDB5-C6A3F0E635D5@dimstar.net>

Earlier today, I finished editing a script for backups. Parts of this script have been working for months, and now they are failing. Things like tar, gzip, ls, and grep, are now reporting as "no such file or directory". As I said, these commands in my script have worked for months. Now, the exact same commands are failing. It acts like a path issue, and I haven't made any changes to the environment on this box. 

Specifically, this line:

tar zcpf ${archiveDir}/dbdumps${DATE}.tar.gz .

results in 'tar (child): gzip: Cannot exec: No such file or directory'

gzip is always in the path.

And, if I run;

# which gzip

I get:

/bin/gzip

If I run the tar command from the command line, it works. If I run the script, as the same user, from the console, it fails. If the script runs from cron (the desired place to run it), it fails. 

Any ideas?

No immediate ideas, but all bash type shells (bash ash dash csh/tcsh etc)
have -x and -v switches that produce voluminous trace output, before (-v)
and after (-x)  line execution, showing variable substitution and path
expansion.  This might help narrow it down.  Adding a specific 'trace'
invocation to the tar command might get even more detail specifically
related to how tar resolves the gzip path.

If you are used to PAM for authentication, you can check the repository 
to see if you can add it.  I am not sure if MInt includes it (depends on 
Mint flavor).  Some of us don't like PAM and you can set this up without 
it.  Oh and I don't use graphical login: that stuff is for pansies.

I'm a bit rusty on this, but here goes:

ssh configuration and system keys (private/pub) to identify your system 
are in /etc/ssh and personal keys are stored in ~/.ssh  that you 
generate via "ssh-keygen -t rsa"  You can skip the pass phrase (leave it 
empty), or enter a suitable one.  If you want to automate the login 
process, you can skip it.

OPINION: set ups that memorize your pass phrase are a BAD idea.  For 
full security ONLY YOU should know it and enter it every time you log in 
to your local and/or remote box.  you can use ssh-agent to store pass 
phrase and keys in memory PER SESSION so that these are not floating 
around your hard drive.

Then use ssh-copy-id to correctly copy your ~/.ssh./id_rsa.pub key to 
the correct place.  In other words, follow the instructions here:

I'm looking at getting a new (nearly new in this case) laptop on which I
would dual boot Windows (probably not often) and Linux, probably either
Ubuntu or Mint.

A friend has a machine up for sale which looks like a good deal and I think
might work for me. It's an HP Pavillion dv7 (descriptive
page<http://www.shopping.hp.com/en_US/home-office/-/products/Laptops/HP-Pavilion/B2P31UA?HP-Pavilion-dv7-7012nr-Entertainment-Notebook-PC>).


The specs suggest to me this seems like a reasonable machine for what I
want. Question - anyone know of a problem area here, a reason dual-booting
wouldn't work smoothly enough with this particular laptop?

The only issue I can see, is with the core i7 combined with the dedicated
Nvidia graphics card. This means that you will have to use "bumblebee" to
switch between the on-chip intel graphics and the Nvidia one. It is a bit
of a pain, but improving fast.

Other than that, I have always had good luck with HP and Linux (Kubuntu
specifically) so I would not expect any major roadblocks to dual booting
with Windows.

I can't speak to this particular laptop, but I have an older HP laptop 
dual booting Win7 & Ubuntu.  It works flawlessly.

Typically, any fairly current laptop with even the most modest of
specs shouldn't pose any problems for a dual-boot setup. However, if
the laptop came pre-loaded with Windows there might not be an
available partition for installing Linux on. Which means you may have
to re-work your partition table.

Here's some information regarding that.
http://askubuntu.com/questions/142531/which-partition-do-i-install-alongside-windows-on-an-hp-pavillion-dv7

IMHO, the bigger concern would just be basic Linux hardware
compatibility. Presuming of course, you would like a fully functional
Linux laptop environment.

Here's a very well done compatibility report for that laptop and Ubuntu.

There's a very good chance similar write-ups exist for other versions
of Linux. Just google the laptop model and the distro of your liking.

HTH! Best of luck to you!

There's an easy way to find out. Get a Live CD for Ubuntu and boot it.
See http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop .

If it detects everything (the GPU, ethernet port, wireless chipset and
power controller, primarily) and boots successfully, then it will
work. You should check that everything (LAN, wireless, suspend/resume)
works.

This laptop has a Nvidia GT650M GPU so getting the custom video driver
installed might require work if Ubuntu doesn't load that
automatically, but if the free Nvidia video driver works maybe that
might satisfy you.

Buying a new or used laptop always presents a set of tradeoffs, mostly
related to desired specifications versus price. You don't say how much
your friend wants for this machine, but various HP Pavilion dv7 models
are going for anywhere between $200 to $500 or more on eBay right now.
You might look at eBay listings and check those with comparable specs.

Whether a particular laptop is right for you depends on how you'll use
it and is largely a matter of taste. This is a 17in notebook, so it is
more of a 'desknote' than a road warrior's machine, but if you are not
planning to travel with it a lot, that might not matter to you at all.
On the other hand, if you are always on the road you might soon regret
buying such a large notebook that doesn't fit on airplane tray tables.

It also has a 1920x1080 resolution, 16:9 aspect ratio screen, which is
all too common, but is more suited to viewing media than creative
work. I think that a 1600x1200 resolution, 4:3 aspect ratio screen is
better for writing and viewing webpages because it doesn't force you
to do as much scrolling, but that's a matter of what you are
comfortable using.

HP's customer service and technical support reputation has declined in
recent years due to extensive layoffs and outsourcing, so there's that
to consider, too. Will you be able to get an original purchase receipt
to back up any warranty claim? Is the HP warranty transferable to you?

You might ask a local laptop repair shop about HP notebook reliability
and ease of repair in recent models. I'd rather buy a Lenovo Thinkpad,
because those are well built and almost bulletproof if not mistreated.

Those are some things to think about. I hope that helps. Best of luck!

Subject: [PLUG] question on ergonometric mice
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHdhfj7CHfxrbRvtVX3regKTx6iGmW-jPTwBVi31oOTpdQ@mail.gmail.com>

To those knowledgable about ergometric computer products:

Okay, this past 3 or 4 days I was doing a lot of work, and part of it
was using a mouse on a webpage, which required extensive clicking,
moving and reclicking.  Now I have two (yes I taught myself how to use
the mouse with the left hand after the right arm went into pain) arms
with shooting pains in the upper arms, and with 2 wrists that are NOT
happy.

I realize that the conventional mouse design is egonometrically
flawed, but I am confused by 2 designs offered, one is called a
handshoe mouse, and the other is a vertical mouse.

Can anyone who uses an ergo mouse let me know how well they are
working out?  Obviously the present mouse I am using had to go.

I am concerned with the vertical design that the arm is supported
properly and with the handshoe design, that the wrist doesn't push
against the desk surface.  In my case, letting my wrist rub or be
support on the desk surface has led to unhappy wrist pain, like the
tendons have been squished.

Thanks!

Randall

Randall,

   I use a trackball, and did since 1996 when a mouse gave me tendinitis of
the right elbow. Accupunture cured that and it's not recurred.

   My current trackball is a Logitech optical wireless that allows the middle
fingers to work the ball and the thumb to work the left button; it also has
a scroll wheel. I _really_ like it. The previous two trackballs were
configured to use the thumb on the ball that that is a terrible design; the
thumb does not have the fine motor control of the fingers.

About 3 years ago I started developing discomfort in my mouse wrist as
well. Rather than actually getting it checked out, I too switched to a
trackball, and it went away very quickly. I will offer a differing opinion
on the thumb-control though, I tried both and find my accuracy greater on
the thumb controlled devices. Give both a shot and see what works.
Additionally, the modern wireless Logitechs with the mini USB receiver have
been plug and play on every linux machine I've used them on. Best of luck.

That wrist thing is likely DeQuervain's syndrome
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Quervain_syndrome)
I had/have that.  I switched to the left hand and it went away for a
number of years.  It is back, but I do not use the right hand for the
mouse, so it must be caused/aggravated by other things.

Hi Randall,

I began developing wrist pain over 10 years ago when I was doing a lot
of coding and playing too much Quake.  The pain is only in the wrist
and is aggravated by turning my whole hand outward while my palm is
down (away from my thumb).  At that time I switched to a Kinesis
Classic keyboard.  This helped a lot at the time, since I no longer
needed to move my wrist in that uncomfortable direction to reach the
backspace and enter keys while coding.

Over the following few years, the pain persisted though, particularly
while playing too many video games.  The mouse action to the right was
a killer, so ended up buying a vertical mouse.  This did help, since
moving the mouse to the right no longer required moving my wrist to
the right.  It isn't perfect though.  I still need to be sure my arm
angle is correct and supported properly.  A track ball might be in my
future.

I had my doctor briefly look at my wrist (no xrays or anything like
that).  He said based on the symptoms, it sounded more like arthritis
than carpal tunnel.  He recommended I wear a wrist brace while I sleep
so I don't pinch my wrist in the wrong position for long periods of
time.  This does help.  I wear it when symptoms are getting worse, and
while I usually wake up in the morning with a stiff wrist, I it does
help.  I also wear it sometimes while at the computer and it adds
support that alleviates some pain.

That's my story.  Hope it helps,
tim

I also acquired wrist problems years ago.  I switched first to a touchpad,
and then to a trackball.  I used the Logitec Trackman Marble for over a
decade, and loved it.  Great big optical ball that can be manipulated with
the fingers, and buttons that sit right next to your thumb and ring
finger.  Three potential problems though.  It's right-handed only, they
don't make it anymore, and if you do find it, it comes only with a ps2
connector.

Now I'm using the Kensington Expert Mouse.  Same big ball, similar
wristpad, and has a scroll-ring to boot.  The buttons aren't quite as
nicely accessible though.

Ditto on the joys of a thumb-driven trackball, with 2 mouse buttons and a
scroll wheel. The only potential issue is that all the ones i've seen are
for the right hand. That and a relatively inexpensive split keyboard (i
have to confess i'm partial to the Microsoft Natural Keyboard!), and no
wrist pain or shoulders up next to my ears. A sit-stand desk helps, too.

Subject: [PLUG] question on parsing arguments embedded in the cmdline file
Message-ID: <CAJeYwHe_cpFSJa0EXo_t3wdR_tWWz14yjf0rpc7bbSF+-RueGA@mail.gmail.com>

This is not the traditional "ps -fx  | grep $1" question, but actually
working with the file itself located in the /proc folder.

I have a C program which opens up the /proc/pid/cmdline file and then
uses fscanf() to parse the command name.

This is all well and good.

But I found by careful investigation that fscanf could NOT retrieve
the rest of the information that I could see by typing the regular
script command %cat /proc/pid/cmdline.

Confused, I attempted to add two more character arrays to capture the
rest of the line, but that failed too.

Octal dump with the -x hexadecimal option showed what the problem was,
the /proc/pid/cmdline file is delineated by the NUL (0) character and
apparently fscanf cannot handle this.

Interestingly enough, I was forced to use feof() and ferror() to see
what was going on here and the EOF flag was being set after fscanf hit
the first NUL character.  I attempted to bypass that by resetting the
flag using the clearerr(file_descriptor) function, but that did not
fix the problem.

Just what exactly should be done, to successfully recover the other
strings embedded in this cmdline file? fscanf won't work.  Will I be
forced to use the getc() function?  I am not sure what that will do
when it hits a NUL too.

In regard to parsing the /proc/pid/cmdline, the best solution for me
was to open the file in "rb" or binary read-only mode and then to use
the getc() function and actually watch for the NULL character on the
fly and convert it to a space character while transferring the
characters one-by-one to a buffer.  Later on, I used the strstr
compare function to look for a particular substring in the converted
cmdline buffer.  This seems to work quite well, the pid_t pid# is
returned from the function call, if a match occurs, otherwise a -1 is
returned.

Hi,

Working in a repair shop, I could not recommend an HP laptop to anyone.  
The problems we saw with the dv2000, dv6000, and dv9000 series were the 
motherboards dying two to three months after the warranty expires.  I 
can't imagine the newer laptops being any better.

Actually, this kinda matched up with that assessment - the machine was
onlly months old when the motherboard died. It has been replaced and has a
3-year warranty. Hopefully that means getting at least three years out of
it.

Subject: [PLUG] Virtual server saves the day (?)
Message-ID: <20121009211654.GB17281@gate.kl-ic.com>

A few days ago, my websites were mentioned on Next Big Future,
and they are getting hammered with requests (a good thing). 
Unfortunately, being a cheapskate, I've been running them
lean and low memory, so they are effectively offline.  

Fortunately, I used the web administration interface to buy
more memory (400MB -> 1000MB), bumped up the process limits
in httpd.conf, and restarted.  Crossing fingers.

The next thing to monitor is monthly bandwidth allotment. 
In the last 3 days, I've used 20% of my monthly.  I may
bump that up using the web admin interface, too.  

I can reduce the cost a bit by migrating to another host
(same company), but that would mean changing IP addresses. 
I may do it if this keeps up.

Keith

Subject: [PLUG] Emacs: replace-regex to Remove Quotes
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1210151013550.1218@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   About a year ago Rogan taught me how to add quotes to a date string:

M-x replace-regexp
query = \([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]\)
replace = '\1'

   Now I need to do ther reverse: remove quotes around digits to convert a
string to a number. I've tried the above adding quotes to the query string
and removing them from the replacement string, but that leaves the string
unchanged. I've also tried other variants with equal lack of success.

   My Google searches turn up a emacs wiki page that has the code to remove
all quotes around strings; I need to do this to only quoted numeric strings
in each line of a file.

   A clue on how to do this is needed.

TIA,

Rich

Doing the opposite seems to be working for me.  Specifically (I used a
simpler example):

M-x replace-regexp
query = '\([0-9][0-9][0-9]\)'
replace = \1

Can you send an example of the before/after text you have/want?  The
query can be made to work with arbitrarily sized numbers, which could
be part of the problem.  (This example will *only* find 3-digit
numbers.)

Rogan,

   A-ha! I had the quotes inside the parentheses, not outside. That does make
a huge difference.

Many thanks,

BTW, emacs regex supports repeat counts.

\{3\}    previous character or group, repeated 3 times
\{3,\}   previous character or group, repeated 3 or more times
\{3,6\}  previous character or group, repeated 3 to 6 times

galen,

   Thank you. I knew this but could not quickly find my saved reference to
its placement. Now I have it again.

I would suggest against Mint.... Not because of the politics their found
brings in that I personally dislike but instead because by default they
disable Kernel Security Updates and also do not announce CVE's to their

CVE is an initialism standing for Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures.  Basically a system of reporting security exploits and
their fixes.  A lot of the bugfixes I see for Fedora are CVE security
fixes.

Check out  <http://cve.mitre.org/>  if you want more details.

Yeah Red hat does a lot of CVE fixes they have a lot of developers but
Ubuntu and Debian do their fair share. Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora publish
CVE reports to keep their users aware of security issues affecting apps
which Mint does not and further they disable Kernel Security Updates
because they feel they are a threat no other distro does this.

Mint does need to make some changes on its security approach, in my
opinion, but Ubuntu is not free from controversy, either.  Read this
article:
"
http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2207679/mark-shuttleworth-defends-ubuntu-1210-amazon-integration
".

Cheers,

Elcaset

I was actually one of the people who brought up the initial privacy and
security concern notably this was all during beta testing so it was not by
means a stable or final release and as we approach 12.10 release today the
security and privacy concerns have both been addressed.

Notably I am a Ubuntu Developer (I do not however work for Canonical).

It's good that the security and privacy concerns have been addressed for
now, but many of us are worried where Mark Shuttleworth's new attitude will
lead in the long run.

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1210181046130.30445@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I would like to understand why the latest flash player does not work
properly in firefox and Slackware-13.37/x86_64. When trying to view a video
a message pops up that the latest version needs to be installed. Last night
I went through the process again: download the *.tar.gz file,
uncompress/untar it, chmod to make the install file executable, then ran
that file. Finally copied libflashplayer to ~/.mozilla/firefox/plugins.

   Does firefox need to be restarted to see the new plugin? I'm at a loss to
understand why this one host has issues with flash player when the other
portable and the server/workstation do not have problems.

As far as I know, yes, firefox will only (re)load plugins during startup.

 I've seen a few sites that do a browser detect and then verify that
the software versions are up to snuff. Some will fail for anything
other than Windows or Mac based browsers. Never underestimate the
power of bad programming.

Steve,

   I certainly don't! There are too many Web sites that will not work with
firefox on linux; at least, not mine. So I open Opera (which I have report
itself as IE) and use that browser.

   While I don't understand why businesses stick with Microsoft knowing about
the direct and indirect costs I accept that this will not change in my
lifetime.

Any open office experts?

I have a sheet with 4 columns. What I need is a formula that will compare the value in column 3 and 4 to column 1, and return the value in column 2 in the same row as column 1. 

This formula returns 'TRUE': =IF(COUNTIF(A1:A5000;D1)OR(COUNTIF(A1:A5000;E1)))

Any ideas?

Don't think I quite get what you're asking for, but here's a go:
 =if(or(A2>C2,A2>D2),B2,0)
which does this:
 If column 1 is greater than column 3 or 4, return the value in column 2.
 Otherwise, return 0.
 (Note: I'm assuming there's a header in row 1.)

> This formula returns 'TRUE': =IF(COUNTIF(A1:A5000;D1)OR(COUNTIF(A1:A5000;E1)))

Yep, I'm definitely not getting what you're asking for.

Thanks for trying. :)

It would be something like this:

If the value in B3 or the value in B4 exists in column 1, return the value in ?2 where ? is the row in column A where the value was found.

I think the function you want is lookup, but I believe that sorting on
col 1 is required.  Also, what do want to do if B3 and B4 are not
equal but both are in column 1?

Syntax
LOOKUP(SearchCriterion; SearchVector; ResultVector)
SearchCriterion is the value to be searched for; entered either
directly or as a reference.
SearchVector is the single-row or single-column area to be searched.
ResultVector is another single-row or single-column range from which
the result of the function is taken. The result is the cell of the
result vector with the same index as the instance found in the search
vector.

Have you checked to make sure that you don't have two flash players in 
the system. I usually put mine in /usr/lib/firefox-x.x.x/plugins/
Flash sure is a pain in as butt though. I have often had versions that I 
have tried that will crash Firefox.

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu 12.04 and VMWare Fusion
Message-ID: <20121019041127.BF81E17F730@john>


Anybody know if Ubuntu 12.04 is supported by Fusion on a Mac? My early search 
results seem to indicate that's a negative. :-(

Right now I'm running Fusion 3. I haven't seen any reason to upgrade because it 
seems like the main reason would be to get Lion support, and I may never 
upgrade my Mac to Lion. :-P

I have more than one Ubuntu 10.04LTS install that I should be upgrading, and 
figured I'd try my VMWare install first to see how it went. The net result is a 
trashed system. The login screen video is so messed up I can barely see what 
I'm trying to do. Once I get in it's OK, but the VMWare Tools don't install so 
now I don't have shared folders, and who knows what else.

And OMG, how do I get rid of Unity? It just makes me want to scream.

I have another VMWare-based install that I use for work, which I guess I won't 
be updating any time soon. :-( My other two systems are running on real 
hardware, but I'll be damned if I'm going to subject myself to Unity on a 
full-time basis.

Well, they are strings, and they will never be equal. I've already attempted to figure this out several times. The calculations I've written count the occurrences of each string, so I know for a fact from examining the results that both strings do not appear in column one, but there are a few cases where neither string appears in column one.

Hmm, how do I make the SearchCriterion either C1 or D1?

Second, how do I copy the resulting calculation to 1200 cells in this column while only incrementing the search criteria, leaving the search and result vectors over the same range?

Thank you so much for the help Denis.

Immediately after writing this, I found the answer this is part of my question... Now to see if there is an answer to the multi-cell search criteria part.

When you know how to use the HUD and Customize Appearance it works much
better than most DE's and saves so much time over a menu based DE. But you
can remove it using apt-get remove and just replace it with another DE such
as xfce or kde.

I would do two separate searches using C1 for one, then D1 for the
other.  Follow that with choosing the one with a valid result.

This assumes that both returning a valid result does not occur, and
that there are no duplicates in column 1.

The preferred location for Mozilla projects is

/usr/libxx/mozilla/plugins

where xx=64 for x86_64 for global plugins. This is the install
location for the flash slackbuild script in /extra of the install DVD
- if you use Slackware ;)

Make sure no other versions are located in
.firefox/plugins
.mozilla/plugins

The dot locations are for local user only plugins.

Also, be aware that 11.2.x is the last flash plugin supported for
Linux. Depending on browser version and video driver it will have
various security and stability issues.

   Well, there's only one user of that portable so it should not be an issue.

   Huh! I wasn't aware of this. What are folks supposed to do if they want to
view flash videos that expect a newer version?

   I'm far from a spreadsheet expert but my clients use them instead of
databases (but that's another discussion).

   Reading this thread suggests that it might be more appropriate for Russell
to use gawk on a .csv text file saved from OO.o/LO. I don't recall seeing
the end use of the data nor whether it's fixed (or otherwise relatively
unchanged), but gawk excels (no pun intended) at pattern matching.

   I take spreadsheet-originated data and add fields based on the content of
other fields. As a brief example, here's a script that adds a flag when
water chemical laboratory analytical results are less than the method's
detection limit:

#! /usr/bin/gawk -f

# add-non-detect.awk -- Add both an indicator digit (0 = quantified, 1 = <RL) 
#                       and bounds to all quantities.
# Source fields: site, sampdate, param, quant; output fields add ceneq1,
#  floor, ceiling.

BEGIN { FS = ","; OFS = "," }

function abs(value)
{
   return (value<0?-value:value);
}

# NULL quantity
$4 ~ /^$/ { next; }

{
   if ( NF < 4 ) { next; }
   # Non-detected quantity
   if ($4 ~ /^-.*/) { print $1, $2, $3, abs($4), "1", "0", abs($4) }
   else { print $1, $2, $3, $4, "0", $4, $4 }
}

   I also wrote longer scripts that have multiple ifelse lines to cover all
contingencies. The results can always be re-imported into the spreadsheet.

HTH,

Rich

I guess we have to either change what it is we want to view or switch
to Windoze?

I had hoped that the efforts to get rid of Flash entirely would be successful.

The point is that I've spent literally years getting the (default) environment 
to where it's most productive for me. I want to upgrade, not start over. I 
shouldn't have to throw out everything and learn a whole new paradigm because 
someone thought it would be cool to throw away 30 years of user interface 
design and evolution to make everything look like a tablet.

kde/xfce/fvmw/afterstep/motif/whatever = starting over. I don't have time for 
that. I'm using these systems for real work, not a media center to watch 
internet videos. (and yes, I've used all those at one time or anther - they all 
had reasons why I'm NOT using them anymore)

If I'm doing a new install, fine. I'll take what it gives me and make it the 
way I like. But an upgrade shouldn't throw away what I've got and force a major 
change because someone else has a different opinion of "better". When I upgrade my 
10.04 web/mail server is it going to throw away my sendmail setup and leave me 
with a Postfix environment that I'm going to have to fix? And yes, this is a 
serious question.

When I upgraded my mythbuntu system from 10.04 -> 12.04 it didn't replace the 
xfce environment with Unity. Why should it when I upgraded this system?

That's the rant. I have others (like who made the vim maintainer god and gave 
him the power to decide what colors to use? Vim supports colors, great. Leave 
them the $#@ off and provide sample configs). But I found a way to (mostly) 
restore my old environment by installing "gnome-session-fallback".

My major concern now is Fusion support. I can't afford to move forward until I 
know that it will run on my Mac. (I need Windows and Linux on the same laptop. 
Because of filesystem issues running Linux on a Windows host doesn't work. And 
I've never had a Linux laptop that worked well all the time. The Mac "just 
works", and until now Windows and Linux both worked seamlessly in VMs.)

My Google-Fu fails me.  Are there any up-to-date sites that have
trustworthy reviews of laptops?  Are there any up-to-date sites that
have good information on various laptops and their compatibility to
Linux?  Are there any that do both at once?

I'm thinking of replacing my venerable old System 76 machine, for which
it is getting hard to find batteries.  Given that this thing has carried
me for somewhere in the neighborhood of ten years, I'm mightily tempted
to go with another System 76, but I'd like to do at least _some_
research first.

Message-ID: <20121020033249.GA28844@gate.kl-ic.com>

Come one, come all, to the Ubuntu/Amazon branded Linux Clinic.
Celebrating the addition of Amazon ads to the Unity dashboard 
[ NO STOP NOT THE CATTLE PROD AIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ]

Okay, I don't like Unity, and I hate ads on my computer.  If
you want to use Ubuntu 12.04 or 12.10, come to the Linux 
Clinic at 1pm, at Free Geek 1731 SE 10th Avenue, Portland 
and we can help you restore your desktop to Gnome goodness,
or at least remove Amazon from your dashboard if you like
Unity ( for heaven's sakes, /why???/).

We start at 1PM and run until 5PM, but /please/ don't show up
at 430PM and expect help - we'll be busy with the people that
showed up at 400PM.

Or bring any other Linux problem, and we will help you replace
it with an entirely different Linux problem.  We've got wired
and wireless ethernet, displays, meece and keyboards, a few
repair parts, and friendly volunteers who sometimes manage to 
suppress their smug superiority long enough to help.  We will
probably have coffee, oddball snacks, bad puns, comaraderie,
and shelter from the rain.  So bring your machine and your
questions, and leave with the sure knowledge that you now can
fix your machine and software (probably better than we can).

The clinic happens every third Sunday, unless we forget the
key or Portland is crushed under a moving wall of ice (a
common occurence around January).  See you Sunday!

   Interesting. I watch few videos and would not be overly upset if I could
watch none. But, I'm probably in the minority.

Unfortunately not, to the best of my knowledge. However, what I've
done in the best is done a search on a particular laptop I'm
interested in buying and the specific Linux distro I want to run and
have found sufficient information to base my decision on. Albeit, if
you're looking to run Debian on a Lenovo laptop, your chances of
finding lots of good, useful info are much greater than if you're
trying to run a less well-known and used distro on an off-brand
laptop. The information you're looking for is out there, it's not just
conveniently in one place and easy to find. Linux might be free in
terms of money, but not so much in terms of time.... :-/

I agree. I have always looked for the highest performance laptops I can
afford, then reduced that list to those that are Linux compatible. Then, be
sure to check the Linux compatibility of the major components/ships on the
model you are looking at - in particular the graphics card, network
controller, wifi, and bluetooth. Manufacturers are prone to change chipsets
over time, so the review by Mr Linux Geek from last year on the model you
like may no longer apply it the chipsets have changed. Sometimes you can
customize your order and replace the non-Linux compatible components with
Linux compatible components. I have had good luck with Dell machines for
the past 10 years, so I would recommend them. They offer Linux on some
machines, so you may be able to order that hardware.

If you are buying used, then a copy of a bootable distro is a must.

Good luck!

Mark

I've been watching this with quite a bit of interest as I enjoy a lot of 
music and music videos on youtube. I recently installed Slackware 14.0 
which included Firefox 15.0.1. To my surprise, Firefox was able to play 
youtube content without installing libflashplayer.so.

I had not used a newer Firefox for several years, so this is probably 
old news to many of you, but looking into it a bit further, is it 
possible there might be some movement away from browser plugins to 
browsers that are HTML5 capable?

I attended the Ubuntu 12.10 release party today (thanks, Benjamin!), had
a slice of pizza, got a new t-shirt, and hoisted a pint to the new
Ubuntu 12.10. For Clinic attendees and other PLUG people, I have the
32- and 64-bit 12.10 ISO images for:

	Ubuntu, desktop and server
	Kubuntu
	Xubuntu
	Ubuntu Studio

I couldn't find the Lubuntu images yet, nor could I find the
alternative installs for Ubuntu, and the Mythbuntu and Edubuntu images
are not yet to be found. I do have the 12.04 images for these, however.
I also have the latest Mint, Slackware, OpenSuse, Knoppix, Fedora, DSL,
Puppy and ArchLinux, in addition to various rescue CDs. And if you are
short of bandwidth I'll be happy to download anything else that you
need. 

Note that the Ubuntu Desktop and the Kubuntu images are now too big for
a CD, although Ubuntu Server and Xubuntu will still fit. I can also make
a bootable image on your USB drive if you prefer.

All of these will be available at the Clinic tomorrow. The Clinic has
some blank CDs and DVDs, but the supply keeps dwindling. If you bring
your own media it would be nice (but not required).

Wayne,

   I just reveived my 14.0 subscription DVD on Thursday. I'll upgrade the
Sony Vaio with the wireless and flash issues from 13.37 and see if that
solves both problems.

   Too bad that Pat and crew don't re-install the multilib libraries with
upgrades and new distribution releases.

Thanks for the insights,

Rich

No sooner had I sent my email when I encountered some content on youtube 
that could not play with HTML5, but required flash. I installed flash 
11.2.202.243. So far, it seems to work and not crash Firefox or 
anything. I think I'll change the name of my libflashplayer.so to 
something like libflashplayer.sucks to hide it and use HTML5 as much as 
possible in case any of the content sites are keeping track of how much 
the HTML5 method is used VS Adobe Flash. If I want to see something that 
HTML5 cannot play, I'll just temporarily move libflashplayer.so back.

Youtube has been transcoding alot, but not all, to HTML5 for either theora
or vp8, either in ogv or webm containers.  FF 15.x and 16.x runs these well
ootb.  For flash, yes, its going EOL, but google cut a deal to incorporate
it in Chrome (but not chromium).  In a pinch there are also FF extensions
and standalone programs that let you grab the flv and transcode or just
play (mplayer, vlc and play just fine without a plugin).

The one glitch I have with FF and Slackware is with the nividia driver:
every once in a while I have to turn off hardware acceleration (via vdpau,
on the newer 304.x driver seems a bit better) as the color pallet gets
scewy.  The laptop with intelhd is ok.

As for Slackware64 multilib, unless you need Virtualbox, Skype or WINE, you
can pretty much skip it or just run Slackware32.  Multilib is an
unsupported add-on maintained by one of the unpaid volunteers.  He has
posted the new Slackware64 14.0 multilib packages - I am running then now
since I run bor VB and WINE.

Ed,

   I run VB on the laptop, but also run a bunch of 32-bit apps on the desktop
server/workstation. These are in neither the distribution or slackbuilds.org
but I've used them for so many years that I count on their being there.

I'm pretty sure that the reason YouTube still requires Flash for many of
it's videos, even if you're in the HTML5 beta, is that it's the only way to
effectively gift you with ads and DRM.

Subject: [PLUG] First attempt to use preseeding when installing Debian
Message-ID: <508535E0.5040502@cloud85.net>

Why		- learn to use preseeding.
Why now	- I think I've found an install related bug. Using 
preseed.cfg would eliminate human error as cause.

For simplicity and repeatability I'm installing from DVD - 
*no network connection of any sort* .
The DVD is disk 1 of 8 of a commercial copy of Debian 6.0.5 
which has been used to do several successful instals.

The preseed.cfg file is on a USB stick formatted as FAT16 
which Debian happily reads and writes.
The preseed.cfg contents are taken directly from a standard 
example changing only the answers not the format. [i.e. 
change yes to no, specify correct time zone , etc.]

I've read the appropriate sections of the "d-i Manual", an 
assortment of web pages, and searched for related posts on 
the Debian user list.
I've asked also asked questions on 
debian-user at lists.debian.org. The answers, though 
informative and useful in many ways, were not "effective" 
[for want of better word].

I've found bits and pieces with too much detail on how to 
tweak the example preseed.cfg and very little on how to 
launch everything.

What obvious thing am I missing. Is there a "Preseeding for 
Newbies" page somewhere?

I KNOW I'm going to feel silly when I find out what I'm 
doing wrong.

TIA

Alternate install images (along with some install features like RAID
support) were dropped for the 12.10 launch.  There is a lot of chatter
about it out there, and lot's o' disappointment. Canonical giveth and
Canonical taketh away.

The alternate images have been handy to me at the Clinic. On more than
one occasion someone has wanted to upgrade from whatever Ubuntu they
currently have to the latest. We don't have a lot of bandwidth at Free
Geek, but the Alternate images allow an upgrade from CD rather than
over the net connection. Are you telling me that the Alternate images
will be no longer? if so, how can I upgrade an existing Ubuntu without
a net connection?

Subject: [PLUG] Netbook function keys
Message-ID: <CAArUT0jXSk3_ieAdp77HtVttzmrxnXOF-hshvM_3RfOnz1rRSQ@mail.gmail.com>

John assisted in getting Ubuntu 12.10 64 bit installed on my ASUS
EeePC 1015PEM.  Not wanting to face the frustration of Unity I
immediately downloaded XFCE 4.10.  It mostly runs OK to the extent I
have tested it, but at least some of the function keys do not do what
they should: fnF3 should toggle the touchpad (it appears to do
nothing) ; fnF10 should toggle the sound (it shuts it off but not back
on, but displays the little graphic indicating speaker on/off).  I had
similar problems with my earlier attempt at Ubuntu (12.04) and XFCE
(version likely was 4.8).  I posted to their forum but got only one
response since May.  That one response sent me to
http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Talk:UltraNav#Script_for_switching_state_of_TouchPad_and_TrackPoint,
which I found less than satisfactory.  I am not wanting write a bunch
of scripts to do what XFCE should do.

The mixer indicates the speaker off when it is, and will turn it back
on, so that is not too bad.  But the touchpad is more of a problem.

In Unity the keys work as expected.

Ideas?

Rich,

You might try the following:

Edit the file
    ~/.config/gtk-2.0/gtkfilechooser.ini

There is a line with the parameter ShowHidden.  Change it from True to False

Here's what the 12.10 Beta2 Technical

I have not yet been able to locate the same proclamation for the official
release,  but I strongly suspect that it exists.  I am afraid that the
current answer to your question "How can I upgrade..." is: "You can't".
 The best I can hope for at this point is that the community will come up
with one, or Canonical relents (highly unlikely, IMHO).

There is an Ubuntu Forums thread titled  *Don't allow Ubuntu to drop
alternate installers! *in the Community Cafe section, but not much of it is
very helpful beyond my earlier suggestions.

If you right-click on the list of files, does it present a context menu

   Hadn't thought of that. Next time a dialog appears I'll check this.

You can make a Live USB or Live DVD the alternates were removed to simplify
things the current images will allow a offline upgrade from later versions
without issue. I will have printed DVD's hopefully by Friday providing U.S.
Customs doesn't sit on them on the East Coast.

A whole clinic is required to show people how to install Gnome on Ubuntu?
As for the Amazon Results a simple click in Privacy Settings turns them off
or you can remove the package entirely with sudo apt-get remove
unity-lens-shopping

For those who attended the Release Party I think they have a better idea of
where the Unity Desktop Environment is going and how more results will
evolve in 13.04 whether it be product results or being able to search
Google Maps in the Dash or better yet integration with just about any site
or service you use.

Might I ask why you didn't install Xubuntu 12.10 amd64 if you wanted XFCE?
Your still going to have tidbits that Unity needs if you throw XFCE on top
while if you use Xubuntu your getting a pure XFCE experience.

Ignorance, basically, although the "amd" makes me wonder if it is
suitable for an Intel machine. Thanks for the suggestion.

YMMV.

Apply the 'What's in a name?' argument made popular by Bill Shakespeare.
 See the Wikipedia article on x86-64 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64>.
They're all the same.

Ignorance and miscommunication. Denis said "Ubuntu" and I didn't
realize until after he installed it that he intended to run Xfce. 

Because his netbook has no optical drive we had to make a bootable USB
drive. My computer has Fedora 16 which comes with a utility to make a
bootable USB, but it won't work with anything but Fedora images.
However, I had previously installed UNetbootin on the recommendation
that it could make a bootable USB drive out of any distro image. At the
Clinic Sunday was the first time I ever tried to use it. I am happy to
report that it made Denis' USB drive bootable with 12.10, exactly as
advertised.

So Denis, if you want to start over with Xubuntu, install UNetbootin,
download Xubuntu, and repeat what we did at the Clinic. No guarantees
that it will solve the other issues you have, however, but at least it
will not have any unnecessary parts of other desktop environments in
it.

Indeed, I spent about 5 minutes with one attendee showing her
how to add gnome (and generally use apt-get) and another 5
minutes showing another attendee how to turn off the amazon
shopping.  Then they showed others - the clinic is where we
empower people.

We spend far more of our time on other issues, whatever shows
up.  We don't have a fixed agenda, besides being helpful.  My
monthly announcements have a theme, and this month the buzz
(besides the tweedle-dee tweedle-dum election) is about the
adware in 12.10.  Some people don't like it AT ALL.

And indeed, that is the /problem/.  Many people want to be
passive consumers of media.  Very sad, most passive consumers
must learn to be active contributors over the next decade, or
starve in a hypercompetitive bottom-up-driven global economy.

Those of us who use our computers as general purpose creation
machines do not want to turn them into media vending machines,
driven top-down by the lords and masters of pay-walled content.

The clinics run half-and-half.  We help just about anyone
who shows up (+/- attitude, we are doing this for fun). 

The passive media consumers show up once, get their games
and youtubes and social media working, then go away.  Ubuntu
Unity is indeed designed for them, and most people don't
need our help to get their media fix, the install and
operation is dead simple for those people.  If that is
the current goal of Ubuntu, it is working.

OTOH, the creators don't want a vending machine, but they do
want a supported platform.  They chose Ubuntu when it had a
different set of goals.  The creators show up at the clinic
over and over again, and have much more engaging problems to
work on.  Watching a person learn their way from newbie to
Linux guru and teacher of others is inspiring, and my main
motivation for participating in the clinic.

Thanks, John.  I have little hope that a fresh install of Xubuntu will
solve the function key problems, but it is certainly worth a try.  If

Benjamin,

You're dissing PLUG on Twitter and its own mailing list.

If this is to promote Ubuntu, this is not how to do it.

If this is to promote a new Ubuntu-focused Linux group in Portland, good 
luck with that.

Please show a little respect. Members like Keith have used Unix since 
before the arrival or Linux or Ubuntu and will politely watch it come 
and and easily go, just as we all did with Yggdrasil, Mandrake and 
dozens of others.

I don't know if this bug is present in any kernels from the popular

from what I have read, the data corruption only occurs when the drive is
rebooted rapidly.

Hey Michael and Benjamin:

I think Benjamin was confused about all the different things
we do at the clinic, about my snarky announcements (no, Bill
Gates and Steve Balmer do not show up for help with Linux),
and the reasons for my idiosyncratic opinions about media
consumption software.  I am not seeing his side of the
conversation (I get the list digested, and only CC's sent
to me) so perhaps Ben is ranting about my rant.  I probably
should have toned it down a bit.  

I am passionate about resisting America's lethal (literally,
I can show you the research) addiction to media, but on the
other hand, I have fast hardware for scientific computing
because gamers demand it for entertainment.  I would rather
a few hundred thousand a year did not die of diabetes- and
obesity-related illnesses in order to provide me with the
tools I need for research. 

But as long as the hardware is available, and the distros
I depend on are not so damaged that I can't use them for
my purposes, the life-waste and self-destruction of others
is not my decision to make.  Just please, remember that
some of us Morlocks are laboring down in the bowels of the
machine so the Eloi can amuse themselves in the sunlight. 
H.G. Wells got the "Time Machine" story wrong;  the Morlocks
were not attacking the Eloi out of malice, they were just
protecting the system from lusers: http://xkcd.com/705/

Correct I was asking because I had intended to stop by to learn more until
Michael decided to be disrespectful.

Cool. I'm passionate about Ubuntu, Debian and Mozilla.

/Rant/
A long time ago I signed up for a Gmail account, which I still use
for a few things. Then a couple years ago I got an Android phone, which
required setting up a new Gmail account. And a year ago I got a new
Android phone which required setting up yet another Gmail account. And
last year PSU decided to switch all their pdx.edu accounts to Google
Mail. I have two pdx.edu e-mail accounts (don't ask, the story is too
stupid to relate). So now I have a total of five Gmail accounts,
although I never use the two Android accounts.

The other day I needed to log into my Youtube account with Firefox. I
clicked on the login button and up popped the PSU universal login
screen. WTH? I tried several more times, but the only thing that would
come up was the PSU login screen. There was no option to log in as
another user.

I finally called PSU's help desk. The solution turned out to be
disabling a lot of Google cookies on my Firefox. I was amazed - Google
had dozens of cookies on my Firefox. After disabling most of them
finally Youtube's login screen came up.

Unfortunately, having disabled so many Google cookies, now a Google
search takes forever. The screen flickers over and over as Google goes
out to numerous servers to get heaven only knows what kind of data to
display on my screen (ads, most likely). 

I realize Google makes money on ads and I'm willing to put up with them
for the benefit of the free things Google does for me and for the open
source community. But creating cookies that limit the user to logging
in only to Google accounts is going too far.

I have dozens of accounts like Youtube. The above only works for Google
accounts and other accounts that comply with Google's requirements,
which are next to none of my other accounts.

What happened on the day in question is that I had logged in to my PSU
Gmail account with Firefox, which I normally do not do (normally I
access it with Claws Mail). Once I did so Firefox refused to offer me
any login screen other than the PSU login screen, regardless of what
site I was trying to log in to.

I am not looking for a solution to the problem. I already have a
solution - disabling some of Google's cookies. My post was merely a
rant.

 ZaReason is really nice because they have several distro choices like
Kubuntu, Mint, etc.  Not just Ubuntu.

Google doesn't make it obvious, but you *can* log out via the Google
UIs.  It's a little bit different for each service, but generally,
there is a drop-down menu near your user name in the top right (often
associated with your picture / sillouette, and a very small down
arrow).

That menu should have a 'sign out' link, and it should apply to your
entire session -- that is, if you have youtube and gmail open, and
sign out via the Gmail ui, when you next load a page on youtube, you
should be logged out there.

With respect to /why/ you have all those accounts, I'll admit I'm also
confused (*I* think your phone would be more useful if you used a
Google account that you use for other things, for example); but that's
up to you.  There are legitimate security concerns with using one
account for all those things -- particularly on mobile devices, too.

Looks like it takes a *very* unique set of circumstances to trigger

I will look again, but the last time I tried to do that I found that
none of the function keys were listed, as if the function keys are
handled through a different mechanism.

Subject: [PLUG] Permission Denied trying to transfer from a shared directory
 on Ubuntu 10.04 to Ubuntu 12.04
Message-ID: <5089C5CA.8030501@comcast.net>

All the talk about problems with Ubuntu 12 reminded me that I need to 
migrate from 10.04 before next spring. I now have a machine I can use to 
experiment on. I've got whichever flavor of Debian one gets when one 
goes to the Debian download site. With that installed I can transfer 
files from my Ubuntu 10.04 system as long as I have the directory on my 
10.04 sharing set.

I also installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my experimenting machine.

When I try to transfer a file from my 10.04 machine to the 12.04 machine 
I get a "Permission denied" error message. How do I start figuring out 
what to tweak to fix this?

Thanks.

Does anyone have a 5-1/4" floppy drive they don't want?

I tried at Free Geek and learned that they pitch them as soon as they 
get them.

I tried Googling for one. Every site that is listed has 3-1/4" drives, 
but no 5-1/4" ones.

My brother-in-law has a very old DOS program he still uses on a VM. He 
got a new printer and needs to read his install floppies in order for 
the printer to be recognized.

I had one (along with my 80-column card reader and 5-1/4" floppy changer). But 
I don't have a controller for it. I'll see if it's still in the closet.

I have some but I am not anxious to get rid of them.  FreeGeek used to
have them, but I think (at least for a while) they were dismantling
them for their stepper motors.

3.5-inch were the smaller ones, not 3.25. :-)

All you really need is to get an image of the floppies then?  If I get
it back after you're done, I might be willing to loan one.

It all depends on how you are sharing the files:  USB drive, NFS, SAMBA 
(smbfs or cifs), ntfs-3g mount? Typically, you will get this if your 
numerical uid and/or gid are different even though the alphabetic name 
are the same.  In this case, the 10.04 "user" can't write to the 12.04 
"user"

For example, for a SAMBA share via cifs, my fstab reads:

//<server_ip>/archive /archive/data           cifs 
rw,uid=1000,gid=100,credentials=/etc/smb_mnt.conf     0   0

where smb_mnt_conf contains (because I am secretive the sharing computer 
has different users):
username=<user>
password=<password>
domain=<workgroup>

Once authenticated, the uid and gid are mapped back and forth correctly.

If are using NFS, you will need to set up your nfs daemons and exports 
file.  There should be init scripts in Ubuntu. In Slackware these are 
/etc/rc.d/rc.nfsd and /etc/rc.d/rc.rpc
Now you will set up (I use explicit server IP addresses as no local DNS 
servers are running and my /etc/host is empty):

/etc/exports

/data <server_ip>/255.255.255.0(rw,no_subtree_check,root_squash) 
127.0.0.1(no_subtree_check,sync)

/etc/hosts.deny

portmap:ALL
lockd:All
mountd:ALL
statd:ALL
rquotad:ALL

/etc/hosts.allow

portmap:xxx.yyy.zzz.0/255.255.255.0 127.0.0.1
lockd:xxx.yyy.zzz.0/255.255.255.0 127.0.0.1
statd:xxx.yyy.zzz.0/255.255.255.0 127.0.0.1
mountd:xxx.yyy.zzz.0/255.255.255.0 127.0.0.1
rquotad:xxx.yyy.zzz.0/255.255.255.0 127.0.0.1

where xxx.yyy.zzz are the first three octets of you server IP (assuming 
255.255.255.0 subnet).

Then mount the nfs share with something like:  mount <server_ip>:/data 
/mnt/hd

Now, if you are willy-nilly mounting "on the fly" with your file 
manager, and gvfs etc, in Gnome, then good luck.  I know nuthin' 'bout 
mountin' no gnomes!

Indeed. All the GTK file dialogs (at least the one I use Xfce) have a 
context right click with "show hidden."

Good to know about

~/.config/gtk-2.0/gtkfilechooser.ini

since I never bothered to look as I am just a right-clicking fool!

Thanks. I wish there was a way to be shown ONLY what I asked to see from 
these sales sites. Most of the time I get lots of things that are 
occasionally slightly related, when looking for something obscure. For 
example, in this case, most of the hits are for 3-1/5" drives. Sigh.

Anyway, I'm taking up John on his offer.

Leave out the quotes and the splats. As far as I can tell, the =~ operator
will match the target pattern (rds) anywhere in the search string.  If you
need more context for the search target, you will need to add it explicitly.

if [[ ${hn} =~ rds ]]
should find rds anywhere in ${hn}.  This for bash v3 and later, which
should cover you (bash --version tells all).  The current version seems to
be 4 something,

Could you use some awk/gawk to extract the values/variables before

"index" or "substr" prehaps?  Or have I misunderstood?

Thanks Tony. That worked. In my previous projects with this, I used quotes and the splat to get the desired results... 

Now I wanna go test that script without them... :/

Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1210301613080.22455@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have a large data file that contains duplicate rows. 'uniq' finds those
rows that match character-by-character, but not those who match only on the
first three fields (separated by '|'). There are rows with the same location
ID, date, and chemical that have different concentrations listed, and I need
to cull the duplicated records based on the first three fields after the
file's been sorted on those fields.

   The uniq man page doesn't show me how to do this; the information may well
be there and I'm not seeing it properly.

   Recommendations appreciated.

Rich,

From the above, may I take it that any data other than the first three
fields is irrelevant?  If so, use cut(1) to write those fields,
line-by-line, to a scratch file.  Then sort(1) said file, and use
uniq(1) to delete the duplicate lines.

Just off the top of my head,

uniq also has the "-w" flag, which instructs it to only compare the first N
characters in a line:

       -w, --check-chars=N
              compare no more than N characters in lines


although if your fields are all significantly different in length, it
probably won't work as well as Dale's solution.

Dale,

   Actually, the entire row is relevant, but there may be duplicates in the
first three fields. Technically, each row should be unique, but sometimes
the analytical lab reports strange (and/or inconsistent) results.

Thanks,

Rich

Scott,

   The first field has a varying number of characters, that's why I didn't
use the -w option.

How about (see below) ... would that work with "-u"?
"`-k POS1[,POS2]'
`--key=POS1[,POS2]'
      Specify a sort field that consists of the part of the line between
      POS1 and POS2 (or the end of the line, if POS2 is omitted),
      _inclusive_.

      Each POS has the form `F[.C][OPTS]', where F is the number of the
      field to use, and C is the number of the first character from the
      beginning of the field.  Fields and character positions are
      numbered starting with 1; a character position of zero in POS2
      indicates the field's last character.  If `.C' is omitted from
      POS1, it defaults to 1 (the beginning of the field); if omitted
      from POS2, it defaults to 0 (the end of the field).  OPTS are
      ordering options, allowing individual keys to be sorted according
      to different rules; see below for details.  Keys can span multiple
      fields.

      Example:  To sort on the second field, use `--key=2,2' (`-k 2,2').
      See below for more notes on keys and more examples.  See also the
      `--debug' option to help determine the part of the line being used
      in the sort.
"

Hi Rich,

    print unless $seen{$k}++
  }'

(untested)  That should give you the first instance for each $k, where 
$k is the first three fields.

Fred,

   Thanks. I'll save this for the next time.

Much appreciated,

No, uniq *disregards* rows that match character-by-character.  From
your explanation, I can't tell wtf you are trying to do.  If the whole
row is relevant, fine, use uniq and get all the relevant differences.

Another tried-and-true way of explaining what you are trying to do is to
give an example.

For those of you familiar with wine for running windows programs on
linux this company is responsible for a lot of the contributions to
that software. This is basically wine with an easier to use installer,
and a one year support package.
