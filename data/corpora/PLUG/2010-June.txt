Thanks Eric.

Will the following card work as well as the one you suggested?

There is another auction where the card is supposedly mono only, but I
wonder if this is actually true?

I'm going to try using dscaler with my WinTV PVR 150 card to see if that
resolves the lag problem.

I have never used the Ctrl-Shift-u technique to enter text.  My wife is
Japanese so I have her system set up to use Anthy which is an IME for
japanese.  Before we had to use scim as a backend to Anthy but with 10.04,
that changed to the iBus back end.  It still works like it used to, but
better.  We use KDE not Gnome, but I will try it out to see if I can find
any difficulty. If you can give me some more examples, I will be happy to
try them out.

I would be surprised if it didn't work, but I'm by no means an expert
on these. Possibly I've just had really good luck with them, but it
seems to me that most of them work pretty well.

Unless you're planning on recording video from the input it really
doesn't matter if the card is mono or not. Though all that I've seen
have been stereo. (I guess it might matter for coax cable, but I had
the impression you weren't going to use it for that.) With a
playstation you can use the adapter I linked to and just plug it into
the input of your sound card and bypass the TV card completely if that
works better for you. That way the TV card would only be handling your
video input.

That's worth a look, but I think it was more peculiar to their
software on Windows. I thought you were using some Linux application?
It sure wouldn't take long to test, though.

Have you tried TV Time on it? That's been the easiest, in my experience.

John,

IBus allows this sort of thing, you just have to have the right input
method installed and active.  (IBus is a framework for a large number
of input methods.)  The easiest way is probably to use Yumex and sort
for ibus in All Packages.  Make sure that ibus-gtk and ibus-m17n are
installed, plus any others you might have an interest in (e.g., ibus-qt
for the KDE folks). You'll probably have to re-boot to get it all
running.

Assuming that IBus is running, you should have an icon in the
notification area that looks kind of like a keyboard with a globe in
front of it.  Right click on that and select Preferences.  Select the
Input Methods tab.  From the "Select an input method" drop down, find
"Other" at the bottom of the list.  It will have sub-items of Rawcode,
Latn-Pre and Latn-Post.  The Latn- entries allow for a reasonable set
of European diacritics to be selected, though by no means all of them.
Latn-Pre lets you select the accent before you type the character you
want accented.  Latn-Post is (obviously) the other way around; it also
has a lot more accents available.  I think that what you want, though,
is Rawcode.  (I just tried it -- I'd never used Rawcode before -- and
it seems to work.  Typing a "b" and then <ctrl-shift-u> 324 [on the
numeric keypad] gave me a lowercase b with a dieresis underneath it.)

Anyway, I hope this helps.

I don't see much point to Chrome/Chromium unless it brings along with
it different, more flexible hardware (and I don't know what that might
look like) or more-or-less the same hardware available now (like
netbooks) at considerably reduced prices.  I don't see the point of
installing Chromium on an existing computer, since I don't see the
point of limiting the functionality of existing hardware.  If you have
a netbook with a 160gb hard drive, why would you install an operating
system on it that is designed not to take advantage of that?  If, on
the other hand, newfangled netbooks or pad-like devices with
solid-state drives hit the retail market for $50 preloaded with
Chromium, then I might be interested.

You can pretty much do everything that Chromium promises now, if you
want to, whatever OS you're using.  So the only benefit to an OS that
is limited to what Chromium promises is that somehow it will be a
better value proposition for the consumer.  I'm not sure even Google
can pull that off.

Subject: [PLUG] umask issues with VirtualBox Machine files
Message-ID: <86ljaymh5h.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>


I am setting up a Ubuntu machine on which multiple people share
VirtualBox guest machines.  When guest machines are closed, various
files, particularly in the Machines tree, get stored with the wrong
permissions (0600, rather than 0660 that is needed).  The group
ownership is set up so that newly created files are owned correctly.
Setting umask to 002 doesn't seem to help.

Anybody with experience in this kind of situation?  Potential
solutions?

(omissions for brevity)

Aaron Baer
 From what I read there (correct me if I am wrong) the local content 
appears to be intended to be temporary?  That is, content is intended to 
be on web sites, and only on local computers for working offline and 
(then) putting it back on a web site ... or some version thereof?

The description of the ChormiumOS still seems to be "let's not mess with 
hardware - that is the job of BIOS - and let's have all apps and content 
online somewhere."

OK ... that is a web based thin client, is it not?  If that could be run 
as an in-house thing with no access to the Internet, I should think a 
lot of companies should be interested in it ... if they are not in too 
deep with MS to consider it.

Outside of the business venue (which is a large part of PC computing 
today), is there a large enough audience for something like ChromiumOS 
to warrant the effort (rhetorical question)?

Fred James

"Why no access to the Internet??"
A lot of work done with computers is done in businesses
A lot of that work is sensitive business data
Most businesses I have known or read/heard about are very sensitive 
about that sensitive data - why?
Businesses (today at any rate) run on debt, and 
lenders/stockholders/owners/investors/etc. are very very sensitive about 
that sensitive data - that's why.

I venture (my personal opinion) that sensitivity is a pretty large 
huddle to overcome - I shouldn't suggest that it cannot be overcome, 
after all, what do I know?
Does that help?

Fred James

Russell,

Did you mean to set the parent directory with the GUID bit set? If you 
want files inside the
directory, then chmod the parent directory to 02770.  This will set the 
unix permissions to

 >chmod 02770 .
 >ls -la
drwxrws---  owner group 4895 .
Note the s in place of the x in the group triplet.

So when a file is created by a member of group group, the permisisons 
are set 660.

-rw-rw---- member group 463764  newfile

Caveats: member is member of group group.

Who's on first, anyway.

Yeah, I set the GUID bit, and that handles the group ownership part,
but not the permissions part.  Apparently, somewhere in the bowels of
VirtualBox, the umask for the process is being set to 022 which means
that created files get 0600 permissions (maybe for a good reason),
which is not lenient enough.  I am reading more deeply into the
VirtualBox user manual to see if there is a preferred way to handle
this scenario, or if I just need to hack together somekind of cronjob
to patch things up for me.

So close, and yet so far.

Subject: [PLUG] Having chroot Problems with MySQL and Locales
Message-ID: <AANLkTinvfFRZ5stSsTSQ3bedbSEfUMCysE-fwNXdD-rU@mail.gmail.com>

I have created a 32 bit chroot (Debian Lenny) on my 64 bit Debian Squeeze
machine. I am having a problem installing mysql into this chroot, as well as
a problem with locales.

1. I have run dpk-reconfigure locales, answered all the questions but I
still get locale warnings:
perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").
perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
    LANGUAGE = (unset),
    LC_ALL = (unset),
    LANG = "en_US.UTF-8"
    are supported and installed on your system.

2. MySQL fails the configuration, but there are no error messages to say
what is failing:
Starting MySQL database server: mysqld . . . . . . . . . . . . . . failed!
invoke-rc.d: initscript mysql, action "start" failed.
dpkg: error processing mysql-server-5.0 (--configure):
 subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 1
dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of mysql-server:
 mysql-server depends on mysql-server-5.0; however:
  Package mysql-server-5.0 is not configured yet.
dpkg: error processing mysql-server (--configure):
 dependency problems - leaving unconfigured
Errors were encountered while processing:
 mysql-server-5.0
 mysql-server

I have mounted /proc and /dev/pts to the chroot. Am I missing anything else?
I can't seem to find a good mysql chroot example on the web - many of them
work by installing mysql and then moving it to the chroot (won't for for me
as I have a 64 bit system) or compiling from source. i could do that, but I
was hoping not to have to.

Thanks!

Mark

Mark,

For mysql, did you look at /var/lib/mysql as well.  All the data gets
written there.

There are also log files in /var/log/mysql* and/or /var/log/mysql/* that
you'll need to map into your chroot environment.  Either one could be
stopping mysql from starting.

Tim,

Thanks for your reply. BTW, I fixed the locale problem - no more errors!

I am a little confused about mysql. I created the chroot, and then from
within the chroot I issued apt-get install mysql-server. I expected it to
just install like any other package in lenny. However, I get this (note I
purged mysql-server and mysql-server-5.0, fixed the locale problem, and then
did a fresh install of mysql-server, all from within the chroot):

What do you mean by "mapping /var/lib/mysql"? I can't mount my 64 bit mysql
into this 32 bit chroot. I just want a clean install of 32 bit mysql in my
32 bit chroot jail.

At this point, I am ready to put myself in a chroot jail! ;-)

I fixed the locale problem
Within the chroot, I did this:
[orca:/]#  export LC_CTYPE=C
[orca:/]#  export LC_MESSAGES=C
[orca:/]#  export LC_ALL=C
[orca:/]#  dpkg-reconfigure locales  (for the 5th time!)

  en_US.ISO-8859-1... done
  en_US.ISO-8859-15... done
  en_US.UTF-8... done
Generation complete.

No more locale error messages.

I tried a purge of mysql and then a clean install, and it still fails in the
configuration process and won't start.

In order to help you properly, I would have to try building a 32 bit chroot
on a debian box myself. I won't be able to do that until the weekend. So
here's a shot in the dark:

First run "locale -a". Do you see en_US.utf8 in the list? Good. If not, try
running "locale-gen" and then seeing if "locale -a" returns anything different.

Does your 32 bit filesystem contain a file /etc/default/locale? I see that
in my Ubuntu VM. It contains this line:

LANG="en_US-UTF8"

Try making it look like this:

LANG=en_US.utf8
LC_CTYPE=en_US.utf8
LC_MESSAGES=en_US.utf8
LC_PAPER=en_US.utf8
GDM_LANG=en_US.utf8

(Stay away from LC_ALL if possible; it is for clobbering all your LANG
settings in one felswoop, useful for scripts and such.)

I don't know whether you have to run some command to make changes to this
file "stick". In Gentoo the file would be called /etc/env.d/02locale, and
you'd have to run "env-update". Try logging out and back in(to your chroot),
and see what that does for you. Test the results by running the command
"locale", which will show you your current locale settings.

But I'm not sure that having your locale set to C is a bad thing for a
package installation. Some builds explicitly set the locale with LC_ALL="C"
in the makefile so that the output of the build commands will be predictable
and parseable. Though locale is a big deal once your database is running.

As for the mysql problem, all I can suggest at the moment is to try starting
it manually with the appropriate mysqld command. Maybe use "ps fauxw |grep
mysqld" to see the command line that your "good" mysql is using. Starting
mysql manually from a shell may cause more useful error messages to be
printed to stdout. There may be some debugging options to the mysqld command
as well.

You could locate the mysqld binary and run "file mysqld" to see if it is
really a 32 bit ELF executable. Though it could just as easily be a shell
script. Somewhere in the mysql installation there ought to be some binaries
which would work for this test.

I installed lenny as the chroot.

I got rid of the local problems with some simple setting of evnironment
variables and then running the package configuration. I posted the details
in an earlier email. Thanks for the suggestions!

Running from the command line just gives the failed message. None of the
mysql log files have anything written to them, and the users/groups and
permissions are correct.

Problem solved. I installed syslog-ng to get better logging, and found this
once I tried to start mysql in the chroot:
Jun  2 20:58:00 orca mysqld[19435]: 100602 20:58:00 [ERROR] Can't start
server: Bind on TCP/IP port: Address already in use

The doh! moment of the day......mysql was running on the 64 bit squeeze side
of the chroot jail. Once I stopped it, mysql in the chroot had no problem
starting.

Moral of the story.....install syslog-ng to find the doh! moments...;-)

If you're running a newer kernel you could run it in an lxc container and give it it's own IP address btw.

Subject: [PLUG] ReactOS project verses Linux+WINE...
Message-ID: <1275708397.11971.17.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

The ReactOS people claim that they will come out with a free
reimplementation of Windows NT comparable to XP and later that will be
compatible with existing Windows software.  Sounds great, except the
Linux+WINE approach to running these programs and the LUK project seem
to be poised to produce results faster.

The problem is, it is hard to write an entire operating system and the
supporting utilities from scratch.  I proposed releasing patches for XP
that replace individual DLLS so that eventually all of the proprietary
code is replaced and you end up with a free version of Windows.  The
advantage over what the ReactOS folks are doing is that they would
stop releasing something that doesn't work.  The downside is that the
work won't be freely available until they replace all of Microsoft's
code so that users of the code don't have to acquire a license.

The ReactOS people give up immediately on the idea of patching Windows
despite the potential that has to help people now.  The claim they make
is that it is illegal to replace bits and pieces of Windows with open
source code.  Can Microsoft really go after someone if they legally
acquire Windows XP and replace the kernel with an open source
reimplementation?  Would Microsoft even dare to do that?  I believe that
the DMCA allows reverse engineering for the purpose of ensuring
interoperability and that you can even share improvements so long as
you don't profit from them.

What will Linux+WINE or LUK not support and is this anything worth
worrying about?

I admit that Word 2003 doesn't work right at times in WINE and that 
Warcraft II BNE runs too slowly, but I've just given two examples of
software that you don't even think about running in ReactOS.

Has anyone here had problems with ReactOS moderators and developers?
The group seems like a pack of thugs at times.

Any version of Adobe Creative Suite (consisting of InDesign, Photoshop,

Quickbooks.

Not that I'd install ReactOS just to get those running natively. That's
what virtual machines are for.

Subject: [PLUG] Xsane help, desperate
Message-ID: <20100605014523.4813a638@mailhost.pdx.edu>

I have a Canoscan LiDE 30 scanner which works fine in Linux. I haven't
used it in months. This evening I suddenly need to scan two pages to
send to someone via e-mail, and the recipient is desperate to receive
them. Naturally, Xsane has decided this is the moment to screw me.

The problem:

I cannot figure out how to tell it the page size is 8.5  11. It insists
on scanning only the left side, 3.99 x 11. I cannot find a page size
anywhere in any of the buttons. 

In Preview I once got it to scan the entire page, but could not figure
out how to save the image to file. Subsequently I have not been able to
figure out how I did it. In any event, scanning from the small main
window always scans 3.99 x 11. Adjusting the scan area manually in the
Preview window allows me to change the size area in the small main
window to 8.5 x 11, but when I then scan from the small main window it
reverts to 3.99 x 11.

I have scanned the document a hundred times at least, each time trying
different buttons, but nothing has succeeded in getting the full page.
I hope there is an Xsane expert here who can help.

In xsane, choose Window, and enable "Show Preview" if it isn't already
enabled.

On the preview window, below the image display area, you can choose paper
size from a drop down (A4 = DIN A4 port), US users will want legal or
letter.

Press "Acquire Preview" to see if you've got what you want, then press
"Scan" (in the main window) to actually do the scan.

I have come to the conclusion that it is a bug.

1) I did the above exactly as stated and it still scans only the left
3.99 inches of the page.

2) I installed gscan2pdf and it does the same thing. That is, it shows
the whole page, but most of it is washed out and unusable. But just
before it shows the whole page the page with only the left 3.99 inches
appears for a brief flash.

3) I installed Skanlite (the KDE frontend for sane), and it scans only
the left 3.99 inches.

4) I renamed the ~/.sane folder, and all three front ends still scan
only the left 3.99 inches.

Conclusions: 

1) It's not in my settings.
2) It's not in the GUI front end to sane that I am using.

Furthermore, I used to scan pages and pages with Xsane on Ubuntu and
never had any problem. But this is the first time I have tried to scan
with Fedora 11.

I am currently trying to figure out if it's possible to scan from the
command line. Since doing so would probably still use the sane
libraries I probably will still have no joy, but it's my last hope.

   When you look at the preview there is a dashed rectangle that defines the
area to be included in the scan. Perhaps that rectangle excludes the right
side of the page.

   When I scan a multipage document to produce a .pdf file I always adjust
the rectangle to the same size for each page so the output is consistent.
It's easy to overlook that rectanglep; I know that I did when I first
started using xsane.

Thanks for the suggestion.

I have long known of the dotted rectangle, but adjusting it does not
help. That is, when I first click on Get Preview in the Preview window
it scans only the left 3.99 inches of the page. When I adjust the
rectangle the main window changes the page dimensions to match the new
rectangle. But when I then click on Scan it still scans only the left
3.99 inches, regardless of the dimensions of the new rectangle.

I forgot to say that this is Xsane 0.997 on Fedora 11 x86_64. The other
scanning programs I used (gscan2pdf and Skanlite [KDE]) are alternative
front ends for the same scanning utility.

From previous threads I know there is at least one other owner of a
Canoscan LiDE 30 on the PLUG list. It would be really helpful if
another user could report their results. At least then I can rule out
hardware issues.

I have a LIDE 25 and use XSANE, on Ubuntu 10.4 (32 bit). Xsane works
flawlessly.

I suggest you completely uninstall xsane and then reinstall it.  Otherwise,
if you have a digital camera with a macro setting, you might try that.

Good luck, Pat

John,

   What mode are you using, and what format output do you specify? Do you get
the same results in Save mode (say, .jpg) as with Multipage mode (as a
.pdf)? Does color mode (line art, b&w, full color) make a difference? Is
scan source set to Normal? On the preview window is the left-most button set
to full size?

   It looks to me like a hardware issue if you get only a half-page on both
preview and scan. Do the other front ends work properly?

   I have a HP ScanJet 5200C and an Epson photo scanner and both work with
Xsane-0.996 here.

Rich

I seem to remember different modes like user and professional and only
in the upper two modes could you adjust rectangles

On the man page for the driver for your Scanner, it mentions calibration and
then adjusting the image position via the command line.

I'll try some of those suggestions later, but for the moment I'm pretty
sure it's a hardware issue. (See below.)

> both preview and scan. Do the other front ends work properly?

Just now I tried live CDs of:

Fedora 13 x86_64 Live (wouldn't boot - bah!)
Jaunty x86_64 Desktop which has Xsane 0.996. Same results.
Hardy Xubuntu x86_64, installed Xsane 0.995 from repo. Same results.

I know it used to scan fine in various versions of Ubuntu, Jaunty being
the last I used before going to Fedora 11. Since it now exhibits the
same half-page problem with the same software I used to use, I am
pretty sure the scanner has gone tits up. Or maybe it's repairable. 

For the present job I'll take the form to a commercial place this
morning so the person I need to send it to can get her class
assignment finished. Then I have to go build a house. Later I'll deal
with what's wrong with the scanner.

Thanks to all for the suggestions.

   Have you tried 32-bit versions of live CDs? Would be an interesting
comparison.

I have to agree that it's sounding like a hardware problem.  Apologies 
for pointing out the obvious, but have you unplugged the scanner and 
reconnected it?

For the record, I have a LIDE 20 scanner here.  It works fine with 
xsane under CentOS 5.5.

First caveat: I'm in Corvallis, so you'd pick it up here or meet me at
PDX before a 6:00 am flight.

Second, this thing is perhaps 10 years old.  It's suitable for use as
a router, perhaps a server, or other special purpose but not as a
general purpose machine.  I used it as a router (running LEAF) for a
couple of years, until I replaced it with a PcEngines microbox that
uses enough less power to pay for itself.

What's cool is that it's small, about the size of a Shuttle, and built
like a tank.  The mainboard includes an 8M flash module that's meant
to be its main storage, but the floppy could be replaced with a 3.5"
IDE drive.  The backplane has four ISA slots in addition to the two
occupied by the main board.

Hmmm.  Turns out it, or something very close, is still available:

http://www.advantech.com/products/IPC-6806/mod_1-2JKFUC.aspx

It's very similar to the two on the left, but does not have USB.

Free to anybody who thinks it's worth the trouble....

Thanks for the link. However, the config file already had the x-y
positions at 0. And that is all you can set. That is, you can set the
starting position of the x and y coordinates, but there is no setting
for image area.

The fact that it is scanning the left 3.99 inches just fine leads me to
wonder if it has two eyes and one of them has gone blind.

I only tried Jaunty and Hardy x86_64, live CDs. I wanted to try
Windows, but I have it installed only in VirtualBox OSE. The OSE
version doesn't do USB devices. And all the software I tried are
just different front ends for the same sane scanning program.

It does appear to be a hardware problem, but I haven't given up 100%
yet.

It could be a hw prob. But the fact that it scans almost exactly the left
half of the page makes me think it's either a setting or driver issue. I was
reading about the "stitch" feature and I thought maybe it's setup to do that
but isn't working correctly.

I see you've posted on the Fedora Forums, but what about running the debug
command and then posting on the XSANE Forum?

*export* *SANE_DEBUG_PLUSTEK=20* *;* *xscanimage*

**The value controls the verbosity of the backend. Please note, that
val-ues  greater  than 24 force the backend to output raw data
files,which could be rather large. The  ending  of  these  files  is
".raw". For problem reports it should be enough the set the verbosity
to 13.

The conclusions would be different.  At work I asked about a means to 
connect with Win servers that is lighter than RDP.  (Telnet is prohibited)

He reply included mentioning on Win2008 he now has to do some Exchange 
management via CLI (200 character command lines in his report) instead of
a few clicks.

It always worked fine with all x86_64 versions of Ubuntu through
Jaunty. Just now I plugged it into my desktop with Intrepid x86_64 and
got the same results. 

The only non-hardware possibility is that there is firmware inside the
device which has somehow become goobered up. The scan bar that travels
back and forth under the glass is fully lit up as before. 

This morning I finally found Canon's tech support e-mail service. I
asked if I could get a service manual or if there is a repair depot
somewhere. But I paid $90 for it brand new several years ago, so it's
not worth spending a lot of money to repair. Used ones sell for $10-$30
on eBay.

Though I live in Corvallis and travel to the Portland area every
couple of weeks or so to see family, so I wouldn't mind ferrying it up
that way for someone. They live on the east side, but I could also
meet someone down near the freeway before I head east on 205 from I-5.

In one of the threads I read, someone mentioned buying the scanner at
Goodwill for like
$5. So it might be worth a trip there and FreeGeek is just around the
corner...

I got a response. The good news is that they responded very quickly,
even on Sunday.

The bad news is that the person responding did not read past the first
sentence of my e-mail. In the first sentence I said that it was
scanning only the leftmost 3.99 inches of the page. This was followed
by all the different computers I tried it on, all the troubleshooting I
did, and followed by a request for a service manual or location of a
repair depot. The response was:

>Thank you for your inquiry.  We value you as a Canon customer and 
>appreciate the opportunity to assist you.  We regret to hear that your 
>CanoScan LiDE 30 is not scanning the complete document.

Doesn't it just piss you off when someone patronizes you?

Wait, I just figured it out. At the bottom of the e-mail is a tagline:

>Special Note: Certain issues are very difficult to resolve via email.  
>If you would prefer to speak to a technician for additional
>assistance*, you may call our special toll-free number for email
>customers with unresolved issues by dialing 1-866-261-9362, Monday -

>
>*Telephone support for products no longer covered under the 
>manufacturer's warranty may require a $9.99 fee for support.

So that's the game. Reply with a non-answer to the customer's e-mail so
the customer will be forced to pay $9.99 to talk to a human.

I guess I'm shopping for a new scanner.

Yah.  Leave it to MS to find a way to make a fully-featured command-line
environment (PowerShell) painful to use.  And it's SO SLOOOOW!

Understandable, though, given that *nix has always been CLI, and had to
funcion well that way, and Windows and its "ecosystem" is new to it.

Last time I had to do any significant system automation on Windows, I
fought with PowerShell for a few days, then gave up and decided to use
AutoHotKey and just simulate mouse/keyboard events in the GUI instead.

Learning to automate OS installs and system management are the 2 biggest
bang-for-buck uses for a sysadmin's time, and learning to to it on Windows
as well as on a couple major Linux distros (and maybe BSD or Solaris) is a
ticket to being a *great* sysadmin.

Besides licensing, security and additional hardware expense, the big cost of
running Windows is the additional admin labour.

Unfortunately, it's hard to get paid twice the salary for learning to be as
useful as 2 sysadmins.

This device isn't meant to be used as a stand-alone server, but rather
provide network connectivity to any electronic device that can
interface with the pins coming out the bottom (not shown):
http://www.nkcelectronics.com/lantronix-xport-ar-to-breadboard-adapter.html

With a little soldering, you just might be able to hook a couple of
these together to build your, albeit severely underpowered, inline
firewall.

yes, but the MS-DOS command languagewas sooo limited compared to its 
*IXen contemporaries - especially for scripting -  that it was truly 
pitiful from the beginning. The current standard MS-Win command shell 
isn't much of an improvement.

What is your application? For some applications, such as a developer
"sandbox," a Xen or Virtualbox server is a good route. For specialized
purposes, BSD "jails" are highly efficient and reliable.


Very Best,

Joe,

   I no longer recall what company sold a suite of UNIX work-alikes for DOS,
but I bought the set and used it extensively. Made it difficult to work in
plain DOS. :-)

Would that be the good 'ol MKS Toolkit from Mortice Kern Systems? it was 
pretty sweet back in the early 90's. i've used Cygwin in the last few 
years when stuck on MS Win, but it still feels like showering with a 
raincoat on... sh and bash run into paradigm collisions sooner or later 
when running atop DOS and its offspring.

Probably MKS Toolkit.  Almost made DOS tolerable.  Almost.

That's quite a mouthful.  Can you describe what you mean by that?

You might be talking about linux-vserver, which, like BSD's "jails",
isolates applications from each other without using virtual machines.
In that case, you could search for a Linux-vserver HOWTO.

Thank you for the responses.  A friend back east is about to go live with many users accessing a virtual server.  This cuts down on cost and keeps maintanance centralized.

My image is that my windows user would each have a sandbox? From where they would run their programs.  Yes this would include Word and some windows only programs that do not work under Wine.  

The client or terminal in the individual offices can be replaced because they only have a client on them.

I am already have a virtual webserver hosting several  websites using apache.

This response from the company that hosts a VM image for me.
Most
(read: all other that I have found and checked out) limit you to XX GB per
month based on your plan.?? The plan described is for two shares,
their mimimum purchase, costing ~$38 a month.? ~$38 because the fee is

Hello Michael, 

Thank you for contacting Gandi support team. 

The bandwith limit
for one share will provide you 5 Mb/s for data transfer, and
you will be
limited to 2Tb of data transfer per month, and per share. 

If you
add some more shares in your hosting account, this would increase that
limit, and will allow you to transfer more data on your server. 

I am at your disposal should you need any further information.

I ordered an LGA 775 socket fan/heatsink combo and I can't seem to use
it with the Intel D945Gcz board I picked up.  I have a hunch that since
I can't get the copper plate down on the processor that I don't have
adequate thermal conductivity.  There is this plastic piece and the
aluminum screws into it, but that makes no sense.  The plastic piece
covers some of the pins on the processor.  I'm debating on whether or
not to cut the screws off that are used to hook on the plastic piece.
I'm beginning to wonder if that is what you are supposed to do.

Another problem I ran into with the micro BTX case I'm trying to install
this board in is that the ATX power connector won't reach.  Is there an
extender for that that I can pick up or am I looking at an unsightly
modification?  

What should I use to glue the processor to the copper part of the
heatsink?

BTX, as far as I know, is it's own beast. You need a BTX heat sink/fan 
combo, a BTX power supply, and the motherboard must be BTX as well.

For the most part, ATX <> BTX compatibility is a crap shoot.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTX_%28form_factor%29 for more 
information.

First, I agree on trying to mix ATX & BTX, you would better served going
with all one or the other.  If all your components are ATX and only your
case is BTX, you should really consider getting an ATX case.  You can get a
basic one for not too much $$.

Second, you should not have to cut anything off to install the heatsink,
perhaps you have the wrong type for your board.  The heatsink should have a
manual or at least an instruction sheet for proper installation.
It is possible, there is a plate with screw holes that mounts underneath the
motherboard, and the screws go through the motherboard and through the plate
on the bottom.  Usually this plate is metal.

You do not "glue" the heatsink to the CPU.  However there is usually a
thermal paste compound that you apply to the CPU, so that when you install
the heatsink on top, it will fill in any small areas that do not contact,
and helps promote thermal conductivity between the CPU and the heatsink.  It
can seem kind of like glue, but trust me you don't want to use actual glue
;)  Most heatsinks will come with something, either a small tear open tube
of thermal compound, or a small square piece of something kind of like
paper, and that is a thermal "strip" and usually will work, but from my
experience the paste compound works better.

Also do not over torque the screws for the heatsink, you want it snug, but
not "farm tight" (i.e. keep tightening until it won't move anymore, and then
one more twist for luck...).

HTH, YMMV, My $0.02, etc.

That motherboard doesn't use a standard LGA775 heatsink. My guess is 
that's what you're using. That board requires this:

http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=220475199060

As it fits the holes in the board and allows the screws to thread into 
the case.

ATX power supplies are compatible with BTX mobo's, so an extender is fine.

If you want this to fail and ruin a heatsink and possibly the processor 
then yes, do that. You should probably find someone knowledgeable to 
help you with this project. Your post is screaming the kind of 
inexperience that is going to destroy parts.

The power supply is BTX, but these power supplies are so similar to ATX
that I called it an ATX power supply.

Thanks for the tip on where I can get the right heatsink.  Fortunately,
the motherboard shuts off if the processor gets too hot.  I went ahead
and broke the tabs off of the heatsink and was able to make good contact
with the processor allowing it to cool adequately.  I've thought about
using silicon to glue the processor to the heat sink, but maybe I should
just get the right heatsink.  I've gotten through 14 runs of memtest, so
I know that the processor is cooling okay right now.

We are honored to have local Perl expert and OSCON presenter Eric
Wilhelm and visiting OSCON keynote presenter Paul Fenwick talk aobut
gems you may have been missing in Perl 5 and 6.

Eric will present an overview of the Perl 6 project, a snapshot of
recent development, how to install Rakudo Perl 6, and samples of what
you can  do with Rakudo Perl 6 now.

Paul writes: Awesome things have been happening in Perl recently; so
many that even if you've been paying close attention, you may have
missed a few. In this talk we'll examine some of the coolest recent
technologies for Perl programmers, including:

* Overhauling Perl's Object Oriented framework with Moose.

* Making everything a first-class object with autobox.

* Slashing your error handling code with autodie.

* Building fast, readable and reusable regular expressions with Perl 5.10.

* Bundling and building stand-alone applications using PAR, the Perl
Archiver.

* Astonishingly good profiling with Devel::NYTProf.

* Playing MineSweeper automatically with App::SweeperBot.


Thank you Brian Martin for coordinating this event while Michael is out
of town.

The LGA socket encloses the processor. If you glued the heatsink on, 
you'll likely never get the cpu out without destroying the socket.

Hey Dave,

I've worked for the Psoriasis Foundation for several years - I am close
friends with their former "acting" president - and think they are a nice
group of folks. Plus - they are within walking distance - at the
intersection of Garden Home / Scholls Ferry & Allen Blvd. Their IT guy
Travis just served notice - he's going to Afganistan to do IT in the defense
industry (what is he thinking?).

If you know of anybody who is interested - here's a link to a craigslist ad.
I know they want full-time, regular but they might need a transition support
person. They are mainly PC - mainly windows / MS based - though I work on
their Linux platforms.

Brian

Please pass this along to any IT guys you know who might be interested.

Ok, I'm getting into the discussion a few days late, but a few thoughts:
 1) I looked for years, for a local & inexpensive provider, or a co-op. Portland is a difficult market for colocation, and most local providers charge a pretty-penny for space.

 2) Renting cabinets and then sharing amongst a community is a difficult prospect for providers. IINet no longer allows 24/7 access to customers hosting with less than a 1/3 cabinet, and you are restricted to the number of folks with keys/access (2, IIRC). The Pittock rates start at 1/3 cabinets, and Easystreet...I don't know how they handle smaller colocation arrangements. Then there's issues of various other people having 24/7 and unsupervised access to your physical datacenter assets.

 3) Since I got fed up with waiting for #1, we dove in and leased a Pittock cabinet...found the 1st one filled shortly thereafter, so some shameless self-promotion follows (yes, an ad follows, please light your torches).

I run TOCICI, and having been raised in Portland (Parkrose), I'm as local as you can get. I'm an active business association member, the geek side of me has been an accomplished Linux-loving SysAdmin since the mid-90's, and I've largely been a PLUG-lurker for nearly as long  :-)

Aside from the regular fare of IT Consulting services, TOCICI provides:
 - Hosting/Leasing of IBM brand servers.
 - Colocation services out of the downtown Portland Pittock.
 - VPS hosting primarily with OpenVZ (www.buildyourvps.com) and VMWare.

While our current data-services provider is multi-homed we're turning-up a 2nd 100Mbit circuit in a few days. At that time we'll also be taking advantage of a recently acquired ASN from ARIN & start publicly announcing our routes over BGP.

Rates and other info are on the websites:
 Colocation & Leasing: www.tocici.com/services-colocation.html
 VPS Offerings: www.buildyourvps.com

For what its worth, while we're one of the least expensive colocation providers in the Portland area, a major portion of our overhead is tied up in the cost of power/cooling services, not in the cost of space itself. We're currently playing with the idea of a pay-per-watt structure, and if there's sufficient interest around here, I'm up for discussing terms offlist.

Other offhand providers:
 * I was a client of IINet for around 7 years...one of their larger last-mile business bandwidth consumers at one point. We left after repeated datacenter and wireless network related core-competency failures that spanned over the course of several years...you've been warned.

 * Easystreet can be expensive, but they are great local folks to work with.

 * We've also worked with Forked.net in the past: great guys, smart and very capable. They also moved from IINet to the Pittock at about the same time we did.

 * Did I mention that TOCICI is really cool?  :-)

I'll 2nd SQL-Ledger; it's a great option if you stay on-top of code updates and revisions, and if you're ready to dive into the nitty-gritty details of accounting and app customizations. My accountant never had issues with it; just dependent on me to write and run the right reports. He does payroll too! :-)

A number of my clients are accountants, and while many seem to greatly dislike Quickbooks, it's less with the specific app, and more how people muck with the structure that Intiut/Quickbooks provides. A few of my clients even go so-far as to assert that many businesses can be run from a well-setup spreadsheet - I'm not that brave. The structure of Quickbooks strikes me as great for someone not strong in accounting and needing to focus more on their business. SQL-Ledger is awesome when there's accessible accounting knowledge, in environments with needs and resources for customizations.

While I have a number of years in SQL-Ledger, the growing and varied code forks have left me with a bitter taste. I've since started looking for other, "simpler", solutions that better fit my business model (IT Consulting & Datacenter Hosting). I've been evaluating Simple Invoices (www.simpleinvoices.org) for the past ~9months and having survived one tax season, I'm still quite happy with it.

Extending Simple Invoices is also proving far easier than SQL-Ledger...but then that statement is based on my specific skills, available time, and continuing business needs, so YMMV.

The idea of importing all my SQL-Ledger data...not so happy about that.

Gregg,

   There is only one fork: LedgerSMB. Armaghan Saqib takes Dieter's SL
releases and modifies them with his enhancements and bug fixes. I've moved
from the plain SL to Armaghan's Ledger123 and found it much better.

   One of the kewel tools added to L123 is LedgerDoctor, a perl script that
looks for orphaned transactions and records. It can be run from the command
line or from within the application. A huge benefit to cleaning up previous
messes.

   The bug fixes are great, especially when it's something I've found and
it's quickly fixed.

   I use it for my consulting business and now know how to handle working on
retainer, billing time-and-expenses, and on a flat fee for the project. The
time cards work flawlessly (you can enter seconds if you keep time that
tightly) and Armaghan's enhancements and explanations of how to do things
has been a tremendous help.

   Consider looking at it again ... the ledger123 version, that is.

Rich

As I watched the fallout and initial code forks which stemmed from security-related vulnerabilities, a seemingly very uneven landscape started to emerge. Combined with developer spats, code forks, and claims of a planned complete rewrite, it all just left me rattled and stalling further investments towards all things SQL-Ledger. Albeit this was years ago, the taste remained.

Last time I really dug into researching where SQL-Ledger stood, I found references to Oratio, LX Office ERP, OpenLedger, LedgerSMB, Ledger123, LedgerDoctor, SQL-Ledger, and SLpos. The most promising option at the time (LedgerSMB) had a website that was around six months out of date, and when re-checking in December, the only new postings were 9 month-old screenshots for a "to be released" version and some compile instructions (I was mostly looking for documentation at the time). This was all despite regular SQL-Ledger releases throughout most of that time. I had started to wonder if the LedgerSQL fork had been abandoned.

Maybe it was just poor visibility into the project's status, and general confusion around what was a fork, and what's really more an enhancement, but not necessarily a complete code fork or rewrite. The whole SQL-Ledger thing is a really unfortunate series of events - I love the idea of an OpenSource ERP toolkit, but this confusion really shatters my confidence in the long-term viability of a complex and critical business tool.

Aside from a few days of research, is there a recent writeup/article or presentation out there which helps better sort some of this out?

Interesting. Although I'm confused, Ledger123 seems like a code fork, while LedgerDoctor sounds like a nifty maintenance add-on. It also looks like the Ledger123 folks have a release called LedgerCart, which is listed as _converting_ an existing SQL-Ledger install to a shopping cart app. Is it really converting my SQL-Ledger install, or is it more an add-on which only adds shopping cart hooks/functions/interfaces into an existing SQL-Ledger install?

That's worth something. My past experiences with SQL-Ledger didn't reflect this level of support. In-fact it seems further SQL-Ledger releases are no longer open-source licensed (see: http://www.ledger123.com/2010/02/clarification-regarding-sql-ledger-development/ ). How does that impact the various existing forks/alternatives/plugins/extensions?

I'm seriously not trying to be a PITA, but, this is confusing to someone who's tried to follow things over the years. I can just imagine a newbie taking one serious look at SQL-Ledger, then running away confused and dismayed.

Sounds like I need to sit down for a few days, and dig into another round of research...where's my 26-hour clock? ;-)

Occasionally when I boot my machine it hangs at the Ubuntu screen.  Pressing
the power button is the only cure.  Restarting usually goes fine.
 Sometimes there is an on-screen message which goes much too fast to read.
 I managed to take a video of the screen once when this occurred.  When I
get the failure,  I get the usual startup message: Boot from hd0.0 ext3 ...
 That stays on the screen for what seems like an unusually long time, then
the message "...nForce2_Smbus 0000:00:01.1: Error probing SMB2.  Starting up

I looked in the dmesg for this, and I find:

ThinkPads are our recommended model for Linux. (I steer toward Dell 
for Windows.) We've got various Linux distributions running on T41s, 
T60s, T61s, X61s and X200s. Obviously the T410 isn't in that list...

Still, Linux installs cleanly on all of them. Ubuntu works quite well. 
CentOS, Fedora, Debian, Gentoo, and Arch work great, but there are 
sometimes binary drivers that need to be retrieved and installed from 
unofficial sources. I can't speak to Slackware.

The only consistent problem we have is X interacting (or failing to 
interact) with the docking station. Docked is fine. Undocked is fine. 
Transitioning is sometimes fine, sometimes not. It's hard to predict.

Lenovo's ThinkPad service is much improved, IMO, over IBM's. My 
impression was that IBM's tech-support representatives wanted to blame 
me every time I called. Lenovo's reps have all wanted to help. On one 
occasion, despite a next-business-day warranty, I had to wait several 
days for a part shipment. Otherwise, Lenovo service has been snappy.

I'm kind of interested in a smaller sized laptop myself.  I like the 10 hour battery life my atom netbook gives me but I wish I could find one that had a display that was higher resolution than 1024x600.  

Other than the screen resolution the netbooks are awesome when paired with a dual quad core server at home hosting virtual desktops (it's amazing how much more battery life a notebook gets when it doesn't need a bunch of power hungry components to do it's job)

   Has anyone here experience with the Lenovo T410 and linux? I'm looking to
replace my Sony Vaio and prefer a smaller screen, business oriented unit
rather than the oversize, wide models that appear more suited to movies and
gaming.

   Recommendations for other brands and models very welcome.

I have Ubuntu Lucid (10.04) running without issue on a Dell D610 and a 
Gateway NX570X.

The Dell isn't widescreen, but the resolution is classified HD in some 
circles (1400x1050). It also has a 1.86GHz CPU and up to 2GB RAM. 
Wireless and IR are supported out-of-the-box, as is bluetooth and every 
USB stick I connected. It also has a smart card reader, but I haven't 
played with that yet. I got this from Goodwill of all places, but it's 
also at Budget for $299 (or was last I checked).

The Gateway is widescreen but with lower resolution per inch (1280x800, 
I think), which I don't prefer (I find that most of the widescreen 
displays are either 600 or 800 pixels tall, at least on the 
reasonably-priced models last I checked, which really doesn't leave much 
space after subtracting panel heights. But they sell, so I guess they 
will continue to be manufactured). It has a dual-core 32-bit Intel CPU 
at 1.6GHz. WiFi and bluetooth also supported. This was donated to me 
with a hinge problem.

I've hit 8-9h on an extended battery with my X61t.  My model has a
particularly high res screen (1400x1050?), but the X200's seem to have
similar battery life, and they are much easier to find.

Some are tired of hearing me say this, but they are no longer
making business oriented laptops - that is, somewhat more
suitable for editing 8.5x11 pages and vertically oriented content.
The current crop are, as you note, more suited to movies and
gaming, which are loser time sinks, IMHO.  You won't advance
green tech, cure poverty, or get rich watching movies.

All the new laptops are "wide screen", that is, screens with
the top two inches removed so they can get two screens out of
a piece of glass.  Rather than accurately name them "short"
or "runt" screens, they call them "wide".  The T410 is one of
these, a 14.1 inch screen with less square inches than the
previous 4:3 aspect ratio 14.1 inch screens.  Sigh.

I purchase used 15 inch 4:3 T60s and replace the 1024*768 or
1280*960 screens with reprogrammed aftermarket 2048*1536 screens. 
There are issues with some applications that choke on so many
pixels, but most Linux apps handle this better than Windoze apps.
It still lets me see the apps designed for widescreen.  This may
be a little too much of a science project for your needs, though.

                                    8.5x13 (w/banner) pages
                                    scaled vertically
               X in.  Y in.   in2    scale   #horiz.
14.1 in. 4:3   11.3   8.5    95.4    0.65    2.03
14.1 in. wide  12.3   6.9    85.0    0.53    2.72
15.0 in. 4:3   12.0   9.0   108.0    0.69    2.03

The 14.1 wide takes up more sideways desk space than the 15.0
4:3.

Who needs more than 2 up side-by-side?  If someone develops a
good word processing program with the controls and banners on
the side, then the wide screens won't be as disadvantaged. 

I am mystified that these wider, shorter screens are accepted in
east Asian countries with vertical writing systems.  Although
the ideograms can also be displayed horizontally, proofing an
output page must be a pain in the butt.

Another one in the market. After 4 years, this Dell e1405 is getting
creaky. I gather the T41s and T60s/T61s are no longer sold by Lenovo (or
I can't find them), and the X200s seem a bit small. 

I've thought of the T410, but hear they've gone away from Magnesium.
Does that mean Lenovo has sacrificed their durability?

I've actually found myself thinking Macbook...

Thanks,
Mike

My previous rant on screen width reminded me - are there any
programs that work like xterm but bring up two or more windows,
one scrolling into the other, like two-column mode in word
processors?  This would be nice for working on long ascii
documents.

Tigerdirect in Summer '07 and it's still going strong. The fan developed
some noise about 9 mths ago due to Lenovo using cheap bearings from what I
heard.

Seems to work well w. most Debian. Although the Radeon video drivers w. the
'Buntus exhibited some weird display behavior where if I moved the lid too
much the screen was just a bunch of colored unorganized pixels and I had to
reboot.

This has never occurred w. any Debian distro. I tried Arch a few times, but
always had probs w. install and/or running. Opensuse ran well on it too, but
I ddn't care for it. Never tried Slack or Gentoo, but as I mentioned in an
earlier post, there's plenty of sites where people document their experience
w. Thinkpads and Linux distros.

Mike,

   I'm looking very seriously at a HP Pavillion dm4t. I increased the memory
and battery sizes, specified the 320G/7200rpm drive instead of the 160G SSD
drive, and specified the Intel wifi chip:

     * Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-430M Dual Core processor (2.26GHz, 3MB L2 Cache)
 	with Turbo Boost up to 2.53GHz
     * 4GB DDR3 System Memory (2 Dimm)
     * 320GB 7200RPM SATA Hard Drive with HP ProtectSmart Hard Drive
 	Protection
     * Intel(R) HD Graphics
     * 14.0" diagonal High-Definition HP BrightView LED Display (1366 x 768)
 	-For HP Mobile Broadband WWAN
     * SuperMulti 8X DVD+/-R/RW with Double Layer Support
     * HP TrueVision Webcam + Fingerprint Reader + Digital Microphone
     * Intel Wireless-N Card
     * Full-size island-style keyboard
     * 9 Cell Lithium Ion Battery (over-sized)

   The price is $835 with free 5-8 day shipping. I also did not list all the
M$ that will immediately be scrubbed off the drive.

Keith,

   My incidental ressearch finds that the HP 14" screen has the same 1366x768
pixel resolution as the "wide" screens (e.g. 15.6"). I would probably need
+6 diopter reading glasses to read 2048x1536 pixels, even on a 15" screen.

   The Acer 19" wide screen monitor I use on this workstation/monitor has a
resolution of 1440x900 and this works well for me. While I've not seen
1366x768 on a 14" monitor I suspect it will be visually similar to this
desktop system.

   You are correct that I won't invest the time for hardware hacking on a
portable.

Rich

Latitude E4300. Freaking awesome. My E6500 and this new E4300 I got (for 
mom but had to have some play time) work 100% with Ubuntu. The backlit 
keyboard, the ambient light sensor, bluetooth, webcam, all core 
components, everthing. Very sturdy and a 3 year warranty included. Sorry 
I sound like a commercial. I love it.

   Well, it's the Intel wireless chips or the HP ones. I suspect the Intels
are well supported in linux. I'm also assuming that what they mean by
Wireless-N is backward compatibility with a/b/g as well as n.

   You ought to see what they write about the Microsoft stuff. If you want
Turbo Boost, pour espresso on the keyboard.

Split vim windows? Not as flexible as a terminal emulator, but fine
for editing text (if vim is your thing).

I just don't get reasoning. I have a hi-res display as well, like you, 
but widescreen at 1920x1200. I can easily read two 8.5x11 documents on 
my screen, side by side, with the menu at the top. It's all very legible 
to someone like you and me who appreciate the pixels.

A word of caution -- don't go buying a bunch of monitors assuming this
will work for you.  It might, but try it in person first :)

I do use a rotate screen, but it's proven to only be useful in very
specific scenarios.  In my experience, the effective horizontal
viewing angle is much, much more restricted when the screen is rotated
that way.  It's bad enough that I can't really do graphics work on a
rotated display since the same color on one side of the screen will
appear to be at least a few shades off from the same color on the
other side.

It works great for text if you're looking straight at it though :)
(And tablet screens seem much, much better at handling rotations than
the desk-mount LCDs I've used.)

No, I want a general purpose text terminal.  The vim capability is
OK, but ls -l, email, less, man pages, command line error output,
and many other text apps can run on for pages.  Yes, I can capture
the session to a file and look at that in vim (or with less, in
multiple windows), but it is a poor substitute, especially given that
modern screens are not so tall and bunches of characters wide.

That, sir, is not a laptop.  When you stand a laptop on its right
edge, you can read it, but when you type sideways, your arms hurt
and it tends to fall down.  

How much 8.5x11 content creation do you do?  Any math, special
symbols, etc.?  How old are you?  You can duplicate the over-40
effect by backing up two times your normal distance and trying
to read it from there.   For over 60, back up three times.

   I need to upgrade my server/workstation to Slackware-13.0 and -13.1, and
will install -13.1 on the Dell Latitude E5410 I just ordered (when I wipe
the pre-installed crud off the drive). I might as well bite the bullet now
and move from the 32-bit distribution version to the 64-bit one.

   Preferring that the transition not bite me back, particularly on my main
machine, I'd appreciate pointers to documents that will teach me what to
expect from the transition. My server/workstation has much data, and many
installed applications that are not part of the Slackware distribution. The
distribution-specific questions I'll get answered by those experts, but I'd
like to prepare by learning what, in general, I should expect.

   I've not found a 32-bit to 64-bit HOWTO, so pointers from you experienced
folks will be very helpful.

When you get older, you will hopefully "get reasoning".  

I will explain it again, slowly.  Many of us - vital to the economy
that keep you alive - are older than you, or were born with worse 
vision.  Visual acuity drops with age. 

Yes, YOU can easily read two 8.5x11 documents, side by side, with
room to spare on the side.  However, if you give me a buck for 
everyone on your city block who can't, because they are not blessed
with your young and good eyes, I will have enough for dinner at a
fine restaurant. 

Imagine (again this involves thinking about the needs of other
people, something some programmers or young people do not understand)
that you cannot SEE individual pixels on a 1920x1200 screen, because
they are too small.  Text becomes lines of grey.  Try reading your
screen from two times further away than normal (if you are under 30)
or three times further away (if you are under 20).  That is how
it looks to a 60 year old.  Measure with a tape measure, please,
at 3x normal distance most laptop screens look like postcards.

Imagine that the emergency room doctor trying to save your life
cannot see vital information on a screen they are reading.  The
doctor made the silly mistake of getting old (after spending a 
long time in school and residency and gaining experience).  Some
very important people necessary to your personal survival do not
have your visual acuity.

Or imagine you design a screen of tiny text for public consumption.
And then you personally get stripped of assets in an Americans With
Disabilities Act lawsuit.  Right now today, many programmers are
designing displays in violation of that law, and sometimes it catches
up with them.

A general rule of thumb is that the needed point size increases
linearly with age.  Retina cells die, eye lenses cloud and 
become rigid and less focusable.  For a presentation on a 1024x768
computer projector,  Guy Kawasaki teaches us to divide the age of
the oldest important person in the room by two, and that is the
minimum effective font size.  60 years old?  Minimum 30 point. 
I never use less than 40 for text I expect to be seen. 
My presentations work.

Yes, I can put 20 xterms on my screen, with fonts that even you
would need a magnifying glass to see.  My pixels are tiny, so I
devote a bunch of them to each character.  Fewer jaggies makes
text more readable.  Some really bad code is written with hardwired
small fonts, though.  Such programmers should be legally restrained
from getting closer than 100 feet to a computer.

And for those of us that are old enough to have learned arithmetic
in school, we can actually do the numbers and learn that there are
a lot of useless pixels on the side of your two vertically scrunched
pages on your runt screen.  I included those numbers in the message
you are responding to, but apparently they went right over your head. 
Two pages fit on my 4:3 screen also.  What good are the extra pixels
to the side of your two pages?  

Do you spend lots of time watching movies and playing games?  If
so, I can see the attraction of a wider screen.  However, while
you are wasting time, some of us are working hard to keep things
running and people like you alive.  When you make it too hard for
us, perhaps we will stop diverting resources towards your survival.

Think about others as distinct individuals, not clones of yourself. 
Besides being the right thing to do, it makes you more employable,
because the code you write will be usable by more people than yourself.

Keith

Now that I have a machine I can use for testing I thought I'd see if 
things changed with Ubuntu Jaunty. They haven't. I still got

Failed to start scanner: Invalid argument.

when I tried to acquire a preview with xsane.

As before, I noticed that xsane saw my scanner and correctly identified 
it. Other traffic related to xsane encouraged me to dig further. I 
searched for "Failed to start scanner: Invalid argument." with Google 
and eventually ended up subscribing to the sane-devel mailing list. 
After asking the question there it was recommended that I run 
sane-find-scanner as root and report the message. Additionally, the same 
email recommended:

If it shows a line containing epson2, you could try editing
/etc/sane.d/dll.conf, and '#' the epson2 line, and remove any '#' in
front of the epson line, and try scanning again.

The output of sane-find-scanner did not contain epson2, but I followed 
up on the recommendation to edit dll.conf. Sure enough, epson was 
commented out in favor of epson2. I reversed the commenting, tried 
again, and the scanner now works!

I sent the test message because a message I tried to send didn't make it 
to the list. This evening I copied all the text of that message, pasted 
it into gedit, copied it and pasted it into a fresh message in T-Bird. 
That message made it through.

The only thing I can think of is that the original message included 
pastes taken from Firebird looking at the Plug archives. Some of the 
characters came with some formatting, which T-Bird kept, and which went 
away when I filtered them through gedit.

A win for Linux, Novell and a wonderful defeat to those who use patent

I need to track down the link on the howto Rich but there is a way to
run Slackware in both 32 and 64 bit side by side so you an run either
set of packages without worrying about the arch it was compiled for
which might make for an easier transition.

This isn't the one I was thinking of but this also accomplishes the
same thing http://www.hydronitrogen.com/374/slackware-13-0-and-13-1-multilib-quick-and-easy-script/

   None on the new host. I've no idea what to expect on the existing
server/workstation. That's why I asked.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikbd1jRlp1NdaOlcR-FAYkZa-EX7gUPCimHwi0J@mail.gmail.com>

(Resend.  Wednesday's send did not get through.)

Occasionally when I boot my machine it hangs at the Ubuntu screen.  Pressing
the power button is the only cure.  Restarting usually goes fine.
 Sometimes there is an on-screen message which goes much too fast to read.
 I managed to take a video of the screen once when this occurred.  When I
get the failure,  I get the usual startup message: Boot from hd0.0 ext3 ...
 That stays on the screen for what seems like an unusually long time, then
the message "...nForce2_Smbus 0000:00:01.1: Error probing SMB2.  Starting up
..." appeared.

I looked in the dmesg for this, and I find:
...

This error message appears in dmesg every time, with and without the
failure, so it may be unrelated.

Ideas?

If you use Skype, be in for a tough time getting it to work correctly
in 64bit land.

In usual Sun fashion of being behind the times, you may run into
difficulties with the JRE (browser plugin, crypto modules).  Most of
these issues seem to have been resolved more recently.  I do some
whacky stuff with Java now and then, so I still have trouble, but
maybe you won't run into any.  There is always the OpenJDK which
usually works.

You'll definitely want 32bit libc/et al emulation running.  I know how
to do this in Debian, but I'm sure the slackware experts can help you
there. 

HTH,

   Drew pointed me to step-by-step instructions on how to install both the
32-bit and the 64-bit Slackwares (13.0 and 13.1) so applications can run on
either. Quite slick ... slick Slack? Nah! :-)

Thanks,

"usually" except when developing Java - some IDEs and build tools can't 
really use OpnJDK.

On the other hand, it's easy to download the 32-bit jdk/jre and point to 
that.

Still housecleaning, and I'm stuck on a shelf of old computer books.
I can imagine a full set (24" worth) of books on Java circa 1998 would
be invaluable to a hardcore java programmer who didn't have an internet
connection, but is there anybody like that?  Is there anybody, or any
entity, in the Corvallis or PDX area that might want 10-year-old books
on java, ARM, Sparc and 68K architectures, and assorted textbooks?

Thanks,

I wonder if this could be done with screen -- could you run a screen
session in the "active" terminal, then view that session from another
terminal, and set it to display the scrollback content from the
"active" terminal?  (some minor exploration hasn't confirmed that this
is possible... but it sure seems like it should work.)

Screen can also log to a file, and that could be processed by a simple
tail / cat-like app to show all but the last n-lines, to correspond to
the other terminal's height.

You could try Free Geek. they have a Reference Library. Although these books
might not reflect current practices, they might serve as a good starting
point, reference for someone.

I also received your message, and I've also seen very similar messages
on my computer about 'error probing smb2' but I have no ideas to help
you. (I'm running 10.04 Ubuntu.)

Mine generally runs fine, but about 1 in 10 boots I get a message
about init freaking out and I have to reboot. So far that's been the
extent of my problem. This is a Wubi install, because my wife refuses
to let me mess with her school work computer while she's still
finishing her thesis, for some strange reason..... :)

are not open, you may feel free to contact me and I will take them from you
and deliver them to Free Geek for you.

I'm network root booting an LFS system okay, but I don't have LVM
support so I can't support mounting logical volumes like the ones that
CentOS creates.  For various reasons I don't want to image the hard
drive.  How hard is it to add LVM support to a linux from scratch
system?

Have you tried asking on the LFS mailing list or the diy-linux list?

Larry,

You will have to add LVM support to your stage 1 booting kernel with initrd.

Read up in the initrd command or google building a boot kernel.

Message-ID: <4C141AA4.1000406@comcast.net>

Some weeks ago I tried installing Ubuntu 10.04 on my test box. The 
installation completed and presented me with a login screen. However, 
when I typed my password there was a brief delay and then I was back at 
the login screen. At that time I found no solution on the Ubuntu 
community forum. In order to try out some other things I wiped that 
installation by installing Ubuntu 9. Somewhere along the line I was 
offered the opportunity to install a number of updates. After completing 
those I was offered the opportunity to upgrade to 10.04. Since it is 
just my test box, and since I was finished with the other things I 
wanted to do at the time, I allowed the process to proceed. It required 
a number of hours and a couple of responses, so it wasn't until the next 
morning that it was finally ready to present me with a login screen. 
After typing my password I heard most of the musical bit that serves to 
let me know the sound system is working. I say "most of" because it was 
clipped just before finishing, and then I was presented with the login 
screen, again!

I checked back with the Ubuntu community forum and found this:

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1507373&highlight=login+loop

One of the recommended fixes was:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are you able to get to a console from the login screen by pressing 
Ctrl-Alt-F2?

If so, login and try typing 'df -h' to see if you have enough disk space.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've got plenty of disk space so on to the next recommendation:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would try maybe reconfiguring gdm:

sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm

(followed by)

sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That worked. Apparently there is an issue with some video subsystems. 
Anyway, now that it works, I'll try installing again from the CD and 
running dpkg-reconfigure gdm. If all that works, I'll start really 
configuring the box to include all the programs I'm currently using. If 
that works then I'll use it as a backup of this machine before upgrading 
it from Ubuntu 8.

I suspect this will be a much harder project since I have yet to find a 
way to keep track of all the things that I install, and how I installed 
them. Also, I've noticed that some programs that were available in 
Ubuntu 8 are no longer easily available on either 9 or 10. These are not 
critical (Buoh comics reader and some card games) but they are things I 
use, and would miss. The other problem is discovering what I've done but 
have forgotten about since I don't use it/them very often. Some kind of 
install log might be the solution, as long as it isn't too cluttered. 
Any advice on this aspect of system administration will be appreciated.

Dick Steffens

Aptitude helps in a small way. In /var/log/apt, at least on my 10.04 
machine, are two files. The first, history.log, shows what was 
installed, removed and purged and when. It doesn't show what process did 
it (aptitude, synaptic, etc.), nor does it show upgrades or updates.

The other file, term.log, is the terminal output one may observe during 
an install/update/remove process, including errors. It also appears to 
not show output from any process invoked during package setup.

I would suspect that, working from these two files it may be possible to 
determine when a package was installed and, therefore, could point you 
to files that were created and modified shortly thereafter.

Personally, I created an install script and keep copies of all the 
config files. When I upgrade I tweak the install script for the new 
repos and then let it do the install and file copying for me. It works 
sometimes, and others not so well. But at least I have config files I 
can manually copy if necessary.

This appears true for a lot of programs. Unfortunately, there appears no 
easy process: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1473995.html 
for example. You might end up having to go old school and compile from 
source.

I'm hoping this is a "ask the question right before you find the answer" question.

Where is the log rotation for postfix handled?

There's no mention in the /etc/logrotate or /etc/logrotate.d/*
Yet the log files are being rotated.  I'm not finding where this is being driven
from.

Michael,

   Here, on my Slackware boxes, /etc/syslog.conf directs all mail logs to
/var/log/maillog and /etc/logrotate.conf specifies daily as the rotation
interval.

   I'm running postfix here.

   I'm upgrading PSTricks. There are 50 modules, and the relevant .tex files
are each in its own directory. I thought that I could cd to the parent
directory of these and use 'cp -R *.tex
/usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/pstricks' but the shell tells me it cannot find
a *.tex file.

   Do I need to use a for loop so the shell knows to look in each directory
for the .tex file to copy? Or have I not used the cp command correctly?

Are you wanting to copy just the .tex files, and into the same directory 
structure?

This should do that:

|tar cf - *.tex | ( cd /target; tar xfp -)|

Not tested. I've used similar for backing up to disk.

You didn't mention distro. I think this may be distro specific. At any rate, this looked promising:

Subject: [PLUG] ReactOS site down again...
Message-ID: <1276501460.2865.34.camel@localhost>

I found an interview via WineHQ with a fellow who worked on ReactOS back
in 2004.  No doubt, he really thought that 6 months would see ReactOS in
much better shape than it is in even today.  The ReactOS community of
today seems like a very angry community that is experiencing an ever
lengthening timeline for getting something stable/quasi stable put
together.

Perhaps it would be best to fix whatever problems remain in Linux and
really push Linux instead.  For instance, does everyone need X Windows?
I look at the philosophy behind Syllable and wonder if a simpler GUI 
on top of Linux would be a more reasonable idea?

ReactOS, started in 1996, is still in alpha stage.  I think 0.3.11 was
released 5-6 months ago.  The site is totally down right now according
to openDNS.  Sometimes, the site seems to go down when a new release is
pending.  ReactOS needs to be in beta, but who knows how far off that
is.

When is a project, even an OSS project, not worth it?  Linux came
together in what, four years time?  ReactOS is taking much longer 
to come together.  With a third of all software projects being
completed, maybe the ReactOS community should accept that their 
project isn't one of those and either move on or hand the project 
over to someone else.

Linux is very mature, although I have problems with my AGP HD 3450
Radeon shutting off without warning and my system is oddly quite slow.
I'm trying to play Runes of Avalon Book I which supposedly requires a
1.6 Ghz processor on a 3.06 Ghz P4 1.5 gigabytes of ram Fedora 12 system
and it is still too slow.  I think it makes more sense to put pressure
on AMD and the makers of NVIDIA video cards to help the open source
community write better drivers for Linux than it does to try and clone
Windows NT.  Especially now with Linux being taken more seriously by
software producers, fixing Linux should be taken more seriously as well.

Anyways, how common is it for someone to be banned from communicating
with the people working on an open source project?  Is ReactOS a dying
project at this point or is there a realistic possibility of someone
else taking on the project and doing something great with it?

Maybe Linux should be the server and something else should be the
desktop system, but is the Windows NT environment really all that 
great a choice for desktops?

Maybe if the ReactOS community didn't make the code available free of
charge to the public, the GPL doesn't require this, programmers could
be hired to work full time.

The shell does that
because there are no *.tex files in the current directory.

The
expansion of *.tex occurs before cp sees the command line and in this case
what cp sees for arguments is "-R".

You used cp correctly.? One approach to this would be:

???? cp */*.tex

Which will work unless the
directory structure is deeper than one level.

Another approach
would be:

??? cp `find . -name \*.tex`
<DESTDIR>

note:? the back ticks are the important
punctuation.? Look up above the tab key.

   I did something similar and it works just fine.

We are honored to have local Perl expert and OSCON presenter Eric
Wilhelm and visiting OSCON keynote presenter Paul Fenwick talk about
gems you may have been missing in Perl 5 and 6.

Eric will present an overview of the Perl 6 project, a snapshot of
recent development, how to install Rakudo Perl 6, and samples of what
you can  do with Rakudo Perl 6 now.

Paul writes: Awesome things have been happening in Perl recently; so
many that even if you've been paying close attention, you may have
missed a few. In this talk we'll examine some of the coolest recent
technologies for Perl programmers, including:

* Overhauling Perl's Object Oriented framework with Moose.

* Making everything a first-class object with autobox.

* Slashing your error handling code with autodie.

* Building fast, readable and reusable regular expressions with Perl 5.10.

* Bundling and building stand-alone applications using PAR, the Perl
Archiver.

* Astonishingly good profiling with Devel::NYTProf.

* Playing MineSweeper automatically with App::SweeperBot.

not to be totally pedantic, but rotating your monitor is pretty easy
these days (from a software POV).  see xrandr(1).  i had a 24" LCD
rotated at my last work-desk and i could hold a ridiculously long
terminal window in it.  and i did.  even though i use a huge font, it
was still >100 lines long and i had room for another normal 25-liner
underneath it (and some applets next to both of them, since i like my
terminals in 80-char widths regardless of length).

i think the hacks based on screen(1) are likely to be nifty but not
functional in some way or another for the proposed workload.  or
really anything that TERM=dumb couldn't handle.

Subject: [PLUG] Using Debian testing packages in stable
Message-ID: <alpine.OSX.2.00.1006151007260.11969@guild.galois.com>

I'd like to selectively upgrade some packages in Debian lenny (stable) 
to the versions currently in the testing release.

Here's what I've done:

   1. Made sure sources.list has deb and deb-src entries for both
      lenny and testing.

   2. Added 'APT::Default-Release "5.0*";' to /etc/apt/apt.conf.

Now I want to do "aptitude -t testing install pkg1 pkg2 pkgN".

Is that the best practice for such things? I've read a bit about doing 
pinning in /etc/apt/preferences, but that didn't seem to provide the 
right package set when I ran apt-get in test (-s) mode.

You might be better off using something like debian backports 
( http://www.backports.org/ ) for that.  When I do stuff like this, I
commonly just download and install the necessary .debs manually, but
they probably have swankier ways to handle dependencies.

Thanks for the link. I looked in lenny-backports for the packages I 
need, but they're still below the minimum version level I need (while 
Debian testing has the required version).

I'll definitely keep the backports option open for future reference!

I got my nephew the 900 mhz version with a 20 mb SSD and Linux pre installed.

ASUS seems to have dropped the Linux version.

HELP!

Surely, I don't have to buy used to get a Linux sub notebook these days.

Though putting the dollars into linux products has obvious social benefits; there's always the sysadmin's "song of last resort"

fdisk, format, reinstall
Doo da, doo da...

I hear cruncheee and eeebuntu are well suited for these ventures.

Though not an Asus device, one that's intrigued me is the linux-based netbook/tablet sold on AlwaysInnovating (www.alwaysinnovating.com).

Windows N...what? That sounds like a fun project; reverse-engineering and essentially re-inventing an existing although wholly-broken OS architecture. Whoohoo... How many anti-virus/spyware/malware/whatever vendors support that flavor?

I find you get what you focus on; they want to focus on a broken system by modeling a replacement after that...well guess what, nearly 15 years later and they're still stuck with alpha quality code that still lacks both 64-bit and NTFS support (even Linux has those!). Maybe the ReactOS developer(s?) should shift gears, considering Apple now surpasses M$ in market capitalization. Seriously - if they're so stuck on their glorious code, why not leave them to their toys - would you really want that mindset contributing to other projects anyway?

As for being banned from open source projects - I typically only see that when projects are rapidly losing developers & other forms of public support, and the banned individual disagrees with the remaining developers. Take, for example, SQL-Ledger; a project wholly-controlled by a single developer and whom bans anyone from "his" GPLed project that does not fall in line behind him. On the flip-side, a very strong "alternative" SQL-Ledger community has been evolving for years - so-much that the original developer doesn't even factor into the picture anymore. If ReactOS is kicking people out, then where's their alternative community? Maybe they're just looking for a corner to die in?

Pretty website, I wonder who their webmaster is.

Shouldn't this be on PLUG-TALK?

Oh yea, sent from a Mac, through a datacenter chock-full of highly-reliaable Linux systems, from a snarky guy who started when Netware 3.11 & DOS 6.22 were The Next Big Things(tm). The point; sure, Windows is kind of important in some environments, but it's nothing near the Big Deal it used to be - count the number of PCs vs Macs during your next coffee shop run, or start asking random people what their home computer runs (my money its predominately OSX, or a vendor-supplied Linux distro).

I think Asus is in bed with Microsoft.  Well, DELL isn't infected yet.
Not everyone gets that STD called Windows.  Can't get a solid state
device for a DELL Inspiron Mini 10 with Ubuntu pre installed, but at
least I don't have to pay for and manually get rid of a copy of Windows.
Ironically, and this is nonsense, the Windows version has the 32 Gig SSD
as an upgrade option.  Sounds like politics to me.  Linux supports SSDs
just as well as Windows does.  If I didn't know any better, I'd say that
Dell is trying to make sure that their Linux offerings have fewer
features and are less attractive than their Windows machines.  Dell
should get serious and offer Linux pre installed on ALL of their product
lines.

Once the salesman figured out that indeed there is a Linux pre installed
DELL, it wasn't much trouble to get an order ringed up.  Around the
26th, it should arrive.  Aside from not having an SSD, this DELL mini
Inspiron 10 should work just fine for my nephew.  I hope the salesman
goes up the chain to suggest that the no SSD option on Linux laptops 
be rectified.  Linux people are not second class citizens and should 
not have second class options.  I would also like to see more variety
than simply Ubuntu or Windows on DELL systems.  What about Fedora,
CentOS, RHEL, etcetera?  I realize that DELL doesn't want to embrace too
many operating systems, but most serious Linux people use more than just
Ubuntu.

Perhaps.  I thought it was relevant to PLUG because I brought up Linux
in my post with the question, "Does it make more sense to fix the
remaining problems in Linux than it will to create an OSS clone of
Windows NT?"  Sure, this can be continued on PLUG-TALK.

I guess what amazes me is that the ReactOS people are not purists.  
They want to use Microsoft's potentially broken SDK including Microsoft
Visual C because, "the gcc maintainers won't make important changes."
Considering that GCC is under the GPL, the ReactOS people should be 
able to make the, "needed changes," themselves.

I think something lighter than X-Windows running on top of Linux
customized for WINE makes far more sense than ReactOS does, at 
least in the short run.  I'm a big fan of native Linux software.
Hopefully, Dirk Dashing 2 will come out by years end and be a
major success.  Mygamecompany is effectively proving that Linux
is a good platform for gaming with every game they write for 
Linux that becomes popular.  The last newsletter suggests that 
they need new customers right now.  If you can afford to, consider
buying one of their Linux titles.

>From the responses so far, I think the answer is "no".  The goal
is to use a laptop with (multiple virtual windows) to show scrolling
xterm output in a longer, narrower window than a short/wide laptop
screen normally permits.  Emulating teletype output, for those
of you that still remember those ancient beasts.  It seems like
an obvious thing to do.  Perhaps too difficult, since it would
involve rewriting part of xterm.

Turning the laptop screen sideways?  (Rip, crunch, spark, poof)
THAT didn't work ...

Don?t use very old  hardware?

I thought one of Linux' selling points was that unlike Windoze Linux
supported legacy hardware.   

I'm using a 14 year old HP scanner fed by a Adaptec SCSI card even
older. No need to change them out as long as they  meet my needs. I was
initially lured to try Ubuntu Hardy because of lack of Windoze
Vista/Se7en drivers. To this day Ubuntu Lynx and its derivatives, Mint,
Mepis, etc, have performed flawlessly. I agree with the  warning about
cutting edge hardware but a Linux strong suit is its solid support for
old or recycled devices.  Microsoft market strategy seems to be to
conspire with hardware vendors to make hardware obsolete sooner than its
lifespan or users needs require.

In the Linux world "very old hardware" are things like MFM and RLL drives.

In the Windows world it is any hardware that is older than about 5 years.

Just did that for my BigDog wife. If you go to youtube and try to play 
something, you get a message and a link to adobe to download the thing 
from adobe. I downloaded the .tar.gz version, unzipped and untarred it 
and got a libflashplayer.so which I copied to /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/ 
or similar.

My wife is currently doing something on her Slackware disk (good wife) 
or I would confirm the location on her Ubuntu disk. When I get the 
chance, I will check the location where I copied libflashplayer.so. If 
it was different, I'll get back to you.

Wayne,

   Yes, she said the site offered various flavors but no .deb and I didn't
know what to suggest. I always get the .tgz (or .tar.gz) when I need to
upgrade.

   Ah, yes, you're a Slackware user, too.

   I'll have her check with whereis, locate, or find and get the location on
her machine.

Did you try just downloading the installer from the Adobe site and 
running it?

Why not just download the most recent and place the file in her own home
directory for her web browser instead of using it globally?  I would
download the .tar.gz file and then toss the libflashplayer.so file into
~/.mozilla/plugins - assuming she is using Firefox or Iceweasel.

You could start using a tiling window manager[1], something like i3[2]
or dwm[3].  People are using these on everything from ubuntu to NetBSD.
Adding in screen[4] or dvtm[5] gets you even more versatality.

Yes! The famous PLUG Linux Clinic is this Sunday, June 20, 2010!

Where?	Free Geek, 1741 SE 10th Avenue in Portland 97214
When?	1 - 5 pm

Bring your ailing Linux computers and our experts will help you figure
out what is wrong. Or bring a computer that you want to install Linux
on and we'll help you set it up. We have all flavors of all major
distros available. Or just come and look over people's shoulders to see
what Linux is all about. And if you are a Linux expert come on down
too; the Clinic is a great way to get experience supporting Linux.

I went the route of installing the "flashplugin-installer" using 
synaptic.  Upon installation/update this package actually pulls the 
latest version from Adobe and installs it where/as Ubuntu expects.  This 
package supercedes the previous "flashplugin-nonfree" which was a 
packaging of the Adobe latest version (but tended to lag a bit).

Hi

I looking forward to seeing you Sunday.

I'm wanting to back up the stuff on my computer, install 10.4 and do
whatever is needed to be able to watch TV programs on my computer (with
Hulu?).

Hi Debra,

Not sure if you want to wait for the upgrade to 10.4 before installing
this, but Hulu has provided a linux desktop client which works quite well.
it's available at http://www.hulu.com/labs/hulu-desktop-linux

If you like internet television, Boxee is also an app worth looking into,
I use it all the time, and there's even a remote you can install on
smartphones!

Regards,

nathan w

I assume you don't get to use the MS web apps unless you have a license

Do you have a USB drive or enough CDs/DVDs to hold all the data in your
home folder? I ask because at the Clinic we don't have any external
drives that can be used for backups. In any event, it would be best if
you can copy everything in your home folder to CDs or DVDs before the
Clinic, as it would save time. Just doing the upgrade to 10.04 will
take an hour or so.

 I'm trying to use the tar command in a BASH shell and want to exclude files.
If I use this command:
   tar --exclude=._* -cvfj oldemail.tbz bzip2 

tar creates an archive named 
  j

I have tried other variations  of the --exclude= command with errors made
in naming or creation of the tar file.

Free for personal use without an office license. Looks like it's a
direct attempt to take on Google Docs and extend Microsoft's
Sharepoint install base perhaps.

   Interesting. We have a client currently stuck with using sharepoint for
spreadsheets recording monitoring data. It's a horrible solution that's
caused them to miss deadlines on a regular basis.

Yep. The -f option expects the next token to be a filename.

Are there eSATA II cases for individual hard drives?

I am ordering external SATA II cables and some adapters
to go from internal SATA to external SATA.  I'm planning on
running 2-4 SATA connectors from an open 5.25" drive bay.
If there is a part I can get that will go into a 5.25"
drive bay giving me 4 eSATA II connectors, that would
be great.

google calendar is very flexible for this purpose, so if there's not

Message-ID: <4C1FA13B.6030803@mailswamp.com>

Hello folks,

I in a desperate need of a new notebook/laptop for the oncoming school year.
On a whim I've purchased this laptop in Office Depot
Toshiba Satellite L675D-S7016 *$634.99*
http://laptops.toshiba.com/laptops/satellite/L670/L675D-S7016
It works somewhat . . .
It has a slow 100MB only Realtek RTL8102E Ethernet controller and
Realtek 8172 WiFi controller which I cannot make working, no matter what
I did.
Its ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4250 graphic controller is not performing in
KDE4 as well as nVidia
on my RIP old Sager laptop. No openGL support and dodgy scrolling and
windows moving /resizing.
I'm running open SUSE 11.2 on this new thing, which I'm going to return
back to the store.

Could somebody please recommend, based on the personal experience, a
decent notebook with the following
characteristics:
1. 15 - 17" Display
2. Turion II or less desirable Athlon II dual core CPU. Quad core is
fine as long as it's AMD
3. 1 GB Ethernet controller
4. Wi-Fi Wireless 802.11b/g/n controller which is known to work with
Linux without excessive headaches.
5. nVidia integrated graphic controller. In the worst case scenario I
can live with ATI Radeon.
6. At least 4GB DDR3 RAM expandable up to 8GB. I don't want to have
older and slower DDR2 RAM.
7. Preferably in black or other non-flashy matte colors. I don't like
that bright and cheesy silverish goldish el'cheapo glossy colors.

Thank you in advance for any hints or recommendations,

Alex

Alex,

   Last week I ordered a Dell Latitude E4510; the E5510 has a 15" screen
instead of the 14" one I prefer. It has an Intel CPU, chipset, video, and
wireless radio; all supported by linux. While I, too, prefer AMD I need a
portable that will work with Slackware without fuss. All-Intel will. I saved
about $460 on it with the coupon code at <http://www.techbargains.com/>.
Keep checking that site for discounts on Dell, HP, and other brands.

FWIW, you probably want either Intel or Atheros radios to minimize
headaches.

I have good luck running diff Linux distros (*buntu, Debian, CentOS,
OpenSuse) on my Lenovo Thinkpad T60. I bought it refurbished in '07 and it
still runs great.

I've used both of these sites for getting help w. installing and running
Linux on Thinkpads:

http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkWiki
http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/ibm.html

And I just discovered that the Lenovo web site has what appears to be very
good support and documentation.

in utilizing the Linux operating system on various personal computing
systems."

Subject: [PLUG] Problems with browser on Ubuntu 8.04 server
Message-ID: <AANLkTiksej-YbH4wB74x6r7AZnFwpJ26mgHw4SN6Wnzc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

After going to the PLUG clinic yesterday, I now have ubuntu 8.04
server on my machine.  I did sudo
apt-get install xubuntu-desktop from the command line, and now I can
surf the net using Firefox 3.0.19
I am so happy that things went smoothly, as far as the apt-get command
goes.  I really am.  I had
many frustrations in the past, that I couldn't figure out, and kind of
gave up on linux.  Now, I'm giving it
the old college try again.

Well....in Firefox 3.0.19, I went to the menu and clicked on Edit,
then Preferences.  When the Firefox Preferences
window came up, I clicked on Advanced.  Then I clicked on the tab
Update tab.  Under Update tab it says

Automatically check for updates to:

   Firefox

   Installed Add-ons

   Search Engines


The above three items are check boxes and they were all initially
checked.  I unchecked them all.  Then
I tried to check them all again.  I am able to check "Installed
Add-ons", and I am able to check "Search
Engines".  I am not able to check "Firefox".  My mouse click is not
being registered.


Under Update tab it also says:





When updates to Firefox are found:


    Ask me what I want to do

   Automatically download and install the update


The above two items are radio buttons.  Initially the "Automatically
download and install the update" button
was selected.  I then selected the "Ask me what I want to do" button.
Now, I can't switch back to the
"Automatically download and install the update button"


I know this is in Firefox, but this is Firefox, on a newly installed
Linux operating system.  I did not have
this kind of problem with Firefox on Windows.  So I conclude that this
is a Linux problem, i.e. a Firefox
on Linux problem, and I don't know what to do to get the check boxes
and radio buttons to work again.
Please help.




Also, I want to be able to watch you tube videos in Firefox.  I am told

You need to upgrade your Adobe Flash Player to watch this video.
Download it from Adobe.


I click on "Download it from Adobe" and I go to the link

http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/

where I can download a

.deb for Ubuntu 8.04+

or

.tar.gz for linux

among other things.


I been through this sort of thing before, and have not been successful.

I don't know if I hit the button that says

Agree and Install now

with the

.deb for Ubuntu 8.04+

selected

that I will actually get my firefox browser updated properly, so that
it can play youtube videos.

I don't know if I'm merely suppose to go to

Help    Check for Updates

in Firefox, and that will make Firefox run youtube videos properly.

I don't know if I'm suppose to go to the command line, and do some
sort of apt get on updating
adobe flash player for firefox.


So....could someone please help me to get my checkboxes, radio
buttons, and adobe flash player
to work in Firefox, which is on my new linux box.  Like I said, I did
not encounter these issues with
Firefox on Windows.  I just can't figure out what to do with Firefox on Linux.

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

I would like to second the Lenovo experience.  I called their tech 
support and asked for a recovery DVD as I wanted to reclaim the 
harddrive real estate their partition took up.

Not only did I get the DVDs, they remembered talking to me during a 
later phone call and inquired about the Linux installation and stability.

Two Lenovos, running Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Fedora 12, all x-64...very few 
glitches.

Hi Alex,
I recent bought the following for my Mom; $400 at Staples.com:

 Compaq Presario CQ61-420US
 (look up reviews & specs on newegg)

I installed Ubuntu 10.4 which runs flawlessly.  It does _not_ have a
1GB Ethernet NIC though, just 10/100.  And no PCCARD slot either; you'd
have to use the USB ports for faster Ethernet.  Still, for the money it
seemed like a good deal.  Might want to scuff up the shiny black casing
- major fingerprint magnet...

Good luck with the search,

Jeff

I wouldn't worry about that, because any time you apt-get update &&
apt-get upgrade, firefox will be updated from repos. remember that linux
updates your install software as part of system updates (as long as you
install from repos), and windows does not.

there are two ways to deal with getting flash:

 you can either install flash from repositories, which is an older
version of flash on ubuntu 8.04 and can be obtained by 'sudo apt-get
install flashplugin-nonfree'

alternatively, you can install the newer version of flash from adobe by
visiting the download page you mentioned and installing the ".deb for
ubuntu 8.04+" listed in adobes download options, which should open in
gdebi if you run the downloaded file by clicking on it after downloaded.
(you can install the downloaded .deb via 'sudo dpkg -i my-app.deb' in
terminal as well...)

don't forget to restart your browser after you install flash, and you
should be set and ready to go with flash.

good luck!

i've been using DavMail happily on my home and work laptops (Ubuntu 
karmic and lucid) to connect to my employer's Exchange server, and it 
works like a charm.

i'm running it on localhost (my laptops) but you can run it on your 
server. The documentation is pretty good, but not for the casual user.

On both my machines, i've used it with Evolution (bllleeeecchhh) and 
Thunderbird 3.0 + Lightning + Provider for Google Calendar - i can see 
all my Google Calendars and multiple Exchange calendars within 
ThunderBird+Lightning, in one view. It's quite nice.

http://davmail.sourceforge.net/

Now if i could only do the same on my Andriod phone.... porting DavMail 
might be my first non-toy Andriod project.

I'm trying to rebuild a RPM.  I'm rebuilding it so use the 
current/most-recent libraries to get the !@#$% annoying error messages 
from going into the logs.  The package (and source RPM) comes from DAG's 
collection.


I keep getting this message while using rpmbuild:

+ autoreconf --force --install --symlink

configure.ac:69: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_PROG_LIBTOOL
       If this token and others are legitimate, please use m4_pattern_allow.

       See the Autoconf documentation.
autoreconf: /usr/bin/autoconf failed with exit status: 1

error: Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.79861 (%build)


No matter where I put the 'm4_pattern_allow(AC_PROG_LIBTOOL)' line 
(configure.ac, aclocal.m4, etc.) it never _takes_.  It is always missing 
when I go back to it after another failure.

Any RPM or m4 gurus out there that can offer a hand or clue stick?

I feel I'm at "Wits End" ... lost in Colossal Cave in a passage of 
twisty-turning passages.


TIA,
Rod

My T61 has worked perfectly since I bought it new a couple years ago.
Gigabit ethernet, Intel wireless, nVidia graphics, all just work, as
does bluetooth. I started with Ubuntu and now run Fedora 11 on it. It
holds only 4 GB of RAM, though. Another thing I like about it is that
the parts are not cheesy. It feels solid. 

You need a newer model than my T61, but I still strongly recommend
Lenovo for a headache-free Linux experience.

   "Only 4G RAM???" You obviously never worked on a PC-1, an HP-125, or any
microcomputer that had a whopping 64K of RAM. How perceptions change when
folks come late to a technology.

Actually, my first computer had 64K of RAM. The salesperson who sold me
my second computer assured me that it was the last computer I would
ever have to buy - because in the entire remainder of my lifetime I
would never be able to fill its massive 5 MB hard disk.

I come late to Linux, but not to computers. And I am even later at
computer science, since I still know little of it. We learn what is
important to us to learn. What is important varies from person to
person.

Quick follow up.  I decided to do an install from source code (the 
tarball) and discovered another missing package -- libtool.  Too bad the 
error from the rpmbuild process (RPM or other process issue) wasn't more 
helpful.  I should have guessed it was somewhere else as the 
${BUILD}/config directory had several broken soft links, i.e. nothing at 
the other end.

Anyway after installing libtool the package builds.

Maybe this will help someone else along the way to enlightenment.  :-)

Does anyone local sell the Lenovo T series? I don't see it on the
websites for the standard big-box stores.

I bought my T61 from:

Computek of Portland (aka: dba Computek)
1615 SW Jefferson Street, Portland, OR View Map
97201
Tel: 5032744384

I don't know if they have any T series. I do know that I shopped online
and everywhere else I could find and their price was only a couple
bucks more than the lowest that I found. Plus, they had it in stock so I
could walk out with it without waiting for shipping. They specialize
in high end Lenovo computers for business and technical people.

Subject: [PLUG] Upgrading Ubuntu from 9.10 to 10.04
Message-ID: <4C23B9BD.3040603@comcast.net>

Over the past few months, as I've had spare time, I've installed a 
couple of versions of Ubuntu on a spare machine. I've had success 
installing 9.10 from CD, but not 10.04. I did succeed in upgrading 
online from 9.10 to 10.04, although I did have to run sudo 
dpkg-reconfigure gdm from a text console in order to get it to work.

With that info I decided that I would try installing 10.04 from CD, 
again. However, when I get to the login screen, I am unable to switch to 
a text console.

So, I've re-installed 9.10 and will now upgrade to 10.04, again.

Are there any concerns about upgrading instead of a fresh install that I 
should be aware of?

Is the upgrade install somehow a bit less than a fresh install from CD?

Thanks.

Dick,

   No, based on my experience. We went from 9.04 to 9.10 to 10.4 with
absolutely no problems.

Both my personal and my employer's laptops have NVidia video cards 
(different models, about 3 years age difference). i did clean installs 
of Ubuntu 10.4 from the live CD. The installs were easier that earlier 
versions. The only difference is that with the older video card, i just 
get junk pixels for the boot splash screen and in the virtual consoles!

By "junk pixels" i mean they're really blocky and for all practical 
purposes unreadable, though i can make out the word "login". Better yet, 
all the virtual consoles show up twice on the screen, like two columns.

This has persisted despite all my attempts at tweaking the config, and 
even after the recent upgrade to the Nvidia closed drivers. i opened a 
bug, but it hasn't gone anywhere. Nothing on the Nvidia forums last time 
i looked.

The upgrade from Ubuntu 9.10 to 10.04 finished, I was presented with the 
login screen, login proceeded into the boot-up music, but cut off just 
after the cymbal crash, and looped back to the login screen. However, 
this time when I press <ctrl><alt><F1> (or <F2>, etc), all I get is a 
blank screen. Pressing <ctrl><alt><F8> returns me to the login screen.

Is there anyway to get around this?

Can I somehow login before X starts?

I could boot from the CD, but is there anything I could change on the 
hard drive that would help?

Thanks.

Hello folks,

Due to Office Depot's unfair "14 day exchange only" policy I could not
just return Toshiba Satellite L675D-S7016 and get all my money back.
They offered me in exchange another 16" display Toshiba Satellite A665-S6067
Intel i7 quad core CPU laptop. 

This one has nVidia GeForce GT330M graphic chipset and RTL8111/RTL8168 10/100/1000 Ethernet controller.
This laptop was significantly better than the previous one.
The graphic controller performs superbly, as well as its wired and WiFi network interfaces.

The only caveat is that I cannot enable from Linux its keyboard back light and keyboard 
controlled functions like suspend to disk, suspend to RAM and others. 
Though, sound volume and brightness adjustments work correctly.

I assume, that some keyboard functions require drivers which don't exist in Linux yet.

The GRUB bootloader does not show itself. Googling led me to the 
instruction to "hold down the shift key" which did give me the GRUB 
bootloader. On pressing e I got the following:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
recordfail
insmod ext2
set root=('hd0,1)'
search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set f23e2d255-be1b-482f-b2ef-4232025ef\15e
linux /boot/vmlinuz-2..32-21-generic 
root=UUID=f23e2d255-be1b-482f-b2ef-4232025ef\15e ro quiet splash
initrd /boot/initrd.img-2.6.32-21-generic
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I deleted "quiet splash" and replaced them with "nomodeset".

I pressed <ctrl>x, got the login screen, hit <enter> to accept my 
username, typed my password, hit <enter>. The login box went away, the 
purple screen stayed there for a few seconds, the screen went blank, and 
the purple screen with the login box came back. This time there was no 
music.

This box does not have an Nvidia video system. I booted up 9.10 from the 
CD and ran lshw -C Display. That told me that I have a VIA 
KM400/KN400/P3M800 [S3 UniChrome].

The threads you recommended had a lot of info on problems with ATI and 
Nvidia video systems, but I don't recall seeing anything about VIA.

Now that I'm booted with 9.10, is there anything I can do to the 10.04 
configuration files on the hard drive?

Thanks.

Hi all,

I need help with sound and I suppose some tweaking with buffering in
order to hear and watch you tube videos.  I installed ubuntu server
8.04 at the most recent clinic.  I installed the Xfce desktop
environment, which came with the Firefox web browser.  I followed the
help below in order to watch flash videos.

I did

~/Desktop$ sudo dpkg -i install_flash_player_10_linux.deb

from the terminal, as suggested above.

I now am able to watch videos, but not smoothly at all.  I have a
broadband, i.e. Comcast, connection.  Before, I was simply met with
instructions that said I had to download the latest version of flash.
I did that, as indicated above.  Now, when I watch videos, they are
extremely "choppy".  They are not smooth at all.  There is a message
that says "Buffer Full".  I did not have this sort of problem when
this machine had windows on it.  How do I make my videos run smoothly?

Also, I don't have any sound.  I have me speakers installed physically
in the same way as they were when windows was on the machine.  How do
I get sound out of them.  Do I have to figure out what sound card I
have, download the appropiate drivers, install them, et. al.  Or is
there something simple I can do?

Please help me to get my videos in Firefox on Linux working smoothly,
and sound so I can hear them.

Thank You,

Victor Soich

The Ubuntu forums are massive compared to any other distro, and they
have a pretty good search utility. I'd recommend searching on "VIA" to
see what turns up. If nothing turns up, post yourself in an appropriate
forum. I've had excellent results posting about various problems that I
have had over the years.

Bear in mind also that from the Grub boot menu the Recovery Mode will
boot you to a command line. I have found this extremely handy when
fixing video problems because it allows you to log in without loading
X. From the command line you can use wget and dpkg or apt-get to
install different video drivers or reconfigure the video.

I also find it interesting that your video works in 9.10 but not 10.04.
This smells like someone changed the video driver for 10.04, and
apparently not for the better. Maybe you can find the older driver and
install it instead of the new one. To find a driver that works try live
CDs for other versions of Ubuntu or other distros. If you find one
where the video works fine, check out which video driver it is using.

I'm hoping to track down any user logins to a rhel 5 server at a

I have found some of my answers using that route. I'll give VIA a try in 
the area where 10.04 login loop resides.

One of the things that worked in the past was to get a command line 
login and run:

sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm

Unfortunately, that did not work this time. I'll include that in my 
Ubuntu Forum post and see if anyone has other ideas.

Since if works fine in 9.10, then I'll see if I can figure out what to 
put where and give that a try.

Thanks for the ideas.

In the past, when I have had tough problems like yours, I have found
solutions on the IRC channel.
http://www.ubuntu.com/support/community/chat

By the way, I upgraded ubuntu (gnome) from 9.10 to 10.04 on my Toshiba
laptop.  My laptop does not have NVIDIA graphics, however.
I used the release CD.  Everything went well until the initial reboot when
the system froze hard.  I finally removed power and battery to get it to
reboot.
Once it rebooted, it works very well.

Good Luck,

it show up in my inbox on my gmail account.  Is it the case that my
question is not appropriate for the list?  Is it the case that no one
is answering the questions?  I've gotten part way with watching you
tube videos in Firefox on Ubuntu, but I still have no sound, and the
video is choppy.  Perhaps my questions are too newbie.  If so,
perhaps, someone can suggest a more appropriate venue for my
inquiries.

   Have you run aumix and/or alsamixer?

   Often the sounds of silence are heard when the speakers are turned off.

Victor,

Your message did get to the list. It's just that (other than Rich's
suggestion to check your audio settings), no one knew the answer.

There are several hundred on this list, but there are tens of thousands
on the Ubuntu forums. I recommend you search the forums and, if you do
not find an answer, then post your question to the forums.

by playing with Grub i narrowed this one down. Right after installing
Ubuntu 9.10 on this machine i'd installed the StartupManager GNOME app
to do a little customization of the boot process (which is well-nigh
impossible by using grub2 directly without hous of study i don't
really have. i still don't see the value add over the ol grub). My
hope was to get higher-resolution virtual terminals on my 1920x1200
pixel display. No matter which setting i chose in StartupManager, i
had the garbled consoles.

By editing the boot commnd at startup, and removing the "vga=769" or
any other setting put there by StartupManager, all is good - i'm not
getting a high-res virtual terminal (as i did in Ubuntu 9.10), but
they work.

Now on to figure out: how to edit the grub2 settings and rebuild the
configuration... my previous searching for an easy guide to grub2
wasn't too helpful, but that was months ago.

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2

First hit on google for "Grub2 screen resolution".

Search the page for "resolution". I had no problem setting this up on my 
laptop. Not in Linux atm but if you want my grub.conf let me know. 
Kernel uprades (via the Ubuntu Update Manager) reset customized 
grub.conf files. Make sure to keep a backup handy and edit it manually 
for new kernels.

Subject: [PLUG] Eschalon Book 1 slow...
Message-ID: <1277709400.2459.3.camel@localhost>

I am running it under Fedora 12 on a P4 3.06 Ghz with 1.5 gigs of ram
and an HD 3450 Radeon AGP card.  The game seems a bit on the slow side.
Supposedly all that is needed is a 1.6 ghz celeron to play this, so I am
a bit amazed that my P4 would not be cutting it.

I've been playing the demo release, why buy the full release if I'm not
satisfied with it?

Has anyone else had problems with this game running slow under Linux?

Subject: [PLUG] Dell Inspiron Mini update...
Message-ID: <1277711055.2459.30.camel@localhost>

Don't know why, but Dell can not or will not provide installation media
for Ubuntu.  To make matters worse, Dell somehow shipped the little
laptop without any operating system whatsoever.  If Ubuntu had been
installed, there is supposedly a way to create installation media.
Between being forced to have a hard drive and Dell forgetting to 
install Ubuntu Linux, I'm a bit shocked.  I really wanted to have 
Linux installed on an SSD, especially in something this small.  Asus
used to offer a version of Debian on the Eee PC installed to a 20G SSD,
but they discontinued that and went to a Windows 7 or Windows XP only
policy.  Dell offers the SSD for Windows XP, but not for Linux (lame).

I can't complain about Dell wanting to service the laptop.  The plastic
isn't even removed completely.  I think there is room in the market for
someone to do Linux based laptops better than this.  I was worried
talking with Dell that they didn't realize the laptop is supposed to
have Linux on it.  Maybe Dell will get it's act together.
Unfortunately, Dell appears to be the only Linux act in town with Asus 
bowing out.  Who else is offering Linux pre installed laptops?  I think
there really is room for someone to come to market focused on Linux and
not offering Windows at all.  Another thing, Ubuntu is popular but
Ubuntu isn't the only reasonable Linux choice.

If you can support cutting edge hardware and actually get it to perform
reasonably well under Linux, even if that means some proprietary
drivers, then there really is no need for Windows.  I see the gaming
industry starting to embrace Linux and with better graphics there is
more to use graphics for than just games.  I'm not satisfied with this
experience so far, though I could consider this an anomaly.  In general
though, a lot had to be given up to get Linux as the OS where I
shouldn't have had to give up SSD, multi core processor, etcetera.

Not sure which mini you have but the install media should be available
out there somewhere on the internet if not via Dell directly.

I've had tons of issues w/ knetwork mgr and wireless nics. Tried it out in opensuse gnome? I just went through the same slog in kde opensuse and kde fedora w/ no luck, but gnome's networkmgr worked like a charm.

What's your route look like, and also your resolv.conf file? These should be
set by the DHCP client. Is a DHCP client being started? The ifup output says
so, but I'd double-check.

Can you ping a host by IP address? This takes DNS out of the picture, and
narrows the scope of the problem to resolv.conf.

Here is a typical routing table for a laptop with a single interface - wlan0
- up:

root at sphinktop:~# route -n
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     2000   0        0 wlan0
127.0.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.0.0.0       U     0      0        0 lo

I just updated my Fedora 12 and it updated 
ibus-chewing-1.3.4.20100608-1.fc12.x86_64.  The cleanup afterwards 
showed ibus-chewing-1.3.4-20100605-1.fc12.x86_64.

Note that I am running x86_64.  On my box ibus-pinyin-1...is not installed.

Thank you for the information. OK it looks like it is still bringing up
eth0 and not wlan0. I don't know what to set so that wlan0 is the
default route and not eth0. I unplugged the network cable and restarted
Linux with the USB wireless plugged in & this was the result.

Dear All:

Can someone recommend a tool that can scan a binary and detect open source
code/tool is included inappropriately inside the binary?
Not sure if this is even  possible but thought I check with this group.
I have looked at Black Duck but they work on source code level and I do not
always have source code available.

Thanks in advanced for any tip.

The Binary Analysis tool can check binaries/firmware for some GPL code
(mostly busybox iirc.)

In case you haven't purchased your laptop yet Rich, I have both a Lenovo
X301 and T410 running Ubuntu 10.4. Both work quite well with all of the
hardware supported from what I can tell. I honestly prefer the X301 because
it is smaller and lighter which is nice with it hanging on my back riding to
and from work.

Brian,

   I did. It was supposed to be here last week. However, when I went to the
Dell Web site to learn why it was late I learned they moved the ship date
back to 1 July. Didn't bother to notify me.

   I had a ThinkPad 600E that ran several distributions, three different
Toshiba models that ran Red Hat, Slackware, and (my wife's current one)
xubuntu, and a Sony Vaio that's been happily running Slackware. The Dell is
a new brand for me and their lack of notification of delayed shipment does
not make a favorable impression.

Thanks,

Rich

A quick and dirty way to check for obvious signs of code inclusion
would be to run strings(1) on the binaries and search for strings that
are most likely unique to the open source software in question.  For
instance, if you find printf templates for error messages which are
uniquely identifiable to the open source package, then it's likely
that the code is included.  If your software is compiled for Windows,
you'll want to use strings in UTF-16LE mode with '-e l'.

HTH,
tim

Hal,

   Dell may have been more stupid than was HP, Apple, and the other
manufacturers, but they're all capable of such behaviors. This was an
industry-wide problem with desktop motherboards 5-7 years ago and doesn't
tell us anything about current portables.

   Toyota has recently had major problems that they tried to hide. There are
still many Toyotas driving around here without running into things. (And
those that do probably have the nut holding the steering wheel to blame.)

Nor is it limited to that time frame. That's more or less just when the 
problem exploded. I see this on computers and components (pick your 
brand) purchased a year ago, and I don't expect it to go away. Bad caps 
suck.

   That wouldn't be too bad. It's when they leak that problems arise. :-)

Well that's what I mean when I say that. I have two nice Asus video 
cards on my shelf right now that have the same caps on each one that are 
burst. And they are solid core caps, not electrolyte. These were suppose 
to be the answer to all the bad cap stories out there. I have several 
Dell desktops at work that I haven't gotten around to replacing the 
swollen or burst caps yet, power supplies from HP and Supermicro last 
week, etc. I've been thinking about getting a small parts cabinet just 
to store all the different caps I have now.

http://worldbbnews.com/2010/06/how-a-stolen-capacitor-formula-ended-up-costing-dell-300m/

I remember when this all hit the fan back then. You could buy cap 
replacement kits on eBay for your favorite motherboard that suddenly had 
a bunch of leaking capacitors.

The problem of Dell here is how they reacted to this. The bad caps have 
affected just about everyone who makes electronics. A guy I did some 
work for about a month ago had to have his less than a year old LCD
TV repaired. The tech brought the caps with him knowing what he'd find 
and was right.

BTW, if you need more caps, DorkBot runs group-orders to Digi-Key every
other week.  I use that a fair bit.  I've had a hard time desoldering
through-hole caps from multilayer boards though.  

My other programming language is a soldering iron,

posting this here in the hope someone may catch something i'm missing.

i'm trying to teach myself rsync, as the other backup solutions i'd been 
using don't do diff's, and thus take too long to backup. i've come up w/ 
a functional backup to backup from my laptop to our home network server, 
but it's goofing when i add it as a cronjob...

here's the rsync:

~$ rsync
-avz --delete -e "ssh -p 2456" /home/nathan/ --exclude 'Music'

extra... (sorry, thunderbird killed the last half of the first message 
somehow while giving me grief about server certificate). the issue is 
that when it's put into a cron job, it doesn't exclude the ~/Music 
directory, i've tried phrasing it a few ways ('Music', '~/Music', 
'/home/nathan/Music') and tried replacing the single quotes w/ double 
quotes, no luck.

Just a guess off the top ... escape the quotes and double quotes?  Just 
a guess ...

woo, there is always a way. in this case i was able to use rsync's 
--exclude-from option, and just write the list of excluded files/folders 
in a file, and no need to mess w/ where things go wrong mixing rsync and 
cron. thanks for the help folks.

cheers,

Hi all,

According to the suggestion at the end of this email, in order to try
to get sound on my linux box, I was told to run alsamixer and/or
aumix.  Well, as a newbie, I wasn't sure how to install it, so...I apt
get the Gnome Desktop environment, then I used the add/remove
application in Gnome.  Then I installed Alsamixergui, and Gnome Alsa
Mixer.  I couldn't find aumix.  After both were installed, I invoked
them from the Applications, Sound & Video, menu.  When I invoked Gnome
Alsa Mixer, I got

An error occurred while loading or saving configuration information
for GNOME ALSA Mixer. Some of your configuration settings may not work
properly.

then I hit details, and the window said...

when I invoked Alsamixergui, I clicked on Proc Info.  It gave me
information which might be useful.  The information cosisted of the
following....


vsoich at tiberius:~$ cat /proc/asound/version
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture Driver Version 1.0.16.
Compiled on Jun  1 2010 for kernel 2.6.24-28-server (SMP).

Also.....ALSA Mixer says I have   Chip: SigmaTel STAC9708,11


So...I've done my newbie best here.  Does any of the above information
give anybody some insight on how I should proceed next to get sound to
work on my new Ubuntu 8.04 server.  I'm groping along here, and I hope
that the actions that I did above will merit some more advice and/or
help.  If worse comes to worse, I'll take my box to the next PLUG, and
hope that someone will get my sound to work.

Also...I've tried reading The Linux Sound HOWTO but it was hard to
make heads or tails of it.....

But mostly, does any of the above information give anyone a clue on
how I should next proceed?  I hope I've done my newbie due diligence.

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

Subject: [PLUG] ESATA cages...
Message-ID: <1277946773.7207.2.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I recently ordered ESATA cages and noticed on the boxes that it says
supports up to 500 GB.  Hunh?  I thought these could handle 2 TB drives.
So, anyone know the story on this one?  I hate to go that small.

Michael--
1. In what way did a Google search not answer your question?
2. Did you contact the people you bought the cages from?  They are paid to
   handle questions about things they sell.
3. What did you hope to gain by posting to PLUG, without any info on what
   you tried first, let alone make/model/chipset info?

HTH,
  Aaron
