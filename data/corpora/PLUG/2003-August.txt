Message-ID: <BAY5-F16M8NQRWZbGyt0000bec6@hotmail.com>

Hello,

I was away for the weekend and when I returned, my primary drive was 
clicking and dead. Fortunatley most of my stuff is on my slave drive 
including my Linux partition. However, now my MBR is missing the linux info 
and my boot floppy is nowhere to be found. How do I resetup GRUB so I can 
dual boot again? btw I'm running RedHat 9

Thanks

Jerry Lake

The Grub section is quite comprehensive.

Oops, you can't boot Linux to create a GRUB disk- ignore previous post.

Use your Red Hat CD to either do a direct recovery, or create a rescue floppy. 
http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-9-Manual/custom-guide/ch-rescuemode.html
You can boot the CD, then edit /boot/grub/grub.conf, and put everything back.

Knoppix also makes a great recovery CD.

Message-ID: <1059797984.1731.3.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Has anyone on the list using Comcast.net noticed any slow downs with
resolving domains recently? The last couple of days sites that I don't
go to on a regular basis seem to take an extraordinary amount of time to
resolve.  Is there anything I can do to speed up the resolution?  Right
now I run RedHat 8.  The Network Configuration gui shows nothing under
DNS, under devices I have eth0 active and the properties of that shows a
checked checkbox next to Automatically obtain DNS information from
provider.

Any help would be appreciated.

Having just done this, let me agree, but throw in the following caveat I
discovered for anyone who ends up attempting to recover from a Knoppix
CD:

Knoppix, when it boots, creates an /etc/fstab with all of the partitions
it recognizes, but unfortunately adds an option to each hard disk
partition -- nodev, I think-- that makes it impossible to directly
access devices from within the mounted partition. So you do something
like this:

mount a disk, chroot to within it, and attempt to run lilo (or install
grub). And it says /dev/hda: Permission denied.

Don't let fstab mount stuff. 

instead of mount /dev/hda3 (and letting fstab figure out the options) do
it manually: mount -t ext2 (or ext3) /dev/hda3 /mnt/hda3

Most of you realized this, I'm sure, but I didn't find it anywhere in
googling, so I'm emailing this so it'll show up in google...plug gets
web archived, right?

Jeff

(discovery of the day: it's trivial to get an external USB mouse to work
with a laptop while keeping the touchpad working at the same time. ask
me how if you're interested).

Good tip, unfortunately google can't archive plug anymore since the archives 
are protected with https or something like that.  Might be something the 
plug-web group could address.  AFAIK there is no way to search the archives 
anymore.

I did this for someone at the last clinic.  What I did was make a grub
floppy[1] and used that to boot the existing intact linux installation
from grubs command-line[2].  Once booted, I did a grub-install /dev/hda
(or whatever) and everything was golden[3].

[1] from, perhaps, another working system or some other source:

    # cd /boot/grub
    # dd if=stage1 of=/dev/fd0 bs=512 count=1
    1+0 records in
    1+0 records out
    # dd if=stage2 of=/dev/fd0 bs=512 seek=1
    153+1 records in
    153+1 records out

    there are rawrite equivalents for doing this from lesser operating
    systems, e.g.:

    > copy /b stage1 + stage2 boot
    > rawrite boot a:

[2] from the grub prompt:

    > root (hd0,0)
    > kernel /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/hda1
    > boot
  
    salt to taste.  The first line should indicate the partition where
    linux is installed.  I've assumed /dev/hda1 here.  One of the nice
    things about grub is that you have filename completion, which can
    help you find the version of the kernel you want, e.g.:

      /boot/vmlinuz-X.Y.Z-foo 

    The tab key will show you what is available.

[3] actually, in my case it was slightly more complex in that the
    /boot directory was on a separate filesystem, so that certain grub
    "tricks" were required for grub-install to work correctly, I think
    in this case I created a symbol link in /boot from boot -> .,
    i.e.:

    # cd /boot
    # ln -s . boot

There is one thing that keeps me from using Linux full time. I have
a Handspring Visor Prism, the cradle using USB hooked into my MS
Natural USB keyboard. I use Avantgo every morning to get web pages,
to read at work on breaks and lunch. I have never been able to get
any program (kpilot, jpilot) to work with it and Avantgo. The Visor
howto is ancient and most of the help files are oriented to Palm's
with serial hookups. Does anyone have experience with Handsprings
and Avantgo? 

Thanks!

I have a caching only setup of Bind9 behind my firewall that my local 
client machines all use and I've seen some "ServFail" messages trying 
to be sent back from Comcast's DNS servers. I've not done any research 
on it as it doesn't affect my performance and it was only when I was 
looking at my firewall logs that I even noticed the errors.

The number of port probes I'm seeing on port 445 and 135 has really 
picked up in the last day or so and so perhaps that's slowing things 
down with the increase in network traffic related to that reported 
Windows RPC vulnerability I saw reported. Ports 137-139 are filtered on 
Comcast so I don't know if there's a big increase in port probing on 
those ports going on.

Barbara,

  No. But, did you ask for help on the jpilot mail list? Go to
<http://www.jpilot.org/> and sign up.

  We have a Visor Pro here but 1) we use a serial cradle for it and b) we
don't do Web pages on it.

HTH,

Hi,

Trying to install Red Hat 7.3 (2.4.18-3) on an Intel D865GBF mobo hangs in
the middle of IDE detection even with probing disabled.  I suspect serial
ata is the problem (reported to not be a problem in RH 9.0).  Is there a
driver for 7.3 or is this a kernel issue?  Nothing at redhat.com and little
at intel.com or google.com/linux.

Any tips appreciated,
Mike

See if you can disable SATA in the bios setup.  This will at least get the 
os installed.  Perhaps you can leave one ide channel as SATA and hang a 
spare drive on it and experiment with getting the kernel/drivers to talk to it.

[root at sparky log]# echo $SHELL

[root at sparky log]# date -d "8/1/2003" "+%b %e"
Aug  1
[root at sparky log]#


Note I want the latter output, "Aug  1" (note with two spaces).  The %e
switch with date command does exactly what I want from the command line,
but acts differently when run from a script.  Why is that?  Apparently
enclosing the command in `` makes it act differently.

Echo strips out extra spaces, enclose the variable in quotes

echo "$TODAY"

You're right!  Thank you.  So I checked "man echo" and "info echo" and
neither mentioned this fact.  Is there some oft-found reason that would
make it obvious that the quotes are needed?

Thanks again

It's not echo doing that, it's the shell.  When you do a
$-substitution, the substitution gets word-split, unless it's
enclosed in quotes.

So the shell splits $TODAY into words, losing all the spaces.  It
passes the words to echo as separate args, then echo pastes them
back together again, putting a single space between the words.

Since most of the time I don't want word-splitting, I make it a
habit to use quotes around $-substitutions even when it isn't
strictly necessary.  That makes it clear (to me at least) when
word-splitting is the desired effect, such as
    files="a b c"
    out="x"
    cat $files > "$out"

How do I make grep output all lines of a file, after the first ocurrance
of a given text?

Say I have a log file that starts on July 1 and ends on August 5.  I
simply want to output the file, but beginning on July 15, for example.

Anyone familiar with Cisco "show run | begin ethernet0" will know what I
mean.

Thanks

Well, I can't think of a SIMPLE way to do it.

[Assuming gnu grep, now]

grep -A 99999999 regexp file

That will output 99999999 lines after and including the matched lines.
Kludgey, but I can't figure out how to say "everything".

It's either that or something UGLY like this:

FIRST_MATCH=`grep -n regexp file |head -1 |sed -e 's/\([0-9]*\):.*/\1/'`
tail -$[`wc -l file|sed -e 's/^ *\([0-9]*\) .*/\1/'` - $FIRST_MATCH +1] file

How do you like THAT shit?

Of course, I'd probably use perl.

Use sed instead.
    sed -n -e '/2003-07-15/,$ p' logfile
which means:
   for every line between
     the first line that matches /2003-07-15/
     and $ (the last line)
       print the line

The perl version:
    perl -ne 'print if /xxx/ .. eof' file

is basically identical to the sed version:
    sed -n '/xxx/,$ p' file

and the awk version:
    awk '/xxx/, END { print }' file

I can't think of any particular reason to prefer one over another
for simple things like this.  Use whatever's convenient and
familiar.

Works great with jpilot and evolution.  I haven't had any problems.

I followed the usb-visor howto.  THe only thing I had to do extra was mount 
the usb filesystem for evolution or unmount it for jpilot.

Okay, now that I got "echo" to stop stripping out my wanted spaces, how do
I pass the output of it to grep, surrounded by quotes?  The following is
broke because grep sees:

DATESTR=`date -d "today" '+%b %e'`
grep `echo "$DATESTR"` /var/log/maillog


grep Aug  3 /var/log/maillog

Grep doesn't like the space(s) between Aug and 3.  I have tried all sorts
of single- and double-quoting around the echo command, but it gets broken
in various ways.  Any easy fixes?

Perhaps I should explain my end goal instead of bugging plug every 15
minutes when I run into a new problem.  I simply want to make a daily (or
perhaps every 4 hours) cron job that emails me the output of every line of
my /var/log/maillog* which contains the word "reject" so I can keep track
of spams (for alerting me to  false positives).  Plus I get a small thrill
just seeing how many spams are correctly rejected.  There must be a
smarter way to do so than my current scripting efforts which have thus far
been a shameful embarrasment.  ;)  Advice is appreciated.

You don't need echo here,

grep "$DATESTR" /var/log/maillog


regexps are not one of my strengths, but there's a way to tell grep to find 
"$DATESTR and "reject" so you get only the lines you care about.

There's no need to use echo here.  You can just say
    grep "$DATESTR" /var/log/maillog

Trying to quote that version with echo is tricky, because of the
way sh re-parses strings.  You have to say something like:
    grep "`echo \"$DATESTR\"`" ...

which defers interpretation of the nested quotes until
appropriate.  This is kind of awkward.  Another way of doing it
is to use a temp var to hold the result of the backquotes:
    result=`echo "$DATESTR"`
    grep "$result" ...

Another another way is to use $() instead of backquotes:
    grep "$(echo "$DATESTR")"

Something like this should work:
    touch old
    grep "reject" /var/log/maillog* > new
    diff old new | grep '^>'
    mv new old

That should be ok for running every 4 hours.  If you have a lot
of logs and don't want to keep rescanning them all, then
something like this should work:
    touch old oldlogs

    # find any logs that changed
    ls -l /var/log/maillog* > newlogs
    changedlogs=$(diff oldlogs newlogs | awk '/^>/ { print $10 }')
    mv newlogs oldlogs

    # find interesting lines in the changed logs
    grep "reject" $changedlogs > new
    diff old new | grep '^>'
    mv new old

Untested, there's probably a few bugs in it.

AFAIK, they've been using it for several years now. The latest "new
world" (referring to the firmware generation) is OpenFirmware-derived,
as I believe the "old world" machines are. I'd have to power up my old
9600 clone to find out, though.

I went through PCC's CSET program.  It was actually pretty good.  Taught
me as much about software as a four-year CS degree would--though as you
know, most employers are asking for 4-year grads.  Taylor Hanna was
heading it at the time, and while he could be a jerk sometimes
personally (IMO), he was smart and articulate.

The program served me well at the time.  I got on at a downtown shop
before I had even graduated, and it only got better from there, until
the bubble burst.  Now I've been fishing for work for half a year with
scarcely a nibble.

Well, lamentations aside, I thought PCC's program pretty strong, and
worth a complete CS degree in preparing me for software engineering
work.  But I don't know if either will serve you right now.

Fairly easy.

When you get to security have your ticket in hand. When you get to the scanner 
they will want the laptop out of the bag an into their plastic container.  It 
has to be on the bottom, with nothing on top.  Place your keys, cell, coins 
and anything else metal in one of the small bowls they have and place it on 
the side (sorta on top) of the laptop in the tub.

If you can avoid all metal on your person, and get through the walkthrough 
scanner, you sail right through security.  If you don't it will take 5 more 
minutes.

I have to say last week was the first time that I traveled with the new TSC 
and it was smooth, professional, and they were nice.  They still had the same 
requirements for security but no waiting and no attitudes.

  You will need to take it out of the case and put it in a separate tray for
a trip through the x-ray machine. Done so dozens of times. Never a problem.

  On the "User Friendly" Web site, almost every day, is a banner with the
number of available computer related jobs in some on-line database. Has
anyone investigated these? I suppose that many would require relocation, but
that needs to be placed in perspective to the current situation locally.

I sent a number of resumes via monster, hotdog, hotjobs, dice,... All the call
backs I got, and finally a job, where from applying directly. I think monster,
and others like them, are being mostly used for EOE postings since most
"request" you supply EOE information when submitting a resume.. 

A large number of the postings were local candidates only, no relocation, don't
care if you'll pick up the tab to move yourself. The most insane were the
people wanting a CCIE for a $40,000 a year posting. The job requirements and
discriptions are very inflated, and the worst are usually head hunters looking
to fill an entry level position. Some even seem to have to be tailored to some
individual inside the company because of the specific knowledge wanted. 

Unless you're looking, you probably won't notice how the postings are worded to
keep people from applying instead of trying to attract candates. This is
probably because most postings still collect more resumes than they want. After
a while I posted my resume to all, no matter what they wanted, or how crazy.
You got to do what you got to do to survive. 

Good luck to all that are looking,
Russell

I have used j pilot with a VISOR connected via USB.

Avantgo is a Windows based program.  Unless you could
get it to operate via WINE, you can not use it with
Linux.

I read all the data on it and that was my conclusion.

Works great with jpilot and evolution.  I haven't had

I followed the usb-visor howto.  THe only thing I had

the usb filesystem for evolution or unmount it for

Hi,
	I would like to re-submit a question I asked last week.

	One of my servers uses RH 7.2.  When I use the update utility provided up
RedHat the directory /var/spool/up2date becomes populated with *.rpm and
*.hdr files.

	My question is:  Is it okay to delete files from this directory after the
updates have completed?

				Thanks in advance, James Anchell

James,

I don't see any reason why you can't remove them. I think they are just
cached files. 

On this page:
http://linuxrefresher.com/installation/update.htm

it says:

"If you wish to archive the rpm files for these updates, you can copy
them to archive media from /var/spool/up2date."

I'm fairly certain that the .hdr files are just the RPM headers and then
the .rpm's are the actual update files. 

Someone can feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

Thanks,

-Cory

That's not true.  Look at malsync.  Works great once it's set up and working.

Message-ID: <20030804102713.A10443@cogit8.org>

The other day my wife got an email from 'admin at vdomain1.com', one of my
domains.  (I'm hiding the identity of the true domain to avoid spam
harvesters.)  I didn't send it, and in the header there was no prior
servers listed so it appeared as if it was a direct connect to my
server.  Checking the logs I found this...

Aug  2 07:47:16 saaz postfix/smtpd[98033]: 5DB3C1A39B: client=unknown[200.60.186.102]

domain.org is my main domain.
vdomain1.com is a virtual.

The 'mynetworks' setting in the main.cf file lists the IPs for my
domains and my IP for my cable modem connection only.

I'm not sure how this message was sent, or if I should be worried.  Can
this person only send these types of messages to my local users (in this
case, just me and my wife)?

Thanks,
Rob

It's a very sad situation that professional web development

  Yes, spammers spoof the originating address quite frequently. The 200/8
series has been assigned to latin America and the owner can be found on
lacnic's whois server.

  The header is more informative than is the mail log.

  I get spam like this quite frequently -- when it gets past the postfix

  I've noticed that my touchpad stopped working after I switched to a USB

Hm, just plug it in?  That's all I've had to do with RH8 & 9 with
ThinkPad models T20 and R32.  Ohhhh... But I've got the eraser-head PS/2
mouse, not a touch pad, which is probably USB itself.

Wil,

You can operate the eraser-head & USB mouse w/out any problems. I had a
Dell laptop with both the touch-pad & eraser-head and it was trivial to
get the eraser-head & a USB mouse working at the same time. It wasn't as
easy with the touchpad. 

I think you would just need to define both your touch-pad and usb-mouse
in your XF86config file for both of them to work. I wish I could help
more, but I don't have my laptop anymore, which makes testing
impossible..

However, it can have as many other mice as you want by using the Option SendCoreEvents flag. You could probably add a usb hub and a dozen mice and get them all to work at once, then have BattleMouse between friends! =) (haven't tried)

The situation locally is not much better or worse than the situation
nationwide, I've been looking (for more than a year). The stuff on
userfriendly are links to Dice, one of several on-line job sites (not
the best one IMHO).  I would hope that anybody looking for a job is
using every resource including dice.

James,

I don't see any reason why you can't remove them. I think they are just
cached files.

On this page:
http://linuxrefresher.com/installation/update.htm

it says:

"If you wish to archive the rpm files for these updates, you can copy
them to archive media from /var/spool/up2date."

I'm fairly certain that the .hdr files are just the RPM headers and then
the .rpm's are the actual update files.

Someone can feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

Thanks,

-Cory

You can also define them in the "ServerLayout" section. With this you'll
be able to plug and un-plug your usb mouse at anytime and it will work
without restarting X

here's an example your section would look like something this.

Section "ServerLayout"
	Identifier     "Default Layout"
	Screen      0  "Screen0" 0 0
	InputDevice    "Mouse0" "CorePointer"
	InputDevice    "Keyboard0" "CoreKeyboard"
	InputDevice    "DevInputMice" "AlwaysCore"
EndSection

And mouse sections would look something like this:

Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier  "Mouse0"
	Driver      "mouse"
	Option	    "Protocol" "PS/2"
	Option	    "Device" "/dev/mouse"
	Option	    "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"
	Option	    "Emulate3Buttons" "yes"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier  "DevInputMice"
	Driver      "mouse"
	Option	    "Protocol" "IMPS/2"
	Option	    "Device" "/dev/input/mice"
	Option	    "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"
	Option	    "Emulate3Buttons" "no"

I recently went through airport security with three notebook
computers. Though it attracted much interest and the security
people asked why I needed so many, I was able to pas through
security without any extraordinary delays. Security-wise,
they were more interested in my shoes than my computers.

The quality of big-ISP DNS-related services is eroding.
I do quite a bit of consulting in the area of DNS and
I've noticed slowdowns in two areas:

1.Getting non-authoritative answers from big-ISP DNS
  servers/caches seems to be getting slower. I first
  noticed this problem when a customer complained about
  his Windows computers not being able to get to Web
  sites. Internet Explorer would fail with an error.

  The Windows computers were pointing to his ISPs DNS
  servers. A trace of the packets revealed that the
  servers frequently took more than two to four seconds
  to respond - even if the name had been resolved in the
  recent past. A temporary solution was to patch the
  Registry to make Windows more tolerant of delays.

  The solution was to stop using his ISP's DNS servers.
  He was then getting many or most answers in less than
  20 milliseconds.

2.Big-ISP DNS servers often take hours to do a zone transfer
  once notified. I've been monitoring this closely for my
  customers who host their DNS here. Four hour delays are
  not unusual. For customers who consider this a problem,
  the solution is to stop using the ISP's DNS servers.

Using big-ISP DNS services always seems to be a problem in
one way or another.

This may not answer your question directly.

I just spent the weekend adding some CSS coding to
a web site I was designing. I was amazed at how
differently web pages using CSS were rendered with
different web browsers. I was developing with a text
editor. I'd look at the pages with 4 different
browsers as I was writing HTML/style sheets. I'd
often have to give up on a certain technique and
use something different to get the browsers to
render similarly.

I think a GUI tool would have slowed the process
down quite a bit. But perhaps a GUI design tool
might be aware of the browser differences and
automatically choose the best technique. I don't know.

Mozilla seemed to have the best support for CSS for
the things I was doing. IE support was pretty awful
but I'm not using a recent version. I can't
download a new version of IE because I don't have
enough room on drive C: and there seems to be no way
to install on another drive. The same problem exists
with Netscape 7.1. Netscape allows me to select another
drive but still tells me that I don't have enough room
on drive C. Perhaps there a secret for stealthy
drive selection I don't know about

Are Windows designers getting more stupid as time goes
on?

Message-ID: <1060029190.5528.39.camel@zadie>

Oh horror of horrors, I ordered MSN broadband (dsl). They gave me a
decent deal, and it was better than what I was using before that (free
AOL =). So I got the modem, and discovered that it acted as a DHCP
server/NAT router. I was delighted. I could just plug in a hub to the
thing and get multiple computers going instantly, no need to buy a
40-80$ router/NAT (I know, I could have, and will, make a cheap computer
into a router, but I didn't have any at the time). 

MSN Broadband, however, has built their modems to only allow one IP
address at a time. If you dhcp-request an ip, it gives it to you and
then blocks all other ip addresses. It was truly bizarre.

So since I had nothing but two laptops, a hub, and this cranky modem (it
also sometimes decides that if there are multiple people dhcping it, it
should shut off), I had to come up with a novel solution.

So here it is:

the One NIC NAT

with IP Aliasing, you can split your nic into two ip addresses, on two
different subnets, like this:

ifconfig eth0:0 192.168.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.0
ifconfig eth0:1 192.168.2.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
ifconfig eth0:0 up
ifconfig eth0:1 up
ifconfig eth0 up
route add default gw 192.168.1.1

and then with iptables put together a nat using the same nic for both
the input and the output ports.

#!/bin/sh
 
/sbin/iptables --flush
/sbin/iptables --table nat --flush
/sbin/iptables --delete-chain
/sbin/iptables --table nat --delete-chain
 
/sbin/iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface eth0 -j
MASQUERADE
/sbin/iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface eth0 -j ACCEPT
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

Then anyone else who wants to be on the network just gives themselves a
192.168.2.x (x>2) ip address and points at 192.168.2.1 as the gateway.

And no, I don't have a question. And if you put it in your interfaces
(/etc/network/interfaces on debian) it'll come up like that. I'm just
pointing this out for anyone who didn't know it. If everyone knew it and
wants to tell me to shut up, I shall do so. =)

And thanks to David Konsumer, if he's on this list, or anyone who knows
him is, for pointing out to me that Linux can do IP aliasing.

Sorry Jason.
I was out of work for 23 months. I'm now working on a 1099 for $20 hr, from 
my previous job at $140k. Happy to have it right now!
My brother-in-law went to PCC and got his Associates in CS. He had 1 6mo 
job installing Win 2k for the Water Dept. Hasn't worked since and to be 
honest, PCC didn't really prepare him with any real skill sets that are 
needed in todays market. Of course he just "slid" through the program, but 
there were not any checks and balances on the program or the "councilor" he 
had to advise him properly. When I went to PCC in the early 70's, everyone 
had some decent skill sets to gain employment. I went to PCC again during 
my first year of being unemployed to upgrade some of my skills. The classes 
were fine, just not aggressive enough to help students get the tools they need.

Good Luck and Good Hunting.

Subject: [PLUG] cisco 678 DSL latency issues
Message-ID: <20030805045851.GC19221@silver.CS.ORST.EDU>

I've recently subscribed to DSL (changing from comcast) and everything
works great, but only in Windows.

I'm running bridged with a cisco 678, 640/256, static ip.  If the
cisco is plugged into a windows box everything works great, ping times
are arround 90ms.  However, booting into Linux causes ping times to
jump to 2000ms, connectivity and bandwith are fine, but latency is
horrid (I can download a kernel at 40k/s or better, but it takes
2000ms for the xfer to start).

I've tried three computers and two phone jacks, two of the computers
dual boot (the third is my router, and runs only linux--everything is
Debian).  In all situations Windows works fine (90 ms ping) and Linux
does awefully (2000ms).  

Searching cisco's site mentioned that Linux boxen may have difficulty
connecting to cisco hardware without term/termcap, however installing
termcap-compat on my laptop (one of the dual-boot boxes) has had no
effect (possibly a _small_ change, 1800ms is probably the average).

Can anyone reccomend a way to better troubleshoot this? Qwest and my
isp (Unicom, wich I've been very happy with barring this issue) are
completely lost and I'm not sure what to look for. 

All the Linux boxes have been running 2.4.18 or 2.4.20 custom kernels,
and they work fine with my comcast (cable) connection (well, as fine
as anything works with comcast).

Thanks,
Rogan Creswick

I might as well complete the threadjack and ask if people know any other
good resources for finding jobs online . . .
I heard the PDX area had the highest number of unemployed folks in the tech
sector in the nation, I know several people with BS degrees, ccnas, ccies,
etc who are making $15 an hour or some equally pitiful amount, so I'm not
exactly too optimistic about what I can get.

If you want to feel a bit more bitter, check out the oregon employment
department's website and compare the amount of managerial positions to
computer related ones. Then feel better when you see what they are getting
"paid".
Oh well, at least I have spare time to play tux racer and program my pocket
pc . . .

The situation locally is not much better or worse than the situation
nationwide, I've been looking (for more than a year). The stuff on

the best one IMHO).  I would hope that anybody looking for a job is

It makes no difference.  Pinging my Qwest gateway by ip in Linux
results in 2000ms pings, while pinging the same ip in Windows takes
only ~60ms. I've also tried two different dns servers on both sides.

I get the same results with engr.orst.edu (by name and ip).

Hi,
 I have a Lexmark z23 with RH 7.2. I have downloaded the driver and 
successfully installed it. The problem is that whenever I try to print 
something it goes to the printer, the inkjet move to start writing and then
it suddenly aborts the printing process.
 Has anyone had any success getting the z23/33 to work with Linux?

Have you compared the Windows setup to the Linux setup? 

ifconfig ethX  vs ipconfig /all

and

netstat -rn	vs I can't remember if windows netstat will give you the route
table or the flags needed if it does.

What do your IP tables look like? 

iptables -L

Using Ethereal to look at the traffic might give you an idea of what the issue
is.  

This is a long shot, but

cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range

If the fisrt number is 1024 do an 

echo 1025-4999 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range

I had a 675, route mode not bridging, doing nat and it would map port 1024 on
the inside ethernet  to port zero on the DSL interface. It would be really odd
if this was an issue with your set up, but its something to try if the normal
issues aren't what is dinking your set up.

Thank you
Russell

I would run ethereal to determine what is going on.  If possible, connect
both the windows and linux boxes to a hub and snoop the traffic.  If
you are pinging by IP and it is still slow, maybe there is an arp
problem.

The ip info (ip, gateway, netmask, dns) is the same accross OS's. I'm
following up on another lead from Unicom or I'd reboot to double check
right now.

this looks to be the same output as route -n, and looks normal (to me):

Kernel IP routing table
Destination       Gateway         Genmask         ...
216.104.67.224    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.224  U     0    0    0   eth0

The numbers correspond to my networki(216.104.67.224),
mask(255.255.255.224) and gateway(216.104.67.225) as they should.

The current box I'm on (my laptop) dosen't have iptables. (never
thought I needed it on the laptop). So I don't think this is an issue.

Not currently installed, and there is very little traffic (netstat
-vatu shows no established connections when sitting idle, as expected
for a linux laptop).

Is it possible in Linux to assign more than one group to a particular
directory? For example, suppose group "business" and group "hr" need
write access to a directory. Is it possible to add a group as a member
of another group?

  Yes!

  Several years ago I discovered the lack of a local group and tried to get
something going -- the unavailable archives probably have my message hidden
away in the dust.

  I'm certainly interested.

I have a Cisco 678 running in bridged mode, and I do not have a 2 second
latency.  Have you installed the latest firmware on the 678?  Are you
giving the connection enough time to straighten out the ARP tables
(anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes)?  Have you tried to power down, wait 2
minutes, power up (this should reset the connection at the other end)? 
BTW, download rates should peak at about 68k/s.

Are you saying that each ping packet takes 2 sec. to return, or just the
first packet?  Does tcptraceroute show where the slow down is?

This seems like more of an ISP problem than a Cisco problem.  In
bridging mode, the Cisco should let anything and everything pass right
through.

Yes, I installed 2.4.6 last night in hopes of fixing this
problem. Previously it was running 2.4.1 (CBOS).

The problem has persisted for hours of "use" with enough idle time
that I don't think this is a problem, but I have probably not turned
on a router and let it sit for 15 min wlout any network activity.

This has no effect.

nods, once established, file transfers are at expected speeds.

Each packet takes 2 sec. to return. The delay is between my cisco 678
and the qwest gateway.  I can't go _anywhere_ without this delay
(unless I'm in windows, then it all works fine).

This is also not an icmp only problem, tcp is also affected (I dont
use ipx).

> > effect (possibly a _small_ change, 1800ms is probably the average).

This change was a freak of nature, still at 2000ms. (Just a FYI).

I would agree entirely, if Windows didn't work flawelessly in this regard.

Who or what industry uses "coders" who can't design?  or maybe I don't
know what a coder is.  In my 25 years of programming I don't think I've
ever done any work that did not require some design.  Though I've been
in the embedded systems/systems programming area.

I'm registered for PSU this fall, after more than a year out of work,
I'm gonna finish my degree 30 years after I started. going for a BSCE,
if I don't get an offer before classes start.

generally not currently,  what you can do, is set up a "group" in
/etc/group, that contains the people you what to have access to that
file/directory.

Hi.

I'm in very preliminary discussions with a company regarding the
implementation of a POS and appointment scheduling system.  Customer is
VERY interested in GPL or merely Open Source software because of previous
vendor lock-in.

There are some apparently very mature systems out there, but none have
integretated appointment scheduling of the type that might be required and
I think perhaps the integration with inventory control systems will have
to be customized.

Ultimately, the project will require a developer (likely C++ with some
knowledge of Gnome) for the integration task and a sysadmin/developer for
long-term management and administration.  It's possible that this could be
the same person.

It should be understood up front that a successful outing here could yield
a product that is viable to replace an industry (sub)standard piece of
software with a Free/Open equivalent.  This software could then be
re-implemented at other similar institutions.  Then a network of local
admins/developers could be developed that kept customers happy over time
with patches, feature updates, and general knowledge sharing.

I'm interested in hearing from anyone who believes they have the requisite
skills to work on this project.  Please understand that cost is very much
an issue and part of the reason for not continuing with the proprietary
solution.

A rough estimate of cost (perhaps hourly rate?) would be nice.  Of course,
it's all pending serious discussion.

J.

How does Qwest fit into this?  I thought your ISP was Unicom, that is
where your gateway should be.  Qwest should only be providing the low
level transport to your ISP.

Which makes me think that something is not configured correctly on your
linux boxes, but I can't imagine what it would be.

Sorry I can't be more helpful.

I'm sorry, it probably is Unicom's gateway.

I agree, the theory of the moment is that it is an auto-negotiation
problem between the cisco and the linux box(es).  I'm trying to figure
out how to set this firmly on the linux side, but I'm having some
issues. First off, I've not really dealt with this before, and I
haven't been able to find much info about modes for use with ifconfig
or in /etc/network/interfaces (all are debian boxes).  I've seen some
mutterings that these things are adapter-dependant?

If anyone can help me out here I'd be very grateful.

Thanks again,
Rogan

Reply-To munging is dumb and broken!!!

Can we fix this?  We're all intelligent people that know how to configure
our mail clients to reply where we want it to reply, but I'll be damned if
I'm going to break APPROPRIATE use of the Reply-To header for this list.

Ahh, yes, this old flamewar again ;-)
In all seriousness, I'd think mailman would be smart enough (or
configurable enough) to not set the Reply-To header on mails to the list
with that header already set (i.e. mails that people went out of their
way to ensure were not replied-to on list).  Perhaps enough people with
MUA's that don't have a "Reply To List" option also set Reply-To on all
of their outgoing mails?

In lieu of turning of munging completely, I'd think there would be a
happy medium where the actual, intended, semantics of the Reply-To
header could be respected if present, rather than trampling all over the
email all the time.

Try to ping by address and make sure to use the '-n' option to ping.  If
that solves it, your DNS settings are incorrect.

A lot of app's can be slapped together without a formal design phase;
they just take a lot longer and tend to be full of bugs.  When I was
Director Of Tech' at a dot-com, I had a CS grad in my charge, who came
in with a steamroller approach to coding:  just open a new file and
start typing.  Very concrete thinker (no pun intended), but a very hard
worker, so he got stuff done--albeit with much backtracking.  I've known
a number of programmers like that, some even in the CSET program at PCC.
Most of them don't go very far.

But to clarify, I'm talking about code design, not product design.  If
you mean to say product design is essential, you're absolutely correct,
since without knowing what the software is supposed to do, there is
little hope of designing it well.  Alas, this, too, I know from
experience.

Yeah.  I was thinking the same thing.  The responsible thing to do

So I guess the answer is that coming from embedded systems and systems
programming I have not seen many of these.  Very few small apps.

Does this _really_ make any difference to ping?  Surely, ping must
resolve the name _before_ it sends its first packet so that the ping
statistics shouldn't be affected by slow DNS.

No, you're right, but it's such a common problem that messages about
ping being slow automatically make me ask.

Have you tried placing a hub between your box and the 678?

This will not work!  At least not for RedHat 8, and every other Unix
variant I've worked with ... granted, that's only been a dozen or so ...

 (1)  /etc/group entries must have 4 fields:
         groupname:gpasswd:gid:[user1[,user2]]

 (2)  It only accepts lists of users, not groupnames in the last field.


Use grpck(8) to verify your changes!

After a quick look at the newest mailman (2.1.2) it appears as though
munging options have been expanded somewhat from version 2.0.11 that
we are currently using.  Remains to be seen whether the changes are
actually what we were looking for though.

Yes, I refer to smaller, more self-contained systems.  Still, it's
surprising that you haven't met at least a few of these brute-force
programmers.  You must have in school, but evidently that was a while
ago.

Well when I started out even systems were smaller.  I guess that I never
paid much attention to the work habits of others and I have been
"accused" of "jazz" programming.  I do not design things in detail and I
use the compiler to catch a lot of syntax errors, but I always have a
goal in mind, a design in my head.

In school I heard about "coders" but like I say I've never been anywhere
that actually had any.

See, there's a can of worms, because I could argue there is always a
design of some sort in mind.  No meaningful code could be written
without it.  But I hold such in contrast to a complete, formal design,
the necessity of which is sometimes less palpable.

If I were to define the term, I'd say a coder is one who writes code,
preferably according to a formal design, but which isn't necessarily his
own.  It's a diminutive epithet, one which I often apply to myself for
the sake of modesty.  We could call ourselves "software architects", but
unless your company were large enough to render such a lofty term
useful, it would seem vainglorious.  Of course, having said that, I
should probably change my resume now.  ;)

I've been deliberately ignoring this thread for a while, but you finally
got me. Maybe it's a troll, but either way, you are radically
misunderstanding Computer Science.

There's a reason large technical schools have both a computer science
and a computer programming (and information systems, etc) degree.

Computer science is a theoretical subject. It involves computation,
complexity, algorithm analysis (yes, design too), and many other things.
Parsing, language and compiler design, neural networks, artificial
intelligence, _these_ are the subjects of Computer Science. Software
engineering is usually relegated a secondary role in a theoretical
Computer Science degree, which you can view as good or bad, but it is.

But this is not to say that Computer Science degrees know nothing--what
they know is different. I have never yet met someone who graduated with
a Software Engineering, Computer Programming, or other similar degree
who could really analyze the time constraints of an algorithm, and
similarly, of code. Or who understood that there are tradeoffs between
algorithms, and why. Quicksort is the one people always use, even though
in some situations there are better algorithms. 

I am, of course, talking about people right out of college. People with
much experience have a totally different look at the subject.

I happen to be an anomaly--a CS major who can program. But I didn't
learn how to program from my school. Several of my friends graduated
from the CS degree lamenting their inability to program.

But man, we could talk about, and analyze stuff, that would make your
head spin.

mii-tool and/or ethtool doesn't work on some cards I've found. If you
have one of these NIC's you might want to add the: 

options <nic_driver_name> full_duplex=1

line in /etc/modules.conf. In order to make that active you'll have to
either reboot or jump through the hoops of downing the interface and
doing the rmmod/depmod/modprobe/insmod combo that works for your dist.

I take no exceptions to your explanation, but how did my posts prompt
it?  I realize programming is but one facet of a CS degree.  And if I
seemed to imply that CS grad's are thus lesser programmers starting
out, then the fact as well grants them pardon for it; although I
apologize if this unintended suggestion was cause for offense.  By my
sword, I am no troll!

By the way, a very good friend of mine who graduated with me from the
PCC software program went on to get a four-year CS degree at OIT.
Whatever he learned about algorithms, parsers and compilers, he told me
himself that it did little to advance his skill as a programmer (an
opinion your comments seem to support).  But as to the original topic of
this thread, time will tell whether the BS degree will take him farther
than my associate's degree.  I must hope, if there is a "glass ceiling",
that it depends on the market, and that the market will soon thrive
again.

I don't know that anyone here would balk at yet another flag in the
Mailman preferences that allowed reply-to munging on a per user rather
than per list basis.

Heh.

That's a pretty good one, Jason.

The blind faith of the capitalists always brings me a wan little smile.

I smile, then I shake my head, then I frown a bit and choke back a tear.

I was once at the top of castles made of sand.

Subject: [PLUG] ANNOUNCEMENT: New Contact Information for PLUG and David Mandel
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0307231020320.2393-100000@sco302.DavidMandel.com>


I want to let everyone know that I have taken a full time teaching
position at Pioneer Pacific College <PioneerPacific.edu> in
Springfield, Oregon.  (Actually, I've been at PPC for over a month,
but I'm just getting around to making the announcement.)
As a result of this change:

    (1)  I will continue my activities with the Portland Linux/Unix Group.
         I teach most evenings, but Pioneer Pacific College is
         very committed to Open Source Software and will attempt
         to free me for PLUG meetings on the first Thursday of
         the month.  I'm also hoping to make a clinic now and then,
         which is something I couldn't ever do in the past.

    (2)  I'm selling my Portland house, so the official PLUG contact
         information will change as follows:

         Old Address:  Portland Linux/Unix Group
                       1440 NE 59th
                       Portland, Oregon 97213
                       (503) 284-9723
                       (541) 730-5285 mobile
                       dmandel at pdxLinux.org

         New Address:  Portland Linux/Unix Group
                       560 SE Alexander
                       Corvallis, Oregon 97333
                       (541) 752-3769
                       (541) 730-5285 mobile
                       dmandel at pdxLinux.org

    (3)  My former employer, Micro Sharp Technology <www.MicroSharp.com>,
         will continue to sponsor PLUG.  (Micro Sharp helps PLUG
         in a number of ways, most visibly by hosting PLUG's
         server(s).  Micro Sharp also hosts my personal sites and
         provides me with equipment for some of my Open Source projects.)


                                          David Mandel
                                          Chief Activist
                                          Portland Linux/Unix Group
                                          560 SE Alexander
                                          Corvallis, Oregon 97333
                                          (541) 730-5285 cell
                                          dmandel at pdxLinux.org

   P.S.  The Netule project I managed for Micro Sharp is pretty much
         dead as a commercial project, but I'm hoping to create a
         very small 100% Open Source spin-off from this project.

   P.S.  Oh boy, I have hundreds of web pages and signatures and other
         stuff with the wrong information that I need to update.

Let me add what I didn't have time to add before. You have said in
several of your posts that you worship at the gate of the Design
Document, and the Plan, and that anyone who jumps in without a formal
specification written is a bad programmer. Maybe you haven't been quite
that extreme, but that's the direction you've been going with your
statements.

And you claim this to have been taught to you as the gospel of Software
Engineering, when in fact the chief reason why Software Engineering is
barely included in the curriculum of Computer Science is that,
accurately enough, Computer Scientists are skeptical that Software
Engineers _know_ anything. They all believe something, but they all
believe different things.

One of the major "movements" in Software Engineering is eXtreme
Programming, and while part of it recommends planning, part of it
recommends high flexibility--write what you need for the feature you're
working on now, rather than trying to think through to every feature,
because inevitably you won't be able to, and inevitably you'll end up
working way out of your way for something you think might happen a year
down the road, when that feature gets cut, or worse, turns out to be
much easier than you foresaw, you've wasted a huge amount of time. 

Ultimately, planning is a useful tool, and should never be completely
ignored, but is not the Deity you make it out to be.

Jeff

The LinuxPrinting.org website has this printer defined as a 
"paperweight" but that there may be a binary only driver available for 
it.

Anytime you are contemplating using or buying a printer to use under 
Linux, you should consult this website first IMHO:

Along these lines, one ought to read chapter 1 of _On Lisp_, by Paul
Graham (of "A Plan for Spam" fame).  Long out of print, it is now
available online as PDF:

Thanks! That seems to do the trick, although I'm having some issues
with what the cisco says it is set at and what is needed to actually
connect to it. (it claims 10baseTx-HD, when 100baseTx-HD is needed,
but I don't think that's a big problem.)

What I am still curious about is why is this a problem in the first
place? Is auto-negotiation particularly difficult with cisco hardware
or is there something I'm missing? Where would I look to start if I
were to attempt a patch for this?

Thanks again for all your help and reccomendations!

You're taking my statements too far.  My point was that design is a
critical skill for software engineers (as Mr. Beattie would seem to
agree; and in both senses of the word "critical"), and that some of them
fail to learn and use it as they should.  Unless you believe design is
altogether needless, which you apparently do not, then nothing
I've said could be taken as fanaticism, and there's no need for the
antagonization of a religious metaphor.

This appears false.  As you yourself have already pointed out, the
domain of CS is theoretical, hence it is not as concerned with teaching
the practical skills of development.  The software course at PCC was
largely practical, and design was emphasized, quite practically, as a
means of writing software efficiently, not as the Way Of Enlightenment.
It seems to me that the practitioners of CS would have little to say
against that approach, and that software engineering is secondary for
them only because of the scope of their domain.

So as part of the pain of change you'll be looking at CMS systems so you 
don't have to have this pain again.  Right?  And you'll do a presentation

  I just did a project with those guys!  The whole organization seemed to be
pathologically opposed to sitting down and planning out the code *before*
they started writing.  Their "design methodology" was "the programmer sits
down and start writing C".  

  Now, I have seen that methodology work in the past.  I've even used it
myself a time or two. ;-)  But it takes a very skilled or very dedicated
programmer to pull it off.  The cats I was working with possessed neither
trait.

  We went through dozens of false steps and software failures before the
project finally tanked.

I've never seen this, or if I did I must have ignored it and gone about
my the bigger the job, the more detailed the design, but lets not go
overboard and design a 747 when we want a toy airplane :)

Thats true, the better the staff, the less detail you need and on some
smaller stuff all you need are the goals.

I've seen over-design and redesign and redesign will kill a project too.

If it were easy anybody could do it.

When I have interviewed people I'm more concerned with their
intelligence than their experience had one guy with an advanced degree
in CS, completely useless.

Ah, but Software Engineering _would be_ the domain of Computer Science,
if it were empirical and could therefore be studied theoretically (and
therefore tested empirically).

In fact, many CS programs have attempted to do this. The fact that they
haven't succeeded says something.

I'm not so sure, I suspect the natural antipathy of "Scientists" for
"Engineers" I don't know how many schools still put CS under the Math
Dept. but I would suspect that these schools CS faculty would have a
real problem with "Software Engineering".  I am of the firm opinion that
the notion that programming is closely related to math has done more to
slow the advance of software engineering than any thing else.

  They aren't local, or even West coast.  You should never meet.  Other than
that, It wouldn't be wise to comment in a public forum.

  I didn't want to design a 747.  I wanted *some* rational design that we
could all agree would be a working concept.  Especially after the 3rd or 4th
failed attempt.

  I rarely break out a the old Cobol flow chart templates for little shell
and perl scripts.  Anything bigger that that, I like to have some kind of
thought out design.  I never do rigorous design any more, but then of
course, I'm not a programmer any more either.

  Some of the best programmers I've worked with didn't have programming
degrees.  One guy had degree in Theatrical Arts.

All you're saying here is that Software Engineering isn't a science.

Phew.  That's some bold philosophical statement!  You're way out on a limb
on that one!

Engineers aren't scientists.  Teachers aren't scientists.  Farmers are not
scientists.  I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

Science has its place (that is, the advancement of human self-knowledge
and understanding).  Those other folks have more base concerns.  Both are
pretty darned important.

I had a good friend and great coworker who used to say, "Programming is
the art of debugging the empty file."

For the most part, he would just sit down and write.  And he turned out
really good work.  On some projects (particularly those that involved
other people or were exceptionally novel), he would do some design work,
but mostly he was a "sit down and start writing C" kind of guy.

It takes all kinds.

I kind of know what you are talking about, there was one job I had where
I was doing sys/net admin so I was not directly involved in the
technical side that seemed to be doing that, though they did seem to be
doing design work, or maybe that was just marketing doing the
requirements.

But whether it was redesign, redesign or no design it was totally
screwed up, pissed away a good opportunity.  

I remember another one, where the manager spent half the project
defining a standard for function and variable names(much like the MS
nonsense), I don't think he ever delivered either.

I suspect that good programmers are born, not made :).  In any case all
the book learning in the world won't make a good programmer.  It is a
craft, not a science.  That may change, just as other crafts have
succumb to industrialization and automation but not yet.  We keep trying
to come up with ways to automate the process or at least remove the
"art", Structured Programming, 4GL, 5GL, Object Oriented Programming,
whatever else.  I can't see that they make all that much difference.

true. =)

Ah...actually, Engineering is based on the science of physics. It isn't
a science, because there's intuition involved, but it is heavily based
on the science of physics. Same with farming and agricultural science,
although to a lesser extent.

Teachers aren't scientists, and educational science doesn't really
exist, which may account for there being such a huge discrepancy between
the quality of teachers. Same with Software Engineers, because it's not
truly based on Computer Science, or Software Engineering Science, or
whatever you'd call it. It's based on theories which everybody disagrees
about. At least if you ask an engineer what theories he's basing his
next project on, he can give you theories of physics which are generally
agreed on.

Yes, and intuitive, creative, productive processes are frequently done
better on a large scale when based on empirically testable science.

yeah, it's probably true. Although an analytical mindset really helps in
debugging, it is a craft.

Could somebody tell me please what good IMAP programs are

Some engineering is based on the science of physics.  Engineering is
applying science for design and implementation.  It doesn't matter what
science you're attempting to apply to the real world.  It's all
engineering.

> It isn't a science, because there's intuition involved, but it is
> heavily based on the science of physics.

Physics is an attempt by human beings to describe perception of physical
phenomena within the framework of a normal human brain's logic circuitry.
There are ways in which a strong understanding of that perception can be
reverse-applied to the real world in an attempt to attain some other
condition of existence.  But physics, like all sciences, is inherently
limited (to human perception, the limits of calculability, scope of
understood influences, etc.) and so we have artistry.

Brain logic (which we formalize as mathematics) became standard in the
human being because it was good enough.  There's no reason to believe it
is exactly analogous to the guiding principles of the objective universe.
It's nice for us to think that it is because a) it makes is feel like
we're capable of understanding things even if we're not and b) we don't
have any alternative way of investigating and formalizing that is
describable and reproducible and we seem to have a deep drive to
investigate and formalize.

In other words, science is as faulty as any other method of human thought,
but it unfortunately carries with it an unjustifiable air of certainty and
absolute truth.

As the decisions we make (based on science that is not necessarily
objectively true for many possible reasons) become larger and larger with
greater and greater reaching impact, we need to take into account both the
limitations of existing science and our own minds and recognize that
truth, beauty, love, and justice come as much from intuition and chance as
from calculation and machination.

> Same with farming and agricultural science, although to a lesser extent.

Agricultural science is not engineering at all.  (And I would even argue
that farming is distinct from agricultural engineering.)

But if you ask him WHY he's doing the work, he'll give you intuitive
theories upon which people are deeply divided (or at least for which you
can find several equally valid, opposing views).

And, of course, the devil is in the details.  This hypothetical engineer
is basing his design decisions on principles of physics and hopefully
there is an engineer elsewhere analyzing the impact of the design (again,
based on scientific principles).  But there is no methodology for
accounting for all factors in the real world.  It's transcendental in
nature.  And there's no telling which of the factors that the engineer was
unable to include or comprehend might vastly change the outcome of the
project.

To my mind, science belongs in a laboratory and should be brought into the
real world sparingly and with great care and consideration.

The larger the scale, the harder it is for a person to get their head
around it and account for everything that matters and take responsibility
for things that are effected.

What Don says is true. My memory serves me incorrectly. The only way,
then, is to create a new group that contains the users from both the
business and the hr groups.

Indeed, as anyone with programming experience knows, the majority of
software applications require very little serious math.  They consist of
loop counters, bitwise operations, and other such simplicities.  I used
to write financial calculators, which involved some basic algebra, but
even so, the user interface took far more effort than the math.

      We just got our speaker for August.  Dale Zeutenhorst has
      been kind enough to step up and lead a discussion of MSEC
      and prelude and other security features in Mandrake Linux.
      He has some good things to say, but he also says his
      presentation may be a bit short and he would be happy to
      share time with someone else with another short topic.

Message-ID: <00cf01c35d34$27940340$bf00000a@quantecllc.com>

Hello, all.

I recently upgraded our server to PHP4.3.2, and now, when I start httpd, it
gives the following error:

[Thu Aug 7 19:04:34 2003] [warn] Loaded DSO extramodules/libphp4.so uses
plain Apache 1.3 API, this module might crash under PI! (please recompile it
with -DEAPI)

I'm not sure what flags to set in order to make it *not* have Apache issue
the warning.

Google search and php.net searches for the DEAPI turned up nothing even
remotely useful.

Any place y'all can recommend to go look?

Thanks.

Subject: [PLUG] $25 firewall
Message-ID: <1060316042.1276.1.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Yes, you can build a Linux firewall for $25.  No, it's not a mid-tower
486
you find in the attic or at garage sale.  I'm talking about a sleek,
small
firewall with little memory and no hard drive, no fan and no noise.

I've developed a small Linux distro I call COST Linux.  I've done a
presentation at ALG a short while ago, but this time, I'm thinking about
showing you how to build an embedded Linux firewall with cheap harware
which
you can get from eBay for about ~$25.  Features includes:

- Linux 2.4.x kernel
- Netfilter iptables with Shorewall as the firewall configurator.
- dhcp client/server
- shell access via ssh.
- 8MB flash, 16MB memory, no HD, no fan, no noise!

enough to run your home firewall/router which you have total control
of.  I have
collected various hardware and successfully hacked them.  I'll bring a
few
samples for show and tell.

Sorry for the cross posting, but I thought this is something everyone
would be
interested.  I've done my previous presentation at the IBM site, which I
prefer
to repeat.  ALG, can we schedule something?  CTLLUG, would you like to
come?

Has anyone heard of the above, and if so, what is the consensus?
TIA, Dirk

Where in my /etc/profile do I add the following? Is it somewhere in the
pathmunge area?

After that you must modify your /etc/profile or ~/.bash_profile file by
adding
PATH=..../bin:$PATH
JDK_HOME=..., 
where .... is path to your JDK installation (something like
/usr/java/....).

export PATH JDK_HOME



[  My path is /usr/java/j2re1.4.1_04 ]

You can add the path wherever your other custom path elements are added
("pathmunge"?).  I do it at the top of /etc/profile.  But as many people
do, I have a symlink to my Java installation, /usr/local/java, so I add
/usr/local/java/bin to the path.  This way I can swap java versions
easily.

And if you're going to set JDK_HOME, you should also set JAVA_HOME,
since that is probably used oftener.  But Sun recommends you set these
in separate scripts rather than in the profile, in case you need to use
different Java versions for different app's.

are you building php from source? or are you using a package?

apxs for building from source should configure things correctly...from what
I remember...
I've recieved errors using packages before...

I'm having a problem with IDE drivers but it seems to be partly due to the
way
I need to use them.

I need to boot my system without an IDE drive attached.  I plan on testing
an IDE drive
under program control.  An operator will attach a drive to the system and
through a UI, start
the proper test.  We have power control working and this test method works
for SCSI and Fibre
Channel devices.  Access to IDE drives work correctly provided the drive is
attached and powered
up when the linux kernel boots.

When loading the IDE driver manually from modprobe or insmod
it does not scan for connect drives.
The IDE driver load does scan the PCI and identifies the card
and seems setup for supporting the proper devices but no IDE scans.

The hdparm tool fails as it cannot stat any of the devices that show
registered in
dmesg output when the driver is loaded.

Two other problems that also need to be solved.  Once I get a IDE drive
connected
and registered; at the end of the test I need to removed it and connect
another device.
When I do manage to get the first drive running, changing to the next drive
always crashes
the system.

The hdparm tool seems to be the way to do this but when no IDE drives
register then
the /dev/hdx device is unavailable.

Thanks for anyone's time that is able to help me on this.

an apxs file from a newer version of Apache.

Sometimes, I am *so* tempted to just wipe the machine and rebuild it from
scratch :P

are you building php from source? or are you using a package?

apxs for building from source should configure things correctly...from what
I remember...
I've recieved errors using packages before...

IDE's not supposed to be hot pluggable.

I refer you to this expert writing in to say Linux should block
hotpluggable IDE

http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0203.3/0633.html

On the other hand, you seem to work for a hard drive manufacturer, and
it's possible you have a system which can genuinely power down the
drive, and I can't find a decision on which way to go on the lkml.

We have a test system currently that Drive swaping (running MSDOS).  I
don't really know
if what I'm doing/wanting to do is really Hotplugging.

But swapping in this order.
Tri-state the bus.
Driver rescan to unregister w/tri-stated bus
power down drive.
replace drive
power up new drive
Activate the bus
Driver rescan to register new device.

The IDE controllers that we use have built-in bus tri-stating hardware.

I'm not expecting this to be in general availability but from a drive
testing and manufacturing
perspective would you want to have to reboot your pc everytime you swap out
a drive for testing
if the test is only 30 seconds and the pc boot time is about 2 minutes?

I seem to recall that if you can boot up with no IDE drivers, you can
load/unload IDE modules (ide.o) and this causes bus rescan, so new disks
will be detected. To load without ide modules, you probably need to pass
ide=noprobe to the kernel (and, of course, you need to boot from something
other than IDE disk :)

Subject: [PLUG] Comanche on RedHat 9 installation question....
Message-ID: <a05200f03bb59cd819d5d@[192.168.123.106]>

I feel like the mouse in a psychologist's maze:
	I can smell the cheese, but I haven't quite reached it.

Request:
	I'm looking for help getting  a separate (webpage) server
	(Comanche, runs in Squeak)
	up in addition to Apache on Linux (Redhat 9)

	I think this is likely entirely outside of Squeak, but instead suffering
	from an over-protective firewall or some such...
	I have tested using complete-slut iptables and
	turning off ip6tables from redhat-config-services

	Thus I beg for help from Linux experts.

Background:

I set up an old PC with RedHat 9
but I am having more than a bit of trouble getting a simple? thing  to work.

If I turn ON httpd, I can see www.smoo.com through Apache,
and I can see http://192.168.123.120:8080 from the Comanche server running in Squeak.
but still no http://www.smoo.com:8080, not even from within the local network.


If I run ComSwiki on port 8080 I can address it
from another machine on the local network as http://192.168.123.120:8080/refs/11 (for example)
but I cannot see it as http://www.smoo.com:8080

Within Squeak, I can see that the front part of the address has already been processed, so
(quite properly) all that gets sent in is /refs/11 (in the above example), and that part works great.
When the symbolic name is used, Squeak never sees anything.

I also came up short on trying to do the trick from? http://minnow.cc.gatech.edu/swiki/91,
	but I could worry about that once I can see the very simple thing working.
This trick is setting up a VirtualHost  in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf


As a loooong-time Smalltalker, I am not uncomfortable with letting
Comanche do all the serving and not bother with Apache at all.

It would seem that the simplest thing would be to run Comanche on port 80,
(having turned off httpd in redhat-config-services)
and I have tried...
I cannot even see http://localhost:80 when I do that...
and Squeak sees no requests at all.
Clearly NOT desirable.

My frontier of exploration is in  /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
It looks like it has plenty of power to do the address substitution both ways.
Now if I could get it going at all.

If you happen to have some insight and/or I get this to work,
I'll be sure to put a note in the swiki 8-)
No, really, on? http://minnow.cc.gatech.edu/swiki at Georgia Tech where swiki
implementors trade info.

Thanks for your thoughts.

Subject: [PLUG] Where is glib version record kept?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0308081607020.24226@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Trying to configure a source tarball I get this:

checking for GLIB - version >= 2.0.0...
*** 'pkg-config --modversion glib-2.0' returned 2.2.1, but GLIB (2.0.6)
*** was found! If pkg-config was correct, then it is best
*** to remove the old version of GLib. You may also be able to fix the error
*** by modifying your LD_LIBRARY_PATH enviroment variable, or by editing
*** /etc/ld.so.conf. Make sure you have run ldconfig if that is
*** required on your system.
*** If pkg-config was wrong, set the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH
*** to point to the correct configuration files

  I've run into this before, where the new version doesn't update all
records and so the older version still shows up. Someone here pointed out
where on my system I'd find the old version listed, but I did not save that
message even though I thought that I did.

  Where do I find the reference to glib-2.0.6 so I can remove it? And -- I
promise! -- this time I'll save the information.

TIA,

Looks like you need to allow access to port 8080 on your public
interface.  I've never heard of complete-slut, so have no advice on how
to change it, but the commands would look something like:

EXTINT="ethx"
PUBLICPORTS="1024:65535"
/sbin/iptables -A OUTPUT -o $EXTINT -p TCP --sport 8080 \
        --dport $PUBLICPORTS -j ACCEPT
/sbin/iptables -A INPUT  -i $EXTINT -p TCP --sport $PUBLICPORTS \
        --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT

Where the x in ethx would be the number of the public interface.


Good Luck,

Ok, the sollution below worked on my laptop, and placing a hub between
my linux router and the cisco 678 worked great for a few days. Last
night sometime everything started taking 2 seconds to work again
(still just latency). All the hardware concerned is on a UPS,
including the hubs and cisco. As far as I can tell, the only thing I
have changed in the system was plugging a telepohne into my answering
machine (there is a filter between the machine and the wall, trying
without the phone changes nothing).

This time mii-tool and hubs make no difference (where they fixed the
problem before).  And yes, the conncetion works great under windows.

What should I do about this? Could my 678 be faulty, and windows is
just better at dealing with it? I find it hard to believe this is still
an auto-negotion problem.


Thanks,
Rogan

Could you do a drawing of you setup? I thought it was

[Internet]---[cisco678]----laptop

and you where experiencing the slow down connected directly to the cisco

The way this reads to me is a set up like

[Internet]----[cisco678]-- [hub]---[linuxrouter]---laptop 

or

[Internet]---[cisco678]---[hub]-----[linuxrouter]
					     |
					     |-------[laptop]


Thank you

I figure all of you folks who would be annoyed by this message already
don't like me, so I'm going to ask this publicly.

Can we please cut down on the top-posting and full-quoting?  It's harder
to read and makes for larger messages with lower useful content levels.

And what mail clients are you folks using that don't strip properly
delimitted signatures?

Here is one (1!) message to PLUG with only the USEFUL lines cut [no less
than four personal signatures (three greater than four lines apiece) and
FIVE copies of the PLUG footer]:

Just because the media handles discourtesy more gracefully than it did in
the past doesn't mean we can do away with courtesy.

Thanks for reading.

 It can safely be cleaned out every reboot. Other than that, leave it alone. 
Just firing up an Internet connection, for one example, creates a raft of 
/tmp files. Many programs need /tmp files, I leave them alone. I check it 
occasionally for leftover garbage, but most programs are good at cleaning up 
after themselves.

Please be aware that this is changing across different distributions.

RedHat now doesn't remove everything on reboot.  It does have some sort of 
cronjob that cleans some stuff up.  However after a reboot the files are 
still there.

I've surrendered on the battle against top-posting, and am reduced to begging 
for sensible snipping, and for gosh sake at least follow the established 
posting pattern. Messages that are mixed-up top and bottom posts, and sigs 
everywhere, are too much trouble to decode. I do not read them, and I think 
cuss words at the offenders. Sequence, my friends, follow the sequence. (No 
not the sequins, they will lead you astray)

That seems frightening.  Seems that this could develop some kind of
"expected behavior" and create a bunch of, say, Red Hat specific packages
written by developers that don't know any better.

Of course, I'd say the RIGHT thing to do is use tmpfs or somesuch
memory-based filesystem for /tmp.  That way you don't need cron jobs or
boot scripts and it's quick quick quick.

Here are some topologies I've tried, #1 is the ideal, that's what I
want, the #'s marked with *'s (3 and 5) are the only topologies that
work correctly.

 1) [Internet]----[cisco678]--[linuxrouter]--[switch]-+-laptop
                                                      ...
                                                      +-workstation
                                                              
 2) [Internet]----[cisco678]--[hub]--[linuxrouter]---[switch]....

*3) [Internet]----[cisco678]--[laptop(windows)]

 4) [Internet]----[cisco678]--[laptop(linux)]

*5) [Internet]----[cisco678]-[hub]--[laptop(windows)] 

 6) [Internet]----[cisco678]-[hub]--[laptop(linux)]


"Laptop" is synonomous for workstation. Both machines dual-boot and
both behave the same in the above networks. 

It's disturbing how reliable this delay is, I've been pasting my
emails into mutt so I can compose them locally. Everytime, the entire
buffer is pasted exactly 2 seconds after I issue the command.

Thanks,
Rogan

  Just wait until you need to communicate with the digitally challenged who
use aol, hotmail and their cousins. No quoted text, or the text is there but
not distinguished from the response. And, they just will _not_ turn off html
formatting. Sigh.

  The irony, of course, is that no one with deep roots in the UNIX world has
found anything credible in SCO's claims. I've not read a single piece that
had anything like, "well, ... maybe". Every single guru has dismembered
SCO's claims with credible evidence.

  SCO should fail in the most painful way.

so true.  i am on the Plan9 list and the orig writers of unix just laugh

The biggest problem I see, is that the existence of this "tool" lends
some credence to SCO claims. 

To remove something requires that it exist.

You know that SCO's claims are groundless, I know that SCO's claims are
groundless, and IBM knows that SCO's claims are groundless. 

The problem is that not every CIO out there knows that SCO's claims are
groundless, and some of them are very risk adverse.

The presence of this tool helps remove any potential chill for Linux in
their minds because the legal department may now say, "look, SCO's
probably on shaky ground here but this tool is cheap relative to the
cost of potential litigation and we can continue to enjoy the benefits
of Linux."

Also, if kernel.org obtains this tool (if they just don't remove the
"offending" code carte blanc) then Linux 2.4.23 will have absolutely
zero SCO code in it whatsoever.

> To remove something requires that it exist. 

Right. It exists in the form of GPL'd code by Caldera who is now SCO.
The problem is that once you GPL the code, you can't later go back and
issue a new license just because it's not convenient for you.

>From what I'm reading, if IBM prevails in it's patent infringement
counter suit, and/or if Red Hat is successful in their preliminary
injunction of SCO (a similar injunction of which was successful in
Germany), SCO is likely to be a mere shadow of their business today.

That's if they don't bleed to death by litigation with IBM and if the
SEC doesn't launch a probe for artificially propping their stock price
through inflammatory press releases shortly before insider trading.

Actually, all that Aduva is announcing is that if and when a piece of 
code is judged infringing, shortly thereafter they will release a tool 
that will find any instances of that code and replace it...

It's not likely though that they will ever have to do that...

The entire history of Unix while it was at Bell Labs / AT&T was that 
they only did the "interesting" or "really needed" parts.  If they 
needed something; a device driver; some kernel functionality; some user 
command functionality, etc. that existed in the general Unix community, 
they just used that code.  The people in the general Unix community 
didn't cede all rights to Bell / AT&T then; they just let them use a 
copy.  In particular, a lot of code was adopted from UC Berkeley.  This 
is the fundamental reason why the USL effectively lost their law suit 
against UC Berkeley.

The general sharing of code within a community without explicit 
licensing, copyright, etc. worries was very prevalent in the years I was 
more explictly involved with actual Unix development and support (at 
UCLA, SDC and Tektronix).

What? The InformationWeek article link I posted (
http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=13000458 ) said this:

  "Linux developer Aduva released a tool at LinuxWorld this week that
will let companies looking over their shoulder for lawyers replace
offending Linux code with code that doesn't infringe on what SCO Group
alleges is a violation of its intellectual-property rights."

And this...

"OnStage 2.0 is available immediately; it runs on Red Hat and SuSE
implementations of Linux."

This indicates to me like the tool exists today. Please advise.

 Well if Aduva signed the NDA or had a software engineer sign the
NDA to examine the alleged infringing code then they could create software
to remove the alleged lines of code in Linux that infringe SCO claimed
IP.
 Otherwise they are selling software that is for the paranoid CTO/CEO/CIO
etc.

Why not simply take the code that was developed by the
Linux community, strip away any pieces that were either
contributed by IBM or have questionable origins, and
rename it Torvix?

Wouldn't this go a long way to putting an end to the
SCO (and indirectly, IBM) treat?

  I bought a second, 5-port LinkSys 100 mbps switch to connect to the
original one. Nothing in the little instruction booklet about hooking
multiple units together except that ports 4 and 5 (the uplink port) are
wired together internally so that the functional result is three units on
each switch. Nothing about cabling.

  Since noting was said about the linking cable, I presume it's standard and
not a cross-over cable. But, I need only a few inches length. Should I buy a
scrap of cat 5 cable and make it myself? I do have the tool and RJ-45 ends,
but haven't built network cables since I did that for a LanTastic network
about 13 years ago.

You should be able to connect the "uplink" ports together with a
straigh-through cable.

Hrm, it will probably be difficult for you to find an amount shorter than
20', and in my experience retailers want exorbitant prices for raw cable. 
I think you would be better off trying to find a 3' or 7' cable.

Now that you brought it up, there is a minimum cat5 cable length and 2'
seems to ring a bell.  There needs to be a least a certain number of
twists in a length of cable to overcome cross talk.  While a 2" home-made
cable would probably work, you can probably dress or hide a 2' cable and
be sure it would work.  Hard as it is to believe, cables do go "bad".  A
home-made cable may work today, and in two start trickling errors.  Am not
trying to discourage you from making your own cables- I actually kind of
enjoy it (in one class we had a $5000 tester, and it would rank the
quality of your cable).

HTH

Uh, scratch that.  Upon re-reading my own gibberish, I think you have to
connect the uplink port on one device to a "normal" host port on the
other.  Some devices are kind of smart and auto-sense whether a crossover
is needed.  But I bet that for the devices you mentioned, you'll want to
use "uplink" on one to a regular port on the next.  Sorry for that.

Yeah, while building cables can be fun, the RJ type connectors require 
special tools and are just not worth the cost of the tool  unless you are 
doing dozens and dozens.  Radar Electric on SE Washington & 7th is pretty 
reasonable.  Last time I was there bought a bunch of 3' cat5 for $2.50/ea.

Tyler,

  I had -- still have, but commented out -- a _highly_ effective postfix
filter to reject html-formatted messages. The screams of pain were very
loud. I provided explicit instructions on how to turn off the formatting,
but too many just didn't _want_ to. Superficiality -- eye candy -- beats
substance once again. So I gave up. That's the price of dealing with a wide
spectrum audience.

Subject: [PLUG] HB2892, SB589 New Open Source Legislation
Message-ID: <1060531226.4667.9.camel@sparticus>

Friends,

The following is an email from Oregon Rep. Barnhart regarding SB589.
Rep. Barnhart and his staff worked tirelessly throughout this session to
make this happen:


--------------------Begin Forwarded Message----------------------------

Ken,

Yes indeed, the bill is back. This time better than ever. It consists of
the amendments to HB 2892 we could never get adopted. As you recall, I
drafted them with the help of the Department of Adiministrative Services
to get their support for HB 2892. The bill is not a "gut and stuff"  but
an entirely new bill.

I got out a press release last week. I apologize if I didn't get it to
you. We have been very busy working on the budget.

The bill will continue to require that agencies "consider" open source
software and adds "open standards" to the definition of open systems
that DAS is already charged with obtaining for us.

The bill was introduced by the Senate Rules Committee. I provided
support, the draft, and urged Senator Kate Brown, the Democratic Leader
to go with it. But it would not have happened without the very good work
of many people who emailed the Senators to point out the value of the
bill. Finally, Cooper Stevenson has been working the bill tirelessly for
months and finally got Senator Atkinson (probably with the help of
unknown to me others) to support it. 

You get credit for the idea and the original bill and much work
thereafter. Many,  many open source supporters' emails and letters got
it on the radar in the Senate ("Phil, what is this open source stuff I
keep hearing about?? (puzzled look)",from several Senators over the last
three months). 

Finally, Cooper went into the offices of the Rules Committee members and
got the final "OKs".

I never ever want to be on the bad side of you guys. I am enjoying
moving around the opponents. If we play our cards right, this bill could
even be a part of the "end game" for the session.

My suggestion, email the Rules Committee members in the Senate and thank
them for introducing the bill. Urge them to get it to the floor for a
vote. Go to the public hearing if one is scheduled and help get it
passed there. No wild promises, there, just sober support for the future
of the state being in control of its software at an efficient cost. In
many areas the decision to require open standards will be even more
important than open source for keeping the states costs down and in
control of its own data.

Congrats again on the good work. Keep it up.

Phil

It looks like it.  There's been an ongoing effort in the Senate to 
find a dead bill that could be "gutted and stuffed" with the 
language of the amended HB 2892.  The original target was an 
agricultural bill with a number in the 500's, but no one could 
get enough votes in its committee to move it.

This appears to be a new bill that was introduced Monday while I 
was away at Linuxworld.  Its language is identical to what HB 
2892 would have looked like after amendments.  Too bad I didn't 
know about this until now; I told everyone at Linuxworld (and 
several asked!) that Oregon's open source bill is "probably 
dead."

This looks like very good news.  I'll reserve comment until I have 
a chance to talk to my contacts in Salem next week.

Friends,

I created a CD-ROM to help inform our Legislators about the benefits of
procuring Open Source software, you may view the online version here:

  http://www.mwvlug.org/open_source_cd/index.htm

Now that the bill is moving forward, and now that news of the new Open
Source Consideration Bill is publicly known, this link will likely
receive more traffic than my broadband link can handle.

If you or someone you know with good bandwidth is willing to mirror this
and other future links regarding SB 941, I would very much appreciate
it.

Meanwhile, I will have a full report covering these past few months for
you soon.

P.S. I would just like to say that it was very difficult not keeping the
community informed of my progress with the Legislature. Please
understand that if the Lobbyists had found out about movements regarding
SB941 while still at the nascent stage, they surely would have killed
it; it would have been a disservice to you to let that happen.


Very Truly Yours,

Well, IANAL, I haven't signed any NDA's with SCO, and I haven't looked at the
code, but it was my understanding that SCO was claiming that SCOUnix
code (not Caldera) made it into the kernel. 

That's part of the problem with this suit, we don't know what code they
are claiming is infringing, and they haven't specifically said where it
came from. 

If you are correct, then there is no basis for a suit. If it's not
Caldera code that they are claiming, but in fact, SCOUnix code, then
they may have a claim, and someone screwed up. In that case also, we
have to hope the judge see it that SCO did distribute this after the
fact, and is still distributing, per their FTP site. 

The message this will send is that any company that contributes to OSS
will need to be inspecting every OSS project for code that may have made
it into that project.

That's okay Cooper,
I've played the politics game before.
Better to let a few suffer than to not get them the help they wanted
in the end. Lobbyist are the nastiest SOB's in the nation(I know this
personally! :)  )

But just like having rattlesnakes in your farm, you need them to keep
down all the other vermin that otherwise would over run you.

All we need is to know who to contact and when and about which bill.
Oh, and  have a copy of the information in the bill, so we can read it
for substance.

Thanks to you and Ken for the tireless work on the behalf of the local
Open Source community. There are others out there as well, but they
are unknown to me. Thank you all.

Sincerely,
Harry Howard

Can anyone speak for ECS notebooks, especially for running Linux?  I
hadn't even heard of them, but this one looks like the best deal for a
high-end system:

http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=3425428973&category=177

But I'm skeptical, because ETC is selling 1.6GHz "Centrinos" for more,
which only appear superior by a half gig' of RAM and a better battery.

I've also heard good things about Thinkpads, but any I've found over
1GHz in speed have also been expensive.

I like the ecs K7S5A motherboard, very cheap board for a fast, at the time,
motherboard, so when ecs announced the under $1000 notebook, when low end
laptops where still in the $1500 range, I was very interested.I thought enu was
selling the barebone ecs laptop kit like ,
http://www.rjross.com/ecsg731.html but can't find it so must be wrong, I'm
pretty sure someone in town was selling them however. The ecs kits were not
battery powered as it was marketed as a desktop replacement not as a  laptop.
There was an external battery pack that could be bought, but I never looked
into it. If you are looking for a laptop, ie something with battery, then I
would ask about the battery so that you are not surprised. Could be this is a
new ecs product. 

Thank you

I have an account that's getting about 100 spams a day from a "free"
offer. (thanks, son)

I'm trying to get spamassassin to filter mail on my mail server. It's a
RH8, PII/300+ machine with 128 M RAM. Spamasassin is installed and
configured via /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf and
/usr/share/spamassassin/user_prefs.template, according to the man file.

I've made sure that the appropriate entry is in the
/etc/mail/sendmail.cf to get procmail to initiate spamassassin..

Is there more to do?

This seems like a nice box, minus the noise and heat. I didn't know ecs got
into the laptop market. They are using desktop parts, memory and cpu, instead
of low power laptop parts as per the desknote boxes. It does have an internal
battery too.

When I:
#/etc/rc.d/init.d/spamassassin restart
it shuts down and restarts just fine, but #ps -aux does not show it. I'm
assuming that's because it gets called by procmail, maybe I'm wrong.

There is a .spamassassin dir in the user's dirs, all direct the
re-writing of the header.

What SCO filed copyright to is one (1) 20-page (only) printout of its
revisions to Unix System V.  The Claim Limit is explicitly Revisions.

USL (i.e., Novell) still holds the base copyright to Unix System V.

Subject: [PLUG] Ghostscript problems
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0308101628110.11556@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Yesterday -- perhaps Friday -- I upgraded ghostscript-6.52 to
ghostscript-7.07. Now I can no longer run ps2pdf because libgimpprint.so.1
is gone and CUPS reports problems. I'm not sure what to check or where to go
to fix the problem.

  I grabbed the gs-7.07 tarball, ran ./configure then make. Then I used
checkinstall to build the rpm and it automatically installed the completed
package.

  Should I grab the 6.52 package, uninstall 7.07, install 6.52, then freshen
with the 7.07 package?

  This is the first time I've had any problems with these tools.

Many thanks,

Rich

If you are going from like port, to like port, yes, it should be a
cross-over. If you are going from dis-similar ports, then it should be a
straight through cable. 

Uplink hub port <----- straight through -----> standard hub port
Uplink hub port <--------- crossover --------> Uplink hub port
standard hub port <------- crossover --------> standard hub port
computer <--------- straight through --------> standard hub port
computer <---------------- crossover --------> computer

I suppose this too would work, but I've never heard of anyone doing it:

computer <---------------- crossover --------> Uplink hub port

Feeling rather foolish, I've sent the procmail filter to the correct
address to find spamd, and it works fine.

I'm trying to tune the thing to catch more spam, from the 10 I set it to
originally, but I'm not having luck. What do I need to restart to change
it? I've changed the default user setting, the specific settings... It
still comes out as needing a 10 to rewrite headers.

Also, what do you use as a default action for failed messages in
procmail?

Subject: [PLUG] Wget and Cookies
Message-ID: <1060581725.6170.9.camel@zadie>

Hi,

As I am currently poor, and lazy, I wish to purchase things which are on
sale, but do not particularly want to go through each grocery store's
circular myself. I'd much rather get an itemized list in my email and be
able to run filters on it and stuff. Of course, if they offered such a
service, it'd be html emails with huge images of what they're selling,
but even so, I'd be willing to parse that. I haven't been able to find
that. So I figured I'd just write a combo bash and python script to wget
their website, and then parse it for their offers.

This should be easily possible. Looking in galeon at their website, all
the information I want is available in some scripts they write to create
mouseovers.

But when I use wget to get the page, I get, instead of the page that I
want, a page called needsCookies.jsp, which tells me that their page
requires cookies.

I checked wget's man page, and it confirmed what I believed (wget
defaults to accepting cookies), but I manually turned them on anyway,
and eventually added my galeon cookies file as wget's loaded cookies.

Still no page.

I'm baffled. Wget should be sending the cookies galeon has collected
which are perfectly valid, and the jsp should be seeing that wget is
accepting cookies, but it's not. 

And the bizarre thing is, when I set galeon to warn about cookies, and
then reject them all, I can get through to the page.

The supermarkets I'm looking at are Safeway and Fred Meyer, which put
their circulars on adinsertsonline.com and inserts2online.com
respectively.

Any thoughts, please. =)

Jeff

  It looks like marketing bullshit.  Aduva is releasing a new version of
their software development tools.  They've jumped on SCO's coat tails to
create a some buzz.  

  Should the SCO lawsuit ever prove copywrite infringement.  (A big *IF* on
that claim.)  The offending files will be re-written in a clean room and
distributed as "patch" files.  There is no reason to buy these guys software
tools.

Ack, IMHO, Safeway and Freddy's are two of the most expensive places to
buy groceries. WinCo seems to be consistently the least expensive.

I usually make a run through Grocery Outlet (Rainbow Foods) as well (12
pack of Shasta for $1.79!).

Sorry, I haven't any clue as to why their website wouldn't accept the
cookies. Have you tried turning on debugging in wget?

I would use tcpdump or ethereal to capture the packets from a Galeon
session and identify any unusual behavior.  Then do the same packet
capture for your wget session and compare the two.  There may be a header
that the site expects to see or something specific to wget that isn't
working like a normal browser.  (Sites expecting a User-Agent of "Mozilla"
and sites using a blanket robots.txt exclusion are two common problems
I've seen.)

A quick way to test home brew cables for connectivity (if not quality)
is to plug an uplink into a standard port (on the same hub, or not)
and check lights. Use two standards if you are making crossover cable,
of course.

You may need to start spamd with the "--user-config" option.  Refer to the
spamd man page which says:

-----
-x, --nouser-config, --user-config
    Turn off(on) per-user config files.  All users will just get the
    default configuration.  The default behaviour is for per-user con-
    figuration to be off.
-----

Changing the default has some security implications-- look at:

http://eu.spamassassin.org/dist/spamd/README.spamd

Unless your server is getting pounded into the ground by the normal
invocation of spamassassin (not spamc/spamd), I'd suggest keeping it
simple and just calling spamassassin directly.

> Also, what do you use as a default action for failed messages in
> procmail?

Here's a sample .procmailrc for calling spamassassin directly:

-----
LOGFILE=/home/myuser/procmail.log
VERBOSE=yes
:0fw: spamassassin
| /home/myuser/bin/spamassassin.sh 2>/home/myuser/procmail-SA-errors.log
:0e
{
        EXITCODE=$?
}

:0:
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
/home/myuser/mail/sa-caught
-----

Here is the simple shell wrapper I use (in case I want to change options,
redirections, add PERL5LIB, etc. without messing with .procmailrc)

-----
#!/bin/bash
nice /usr/bin/spamassassin
-----

Sample spamassassin config:

-----
# How many hits before a mail is considered spam.
required_hits   4
score RAZOR_CHECK 5.00
score BIG_FONT 3.00
score HTML_WITH_BGCOLOR 2.00
score WEB_BUGS 3.00
score RCVD_IN_OSIRUSOFT_COM 3.00

Oh, and if you ever want to try using a mailing list or sign up for a

I missed the original post, but I had the same problem at work where my
boss' laptop where WinXP Home Edition wouldn't see the Samba shares on
our Redhat 7.2 server.  I gave up on it but noticed a few weeks ago that
it was mysteriously working.  I can only guess that some Samba upgrade
along the way fixed the problem.

Our current version of Samba is 2.2.7.

Move your DSL modem (and the hub) away from your monitor (or other
sources of EMI).  Also be sure to power cycle it (unplug it from the
wall) for a few seconds after that.

Subject: [PLUG] Getting ps2pdf working again
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0308111553360.26123@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I guess that posting on a Sunday means that no one sees the message, so
I'll try again.

  I upgraded ghostscript from -6.52 to 7.07 (using the GNU versions). When I
did so, ps2pdf stopped working because it could not find libgimpprint.so.1.
Searching around google, I found that libgimpprint is part of the gimp-print
package (reasonable enough, eh?). Haven't needed it before but apparently do
need it now.

  So, I download the gimp-print tarball and try to configure it. That fails
because:

configure: error: Cannot find ijs-config; please ensure Ghostscript 6.53 or
above is installed

  Well, 'rpm -q ghostscript' returns 7.07. So I look for ijs-config and see:

[root at salmo /usr/local/gimp-print-4.3.19]# locate ijs-config
/opt/ghostscript-7.07/ijs/ijs-config.in

So this should all have been built when I built ghostscript.

  I'm stuck. I really need a working ps2pdf (and the other translators), but
I seem to have hit a dead end. I'd greatly appreciate some help on how to
get on the right track and finish the gimp-print installation so I can get
back to work.

Many thanks,

Rich

Rich,

In Red Hat 8.0 and 9, which ship with ghostscript 7.05, ijs-config is
installed via the ghostscript-devel package. I don't know where you
got your updated ghostscript package, but my hunch is that you'll need
to go back there and grab the related development rpm.

Paul,

  From the ghostscript Web site. I'll go look for the devel package there.
Didn't see it.

Well all my sources tell me WinXP Home was never designed to do _real_
networking and some of the necessary components _are not there_.  

Speaking from an ISP support perspective XP Home tends to blow chunks half
the time when doing dial up networking - which it is suppose to support.

I suspect an upgrade while you were gone.  Bosses are like that you know.  
Though having something work after they upgrade is different.  :-)

Paul,

  At www.ghostscript.org there is no separate ghostscript-devel tarball! I
seen on rpmfind.net that it's part of RH 8.0. Too many connections now so
I'll keep trying to grab the src.rpm.

  But, I'm very confused. What do folks _not_ running Red Hat do to get
working copies of ps2pdf and associated tools if they upgrade their base
ghostscript via the source tarball?

Thanks,

Rich

Wait, I'm confused. You installed from a source tarball, but you
queried rpm? Did you build and install from source or did you install
an rpm?

The whole *-devel thing is pure RedHat.  This lets them make the "normal"
binary RPMs smaller by not including libraries and headers that many
people don't use.

Upgrading a base product from tar can often cause problems for any
package-based system.  When doing this I try to re-package things so that
I can remove the software easily if necessar, though this is often much
harder than installing from the tar source.

Things I would try, in no particular order:
  A) Recreate things from RPM
    + remove the gs that was built from tar
    + install ghostscript 7.05 RPM (or rebuild SRPM)
    + install gimp-print 4.2.4 RPM (or rebuild SRPM)

  B) Fix ijs-config
    + note the ".in" on the end of the ijs-config that was found?
    + That means it's probably an automake/autoconf template
    + I bet it was built by your RPM packaging process, but left off
      the install list.  This means the .spec file you used was broken
    + Or it may be hiding in another -devel package
    + I can't tell you which since I don't have it on my system

  C) Try running gs manually
    + This command makes a PDF from a PostScript file (all one line):

$ gs -q -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dSAFER \
        -sOutputFile=<file>.pdf <file.ps>

    + This will probably give you the same error, but it's worth a shot

Rich,

In my experience, which is admittedly somewhat dated, you have to specify the 
drivers and tools that you want to build in various configuration files 
before building ghostscript.  Everything that you're looking for should 
reside within the GNU source.  When I last read through it, the ghostscript 
documentation was rather lengthy and not always entirely clear.  But that is 
where the solution lies.  Mixing a development package from one version of 
ghostscript with a different version that was locally compiled does not sound 
like a good idea, even if the two versions are 7.05 and 7.07.

The Linux distributors usually build ghostscript with the drivers and tools 
that they believe will satisfy the needs of most people.  They don't build 
packages with all of the drivers or tools, however, which is why I used to 
have to compile ghostscript myself.  And, they don't usually use default 
builds.  They also somewhat unnaturally divide the binaries that result into 
multiple packages, such as ghostscript and ghostscript-devel, and often build 
packages so that they install into different locations than those specified 
by default in the source code.  These are reasons for caution when 
considering mixing packages from different lineages.

Good luck,

Mark

  Yes. Both. I built from the tarball but used checkinstall to create a Red
Hat rpm so it would be registered in the rpm data base.

Mark,

  This is a very good lesson. Every time prior to this I've used the Red Hat
rpm to upgrade. I'm now trying to get pdf2ps working on a password-protected
file and was given the suggestion to upgrade ghostscript. Not knowing any
better I just ran configure, make, checkinstall.

  Now I'll go back and read everything in the doc/ subdirectory and learn
what to feed into configure, then rebuild from scratch.

  I wasn't trying to mix versions, just not paying close enough attention.

Thanks very much for the pointer!

You may want to -e (erase) the old ghostscript rpm package for sanity-sake. 
  So at least any further troubles are coming from the newer tarball only.

  Thanks, Kyle. That's a given. After I rebuild it properly I'll have rpms
that provide all that I need so I will remove the existing one first.

Try these directions.  The procedure below makes the ttfonts available to
all users, not just /home/username/.fonts.  "ttf_font_locale" is of course
wherever you have saved your ttfonts.  It works for sure with RH9, am not
positive about RH8.

1) Become root

2) follow directions:

host# mkdir /usr/share/fonts/ttf
host# cd /usr/share/fonts/ttf
host# cp <ttf_font_locale>/*.ttf ./
host# mkfontdir
host# ttmkfdir -o fonts.scale
host# cd ..
host# fc-cache .

3) restart X-server

4) all done.

They're there, they're just crippled.  Home Edition (HE) will only see
resources on another copy of HE  That was to prevent companies from
using the less expensive HE in place of Pro in the workplace.

Only half?  Did a service pack come out that prevents it from blowing
the other half?

;)  True, but in this case the only upgrades he's done are the little MS
updates XP pulls down every so often to plug the gaping security holes
in their product.  I really do believe a Samba update was the fix.

Alex,

  Could you comment out the line in /etc/fstab, then source that file? I've
had a similar situation in the past but I resolved it by rebooting the
remote machine.

As far as I recall, it's not possible to unmount the filesystem gracefully.  
But there is a force option (-f) to the umount command that seems to be 
specifically intended for this purpose.  See the man page for umount for 
about as much information as I've given you here.  If you use this option, 
you will likely run the risk of file corruption or lost data. 

Whether or not processes that were accessing the mount will hang indefinitely 
depends on the options used when mounting the filesystem in the first place.  
See "Setting up an NFS Client" from the NFS HOWTO at

http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/NFS-HOWTO/client.html#MOUNTOPTIONS

for information on mount options.  As far as I could tell during a cursory 
look, the HOWTO does not specifically address your original question.

Good luck,

Mark

Sorry about (all of) my previous top-posts, Jeme.

By the way, sourcing /etc/fstab will only lead to coughing and sputtering.  
That file doesn't contain the commands for mounting your filesystems, only 
the arguments to the mount commands.  And, even if it did, trying to remount 
all of the other filesystems over themselves wouldn't affect the offending 
filesystem in any way, except if you accidentally obliterated its mount point 
in the process.  In any case, I'm not trying to flame you, Rich, but it's not 
a good idea.

Hey Alex,
If you can use the umount -f option to force the operation I would
suggest rewriting the fstab entry for this mount to include the soft and
timeo=  nfs options (see man mount). This way if the nfs server ever
does this again it will allow the workstation to gracefully recover from
the event.

Looks like I toast, at least for the rest of the day.
I can't use umount -f /nfs_mount_point 'cause ever
remote possibility to corrupt or loose the data is not 
an option in my case.

I would highly suggest that you investigate the soft and timeo mount
options very, very carefully before implementing either of them. It's
been repeatedly stated on the NFS mailing list that you leave yourself
open to silent data corruption when using soft mounts. Here's a
representative opinion:

  Having NFS timeout underneath you is exactly the same as having a
  hard drive fail underneath you. Most if not all applications are
  utterly unprepared to deal with the resulting I/O errors, thus
  guaranteeing data corruption.

  The 'soft' mounting is only acceptable for read-only mounts, and

This won't help you now, but if you run in to this problem a lot
because of an unreliable network, unreliable server, or whatever,
you might want to mount your NFS shares with the "soft" option.
Shares mounted in this way are easier to deal with when the server
is unavailable. Any attempt to access the NFS file system will
time out instead of hang.

There are supposedly some down sides with the "soft" option. The man
page is vague about this, but I suspect it has to do with undesirable 
timeouts resulting from a merely busy network or server as opposed to 
something actually being down.

Based on the info in the HOWTO, I strongly agree with Paul.  The HOWTO 
recommends using the "hard" and "intr" options rather than "soft" since 
"soft" is likely to lead to corruption.

I just gave myself an idea. It's a long shot, but try re-mounting the
NFS file system using the "remount" option thusly:

   mount -oremount,soft /mnt/nfs-share-in-ca

The "remount" option doesn't to a full unmount and mount, so it just might 
apply the "soft" option to the mount point without getting hung up trying 
to communicate with the server. If it works, then you might be able to 
unmount the share outright. Or even if not, it should cause less trouble
until the server comes back.

The best you can do is unmount with both -f and -l options. If that does
not unmount it, you're stuck.

Not to be to defensive of the technology too much here, and no
disrespect to Mark and Paul intended, but I've personally used soft nfs
mounts for a number of years in Solaris and Linux environments and have
had no problems at all. Of course, in all cases we planned network and
server capacity to realistically accommodate the active client load. It
seems to me that this argument against soft mounts is hinges on factors
external to nfs being inadequate for normal operation - which, in
itself, is a major cause of data corruption.

Using a hard mount with intr is a sound answer to this question unless
the server is out of commission for longer than the user will tolerate.
In that event you are left with the same mess when the user hits the
power switch.

I was going to suggest turning off all nfs related processes and kill 
those that won't terminate properly.  I haven't done this before, so I 
don't know all the ramifications.  In addition, if you don't have admin 
privileges for the host it probably is a moot point.

This is the reason that I've been shying away from Linux for file
serving. If an NFS server (linux) goes down, then you end up with stale
mounts. 

The only way to get rid of them is to make sure that nothing else is
accessing those mounted directories, and then you should be able to
umount them.

To find out if anything is open in those directories, use 'psof'.

If nothing is using them, and they still won't unmount, then rebooting
is the only option that I know of.

What's a better solution?

Because I agree, NFS can really suck when servers aren't reliable, but
samba has its own problems, and I'm not sure what other methods there
are that can reliably share directories/trees.

I've been using Solaris where I can. I have lots of automounted file
systems, and sometimes, the file server just has to bounce... 

With Linux, I was guaranteed to be chasing stale NFS mounts for the rest
of the day. I switched to Solaris, and things come back, and the mounts
start working again. The process using them may block while the server
is actually rebooting, but as soon as the server comes back, it
continues as if nothing happened. 

I've only used Solaris on Sparc hardware for this. I have not tested to
see if Solaris on x86 is as good during a bounce. Let me pencil that
test into my schedule. :)

That method often worked with 2.2 kernels because most of NFS was 
implemented in user space. In 2.4 most of NFS was moved to kernel space, 
so killing the NFS processes doesn't get you much any more.

ringing at the destination?  To achieve ringing you pick up one handset
and push a ring button on the simulator.  I guess on a real phoneline
that a central wire center waits for you to dial a number and decides
which line to set to ring.  A real phoneline has on-hook, off-hook, call
waiting, etc. states where you only ring if your off hook and being
called.  What is ring and how does it affect setting up modem to modem
communications?

I guess the Skutch AS-4A doesn't have any processing power to understand
numbers, my phone numbers could be 0 and 1 since it's an isolated phone
system.  Apparently it's designed for plugging into a voice card and a
handset, though I don't know much about that.  Can modems connect to
each other without dial-tone or ringing?  There doesn't seem to be a
simulated dial tone unless your supposed to hook up an audio feed
for that.

Plugging a handset into each jack on the simulator it seems that you can
just have two people pick up the handsets and talk to each other without
even bothering with the ring.  If you push numbers on one handset you
hear it on the other.  At least having wiring for a second phoneline
that is no longer used I can minimally set up a local communications
system using my simulator.  Being around $20 it's worth fooling with
unlike more expensive simulators that cost $300+.  For the cost of a
more accurate simulator it's cheaper to order a second line from the
phone company for a couple of months and learn how to build a dial-up
server using that.  Still, a simulator is more convenient in that
it gives you two lines isolated from your phone service to work
with allowing elimination of things like call waiting, etc., without
costly telco visits.

According to the NFS HOWTO, if the offending filesystem was mounted with the 
"hard" option, intentionally or otherwise, the mount should come back once 
the NFS server is back up under Linux too.  Also, according to the HOWTO, the 
danger of using soft mounts is that programs doing I/O on the filesystem are 
likely not to handle timeouts on the filesystem well -- hence corruption and 
lost files.  This is not the fault of NFS under Linux.  It's the fault of the 
myriad programs that weren't written to consider the case of having the 
filesystem ripped out from under them.  Again, I am merely paraphasing from 
the HOWTO (although I tested many of these things out quite a few years ago 
myself).

The "standards" that Microsoft controls 
should be open sourced!  Recommended move
is to require any Windows that hasn't been 
supported for two years to be open sourced.  
At least Europe is showing some backbone.

What gets me is that people know it's hard 
to do a Windows server especially with 
multiple languages, a fairly common need these
days, yet convincing the OS challenged manager 
to study and solve the problem with his/her own 
people and open source is surprisingly difficult.  
It's inconvenient after all and there's no one 
to blame even though that is clearly absurd when 
your talking about Microsoft.

It's reasonable that companies don't want to
add a division for their software needs 
desiring to come as close to using out of 
the crate systems as possible, but they've 
get to do better than Windows.

If Microsoft relied on a higher level API
for networking and redesigned Windows so
that anyone could write the networking layer,
implementing it in any protocol I might add,
it would help a great deal.

Microsoft wants to sell software that
has to be registered for it to work.  This 
doesn't mean you have to write the 
operating system.  Considering the Windows
track record, Microsoft should get out of the
OS business.

Some problems if Microsoft had to solve them...  
The point has already been made, forget it :-)

What it "should" do, and what it actually does are not the same. This
has been the case since kernel 2.2.?? through 2.4.20. My automounted
home directories go away and don't return when the server is Linux. If
the server is Solaris 8.0, it works as you describe. Nothing else
changed. The method of mounting (autofs/NFS), the type of mounting (hard),
or anything else. Literally, all I did was update the automount map in
NIS, and viola!, the server changed, and my stale mount point problem
when away. 

I even tested it during implimentation by rebooting the Solaris server while
files were open on the client. When the server shut down the network,
the client wedged, and as soon as the server came back up, the client
continued on without any issues. 

Conversely, when I had a Linux server, and I'd have to reboot it, the
client would wedge, and never come back, even though the server came
back up. If I could stop the process that was using the NFS mounted
directory, then I could try to manually umount the nfs mount, and
sometimes, that would clear it. Many times, I'd just have to reboot to
get everything back in sync.

I was told at one time that this was because Linux doesn't properly
re-create some ID or socket that's needed to reconnect existing mounts to mount
points, but I'm not a programmer, and I didn't dig into it.

If your network is as well-designed as you say, then mounting
hard instead of soft should not cause any problems, therefore you
should mount hard so that programs don't silently fail.

Programs silently fail because NFS changes some of the basic
assumptions about Unix file I/O, and most programmers don't spend
much time writing code that checks for conditions they think are
impossible.

Well, NFS has been around for a couple years now, maybe
everyone's learned new programming habits and fixed all the old
programs already.  Someone should check.

Really...considering the Windows track record, it's unsurprising that
everyone has tried to get into the OS business.

Windows is Microsoft's premiere cash crop. They make money off it like
Pfizer off Viagra.

Businesses are designed to make a profit. Windows makes a huge profit.
Ergo, Windows is good business.

Honestly, the problem is that no one's managed to get a law requiring
that all Operating Surfaces (i.e. Internet Explorer as well, as you can
run a program using it as the backbone) be fully open to outside
investigation.

Or better, that all code be fully open.

No, I do NOT mean open source. I just mean available to view.

You can take apart a tivo, or a roomba, or any mechanical object, why
not a piece of software?

I'm unfamiliar with MailMonitor, but at work we use a combination of
MIMEDefang/sophie/sophos on a Sun 220R running Solaris 9 that works
just fine. The average scan time in our setup appears to be about .25
seconds, with rare spikes during heavy traffic when a scan will take
longer than 1.5 seconds.

How do you make Windows open enough so that Microsoft can't tie
important standards to it's pathetic OS?  Can you convince enough
people to go with something else and stay financially afloat
providing that ( preferably under GPL )?  The problem with the 
idea of Microsoft opening its code to someone is that it
will open it to very few people and charge blood.  The European 
Union is at least showing some backbone threatening to not allow the
sale of Windows without fair access to it's underpinnings.  I don't
care much for the EU on most moral issues, but at least it appears
to be attempting to do the right thing with regard to Microsoft 
Windows.  I thought the creed of ethical business didn't contain
the premise that you do whatever makes the most money for you
regardless of any other factors.  It isn't businesses responsibility
always to forego certain profit earning avenues but society as
a whole I'd say is responsible for limiting certain practices
which has commonly been done through a governmental body.

As far as the DMCA comment, I worry that there are weak ideas of what
open is insofar as what is needed.  There can be plenty of business in
an open source environment.  Most people probably don't want to
be programmers and even programmers have to spend time to do 
something with open source that hasn't been done by someone 
else no matter how good they are.  I see nothing wrong with
using Linux as a proprietary software platform for proprietary
applications.  There are a lot of people who say I think Linux
can run better than Windows but can I get this or that application.
One answer is to get enough access to that application to port it.
Another answer is to copy it's functionality through writing new 
or creatively using existing open source software.  A third answer 
is to write a proprietary application that runs under Linux and
competes.  

For Weatherbug for example, how do you get the same 
weather data if you want to create a similar program to run under 
Linux?  Why couldn't you sell a Weathertux clone for Linux if you
knew how to access the same weather data?  Worst come to worse
you have to start a company that has it's own weather stations
near where Weatherbug's stations are and feed that to clients
using Weathertux.

If your goal is to release all software you produce under GPL but
you want to compete with Weatherbug and other hot titles how can
you modify the profit model reasonably, or will you sell plenty of
copies of your software even though the source code comes with it?
One game plan I've considered is to scramble the source for a limited
time so that you can compile the program which solves a lot of
compatibility issues, but your ability to read it before it say
goes under GPL is next to zero.  Brilliant people will descramble
it of course but you could license it so that the decryption key
will be released on a certain date and gurantee that it will go
under the GPL.  How long should it be under encryption?  Is there
a better way where it can be released unscrambled under GPL from
the get go?

Hmmm... Interesting example...

However how many people would be willing to pay for the Weathertux?

Also I don't know too many people willing to put the pocketbook where their
mouth is and shell out $$$ for Linux Applications. 

I have yet to buy a version of Linux... but I have 4... I've considered
buying Win4Lin... but I have Wine... 

I think that the $$$ to be had is taking open source applications software
and integrating them into a proprietary solution. 

BTW the weather stations data is Public Domain available from the
government.

A couple of years? Take a look at RFC 1904 dated March of 1989.

You mean kweather?  It's not like there aren't free, even
government-provided weather sites providing accurate information for
most of the globe.  Off the top of my head, Environment Canada's
Weather Office (http://www.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/) and NOAA
(http://www.weather.gov/) are two fine examples.

no I think DMCA is completely wrong and I think it harms the software

Well, I see that mostly as a result of the open source community
taking care of it's own.  About the only catagory of software I've
seen a slight lack on was games.  Winex works wonders there, I've paid
for my copy.  If you're going to try and market closed-source on an
open platform, I think your only real option is games.

Oh I absolutely think that. I've yet to hear a good argument against it.

I'm arguing for much much further opening: I think if you sell a
product, you should have access to its workings and specifications in
entirety. I should be able to see (NOT MODIFY/REDISTRIBUTE, just see)
Windows code. In the original form.

If somebody did modify/redistribute it, it'd be immediately obvious
because they'd have to give the code with it. And then it's just
copyright law.

The benefits to this scheme are thus: anyone could read any code and
therefore make interoperable code. I'd know what was in what DLLs in
Windows, so if I wanted to change stuff for my own personal use, I could
(why should this be illegal? If I dub a pop hit with my own voice it's
legal, provided I don't redistribute it. I can sing Cher to my heart's
content on my own tapes.)

And finally: programmers knowing their code would be seen by outside
companies would be shamed into writing cleaner code, and we'd be able to
find security bugs faster and suggest fixes.

It wouldn't be open source. It'd be accountable source. I think I have a
right to know what is in a program that someone sold/gave to me, before
I run it on my machine.

I have a right to nutritional information for food (and ingredients)
before I eat something, and programs harm machines as badly as Olestra.

But if the networks are reliable, what's your rationale for
mounting soft?  There's no performance gain for mounting soft
instead of hard.

The historical example is that close() over NFS can return errors
that used to be returned by write(), such as "sorry, disk is
full", and several programs (like emacs) had to be changed to
notice that.

That's not the same as the soft vs hard issue, but I've never
looked at the potential differences between writes on soft mounts
versus hard mounts, because nobody I know mounts writable
filesystems soft, and everyone recommends against it, so it never
seemed like something worth analyzing.  It's not just write() and
close().  I'd also want to look at how programs use unlink() and
rename() and so forth.  The "soft" decision happens at the SunRPC
level, it affects every NFS operation and adds the possibility
that any operation can fail with an EIO error.

Yes, I know, I'm a dinosaur.  Emacs is careful now to check the
return value from close() when writing files.  I don't have much
confidence that everyone else does too, and I don't have any
confidence that people have thought much about the problem of
doing reliable changes on soft-mounted filesystems.

Now that I think about it, soft-mounted filesystems may have
security implications too.  One thing that comes to mind is
xauth.  I just checked, xauth ignores the return value from
close() or unlink(), though this doesn't seem like it's
exploitable for anything other than boring DoS.

Type Sair in google search or go to Ed's site for more info.

What PCC courses did you take?  I took cis240L and cis279N.

What would be really cool is a class on how to get certified.

I have a book on this, but it's too old.  I've been offered a

job at Sprint in Virginia.  Quite a move, the pay and education

benefit are hard to ignore though.  I wish I could do something

here but there don't seem to be any opportunities for someone

interested in computer networking and Linux, especially if you

only have a two year degree and mostly only your own experience

trying to learn informally on limited resources.


At Redhat's site they have information about their certifications,

I think it's probably best to take Redhat's courses if you can 

afford it and if they don't teach you enough go ahead then and look

for other free/paid certification materials and programs.  Part of 

certification is educational, but part of it is getting something that 

says your qualified.  The best bet probably is to have a company pay for
it even if it means giving them some time after.  Your probably getting

certified to earn money anyways.

This morning due to catastrophic failure (dead disk) I took barley.patch.com off line.

Barley initially went online when patch.com was registered in March 1994.
While the machine went through some upgrades over the years it remained
in constant service, attaining a few uptimes in excess of a year.  Due to 
the stability of the machine I slowed down on the upgrades and just let it run.

barley was the primary mail server for patch.com, hosted web sites including
the one for the Oregon Brew Crew, supported a dozen email lists with mailman,
provided time services and until a couple of months ago was the primary DNS
machine for patch.com.  A multi service server until the end.

Barley's last uname produced:

  Linux barley.patch.com 2.2.12-20 #1 Mon Sep 27 10:25:54 EDT 1999 i686 unknown

Yep, a four year old kernel.

Transitional servers and those that are not in my control where
stability is a question. In these cases the data that is contained on
the servers is easily recreated or restored and expectation is low.

I'm sorry, I have a problem blaming nfs, or any other protocol, because
developers write applications that don't gracefully handle errors.

Implicating the filesystem protocol because an application is not
properly using that protocol? You have to admit, that's really
stretching things.

All in all, I agree with most of the arguments against using soft
mounts. I just can't agree that they should be avoided at all costs. I
still feel that the original post for this thread would be a good use
for soft mounts.

Can you please provide its model, capacity and the manufacturer if

It was one of 3 2GB IBM644 SCSI drives hanging from an Adapatec 1542.
I bought the drive used for $5 about the time the last kernel was 
compiled for the machine.  There are still sever or either of the same
drive in different systems around my house.

Call me silly, but having an internet connected machine be woefully out
of date w.r.t. security updates is not something to brag about (yes,
there've been security vulnerabilities fixed in the 2.2 kernels since
2.2.12 was released).

Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, they may not apply.

Hello Linux folkz,
We've got some hair pulling problem with
ATI Radeon 7000 64MB SDRAM AGP card in our Linux engineering
workstation.
This new card has replaced failed ATI Rage 3D Pro 32MB AGP card.
Now, when we export display from the remote UNIX server 
and try to run circuit layout applications, not all circuit lines
and lay out structures are visible on the screen. 
Some of them are visible but some look like blank rectangular spots.
We verified the fact that other Linux workstations, using older
ATI Rage 3D Pro AGP cards, don't have this problem.
To me it looks like refreshing rate of this new card is too high to
retain all the layout details on the screen, but I'm not sure.
Could somebody please give me a hand or advise what should be checked
or corrected in this situation.

Many thanks in advance.

Alex

The programmers were properly using the "unix filesystem
protocol" (open, read, write, etc).  The issue is that adding
"nfs behavior" to the "unix filesystem protocol" changes the
protocol in ways that programmers may not have originally
considered.  nfs implementations go to a _lot_ of trouble to try
to conform to the unix protocol, except for some unavoidable
problems like close(), but these guarantees apply to hard mounts,
not soft mounts.

Look, programming is sometimes like mathematics, and statements
like "this program works correctly" or "this program is secure"
are similar to mathematical proofs.  The proofs become invalid if
you change any of the axioms.  Using soft mounts instead of hard
mounts is like saying "ok, I'm changing '+' so that 2 + 2 = 0
when everyone in the room shouts 'fire!, but that's so rare that
everything should still work."  Logic systems just fall apart
when you make changes like that.  Every previously proven
statement becomes questionable.  You have to do new proofs, and I
don't know that anyone's done that for soft nfs mounts.  Someone
should go look.

Try doing a screen grab and viewing the captured image in a dumb bitmap
viewer. This will tell you whether the data going to the monitor is good
or not. You may need to load a new driver.

I understand and what you are saying and it makes perfect sense.
However, none of this changes the fact that soft mounts are part of NFS.
Ignoring the additional code in an application that addresses
filesystems, including NFS, is not the fault of NFS. If you are going to
design and interface to RPC for an application you would not ignore the
portmapper service and expect the application to function properly.

None of this is really relevant to the question of when to and when not
to use soft mounts though. It looks like we have digressed again.
Excellent argument though :)

At least one vulnerability allowed privilege escalation from a local
shell to root <http://icat.nist.gov/icat.cfm?cvename=CAN-2003-0127>.
Combine this vulnerability with a vulnerability in any of the network
services (for example, the apache/openssl vulnerability exploited by
the slapper worm), and you've got another DDoS zombie or worse. About
the only way they wouldn't have applied is if the machine had no users
and no visible network services (i.e. was a NAT firewall).

Just because a machine might not have local users does not mean local
root escalation vulnerabilities should be ignored.

It's hard enough to get users/admins to apply security
patches -- Eric Rescorla's study of the openssl vulnerability
<http://www.rtfm.com/upgrade.pdf> showed that 30 days *after* the slapper
worm was announced, roughly 35% of hosts he monitored still had not
patched openssl.  Do we really need to encourage people to brag about
not applying security updates in the name of a big uptime?

Point taken.  When the box was directly connected to the internet it 
would get hacked into about every nine months starting in 1998.  
I learned a lot. :)  Especially about how to clean up after an attacker
without taking the box offline. 

After I put it behind a firewall it was never compromised.

I agree, to a point. Each vulnerability needs to be evaluated and the

However, to apply updates "because they exist" makes us no better than
MS drones that update Windows because MS issued a patch. 

My point is that neither of us know if the machine in question had ssl
installed, or in fact, if it had any vulnerabilities that mattered in
the grand scheme. It may not have had any user accounts. The only person
that knows (most likely) is the system admin.

This is a long-shot, but I just learned about 'backing store' today.  From 
this description, http://www.baudline.com/manual/options.html#backingstore
it affects covered windows which are then uncovered.  But the mention of 
scrolling performance made me think it could be worth a shot in your case.

  That's not as easy as it sounds.  Unless your company wrote every line of
code, it's not just a matter of pushing a tarball out to the FTP site.

  As a simple example...  Lets look at IE 5.5.  MS didn't write every line
of IE.  They bought major components from other companies.  All that code
has a non-MS copywrite and is most likely covered under NDA.  This is a
pretty common situation.  Why reinvent the wheel.  It's often cheaper and
faster to buy code than write code.  

Here's IE 5.5's "About" statement.    

Based on NCSA Mosaic. NCSA Mosaic(TM); was developed at the National Center
for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign.

international treaties. Unauthorized reproduction or distribution of this
program, or any portion of it, may result in severe civil and criminal
penalties, and will be prosecuted to the maximum extent possible under the
law.

  Open Sourcing IE alone would require auditing the code to identify were
each line came from *and* what legal agreements and copywrite was attached
to it.  It would be a massive project that would likely bring in no profit.
Then you would have to rewrite all the legally encumbered code before your
Open Source release.

  The Netscape Open Source release is a good example of the complexity of
going from closed source to Open Source.  They had to rewrite tons of
legally encumbered  Netscape code just to get the basic browser released.
Lots of stuff didn't work at all because of the code loss.  

  While I'm a big fan of Open Source, I don't think we'll ever see massive
releases of old close source copywrited code to the Open Source world.  It's
a nice dream, but that's not the way corporate software development works.
It would simply be illegal or *very* difficult to do, with very little
economic benefits to doing the work.

It could have been 2.2.14.  There's at least one really nice filesystem 
corruption bug in that one.  Push the load on the disk subsystem up high 
enough for long enough and, voila, instant file puree.  Wheee!

This hit a company I worked for on the DB server.  MySQL gets quite cranky 
when the index files are toast.  Can't imagine why.  We even saw blocks of 
nulls appear in log files during operation (not after a crash where this can 
happen sometimes).  Needless to say this made the slave replica less than 
trustworthy too. 

Best,
Kyle

Absolutely. However, IMHO, the bragging ability of the administrator in
having a large uptime should not be factored into that decision.

Given the rpc worm going around, I'd rather more MS drones were actually
patching. 

However, you will get no argument from me that whether to patch and
when to patch are complicated issues. We presented a paper at LISA 2002
that tried to come up with a simple model about making that decision,
and attempted to collect some data on patch quality to help make that a
rational decision ("Timing the Application of Security Patches for Optimal
Uptime" <http://www.nxnw.org/~steve/papers/lisa2002-time-to-patch.pdf>).
Funnily enough, it was apparently a controversial paper with the program
committee, because there were several members who believed there's no
other answer to "When to patch?" than immediately.

Ultimately, the patch and pray cycle is a failed approach to system
administration, but it's roughly the best we've got. Approaches like what
Immunix, OpenBSD, and others are doing I believe will mitigate issues
and help us get out of this mess in the long term, but we're all still
issuing security advisories.

Mostly there's two prongs to my rant: 

  (1) the absence or presence of user accounts is a red herring. I've
      seen posts to plug and other lists where someone will say they
      don't need to apply a particular patch because it's a locally
      exploitable vulnerability and they're the only user. This is
      mis-guided because all the exploit requires is a shell, not a
      normally authenticated user shell.

  (2) uptime dicksize wars. When I've played systems administrator (I'm
      a bug producer^W^Wdeveloper now), I'd much rather have a system
      where I had to have planned downtime once every three months that
      lasted 5 minutes versus a system that had an uptime for a year,
      but took me a week or more to recover from being 0wned. (Don't
      believe it can take that long or longer? Look at all the work the
      FSF people are having to do to recover ftp.gnu.org.)

Anwyay, thanks for the discussion and suffering through my rants. I hope
this has been enlightening for somebody.

I'm wondering if this is related to my problems with Unreal Tournament
and this card.  After a few minutes, textures start getting messed up
pretty badly most of the time, about one out of five or so gos at it
gets it right.

Your argument ignores two things: 1) I'm not talking about a tarball
(then anyone could have it, and it'd be open source), I'm talking about
the source on a CD with the program. 2) I'm talking about ALL code, i.e.
a law requiring programs to come with their source code so you can see
what you're running on your system.

I've been trying to set up a network distributed dos system via netboot
with tcp/ip support using msclient.  Anyone know what driver to use for
the nic built into this motherboard and where to get it?  I use this
to access cabs and have played some dos games over network as well.

I'm hoping to use a network booted OS for backup and restoration.
Norton Ghost doesn't work worth a darn for this use.  Netbooted dos
won't work for post Windows 3.11 systems or Linux as it can't read the
partitions.  A netbooted Linux system that runs within say a 16 meg
ramdisk might do the trick though.  What accounts do you need though 
in this system?  What programs do you need remote filesystems for to
stay within 16 megs?   If you boot NFS root does that mean that you
don't have devices to access local hard drives on your machine?

An initrd is an initial ramdisk?  Is there a size limitation on 
this of 4 megs compressed?  If so, how can I create a small ramdisk
based system that creates a larger ramdisk, copies say a sixteen meg 
image to it, and then chroots to that to get around this problem? 
Probably the only thing that needs to persist is the dump space 
and swap space unlike a hard disk installed Linux system where /tmp 
and /var along with /usr and / have to persist after shutdown.  I
guess home should be mounted off of the server though does it have
to be?  Should this system NIS authenticate?  Do I want to use
Amanda?  

Traditionally, modules.conf is unique for machine A that has nic A
verses machine B that has nic B.  I want to have my Linux system work
equally well for machine A and machine B though.  I could create darn
near two exact copies of the same compressed root filesystem for A and
B, but that seems wasteful.  The latter is what I'm doing with msclient
dos disk images to support all the different nics.  The latter is 
reasonable because I have to change more than one file 
since I'm stuck with static ip assignment, a shortcoming of 
running a network over the same media as another one that 
has a dhcp server for the same workstations/terminals.

Should be a standard Intel Pro/100 PCI NIC driver.

Wow, sounds like you've done a lot of speculation about this.

System Imager certainly works well installing various Linux distros, and
I'd suggest you take a look at it in light of your questions.  I haven't
the faintest idea how SI is with Windows/DOS, but I'd guess that if you
can figure out how to write a DOS bootsector from Linux, it'd be fine.
I never got round to testing PartImage, but it's supposed to work well.

That sounds like a bad card.  Drivers just don't change and then fix
themselves, bad hardware is the most likely cause of inconsistent
behavior.  In this case, a section of video memory is probably bad.

I've been thinking the same.  The weather this summer has really,
really sucked and I think it's taken a toll on my system.

On the other hand, I noticed that there's an ati and a radeon driver.
I had been using ati, I'm trying radeon when I get home...

Well I have prodos package from Intel that's supposed to be for dos,

The NIC on that board is a 10/100/1000 adapter. The latest drivers should be available from www.intel.com use the support section. Look for motherboards - desktop - D845PEBT and then software etc. I'm sure you know the drill from there.

Have you considered studying other netbooted OS projects, like LTSP, to
see how others have successfully implemented your design goals?

http://cui.unige.ch/info/pc/remote-boot/howto.html is titled "Linux

Well, I went and got prodos.exe but unzip won't extract it and I don't
have a DOS environment to run it in.  And I have to meet someone for a
nice long ride to a nice 3-day debauch, so end of the line for me here.

Yep, most of the ones I've seen run Solaris or SunOS.  Still scary.

The kicker is that the power grid can run fine without most of these
computers, it just can't run at full capacity.  (Or, more precisely, it
can't run at 125+% capacity, only 100% capacity...)

If you are just wanting to get network booting up and running quickly
then I recommend using either
bpbatch  www.bpbatch.org
or
pxelinux  http://syslinux.zytor.com/

If your booting from linux and deal with the requirments for pxelinux,
then pxelinux allows multiple packages to be downloaded and extracted.

Not necessarly.  Solaris at one time had default network boot with NFS
mounting but the swap space was the local drive.  You will have to
figure out if the motherboard can make network booting priority ahead
of a local hard drive.  Sometimes this can be a pain.

Yes initrd is a initial ramdisk.
No, your not limited to 4megs compressed.  Just pass the command-line
arg to the kernel
"ramdisk_size=size_in_kbytes"
Part if the initrd is a file "/linuxrc" which is dependent on the image
being built.  It is the place that you do any and all of the setup and
configuration of the system.

A good reference for initrd stuff is the kernel docs,
[KERNEL_PREFIX]/Documentations/initrd.txt

If you have the kernel setup for different nics either built-in to the
kernel or
loaded as modules then you can use the same root filesystem for all
machines.

I'm looking into using filecache reading about bpbatch.  Apparently it
is an optional way to use a hard drive to improve performance though I
would think I could just use a ramdisk instead.  Isn't there cache NFS
or something similar which clevery uses an area in memory to store files
needing frequent access from a server?  Course it's best to
only cache read only files in ramdisk since you want to be able to turn
the computer off without doing a proper shutdown to avoid data loss.  I
don't think I need a cached network filesystem just to achieve dumping 
and restoring partitions though as slow operation probably won't be too
much of an issue.

Is this program updated for Redhat 7.2/7.3?  

Has anyone accessed a local hard disk on a machine booted with LTSP?
I wonder why in a default install of LTSP that you can't access the
drive(s)?  There's something about accessing a local floppy drive
but that looks like a major kludge.  Knoppix gives you local parition
access, unfortunately you have to have a cdrom drive that can boot.

Does the root partition have to be in ram or on the local drive for me
to be able to manipulate the local drive?  I guess no if sun used to put
the swap partition on the local hard disk and have root somewhere else.
I want to do something very similar except the local disk is not a
temporary space, it's what I need to do backup and restoration
operations on.

I've made Tom's root boot network boot by simply tagging a disk image
copy of the Tom's kernel and initrd image if I remember right.  Are
there any Linux distributions that are specifically written to be
installed on a host server for boot by network clients?  I guess the
issues that you have to look at closely is how to deal with temporary
and log files when setting something like this up.  I think the only
problems with using Tom's are twofold:  The backup/restore utilities
don't work as expected,  there's no modern filesystem support for ext3
and journaling.  Maybe I could get away with using a newer Tom's with
ext3 support if it can mount an nfs drive that has the normal tar, etc.
utilities.

I thought I had read something about Knoppix being able to do a netboot
for you. If this were to work , you'd only need the Knoppix OS server to
have a bootable CD, not all of the clients.

Building a 2.4 system in a small footprint, sure I want to know about
this.  It means a Linux system can be put together to fit within a small
ramdisk and then be netbooted for backup/restoration use.  I figure I
can nfs mount extra utilities if I need to.  How did you learn how to
build your own 2.4 system this tight?  The other option is to NFS mount
the root I guess, at this point do I need to use network block devices
to get at my client's local drives?  Knoppix boots off of CD but offers
access to the local drive, I'm wondering what's different between
Knoppix and Linux Terminal Server Project.  I've netbooted Tom's but
it has hacked utilities and lacks 2.4 features needed to back up a
2.4 system.

The network booted kernel can certainly access local drives.  It is easy 
to netboot the installers for most distribution.  With a little 
customization, it is even possible to do automatic installs with the 
network booting.  I bet LTSP left out the drivers to access the hard 
disk because they designed for diskless operation and that saves lots of 
space in the kernel image.

The root filesystem can be anywhere that the kernel can access.  The 
options are ramdisk, NFS mount, or local drive.  Also, when using an 
inital ramdisk, the init program on the ramdisk can load modules, find 
the real root filesytem, mount it, and switch the root to the new 
filesystem.  This is how installers work.  They boot from the floppy 
with a minimal kernel and initrd and then load the root filesystem from 
the installation media.

You can compile your own kernel with all the features you need.  That 
way you can compile all the drivers into the kernel and don't the 
initial ramdisk for the modules.  Also, if you use NFS mounted root 
filesystem, you can use more space than can fit into a ramdisk.

So a ptrace expoit, a thread process I guess.  How can an ordinary

permission elevation problem, or something else?

All,

I've just run across this link describing one "blogger's" account of
tracking down SUSE code in SCO's Unixware product. The full description
of the account is under the subsection, "Is There Linux Code in SCO's
UnixWare" here:

  http://radio.weblogs.com/0120124/2003/08/14.html

The thrust of the article relates to one developer's comparison between
SCO's UnixWare and SuSE's Linux Enterprise Server 8 and found the two
strikingly similar. Mr. Dohnert remarks:

"I found that several open source packages that are on UnixWare are also
on SLES 8. The inclusion of such packages may seem commonplace to some
but to me it struck me as odd in regards to the version numbers. The
version numbers of all the packages are exactly the same."

Mr. Dohnert went on to conclude:

"It is my belief and opinion that SCO has indeed borrowed engineering
concepts and methods from their association with UnitedLinux. Many of
these new features and the remarkable similarity with SLES 8 did not
occur until after they started to participate in UnitedLinux and since
these features were available to SuSE customers before SCO's involvement
I am inclined to believe that SCO's engineering team has been influenced
or tainted by the Linux development process. I cannot say if UnixWare
7.1.3 or SLES 8 share common code; as I said I am not a source licensee.
I feel these issues need to be investigated further."

This is where things start to get interesting. You see, according to a
July 11th 2003 ComputerWorld article, Sun and Microsoft have both signed
up for SCO's Unixware license, full details here:

http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/os/unix/story/0,10801,82967,00.html

For Sun's part, John Loiacono, VP of Sun's Operating Platform Group said
of the purchase,

"The most recent license, signed in February, "licensed several hundred
drivers to connect, essentially, peripheral devices to the operating
system," he said."

If one of those "drivers" turns out to be USB et al on their low-end
Intel line, Sun's "got problems."

The article states that the Microsoft license from SCO is similiar.

Here's the rub: if Sun or Microsoft is using any Unixware code in their
product, such as USB support, Xeon support, etc. and if a turns out that
a source audit of SCO's Unixware turns up GPL'd code (as it likely
would), then that means that SCO is licensing a product they do not
wholly own. Further, the fact that the code may very well now be found
in the Sun and Microsoft products as licensed from UnixWare means that
there is now at it's core GPL'd code in both SUN and Microsoft products.

This would explain why SCO is so eager to challenge the GPL (it doesn't
want to have to release the source code for Unixware) and it also offers
at least a plausible explanation why both Sun and Microsoft purchased
Unixware licenses for millions.

To the greatest logical extent this means that all three product lines'
source code would have to be released because all three rely on GPL'd
code to function.

The short rundown is this:

  1) SCO Joins UnitedLinux

  2) SCO's Unixware is influenced by UnitedLinux and GPL'd code put in
Unixware 

  3) SCO licenses Unixware to Sun, Microsoft

  4) Sun, Microsft integrate Unixware code in their products

  5) Uh, oh! Core code turns out to be GPL'd!!

  6) SCO Group lunches what boils down to be an anti-GPL suit while Sun,
Microsoft updates Unixware license for millions 

Would someone run a binary comparison or "strings" command against the
specific drivers outlined in the first article link above?



Best,

I don't see that.  I only see that the GPL code has 
to be treated properly whether it's nested into 
something else or not.  It would be a disaster for 
the long term future of the GPL license if it were 
interpreted so that truly proprietary code has to be 
opened because GPL code may be nested into it under 
improper licensing practices.  A jury could be 
convinced that this opening unfairly takes away a 
company's property.  I believe with BSD code that 
you can copy it verbatim or modify it and license 
that code in a proprietary way having heard this 
was what got Microsoft where it is today.  In all 
frankness though, why aren't companies like SCO etc. 
required to go through third party audits as lack 
of these will likely lead to more problems legal 
and otherwise?  This seems to be a case of get a 
bad name for GPL software at all cost, that being 
why Microsoft is involved even though SCO could 
wipe itself out wading in the center of this 
foolishness.

Maybe the game is violate the GPL to break the will
of the court to uphold it.  It is controversial to 
require public auditing of what likely are
proprietary products, but in the absence of 
audits will there be legal fights for many open 
source programs to prove they were GPL'ed first?

Where in copyright law does it say anything about 1 
copy for backup?!?  I though the latter only pertains 
to particular copyrights that are written to include 
that provision.

What worries me is the damage the way SCO and Microsoft want
to license software can do.  It's well known that Microsoft
products for example are highly resistant to debugging yet
ubiquitous at the same time.  Not only that, resistance to
quality improvements stifles ordinary competition as it is
"not profitable to write quality software since the market 
isn't able or willing to demand it."  In closed source 
software environments can the consumer pick up consumer
reports and decide to avoid certain software favoring the
better written alternatives or are there zero quality 
articles to that affect to read?

This is a simple question, but I don't know how to pose it to Google to
return the answer I'm looking for.  When I start a program from a
terminal window, is there a way to for the program (like Evolution or
Gaim) to continue to run normaly but return the prompt at th terminal
window so i can execute other commands?  My main reason for asking is,
sometimes I log into my computer via ssh and wish to run various
applications at the same time remotely but need to log in using seperate
clients to achieve this goal.

Thanks for any help

Try this:

filename &

The & tells it to run in the background.  To see what programs you have
running like this, use the command "jobs".

Is that what you are looking for?

Robbert,

To be really savvy and avoid the 'nohup.out' file, do this:

  % evolution & 1>/dev/null

This will surely impress your friends and gain their utmost respect.
Okay, so I've been working late... :-)

Alternatively, if you started a program, you can hit ctrl+z to "stop" 
it, which will return you to a prompt, and then you can issue the 
command "bg" to place it in the background.

This probably won't help with remote programs, but wrapping the above
in ()'s will detach the process from the parent (your shell, for bash
at least). This allows you to close the terminal without loosing the
program--something I do all the time on accident.

eg:

% (evolution & 1>/dev/null)

or just:

% (evolution &)

and close the terminal.

Robbert,

  Take a look at the documentation for the bash shell (I assume that's what
you're running) and read the section on running processes in the background.

I tested this. In my environment, ssh forwarding=yes. outputing channel 1
to /dev/null worked even having logged in remotely; no 'nohup.out' file
was created.

The normal way to write this is:

        evolution >/dev/null &

And it will get a SIGHUP when you close that window or connection,
so if it's not ignoring that, that'd be a bad thing.  You'll also
get a "you have stopped jobs" if that's a job-management shell.

        (evolution &) >/dev/null

will stop the job management functions.

You can then issue the command 'jobs' to see a list of all the jobs that 
are in the background. I do this when working in between many programs 
and switch between them.

I'm sorry, I meant that the information I provided about using ()'s
would not help with remote programs.

DEAR SIR/MADAM:

I AM MR. DARL MCBRIDE CURRENTLY SERVING AS THE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER OF THE SCO GROUP, FORMERLY KNOWN AS CALDERA SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL,
IN LINDON, UTAH, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I KNOW THIS LETTER MIGHT SURPRISE
YOUR BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD NO PREVIOUS COMMUNICATIONS OR BUSINESS DEALINGS
BEFORE NOW.

MY ASSOCIATES HAVE RECENTLY MADE CLAIM TO COMPUTER SOFTWARES WORTH AN
ESTIMATED $1 BILLION U.S. DOLLARS. I AM WRITING TO YOU IN CONFIDENCE BECAUSE
WE URGENTLY REQUIRE YOUR ASSISTANCE TO OBTAIN THESE FUNDS.

IN THE EARLY 1970S THE AMERICAN TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH CORPORATION
DEVELOPED AT GREAT EXPENSE THE COMPUTER OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE KNOWN AS
UNIX. UNFORTUNATELY THE LAWS OF MY COUNTRY PROHIBITED THEM FROM SELLING
THESE SOFTWARES AND SO THEIR VALUABLE SOURCE CODES REMAINED PRIVATELY HELD.
UNDER A SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT SOME PROGRAMMERS FROM THE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY
OF BERKELEY DID ADD MORE CODES TO THIS OPERATING SYSTEM, INCREASING ITS
VALUE, BUT NOT IN ANY WAY TO DILUTE OR DISPARAGE OUR FULL AND RIGHTFUL
OWNERSHIP OF THESE CODES, DESPITE ANY AGREEMENT BETWEEN AMERICAN TELEPHONE
AND TELEGRAPH AND THE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY OF BERKELEY, WHICH AGREEMENT WE
DENY AND DISAVOW.

IN THE YEAR 1984 A CHANGE OF REGIME IN MY COUNTRY ALLOWED THE AMERICAN
TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH CORPORATION TO MAKE PROFITS FROM THESE SOFTWARES. IN
THE YEAR 1990 OWNERSHIP OF THESE SOFTWARES WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE
CORPORATION UNIX SYSTEM LABORATORIES. IN THE YEAR 1993 THIS CORPORATION WAS
SOLD TO THE CORPORATION NOVELL. IN THE YEAR 1994 SOME EMPLOYEES OF NOVELL
FORMED THE CORPORATION CALDERA SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, WHICH BEGAN TO
DISTRIBUTE AN UPSTART OPERATING SYSTEM KNOWN AS LINUX. IN THE YEAR 1995
NOVELL SOLD THE UNIX SOFTWARE CODES TO SCO. IN THE YEAR 2001 OCCURRED A
SEPARATION OF SCO, AND THE SCO BRAND NAME AND UNIX CODES WERE ACQUIRED BY
THE CALDERA SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, AND IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE CALDERA
SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL WAS RENAMED SCO GROUP, OF WHICH I CURRENTLY SERVE AS
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER.

MY ASSOCIATES AND I OF THE SCO GROUP ARE THEREFORE THE FULL AND RIGHTFUL
OWNERS OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARES KNOWN AS UNIX. OUR ENGINEERS HAVE
DISCOVERED THAT NO FEWER THAN SEVENTY (70) LINES OF OUR VALUABLE AND
PROPRIETARY SOURCE CODES HAVE APPEARED IN THE UPSTART OPERATING SYSTEM
LINUX. AS YOU CAN PLAINLY SEE, THIS GIVES US A CLAIM ON THE MILLIONS OF
LINES OF VALUABLE SOFTWARE CODES WHICH COMPRISE THIS LINUX AND WHICH HAS
BEEN SOLD AT GREAT PROFIT TO VERY MANY BUSINESS ENTERPRISES. OUR LEGAL
EXPERTS HAVE ADVISED US THAT OUR CONTRIBUTION TO THESE CODES IS WORTH AN
ESTIMATED ONE (1) BILLION U.S. DOLLARS.

UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY EXTRACTING OUR FUNDS FROM THESE
COMPUTER SOFTWARES. TO THIS EFFECT I HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE MANDATE BY MY
COLLEAGUES TO CONTACT YOU AND ASK FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE. WE ARE PREPARED TO

Has anyone here used 'screen'? It works similarly to the "prog &"
command but it more powerful. I'm not sure where you can download it
from, but it comes in apt-get for Redhat, so I think it's a pretty
common utility.

Here is how it works.

1. login to machine with a terminal or ssh, etc.
2. type screen, then do whatever command(s) you want to

3. login from another terminal
4. type screen -d   (detach screen)
This will cause your first terminal session to be saved and continue
running in the background. You can not logout of your first (and second)
terminal and your commands from step 2 will continue to run in the
background.

5. When you want to resume your session from step #2, login to your
machine again and type screen -r. This will cause you to jump back into
your screen from step 2 as if you hadn't even left the session.

Notes: You can detach multiple screens. If you do so the "screen -r"
command will list the sessions and allow you to pick the screen session
you wish to resume.

I use screen to detach things that are more complicated than typing
something like 'grekllm &'. It works really well if you are compiling a
program on a remote computer and don't want to have to keep your
terminal open until the compile is done. I use it with Gentoo when I do
something like "emerge prog1 prog2 prog3" all the time.

Screen rules!  Nearly every character I've typed at a terminal
connection in the past three years has gone through an instance of
screen.

Even better, "screen emacs".  Then detach, reattach, and your emacs
is still there!

That's how I'm typing this.

If you want to kill the output, run 'nohup

Subject: [PLUG] The Beginning of the End
Message-ID: <1061061818.29483.94.camel@sparticus>

All,

I've just run across this link describing one "blogger's" account of
tracking down SUSE code in SCO's Unixware product. The full description
of the account is under the subsection, "Is There Linux Code in SCO's
UnixWare" here:

  http://radio.weblogs.com/0120124/2003/08/14.html

The thrust of the article relates to one developer's comparison between
SCO's UnixWare and SuSE's Linux Enterprise Server 8 and found the two
strikingly similar. Mr. Dohnert remarks:

"I found that several open source packages that are on UnixWare are also
on SLES 8. The inclusion of such packages may seem commonplace to some
but to me it struck me as odd in regards to the version numbers. The
version numbers of all the packages are exactly the same."

Mr. Dohnert went on to conclude:

"It is my belief and opinion that SCO has indeed borrowed engineering
concepts and methods from their association with UnitedLinux. Many of
these new features and the remarkable similarity with SLES 8 did not
occur until after they started to participate in UnitedLinux and since
these features were available to SuSE customers before SCO's involvement
I am inclined to believe that SCO's engineering team has been influenced
or tainted by the Linux development process. I cannot say if UnixWare
7.1.3 or SLES 8 share common code; as I said I am not a source licensee.
I feel these issues need to be investigated further."

This is where things start to get interesting. You see, according to a
July 11th 2003 ComputerWorld article, Sun and Microsoft have both signed
up for SCO's Unixware license, full details here:

http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/os/unix/story/0,10801,82967,00.html

For Sun's part, John Loiacono, VP of Sun's Operating Platform Group said
of the purchase,

"The most recent license, signed in February, "licensed several hundred
drivers to connect, essentially, peripheral devices to the operating
system," he said."

If one of those "drivers" turns out to be USB et al on their low-end
Intel line, Sun's "got problems."

The article states that the Microsoft license from SCO is similiar.

Here's the rub: if Sun or Microsoft is using any Unixware code in their
product, such as USB support, Xeon support, etc. and if a turns out that
a source audit of SCO's Unixware turns up GPL'd code (as it likely
would), then that means that SCO is licensing a product they do not
wholly own. Further, the fact that the code may very well now be found
in the Sun and Microsoft products as licensed from UnixWare means that
there is now at it's core GPL'd code in both SUN and Microsoft products.

This would explain why SCO is so eager to challenge the GPL (it doesn't
want to have to release the source code for Unixware) and it also offers
at least a plausible explanation why both Sun and Microsoft purchased
Unixware licenses for millions.

To the greatest logical extent this means that all three product lines'
source code would have to be released because all three rely on GPL'd
code to function.

The short rundown is this:

  1) SCO Joins UnitedLinux

  2) SCO's Unixware is influenced by UnitedLinux and GPL'd code put in
Unixware 

  3) SCO licenses Unixware to Sun, Microsoft

  4) Sun, Microsft integrate Unixware code in their products

  5) Uh, oh! Core code turns out to be GPL'd!!

  6) SCO Group lunches what boils down to be an anti-GPL suit while Sun,
Microsoft updates Unixware license for millions 

Would someone run a binary comparison or "strings" command against the
specific drivers outlined in the first article link above?

These guys were spreading some serious money around at Linuxworld 
this week.  Not only were there dozens of Helix employees in 
attendace, but all conference attendees were invited to a party 
at the bar next door to the convention center, and on the way in 
each of us was given a voucher goof for two drinks.

It looked to me that they were pretty serious about getting thier 
project off of the ground.

Curious if these look good on a resume or can aid in getting a

Well, I think they look good. :-)
Generally, yes. But it depends on the hiring company.
Of course, it may not appeal to companies looking for
Microsoft expertise. For that, you'll need to know
how to fdisk and reinstall. :-)

> or can aid in getting a certification.

These courses are not designed to train you to
pass certification tests. The DNS courses, in
particular, cover far more material than you'll
need for a certification. The Linux Networking
course is a better fit. It covers all the topics
that I've seen on certification tests, but goes
beyond that as well.

Note that we do offer a Linux Certification course
that focuses on those topics that are covered by
Linux certification tests. However, we just ran
this course recently and don't expect to do it again
soon - unless you have several friends that also want
to attend.

Note that these courses are not Red Hat-centric. They
try to be distribution-neutral.

Subject: [PLUG] xdm works but startx fails
Message-ID: <20030818130018.7b4e1f67.list@sonofhans.net>

Folks ~

My Thinkpad R32 loads X just fine after booting, but if I exit and then
later type "startx" it fails.  I'm running Debian 'testing' and, while
not an expert, have little trouble with it.  This has me stumped, though.

My XF86Config-4 is included below.

I diff'd a log file from a successful start (calling it 'xdm success
log') with one generated right after shutting down X and running 'startx'
('startx failure log').  The differences are all in the 'drmOpenDevice' section.

Can anyone tell me why this is happening and/or how to fix it?

TIA,

Randall

Can you run startx as root and have it work? You may not have search
permissions for /dev/dri/ when running startx. Do you have an old
XF86Config sitting in ~ ? (I don't really thin the second point is the
reason, but just in case)

No to both, but thanks for the reply.  I hadn't thought of either one,
and they're good suggestions.

Oops, I just realized that this statement is wrong.
Here's a more accurate statement:

The Linux Networking course is a better fit. It covers
all the _networking-related_ topics that I've seen on
certification tests, but goes beyond that as well.

Speaking for the DNS Boot Camp you'll be able to impress the interviewers
if they have a clue.  As for the HR types (that usually get first pass at
your application) anything more technical that the three finger dance will
impress them.

How are you "exiting" xdm?  If you are just quitting, but not actually
stopping xdm, then it may be trying to re-spawn.  Try the command:

startx -- :2

If that works (you will have an xserver on the F8 console) then xdm is
trying to respawn, or is not releasing the xserver resources for the F7
console.  It should stop running with the command:

/etc/init.d/xdm stop

Good Luck,

Derek Loree

startx > x.log 2>&1 

This will forward all the errors into the log file.  Reading it can be
helpful.

I wonder about X already running on (or locking) F7......

        I do need a project still.  I plan on bringing the one that
        needs a power supply fix (really I am), so if you can bring a projector please
        email me.  Thanks!

It doesn't work, but thanks very much for the suggestion.  I removed
xdm from the startup sequence a week ago to check this very thing, but
it didn't make any difference.  Then I put it back, since that's the
only way it'll work.

Thanks for the suggestion.  This is how I generated the log bits I
included in my original mail.  They weren't very helpful to me (or
Google), but I'm still hoping someone here can decipher them a little.

I wondered about it too, but I think I've eliminated that fairly well
by removing xdm from startup (no change).

We need to see the part of your startup log that indicates the error usually 
the end! the line may start like (EE)

Also make sure no other X display managers are running behind your back, 
namely gdm or kdm.

Unclear reference to what doesn't work.  Did you try the command:

startx -- :2

and what did the log say?

Hmm, if I'm remembering your circumstances this shouldn't be the case, but 
is the 'agpgart' module loaded?  (type lsmod)

If not, look in /etc/modules.conf for that module and see what may be 
unloading it when it exits.  It'd be strange to find that module in that 
file, but I don't know jack about debian (I think you said that's what this 
was).

I'm probably way off base and should be asking different questions.  (Where 
are the questions?)

No.

I found:
    alias char-major-10-175 agpgart

I have no idea what it means.

FWIW, 'insmod agpgart' loads the module, but detects the wrong video
card:
    agpgart: Detected Indel i845 chipset

After that 'startx' and the /var/log/XFree86.0.log are the same.

> I'm probably way off base and should be asking different questions. 

Thanks for trying.  We're not really rowing anywhere, but we sure are
stirring up the water :)

Subject: [PLUG] Stumped by tape driver errors...
Message-ID: <1061308853.32157.15.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I'm trying to find out if my DI30 tape drive functions properly.
So far I've only gotten a new name brand onstream tape to work in it.
I try using Verbatim cartridges I picked up and it gives all kinds
of errors " blank block read/write error. "

What's the probability that the heads simply need to be cleaned?
Has anyone used these tape drives with a 2.4 kernel?  I'm trying
to use 2.2.14 and am starting to wonder if I might be running 
into a bug.  I use the following proc command, 
     tar cvfb 64 /dev/nht0 --exclude=/proc /

on my 386 in single user mode.

This is a $150 drive, I wonder if anyone can repair them?  I've
been very disappointed with Onstream technology, the company's
failure to market it's tape products has meant the near impossibility
of getting name brand media and when you can it's upwards of $30+ 
a tape.  Since the tapes really only hold 15 megs uncompressed data
and have given me so much trouble, this is no deal.  It would be
cheaper to wait for another loss leader on 120 gig hard drives and
pick up a couple of those.  Is there any tape drive that functions
decently capable of reading the DI30 ADR tapes?

I know the pressure is to go to serial ATA and DVD, however, DVD's are
are not reusable and both harddrives and DVD burners will fail long
before a tape drive will.  How does IBM's honeycomb system work?
One thing that drives me crazy about the DI30 is the block size bug
and the possibility that the patch to fix it is proprietary.

If I came to a Linux clinic would there be any tape experts there?

  Is this a Travan technology drive? I had all sorts of fits trying to get
various drives and tapes to work consistently. The only person _I_ know who
did so is one of the fellows at what is now The Tolis Group -- the folks who
produce BRU. He told me it took their collective expertise to get it working
reliably.

  A few years ago I bit the bullet and purchased a Tandberg SLR drive. The
first one, the 5 MB model, is arguably the slowest tape drive ever made.
About 3 years ago (I don't remember exactly), I traded that in for an SLR-60
drive (60M compressed) and it has run without error ever since. It's asked
twice to be cleaned and I've done so. Too much cleaning is no good for the
drive. The tapes cost $70 each, but I have only 3 (two weekly, full backups
that I alternate and a daily, incremental backup).

  For a business -- even a small one like mine -- the data are critical.
This system has run flawlessly for several years and I cannot speak too
highly of the tech support and quality of hardware at Tandberg.

Yup; no difference.  The output of 'startx' was identical.  The log
file itself had a couple minor differences:

/var/log/XFree86.0.log :
(++) RADEON(0): DPI set to (100, 100)
...                         ^^^  ^^^

/var/log/XFree86.2.log :
(==) RADEON(0): DPI set to (75, 75)
...
drmOpenDevice: node name is /dev/dri/card0
drmOpenDevice: open result is 6, (OK)

Thanks for your help so far.

As root, type 
  telinit 3

This will go to non-x login mode.

Then 
  ps ax | grep dm

And see if any display managers are running.

Then try (as user)

  startx > x.log 2>&1

Everything was going swimmingly, until ...

when I type mount /mnt/floppy the system mounts as read-only.

my first try was get root & do chmod 777 /mnt/floppy but it said that I 
couldn't do that ...

Is this a user/groups thing? (if so, where to look?)

If not, is there a simple tweak?

This is the North bridge chipset, not the video card, this is the
correct behavior.  What does the command:

lspci

show is running on the agp?

Is it possible that you have two different versions of your XF86Config
file, one being loaded on startup, the other is trying to load with the
startx command.  I've come across this before, but I don't remember the
circumstances, seems like it was during the transition to the new config
file XF86Config-4 (the different dpi setting is a clue along those
lines).

Good Luck

It's not a Travan driven, it's an ADR drive made by Onstream.  It's
supposed to be fully Linux compatible but you have to apply a weird
patch to the ide tape driver.  It has problems being detected properly
for it's 32 kb block size.  Does Tandberg make anything in the $150
range that can do 30 gigs compressed?  What is the cartidge cost?  Maybe
I should wait for another loss leader on hard disks like the one that
Western Digital did at Fry's recently dumping 120's at $60 a pop 
and just build a raid box.  Four drives at those prices is comparable
to a single DI30 drive with a few tapes.  Long run you pay more, but on
the other hand it's a lot easier to get a hard drive to work than a
tape, especially when the tape drive manufacturer has financial trouble.
One downside of cheap hard drives is that they tend to burn out within
three years of use.

Maybe Bru will work properly with this tape drive.  I could try the
Windows software but I'm guessing one of the reasons it may work is
that it may not do error correction.

Maybe I should call the tape supplier, PC Mall, and see if they 
can sell me a drive that works with the verbatim media I bought.  
Maybe there's a bug in the drive  I have.

  What do you have in /etc/fstab for that mount point?

Gotta ask...

Is the read-write tab in the correct position?

If you mount the device explicitly, then you should have read-write
access:

mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy

of course, it must not be mounted before running this command.

As Rich mentioned, the /etc/fstab file is the place to look to get the
originial command to mount as read-write, unless this is being run
through automount, then you need to look at the automount definitions.

Well, it looks like a new DI30 drive is $250 but the cleaning cartridges
are hard to get and the onstream site, http://www.onstream.com, seems to
be gone.  I think I was looking at Tandberg TR-4, what do the SLR drives
cost?  I have five brand new tapes, maybe I can sell everything.

Michael,

  Only two comments I can offer. The first, as you have learned, is that the
cost is more than what you plunk down initially. The second is to check both
the Tandberg USA Web site for specials and pricewatch.com to see what they
have. I bought my SLR-60 at half-price under one of their unadvertised
"evaluation programs". Call or e-mail them to see if they'll cut a deal with
you.

  If I recall correctly, I paid about $700 for my drive several years ago.
Yes, it's a lot of money, but I've paid it no attention since then (other
than the three times it asked to be cleaned and I ran the cartridge through
it). So, amortizing the drive cost and the approximately $250 for three
tapes and a cleaning cartridge over 4 years, that's a reasonable price for
me. I spend no time away from work getting it working properly, the backups
are made from cron jobs and all I do is replace the daily cartridge with the
appropriate weekly one on Friday afternoon and reverse the procedure on
Monday. While I cannot put a dollar value on the time I have not spent
futzing with a tape backup system, I know that the cost has been acceptably
low.

HTH,

Rich

Greetings folks,

I need to setup a linux box as a firewall/server in my
home through which two other computers will access the
net. I've run out of time to try and stumble though it
myself because classes for my last year of law school
start next Monday.

I already have the requisite hardware (two different
boxes to choose from, a switch, appropriate number of
network cards, plenty of cable).  I'm willing to talk
cash if someone wants to come over to my house and
mostly set up the network for me with appropriate
firewalls in place and maybe even the ability to host a
website from my house using apache (I have a dedicated
IP address through dsl-only).

Email me if you are interested and then we can
negotiate.

Thank you.

If you need to setup a dedicated server you should consider running
e-smith (http://www.e-smith.org). I started using it after my boss had
people in Bali (who spoke very little English) install it so he could
access some computers there.

I can't figure it out either. It seems like it's a server for the
communication with other computers, but that covers, you know, the
internet, computers, etc. It seems very general.

And it modifies /etc/inittab so it respawns on the first and second
virtual terminals instead of getty, which just terrifies me. =)

I just survived several months with a cell phone as my only means of
Internet connection... but it wasn't plugged in to my laptop (rather, it
was plugged in to a friend's windoze box).

Anyway...

Who is your service provider?  These days, it seems, the cell phone
itself acts as a modem.  With that particular (Sprint PCS) setup, you
installed drivers for the (USB cell phone) modem and dialed #777.  No
username, no password... that was all there was to it.

If you're with AT&T, I would guess you are totally out of luck unless
you want to spend a fortune.  They were quoting me prices like $11 for
the first 4MB then only a penny for each additional... kilobyte.

There was another provider... T-Mobile, I want to say... that had a
setup identical to Sprint's.

Others... I don't know.

Anyway, hope this helps at least shed a little bit of light on the
subject.

It should mount read/write unless you have the write protect tab on.

What user are you when you mount the floppy?

Jim, email me the network specs and I'll forward you the floppy image for
a floppyfw that will do what you want it to do and instructions for
writing that image to a diskette.

On second reading, I guess you want something other than just a firewall.

Personally, I don't recommend running externally accessible services on
your NAT/firewall machine and I don't think anybody else here would,
either, but that's flexible based on your personal needs and expectations.

I'll write a little doc on e-smith when I get a chance. It's a pretty
slick setup. Their web site doesn't do the best job of explaining
exactly what E-smith is. The e-smith.com site is REALLY bad with all
it's marketing speak.

Message-ID: <200308191331.28918.mountainman@peak.org>

As many of you are already aware, a second Open Source bill has 
been introduced in the Oregon legislature.  Others get the credit 
for getting this one put in; I've been busy with other, 
less-worthwhile pursuits.  

Anyway, the new bill is identical to what my bill would have 
looked like, after amendments (which was killed before the 
amendments were considered).  It gets a hearing day after 
tomorrow.

We're going to try not to make the same mistakes we made with the 
first bill.  We don't expect anything new from the opposition.  
Those of you on the other side of the country can listen to the 
hearing (RealPlayer format) through a link on the Oregon 
legislature's web site.  Please use a search engine to find it; 
I'm dealing with an unrelated small emergency here.

I've had better luck with a CD based firewall called Gibraltar 

http://www.gibraltar.at/  

It is capable of doing most of the common VPN schemes.  Of course, you
will need to know what the school is doing before I can say whether or
not it will work.

Good Luck,

Many debian tools have been ported to other distributions, and
vice-versa...

With RPM's dependencies as they are, it likely wasn't too difficult a
job to make apt-get work with RPMs instead of .deb's.

apt-get was ported to rpm based distros a while back. Even though I have found it to not work quite as well as it does on Debian itself, it still works great.

It was ported by Connectiva (IIRC).

Take a look at http://freshrpms.net for apt rpms and more info.

Apt-get works quite well in Redhat. It makes it really easy to get some
programs that Redhat doesn't install by default. Synaptic (gui front end
to apt-get) has also been ported and works well too.

Be aware that Apt-get for RH and Ximian desktop can not both be
installed on the same computer. Ximian has a whole bunch of RPM
conflicts that break apt-get.

Actually, this isn't true.  I've used apt + Ximian on both RH 8 and 9. 
The worst I've had happen is the occasional unnecessary update.  I've
read warnings about doing so, but have yet to experience breakage.  The
only problem I've experienced to date is combining rawhide with Ximian.

yum (Yellowdog Updater, Modified) is an alternative to apt for RPM based

Dear Messrs. Gates and Ballmer,

I know that many people grumble about the worms and viruses that have
frequently exploited features and vulnerabilities in your widely used
Windows operating environment and Office productivity suite.

Personally, I don't use Windows or Office, so I'm unfit to comment on
the grumblings of end users.

As an IT professional, however, I don't understand the cynicism and
eye rolling among my colleagues. They're always grumbling and forever
pointing out that Macintosh and Unix systems aren't vulnerable to
these attacks. My opinion is the all those worms and viruses are to be
welcomed, for a number a reasons:

* The thanks expressed by users and managers after I rescue them time
  after time from Windows exploits gives me wonderful self-esteem.
  (Unlike those thankless Macintosh and Unix users who never need
  saving from viruses -- ever.)

* When a virus or worm hits the Internet, I am completely free from
  tasks that require true thought or creativity -- or that add any
  value to my employer's business. Instead, I get to daydream while
  going from workstation to workstation applying patches and cleaning
  up after the exploit.

* After the imminent threat has passed, I get to provide some great
  statistics -- including pie charts! -- to the company managers. It's
  just about the only opportunity the IT staff ever gets to show off
  pie charts.

* Since viruses and worms are difficult to understand, my job seems
  all the more mysterious, raising its perceived (and monetary) value.

* The same thing can be said about making sense of all the patches,
  service packs, and hot fixes your company releases. Only a true IT
  professional really knows which ones are necessary, which ones won't
  crash Windows, etc.

* The continued success of the anti-virus industry provides more
  IT employment opportunities and in general raises the value of tech
  stocks.

Surely there are other things that could be added to this list, but
you're busy men, and I shouldn't take up too much of your time.

Again, as an IT professional, I encourage you to keep up the good
work. Others may grumble about the waste of time and productivity, but
I know who's buttering my bread!

Thank you.

Hi All,
Okay, I recently was reading somewhere on how to install software on
Linux so that multiple users could access it from a SOHO network. It
was a great article and like all such articles, got me to thinking
about doing the same thing. Now, I can't seem to find the articles. So
this is what I have in mind:

I have downloaded and copied onto the hard drive the two files (one is
a gz the other a rpm.bin) that are the software releases.
I'd like to be able to have several users logon and use them from
their native home directories.
How or what do I do, and to what directories and paths do I install so
that users from across the network can access these programs?

the programs are Java sdk 1.4.2 and Open Office.

If I could find a good website with explanation I could print would be
my first choice ( after all, if I can read it, I can teach myself to
do it) or if there is something I'm overlooking that I should already
know(Why Yes, I have taken classes in Linux at school.....) then a
gentle 2x4 to the back of my head would be appropriate.
Or, if you just want to explain to me the best way you have found to
do it, I'd be happy to give my thanks once I'd gotten said software
working appropriately.

In any case, I'm looking for feedback.

Thanks in Advance,

Harry

Harry,

  There are two solutions, and they depend on your hardware setup. Both make
use of /usr/local and/or (that's not a directory path) /opt.

First, consider the single machine with multiple users. Install OO.o into
/usr/local using the network install option. Then, either log into each
user's account or have him/her do so and run the user install. The OO.o Web
site has explicit instructions. This places a directory, OpenOffice_1.0.3 in
each user's $HOME directory. Install the java sdk in /usr/local, too. Enjoy.

Second, consider the SOHO network. While you _could_ export /usr/local, it
may cause gas when you upgrade because there may well be applications that
are truly local to a particular machine. So, on your "server", create an
exportable partition and call it by the accepted name of /opt (but you can
use whatever you wish). Install both OO.o and jsdk in /opt.

On your server, in /etc/exports enter a line such as:
/opt    192.168.55.0/24(rw)
using your local IP address, of course. This makes the filesystem visible to
every host on the network and it does so in read/write mode.

On each client machine, in /etc/hosts/ you have all of your machines
specified by name and IP address. So, in each machine's /etc/fstab, give it
a mount point for the exported filesystem. For example,

caddis:/usr2            /mnt/usr2       nfs     rw,rsize=8192,wsize=8192 0 0

Then run the mount command and the exported file system is visible on the
other machine as if it was a local filesystem.

For your reading pleasure, allow me to recommend the NAG (Network
Administrators Guide).

HTH,

Rich

non-business related messages come from those who will not (or can not) turn

in the header_checks of postfix.

  However, what effect would I see if I put a rule that specified
"multipart/alternative" as a reason for rejection? As a non-winduhs user I
have no idea of the meanings of the various strings associated with the
Content_type variable.

You probably don't want to do that; the result would be about the same
as rejecting all HTML-formatted messages.

Let me know if you need more info on the multipart/alternative MIME

This is a known issue.  Check the bugs or search the evolution list
archives for mozilla (mail-list (sp?) or google).

If I remember it was library issues, evolution was using some of
mozilla's libraries which moved recently (or the Red Hat build moved
them).

It was one of those surprises that happens when relying on another's
programs.

I believe if you kept the ximian version of mozilla it would work, or
install the newer version on top of the older.

At a minimum there are work arounds posted in the list.


So in this case apt-get did not break anything, installing different
distributions broke it (i.e. non-ximian mozilla).

'ln -s /usr/lib/mozilla-<latestversion> /usr/lib/mozilla' or use
ldconfig to help Evo locate the libraries (Evo relies on mozilla-psm,
iirc).  This had nothing to do with apt.

Paul,

  That's what I suspected from my reading. Sigh. What I'd really like is a
postfix regex that would reject both messages with empty bodies and
Microsoft virus attachments (i.e, any attachment that ends with something
other than .doc or .xls; I sometimes get legitimate attachments in those
formats. I keep playing with stuff, but haven't yet struck pay dirt.

Thanks,

Don't know if this is possible, but what if you opened 
suspicious email in a virtual environment insulated from 
your real one and evaluated the effect, if any, on that 
environment?  This way you can catch improper behavior 
and allow other html email through.  As long as the
virtual environment when infected can't take down the
host or leak out worms, etc., your set.

Another option is to only accept html email that is 
clearly formed by safe tools from a trusted source.
Guess you'd have to parse style and/or use 
cryptographic signatures.

HTML emails are just text programs, why can't they
be opened by something that won't execute them for
scanning purposes?  Isn't html language finite 
enough to where you can create a filter that 
looks for obvious things like file creation and 
deletion directives, etc.?  Just why is it that
programs like Outlook Express that crave html
formatted email and attachments are so worm and
virus friendly?

Michael,

  The short answer is that I don't make my living as a Sys Admin. Dealing
with this junk costs me time and money. I'd rather have postfix stop it at
the door and all I see is the daily log summary.

> Just why is it that programs like Outlook Express that crave html
> formatted email and attachments are so worm and virus friendly?

  Others can respond to this more intelligently than can I, but I want to
make two points.

  First, GUI MUAs do not "crave" html; they merely allow it. It's companies
like AOL, Microshaft and a bunch of other "consultants" who push the FUD
that plain text is so passe and people _need_ the eye-candy crap of html
formatted e-mails in order to "dress up" their messages.

  It's no wonder that people mis-communicate so frequently. It used to be
that language skills were desired so that both written and oral
communications could be effective. How would you like to be a part of a fire
team on the front lines in Iraq, Afganistan, Liberia, South Korea or the
Phillipines and your squad leader was brought up on video games and GUI
e-mail? Guess how information flows to you? Yup, radio. No color-screened
cell phone with camera and Web browser built in. I had a lot of friends in
Viet Nam who would not accompany combat patrols if there was any doubt about
the ability of the folks in their squads to effectively communicate using
only words.

  Second, I do not believe that it's the MUA that is so worm and virus
friendly. It's the Microsoft applications (Word, Excel and others) that have
more holes than Swiss cheese. And the gullibility of folks who still believe
there's such a thing as a free lunch. Why do you think the 419 scam has been
running successfully for 20 years? First it was by letter mailed through the
postal services (the 1980s), then faxes (the 1990s) and now e-mails. And
every year hundreds of greedy people world-wide fall for it. Most lose only
all their money. The really greedy ones get kidnapped, beaten, sometimes
killed.

  We're dealing with a people problem here more than anything else. This
suggests it will only get worse and never be solved.

Not exactly what you're asking for....

But have you looked in to the AMaViS/SpamAssasin combo?

It's way more full-fledged than what you seem to be looking for, but it
would be able to do the trick, most likely.  :-)

A nice, isolated test box would be very educational. As long as it's not 
connected to anything else, it's safe. If you're asking about something like 
VMWare or WINE, I wouldn't consider either one safe.

 Oh, let us resist the temptation to rail on about the many and infinite 
weaknesses of Outlook and Outlook Express... the short answer is, I suppose 
programs could be created to scan and evaluate HTML. I'm not sure how 
effective they would be, however. If you've looked at the code in spams, 
you've noticed the many ways HTML tags and character codes are used to break 
up the wording; to dodge filters, to obscure redirects and hidden formfields, 
and for obscuring javascript and VBscript. Also there are many different ways 
to write scripts to do the same actions. I'm not a programmer, so I don't 
know how difficult it would be to write something to evaluate all these 
things. 

Also, even in non-malicious mail, marketingdroids are completely incapable of 
resisting the temptation to bestow upon recipients a "rich multimedia 
experience." Think of all the annoying things that happen on Web pages- 
popups, popunders, Flash, redirects, disabled back buttons, Web bugs, 
fetching images and content from widely-scattered, rude sounds, slow servers- 
all of this can be done in HTML email.

And even when it's not spam, or a virus/trojan/other malware, or a "rich 
multimedia experience", you can bet money that someday the tools will be 
avaiable for your friends and family to easily create their own "rich 
multimedia" messages to send you.

Which is my longwinded way of saying I think it would be easier, and better, 
to create an ornamental display format for email that cannot contain any 
executables. People want pretty email, it's not going away. So it makes more 
sense to me to create a format that cannot be exploited for evil.

One approach is moving people to an html alternative that won't be a
carrier of viruses for Microsoft's junk.  A picture is worth a thousand
words if it's well chosen and doesn't crash the communication device of
the person your trying to reach :-)  Maybe this is one area, people
wanting to do intricate emails and not knowing how to do plain text in
many cases, where gurus can really make inroads.  

I guess the trick is coming up with an easier solution than all programs
that take email as input have to be secure because the email is
dangerous.  Then again, maybe going with software can be fixed is the
best, if not most time consuming, approach.  How do you make a living
fixing software?  Is it possible to get enough information about the
internals of Windows to make alternative mail programs that are safe and
full featured run on it?  It seems you'd do better to make the operating
system protect poorly written software from dangerous input than
fix the software itself.  Of course if I was rich enough I wouldn't need
to make a profit on fixing programs ;-)

I've heard good things about IP Cop.  It's a minimal firewall type install 
with a fairly nice web gui.  It's a spinoff (read: fork with extreme 
prejudice) from Smoothwall.  I've used the latter and found it to be really 
good though the people who write it should probably not be let out in public 
too often for fear of scaring away customers.  IP Cop doesn't seem to have 
that problem.

http://www.ipcop.org

Here's the VPN admin manual pages:

http://www.ipcop.org/1.3.0/en/admin/html/vpnaw.html

The installation manual was updated just a few days ago, so there is very 
recent activity on the project.  I haven't followed it personally.

Best,
Kyle

Thanks again to those of you that came to this evening's PLUG

were excellent questions, and I think I did my job right, which was 
to get everyone running home to look for a spare box or some free

system.

I'd like to at this time put my powerpoint slide show up for general

of you that could not type as fast as I could page through my slides, 
here is a more permanent version:

I would only ask if that you use this slideshow or portions of it, 
that you retain my name, email address, and copyright notices for

The basic problem isn't in the data format (HTML). It's
with the underlying system that's so easily tricked into
executing code.

At tens of millions of lines of code, you're better off

You shouldn't expect applications to be more secure

  Or the users of that application/platform. As an example of your typical
M$/AOL user see today's "Oregonian". They have a great article on how many
accidents there have been since Sunday on Hwy 26 at Sylvan. Because of
construction, the left lane is now the Canyon Road exit and the two right
lanes are for through traffic. Even with a total of 10 signs in the mile
approaching the change, folks are cutting over at the last minute. Many miss
and hit the barrels or other vehicles. Same mindset.

You're right; they are rather opaque in their marketing speak. From my
reading of the website, I would have thought e-smith's software had
nothing to do with firewalls. To me, it looks like a system for
automating the configuration of several servers so that the network
administrator can be confident of a consistent configuration across the
enterprise. That's MY clueless reading, but I had to click through three
different pages to gather these facts.

If I'm completely off-base (and I admit that I could be), I'd appreciate
some correction.

Interesting.  I did and only saw up to the seventeenth ... OOPS wrong

For some reason I'm not getting anything.

So I like to be able to go "ssh hostname" instead of "ssh

domain2.com" then it tries all of those in order and saves me the trouble
of typing the domain name.
When I converted this rh9 machine over to DHCP, I found that
/sbin/dhclient-script overwrites /etc/resolv.conf and eliminates the
search parameter.  Is there any way to feed options like "search
domain1.com domain2.com" to dhcpd?  I can't figure out how.  Or is there a
another way, perhaps hacking /sbin/dhclient-script so that it doesn't
overwrite /etc/resolv.conf search parameters?

Any advice is appreciated.

Their marketing speak is pretty crappy. I've tried to read it a few
times and just give up. I really couldn't make any sense of it either.

> some correction.

Sure thing. Here is what E-smith really is/does:

1. You are correct that it's primary function isn't a firewall. It can
be used as a firewall though.

2. E-smith is an easy to setup Linux distro based on RedHat (version 8
now I think).

3. E-smith has a really slick web based interface for managing it. You
can manage almost everything from the web based interface.

4. E-smith has what are called i-Bays. These are separate storage areas
on your server that you can setup. These 'ibays' allow you to share
files through samba or netatalk. You can also set them up to allow you
to FTP to them or put web pages up in them. You can define who has
access to the ibays and if they are accessible from the web, local
network and if they require a password for access or not. There are a
fair amount of configurations you can set for each ibay.

5. E-smith is also setup by default (well it's an easy to select option)
to be a network Gateway.

6. E-smith is setup out of the box to handle network printing. You can
hook your printer up through your E-smith box and then share it over the
network.

7. E-smith also handles email & other things that other any Linux server
would.

The main things that I like about E-smith is that it is VERY easy to
setup and maintain. Their web based interface works really well if you
use it as a file/print/gateway server. There are also a bunch of 3rd
party modules that people have built for E-smith. Overall it's a good
server for some circumstances...

Hope this clarifies some of the confusion. I'll put up some screen shots
when I get a chance. Let me know if you have any questions.

Red Hat provides a way for the local admin to tell pump or dhclient
not to update /etc/resolv.conf.

Edit /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 (replacing 'eth0' with
the actual name of your ethernet interface) and add a single line:

PEERDNS=no

The full and gory details can be found in /sbin/ifup; the relevant
section reads,

    if [ "${PEERDNS}" = "no" ]; then
       # Do not update/replace resolv.conf.
       PUMPARGS="${PUMPARGS} -d"
       DHCPCDARGS="${DHCPCDARGS} -R"
    fi

Once you've updated the ifcfg file, and assuming you're working at the
machine's console (i.e., not over the network), then

1. /etc/init.d/network stop

2. Edit /etc/resolv.conf to fit your needs

3. /etc/init.d/network start

 If you running it in a bash shell you could
create an alias

alias ssh-host='ssh hostname.domain.com'

then to connect type
$ ssh-host

or in /etc/hosts

ip.number.here   domain.name.here   shortcutname

65.213.217.241   nsa.gov            nsa

Message-ID: <aDNFP=ftjV0zasg1lubr9lI34LTT@4ax.com>

Hi All,

Anyone have any experience with the Linksys KVM switch?
I have a 4 port and it doesn't like my optical wheel mouse.
Mouse is a logitech with a usb connector being adapted to a ps/2.
Mouse works plugged in directly to box, but is a hit/miss plugged into
the switch. I also have to figure out how to get the switch to make
the leap to a AT keyboard(I think it will work with an adaptor)
 
I using the switch to allow me to use one monitor between three boxes
(linux server and two workstations). I presently have a non optic,
non-wheel mouse for testing, but would like my opti-wheels instead.
Any info out there?

thanks,
Harry

I'm trying to make an image 50% of it's original size and convert it from
TIFF to PNG.

When I use convert without any options, I get the following:
convert image.tiff image.png

117K image.tiff
206K image.png

I'm not sure why PNG is so much larger, but whatever...
Here's the odd part:

convert -resize 50% image.tiff image-50.png

654K image-50.png

The image looks 50% smaller when I open it, but why did the file size
balloon?  And what do I need to do to make it a smaller file size?
Thanks,

Catchy first name, by the way.  I also seem to remember that one can use a 
local ssh_config to do interesting things like this.  I haven't tried it, 
yet. I'll have to consult the ssh book when I get home tonight.

Subject: [PLUG] Oregon Open Source bill 941 hearing summary
Message-ID: <p05210622bb6aebed6fe5@loligo.com>

I was not very impressed with the people who spoke for the 941 bill, 
though they gave some good points.  They missed the major point, that 
needed to be made as the primary point but was COMPLETELY overlooked.

Summary of the Bill: It says that state purchasing agents (managers, 
etc.) SHALL evaluate open source solutions as a potential solution 
against any other evaluated solution.


So, a good point was made: Why do we need this legislation?  There is 
nothing stopping purchasing agents from choosing open source 
currently, and in fact open source is used in quite a few places in 
the state's IT infrastructure currently.

The reason the bill is needed is that there are no proponents for 
open source software other than the people who are deploying these 
systems.  There is a huge disparity in name recognition or even 
awareness for open source software projects as compared to 
proprietary software systems.  This is because open source software 
doesn't make money - they can't afford advertising, even though the 
"product" that these projects deliver is, in some cases, much better 
than the closed source versions.

There are no "sales people", there is no "collateral", no advertising 
blitzes, no full page ads in Wired magazine.  Open Source travels by 
word of mouth.  The only advocates are generally the low-level grunts 
that install the stuff and have to deal with the day to day 
operations - they are advocates, since they KNOW it works better. 
Everyone else up the ladder of management is often unaware (with some 
rare exceptions) of the existence of packages that could do the same 
thing for free.

The legislation is required to force the decision makers into asking 
this question of themselves and their staff before making a decision: 
"Have I examined the costs and features of any free software that 
provides the same functions as other packages that I am evaluating?"

These managers are busy people.  They will not go out of their way to 
find a free solution if they are not forced to do it.  The 
proprietary solution is easy to find: the sales guy is leaping up and 
down outside of the manager's window holding a big sign that says 
"Buy Me!" while open source has no such method of advertising itself.

There is nothing in this bill that forces a manager to choose open 
source software.  It simply forces them to find out if there is a 
free (or lower cost) solution that exists to provdide the same 
functionality.  That is a very moderate and reasonable thing to ask 
in the handling of my tax dollars.

Epilogue: Plus, while this may not have been their choice, the 
pro-941 speakers let the opposition speak last, which allowed the 
Fear Uncertainty and Doubt creep into the discussion.  ("I'm not 
sure...",  "I don't think we're ready...", "We should give this to 
the task force..." - all of these are obvious bluffs to confuse the 
legislators, which I see partially succeeded.)

Sometimes tiff is actually a bit smaller than png and jpg - if the image is

better choice for the file if you are so inclined to use it.

Subject: [PLUG] Strange Image Magick issue


I'm trying to make an image 50% of it's original size and convert it from
TIFF to PNG.

When I use convert without any options, I get the following:
convert image.tiff image.png

117K image.tiff
206K image.png

I'm not sure why PNG is so much larger, but whatever...
Here's the odd part:

convert -resize 50% image.tiff image-50.png

654K image-50.png

The image looks 50% smaller when I open it, but why did the file size
balloon?  And what do I need to do to make it a smaller file size?
Thanks,
~M

Matt,

  Have you tried this with the GIMP?

  I've found that the .png is smaller than the .jpg. Can't say that I've
noticed if I've scaled the image by 0.5 at the same time.

John,

  There is another way: find a problem that needs to be solved sooner rather
than later, then show how FOSS can provide that solution now. I'm not an
IT/MIS/whatever professional (as my posts to this list over the years will
confirm), but I'm working on getting OpenOffice.org into a state agency to
solve an expensive problem. See the archives of plug-government for the
message I posted there yesterday.

  Oops! Wrong format mentioned in my message. I have used the GIMP to
convert .tif, too, and the .png is smaller. The GIMP may compress it by
default; I don't recall off-hand.

I want to use Image Magick so I can easily script the conversion of many
images.  I figured out what I needed:

convert -sample 50% image.tiff image.png

Thanks everyone,

Matt,

I'm not sure about the issues with file sizes in relation to converting from 
tiff to png.  However, I use ImageMagick to create smaller versions of the 
images that I take off of my digital camera.  I can't tell you what the 
"resize" option does since I haven't used it (from the command line anyway) 
but I can tell you that the "geometry" option should do what you're wanting, 
without causing the file sizes to balloon.  To create a file that is 50% 
smaller in both dimensions, use a command like

convert -geometry 50%x50% image.png image-50.png

or

convert -geometry 50%x50% image.tiff image-50.png

if you're wanting to skip the intermediate step.

As Paul pointed out in another response, you can control the file sizes to 
some extent using the "quality" option, which only pertains to jpeg, miff, 
and png files.  The valid ranges for the compression levels are 0-100 for 
jpeg and png and 0-9 for miff.  See the man pages for convert and ImageMagick 
for more information.

Enjoy!

Now I can tell you what the "resize" option does since I just read the 
corresponding section of the ImageMagick man page.  The "resize" option is 
(mostly) an alias for the "geometry" option.  This, combined with the default 
quality value, which equals 75, and the fact that ImageMagick applies the 
compression appropriate to the specified file format by default, makes the 
file size issues that you described rather curious (and makes my previously 
suggested solution rather bogus -- although it works for me with jpeg files).

Oops!

I've had better luck removing the default dhcpcd and installing
"pump" instead.  This allows me to create a file "/etc/pump.conf" with a
line:

domainsearch "domain1.com domain2.com domain3.com"

And that will be your DNS search path in the /etc/resolv.conf that pump
creates.

It supposedly doesn't damage files instead disrupting the Internet by

I do know it is prolific, and that someone claiming to be my Mom wants

Message-ID: <1061520672.13445.5.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

Is this option available now?  I ran into something by David Mandel on
the topic where evidently a discussion on bringing Mapinfo to Linux
hung on cost, $500,000 evidently to do a port.  The claim against
porting the popular software is that Windows NT is too entrenched
and there isn't enough market to warrant spending the money.

Is MapXtreme comparable to Mapinfo?  Is there any way to work with
Arcview data under Linux?  With so many places standardized on Arcview
and Mapinfo what can be done in Linux environments?

This is a possible area other than video games to do some programming
for Linux ;-)  Is there any open format for GIS that Mapinfo and 
Arcview can export to?  Is any alternative that works in Linux capable
of providing the Mapinfo feel and functionality?

Just some thoughts.

Helper app that runs linux compliant vbscript imbedded in html as root?
You have such a thing? Why?

Evolution didn't know what to do with the vbscript, so it kept it as an
attachment.

-resize usually increases the number of colors, because it tries
to make a 'faithful' representation of the original.  More colors
usually makes the file size larger.  You can choose the resize
algorithm with the -filter option.  You can reduce the number of
colors with the -colors option.

-sample just throws away pixels, which is easy and fast but
doesn't usually look as good.

A combination of -resize and -colors might get you better-looking
results than -sample, without being much larger in file size.

its free from the specific particulars of this problem, but not this
_sort_ of problem.

evolution (and pine, mutt, procmail, _mozilla_, etc) operates on
external data just as microsoft's software does.  There are undoubtedly
bugs in this parsing and presentation.  All it would take is for someone
to find the right bug and craft incoming data to tickle it into taking
control over the app.  A so exploited evo could just as easily fire off
similarly exploitive messages to every email address it can get its
little hands on.

The only thing that has saved unix user apps from this kind of abuse is
their vanishing share of the userbase.  people have done similar tricks
with pine for example, but that doesn't get you on the evening news.

We all connect via the Internet.  The last count I heard there was 
1,000,000+ computers infected and spewing messages with 1,000,000+ users 
saying holy s**t, I need a virus database update.  Touch of traffic there.

A runor I head last night mentioned a router ping attack also.

It seems more prolific than anything else I've seen lately.  Maybe I'm
just in more address books now - I dunno.

My mother has been getting one every twenty minutes in her inbox.  I get
about 20 mailer-daemon emails in my AOL box - those are the ones from
people infected with the virus with me and others in their address book,
and I get the emails (20 a day or so) for only those which have my
address spoofed in the FROM header and the TO header to some
non-existent name.

I let my amavis log file get away from me (111MB in size today) so I'm
having difficulty parsing it to see what kind of things have been
hitting my server, I'll work on that later and have a look-see.

To get infected, in Windoze, you have to be running OE with all the
'execute everything you can then just view an infected email...

Just grep'd for reject in my maillogs... they've been lower this week
than the week before last.

Rob

Well, as I said on spamcop.geeks, the only long term solution is for
folks to get out there and help us wipe bad security models, such as
implimented in Windows, off the technological landscape.

Don't take my word for this since I know RH has a tendancy to
obfuscate configs and force you to use horrible clicky config tools
instead of just editing the file straightforward, but check in
/etc/dhclient.conf and add a supersede line for domain-name.

Yes, but anybody else find it ironic that you need non-free software
to listen to streams in a non-free codec to listen to the hearings
which are a cornerstone of our supposedly free democracy?

I guess the IBM eServer xSeries ads don't count, or rather count as

This is a repeat mistake from the first time around.  Why not let the

 I use procmail and formail to handle attachments and
look at the MSG /w attachments in midnight commander.
In win32 I have used Pegasus email since 1995 and that
is a great program that doesn't automatically run M$ scripts.

But since I'm not running Windows it's only an annoyance and not a

There are plenty of decent scientific analyses of Sobig-F on the net,
and they're better sources of real data that I am. Still, I have some
anecdotal[1] evidence from work that suggests that it's a particularly
prolific little bugger. Here's a list of the top five viruses we've
intercepted at our mail gateway so far in the third quarter of 2003:

  11580 W32/Sobig-F
    509 W32/Sobig-E
    506 W32/Mimail-A
    182 W32/Klez-H
     19 W32/Bugbear-B

Percentage-wise, Sobig-F is off the charts, outrunning its nearest
rival by well over 2000% -- and it's not done yet. By Sept. 10, when
Sobig-F is supposedly set to turn itself off, I expect we'll have
intercepted over 25,000 copies of this thing. No other worm/virus
comes close.

Until Sobig-G, of course, which will likely be even "better" than its
-F-in' cousin.

is there one of theses per user, or do I need to put a variable in the

I'd sure appreciate seeing a demo sometime.  I've tried to get
something "gratifying" out of GRASS several times, but none
successfully.  [ObJoke] Maybe what I need is a DEM of a nice pelvis.

I think a demo would help me figure out WTF it is supposed to do and

  GRASS (Geographic Resource Analysis and Support System) is a GIS and image
analysis system. Most of the modules operate on raster (grid) data, but the
support for vector data is getting better. There are approximately 350
modules, but the major strength remains spatial analyses. Cartographic map
production has been a low priority. It started life in the early 1980s as
the Fort Hood (Texas) Environmental Information System and was taken over by
the Army Corps of Engineers' Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL) at
the University of Illinois. A couple of years ago CERL dropped the project
and the copyright and project management was taken over by Baylor
University.

Just got off the phone with State Sen Bruce Starr.  He's all for the Open 
Source bill, but he doesn't think it's going to get too far this session 
(they're frantically trying to get out of Salem by Labor Day).

He said that this bill needs to be managed better so it will pass next 
session - said something about the speaker (Minnis) getting spammed by 
supporters which made her angry to the point that she won't support it at 
all this session no matter what. (and of course he mentioned Microsoft 
lobbyists wielding influence).

...of course, if the supporters were not being impolite then it's hard to 
understand why she wouldn't want to hear from her constituents (those 
pesky constituents!)

It depends on the KVM switch. Some KVMs support wheel mice some don't. Some support opticals, some don't. If it supports an optical, then it should support a wheel. You would have to read up on the KVM's specs to be sure either way. As to AT keyboard, you should be able to make this work with an adapter (I have done it with a ConnectPRO MasterIT KVM switch with out any special voodoo).

This advisory just came across my desk at work:
(Extra corp-security speak left in for entertainment value)
Note that 1900 UTC is Noon local time.


   SUBJECT:
Sobig.F Set to Update 1900 UTC

   SUMMARY:
The Sobig.F worm will update to remote servers starting 1900 UTC today.
What code will be downloaded has not been determined.  This behavior
has been reported by major antivirus vendors: F-Secure, TrendMicro,
Symantec and Sophos.  Infected computers are using NTP to synchronize
the activation to start exactly at the same time around the world: at
19:00:00 UTC.  The worm starts the download attempt by sending a probe to
port 8998/udp of the master server. Then, the server replies with a URL,
where the worm can download the file to execute.


   RECOMMENDATIONS:
Block inbound traffic on ports 99x/udp.  Block outbound traffic on port
8998/udp.  Monitor NTP requests (port 123/udp), as these could be coming
from infected computers. (The frequency of such checks for an infected
computer should be once per hour.)

Update your antivirus software's definitions immediately.  If possible
configure your antivirus software to update and scan automatically every
day.  Gateway mailservers should be filtering for possibly malicious .vbs,
.bat, .com, .exe, .scr or .pif files, and .zip files containing these
attachments.  Filtering on subject line may affect legitimate traffic,
and it is in any case easy for the virus creator to vary these fields.
Ensure that network shares are protected with strong passwords and
disable any unneeded services.

Do not open or execute files from untrusted sources.  Scan all downloaded
.com, .exe, .scr or .pif files with updated antivirus software.

Users who know not to run .exe files are continuing to run unknown
screensavers. They should be educated to the fact that these files,
.pif files and .zip files are executables too, equally as dangerous as
.exe files.  The contents of zip files should always be examined (e.g. by
right-clicking and choosing "Open with Winzip") before extracting.

There is one .procmailrc per user, and "myuser" would be your username,
assuming that you use /home/<username>/bin as the location for the example
spamassassin.sh script mentioned in my earlier E-mail.

/home/<username>/mail/sa-caught is a mailbox in my Pine "mail" directory
that gets all the spam.  This gets reviewed and cleaned out periodically
so I don't have to worry about mail being accidently lost.  Your spam-box
location is likely to be different, depending on where your mail client
stores its mailboxes.

The one piece that was missing from my E-mail is how to run procmail-- I
do that via a ".forward" file, but there are other methods.  (See the
procmail docs for details if you want.)  My ".forward" file is:

"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail || exit 75"

The quotes are included in the file.  This runs procmail, which reads the
.procmailrc file and runs the shell script in that file which runs
spamassassin.  Spamassassin forwards the mail right back to myself after
it has set the X-Spam-Status header appropriately and procmail runs
again.  This time if the X-Spam-Status header is "Yes" procmail files the
mail into "sa-caught", and if not, it delivers it normally to my inbox.

It's a bit convoluted, but it works.  Most of the time.  ;-)

This is all set up per user.  There may be a way to set it up globally,
but I haven't needed to do that.

Thanks Rich.  I'd gotten that far.  

What I really want to see is demo of taking some useful, available
data like a USGS DEM, and doing something interesting and cool with
it, like visualizing a topography.  I've seen some really cool screen
shots, but have no idea how to reproduce them.  Such a demo would give
me a clue about operational details.

If your wallet can take the hit there is a very excellent book out now.  
Translated from German but very few 'odd' sentences.  It is available from 
folks that bring you www.freegis.org (got it right this time) and several 
on line book suppliers.  The advantage of FreeGIS is it includes a copy of 
the FreeGIS CD with GRASS, Mapserver, several other GISish programs and 
at least two sample data sets:  Spearfish, North Dakota and somewhere in 
North Carolina (memory is low and slow today).

Examples of how to do most everything that GRASS and the other programs 
do.  Good examples.
   I've been a GIS 'loyal roadie' for years just never had a job that 
required me to really learn how use the programs.  I worked cadastral 
surveys for the US Forest Service for 10+ years so I'm a little familiar 
with GIS and maps.  This book is good!

Caveat:  I ship the FreeGIS CD to North America for Intevation but not the 
book.  This explains some of my enthusiasm for what Intevation is 
doing with/for the FreeGIS CD.

You may look online for 3com Audrey. Though I don't think they produce them any more, they are readily available. One of these days I will get one to interface MisterHouse with.

Actually, this (above) is exactly what I am in the process of 
trying to figure out how to do.  I don't have a lot of time to 
pursue it, so I don't know how long (i.e., weeks/months) it's 
going to take me to figure it out.  I'll try to remember this 
discussion if I ever get there.

I've gotten to the point where I can do some cool 3D 
visualizations of the Spearfish dataset, and I'm pretty confident 
that I can make my viewpoint and angle of view exactly as I want 
them (but I haven't tried it yet -- is that like saying I've used 
GRASS but didn't inhale?).  

My next step will be to figure out how to import USGS DEMs and 
DLGs into GRASS.  It's prob'ly out there somewhere, I just 
haven't had time to look for it and try it.  Keep me posted, and 
I'll keep you posted.

Checking my map, the exit to take from I-405 is Exit #5 (State Route 900) --
NOT Exit #4 as indicated below.  It is actually called Park Drive at the
point of the exit, merging into Sunset Drive up the hill aways.  Coming from
the south, you can bail at Exit #4 if you like, but the intersection there
is a real mess.

Sorry for the incremental confusion.

KM

-------------------------------

Traveling east on Sunset Blvd from I-405, it's a RIGHT turn onto Hoquiam
Street (not a left, as in previous directions).  In fact, if you plan a left
turn, you should be driving a Hummer, since there is no roadway in that
direction.

Further info:

When leaving I-405, you are on Sunset Blvd.

Hoquiam St. is approximately 2.6 miles from the intersection of Sunset Blvd.
and I-405.

Duvall St. is a major intersection immediately preceding Hoquiam St.  There
is a traffic light at that intersection.

Note the sign to Hazen High School at the Hoquiam St. intersection.

This works, but I try not to have too many aliases to sort out.

This is what I've done (so I have a large /etc/hosts file); but it
runs into a snag when nsa.gov has reason to change their IP.num.ber.
This particular snag bytes me just often enough to really annoy me.

-----

Someone suggested sometime ago that there was a way to add a conf file
to /etc/ssh or ~/.ssh that allows an acceptable solution to both these
problems, but I haven't sorted it out yet. I think I saw a HowTo once
on this topic too, but other issues seem to have precidence.

Right, I'm not the target audience, but that does not eliminate me as 
a person who can see the effect on the target audience.  The target 
audience was the senators, who were considering why this 
exactly-worded bill should be made a law, and not considering the 
larger issues of closed v. open source, etc.  The only person to 
substantively bring the concept of "why is this being made a law" up 
was the opposition, and there was no prior discussion of that exact 
phrasing or reasons given by the supporters.  The opposition also 
brought focus upon the possible perception that the supporters were 
advocating one way of software design over the other, which is also 
not the point of the legislation, and there was too much advocacy in 
the supporters (which is understandable) for the larger issues of why 
open source is better, cheaper, etc.  Those points were not, as best 
as I am able to tell, what the legislators should be considering in 
the decision to make this a legal requirement in the State of 
Oregon's decision process for IT purchases.

The supporters were very well-worded in their descriptions of why 
open source is a better idea for software development.  They 
championed that point exceedingly accurately.  That was not the 
question, though, and they missed the concepts that would stick in 
the heads of the Senators at the time when a decision needs to be 
made about enacting of a law.

And yes, I am quite a supporter of the bill, and would have been 
there to speak if I had known earlier that it was that morning.  It 
directly effects my work, and I am frustrated that it appears (from 
comments elsewhere) that this version will also die without seeing 
approval.  As it was, I learned about it the prior evening from the 
PLUG list and was unable to make it to session due to time 
constraints, but was able to watch on cable.

As I said, that may not have been their choice.  I am unfamiliar with 
what version of the RRoO the Senate uses, but it does make sense that 
status quo gets last word.

Hopefully this experience will be material for future debates.  Is 
anyone aware of a nationwide mailing list or repository for activists 
pushing for this type of legislation?

I need to put a modem on one of my linux boxes so I can
use a dialup ISP account to hit my systems from the outside.
I'm running RedHat-9 if that makes a difference.
The RedHat site doesn't give much help and googling hasn't
turned up much either.
Sooooo... I'd like to know what modems people are using
(preferably 56K) curerntly.

Everyone brought up this point. From the position of the Senator, the 
reason "why is this being made a law" was in order to save tax payer 
dollars. These Senators just killed eachother over the budget and passed 
"the largest tax increase in Oregon history" according to a distraught 
Republican Representative whom shall remain nameless.

We hit them with dollar arguments. Senator Corcoran hit Craven with it. 
Money. Pay attention to the dollar:

Software - You don't pay anything
Hardware - Use older equipment = save money
Human Resources - Keep the same budget but use your training budget to 
transition over to Open Source. Result: same money

This bill may yet pass, there are some pissed of Republicans down there. 
When asked point blank (by me) "So I assume that if you got SB941 over 
in the house you'd be inclined to support a bill that forced government 
to consider using software that doesn't cost anything in addition to 
considering expensive proprietary software, you'd support it" He just 
scowled at me and left Ken Barber, the bill's author, to say that the 
guy had supported it the first time through.

The Fat Lady has yet to sing...

 Do you have a ISA port on your computer? If not then
you need to find a PCI hardware modem, not the win-modems
that sell for $25. If you have a external serial port
connector you can usually buy a external 56k modem off of ebay
for $20. There are USB 56k modems, but I have no experience
with them and I don't know if they are win-modems also.

  I have been involved in the lobbying for a few bills over the past decade
and I've provided testimony at both Senate and House hearings. While my role
has been limited to providing scientific expertise on the issues, I know of
the work done by the professionals in support of or opposition to a
particular bill.

  A very important point was made to me as I sat waiting to testify at a
Senate committee this past April. One of the lobbiests leaned over to me and
said, "Most people don't realize that the real work is all done in advance,
before the hearings are held. Decisions are made before the hearing and the
latter are just for show."

  I know this well from the idea that I had before the 2001 legislative
session. I -- and others -- spoke with legislators from both sides of the
Capitol and from both parties until we had a couple of solid sponsors and a
lot of support lined up. By the time of the hearings the votes were counted
and there were enough to pass the bill into law. It became law July 1, 2001.
To my great surprise, at least one state agency has entered rule making to
implement the statute -- without being sued and forced to do so!

  My point is to take the lessons learned this session and, if you are
convinced that the ORS (Oregon Revised Statutes) need to explicitly include
this provision, wait a few weeks after the session ends then start building
support for the 2005 session. You have two years to make a compelling case
that legislators can support with confidence.

John,

I am not a professional lobbyist. I made the efforts that I did simply
because I felt that I owe a lot to the dedicated software developers;
those tireless souls who have made it possible for me to deliver a
quality IT system at what I consider to be an exceptional value.

I understand your concerns regarding our testimony. Perhaps we could
have been clearer. I am reminded that I did not included in my notes the
"$38 billion marketing potential" argument (one that is absolutely true)
that I had meant too.  

Please too understand that we walked into this as complete amateurs and
walked out with not one but two hearings on the subject. Given that most
bills aren't granted even one hearing, I think we did exceptionally
well.

Take heart. In 2005, our job will be much easier as it is becoming clear
that professional lobbying organizations supporting open-source software
are forming. I will continue to work on this issue during the interim
and will have prepared for the next session.

That way, the professionals testifying will have the information they
need to make the most effective presentation possible.


Sincerely,


Cooper Stevenson

I can heartily recommend the USR Courier external modems.  Getting an
external helps ensure that you don't get a WinModem by accident.

The only gotcha is to try to get one that has been flash upgraded to one
of the 56k protocols.  Older models may top out at 33.6k.

Typical republican.  When is Minnis up for re-election?  She's now my

Might look into Micros terminals.  I don't think they're local, but if
you want to see just what kind of abuse they can withstand, go to the
Oregon Zoo and hit the gift shops and restaurants.  All the terminals
used by the retail and gate staff, as well as the terminals in the
Cascade Grill are made by Micros.  Retail and admitting are pretty
easy on the terminals, but foodservice absolutely punishes their
hardware.

They're designed to be POS terminals, but they appear to be a
touchscreen X terminal; cash drawer and customer display are optional,
so I would assume they could be used by themselves as well.

Right on.  Too bad the legislature would rather ignore the people and
go home than take a look at this.  I'm not normally a one-issue voter,
but this might do it for me.

Message-ID: <1061618046.22599.8.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

For an nfs-root environment I want to reconfigure Redhat 7.3 to do zero
logging.  I've disabled syslog and commented out all lines in
syslog.conf under /etc but I'm still getting boot.log, wtmp, 
ksyms.0, ksyms.1, and ksyms.2.  

According to icewalkers.com I need to disable all local disk checks,
remount the root partition read/write, mount a swap partition 
over nfs, and start portmapper first.  Do I need to have nfs-utils
installed?  How do I remove any automounting and disable any 
automount daemon?  What is the kernel daemon and how do I ensure
that all nfs mounts are up before it starts?

How do you disable the md recovery thread if yuor not doing any raid

I'm getting an error getgrnam failed.  I deleted everything under /var/log,
maybe one of these files needs to exist for things to work right?

I gaurantee any functional, external serial modem will work without
any grief.  USB modems don't count to me, and Winmodems are
essentially glorified sound cards, as are external modems made by
Conexant or Agere Systems.  USRobotics Courier external modems (widely
considered top of the line) of any speed are so darn cheap there's
really excuse not to use a decent, real modem.

I'm with Rick on the whole modem issue:

That's probably not the best idea.  I would recommend making one
machine the designated log collector and set it up to allow log
entries from all your NFS hosts, and set your NFS hosts to send log
entries to your log collector.  syslogd is network capable and is
usually fairly light on bandwidth.

Though if you *really* don't want to log, why not uninstall syslog?

Well, the Senate doesn't use Robert's Rules of Order, it uses 
something called "Senate Rules."  It would have been nice if you 
could have educated yourself on their protocol before criticizing 
us....

A few have been announced but I'm not convinced that any of them 
have traction.  There IS a brand-new lobbying group (yeah, PAID 
professional open-source lobbyists!) that was announced at 
Linuxworld two weeks ago.  They work mostly at the national 
level, but they did submit written testimony to our hearing.  
They are the Open Source And Industry Alliance (OSAIA) and their 
web site lives here:

And what's the alternative?  The democrats have lost their soul.
Just look at Kulongoski's pro abortion stand which is so radical
that he's has to be at a party.  He's worse than someone who's

Where are all the Microsoft techies going to go?  Employed people are
constituents, especially in a flat economy.  Linux works so well that
it could reduce the number of jobs needed at a time when already there
aren't enough jobs in the high tech sector.  There's no training budget
right now to teach Microsoft techs Linux.  Face it, most of the cuts
have been to education.  I think there is broad support for the bill.
Unfortunately, goliath is so large that toppling him now will cause a 
lot of damage.  What is needed is a school funding bill, and the taxes
needed to be lowered back to normal.  The only way to create revenue
is to create jobs.  Maybe Linux needs to grow more while Microsoft is
still big stuff.  A transition is needed before a major change.
This was as true with Jefferson's difficulties releasing his slaves as
it is today.

The arguments for this bill need to address the job displacement issue. 
Why is open source better than closed, and don't argue savings.
Why shouldn't the legislature favor competition between multiple closed
source companies instead?  Nobody wants to be accused of destroying
jobs.  The education cuts have been bad enough, the health care cuts
we've seen are even worse.  The state is responsible for some people
dying because of the budget problems and cuts to health care.

Linux doesn't need as many admins.  What will the Microsoft admins that
aren't needed going to train into?  How about all these guys like me on

Maybe so, but if slavery _had_ been outlawed at the beginning we wouldn't 
have had to have a civil war.

The main issue (for me anyway) is open file formats.  It's not right 
that a government relies on closed file formats (Word docs).  Data should 
be freely available and readable on all platforms.  Otherwise they're 
playing favorites.

So we should continue to use an inferior, closed system which is prone 
to all manner of viruses and worms in order to 
preserve jobs?  I suppose it's similar to the same reason why we can't 
pump our own gas in Oregon - it's for job protection (essentially it's a 
welfare program).  Aren't you proposing maintaining the status-quo as a 
welfare system for state IT workers?  Why don't we just build a baseball 
stadium to provide jobs (oh, wait that's already been proposed) or why not 
just build roads and bridges from inferior materials so we have to rebuild 
them every few years... Oh, wait...

  So I'm not the only one who wonders how we are going to make money on 
  baseball.  Just because we need to go to a better system and respond to
  the corrections this recession demands doesn't mean we ignore the
  difficulties people are going to have.  How do you get the Linux     
  training started on the current budget anyways?  Aren't all these
  guys doing Windows support or is a little restructuring in order?
  Considering the weather in Oregon it doesn't hurt that someone
  pumps your gas.

Um, use some imagination and track down useful projects that improve the

Hello everyone.

	I have a strange question. Several times on different computers, I have
had occasional occurences where X would crash when switching from an X
session to a different virtual terminal. It's pretty random and happens
with my wife's Red Hat (9), my Red Hat (8) at work and Gentoo on my
laptop.

	Does anyone else have this problem? Anyone know where to look for the
cause and a solution?

When I first read Don's message back in February, I too, was bothered by
the rhn agreement.  Today I had another look at the agreement, and it
appears that they have made it more acceptable.


    6. Term of this Agreement and Modification of Services.

    ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTIONS. For annual subscriptions to the Service, the
    initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and
    shall continue for one (1) year. Thereafter, the term shall renew for

Try 1, $s/\.$//  The "g" is unnecessary as you are only getting rid of
the last period in each line.

There are now two fairly active "third parties" in Oregon:  the 
Greens (technically the Pacific Green Party) and the 
Libertarians.

The latter is widely perceived to have kept the R's out of the 
Governor's Mansion in last year's election, and they further 
claim to have swung a number of state Senate races (four, if I 
remember correctly) last year -- shifting control of the state 
Senate from Republicans to a fifty-fifty split.

And it was the Greens, of course, who cost Al Gore the White House 
in 2000.  Yeah, complain about W all you want, but if Ralph Nader 
hadn't been in the race W wouldn't have stood a chance!  

So you might have three or four choices on your State 
Representative ballot next year instead of the traditional two.

Whether any of them run candidates in Minnis' district is anyone's 
guess, but after this week's tax increase I'll bet the L's are 
looking for credible candidates to run against all sorts of GOP 
incumbents next year.

9?

I don't believe you need the g

since the end of the line only occurs once for each line.

There are more than two parties.  Anybody capable of reading the
Oregon Voter's Guide knows this and that a third party would
occasionally win if the voters themselves voted their conscious
instead of upholding status quo.

Support the fire marshall's ban on self-serve gas.  That'll put MCSE's

Because it wastes resources and mandates higher revenues to deal with

Fire Marshall order prevents it, and I think the DEQ has something to
say about it as well.  Not that it matters much, with exception of
right along the Washington state line where there's local price fixing
to give the illusion we're more expensive, we usually run cheaper than
the other pacific states.  And our gas stations are cleaner and don't
knock you over from the fumes because the people pumping know what
they're doing.

I hope that fails miserably, or someone challenges building a stadium
in court.  Player taxes aren't going to even come close to covering
the interest of the cost of another stadium, much less pay for
itself.  The Expos haven't sold more than 5000 seats a game in years
now, and hardly anybody on that team can hit.  The Portland Beavers
are a much better team and consistantly come close to selling out the
20000 seat Civic Stadium.  So why spend all this money for a 50,000
seat stadium on a shitty team that should really shipped in it's
entirety back to single-A?

TSA fired all the extra help.  Portland Airport now has slightly less
security than before 9/11, but at least the officers are getting a
real wage for dangerous shitwork now.  One guy who I used to work with
left for the TSA and they told him "Move to Anchorage or lose your
job.  We won't pay for relocation."

I really wish you idiots wouldn't try to discuss politics outside of
Linux and Open Source/Free Software issues here anyway.  We have

You'll never get an open source bill passed in a Republican 
legislature without arguing savings.  It all has to do with 
something we call "spin."

Gripe all you want, but nothing in the political arena ever gets 
done without spin, and Barnhart and I both knew from the outset 
that the only way an open source bill would get any traction at 
all would be to "spin" it as a money-saving measure.

We on this list know all kinds of logical, sensible and rational 
reasons why Governments should use software that employs open 
standards, but none of those arguments work in the political 
arena.  To get an idea passed, you must frame it in a way that 
gets the attention of the people in power -- i.e., present it in 
a way that appeals to their ideology.

Since Republicans control the House this session, that meant 
selling the bill as a way to save the taxpayers money.  Had 
Democrats been in control we would have chosen a different spin.

> Nobody wants to be accused of destroying jobs.  

That's why we kept very, VERY quiet about this consequence of the 
bill.  I expected our opposition to figure it out and hammer us 
with it, but they are so blinded by their own FUD (M$-funded 
studies claiming that FOSS has a higher TCO) that they never even 
thought of it.

Call me evil if you want, but the unfortunate reality is that THIS 
is how politics works.

I don't think anybody would lose their job over this bill, there might
be a few jobs that don't get created, and some people might have to get
a little training.  This is because we are not talking about going in
and replacing systems that are currently in place.  This would only
effect new systems and upgrades.  New systems are new hires, so maybe
they don't hire as many new people.  Upgrades take time and there would
be training anyway, attrition would generaly take care of the lowered
head count.

It may be that they did think of it, but did not dare admit that their
FUD was false.

Message-ID: <5214.68.96.48.205.1061700979.squirrel@webmail.pdxlug.org>

I have an account on a remote box that I SSH into to check mail.  This
remote box does not have IMAP or POP available and all incoming ports
except 22, 25, and 80 are blocked.  So I'd like to setup an IMAP server to
run on a port >1024 and have a webmail package, such as SquirrelMail,
retrieve the mail for me for the times when I can't SSH in.  The remote
box runs Sendmail, so I don't think I can use the Courier IMAP server.  I
haven't had any luck so far configuring uw-imap to run on a higher port
either.  I modifed the source code to use port 1143, but I couldn't get
the server to start.  Any suggestions?
Thanks,

Lighten up Ken, nobody calls you evil; we only call you unfortunate.
This IS the way that politics works but not the way that open-source
works (catch a clue, we are better than this bullshit). If you really
want to change something, work toward changing politics. There's your
challenge, one that we all know you will excel at - we do have faith in
you and we all appreciate what your trying to do (but the end does not
justify the means).

Lately I've been noticing slow connection speeds (I still have a dial-up 
connection) AND slow connections on my internal network.

I looked at /proc/pci and noticed that both the modem and ethernet on the 
machine that dials in and does IP masquerading were both on IRQ 11.  This 
seems to be a problem, and I suspect it is the source of the slow 
connections and network problems.  So how can I force one or the other of 
them to use a different IRQ?  (the ethernet controller is on the 
motherboard of this machine, but the modem is a USR PCI card)

...OR is this the problem, can the IRQ be shared between them peacefully?

Does your X log file show any kind of info on it?  What versions of X
are you running on there?  What WM/DM are you running?

Is it really totally random or are you always running some app when this
happens?

I would like to think your log files have *some* info on it...

David's absolutely right. When IT staff are freed from the Sisyphean task of 
keeping winduhs "working", that releases money and resources for other 
projects. Instead of being in repair mode all the time, it is possible to 
move forward, and to make improvements. Buy new hardware, do major upgrades 
and overhauls, work on user interfaces, wireless, better security, user 
training.... there's all kinds of good things you can do when you're not in 
constant crisis mode.

And believe it or not, windows admins can learn Linux. It's a lot shorter leap 
than training former loggers and fishermen to 'do computers.'

You first. It's hard enough getting the Legislature to pay attention to a 
piece of proposed legislation, let alone "change politics". The folks behind 
this bill have done a tremendous job. Perhaps your contribution could be 
changing politics?

Ken is talking common sense- you have to reach people at their level, and 
couch your message in terms that make sense to them. This is true of all 
people, including you and me and everyone on this list. Did you see Cooper's 
piece on Linux Today? http://linuxtoday.com/developer/2003081800926OSLLPB

"These folk of Josephine County are fairly down to earth. When I spoke with 
many of them about TCO, peer review, etc., I quickly learned that most people 
in that area aren't concerned with that kind of thing. "Well, that's all and 
good," they would begin, "but you see, there's an antique dealer downtown who 
would really like to sell his goods online. What can open-source do for him?" 

"Okay, we're down to Earth. "Bottom line," I said, "is that open-source 
software lets the shop keeper cost-effectively hire a local consultant to put 
up a server for him on commodity hardware. Guess what: you've just increased 
the shopkeeper's revenue and given the consultant a job. The sooner your area 
gets up to speed with open-source software, the better you can compete." 

Calling it 'spin', as Ken did, puts a negative connotation to it. I wouldn't 
have said 'spin'- to me that's calling shit chocolate pudding. What Ken and 
Cooper have done is present the issue in a way that's meaningful to the 
people they're talking to. There's no deception there. The folks behind this 
bill have done an amazing job. They deserve thanks and praise- not put-downs.

Carla's absolutely right. And she used a metaphor from Greek mythology 
to make her point. So she scores double by my count.

She's right about windows admins having the capacity to learn too. Many 
of the proprietary systems out there are reasonably good at letting 
people start into the learning curve. "Ease of Use" is helpful if you 
are a beginner.

Unfortunatly, many of those systems don't pull off the other half of 
"make the easy stuff easy and the hard stuff possible". By my 
experience, Filemaker Pro was a fun way to learn about databases, 
scripting, interface design and customer requirements. Then, I began 
bumping my head against the limitations. I briefly migrated to Access 
and ColdFusion before beginning the transitioning to PostgreSQL, Perl 
and Template Toolkit.

My point is that yes, I believe we should help out with the migration of 
people who are bumping their heads on MS product limitation. 
Unfortunatly, many of them won't switch without a fight. I see no point 
in fighting. They'll figure it out eventually, and when they do, there 
will be a migration path worn in the ground for them by the people who 
went before them (and who have a head start because they figured it out 
earlier or went along without a fight).

Some cards can't handle being shared, try changing slots, it can't hurt.

Well Carla, I'm not going to get into this full-blown rant again. All I
will say is that these folks have dedicated a lot of time and energy
into this and I, for one, highly respect their effort and tenacity.
However, to use a phrase that we have heard a lot of lately, "The
Reality of the Situation is" that passing legislation to mandate
something, anything, that is already adopted by government rule, and is
already being practiced by government agencies, will only grow more
government, add more process and slow production. Would you, with clear
conscious, advocate that Oregon add more government for no other reason
but to mandate that government continues to do what government already
does?

In a nutshell, I have to agree with the opposition (as much as that
hurts me personally) when they say that the Bill is not needed. My
"lighten up" comments were just that, light hearted and not intended to
pick on Ken or anyone. Ken and I have gone a few rounds in the past but
we're both adults and in the end we do possess the ability disagree
peacefully.

How Newtonian. It's a nice clean cause and effect scenario I'll grant 
you that.

The only "something, anything" that is mandated in this bill is the 
consideration of an option. If DAS is already considering the option, my 
hat is off to them. But the politicians had damn well better assure 
themselves that they know the option is being considered and this law 
accomplishes that.

It really does, I don't dispute that at all. Did we need a supervisor to
watch the worker dig a hole? Perhaps, but it wasn't good enough so we
added a manager to make sure the supervisor was supervising. But who
watches the manager? We hired "External QA" to watch the manager. In the
end we are left with one person digging and 3 people watching.

Perhaps you're right, it may be a mistake to build systems based on our 
fears instead of our aspirations. So lets not do it that way this time

depends what you're digging for.  no sense having 4 people digging in the
wrong place... it could take a long time to get the job done that way.  of
course, everyone would feel very busy and self-important, which is good.

Thanks to all for the info. I also found an add-on for non-touch
monitors that would work at:

http://www.enablemart.com/products_detail.asp?id=329

Price isn't too bad at $179 for a unit good for a 13-15" monitor. And,
they have a Linux driver. The downside is that any ordinary monitor,
tube or lcd, takes up too much room on the counter top, or is too tall
to fit under the wall cabinets.

So, I'll probably give Audrey a try. My wife thinks she can live with
the 6 1/4" by 4 3/4" screen, and it better fits the current budget.

HI All.
Okay, well my version of OpenOffice won't open without Java and my
dwnld of j2sdk is corrupt. So it goes to the back burner till next
week.
IN the mean time, I'd like to install samba from a tar file,
installing it so that more than one user can use it.
Where is a good source of information on how to do the install and
make it so that multi-users can use this samba?

I'm mostly at a loss as to WHERE to install it.Of course making it
available to all users means I need to know how to set it up for them
as well.

Same with Apache. If I get the first done, I'll try the second.

Thanks in advance,

 Unless you are downloading the binaries then just read the INSTALL,
README and files in the doc/ dir. There is a Samba HOW-TO that will
give you enough information.
Also your version of Agent has a memory leak and you should Upgrade

Sorry, but that is NOT what government does. What mid-to-upper level 
managers in government (and in much industry, too) is go with what they 
know. They can reject Open Source out of hand because "there isn't any 
such package to do what we need." And they don't have time to do 
research to find anything that isn't there, right?

They *won't* do the research into the alternatives unless they *have* to.

Not because they are lazy, but because the simpletons running the 
legislature (not to put too fine a point on it) can't figure out that if 
you try to maintain the infrastructure by overworking the poor schmoes 
who are trying to keep it all together, someday it will all fall apart.

This is going into a political vein and so I will say this one time and 
will then back off. I will not respond to any further posts on this -- 
I'm just making my point because this political agenda always seem to be 
able to sneak into almost every discussion except the purely technical ones.

That said:

Libertarianism is as every bit as much a failed experiment as State 
Centralized Socialism that was found in the old Soviet Union. One 
extreme of deregulation of everything without doing something about the 
monopoly of greed is just as bad as sitting in Moscow trying to plan out 
how many shoes to produce for the next five years in Uzbekistan.

Oregon is in its current state is because a bunch of whacko right wing 
Republicans bought into some of what Libertarians say while leaving out 
the rest. And lets face it, many of them won't adopt the rest except at 
gunpoint. So what we get is the mess that we are in now.

I am personally an anarcho-syndicalist, so don't give me crap about 
being a commie socialist pinko hippie whatever. I just happen to believe 
that democracy is a tricky, slow-moving thing that requires a lot of 
compromise on all sides. The legislative leadership that won't 
compromise can't figure out that their One True Faith of weird-ass 
whacko Libertarian-influenced Republican ideas has screwed up the state 
without getting anyone any closer to any sort of ideal society.

And a lot of the blame for where Oregon currently is has to fall at the 
feet of the folks who constantly preach their ideology to others who 
only pick up on the part of the message that they like. And that screws 
our state up for everyone else.

There. Now that was a rant.

I will spare you in the future, but I just was fed up with listening to 
that stuff and not letting it pass because we don't (and we really 
don't) want politics to take over the PLUG list for weeks and get a lot 
of feelings hurt. But I just couldn't let it go by.

Now, having put a stick into the hornet's nest and stirred vigorously, I 
will back off and go back to lurk mode.

Bright Blessings of Peace,
Ron Braithwaite

The opposition certainly likes to make that claim.  Yes, it is 
true that ORS 291.038 talks about "rules, plans and 
specifications ... based on ... open systems" and even defines 
what "open systems" means.

But one look around the offices of the Legislature (and my 
experience at ODOT) makes it painfully obvious that ORS 291.038 
is being ignored.  The State of Oregon is NOT, by and large, 
implementing open systems so it was time to get their attention.  
One of the best ways to get their attention is to propose 
legislation.

I guarantee you that DAS is paying a lot more attention to ORS 
291.038 today than it was six months ago.

after my son signed up for a free issue of Skateboarder magazine, and

If you want to change the IRQ for the on-board NIC, it should be in the

I can't search it, for one thing. Try this:
http://www.google.com/search?as_q=spam&num=50&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&newwindow=1&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=lists.pdxlinux.org&safe=images

I'm pretty sure that the archives should have more than one instance of
the word "spam" in them. I tried other words, like "Linux, same. 

What's up with that?

Why not use spamcop.net and their RBL that keeps track of spamming
servers live?

Call me stupid, but I spent aprox. 15 minutes at spamcop.net without being
able to discover what the URL of their RBL is. (I don't think it's
'bl.spamcop.net'; that doesn't resolve.)

It is bl.spamcop.net. That part is hard to find, but it's here:

Yes, it is bl.spamcop.net.  It's a zone, not a host, of course it's
not going to resolve.

Hi, Ishmial!

  Try it again: reject_rbl_client bl.spamcop.net is what I have in
/etc/postfix/main.cf and it works just fine.

  For those who'd apprciate the entire list of RBLs checked here, it is:

	reject_rbl_client relays.ordb.org,
        reject_rbl_client china.blackholes.us,
        reject_rbl_client taiwan.blackholes.us,
        reject_rbl_client japan.blackholes.us,
        reject_rbl_client korea.blackholes.us,
        reject_rbl_client n_i_geria.blackholes.us, // underscores to allow
the message out :-)
        reject_rbl_client argentina.blackholes.us,
        reject_rbl_client brazil.blackholes.us,
        reject_rbl_client thailand.blackholes.us,
        reject_rbl_client russia.blackholes.us,
        reject_rbl_client bl.spamcop.net,
        reject_rbl_client list.dsbl.org,
        reject_rbl_client blackholes.easynet.nl

  I also have 237 specific domain names and 1673 IP addresses I reject.

  This weekend set a 'personal best' and second for percentage of rejected
messages, thanks to the latest Microsoft virus: 70% on Saturday and 66%
yesterday.

I had a similar problem that I traced to the text-based mouse system (gpm)
holding onto the mouse when I switched back to X.  Usually it was because
I'd bumped the desk so the mouse was moving just as I switched back.

The X logs showed an error related to "can't grab pointer" or something
along those lines.

I solved it by removing gpm.

There is no VBScript or HTML in Sobig.  It is just a Windows executable 
marked as a .pif file.  It doesn't even use any of the Outlook bugs to 
change the displayed type or to automatically run the attachment.  It 
relies completely on users running the attachment.

Message-ID: <Sea2-F55AjEOr060si600019f53@hotmail.com>

Dear All:

I just upgraded my Linux box from RH 7.1 to RH 9.  Everything is great.
Except that the size of the X desktop does not quite consume my entire
monitor screen.  So I adjust the horizontal and vertical sizing using the 
buttons
on my monitor.  It would work just fine until when I logout and log back in
or when the screen returns from the screen saver.    So I almost have to
adjust the screen size on a daily basis.

I never had this problem before.  I usually adjust it for once and that is 
it.

Am I missing something?

thanks

Vincent,

Under the "Monitor" section in your XF86Config file there may be an
entry that says "DisplaySize  360        270". If you see that try
editing it, otherwise you should try adding that and see what happens.

Primarily because spamcop.net is a bit too aggressive, imho.  Common example
is we have a number of people on qwest ip space on the PLUG mailing list,
and messages from them will get marked as likely SPAM.

I think this is a bogus argument.  I can tell you what people will do:
they'll start *adding* capabilities to systems rather than spending all
their time keeping a b0rken system limping along.

Hm.  I don't recall whose budget trained me to use Linux.  It might have
been my own initiative or something odd like that.  If some MS techs
can't transition, they can pump gas for those that can.

I'm sorry, I just don't agree.  You make it sound as if any transition
for the entire state would happen overnight leaving thousands
unemployed.  I can assure you that *if* the bill ever gets passed, it
will be several years before MS is unrooted from state IT centers. 
Those MS techies will have plenty of time to familiarize themselves with
OSS.

No it isn't.  Any technology transition will be gradual.  Anyone with
any real capability will be able to struggle through the learning curve
and continue to do their job.  If they can't then they probably weren't
doing a good job anyway.

There is no issue.

That's just silly.  Explain to me why we need to control pollution but
don't argue breathing.

Anyway, I'll tell you why: because *my* tax dollars pay for it.  Because
public information needs to be stored in non-proprietary formats. 
Because public officials need to *not* agree to EULA's that grant
companies the right to forage through their system when that system
contains confidential citizen information.  Because state agencies need
to not be forced into upgrading systems in order to communicate with
each other.

I still don't see the validity of this argument.  Please substantiate it
before I'll address it further.

You probably need a barcode font.  Google will find you a bunch of them.

Absolutely.  The more likely scenario, IMO, is that the reduced IT
spending on software would increase the amount available to hire staff.

I'll concede that switching to OSS might impact jobs in Washington. 
However, we are concerned about jobs in *Oregon* and I suggest using
some of the present IT budget to hire *Oregonians* rather than mailing
the check off to Redmond.

The Linux way seems to be teach yourself and do the work 
because it pays off for what your doing in the long haul.
The Microsoft approach to software is quick and dirty. 
Because Microsoft is a monopoly that has to produce a 
more complex operating environment now, this approach 
has led to a lot of problems.  

The research approach is fine for academic environments 
if a student's broader goals for the research are time 
limited or the student is paid to do research.  For the 
manager who says get me three proprosals and I'll pick 
one, how can a Linux specialist become properly prepared?  

I would guess you need to be able to provide a canned 
solution in a culture that calls for individual 
research.  

One problem is that a lot of solutions already exist under 
Linux for a lot of problems, but these solutions lay 
undiscovered because there's no roadmap to them.

Another major point that has come up in the discussions
is that it is not cost effective to open source all Windows
software because the software comes from so many sources 
under so many different licenses.  Will Linux have an 
advantage over Windows because all operating level 
libraries and functions are open source?  The only 
part of Linux to my knowledge that has to be open 
is the kernel, though, if I understand correctly, 
you can take the same kernel and create a multitude 
of different systems each requiring different training
to support them.

There is Linux standards base, but is there the 
scientific research saying that this effort and  
other similar efforts are enough?  Even with the
source code in hand, understanding the tradition 
behind it speeds up accurately interpreting what's 
there.  If the current standardization and
teaching efforts aren't enough, what has 
to be done?  What can be done?

What is to be done about computer science deans 
who take bribes for millions of dollars to build 
Windows labs?  I got it so bad when I was 
starting my college career for revealing 
interest in Linux that the dean apologized 
to me afterwards.  Partially he was well meaning,
he feels his son who pursued psychology and is
making so little fell on idealism.
As a dean, he seeks to advise people to pursue
well paid careers.  He's hard, but it's his way 
of caring.

With a roadmap, the risk to become a Linux 
professional becomes more measureable.  Many
need this roadmap to better make judgements 
about where Linux can go, will go, and if 
they can go with it.

Perhaps you skipped the menu for file types

Alt-P

File types

add new
mime: application/pdf
extensions: pdf

open with application
/usr/bin/xpdf

or, did you just want it to prompt you...all those options are there though.

Well, with the legislative session winding down, any House hearing would 
have to be within the next day or two. Would you be willing to come testify?

I mean Cliff especially, but who else would be available to go to a 
hearing at an hour's notice?

Of course, if you'd like to give it a try now, well, go e-mail your 
State Reps and Senators. Have your friends do it. What the hell.

Robby,

  I want to have it offer me the option to download _or_ open it, and I want
the download to be the default. And, ... when I click on the pdf filetype
line in the dialog box, and cross my toes, it opens a dialog box in which I
can select the checkbox to "show a choice dialog box".

  Thank you, I missed that.

I suppose, if you don't mind me stuttering and turning red at the
thought of actually speaking instead of just firing off emails <wink>.

spam^H^H^H^Hemail once or twice a week :)  Well, I suppose its too late
to worry about getting more... what are we asking for?  Another

***Programming ColdFusion MX, 2nd Edition
Order Number: 3803
The first edition of this book has been called "the best reference
available on the subject." This new edition goes even further,
documenting the latest techniques for using ColdFusion MX to develop
and serve dynamic web page content. It's an exhaustive guide that
covers everything from the basics to advanced topics, with examples you
can use for your own applications. Packed with insider hints, tips, and
tricks, this book will help you make the most out of ColdFusion MX.

***.NET Framework Essentials, 3rd Edition
Order Number: 5059
Fully updated for version 1.1 of the .NET Framework, this new edition
of .NET Framework Essentials is an objective, no-nonsense overview of
.NET. It touches all the bases, from the Common Language Run-Time (CLR)
and key class libraries to the specialized packages for ASP.NET,
Windows Forms, XML web services, and data access (ADO.NET). Written for
intermediate to advanced VB, C/C++, Java, and Delphi developers, the
book is also useful to system leaders and architects who are assessing
tools for future projects.

***Programming .NET Security
Order Number: 4427
With the spread of web-enabled desktop clients and web server-based
applications, developers can no longer afford to treat security as an
afterthought. In fact, .NET forces you to address the topic since
Microsoft has placed security-related features at the core of the .NET
Framework. Even so, carelessness and lack of experience can enable a
program to be used in an unintended way. This book shows programmers
how to use .NET's various tools to write secure applications.

Safari News
================================================
***"Go On Safari" Tip of the Week Winner--Mike Caprio,
Worcester Macromedia User Group
"I'm a partner in a three person software consulting firm; simply put,
Safari is the perfect tool for my business. Our clients often have
varied needs, and they sometimes need help with the latest
technologies--if we didn't have the resource we needed to refer to in
order to help, we'd have to order a book online or drive out to the
local bookstore to browse the shelves and hope they had something we
could use. Having Safari online texts at our fingertips gives us a much
faster response time providing expertise to our clients. Now that all
the text from so many books is available and searchable, we can access
that kind of specialized technical knowledge much more quickly from a
very reliable source."

Your group can also participate in this introductory program just for
user group members. To "Go on Safari," any of your members who sign up
for our Safari 14-day free trial can send comments on their
experiences, or tips and tricks for how they used Safari  (it only
needs to be 2 sentences long, but it may be longer) to

***E-Commerce Pioneers Split on Patent Rights
In this "Associated Press" article, Tim O'Reilly talks about why he
didn't patent the idea of using advertising revenue to run a web portal
as a "business method"--a move that would have changed the course of
internet history.

***Introduction to OOP in Flash and ActionScript
One of the greatest stumbling blocks in learning object-oriented
programming is the inherent abstractness. Enter the simplicity of Flash
and ActionScript. In this first of two articles, Joey Lott offers an
introduction to basic OOP with ActionScript.

Extreme Programming (XP) is yet another popular idea gaining press. It

Whether or not you adopt XP, it's worth considering what XP teaches.

lessons you should learn from Extreme Programming.

***The Java Speech API, Part 1
Speech technology has advanced to the point where it's practical to
consider speech synthesis and speech recognition in certain
applications. In the first of two articles, Mandar Chitnis and Lakshmi
Ananthamurthy explore JSAPI, an API for accessing various speech
engines, building a simple application with speech synthesis.

.NET
---------------------
***The Factory Design Pattern
Many popular software libraries make extensive use of design patterns
so that the APIs can be abstracted out at a high level for the end
programmer. The .NET Framework Class Library (FCL) is no exception.
Given that the FCL builds on the strengths of Microsoft's experience
with developing software libraries, one can assume that instances of
design patterns found in the FCL are fairly appropriate usages of these
patterns. In this article, Amit Goel describes some instances of a
commonly occurring design pattern in the FCL: the Factory Method design
pattern.

***Outboard Brains for Mac OS X
Here's a brief look at some applications designed to be digital
brain-dumps; electronic Pensieves into which you can throw any
information you want, knowing that it will still be there when you need
it later. Giles Turnbull looks at a variety of "outboard brains"
utilities and highlights their particular strengths.
http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/08/05/outboard_brains.html

***Open Directory and Active Directory, Part 1
For the last number of months, Michael Bartosh has been working on this
series of articles for Mac DevCenter readers that examines Mac OS X's
Directory Services architecture in depth and explores how to integrate
these services with Microsoft's Active Directory.
http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/08/05/active_directory.html?CMP=NLC-J9A196900446

Perl Mongers
"The user interface of the service is fairly flexible and intuitive. My
favorite is the 'hide' tab that clears off most of the visible screen
space to let you get down to some serious reading. I also have found to
my surprise, that I may actually read some texts faster on monitor than
in hand. And while I must admit there is still something to pulling a
text down off the shelf and flipping through the pages, it is certainly
nice when I don't have to lug ten pounds of paper back and forth from
the office when I'm reading up on a particular subject or technology."

You can also participate in this introductory program just for user
group members. To "Go on Safari," any UG member who signs up for our
Safari 14-day free trial can send comments on their experiences, or

particular cases; rather, he restates an overview of these issues that

SOA (service-oriented architecture) has become a buzzword of late.
Although the concepts behind SOA have been around for over a decade
now, SOA has gained extreme popularity of late due to web services.
Before we dive in and talk about what SOA is and what are the
essentials behind SOA, it is a useful first step to look back at the
evolution of SOA. To do that, we have to simply look at the challenges
developers have faced over the past few decades and observe the
solutions that have been proposed to solve their problems.

You know, I just had a fabulous, and only slightly unethical business
idea. 

Everybody on the list who's unemployed and has a clue or three, we get
together and form a Linux Migration Consultancy. We offer to do free
consultations on the cost of a BSA-sponsored audit for your company. We
offer to help you transition to fully open source so that you no longer
need to worry about such a thing. And we offer support contracts.

What makes us different from the competition? Well, the BSA takes
anonymous tipoffs.

You may have heard, recently, a guitar-string making company was
hostiley audited by the BSA and the owner chose to change to Linux in
response to how he was treated, and says he has saved a huge amount of
money and that he has not had to make one support call.

I'm not actually serious about the unethical, but I wonder if we
couldn't make a consultancy out of all the unemployed tech-heads we've

The problem is, that would only give you the same bad face of the
Microsoft Police, just with a new attitude.  Free software is about
choice, not coercion.

I'm not unemployed, but I'm underemployed as an underpaid security
officer.  I'm game.

The major kicker was that the BSA showed up with armed police to raid
his place for software license violations AND on top of that he was
charged nearly $100,000 for having only a handful of improperly licensed
Windows installations. If you use Windows you better be careful.  :P

I'm double posting this to ptp and plug. Sorry if this offends you, I just
want to get rid of this stuff, and hope someone can use it.
Everything goes first come, first serve. . . if there is something for the
cafe / a project I think is cool, then it goes there.
I'll bring this stuff to the next personaltelco.net meeting -
http://www.personaltelco.net/index.cgi/MonthlyMeeting - if someone emails me
and tells me that they want it. If you aren't going to the meeting, email me
off list, I'm in Tigard. If you want to come and pick it up. . . All the
free stuff is as is, no warranties expressed or implied, etc ad naseum.
Lonnie's hardware give away gave me this idea, and I've been getting whined
at to get rid of some of this stuff, so here goes. . .

Older hp vectra, I'm giving it away as is. Dual 200mhz pentium pro box,
scsi, etc. Cost $5000 new ;) Mobo is dual proc capable but the magic smoke
escaped out of one of the VRM's capacitors and now it doesn't really post. .
.  I haven't played with it to see what the problem is. It really is a nice
case, AT power supply is still in there, 250W I believe.
http://loraksus.d2g.com/galleries/General/08-25-03/ has a couple pics of the
vectra I'm running inside, as well as the one in the garage. I'm keeping the
one inside, it makes a great printer stand / mail server.

I also have . . .
- p75 system, sorta makeshift (286 case, not any exact mounting points for
hard drives and the like, so everything is kind of loose ;)
- a similar pentium (133ish ?? ) minitower.  I haven't touched them for a
while. If someone bugs me I'll power them on and post the specs. Last I
remember they were working fine heating my garage doing seti units ;) I
think someone was saying something about a mp3 server for the cafe, the
smaller box would probably do that well. Both worked when I last touched 'em
IIRC
- ISA sound blasters, 2 or 3
- microsoft bus mouse cards + mice
- A bunch of small (~1GBish) hdds,
- some isa network cards, most ethernet / 10 base 2 / token.
- a couple 286 / 386 laptops for those with masochistic tendencies to
install linux on / museums / rifle targets / lcds, etc.
- some pretty big AT server / cases. If you're interested I'll make a list.
- 14.4 /28.8 pcmcia modems, might not have dongles, etc.
- pci modem, dunno if it works
- 72 pin memory, umm, a bag full, different stuff.
- 30 pin memory keychains ;)
- Old computer books, i.e. 8086, 8088, 80286 assembly manuals from intel, a
crapload of trade magazines.
- Bendys - if you've ever worked at stream, you'll want to torture these
things, free, but you have to send me pics of what you did to them.
- ye olde [crap] AT keyboards (sorry no expensive IBM ones)
- mobo boxes
- mobo / guts (raid array, etc) from a hp netserver (ye olde, dunno if it
works. I'm going to mod the case, but the rest of it goes (
http://loraksus.d2g.com/hpNetserver.jpg )
- a couple lcds.

$$ stuff - I'm also open to negotiation / trades here.
====
A parallel port NIC. Free - but I want to see someone getting this work
under linux. Ghetto, but you can network a 286 laptop with it ;)
3c595 NICS (pci, drivers suck above 2k, the card works fine w/ linux tho) -
1 Beer.
3c905 nics $10, support boot proms, but I have no prom chips (ditto with the
595's)
486 Laptops 66mhz, 33mhz,etc $20 or Beer.
3com rack mountable 24 port 10 base hubs $10 or a case of beer / fifth of
rum.
3com rack mountable 24 port managed 10 base 4 segment hubs $30
larscom rackmount csu/dsu $40
Palm pilot m105, with cradle, etc. $35
Storage space on my raid array - $10 / GB / month, backed up nightly.
Iomega pocket zip drive (pcmcia card), 3 disks $30
Cat 5 solid network cable - custom made 0.15 a foot + 0.50 a connector.
84u rack w/ plexi door $250
rack mount dual p2 300mhz 512k cache with dual lsi onboard scsi controllers,
cd, floppy, 192mb ram $110
CD Server - 200mhz box with 8 cdroms and a 10gb hdd $75, NIC.

I'll probably toss / shoot / burn / "Samir Nayeenanajar" / donate . . . most
of the stuff that doesn't get taken for free, just trying to give stuff to
those who can use it.

Peace!

BTW, if anyone has an AT->PS2 converter or a serial mouse / serial to ps2
converter or knows how to make a laptop lcd "useful" via a video out /
parallel port - that would be really cool.

Perhaps the state of Oregon would be one of our first clients. Maybe the 
Speaker of the House herself would want to know just how much the 
pirated software in her office alone is worth in fines (not to mention 
the embarassment... which is priceless).

Pluggers,

After bcc:ing that last e-mail to the Speaker, I got her auto-responder 
sending the e-mail you see below. I'm asking for your assistance in 
analyzing the headers.

Now, I'm using Mozilla on a RH 8.0 box, so I'm guessing the "Mozilla" 
lines below refer to me in some way.

Equally, the "Microsoft Exchange" bits are probably from the State's 
end. Am I reading it right to see "lion" as the name of the server that 
is doing the auto-responding?

I'm curious about how much of the state's e-mail is being served off of 
"lion". Also, is that machine doing anything else (serving up web-pages 
with IIS perhaps)? Finally, is "lion" fully patched?

I need to be explicit here. I am not asking anyone to crack this server, 
just to give opinions on whether it is secure (ok it's running windows, 
but as secure as is possible under windows). Also, frankly anything else 
anyone can legally reveal about the server would be interesting. 
Obviously, if they are running un-registered proprietary software, well, 
that would be worth mentioning.

Thanks for your assistance,

d

ps My understanding of the PLUG defaults are that if there is more than 
one recipient, the e-mail gets set aside for moderator approval. I am 
avoiding that delay by using bcc to send to Speaker Minnis on this 
e-mail and the last.

In the third arg, 'auto' will try to automatically determine what
the file system is, while 'vfat' says what it's expected to be.

In the fourth arg, 'user,noauto' says to allow normal users to
mount the device, but not to do it automatically at boot time,
while 'defaults,users' says to use the default settings
(rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, async), but on second
thought DO allow users to mount.

So the main diffs are that the first line will allow you to
mount a variety of file systems, while the second will auto-mount
at boot.

I though with user ....  user was the only one <execpt root> allowed

With users   anyone <any user> could umount a mounted system??????

This is correct; 'user' and 'users' have slightly different meanings.
Both allow a non-root user to mount the filesystem, while the former
restricts unmounting privilege to the user who issued the original
mount command.

See also the 'owner' option, which allows a non-root user to mount a
filesystem only if that non-root user is the owner of the /dev entry
that hosts the filesystem.

You forgot the part where Ball's case was used in countless commercials
as an example of ``this could happen to you" by the BSA & MS. It was a
case best decribed as ``You can't do it right, we're going to punish
you for it, & then we're going to subject you to public humiliation."

Sheesh, with treatment like that, you have to wonder how Microsoft has
any customers left.

Make sure to use mount and umount in pairs..

Every time your mount do umount.

Sounds like you forgot to umount one time.

So try doing a umount and mount again.

Only if you want to hack the util-linux source code; there are no

Yes.

The legislature is using an Exchange Server for its email (even 
though they swear they're using Groupwise), and because of 
organizational issues I doubt that anyone besides the Legislature 
is using lion.  ODOT also uses Exchange, or did as recently as a 
year ago.  

Most of the State is using either Groupwise or 'nix-based email 
servers (Sendmail, I presume, but I don't remember if they ever 
told us.  If Cooper Stevenson is reading this, maybe he'll 
remember).  DAS is sick of Exchange and wants to wean agencies 
away from it as soon as they can.  

> Also, is that machine doing anything else

I seriously doubt it.  Every Exchange admin (I am one of them) 
knows that Exchange is a HOG, and it's foolish to run anything on 
an Exchange server except Exchange (and maybe IIS for serving 
web-based email).

I can guarantee you that any software the State of Oregon is 
running is 100% legal.  They employ more people than you can 
imagine (at our expense, of course) just to ensure license 
compliance.  The bureaucratic paperwork involved in installing 
one simple piece of software on a State computer is... uh, 
interesting.

CC'ing your message to the Speaker of the House was not a good 
move.

It wasn't recently.  It was a number of years ago (three, IIRC).  
It's in the news right now because the owner, Stirling Ball 
(Ernie Ball's son) gave a talk at Linuxworld and it was one hell 
of a talk.  So the tech journalists who were in the room saw that 
they had a great story on their hands and Mr. Ball is getting 
lots of press right now.

> > The major kicker was that the BSA showed up with armed police

That wasn't the major kicker.  The major kicker is below.

> You forgot the part where Ball's case was used in countless
> commercials as an example of ``this could happen to you"

THAT was what pissed him off the most.  He's a man of integrity 
whose reputation in his community is important to him, and the 
Gestapo splashed his name all over the place with the label 
"criminal".

There was a large contingent (a dozen or so) of people from 
Microsoft Corporation in the room when he made his speech.  He 
asked right up front, "Anyone from Microsoft here?  Anyone want 
to admit it?" and they all raised their hands.

He was NOT gentle.  It was one of the finest days of my life.

One of the press reports of that event mentioned that it was a 
standing-room-only crowd in that room. That isn't quite true.  I 
was standing, as were a lot of others, but there were lots of 
empty seats.  It's just that he was so electrifying that many of 
us COULDN'T sit down....

Oh my god, he raked M$ over the coals big-time.  Looked 'em right 
in the eye and said, "A simple phone call would have worked."  
But they were after someone to make an example of, and they 
picked a fight with the wrong dude.  This guy is 
six-feet-something and weighs well over two hundred pounds.  He 
appears to be in his late fifties and is an old-school (i.e., 
compete on excellence and service instead of marketing bullshit) 
businessman.

One of the Microsofties asked, "What about all the retraining 
costs of switching to Linux?"

"What training costs?" he shot right back.  "It took most of our 
people all of TWENTY MINUTES to figure out how to use the new 
software, and we're not techies.  We're musicians."

Ouch.

One other man from the middle of the Microsoft crowd asked if the 
switch has "improved his balance sheet" at all, with vocal 
inflections insinuating that his "balance sheet" was probably 
worse (you know, the old higher TCO FUD).

I found that question highly amusing.  The fool didn't even know 
the difference between a balance sheet and an income statement.  
Balance sheets don't "improve" over time; they are either in 
balance (showing that no errors were made), or they are not.

After his talk some Microsoftie came up to him and said, "I'm with 
Microsoft and I'd like to personally apologise for what we did to 
you.  We don't do those things any more, we've changed, blah blah 
blah."  He went on for several minutes, reminding me of the song 
in the South Park movie where Saddam Hussein sings "I can change, 
I can change" to Satan.

Microsoft cost this guy a hundred thousand bucks and some 
low-level functionary from M$ thinks he can make it all OK with a 
"we're sorry, we won't do that again"?  Gimme a break.

At that point, I got distracted by a really cute Asian lady who 
works for Sun Microsystems who wanted to talk to me and take me 
to her booth.  I didn't realize until much later that she was 
probably just a Booth Babe hired for the show, and not one of the 
rare & elusive Hot Geek Girls that we males all dream about.

In all, Linuxworld was a great show this year and Stirling Ball's 
talk was definitely one of the high points.

This is not a good guarantee.  The State is a large entity encompassing
many disparate agencies and I can assure you that unlicensed software is
almost magical in it's ability to propogate.  I seriously doubt
server-side software (Exchange, IIS, etc) would be unlicensed, but
things like MS Office have a tendency to get widely deployed even
without licenses.  More frequently things like Office *Pro* tend to get
deployed where only a standard license was purchased.  OTOH, the State
is also fond of site-licensing which protects them in most cases.

Which make unlicensed copies (which don't require paperwork) all the
more appealing ;)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0308261029510.7035-100000@k12linux.mesd.k12.or.us>

It appears I am in the need of being hit upside the head with the
clue stick ;-)


One particularly complex load-balancing setup we have is in need of
a little arp black magic: I need server A to answer arp requests on
behalf of server B.

That is, when some random host sends out an arp query "who has serverb?",
Server A needs to respond "serverb is at 01:02:03:04:05:06", where 
"01:02:03:04:05:06" is the real MAC address for server B. 

I'm not having much luck figuring out how to do this and all of the
docs I can find cover how to hijack an IP via arp & proxy arp. Neither
of these fit my scenario. 

Has anyone here setup something like this up? Given how much trouble I'm
having I assume there is an embarrasingly simple solution ;-)

On this point, I want to rant for a moment.

All males may dream about hot geek girls, but all the geeks in Portland
seem to be absolutely incapable of treating one right. I'm lucky enough
to occasionally accompany a hot geek girl to various geeky events, and I
have yet, in Portland or the surrounding area, been lucky enough to find
a geek event where the geeks didn't assume that every girl was dragged
along by the guy who'd come with her. My geeky friend has been asked on
nearly every occasion "who'd you come with?" in an insulting manner that
implied she couldn't possibly know enough to come on her own. 

So guys, get a clue and don't assume a girl don't know shit. You don't
have to talk to her about geek stuff immediately, but "who'd you come
with" or any such comment at a geek setting to a girl is a good way to
get your ass kicked.

/end rant/

  Has anyone else had a problem with the parallel port getting stuck when
trying to print via CUPS? It happens infrequently here, enough that it takes
me a hour or so to go look at the process list and discover the problem
after stopping/starting cupsd and trying to figure out what broke.

  This is a RH 7.3 system with cups-1.1.19 installed.

yes I have.

It all backwards, an odd number of times.

The question is, do you want to proxy an IP or a mac address?

Lets assume outside and inside of a gateway.

Address 192.168.90.45 is inside

192.168.90.46 is the gateway's nic on the inside (eth1)
192.168.90.47 is the gateway's nic on the outside. (eth0)
192.168.90.1 is the real default gateway which is on the outside.

So we want to make 192.168.90.45 look like it available to the outside

we have eth1 for the inside, and eth0 for the outside

To publish to outside that .45 is to be "answered" by eth0
        arp -Ds 192.168.90.45  eth1 pub -i eth0

To publish to the inside that .1 is to answered by eth1
        arp -Ds 192.168.90.1  eth0 pub -i eth1

You should be able to do this with MAC Address as well.

Word of warning, this works real well under Linux, but other Unix-like
OSes including routers do not always support pub.

I have a similar camera, and when I erase the photos
according to the instructions in the manual, it works.
But it's always a good idea to unmount file systems
before the device is removed, anyhow.

I have used proxy arp in the distant past.  The person that wrote the
code is Russian, and the documentation is sparse, to say the least.
Here are some pointers, but I'm not sure they will be terribly useful.

Zot, I think that may be the hard way to do it.  Here's someone else's
example of how to use proxy arp.  Let me know if I got it wrong.

Hi!

I can only answer to his question, because I could not figure
out how the assemble the ascii art into a network.

However, perhaps it helps anyway:
If you enable proxy ARP on a linux 2.4 interface by writing '1'
into /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/<interface>/proxy_arp,
all ARP requests received on this interface for an IP address
which is routed via another interface are answered with the
own hardware address.

So if you have interface eth0 with 192.168.1.1/24 with the
interface route (ip route show table local) going
to 192.168.1.0/24 and another route, let's say for
192.168.1.50 going via eth1, this and only this address
is proxy arp'ed on interface eth0.

This also makes perfect sense, since routing tells the kernel
where a host is assumed to be located, and answering an ARP
request for a host which is believed to be located in the
same network doesn't make sense.

Hope this helps,
Walter

Um, if someone explicitly asking you not to do ethically questionable 
acts is what you consider inducement to do the opposite, I don't know

David, perhaps if you gave a reason for asking such things, people
wouldn't assume the worst.  If I go to an airport and start asking
"innocent" questions about security, you can be certain it will raise
hackles.

Hi /me,

Certifications mean little around here. Can you handle
Front Page problems?

And are you willing to work for only $50/hour?
I know it sucks.

Judging from my discussion with the customer,
it's probably a simple problem so it may be only
one hour. The only good news is that we don't
charge less than one hour.

Well, never mind. This customer changed his mind. He

PANUG used to be the Portland Area Novell/NetWare
User Group. A few years ago, it broadened its scope
and changed its name to the Portland Area Networking
User Group. In spite of the change, it's still the
only user group in Portland that supports NetWare
and has a high percentage of members who use
NetWare and other Novell products.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0308261622050.32559@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I had my fiancee's laptop running kdm with Slackware-9.0. When I installed
the distribution, I _thought_ I had installed both Gnome and KDE because I
didn't know whether either gdm or kdm supported user shutdown. It turns out
that kdm does (I don't know about gdm).

  Anyway, a security patch for gdm came out and I installed that today. Then
I shut down the laptop. When I tried to boot it again, it stopped when it
could not find libatk-1.so.0. Found that library on my RH 7.3 box and copied
it over via sneakernet. Now the laptop wants a gnome-2 library that I do not
have and the only references google returned are for Red Hat packages.

  Where do I find the session manager specified? I wonder if -- in single
user mode -- I can disable the attempt to find the Gnome stuff and have it
go back to booting into runlevel 4 with kdm as the session manager. As a
non-professional SysAdmin, I cannot recall where that's specified and I
cannot find it in /etc.

TIA,

Rich

Sure. Any thing said has implications. If you want to state something 
explicitly, one custom is to say so, for example, "I'm explicitly 
conveying this message" is often used as a marker for one's intent.

But, you asked about the reason. I simply saw "Microsoft Exchange" in 
the header and wondered how vulnerable my government is and how liable 
for BSA audits. That's curiosity and concern, not malice. (Explicitly 
now, if that was still unclear).

  I used the pkgtool and removed the gdm package. Now the system boots just

I do not pretend to know how the installation could have been fixed, but
I want to note that if you, or anyone else, does get gdm working, it
does in fact support user shutdown, though not by default. In fact, gdm
comes with a very sexy new look. It's not the default--you have to turn
it on in gdmconfig, which must be run as root, yet is an X program, but
with gdmconfig there are a lot of cool options including user shutdown
and themes. 

Yes, I realize theming gdm seems rather silly since you're hardly ever
in it, but it's kinda cool. =)

I'm not trying to _proxy_ arp. The kernel doc's say that proxy_arp
forwards arp packets between two devices attached to different media.

I'm trying to get one server to respond to arp requests for another
server on the same physical network. Proxy arp doesn't work in this case,
or at least I have not figured out how to bend proxy arp in that fashion...

Jeff,

  Interestingly enough, kdm has user shutdown as a default option. The main
workstations/servers boot into console mode -- and so has my notebook over
the years -- so this is the first time I've configured a system to boot into
runlevel 4 (or 5 if it's on Red Hat). I find it more restrictive than
manually running 'startx' when I want it, but it's easier for her and
certainly easier to properly shut down the system when she's done.

Thanks for the input,

Rich

Modify /etc/rc.d/rc.4 to load the session manager of your choice.

FWIW, I'd just recompile gdm manually.  The libraries it is trying to
use and you replaced for it weren't compiled for your system.

Where'd you get the updated patch?  There may be others there that are
related.  You might go grab the 'whichpkg' script (dunno where it is,
though) to find out which package the missing library is contained in,
then check the /patches directory for an updated version of the package
that contains the library... if that makes sense.

Now I really am confused.  If serverB is on the same wire, why can't it
respond to the ARP request?  Is serverB slow to respond to ARP requests,
or does it not respond at all?  Is it correct to say that you want 
something like proxy arp, but for a single segment?  Perhaps you could
hack arpd to do what you want.

Load-balancing/fail-over can be extremely convoluted at times. I've
tried real hard not to give any details on the setup as a whole, since
it definately would not help to clarify what I'm trying to do with
this one little piece of the puzzle ;-)

Let it surfice to say that if "serverB" crashes, or is otherwise
unavailable, things will still work perfectly as long as the other
servers/routers/etc on the same physical network *think* "serverB"
is still up.

I didn't think of trying to hack arpd, but I did have a number of other
messy ideas. I was rather hoping that someone would have tried to 
do this in the past would know a simple, easy to maintain solution ;-)

Hmmm... Unfortunately non of the links worked to see the vectra... :(

Also how do you define "Pretty Big AT server cases"? (Personally I'm looking
for an old NEC case.)

Does the dual p2 work?

I should not have said the word proxy, but what I wrote should work just
fine.

ServerA will publish an arp for server B.  All responses will goto A. 
What I failed to mention above is my serverA knew what to do with the
packet (forward it to the network) because of routing rules.

If you are merely usurping B's mac then
  arp -i eth0 -s hostname hw_addr [netmask nm] pub

where hostname is B's IP address, and hw_addr is B's MAC, eth0 is the
appropriate interface.  Netmask is optional

I believe you need the IP and hw_addr.

shifts the arguments to the function.  when you call
    checkpid a b c d e
then, inside checkpid, $1 is 'a', $2 is 'b', etc
after you shift, $1 is 'b', $2 is 'c', etc.

> if [ "${BOOTUP:-}" != "verbose" ]; then

${var:-foo} is a notation that means "if var is non-null, then
substitute its value, otherwise substitute foo".

There's no particular reason to use that notation here.
"$BOOTUP" would be fine.

All of this is described in detail in the bash man page.

shift is in the section "SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS".

${} is in the section "Parameter Expansion".

You should find an intro to shell programming.  Those are very
basic questions you're asking, and you probably won't get far
without some general knowledge of how shell scripts work.

Since this is presumably a bash script, $1 is the list of arguments supplied 
to the script from the command line (it's hardcoded into bash).  'shift' 
steps through them using <space> as a seperator (although this can be 
changed through the environmental var $IFS which stands for Internal Field 
Seperator).

So if you call your script thusly,

$ my_script foo bar baz

the while loop above will be entered three times, and $1 will hold the 
values foo, bar, baz in that order.

I'd answer the rest, but my dog insists on playing right now...

What's interesting is that the Received: headers indicate it passed
directly from lion to the Hevanet server, but the X-MimeOLE: header
indicates an Exchange server.

Re-reading the arp man page for the x^2 time today, I see that 
the netmask is no longer supported. man 7 arp says that netmask
was dropped in favor of an "automatic proxy arp setup by the kernel
for all reachable hosts on other interfaces (when forwarding and proxy
arp is enabled for the interface)".

man 8 arp has the following note for the "-i" switch: This has to be
different from the interface to which the IP datagrams will be routed.


So this still might not do the trick for me, since I'm not working
with "another interface". 

Turning on proxy_arp & ip_forward and then running
"arp -i eth0 -s 10.0.0.1 01:02:03:04:05:06 pub" does not give me
an error, but "cat /proc/net/arp" shows the hw address as 
00:00:00:00:00:00. Doh!

Just for kicks, I did some amazingly ugly hacks with dummy devices,
but that didn't fool it either ;-)

Fun stuff!

In general, when faced with an unfamiliar command in a shell script on
a Linux host, you'd be well served to try the standard sources of
help.

It's very important to note that the shell may have a builtin version
of a utility that also exists as its own binary: echo, false, kill,
pwd, test, and true are a few that come to mind.

E.g, calling "kill" within a bash script can be subtly different than
invoking "/bin/kill" directly. At a command prompt, for example, type
"kill -l" and then "/bin/kill -l" to see the variations in the sort of
signals they can recognize.

So, for any command "foo" you'd first check the shell's help system
and then, failing that, check for a standalone man page.

1. Try using bash's help system:

   [host]$ help foo

2. If it shows up in the help system, but you need more info, then
   search for "foo" in the bash man page:

   [host]$ man bash

   If you use less for viewing man pages (e.g., by setting the PAGER
   environment variable), then you can search for a whole-word match:

   /\<foo\>

   The '/' puts you into search mode, and the \< and \> act as
   word-boundary markers, so that "fool" wouldn't match, but "foo."
   and "(foo)" would.

3. If you can't find it in the shell literature, try looking for a man
   page:

   [host]$ man foo

4. Poke around the two wonderful LDP HOWTOs concerning shell
   scripting:

   beginning: http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html
   advanced:  http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html

5. Ask PLUG. :-)

Great. That is reassuring. As I understand it DAS has some highly

All of the state's e-mail goes through a single server. Thankfully, it's 
not a windows box. Good to know.

Straight technical responses are always appreciated. Thanks for the 
help. Should I have the opportunity to speak with some more legislators 
before the session ends, I'll let them know that there's a reasonably 
good chance that the state isn't rooted.

Does anyone know if the State suffered much on the last couple of waves

Subject: [PLUG] Three Linux systems, one boot partition...
Message-ID: <1061963831.20133.117.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I thought I could just uninstall lilo from one 
of the Linux systems I was working on.  
Unfortunately, it screwed things up even though 
I tarred up boot before removal and restored it 
after.  I guess I should have chrooted into the 
Linux system responsible for lilo to rerun lilo.  
My last run of lilo must have been from the Linux 
system I was taking it off of instead of another 
one so that lilo couldn't be found.  I'd like to 
uninstall lilo from all but one system.

The module-info files under /boot, what are they 
for?  Is there any reason to keep vmlinux-x.y.z 
around when you need the compressed version to boot?

I guess the leftover grub directory even though grub 
is uninstalled is another bug.  I just removed it.  
If you uninstall the files of an rpm manually that 
is still installed can you safely remove that rpm as 
well?  

How do rpms behave in cases of overlap?  I installed 
to my boot partition from all three systems without 
reformatting it since it's shared.  My two Redhat 7.3 
systems are both using the original kernel.  I have 
yet to get a custom kernel for Redhat 7.3 working 
right, but at least I got one to boot finally.  I 
discovered that I had to use absolute device paths 
for custom kernels in lilo.conf even though the 
original kernel uses some kind of indirect label.

I've written a series of  bash script for selecting network boot
images.  I have a book on bash, but I'm running into a
lot of syntax I don't recognize and more than that I wish there 
were some notes on what these init scripts were written to do
in more detail than I currently have.  I can pick out some 
blocks of code and see some of the logical organization, but 
it's slow going.

Doing research online on how to create one's own nfs-root 
system I've taken a recommended first step of installing a 
normal Linux distribution.  Leaving all the extra package 
groups out in the Redhat 7.3 install I've gone further and 
removed even more packages I don't need so at least I'm 
working with a more minimized environment.  One thing I really 
don't like about Redhat is how spaghettied some packages including 
cyrus-sasl and openldap are with other packages.  One thing 
I don't get is why the files under etc for the large part 
aren't connected to the package their respective programs 
are installed from.  Another thing I don't get is why Redhat 
has a predefined password list instead of having a package 
add users and groups for itself when it is installed?  It 
would be nice to have some notes on what the default vendor 
accounts are for, etc.  That reminds me, I haven't trimmed 
any unneeded passwords and groups yet.  

I read somewhere that I should mount boot read only for better 
security, I'm not sure that's a good idea having caught a boot 
time error that System.map could not be recreated.

So far I've forced this package off:

     openldap

And I've removed:

     sendmail, procmail, mailcap, lokkit, lilo, ipchains, grub, gpm, 
at, and apmd.

I figured that it's ok to delete maillog with sendmail removed.

I'm down to 125 packages.

I want to remove cyrus, but I keep getting errors that libuser needs it.
I should probably remove the kerberos packages.  I wonder what else
I can take off intending this to be a system to run over nfs that
provides access to locally installed systems on a client's machine for
backup and restoration operations?  I should probably just link the
password files on the server instead of keeping the local password files
this system has now once I get it moved over.

I've tarred up X11 under etc and removed the directory from there which
shouldn't have any effect since X isn't installed.  I've done the same
with the ppp directory.  I've also deleted hosts.allow and hosts.deny.

Somewhere I read that config files for stuff that isn't installed can
be safely deleted and that they will be recreated if you install the
program that needs them.  Is there an easy way to catch all unused
config files?  The fewer places I have to look in, the sooner I'll 
be able to understand the system I'm working with well enough to 
modify it for it's particular purpose.

Thanks to the vi tip I've been able to fix the initial installation log
so that I can compare it to a fresh list of the installed rpms to verify
which packages I have removed.

Are anacron and vixie-cron different packages?  I should probably take
anacron off.  

Ultimately figuring out what's needed and what isn't a custom install
image wouldn't be a bad idea.  I guess I'd have to replace some standard
packages as it's looking like a number of files under /etc just aren't
needed.  Evidently the secret is to learn about anacron when it comes
to building a new installer for Redhat.

Those thoughts never even cross my mind when I'm in geeky, yet mixed,
company.  Probably because I went to the geek academy at Merlo Station
and got used to the mix.  

And to remove any mystery, your odds of getting a date with a geek
girl seem to be dramatically lower at an all-geek high school: While I
was attending, it averaged 115 students, only 8 ladies.  Two were more
interested in computers than dating, two who were going out with each
other, and the rest going steady, mostly with guys from other high
schools.  It was literally easier to get a date with a lady at a Boy
Scout camp (my first girlfriend I met when we were both working at
Camp Ireland just north of Hillsboro, she was an Explorer Scout with
Post 415 Hillsboro).

Well, for one thing geek girls can't be gay men that don't need you
around no matter how oblivious you are to the partner checking you 
out!  As far as I know, there isn't the same sort of danger for guys
with Lesbians either.  I wish our society would find the proper balance
between encouraging some homosexuals to act in a manner that makes 
it obvious they are while at the same time staying away from the
opposite extreme of looking the other way when a homophobe murders 
a homosexual.  What scares me the most with some homosexuals is
how angry they can get.  I think part of the problem with smart
women is that they often think nobody within their own 
community is smart, not that men don't have this problem 
too ;-o  As far as ego goes, I'd say there's a fear in most
people that a smart person will just find their faults where
it doesn't help that so many people, smart ones some of them, 
are trying to worship human achievement.  I'm surprised the
geek girl numbers are so much lower than the male numbers.
Statistically the number of men is so disproportionate to
the number of women in a significant percentage of the
nation's Universities that institutions are going all the
way to the Supreme Court to win the right to favor men in 
enrollment decisions.  Maybe it's evening out, that's good
news for gender diversity in higher education.

It's all described in the bash man page.  The man page is not
that long.

Start from the top.  Everything starts from the program 'init'.
init runs the programs specified in /etc/inittab.  /etc/inittab
says to run /etc/rc.d/rc.  /etc/rc.d/rc does a bunch of stuff,
which includes running the scripts in /etc/rc.d/rc?.d, which are
symlinks to scripts in /etc/rc.d/init.d.  It's pretty
straightforward, there's nothing magic going on.

It's partly historical, partly practical.  One motivation is to
separate sharable data from non-sharable data.  In principle, it
should be possible to have thousands of systems with identical
read-only copies of most of the filesystem.  See the Filesystem
Hierarchy Standard for more detail.

Because you run into problems if uids are mismatched, especially
across NFS.  It's better to reserve all the important uids in
advance, so nobody accidentally uses the same uid for 'guest' and
'apache', for instance.

Someone else can answer the rest.

Hmmm I am not getting good answers.

I would track down information on dsniff, perhaps there is a way of
using it.

A bad bad trick is have a down nic on the net.  Set it's mac to B's
mac.  ifconfig up when you need it......

Perhaps that is what you were trying with dummy devices.

I don't see too much public domain software out there.  Just because
the GPL allows free redistribution doesn't mean it's not licensed.

No kidding.  I don't work an airport, but still there's questions you
just don't ask if you don't want the nth degree.  Like how many of us
are on duty or what the coverage is.

I was hoping to not have to resort to sending out forged, gratutious

That is exactly what I was trying to do with the dummy devices.
It didn't work in that case (I didn't try too hard, as you say the

On the one system that has lilo installed, it can be 
programmed to boot the other two keeping administration 
simpler.  For the system I intend to use as an nfs_root 
system it's only temporarily going to be a local system 
anyways.  For installing multiple Linux systems to the 
same hard drive I'd say it's best to only install lilo 
once and then program that one installation of lilo to 
boot all of the systems.  On a system your messing with, 
having lilo installed to it and potentially having that 
installation of lilo be the one your booting, it is too 
easy to break booting for all of the installed Linux 
systems.  Of course, if you use fdisk or mount the 
partitions of your other systems when your messing 
around you can still muck everything up pretty 
good :-)  I had hoped to get a netboot image of
Tom's Root Boot going, but I can't remember how to
set it up.  I probably used an iso image of
Tom's Root Boot before to get a kernel and initrd 
off of.

Lilo can be installed to the master 
boot record or to the first sector of the 
boot partition.  There can be three primary 
partitions and many extended ones.  However, 
I believe all boot partitions, even on modern
computers, have to be below the first 500-1024 
megs of the hard drive.  For every boot 
partition one installation of lilo is possible.  
I only have one, albeit large, boot partition.

Why do I have a problem?  I have dos 
installed on this machine which if I 
remember right has to be at the 
beginning of the drive reducing the 
room I have for a secondary or tertiary
boot partition.  Plus, it's hard to add
boot partitions with Windows 98 and dos
already installed after the fact.  There 
would be some moving around of partitions 
and I'd still probably need to dump 
partitions and clear the partition table 
completely.

If I were rich it would be one hard disk per 
operating system, but only just now with the 
advent of serial ATA allowing up to seven 
drives is that even a practical approach.  
Granted there's scsi, but that can still 
be a real hassle since ATA controllers 
often don't like to disable hogging the 
resources the scsi card needs to work.  
My Pentium four has four of these ATA 
controllers.  Considering my tape drive 
doesn't work, I'm not going to dump the 
partitions to tape, repartition, and 
restore.

Using one boot partition can save hard 
drive space.  Considering the possibilty 
that all your Linux systems, or all but 
one, will use custom kernels, there 
aren't overlap issues.  The only 
real problem is if you try to add say 
Redhat 6.2 to a Redhat 7.x or Redhat 9 
environment since the root and boot 
filesystems have changed from ext2 to 
ext3.

I have neither cyrus sasl nor openldap running on my machine, and this
is being sent from evolution.

However! If a package was compiled against a set of libraries, it may
well not run if those libraries are gone. You'd have to recompile or
fine a set of rpms that weren't dependent on those packages.

Read fstsab(5), it describes it nicely.  The former adds some
intelligence by guessing the filesystem and letting users mount.
defaults will try to mount it automatically, noauto will not.  Just
use the former if you're trying to figure out which is better for
mounting a camera.

Yes, that's right.  Really handy if you want to let users use the

Surprisingly removing cyrus-sasl, cyrus-sasl-plain, openldap, or
cyrus-sasl-md5 from Redhat 7.3 stock breaks opening the evolution
database.  I wonder what the security risk of sasl and openldap
client is?

doubt cyrus-sasl is a security risk at all, though it's a good question
why evolution needs it. What version of evolution?

As for the openldap client, it's a client. It might allow local root
exploits, though I doubt that, but it's very unlikely to offer remote
exploits.

I'd compile it myself. It'd be easier. Get a source rpm and convert it
to an rpm. Get a .deb and convert it to an rpm.

For a definitive answer, you probably ought to ask on

No more accidents.  Much easier than uninstalling lilo.

  I guess it's time for me to finally set up tinydns here, and I've started
reading the docs before doing anything. In the meantime, I have a couple of
questions I hope you folks will either answer for me or you will provide me
with pointers to reading material with the answers.

  There are a couple of domain names I've registered with godaddy.com. Now I
want to make them visible to the world, and point the domain names to
specific IP addresses. (In one case, the IP address will be here when I set
up dbjdns' components I need. In the other case, I have two IP addresses for
name servers elsewhere.)

  What is the procedure for doing this? Does the domain registrar need to do
anything? After I get the name server running properly here I'll also want
to move the business domain name to here from my ISP, but I suppose that I
ask them to change their record at that time.

  The ORA book focuses on bind and named. Other than the on-line Web pages
for tinydns I don't know of other reading materials.

Thanks,

I'm ok with the nth degree, but I think there are two approaches to 
security. One is to discourage discussion and hope that one's 
vulnerabilities go un-noticed. The other is to discuss stuff openly and 
then take the precautions of the best minds available on the subject.

I think people who are afraid of the discussion or assume malice on the 
part of those who ask questions are in the first camp. That camp's name 
is "Security through obscurity".

Paul used the airport analogy. Let's extend it. If someone had gone to 
the FBI before 9/11 and started asking questions about air defenses, yes 
it would have raised hackles. Whether you think the asking of questions 
would have then caused the 9/11 tragedy probably depends on which camp 
you are in.

In general, Linux/Unix people have tended to prefer the second camp. 
(whose name is... security through applied intelligence and testing?) In 
cases of extreme national security, like Los Alamos, I think there's an 
argument to be made for obscurity. But, it's a short term argument. Even 
with full scale cold war type obscurity, the Soviets laid their hands on 
the atomic blueprints within months of Hiroshima.

As long as the domain registrar has the correct IP addresses for your
name server(s), then you can keep the registrar completely out of the
loop. You'll need to work with godaddy only if you need to update the
addresses for your NS records.

I suppose you'll want to initiate any DNS discussion with your ISP as
soon as possible, even if you won't be doing the actual move for a
while. That'll give you and them both time to ponder any potential
gotchas (and fees) that may arise. But this is all just common sense,
so I'm probably just telling you what you already know. :-)

I fully understand that open security is usually stronger security.
That's obvious.  Breaking into a weapons depot *will* be harder than
breaking into an office highrise, and it doesn't take a genious to
point that out.  However, an office tower has a larger, more random
population on a smaller security budget than a prison.

Given that human nature dictates a balance between convienence,
aesthetics and security in an office building, security often gets the
short end of the stick, and there's barely enough money to upkeep an
alarm and surveilence system, much less upgrade either, and hire a
skeleton crew for security, with no money to test out to see if
protocols work to plan.  When you're understaffed, it helps to keep
secrets.  Thank God I don't work under those conditions.

You know, I never really thought about it like this before, but with
how much money Microsoft has and aesthetics and convienence clearly
aren't issues for Microsoft, you think they could do a little better
with their OS's security than an understaffed security detail can do
for an office building.

Part of the problem is that proficiency at shell scripting implies to
a large degree proficiency with the standard Unix utilities.

The various Linux distributions package the GNU utils in different
ways, but you might try starting with

  info coreutils

Oh, wait. You'll have the coreutils package if your distro is of
recent vintage. Otherwise, you'll have the old package sets:
fileutils, textutils, and sh-utils (and maybe others; I forget).

And, if you're doing much development work

  info binutils

I don't want to start a flame war about DNS server preference, but I think you
made a good choice with tinydns.

The first step is to get yourself a couple of valid name servers.  I say valid
because name servers for a domain, say example.com, must be registered with
appropriate root name server.  This is called a glue record
(http://www.dyndns.org/support/kb/gluerecords.html) and is done by your domain
registrar.  Most registrars give you the option of doing a 'register name
server' or 'register host'.  It has been awhile since I have used godaddy.com,
but I believe they have something like that as well.  Once you have the glue
records for your name servers setup, which will be something like
ns1.example.com and ns2.example.com or a.ns.example.com and b.ns.example.com if
you follow DJB's style, then you are ready to setup your own dns records for
your domain.

As far as moving your current business domain name, there really is no reason
you have to work with your ISP at all, except to cancel your service once you
are done.  Now, if you do work with them they may be kind enough to forward all
of your email that gets sent to them during the dns crossover window (not the
official term) to your new mail server.  Otherwise all you need to do is change
the appropriate name servers with your registrar for your business domain to
match your new domains, and then setup the appropriate dns records to point to
your new hosting box.  If you want to change name servers for your domain, which
is a 24-72 hr process, while still leaving your business website hosted on your
ISP's servers, then you will want to emulate the dns records that your ISP has
setup.  You can figure out what they are by using whois, dig, and host.  If you
need any help doing this I would be more than happy to help you out.

>   The ORA book focuses on bind and named. Other than the on-line Web pages

Unfortunately I don't know of much tinydns specific documentation on the web.  I
basically just read the docs on djb's site.  However, you can always look up
information regarding dns on the web for general info.

I hope you can get past the bad grammar to the information that is useful.

Okay, here's a bit of advice from someone who's married to
a hot geek girl -- or a rant, take your pick.

The intersection of the set of attractive women, & the set
of intelligent women is not a null set, but it is small. And
not all of those women in this subset would rather spend
their Friday nights hacking $SOFTWARE over any other activity.

And I'm sorry, but the woman with the looks of a porn star
& can write code that gets accepted into the Linux kernel on
the first try just doesn't exist -- except for in some of
our fantasies.

My advice is look for a partner with brains: there's a lot
of intelligent people out there who are actually a lot more
attractive than she/he thinks, & would blossom if given
some reassurance. And if they have brains, they probably
will have some skill with computers. (Although I've seen
a lot of anecdotal evidence that this is not always the case.)

My wife works as an accountant, but she's not dumb: she
passed the CPA test on her first try. (Only 15% of people
manage to pull that off.) And we both have our own computers.
I also have a cousin who I would consider a ``hot geek girl"
who started out with a degree in graphic design, got a job
designing fonts for Adobe, & parlayed it into a career in
Silicon Valley. (And is working on a router project at Nortel
today, despite the economy & massive exporting of tech jobs.)
And before you guys start asking for her email address,
she's married with grown children. ;-)

And besides, it's a proven fact that even in successful
relationships/marriages there are fights. Do you really want
to spend the night on the couch over a disagreement about
vi vs. emacs or Linux vs. FreeBSD?

nmap (endorsed by ``The Matrix Reloaded") shows some interesting open
ports on Lion. I'm not an expert by any means with nmap, but from
what I saw I couldn't be sure if it was a *nix or a Windoze box --

I have to speak up for Erik here. I've known him for several years,
& he's a sharp guy. Unfortunately in the Windoze world you are forced
to work with Outbreak as your default email client, & our friends

Natural beauty trumps mere attractiveness any day :-)  Maybe the
set seems arbitrarily small because you have to be on an 
intelligent woman's intellectual level to get noticed.  There
are things about a woman that are more fun to appreciate than
the body, I'm certain of this ;-)  Marry the right one and I
could see having quite a good time raising kids.  Guess I need
a B.S. and career first though, ughh :-0

 Check the dir /mnt/firedrive for permissions
ls -l /mnt/firedrive

Also you have misspelled kudzu with the letters kuzu.

Subject: [PLUG] Looking at bandwidth optimization schemes...
Message-ID: <1062008052.26484.21.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

What is the advantage of a fixed packet size as used in ATM?

For real time computing would you only accept inbound connections
at a certain rate of speed for certain protocols or do you have 
to control both ends of the link?  If packets are dropped they
get retransmitted wasting more bandwidth, right?  What causes
tcp, icmp, or udp thrashing to occur?

In gnome ftp you can lower the transfer rate where I've noticed
that dropping it to the speed of my ADSL when I'm going online
reduces the number of collisions on the hub.  I'm going
to get a switch at some point :-)

The purposes for ISPs are: distributed management of ip addresses,
theoretically worm virus and spam control, and lastly sharing of
high cost TI/E1/OC3/fiber etc. lines between multiple subscribers.
IP addresses, even blocks, used to be free.  Nowadays a single IP 
is $5 or more a month.  ISP's are not required to advertise
compatibility information about their email offerings or even
provide spam control that their end users can take advantage of
which will actually reduce real spam.  That's not all, the cost 
of bandwidth is wildly variable even from a single provider 
over the areas that provider serves.  The bandwidth cap seems
to be wildly variable also, I believe 800k downstream 512k up
is the maximum a single ADSL line in Scappoose can do.  St.
Helens residents evidently can go faster on lines that are
of arguably lower data quality.  If you could get just DSL
on a second line it wouldn't be so bad, but DSL isn't sold
as a seperate service from POTS.  I know they could sell it
that way in Scappoose because they've turned POTS off before
without turning off DSL.  The only thing I'm wondering is
if there is a bottleneck from everyone coming in from as far
away as Astoria artificially lowering the speeds that can be 
offered in Scappoose.

So there are only two approaches: the straw-man approach, and the
unrelated idea that gives you carte blanche.  

How convenient.

No, that camp's name is "mind your own business".

In the *study* of security, there is a strong case to be made for
improving security by fully exploring how it is implemented.

In the *application* of security, there is a strong case to be made for
fully auditing and documenting the system you're implementing.  

The desire to *probe* the security of systems that you are not
responsible for is something else entirely.  There is no strong case to
be made for your involvement at all... *particularly* not when you're
looking for a way to leverage personal gain.

I think the word you're looking for is "hacking."  That's what it is
when you're working on your own stuff, anyway.  

Once you allow yourself to feel entitled to be curious about someone
else's system, the line between hacking and cracking becomes razor thin.

Ah, there's a point of difference in our understanding. I consider the 
state of Oregon's IT infrastructure "mine" in the sense that I help pay 
for it and it stores data about me. Also ultimately the "owner" is the 
people of Oregon (ie us). Further, if only indirectly, as voters we get 
to express our opinions about how well the state is managing our IT 
resources.

That said, you may be right, I may be an overly curious individual.

Do you ever get the urge to take a police car for a spin when you see
one idling at the curb?  You know, just to make sure the motor pool is
taking good care of the cars?  You pay for it after all.

Do you feel that the telephone switch in your neighborhood is your's
because you pay your phone bill and it's used to route your telephone
calls?  Or that Bonneville Dam is yours to do with as you like because
you buy power indirectly from it?  Even perhaps that the copy machine at
Kinko's is yours because you pay to make copies on it there?

The important distinction here being that I can freely choose not to do
business with Kinko's, the BPA, and the phone company (to use your
examples) and resonably expect that men with guns are *not* going to
come take me away. You can't say that about government institutions. Of
course, what this conversation really demonstrates is the absurdity of
the concept of so-called "public property."

Far be it from me to deny someone the right to not propagate. :)

However, keep in mind that if the geek guy and the geek girl (assuming 
they both have brains) fail to propagate, then we're losing more genes, 
and the non-brained masses still get larger because the non-brained 
masses haven't figured out how to prevent kids. :)

Just a thought.

Brent, I'm surprised you missed the point... um, ok lets use your 
analogy. Police Car = State IT and Taking a Spin = Cracking the System

In either case, yes I would have some curiosity about the use of my tax 
dollars. In the police case I guess I'd ask some mechanics if they think 
the city does good maintenance. In the latter case, I'd ask a bunch of 
smart IT folks who I consider reasonably likely to know the answer. (ie 
PLUG)

Sure, if I ask the mechanics about maintenance they might take it upon 
themselves to go steal police cars. Frankly I expect more from the 
people on this list.

Conversely, the people on the list expect me to not waste bandwidth. As 
such I'm about done with this topic, though obviously others are free to 
post more.

Intelligence isn't 100% genetic.  Besides, brilliant people aren't the
only ones who have an important impact out there.  Some
of the disabled keep the rest of us humble.  

I'll only avoid procreation naturally so long as I'm single or if I'm
married where there isn't the means to support another.  The sail boat,
etc., we all want doesn't count.  If you believe a higher power has the
authority to procreate you shouldn't interfere with the process
artificially since that means engaging in the act isn't open to Him.
He can defeat your birth control if he wants to, but what kind of person
are you if you get in His way for just a mere five minute thrill?
Maybe He won't bless your relationship after an act like that which
could mean breaking up or worse.

If the goal is to avoid procreation and you have a legitimate reason
to be aiming for that abstinence always works best.  Spock says logic
is only the beginning of wisdom.  We all need more than we can ever
simply know, though even this ironically is a challenge to come to
thanks to our limiting humanity.  Selflessness can be as, or even 
more, important than intelligence.

Just a thought.

Paul,

  The personal domain name is parked at godaddy. When they send me my login
name and password I'll be able to change the dns name servers myself. The
business domain name will be handled by Aracnet when I'm set up here and
ready to go (they'll remain as secondary name server).

Man, I cannot believe you actually posted a religious message, and one
that felt like it came to my doorstep, no less, on this list. Be that as
it may, though, your logic fails:

abstinence relies upon frail human abilities to work.

Death is the best form of avoiding procreation. Well, death by flambe,
as that also sterilizes you and prevents your sperm or eggs from being
used after your death.

Going Waaay OT in to the realm of interpretations of 'Humanae Vitae,' your 
foregoing does not interdict natural methods and even natural infertility 
which, though possible to correct by artificial means, is left in its natural 
(God-given?) condition. In this case, faith in (and obedience to) said higher 
power would be to embrace personal non-procreation, and move on with a deep 
devotion to a secular vocation (such as programming, engineering, or 
research) or, if one chooses to associate with kids, then one can be a good 
auntie, uncle, foster parent, adopter, or even a great school teacher or an 
inspiring coach.

  Funny about that. I just checked with betterwhois.com to see who is the
registrar for my business domain (I moved away from NSI the last time I
renewed the registration) and found a name that I do not recognize:
domaindiscover. They must have bought whomever I used; I no longer remember
who it was. Anyway, I digress

  Mail server's located here.

  Back to my question:

  The cache and server should be on hosts with two different IP addresses,
even if they're on the same physical machine. The cache is for only internal
network use (192.168.55/24). Bernstein recommends putting the server on a
world visible IP address. My 'Net IP address is assigned to one NIC in the
firewall, but with masquerading is used by all hosts on the internal
network.

  Does this mean that I can install tinydns on the same physical box as
dnscache, but assign the world visible IP address in tinydns-conf? The way I
read the Web page the answer appears to be "yes", but I want to confirm this
before I do anything. Otherwise, I suppose I need to physically install
tinydns on the second workstation.

Thanks,

The GPL is not a license to USE software, however.  You are not required
to have a license to USE anything that you have purchased.  You don't need
a license to read a book you've bought or give it to somebody else, loan
it out, xerox it at 300% to read from across the room, or sell it when
you're finished.  None of those things are exclusive rights to a copyright
holder and therefore none of them require a license from the copyright
holder to exercise.

However, distribution of copies IS an exclusive right of the copyright
holder and that right must be confered to you via license in order for you
to exercise it.

The GPL is a distribution license.  You don't need to agree to the GPL to
USE GPL software, only to redistribute it.

God should kill us?  That's a wish I won't echo.
I made a proprosition, the logic works if you accept self preservation,
I figure most people tend towards this.  The logic is fine for
reasonable people.  As far as religiosity, self preservation is a
secular pillar of civilized societies.  Without self preservation
societies crumble, look at the Roman Empire if you think I'm nuts.

I find any person's lack of distaste for an attack on the poor
disturbing.

domaindiscover is the DBA for buydomains.com. They are my registrar 
also, and have been a good company to work with.

  Aha! That looks familiar, Russ. Many thanks for the clarification. I've no
complaints about them or godaddy.

  Now to figure out how to replicate dns server info when the two name
servers are on different networks -- completely -- and one is not under my

The answer to your question is yes.  When you install tinydns you will bind it
to your outside ip (x.x.x.x:53) and your dnscache to your internal ip
(192.168.55.y:53).  There are certainly other options that could be accomplished
with port forwarding on your firewall, but generally the above is a simple
setup.

Seriously?  OK...


Your PLUG post of Aug 26, 07:46
-----------------------------------
Perhaps the state of Oregon would be one of our first clients. Maybe the
Speaker of the House herself would want to know just how much the
pirated software in her office alone is worth in fines (not to mention 
the embarassment... which is priceless).
------


Your next PLUG post, Aug 26, 08:08:
-----------------------------------
I'm curious about how much of the state's e-mail is being served off of
"lion". Also, is that machine doing anything else (serving up web-pages 
with IIS perhaps)? Finally, is "lion" fully patched? [snip] Also,
frankly anything else anyone can legally reveal about the server would
be interesting. Obviously, if they are running un-registered proprietary
software, well, that would be worth mentioning.
------


You describe the state as a potential client and go on to strongly imply
that disclosure of embarrassing information might advance your cause.  

After conveying this all-but-naked threat to a leader in our government,
you proceed to seize upon a mail header as justification to ask for 
help exposing security lapses and finding damaging information.  

>From your posts, a reasonable person would probably conclude that you
intended to use this information as leverage to sell the state your

That is not at all what I said. You were speaking that because God could
foil counter measures (birth control and whatnot), abstinence was the
only fully successful method.

But clearly if there is an all powerful God, abstinence is not a fully
succesful method, and even if there isn't, human virtue is too frail to
be fully successful for more than, you know, a few tenths of a
thousandth of one percent of the population.

Now, if you want a method of birth control which is fully successful
whether or not there is an all powerful God, you are speaking of the
method known as death. By flambe.

Actually, you made a bunch of pompous, religious statements.

And I made a response which is truly logical: dead people, especially
those who have died by fire, _cannot_ procreate. Do I suggest that we do
such? No. I thought we were talking about individual choices, so I at
most I was suggesting that if an individual wanted to make sure he or
she never procreated, his/her best bet would be to immolate themselves.
And these days, there being plenty of things to protest, you can get two
benefits for the price of one!

Ah, but he was responding to my post, which was stated as, and intended
as, a joke. I believe his seemed to me, at the time, intended also as a
joke.

Is it possible that in joking, he actually got to starting to wonder
about the security? Possibly not the best route to go, but it's
possible.

Of course, when the FBI is breaking down my door, they'll probably see
this email as evidence of collusion. *sigh* You know it's a bad time in
the history of civil rights when you can get terrified about the

Imply the disclosure of embarrassing information might advance my 
cause...of landing the state as a client. By publicly (PLUG) and 
directly saying so to the Speaker via bcc:.

OK. I follow the logic anyway.


 > After conveying this all-but-naked threat to a leader in our government,

Maybe it's the transition to the threat that we're misunderstanding one 
another. I've just asked that the damaging information be discussed 
openly on a publicly archived list-serve. Once that's done, it's done.

My idea of a threat implies an "or else". Like I'd take my new found 
information about how easy it is to crack the entire system and call up 
the speaker and threaten to crash the whole system if she doesn't do 
what I want. (whether that's pass a bill or hire me as a consultant).

I suppose I can't expect you to assume that I'm too morally upstanding 
to do that. But, well, first of all, you don't threaten people publicly 
about making something public. That's where it either doesn't make 
sense, or you're assuming I'm a moron.

Well, look, if the state is running their systems in an illegal and 
risky fashion (ie unlicensed and insecure) I may well use that fact to 
try to sell them a better system. I guess the "leverage" part reflects 
the point above about threat.

I can see how you could misread it the first time through. After several 
explicit explainations of my intent, though, you basically either 
believe I've got the best interests of my state in mind or that I'm 
lying and am just a gold-digger who's not bright enough to threaten 
people in private.

Frankly, if the bill had passed the senate, I'd have had a conversation 
with the Speaker's Chief of Staff. I'd have laid out the facts as I see 
them and tried to persuade him via reason.

I've worked with politicians during this campaign and I don't beleive 
threats are an effective way of influencing them. Sometimes you can use 
them to get their attention, but a quid pro quo with the speaker is stupid.

I suppose if I've been a little harsh this week, I guess it's because it 
seems like people are implying that I'd publicly threaten a high level 
politician and expect to get somewhere that way. ie that I'm a moron.

I apologize if I've treated people a bit harshly as a result. Thanks to 
all who helped me make it clear that I'm not threatening public 
officials. That kind of ambiguity is dangerous these days. Frankly, for 
all the faults and disagreements, I tell you this, Karen Minnis is a 
hard working servant of the state and I thank her for doing a difficult job.

Indeed.  At the risk of ruining the signal to noise ratio... I'm a bit
sick of hearing about the politics and how to get the hard-to-find Hot

On another note... don't suppose anybody has tried to get their

> What is the advantage of a fixed packet size as used in ATM?

There's a whole set of "lore" about this.  ATM was supposed to be able to be 
much faster than other kinds of transport.  You can see some of what they're 
doing from a few things:

1) small packet size (Europeans wanted 32 bytes, US wanted 64 bytes, so we all 
got 48 bytes).  This is something of a rumor (48 vs 64/32), but I'm fairly 
sure I read this in Tanenbaum's networking book.  Could have been somewhere 
else, but I think it was in Tanenbaum.  They wanted ATM to be used for 
telephony as well.  With that, you don't want big packets.  You want packets 
that are as small as you can get and you want latency that is as low as you 
can get.

2) fields in the packet are designed for "on the fly" switching.  An ATM 
fabric can be built with very dumb, but very fast, switches.  Each address 
comes in most significant bit order and can be used to trip binary (i.e. 
left/right) switches as the packet data flows past (seen the hardware to do 
it, this was the original intent).  The idea was that you'd be able to switch 
from network to network at least as fast as the data was transmitted.  I.e. 
there was less than a packet latency (sometimes much less) through a switch.  
This makes for very low latency compared to IP-based networks where you have 
to buffer the whole packet (to an extent) before you send it on.

3) the fixed packet ("cell" I believe is the ATM terminology) also apparently 
helps keep latencies low.  Every packet is the same size, so buffer sizes are 
just multiples of a packet size.  I only have vague memories of why this was 
a good thing.  Something to do with buffers and cheaper hardware as well as 
helping with latency.  Not sure if I remember this correctly.

ATM has a lot of really interesting ideas in it, but it never hit the volume 
needed to make it cheap.  With gigabit ethernet at a buck a port, there's 
really no point to ATM any more.  Remember FDDI?

TCP packets are retransmitted.  All the others are "fire and forget".

Switches are good.  I run most of my internal network at 10Mbps simply because 
I've got the hardware (i.e. paid for) and I rarely have much traffic between 
machines.  Nearly all network traffic is out the cable modem.  Thus, I'm 
limited to whatever Comcast decides to give me today.  That's a lot less than 
10Mbps and will be for a while.

IP addresses are a scarce resource now.  There's less than 2^32 total (some 
ranges are completely removed).  With IPv6, this problem will go away until 
someone figures out how to use sparse addressing for some really interesting 
problem.  Then we'll be back to scarcity.

Wholesale bandwidth prices are often below cost.  When the Internet dot.bomb 
hit, a lot of companies folded and those that remained picked up dark fiber 
and network centers at pennies on the dollar.  A friend of mine bought a 
fully equiped NOC room (racks, raised floor, network patch panel, huge UPS, 
AC etc.) for $25 from Worldcom because they were abandoning the building his 
office was in.  It was $25 because that is what he had in his pocket when he 
talked to the Worldcom rep.  Really.  Reality is stranger than fiction.

So, don't take the weird bandwidth costs as dogma at this point.  A lot of 
stuff is filling up, but there's still a lot of dark fiber left.  The low 
hanging fruit's probably gone though.

I doubt it.  Often the larger cities have worse bandwidth because the 
equipment is older, there's less of it, and things were not wired for the 
needed capacity.  In the rural areas (if you can get broadband), you might be 
one of three people on a fairly large pipe to a POP that was put in one or 
two years ago.

For DSL, you have all kinds of factors.  When was the copper put in?  What 
kind of DSLAM do they have?  When was the POP built?  What is the backhaul 
line to the main trunk?  Bad coppy will cause DSL to be crappy.  I had a DSL 
line once that was really good, but my neighbor had poor service.  I had new 
copper run less than five years before and he was on one of the original copy 
lines from 1957 when the development was built.  His DSL modem was constantly 
dropping and retraining.

There are so many factors involved that it is pretty difficult to say that any 
one thing is the key factor.

Best,
Kyle

Is this paper work required if no funds were needed to acquire the
software?  How about if the software was purchased under a blanket
license (I think M$ will sell you a multi-million dollar license that
will allow you to install all of their software on all of your
machines)?

The GPL does cover _use_, near the end of version 2 there is whole
section defining your limitations of use.  It says that you can use the
software, but you can't hold the author liable for what the software
does or doesn't do, or for your inability to figure out how to use and
repair the software.



> You are not required
> to have a license to USE anything that you have purchased.

Not true, most software has an End User License Agreement (sometimes
located in a file called "copyright") which the user has to agree to
before _using_ the software.  The GPL may be incorporated into the EULA
(or the copyright -- the two seem interchangeable at this point), but
there can be more to it than just that. 

The most common example of a EULA that we see is when renting
proprietary software. FrontPage comes to mind; you must agree not to
create content that is negative toward the M$ spiderweb.  This is
obviously a restriction on the use of the software.  There is usually
some phrase about "no reverse engineering", too.  This is another
restriction on the use of the software.

The limitation imposed by the GPL is the responsibility of _using_ the
software.  You can't sue anybody if your use of the software causes you
or any one else any harm.  Most proprietary software has the same
limitation.

This is only because of the particular copyright that the author chose,
or was forced to choose.  I haven't published anything, but I bet that
the publishers force the authors to use the standard copyright: "All
rights reserved.  Reproductions of any kind must have permission from
the author."  I know that this standard doesn't hold up in court (which
is how you got the right to blow it up 300%), but it is still used.

I disagree.  To quote the GPL version 2 "Activities other than copying,
distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are
outside its scope."  However, Sections 11 and 12 seems to cover the
_use_ limitations as well.

Seems to me that the modification part is very important too.  The GPL
is definitely restrictive when it comes to modifying software.  You have
to document your changes, and you can't claim the entire work as your
own.

That is my interpretation, anyway.

For Mailman lists, I prefer to filter on the X-BeenThere header, since
experience has shown that other headers can, on very rare occasions, get
munged.

At least she's working for a company that's doing it's worst in the US
and will sponsor you into their home country, Canada.  I hear that two
thirds of the tech jobs in the US have moved to Canada, possibly never
to return to the US, with smaller numbers to India (Sources: CBC,

Bringing us back to Linux related topics (no more Geek girls). Has
anyone tried installing the 2.6 kernels under Gentoo? If so, what sort
of success have you had with the low latency stuff?

If you don't use Gentoo what do you use? Have you tried the 2.6 kernel
on that?

It's really pretty easy to get it going.

emerge module-init-tools sets things up so you can use the module tools
with both 2.6 and 2.4 ... I don't know if they modify the path depending
on the version you boot up with, rename files back and forth, or what...
but it works.  :-)

modules got some new names, my wireless NIC doesn't have driver support
yet (well... it does... they just won't compile) ....

Oh, and it's the fastest damned kernel I've seen yet.  I don't know
*how* they did it, but I am definitely seeing an increase in speed.

ACPI, cpufreq, and low latency stuff are all working as designed.  With
cpufreq working, my batter now lasts 30 minutes longer in Linux than it
does in Windoze.

I kinda like the new sysfs interface, too... it's decent.

Make sure you enable PTYs when you build it... there are a bunch of
gotcha's in the kernel config you need to be aware of (google around).

If you have an nvidia video card/chip... just emerge the latest nvidia
drivers and the proper patches will be applied automagically.

Overall, I really like it.  :-)

Oh, and the choices get even worse when you add in SpamAssassin calls.
The question is, where in .procmailrc do you call spamc (or
spamassassin)?

On my home system -- which has a definitely under-utilized cpu -- it
doesn't make much difference. I call spamassassin on any mail that
wants to enter my inbox.

On a shared system, however, it's worthwhile doing some for-sure
filtering before passing messages to the cpu-cycle-sucking spam
filters. Here's the pseudo-logic of my .procmailrc:

1. Identify and file away system mail (root, postmaster, ...), since
   it's unlikely to be spam

2. Identify and file away mail from moderated mailing lists; it's also
   unlikely to be spam

3. Call spamassassin; file away spam

4. Identify and file away mail from unmoderated mailing lists that
   didn't get marked as spam.

5. Drop the rest into my inbox.

By putting spamassassin in position 3 instead of 1, I figure I save a
few hundred (sometimes a thousand) needless invocations of
spamassassin.

What damaging information?  The damaging information you proposed to
produce by unethical exploration of state servers? 

If you approach a politician and propose to promote the public
discussion of embarrassing information, that's not an offer that will be
much welcomed.  Whether doing so is your right as a citizen or a
criminal act depends in large part on the provenance of the information.

If the information you want to discuss is already public or can be
properly acquired, do what you want and let the will of the public
prevail. But if you're proposing to acquire *privileged* information by
*unethical* means, proposing to disclose it in public *is* a threat. 

The fact that you're angling for business at the same time makes it look
even worse.  You probably didn't *intend* to suggest a quid pro quo, but
that's exactly what a reasonable person would think you've done.

That's almost exactly what your suggestion sounded like.  Except for the
"crashing the system" part... but you weren't going to *crash* the
system, you were just promoting a frank and open exploration of its
security flaws and let the chips fall where they may.

If you aren't able to acknowledge the seriousness of what what you

A threat does not have to be rational in order to be credible.

You're assuming that a rational explanation for your actions is relevant
or necessary. Honestly, I'm at a complete loss to explain what you did. 
I can't imagine how you thought you were advancing any cause at all.  


> Well, look, if the state is running their systems in an illegal and

That's a pretty big "if" you've got there.

Even assuming your unsupported conclusion as established fact...

...your hubris is astonishing.  Are you really *that* much smarter than
the army of IT professionals the state already employs?  If I were the
state, I'd be skeptical of anyone green enough to claim he can rebuild
and improve a complex system without having examined it in any detail.


> I can see how you could misread it the first time through. After several

I value results more than intentions.  I can't imagine what you
*intended* to accomplish, but I'll tell you loud and clear what I think
you did: I think you embarrassed this community.

I promote open source by doing the hard work of listening to people's
needs and delivering services they care enough about to actually pay
for.  As such, I feel entitled to point out that exercising a greater
level of responsibility will go a lot further to promote open source
than attempting to humiliate influential people in public.

I'm not attempting to plumb the depths of your psyche, David.  I'm
taking exception with your irresponsible behavior.  That's it.  I don't
claim to know (nor do I *care* to know) what your state of mind was.

Not implying, stating. You did it. You publicly threatened a high level
politician.  If you don't do anything else, I'd strongly consider
sending her an apology.


> and expect to get somewhere that way. ie that I'm a moron.

I happen to *know* you're smart guy.  Smart people make mistakes too. 
It takes character to admit that you screwed up.  

I'm sure I've made whatever point I'm likely to make in this forum.  If
you wish to discuss this further, I'd be happy to do so off-list.

It might feel like 2/3 of the tech jobs in the US have been moved to 
Canada, but I really doubt that it's anywhere near that many (I'd be 
really surprised if even 5% have been moved there).  Most 
outsourcing is still going to India.  Canada is just now becoming an 
outsourcing destination because the Canadian government is offering incentives 
for hiring tech workers (so I hear),  something that the US should probably 
consider, but most likely won't till it's too late.  And this Canadian 
move is mostly to try to perserve their tech jobs because the government 
there is afraid of the longterm effects of outsourcing tech jobs to India
(can't remember where I read this, but it's been in the last few weeks).
In the long term, though, even with the incentives, Canadian labor will 
still be several times more expensive than labor in India or China.

BTW: Did you know that until about a week ago, whenever Intel hired an 
employee to work in any of their Washington County facilities that the 
company had to pay the county $1000/new hire!  They finally dropped this 
ridiculous 'employment tax' a week or two ago.  It certainly took the 
county long enough to come to their senses and realize that "gee, maybe 
we shouldn't penalize companies for hiring people now that the economy is 
in the dumpster".  Talk about encouraging oursourcing!

I do have an nvidia card, but I don't use 3D on it anymore. Does the
'nv' driver work just as well for 2D or should I install it?

Woo hoo! I'll give it a shot then. I've been running Gentoo for about a
month now and thus far I really like it. I may switch my Redhat box over
to Gentoo as well.

The openldap and cryus-sasl packages are the client libraries.  Not the 
servers.  libuser uses them to do authentication to LDAP directories. 
evolution uses them to do LDAP address books and may use SASL for 
protocol authentication.  If you don't use LDAP, you probably can remove 
them.

On the other hand, they aren't that big compared to evolution and all of 
its GNOME dependencies.

Cool - I didn't actually check those, though.  I treat my Gentoo
differently than most folks... I pretty much just use Linux, and Gentoo
is the distro on this because it makes it easier to quickly compile lots
of stuff....

Do you know how they got it so the mod utilities work on both kernel
versions?

I've never actually even gotten the nv driver to work on any of my
systems... an nForce board, TNT2 board, and this GeForce2 Go.  VESA
works, but nv doesn't.  So I always install the proprietary nVidia
drivers.  I haven't heard anything good about the nv driver - not in
performance, stability, or usability.  IMHO, you should go ahead and
install the nvidia-kernel and nvidia-glx packages (emerge 'em from
~x86).  Be aware you need to re-emerge the kernel package whenever you
switch from one kernel to another and it builds against whatever kernel
version you have sitting in /usr/src/linux.

Going to have to agree to disagree here. But yeah, I prolly bruised some 
egos along the way. If you missed it in the earlier e-mail I'll state it 
again publicly: Karen Minnis is a decent person doing her best in a 
difficult job. She makes mistakes like the rest of us. She made a 
mistake on HB 2892. Life goes on.

Cool. I screw up all the time. One old guy I read about described his 
whole life as one mistake after another. We err, we make corrections... 
as for me I'm still trying to find out if I have character or if it's 
just that I am a character... :-D

Ok, a couple of things. The definition "tech jobs" of rather broad. Call
center folk are "tech jobs" as are product design engineers and the IT
person in a momNpop. There is a big difference between these folks, and I
don't want to offend call center folks too much, but if you're reading this,
you're probably not one of the folks who I'm basically calling human IVRs

Call centers? /wave, gone to Canada or India if the company doesn't care
(aka Dell) if their customers can understand their tech support.

You know that whole "stream" thing in Beaverton? Yeah, the one that had 2
sites, now has one that is pretty empty. . . Guess where those jobs went?
Yup. Canada. I believe direct tv is also in Canada right now. Granted, India
is getting a lot, but a lot of jobs are going to Canada for the primary
reason that they speak English well. That and Canadian companies can offer
bigger bribes / swag to whoever picks the location of the call center. The
Canadian goverment also offers a REALLY nice tax advantage to companies
coming to it for the first couple of years, who can proceed to pull an
enron, fire all their employees (to get rid of that whole seniority and
raise issue), wait a 2 months and the same group of folks start a new
company to do the same thing over again.

What does it comes down to?
Canada gives bigger kickbacks, India is a lot cheaper. I'd hate to classify
"tech jobs" as most phone support, because most companies view their support
lines as a way to deflect RMAs and / or prevent / frustrate the customer
into not calling again. Sad, but true (ever tried calling dell support?).
Dummy phone support goes to India, tier 2 / escalations can always go to
Canada or stay here. Vast majority is Tier 1 though.
After all, most tech support isn't even that demanding, you could train
crackheads off the street to answer phones and to follow a cable isp's 10
step to reconnection guide. If you've ever called comcast's tier 1, you know
what I mean. Tier 2 gets passed calls from people who don't even HAVE cable
internet.
Most people don't care enough to complain about crap tech support, nor buy
products from a competitor who has better tech support - and since companies
want to save money . . . it isn't like this is going to change.

As a side note btw, apparantly the Republican Party just outsourced
fundraising to call centers in India. Not making a political statement or
whatever, just thought it was interesting.




Programmers? /wave, Canada, Ireland, or India.

Again, India is dirt cheap, but you get what you pay for. I've heard nothing
but nightmares from companies who outsourced programming to Indian
companies.

IT? Stays here, but there really is a wide gamut of "IT folk" - sure there
are a lot of actual sysadmins but the majority of small businesses have an
IT dept that consists of the guy who sat the closest to the printer. There
again, there isn't exactly room for an IT professional to move in. Windows
really makes it simple to set up AD on a 2k box, set up 100 users and assign
them to global groups. I could teach my 12 year old sister to do that
competently. 2k is fairly stable too. Sure flame on, but for the average
small business 2k (I'm not going to even mention 2003 Server) is stable
ENOUGH. The company doesn't see the need to change because the amount of
downtime is acceptable. They don't care enough to fix it. I've been to
places that haven't had their internal email working for a week and people
weren't saying "FIX IT NOW!!".
So, in a nutshell, computer morons / people who are not IT professionals get
IT jobs here for the most part, while your boss hires his nephew to "help" a
real sysadmin. Seriously, with windows 2k3, and it's nifty "configure your
server" startup wizard screen and the current state of the economy, there
aren't people leaving, but but little new is opening up which pretty much
means the same thing for the job market. Ulcers and unemployed folks.



Engineers, etc, are probably going to stay here, or American companies are
going to buy ideas from overseas. Pretty simple, but there isn't a whole lot
of folks designing new products compared to the total number of tech people.


Fab / assembly folks? Probably going somewhere in Asia, Canada costs too
much to relocate, and quite a bit of this stuff is in Asia already, it isn't
like those plants are going to be left standing with nothing to do when
their costs are dramatically cheaper (say, costs related to those pesky US
environmental laws, etc) Screwing together a computer / wireless AP isn't
exactly the most technically demanding job. Mexico and the East have those.
There isn't an advantage to having the person speak English, so it won't be
placed there for financial reasons.

Yeah, I'm bitter, but come on, you've all heard the horror stories and you
know they are true. I'm not sure if I missed any major groups; phone folks,
IT, programmers, engineers, fab and assembly folks. I think I've pretty much
got them all. Sure people like tech writers will have work, but again, a
minority.
Now distillers I hear are going to be making a killing in the next couple of
years ;)
</soapbox>


Phil - I didn't know about the intel thing, but it really doesn't surprise
me. Also makes me wonder how the state is planning on collecting the
additional tax money from those folks who are unemployed but not on
unemployment.

Subject: [PLUG] debian and kernel2.6 test
Message-ID: <1062064211.560.15.camel@localhost>

Hi,

I'm not one to try out development kernels, really, but today I did.
Another reason I'm not one to try out development kernels is I very much
dislike compiling kernels. So when I chose to try 2.6 test2, I got a
binary image (apt-get install kernel-image-2.6test2-1 I believe). And
despite having tried to read lkml for about 3 months, I'm not entirely
sure how to go about gathering enough data to file a bug report (or
determine if it is a bug or a misconfiguration). Kernels are a bit
outside the area of my knowledge.

So folks, help.

With 2.6 installed, I turn on the machine and get to LILO, and choose my
2.6, which has an initrd (my current, working kernel does not). It says
"Loading TestLinux ...................... BIOS info received" (not sure
about info received, but it definitely says something about the BIOS,
and then it turns blank.

2 times out of 3, gdm comes up 30 seconds later, which is pretty damn
quick, I'll admit. The third time out of three, the computer, a laptop,
turns itself off.

Checking dmesg, I don't find any obvious errors, though it says it's
using ACPI, and my last kernel tends to say something along the lines of
"detecting dell, broken ACPI, turning off and using emulation." 

It also says it's using video mode 317. I've been using 791 for a while
for no apparent reason than that it was in a lilo.conf I found and it
worked and I left it.

Everything else, though different from the 2.4 messages, seems okay. It
gets my ps2 mouse (actually a touchpad, but happy as a ps2 mouse) and it
loads usb support and notices my usbmouse. And that's the end of the
dmesg output.

But neither of my mice is working when I get to gdm. And if I go to a
virtual terminal, I get bizarre random color bitmaps. They look
identical to what I normally get for half a second going to a virtual
terminal, ever since I started using the actual driver for this video
card (or, I think it's the actual driver -- ati, it's an ati rage pro).
When I was using vesa, it didn't get the color bitmaps, but they go away
in half a second, and using the driver let's me use the xv extensions.
But here, those bitmaps don't go away. I can log in, because I did, but
I can't see anything happening. clear, reset, ctrl-l, make no
difference.

Back in X, my mice aren't working. Everything else seems fine. 

I checked lsmod, while seeing if any modules were missing, and there
were a TON of modules I'd never heard of without easily comprehensible
names. 

Anybody have any ideas?

Jeff

Okay, so I've become dyslexic recently. My dell has a broken APIC, not
ACPI. That's one problem replaced.

yeah, no other kernel notes its video mode, and the 791 actually has
been commented out for a little while, so that might be it. I'll have to
look into what it should be.

In addition I noticed that usb-uhci isn't loaded in 2.6, although
there's no error about it in dmesg. I wonder if it's been replaced with
something else. Also, my 2.4 dmesg shows a recognition of my mouse,
specifically, as input0, and my 2.6 shows nothing of the kind. It's
still odd that my ps2 mouse doesn't work, as that's a standard device.

While under 2.6, I tried less -f /dev/psaux and less -f /dev/input/mice
and got nothing out of either of them.

Also...having just gone from another kernel to a stock debian kernel
image, does anyone know how to get the penguin back at the top of the
bootup messages. =) I miss him.

Okay, so this was a big part of it. I got the 791 from Knoppix, and with
the Knoppix kernel it looks really nice, but with the debian 2.6 kernel
it breaks it, and with debian's 2.4 kernel it ignores it and looks
awful. mode = ask, extended, ext, normal. ALl of them look awful that
I've seen, and I don't know how to get that nice small, but easily
readable text...actually, I think it was just small and not monospaced.
Not sure. If anyone has a nice mode for bootup, let me know.

And this was a module name change, under 2.6 it's uhci-hcd, why, I do
not know. But the ps/2 mouse still does not work, which is most odd.

However, I am sending this to you under Linux 2.6.0 test 2, and let me
assure you all, it seems VERY fast. I'm hoping the reports for
OpenOffice.org 1.1 and GNOME 2.4 being significantly faster as well are
true, because if they are, I will be very very happy.

Sorry to take so long in responding; we're all too busy arguing
over women & jobs here. ;-)

If this is an *exact* transcription of your /etc/fstab file, I suspect
part of the trouble is that you've misspelled ``kudzu" on that line. I'd
also doublecheck the spelling of your mountpoint: you've called it
both ``firewire" & ``firedrive" in this email.

Otherwise, based at my own /etc/fstab file, try changing ``owner" to
``users". That's solved the problem for me in the past. And make sure
that the mountpoint has the correct permissions & ownerships.

I am looking for a networking card of the sort that will allow me to 'hit' my

But one thing I do first is take each product box to a pay phone bank.

I select two boxes and dial two 800 numbers from the boxes. Whoever answers 
first 'wins' the first round (I still call the second number back,) and I 
evaluate the company based on:

- Can I get out of v-mail jail and talk to a live person?
- What is the hold time for 'prospective customers' versus tech support once 
you've already bought the product ...
- Is the 'live' person intelligible, friendy, and knowlegable?

I then let the companies know I am testing their customer service AS A 
CONDITION of buying one brand in favor of another.

On Topic: I also let them know that I am a Linux user and expect them to have 
Linux drivers on their support disk. No, not on the website only, because if 
I'm trying to CONNECT to the Internet and something doesn't work, I CAN'T 
read the fix & download the driver off the website ... !

Set the ftp to use PASV, and it should work fine without any changes
to the firewall. However, I'd replace the FTP client with SFTP. putty
has good tools.

Yeah, those job are going or already gone, but I'm not too worried about 
them -they're not really very good paying jobs.

It's like this silly baseball stadium: They keep saying that it will 
create jobs.  Sure it will create something like 15 really good paying 
jobs for players (that's if they manage to get a team) who really have no 
connection to the area and then it 
will create another couple of hundred minimum wage jobs.  Of course it 
will also create construction jobs initially, but in the lone run it's 
minimum wage jobs.

Can't say as I blame'em.  Engineering/programming jobs are high paying  
(or used to be) and thus are good to have in your economy (and tax base).

Oregon's problem isn't that we're not paying enough income,property and/or 
sales tax, it's that we've lost a lot of these high paying engineering 
jobs - hey, I used to pay several thousand dollars / year to Oregon in 
Income tax, but for the last year and a half or so I haven't been paying 
anything (no income) and I know lots of folks in the same situation.

Hardware engineering jobs are going to India too.  They're making a 
push to do a lot of chip and embedded design over there.
...No, it's not just the programming jobs going over.

An unemployment tax of course.

...but in the end, I doubt that even in five years that 2/3 of tech jobs 
(even if you include call center jobs) will have left America.  1/3 would 
probably be more like it (and that's bad enough).

Probably.  The state's IT workers aren't the brightest lights on 
the Christmas tree, if you get my drift....

They're members of a public employee union.  Performance -- or 
even competence -- is not a job requirement.

I saw a lot of ignorant MCSEs with inflated egos when I worked

Update time.  I've been playing with this (above) in the last week 
or so, and have made a small amount of progress.

Right now my roadblock is a problem importing USGS DEMs into 
GRASS.  r.in.gdal segfaults when I try.  I found a bug report 
that only partially explains it; maybe there's enough info there 
to help, maybe not.

I'll post again when I've made some progress.  In the meantime 
I've run across all kinds of links to 'doze progs that supposedly 
create stunning 3D visualizations directly from USGS data.

And the grunt on the telephone will do what with this information?

 From working as a telephone grunt, I can tell you that most information 
flows from the top down in these types of organizations. There isn't 
usually much of a mechanism to send information back up from the phone 
banks. Especially when the tech support is outsourced. There's even less 
of a chance that your requirement will make it to anyone who makes a 
difference when the person doing the tech support doesn't even work for 
the company you are buying the product from.

Sad but true.

This was a deal that Intel negotiated with Washington County. Part of 
this deal was that Intel was given $200 M in tax breaks, and that after 
they play off several states, and foreign markets, to find the best 
deal. No matter how much Oregon caves in, Intel will eventually move 
completely offshore to placate the shareholders.

I'll second this one.  It is an excellent guide, and when you're

advanced bash scripting guide, which is also excellent.

Often, yes.  It has to do with several factors: money, security,
control, eg: bureaucracy. Simply eliminating one of those factors
doesn't necessarily eliminate the paperwork.

What do you mean? I was making $38k per year when I worked for Symantec, 
as a tech support engineer. $38k is a respectable income.

Not a single person in the facility, from the front desk receptionist on 
up, made less than 15k per year, and that was in Eugene, in 1999. 
Starting wage when I was hired (1993) was $17k for Technical Support 
Analyst.

Of course, I think these have changed dramatically since Symantec 
outsources their consumer tech support services.

Yes, it will create some minimum wage jobs, but it will also create some 
jobs, besides players, that make significantly more than minimum wage. 
Have you seen what it takes in terms of jobs to support those 15 players?

The estimates are around 100 to 250 jobs just in the stadium, then 
there's additional business for surrounding businesses. Those truck 
drivers that deliver beer to 150+ home games per year don't make minimum 
wage.

That depends upon what you mean by privileged and public.  A server
attached to the Internet is by definition public.  Running nmap against
it to see what ports are open and perhaps determine what software is on
it is not unethical.  It might be illegal, but legality and ethics have
about as large an intersection as hot girls with big brains (apologies
to the OP of that comment).

I for one, having a least a marginal sense of humor, didn't read the

who did should probably take a week off.

Let us all be assured that it doesn't take a discussion on a
not-so-widely-circulated mailing list to attract a hacker.  I would say
that openly posting such info here would have exactly nil effect on
whether the state's systems get attacked or not.  Personally, I find the
idea that confidential information, perhaps regarding you or myself
resides on unsecured systems.  If they *are* secure, then discussing
them openly shouldn't be a problem, should it?  The fact that even
*asking* about it raised such an alarm suggests that perhaps a lot of
people are afraid that the systems aren't secure.  Now *I'm* alarmed.

Comments about state workers aside, what makes you think numbers amounts
to competence?  If anything the opposite is true.  Perhaps you should
read "The Mythical Man-Month" to get a better idea of what I'm referring
to.  

Additionally, as the number of staff increases, the level of
accountability decreases fairly proportionately.  If the system were
hacked, who would be to blame (besides the hacker)?  Probably no one in
particular.

That depends.  Politicians often respond to nothing else.  I don't think
that's the general case, but often it is.  The speaker's ridiculous
position certainly suggests that perhaps she is among those for whom
only public ridicule (or corporate money) has any influence.

I must have missed that.  Not being a smart-ass here, but how about
reposting that bit for my edification.  I've scoured David's emails for
the last few days and I thought I'd read them all, but apparently I
missed the one with the actual threat in it.

OK, that's about $10K more than I figured tech support folks were 
making...  

But let's look at it from a different angle:
I'm sure you'll agree that tech support call centers do very little to add 
to the 'state of the art' of the industry.  It's the innovation jobs that 
I'm more worried about.  Not only because they pay more, but because if we 
lose those jobs here then the 'tech center of gravity' will have moved 
elsewhere.  Right now the 'tech center of gravity' is still in the US,  
but as we lose the design jobs (software/hardware) it starts moving elsewhere 
and it becomes a feedback loop: as more innovation jobs are lost it speeds 
up the process of tech job loss.  Why?  One reason would be that the 
education infrastructure would adjust - who right now would recommend that 
a highschool student get a CS degree?  It's getting to the point where I 
would dissuade highschool students from getting engineering degrees at 
all unless that's what they _really_ wanted to do.  So our colleges and 
universities move away from CS & engineering as 
a focus and more to Marketing, Law, Dentistry, etc.  And from there the 
Highschools adjust as well... and you can see that the longer that this 
goes on, the worse it would get.

Perhaps, but what are the opportunity costs?  What other things could have 
been done with that money?  The imperical evidence for sports stadiums 
improving local economies is pretty spotty.  I really don't think the 
government should be in that business - but now we're going way off topic.

Some of them-thar non-mechanical types are kidnapping mechanical engineering 
terms, like 'engine' when used as in 'search engine.'

The link below will help us remember what we ought to think of when we use the 
word ENGINE ...

(great photos, too...)

----------  FWD  ----------

Amazing efficinency - almost unbelievable in fact.
This is approaching hot fuel cell efficiency in 60% range..

I bet the oiled crosshead helps efficiency greatly since side drag of
pistons against cylinders is a terrible friction problem in most engines.

We're talking titanic sized machinery !

If the Windows box allows inbound RDP connections, then rdesktop will
do what you want.

  http:///www.rdesktop.org/

It compiles against the OpenSSL libs, so you can get encrypted
connections over the network (again, depending on how the W2K box is
configured).

It ships with Red Hat 8.0 and 9, and I'd be highly surprised if there
weren't a .deb for it.

If you're running Red Hat 7.x, I've got a spec file for building an
roll-your-own rpm:

Message-ID: <45741.207.173.0.68.1062104764.squirrel@webmail.woo-hoo.com>

Is there any way to make Postfix not perform the body_checks (perhaps any
anti-UCE checks) for local users sending mail(particularly root)?

Here's my current problem.  I have a cron job that (with pluggers' help)
emails me every time Postfix rejects a message for any reason.  So a spam
comes in which is rejected for a body check reason "e.g. buy v1agr@ or
die!!".  No problem yet.  This text gets logged as normal in
/etc/log/maillog with the offending line, including the offensive text. 
My script then tries to email the log exerpt (grep 'reject'
/etc/log/maillog) as root but is then bounced by Postfix again, because
-suprise!- it has spam content.
Not the end of the world, but I would like to exempt root or certain local
users, from being subject to the body_checks filter.  Or any other
workaround that may fix it.  Note that I already have a white list file
called permit-domains ala Rich & Ed's suggestions.  That works great
_except_ that it does not seem to bypass the body_checks file- they still
happen regardless of the whitelist permission.

Thanks!

AT&T VNC or Real VNC work well and there are HOWTO documents to tell you

Paul,

  None that work as advertised. I have a regex that is supposed to solve the
problem, but it doesn't.

  My mail log is mailed to me by root every morning. When there's a
body_check rule cited in the report it comes through anyway -- as a rejected
mail message sent by MAILER-DAEMON. :-) I've learned to live happily with
this.

   What frustrates me is when spam comes in with a string in the body that
should have rejected it, but I cannot send out the spam report to the
originating ISP because now postfix won't let it out! This usually -- but
not always -- is with an html-formatted message with random characters
embedded in the words. That _should_ be rejected, but sometimes is not. Pine
translates the html to plain, ASCII text and that triggers the rule on the
way back out. Sigh.

Message-ID: <200308282210.h7SMAqx30374@gate.daniloff.com>

Hello Linux folkz,
I've got some hair pulling situation 
with Crossover Office 1.3.1 in my SuSE 8.2 distro.
After its installation I tried to execute
OfficeSetup from Kmenu in KDE.
Crossover start up creen shows:
"Unable to get list of installed applications
child process exited abnormally".
And it dies.
I tried to install XOffice as a regular user
and as a root with the same final result.
On SuSE8.1 and older ones the same 1.3.1 version of
XOffice installs and works perfectly.
Could somebody please give me a hand with this issue.
Many thanks in advance.
Alex

Use rdesktop on linux if you have configured your windows 2000
servers with the 2 user admin version of windows terminal server.

Use VNC for basic cross platform remote control between windows and
*nix. www.tightvnc.org and www.tridiavnc.com reportedly work well.

Does anyone have a comparison between tightvnc and tridiavnc?

What do you mean?

Just glancing at the TridiaVNC fact-sheet, it seems it supports.... drum
roll please.... zlib compression.

Yippee.

TightVNC supports, among others, jpeg compression... meaning it'll work
quite a bit better over a low-bandwidth connection.  It also processes
mouse events locally, meaning there's less of a lag with the mouse
cursor... dunno about Tridia.

I'd just go with TightVNC, personally.  Actually, I do just go with
TightVNC.  :-)

Actually it was quite funny... but for some reason I figured that you had
a sekrit script or mail client app that would decode it automatically.  I
mean, it sounds like a reasonable work-around :) ;)

Speaking from ignorance...

It seems like remote administration from Windows is a 2 part
solution:

1) Connect to remote network using some VNC that implements PPTP (tool1).
2) Establish remote connection to server desktop (tool2)

Tridiavnc advertises itself like a desktop, but has VNC in the name
so I was hoping it might be an "all in one" tool.

I had the exact same problem in Gentoo. 

Look at this file: ~/home/.crossover/config  

There is a line that reads: "LDAssumeKernel=2.4.2"

Try changing the Kernel version to match your kernel. If this doesn't
work try searching their support area. They should have something there
about it.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0308281539560.14690@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I'm stumped. I've installed Poseidon-for-UML-1.6 and now I want to use it
to develop a model. It fires up just fine, but the window it opens for
itself is larger than the visible portion of the screen -- except at the
bottom. Because the top frame of the window is hidden I cannot move it down
even if I shrink the bottom upwards. As the app opens now, I cannot access
the menu on the top or any of the window control widgets.

  There's a shell script that invokes the application, but I don't see any
place in there where I can specify a window size. It does not open a virtual
console so the aterm options -- specifically the geometry option -- are
ineffective.

  I'd greatly appreciate some ideas on how to control the opening window
size.

TIA,

Message-ID: <1062112069.559.5.camel@localhost>

hi,

I know there are at least a couple of you out there using Mandrake. I
remember its startup as being very pretty and being very easy to see
when something fails because of the little green [OK] and red [FAILED]
messages. And I'm trying to do that myself on my debian distribution,
because while Debian is great, it's not always pretty.

So, if you're a mandrake user and know which script under /etc has
control over running other scripts and determining if they work, could
you send me that script? Otherwise, could you send me /etc/inittab and
the rc script, which in Debian is under /etc/init.d/rc but is probably
elsewhere on Mandrake? I can track down the chain of command from those
two. I spent some time on the web, but found little.

This isn't an answer to your question, but may be a partial solution to
your problem -

What Windowmanager are you using?  I think most these days allow you to
hold down the ALT key and drag the window around with the primary mouse
key.. from anywhere, as though you were pulling on the title bar.

>From there maybe you can do a Remember Window Size and Position type

This sounds the same as a redhat boot.  Try looking for

  Good thought, Rob. It's xfwm -- the native wm that comes with xfce. I'll
give it a try and report back.

  Ta-da! Woiks. I completely forgot about the alt-drag capability.

Yep, the .deb works well (unstable).  A long time ago, VNC didn't have
clipboard exchange, but rdesktop did.  It also does real user login,
instead of remote control of the desktop.  It is also a much more
responsive way to remotely interact with the windows GUI.  There are
rumors of hooking in sound too.  (So you can hear your server crash?)

Ken,

	I happen to know MANY highly qualified IT professionals (and I do
mean professionals in the best sense of the term) at the State of Oregon and
they're some of the best people I've ever had the opportunity to work with. 

I've lurked for quite some time on this thread. It really bothered me how
running an nmap scan on lion at DAS is considered okay - almost like it's
your civil duty. These admins have enough to do trying to keep the bad guys
out. If you're concerned about whether or not the system is secured
adequately, take it up with the auditors. That's their job. This sort of
activity has been, and is still, considered malicious. Repeated scanning
results in logs being turned over to the authorities.

I respect the cause that you all fight for. Open Source software most
definitely has it's advantages. Linux is a rock-solid OS. The State could
save millions by replacing certain systems with OSS and ditching expensive
proprietary software. But I do not, nor will I ever, subscribe to the notion
that OSS or Linux is the "be all, end all" of software. Everything has a
place. There's balance in there somewhere.

Open Source software will succeed; on its merits, not through legislation.
Just as NO ONE who has ever stood up to Microsoft and tried to compete
against it on the same terms has ever won. They are crushed under the wheels
of Microsoft's market domination. But OSS and Linux are not on the same
playing field. It'll achieve dominance on it's own; it'll just take time. I
use OSS (mainly Linux) regularly and champion its merits whenever I can.

[long snip]

Please go back and re-read the thread.  I have NEVER advocated 
scanning lion, and even criticised David for his post hinting 
that we should.

Nor do I, and I have never said that it is.

OSS will eventually succeed on its merits.  But it can he helped 
along that path by carefully-crafted legislation, and help State 
government in the process.  It's not an either-or situation in 
which one way wins and the other loses.

Thanks for your thoughtful post.  I agree with you.

And I'm glad that you've met some competent IT admins at the State 
of Oregon.  Sadly, that was not my experience when I worked 
there, and I can only speak from my own experience.

Ken

Sorry Ken, that part was not directed at you personally. I did follow the

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0308281910110.15414@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  Because I'm running our own MTA here we use neither pop3 nor imap.
However, I have the need to retrieve mail that comes to me at a different
domain -- one not under my control.

  Can I manually run fetchmail to poll that server when I want to see if
there's anything there for me?

  If I want any reply to show that domain, do I need to manually tweak
something in pine for each such message?

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] I've got it installed . Now....
Message-ID: <wL1OPy1iz6Dvz3SaLgJcnNdFHjqN@4ax.com>

Hi All,
It's been a busy week here. I've got Java sdk installed, got Apache
installed, got Samba installed, got Open Office Installed.

Sort of.

I unpacked them, but now how and where do I put them into the PATH so
that I can use them? What files need to have PATH changed so that I
can use them? Is there a particular file where I should load some kind
of pointer( I loaded a couple of my scripts in the /bin and am able to
use them globally) ?
The files are there and depending on where I am when I run the test
scripts, they test as being installed. But if I'm in my home
directory, I can type JAVA and nothing happens, I can type OPENOFFICE
and nothing happens I can use Galeon to locate and even open Apache
html and view, but How do I get this all to work like I know it
should? 

I have the following reading materials at hand:
O'Rielly  "Using Samba"
Apache Server for dummies
Java 2
Perl(all of the O'reilly Blue series)
Redhat Admin books, Unix admin, Unix in Plain english,essential system
admin..... Just tons of available stuff, but not a clue to where to
point my eyes and begin.

I've even been online trying to find out where I need to go.
So far, I'm sort of stumbling blind.

I think the PATH thing is what's stopping me. Just unsure of the next
step.

So, if you can see where to point me, let me know.
Or if you know of a better way than what I'm doing, okay.

I got LPD errors too, but I think I know why that is and am putting
that off for now.

thanking you in advance,
Harry Howard

I really don't know much about it, but there is some info here:
http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=70838

"While waiting for the kernel to emerge i'm going to explain a bit more
about how module-init-tools work, basically they place the new
module-handlers like lsmod to /sbin and move the old one to
/sbin/lsmod.old , then those handlers detect what kernel you're using at
boot, whether it's 2.4 or 2.5/2.6 and forward the kernel to the
appropriate module-tools, this is done transperantly to the user so you
can, like i do dual boot between between 2.4 and 2.6 without changing
any settings at all."

Yes. Set up your .fetchmailrc and then run fetchmail from the command
line. Alternatively, you can automate it. I start up fetchmail in
daemon mode every morning and shut it down in the evening:

  [/tmp]$ crontab -l | grep fetchmail
  0    6   *   *   1-5  fetchmail --daemon  300
  0    7   *   *   6-7  fetchmail --daemon 1200
  4   17   *   *   *    fetchmail --quit

If the remote server supports SSL, then you can specify encrypted
connections with fetchmail too.

Have you done any work setting up Roles in pine? They'd be the key
here. I define a role for each of my mail accounts, and then use that
role when replying in that account's context. Let me know if you want
some further info along those lines.

Yup. Just run it like any other command-line utility. Make sure there's
no daemon polling interval related settings in .fetchmailrc, though.

Don't know about pine. mutt lets you set "folder-hooks" that can make
these changes automatically depending on what mail folder you're viewing
(and there are probably other ways, too). I'd guess pine has some way of
automating the process.

Because it's a WYSISYG HTML editor primarily.  I think the fact it
happens to be able to browse is a fringe benefit.  It's the only HTML

validator.w3.org isn't HTML).

The newest edition of the Oxford Dictionary of English contains some

Thankfully, "exchange" has retained its traditional meaning; only time

the only way I can think to do this is by running a second instance of 
postfix.   There is a step by step process listed at 
http://www.advosys.ca/papers/printable/postfix-instance.html
that will accomplish this.  That way you can have two differenct main.cf

Not quite true.  I think even Dreamweaver 4 generated valid HTML by
default, and I know it can be lightly hacked[1] to produce valid
XHTML.  Dreamweaver MX and MX 2004 are even better, though I don't
know if they're guaranteed to produce valid markup by default.  I know
I can get Vim to :)

I don't know about Frontpage.  I think most people use it not because
they want to but because they use IIS with Frontpage extensions. 
Standards have never really been Microsoft's cup of tea.

Agreed :)

Yes, I use cron for fetchmail.

SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/home/user1/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin
MAILTO=user1
HOME=/home/user1

0,20,40 0-23 * * *  /usr/bin/fetchmail

 I don't like the daemon

and here is a simple .fetchmailrc

 You need to set up a role for the email address in PINE. You can do this
by entering configuration and pressing R.


 For putting messages in the proper PINE mail folder use procmail.

Simple .procmailrc recipe:

:0:
* ^TOusername at ispdomain.xx
/home/username/mail/foldername

Message-ID: <1062139336.1539.69.camel@halo>

Was hooking up a Linux box to Comcast with cable modem discussed lately?
In any case...

If you were talked into providing your mother-in-law with her first
computer and cable broadband Internet access and you decide to abuse her
as a Linux user guinea pig, you of course want things to go fast and
smooth. 

You start by scanning the Internet to see how to go about this business
and you'll find mostly confusing information and probably no up-to-date
help specific to Comcast. It seems smart to take your Windows equipped
notebook with you on your first visit...just in case. Now despite claims
you read, her Linux box will not work with enabled DHCP and you'll grab
your notebook and Comcast's installation CD. It really helps if your
notebook is not a Thinkpad 770X because otherwise the Comcast program
will tell you what you may have long suspected: the CPU only has 72 MHz,
not the 300 IBM claims and you paid for. Which is way below the minimum
requirement and understandably, the installation will have to give up at
this point. 

Should the time you allocated for this visit be exhausted and you come
again in an attempt to get it to work with only the Linux box, you'll
waste your evening again. Don't let it fool you that you can ping some
outside hosts and DNS seems to work halfway too. It will just let you
stay longer that day (and there is still no food in the fridge).

If you don't like dual boot and you happen to have another harddisk with
a Windows installation, bring it with you on your next visit. Find an
innocent explanation why you open up the computer again and for the
cables chaos that hangs out of the case; your mother-in-law may become a
bit worried otherwise. Since you know that Windows installation can do
that blue screen trick and require a lengthy repair you will also have
the Windows installation CD with you. 

Otherwise you will have to continue on your next visit. 

Oh - the OS repair may also require the product key, even when this is a
MSDN CD (because MS reconsidered their options and asks for one now).
There are ones with 20, 21 and 25, and possibly other numbers of,
characters. If you don't have the right one with you you will need to
call around and have friends dig a bit. You'll block your mother-in-laws
phone line for a while though. 

Or you go home and bring it with you on your next visit. By now, you
will have to do something about your mother-in-laws growing
techno-fright.

At some point you will get Windows to run on her computer and with luck
the Comcast installation will like the CPU speed too. It is then that
you have to go through a shit load of service activation, modem
recognition and registration steps. With the obligatory 7 reboots. 

But now, finally, your Windows installation will find the Internet, and
after you yanked the second hard disk, so will Linux.

Don't try to show your mother-in-law how to use it just now though. Wait
until you and she are relaxed again. 

It really deserves another visit.

This crap can stop, too.  Seems like there's more traffic making

The only way that message is ever going to sink in is if you send a
letter to each company considered that they lost because of service by
certified mail.  Phone monkies don't get paid enough to care bout much
more than whether or not they're going to get rent in on time and
still have money for food.

Actually, the money's not that bad.  There's very few places in the
world that costs as much as it does in the US to live.  If I had the
same job in Canada for the same pay I do now converted into the coin
of the realm, I would live like a god compared to what I do now.

Anybody bother to do the math on that other than me?  Their proposal
for paying the damn thing off is contingent on getting a AA quality
baseball team (compare the Beavers stats against the Expos, the
Beavers play a better game but just barely) that can only sell 5,000
seats a game (Civic Stadium has four times that many) that we still
have next to zero chance of getting, taking 9% off the salaries of one
of the lowest paid teams in the MLB.  The stadium will never break
even.  The stadium won't ever even cover the interest on the debt.

Congratulations, MLB fans, you have your field of dreams.  I find it
rather unnerving that you can so easily dance on everybody's backs,
especially in such hard times.  Y'all realize voting yourselves
subsidies to buy all the Portland MLB fans to drive to every game in
Seattle would have been just as shallow, childish and stupid while
being less of a leech on the common taxpayer, right?

It doesn't help that the local governments so readily roll over and
let companies get away with paying fewer actual dollars in taxes than
I do, and I'm only taking down outsourced security officer money.

Yes, I have Ed's "Linux Networking Lab Manual" and will

Email me off line and I will send address for bills.


Also, Start slow.

Read the "Apache server for dummies" first...

Good luck..  8^)

Yes, using rdesktop.  Keep in mind that Windows is NOT a multiuser OS,

That's exactly what fetchmail is intended to do.  Check out the

So why did it take them this long to join the civilized world?  I'm a
little skeptical about it's claims of standards compliance, I'll
believe it when I see it for myself.  Got an example?

I remember those from HPUX when I had that awful HP9000 under my desk.

It's a pretty common thing.  The script that does it is in the LFS book.

I think it's /etc/init.d/functions.

So, speaking of 2.6, I just installed Gentoo on my IBM R40, and for some reasons ACPI is not working.  When I compile for P4 I get seg faults on certain things, and when I compile for P3 it just locks up.

Any guesses what I'm doing, or should I just wait for test5


Thanks

I've been impressed with Dreamweaver's ability to do the right thing
with HTML. Like most (all?) wysiwyg authoring tools, the resulting
markup is way more verbose than it need be -- and the cruft builds and
builds when the same document is edited repeatedly -- but it's not bad
markup.

I usually have the luxury of being able to hand-craft my pages, but if
someone needs to get heavily formatted stuff online under a strict
deadline, it's not a bad tool.

That's not what I understand. I have several friends that live in 
Canada, and one friend that used to be an American, but emigrated to 
Canada in 1997 (for love).

Minimum wage is currently $6.85 
(http://www.cbsc.org/ontario/english/search/display.cfm?Code=8042&coll=ON_PROVBIS_E) 
per hour in Canada, the lowest tax bracket in BC is 22.05%. The highest 
43.70%. They have deductions, but none of that is refundable. Unlike the 
US, if you end up below zero (i.e., your credits exceed what you owe) 
you can only get back what you actually overpaid. (Reference: 
http://www.taxtips.ca/tax_rates.htm)

Then, on top of that, each dollar is only worth 72 cents US. Now, 
explain to me why, if cost of living in the US is higher, why so many 
Canadians are coming to the US to do much of their major shopping? This 
was the practice 20 years ago, and seems to still be the practice today.

Gasoline in Victoria was averaging 89.8 cent Canadian per *LITER*. ~3.8 
liters per gallon. 89.8 X 3.8 = $3.412 per gallon, Canadian, or $2.46 
gallon, US. Looks a little worse. In Vancouver, BC, it's 91.9 cents per 
liter.

It isn't that there aren't highly competent staff working for the state,
it's simply that they seem to be in the minority.  Given the large
number of staff the state has, that still allows for a great number of
qualified staff.

And you get a hold of these auditors by...  yeah right.  Anyway, the
working assumption here is that state employees aren't doing their
jobs.  Why would state auditors be considered exempt from this
assumption?  You might ask why that assumption is being made so I'll
tell you: 

1) State employees are usually assumed to be less competent than their
private sector counterparts.  Is this a fair assumption?  Maybe not, but
it can be *very* difficult to fire a state employee and human nature
kind of dictates that a good number of people will take advantage of
that situation.  Also, as I mentioned earlier, the sheer number of state
employees has the effect of reducing the amount of accountability placed
on any single person.  Many will also take advantage of this.

2) We haven't been shown otherwise.  If you don't keep an eye on your
government, you deserve what you get.

3) The state tends to promote people to their highest level of
incompetence.  That means that while you might have many talented people
in the trenches, management often consists of shaved apes wearing shirts
and ties.  Management often dictates policy that goes directly against
what the competent people would prefer and there's often little the
competent people can do about it.  Of course, this isn't unique to the
state, but given how difficult it can be to fire state employees, the
ones considered incompetent are often promoted to a place where it is
hoped they can't actually do much harm (i.e. they can't touch a keyboard
on a critical system), but they somehow manage to mess up everyone
else's job anyway.

And it bothers me that running nmap is considered a crime.  It's called
"looking".  Often people use "looking" as preparation for comitting a
crime.  More often they don't.  Perhaps next time someone walks past my
house and gives it a twice-over, I should call the police.  They might
be casing the place.

Hopefully.  And if not Linux, perhaps an OSS successor to Linux (er,
Hurd?).  But really, as far as I'm concerned it isn't because I want
Linux to be successful that this is an issue.  It's because I want the
state to run more efficiently (although a recent thread on
comp.lang.python would suggest that an efficient state might not be a
good thing).  After all, it's my tax dollars and my personal data that
are at stake.  If Microsoft gives the state a sweet deal and can
*secure* their systems and not require state employees to grant MS the
right to peruse *my* data whenever they please (read your EULAs
everyone), then by all means, use Windows.  If they can't do those
things, then don't.

Speaking of EULAs, has anyone considered demanding that state employees
who deal with public records (which, despite their name, may be
confidential) *not* click "I agree" on these EULAs?  What right does a
fairly low-level state employee have to grant Microsoft (or anyone else,
for that matter) the right to have access to this data?  Whether MS does
or not is irrelevant.  The state employee doesn't have the authority to
grant this right.

Most of the folks I knew on the phone cared most if they got their call 
quota covered.

30 calls per day (in 6 hours phone time) for Technical Support.

100 calls per day (in 6 hours phone time) for Customer Service.

We had 2 hours per day that were devoted to other projects, not phones. 
Except when call volume was heavy.

Of course, this was Symantec, before the change. I understand it much 
more oppressive at places like Stream and Sitel.

As much as I hate to contribute to the continuation of this thread...

nmap isn't just looking so much.

To make the comparison of somebody on the street 'nmap'ing your house...
they don't walk past it, taking two looks at it.

They drive up to the house and try the garage door.  Then they go around
the house, checking every door and every window to see if any are open. 
They then gather as much information through the windows and doors, and
how they do or do not open, and try and figure out what model the house
is, who the builder was, who drew up the blueprints, etc.  That
information could then be looked up and any possible security holes
found.

They may not actually break in to the house, but if you're sitting in
your PJs at 2AM watching TV in the family room and see some dude walking
around *your* house, trying to open all the doors and windows... are you
going to just sit there and invite the total stranger inside... or are
you going to really consider calling the cops, but not until after
you've checked to make sure your .38 is loaded?

And I *know* both samba.org and winehq.org both had similar notices up

Attempts to argue this matter based on simile or metaphor always fall
flat.  Eventually it degrades into an argument over which simile is most
appropriate.  Arguments should be based on the facts of the matter, not
simile, which is a device for explanation, not argumentation.

Okay, I've heard all the analogies before, and I've been disgusted each
and every time by everyone's fundamental lack of understanding that an
analogy is only useful so much as it fits.

A server is not a house. A machine on the network IS NOT YOUR PERSONAL
HOME.

It might be a slightly better analogy if you compared a server to a
business, as a server offers services. I could make another analogy
suggesting that nmapping is a way of asking a server what services it
offers, as well as checking out the building, by walking into the store
and looking around.

But that, too, would be a FLAWED analogy. Hugely flawed. 

Rather than trying to use flawed analogies to spin the actuality, can we
study for a moment the actuality?

nmap studies a server, which is a machine intended to be publicly
accessible in some manner (or highly misconfigured), and it gets a whole
bunch of data about it. Yes, that data could be used to look up security
vulnerabilities, but nmap the tool does not itself print those out, nor
does it have capabilities to search for security vulnerabilities. That
is left to the user.

Nmap is a tool, and the information it gathers is publicly available,
simply because you put the machine on the net with the intent of
providing services (if you didn't intend to provide services, that's
what firewalls are there for--allowing a machine to be on the net
without providing services).

running nmap on a publicly available server should not be criminal.
Whether or not it is will be decided by technophobic judges, but as long
as techies fail to understand the definition of analogy, they really
desperately worsen the situation.

I think this is a false analogy.  A better one might be calling up the
Police Department and asking is it a good for the officer to have left
the car idling at the curb and what, if any, safegards are there to keep
some fool from jumping in th ecar and taking it for a joyride.  Or for
checking out the car and the situation to see what I though might be
protecting this resource.

Valid point.  Now consider that the person in question is your neighbor
who is paying you to store some of his valuables in your house.  He has
informed you that he suspects that you aren't keeping your house secured
properly and intends to check up on you occasionally.

Is our metaphor getting any closer or is this truly a losing
proposition?

The reason analogies, albeit flawed ones, are often applied in these
types of discussions is because the analogies typically have clear-cut
(or at least more obvious) ethical implications.  Running nmap against a
machine does not, at least on the surface, imply right or wrong.  When
you are discussing the ethics of machinery, it often helps to compare it
to a more human domain where ethics at least have a general consensus.

Those of you running Red Hat and using up2date should be aware that the SSL

[ from rhn.redhat.com, moderate snippage ]


SSL Connection Errors

   On August 28th, the SSL certificates used by up2date, rhn_register,
   and the RHN applet expired. Systems attempting to connect to RHN using
   an older certificate will receive 'certificate verify failed' errors.
   Please see the following instructions to download the latest versions
   of up2date and rhn_register.

                    SSL Certificate Download Information

     Versions of up2date and rhn_register with the new SSL certificate
      [9]are available for download. See the following errata for more
                                  details:

Great information, Sandy! Thanks for posting. I was starting to wonder what
was up with up2date. The icons was turning into a gray question mark and I
couldn't figure out what the problem was.

I tend to agree with Rob. I like the analogy, too. I dislike scans against
my network. Granted, many of them are not directed at me, per se, but still.
When the scanner has compiled a list of machines from an entire subnet for
the person to return to, that leads me to believe that they have something
less than honest in mind.

For those running RedHat, a subcription to the redhat-watch-list is mandatory,
https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/redhat-watch-list

any other decent distro should have a similiar list.

Redirecting to plug puts messages to a file named plug instead of a mail
box plug under evolution.  This however will work great if I know what's
spam though as I can send it to /dev/null.  Anyone know how to send to
the right folder under evolution?

OK, if you replace the PLUG in his example with the path to the mbox
file under evolution you use for plug, that seems to work right.

I'm noticing some other files there though and it looks like evolution
may have it's own way other than procmail to do the same thing.
The files I'm seeing are folder-metadata.xml, local-metadata.xml,
mbox.ibex, and mbox.ev-summary.  Are any of these upadted when mail
is moved to this folder manually or what are these files?

I don't get what a deliverable filter is unless that's what Rogan
put up.  The man page says something about halting processing and
make sure to use lock files properly.

So to continue from Rogan's example, how do add discarding carbon copies
of email you've already received?

Can you have more than one procmailrc or what does the procmailrc man
page mean when it talks about multiple recipes?

Subject: [PLUG] unable to mount ext3 file system
Message-ID: <1625.134.244.174.28.1062216881.squirrel@sautez.com>

hello,

I'm in the process of upgrading from RH 7.3 to RH 9.0.  I have three extra disk
space disk that are each 120GB that I had on a second controller in the old machine.
 I took them out and bought 3 new disk that I'm going to place in the old machine
once the upgrade finishes.

What I would like to do is use rsync and move the date from the old disk to the new
disk.

To achieve this at a fast speed and together I have another RH 9.0 box where I'm
trying to mount one new drive of 120GB and one old drive.  I will then run rsync and
have the drives ready for the new computer when it finishes.

The problem is I can't get the old drives to mount on the new machine.  I have the
new drives created and working fine.  I have tried each of the old drives and they
all tell me:

mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdh,
       or too many mounted file systems

when I try to mount.  I'm mounting these with this command:

 mount -t ext3 /dev/hdh /oldcomputer/disk1

I have tried ext2 and ext as well but same results.  I have tried running fsck but
it says to try with another superblock if I have a ext2 partition and I have ext3
journaling.

any suggestions on how I can get these hard drives mounted?  I do have them backed
up on Tape but it seems I should be able to just mount and rsync and that would be
much faster being they are on the same computer.

Thanks for any help,

Josh

I think you might need to specify a partition number, e.g.

    # mount /dev/hdh1 /mnt/point

Do you mean by using Evolution's filtering capability?  You can't really
delete things with the filters in Evolution, but they will be flagged
for deletion on your next folder expunge.

The entry in my fstab is:

/dev/hdg      /newdisk/disk1   ext3   defaults   1 1

It gets more strange to me.  On the new Maxtor HD's I can do the above but the old
IBM Drives I need to specify the partition when I mount.

It works just seems odd to me.  Maybe someone can explain.  I'd give you the details
of the HD's if you think that makes a difference.  But I'm doing the mount commands
as follows to get it to work:

mount -t ext3 /dev/hdg /newdisk/disk1

and

mount -t ext3 /dev/hdf1 /olddisk/disk1

Would like to understand it but the good news is the files are being copied.  :-)

This is strange...

Can you post your entire /etc/fstab???

Here is mine
mkosmal at farm-libranet:~$ cat /etc/fstab
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#

hmm.  I think I see the errors of my way.  I hate this.

Ok.  For some reason I was able to write to a filesystem that had no partitions. 
So, now I'm starting over.  I have to create partitions then run mkfs.ext3 again.

Correct me if I'm wrong.  but for some reason the partitions were never created and
I have this feeling that will be a bad thing.  And I still have 360GB of data to
move or so.

Rich,

You also might want to look at the -geometry option for X apps.  You can read 
about this in the "GEOMETRY SPECIFICATIONS" section of the X man page.

I thought giving out that kind of permission even without telling them

In another words, they don't let you cheat at the last minute.  Paying

This is changing as the Canadian dollar remains stable and the US

Sales tax is cheaper stateside, but it only really pays off on
duty-free items.  7% GST (general sales tax) nationwide, plus PST
(provincial sales tax) in most provinces averaging another 7%.

Gas is expensive everywhere in North America right now.  Normally it's
about 35 to 40 cents a litre on Vancouver Island, and 28 to 33 cents a
litre on the BC mainland near towns.  Somewhere between the two in the
BC interior.

Not that it matters, people really should be using modes of
transportation better suited for cities when they're commuting.  Cars
are great for multiple people, large items or long distance, not one
person who can't be bothered to dial 503-CAR-POOL to team up, save
space on the roads and split the costs of commuting.  Fringe benefit
is it makes gas a negligable weekend-warrior commodity anyway.

I'm trying to set up a relay that only forwards locally generated 
mail to the hub.  Does this look like a file permissions problem 
on the queue directories?  There's no firewall blocking on goose 
where the inside interface of this server should be wide open.
What should the permissions on the .cf files be?  I've set 
everything under /etc/mail to 0600 including statistics.

What is submit.cf under /etc/mail for I wonder?  Is an extension
referenced in sendmail.cf or a standard cf file?  I test moved
it resulting in sendmail trying to use procmail which isn't 
installed.  Sendmail should be sending to goose but it seems
to want to send to localhost.

It has a DSgoose.robinson-west.com in sendmail.cf and I know that
resolves from this box.  Should local-host-names be empty on the
relay?

The mail directory under /var/spool has permissions: drwxrwxrwt.
How do you check sticky bits?  What does the t mean?  The mail
directory is owned by root.mail.

The directories /var/spool/mqueue and /var/spool/clientmqueue are
drwx------ and drwxrwx--- respectively.  Again, I don't know
how to check sticky bits, etc.  The directory clientmqueue is
ownership smmsp.smmsp, mqueue is root.wheel.

You know, there's an interesting question embedded in here.

Think about the FrontPage license, which says that you cannot use
FrontPage to create a site which says bad things about Microsoft. That's
a click through license. By clicking it, you agree not to do such a
thing.

What if I get hired by a company to make a webpage for them, using
FrontPage? And it's a lenient company and they don't mind me using their
systems for my personal use in my off time, and I create, using
FrontPage, a web page saying Microsoft sucks.

They haven't violated the agreement, because they didn't tell me to do
so, and I haven't violated the agreement, because I didn't click it so I
didn't agree to it.

The only realistic view of this I can take is that it's illegal for me
to use software installed on my machine by someone else, because its use
is subject to its license agreement, i.e. I can only use it if I agree
to the license, and unless I install it, or at least click through it, I
am not subject to the license.

IT installs, ghost installs, even a computer company pre-installing
software could well be illegal.

Jeff

But, if you don't agree with the license agreement, you can't use the
software!  That is what the EULA usually says.

Isn't it more like a book with strings attached?  Your employer is
lending you the software, but you must agree to the same EULA that the
installer agreed to.  And, like the installer, you have no idea what the
EULA actually says.

When I started my IT career, I would read each EULA all of the way
through, so I could paraphrase for my customers.  It took huge amounts
of time, I very rarely understood ALL of it, and the customer hardly
ever cared.  Now I just skim them to check for phrases like "you cannot
use this software to create a site that says bad things about
Microsoft".  The customer really needs to know this kind of thing.

It _really_ felt good the first time I professionally handed off a
debian box.  "Here, take it, it is all yours, no rental agreement, no
borrowed binaries, copy it as much as you want and the source can be
yours if you want it."

The EULA's phrase it so that compliance is the users responsibility.  In
the case of you and your company, I would bet that M$ would consider the
entire company to be the user.

Who said anything about cheating? The earned income credit is a tax
giveaway for low income people, and it's legal. It's not cheating. But
with it, you may end up getting back more money than you paid in total.

If you have no link to it from your site, just have a filename other
than the default the server serves up.  If you have an index.html the
apache server serves that.  

The only way to get to your other named "site" is to open something
like: http:/your.site.com/other.html.  If no other site has a link to
that page, then the bots won't find it.  However, once someone else
links to it from an indexed site, then you have been found out.

You could also use basic authentication, if everyone you wish to connect
to the site has a login.

True, but I don't want to require a login to get here.
A little more explanation is in order.  My email site
is at 192.168.1.14.  My web site the link is on is at
209.210.202.170.  I'm wanting to do a simple 
<A HREF="http://goose.robinson-west.com">my-link-name</A>
where the hostname in this anchor is the same as 
192.168.1.14.  Since this link won't be followable
for an Internet client and I in fact don't want it
to be, I don't want it to appear.  The page this
is on is index.html, I basically want everyone
to get the same page except for this one link.

No it is not cheating ... It is legalized stealing.

There should be a law that allows getting cash rebates for products even
if you have not bought them. I want my $1000 cash back for that new car at
that dealership, but I don't think it is fair that I actually have to buy
the vehicle to qualify.

I support given every parent a $400 dollar child tax credit even if they
are on welfare and pay no taxes.

You may do some scripting and check the IP of the caller.  Do some
decision from there.  Apache provides lots of information on the
caller/referrer.

My outside server has mod_perl, do I write a standard perl script
or is mod_perl a different scripting language?  Do I link
index.htm to the script and have the script then redirect
the client to the proper version of what was index.htm, 
perhaps, main_i.htm or main_o.htm?  Is there a name to give
my perl script like index.htm that will cause it to be the
first thing served?

No, it's not stealing. The government is giving out this money. They
hand it to those that qualify. Stealing is when you take something that
doesn't belong to you, WITHOUT PERMISSION.

Subject: [PLUG] How ethernet interfaces are created?
Message-ID: <1062294999.3175.68.camel@localhost>

Hi all-

I'm still working on getting my (PCMCIA) wireless networking card up and
running and have made a little bit of progress.

Cardmgr now properly recognizes the card and loads the proper modules. 
However, now I don't get an interface out of it...

Since it all works properly with 2.4.21, I'm guessing the problem lies
not in the configuration, but rather in the driver. 

So I ask - how are ethernet interfaces created?  Does the loading of a
module do the trick by itself, or is there a subsystem in there
somewhere that links up the interface (ie; eth0) with the driver?

Do any of y'all have a good understanding of this stuff?  I'd be
interested to hear how this works... or get a link to somewhere that
better explains it.  :-)

Rob

Michael,

It's waaaay simpler than that if the page can be parsed with a server side
include...

<!--#IF EXPR="${REMOTE_ADDR} = /^192.168./" -->
<A HREF="http://foo.bar.org/baz.html">this is the hidden link</A>
<!--#ENDIF -->

You are right. When a thief with a gun steals a wallet and gives it to a
friend, the friend did not steal it but he is in possession of stolen
property.

The government is giving this money to the 'qualified' from taking it from
others. It not stealing because the government legalized the theft of the
money from taxpayers. It can't be rationalize just because the taxpayer
makes more money and can 'afford' it.

You cannot be charitable with other peoples money. Charity is something
giving willingly. I have not given the government PERMISSION to take my
money and give it someone because they 'qualify'. In fact, I would call it
enslavement. I am enslaved to government for 5 months a year and with the
passage of state income tax surcharge that is a couple more days.

Again I will state that tax credits to those who do not pay taxes is
legalized theft or at least possession of stolen property!

You need to set the background of the .gif to be transparent. `man convert'.

You must have missed it, but a lot of channels have been getting hit
with bot floods.  Maybe you should just bite the bullet and register?

On my custom apache server.  Is there an easy way to find out if I
didn't compile in support for them?  I got one working on Redhat 7.3's
apache package.  I think my custom apache 1.3.27 is statically compiled
without support for modules or at the very least I think the modules it
will run are tightly controlled.  What's the security story for server
side includes?  If they were disabled during compilation it is probably
because of instructions in Securing and Optimizing Redhat Linux 
The Ultimate Solution by Gerhard Mourani intended to tighten security.
I didn't even add PHP support to this server having had trouble
with Horde in the past and deciding it's probably too buggy to
be secure.

I found out my apache documentation wasn't opening on my custom server
because the filenames were wrong, fixed that and found quite a bit on
server side includes :-)

Are the following two lines placed in httpd.conf all that's needed to
get SSI working?

AddType text/html .shtml
AddHandler server-parsed .shtml

If so, do you add them under a certain section or can they be 
added anywhere in the file?  There's something about adding
Options +Includes, how do you add this to httpd.conf as it
seems to need to go in a particular spot?  I couldn't find
it looking at Redhat's apache under httpd.conf, maybe they put 
it in a .htaccess file.

It returns a difficult guess, with estimates ranging from Windows to

I forget what the top choice was.

One of the reasons I'm guessing it's load balanced somehow. ;)

Basically the same as CGI. SSIs are also affected by suEXEC, which is a

I'm not familiar with Mourani's work. My apache installation is a standard
Red Hat 7.3 deal. I've had no security breaches (I keep on top of Errata).

Yes - assuming you want to use an .shtml extension for pages to be
server-parsed. I use the Xbit hack...

<Directory "/var/www/html">
 .
 .

    XbitHack On
 .
 .
</Directory>

The stock RH Apache install adds them within this section...

#
# Document types.
#
<IfModule mod_mime.c>
 .
 .
    #
    # To use server-parsed HTML files
    #
    AddType text/html .shtml
    AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
 .
 .
</IfModule>
# End of document types.

It's far more efficient to put directives in httpd.conf than an .htaccess
file. You can put an Options directive in whatever locale you want it to
control. In this case, you'd want it within the...

<Directory "/var/www/html">

...section (assumning that's where your web pages are located).

I agree with Sandy on this one. If you can't use SSI, then perhaps you
can use PHP. Here is what you'll need two pieces of php code:

1. Determine if the link should be printed.

<?php

  $ip_addr =  $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']; // determine users ip addr

// if they are from the local network print the link
if ( substr( $ip_addr, 0,8 ) != '192.168.' ){
  print "<a href=\"http://www.domain.com\">link</a>";
}

?>

2. On the page you only want local access on make sure the traffic is
from the local network. If it isn't don't display the page.

<?php

if ( substr( $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], 0,8 ) != '192.168.' ){
  print "Access Deined";
  exit;
}

?>

You can use htaccess for an alternative to part two. If you put a
".htaccess" file in the directory you are viewing that looks like this:

<Files "hidden_file.html">
Order Allow,Deny
Allow FROM 192.168.1
</Files>

Then only people from 192.168.1.* should be able to see the file. You'll
need to make sure that you are able to change the Allow FROM part. This
is set the apache conf.

I hope this helps. Feel free to ask if you need any additional
help/clarification on this.

The value for the -transparent option is the color to be regarded as
transparent. In your case, black is the color. The command would be...

    convert -transparent "#FFFFFF" back.gif

Which weaknesses?

CGI can be done realtively securely via suEXEC, which is why it's a nice 
plus that SSIs happen to also run through it when available. First of 
all, they are run as the user who owns them, which helps to contain 
damage done by malicious and/or broken scripts to the user who installed 
them. Second, it employs a series of sanity checks that keeps stupid 
users from compromising themselves. (User: "Yay! Let's make all our 
executables 0777!" suEXEC: "No fucking way. kthx.")

Of course, this relies on the integrity of the suEXEC executable. The 
hope is that suexec has a secure executable, because special attention 
was given to security in reguards to that particular piece of code. (Not 
to mention that comprimising suEXEC would mean gaining root access, 
since the module requires suid root to run correctly.)

Second, Apache has a set of resource limitations that can be enacted, 
helping to prevent a local DoS attempt.

What other concerns do you have?

Okay I've done that, now how do I use the converted gif in my html
code to get it to show up better?  I'm using <IMG SRC="back.gif"></IMG>.

Another approach I've discovered is encapsulating the gif in a table,
It look tacky though considering you see a double uneven box around
the image.

Well, you could start with correct HTML:

All you should have to do is switch the image tag to use the converted 
image instead of the original one.

I'm using these for my xserver-xfree86 4.3 sources:

# XF86
deb http://people.debian.org/~mmagallo/packages/xfree86/i386/ ./

They run wonderfully.

Subject: [PLUG] Messed up Evolution :(
Message-ID: <E19tDbp-0001EW-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

I seem to have slain evolution.
Well, not /slain/. Perhaps "mortally wounded."

Here's the scenario...

I run RedHat 8.0. It works OK but I'm still fairly new to it. I like the
package-ability of it, but I don't use it enough to be very good at it.  So I
was using "up2date" to update my computer, and it kept saying I didn't have
enough space on "/" to upgrade. So I used "rpm -e" to erase packages until I had
enough space. 

I expected not to have any problems, because if there was a dependency with a
file, I'd be alerted and all would work out, either I'd decide not to remove
that package, or I'd remove the dependent one too. Many of the korean and
japanese translation programs that were somehow installed fell by the roadside
this way.

I use KDE- not gnome, generally; and while it's been my intention to learn
gnome, I just haven't. So I removed some gnome files. And apparently, I removed
one that controlled menus and files, and the basic interface stuff for me to
talk to evolution; I don't have the menu bar any more and keystrokes don't work
any more.

I've included a JPG attachment of what my evolution (top) looks like now. And
here's a list of the rpms I removed.  Could someone tell me which caused this
... error?

That'd be a big help :)

I would suggest making a virutal host that is only accessable from the
corporate IPs.  Not inside?  Denied.  You should back this up with
some sort of password protection scheme for the virtual host as well,
but I'm not sure how to do that.

Subject: [PLUG] Strangeness under Internet Explorer...
Message-ID: <1062367825.24664.697.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I developed a simple text web page, mostly <p> 
sections with paragraphs.  In other words, nothing 
that won't work in lynx except for back.gif at the 
end.  Wanting to improve the spacing, I looked up 
the character code for a space and discovered I 
needed to do &#20, decimal representation 
I think.

It works in mozilla, for some reason though IE prints 
squares instead of spaces.  How does one know what 
works everywhere or should I just redirect to a page 
that says go get mozilla?

I wish I had even my basic html book at hand.

I have run into one problem with mozilla.  On the 
pictures page at http://www.robinson-west.com 
the thumbnails don't render in a perfect rectangle, 
two rows of four.  If anyone wants to look at the 
source to see if they can catch the mistake, it's 
a very simple page.

With server side includes if the condition is false 
is the rest of the page not rendered?  This is what 
happened when I tried doing an SSI clock statement 
for local clients only as an experiment and accessed 
my page via lynx remotely.  For SSI if statements can 
an else clause be added that will cause processing to 
continue?

Oh, my custom browser does have SSI.  No
mod_include.so though because it's staticly 
compiled.

You are right, it is theft.  But then money is property and all property
is theft.  Its nice to see such good socialist thinking from you.

Big hint is do a custom install and deselect all groups 
except for gnome.  That way whatever is needed under X etc. 
for gnome will be installed with it, but nothing else which 
usually occurs when you do a default install.  I'm not sure 
if some packages have to be installed together because of 
the way what you want was compiled or what the deal is 
sometimes, though the latter approach to installation does 
get the footprint down.  I guess with gnome programs is that 
they don't need gnome to work, or at least that's what I've 
heard.  I gave up on KDE because there are some licensing 
caveats using it for anything other than personal use and 
because it seems to be more obnoxious about dependencies 
than gnome.  As far as Redhat 8, I have an evaluation 
version and I couldn't get it to work stably, same with a 
full version of nine.  I use 7.3 without much trouble.

One problem I have noticed when gnome screen saves is that
programs such as nautilus crash creating a bunch
of errors about panels quitting when the desktop is brought
back up, if you kill nautilus and reopen though it's fine.

To make everything line up like I think you mean you'll have to close
you <a hrefs> with a </a>, you've not done that on most of them it looks
like.  Also, you should consider making actual thumbnails for your
images, rather than just scaling down the display of a larger image.

First of all, I agree with Dane Carver.  But that's beside the 
point -- I agree with Will Cooley even more.

I'm unsubscribing from this list as soon as I finish sending this 
email.  I don't have time to go through 83 messages on the PLUG

For your current layout you can easily change spacing between the
images by modifying the 'cellpadding' and 'cellspacing' attributes
your table tag.  It's not the ideal way, but works fine in nearly
every browser.

But what if you later want more space, or less?  You have to change
every instance.  What if you have a 100-page photo gallery?  Manually
adding non-breaking space characters to change layout doesn't scale
well, plus it's a little crufty.

> How does one know what works everywhere 

Nothing works everywhere. :)  The next best thing is to create a
symantically-meaningful page in HTML, leave the presentation to
style sheets, and validate it at the W3C.  This is more effective than
you may imagine[1], and it's easy to start small.

Check this out:  http://sonofhans.net/michaelrobinson.html

It's a similar layout with a few easy tweaks and
simplifications.  It only took a few minutes thanks to a couple
regexs in Vim.  The source is commented and most of the style
properties are simple.

If you look, I believe the vast majority (80% or better) was on topic,
or at least had to do with Linux. 

Face it. PLUG is a high volume list. Not as high as some of the lists I
get, but it's up there. 

As with ANY high volume list, you will get some off topic content.

Since you are including that stuff in the "on topic" stuff, up my "on
topic" number to 90%.
