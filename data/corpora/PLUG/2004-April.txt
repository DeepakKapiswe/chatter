                                 April Fuel

   Thursday, April 1, 2004--Hey, it's a holiday, so I can't resist
   running some real news-type stories in the newsletter here:

   SCO, known for decades as the acronym for Santa Cruz Operation, has
   changed its name to PO, for Provo Operation. "It kind of goes better
   with our attitude, don't you think?" said Darl McBride, the company
   CEO. Asked if the new name reflects a change in the nature or the
   strategy of the company, McBride said, "If anything, it expresses a
   renewed sense of commitment. Recently we noticed that we hadn't pissed
   off everybody yet. That's still our goal." In a related move, McBride
   also was named CLO, Chief Litigation Officer. His other titles remain.

   As a company-wide exercise in rhetorical restraint, Microsoft has
   challenged its employees to go "just one day" without using the words
   "smart" or "threat". Said CEO Steve Ballmer, "Y'know, after twenty
   years of chanting the same damn things to ourselves, I just got
   freaking tired of it." As part of a long-term plan to change the
   hyper-competitive culture of the company, Microsoft's HR department
   has quietly dropped its requirement that applicants submit their high
   school SAT scores or take the tests again if the original scores
   failed to meet company threshold requirements. "But we're still going
   to grade everybody on a curve", said a company press release.

   In a surprise move, Linus Torvalds for the first time issued a policy
   statement regarding the pronunciation of both his first name and that
   of the operating system he launched almost 14 years ago. "I'm
   'eenus'", he said. "The operating system is 'eenux'. The L is silent
   in both cases. I'm sorry I forgot to mention that before."

   AOL, Apple, Yahoo and Microsoft's MSN group today announced their
   joint intention to "jump ahead into the Nineties" and open up their
   instant messaging clients to servers running XMPP and other open IM
   transport protocols. "We finally realized it was flat-out nuts to keep
   users locked in proprietary silos", the four companies said in a joint
   press release. Nobody at any of the companies could be reached for
   comment.

   Reuters reports the discovery of a Wi-Fi hot spot "about the size of
   Turkey" in the Atlantic Ocean, just west of the Canary Islands. The
   dimensions of the spot were determined by combined reports of
   communications officers on-board container cargo and cruise ships.
   Asked to comment on the quality of the connection through the hot
   spot, Ozmo Zdilmidgi, who works with the Maersk Sealand company, said
   "I dunno. It was WEPped and we couldn't get on."

   Acting swiftly after passage of the Communications Decency Enforcement
   Act, the FCC ordered broadcasters to cease operating on the AM band.
   "We just got tired of it", said FCC Chairman Michael Powell. "We were
   going to fine everybody, but it was easier just to wipe the whole
   thing out." Asked if the Commission would offer an alternative band
   for broadcasters to start over, the weary Powell said, "Why?"

   Responding to threats by Senator John McCain (R-Mars) to mandate a l?
   carte pricing for worthless channels that cable and satellite
   providers feel forced to carry for subscribers, DishTV announced the
   development of a "reality channel reduction policy", in which the
   number of channels on the service would be reduced by viewer call-in
   votes. "Each week viewers will vote one channel off the service", said
   Charles Ergen, Chairman and CEO of DishTV parent EchoStar. "And
   they'll pay to vote, too, which is cool." He added, "Dropping one
   channel per week, we should be down to the original 100 channels in
   three or four years."

   Ending a complete absence of speculation about who would end up buying
   Red Hat, it surprised analysts to learn that the winning suitor was
   Red Flag, the official Linux of the People's Republic of China. "The
   red thing is important to us", said Matthew Szulik, Red Hat's
   Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and now Chief Propaganda
   Minister. "It wasn't happening with IBM's blue theme or Oracle's
   whatever-it-is. Plaid? I forget. Anyway, the hat goes well with the
   flag." Asked to comment on the sale, a Red Flag spokesperson said, "We
   did? Really. Oh. That's really nice."

   Sorry, I couldn't resist. See ya next round.

Hi,

Some software like Tom's root boot on a floppy, one of the CD based
distributions, a floppy with DOS 6.20 and Partition Magic 8 on floppies.
Also something like Fastwire for copying files between PCs using serial or
parallel ports.

Cheers,
Mike

Multimeter, that is what I forgot to mention, it really helps if it has
an auto-off feature.  Of course, a laptop with both ethernet and wi-fi
is invaluable too.

Or just carry a couple of NIC's and a cross-over cable.

A breakout box such as an EasyBob, could be useful. The laptop should
have a serial port, and you may need an assortment of serial modem, and
null-modem cables and/or port adapters. Some older devices require a
connection through a serial port in order to set up the configuration.
Are you working only with CAT-5 type  cables? What about fiber optics,
which bring up a whole new set of goodies for your bag-o-tricks. Here is
a great source for cable management stuff:

If this bugs you then I recommend you contact Logitech
and ask them to stop requiring an NDA to get the specs
on some aspects of their cameras:
http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm?countryid=19&languageid=1&page=support/contactcs
Also, their forums:
http://forums.logitech.com/index.html?l=en&c=usa

Here are some details about the NDA:
http://www.smcc.demon.nl/webcam/nda.html

What I recommend you do to solve the problem is
download the "PWCX 8.2.2 super value pack" from here
and use the 2.4.20 module:
http://www.smcc.demon.nl/webcam/release.html#pwcx

Please have a nice day.

Not necessarily.  My ThinkPad R32 only has USB.  Speaking of which, does
anyone know of a particular USB<->RS-323 converter that works?  Greg
says most of them should, but it can be hit-or-miss.

Mel,

  I wrote to Wil off-list, but now we're developing a crowd. My Sony Vaio
505 has the same problem. I tried getting my SIIG converter to work, but so
far no luck -- and Greg K-H did make a few suggestions in response to my
mail list requests for help.

  Perhaps all of us with this problem could get together and bribe Greg with
a case of microbrew and a pizza to help us all figure it out? It looks like
this would be a solution he could use in his role with the kernel drivers --
and another column for LJ.

I bought a Belkin converter (used) for ~$15. Works great with the
usbserial module, so far.

Message-ID: <406C6E18.6030307@ohga.org>

Hi, I had a quick question on patch a 2.4.25 kernel.

I wan't to get IMQ support for ingress, so I downloaded and applied the 
patch, which looked like it copied and installed to the kernel sources.  
Since I have never applied a patch before I'm confused why I don't have 
the new IMQ option in menuconfig.  Is there something else I have to do 
here? is the patch suppose to show in menuconfig?

Thanks for any direction here.

Dave

I recommend not buying the Xircom Portgear model PGSDB9. It has
not worked very well for me. I still use it to connect my serial GPS
to the USB on my  Thinkpad 600, but it quits occasionally for no good reason.

Mel,

  That is one possibility. If a bunch of us are having problems, and Greg is
the USB driver maintainer, then we have a mutual interest in resolving these
issues for as broad an audience as possible. Particularly since the trend
with portables seems to be away from serial ports to the Ubiquious Serial
Bandwagon.

http://trash.net/~kaber/imq/#sources
it looks like you need to make sure CONFIG_NETFILTER
is set (make sure "Network packet filtering" is
enabled).

If you don't find them please go back through the
patch process and look for errors.  Post them here or
e-mail me.  Did you find a patch for your exact kernel
version somewhere?  If so, where?

Yes, I have CONFIG_NETFILTER set.

 From what I understand, I need to apply two patches.  the first one 
(kernel patch) I found at  http://www.linuximq.net/ 
It's labeled for 2.4.24, or 2.4.25.  This is the one I applied to kernel 
sources.

Now the confusing part, they say I need to patch my iptables , since I 
am using a package from Debian, I'm not sure how to do this, I'm 
guessing I need this iptables patch in place before the IMQ options will 
show in menuconfig.

The FAQ I'm looking at to do this is here

iptables provides a module and a userspace interface
for configuring netfilter.  While you need the kernel
hooks that CONFIG_NETFILTER provides, the kernel
should be fully buildable independent of the iptables
source package.  You would need the patched iptables
though as the IMQ patch basically extends the
netfilter/iptables system.

With Debian it might be best to just 'apt-get remove
iptables' and then download the 1.2.6a version of
iptables from
http://www.netfilter.org/files/iptables-1.2.6a.tar.bz2
, patch, build and install it.  I couldn't find an IMQ
patched version in the apt-get repos but you might
have more luck.

Now the way the IMQ options are missing in the kernel
configuration menus is interesting.  Check
linux/drivers/net/Config.in for references to IMQ. 
You could also check for the presence of
linux/drivers/net/imq.c.  If nothing turns up in a
'grep -r IMQ *' in your linux source directory
something apparently went wrong with the patch.

Good luck.

Regards,
Technoumena

Back when I was a kid, I used to write li'l AppleBASIC programs to draw
interesting geometric figures in hi-res graphics.  

I have no idea how to write a program that draws simple graphical
figures under Linux.  What modern language would a fellow use to do
silly little things like that in X?  TCL?  Perl?  Python?  

I'd rather not fool around with something special-purpose and heavy,

There's always postscript.  I've got some cool mandalas I did in
Postscript and had printed on big 3'x3' sheets.  Pretty fun.

I'm 90% sure it's a Belkin F5U103. (I'll double-check when I get home
tonight.) It looks just like this one:

<http://www.dijitalcenter.com/content_files/prd_images/Belkin/F5U103.jpg>

It has a DB-9 and a mini-DIN connector. I'm not sure what the mini-DIN
is for -- PS/2? It fits a Mac serial cable, but Mac serial ports were
RS-422. Anyhow...

I started from scratch with good luck but the thing still won't see imq.

I downloaded fresh kernel source 2.4.25
I patched this source with linux-2.4.24-imq.diff
I downloaded iptables-1.2.6a
I patched this source with iptables-1.2.6a-imq.diff-3
I ran patch-o-matic and added IMQ
I compiled the kernel with options for - IMQ target support > IMQ  and 
Network device support > IMQ
rebooted with new kernel
chmod +x extensions/.IMQ-test* in the iptables source directory
ran a make and make install to install the new iptables. it installed fine.
iptables -V = v1.2.6a

I also compiled kernel with full QoS support and most of the networking 
options.

Now, when I attempt to attach the imq0 device to the qdisc it shoots 
back this error. > Cannot find device "imq0"

qdisc works just fine with htb but still no imq.

Any ideas here? Thanks a bunch.

Subject: [PLUG] Restoring an installation
Message-ID: <20040402073307.59345.qmail@web9604.mail.yahoo.com>

I am by now convinced of the importance of using
backup utilities. I have a Linux installation that is
partly functional but does not load kernel modules for
some reason, an important shortcoming. As I send this
message, I'm using Windows.

It occurred to me to make another Linux partition on
my system and install the same distribution from CD's.
Then I suppose I should use rsync to copy files that
do not yet exist in the newly-created installation. I
heard that this was one of the uses of rsync: it does
what xxcopy does for Windows. That, of course, would
even take care of .bash_profile.

There will be a few remaining problems, perhaps. Any
configuration file that is hard-coded with /dev/hdxx
might act up, except for /etc/fstab, which should be
correct. And files like smb.conf and cupsd.conf should
be overwritten on a case-by-case basis.

After that, I should probably clone the installation I
am using so that restoring it will be more
straightforward in the future. So wha't my question?
Is the approach using rsync in my present situation
basically sound?

What level do you want to operate on (close to the hardware, far away)?
How much graphics power do you want (just 2D, lines and boxes vs full
3D)? What level of language (C, scripting)? Is portability a concern?

All of these could effect the answer.

Why not just boot with a rescue disk and repair the problem?

I don't see any reason for something as drastic as a reinstall... unless
you want to move to a distribution that never requires reinstalls.

You left out an important piece of information, how would he fix it? 
"depmod -a"?  Might not even need the rescue disk for that.

Well with this, the comment about the Tubes and Rich recommending a

GLL must be a Ham radio op to know tubes.

either that or AGE is showing it's ugly head around here.

Thanks to all for the valuable comments and advice on tools.
I'm hoping to put together a decent set today if I'm able.

Thanks to all the list for tolerating this intrusion into the normal

We may be onto something:

"Under /etc there should be either a file called
modules.conf or a file called conf.modules. More often
and with the more recent distributions it will be
modules.conf (therefore I will be using that name in
the sequel). This file contains instructions for the
kernel (for modprobe and depmod to be more precise)
which modules have to be loaded in case of demand. "

Anyhow, what do we find? There is no conf.modules and
modules.conf contains this, and only this:

/lib/modules/2.4.21-0.13/kernel/3rdparty/3c90x/3c90x.o.gz:
/lib/modules/2.4.21-0.13/kernel/3rdparty/3c990/3c990x.o.gz:
/lib/modules/2.4.21-0.13/kernel/

I suspect that's not right, but if this is the problem
it would entail preparing such a file from scratch.
Does someone have a sample file?

We just got a Sonicwall (not my decision ... ) and I had been thinking 
about asking this when the rumor first floated around about getting it.

I know very little about them but it seems you get your check book out 
over and over.  10 connection license then when you need more you get the 
check book out again, and again, and again.

To those familiar with these things, what class/type of Linux box would it
take -- if possible -- to get the same functionality as the two lower end
Sonicwall boxes provide?

Hi Aaron.

Although you did say 'modern language', you might
enjoy the familiar usage of Blassic, a BASIC
interpreter:
http://www.arrakis.es/~ninsesabe/blassic/

You might try one of the SDL adaptions.  If you are
familiar with (or want to learn) C, there are several
libraries with 2D primitives such as:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sagl
http://sdl-draw.sourceforge.net/
http://www.ferzkopp.net/~aschiffler/Software/SDL_gfx-2.0/
http://freshmeat.net/projects/sge/

An easier approach if you don't know C is to use
Pygame, a Python interface to SDL and friends:
http://pygame.seul.org/

There is a good Python package building on Pygame with
primitives and even a turtle graphics module:
http://www.nongnu.org/pygsear/

Python with Tkinter might be a good start as you
probably already have it installed.  In particular,
check out the turtle module:
http://www.python.org/doc/2.3.3/lib/module-turtle.html

You can try it very easily; just start python (by
entering 'python' on the command line) and do the
following:

import turtle
t = turtle.Pen()
t.circle(20)

Python is very easy to learn and is very versatile
language.  I would recommend Python + Tkinter/Turtle
the most.

Regards,
Technoumena

If you mean really simple, Quickbasic has been ported
to Linux (and works under emulation as well). 

I've heard good things about Qt, which is related to
KDE in some way. It's capable, but probably not really simple.

I'm gonna toot my own horn here and tell you the SnapGear units I sell
(http://nakedape.cc/products/hardware/snapgear) are comparable to the
SonicWall, but not limited to a set number of IP addresses and include
IPSEC and PPTP VPN support.  Like the SonicWalls, they include an easy
web interface for management, plus SSH and telnet access for access to
embedded versions of regular Linux/UNIX network utilities (ping,
traceroute, etc).

For DIY, a Soekris (http://www.soekris.com/) unit makes a nice firewall
if you want to use LEAF (http://leaf.sourceforge.net/) or other embedded
firewall distributions.  The Soekris units are 100-266MHz AMD i586-class
chips with 32-128MB RAM and connectors for CompactFlash, PCMCIA,
mini-PCI, 2+ NICs, etc.  I've used them to make wireless access points
and they're pretty good.

  Qt is a GUI widget library written in C++. It competes with gtk+ (C) as a
GUI widget library for application interfaces. FWIW, and just as a personal
preference, I prefer the "look and feel" of gtk+ to qt. But, to do graphics
coding I'd use something completely different.

This is not what this file should look like; from my laptop I've got
entries like this:

alias eth0 e100
alias usb-controller usb-uhci
alias eth1 orinoco_pci
alias tty-ldisc-11 irtty
alias char-major-161 ircomm-tty
alias nsc-ircc dongle_id=0x09
alias irda0 nsc-ircc
alias floppy off

Note that it might also be called /etc/modprobe.conf, which is I think
the new preferred name.

I like it.  Do you know of any feature/version comparisons to SonicWall?  
(BTW, the on-line emulator link is broken.)  I wanted to hint that there 
are other solutions buy having it up on my screen.  Bummer.

For myself, if I ever have to replace my Asante at home, this looks real 
nice.

To answer your question totally directly in terms of processing power and
memory requirements, you could use a 486 with 16MB of RAM to duplicate
this functionality with a 2.4 kernel, iptables, and a DHCP server.

If you're using a model with VPN capability, you'll probably want a faster
box (pentium class -- the bigger the better on the proc side) and double
the RAM and you'll need to run an OpenVPN service on the firewall box.
There are floppy and CD based distribution in existence to do this.

And while I'm a strong proponent of the floppy firewall, there are some
very fine off the shelf products out there that will do the job at a low
cost and have a smaller physical and power-consumption footprint.

My jobs lately have been using the Netgear FV[SM]318 boxes, but that's
just because I had a line on some really good quality refurbs at a really
low price.

Wil's suggestions are all great.  I'm a fan of the Soekris products, too.
They give you the flexibility of a self-managed linux box on common
hardware with the size and power of a special purpose unit.  They're a
little bit more expensive, though, in many cases.

I'm really only posting to answer the first part of your question which
doesn't really need to be answered, but should be because you asked it.

Message-ID: <20040403011722.GB30362@gate.kl-ic.com>

This isn't exactly Linux specific, but many of you travel with laptops
so you may be interested.

Last night I was at PLUG with a new toy from Fry's, an NCHARGE 130
(130 Watt-hour) external Li-Ion battery pack.  This gizmo can be
charged from my Thinkpad AC adapter, and provides an additional
6 hours of operation (in addition to my power-guzzling T30's normal
2 hours).  That gets me across the country on an airplane without
hunting down wall sockets in hub airports.   It charges in about
70 minutes, longer if in series with an operating, charging T30.

It costs $260, with an additional $25 for the Thinkpad adapter.
Not cheap, but cheaper than three spare batteries for the T30.
The unit weighs 3 lbs, and is laptop-sized but half an inch thick.

I also considered ordering an Electrovaya Powerpad 120 PP120-D from
Page Computing in LA ($250+shipping), but that requires a separate
charger and Electrovaya has a bad rep (even worse than Fry's :-( ).

Now all I have to worry about is carrying around the energy equivalent
of a stick of dynamite.  The unit is NOT allowed in checked baggage,
I must carry it on board with me, and if they tighten the rules I will
have a high-tech doorstop.

Keith

P.S. Thanks to Keith Packard for showing me his NCHARGE unit.

What functionality do need?  The easy web setup, the VPN's, the virus
scanning, or the slow processor?  A list of needs would help narrow down
the many options.

Good Luck,

I forgot what distribution you are running.  Can you manually load
modules?  If not, what is the exact error?

Anyway, here is a copy of my Debian Sid modules.conf.

Hope it gives you some clues.

Ah, thanks; I've updated the link.  SnapGear was recently purchased by
CyberGuard and some of their links have changed.

So who is going to Linuxfest in Bellingham?  

Suggestions for cheap/good motels?  Places with wifi and no TV? :-)

Socializing Saturday night?  Do folks hang out and party?

I plan to spend the whole day, so I will be going up Friday evening the
16th and coming back Sunday morning the 18th.  Ride-sharing and room
sharing is possible.  

My complications: My wife is maybe going, I may stay with friends in
Tacoma/Gig Harbor Saturday night.  Or not.  TBD over the next few days.

Plane flights are $300rt, no way.

All,

I'm helping a group track down someone one their mailing list who has gotten the
W32/Netsky.p at MM virus. That person keeps blasting the entire list with infected
mails. I was hoping someone might have tips on how to track down the
individual. Personally I would start with the mail server logs, but beyond that
I'm a newbie.

The company I work for is spread out to 3 offices and we have 3 Snapgear 
SME570s boxes and they're an impressive little box. The case is the 
size of an 8 port switch and has a hardware encryption engine which I 
think supports something like 500 VPN tunnels. 

We've got a VPN setup between our offices and have a few telecommuters 
that have dedicated firewall/VPN boxes at home. The box supports IPSec, 
L2TP, GRE, and PPTP so it gives a company quite a bit of flexibility in 
allowing VPN connections. Most non-tech people have a Netgear FVS318 
firewall at home and we have others using FreeS/WAN on Linux, and I'm 
using "isakmpd" on an OpenBSD firewall for my tunnel into the office.

For the non-tech users that travel with a Windows laptop a simple to 
configure VPN client is the way to go and that client should completely 
isolate the box from any other network so the Windows box cannot be 
hijacked and uses as a conduit into the VPN. I don't have a lot of 
experience with Windows VPN but I was given a "Nortel Contivity" client 
so I could remotely support a demo system we have setup in the Midwest 
and it does exactly like I describe and totally cuts my laptop off from 
all external network access expect the VPN connection.

I only had to enter a userid, password and the IP address of the remote 
gateway to get the Nortel client configured and working and this is the 
sort of client that a non-technical road-warrior users should be given 
for VPN access IMHO. 

The only downside with this solution is the client is Windows-based and 
so for people using Linux or something I don't know if the remote 
gateway would work with a standard IPSec client under Linux. It looks 
like a Diffie-Hellman Group II 3DES/SHA IPSec tunnel from looking at 
some of information dialogs on the client software.

I've met resistance from management on getting a good VPN client for our 
Windows users as they feel that WinXP's PPTP support and built-in 
firewalling is good enough even through the firewalling is disabled by 
default. My fear is that a user can easily disabled the firewalling 
either accidently or intentionally opening a remote client up to being 
hijacked at some point.

Sorry for my long posting which is a bit offtopic...

Try looking at the Received headers in the email.  Most important is the 
last one, which if you are lucky, will have the IP address of the 
sending machine.  Reverse DNS or whois will tell you the ISP.  You may 
be able to correlate this with other email sent by the subscriber.

I have noticed that IP address can be pretty easy to spot with the virus 
email.  One of our clients got blasted and the IP address was the same 
for all of them.

Subject: [PLUG] anyone got a 250meg Iomega ZIP drive?
Message-ID: <86vfkfck73.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

My dad has recently abruptly begun experiencing read failures on his
ATAPI Iomega ZIP 250 drive.  My first suspicion was just media
failure, but all his media started failing at once and at about the
same spot, even previously unused blank media.  Reformatting doesn't
actually even succeed well enough to test.  When I try to dd off the
drive from KNOPPIX, it seems to start failing around sector 246-248k.
Under windows 2k, the retries pretty much kill the machine.

That is starting to sound like a drive failure rather than a media
failure.  A new drive is around $60 or $100.  Before we buy one, does
someone have one we could try one of the disks in?  Alternatively, has
anyone seen one at FreeGeek's thrift store?

Thanks for the information. I've been away over the
weekend, but am returning to the task (defined as
follows: following a system crash, I have a system
that boots, but does not load kernel modules. There is
input from the keyboard, output to the monitor, and no
X-server. As a result, I learned VI!)

I should have a "mirror" of this installation on
another partition, anyhow. If the kernel of the new
installation differs in size from that of the old one,
I am going to assume that it is very likely corrupt
and replace the kernel. If the results are
interesting, I may share them with the list.

There are not any "tested" units, but I have a stack of about 20 waiting to 
test, that I have not looked at yet.  I won't know until I go back in on

Russell,

Have you looked at the cabling?  I have had cabling come loose on old
systems seems that the contacts get tired because of some strain on the
cables and after a few years the cable backs out.  Or if the system is
moved or kicked, cable jump off, too.

  My fiancee uses sylpheed and is working exclusively on her laptop. I set
it up to get mail via pop3 from the server and it worked fine for a while.
Now, however, whenever she logs in (laptop or workstation), sylpheed comes
up with a user authentication error, suggesting it's a bad password.

  Where do I start looking for the source of the problem? In a sylpheed
config file, some place on the server?

You might want to google for "click of death" and see:

I have heard of some cases where effected can affect other drives.

Have you changed your password at aracnet?  Is she checking mail there?
Or are you doling out mail from your server?  Not familiar with

Excellent questions.

I'm looking to do basic 2-D figures (lines, points) in X using a
commonly-used interpreted language.  I've been thinking Perl or Python
with TK, but that's one of hundreds of options.

When I was a kid, I had AppleBasic (and later, GW-Basic).   What would
you point a smart 12-year-old kid at to get 'im started down the garden

Could this be the notorious "Click Death" that plagues IOmega Zip and Jaz

There's a link to a fellow that has a kind of temporary fix for some
situations and links to more info on the problem.

Nope, no clicking really in evidence.  After downloading a KNOPPIX
image and burning it to CD (is there a reason that Mozilla downloads
abort when the screen saver kicks in on w2k?), dd'ing from /dev/sda4
to a file, I got to about sector 246xxx before the read failed.
Seeking past it by 8 sectors, I could read a varying number of blocks
before getting another read error.  Always, skipping 8 sectors let me
read more data.  I was on chunk 7 when I learned that the data still
existed on the hard disk so actual recovery wasn't necessary.  When
switching media, we found that the errors didn't start occurring until
similarly near the middle of the media.

In addition to the one noted above, the KNOPPIX burning sub-project
had another surprise: cygwin's rsync would recreate all of the
pre-existing data, but then stall before actually making any progress
in completing the file.  That is, mozilla's download had aborted at,
say, 200meg.  Rsync would (with the --progress option) furiously
recreate the amount of data already present, then basically stop.
This was violated the principle of least astonishment.  I eventually
installed cygwin's wget and used the -c (continue) option, which
worked.

Ken,

  I run postfix here and I have the same problem whether I direct sylpheed
to 'salmo.appl-ecosys.com' or 'mail.appl-ecosys.com'. Both synonyms are in
/etc/hosts. That's why I'm puzzled.

Thanks,

  I have come to believe that computers -- regardless of OS -- sense my
fiancee's dislike of them and go into attack mode just to be annoying and to
increase her frustration with them. Dogs also know when people are afraid of
them and become very dominant in response.

  In addition to the Sylpheed mail problem (which appears sporatically, but
infrequently enough that I forget where I hit it to get it working again),
there's the new issue of OpenOffice.org-1.1.0 shutting down when the Help
menu is accessed. I've not experienced this at all, has anyone? It happens
when we select "Help", then click on "Contents". There's a pause while the
ol' ThinkPad 600E considers the request, then only the desktop remains: OO.o
is gone.

  The last issue -- for now, at least -- is how to configure mozilla so she
can mail Web pages to others. I've looked at the mozilla help sections for
both Web browsing and mail/Usenet but see nothing on mailing a Web page (as
opposed to copying the URL to a mail message). Any ideas where I should look
for a HOWTO?

TIA,

Rich

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0404050754390.31372-100000@uplinknetworks.dyndns.org>

I have two IP addresses assigned to the WAN side of my Linux router.  The
router is running Arno's IPTables Script:

http://rocky.molphys.leidenuniv.nl/

I have certain ports open on the first interface, eth0, but I want those
same ports blocked on the aliased interface, eth0:0.  Is this possible?
I've tried several different commands, but none block incoming connections
to eth0:0, such as:

iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -d {eth0:0-ip} -j DROP
iptables -A INPUT -i eth0:0 -d {eth0:0-ip} -j DROP
iptables -A INPUT -d {eth0:0-ip} -j DROP

Derek,

  Nothing in /var/log/maillog, but with your prompting, I found several
instances in /var/log/messages:

Apr  4 19:51:15 salmo ipop3d[31502]: Login failed user=pamela auth=pamela host=pachy.appl-ecosys.com [192.168.55.5]

  There is no man page for ipop3d. What do I read to figure out why it
failed.

Many thanks,

Seems like there should be something in /usr/share/doc/ipop3d, but I use
qpopper, so I really don't know.

Can she log into the server using another method, say ssh?

Check both machines for free disk space, I had an issue like this that
turned out to be a partition running out of room, but the setup was more
complicated than what you are doing.

Me I've got an Asante at home.  Sonicewall will never see the inside of my

recommendations for them from one of the larger support companies in the

I'm still having an ordinary day. It might be helpful
if someone currently using Mandrake 9.1 "Bamboo" would
send me their kernel. (I'm referring to the compiled
kernel, which should appear in the /boot directory as
vmlinuz-2.4.21-0.13mdk.)

I hesitated to send this message, because if everyone

So interpreted 2D. Tcl/Tk sounds like the closest match here, however I
do feel Tcl/Tk is a dead end, I imagine it will be a few years before it
is a dead language but the future doesn't look good.

RPN is a bit weird for people who are used to scripting, but Jeme's
mention of PostScript does have merit. Unlike Tcl/Tk, PS isn't going to
die anytime soon. PostScript is also oriented solely at drawing things,
not at producing a GUI with areas for drawing being one widget.

I haven't touched Python or Perl enough to recommend drawing libraries,
though I've seen an awful lot of mentions of "wxPython".

The above are some options. The question is trying to avoid going too
deep.

Might also try one of the game engines. All of the recent FPSes are
deliberately designed with scripting interfaces nowadays. I don't know
how advanced they are, but might be right for handling a 3D engine. Both
of the big FPSes (Unreal Tournament and Quake families) are available for
Linux.

On a more general front Java is still very much alive and usable for
some graphics. The GTK library is also *very* nice.

Why do you say this?  I'm just curious because I was using Python with
Tk and because of the nature of my use it was really slow, so much so,
that I'm considering switching to wxPython.

Java has a lot of overhead  for just drawing  to a pane. I'd stick to
Python.

Scriptics, the company Ousterhout form to support Tcl/Tk, went out of
business a year or more ago.  The death of Scriptics is by no means an
end to the language, but there just isn't a lot of talk about it and I
don't know of anyone actually learning it or using it actively.

Tk itself has problems, due to the lack of Unicode support; not to
mention the grumbling all around about it being a poor API and slow.

I don't follow the Python lists closely, but I do recall reading a
discussion about moving the default Python GUI library to wxWindows.

I have; well, I used the Glade interface.  I haven't really done much
GUI development, so I didn't get very far in the 8-16 hours I played
with it.  I do know PyGTK is the preferred toolkit by Red Hat; it's used
by the GUI admin tools and Anaconda.

Hmm, not really.  I can't think of any major new project that uses it.

Unfortunately, knowlege of postscript isn't really going to help you 
understand much of the commonly used graphics systems.  The raw 
concepts are the same (lines, points etc.), but between the RPN 
syntax and the rest, I just don't think this would be the best place 
to start.

There are other graphics libraries.  wxWidgets (used to be wxWindows) 
is a full windowing library.  Is that what is really needed?  See 
below.

This is a good point.  I am not a gamer nor do I know any, but I did 
work in the VR industry for a while a long time ago.  Even then, 
there were libraries that allowed you to script 3D.  This might be a 
bit much though.  It is a lot harder to do interesting and 
nice-looking things in 3D than most people think.  The potential for 
frustration is very high.

I think all of these are pretty difficult to start with.  They require 
a fair number of concepts to be understood before anything can 
happen.  Still, PyQt or PyGTK might be good.  There are some good 
tutorials online.  There are bindings for both Qt and GTK for Ruby 
and Perl too.  I vastly prefer Qt over GTK, but that's due to my 
distaste for faking OO in C.  Sure, you can do it, but I've done it 
in assembly too.  It still doesn't work as nicely as a real OO 
system.

If you just want graphics, the GD library works well.  It isn't 
interactive, but you can make some nice images with it.  There are 
wrappers for Python and Perl.  I've used the Perl module to do 
prototypes for code I later rewrote in C.  The module was on CPAN.  
The Python wrapper is also OO and is here:

http://freshmeat.net/projects/pythongd/

Plus, GD comes with most distros.  The main GD site is here:

http://www.boutell.com/gd/

One of the nice things about GD is that is is actually very simple C 
code.  It isn't spectacularly fast, but if you ever want to dig into 
it and see how it all works, it is quite easy to understand.  Except 
maybe for the PNG and JPEG encoders :-)

While I'm not a Python person, it does seem like a really easy 
language to learn and it supposedly very good for people starting 
out.  Perl is probably _not_ the best first language to learn.  All 
the sigils....  And, I normally program in Perl :-)  I just don't 
know enough about Ruby to say either way.  The interactive command 
line tools for Python and Ruby are really handy when you are learning 
the languages.

You might want to look at what language seems best suited and then 
figure out what libraries are supported.

Best,
Kyle

There don't appear to be many new programs coming out that use Tcl/Tk.
I'm led to believe there have been API compatibility problems with
various revisions of Tcl/Tk. It is rather difficult to tie into Tcl/Tk
for anything but scripting. Okay, I can't be certain, but I have this
feeling that Tcl/Tk are (perhaps very) slowly dying. I've never touched
wxPython, but a lot of projects do seem to be using it.

Never touched the Python bindings, though I believe you're correct that
they exist. Add another candidate, though once again GTK is a GUI layer
on top of X (or MacOS, or...). This reminds me, for simple, pure 2D
drawing, the underlying library, GDK, might be a viable option.

Thanks. It's good for "at a glance" filesystem usage.

	I'm trying to set it up so that I can enter a directory to scan
manually, (defaulting to /) However, I'm not having very much luck with it.
I can save the variable that I enter to a file but I can't get variable back
into the filelight command line. 

Maybe someone could take a look at what I have so far?
(script to be posted when I get home.. Kind of late)

Derek,

  Sure. It's only sylpheed.

  Lots of room.

qpopper is a nice package - lots of configuration possibilities.
I recommend reading the documentation first and specifying the
configuration options rather than taking the defaults.

Why not just grab the rpm from Mandrake?

If that one is gone, I should have a copy in my archives.

Message-ID: <20040406022441.23530.qmail@web9602.mail.yahoo.com>

I downloaded the Russian version of KNOPPIX last
night, and already had the English version. Anyhow, I
mentioned that the "bootable" disk wouldn't boot on my
computer (in either language version). Making a boot
floppy is easy, however, and solves that problem.

What surprised me was that, since a pleasant female
voice announced the beginning of the startup sequence,
my ac97 sound card is not supported. (I opened
Gnomemeeting, and was informed that no sound card was
detected. When I tried to set it up, it was said not
to be supported.)

Apart from the conventional distributions that have
detected the sound card automatically, there have been
three bootable, or semi-bootable (in the above sense)
ones to play pleasant MIDI music with my sound card:
SuSE, Mandrake, and Blin, the latter smaller than 200
MB. KNOPPIX has many impressive features, but until it
supports sound on my system, it is likely to remain a curiosity.

If you're interested in something to use as a teaching language for
a kid with no previous experience, Tcl/Tk, Perl, Java, etc might
be a bit much.

I know that posting this suggestion to a Linux mailing list might
border on sacrilegious, but you might check out
  http://www.simplecodeworks.com/website.html

It's a programming language developed as a teaching language by
Gary Koffler, who I know peripherally from the old Amiga days. 
Gary goes back a long ways, was part of Datamost and developed
stuff (mostly games) for the C64, Apple II, Atari, etc.

It is probably due to the CD-ROM drive.  There are a couple of different
boot schemes for CD's, some drives don't recognize all of them, CD
readers are fairly inexpensive, or borrow one as a test.

Gibraltar will back up your smirk, except for the cost issue (about 1000
euros if you want the web interface), however the licensing will be much
nicer, no limit to the number of interfaces or connections.  I guess my
point is, the Open Source technology is there, it is just a matter of
what you have to invest in it (time and/or money).  There are other much
less expensive options, but I haven't found any as full featured as
Gibraltar.  It is also being very actively worked on.

I still have eigenstien floppy routers running as firewalls for both
small and medium sized companies.  The hardware was free and I very
rarely have to do anything to them.  I just invested a little time (ok,
a lot of time) in figuring out how to configure them.

Good Luck,

An interesting option for introducing kids to
programming is Squeak, a modern, education-oriented
Smalltalk implementation:
http://www.squeakland.org/

After trying Python and even C what worked best with
my kids was actually Mathematica (~$150 academic
license):
http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/index.html

They really groked the ideas of functions, input and
output and variables and it was easy to put to
graphics.  This was when they were just four and six
years old.  Octave with gnuplot (I know you said
something that wasn't heavy like that) pales in
comparison but would do the trick in a pinch.

The questions of whether to use TCL/TK, GTK, Qt,
WxWindows, etc bindings for Python is (IMO) more
important for GUI applications than for programmatic
2D drawing.  The reason TCL/TK is often used is that
it is highly cross-platform.  I'd prefer Pygame
(SDL-based) because its library is focused on graphics
programming rather than UI design but there are other
good Python graphics packages such as:
http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/

There is another option that might be very interesting
to you: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).
http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/
http://www.svg.org/

I think SVG could very probably be the one I would
choose if I was looking for a language like you
described.

This is a contradiction, if Knoppix is talking to you, it must be using
the onboard sound.  The command "lsmod" should confirm whether or not
the sound modules are loading (I don't recall the name of the VIA sound
module, but sound-core should be there and linked to the rest).

I know that the kernel Knoppix is using does support that sound chip, so
you are probably having minor configuration problems.

It will even create a persistent user environment that can be saved to
that medium.

IIRC, Scriptics was a victim of VC financing. Ousterhout wanted help
with the business side of things, the suits who came in decided that
there wasn't enough money in Tcl/Tk, & dropped support.

Tk appears to have some life left to it: there is a Perl module that
supports it, which makes creating dialogue boxes fairly simple under X.
I haven't played with Perl/Tk for a couple of years, so I don't know
the current state of its development. (Maybe Randal or another of the
Perl gurus out there might want to offer his opinion on this matter.)

However, more important to the original poster, Tk was intended to
support menus, dialogue boxes, & other GUI stuff. I see from my copy of
_Advanced Perl Programming_ that one can create a Tetris game with
Perl/Tk, but for other graphical applications it probably isn't a
wise choice.

I glanced at those scripts, and it looks like it would take some heavy
modification to support two external interfaces.  Do you have the

Wait a minute, aren't eth0 and eth0:0 the same interface?  When I set up
multiple interfaces on the same card, the first is eth0 and the second
is eth0:1, I used to have to change eth0 to eth0:0, but not any more.

Perl-Tk is being actively developed... in fact, there's just been
another major release a few weeks ago, and I just got a client who
wanted a Perl-Tk session added to classes they were buying from me
(think "Large Data Warehouse Company" who wants to automate their
trouble alert systems with easy-to-build GUIs).

Actually, Perl/Tk is quite fast - I just finished a real-time graphics
scrolling loadav display, and was amazed to find out that it draws all
the line segments from scratch each time.

But no, I'd not want to write Quake using Perl/Tk. :)

Twas wondering if any of you have ever experianced this issue with 
Belkin KVM?

The problem is when you switch back and forth, when you get to a X 
session, the mouse behaves all erratic and goes crazy.  This can be 
fixed by switching between X sessions (ctl-alt-f8, then ctl-alt-f7) but 
this is annoying at best. Does anyone know of a better KVM switch that 
fixes this problem or is this just a linux driver issue.    I've used 
both Microsoft mice and Logitech 3 buttom wheel mice.

I've solved this problem by resetting the X session with a <Ctrl> <Alt>
<Backspace> myself.

Hopefully there's a better solution out there......

Have you tried using gpm for the mouse interface?  From my experience,
it is much smarter than the X drivers, and if worse comes to worse,
/etc/init.d/gpm restart will reset the mouse.

Just a thought,

Actually, no. I've got a Belkin Omni View PRO 4-Port KVM on my desk,
which I use with some regularity, and I've never had mouse troubles
with it at all.

I've had this problem with some cheapo 2 port KVMs, Belkin OmniPro 4 
ports, 8 ports and 16 port switches. I've seen the problem with Linux, 
Windows, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, Tru64, and FreeBSD.

In short, this is not usually a driver issue.

What I have been told by folks at Belkin, and a couple of Electronic 
Engineers, is that it's a clock mismatch issue.

Basically, there is a clock in the mouse, on each motherboard, and in 
the KVM. When they get out of sync, the mouse behaves erratically.

My fix in the past has been to unplug/replug the mouse in the KVM. This 
causes the mouse to "reboot" and the clock syncs up.

I'm sure there is a more technical explaination, and I'm simply 
repeating what I have been told.

If any of it is in error, I'd love to hear a better explaination.

You'll want to separate the spam from the good stuff (aka "ham"), then
run sa-learn:

  sa-learn --showdots --spam /path/to/spam
  sa-learn --showdots --ham  /path/to/ham

You'll need to do that for both you and your fiancee.

Also, you'll want to poke around the Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf man page
(or its perldoc equivalent). Here's a slightly edited version of my
~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file:

  version_tag        ph20040310.0

Recall that Rich uses pine, so his stuff is likely mbox.

Add --mbox to the command line and use wildcards to match the mboxen
themselves.

  Thanks, Paul.

  I've not saved any spam so I'll need to start collecting some in a new
~/mail/spam file. In the meantime, I suppose that I can pick any file in my
mail collection (e.g., ~/mail/plug, ~/mail/linux) and train SA to one of
those as 'ham'.

> Also, you'll want to poke around the Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf man page

  All in due time. :-)

Thanks,

  ps2pdf

  Any time you need to find if there's a tool for a given task, try the
'apropos' command. For example, do 'apropos ps' and you'll see what's
available in the whereis database.

Must'a'used to have been a long time ago, then. You can use any number
you want. You can start with eth0:99 if that floats your boat. (And
you can even rename eth0 to whatever you want.)

More on topic:

ISTR something about iptables matching for alias interfaces working
better in 2.6? I can't google up anything solid though, sorry.

Vincent,

  Could be. I've never encountered this regardless of how the PostScript
file was generated. However, I have two suggestions for you:

  1) Run the command as a user. Save running as 'root' for when you must do
so. Decrease the pain of an inadvertent error.

  2) Read the ps2pdf man page. It may tell you something about the fonts it
wants.

I'd start by looking at the "Full Headers" of the email message and
examining the Received: chain. It can help you figure out who his ISP
is at least.

I use a linksys 2 port kvm. I was experiencing the problem you mention when I was using one of the drivers that supports the wheel on the mouse. Since I switched to a more generic driver (I think I am using 3 buttom mouse driver) I have not had this problem. In my case I had to choose between the wheel, or the problem. I sacrificed the wheel for my sanity.

Been looking on the web for such a creature yesterday and today but no 
luck so far.  Using both freshmeat and google I've been trying out various 
tools such as tcptrace, ntop, and stak.  They do give me analytical 
output, but it still requires a decent knowledge of tcp/ip to make heads 
or tails of it.  Just wondering if list members have come across any other 
tools that wouldn't make a non-techie person to cross their eyes, scratch 
their heads in bewilderment and mutter something to the effect of 
"freakin' geeks."

Personally, I quite like iftop.


Anyways, I think you need to be more clear about what you want with
"Executive Summary"? Current/recent connections? Log of "significant"
connections? What?

Oh, and I may have been thrown off by your mentioning "ntop" &co, as I
noticed your subject line suggests postanalysis of tcpdump snaps. For
that, I highly recommend ethereal (and from what I read on the net,
I'm firmly in the majority).

Again, clarify! :-)

As a side comment (I can't contribute as I don't run X on my servers
in general, so I've never tried to solve this):

I received a near-mint 8-port Belkin OSD KVM. It does this, yes, and
it's use of the Scroll Lock key is infuriating. I could go into other
details for why I don't like it. I'd never *buy* one. I'd only go
Cybex/Avocent anymore. Although for personal solutions probably a bit
hefty. Just the same, I can't look a gift horse in the mouth, so I
persevere.

I've had this problem with some cheapo 2 port KVMs, Belkin OmniPro 4 
ports, 8 ports and 16 port switches. I've seen the problem with Linux, 
Windows, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, Tru64, and FreeBSD.

In short, this is not usually a driver issue.

What I have been told by folks at Belkin, and a couple of Electronic 
Engineers, is that it's a clock mismatch issue.

Basically, there is a clock in the mouse, on each motherboard, and in 
the KVM. When they get out of sync, the mouse behaves erratically.

My fix in the past has been to unplug/replug the mouse in the KVM. This 
causes the mouse to "reboot" and the clock syncs up.

I'm sure there is a more technical explaination, and I'm simply 
repeating what I have been told.

If any of it is in error, I'd love to hear a better explaination.

Hoo, boy... the hardware geeks and low-level hackers will give you the
real skinny on this, but basically the PS/2 protocol wasn't designed to be
hotpluggable.

That said, many hardware and software implementations do some nifty things
to rescan the bus or whatever and make connections or reconnections on a
running system work.

The answer is "Yeah... but don't be surprised if you can't."

I'd always heard that the PS/2 interface was not designed for that, and
that there was significant chance of hardware damage.

Can't site a reference, maybe it's just superstition.

Ok, thanks for the feedback, I gather there are problems with this issue 
everywhere.

My first question would be, is there anyway to hotkey rescan the bus 
mouse? abviously switching X sessions does this and fixes the problem, 
but it's annoying when switching back and forth a lot.

My second question would be, how can we fix this issue, what part of 
GNU/Linux would we have to fix to get this to work.  I must point out 
that this never happens when switching back to a microsoft desktop, so I 
know it's got to be something that we can fix, just probably isn't that 
important at the moment.

The sound actually does work. I tried to use
Gnomemeeting, which complained that there was no sound
card, even though there was sound. If I want to use
Gnomemeeting, at least the read-only version I have,
it must need to be configured differently.

If I had to guess, I would say that the switch was to blame rather than
the kernel or any mouse daemon.

I'm guessing here that your KVM switch doesn't properly emulate a
connected mouse and keyboard on the output ports when they are not
connected to the input ports.  The switch to another port is like plugging
in the mouse/keyboard again and that's causing problems.  That is to say,
the KVM vendor is breaking the protocol and expecting the system
hardware/software to take up the slack.

A proper KVM switch shouldn't cause those problems... that is to say, the
KVM switch should do absolutely nothing to the signal to or from the
systems to which it is attached.  The system shouldn't get anything
different than a directly connected mouse and keyboard.

Check to make sure that the appropriate sound daemon knows which card to
use and if gnomemeeting has an output plug-in architecture, check to see
that the proper output plugin is selected.

This sort of problem comes up with newly installed XMMS and ESD systems
all the time.  The problem with Knoppix is that it's ALWAYS a newly
installed system and therefore has to do some pretty heavy magic to avoid
these problems.

I HAVE had it happen with Belkin KVM connected to Windows desktops. 
Several different models.

However, another dept. at work with a Raritan setup doesn't seem to ever 
have a problem. But then, I think they spent upwards of $10k for their 
kvm setup too.

For $500, the 16 port switch does reasonably well. At $100, the 4 port 
does well too.

I wouldn't bother.  I've had very poor luck with the Bayes filter in
spamassassin.  Even after training it for months I found that the
spamassassin settings resulted in more messages getting through because
the Bayes algorithm thought they weren't spam than if I weren't using
Bayes at all.  The spammers are on to the Bayes approach and inject random
junk into their spams to defeat them.

I still use Bayes, but it will never reduce the spam score any more, it
will only increase it.  This can be controlled in your
.spamassassin/user_prefs file by adding these lines:

score BAYES_00 0.0
score BAYES_01 0.0
score BAYES_10 0.0
score BAYES_20 0.0
score BAYES_30 0.0
score BAYES_40 0.0
score BAYES_44 0.0

I've done this many times on several different chipsets and operating
systems, the worst that has happened is that the mouse stops working
until the system is restarted (you guessed it, winblows was the usual
loser).  Linux seems to be more resilient, but it could be because I
prefer to run gpm. 

I've never fried a mouse or motherboard this way.

Good Luck,

  I just saw a few messages to this effect on the postfix mail list. As this

Yes perhaps.  But still a horrid event to have to be on the receiving

This is an application I haven't figured out how to
install with a read-only filesystem. Others come to
mind, however. (I couldn't believe that Knoppix even
has Apache, but typing http://localhost in the address
field overcame my skepticism.)

ps2pdf is a convenient way to invoke Ghostscript (gs).
 The error is that Ghostscript isn't able to find some
font in it's search path.  Do 'gs -h' to find out what
the search path.  Please see the following pages for
more information:
http://www.ghostscript.com/pipermail/bug-gs/2001-February/000213.html

http://www.linuxprinting.org/pipermail/epson-list/2002q4/002111.html
leading to when he simply reinstalls the related
software and, lo and behold, the font paths match with
the fonts. :)

The solution may involve installing fonts and/or
recompiling Ghostscript.

I've found it to be more of a bitch to convince a harddrive install of
Knoppix to update/install Debian packages than to just install Debian. 
It isn't that hard, just follow the instructions, by the ninth or tenth

everything you can get your hands on.

I think that I could filter on Bayes scores alone and get great spam
protection.  A quick run through my mailboxes shows that my caught spam
ALL ranks Bayes scores greater than 80 and my regular mail ALL ranks below
50 (except for a couple of specifically whitelisted addresses which
trigger Bayes for their commercial content).  Interestingly, my false
negatives folder lists spam with Bayes ratings from 50-90 -- usually with
some negative scores that artificially lower the score.

I haven't had a false positive spam score since the Bayesian filters
kicked in and I added a couple of the above-mentioned addresses to my
whitelist.

The randomness of the junk actually helps to make it have just about no
effect on Bayesian filtering.

Your datasets seem exceedingly strange.  Have you been feeding it lots of
ham?  Do you have autolearn enabled?

This is actually an increase in score.  Spamassassin gives BAYES_50 a
score of .001.

I think that if you're getting lots of false negatives due to low Bayes
scores, you're not feeding your filters properly.

I tend to feed spamassassin all of the false negatives every fifty
messages or so, so I don't have a large number of false negatives on hand
(I delete them after feeding the sa-learn), but I can show you the stats
from what I have right now:

jbrelin at shaft:~$ grep BAYES_ ./mail/IN.spam.is|cut -d_ -f2 |cut -d,
-f1|uniq -c|sort -n
      1 CREDIT
      1 30
      1 40
      1 80
      3 44
      5 56
      6 90
      9 99
     14 50

OK... so you can discard that first line... I'll have to see what the
input looked like.  But you can see that only 4 of the 41 messages in my
current pack of false negatives (which goes back a few weeks at least)
were attributed negative scores for their Bayesian ranking.

The command above run against my regular inbox (the default drop-box for
mail that isn't filtered based on content or sender and already purged of
actual spam either by spamassassin or by hand) shows no scores over 50 and
most everything hovering in the 00-20 range.

Check the headers.  I am on plug-devel and it didn't show up here (and
it would have even if spamassassin caught it).  I do see it on the
nntp server.  I am thinking maybe it didn't get delivered via drizzle
some other way but got filtered into your plug-foo mailboxes because
of your procmail rules (??).

Actually, it got delivered into my spam box because of procmail rules.
Didn't make it far enough down the list to go to the list boxes.

Unfortunately, I've already deleted it.  But it was addressed to the list
and had the appropriate Subject: header (that is to say, both messages had
the same subject, but with the [PLUG-WHATEVER] prefix).

Ah, I just thought of another possibility.  Since it would have been
delivered to me through aracnet.com, postini (aracnet's spamfilter
service) might have caught it for me, and its missingness for me was a
local thing.  [checking...] Yup, there they are over in postini land.

Never mind.

Seconded.  These challenge-response systems are also responsible

I wouldn't have even tried disabling it if I hadn't heard about the
experience mentioned at:

http://www.rdrop.com/spam/

I was as surprised as anyone that it could be counter-effective.

Most (not all) of my caught spam also has Bayes probabilities over 50.
My false negatives folder has a collection Bayes scores from 00 to 99,
with most of them below 50.

I did find it interesting that none of my auto-caught spam has a Bayes
score of 00, even after I changed the weight on that to 0.0.  Perhaps I
wasn't giving the Bayes filter enough credit.  ;-)

Several of the spams that weren't caught automatically had a Bayes score
of 00.

Yes, and yes.  For quite some time now.

Yeah, maybe I got a bit carried away when I was trimming this out.  ;-)

I don't get lots of false negatives, just enough to be irksome.  The main
problem was that the incorrect Bayes scores would override Spamassassin
correctly categorizing something as spam through other means.

The user_prefs settings fixed this problem, but I'm still left wondering
if it's worth the extra CPU time and disk space to store the Bayes info.

We're using Rekall and so far it has proved to be quite good. It was a
commercial product that was put under a dual license (GPL and commercial
support) about 6 months ago. You can find the commercial version at
http://www.thekompany.com/products/rekall/ and the GPL version at
http://www.rekallrevealed.org/

I have had different problems with a Belkin 4-port KVM. The one I bought
for home gets it's power off of the keyboard line and screws up
constantly. The cap-lock comes on and won't go off. Sometimes it gets into
a control-lock situation where everything typed goes in as a control
character. The OS also complains a lot about keyboard errors. The one I
have at work - which has it's own power supply - works fine.

If your KVM does not have a powersupply, then I would bet that it is the
problem. This was just a bad idea.

I've had these kinds of problems too, but with the ones with power
supplies.  That was a few years ago now, but it happened even with the
$700 16-port Belkins.  OTOH, I've got a couple older 4-ports (one's
actually AT-style keyboard and serial mouse) that I've never had
problems with.

Hi,

The best tech. I've met carried a refillable can of compressed air.  On 
opening a machine, he'd first take it outside and blow out all the 
dust.  Makes it easier on your allergies and improves cooling thereby 
extending the life of the machine.  S/W tools could include a bootable DOS 
diskette (blush), Tom's root boot diskette, Partition Magic 8 on diskette 
and something like Fastwire with it's cable for copying files between PCs 
over a serial or parallel cable.

Cheers,
Mike

Just go through your mail archive and sort through that.  If you're
not keeping a running archive yet, procmail makes it easy.  Just add
this before your other procmail rules.

I tried to impliment this, but procmail complains that it can't write to 
~/mail-backup/04-04.

The file doesn't exist, but the directory ~/mail-backup does. If 
procmail can't create the file, this would break on the first of every 
month.

Suggestions?

Message-ID: <20040408020025.47961.qmail@web9604.mail.yahoo.com>

For those who are not TV addicts, Hauppage's TV
capture card that now sells for $40 (after rebate) at
Circuit City may enable them to do without a bulky
appliance.

It works with Linux, of course. The sound output is
weak, so the user is advised to connect it to the
installed sound card with an included external cable.
When I installed it under Windows, the picture was
fine, but there was no sound except through the TV
card itself. 

It works as specified under Linux, however (xawtv).
Perhaps Hauppage should include a KNOPPIX disk with
the product for the benefit of purchasers with
problems like mine.

Hmm, I noticed I now have a 7 day hole in my archive.  Moving
~/mail-backup to my procmail directory and updating procmail's idea of
where to back up has fixed it.

I've had pretty good results with Bayesian filtering; though I do use a
two level filter (both spamassassin and bogofilter).

Slightly off topic, I got a piece of spam today (a typical quack
medicine / illegal prescription drugs con game) that may have gone to
next level beyond just adding random dictionary words.

This piece of junk had over 60 references to different "web sites",
where the web site names looked like random combinations of dictionary
words and the suffixes ".com", ".org" and ".net".  Interspersed among
those were references to "the" real web sites of the con artist.

What do you mean when you say, "my procmail directory"??

I don't have a "procmail" or ".procmail" directory in my home directory. 
I have a .procmailrc, but that's the rules.

This brings up another question. When I set up a new rule to send mail 
to a new file, I have to touch the file in my ~/mail/ directory, or the 
mail doesn't get put where I want it.

It seems to me that procmail should be able to create these files. It 
changes to be me, as evidenced by the system log file.

The directory in which your mail is going.  For me, this is
~/procmail/ because ~/Mail/ is used by Gnus.

Odd. I've never had that problem. My .procmailrc, for example, begins
this way:

MAILDIR=$HOME/Maildir
LOGFILE=$HOME/pmlog-`/bin/date +%Y-%m`

Every month, it begins a new ~/pmlog-YYYY-MM file, and it seems to get
started right away. The first entry in ~/pmlog-2004-04 arrived about
15 minutes into April:

You're right. It should. <lame-question>Do the permissions on the

You'll just have to ask the author of that document.

Procmail seems to have no trouble writing to the files once they exist. 
It just can't create them if they don't exist.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0404080943410.3700-100000@uplinknetworks.dyndns.org>

I have a tab-delimited text file that I'm inserting into a database.  The
first three fields need to be unique.  Sometimes the text file has
duplication of the first three fields, but the rest is different, so I
can't simply use "sort -u" to remove the dups.  The first occurance of the
dupe is always the one that I want removed.

Any suggestions on a way to find the dups and remove the first occurance?

Build a perl script that uses a three-level hash where the key is a string
that is all other fields.  Each line will be add or modify an entry in the hash.

At the end, you'll have a hash with all unique keys where the values are
the last-most seen.

If the order of the file is important, use something like a supplementary
array to keep the original order or use a tied array like Tie::IxHash

Do a select based on those three fields.  If you get a "hit", replace the 
record with the current one.  If you don't, insert the line as a new 
record.

I hope that makes sense.  I need more coffee.

I generally let the content dictate where I reply.  Situational as it 
were.  I have seen convincing reasons for top, bottom and inline.  To me 
it is like vi vs emacs.  I especially hate a 5000 word email with one 
sentence at the bottom.  If it were at the top I could read it and 
delete it.  But that said what I really disagree with is people that try 
to dictate how things should be because that is how they were taught. 
If people didn't do things differently what a dull world this would be.

Ok. enough for me.

The import is actually failing because those three fields comprise the
primary key.  I'll look into the Perl solution that Colin suggested.

You're example of a 5000 word email with a single sentence is also 
breaking netiquette, because the responder doesn't pare down the 
original content to the relevant context.

I actually usually reply inline, but even that is more like bottom 
posting, since you reply inline beneath the paragraph you are responding 
to.

The exception to this being when one makes an openning statement, prior 
to the reply. That could be above the original content, but doesn't have 
to be.

Subject: [PLUG] postfix ezmlm forwarding
Message-ID: <20040408175840.GC9054@subtend.net>

I have a temporary situation where list mail is delivered to a postfix
server and forwarded to a qmail+ezmlm server for processing.

List traffic works fine.  I added "listname: listname at qmail.host.com" to
/etc/aliases.

My problem is sub and unsub confirmations.  The way confirmation works
with ezmlm is you just reply to a special specific email address which
starts with the list name and has the auth string in the right part of the
user address.  For example:

listname-sc.1081445909.hfdeppphaondhppklagi-krisamundson=yahoo.com at domain.com

As you can see it puts an auth code in, and the email address of the
subscriber at the end.

I'm trying to figure out how to configure postfix:

for listname-*, send to listname-*@qmail.host.com


If I can't do this with postfix I will either need to turn off
confirmation of sub/unsub's, or ramp up conversion of moving the list to
the postfix server with mailman.

OK, but why don't you trim the material AFTER your finally inserted quote?

A really bad way of doing it:

#Assuming ',' is field seperator
FS=, cat filetoamkerandallmad.csv | awk 'sub("\n"); {print "$0|$i $1$2$3\n"; $i++}' | sort -k 1 | uniq -F 1 | sort -t '|' -k 1| awk '{sub("|.*$");  print $0}'


The idea is create field with the key ($1$2$3) at the end (by a space). 
Then sort on the key field,
Then ditch the dups
Then sort on the incrementor.
Then ditch the incrementor and key field.


This assumes the field separator is ',' and is not escaped.  that there
are no spaces pipes in the fields, That the sub command effects $0
(otherwise you need to use a variable there).

I did not test any of this.  I am avoiding reading a long document.....

Well, just look how you completely destroyed the context by top
posting and mangling the quote.

Now notice how mine did not.

Thanks for playing, now go read RFC1855 again.

Well, bottom posting is equally obnoxious.  Following conventions of
the English language by interspersing responses as needed.  Better
than that website above would be http://learn.to/quote/ or
http://ursine.ca/jargon/html/email-style.html

Please don't.  It makes it harder to properly quote you later with the
correct context, since now your response is on the wrong end of the

In that case, you need to trim your quoting down to something more
acceptable.  People don't need the whole thread in the message, just
enough for people to understand what you're talking about.

Well, given that top posting is the email equivelent of driving on the

It also assumes that concatenating $1$2$3 produces a unique key,
which might be true depending on the data.  It would be better to
break each line into 4 fields, $1, $2, $3, $4(the rest of the line)
and create a key separated by some unlikely character.

Heheh, I don't know what song you're talking about, but now that you
got me thinking about it, it's amazing how far you can go without
having to transfer in Portland.  33 miles in 2 hours, faster than you
can drive it if it's a weekday, for $1.70 on the MAX Blue Line...

Not really a "legal" question, more of a "how work gets done" question.

I'm considering picking up a few contracts through rent-a-coder. Most of these, 
if not all, say that the client retains "all copyrights related to the project."
Also, the question came up on Slashdot recently about carrying around a library 
of code from job to job.

Do other people keep a library of code that they use on projects and how does 
this affect the work they do where the client wants to have "copyright of all
 code?" Or do I need to re-write mysql / php libraries each time I use them?

I guess that's it. :)
Thanks for any suggestions.

I'm guessing from your comment about "library" of code that you are talking
about being the coder, as opposed to buyer. My understanding is that, if the
buyer is retaining the copyright, you cannot keep, or reuse the code later.
If you did, you'd be infringing on the buyer's copyright.

This is just my understanding, but I think it's a safe way to assume things
are.

Subject: [PLUG] alt.religion.email
Message-ID: <20040409175034.GA29428@gate.kl-ic.com>

There is another religious argument about top posting versus bottom
posting.  It is of course going on under the title of:

"Re: [PLUG] Next steps in Bayian SpamAssassin installation"

Please move the top/bottom posting discussion elsewhere, like
plug-talk, or alt.religion.email, AND FIX THE $^%$*& SUBJECT LINE!
If you are going to be sophmoric enough to blather on about RFC1855,
please read the goddam thing, especially the other 98% that talks
about summarizing, quoting appropriately, 72 characters, changing
subject lines to match the content, long binary attachments,
avoiding flamage, etc. 

As in all writing, the golden rule is "consider the needs of your
audience".  Write your diary any way you want, write your code for
functionality and adherence to coding standards, and write for other
people so they can understand what you are writing and quickly 
determine whether they need to read more of it.  "> >> >>> >"
conveys nothing other than laziness, whether it sits above or below
your own deathless prose.  Don't pretend there is some magic algorithm
that will make a huge pile of nested quotes readable; intelligent
communication involves cognition and creativity, not slavish
adherence to favored subsets of rules.

Newbies:  the flamers do have a point,  even if they communicate
it in a petulant and arrogant way.  If you don't make your posting
readable and follow some recognizable pattern you are wasting your
reader's time and you look sloppy.  On the other hand, the usual
>name2 \  >>name1 \  >>content1 \  >content2  format that results
from lazy use of the "r" key, which some glorify with the name of
"bottom posting", is no less sloppy.  The point is to massage the
old text to make it readable in a new context and follow a time
sequence, while preserving attribution and avoiding misquoting. 
Archived mailing lists that get digested face additional constraints; 
html,  PGP keys, and binary attachments are so much space-filling
trash, for example, and don't belong on ASCII mailing lists.  But
if you think the majority of your readers would prefer deviations
from some rigid standard in a particular instance, go ahead and
deviate from the norm.  This is about readability, not rules.

Keep in mind that this mailing list is archived, so sophmoric flamage
will follow you for the rest of your life.  Imagine that job interview
30 years from now, where your interviewer has run a quick net check
on you.  She may be disturbed that you were so idiotic as to flame
then-young and now-famous John Q. Noobe on some tiny bit of pedantic
trivia.  Your future will depend somewhat on the prudence and sympathy
you show in your writing today.

And if your own future doesn't interest you, at least consider the
future of Linux.  Our best selling point is the support we offer
newbies.  Our worst selling point is our bombastic flamage of people
that do not adhere to our own rigid, neurotic, and arbitrary standards.  
To the extent that we indulge in the latter unfriendly behavior, we
limit the spread of free software.  No healthy person wants to
emulate assholes.

Subject: [PLUG] Training a bayesian filter
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0404091057360.16338@pecos.madboa.com>

Since, as Keith properly pointed out, the old thread about bayesian
filters got hijacked, I thought I'd start a new one.

On average, I get about 100 spam messages a day. It's not so much that
I couldn't handle it manually, but I like having SpamAssassin
performing sentinal duty for me.

I've got four folders for unwanted messages:

1. junk: where procmail diverts messages that under temporary
   blacklisting. Typically, these are mailing-list threads gone amok,
   but sometimes I blacklist people, too.

2. spam: where procmail diverts messages with a "X-Spam-Flag: YES"
   header.

3. spam.uncaught: where I manually put messages that slipped through
   SpamAssassin's filters. More on this folder below.

4. spam.kept: where I keep about 250 known-spam messages. This is
   useful if I have to rebuild a bayes database.

A couple times a week, I pop into the spam folder and search for all
messages with 'BAYES_99 BODY' in them. These are messages SpamAssassin
is 99 to 100% sure are spam. Since my bayesian database has done as
good a job as possible identifying these messages, there's no reason
to feed them to sa-learn; so I just delete them.

Any that are left (typically these days, no more than 3 to 5% of the
total number of filtered messages), I move to the spam.uncaught
folder. Every so often, I feed the uncaught spam to sa-learn and then
delete all the messages in spam.uncaught.

The reward comes when I see messages with spam reports like this:

  X-Spam-Report:
    *  5.4 BAYES_99 BODY: Bayesian spam probability is 99 to 100%
    *      [score: 0.9997]

This message did nothing to violate SpamAssassin's stock filters -- no
funky HTML, no forged MUA headers, no wierd return address -- but
since I'd seen and fed to sa-learn similar messages, it was correctly
identified and filtered out of my inbox.

Subject: [PLUG] Attachments not received
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0404091153210.495@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I seem to encounter more incidents when I send a client (or prospective
client) information attached to an e-mail and receive a return mail that the
attachments were not received.

  Based on a previous thread here I suspect Microsoft is protecting the poor
recipient by determining that the attachment is malware and not letting it
be seen. Ergo, my question: what can I do to prevent or reduce the number of
such incidents?

  Most of the files I send are .pdf. However, when there is a collection to
send I package them using plain, ol' .zip so the winduhs users can extract
them. I suspect that it's the zipped file that sometimes causes the problem.
Of course, I may be completely wrong in all this.

  Are there steps I can take to ensure the delivery of attachments on the
first try?

Thanks,

Rich

	Generally speaking, (Unless I just had one of the Good Brownies..)
if an attachment is not received, it's because:

	A: the receiving mail server strips it out, (unusual with .pdf and
.zip; though given the nature of the last round of Windows viruses, more and
more are stripping out .zip attachments)
-or-
	B: the recipient is using either Outlook or Outlook Express, in
which case the aforementioned email client is making the call to hide the
attachment.

If it's A, then you may need to rename the file in order for it to go
through.
If it's B, then either they need to turn off that mail hiding capacity (and
most likely exposing themselves to malware,) or (if they are using
Exchange,) see if that attachment type can be ignored.

I've run into situations here at work where AOL strips out .pdf and leaves
.exe alone..

Bass Ackwards If you ask me but whatever.. Just makes it more inconvenient
for me.

Anyhoo, anybody else got any ideas?

Hi,

Of course it was a classic case of user alienates tech support.  When she 
said reboot or power cycle the cable modem or whatever, Mr. Smarty Pants 
said"I've tried that"  and when she asked me to read the network settings I 
asked how that mattered if the modem had no connectivity to the 
Internet.  That's when she said "it's just out all over Portland" and the 
call ended.

Called back 4 hours later and let the new tech know how smart he is and how 
nice it is to have such great support and then it was "Here is a work order 
#.  We can come by at 8 tomorrow morning."

Cheers,
Mike

Chris,

  I'm sure that's the case. After all, how many winduhs users do you know
who _don't_ use the de-fault Lookout or Lookout Fast?

  Do I need to rename the files so something inocuous and tell the
recipients what to do with them? In linux pdf views and uncompressors don't
care about file names. Does this also hold true in the world of Redmond?

Thanks,

Rich

Send the link in URL form
ftp://ftp.appl-ecosys.com/pub/email/yourfile.pdf

That should be recognized by anybody as "something you click on if it's

	Well, no, Winblows uses the file extension to associate which
program should be used to open it. Now without getting into the pros and
cons of this "feature", You shouldn't have any problems renaming the file in
order to attach it. However, in order for them to view it they will have to
rename it back.. As I mentioned earlier, it's just one more thing to do..

Yes it does hold true in MS world as well.  The Exchange server will
open all files regardless of what you name them.  In fact, the last
virus was putting passwords on the zip files so virus scanners
couldn't open them.  Then in the body of the email tell you the
password to open the attachment.  Cleaver.  Well many are now not
allowing any unknown files through the email server.  They have one of
two solutions to this.

1. create a special extension that they will allow through the server.
This has been created with my company and another to allow
attachments.

2. Use FTP or another form of retrieval when sending large files or
documents.  This is the preferred way as we have set up a share web
repository and the users just click a weblink that gives them the
file.

The suggested ftp link will work on an anonymous ftp site as a good
solutions as well. I would suggest you user something like:

ftp://ftp.yourhost.com/private/companyone/file.zip

Then you can hide the private directory and not list the files yet
allow others that have the path to download the files.

  So, what's an inocuous file extension that won't cause the MUA-cop to shut
down viewing? How about no extension at all?

Yup, and it's worse.  Unless you have explicitly obtained privileges for
the past works which comprise your library, you may not even have the
rights to use those works - if they were created in a similar
contractual situation.  My past experience dredges up the phrase "work
for hire" for such contexts, meaning all rights are implicitly (if not
explicitly) owned by the person that paid for the work.  It is not
sufficient to have a verbal agreement with your old employer to take
code with you when completing a contract; you need to have these things
in writing in order for it to function as your "stay out of jail" card.

When obtaining new contracts, it becomes very important to add language
which expressly grants you rights to portions of the system that you
expect or want to take with you.  In many cases, finding a mix of
exclusive rights and shared rights will allow you to take the reusable
parts (if not all) of the systems' code with you, and most employers or
clients can probably be convinced of the mutual value for those rights.
To whatever extent possible, make everything as explicit as possible
without detracting from the abstract function the language should serve,
though that tends to also be generally useful contract writing advice.

Further, I have recently decided to take the trouble of forcing future
NDAs and contracts to be written "implicitly open," where all work
product rights will automatically be licensed under FOSS terms unless
specifically labeled proprietary.  This is something more professionals
should consider, but some clients will initially balk.  I myself love to
convince businesses that these are the right choices to make now and
into the future; it can be hard - and even pragmatically impossible in
some rare cases - but it usually produces richly rewarding results.

Finally, I am not a lawyer but pay a good one to handle these issues,
and those looking for these kinds of solutions should consult one too.
Many of us may be gifted enough to write our own contracts, but I
sincerely doubt any of us have passed the bar exam in Oregon and thus
could know for sure if our words would hold a drop of legal water.

	Basically, anything that isn't associated with a local program can
used. Yes, I know that this changes from machine to machine, if only
slightly, but no extension should work. And as before, they will either have
to use the program to open the file, or rename the file such that opening
the file will use the correct program.

Again, I'll repeat there is a setting in exchange to Scan ALL
attachments regardless of extension.  Our exchange server does just
that at my work.  We have tried to go around it and it will scan the
attachments regardless of what we named them and it remove files that
we need sent to co-workers.  It even tries to unzip all files
regardless of extension.  The file may still never make it to the
user.

Unless you have the person running the exchange server agree not to
scan your particular file type they will most likely now scan
everything.  Too many viruses not to do just that.

I'd suggest that you work out the ftp anonymous mode or ask your
client where you could upload the files.  Many have an anonymous ftp
server available.

	It would be worth finding out about what the mail server at the
destination is, as he is correct. We currently don't have an email server
in-house so my experience with Exchange equals exactly zero. ('Course,
bringing email in-house is just this side of the horizon.)

Subject: [PLUG] character encoding troubles
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0404091631250.5157-100000@uplinknetworks.dyndns.org>

I have a web-based program that uses Perl as a front-end to a SQLite db.
The original text file was in utf8 and was imported into SQLite.  When I
view things in Mozilla on Linux, everything looks great.  When I move the
SQLite file to a Windows box then certain characters in IE and Mozilla
(accented e and accented i, for example) become some other bizarre
character.  I'm guessing this has to do with the characters not being
interpreted as utf8, but as some other character set instead...

Any suggestions on how to fix this or where to begin hunting for a
solution?
Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] The kernel drm driver...
Message-ID: <1081568106.28768.14.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I've noticed for 2.4 kernels that this appears to be seperate, but I'm
not seeing an INSTALL in the source tarball.  Is this supposed to be
installed under the drivers section of the kernel tree?




Well, I have Redhat 9 up on my Dell Inspiron 5100, I'm noticing a few
problems.  Firstly the dvd/cdrw is detecting six times and I'm getting
three usb device errors regarding keyboard and mouse.

I tried 2.6.4 on my desktop box but it didn't work so well aside from
booting.  I used stock Redhat 9 compilers finding out that Redhat puts
out their own precompiled 2.6 kernel which helps with figuring out
which devel packages, seems like all of them, need to be installed.

There's a sys filesystem needed for 2.6 to work, but 2.4 doesn't need
this and I get an error when I switch back.  Anyone have any tips?
X doesn't start with 2.6, can't detect the mouse.  What in total needs
to be recompiled for 2.6 as far as stock Redhat 9?

I've been exploring 2.6 because it's a kernel for which there is an
Inspiron 5100 acpi patch.  As it stands now, I have to run XP to see
how the battery is doing and I don't have the screen turning off 
under Linux when I close the lid.  Is there an easier to work with
Linux system than Redhat 9 that supports Maple 9.02 Linux edition?
I found a page from a PSU guy that put Debian on one of these, 
Debian looks like a better choice for this laptop.  I'd like for 
example to get lineakd working so I can use all the keyboard 
functions, can't get it to compile on Redhat 9.

Subject: [PLUG] Dealing with smtp abuse from a whole entire subnet of DSL and Cable
 customers...
Message-ID: <1081621639.2394.37.camel@goose.robinson-west.com>

I have an inordinate number of improperly set up mail sources from
evidently DSL and Cable customers.  These people are probably virused.
It seems that registered sites only send .01% of the garbage I get.

I've been blocking a lot of ip addresses of the form 69.10.92.xxx
where xxx is seemingly almost every number between 1 and 254. 
These are not properly registered sites.  I'm almost tempted to 
write a program that looks up every possible address with that 
69.10.92 subnet blocking combinations that either don't resolve
or that haven't been in the maillog within the past 72 hours as
errors.  One concern is that even if these addresses are 
infected machines today, I might not want to block them
indefinitely.

Maybe it's best to use jabber to establish initial contact and
then explicitly list valid source email addresses.  I don't know
that NT/200x/XP users would like that though or even be able to 
install a chat program.

I've noticed that computers at Providence hospital aren't set
up correctly.  They are not masquerading correctly as I have 
gotten mail from an address that must be internal to
their network.  If I start blocking every address that
doesn't forward resolve, I'm looking at potentially blocking
a lot of legit sites.  I don't want my server logs flooding
with this user doesn't exist from every ip in a single subnet,
nor do I want to lose all my bandwidth to 200+ hosts 
trying to send me the same garbage.  If nothing else, 
the logging is cutting my performance.  What I guess I
should do is come up with a dynamic subnet blocking system.

My Internet speed has gone up significantly blocking over 100 
ip addresses in the 69.10.92.xxx network.  It looks like I was 
getting hit with denial of service.  All I can think is that 
it costs so much for my server to even ignore connection 
attempts where I'm getting a whole subnet, looks like a 
Class C one, hitting me. 

I'm using a dns ignorant database and trying to apply address 
tests, what I'm finding is that probably none of this addresses 
denial of service.  The best is not having an ip 
conversation with certain abusive hosts.

Subject: [PLUG] MX seconding and fetchmail
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.52.0404101738210.27682@shaft.bitmine.net>

I've got a hare-brained idea that is so crazy, it just might work!
</irony>

I may be moving my home network in a little while.  No assurance that I
can get any kind of overlap on the network connectivity, so I'm
considering a kind of stop-gap measure that could possibly be a permanent
fail-over solution for my mail.

There are some assumptions here about the way things work that I've never
used before, so please pipe up if I write something nutso.

I figure I'll set my domains' secondary MX to some machine off-net (that
is to say, not at the end of my DSL connection).  That machine will be
configured to deliver ALL mail for my domains to a single mailbox
accessible by some remote retrieval protocol.  Then, whenever my primary
MX is unavailable, the mail will be delivered to the secondary.
Periodically, my primary MX will launch a fetchmail process to grab all
the mail from the secondary MX and deliver it locally according to the
local MTA's configuration.

Does that all sound quite sane and reasonable?  The initial delivery to
the secondary MX shouldn't mess with any of the envelope information of
the messages and prevent them from being delivered to disparate mailboxes
on the primary, will it?

This seems so straightforward, I would think it's probably common practice
in some circles (unless there's a configuration within the MTA to do the
failover and re-delivery).

  If you replace "secondary MX" with "primary MX" that's exactly what we did
here for several years before getting the DSL connection. I had fetchmail
running in daemon mode and it would run over to our domain mailbox at the
ISP's mail server, carry back all waiting message and deliver them via
procmail to the appropriate inbox. Used diald to instantiate outgoing
connections as desired.

  Is anyone here using VoIP on a DSL connection? I'm wondering if it's
something I should consider for both the business and residential phone
lines. How's it work with faxes?

Thanks,

[Chaz Sliger] Read the article.  It's interesting that a program could be
spawned by playing a sound file.  Any idea how that happens?  Looks like the
Apple files/player were designed to allow this.

I usually get at least three times that, and judicious use of
SpamAssassin, ClamAV, procmail and gnus scoring, it's more than
manageable.

I'm intrigued why you bother keeping this one around when one could
easily get their fill and then some by browsing through
nntp://news.spamcop.net/spamcop.spam,
news:news.admin.net-abuse.sightings or http://www.spamarchive.org/ .

If you pipe the messages through spamassassin -r instead of dumping a
folder at sa-learn, spamassassin will also submit hashes to
razor/razor2 and pyzor if you have razor, razor2 and/or pyzor
installed.  Installing those gives spamassassin more things to check
against, making it more accurate.

Convince the admins of such broken sites to find a better solution.
And I don't just criticize, I create.

Do you get much compression out of that?  I was under the impression
that PDF is a compressed format to start with.

Probably the case.  Just send a tarball instead, WinZip easily handles
tarballs and they're not anywhere near as likely to trip things up
except with sites whose admins are suffering from severe recto-cranial
inversion.

Three off the top of my head:

1) Try sending the PDF bare.
2) Convince the site's admins to fix their broken mail server.
3) Give the recipient a login on your server.
4) Find some other method to send the file.

Yeah, what I didn't get was that they explained that this was NOT an
iTunes exploit.  So yeah, it must be designed to run programs from inside
MP3s.  Weird as hell.

There was an mpg123 exploit a while back that allowed arbitrary code
inside an MP3 to be executed, but it's been patched (and may have only
been theoretical, anyway).

So it really can't be coming to "Linux" anytime soon.  There might be some
application that is designed to run downloaded code that can be used on a
Linux system, but you'd have to be crazy to use it.

He's using zip to create archives of multiple files in one file (like tar
does) instead of using zip to make a compressed file from another file
(like gzip does).

Zip does both and there is no commonly used archive format for Windows
that does not also attempt to compress.

Also, PDFs do not necessarily contain compressed data.

Really, this is what I think he should be doing.  Email just isn't for
file transfer.  It CAN be used to do so, but you can also use a
screwdriver to bash in a nail and you can drive a car with your feet if
you want to... that don't make it a good idea.

Sending a URL is more respectful of the recipient because it allows them
to consume the additional bandwidth of the file transfer at will instead
of on command.

Well, you might consider using listings in bl.spamcop.net and

Like all ursine.ca users.  Or for that matter, all users of any site
with cheap hosting (mom-and-pop companies, hobbyist servers, etc).
Don't blame the users when the upstream hostmaster is the idiot.

It's already happened.  And we've moved on.  There were three worms,
all somewhat successful, all exclusive to Red Hat and derived
distros.  Number still in the wild today, 5 years later?  Zero.  We
already know it can be done, Unix just proves to be a seriously
hostile environment for viruses since most people still don't log in
as root and run more than they have to (you really don't have a reason
to log in as root, just su -m to run the commands you need as root
From your normal user.  Or better yet, get something like sudo and use
that.).

This only proves it's possible on OSX, not that there is actually
something in the wild getting loose.

The price of DSL for the kind of bandwidth you'll need for more than a
single line will far outweigh the price benefit of consumer-grade
VoIP.

> How's it work with faxes?

TiVo barely works and is only tolerable once you get past the initial
setup.  It took us three days without TV playing UT with roommates in
the living room waiting for the TiVo to make the Program Call so we
could finish changing the lineup from Comcast Downtown Portland
Economy Basic to Comcast Wood Village Digital Basic and watch TV again
because it couldn't hold the call long enough.  Now that the TiVo's up
and running, it's fine since it just keeps trying once every few hours
if it can't dial out.  I'm not sure faxing would be a possibility if
you didn't automate it, and if you automate it, I wouldn't gayrauntee a
delivery time.

Well, depends.  If it's like apt, and you're using only specific
sources that you trust (like the Debian mirrors), then you are OK as
long as you stay on top of security advisories and don't do anything
insane like using cron or cron-apt to do more than just update the
package cache.

Instead of using a zip to attach just one file, why not just attach
each file individually?  Yeah, it's a bandwidth hog, but some servers
trying to save on CPU overhead aren't going to waste time trying to
figure out archives but are more than happy to let anything clean through.

tar?  WinZip will do it...

I really don't see any problem in using MIME to it's full
capabilities, bandwidth/cost permitting.  Email wasn't originally a
multicast everything-mover, but times have changed.  I wish the
Windows world, and to a lesser extent Mozilla, would get with the
freaking program and support MIME in an intelligent manner.

Not necessarily.  For me, just email it to me.  I run my own mail
server, so you're basically placing it flat on my coffee table.  When
in doubt, don't be afraid to ask, "Hey, will I mailbomb you if I send
this, or will it make it?"

My reading is that it truely falls into the "trojan horse" category. My
impression is that on MacOS the icons for executables are embeded in the
file itself, and what this is doing is placing an icon normally
associated with a sound file on a trojan executable file. If my reading
is correct, there are two weaknesses, first is an exploit of where the
MacOS desktop in where it looks for icons, and the second is that the
downloading program is saving the downloaded file with the execute bit
set (otherwise it would refuse to execute it).

There have been a couple mpg123 holes found, though I doubt many people
have been hit by it (could only hit the user).

Games tend to do it, but they know their source. The real problem is that
the file was apparently being saved with the execute bits set (or some
part of the desktop was dishonoring the execute bit).

Set up proftpd read only chrooted with only an anonymous login
if you don't care about sniffing.  For that matter, if you 
encrypt the data itself and give the recipient the key 
through more secure means, who cares if the package is 
sniffed en route?  Just put the URL in your email message.

Email has become so unreliable with poor authentication and
broken sites that it's a wonder it works at all.

Watch out about giving a login, this is where most security 
breaches start.

Why would VoIP require more bandwidth than a DS0 (64kbps)?  Hell, that's
not even hardly compressed.  Surely, latency is all that matters.

Trusted sources and key-checking.  I suppose there could be a nameserver
hijacking or brilliant IP spoofing, but that requires more than a little
finagling.

  I've no idea where, or by whom, their mail server is maintained. And,

  It's not for the compression, Paul, but for packaging a set of related

  Oh. I didn't realize that Microsoft officially recognized anything not

Because your spam is not the same as my spam. I host email for some
friends' domains, and I see the spam I reject for them and the spam I
reject for me. There is almost zero intersection, if you leave out the
fact that most of it is relayed through Asia or sent via
broadband-connected zombies.

I see this as proof that keeping my own spam corpus is critical to
proper training of whatever Bayesian solution I choose to use.

Jeme is correct. VoIP connections generally consume around 55kbps after
compression. (Both up and down, of course) So with an ADSL connection of,
say, 1500/256, you could easily have 4 VoIP "lines".

As to latency: most VoIP providers offer routers supporting QoS,
preconfigured to pre-empt VoIP traffic, ensuring the lowest possible
latency.

More details, what is the chipset controlling the hard drive, what is

Uhm, this certainly doesn't dovetail with the experiences I had 
working for a VoIP firm for four years.

Different codecs have different bandwidth requirements.  G.723.1 is 
one of the lowest with around 7-8kbps.  G.729 is better quality but a 
little higher bandwidth.  About 12kpbs IIRC.  This is just for the 
codec audio stream, not other overhead!

If you sample voice at 8khz with 8-bit samples, you get standard G.711 
(which is no compression at all) and that is 64kbps.

There are a couple of more open codecs such as Speex and GSM.  Those 
are fairly good.  G.729 licensing is ugly.  $1 per port in single 
configurations and $10/port in multiple port configurations.  Yuck.  
G.723.1 is pretty bad too.

On top of the codec bandwidth, you've got packet overhead.  Generally 
you want to put two or three packets of audio into each UDP packet to 
reduce that overhead.  Too much audio data per RTP/UDP packet and 
you've got bad latency again and you'll need to bump up the jitter 
buffer.  Then you're in latency land again.  Over 200ms and the human 
ear can easily detect the latency.  Under that, and generally you 
don't notice it.   Note that using a microphone/speak ensemble 
through a sound card is a guaranteed way to introduce a _lot_ of 
latency.

I've personally run two simultaneous bidirectional calls through a 
28.8 modem without problems other than the horrible latency from the 
modem.  That was with G.723.1, 60ms frames, one frame per RTP packet.

If you are using G.711 and not doing any compression, then you'll be 
able to get one call per ISDN channel equivalent (i.e. 64kbps).  
Since there are free codecs, why would you want to run uncompressed 
audio streams?

So, let's assume that GSM plus packet overhead is about 20kpbs.  That 
leaves you with about a dozen simultaneous calls through a 256kbps 
link (you've got to count the lowest bandwidth side only).

Best,
Kyle

Actually, if, when deliverying a given message, a remote MTA isn't
present to give a permanent failure the message will be retried for
many days. I've been "in transit" for days without any lost mail at
all. Having a secondary does provide some peace of mind, though. :)

Show me a DSL line with less than a quarter second ping to the telco.

Theory aside, my brother's had a VoIP telephone line (his "native"
telno is in NY, in addition to his local presence) on Cable Modem for
some time now and it has neither quality nor latency issues of any
kind.

Subject: [PLUG] Something I don't want in my maillog...
Message-ID: <4079C87C.2050103@robinson-west.com>

I could try to block every ip off from three subnets trying to sending
to a nonexistent account at my site, it's tedious though blocking
individual ip's and I'm well over a hundred of them now.  There
has to be a way to tell postfix I don't want it to log people who
can't get past the hello stage because they want to send to certain
nonexistent accounts.  If someone wanted to understand I'm not
listening, they would by now because they are not allowed to send
me data.  With the number of addresses in the same subnet trying
to send me this, it is clearly a virus or worm that I'm fighting.

On the other hand, there are rare cases where I want to see a record of
failure to send to a nonexistent account that should exist.  Maybe someone
came by the site and wants to contact someone through it thinking there's
an account for this person.  There's also the braindead providence network,
mail from inside the hospital never comes from a globally registered
address.  I had to turn off unknown hostname in helo checks because
I can't consistently get this to override for Providence.  I figured out
a long time ago that the name of the computer in the private network
behind the Internet connection hosting the mail should have the same
name that is used on the Internet side.  I have an external and
an internal goose record.  Providence should at least masquerade
to an address that can actually be looked up.

I'm tired of the log pollution because there's the inefficiency of logging
so much and log pollution makes it harder to see meaningful errors.

I've never seen a DSL connection with regular ping times that high. I've
worked with Verizon's home DSL connections, and a Covad business connection.
Verizon averages around 70ms, and the Covad was about 30.

All the connections I've dealt with are in the Hillsboro area, averaging 6
miles from the CO.

I don't think mail servers can be configured to try the primary and
deliver locally if it can't be reached.  They either are a secondary,
queueing mail for the primary MX.  Or they deliver the mail locally.

If your local server is going to be down for a while, I would setup the 
remote site to accept the mail and use fetchmail to retrieve it.  If the 
downtime is going to be short, then setup the secondary and let it queue 
the mail.

With many mail servers, the SMTP recipient is completely lost
once the message is delivered.  This can create problems when splitting 
to multiple mailboxes.  This happens especially with mailing lists and 
similar where the receipient is not found in the headers.  Postfix and 
qmail add the Delivered-To header with the receipient.  This can be used 
by fetchmail.

Fetchmail works with the fetching remove mailbox and delivering it 
locally with multiple mailboxes.

What are the versions of the kernel, glibc, and fileutils?  I have seen 
negative or weird numbers from df when it doesn't support large sizes. 
Those negative numbers are too big to be 32-bit integer rollover.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0404111556150.15272-100000@uplinknetworks.dyndns.org>

I have a dual-boot laptop (XP/Fedora) and on the XP side I can configure
my display to use the laptop screen as well as an LCD display that's
plugged into the laptop.  Then I can move windows, etc., from one screen
to the other and they both function together as one large monitor.

Does anyone know of a way to do this in Linux?

Yes, I know, it's mandrake.  But I'm taking a Linux Install and Admin class and the proff required Redhat to be installed.  The Redhat 7.3 didn't work so well with iptables and email and everything.

So I decided to download and try Mandrake 10.0.  I have used 9.0 in the past and it was ok.

But 10.0 hurts... my head... bad.

I went through the typical server install and loaded it up.  Gnome wouldn't load, not even an option, IceWM is all that will load.

Then the hostname somehow got screwed up.  /etc/hosts looks fine, but the hostname for all intents and purposes ended up something weird like x1-6-00-20-78-0d something or other.  Mail, FTP, HTTP, anything that needs to resolve just doesn't work.

This was not worth the 4 hours and 3 CDs to burn.  Yes I know it's a new release and not to expect much, but I didn't expect it to be that broke.

Anyone else tried "Community"?  What are your thoughts?

First off, why are you trying to send to 10.0 at robinson-west.com and
Impressions at robinson-west.com?  These accounts don't exist.

Redhat 7.3 upgraded with a few things like the kernel replaced
from sources outside of Redhat works well enough.  It's starting
to look like only a confirmation system will work to shut down
spam ( especially drug ads ), but in order for that to work I need
to modify it to work with email lists like this one.  Even with
spamassassin and Mailfilter, I'm not affective enough.  Email
senders need to be identified, this is the only way I can think
of to scare off spammers.   Noone wants to be caught in the
act.

I like debian, but as I said for this class the instructor requires Redhat, so I chose Mandrake as the lesser of two evils.

I'm not.  I accidently typed the subject into the CC: field.  My head hurts.

A newer kernel wouldn't hurt, might even help.  Going to a 2.4.2? would
increase performance, especially if this is a more modern motherboard.

Was this disk partitioned on this machine, or was it partitioned on
another machine and then installed on this machine?

Still looks strange.

  Interesting result, that. The Cc: field in my copy had those same
usernames at my domain, too.

  What the heck, it's Sunday, right?

It looks like you didn't enter a hostname when you set up your networking. I 
installed 9.1 (i think,) on a friend of mine's machine, and it did the same 
thing.. kinda irritating..

> Anyone else tried "Community"?  What are your thoughts?

Well, I'll definitely be glad when 10.0 public release comes out. Nothing too 
glaring was wrong with it, (either that, or I've gotten used to it already.) 
I think the biggest thing that I don't like about 10.0 CR is that the XFree86 
version that I have doesn't support my Nvidia graphics card that 9.2 did.. 
That. I think, is it's biggest strike against it. 'Course, if you are setting 
up servers that should be the least of your worries..

Anyway, I hope that helps.

  man hostname:

HOSTNAME(1)                 Linux Programmer's Manual               HOSTNAME(1)

NAME
       hostname - show or set the system's host name
       domainname - show or set the system's NIS/YP domain name
       dnsdomainname - show the system's DNS domain name
       nisdomainname - show or set system's NIS/YP domain name
       ypdomainname - show or set the system's NIS/YP domain name
       nodename - show or set the system's DECnet node name

SYNOPSIS
       hostname  [-v]  [-a]  [--alias] [-d] [--domain] [-f] [--fqdn] [-i] [--ip-
       address] [--long] [-s] [--short] [-y] [--yp] [--nis] [-n] [--node]

       hostname [-v] [-F filename] [--file filename] [hostname]

       domainname [-v] [-F filename] [--file filename] [name]

       nodename [-v] [-F filename] [--file filename] [name]

       dnsdomainname [-v]
       nisdomainname [-v]
       ypdomainname [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       Hostname is the program that is used to either set or display the current
       host, domain or node name of the system.  These names are used by many of
       the networking programs to identify the machine. The domain name is also
       used by NIS/YP.

I'm using the webbased comcast mail.  I'm very sure I don't have a virus since I never really used this before this term.  I only used this account because my mail server is down with all these problems.

Like I said I accidently typed the subject into the CC field.  Why it went to your respective domains I have no idea.

No that's not the case.  I even tried to reinstall the OS in case I did something wrong.  /etc/hosts shows correctly, and I made sure that I did the networking correct.

What I didn't like ist hat LSB isn't compatible with the 2.6 kernal.  Not a Mandrake issue though.  I didn't know that was the case.

I'm currently downloading 9.2 and will try to use that since I have an assignment due for my Computer Science class in a few days and need gcc.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0404111910280.21681@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  My fiancee's decided that she'd like to use mozilla mail rather than
sylpheed. We thought we had mozilla properly configured, but cannot send a
Web page to me (on the same network).

  Under Edit -> Mail/Usenet I set the server name as mail.appl-ecosys.com
and the port as 25 for both incoming and outgoing mail. Is that correct? One
dialog box had port 110 as the default.

  I know less than nothing about configuring a GUI MUA (but, I'm really good
at acronyms!); I've used only pine the past seven years. Pointers to HOWTOs
or a cookbook recipe of what should be in every pertinent field would be
very helpful.

TIA,

Rich

I understand that, but after four hours, most MTAs are going to give
as-yet-undeliverable warnings to the clients... I'd like to avoid those
messages if at all possible.

Rich,

You probably want to use port 110 for incoming mail (POP3) unless you use
IMAP (143?)

Subject: [PLUG] Configuring mozilla for mail/usenet

  My fiancee's decided that she'd like to use mozilla mail rather than
sylpheed. We thought we had mozilla properly configured, but cannot send a
Web page to me (on the same network).

  Under Edit -> Mail/Usenet I set the server name as mail.appl-ecosys.com
and the port as 25 for both incoming and outgoing mail. Is that correct? One
dialog box had port 110 as the default.

  I know less than nothing about configuring a GUI MUA (but, I'm really good
at acronyms!); I've used only pine the past seven years. Pointers to HOWTOs
or a cookbook recipe of what should be in every pertinent field would be
very helpful.

TIA,

Rich

That still seems crazy high.

I guess that would explain it... at least for the Covad lines.

Mine's a Covad connection and I'm about 6800 wire-feet from the CO.

I'm looking at moving into a new place... it's about 3200 wire-feet (from
a different CO).

Maybe my ping times will drop!

In case that's unclear 66.93.38.1 is the gateway on my ISP's side of the
DSL connection.

But it works just as well with a public server address:

OK, after more testing, I have determined that it makes no difference as 
to what the permissions on the directory are.

I set them to 777, and it made no difference. I still get "Unable to 
write..." error if the file does not exist.

Weird.

Yep.  All is well now.  I upgraded to 2.4.25 and df functions as it

Do you still get the errors from hdparm?

Oh, and you might want to remove the ipchains packages and make sure
iptables is installed... they're not removed with the 2.2 kernel is
removed.  (This is Debian, right?)

I have a friend who (like most people) wasn't doing adequate backups on
his Windows system. His IBM Deathstar drive suddenly died yesterday, and 
he needs to try to recover whatever can be saved from it. I spent a good 
part of the day playing with it, but only managed to copy off one or two

have a recommendation for such a place in the Portland area, preferably

I don't know about places in the Portland area, but I had good luck
with DTI Data http://www.dtidata.com/
I sent them a laptop hard drive that died and they recovered 
all the data from it for about half the price I was quoted from 
other services.

My other recommendation is to give the drive a days rest and try
it again. Others have had good luck putting the drive in the 
freezer for a while. Just be prepared if it does come back
alive to immediately get the important data off first.

How you do this is very dependant on your video card.  (probably
wether you can also.)  In general, this is done through the xinerama
extension to X.  (Option "xinerama" in your ServerLayout section of
XF86Config[-4]).  If you have a radeon, you want to use the "big
desktop" mode w/ the "official" radeon driver.  Nvidia has a similar
trick to get multi-head, but I don't recall what it is called.  As far
as I know, the _only_ reason not to use xinerama is to get hardware
acceleration with dual head. (dri is not compatable with xinerama).

Regrettably, the radeon "big desktop" mode dosen't support the
xinerama extensions to X.  With xinerama, the window manager can tell
where one monitor ends and the next one begins, and (I think) find
"blank" zones that aren't displayed at all (for example, two monitors
running at different vertical resolutions, yet arrayed side-by-side
will have some un-displayable area infringing on the standard
rectangular desktop shape).  Without the multi-head hack from ATI (I
imagine nvidia as well..) you have annoying things like windows
popping up split accross monitors, and maximizing windows spreads
accross all monitors, rather than one (which can be nice, I admit).

You can also use dual-head without xinerama, in which case each head
is running it's own xsession (and window manager.. etc).  This is
kindof cool, since your mouse traverses heads, but you can't drag
windows accross.  It's an interesting way to do things, but never got
me going (one trick of note is that you don't have to run the same WM
on each head--how you do this is left as an excersize--I don't know
of the top of my head).

FYI, the propagation delay through a piece of wire is on the order of

Nope, no more errors.  It's interesting that with the 2.2 kernel, I could
get a huge disk speed increase by playing with the hdparm settings, such
as:

hdparm -X69 -d1 -u1 -m16 -c3 /dev/hda

But after going to 2.4, this apparently makes no difference.  The
following command gives identical results:

hdparm -Tt /dev/hda

I'm curious if lspci is more informative and if hdparm is error free.

I turned on verbose. It doesn't seem to give any additional information:

procmail: Assigning "FORMAIL=/usr/bin/formail"
procmail: Assigning "DEFAULT=/var/spool/mail/russj"
procmail: Executing "date,+%y-%m"
procmail: Assigning "MONTH=04-04"
procmail: Assigning "LASTFOLDER=~/.mailbackup/04-04"
procmail: Opening "~/.mailbackup/04-04"
procmail: Error while writing to "~/.mailbackup/04-04"
procmail: No match on "^X-Spam-Status: Yes"

As least, not for this issue.

According to the /var/log/mail/info log, procmail is changing to my UID 
(russj) to process the mail:

Apr 12 09:38:37 mckinley spamd[10884]: connection from 
localhost.localdomain [127.0.0.1] at port 48107
Apr 12 09:38:37 mckinley spamd[3878]: info: setuid to russj succeeded

All of my procmail recipes have that. According the the log file, it's 
locking them:

procmail: Locking "IN.freecycleportland.lock"
procmail: Assigning "LASTFOLDER=IN.freecycleportland"
procmail: Opening "IN.freecycleportland"
procmail: Acquiring kernel-lock
procmail: Unlocking "IN.freecycleportland.lock"

Procmail is unable to create a file. It can write to the file once I 
create it, but it's unable to create the file, even with permissions of 
777 (world readable).

Thanks for the ideas. I'm at a loss.

Wierd. Next barrage of questions:

1. Do the same symptoms exist for all users on your system, or only
   for you?

   a. If only for you, do you have any funky 'noclobber' options in
      your shell environment? Have you tried setting "VERBOSE=yes" in
      your .procmailrc file?

2. Who built your procmail? Can you provide an exact rpm, deb, or
   whatever version string?

3. What arguments does your MTA (sendmail, postfix, ...) provide
   procmail? In sendmail land, you'd see something like this in your
   sendmail.cf conf:

Mprocmail,      P=/usr/bin/procmail, F=DFMSPhnu9,
		S=EnvFromSMTP/HdrFromSMTP, R=EnvToSMTP/HdrFromSMTP,
                T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix,
                A=procmail -Y -m $h $f $u

The meeting is on the 21st, not the 22nd.  

That is what I get for having a calender with the week starting on
Monday.  I blame the French.

OK, I set up the same backup example in another users account, and it 
happens for them as well.

procmail: Error while writing to "~/.mailbackup/04-04"

(Thunder goes off in my head....)

I figured it out.

Procmail does not support ~/ as the users home directory. You have to 
use $HOME.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0404121601260.17313-100000@uplinknetworks.dyndns.org>

I have some Perl CGI scripts...  I have various modules installed that
these scripts use...  Then on the user's machine, I setup Apache, download
and install Perl, install all the necessary Perl modules, etc.

Is it possible to use something like perlcc to make an executable that
already has the required Perl modules built into it?  Then I could simply
install the executable on the user's machine, setup Apache, and run the
programs.  

Thanks,
~M

Check out PAR, http://par.perl.org.  It basically bundles the script, 
modules, and Perl interpreter in an executable.  It doesn't compile the 
Perl.

Subject: [PLUG] smtp with sender subscription...
Message-ID: <407B9576.3000608@robinson-west.com>

Rationale...


I want to reconfigure postfix 2.0.19 or set up qmail
as a frontend to it so that you have to subscribe to
my site to send me email.  Essentially, if an unknown
sender tries to email my server, a bounce should be
generated explaining that they must subscribe to send
me email.  This way, random spammers fearing
identification probably won't bother to respond and
I'll actually be able to spare my users from a lot of
upsetting unsolicited garbage that is very hard to detect
with 100% accuracy.  


The Problems...


For a sender must subscribe system to work well,
local users need to be able to manually modify
subscription lists for mailing lists and trusted private
addresses, preemptively.  For example, I would put
plug at lists.pdxlinux.org in a subscribed list for
any account I want to use it from.
  
Forcing sender subscription may be shunned
by some, but I'm fighting a losing battle trying to add
iptables rules in order to block the addresses of
abusers.  Not knowing how long an address should be
blocked and realizing as time goes on that the sheer
length of the list is becoming a problem for manual
maintenance methods, it's try another approach or
eventually shut down.  I already use spamassassin
and Mailfilter, but I'm not stopping annoying ads.  

It amazes me that there is so much attempted traffic to
sonya.h on my mailsite, yet I don't host a sonya.h
account.  Abusive senders should have figured
that out by now.  I'm tired of blocking ips to try and
get rid of useless errors from computers trying to
send to sonya.h.  

I don't want a system where every one is
blacklisted except for a short whitelist, that doesn't
address growth very well.  

SMTP authentication is out, after all, all that
anyone has to do is copy the authentication
if you're running through a clear text smtp
server or relay.  Authentication doesn't
seem friendly to adding new senders.

...

On solving problem with a sender must subscribe
approach...


I should probably have a website that people have to
go to to subscribe to my site before they can email
me, though I'm open to suggestions.  

The hold feature in postfix-2.0.19, does it work
indefinitely?  I'm wondering thinking to hold the
mail from unsubscribed senders until the sender
subscribes or a reasonable amount of time so
that I'm not holding onto junk forever.

Subscription should be a one time thing
for a sender for as long as the local
recipient(s) approve.
 
Maybe I should run qmail in parallel with postfix,
just for subscription purposes, feeding the messages
that are passing subscription check through into my  
existing Postfix/Mailfilter/Clamav/spamassassin
setup.  Maybe I'll have to alias a second private
address onto my mailserver to give qmail a home.

I've had trouble with valid senders saying helo with
unregistered addresses.  I either work out an override
feature when it comes to hostname checking, or I'll
have to give up on hostname checking entirely.  Why
isn't who you say hello as defined more rigidly?  
What are the implications for setting up a
senders must subscribe smtp server?


Summary...


Exposed to the whole Internet and attempting to
stop abusers of my mail site, I'll never succeed
with a block individual ips approach. 
Spamassassin and Mailfilter help, but they're
not stopping drug ads.  I can hold a message
perhaps until it's sender subscribes, so losing
messages should be mitigateable.  The goal is
to stop spam or at least know where it's coming
from.

I'd be imposing opt-in on senders with a subscription
requirement, a lot of computer generated stuff should
be stopped cold by this.  Especially if I make the
subscription process something that can only be done
by a human, albeit over the Net for convenience, a
subscription requirement should affectively cut down
UCE/spam.  A web site could have an agreement as
part of subscription that legally protects me and my
local users.

Yes  or no on force sender subscription?

Subject: [PLUG] Spam gets around my WHITELIST?
Message-ID: <200404130703.20876.guy1656@ados.com>

I have a whitelist in K-Mail, using partial chunks of acceptable email addys, 
(including PLUG) of course. The LAST filter rule is: if 'message' contains 
'x' OR 'message' doesn't contain 'x,' put the e-mail in the trash.

This has worked great for months. I -have- had a few bits of spam get through 
on the off chance that they include the same cluster of letters as the 
cluster I use to pick out a valid e-mail, but that has been rare enough to be 
amusing when it does happen.

However, the e-mail I attach here shouldn't be able to make it thruogh ... yet 
it did. I am including part of the header in case the attachment itself gets 
scrubbed.

Any hints on how to detect this fellow?

I find the lists on freenode to be very helpful.  There is one for 
practically every open source project.

On Freenode (irc.freenode.net) you can find #linpeople and #linux.
#linux gets pretty full, making it difficult to ask questions and get a
timely reply if any. #linpeople though seems geared toward linux support
as well, and has fewer people. One thing to keep in mind though is that
often times depending on the time of day, you may or may not get much
help. It also depends on the knowledge level of those logged in and
paying attention. Unfortunately it seems that a lot of people remain
logged in when not on their computers making it seem as though 100
people are on the channel and paying attention, though you don't get any
reply to questions. That can be really annoying especially on smaller,
more directly focused channels. 
You also may find help on any of the numerous LUG channels as well.

Good luck!

OK, we just discussed this, and determined that it's a bad idea.

Yes, we are well versed in how this works. It's still a bad idea.

Why bother? Properly configured, your existing system should stop or 
identify 95%+ of the UCE coming into your system.

Once it's identified, it's easy to manage, and you don't inconvienence 
the legitimate senders of email by forcing them to jump through hoops to 
talk to you. That's like punishing folks because they want to talk to you.

Like I said, bad idea.

> and Mailfilter, but I'm not stopping annoying ads. 

Then something isn't configured properly.

Are you using bayesian filtering in spamassassin?

Do you have DNSBL set up in postfix?

So? Do you actually have postfix configure to tell you when that 
happens? Why? Does it matter? Why not just silently /dev/null it, and 
move on?

My report for yesterday (pflogsum.pl) says that over 600 message were 
attempted to unknown users, from one site. It appears to have mostly 
happened within a 2 hour time period, and other than the report, I 
wouldn't know about it.

According to the same report, 56% of the mail that was attempted to be 
delivered yesterday was rejected. Due to unknown user, DNSBL and other 
reasons. This does NOT include the spam that spamassassin eventually 
flagged, and procmail filed for me.

Then don't. You are simply spinning in circles trying to stop something 
that you have no control over. There are much easier ways to handle 
this, and it doesn't require that you make people jump through hoops to 
talk to you.

Isn't this exactly what you are asking for?

SMTP auth is for your users, not for servers.

Based on the replies received so far it looks like PLUG itself has no IRC
server. I would be willing to run one if anybody wants.

Oh, there was a freenode channel called #orlug.  I think it just fell out
of use.

No reason to have a whole server when you can just have a channel
somewheres.

Been there, done that; the lack of interest is overwhelming.  There is a
#orlug channel on FreeNode, intended for all Oregon LUGs, however, most
of the people there are the "!PLUG" people.  I stop in occasionally, but
I'm trying to minimize my use of IRC.

My first Linux instructor Mike was so disgusted with spam that
he did go to a short whitelist, everyone else blacklisted, scheme.  
I'm just trying to adapt that for growth.

No, I'll have the ability to add people to a permanently subscribed,
or white list, ahead of tine.  This way they don't have to answer a
subscription question in the future.  I'm not looking at iptables
blocking anyone where I can't know that they're trying to send
me email.  The probability of a subscriber sending you spam
compared to some random address sending you spam is
much lower.  If I use blacklists on line where I do use dns
ignorant at least, how do I know if I should trust these or not? 
It costs to go out and use these resources too.  I use postfix
logsumm from Jim Sun, though I don't fully understand
what it tells me.  Some spam still does get through what
I'm already doing, so a maillog full of errors from rejected
senders makes it hard to find information about actual spam
sources.  I figure blacklisting means not knowing a particular
sender is trying to send me email and not holding any
attempted message from them pending verification.

There is too much temptation to send out unsolicited email
 because it doesn't cost the sender anything and many senders
are confident that the vast majority of sites won't impose any
system that can identify them.
  
Using someone else's black list is letting someone else force
registration in some form, albeit incompletely in many cases.  
A check of rfc ignorant is checking  a registry.  The spamhaus
database is a registry.  Is it better  to let someone else do
registration than it is to do it yourself on your own traffic?  
Maybe online databases get their information from people
who are sent garbage and report it, but they are still registries.

I would like to know how to log worthless errors where no mail is
delivered to a log other than the maillog so thaI can get to pertinent
information faster, like where spam that got through dns resolution
checking came from.

Is the attitude about spam where people are anti registration that
anonymity of senders and conveniencing senders is more sacred than
protecting local users?  Who has the right to be anonymous sending
email to private sites without asking first?

Spamhaus is a fascist, self-appointed tyrannical power.

Exactly what's in your mail logs that makes you go poking around in there
all the time?  I can't tell you the last time I bothered to actually read
a mail log.  It's mostly there for debugging.

If by "registration" you mean your scheme where all email addresses become
personally identifying markers, I would say the answer is a resounding
"Yes".

Everyone... just as they have the right to speak or send mail through the
post office.

And just so- everyone also has the right to only open the mail they want. 
I don't open and shred the "sell you house now" physical mail I get. Nothing
in your right to send me anonymous mail violates my right not to read it.
The same goes for email. And weblog comments- even up to a seriously aggrevating
USBank shill posting on a 11 month old comment on my weblog. I leave the shill
there but take off the "casino" guy with the advertisement.  

We all have a right to anonyminity. Anomymousness. Name-freedom. But there's a 
price that's exacted; you lose some credibility, and there's the possibility
that your message will be unheeded, trashed or even shredded.

It's still blacklisting everyone, and then whitelisting those you deem 
worthy of communication with.

The system I advocate blacklists those that have proven themselves not 
worthy. Sure, I get a few false negatives. Maybe 10 a week. The rest 
either never make it past postfixes dnsbl or get tagged by spamassassin. 
10 a week is very manageable, and I can plug those through salearn so 
spamassassin learns to block them in the future.

I haven't implemented razor, as my particular problem hasn't gotten that 
bad. But that system seems to be fairly good as well, and plugs right 
into spamassassin.

Wow. You know when your high school buddy is going to find you on the 
'net? AND what his email address is? Cool. Did you learn this technique, 
or were you born with it?

You can't know all the email addresses that will send you legitimate email.

Well, track records go a long way. Folks on this list have posted what 
they use. I'd give that a try before going to a 
blacklist/whitelist/opt-in method.

> It costs to go out and use these resources too.

It does? Then you aren't looking in the right places. I have around 10 
dnsrbls that I use, and they're all free.

Well, give us a try, or search the web. I'm sure it's not that hard to 
figure out.

The source doesn't matter when you have things properly configured.

I have done nothing to my system except make sure the binaries are up to 
date, and copy false negatives to my spamscan folder. Everything else is 
automatic.

So you just /dev/null anything from folks you don't deem worthy.

That's what I thought you meant.

Which is, for the most part, true. That doesn't mean there aren't 
effective measures to limit the amount of spam that comes into your 
email box.

I think you misunderstand. These "registries" are of known spammers, not 
of known legitimate emailers. They are doing exactly the reverse of what 
you are proposing.

In reality, no one is anonymous. Spamcop was a great way to find where a 
spam came from.

I'm not advocating conveniencing anyone. I'm advocating NOT 
inconveniencing anyone. I'm also advocating NOT letting the spammers get 
their mail through, at least, not intact. So far, a combination of 
DNSRBL and spamassassin do a nice job of this.

  Spelunking through the depths of my notebook I discovered

  But, what I also need is a HOWTO I can read to learn what I need do for
MIB setups and all the other items that I need to know, configure and
manipulate in order to wirelessly connect when I'm in the vicinity of a
public access point.

  Not having such an access point here I don't know what to set up, how to
set it up, or tell whether or not the connection would work when available.
What's the best doc for me to start reading?

Have you tried the PTP wiki?  http://wiki.personaltelco.net; it can take

Not that kind of cost.  Think about network load instead.  If I'm saying 
no the same sender
address n times that starts to cost too.

It's my private site, why I should I have to talk to people who won't 
identify
themselves to me?  If people would would desist in setting up mail sites 
that don't
require sender subscription, the spam problem would subside a great 
deal.  With
any spamlist like dns ignorant, etc., there is an attempt to mark 
certain email sources.
There's no law which states that any private entity has to receive any 
email that
anyone wants to send to it, nor should there be.  With the spamassassin and
dns lists approach solely, you have to work all the time or put up with 
spam.
Part of the wonder of conversation is choice in who the conversation is 
with,
take that away and it becomes a less useful tool.  

Requiring sender subscription closing subscription down sometimes allows 
you
to take a break.  A day may come when the environmental and sociological
impacts of relying on filtering of email through heuristical testing 
becomes a
common concern.  Missed junk can be disturbing, especiallyt if there is a
growing amount?  Do we need coal based power plants solely for our spam
filters alone?  There is a responsible expense for filtering and a point 
at which
one must question if the cost of communication is getting too high and 
another
content control method is needed.

I see you have no respect for privacy nor any respect for people who 
don't want
to actively work on severing communication wth people they don't want to 
talk
to.  Registration offers a way to block spam that makes the sender work, 
I see
a lot of good in this.  And concerning the post office, there are anti 
junk mail
laws that people actually use.  I think you're confusing right with the 
ability to
do something.  I see no supporting argument here that there is any right 
to email
me when I'm not interested.  I do have a right to email privacy though 
when it
comes to not wanting certain stuff coming in.  Spammers don't pay me
when my bandwidth gets used for their message, I owe them nothing.  I don't
have to inconvenience people I want to talk to, I can presubscribe them
myself.  If I don't know someone's email address, they merely have to
subscribe.  If someone wants to talk to me, there is a willingness to
initiate conversation that can overcome minor inconveniences for the
sake of focus.  I don't want to be distracted by junk coming through.

This was Gentoo, right?  Just hard compile all the pcmcia and wireless 
stuff into a 2.6.5 kernel.  no file touching necessary, it should just 
work.  make sure you have the wireless tools installed.  Any card you 
have shoudl just work.  just do dhcpcd eth1 and walk and talk.

That is what I have been doing for since gentoo came out.  diff kernels 
though but you get it.
I hard compile everything into the kernel.

  I use the kernels provided by Emperor Linux on this box because they're

sorry.  dern pcmcia just always worked on this lappie on slack.
didn't have time for gentoo when i first got it and slack was the only 
one that worked out of the box.

I didn't have to fsck with anything so I can't help.
I have a buffalo/melco and a Lucent silver

I see what you mean.  dont do anything and take it to a coffee shop with 
open wifi and dhcpcd it.

A MIB is a schema for an SNMP tree. I really doubt you'd need it as a
client... WEP is encryption. Failing better advice or making it to a
workshop, I'd point you towards /etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts and "man
iwconfig". The two work together. However, first try to find
distro-specific config stuff so as to make your life easier.

Unfortunately, as you may have gathered from previous threads on this
mailing list, wireless is not a particularly "solved" problem in Linux
yet. However, if you're confident your hardware should be
transparently supported by your Linux-ready laptop (vis-a-vis the
hardware being the same as your vendor would've sold you --- although
this is not always a guarantee, some vendors have been known to change
chipsets in manufacturing runs of the same model), then it may just be
a matter of filling in the right fields in the mentioned config file.

If you're still not past your implementation deadlines, feel free to
keep asking questions. :-)

Maybe.Net has been running an irc network for some years now. We
manage to keep a crowd of people talking pretty actively during the
day, and often a different crowd in the evenings. Weekends are sure
quiet. :-)

irc.maybe.net / #maybe

The channel is pretty casual, but tech support / discussion is a
pretty frequent topic and we have very competent people from hardware
and software sides.

Salem LUG also uses #salemlug with moderate frequency, I'm told.

Thats not the way DNS works. DNS looks the address up once, and then 
it's cached until the ttl runs out. Then it looks it up again. If it's 
still there, it caches it again. Very minimal cost if you ask me.

And from my experience, it works very well. I received 25 spam messages 
marked as such and appropriately filed by procmail. I received one 
(count em, one) false negative, which I moved to my spamscan folder so 
my copy of spamassassin can learn to block that one too.

An aside here. Spamassassin is also caching the virii for me, since I 
threw those in the spamscan folder too.

I would advocate a move to 2.6.5. If you're not using lvm, it should be
relatively painless. And it offers significant speed increases and a
vastly improved scheduler. Do watch out for the new modutils (it's
module-init-tools in 2.6.x).

Does it test low or high now? It's possible that your system is now
setting those hdparm tags automatically.

And so long as you're not using mga_vid.

Oh, how I wish it were in the kernel.  I can't find one that'll compile
under 2.6.

Nobody has even once suggested that you have to talk to anybody... or even
write to them.  I don't even think it was suggested that you SHOULD
(probably out of respect for the potential recipient).

OK, you understand that mail is an open protocol that just describes a
datastream connecting on a particular port, right?  You don't need a "mail
site" to send mail, you just need a TCP connection and an appropriate data
stream.  Every node on the network is a potential "mail site".

Contrary to Paul Johnson's insistence to the contrary, I don't think
there's any evidence that this is effective at all.  Your own fruitless
labors should at least hint that the approach is flawed.

I don't think anybody here is directly advocating coersion or state
tyranny.  I believe many of us are just trying to express to you the value
of remaining as open to what others have to offer as possible.

You've configured Apache, right?

We're saying you should go with:
Order allow, deny

And you're pushing for:
Order deny, allow

That's more restrictive and narrow; least open and social.  Civilization
is built on sharing ideas from one to another... and there've been quite a
few times when those who were brought to enlightenment were dragged
kicking and screaming.  You don't know what's out there if you only let in
what you already recognize and accept.

I wouldn't call it "work".  You just move aside the messages you don't
want to read.

With your "Default Deny" approach, you have to work all the time just to
maintain the bare minimum of the healthy stream of new ideas and insights
that open communication brings.

That's not "wonder" on any level at all (except maybe the wonder that you
lived this long without understanding the value of strangers' seemingly
contrary modes of existence and thought).

Yeah, we respect your RIGHT to plug your ears and shout "neener neener" to
drown out the rest of the world, but we also feel somewhat obligated to
show you how to engage that world meaningfully and grow from that
experience.

> Requiring sender subscription closing subscription down sometimes allows

Uh huh... do you always check with someone in person before you send them
email?  Or do you just send the message expecting delivery and that the
recipient will make their own intelligent decision about whether or not it
merits response, acknowledgement or even notice?

The system you propose just puts another barrier between people.  All of
human progress to this day has been pushing for the opposite.  In fact,
one perfectly acceptable definition of "regressive" is "increasing the
disparity between people" and that is surely one result of increasing the
effort-requirement in personal communication.

I hope you just wrote that in desperation without really thinking about
it.  Consider the load average of your desktop machine over 24 hours.
Consider that spam processing doesn't exactly bog down anything you or I
are able to run for mail servers.  And consider further that the
electrical power per instruction in CPUs is dropping through the floor
which, in turn increases the ready availability of ever-faster machines
for our hobbies and home servers.

> Missed junk can be disturbing, especiallyt if there is a growing amount?

Disturbing?  What are you talking about?  Is it more of your fear of sex
and drugs?

> Do we need coal based power plants solely for our spam filters alone?

Wow.  That's quite a reach you've got there.

Trust me, we'll run out of coal before spam processing is consuming even
the power of ONE coal plant each day.

The filters are all in your head.  You're the one who's annoyed, so put
the filter between your ear and the rest of the world.  Don't slap it on
other people's mouths.

How is receiving an unsolicited email an invasion of privacy?  I suppose
you could be trying to conflate receiving an electronic message with some
kind of trespass of chattels, but the lack of demonstrable damages sort of
makes the whole thing moot.

> nor any respect for people who don't want to actively work on severing

Uh... if I'm parsing all those negatives correctly, you're writing that I
have don't respect people who don't try to ignore other people.  No idea
where you got that, because I was writing just the opposite.  Openness is
a GOOD thing.

Your idea seems to hinge on the belief that you know who has something
worthwhile to say to you before they say it.  Where would you get such
foreknowledge?

> Registration offers a way to block spam that makes the sender work, I
> see a lot of good in this.

You see a lot of good in making it harder for people to communicate with
you... you see a lot of good in causing pain for those who would offer you
information for your benefit?

Stunning.

You DO realize, don't you, that this would not just impact spammers but
colleagues who read your posts on this mailing list and would like to help
you in some endeavor and wonderful people that get your email address
because they want to get to know you well, but are too timid or
embarrassed to approach you directly?  Both of those situations happen to
me on not-infrequent occassion and I can't even express how much love and
joy has come from those experiences.

This reminds me of the magic mind-reading filter you wanted that would
ditch failed delivery notices for messages to addresses that were guesses
at valid mail accounts for the purpose of spam, but would inform you when
the failed delivery was for a message that whose recipient names were
guesses because the well-meaning sender didn't have better information.
There's no electronic "intent" filter.  Spamassassin's the closest we've
got.

> I think you're confusing right with the ability to do something.

Uh, no.  Attempting to communicate MUST be protected as a right of all
people, else they will have no means to rally others' against oppressive
consolidated power.  Our respect of and desire for freedom demands respect
for the right of people to attempt to communicate with others and share
their ideas.

> I see no supporting argument here that there is any right to email me
> when I'm not interested.

It's the principle of least restriction.

You have the choice of making a small sacrifice (spending some time
handling spam) so that others can continue to enjoy the freedom of and
leisure allowed by the expected behavior of email or forcing all others to
make a small sacrifice for your benefit.

The choice seems obvious to me... and, I guess, to you.  Maybe I
misinterpreted "Christian".

> I do have a right to email privacy though when it comes to not wanting
> certain stuff coming in.

So stop the stuff from coming in.  Your system does nothing to stop the
stuff from coming in.  You have to let it in in order to bounce it back
and tell the sender that they have to jump through your little hoop for
the priviledge of your audience.

Your argument about bandwidth is, at best, a red herring and at worst
purposeful misdirection to support your fascist agenda.  From now on, I'll
just call you Michael Rumsfeldson.

> Spammers don't pay me when my bandwidth gets used for their message, I
> owe them nothing.

And you don't pay me when my bandwidth gets used for your message.  So
what?  The whole structure of the email system depends on assumed reliable
delivery and complicit dedication of resources to the medium.

> I don't have to inconvenience people I want to talk to, I can
> presubscribe them myself.

What if you don't know you want to talk to them?  What if they are a fine
person who is shy as in the example above?  What if they are on the far
side of the world, but have developed a solution to your publicly lamented
problem?

> If I don't know someone's email address, they merely have to subscribe.

And how do they know to subscribe?  And how is this not an inconvenience?
And how does this not break the expected delivery principle?

> If someone wants to talk to me, there is a willingness to initiate
> conversation that can overcome minor inconveniences for the sake of
> focus.

That willingness gets the mail typed in the first place.  You're assuming
that you have nothing to gain from anyone who isn't willing to sacrifice
to get information to you.

> I don't want to be distracted by junk coming through.

Then use good filters and get some Ritalin... because your distraction
threshold is really low.

I don't have to require identification to use subscription, I can simply 
ask people
to type in a random number.  I can also abandon this system for certain 
addresses
like plug at lists.pdxlinux.org and other people I want to be totally open 
to.  

To consider power concentrated tyrannical is to call God the enemy of 
man or
claim that there has to be more than one because one cannot be good.  I 
don't
buy this and it isn't Christian thinking at all.  Christians have the 
right to apply
weights and values to different ideas according to their faith and value 
system,
so too does everyone else.  I do not accept pluralism, frankly I fear 
tyranny of
a minority more than the tyranny of any majority.  

You don't reduce barriers between people by taking away their ability to
express their own core values and imposing what they view as chaos.

Christ didn't come in a form that lacked the appearance of an ordinary
man, maybe he wanted to be approachable.  One purpose of culture
and faith is to serve people's basic needs, respect and understand
other cultures and faiths or lose out as you create fear and anger.

If I am complicit in certain uses of the Internet that I consider immoral,
am I being a good Christian?  I'm not being a Christian at all in that case.
When talking about a sacrifice, the test should be whether or not there
is measureable benefit to the recipient including affects on their morality.
For principled people, sometimes the door needs to be closed to give
that principle a chance to be seen.  Oregon isn't Christian at all anymore,
it isn't because there is no respect for law here and there is no limit to
what is either called discriminatory or a right of people.

Oppressing people with strong beliefs does not work even if it takes
the form of radical pluralism, the act of equalizing all ideas without
rationale debate or fair consideration of that faith.

People are who they are.  Being open does not mean being someone
other than who you are.  There is a right to selectively open the door,
frankly there is a need.  One hopes the legit aren't cut off, but this is
always a problem that has never had a perfect solution and perhaps
doesn't need a perfect solution.  One can debate what problems they
are concerned with.  I consider myself open not having given up on
this community totally a long time ago.  Considering I just about
want to give up on Oregon, that's amazing.

I bought the O'Reilly book "Creating Applications with Mozilla" and of all 
the ORA books I've bought through the years this has been the biggest 
disappointment.  It has five authors and I could usually tell when the 
section/chapter changed just from the writing style which isn't a bad 
thing but several of the authors needed a stronger editor as they seemed 
to get lost in what they were trying to get across.  Describing XUL etc. 
in XUL terms.
   It could be me and my lack of experience with Java but the chapters I
was most interested in just confused and lost me.

On the plus side those chapters I did get through really charged me up.  
This could be a great application development environment and a look at 
'Komodo' will prove this.

Try the iwconfig(8) man page.

For quick and dirty, try

1. Insert the pcmcia card.

2. Run iwconfig without any arguments. Does the new device show up?
   Here things get tricky. The name of the device might be eth1, or
   wlan0, or something else entirely. If you don't have iwconfig, try
   "cat /proc/net/wireless" instead.

3. If the device doesn't show up, tail /var/log/messages to see if
   there are any "I'm frustrated" messages from your hotplug setup.

   If that isn't revealing, then you'll need to do some Googling to
   find out what kernel module supports your card. If it's, say, the
   very common orinoco_cs module, then do "modprobe orinoco_cs" and
   then repeat step 2 to see if anything has happened.

4. I don't know how Slackware does network configuration, but you'll
   almost certainly want to set up the wireless interface to use DHCP.
   Very few people hard-wire their wireless addresses.

Does any of that help?

  Response to 'iwconfig' is that neither lo nor eth0 have any wireless
extensions. Results of 'cat /proc/net/wirelsss' is a set of headers with
nothing in the rows below.

  No, nothing there.

  Here's where it gets interesting. According to one site, the 3CRWE154G72
card uses the Prism GT chipset (found on a Prism54 driver Web page). Details
provided include the type as 'cardbus', the subsystem ID and vendor device
both as 10b7:6001, the default PCI ID as 1260:3890 and the chipset as
'ISL3890'. The only driver I can find there is a patch for the 2.4.25
kernel; I run the 2.4.24 kernel.

  On another Web site, the ISL 3890 chip set is associated with the Prism
Duette chip set rather than the GT flavor. This site (from Rutgers U.) has
not been updated since last September. It has a driver identified only by
version number. The latest is 1.0.4.3.

  When I search the system for a prism2_cs module, one shows up for both the
2.4.20 and 2.4.22 kernels, but none for the 2.4.24 kernel.

  That's fine by me. I assume that -- eventually -- I'll use dhcpcd to get a
dynamic, wireless IP address as I now use dhcpcd to get a dynamic address
when I plug into the ethernet port in the hotel.

> Does any of that help?

  Well, ... I have more data on the card and a more focused sense of
confusion. :-)

Thanks, Paul!

It looks like the Prism54 stuff is what you want, though the process
of building and installing it will be nontrivial. :-)

I don't suppose you could return the 3CRWE154G72 and buy a card
supported by the kernel you're using. :-)

Yes.  The first bit I did was just as a training exercise.  The results
are now published at 

	http://www.hevanet.com/acorbin/xul/top.xul

I also did a couple of paying projects, writing GUIs for kiosks.

'Tis cool.  We were replacing GUIs written in html, and XUL is much more
powerful.  It has a bunch of widgets available and it's easy to lay out.
It's faster than html, mostly because you can change and redraw a single
component instead of refreshing the whole screen.  And it's designed to
work nicely with stylesheets and localization.

A big selling point is its cross-platform-ness.  Provided that mozilla
is installed on the machine, any XUL GUI will work anywhere.

> Cons?

It's still fairly new.  It's not as mature as other widget sets, such
as gtk or qt.

It's still fairly new.  Printed documentation is either non-existant
or hopelessly out-of-date.  I bought the O'Reilly book for the overview,
but learned most of the details from the web, from:

http://www.xulplanet.com/
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xul/
http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&group=netscape.public.dev.xul

http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&group=netscape.public.mozilla.xpcom

(This was a year or more ago.  There might be better docs now.)
	
You pretty much have to learn javascript to provide the functionality.
Theoretically, you could use a different scripting language, but so far
everything (like all of mozilla) has been done in javascript.

  This one is supposed to be. Emperor Linux sells two cards (one Lucent the
other 3Com) because they've found them to work with all the notebooks they
sell.

I have my Netgear WG511T card working with the atheros driver connecting
to the Netgear 802.11g AP. As long as I leave WEP off it connects and
gets an IP address. I've tried adding the WEP key via the wirless
configuration gui tool (supplied with Fedora Core 2) and then it won't
get an IP. Using the same key in XP does work so I know the AP is
working and the key is ok.

It's this last step that has me pulling my hair out. Pointers? We have
26 IBM ThinkPads that are about to become a new wireless Linux mobile
lab as soon as I get this figured out.

To the PLUG list, and to Personal Telco:

The questions about properly setting up Wifi on Linux keep reappearing
on the PLUG list.  This smells like opportunity!

Some of us have crippled wifi setups, others have trouble even getting
started.  I propose that we set up a one-time all-day event, perhaps in
conjunction with the Saturday linux clinic, or perhaps some other time
or place, where we can bring laptops and Wifi cards and access points and
other gear and get it all properly set up and security tested.  If should
be far enough in the future that (1) we can plan, and (2) attendees can
make purchases, do their reading, and prepare their systems based on that
plan.  Perhaps late June?  I'd like to get this done before vacation
season and OSCON.

We may also want to talk about setting up Linux laptops for general
secure road warrioring (modem/CAT5/Wifi).

Does anyone consider themselves capable enough in Linux WiFi setup to
help specify some prerequisites?  How many people are interested in
participating as teachers/helpers/pupils/blackhats?

I think you should try to install the hostap drivers
(http://hostap.epitest.fi/), they will use your kernel headers to make a
module for your specific kernel.  The documentation is pretty good and
compiling the modules is fairly straight forward.  They are also much
more flexible than the orinoco drivers.  Hostap supports almost all of
the wireless extensions and with these drivers, you can also turn your
laptop into an access point.

I also don't know how Slackware configures the network interfaces, but
for the initial testing, I recommend using a static IP address, that way
you don't have to wait around for the DHCP to time out before the
interface comes up.

You should also look into wireless sniffing tools like Wellenrieter or
Kismet, both support the prism chipset, but Wellenrieter seems to run
better with the hostap drivers.  Wavelan is the best tool I've seen for
console monitoring of the wireless signal.

Good Luck,

Derek Loree

I would be intersted in seeing this as a subject for the PLUG Advanced 
Topics in June.  (We already have speakers for April and May.)

Especially getting WPA authentication working, connecting to secured 
access points, etc.  (And maybe using 802.11a and/or 802.11g if there is 
time.)

I apologize for pressing one of Michael's (the other Michael, of course)
rant buttons.

I guess I should have expected him to take an off-hand comment and make it
the entire substance of his reply.  There are certain words, when
appearing in email, that make Mr. Robinson forget all topicality and
context.

Anyway, I take responsibility and I'll take any replies to plug-talk.

Mr. Robinson, you're welcome to reply to my post again to the main plug
list if you just snip out that one line of mine and pretend it wasn't
there, responding to the bits related to email etiquette and netcraft.

Ask Jeme.  It's not mythology.  The definition of mythology is creating 
something
without a factual basis.  Unless you have no respect for the idea that 
people believe
things.  It shouldn't have been brought up by Jeme anyways.

Does iwconfig show the key, or is it showing the WEP as off?

There is usually two things that can go wrong, the wireless network name
and the key, both should show up when iwconfig is run.

It's not mythological.  If you want mythology, see Classic Roman and Greek
mythology.  Are you really so uninformed that you think this is mythology?

Just proves my hunch that Jeme brought up something I can't talk about. 
 How nice
of him.  I plan on going ahead with a subscription system, albeit a 
minimally
invasive one, anyways.

One thing that has come up is the suggestion from a friend that I might 
have been
hacked into by an abusive husband.  If true, the danger is that he is so 
far gone that
he will attack any acquiantance of any kind, the fact I've given her 
space hoping
to avoid causing her a problem notwithstanding.  She says she had to be 
escorted
off campus last week because he decided to show up to harass her.  I'll 
bet she's
telling the truth, but she needs to change any abusive situation if 
that's what she's
really in on her own.  If he's breaking into her private apartment, that 
should
make winning custody if the Multnomah County courts work at all, easy.

There's clearly a reason to want to know who I'm talking to and get into 
my maillogs.
It's so ugly a situation that I don't even consider it wise to be seen 
with her.  It's been
hard for me to come to this, but I don't want to make her life harder 
either.

If I'm agressively hacked, by the ex or a private investigator, I am 
prepared to
sue that person to the highest extent allowed by law pending collection 
of the
necessary evidence.  It's not about being closed, it's self defense figuring
out who I'm talking to and who is coming in to my system.  It can happen
to anyone, find someone who looks like they need a friend and get attacked
by an abusive significant other.

What rant?  How many times?  Do you even believe in any religion?  How 
do you
know the difference between religion and culture verses mythology and 
ranting?
More proof I suppose that Jeme shouldn't have brought it up.  What a sad
commentary.

One question I can think of is the WEP key being entered as hex or ASCII?

It's a mythology exactly because people believe it.  And you're wrong
about the definition of mythology.

And your linewrap is still busted.

Keith,

  Excellent idea, but sooner rather than later.

  Yes! My Sony has built-in ethernet and modem; the first I know works but
I've not yet tested the latter.

  I'll help as I can.

  The other aspect of this is that all data should be collected into a set
of postgres tables and made accessible through the PLUG Web site. There
should be a table for hardware, another for wireless card, another for
distribution/version, a fourth for kernel version and the last for driver.
In addition to this resource, we can write our collective knowlege up as a
HOWTO and post it on the Web site, too. With links to finding Portland area
public access points this would be a great resource to have available before
the ORA OSCOM once again descends on us.

    I'm in the process of buying a new Linux-only laptop. 
Does anyone know how good LinuxCertified Inc. laptops are? 
I'm looking into getting one of their LC200 series, possibly 
the LC2430 model.
    Also, is Emperor Linux laptops any good?  Their prices 
are higher but then they have more brand name laptops. Is it 
better to go with a brand name even if they are more expensive?
   Any other advice on buying a Linux-only laptop would be 
appreciated.

  I'm very happy with both the Sony Vaio ("BlackPerl") model I bought from
them recently and with their support. They're a small business with a bunch
of very good people. _I_ didn't mind paying the premium to have my
distribution of choice pre-installed and tested. But, I buy accessories for
much less (e.g., additional RAM and the WiFi card).

I have not attended an advanced topics meeting yet, but I pop into the general
meeting every other month or so.

I would be able to assist with such a presentation about the WPA/dot1x stuff if it
was for the general meeting.  I am one of a few primary network people engineering
the deployment of WPA/dot1x on the PSU campus.  As we have campus wide coverage
using nocat with success, we have limited production deployment of
WPA/PEAP using new Cisco b/g AP's. 

If the presentation was on campus (general meeting), I could provide a network
operators view of live equipment vs. just a talk.

On the topic of being open verses security, that is a ongoing discussion
at multiple levels.  I don't have an agenda, you sure seem to though
correcting what others do in an "open and understanding
forum."  I tried to argue that there is a place for concern regarding
who emails me.  This is an important topic to administrators.  Jeme
unfortunately has a habit of helping things fly off topic and he
has an agenda.  It might be interesting to find out what that agenda
is, then again probably not.

The level of criticism for looking into sender verification for my
email servers is not merited.  All manner of businesses
and private individuals have varying reasons to be interested
in verification of senders or they need to verify senders.  
It's clearly not a nice world we live in, especially considering
the immaturity demonstrated and tolerated on this list alone.

I'm wondering if Postfix is what I want to use or if qmail is the
way to go for implementing sender verification, if anyone
other than the PCC instructors Ed and Mike are mature enough
to comment.

And just if anyone is wondering, I am not going over to plug-talk
to have a rant with Jeme.  I have better things to do.

I have a Dell Inspiron 5100.  I looked at LinuxCertified Inc. but 
decided not to
buy because the  price was atrocious for a machine where your supposedly
saving on not getting a Windows license.  The other problem is credentials,
who are these guys anyways?  I called them, but I wasn't impressed enough
to move away from name brands, namely Dell.  I'm not happy with my Dell
though, they could have put in a decent bios.  Expecting it to work 
really well,
I'm dissapointed.  It works if you don't mind: no battery life 
indicator, Linux
thinking there are six cd/dvd drives, shutdown being the only feature that
Linux supports between power management and acpi, and the uncanny
lockups I'm getting with xmms.  It's also heavy, 7 lbs.  An iBook might 
be a
good idea if you don't have to have a PC.

Recommendations are to put Debian on my laptop.  I'm running Redhat 9
because I don't know if Maple will work under Debian.  The few special
keys on it will be really handy if I can get lineakd to work. 
 Apparently it's
no problem under Debian, but it refuses to configure under Redhat.  The
battery life is short too, two and a half hours to three max.

The whole cost of the Inspiron 5100 though is only $1049 with the $50
screen upgrade you probably don't want to go without in general.  
Evidently for the 2.4.6 and 2.6.4 kernels there are bios patches for this
machine, but I haven't been able to get either kernel configured to  know
if the patches work.  For the cost of XP Pro on the Inspiron 5100 and
the extra good LCD screen, you're still cheaper than a Linux Certified
box without Windows.  

Buying used is risky, but you can get Thinkpads from various
places.  I think you'll find that the price is wrong though.
Surprisingly when I called IBM, the woman was extremely
rude about running any non Windows OS or getting one
without an OS preinstalled.  I'd like to see an open design
hardware laptop to run Linux on, but it appears impossible
to establish the necessary economy of scale where a lot of
people struggle with having to run this or that on a Microsoft
supported Windows PC.  Our education systems are not
generally friendly to Windows PC alternatives.

At least Dell doesn't rip your head off when you tell me you
want to run Linux.  The Inspiron is supposed to be as close to
a normal P4 in a laptop form factor as possible, so why in the
heck is the bios messed up?  Well, just type Inspiron 5100
Linux in google.  I'm typing on it now so it works, though
the cursor likes to bounce occasionally.

Hi,

My last three laptops have been Toshiba Satellites in the $1000 range and 
they have been pretty good for me.  They have huge market share for that 
kind of product, a primary indicator for me.  There isn't official Toshiba 
Linux support but some of their engineers have posted a few items. I'm not 
a demanding GUI user so that's an unknown and they still use winmodems but 
for overall utility and value I'm pleased.

Cheers,
Mike

We are extremely interested in working with you on this. Due to very
busy schedules I just wanted to drop a line confirming this. Hopefully
over the next few days and weeks we can organize an event.

I could probably help at a Saturday Clinic or possibly sooner.  I 
recently migrated my laptop to a 2.6 kernel and didn't have to mess with 
anything past installing iwconfig to get my WIFI working.  I am using 
WEP and a Linksys access point.

One thing I'm curious about: Has anyone tried a recent version of 
Knoppix?  I've got an older version, the one handed out by *cough*PDXLUG 
last year at ORCON.  Just tested it out and my wireless card works!
Kernel 2.4.20, iwconfig's version 25.
Sony Vaio with an Orinoco Classic Gold card.

Based on this adhoc test, I suggest getting the latest Knoppix and 
checking it out vs your setups.

Did you check "Linux on Laptops",  www.linux-laptop.net

Also, I hear IBM's work pretty good for Linux.  I'm using a Compaq 
Presario 1700 and it works great.

I'm still wondering why IBM doesn't support GNU/Linux on Laptops since 
there stance on the Linux thing.  You would think they would offer 
GNU/Linux installs as an alternative to Windows.

As for the battery indicator, I believe you need to make sure the BIOS 
on the laptop is ACPI compliant and the Kernel needs to be built with 
ACPI support in order to get that to work.  I believe most linux distros 
ship with a default kernel that does not have the ACPI compiled.  Maybe 
someone else here has some more info about this.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0404141856160.16925-100000@gisnet.com>

Am I opening up a security hole by disabling the 
  log_type = SYSLOG authpriv
line in RH 7.3's xinetd.conf file?

I had a problem with a WinXP machine in my shop taking a very long time to
initiate an FTP connection to my RH 7.3 Linux server, and using the
thousand monkeys/thousand keyboards approach I solved it by putting a '#'
character in front of the line in xinetd.conf mentioned above. I have no
idea why this works because I have no idea what XP's problem was in the
first place.

Ignoarance is bliss, but now I'm wondering if I've opened a path into the 
dungeon dimensions on my FTP server.

Can anyone here tell me 1.) if I've done a stupid thing, and 2.) why was 
it taking so long for XP to connect to my FTP server (my old Win98 
machine had no such trouble.)?

TIA,
- Bill Thoen

I've got a Sony Vaio (Older model from 2000).  With the 2.6 kernel it 
disabled my ACPI as too old of a BIOS. APM worked fine though for 
battery indicator.  Newer laptops should be fine in that respect.

I'll second the recommendation for checking linux-laptop.

    allow from 192.168.2.*

Unfortunately everyone still gets denied access. I'm under the impression if I
remove the "deny from all" statement, then anyone will get access. I would like
to  give access to only my local subnet.

thanks,
Dan Herrington

That should be 
order allow,deny
if you want deny to be the default. See
http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_access.html#order

Didn't work. I still recieve a 403 error when attempting to access the page. I
guess I should point out this webconfig embedded with clarkconnect. ALthough the
conf file and everything appears to be an implementation of apache, though I
couldn't find any configuration reference on CC's website. Also, itr doesn't
seem to be the same webconfig included with KDE.

Recently, my boss has reported that he can no longer (for how long,

2.2.7a, just upgraded to 3.0.2a, same thing.  He can print, but under
Settings/Printers sees the big "Access denied, mumble-mumble" field

I don't have a windows box anywhere near to know exactly which field
you're talking about, but I have a hunch it's the "browseable"
directive. Try setting it to yes.

So perhaps you would like that to read "order Deny,Allow" or, for
readability, "Order Deny,Allow".

>     deny from all

This isn't shell expansion or regex, so your * means nothing.  The syntax
is flexible, but they didn't bother to put in support for every imaginable
scheme of shorthand.

A full or partial domain name
An IP address
A partial IP address
A network/mask pair
A network/bit CIDR spec

So you want one of the following three:
Allow from 192.168.2
Allow from 192.168.2.0/255.255.255.0
Allow from 192.168.2.0/24

(I ignored the obvious and impractical explicit lists of each subset.)

Clear as vodka, sir.  Fix that and see.

This is pretty pointless.  If you're going to use a netmask that ends with
zeros, you may as well just truncate the address.

Even if you don't like this admittedly nonstandard way of indicating a
subnet, you could at least use the CIDR notation that's going to be much
shorter and easier to read.

You're misreading that, Bill.

Allow,Deny with his Deny and Allow directives will result in everyone but
that subnet getting access.

Deny is the default if you don't have a Deny directive with that order.
That just means "Deny for all" is implied and doesn't need explicit
statement.

>From the site you cite:
  In the following example, all hosts in the apache.org domain are allowed
  access; all other hosts are denied access.

    Order Deny,Allow
    Deny from all
    Allow from apache.org

This is exactly what he wants and it uses the order he's indicated.

Did you /etc/init.d/apache stop && sleep 5 && /etc/init.d/apache
start (or your distro's equivilent)?  Apache seems to be one of those
daemons that has no method to make all changes happen by simply
re-reading the configs in a lot of cases.

Does it use apache configs or something, or are we all way off in the
wrong direction in assuming that?

I don't see how that would explain it working for me but not for him.
Seems like a permissions problem somewhere... but where?

... and sorry for the lame-o problem report, I was reconstructing it
from memory.  I believe the field is the "status" field, after the
printer name and number of documents, and I think the "mumble, mumble"
was "unable to connect to printer".  But strangely, he _was_ able to
_print_ to the printer.

Yes, I agree, that works . But from my reading this

   Order Allow, Deny
   Allow from apache.org

also works. Am I wrong here?

Subject: [PLUG] Getting thru a Sonicwall/McAfee VirusScan system to the internet.
Message-ID: <407ECBAE.2070003@comcast.net>

All:

TA DA: 

Last nite about 10 pm I finally got a real live working linux install 
going.It was the Fedora core1 distro and after I tweaked the partitions 
a little it went onto my (new to me) IBM T21 laptop with no hassle other 
than the usual issues with recognizing the sound card.  I carefully read 
several articles about how to fix that but they were written in greek or 
urdu so I'll take them with me to the next newbie clinic and work on it 
there.  But I digress.

Having failed miserably to get Linux installed on my old IBM Aptiva, and 
my Toshiba 2545XCDT, I was wild with excitement.  I set up my email 
accounts in the Ximian Evolution email program and could only get mail 
from our MS Exchange server located on our network.  I launched Mozilla 
to check out the browsing and got the message:

"*SonicWALL Network Anti-Virus Software Required.*"

The antivirus software is McAfee and is automatically installed and updated by the sonicwall appliance.  No A/V, no internet.  I followed the click thru to the install link and discovered messages warning that MS IE 4.01 SP2 or better must be resident on my system.  There was also a plug in for Netscape users but I suspect its for the Windows version.

Have any of you encountered and conquored this issue?  Changing the server and anti-virus software for the entire office is probably not an available option.

Thanks, 

Mike Layne

Oh I'm sorry.  I used to work for McAfee (years ago), though this looks to
be a third party appliance.  In theory there should be a configuration
that should allow your Linux machine(s) to communicate through the
Sonicwall.  I did a cursory look at sonicwall.com, I'd suggest the same. 
Good Luck.

Subject: [PLUG] Quick Apache Re-write Rule
Message-ID: <1082052744.8235.211.camel@localhost>

All,

Would anyone provide me with a quick "re-write rule" for the following:

                                           
___________                                  ____________
www.virtualdomain.com  ----> | main server |  ----> rewrite rule   --->
| inside server |  
                                          
---------------------                                 
---------------------

So if a request comes in for www.serverb.com it is forwarded by
www.servera.com (via vhosts.conf) to www.serverb.com.

I read it the same way Bill. The only difference is by default everyone will be
denied access in the example you cited. That's why they don't need the "Deny
from All" directive in the example on apache's website. In my setup I have "Deny
from All" which would then deny access to everyone, counteracting the default
access which is to allow everyone.

I've tried it both ways:
<Directory /var/webconfig/htdocs/reports/data>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    Order Allow,Deny
#    deny from all
    Allow From 192.168.2
</Directory>

and,

<Directory /var/webconfig/htdocs/reports/data>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    Order Deny,Allow
    deny from all
    Allow From 192.168.2
</Directory>

Both return a 403 when attempting to access a page that needs to read from the
reports/data directory. The only time it works is if I use Deny,Allow and
comment out the "Deny from All", which just means access is open to everyone
now. Since its the system stats and intrusion data reports on the gateway
server, that is probably bad security form.

Since its not taking either example above, there is something else that is
interfering with the directive. The directive is simple enough, which makes me
think I'm being stupid and missing something. I'm logged in as root into
webconfig, and it should be using that authentication when looking at the
directories. If it's using the server's process id, the server is allowed to
read or write to the directory as well.

Of course I can't be sure since ClarkConnect doesn't come out and state it, but
the webconfig server itself has got to be apache. The directives in the conf
file follow the apache conf file exactly. Although its possible they modified
the code, but it wouldn't make sense to me to ignore taking a specific ip
address/mask pair.

Well, since it works if you allow everyone access, then the file
permissions must be right, everything must be right. There are no
hidden .htaccess files.  Have you taken a look at the log
files. Perhaps you are coming in on a different subnet than
you think? Are you trying to access it locally and you need to
add 127.0.0.1 to the Allow From line?

Does anyone have recommendations for a way to access a file server through
a web browser (using https)?  I've looked at the phpGroupWare Filemanager
module and it looks like a possibility, but I wanted to see what others
have had good experience with.
Thanks,

I think Gollem (part of the Horde project) lets you do this:

Unfortunately, In some cases the users will only have Internet Explorer

If read-only access is good enough, then WebDAV with Apache will do
the trick.

Users need to be able to download files, make changes, and then upload
them back later.

Webmin has a File Manager module. It might be worth looking at.

No, you're not wrong.  That does also work.  However, my reading makes me
believe that
  Order Allow, Deny
  Allow from apache.org
  Deny from all

results in total denial from all.  That means that if he'd used
  Order Allow,Deny
he'd have ended up denying all as the Allow would have been overridden.

Perhaps there's more to this and we're missing the crucial bit.

Also, if you can tell us exactly what version of Apache you're using and
whether this is a global config or part of an .htaccess.

I'm also assuming that /var/webconfig/htdocs/ is set as the servers
DocumentRoot.  If that's not the case, we need to know exactly how the
directory is being referenced in the http document space.

HA!  As soon as I read Bill's note (two seconds before reading this
responce and, hence, about six seconds ago), I went "Oh GOD!  Of COURSE
that's it!"

I wouldn't ever run a browser on a server host, so it wouldn't have
occurred to me.

This is too funny.

They are looking to fill a contract position for a Linux Admin at
Microsoft...  No really....

You are very welcome to do this at PLUG's Linux Clinic. While Clinics are
usually only half-day events (1-5pm), we might be able to extend that. I
would need to talk to the kind folks at Riverdale before committing it.

May or June would work fine for us. Just remember that there is no Clinic
this Month (April 2004).

I wrote a Sys-V style init script to do this. It assumes that the USB drive
is already known by devlabel. If devlabel has created the symlink for the
USB drive then the script mounts it under /home (for a the user specified
in the config file). If devlabel didn't create the symlink then the script
assumes the drive is not plugged in and you get your regular /home.

Attached is the script (usbhome) and a sample config file (usbhome.conf).
It's been tested with fedora. It should work as-is with any redhat-ish distro,
and could be modified to work with pretty much anything else.

My Pine was configured when I bought this computer to automatically execute bash

Well, as long as I don't get an email that says "sudo rm -rf /usr/bin" I should

  Why don't they get someone from SCO? I'm sure there are a few left-over
copies of their linux distribution there.

Now if you could just modify your script so it can handle the AES
encryption and read the knoppix.img for my home directory, you'd be my new

Are you kidding me?  You've got an enormous opportunity to grow your

Does being your new best friend come with beer?

The knoppix.img part shouldn't be too hard to handle. There would just need
to be some extra logic in the script (maybe triggered by extra info in the
config file) to mount knoppix.img as a loopback device.

Auto-detection of knoppix.img is not out of the question either. It could
first mount the USB device at the specified /home location. If there's no
knoppix.img file then it's done. If there is a knoppix.img file, remount the
USB device to some temp directory, and then mount knoppix.img under /home.
It would have to be careful to unmount things in the right order when
stopping the service.

As for AES, I just got a catalog in the mail from them today (Amateur
Electronic Supply). And that's how much I know about AES in Linux.

WebDAV can also make modifications, but it's a little bit difficult to
set up. Once you have a user using WebDAV, you're recommended to not use
anything else to access the files. But if this is OK and you get it set
up right, it is easy to access from Windows: Use the native "Web
Folders" functionality.

Run WebDAV over https to make it secure.

If changing that to yes doesn't fix it, you've stumped me. But I'm no

Works for me all the time (except when the binary has changed and I want

I have a spare (for a while) Cisco Aironet 340 I can plug in. Just

Subject: [PLUG] Debian lost NIC
Message-ID: <49996.209.210.31.11.1082087917.squirrel@webmail.woo-hoo.com>

So after reading the recent thread about Debian, I installed Sarge netinst
beta 3 onto my spare hard drive and without too much trouble (compared to
Gentoo ;) was able to get it installed and working, X even.

1)  Today I rebooted for no important reason and now the system doesn't
seem to recognize the NIC any longer.  It worked fine for a week or more
before the reboot.  Doing /sbin/ifconfig shows only the loopback
interface.  Am stumped.  What can I do to fix it?

2)  Sound worke the first time I logged on as root several days ago.
Immediately thereafter I logged in as a regular user and got a message
about sound being unable to load (I suppose the error message would be
useful?  where can I find it, after clicking "ok"?).  I figured not being
root had something to do with it.  Any advice on how to fix sound?

3)  KDE is the default (window manager?) environment.  I believe that
gnome is also installed.  Can I easily switch between the two?  How does
one do so when launching startx from the CLI?

4)  I really like apt-get.  Was able to install x-chat and Shockwave flash
pretty easy.  What's the best way to determine the name of the package if
you don't know the full name already?  Someone suggested "apt-cache search
blah"- is that the best way to search?

5)  In my /etc/apt/sources.list, I have a "updates main" and "testing
main".  Are there any more useful source lists to consider?

Thanks!

I'll rephrase your problem to make sure I'm understanding it correctly.

You have servera.com on the internet. serverb.com resolves to the same
IP address as servera.com. You want content on therealserverb.com to be
served when going to serverb.com.

That is easy. Load mod_proxy and put this on servera.com:

<VirtualHost *>
   ServerName serverb.com

   ProxyPass / http://therealserverb.com/
</VirtualHost>

You might run into some trouble with self-referencing urls. To fix that,
add a line to /etc/hosts on servera.com that makes serverb.com resolve
to the same address as therealserverb.com.

I hope I'm making sense.

Try ifconfig eth0 to see if the hardware is recognized. If you don't see
an error message, try ifup eth0 or /etc/init.d/networking start to get a
dhcp address on the interface.

I assume you're using alsa. Log in as root, type alsamixer to adjust the
volumes, type aplay somewavfile.wav to test that you can actually play.
Then check the permissions on /dev/dsp so you can play sounds as a user.

Yes. It even supports regexes.

All I have in my testing box's sources.list is this:

WebDAV (known as Internet Folders in Redmond) can have write access in
exactly that manner.  Use Apache-ssl to encrypt and Apache Access
control to allow only the users you specify.

Good Luck,

"eth0: error fetching interface information: Device not found"

Yeah.

But it should be easy.

Run modconf and go down to drivers/net and see if you can't find your NIC
on the list there.  If you don't know which module to use, ask or hit
google.

That should really be that.

You'll want to make sure that the eth0 section in /etc/network/interfaces
is correct.  It has nothing to do with hardware, of course, but it will
tell you if the interface will be configured correctly when it does,
eventually, come up.

First look through /var/log/syslog to see if the kernel tried to do
anything with it.  If it did, there should be some clues as to why it
isn't working.  If not, you probably need to load the module for the
card, (lspci should give some clues if you don't know which module to
load) then run ifup eth0 to get it running.  To have the system load it
on the next reboot, just add the module to /etc/modules.

Edit ~/.xsession to start the window manager, or desktop environment of
your choice.

I don't use it to install packages, but gnome-apt has a pretty good
search function, it searches the package descriptions too (like most
debian packages, it will run under any window manager, not just inside
Gnome).

"testing main non-free contrib" will open up a whole new world.

The permissions on the sound devices likely need modifying.  On desktop
machines, I just go ahead and make them globally rw.

The other option is to put any users that will need sound in the audio
group.

Huh... I guess that's why I've always used a display manager.

Yep.

I just run unstable and stable.  I don't really think of testing as
anything a person would actually want to run.  It's more of a staging area
for creating the new stable.  Unstable gets the security fixes faster than
stable does.

Oh, and if you use unstable, you can use some of the FANTASTIC multimedia
and other non-Debian apt-sources:

I'm doing just this for myself, so I just figured out a mod_rewrite
setup that will make that easy for an unlimited number of users:

    <Location /webdav>
        DAV on

        AuthType Basic
        AuthName "secure area"
        AuthUserFile /var/www/dav-users
        Require valid-user

        Options -Indexes

        ForceType text/plain
    </Location>
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteRule /webdav/(.*) /home/%{LA-U:REMOTE_USER}/public_html/$1

You can even use mod_auth_pam to authenticate through the normal UNIX
files or whatever auth mechanism PAM supports (rather than an htpasswd
file, as show above). If you use shadow files, the webserver will need
to read /etc/shadow. 

Hope this is useful to someone.

Maybe lprm is trying to remove jobs for the wrong user.
If you are using LPRng, there is a -Uuser option for lprm
that can correct this.
This is discussed in part 6 of
http://www.lprng.com/LPRng-Reference-Multipart/smb.htm
Also you might try adding a -a to the lprm command so
that it removes files for all users for which it has 
permission. That said, I can't get the similar thing
to work for cups either. I can print fine but not
purge the print jobs.

Message-ID: <1082131602.12332.42.camel@dizzy.blain.org>

I have setup a Zope/Plone site in which I use ProxyPass to redirect port
80 to Zope's port. Everything is working fine, except my webmail
program. 

How do I now redirect example.com/mail to apache proper now that
everything is being proxied? I tried to add another ProxyPass statement
to redirect /mail to it's proper place, but either this is not the way
to do it, or my syntax is wrong. 

<VirtualHost *>
    ServerName example.com
    ServerAlias www.example.com
    ServerAdmin webmaster at example.com
    ProxyPass /
http://localhost:9673/VirtualHostBase/http/example.com:80/example/VirtualHostRoot/
    ProxyPassReverse /
http://localhost:9673/VirtualHostBase/http/example.com:80/example/VirtualHostRoot/
</VirtualHost>

If I add...

ProxyPass /mail http://localhost:80/mail
ProxyPassReverse /mail http://localhost:80/mail

...in there, nothing happens, it just sits there.

I am running dynamic DNS for my domain. Would making another VirtualHost
for mail.example.com work?

Thanks,

Jeff

I can't speak for IIS's implementation of WebDAV, but on Apache, all
file ops are carried out under httpd's uid and gid. Apache manages all
authentication and authorization; the underlying filesystem doesn't
know a thing.

So afaik a WebDAV filesystem needs to have one and only one entry
point: Apache. You can't mix and match regular filesystem access with
WebDAV.

You'll need to use mod_rewrite for this kind of this.  It's tons more
flexible than just the Proxy* stuff (it can also do the proxying).

True. But what fun would it be? Bashing Micro$oft is probably seriously frowned upon. It would be difficult to work in an environment like that.

Rich is right, Riverdale currently has no access point. However, if I read
Paul's email correctly they should have one soon. :) That doesn't mean
that we won't need your Cisco. Could you coordinate with Keith Lofstrom on
this?

I suggested a Linux Wifi clinic.  The response has been great.

Them's beautiful words, Dan!  Let's shoot for Saturday May 15, starting
as early as Riverdale will permit (Or 9am, let's keep this sane ...).
Does Riverdale already have wifi?  We may need to temporarily turn it
off to test the association of other access points;  maybe not, I will
defer to the able folk at Portland Personal Telco for their approach to
that.  Something to find out about.

I will come back from Linuxfest Sunday evening, brimming with ideas,
mostly about how we can make this manageable and on-task.   Normally,
I would allow another month to prepare, but so many folks have stepped
up with offers of help that it looks like we can pull this thing off
in less than a month.

I think the first thing to think about is the range of wifi solutions
we want to try to support for that first saturday, or encourage people
to explore.  B only? or G too?  Just laptops and WAPs, or PCI card
solutions, too?  Antenna fiddles, setting up gaming networks, and
setting up full Personaltelco sites, may be too ambitious for the
first Linux Wifi Clinic.  So is setting up Windoze servers (though
Windoze clients might be OK).

The trick will be keeping this practical and success-oriented, though with
good teachers we can take on a lot of the harder stuff.  The main thing
is to make sure we can put in the effort necessary to debug some nasty
problems on some snakepit machines, rather than focus on taking the
A class setups into the stratosphere.  The Personal Telco folks are really
good at the A class stuff, but that can be accomplished at other times.
I want to focus on helping newbies, cleaning up snakepit machines, and
on road-warrior security and ease-of-use.

Pupils:  
Show up early.  Your machines may be snakepits and take a long time to
set right.  If we do manage to teach you to set up your machines right,
plan on taking time after to help others.  In medical school, the rule
is "learn one, do one, teach one" and that should apply here.

Hardware:
I am fond of separate ethernet-connected WAPs (the Linksys BEFW11S4's
are cheap and damned easy to set up, and can be mounted where the
radio needs to be, not on the back of a metal case) but a Soekris
solution would be fun to learn about, too!  PCMCIA card-wise,
we should steer clear of the cheap Fry's card du jour, and go for
PRISM chipsets (and teach people how to tell the difference).  Before
he left town, Lonnie Wormley of Invictus Networks set me up with an
excellent Senao 2511CD 200mW card with external antenna for $100;
folks that do not already have PCMCIA cards should consider that one. 
I understand there are alpha drivers for Atheros and some other
chipsets, but some wifi cards are very difficult to support under
Linux.  Closed-source drivers are available for the built-in CISCO
laptop wifi solution.  Seattle Wireless has a good list of cards,
IIRC.   Bottom line:  we might be able to help with the marginal stuff,
but if you have cheap driverless oddball gear, plan on replacing it 
before May 15.  

Software:
I would like pupils to show up prepared (some reading done, OS already
installed on backed-up machines, CD drives available, all the hardware
researched and purchased), the helpers and teachers set up with
downloaded software on CDs, and the blackhats ready with penetration
tools.  We will not have time for WEP exploits (that usually takes
hours of packets) but there will still be plenty of other network
and firewall vulnerabilities to test for.  I would like to support the
common distros, so it would help to have folks who understand networking
for Debian/Knoppix, Redhat/Fedora, SUSE, and other distros.

Drivers:
I tried the PRISM wlan drivers for a few months, but switched to the
host-ap drivers.  The setup that comes with Knoppix is very good, too.
If someone else steps up ready to support Atheros or other chipsets,
volunteer, and we can support those, too.

Vendors:  It would be nice if everyone came with the correct hardware,
but some newbie will inevitably show up with a Fry's nine dollar special
5mW PCMCIA card based on some obscure Bulgarian chipset;  a few low-end
and high-end PRISM cards might find willing buyers.  Newbies:  bring
your checkbook.

PLUGgers:  Look over the Portland Personal Telco website 
( http://www.personaltelco.net ) for lots of great ideas.  These are
an amazing group of people, and worth joining and helping.  After we
do a linux WIFI clinic, it would be nice to help them with a LINUX wifi
clinic, so they can escape Windoze and the Blue Screen of Hell.

Again, more exploration after Linuxfest.

I love Linux!!  I recompiled my kernel after patching with loop-AES:
http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net

Next, I patched linux-utils with loop-AES and rebuilt "losetup" to support
256-bit AES.

Now I can mount my Knoppix home directory:

mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/usb 
losetup -e aes256 /dev/loop0 /mnt/usb/knoppix.img
mount /dev/loop0 /home/myhomedirhere

I then modified /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit (Fedora) to do this during boot.

Theo,

  I'm far from an expert, but I doubt prayers or spells are required. The OS
is on the hard drive. Replace the system board/CPU/RAM and off you go.

Being stuck with dealing with a bunch of Windows systems I'm trying to 
convert some Apache logs from Combined format to W3C Exteneded (M$ IIS).  
I started on this project a couple of weeks ago (getting the current 
logging in W3C Extended format, rotated daily, to a Windows share) and 
at the time I found reference to a conversion program.  Now I'm back 
looking for it again and can't find the !@#$%^ thing.  Searches of 
www.apache.org and using Google.com are yielding nada!

Anyone have some pointers?

One of the nice things about Linux's modularity *is* the general ability
to just drop in replacement hardware, even if it isn't necessarily
horribly similar to the hardware being replaced.  You should be able to
drop in a new motherboard, processor, and whatever else is dead, fire it
up, and be good to go.  You may need to adjust configuration files and
the like for the hardware, depending on how much (and how) hardware
detection the fancy hat OS does.

Plug in the new hardware, hit the power button, watch the fun messages
that go scrolling by your screen.  Fix what is broke.  :-)

Plug 'er in.  Make sure the motherboard, RAM, and CPU are all
compatible.  Most boards today use DDR.  Drives and case should be good
to go.  If it's an old board you're replacing, with an AGP video card,
you may need a new video card, too (if it doesn't fit, do NOT force
it).  PCI cards should be good to go.  Make sure your PSU is capable of
powering the new board/CPU properly (a 200W PSU may have been fine for
an old Athlon 550, but won't power an Athlon XP 2400+ very nicely).

The only issue I see is hardware related:

CPU:  Athlons sometime require "noathlon" in the kernel parameters. 
This can also effect some drivers, alsa being one of them.

Video:  Something should work.

Once you get a login, merely running redhat-config-* should be enough to
fix the hardware differences.

Actually most of the important ones will be caught by kudzu at boot time.

The only difficulty is if he changes video cards and has the default run 
level set to 5.  (i.e. booting into X.)  To fix that you have to boot in 
single user mode and change the runlevel to something sane, like 3. (DON'T 
set it to 6.  Double-plus ungood.) I don't believe kudzu fixes a change in 
videocards correctly in X.

Subject: [PLUG] Compiling kernel for Dell Inspiron 5100 laptop...
Message-ID: <40804819.2060604@robinson-west.com>

patched to 2.4.26 from 2.4.25.  When I try to apply an acpi patch for 
the Dell
Inspiron 5100 bios, I get an error about a reverse or previously applied 
patch.  
Any guesses?

I have a diskio patch for 2.4.25 so that gkrellm will work, do I need to 
apply
that before patching to 2.4.26?

The other things I'm getting are char-major-4 errors and a bunch of usb 
errors
from my last compile of 2.4.25.

I compiled acpi events in, couldn't get that to work modularly though.
Oddly, when I plug in to the charger cat /proc/acpi/battery/BATO/state 
always
says that the battery is full.  Is there a nice battery life indicator 
for gnome's
panel?

The other thing is that I'm having the cdrom/dvd detecting six times, must
be the broken bios.  The CD/DVD doesn't lock properly when it's mounted
either.

I want to get the lid event connected so that the screen will turn
off when I close it.  Haven't gotten lineakd to compile under
Redhat 9 either so sound and a few other keys aren't
accessible, but brightness oddly enough works.

Just out of curiosity, how does patch know a patch has been applied to a
kernel source tree anyways?  Is there an easy way to find out which patches
have been applied?

What's a kpbs?

I'm sure it isn't Kilobits per second, as 12k really isn't very much
bandwidth, in the grand scheme of things.  Guess I could host a lot of
those on my 512/256 slow-ass DSL.

It is kilobits per second.  A typical voice channel would be 8 bit u-law
or a-law samples at 8 kHz.  That gives 64 kbps.  With 8 to 1 compression
that puts it in the realm of Kyle's numbers.  If you could tolerate LPC
compression, you could get 2.4 kbps.

Bob is probably very disappointed in you for *not* mentioning it, too.

There aren't many Slackers on this list, though... so most people
probably don't know what we're talking about at all....

  I used to reject 'em all with a 550 error message that was a coded rule.
That way I could fix false positives when folks told me about them. Now, I'm
discarding all multi-word rules because I've not yet seen a false positive
on them.

  When I asked on the postfix mail list about guidelines for electing
'discard' versus 'reject' I was told there no such guidelines. So, after a
few years rejecting 'em I'm now discarding 'em. Don't know if it makes any
difference.

It is kilobits per second.  With a decent codec, voice doesn't take 
much bandwidth.  That's why all the backbone voice carriers are 
slowly rolling out VoIP onto existing fiber.  They can get a lot more 
conversations on a single fiber with a good codec than they can with 
uncompressed data.

Uncompressed voice uses 64kbps.  Compressed can do about 8-9 times 
better.  Seems funny that you should get such good compression until 
you realize a few things:

1) the human voice is in a very narrow frequency band.

2) the human voice can be modelled relatively well with a fairly small 
number of parameters.

3) around 30% of all the time in a conversation is dead silence.  This 
can be between words, between sentences, little audible pauses etc.

Given those three things, the bit rates look a lot more reasonable.  
Even with overhead for UDP/RTP etc. two conversations on a solid 28.8 
connection is possible.  The latency is ugly though :-P

Best,
Kyle

The general symbol I've seen for an open wifi ap, is ")(", w/out the

  I don't know this, either. Do I need to do anything to /etc/resolv.conf?

  After all Kurt's unselfish help, yes!

  I guess that I need to find me a public WAP. They're rather rare here in
the boondocks of Troutdale.

  So, while the interface shows up upon boot, it requires an explicit
'iwconfig' to make the system aware of the card. Kewel!

  What's my next lesson in using WiFi?

There's a difference between reject and bounce. You should never
generate new mail by bouncing the message. But rejecting it during
the SMTP handhake will let a legitimate sender know that their email
didn't get through. If you silently drop it then victims of false
positives will never know what happened to their message. It won't
make any difference with real spam... spammers ignore rejects anyway.

Once your system accepts the email, though, rejecting is pointless.
So if you're talking about SpamAssassin during local delivery,
that's different.

Has anyone had any recent experience with Verisign's Payflow Pro, with PHP 
on Redhat (9)?
I'm looking at assisting a customer who is affixed to Payflow Pro, in this setup,
and I'm going around in circles. I don't particularily want to download PHP source
and recompile PHP but it's looking like I'm going to have to. I've downloaded the
verisign SDK, but can't find a API listing, just what's available on the php.net
site. What it looks like is that I need to use the SDK and place header / so files
in a directory and then reference that directory and /rebuild/ php. But- I'm using
RedHat so I don't have to rebuild components. Or am I just being a spoilt brat?

Your help is appreciated. ;)

OK, so I've got this tax return and I'm moving to a new home that has
minimal move-in costs and so I'm getting back my obscene deposits from the
criminal userer^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H landlord and so I'll have some cash that
just might get diverted into finally updating my lame workstation.

I've got a really decent dual PIII motherboard and a gig of PC133 SDRAM
but a single rather pathetic processor on the board.

I could just max out the motherboard with procs that fit.  I think the
best I could do would be a pair of PIII 1.3GHz things and another gig of
RAM.

OR I could go with something on the middley-end of what's current (because
I'll need new motherboard, power supply likely, as well as processors and
memory).

Is the new fast bus stuff really that much faster?  Is it really
worthwhile to have DDR memory and a single 2GHz processor over the
maxed-out system I could have for much less money?

Thanks.

I guess the best my mobo will take are 1.4GHz.

And does 512K cache make a huge difference over 256k?

I had a problem where my j2re would only run applications if I am logged 
in as root.  I tried to find out how to fix it by searching the 
Internet, but I discovered that a lot of people have this problem and 
can not fix it.  I reported it to Sun as a bug and they told me it is a 
usage error, probably my umask.  I can't find much info on umask other 
than that it is a bash command.  Is it the same as file permissions (set 
with chmod) or is it something else?  My umask for root is 0002 and my 
umask for my other user is 0022.  What does this stuff mean?  And how do 
I change it?

I run Red Hat 9.

I keep hoping to replace my hardware, so I've been tracking hardware
capabilities.

Be careful, just because they use the same socket doesn't mean they'll
work together. I think it was the 1.13GHz P3 they changed one of the pins
and older motherboards wouldn't work; check whether the motherboard
officially supports the P3 1.3GHz processors.

Not all the recent motherboards require the P4 connector, though many
(including a number of the AMD ones) do. There are also some recent
boards that will work with vanilla SDRAM too. The ECS K7S boards have a
horrendous DOA rate, but if you avoid the DOA they're a very good board
(these are the ones Fry's offers every week bundled with an Athlon
2600+). This then comes to the next issue...

Well, increasing the memory bandwidth by a factor of two (bottom-end
modern board/133MHz+DDR) to six (high-end board/200MHz+DDR+dual channel)
helps in most cases.

Everything helps. On the P3s and Athlons it helps, but not a horrendous
amount. Very different matter with the P4s though, on the P4 that extra
cache is absolutly *critical*. Also note that the P4s with 1MB cache are
the "Prescott" core whose performance is somewhat dubious...

In your case it sounds like you'd want a low-mid range Athlon. You can
get higher-clocked P4s for the money, but the Athlons are far better
performers (AMD's performance code numbers are /roughly/ accurate).

Samba isn't exactly a regular filesystem, but it is capable of writing
files with a specific uid, independent of the uid of the actual user.  I
have set up systems that use both Samba and WebDAV to read and write the
same files.  Its not regular, but it is a mix.

But will a single "low-mid range Athlon" outpace my dual PIIIs?

That's really the question.  Is there really significant increases in
real performance or is it just upgrading for upgrading's sake?

(We see this ALL THE TIME in the cycling world... splined bottom brackets,
threadless headsets, etc... not BETTER than what came before, but
different and "more advanced".  Looks good on paper, lots of benchmarks,
but real-world performance doesn't change a bit.)

I'm not too thrilled with P4 technology myself.  It seems a little
bleeding edge.  A good PIII is something to go ahead and bore out.  
I don't even have 1 Ghz PIII's, but I'm happy.  I have an
Athlon system I put together cheaply through E-Bay, I've been 
happy with it.  That was a super deal though.  I wonder if any of the
P4 enhancements work. I probably use the processor to get 
video performance if there aren't drivers that can take 
proper advantage of my video card.  Biggest disappointment is 
when incompatible parts are integrated.  Probably best to spend 
a little more money and get something that won't give you trouble 
or keep what you have.

A friend of my brother's who marked hard drives as bad found them
at Fry's.  They literally will sell garbage as new stuff there.
Seems Oregon has no law that states that new and refurbished/
repackaged goods have to be distinguished from each other.
Guess I take the same risk on E-Bay though, so it's fairly 
relative.

Another option is to cluster four old but solid Pentium III's
together, might be better than 1 Pentium 4.  Theoretically, if
you cluster AMD and Intel technology you should have all of
the best optimizations, but I don't know if clustering works
this way.  Apparently scheduling is a huge problem for cluster
performance.  One advantage of a cluster is many controllers 
to hook drives up to and places to add memory, assuming you 
b channel with fast enough cards that there isn't a network 
bottleneck.  With 10k cards and very short patch cables, that 
shouldn't be an issue.

Big thing is, you can theoretically using Linuxbios set up some
computing power really cheap.  I guess the kernel gets installed
into the bios itself, very fast boot.  You can set up one
machine with drives and network boot as many other motherboards
as needed for raw power.  I've heard of LTSP being used this way.
Mosix comes to mind too.

There was a Linux cluster at PSU before I left, that's when the
new building with all the glass was finished.  Have no idea how
anyone gets to find out anything about it, but it's there.  It's
a ridiculous number of computers in standard cases on shelves.
I wonder why they didn't go rack mount?

No, because that breaks SMTP.  He means reject, as in, after DATA has
arrived, reject it at SMTP-time.  You can do this for more than just
spam, you should be doing this for virus-infected mail already (and
not sending bounce messages after accepting it like too many sites
do).

This is from my umask manpage. (for the C function)

The  umask  is  used  by  open(2)  to set initial file permissions on a
newly-created file.  Specifically, permissions in the umask are  turned
off  from  the  mode  argument  to open(2) (so, for example, the common
umask default value of 022 results in new files being created with per-
missions  0666  &  ~022  = 0644 = rw-r--r-- in the usual case where the
mode is specified as 0666).

I'm not telling you to RTFM: I don't think I fully understand that
paragraph myself. But it might make sense to you!

The umask command in bash has a "-S" switch which will display your current
umask setting in symbolic form instead of octal. This may help in
understanding what's going on. When setting a new umask value in bash, you
may specify it in octal or symbolic form.

It's a fairly recent thing for umask to be shown as four octal digits. For
a long time it was just three. The new digit on the front has a default
of zero, so 0022 is the same as 022. The extra digit is used for special
bits like the SUID and SGID.

Note that the symbolic representation is inverted from the octal
representation. So an octal umask of 022 is represented symbolically as
"u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx". The octal value says: These permission bits will *not*
be set for newly created files. The symbolic representation says: These
are the most permissive settings that will be given to newly created files.

Here's a general discussion of permissions:

http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/answers.php?action=viewarticle&artid=20

It doesn't talk about umask but it does explain the octal-represented
permission bits.

Be aware that if you change your umask, it only applies to the current
process (bash) and the processes it creates. If you want to change it for
your whole environment you should put a umask command in your login script,
then log out and back in.

This depends on what you are doing, what chipset you get to run it, and
the speed of the memory.  It will certainly compile a kernel faster (if
that is the only task running), but may not hold up under many heavy
tasks.  Remember, you can't split a task across two processors, and
faster memory is always a good thing.  

Disk I/O speed is something else to consider, SATA, when coupled to the
right drive (high rpm, large cache), is going to be much faster than the
UDMA33 your old motherboard is capable of doing and less expensive than
SCSI.

Beware that AMD has still not implemented any kind of thermal
protection, the motherboard is still responsible for shutting down an
overheated processor.  However, the nVidia chipset looks like an
impressive performer. 

Sorry, there is no easy answer to your questions.

By default the module name (shown by lsmod) is the same as the the module's
file name (without the .o) but the device driver may override the default
during its initialization and specify some other name.

Likewise, network device drivers get to decide during their initialization
what the base interface name should be. I have this vague recollection of a
feature for forcing a particular interface name on a device driver, but
I can't recall how or even if the feature really exists. Obviously the setting
in /etc/modules.conf isn't it.

What the driver absolutely can't do is choose the interface number. The
kernel does that. So if eth0 already exists and the new driver wants to
be eth-something, then it will get eth1.

Actually most of the important ones will be caught by kudzu at boot
time.

The only difficulty is if he changes video cards and has the default run

level set to 5.  (i.e. booting into X.)  To fix that you have to boot in

single user mode and change the runlevel to something sane, like 3.
(DON'T 
set it to 6.  Double-plus ungood.) I don't believe kudzu fixes a change
in 
videocards correctly in X.

Terry,

  OK. I suppose there's some logic behind the different names but we mere
mortals are not to be exposed to that reasoning.

  So this, too, is built into the object. Works for me.

  This certainly makes sense.

I sent this to Jeme last night, but thought I'd post it here for
general information.  I have a dual P3-1GHz with a gig of PC133 RAM
and a P4-2.53GHz with a gig of 533MHz DDR RAM.  For an allnoconfig
2.6.5 kernel compile (for pippin-to-gravenstein comparison), here's
what I found:

 P4: $ time make 
     69.84s user 10.48s system 95% cpu 1:24.01 total
 
 P3: $ time make -j4
     159.04s user 20.73s system 181% cpu 1:39.19 total

The source files almost certainly had been loaded into cache by the
time I ran these, so disk speed isn't so relevant (the P3 probably has
marginally faster disks).  The P4 box had no swap and maybe a 100 meg
of RAM in use for X, mozilla, etc.  The P3 box has swap but not much
in use and approximately the same load.  Adding -j's to the P4 didn't
significantly change things.  With only a -j2 on the P3 about doubled
total time.

Note the P4 was not a lot faster.  From CPU clock speed alone (never
mind memory speed), you'd expect a 26.5% improvement with the P4, but
only observed about 18%.

FWIW.

Are you thinking of: /sbin/nameif ?

The alias was probably inserted when your system was installed.  It
doesn't look like a discrepancy to me, if you want the Prism54 interface
to show up as wlan0, change that line to match the driver that is
actually loading.

The only thing I can think of is to write a couple of scripts that will
bring down the interface, unload its module, load the other module and
then bring up the interface.

Only if you find that each interface does something the other doesn't.

though the developers are working on hostap support.  BTW, Wellenrieter
does a great job with the hostap drivers.

Another good explanation is in the book by Evi Nemeth, et alia, _UNIX System
Administration Handbook_ (pp.70-75). Actually, I have found this book a
valuable reference on many intermediate to advanced topics (e.g., SCSI, serial
devices, networking) related to Unix-like Operating Systems.

I should have known that make would fork out tasks, it has been a long
time since I've compiled a kernel on a dual proc. system.  What kernel
was running the compile?

The dual P3 is a VIA chipset (Apollo Pro266, a SuperMicro

You saw the no-j for P4.  For the P3, I get:

That looks like it. So the next question - What's the kernel hook
for doing this? From running nameif with strace it appears to be
an ioctl() operation. I could look at the source code to find out
for sure ... but suddenly I've run out of curiosity. (I think it's
that big plate of spaghetti I just scarfed.)

By the chipset, that one is a single channel, and will only run memory
at either 266MHz or 333MHz, the memory bus itself is either 133MHz or
166MHz.  The processor bus is run at either 400MHz or 533MHz.  The 865
and 875 chipsets will run dual channel,  The 875 has a memory bus of up
to 200MHz, so the DDR comes out looking like 400MHz, dual channel means
the processor can access two sticks of RAM at the same time (but the
processor must be designed for it).  The processor bus on the 875 can
run at 800MHz.

I ran a similar compile with a 2.6.4 kernel on a P4 2.8Gig with an 875
chipset, 512Megs of DDR (dual channel).  My results were a different
format:

real 1m11.670s
system 1m2.922s
user 0m6.011s

For some reason, I can't convince it to be more verbose.

Interesting, not the behavior I would expect from reading the man page
for make.

Did you realize that you can click on "Driving Directions", put in both

No modconf installed, apparently:

spectre:/var/log# locate modconf
/usr/share/vim/vim62/syntax/modconf.vim
spectre:/var/log#

I would love to apt-get modconf, it the NIC worked! ;)  Is it possible to
ftp the .deb or whatever it comes in and put it onto my jumpdrive, and
install it from there?  Do I then use dpkg instead of apt-get install?

Nothing there, either:

spectre:/var/log# cat /etc/network/interfaces
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# This entry was created during the Debian installation
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
spectre:/var/log#

Did I mention that it detects and enables the NIC just fine on the first
install/boot up, but then for whatever reason seems to lose the drivers
upon rebooting?   I believe it is the same problem for my sound card,
rather than a general permission issue as I previously speculated.

Thanks!

Am not very knowledgeable about the various indications, but here is the
entire log from my booting up at 11:45AM today:

Is anything there standing out as the culprit?

If I need modconf to load modules, the system seems to not have it (see
other email to Jeme).  Here is the output of my lspci:

Don't have one in any ~/user directory.  Found one xsession file in

The two crucial points have been brought up. What speed P3s will that
board support? Unless you've got something designed to work in a
multi-processor environment the single faster processor is likely better.

I feel the first question is the big issue. Intel changed the pin
assignments near when the P3 hit 1GHz creating an electrical
incompatibility, but not a physical one (socket was the same, but the
newer processors would no longer work with older boards). Before you make
the decision check the exact model number and revision of your board,
what is the fastest processor it will support? If it can only handle
processors up to 800MHz...

The other issue is the worth depends on what exactly you're doing.
Threaded programs will do better on the dual P3s. Programs not written
for multi-processor systems will be faster on a single Athlon. This is
the majority of programs so unless your board supports processors faster
than 900MHz I have to point towards the single faster processor.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0404181359400.6646@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I'm working today on getting my fiancee's system back to working with the
network. Someone here recommended that I install qpopper to handle the pop3
requests from sylpheed, mozilla or whatever she wants to use on that laptop.

  Qpopper was configured to run in standalone mode and use openssl. It made
and installed just fine, and I invoked the daemon in /usr/local/sbin/. Is
there anything else I need to do? Any options that should be fed to it? The
GUIDE.pdf is quite comprehensive and I don't think I missed anything, but
I'd like the views of those who have been running it.

TIA,

Rich

We're talking about my desktop machine here.  Very few of us are doing
intense numerical analysis all day every day with non-threaded software.

A modern desktop machine runs a dozen or two programs simultaneously.
Whether the individual applications are threaded or not, I would think
you're getting much better performance from a multi-processor system.

Of course.  The motherboard I have claims to carry a "universal Socket
370" that supports FCPGA/FCPGA2.  I'm thinking this covers the fastest
S370 processors available.

Analogy carries over in other ways: The reason real-world performance
might not change for these spiffy new bike parts is because you're not
the level of athlete that can take advantage of them.

If your home workload doesn't need huge performance, maybe you're
better off scrounging up the remaining parts for your dual P3 and
saving cash. I'll bet that more than likely you need better/more hard
drives before you need screaming CPU performance.

Subject: [PLUG] Network problems need other minds
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0404181534310.6646@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  I've spent all day trying to resolve two problems (printing and mail) from
a laptop. I'm completely stymied and would greatly benefit from other minds
applied to the problems.

  1) Printing:

  /etc/printcap on the laptop (hostname=pachy) has the printers defined
properly.

   As root, from within mozilla and connected to http://localhost:631, the
color deskjet and laserjet are visible and I can print test pages from
within the CUPS administrative page.

  As a user I can print a text file across the network by specifying, for
example, 'lpr -P laser5 text.file'.

  However, I cannot print from within either OO.o-1.1.1 or mozilla-1.7b.
Both freshly installed and configured today. Within each application I can
specify the printer (the laserjet has three different definitions -- for
single-sided, double-sided and a generic anem -- and all three names work
from within CUPS local Web page or the command line) but nothing comes out.
There's nothing in the print spool on the server. I'm completely out of
ideas. A few months ago this all worked perfectly. Now it doesn't work at
all.

  2) E-mail:

  This also used to work but stopped. I configured the latest-and-greatest
mozilla-1.7b to send/retrieve mail from mail.appl-ecosys.com. Incoming is on
the server's port 110 and downloaded from /var/spool/mail/<username> to the
laptop's /home/<username>/mail; well, it's supposed to be but the connection
keeps timing out. The hostname, mail.appl-ecosys.com, is in /etc/hosts on
both the laptop and the server.

  Outgoing mail doesn't. That's supposed to be going to
mail.appl-ecosys.com:25. Neither from mozilla's e-mail application nor from
the Web browser.

  I just realized that I have not explicitly tried writing directly to mail.

  Earlier today I installed 'qpopper' and it's running on
mail.appl-ecosys.com.

  Perhaps these are both simple to resolve and I'm just not seeing the
answers because I'm too close to the problems for too long. But, I'm
completely out of ideas. Your help will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Rich

Yes. I want about 15 locations. Looks like I'll be pasting together 15
individual maps. Is the GIMP the best tool for this operation?

There is some kind of distinction between "Coppermine" and
"Tualatin".  I believe the higher clock P3's are Tualatin and might
not be supported by older motherboards (research before you buy).

I *think* FCPGA2 corresponds to Tualatin support, but don't take my
word for it.

P3's aren't necessarily cheaper than P4's these days though.  At
(chosen randomly) zipzoomfly.com, a 1.4GHz P3 is $208.  A 3.06GHz P4
is $224 (and you only need one!).  1GHz P3's are quoted at $96 each.

Man is it expensive :-o  It's evidently going to be held at the Marriot.
I guess it's free on two of the days to see the exhibit hall, but I don't
get $300+ to listen to someone speak for one day.

 In Mozilla when you hit the print button select the properties
button at the command screen and the string that is actually used
will be displayed. You can change this if you need to. Another 
method you can use with Mozilla is to simply print to postscript 
file and use ghostview type program (I use gv) to print the files. This
also allows you to easily correlate printed pages like 1,3,5 then 2,4,6
on the front and back of printed pages.
 I don't know how OO uses the printer or where the commands are kept in
the config files.

If you can't access it then for some reason the server is not running
or it is configured not to allow connections outside of
localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1) or a firewall is blocking the port.

as root 
service qpopper 
or
service --status-all
may tell you if the service is running.

 If you are using SSL then most likely you should not use
port 110, but 563 or whatever that ssl/tsl port is.

I also tried this on a dual P4 Xeon 2.4GHz box. Those are also HT
processors, so /proc/cpuinfo shows four logical processors. Not being
satisfied w/ only -j4, I continued to double the parallelization
(rerunning the distclean and allnoconfig each time). As you can see, the
improvement lessens dramatically after -j8. I was impressed that they
didn't start to increase until 512 parallel makes! I can't account for
the -j2 build being slower than the single make, but that was consistent
over several builds.

Exactly how pathetic?

AMD, definitely.  I don't much care for my K7S5A motherboard, but the
CPU has been a dear, and the combo cost like $50.  The Athlon64s are the
fastest thing out there and getting affordable I hear.  And I'm of the
opinion that DDR is appropriate on anything with 512MB or more of RAM.

Note that by the time you're done, you'll be a hard drive ($.50/gig) and
a video card ($5 or so at FreeGeek) away from a whole 'nother 'pooter.

Yes and yes.  How much less money, really?  And do you need the
horsepower?  If you find you need a GB+ of RAM, you likely do.  
But watawino, I'm running an AMD 1.3GHz and a half-gig of RAM, and 
think it's more than I need.

Alternate things to spend it on:
Better monitor (can't upgrade eyes, after all)
Quieter computer
PVR card
WiFi toys
Really nice dinner/show with SO
ISEPP season tickets

On the PLUG mailing list, Russell Senior writes:
> Anybody go, want to do a trip report?

I went with my wife, and gave my Dirvish/Rsync talk .  I saw Brian
Martin (who gave a VMWare talk), and a couple of fellows from Corvallis,
but it appeared to be mostly Washington and B.C. folk.  There appeared
to be about 600-800 people there;  fortunately, it was a sunny day and
folks could schmooze outside, because inside it was CROWDED.

There were big posters and street banners for the Fest all over
Bellingham.  The locals really put a lot into this.

The Bellingham Technical College was well equipped (if small) for
this event; LCD projectors, free wifi in all the rooms, ample
parking, etc.  Sort of a PCC-Rock-Creek kind of setup.   Next year,
it will probably have to move to a larger venue, though. 

The cafeteria was taken over by vendors and user groups.  I bought
some books at 60% off.  I considered buying a stuffed Tux for $10 and
didn't (give the infants distros, not plush toys, I say!), and picked
up an install disk and a 5% off flier for VMware Workstation 4.5
( referral code VMRC-BILWRI265 ).  My wife got a Seattle Linuxchix T-shirt.

Outside, there were stands set up to sell grilled salmon, hotdogs,
and misc. junk food (excuse me, programmer fuel). 

The talks were mostly good to very good, though there were only 
6 time slots and things got crowded in the 11 parallel sessions.
I missed Rasmus Lerdorf's talk on PHP, which I'm told was the best
talk.  I did see two extremely good talks, one by Chris Negus and
Tom Weeks on Fedora / Redhat Troubleshooting (these guys needed
another hour) and one by Brian Hatch on Linux Security.   I saw a
talk that was merely "very good" by Tim Witteveen about the PNNL High
performance Linux Cluster, and another by Charles Ditzel of Sun, mostly
about Java Desktop,  a Sun Linux distro with Staroffice and Java and
Netbeans built in (SunJD users in the audience thought highly of it). 

My talk was in a smaller room, but still SRO with people in the
doorway, and well received.  It was in a room designed for cooking
classes (with a noisy fridge).  If the Detroit MI area Penguicon
( http://www.penguicon.org ) isn't scheduled on top of Linuxfest
next year, perhaps Marcel Gagne could give an intimate Linux Chef
talk in that room.

My wife went mostly to the newbies sessions, and learned a lot. 
Now I can look forward to her correcting my bad habits :-)  Newbie
sessions were moved from a room for 40 to a room for 100.  In general,
small planning mistakes like that were corrected rapidly and expertly.

There were a couple of "well, here's the screen of my laptop, 
here's an xterm, what do you want me to show you" talks that I
walked out of.  Obviously, a few people had never been in front
of a crowd of non-electronic brains before.  But with 5 to 11 tracks
to choose from, there were plenty of non-bozos right next door.

Brian and I made it a point to attend different talks, so he can tell us
about the different talks that he saw.  There will be lots of pointers
to the various talks, with many of the presenter's websites reachable,
at:     http://lfnw.blug.org/fest2004/schedule.dxp .

Some audience members were VERY knowledgable, it was like 6 hours of
Advanced Topics without the beer.  The beer came later, at the Afters
party sponsored by Fibercloud.  My wife and I went to that for about
half an hour;  I argued with a system manager from Boeing for a while
(he felt that Fedora Core 2 Test 1 Rawhide wasn't easy enough to use.
Well, duh!).   My wife and I decided that shouting over an amplified
band was less fun than watching the sunset over Puget Sound, and the
mountains and valleys back to Everett and south.

We stayed with friends in Gig Harbor on friday and saturday night, so
we did not learn much about Bellingham motels, beyond the fact that
there are a bunch of them.  We also learned that the free upgrade
from rental econo-car to mini-van can be financially punishing at
$2/gallon (the trip was 580 miles RT).  Vegetarians looking for food
on Saturday should consider the Potato Burrito at Casa Que Pasa on
Railroad Ave.

Overall, one of the best Linux events I've ever seen.  If they do one
of these next year, go!  My wife the non-geek had fun, so bring your
S.O. with you.  Perhaps with some additional help they might even
have a childcare track (script kiddie for kiddies?) next year, so
this could easily become a family weekend event.

Yep, that works.  Once I got the NIC online, used Jeme's advice and
apt-got modconf.  It also accomplishes the same and said it was able to
successfully install my audio AC97.  However still don't get any sound,
and upon rebooting the NIC is gone again.

1)  How do I make the NIC module load at bootup?
2)  Any other suggesions for the audio?  The error message I think still
suggests a driver problem.  Why would it be that the install portion picks
up all these devices and works great, but then it forgets about the
modules after rebooting?
3)  Maybe I should start another message, but I am unhappy with my choice
of video resolutions when picking from Control Center, Scree, and
Resolutions.  The max size is 1024x768, and also the max resolution
offered is 60hz (bleh).  Is it safe to say that my video card (Radeon
9700) is not being recognized?

Thanks again!

Is this alsa?  Alsa defaults mostly to mute, so you need to use
alsamixer (or equivalent) to un-mute appropriate channels.

Subject: [PLUG] Binding portmap, cups, and other nfs services...
Message-ID: <408384E7.1080301@robinson-west.com>

As an example, samba-swat comes into play as a problem too.  
Doing an nmap test on this machine, I found samba-swat showing
up on the external interface even though it is explicitly listed in an
xinetd config file as only being accessible on the loopback.

I've run into trouble with the non xinetd wrapped rpc.statd service
binding to interfaces it shouldn't be also.  Is there a way to run
portmapper without having visible ports show up on the wrong
local interfaces?

I have my tape drive on this machine where I need a way to remotely
mount a dump disk.  I've had trouble with samba connections breaking,
hence I'm trying nfs since LTSP uses it without too much difficulty.

I like to probe my gateways using www.grc.com's scanner.  With ports
like rpc.statd showing up, they don't pass the probe.

So has anyone gotten the nfs portmapper installed securely on a gateway
or is it impossible to restrict which interfaces it binds to?

As for cups and samba-swat, I turned them off since this machine
currently doesn't have a printer attached and samba is already
configured.

Subject: [PLUG] Working with NTFS...
Message-ID: <408389B8.9030300@robinson-west.com>

I have a long term plan on network booted Linux as a tool complete
with nfs mount to hook to my tape drive for use in backing up and
restoring workstations with Windows/Dos/Linux mixtures on them.  
How about NTFS, how do I restore an NTFS system using Linux
if Linux can't write NTFS?  Can Linux even create an NTFS
system?  The biggest problem it seems is resizing partitions during
restoration.  With fat this isn't an issue, with NTFS support being
so sketchy under Linux there seems to be no way.

I wish Windows filesystems weren't changing so that Linux has a
hard time supporting them.  I got XP Home preinstalled, I don't even
know how it is installed from scratch normally.  As it was, the Linux
rescue cd that shrunk the NTFS partition safely had only been in
existence for four days when I downloaded the iso to open up space
for Linux.  It would be nice if I had tools to create FAT16/32, NTFS,
Win95, ... etc. partitions under Linux.  For fat there are ample tricks
using a network booted dos or dos based Windows boot disk.  I
don't know what to do for XP.

If I had installed XP I would have chosen fat though I guess this
isn't an option.  What are people doing about this problem?  I
would think that Microsoft would be smart enough to not
limit NTFS's popularity by making it hard to support using
OSS and other commercial third party tools.

  Thanks, Keith. Compiling to use ssl was a whim; it's all on the internal
network and behind the firewall.

  I need to identify the port that qpopper is using. 'netstat -n' doesn't
appear to tell me and 'apropos port' reveals nothing useful. I don't recall
the command that displays all the ports and what service uses each one.
'/sbin/service' is interesting but also doesn't show what ports are used for
the POP server.

  What's the command, please?

It's a list of services and appropriate ports.
If your distro doesn't have this file let me (or someone) know and I can send

Keith,

  Doesn't matter if there's a space between the option and the printer name.
On this workstation, where everything works as intended, the mozilla printer
property includes the space.

  Regardless, OO.o knows the printers by name from /etc/printcap.

  All hosts are within the lan and behind the firewall.

  Well, this _is_ interesting. /usr/local/sbin/popper is not running. When I
try adding it via the RH 7.3 version of 'chkconfig --add popper' I see that
the service is not known. Even when I specify the full path it's still not
known.

  Also, when I try to telnet to the mail server's port 110, telnet goes
looking at our ourside IP address.

  So, I've messed up things big time. What do I need to do to allow my
fiancee to access her mail (stored on mail:/var/spool/mail/<hername> from
her ethernet-connected laptop running mozilla mail? (It's a very good thing
I don't have to try to make a living as a SysAdmin, eh?)

upon further reflection. I may have mis-understood. If you have nmap 
installed, it's fairly straightforward.

nmap "host address"

Chris,

  Aha! I was close, but missed the mark.

  As it turns out, POP3 over SSL is on port 995. But, the replacement server
seems to have died and is not recognized by chkconfig. So, I better fix that
problem first.

Many thanks,

You know this bothers me.

1/4 sec is 0.250s or 250ms.

I have never seen a *functioning* DSL line run more than 80ms. Frankly I
have not seen anything but analog modems run above 120, aside from
USWEST Frame when the routing is broken.

I wonder if the original question meant a modem line, or 25ms?

  According to lsmod, prism54 is loaded, but I cannot get a MAC address from
the card when I try 'iwconfig eth1'. If I try to not load prism54 (or it's
synonym, prism2_cs) and use hostap_cs, there's still no luck. If I bring
down the eth1 interface and try to bring it up again with the hostap_cs, it
just will not come back up.

  Where do I start to diagnose this problem? The card _does_ light up when
placed in another laptop known to work.

On my last laptop I spent a lot of time trying to diagnose card/driver 
problems, and it turned out one of the PCMCIA slots was bad.  If your laptop 
has two PCMCIA slots, I'd suggest making sure you've tried the other slot.

  Thanks for the idea, Ryan. My machine has only 1 slot (but a couple of USB
sockets). I'll check if the vendor tested the slot.

hostap_cs should activate the card as interface wlan0, you may also need
to set some of the wireless extensions like "essid any" and "mode
managed".  There are two steps to activating a wireless card after the
drivers are loaded (though most distros combine them into a single
step).  First the wireless extensions need to be set with iwconfig, then
the IP settings net to be set with ifconfig.  Debian combines these by
being able to define both the wireless extensions and the IP settings in
/etc/network/interfaces, so the command "ifup wlan0" loads both the
wireless settings and the IP settings.

Run "tail -f /var/log/syslog" as root, then pop the card out, wait, pop
the card back in.  My guess is that you have hotplug running and it will
try to load the card's drivers, hopefully this will give you a clue.  If
nothing happens, then either hotplug isn't running, or some piece of
hardware is broken.  If hotplug isn't running, "modprobe hostap_cs"
should spew to syslog.  To get a second opinion, try booting Knoppix
with the card in, then look through the syslog file.

Are you thinking of "netstat -l | grep tcp"?  nmap will be able to tell
what is running from another hosts point of view.

I mounted one partition of the new disk at a time and used "cp -ax" as root. I mostly followed the Disk Upgrade mini Howto, except for the bootloader stuff, since I am using GRUB instead of lilo.

Steve, The process you describe above worked great. There were a few hicups, like I did not label the new partitions and the kernal panic'd the first time I tried to boot with the new disk. But like you said, I was able to plug in the old disk and resolve the issue rather painlessly. Now with my 120G disk installed in the MythTV box I can store many more Scooby-Doo episodes and still have space to record Survivor!

Thanks,

On my notebook, I sometimes have to remove and reinsert the card(just a

Or your home may have marginal power-- many do.  Invest in in a decent
UPS and you won't have to worry about lags/brownouts causing problems like
this.  It doesn't have to be a huge UPS.  I have a 650VA unit with a
massively overconfigured PC, three switches, firewall, and cable modem
plugged into it.  The runtime is only 5 minutes, but that's more than
enough to cover brownouts (30s is generally enough here) and times when I
pop the breaker by running too many tools in my garage.  (If I ever find
the guy who wired half my house on one circuit, he's gonna have some

I caught Rasmus Lerdorf's PHP talk. It was very good. He hit on some
basic PHP programming techniques and then went into benchmarking and
tuning. Given that the presenters were given about 45minutes for their
talks, he did a good job of moving through on a quick schedule.

His slides are at: http://talks.php.net/show/bellingham

I also went to the Shorewall presentation and it gave a nice
background on the firewall. I'm putting it on my list for future
experimenting.

I second Keith's call for moving to a larger venue, the main room was
very crowded. Having never been to a LinuxWorld size show, I was
impressed and would go again.

Subject: [PLUG] Go with Battery Backed up SDRAM or not...
Message-ID: <408423FE.5000307@robinson-west.com>

I'm curious what is available thinking to use it on servers
instead of hard drives for a mail spool.  I'm considering
setting up back up caches that never deliver locally and
only delivering mail that isn't sender subscribed depending
on which account it is bound for.  I don't want to write to
hard disk at this stage so that untrusted mail isn't hard to
erase.
 
I figure using RAM will lengthen drive life and lower
internal case temperature since a mail spool can get hit
a lot.  My scsi box especially is a bit on the warm side.  
I have a 32 meg SDRAM chip and a 64 meg one also
that's probably just PC66.  Is there an SDRAM to IDE
hard drive simulation kit?  It would need to take nicad
batteries, have a charger built in, one sdram slot, and it
would need to simulate the AT command set.  I
suppose it could also simulate an atapi device.  I probably
want to run a power connector for these out to the ups so
that the charger is powered even when the server is off.  
How much power does it take to run an SDRAMM stick
for five minutes anyways?

As far as just using Sandisks, I don't know that they
would take getting written to and erased so many
times a day very well.  I also don't know that any
NVRAM device is any easier to erase completely
than a hard disk partition is.

Another option using a Sandisk is to set up the mail
spool in system ram with a boot time write to it from
a Sandisk and dump the contents of the ram spool
back to the Sandisk at shutdown.  The latter approach
in the case of lockups or improper shutdown isn't
going to be as robust though as a device that always
holds the spool nonvolatilely written to in a cautious
manner.  This approach is a matter of getting two usb
2 cards with usb conectors integrated right onto
the pci board so that I can install Sandisks inside my
server cases protecting them.

The other spool protection option would involve an
assumption that at least one server will always be
running.  Using nfs or samba, I could have two ram
drives on each server implementing a mirroring idea.  
Server B will check for a mirror of what it had on
Server A when it boots back up and vice versa.  As
long as both servers aren't turned off simultaneously,
nothing ever gets lost.  This means that writes have
to be synchronized though between a ram disk and
it's mirror ram disk.  With this scheme, I could still
 write to Sandisk at shutdown, but I avoid writing
data out when a mirror is still up.  

An improvement would be mirroring the two
backups again on the mailhub itself.  I don't
know if I would want a permanent spool
storage option or not on every server, but I
guess that would be the best.  Sandisks aren't
cheap at $50 a pop.  A dedicated hard drive
for nonvolatile spool storage starts to makes
more sense if it doesn't have to be written to
very often and I have a way to confidentially
erase it.  A hard drive really starts to make
sense if Linux puts it to sleep saving me
power and reducing heat without any
manual intervention.  

I have an old Conner 250 floppy tape drive,
but I can't seem to get it to work very well
under Linux.  Don't know if the tapes are
 junk or what.  If enough tapes are good, it
wouldn't be that hard to pick up two more
drives.  Tapes, like floppies, can be
shredded if there's a cheap enough supply
to replace them.  If I mount the tape drives
inside the server cases they are protected,
though that really makes replacing tapes
a pain.  At some point I guess I should
build a glass enclosed case for my three
servers.

You can install XP on a VFAT file system, although you
can't go back to it from an NTFS installation of XP.
However, the use of NTFS is the major reason why XP is
more stable than earlier versions of Windows.

Actually, I disagree. The NT kernel is what makes XP stable, not NTFS. I
have several cases where I use XP on FAT32 with just as much stability as on
NTFS.

I believe 3rd party utilities like PartitionMagic are able to convert NTFS
back to FAT32. However, I don't recommend the use of such utilities,
especially without a complete backup of your data.

Why use NTFS if you can't perform backup and restoration using
3rd party utilities?  Is any netbooted system that allows the creation
of NTFS partitions to whatever size is desired and restoration
of any partition to them of any other size that isn't larger available
without a costly license?
  
It would make more sense if Microsoft shucked NTFS and went
with ext3 or Reiserfs, at least then you'd be able to back
up your Windows system using Linux.  Microsoft dos client 3 is
so out of date and it won't help with NTFS anyways.  The current
Intel products don't offer NDIS drivers for some of the intrgrated
nics anyways it seems.  The other concern I have with Dell is
that their Windows installation may not be stock, I may not be
able to go out and buy a copy of XP PRO if I want it and
have it install successfully.  Microsoft doesn't seem to want
people backing up OEM systems and buying Windows upgrades.
 
Hopefully I just won't need XP and won't have to worry about it.  
Windows 2000 is another story though.  My brother set up a
computer for our dad thinking it would be better than 98, but it
uses NTFS too.  Seems like I can't get everyone completely
out of Windows fast enough considering data integrity
problems working with NTFS.

I would argue that NTFS makes Windows less stable because it's
proprietary.  Any system that doesn't back up is hardly worth
having.

Red Hat focuses on their distributions and products and they are really

the wlan drivers use 'wlan0'  just try 'iwconfig' and see what the

Look and see what the kernel *thinks* it found.

You can pop the card and reseat just before doing that, its quite
effective.

Then look at /var/log/messages.

BTW under redhat /etc/rc.d/init.d/pcmcia restart is almost always as
effective as popping the card, with the added benefit it tells you when
a pcmcia driver is stuck "on".  I often have an ethernet driver left
hanging around since the network still has it up.  Usually this means I
suspended with it in, or I told kudzu to autoconfigure it when it was in
while booting.

The venue call was made last year too.  The basic reaction has been BTC
is mostly free (some fees for cleaning I think) and near the core of
volunteers.

So if you want something nearer or bigger you must help out or organize
your own.  I would love to see 40-50 PLUG people there next year,
talking, volunteering, and attending.

Message-ID: <1082408152.9338.35.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Anyone else have problem with Free Civ under fedora?

I am using stock FC1 and freeciv.  Most of the windows for the game
popunder the window.  This is more annoying than an X10 add!

Also the message fonts for attacks and whatnot are invisible.  Makes it
tricky to see what happened in a battle.

I have not monkeyed *too* much with this system.  I have not had similar
issues with other apps.  I am bit worried I will see it (which is the
only reason I am caring).


rpm: freeciv-1.14.0-2

How about LPI, Linux Professional Institute Certification?  I have some 
materials
from IBM for an LPI certification on my web.site at 
http://www.robinson-west.com
under Michael.

I have a book my brother got me a couple of years ago, but it is too old 
and 2000
didn't seem to be the greatest time to certify.  I would imagine that 
things have
gotten better lately.  It's not an end all solution, I'd want to be able 
to build my
own Linux system from scratch and research organization methods for library
upgrades and such.  That requires a bit of programming skill.

I took the RHCE about two years ago and missed certification by
1%. They didn't offer a discounted retake price and I didn't want to
fork out another $750.

Last month I took the LPI Level 1 certification exams passed easily
with not too much studying (although I have much more experience
now). I took it mostly for resume fodder, but it's nice to know where
you are in the knowledge continuum. I think it does a decent job of
testing for its purpose.

I don't have any info on the current study materials. I
reviewed/studied for it straight from their detailed objectives list
on the website.

Message-ID: <20040420000955.GA12807@nellump.net>

A question for the list's SCSI aficionados:

Where do you shop for reasonably-priced SCSI hard disk drives? By
reasonably-priced, I mean something that's at least close to competitive
with run-of-the-mill IDE drives. I realize that there's a price to pay
for SCSI's performance advantages, but I have had a difficult time
finding any SCSI drives that are less than 10k RPM. The prices (again,
relative to IDE) are exorbitant, and the capacities are usually less,
too.

Is there such a thing as a SCSI HDD that approaches $1/GB, or am I
better off buying an ATA controller and a cheap IDE drive?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.52.0404191742270.32551@shaft.bitmine.net>

OK, so I'm looking at TV stuff (half dreaming, half seriously).

I don't watch TV.  I don't have cable and I don't expect to ever need
multiple simultaneous television inputs.

I've been using my PC and its TVOut stuff to feed my television DVD and
DiVX ;-) videos for quite some time.  But now the TV is kind of dying and
I'm seriously considering just using a big old monitor instead of a
television.  The only trick is the VCR.  I still want access to the tapes.
So I will need TV-in so I can watch VHS on the computer (as well as
digitize analog input, which is cool).

I'm looking at the hardware options (including the MythTV hardware
database) and I'm coming to see that perhaps the most expensive choice is
the cheapest!  That is to say, it seems like the best price/performance
point is buying a high-end TV card that will do hardware encoding AND
decoding so that the PC itself can be relatively low powered.

Does anyone here know much about the hardware decoder cards?  Do they only
do output to TV or can the decoded video go to your regular graphics
adapter?

Does it make sense?  Cheap PC with good encoder/decoder card?  I figure
you can do the whole thing for well under $400 from scratch.  I happen to
have a PIII-450 sitting idle in my living room that would seem perfect
with the right card (the playback right now is choppy).

Is there a hardware decoder that will do DiVX and DVD as well?  Or is that
all of a piece and I'm drawing artificial distinctions?

Lots of questions... still reading.

More of an aside than a proposed solution, but if you A) don't mind
doing any necessary encoding in software, and B) have an interest in
creating your own videos, it's possible to use a MiniDV camera as a poor
man's A/D converter. Most cameras have analog inputs, and will stream
the incoming signal to your computer via a FireWire port in real-time.
DV cams can be had for under $300, too.

I'm not an expert on all the codecs and what they can and cannot do. 

However, a P3/450 with a card that does mpeg encoding should be fine.
The key there, of course, is the card that does the encoding for you.
The hauppauge 250 cards seem to be the most popular. They're $150 at
fry's last time I checked. 

Join and read the mythtv lists, you'll find lots of (and probably too
much) information.

Mythtv has many modules, including one that can play DVDs. Actually, all
it really does is launch a real player (like mplayer) with command line
options. Nevertheless, having those modules integrated to mythtv results
in a single application that does it all. 

Good luck, 

sasha

Fixed!  Although am sure your advice above was correct, after running
modconf per Jeme, it seems to update /etc/modules for me.  NIC and audio
(see below) work fine every time at bootup.

Turns out another driver issue.  I thought all I needed was the ac97
module.  So I cheated- I booted back up on my redhat drive where the sound
works and did an lsmod.  That showed i810_audio, ac97_codec, and soundcore
seemed to be the only sound-related modules running.  I booted back into
Debian, added those (and removed the wrong modules with modconf, and now
I've got sound too! :) :)

Indeed, I didn't realize that I could adjust the H & V frequencies from
Peripherals, X display.  Once I put it appropriate values for H & V, then
suddenly I had the choice of higher screen resolutions and refresh rates. 
Looks good now!

Thanks for all your help, Derek, Jeme & Evan.

Yeah, modconf does that.  It's a good hierarchical module browser with
appropriate dependency loading.

All you'd really need to do in modconf is add the i810 audio driver and
that would automatically load the ac97 and soundcore modules.

But you do need proper perms, of course.

That's all just for future reference, of course.

Good to see it all works.

No idea why modconf didn't go in by default, though.  That's totally
weird.  I always thought base-config depended on it, but it doesn't (at
least not directly -- didn't check for deeper dependency).

And decoding!  I've tried watching divx flicks on the P3/450 and it's
choppy as hell.  Same with dvd.

I found the PVR-350 online for around $180, so that seems like a great
price and it does decoding.  I just don't know if there's any relief
provided by the hardware mpeg-2 decoder for divx movies.

Yeah, that's exactly what I need... one more high volume mailing list.

Typically they can do output to a monitor using a pass-through. 
Different cards may very though.

No, there are not hardware decoders that will do divx yet, divx is quite 
a bit different encoding and there is currently no standard so there are 
half a dozen slightly different codecs out there, divx, xvid, the ogg 
one, etc.. They may eventually be standardized under mpeg4, but until 
then it's unlikely there will be much hardware support for them.

Pretty much all the decoder/encoder cards will handle mpeg 1 and 2. DVDs 
are mpeg2, so any of them should be able to handle dvd decoding properly.

You can still use a slow pc with a decoder card and play divx stuff if 
you have a fast pc on your network. You can play it off the fast one and 
translate into mpeg1 or 2 streaming over the network. VLC works quite 
well for that. Or just reencode them before playing them.

If you're worried about price, odds are you're better off buying an
ATA controller and a cheap IDE drive.

In the "budget range", there isn't so much a performance advantage --
these days you're paying for the warranty more than anything.

I have a small array of 10K RPM 9GB SCSI's for my homedirs and system
volumes and a huge array of 7200 RPM 120GB ATA's for "nearline" media
storage. Less noisy, too.

I'd like to initialize the drive, but I have no idea where it is in the

Where did my OS stash this information?

Mike,

  Did you look at /proc/devices? How about reading dmesg?

This is a common strategy. I follow the MythTV list and users report great success with PVR-250 and PVR-350 cards. However, you are planning to use an AGP (I assume) video card to display to a computer monitor. This is not exactly the setup that most people use with these high end PVR cards so I'm not sure how successfull you will be on a low powered machine. I have chosen the other approach: Cheap capture card (bt878) and a powerful computer. The reason I chose to do it this way was because I could build a prototype on my existing linux box very inexpensively ($40 for the tuner card) and then upgrade the box for about $350. And if the thing fell flat on it's face after buying the new box, I would still have a powerful box that I could use or unload on eBay.

You could be looking at about the same price to take the approach that I have. Maybe an additional $100 to boost the RAM of a newer machine.

I probably sold you that system :) Remember about a year and a half ago, you picked up a box and two 17" Viewsonics in Beaverton. Then I gave you a ride and we talked about wiki, Ward Cunningham, and cycling.

I think this machine might be too slow for what you intent to use it for. I would try to get at least a 700Mhz box for this. Of course, it can't hurt to try. I first setup my MythTV box on a dual P2/300 with a bt878 tuner card, just to see if I could make it work. Once I got it running I bought a Dell 400sc P4/2.4Ghz 640MB RAM and it smokes.

I currently don't use my myth box to play DVDs because my myth box does not have 5.1 audio out, and I have a kick-ass sound system with a DVD player.

There used be a viewer from LizardTech called MrSid that ran on linux,

I have several genealogical .sid files, who's naming convention is very

I can't understand why not!  I've yet to see a television that has
anything like the clarity and crispness of even a moderate computer
monitor CRT.

I guess we're talking about people who watch lots of broadcast or cable
television... I really just want to display and capture VHS in addition to
playing the hundreds of divx movies I have collected and ten or twelve
DVDs I own.

Ah, no... but it's hooked to one of your old monitors!

That box and one of the monitors was passed on to a friend (happily
running Debian in a non-tech environment, thankyouverymuch).

Good to put the name to the memory.

Well, I was going to get a card with hardware MPEG decoding, but that's
not going to do diddly for the divx.

How was your success with the dual P2/300?  Just asking for a benchmark.

Well, come on... a digital audio output card isn't really much money at
all.

I may end up having to go with the "powerful box, cheap card" approach.
(Realistically, I may have to go with the "pay rent, no box" approach.)

I'm actually kind of thinking that I don't need MythTV.  The features are
very TiVo oriented and I just don't watch television.  I just need simple
capture and playback and have no need to do them simultaneously.

So, let's say I wanted to build something that had some of the design
aspects of the original iMac in that the CRT and computer were in the same
case.  There would be massive electromagnetic interference, right?  Keith?

I want to put a mediocre monitor into an old TV chassis and build a PC in
the back.  There's plenty of room in the case, but a) I'm afraid of
electrocuting myself and b) I fear the whole thing would just burn itself
out.

/proc/net/ip_conntrack lists all tracked connections; wc -l should show
you a total.  I also seem to recall a top-like tool that will monitor
this, but I forget the name.

You want this page:
<URL: http://www.lizardtech.com/download/dl_options.php?page=tools >

I don't know anything about this, but five minutes of Google led me to
believe that if you get the MrSID Info and MrSID Decode utilities (which
may or may not require money to license), you can use some modification of
this script:
<URL: http://www.dlxs.org/products/archive-by-CDROM/11/Dlxsdocs/src/web/d/dlxsdocs/class/image/image-imageprocessing/mkimages >

And do your conversion there.

But it could be easier than that as the script might not be doing anything
too useful for you.

I don't have a system to which I can ssh that's using connection tracking,
but isn't it in /proc/sys/net/ipv4?

Hi,

On a 2.4 kernel, the default BIOS didn't find mine either.  I think 2.6 may
be different. There wasn't much to find six months ago but In a message on
the kernel developersd mail list, someone mentioned setting the drive to
"legacy".  On an Intel D865GBF BIOS, this meant changing the ATA/IDE
Configuration from Enhanced to Legacy and then setting the Legacy IDE
Channel to "SATA P0/P1, PATA Sec" but depending on your BIOS and kernel,
Your Mileage May Vary.  Once it's running correctly, it is very cool..

Cheers,Mike

I watch tv on a decent 17inch flatscreen monitor, positioned on my
coffee table, and its great. Not only do I save the cost of a tv, but
the eyesore and real estate of some huge tv across the room.

Subject: [PLUG] Two tools: unison and lndir
Message-ID: <1082482569.6096.72.camel@denk.nakedape.priv>


I've discovered two new tools that I thought I'd share.  The first is
called 'unison' and it's located at 
http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/.

It's a two-way file synchronizer; if you've ever used rsync to try to
maintain a copy of your home directory between multiple machines, you
know it's not quite cut-out for two-way syncing.  Unison uses some
aspects of the rsync protocol, but has not only two-way support (i.e.,
it shows you if you've got changes in one file direct and not the other,
regardless of which way it is) but also conflict detection, like CVS. 
If you need to maintain multiple copies of files on different systems
(like between a laptop and a fileserver), it's a pretty nice tool.

The second is a very simple tool called 'lndir'.  It ships as part of
the XFree86 source as a way of maintaining multiple source trees with
one set of actual source files (for example, building for multiple archs
when the Makefiles don't support RPATH).  It recreates directory trees
in the destination and populates them with symlinks to files in the
source tree.

Thank you Jeme.

I searched there site no less than five times and I guess I just skimmed

We're currently running Novell Groupwise 6 on a Netware server at work.
I want to replace this with a Linux solution, which would provide email
and calendaring. What solutions do you other Linuxers use? I see on
Novell's site that Groupwise 6.5 runs on a Linux platform, but I'm
having a hard time finding anything more than marketing fluff. Same
goes for SuSE Openexchange server.

It would be really nice to find a package with a migration tool, to
migrate users' email, password, calendar entries and such from
Groupwise to the new system, but this is not a requirement. The ability
to sync with Palms would be a big plus.

Being able to convert them is useful, but do you actually need to do so?
You can get a box to convert S-Video to VGA signals for about $100. There
is one from ViewSonic, the "NexVision". AVerMedia makes the "AVerTV Box".
This allows you to use the monitor as a TV, and if that is the only
requirement such a box might be simplest.

There are definitely some things I have on VHS which I'd love to
distribute digitally.

Yet, I can get a bt8x8 card for $40.

So, what chipset offers the best onboard video and sound?

I'm considering MicroATX (does anybody make flexATX anymore?) for my TV
machine in order to get separation in my TV case, so I'm thinking I might
want to go with an all-in-one solution.  Since this is a media box, I
would imagine upgrading won't be all that necessary for a long time.

I am moving and would like to donate some older computer books and
hardware to a worthly cause. The books are bind, sysadmin, type books
and 3-4 years old.
The hardware is an old 486MB with ram, misc cables, parts and a couple
of matrox 3D only video cards (with one pass-through cable).

Recommendations on a convenient (to downtown portland) location for a
drop-off? 
Does that Saturday workshop accept donations? 

Cheers,
sasha

Nope. No mention of it any where.

/proc/devices is empty (zero file size) Nothing in dmesg, either.

Just to be complete, is the driver for your SATA drive loaded?

On my system (an A7N8X motherboard), the "siimage" module has to be
to use SATA drives.  I'm currently using a 2.6 kernel, but if I
remember correctly the driver for the 2.4 kernel was also siimage.
(The module is derived from the name of the manufacturer of the
SATA chipset used by the a7n8x.)

With the driver loaded, it shows up as /dev/hd*.

Okay, that's helpful. 

They do charge a fee, though and all they'll do is recycle it. I am more
interested finding a home where it would be used.

They aren't on-disk files. Their file size may have no relevance to
their contents whatsoever. Try "cat /proc/devices", &co. instead. If
you are actually booting to a prompt and "cat /proc/devices" returns
absolutely nothing then there is something far more serious wrong with
your setup.

sasha,

  Last time I looked, they charged a fee ($10, I believe) only for monitors.
They recycle the computers by giving them to people who otherwise would not
have one. With linux as the OS. The recipient puts in the equivalent of
sweat equity to earn a box.

They charge for computers older than a Pentium.  And they are
recycled, I think, not given to users.

I have a Dell 5100 running Gentoo.  It's been okay, but I've always had
trouble getting good power management, which is probably a major hurdle
with laptop Linux in general.  Lately I recompiled my kernel, and now if
I leave my lid closed for long enough, the machine shuts off.  Maybe
it's overheating (2.66 GHz), but also, if I close the lid and then
disconnect the power adapter, the monitor's backlight won't come on
again, and I must reboot.

I'm using kernel 2.4.22 with ACPI (not APM), and I've tried 2.6.4, but
it's still really quirky.  I have the latest BIOS firmware, but I don't
think it's quite right still.

But I wouldn't know if this is just Dell or all laptops trying to run
Linux.  (I have XP on this machine as well, and it pains me to see all
the cool power management features, video output features, etc., that my
laptop sports, but which Linux does not yet support.)

Hi,

When you boot the box is there any recognition of the SATA drive in the 
BIOS messages or in the CMOS setup screens?  If the BIOS doesn't see it, 
the OS may not either.

We do NOT charge for computers older than a Pentium. We do NOT charge to
recycle anything except monitors and then only because we have to pay to
have them recycled in an environmentally sound manner.

After all, that's why we are called FREE GEEK.

As per the 486, yes, we would recycle that since our current Freek Boxen
are in the 266-300 MHz range. You can still run ucLinux on the 486 (and
with the 2.6 kernel, non-MMU funcationality is rolled in, but its not
quite soup yet).

So I applaud Sasha's desire to see it reused rather than recycled. It's
certainly in the spirit of Free Geek.

Peace,
-Ron

About a year ago, when I was buying some new SCSI drives, I bought them
off of eBay: Fujitsu MAE3182LPs for about $40.--, IIRC. Not the cutting
edge of technology, but a safe step or back from said sharp point. It also
helped that the mother board in my current computer has 2 built-in SCSI
controllers.

I bet you can find some old 1 to 5 Gig SCSI HDD for $1/GB. Otherwise,
I doubt it. But then, one of the strengths of SCSI is that adding storage
is the same as adding another hard drive: you don't run into the limitations
of 4 devices (at most) per adapter, & you take advantange of the
multi-tasking ability of the SCSI interface.

Which leads to this rule about the practicality of SCSI: that if you are
going to have 5 or more storage devices (CDROM, hard drives, Zip drives,
etc.), then it makes sense to set use SCSI; if you will only have a single
hard drive, DVD/CDROM drive, & maybe one other peripheral, it frankly makes
better sense to stick with IDE.

Um, Ron, x86 processors have had MMUs since i386 (well, I think the 286
had it also, but it's not usable).  You don't need ucLinux for i486;
nearly any regular distro will work.

Unless you go used, there's no touching the price/capacity of ATA drives
right now.  SCSI is less about performance and more about reliability, in
my opinion.

With software RAID (mirroring) it's cheaper to get 2 ATA drives and throw
one out every year than to get SCSI drives.  (Plus you get more capacity.)
Since the drives are redundant, you can be less concerned about how
fragile they are.  ;-)

Used SCSI drives using server-style SCA connectors can be had for $1/GB.

http://www.softwareandstuff.com/h_hd_ST446442W.html

However, the SCA-to-normal adapters add about $10/ea to the drives.

The umask just subtracts permissions for newly created files.  For a
normal file the default permissions are 0666 or rw-rw-rw-.  When you add
in a umask of 0022 you get the following:  666 - 022 = 644 or rw-r--r--.
Umasks are really a simple concept, you just have to remember they are
*subtracting* from the default permissions.  666 for a normal file, 777
for a directory.

Here is a little lesson:

Thanks for the correction, Ron.  I was going from my memory and what
it says on www.freegeek.org, which I read initially that you charge
for pre-Pentium computers.  Rereading it, it only says you ask for a
donation for machines older than a Pentium.  Sorry for my misleading
post.

Glad to hear you don't.  And I heartily agree: reuse it if you can....

There is regognition of the drive in the BIOS, just no mention of it in
the proc dir. I'm researching a driver for it.

Um, I thought I read that SATA drives show up as SCSI drives under 
2.4.  I'm not sure about 2.6, but I'm pretty sure I read this 
recently.

Technically I suppose it probably depends on the specific SATA driver.
(SATA drives typically need their own driver; they don't use the
"normal" ide driver).  If your SATA port uses the SII chipset (like
the a7n8x motherboard), you need the siimage driver loaded, and the
drives show up as /dev/hd* "ide" drives.  This is the same for 2.4
and 2.6.

There might be SATA drivers around for other chipsets that work
differently; I don't know.

The BIOS sees it, and lets me take an option to turn it into a RADI
device.

I'm not finding much when I google the board (ga-7vt600 1394) and look
for a SATA driver.

Any pointers here?

A bit off topic - I just purchased a repairable InFocus LP70
computer projector from Ebay.  1100 Lumen, 1024x768 XGA.  Tiny little
critter, about as big as a medium-sized computer book and weighing
2.4 pounds.   I expect to have it repaired in a week or two, and will
make it available for the May Advanced Topics, I hope.
                                                                                
Even more off topic - the repair would go faster and possibly cheaper
If I could test-swap lamps with another LP70 projector.  Does anybody
have access to one?
                                                                                
More off topic still - Lamps in most computer projectors cost around
$400 these days (they range from $250 to $600 and up).  Most of them
contain a special Philips UHP "burner", a very high tech arc lamp
that runs at 200 atmospheres and 6000C.  There is a place that
refurbs the lamp assemblies with new burners for $200.  Even
more interesting, TI, which makes the DLP moving-mirror display
modulators for the projectors, has a consortium going to standardize
and cost-reduce the lamps, which means cheaper projectors in a year
or two.  So if you can wait a while, you can get a projector that
will make mine look stupid at a fraction of the price.

So, I'm looking at these fancy motherboards with SATA and reading about
the benefits of the change.

Nearly everybody thinks that the cabling change is the #1 greatest thing
in the whole wide world.  That seems weird to me, but isn't really all
that important.

But the great loss as I see it is the decrease in the number of drives.
Nearly all of the layouts I've seen have just 2 SATA connectors.  What the
heck is that?  You can't exactly have a single boot drive AND a RAID array
for storage in the same system without some extra card shoved in there.

Is this temporary?  Why aren't they just lining these things up across
where the IDE interfaces used to be?  You could get like ten of those
things in that space.

I'd imagine it's temporary. Remember that currently, most SATA drives
(and basically all of the models that we mortals can afford) are just
PATA drives with integrated SATA bridges.

Certainly 3ware's latest RAID controllers take great advantage of the
connector density offering a 12-port model in about the same space as
your video card. They cost an arm and a leg, though.

Remember, when you're mass-producing a mainboard, saving 35 cents is
EVERYTHING. (That's not sarcasm.)

But a 486 will be recycled.  I don't know what the current Freek Box is,
but last year it was a Pentium probably 266MHz.

: Remember, when you're mass-producing a mainboard, saving 35 cents is
: EVERYTHING. (That's not sarcasm.)

The big boys have 'Walmart'-ed the price of the 7-pin SATA to about 6 cents a 
pop, for ga-jillion quantity orders.

However, just as SATA took the wind out of the sails of an emerging cable 
technology called Infiniband 1X, (the jury is still out on Infiniband 4x and 
12x) the new 29-pin SAS (Serial Attached SCSI) might chew through SATA before 
SATA really gets super-popular in the consumer market (say, like USB or 1394 
Firewire.)

SAS receptacles are backward compatible with SATA, because the only difference 
is that the long power and the short signal 'eyebrows' are connected into one 
long bar that has two tabs below. The space between the 'eyebrows' holds two 
more differential pairs (and grounding contacts.) So technically that should 
provide twice the data readout as SATA. Eventually.
And SATA 3.0 is supposed to go to what, 6Gb/s?

Message-ID: <40867D7D.4040905@bejay.com>

I'm running Slackware 9.1 and KDE 3.2. I have a Visor that I sync to 
Avantgo every morning. The problem I have is that KPilot doesn't seem to 
  have a conduit for Avantgo (I believe it's called malsync). Anyone 
know where to get this so I can stop using Windows every morning just to 
sync my Visor?

Barbara,

  I've been using jpilot for years. It works perfectly on both Red Hat
6.x-7.3+ and Slackware-8.1-9.1. Get the Slackware package for 0.99.7 on
http://www.jpilot.org. It works with all Palm Pilots, Handsprings and I
don't know what else. BTW, we use only Xfce, but I understand that jpilot
works with all desktop/window managers.

Barbara,

  I'll confess that I have no idea what is Avantgo. What I do know is that
jpilot is the interface between pilot-link and us. pilot-link comes with
every distribution; I think it's up to ... well, I forget now but I have
0.11.7 installed here on the RH 7.3 box.

  Try 'locate pilot-link'. If it's not there, grab either a Slackware
package at the pilot-link Web site (indirectly via jpilot, too) or the
source tarball.

HTH,

Rich

When you display the compressed video on a computer monitor, rather than through the TV out on the card, does the video decompress using hardware or software? I'm not sure, and that's why I don't know if this difference would result in a performance hit. Can anyone clarify this for me?

With the low end tuner card (no hardware compression), I got about 1 frame per 3-4 seconds. Piss poor performance, but it did work, and that's all I needed to know. Of course, that was watching live TV (compressing and decompressing simultaniously). And the video card in that box has about 4MB RAM, which would contribute to the poor perfomance greatly. It would have probably done much better with a PVR-250. Even a descent video card would have made a big difference.

I would say, skip the MythTV unless you want Tivo functionality. If you don't need simultanious capture and playback you can get by with a lot less in terms of hardware. I have no idea about divx. If you are just capturing video from VHS tapes and don't need the tuner for TV, you might consider getting a hardware motion JPEG capture card, like the old Miro DC10 or Iomega Buz card. I just saw a Buz card on eBay for $5.

Avantgo is a conduit used to sync things like news and wepages, AFAIK. 
It's one of those Windows conduits.

As far as I know, there isn't currently a way to use such things... I
don't think you can use such conduits as the AOL ones, either, for
instance.  jpilot doesn't, as far as I know, support them.

You may have luck running the Windows sync software under Wine... I
really don't know.

It's been a few years since I've pulled out and sync'd my palm pilot. 
It is really really old.  I haven't purchased a new one for the simple
matter of so many conduits I would wish to use require Windows.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0404210959320.10977-100000@uplinknetworks.dyndns.org>

Let's say you have a web server at location A.  You also have a
mirror copy of the server at location B.  If server A goes down or the
connection to A is lost, what methods have people used to redirect all
traffic to server B?  What products have people used to accomplish this?
I suppose I could use a box running IPTables to do DNAT/SNAT to redirect
the traffic to the remote location, but that's assuming that the
connection to location A is available.  I guess the only option left would
be DNS and perhaps configuring the primary DNS server so that other
servers only cache the IP address for a short period of time?

A virtual penny for your thoughts...
Thanks,

I /dev/null'd Avantgo when I got my Tapwave Zodiac (runs Palm OS 5.2).
Check out Plucker...

http://plkr.org/

    "Plucker is an offline Web and e-book viewer for Palm OS(r) based
    handheld devices and PDAs and comes with Unix, Linux Windows and Mac
    OSX tools, scripts, and conduits that let you decide exactly what
    part of the World Wide Web you'd like to download onto your PDA (as
    long as they're in standard HTML or text format). These web pages
    are then processed, compressed, and transferred to the PDA for
    viewing by the Plucker viewer.

    Plucker supports many features, including clickable images (pan and
    zoom), italic, narrow, and HiRes fonts, multiple concurrent
    databases, configurable display parameters and stylus options
    (gestures and hardware button navigation) ZLib and DOC compression,
    Perl and Python conduits and parsers, a Windows fully-integrated
    installer, and a whole lot more!"

The latest CVS snapshot of the Palm client has DIA (silk) support. There
is a very active community of open source advocates supporting this fine
project.

hth,
Sandy

The original post had the clue everybody should've been looking for:
"malsync". I've synced with AvantGo for Palm under Linux many
times. Only ever using the command line, though. "apt-cache search
malsync" turns up this jpilot plugin:

http://jasonday.home.att.net/code/syncmal/

Untested by me, of course, as I don't use jpilot.

Yeah, the best way to do this is pretty simple, just create multiple ADDRESS
records for the fqdn and all clients should be able to get to the site if
one of the servers goes down. The tricky part could be making sure your DNS
is still up. Assuming you have offsite DNS that you are confident is
reliable, you shouldn't have any problems.

Before you run right out and buy one of these, you better check your
case to see if it will fit. The last 47 Gb I gave away. It measured
3.75 inches tall by 5 inches wide by 6.5 inches long( IIRC)
much too large for any standard case and not useful enough for my two
server cases. I'm looking and in the market for 9-18Gb SCA drives that
are standard size. I need 6 to 8 to replace some ailing 4Gb drives I
have in the server. I'm presently running Redhat 7.2 on it now, but
would like to get SuSE on it this Summer sometime. How Many drives do
you need?

Oops, sorry Steve, I failed to follow the link Home. They are
advertising some nice SCA drives on a different link.

My bad.
Thanks for the link Steve, this may be where I get my replacement
drives. Anyone there need to know you referred ?

In other words, a standard 5.25" full height drive. For comparison, a 
5.25" floppy drive is usually 1/2 height.

By standard, I assume you mean, 3.5", 1/3 height (1") drive? Or do you 
mean 3.5", 1/2 height (1.5")? Both sizes are quite common at this point. 
A 3.5" floppy drive is usually 1/3 height.

Drives come in various form factors, and have for years.

My very first hard drive was 5.25", full height, and had a whole 7 megs 
of storage space.

Yes... I said 7 megabytes.

Hah! You had a big one. Back In The Day (around 1980), when I was Tech
Support Mgr at the Byte Shop, North Star was the first (IIRC) to ship a
5.25" hard drive with 5 MB. They also had a 17 MB drive that weighed
about 50 lbs and if it lost power without being shut down properly,
would retract its heads while a capaciter discharged and wiped a nice
spiral over the disk.

Ahhh, those were the days.

The GUI way is to find the Desktop Switching Tool, probably under 
System tools in the menu.

The nerdy way is to change upir ~/.Xclients-default to say

exec startkde


(Even nerdier is to put this in your ~/.Xclients, instead of the 
stuff that RH put there.)

In the GNOME menu under what should be titled System Settings or System

to choose the default desktop.

Well, you are older than I... :p

I had my drive around 1988. It was designed for a Pet computer, and was 
hooked to my Commodore 128.

My first PC had a full height 5.25", 40 mb drive that supposedly

A couple complications with that...  First off, DNS is handled by the
domain registrar and there's not a way to modify the TTL through their
web-management interface.  I'll have to contact them and see if they'll
let me modify the TTL value, or else host DNS myself.
Secondly, the data on A gets pushed to B using rsync each night.  So
Round-robin would cause inconsistencies for users, particularly if they're
using webmail on server A and they see the mail for today and the next
time they login and get server B then the mail is not there yet.
It would be nice if you could set a priority for A records like you can
for MX records (maybe there's a way that I'm not yet aware of).
Also, I'm not sure that setting a really low TTL would always fix this
because of caching, unless the TTL was 0, which would significantly
increase the load on the DNS servers.

Bill,
In the GNOME menu under what should be titled System Settings or System
Tools will be a tool called "Desktop Switching Tool" It will allow you
to choose the default desktop.

This may be useless;  it may be The Next Thing.  This looks like
a redesigned (and possibly more functional) WINE.  Worth a look:

Hey, I had one of those massive 40MB hard drives- until something wonky 
happened to it, and when I took it to some computer place in Eugene (this was
 about 1987/1988 when I was off at school) they told me I had hooked up the 
cables backwards (? No I dunno either) and I needed to replace the drive 
because it was dead. So about three hundred financial aid dollars later, I 
was the proud owner of a new twenty MB hard drive...

Matt,

All these points that you make are correct.  Some DNS will ignore the
value if it is really low.  As for a way to resolve your problem..

Currently the only way is at the ISP level.  To have your hosting
service have redunted connections for ISP and power.  You can then run
a load balancer with multiple servers behind the one IP.  DNS doesn't
have a similar information for other protocols like it has for MX.  It
has been proposed and may happen one day but not currently available. 
Something that would be nice for all people without lots of money. 
:-)

So just had the power go out here.  Nothing lost, but thought it would be
prudent to look for a UPS that will interface with Linux to inform the
machine that power is going out in 5 minutes or whatever and gracefully
shut down.
Any recommendations?
Thanks!

This won't provide fail-over, it will be more like load balancing.  Half
the people will still get A's ip address, whether or not A is able to do
anything with it.

This looks like the device.  The 2.6.4 kernel does support it, but the
kernel help doesn't say what the name of the module is.  The SATA
support is a sub-menu of SCSI devices.  You may need to do a custom
compile to make it functional.  Since you have IDE controllers for four
devices, look for the SATA drive(s) to be hde or hdf.

Good Luck,

I was very disappointed to find out that the Advanced Topics Meeting was
last night. I guess I wasn't the only one as a waitress at Jax mentioned I
was the 5th person to show up for the meeting. I was *really* looking
forward to hearing about Template Toolkit.

I had a wrong date on the first announcement.  i corrected it as soon as
it was noticed.  (Within the half hour.)  The followup announcement had
the correct date, as did the web site.

Having it on Thursday was a one time thing due to St. Patrick's Amateur
Drinking Holiday.

It's nice to be vaguely popular. :)

Honestly, the reason that I offered this short talk is that I was in
the middle of writing a three-part article based on that slide set, so
the material was fresh in my mind.  The first two of three parts are
available at:

        http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/col60.html
        http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/col61.html

Because I'm not permitted to "publish" the articles until they've
appeared in the magazine, you won't be able to view the content
directly for a few more months.  But you can add "?arrgh=plug"
to the end of those URLs for a "preview" of what will go live.

Percy,

  We're not the PDX lugs, but I'll try responding anyway.

  Your message is ambiguous. Are you looking for the Java Runtime
Environment so you can use applications written in java? Are you looking for
the java Software Development Kit so you can write applications in java? Do
you want an Integrated Development Environment for designing and writing
java applications?

  The JRE should be on your distribution cdrom. The SDK can be downloaded
from Sun's Web site. If you want to use an IDE to develop code, check out
http://www.eclipse.org.

Subject: [PLUG] Training corpus for bayesian spamassassin
Message-ID: <20040423170534.GA18539@gate.kl-ic.com>

I'm looking for opinions about "selected training" for bayesian
spamassassin.

I am transitioning from bogofilter to spamassassin;  poor old bogo 
is having trouble with the spammers addition of random filler words,
and about 50% of spam was making it through (with admittedly high
thresholds to minimize false positives).  

I have a corpus of about 22K saved spams (since 2003 Aug), and about
110K saved hams (good GAWD I've read a lot of email since 1975).  
Estimated accuracy after some careful cleaning is 0.02% misclassification.
Training with all those through a spam filter creates an enormous
database, which makes mail processing and retraining rather slow.
A recent subset, or a selected subset, makes a lot more sense.

It is superficially plausible to train the bayesian filter on
spamassassin with just the misclassified false positives and
false negatives.  For the last week or so, I have been running 
spamassassin with the bayesian filter and training turned off,
to see what kinds of mistakes it makes with the heuristic rules.
It seems to pass about 30% of the spam (false negative) and trap
about 5% (false positive!!) of the ham, with the threshold set
to 3.0 and a whole bunch of addresses whitelisted.   I will have
quite a few false-negative spams before long (sigh), and I can
build a modest ham training list by including some of the recent
"squeakers".  The result should be a tolerably sized bayes_toks file.

Does this "selected subset" training approach make sense, or have I
got my head so thoroughly wedged up my behind that oxygen is not
getting through?

Message-ID: <BAY9-F63CGeyIfEFexr0004e8a1@hotmail.com>

Dear All:

I am trying to unzip a package.  Apparently, it contains a file that is 
pretty big
and when I issue unzip, I was able to retrieve all but one file.  And for 
that
file, I got this message:

     need PK compat. v4.5 (can do v2.1)

Did a search on google, and found that I can get the source
and recompile with

       -DLARGEFILE_SOURCE
       -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64

And I did so.  But still come across the same problem.
Any sunggestion how I can unzip the entire package?

thanks

I think it's sufficient start with a base of 200 or so of spam
messages and a similar number of ham. The spam messages ought to be
recent, because their content has changed considerably even since last
summer.

It's always good to feed the false negatives and, especially, the
false positives to the bayesian db -- but I'd also make sure it got a
reasonable diet of standard spam and ham as well.

A threshold setting of 3.0 seems a bit low to me, but I haven't done
much testing with a setting that low.

After that, I'd feed any spam that didn't get BAYES_99 tag back to the
bayesian database. It doesn't really matter whether or not
SpamAssassin caught it correctly the first time.

Why?

My goal is that all spam should get BAYES_99 so that only content --
not mail headers, sender address, or whatever -- is used to identify
spam. That's not to say the other indicators aren't helpful, but to my
mind the goal is to classify messages based on content as much as
possible.

Is the 3.0 the threshold for marking as spam or ham?  3.0 is really low
for spam; I use 6.3 and rarely get any false positives that aren't
newsletters or things like that.

I am looking for the opposite.  A UPS that linux can tell to shut down,
and restart.

I have a remote machine that is locking up.  I want to be able to shut
power down for 5 minutes, and then power back up.  The power supplies
have a timeout reset on them, so flicking it on and off will not
work....

Any ideas?  I would prefer not spend $600 on a remote power strip.  I am
thinking more like 30-60 for a UPS.

Its the whole, turning it back on I am grappling with.

Of course Paul is completely wrong here, so ignore him.

If you look at the gdm log in screen, you can often just switch at the
screen.

Of course you have to have the kde rpms install, but that is trivial. 
There is a site to assist if you need any newer packages:

Zot,

  Would this be the Naval Post-Grad School in Monterey, CA or Monterey,

There is also an application called "switchdesk" that will let you change 
from Gnome to kde.

It will be called "switchdesk" or "switchdesk-gnome" or "switchdesk-kde".

I had a similar problem, a DSL modem that goes on the blink every week
or so and can only be fixed by power cycling (which, says Qwest, does
not make it faulty.)  It always happens when I've just started a long
trip.  For $9 I got a cheap mechanical timer from Radio Shack that
I've set up to turn the thing off and on again in the wee hours of
every morning.

A more sophisticated, and expensive, solution would be to get X-10
gear and power-cycle only when there's no connection to the modem.  That
may be the direction you want to look.

Is there a way of doing this in the Windows world?

I would expect it would be a varient on a watchdog card or some other 
hardware modification.  (Or maybe an eggtimer and a monkey.)

The only way I can see this being done is with a motherboard that 
understands power on signals from a keyboard or USB device and an 
attachment on the ups that is able to generate that power on signal at 
some interval.

I have not heard of such a beast, but that does not mean it does not 
exist.

Look in the kernel config for the list of brands of watchdog cards.  
Thinking about it, these should solve the problem.  (Unless it is a 
laptop.)

The real problem is that you still are relying on getting to one IP. 
No matter how you set up load balancers or other information.

Ultimately it would be nice to be able to configure in DNS (which gets
cached on all clients) two or more locations to find the HTTP server.

This would allow you to have multiple servers located at different
sites and perhaps even have smart IP routing to the fastest server. 
The advantage of DNS having multiple MX records is the kind of
redundantcy for the other IP protocols that would benefit the user.

Since there is no such service today, the best you can do is to host
at a site that is doing reduntant ISP and power.

I'm not sure I fully understand your question, but I'll give it a try.

Some BIOSs have an option for what to do when power is restored. If you
tell it to always boot when power is restored, then all you have to do
is cut the power and then restore it and the machine will boot.

Aha!  So it is actually the perfidious Canucks!  I say we attack! 
Haven't had a decent, civilized war against English speakers for

P.S. I'll lead the attack on Toronto - lots of nice restaurants with WIFI,
handy for lunch breaks.  I don't know who will want to attack Montreal,
I found their English very hard to understand ...

We talked and agreed that 9AM was a little too early for a Saturday. It
would also make for too long a day (9 hours!)  Would 11 AM work? We could
continue helping people with Wifi for the rest of the Clinic - that would
give us a 6 hour session.

Riverdale does not yet have wifi, but it sounds like Paul is working on
it. We can always turn it off if the PersonalTelco people have a better
solution.

I think May 15 is a reasonable target. The fact that it will coincide with
our monthly session helps.

Well, what we generally do is work with the equipment people have (no
promises if it's cheapo or unsupported stuff). If we are keeping to that
model, then participants will need to bring their computer, wifi card, and
WAP. We will probably need to do some coordination regarding frequencies,
so we can verify that everything works.

My personal feeling is that it would be best to focus on getting people
started. You're probably right that the other issues are a little too
much.

I have snipped out the rest of the message - all of which was good, but
not anything I need to comment on.

Do you want to put up a web page about this on personaltelco.net? Google
seems to love your wikki! Let me know if you can't and we will put one
together.

It seems like we should have information up on personaltelco, pdxlinux,
and mwvlug (the Salem Linux group). Can anyone think of other places? It
would be nice if we had a flyer to post in cafes that have hot spots. Any
volunteers to make one up?

Have you considered a watchdog timer board?  These run around $100, IIRC,
and will do a hard reset of the machine if they are not tickled by code
every so often.  I was having problems with a machine back in my BSDI
days, I got a such a card, wrote a BSDI driver based on the supplied Linux
driver,  and it worked!  When the machine went zombie and stopped tickling
the watchdog board, it would wait 30 seconds and then do a hard reset.

Turned out to be better to replace the flakey machine, though.  I think
I still have the old ISA card around someplace.

In any case, these cards come simple or complex, PCI or ISA, sometimes
with additional connections for switching an external relay on and off,
or activating when the phone rings and the modem doesn't answer.  Lots
of nifty options.  

Another alternative would be to temporarily attach a second linux box
with a signal from the parallel port controlling a 5V relay.  You could
have two machines control each other this way.  Finally, a task slow
enough to run on a 386-12 machine!  That's 0.012 GHz for all you young
people.  :-)

Here's a supported card list with comments:

Yikes!  Why?  The tourists killed it.  It's like Aspen but worse.  If
you want a really neat mountain town, try Lake Louise, AB.  Alberta
has something in common with Oregon, too:  No PST.  You still have to
pay GST, but 7% beats the combined 14% you get in BC.

>   Who wants Winnipeg? Ottawa?

Edmonton's nice.  It's getting nice and warm without getting hot.  Too
bad rail fare over the continental divide is so expensive.  Though
with gas prices being what they are north of the border right now
(averaging the equivalent of US$2.18/US gallon[1]), it could be
cheaper to hop on VIARail...


[1] I've seen gas sold in CAN$/liter and CAN$/British gallon in Canada.

Two not-so-hackish fixes would be (a) new hardware (power supply most likely,
motherboard second) or (b) watchdog card.

For the hackish UPS fix, you'll want an APC SmartUPS, since it has
a signalling protocol that can do what you want.  UPSes with "dumb"
signalling (e.g. APC BackUPS) can just monitor the UPS state, not change
it.

And then you'll need something to give you access to the serial port on
the UPS.  A modem could be made to work, if you can spare a phone line.
A second computer or terminal server would work, if it could be given
its own IP address, and secured.  

There are also overpriced appliances from Black Box, Pulizzi and others
that can do this stuff.

My experience has been that it *always* pays to just swap-out the whole
box.  The customer appreciates a quick and certain solution, diagnosis
is easier and the bad system generally gets worse as time goes on.
Whole systems are *cheap*.

I'd be interested in finding out. :) Actually, my thought here was that
people who use WiFi in cafes have the equipment and an interest in
wireless acess. Maybe some of them have considered trying Linux but didn't

I can attend and maybe provide hardware.  My knowledge is slight.

I have a linksys WAP11 802.11b that I could bring along for the good of 
the order.

I was looking forward to working on getting my IBM T21 with Linksys 
WPC11 ver.3 up and going but it started up without a hitch and found the 
WAP at my son's house just fine.

I'm going to have a couple of other stupid questions to work on however.

Let me know if this will help.

Subject: [PLUG] Using a dangerous mail network...
Message-ID: <408C88E1.2020402@robinson-west.com>

The suggestion to install a one way router serving a secondary private
network with a mailserver in it for untrusted mail sources has been
suggested.  The thought is, have an outside mail server route mail
either to the normal mailhub or the dirty mail mailhub based on what
senders the intended recipient trusts.  

I wonder if I should run spamassassin on both mail servers?  It's
preferable to be able to read a message that gets routed to the dirty
mail site, if it's important.  The dirty mail mail server faces a higher
probability of infection than the normal mail server which will only
get touched by trusted sources.

Do I need to worry about the smtp software itself getting infected?  
Is it fairly safe to use pine on the untrusted mail site from the
standpoint of infection?

If I'm not signed up for mailing list xyz, I wonder whether or not
mail can be routed from it to me and how much I should worry
about potentially sending a sender subscription request out to
xyz?  This clearly isn't what I want to do since informing a
mailing list that noone is subscribed to about getting messages
off of it doesn't help matters.
 
Sender subscription would cut out computer generated and anonymous
stuff.  Where many mailing sources don't care whether or not you want
their stuff and you're talking hundreds of attempted sends a day from
such sources, how much concern about missing out is really merited?  

The talk tonight was about AOL's black hole behavior for certain
sites they don't trust.  AOL doesn't ever bounce from certain
sources, AOL apparently just accepts and then trashes.  The smtp
protocol would be better if  notification via a return email had
always been part of the design so that the sender can know
what the recipient decided to do.

The bad news I've thought of so far...

    1)  Valid email can have unresolvable source or destination
         addresses.

    2) With this is mind, a spammer can use many unresolvable names
         since they figure you won't block mail from unresolvable sites
         because of 1.

    3) The received from ip could be from an open relay or a server that
         won't accept a notification message on what your server does with
         it's message...

         3a)  If it's an infected computer, sending a message to it is 
strange.

         3b)  If the source is a mailing list, sending a notification 
message is
                rude.

     4) There are some untrusted sites that should be black holed, but what
          if a site is bad for a while and then isn't anymore later?

     5)  The dirty mail site may periodically get important email which
           might not be seen if it gets infected.
     
     6)  It's logical to use a cheap computer for the dirty mail site which
          won't in all likelihood please the local users...

           6a) It's another computer, this means more power.

           6b) Remote access is too dangerous, this is a dirty mail mail
                 site after all.

     7) How much mail should be held from an untrusted source?  If
          it's an important sender, I guess the  first message will have to
          be good enough.

          7a)  Less junk on hard disk is good, but filling the routing 
server's
                 ram based spool in the event of a dirty mail site 
outage isn't
                 good.  I'd much rather hold on to trusted mail.

          7b)  No bounce may mean that a new valid sender doesn't know
                  they didn't get through where local users may not know
                  either if there's no dirty site or the routing server 
has filled
                  up and can't hold any more untrusted mail.

     8) This approach doesn't help with infected trusted sources.

     9)  Once email goes to the dirty site, moving it to the clean site
           isn't safe.  A lot of valid mail could go there where the dirty
           mail site is protocol sealed from the outside world.

The biggest thing is when to bounce mail and where to bounce to
so that senders can know they didn't get in even if the routing mail
server fills up.

sounds like you are either running it out of inet and as a separate
daemon, or that there is already a process running and you are trying to
start it again.

Is this lab a new thing, or has it been there a while?

The problem is that this server is still in Oregon and I am not.  Adding
boards is difficult, but unplugging is easy :)

The syustem is a dell power edge, so I wonder if it has a watchdog built
in.

Well that is what I was looking for this weekend.  I remember these from
10-15 years ago and they were $30-70 to connect to a modem.  Now I am
seeing them for $160-250

What I am now wondering is the UPS.  I have found I can shut off a UPS
via a serial command.  What I do not know is what happens next.  The
Dell requires that I power off for 5-10 minutes, there's a "protective"
delay on the power supplies.  If I tell a UPS to power down, what
happens?  Does it power down until I tell it to power up?  Does it power
down until line power is back on?  In this case line power is already
on...

I was hoping for a solution in the $30 range.  I could grab a relay,
attached to a parallel port, then to a sock, and put it all in a
junction box and ship it, but that sounds a bit iffy to rely remotely.

One thing that is really odd about Slidell, LA is the number of Donut
Shops.  I pass 5-9 donuts shops in a 5 mile drive to work.  One of them
is call "Not Just Donuts."  I assume they sell coffee too.  They tend to
be interspersed with the Daiquiri shops (some drive through) and the
Sno-Ball stands (more common than Starbucks in Lake Oswego).

Location location location.  The box is a Dell Power Edge, so replacing
hardware is not easy, and I am not assured its not something in Linux.

I have other computers nearby.  My problem is that I do not understand
what happens to a UPS when I say "power down."  Does it wait "Power UP"
or for line power to return to the unit.  What if line power is already
on?

Overpriced is right.  Remember when Black was cool *and* cheap?

Well if I could time to go when the server failed, I'd be good.

Maybe a timer with snooze that I link to a parallel line that the server
snoozes every 8.9 minutes :)

I have X10 gear running elsewhere at this location, and it is a bit
flaky.  I fear spurious X10 commands will shut off the server.  There
are lights that do that already.

    I have the CD ISOs for Mandrake 10.0 community. I am able to mount the
ISOs to a directory. Here is what I want to do. I want to be able to burn
them to a DVD and then boot from the DVD into the install.
 
    I know how to burn on to a DVD using KDE however I'm not so naive as to
think I can just burn the files to a DVD and expect it to work. Is there
anything I have to do to make it (the DVD itself,) bootable?

Back in the 80's and early 90's BB took other people's products and
re-branded to their own.  I remember you could buy fluke meters for
40-70% of the list price, much like no-name tires.

Then as much of the tech got commoditized, BB was the only place to get
rock solid equipment that was out of favor (modem with call back form
instance).

If I understand what you want to do, you will need to mount all of the
ISO images, then copy the contents to a new directory and make a new ISO
image for the DVD size.  When you make the new ISO image, you will need
to specify the location of the boot image file from the bootable CD ISO
image.  I don't have any experience with the KDE burning tool, but I
know that gcombust will do everything but mount the ISO images.  The man
page for mkisofs has all of the details, including how to specify the
boot scheme.

Good Luck,

Do you know what protocol it is?

CommView covers a number of protocols, but I didn't see anything at first 
glance not covered by recient versions of Ethereal.

Knowing what it is we are trying to find would be a big help...

Rod,

  Ethereal or tcpdump will catch packets for you. If you store them in a
file the more experienced here can help you to interpret them.

Oddly, I just stumbled across this completely unintentionally:

Doesn't say anything about 5 minute delays or remote control, but
thought I'd post it nonetheless.

I just got a virus-bounce from drizzle, with the words:

Can we have this bouncing disabled? Since I don't run Windoze,
it's unlikely that I was the real source. And it's common knowledge
that most  viruses contain forged addresses anyway. This sort of
thing just adds pointless traffic to the Internet.

Additionally, since they are both libpcap based, you can use tcpdump
to capture packets remotely, say from within an ssh session or a cron
job, and save the results to a file. Then you can bring the file into
a local workstation and use Ethereal to analyze the traffic visually
postmortem.

Just run ethereal for 20 mintues on any network.

It should be real easy to understand.

The trick is filters.  The capture filters use the tcpdump language
(host www.cnn.com and not port 22), whereas the filters use the display
language (roughly ip.addr == 212.212.212.212 and tcp.port != 22).  Use
the GUI to build the display filters.

Make great use of sorting by clicking columns, display filters on IP,
port and protocol.

Always set it to update and scroll on update when you capture.  You can
turn these off live, but sometime you cannot turn them on.

Also if your capture file is huge, you can pre-filter with the tcpdump
lingo on load "ethereal -r file host www.cnn.com"  This can save lots of
memory.

It still seems like X10 is a good solution. Your server apparently
already goes off for spurious reasons so a few more caused by the X10
shouldn't matter and you might be able to change channels and get rid
of the X10 problems. The machine controlling the X10 could also double
as the monitor for the server.

Also note that if you're on a switched ethernet network (and most
ethernets are these days), you will only be able to sniff broadcast
traffic, and multicast and unicast traffic that is destined for the
specific MAC that the switch sees on the port your sniffer is plugged
in to.

If you want to see _all_ the traffic on a given network, you'll need
(someone) to configure a monitoring port. In the Cisco world this would
be done with "port monitor" or "monitor session" commands, depending on
the specific platform.

My attempt "find . -mtime -179 -ls -exec ls -ltr {} \;" does not sort.

Seems to me like this should work.  Can some offer a helpful hint?

Michael,

ls -ltr will sort by date/time. However, in this case you are calling ls -ltr on each file that you are finding, individually, and therefore loosing the context by which the sorting would occur.

find . -mtime -179 | xargs ls -l --sort=time 

...will work better.

Admittedly, it's not a perfect solution.  If the list of files is too
long, xargs will deliver it in chunks to ls.

Also one could get a summary of the captured packets file by using it with

Use the '-printf' option to 'find' generate a listing of 'YYYYMMDD
filename\n' and pipe through 'sort -n'.

e.g.:

$ find . -mtime 179 -printf '%AY%Am%Ad %p\n' |sort -n

If you want more fields than the date and filename, you can include
them.

Yes we are a new group.  We started down the path back in October with
significant investment by the OSU community, the administration, and a
number of other groups of campus.  We have also seen significant
interest from just about every group on campus (colleges, research
centers, etc) for the Open Source Lab.

The research program will really have two main "arms."  The first arm
will be infrastructure and hosting.  This includes data-center
management, support, hosting, and development for open source projects. 
We are already a huge mirror for various open source projects (we are
pumping out about 1.3 TB every day).  On top of that, we have
specialized infrastructure for a number of projects including Gentoo,
Debian, Ark Linux, Mozilla, Freenode, etc.  Our purpose here is to
create a strong community and backbone for Open Source projects seeking
a home.  We've got good infrastructure and big pipes, and helping these
projects is good for the community, and good for OSU.  We also host a
wiki and bugs space for open source projects, mail lists, all that sort
of thing.

The second "arm" of the Open Source Lab will be development.  We will
engage in research and development of open source projects, tools, and
processes that are useful in education, research and outreach.  These
are the goals of OSU, and since we are an OSU institution, they are our
goals as well. :)  We are seeking to help OSU processes, engineering and
research using open source.  You can find out some more on the web site
and here http://osuosl.org/about/mission/

If you have any questions please let me (operations manager) or Scott
Kveton (Program Director) know; we are happy to answer them.  We are
very excited for this opportunity.  OSU is the first university in the
US and maybe the world to approve of and build an Open Source research
institution.  Any insight, advice, comments, or questions from the Open
Source community are very valuable to us, so let us know!

Tried yesterday but couldn't get to the site.  I'll try again today.  I 
want better monitoring than waiting for problem reports and then starting 
up some lame-ass Windows program and click and click and click until it's 
found.

A thanks to all for the suggestions.  I haven't got ethereal -- or any
other monitoring software -- up and running the way I want it/them to but
we did find the problem site.  Some computer at a university in Romania
was doing a flood of scans against port 80 (DOS).  Turns out the Tech
Manager got it _late_ last night, blocked it in the router, then fell
asleep on the keyboard and didn't save the settings.  I refound it this
AM using netwatch and we discovered the missing save.  FWIW the offending
system is med.pub.ro at 141.85.0.71.

Again thanks to all for the suggestions.

I've come to believe my life could use some organization.

I once had a Palm device.  Still got it, somewhere.  Never remembered to
sync it and it didn't have an alarm mechanism that actually made itself an
unavoidable part of my life.  (There is just one catch, Catch 22:  You
have to remember to check your reminders.)

So, what do y'all use for calendar management?

I'd like to use something that has many different ways of accessing the
data... something with a command-line interface that is scriptable and
hence, likely has a web interface available and can send me email notices
as well as firing off at jobs and the like.  No, I don't want to write one
using perl and at (or just POE).

Anything stand out as the tried-and-true old stand-by?

We used to use ical, but web searches for that thing seem to only turn up
iCal for OSX.

It appears to be no longer supported.  The protocol lives on in iCal for 
OS X, Mozilla's calendar, KDE's PIM, Evolution, and a few others.

I use Evolution at the moment for some things.  I have no firm precident 
yet. I need to set up the webdav components to allow me to use the 
calendar in multiple places.

I would also like to set up an iCal reminder calendar for PLUG.

  I use the Kyocera combo cell phone/PalmPilot. For me, it's the ideal
solution. My fiancee uses a Handspring Visor Pro. We're each on our third
one (she wears 'em out, I just upgrade). Both of us use jpilot on the
desktop. It's a GUI, but you can always use plain, ol' pilot-link and do the
rest manually.

  The Handspring Visor Pro will associate the to-do list with the calendar
and will roll undone items to the next day. I use datebk5 on my PDA for the
same thing.

  There are certainly more modern models out there. For my business, I
really appreciate the combination of a cell phone and PDA. Every one of my
1,000+ numbers (work, cellular, home, etc.) is callable without having to
manually enter them into the cell phone. Regardless of which model you get
you'll soon become dependent on it.

I don't intend to be a smart-ass; but, there's really only 1 trick
to calendar management, regardless of the technology.  Every morning
(or any other time of day... as long as it's the same time each day)
go over the things you have to do that day and the next few days.

So, for example, I use Gnome Calendar.  It does things like throws
up dialog boxes and emails me etc.  But, all that is totally useless
if I don't spend about 15 minutes each day gathering my thoughts about
what should be done that day and over the next few days.

If you spend that 15 minutes, any technology will suffice, including
a little spiral notebook, a wad of sticky notes in your pocket, or 
notes written on your arm.

Oh, and if you, for some reason, simply cannot discipline yourself to
take that 15 minutes each day, then your life doesn't need organizing.
[grin]  You'd be better off winging it.

The editor's at LWN recently evaluated a number of options.
This was motivated by their dispair over ical's neglect.

Au contraire!  Organization is what got us the 40 hour week!
Organization is exactly what the grey-suited corporate types fear most!

Yeah, I think I need something that will email me and fire off whistles
and sparks when I want to hear whistles and see sparks.  I have a PalmVx
(in a Rhinoskin case, Alan), but it doesn't bite me when I need to pay
attention to it.

Glen's comments are well-noted, sure, but I still need some other kind of
reminder to take that 15 minutes.  An email would do it.  It's not that
tough.

But I'll also need something accessible from everywhere and hopefully
something that can import and export events from other locations.

The ical protocol looks perfect.  I guess I need to set up a proper ical
server with authentication and some kind of mechanism to sync with remote
calendars?

I'll probably end up using a web/email interface exclusively.

I tried out a bunch of possibilities, including Evolution and Korganizer.
In the end, however, I decided to use the Emacs calender.  It's not as
pretty as some of the others, and lacks some of their bells and whistles,
but it meets my needs.

An added advantage is that I can rsync my diary up to my mail server
and access it from the outside world, even from a (gasp!) windows box.

My scheduler is vi.  Emacs will do in a pinch.

For the last 20 years or so, I have carried a one-page "to-do" list
on a standard sheet of paper, printed out from an ASCII file.  I keep
the paper in a pocket.  On this list are:

lines 1-2:  My own critical contact information.  Who to call if I croak.
lines 3-4: Must do now only stuff.
lines 5~20: Next month of scheduled events, flights, motels, car rental, etc.
lines 20~25: Noncritical things to do.
lines 26~62:  Some phone numbers, addresses, other info
lines 63-65:  Books to buy or from library.
margins and back:  Handwritten notes for new stuff.

I rewrite the page and print it about every two days.  On trips it gets
very marked up.  Some noncritical things disappear.

When I print a new one, the old one goes into a file.  I have a foot thick
stack of old papers live in a filing cabinet.  Good place to look for old
phone numbers, etc.  This is the real value of the paper system, as most
PIM software doesn't keep old snapshots, and just accumulates data forever.
Too much data makes important data less valuable.

Low tech, maybe.  A couple of years ago, I was at a conference with
Carl Helmers, the guy that started Byte magazine.  We were shooting
the breeze, and I pull out my paper to check something.  He pulls out
his.  Eyebrows raise.  He has done the same thing for 20 years.

Note:  I also carry an old REX-3 sometimes.  I erased it three weeks ago
while fuddling a battery swap.  I haven't missed it, though I really
should reload it before my next out-of-town trip.

Sounds like you could use cvs.  I'd hate to vgrep a foot-tall stack of

Does anyone know of a good manufacturing package for Linux?  Needs to do 
Bill of Materials, finite scheduling, inventory, accounting, and all the 
other functions you expect in such a package.

It does not need to be Open Source, but source needs to be available and 
modifiable.  (I don't want to resell it, only make it work.)

Ideas?  Sources?  

OS X or Linux are the target platforms.

Most of the places I am looking will not admit what platform their product 
works under.  (Some for good reason.  Some due to weird perceptions of 
"legacy platform" issues. (i.e. PICK.))

Some stuff should be on paper though digital paper might not be a bad idea.

If you compress your paper down and recycle the savings, how many trees
are you really killing?  Before accusing anyone of being a tree killer 
because they
use paper, consider the resources involved in using any sort of digital 
substitute.  

How much environmental impact is there from producing the double A, 
triple A, etc. batteries that a palm pilot needs?  How much mercury and
other toxins will your palm pilot put into the environment over it's
lifetime?  Paper may actually be better for the environment than your
palm, course this can be weighed based on how much paper you're
going to use.  Arguably, different methods produce different results and
differing amounts of pollution.  Who knows, someone may invent a
nontoxic portable power source for the palm.

Jeme,

Try this if you think a web based solution might fit the bill. It uses 
ical (.ics) files which I believe Mozilla supports. You cant edit 
through the web interface but it does have lots of cool features 
including an RSS feed of all things. Its also searchable and password 
protectable.. Not perfect but pretty good.

...or buy a mac since ical will email you for appointments.

several years ago I went looking for an ical replacement, and I
decided to stick with ical.  it still works fine despite being
orphaned.  gentoo has an ebuild for it too.

one problem I had: the other calendar programs I tried didn't
cope with multiple readers/writers of the same calendar, which
was a problem for me when my home directory was nfs-shared.
(ical has always handled this fine.)

it looks like korganizer 3.2 has fixed this.

What I don't get is why ical if it's so popular isn't being brought up
to date?  Mozilla is open source too, seems like if you have the
skills you can upgrade mozilla to update ical calendars.  It's a lot
for one person to do, but clearly a lot of people want this.  
Otherwise, what is replacing ical?

I can't think of anything in particular that needs to be done to
bring ical "up to date".  it does everything I want, and I
haven't seen any bugs.  it's also easy to customize with tcl,
though I haven't felt a need to do that.

I think most of the things that other people would want to change
involve using a different gui toolkit, and it probably seems
simpler to write a new calendar program for a new toolkit.  after
all, ical itself is not a lot of code, and most of it is gui.

it's kind of nice to have a program that isn't stuck in a
constant feature/bugfix change cycle.  I wish more programs were
like that.

I love my Palm Vx. Most perfect yet. I can slide it into my pocket
with my keys and it's rechargeable. Perfect. :-)

Anyhoo. There are hacks/patches out there to make the stock alarms
much more annoying. And I highly recommend seeking out the BigClock
app. I don't need a watch or anything with it.

Bestbuy has Linksys BEFW11S4 Wireless Access Points on sale for
$39.99 after rebates.  These are IMHO about the easiest and most
functional 802.11b units around.  They configure via HTML, so they
are O.S. independent (though some of the Linksys units run Linux
internally).  These are 100mW units with two antennas and good range,
and Linksys also sells external booster amplifiers that take you up
to the FCC limit.

I bought one to make sure they are as easy to configure as I
remembered - they are, you can get to the WAP's web page and make
necessary naming, channel, and security changes in less than five
minutes.  I will experiment a little more and see if I can do a
"DHCP passthrough" to my wired internal network.

Those participating in the Linux Wifi Clinic on May 15 who do not
already have a WAP should consider buying one.  Note, these are NOT
suitable for running a managed-access  www.personaltelco.net  site,
you will probably want to buy a Soekris box for that.  That is about
10dB too complicated and expensive for an introductory clinic.

The sale ends Saturday.

FWIW, I've had one of those for about a year now.  I bought it down in
Mississippi for roughly $100.

The range is excellent.  My version, the version 3, has a few issues,
however.  After between one week and a month of running, it starts
dropping about 50% of the wireless packets to go across the interface. 
Pull the power plug, count to three, plug it back in and we're back in
business without any real interruption.

The different versions of this WAP are considerably different, though,
when it comes to innards and firmware.

FWIW, I'm using it entirely as a wired-wireless bridge.  DHCP passes
right through it, no problems at all.

This last weekend I took it down to the coast and set it up with the
PPPoE DSL down there, to act as a wireless/wired bridge, access point,
and router.  It worked like a charm.  The little DHCP server in there
doled out IP addresses properly... just plug and play.

Sweet, I might just have to pick up a second one...  :-)

Message-ID: <20040428180957.GC5450@gate.kl-ic.com>

Another note for the clinic.  Also IMHO, the best PCMCIA wireless
card is the Senao 2511CD Plus with external antenna.  These are
often rebranded, for example mine is rebranded with Teletronics
International.  The ones with internal antennas are cheaper and
a bit more rugged, but somewhat less capable.

I purchased mine for $100 (*with* "rubber ducky" antenna) from a
friend at local company Invictus Networks (www.invictus.com), but
you can also mail order them from Netgate (www.netgate.com) in
Spokane, about the same price.  There are probably cheaper places,
but both these organizations support Portland wireless efforts and
open source.

These cards are based on the PRISM chipset, and work well with the
HOSTAP drivers (preferable to the WLAN-NG drivers).  Note that many
chipsets do not have Linux drivers, like the cheap card-du-jour at
Frys.  In particular, the broadcom chipset is unsupported, and the
TI chipset linux driver is barely alpha.  Learn about the chipset
before you buy the card, and remember that the chipsets sometimes
change given the "same" model number of card.  Check the version, too!


You can learn all sorts of technical details about WIFI cards from
the FCC website:

https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/oet/cf/eas/reports/GenericSearch.cfm?calledFromFrame=N

My Senao card has an FCC ID of NI3-2511CD-PLUS3, so I enter the
following into the webpage:

Grantee Code:  NI3
Product Code:  -2511CD-PLUS3

then click "Start Search" .   All sorts of weird and partly relevant
technical details emerge, including the user's manual.  You can often
figure out the chipset from this data.  If there is a dash in the ID 
after the three letter grantee code, be sure to include it in the
product code, the FCC site is too stupid to wildcard the search.

Show up with the right stuff at the clinic, and things will go a lot
smoother.

FWIW, I'm runing on the cheap card-du-jour from Fry's right now... it
works, just as long as I don't try and do any WEP.  :-)

I've got a Netgear MR814v2 that I'd put into the same category:

Keith,

  This brings up an important point: what cards are available for older
portables with 16-bit pcmcia slots? I know I wasn't even aware of this
difference until I tried to find a pcmcia ethernet card for the ThinkPad
600E. Turns out there were only one or two still available that would work.
Cost a lot more, too, as a special order by a local shop.

  If I am to add WiFi capability to the ThinkPad and my older, Toshiba
Portege 3025CT, what options do I have for transceiver cards?

Thanks,

Rich

Why do I get this message about certain packages not being installed, when
doing an "apt-get upgrade":

The following packages have been kept back:
discover gnomemeeting gnumeric kamera kcmlinuz kcoloredit kcron
kdat kdead.....

It seems that the work-around is to go "apt-get install <paste>" where
paste is the list of packages from above.  While it seems to work, why the
hassle?

What is the reason for the packages being held back in the first place? 
Someone in #orlug said it was because of a dependency problem.  I thought
the purpose or goal of apt was to fix all dependency problems for you?

How do I make it not hold back any packages with apt-get upgrade?

Thanks!

  It might be worthwhile to check the ethernet cable to ensure it's not
intermittent. Otherwise I would place my bets on the on-board nic
starting to get flaky. Is it a manufactured system, or a DIY? Ever been
in a shop for repair? I ask because flaky problems are often caused by
ESD damage.

"apt-get upgrade" will update existing packages, but will NOT install new
packages.

If the dependencies have changed for the existing packages and the upgrade
would require the installation of new packages, then "upgrade" will leave
the packages with unmet dependencies untouched.

There are other reasons why a package might be "kept back".  It is best to
see what happens with the package when you try to "install" it.  It's a
tiny bit dangerous to just go ahead and "install" it, though... so do
this:
apt-get -s install <package kept back>

This will do a dry run, but not actually change anything.  You can figure
out from that output why "upgrade" didn't touch it.

> Someone in #orlug said it was because of a dependency problem.  I

> for you?

Yeah, apt handles dependencies just fine.  But "upgrade" isn't for making
major changes to a system (like adding new packages), but for safely
upgrading all of your existing packages.

> How do I make it not hold back any packages with apt-get upgrade?

If it's a production system, I promise you that the behavior is exactly
what you want.  If it's a desktop system, you can either do the dangerous
"dist-upgrade" (dangerous only because it'll install any new available
packages with whatever dependencies it deems fit, so you might end up with
a substantially less secure and sleek system than before).

I am looking for an elegant way of computing the nearest distance from
an arbitrary point P to a surface.  I have solved the simple cases
(for primitive shapes box, cylinder, sphere, toroid), but this one is
slightly more complex.  The case I am concerned about involves the
removal of a sphere of radius r and center point Q from those
surfaces.  Obviously, if point Q is not less than distance r from the
surface, it doesn't remove any material.  And in general, I only care
about cases where point Q is on or above the surface of the primitive.

Any pointers, ideas, solutions?

Thanks.

Russell,

  You may want to read the chapter on convex hulls in de Berg, M., M. van
Kreveld, M. Overmars and O. Schwarzkopf. 2000. "Computational Geometry:
Algorithms and Applications, Second Edition". Springer-Verlag. Or, Joseph
O'Rourke's 1998 "Computational Geometry in C, Second Edition" published by
Cambridge University Press.

  The latter book's chapter on convex hulls in three dimensions and the one
on search and intersection may give you the tools you need.

Subject: [PLUG] Any experience using a Treo600 as (usb) modem?
Message-ID: <20040429032903.GC1835@peak.org>

I'm trying to set up my IBM T41 laptop, running Debian Sarge
("testing"), to use my Sprint Treo600 as a modem.  Several websites
suggest that this should be possible, and even give directions, but
it's not working for me.  The problem is that I have too little
experience with USB, connecting to the Treo600 from Linux, and Sprint
to know what's going wrong.  I'll describe what I'm seeing hoping
it'll make sense to someone who knows more.

My Treo is recognized by the USB subsystem to the extent that I can
"hotsync" using pilot-link (device /dev/ttyUSB1).  When I hit the
hotsync button on the Treo's USB cable, entries in /var/log/syslog
suggest that /dev/ttyUSB0 and /dev/ttyUSB1 are attached to the device.
But as soon as I fire up minicom and send anything to the device
(using /dev/ttyUSB0) it crashes (resets).  I've done this with other
Sprint Treo600s, and with the latest Knoppix, all with the same
result, so I don't think it's the device or my kernel config.  I'm
hoping I'm just leaving out a step.

The device works fine as a modem from XP on the laptop (though that's
with proprietary software, not with the device as a vanilla modem).
It behaves this way even after a hard reset, so it's not something
I've added, though it could be a bug in the ROMs.  It's also possible
that the '##TETHERED' feature -- type that string into the phone app
to turn on the modem functionality -- has been disabled.  But it works
for some folks if you believe their websites. :-)

I read somewhere that the Treo needs to be recognized as an acm device
rather than as usb-serial, but this isn't happening.  Is it possible
that's part of the problem?  The pilot-link functionality, at least,
is there via /dev/ttyUSB1, not /dev/ttyACM?.  But could I force it to
be acm?

Here's what I see in /proc/bus/usb/devices when the Treo's connected.
I'll include all the devices.  Again, this usb stuff is too new to me.
I'm running 2.6.5.  On Knoppix (2.4.24?), though, it looks pretty much
the same except Driver=visor becomes Driver=serial.

Here's what shows up in /var/log/syslog when I put the connected
device into tethered mode:

Apr 28 18:52:38 toogood kernel: usb 3-2: new full speed USB device using address 5

Apr 28 18:52:38 toogood kernel: usb 3-2: Handspring Visor / Palm OS converter now attached to ttyUSB1 (or usb/tts/1 for devfs)

I have devfs turned on in my kernel, yet /dev/usb/tts/0 and
/dev/usb/tts/0 don't exist.  Is *that* part of the problem?

A but off-topic, but a co-worker has had success with his Treo 300,
under Windows.  He's looking for a Linux solution (and he's quite
good, so he'll probably find something soon).  I'll keep you (and the
list) posted, if interested

Not to put too fine a point on it, but (having found and flipped
through them at Powells) those two references were useless.  They deal
with polyhedral surfaces.  Flipping through other likely looking
titles at Powells was mostly equally useless.  One book came close,
over in the Computer Graphics section, but didn't address my
particular problem.

I am dealing with primitive shapes and need exact solutions.  And at
least for planar and spherical surfaces, I know I can get them.

For a cross-section of the planar case, see:

   <http://www.aracnet.com/~seniorr/indented-plane.png>

In region III, the computation is easy, just the distance to the
inside of the sphere, which is the distance PQ (remember, P is the
arbitrary point, not shown in the figure) minus the radius of the
sphere, r.  In regions I and II, the nearest distance is to points R
or S, respectively.  Above and to either side of those regions, the
nearest distance is the same as to the unindented surface.

The spherical surface case is equally tractable because of the
symmetry.

The intersection between the spherical divot and a cylinder or toroid
is probably going to be hairier since the radius of curvature isn't
isotropic.

The Senao card I have *looks* like a standard 16 bit PCMCIA card;  it
doesn't have the funny ground strip that I see on 32 bit cardbus cards. 
Check other sources, but I believe this ought to work with older machines.  
While wireless cards are a bit power hungry, they are not high bandwidth.

I don't have an available older laptop set up with a recent Linux.
Is there an easy way to look in /proc/foo/mumble to see whether a
card is attached as 16 bits or 32 bits?

Earlier I suggested looking at the FCC website for info;  I was too
lazy to take my own advice.  For the Senao card, the PDF manual is at

https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/oet/forms/blobs/retrieve.cgi?attachment_id=262871&native_or_pdf=pdf

... which states on page 1: "The PC card is a standard PC card that fits
into any PCMCIA Type II slot."

Thus, it ought to work with older laptops.  These cards are 11MBPS maximum
rate, typically a lot slower for data in actual practice.   The 54MBPS
802.11g cards are typically 32 bit cardbus.

Again, before buying a card get the FCC ID if you can, and look it up
on the FCC website.

Subject: [PLUG] Wifi drivers and open source
Message-ID: <20040429064417.GA11037@gate.kl-ic.com>

A bit of information about Wifi drivers, and why there are few open
source ones.

Wifi cards are software-controlled radios, and regulated and licensed
by the FCC.  Being software controlled, it is quite possible to program
them incorrectly, to emit energy outside the permitted band, for
example.  Therefore, the FCC licenses the combination of hardware and
software.  If the drivers were open source, then changes would have to
be re-licensed.  Thus, all drivers for Wifi cards, even "open" linux
drivers, contain a binary module or two straight from the manufacturer,
code that is not supposed to be changed.  

Whether the FCC is a stalwart defender of the public airwaves, or a
paternalistic anachronism thwarting freedom, is more a measure of 
personal prejudice than objective fact.  Nonetheless, they don't want
us to be able to change the drivers.  Unfortunately, this also means
that the Wifi chip manufacturer must either write code designed to
port to both Windoze and Linux (yay, Prism!  yay, Atheros!), or else
engage in very complicated licensing practices involving two different
binaries.  So they have an excuse for not providing a Linux port. 

Of course, the fact that many manufacturers are greedy, incompetent
swine cravenly submissive to Microsoft doesn't help :-)

Also, check for bad capacitors (the ones that are bulging on top and
possibly oozing), they can cause the same sort of symptoms, too.

Don't forget MemTest, 100 clean passes would give you some confidence
anyway.

You don't have to toss the board, if only NIC portion is bad, it has PCI
or PCMCIA slots, doesn't it?

Good Luck,

Keith,

  Both older machines run Slackware-9.1. When I get back to the office from
a business trip I'll check and report back.

Do you have a specific ruling or regulation form the FCC on this?  I
have heard people who seemingly should know say that this is not the
case.  That is to say, that there in nothing in the FCC rulings or
regulation that required closed source firmware.

I'm skeptical of this, too.  I can see how such a sticky situation
(licensing the software and the hardware in tandem) could make it very
difficult for a company to maintain, say, a public CVS repository.
However, there's nothing stopping them from distributing driver code and
turning a blind eye to modification out in the wild.

Anyway, it still doesn't explain much.  You wrote that there are "few open
source ones" which implies there are some (I don't use any wireless
equipment).  So surely it can be done.

Probably some dependency hangup.  aptitude provides better

Okay, now I've used yum to update my kernel: 2.4.22-1.2188.nptl i686
athlon i386: but still no love. I'm pretty lost here, any other
thoughts, like how I custom compile it in?

Subject: [PLUG] Help! -- Cannot find correct /boot
Message-ID: <APEBIDJLFPLCNAAOMMIAKEPKFFAA.wamorita@hevanet.com>

I am running Redhat 9.
I have recently upgraded from kernal 2.4.20-30.9 to 2.4.20-30.9 .
I have gone /boot (as root) and where I usually find the file controling the
grub menu along with other kernal version related files.
Now all I find in /boot is kernal.h .

When I look at the boot log I think I see the cause:
  mount: Mount: LABEL=/boot duplicate - not mounted
  netfs: Mounting other files systems:  failed

I look at /etc/fstab and it only has one /boot entry.  If I comment it out
the error message goes away, but the result in /boot is the same.

So two questions:

1. Why are there now conflicting /boot mounts?
2. How do I fix this so I can edit the grub menu?

do a fdisk -l /dev/hda

   tune2fs -l /dev/hda? | grep volume

  cat /etc/fstab

Do the tune? for each drive.  See if anything make sense.

If you can back everything up now, you may have a trashed partition table.

use the tune2fs command as Zot suggested.

One you determine which parition holds /boot (perhaps /dev/hda1?) change
/etc/fstab so that it mounts the boot partition by its /dev entry rather than
the the partition label.

Thank you Zot and Michael,

Since the Linux was on the second disk I did the fdisk on /dev/hdb1
and change the line in fstab from:
	LABEL=/boot /boot ................
to
	/dev/hdb1   /boot ................
and things seem to work now.

Does hda also have a partition labeled /boot?

much less enamormed with volume labeling afer being 
bitten by this:

We had a server power supply die.  To quickly recover needed data to rebuild
the server on another box we popped out the drive, put it into another machine
and booted.  Similar result to what you had.  When there is more than one

The Linksys WPC11 is a 16 bit card and they are generally available on 
eBay for $20 - $57.

Mine works flawlessly.

To be honest, I have to wonder just what the hell SCO was smoking back
when they thought the constitutional claim was a good idea.

Subject: [PLUG] My Dell Inspiron 5100 has bios revision A28...
Message-ID: <409210D5.8040506@robinson-west.com>

Looking for information on how to get Redhat 9 working correctly on it, 
the only patches I'm seeing on sourceforge are for bios A26 and A02.

Logging out under X is not working.  Do I need an acpi patch for the 
2.4.26 kernel?  How about a dsdt patch?  Anyone know how to get the
screen to turn off when it's closed?

I have found that a number of people put Debian on these, but when I 
looked into the Debian site it warned about compromise.  The Woody
install cd seems to be using a 2.2 kernel.  Maybe the stable version is 
too old?!?!?  What version do I want?  I'm working on getting Fedora
down, but it's huge for one thing.  I figure it should support 2.6 
smoothly and that there's a higher likelihood since it's newer of it not 
locking
up.

How do you compile the driver for the Radeon grpahics chipset?  Do I 
just need the pristine source from ftp.kernel.org?  My attempts
to use 2.6 on my desktop P4 gave me something bootable, but I couldn't 
get X going.  Do I need the framebuffer driver, or just the
XFree86 4 dri driver?  Do I need to compile the radeon dri driver as a 
module?  Do I need the source for X to compile the dri
driver?

What is the difference between Redhat's kernel source and source from 
ftp.kernel.org?

Chris,

  I believe this has been proven without a doubt by the latest noise from
one of their major investors: the California Vulture Capitalists asking for
their $20 million back.

  The other major purpose is to do Microsoft's dirty work in eliminating
linux as a threat to their monopoly and cash flow.

Warning!  Warning!

The WPC11 comes in multiple versions.  The original versions are PRISM
chipsets, with Linux drivers. Good stuff, and working fine for Mike and
many other people.  Version 4.0, the currently shipping version, is a
Cardbus card using the RealTek chipset, *without* Linux drivers.  Unless
you know exactly which version you are getting, the WPC11 is a crapshoot.

Note also, the WPC11 (version 3) is a 13mW card (11.2dB on channel 11)
while the Senao is 200mW.  Sometimes power and range matters;  talking
to a >=200mW WAP, the Senao will work at four times the distance.  See
page 35 of the FCC test report at:

https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/oet/forms/blobs/retrieve.cgi?attachment_id=224093&native_or_pdf=pdf

To find out what kind of chipset a particular card uses, check the list
at  http://www.linux-wlan.org/docs/wlan_adapters.html.gz .  It doesn't
cover everything, but it will prevent a few sad mistakes.  Before you
bring a PCMCIA card to the Linux Wifi clinic, please check this list.

Can you use yum to get the kernel source?  Once it is unpacked, spend
some time in "make menuconfig", then make bzImage, make modules, make
modules_install.

Good Luck,

	Not to mention their (the VC's) own admission that they prefer IP
litigation as a business model. And in this I agree with you.

	It seemed however, that not everyone is up on why SCO persists. And
actually, I was reading something either this morning before work or last
night that SCO is abandoning their GPL claims against IBM.. Don't remember
where, though. If I find it I'll post the link.

If nobody here knows, try the linux-dell-laptops Yahoo! group mailing
list.

You see, everybody here uses Linux, but most don't have Dell laptops. 
On the linux-dell-laptops list, everybody uses Linux and everybody uses
it on a Dell laptop.

Keith's point is well taken.  I run the version 3.  I have no experience 
with the v4.

Being a guy after Tim Allen's heart, I'm always interested in more 
power.  200mW vs. 13.  No brainer.  So I did take a look at the Senao 
cards and noticed the two versions.  Plus and Plus EXT2.  The EXT2 takes 
external antennae.  Does it also have an internal antenna?  The write-up 
suggested that if you don't need to switch to various kinds of antenna 
that rather than buy the EXT2 and a clip on antenna, you simply buy the 
Plus version with internal antenna.  Any real difference in performance 
between the internal and the clip on antenna?

Also, is there a difference if your WAP is not a 200mW WAP.  I have a 
linksys WAP11 at home and I'd bet dollars to donuts its nowhere near 
200mW.  I suspect that no matter how strong the wireless card, if the 
other end is weaker you will be limited to the weakest signal, at least 
when receiving.  Is this nuts?

You know, I've been wondering how much impact higher powered cards
have on laptop battery life.  I know Keith doesn't need to worry about
that with his N-mumble external battery pack thingie.  Anybody know if
that's going to be a significant factor?

Do windows still appear when you try running X11 programs?  If so, who

The ati driver or the dri driver? (or the framebuffer driver?) 

This depends somewhat on which radeon you have.

dri/framebuffer: just like the other drivers. 
ati: follow the ati instructions (search for linux radeon howto)

No. I really suggest you read some documentation, many of your
questions will be answered by 10-15 min of your time reading a radeon
how-to.

Subject: [PLUG] APCI modules not loading after building new kernel.....
Message-ID: <1083350249.9431.35.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I have just built a 2.4.26 kernel.

I took my redhat .config from fedora 2.4.22, which worked with 2.4.24
and compiled.

The only changes I made was swsusp patches.

When I add apci into mix, the modules will not load:

depmod -a
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.26swsusp/kernel/drivers/acpi/ac.o
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.26swsusp/kernel/drivers/acpi/battery.o
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.26swsusp/kernel/drivers/acpi/button.o
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.26swsusp/kernel/drivers/acpi/fan.o
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.26swsusp/kernel/drivers/acpi/processor.o

Looking at the first one:

depmod -e /lib/modules/2.4.26swsusp/kernel/drivers/acpi/ac.o

depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in
/lib/modules/2.4.26swsusp/kernel/drivers/acpi/ac.o
depmod: 	acpi_ut_trace_R92873c66
depmod: 	acpi_ut_exit_R701f7d27
depmod: 	acpi_ut_debug_print_Rad7e9744
depmod: 	acpi_ut_value_exit_R5d78b485
/lib/modules/2.4.26swsusp/kernel/drivers/acpi/ac.o:

# module             id=string
# pci module         vendor     device     subvendor  subdevice 
class      class_mask driver_data

# module             pattern
# ieee1394 module    match_flags vendor_id model_id specifier_id version
# module             id

/boot/system.map is up to date.

so I truck over to the source....

cd /usr/src/linux-2.4

grep -rl acpi_ut_trace_R92873c66 *

drivers/acpi/acpi_ksyms.o
drivers/acpi/acpi.o
drivers/acpi/ac.o
drivers/acpi/battery.o
drivers/acpi/button.o
drivers/acpi/fan.o
drivers/acpi/processor.o
vmlinux

So the symbol appears in acpi_ksyms.o which does not get copied as a
module.

 grep -rl acpi_ksyms.o *
drivers/acpi/Makefile
drivers/acpi/.depend
drivers/acpi/.acpi_ksyms.o.flags
drivers/acpi/.acpi.o.flags
make.log

Looking at Makefile 

export-objs     := acpi_ksyms.o processor.o

obj-$(CONFIG_ACPI)      := acpi_ksyms.o 

So I guess the question is, how is acpi supposed to be built?

 grep -i acpi .config
# ACPI Support
CONFIG_ACPI=y
CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT=y
CONFIG_ACPI_BUS=y
CONFIG_ACPI_INTERPRETER=y
CONFIG_ACPI_EC=y
CONFIG_ACPI_POWER=y
CONFIG_ACPI_PCI=y
CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP=y
CONFIG_ACPI_SYSTEM=y
CONFIG_ACPI_AC=m
CONFIG_ACPI_BATTERY=m
CONFIG_ACPI_BUTTON=m
CONFIG_ACPI_FAN=m
CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR=m
# CONFIG_ACPI_THERMAL is not set
# CONFIG_ACPI_ASUS is not set
# CONFIG_ACPI_TOSHIBA is not set
CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG=y
CONFIG_ACPI_RELAXED_AML=y

I have done all the makes, distclean, mrproper, clean, oldconfig,
xconfig....

So I recopied the System file, and rebooted and now ACPI is working.

Would be created during X-server startup, either `xinit` or `xdm`. The
message means no access cookie was ever created. This in turns means
connections to your X-server are controlled on a per-host basis, rather
than the prefered method of being able to access the cookie. For a
singleuser system this isn't a problem, but for multiuser systems this is
a severe problem.

What is happening is SSH is creating a fake cookie for connections to the
remote end, while at the local end host-based access is being used. This
is bad, but too likely to cause problems for you.

Mobility Radeon 7500C according to XP Home.

The modem is different than the Conexant too, XP says it's a BCM V.92 56k
which is a broadcom product.  I guess it doesn't affect anything though.

This laptop built at the start of the term is dissimilar from any of the 
Dell Inspiron
5100's I've been able to look up so far.  Is there any way under XP Home to
extract the needed information to create an acpi patch for this machine? 
 Why
doesn't Dell just release the information about the acpi tables and the 
bios?  Why
on earth do they change the part layout of these laptops, as of June 
2003 there
was a version somebody had supported.

"Citing WIPO data, McBride said that the value of the
worldwide software market would approach $229 billion
by 2007, and that it was being threatened by the ideas
behind the Free Software Foundation's GPL, the
software license that governs Linux. 

"The world, especially here in America, is shifting to
one that is an information society," McBride said. "In
the future, is that $229 billion in software still
going to be there? Or in the case of the Free Software
Foundation's goal, is proprietary software going to go

If you're a consumer, of course, the idea of saving
$229 billion might appeal to you. Actually, McBride's
argument is like saying that the millions of mothers

  I don't know, Paul. I've not yet tried running any application in a GUI.
About all I do remotely is process mail (pine), Usenet (slrn) and exchange
files between my workstation and notebook. The X11 forwarding is there just
in case I may need it some day.

Elliott,

  I presume you meant _not_ too bad. Thanks for the explanation. I will
return to not worrying about it.

  Now to see if I can get my WiFi card working in the notebook and learn how
to set up the LinkSys/Cisco WiFi WAP I bought on Keith's glowing
recommendation. :-)

If X isn't running on the system to which you're connecting, there'd be no
XAuth data to share with the remote host.

  The answer is a resounding "no" regardless of whether the software is
proprietary or sold under the GPL. There are numerous solid, value-filled
applications for linux that are proprietary and cost money; e.g., VMware.
Also, there's nothing in the GPL that prevents an application being sold
(e.g., Red Hat's distribution, Slackware's distribution, SuSE's
distribution) with source and the GPL.

  I'm in no mood to tolerate spin after my meetings. McBride is spinning so

So many questions . . .

There's A29 now, too.  Are you talking about the ACPI patches?  They've
never done anything for me.  I'm using ACPI now with kernel 2.4.22 on a
5100.  I can get battery and thermal info', but several features don't
work, including any useful sleep states.  Plus the machine won't power
off automatically under Linux.  I tried those ACPI patches, but they
made no difference.  It think the BIOS is simply written for Windows,
without much regard for the standards.

(Regarding the sleep states, I don't care much about a deep hibernation,
where RAM is dumped to disk and it powers down completely.  That depends
on OS support, I realize.  I just want "S4" to work, which is supposed
to keep the memory state but pretty much shuts off all the other
components to save power.  That would be very useful.)

You should not need an ACPI patch for that version.  You're not likely
to find one, anyway.  As for the lid, when I close mine the backlight
turns off, but still a very faint image can be seen, which is just how
the 5100 works, I believe.  (I think WinXP will send it into a shallow
sleep when the lid closes.)  I do receive lid-closed and lid-open ACPI
events, so if the sleep modes all worked, I could trigger them from the
lid events.  Again, this without any patching on my system.

If you're weighing distro's, consider Gentoo.  It takes longer to
install, because it's source-based, but it's easy to maintain.  And your
5100 should compile things speedily.

You don't need the framebuffer to run X.  Just take it incrementally,
start with the "vesa" driver, just to get things working.  You will want
either the radeon module in DRI or the ATI binary driver, depending on
which model vid' card you have.  Mine's an M7, so I use the DRI module.

  That makes sense, Jeme. As no one's logged into that system, X won't be
running, walking or crawling.

I think people read the books, some take classes, then take the tests to
cisco certify.

To Linux certify at the same time, you'd have to find somebody giving
one test right after the other.

As the two are really unrelated, why would you wish to do them at the
same time?  Heck, why not toss an MCSE on top, too?

I must say, I'm regularly impressed at the quality of questions and
rants you provide this list.

Yes, yum does that. I have to get the source so I can install the nVidia
driver for my dual head card (which I love) I run the nvidia installer
and it compiles some little thingie into the kernel so I can reboot into
serious acreage video mode.

I will play with this later.

Way too invasive to sign up.  They demand your gender, name, etc.  Are 
there any public forums with users who use Dell laptops that don't require
the leaving of so much personal information?  Besides, even putting in a

I don't see what my gender, name, postal address, and occupation have to

Clark College offers a few options for CCNA (Cisco Certified Network
Associate).  A 2-year degree program includes CCNA coursework:

http://www.clark.edu/academic_programs/technical/dnet/fs_dnet.html

There is also a Saturday-only Business & Industry CCNA course (taught by
myself), aimed at working professionals and non degree-seeking students:

http://web.clark.edu/conted/b&i/workshops.html#data

Right now the course in finishing up term 3 of 4, and will likely start
over in the fall with term 1.  Clark is also an authorized testing center
and in the past, students passing the term 4 final receive a voucher for
50% off the testing fee of around $125.

I think your being feseechious.  At the same time can be the same: 
month, three months,
year, etc.  If I can certify online, it's a lot easier to get two certs

That's nice.  It would be stupid to get an MCSE till I actually need one 
since
every version of Windows is close to completely incompatible with every 
other
version and the Microsoft certs are some of the most costly.  Nothing

Perhaps recalling and applying what your instructors attempted to

If you can't retain and apply the lessons of that course what good will other

Might be best to disable X-forwarding then. "-x" on the command line, or
"ForwardX11 no" in the config file. There have been a couple holes found
in XFree86, and those provide rather nasty access.

Incorrect. Even if a host doesn't have a local X-server or X-clients, if
it has `xauth` it can still act as a tunnel for X-clients. The XAuth data
originates on the server end, and unless explicitly configured not too
sshd will still attempt to setup X forwarding (until it discovers `xauth`
is absent at which point it will fail).

Oh, you mean that he's politically challenged.  As much as some want Linux
mailing lists to be dominated by politics concerning who can ask 
questions and
how they are to use the English language, I'm sure the majority of Linux
advocates have a more refined and sensible view.

First of all, English is the most convaluted language on the planet. 
 Second, you're being
feseechious too Rasmussen.  Geez, a colon was missing.  Worst case, 
feseechious isn't
spelled right.  If I studied every post you put up, I wonder how often 
the posts would
be helpful verses how often they would be critical of someone or just 
downright rude.

Everything you say it seems is a rant.  I don't see how asking about 
Cisco certification is
a rant, fortunately someone didn't think it was.  If you want a list 
where people ask questions
that are at your level, go find another one then.

I don't care if Rob or Michael Rasmussen are serious.  I don't have time

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0404301922500.6703@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

  On my Sony Vaio 505b with Slackware-9.1 there is a file named
/etc/rc.d/rc.hotplug with permissions 644. Thinking this might be related to
my problems getting my WiFi card to work, I changed permissions to 755 and
rebooted.

  Hoo-ha! What a mess. Dozens of messages about modules not being found,
unable to load and other saddening things. But, lsmod showed all the
expected modules loaded. WiFi card still wasn't recognized. Yesterday, I
chmod 644 /etc/rc.d/rc.hotplug and the boot-time messages (in
/var/log/syslog) went away.

  Could one of you experts please explain this behavior to me? I would have
thought that the resource file would have to be executable -- just like the
/etc/rc.d/rc.* neighbors -- in order to have hotplug capabilities.
Apparently not.

Just curious,

Rich

  OK. If I need to run models remotely rather than on my notebook I can

I'll do all three:

1)  They read the Cisco certification books and take the tests.
2)  RAFB
3)  Do you know how to do Internet research?

Actually, no.  For two things to happen at the same time, by their very
definition they must happen at the same time.  The same time doesn't
mean a year apart.  :-)

It's "you're" and not "your" when you're contracting you and are.

Actually, Windows versions are generally fairly compatible with each
other.  You're able to run most 16-bit Windows versions from over ten
years ago on Windows Server 2003.  Take a binary from a Linux distro
that's ten years old and you'll be far less successful, I would wager.

I'm not attempting to make this list unfriendly.  I am, honestly, being
short with you and a bit rude.  I don't like your posts.  If you wish to
explore the reasons for my dislike, feel free to email me off list.

Nope, I'm not on SCO's payroll.  I'd probably be a lot richer if I were,
however.

Obviously, anybody can answer a question on this list.  I do generally
get a bit snide with individuals who consistently ask "stupid
questions."  I believe, however, there are no stupid questions.[1]

Beside the point.  English is the language for communication on this
mailing list.  As such, it should be used to communicate so people can
understand what is being communicated.  I really don't think English is
the most "convaluted" language on the planet, though... there are far
worse languages out there.

It is a Yahoo! group, so you need a Yahoo! ID to access it.  That's just
the way it is.  As to the information they ask... do what everybody else
on the Internet does when asked for such information:  lie.

AFAIK, there are no other mailing lists or resources in general dealing
specifically with running Linux on Dell laptops.

It looks like, at least so far, the litigation has not been beneficial
to SCO's stock:

Ah.  I wouldn't bother enabling it in the mean time if you don't need
it, if only to make it less verbose.

Linux.  You can find a worse OS, but it costs more.
