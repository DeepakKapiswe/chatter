Subject: [PLUG] OT ReactOS 0.3.5 delayed...
Message-ID: <48430098.3040800@robinson-west.com>

I got some nasty feedback pointing this out.  Many posts complaining 
that an open source
operating system is not constrained by time limits.  A few comments 
about hacks.  One post
claimed that I need to help instead of pointing this out. 

On my Pentium 4 running CentOS 5 I can run Warcraft II BNE under wine.  
It works, but
it is so slow that it is unplayable.  I have crossover linux standard, 
albeit my version is out of
support and potentially old.  One thing I don't need Windows for is 
Microsoft Office 2000,
though that is getting old too.  I try to avoid using it, I just have it 
in case I need to make
sure that a word document create by OO will look okay in word.

They said April and that changed to May and now it is June.  If ReactOS 
reaches 0.4.x it will
be in it's final alpha stage, but at this rate that isn't going to 
happen this year.

How much Windows software can Linux emulate without having a comparable 
architecture?

I just upgraded my 64 bit machine to SUSE 10.3 from 9.3 and I am still trying 
to get it working properly. ?It hasn't been easy.
Does anyone know how to set up the automatic updater for SUSE 10.3? ?I need to 
know what windows to open and what information goes in each field.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0806030809200.5211@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I've posted this question on the OO.o mail list, but no one's responded
and I need to send out a proposal today; perhaps someone here has a solution
for me.

   Recently I upgraded from OO.o-2.1 to -2.4. When I invoke the new version,
the display typeface (and the pdf typeface) is a san-serif font regardless
of what typeface has been selected. However, the typeface widget on the top
of the frame shows the desired fonts when the cursor is on text.

   I've run spadmin and ensured that all the desired typefaces are available,
but I've no idea why they don't properly display. Any thoughts?

I'd say a lot--probably more than a third of the Windows applications I have tried to use under WINE have performed satisfactorily. If so, that would be a higher level of performance than ReactOS has yet shown with Windows applications.

Does anyone know of anyone who will accept donated electronic
equipment somewhere near Corvallis?  (I'm thinking of something
similar to freegeek, where they'll refurnish the beasties.)

There's some normal stuff - a couple of cpus and monitors and at least
one deskjet printer - but I've also caught glimpses of some pretty
obsolete stuff - a dot matrix printer and a reel-to-reel tape.  (I
haven't found anything that contains vacuum tubes, but I haven't made
it through all of the closets yet.)

Message-ID: <423450.2896.qm@web56613.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

I recently installed Citadel e-mail package on an Ubuntu server. Installation was easy, and everything has worked great except for one small catch. My domain is vanhoosen.net, so when I send mail it should be addressed from username at vanhoosen.net. This works fine if I send it through an IMAP client, but if I sent it from the WebCit web interface, the e-mail will show the sender as username at citadel.vanhoosen.net. "citadel" is the hostname of the Ubuntu machine that is hosting Citadel. Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance,

-Scott

I don't know Citadel, but in sendmail, this is called masquerading. 
You tell sendmail to MASQUERADE_AS your domain name. I think the 
Postfix uses the same nomenclature, but others will know better than 
I.

All you need to do is tell Citadel to do its moral equivalent of 
masquerading, and you're in like Flynn.

Subject: [PLUG] Perl, regex and xslt
Message-ID: <4848AB8A.50804@gmail.com>

I have some perl code that generates xml and with the help of xslt 
generates xhtml.

I've found that some of my source material contains characters that xslt 
doesn't like.

If I'm reading this right, this webpage seems to stipulate what 
characters are ok in xslt and what are not.

http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#NT-Char

#x9 | #xA | #xD | [#x20-#xD7FF] | [#xE000-#xFFFD] | [#x10000-#x10FFFF]

What I am trying to figure out is how to write a series of perl 
substitution lines to ensure that the output is ok for xslt.

something like

$value =~ s/\x0//g

This gets rid of the first null character, but is there a way to 
stipulate 0-8?

If there's a better way of doing it I'm all eyes.....



Thanks,

Sean

While not specifically a solution to your problem, it seems like the 
"Matching Multiple-Byte Characters" recipe from the Perl Cookbook might be 
helpful:

Since these are defined as Unicode, is there a Unicode module for Perl, 
I would start there. 
Or, how about this approach...

#convert the # to a zero
$value =~ s/\#/0/; 
# now in a numeric context 0xF00 is interpreted as a number so a simple 
range test works...
next if ($value >= 0xE000 and $value <= 0xFFFD);

Otherwise you'll need to use the RE quantifiers to give an explicit repeat
$value =~ s/\#x[0-9A-F]{2,4}//ig

Subject: [PLUG] netfilter transparent mode (like SonicWall)
Message-ID: <4849670C.5040600@acm.org>

Is there a netfilter (iptables) setup to do like the SonicWall 
Transparent mode?  I.e. filter publicly route-able IPs.

My searching via Google keeps turning up 'transparent' and 'squid' 
references.  There is no calamari involved in what I'm interested in 
doing. ;-)

I'm not sure why this is currently being done; I inherited the setup 
with no documentation.  I will NAT/masq the LAN until I find a good 
reason to make it a transparent setup.

 From what I've read about the SonicWall (a SOHO2; which hit end-of-life 
a long time ago) there is some virus, spam, etc. filtering going on.  It 
seems the transparent mode would make outside (WAN/Internet) access 
possible per machine instead of a doing the typical firewall port 
redirection.

Currently I can not find any need for this for this customer or if the 
access was ever setup or done.  May have been an up-sale by the ISP and 
whoever installed the SonicWall.  More expensive hardware and a per IP 
address cost.

So anyone have suggestions as to where (specifically) to look for 
methods of emulating a SonicWall with netfilter/iptables?


TIA,
Rod

Message-ID: <c834ec80806061019u73adb777n4bbd804396b2ab28@mail.gmail.com>

Does anyone have a usb -> svga adapter that I could try / borrow /
purchase?  I need to give a presentation or two in Europe, and I'm
hoping to take only an XO laptop (to save weight, and to take
advantage of the awesome wireless abilities).  The XO, of course, has
no video out.

I've found some indication that it is possible to get one of these
adapters to work with an XO (linux has support for the Net2280/SiS315
chipset, and see [1]), however, the newegg reviews of one indicate
that the video quality is not sufficient for a presentation, and I'm
not willing to spend $70+ on a device that might not do the job.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)

Thanks!

Assuming I understand what you're asking, I'd say iptables does this by
"default" in a sense.  In order to implement NAT or NAPT, one needs to
use the nat table in iptables.  If you don't use this, then your
firewall will just act as a normal filtering router.  You just need to
set up your filter table rules in line with what your routes/subnets are
and what ports you want open.

If you're actually talking about a bridging-mode firewall, netfilter can
do that too with ebtables, though I'm not sure if ebtables is
production-ready for what you're trying to do.  I've used it to
transparently filter access to VMs at the VM host level, but not for
full networks.

As for documentation, there's obviously plenty of iptables/ebtables
tutorials out there, all with their own approach.  If you'd like to the
way I approach iptables rulesets, come to the next advanced topics talk
since I'll be covering a bit of that in relation to IPv6 (but largely
applies to IPv4 as well).

good luck,
tim

Yes thanks for the pointers.  Between this and Paul's post I should be 
able to find what I need.

Ah, that's exactly the one I've been looking at.

The newegg review had me concerned ("You don't want to use this for a
presentation!") but perhaps that person was using an underpowered usb
port, or something (?).

Thanks for the xorg config and feedback!

Interesting reviewer conclusion.

Am running it along with:
* keyboard
* mouse
* 100B-T USB-to-Ethernet adapter (including two NFS shares)
* OS ("Live USB" Linux on thumb drive)

i.e. All of the above are on the same USB hub connected to a single
port on the MID and, again, it performs pretty well.

However, YMMV ;)

Great to hear!

I'll probably order one as soon as I confirm that I can actually give
a presentation on the XO at all (via some full-screen pdf reader, I
imagine).

Subject: [PLUG] Converting OS X encrypted disk images
Message-ID: <alpine.OSX.1.10.0806061409030.9453@guild.galois.com>

Just in case anyone is interested in permanently decrypting a .dmg 
(Apple disk image) file...

Yesterday, I purchased a copy of memtestosx, an Apple-specific utility 
that does what you'd expect given its name (and works with PowerPC and 
Mactel boxes).

It's a GPL-ed app -- though unusually, but not illegally, the author 
only sells it (for a whoppin' $1.39); he doesn't give it away.

Since it's released under the GPL, I'm free to make it available as I 
wish, but the .dmg file in which it's shipped is encrypted with a 
password.

To honor the author's ability to sell his product, I don't want to 
make the disk image generally available, but I did want to make it 
available to folks on our LAN.

I didn't want to force people to get the password to decrypt the disk 
image, but I was lazy enough that I didn't want to create a new image 
and run ditto to ensure a good copy.

hdiutil to the rescue! In OS X 10.5, I used hdiutil to convert the 
file to an unencrypted, bzip2-compressed image:

   hdiutil convert memtest_4.22.dmg -format UDBZ -o memtestosx-4.22.dmg

Besides being unencrypted, the new image is also much smaller. The 
original was 236K, while the converted image weighs in at 95K.

The kernel on your XO should be compiled with these:
CONFIG_USB_SISUSBVGA_CON=y
CONFIG_USB_SISUSBVGA=m

Possibly something to check before buying.

   As you note, perfectly legal.

   But, under the GPL (version 2 or 3) the author must either provide the
source code with the executable or upon the request of the purchaser. And
you are free to give it away as long as the original copyright and license
are included in what you distribute. So you should have been able to compile

The source code is all there. Honestly, I didn't want to go through 
the hassle of compiling it and testing the results before distributing 
it locally. afaict, the author has done the right thing according to 
the GPL.

Paul,

   It puzzled me why a GPL'd app would be on a copy-encrypted distribution
medium if the source code was provided. Seems inconsistent to me. That was
why I responded. Anyway, it's not worth a long conversation.

Keith and others,

Yes, we are settled in the PSU Engineering building for the forseeable future.
The building is the Fariborz Maseeh College of Engineering and
Computer Science Building.
The room is and will be FAB 86-01 (Student Lab).
I still need to change the room number on the web site.
Currently, it is wrong.

Subject: [PLUG] Postfix/Spamassassin question
Message-ID: <484D4E3B.6040205@frankhunt.com>

Here's the classic scenario:  Incoming spam is addressed to an invalid 
user at my site; some are not caught by spamassassin and thus rejected 
by postfix and returned to the "sender".  The sender, in this case, is 
another invalid user at some other site (hacked or hijacked system most 
likely).  That email is, in turn, rejected and sent back to me as an 
unknown user.  Seems like all this traffic could be prevented if on my 
server those messages were silently rejected or trapped and not bounced 
back.  So the question is, how can I trap incoming messages for invalid 
users?  Is there a way to send them to a garbage-collector for later 
review?  I understand that simply silently rejecting them violates a 
bunch of RFC's but . . .

Thanks,

Frank,

   Look in postfix's main.cf for the section REJECTING MAIL FOR UNKNOWN
LOCAL USERS. Then make a recipients file. Also, in main.cf's JUNK MAIL
CONTROLS section, create a section like this:

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
         permit_mynetworks,
         reject_unauth_destination,
         check_recipient_access hash:/etc/postfix/roleaccount_exceptions,
         check_recipient_access hash:/etc/postfix/recipients,
         check_helo_access pcre:/etc/postfix/helo_checks,
         reject_non_fqdn_recipient,
         reject_non_fqdn_sender,
         reject_unknown_sender_domain,
         reject_non_fqdn_hostname,
         reject_invalid_hostname,
         permit

HTH,

I will put "Engineering Building" and the address, and not include
the room number. I assume we will put up signs in the building. 
Since they moved us around in Smith a lot, and we have already
moved in the Engineering building, I can't imagine that we would
actually keep the same room for a year.  Heck, they might end up
renumbering the rooms in that time!

The next question, of course, is whether Jax survives.  I know it
is a great sacrifice for you all, but be sure to show up for Afters,
and drink lots of beer!

So, if someone miss-types an email to someone on your server, the
sender will have no indication that the email was not received, and
the intended recipient will have no indication that the email was
sent?  This sounds like a phenomenally bad idea -- I hope I'm
misunderstanding something.

Has anyone gotten it to work on Fedora Core 3?

It would be a lot of work to get rid of Fedora Core 3 in my server
infrastructure.

I notice that Fedora isn't officially supported, but Ubuntu is.

The Ubuntu graphic and progress bar pops up, but it crashes immediately
to a shell, probably ash, with the message that it can't access a tty.
and it says job control turned off.
On the server side, I see:

Jun  9 14:31:44 goose rpc.mountd: bad path in mount request from
192.168.1.82: "192.168.1.2:/nfsroot/ltsp5/i386"

and

Jun  9 21:31:36 goose in.tftpd[6232]: tftp: client does not accept
options

/nfsroot/ltsp5/i386 is where I have the ubuntu 6.10 ltsp image root
directory.

I'm at a loss as to what is going on...

Well, I backed out and tried ltsp-4.2 instead which is working.

I also went ahead and ordered a Fedora Core 9 DVD from cheapbytes.

I guess I have to bite the bullet and upgrade.

I was going to ask, if the difficulty in changing from Fedora Core 3 to
another distro was also a difficulty in upgrading to the more current Fedora
release.
It sounds like you are able to mitigate that?

IMHO upgrading is a good move.  Fedora release that old will start getting
stale, they won't keep doing security updates on them after a release is
more than 2 release versions old (I think that is the cut-off).  At any rate
Fedora is not meant to be a long term stable distro.

Fedora is a good desktop distro, but for a server that needs long term
stability CentOS might be a better choice.
I run Fedora 9 right now on my desktop and I like it, I have used RH stuff
since 5.0, along with Debian, Ubuntu, etc.

I expect to upgrade Fedora often, so in my case I just keep /home on a
separate partition and backup my files, upgrade (well clean re-install
usually), reintegrate my files, retweak the settings, etc.  For a desktop
this is workable but obviously this could lend to issues with a server
(unless it is just a home "tinkerer" server).
IMHO.

Good luck with it ;).

Frank,

   Rejecting is not the same as dropping. The former goes to the nominal
sender while the latter is sent to /dev/null and no one is aware that the
message even existed.

   Postfix will look at /etc/passwd for valid usernames and reject those
messages that have recipients not found there. Each day I see hundreds of
such messages in my mail log summary; they all have my username with four
digits or letters appended which invalidates them.

   You can also create header_checks and body_checks files with content you
want rejected. They are highly effective.

Subject: [PLUG] boot from USB, run on RAID?
Message-ID: <20080610150315.GK24562@merlot.com>

All the big kids boot their servers from a USB stick, and run either
diskless (SAN, mounted by the USB boot) or internal RAID. I'd like to
understand this better. 

Does the USB key have to be unmounted after boot so it doesn't get worn
out with excessive writes? It seems like I should be able to use the
grub config to tell the booted system to look at the storage instead of
the USB key; is there a good HOWTO for this?

I recently tried to build a FreeDOS boot USB stick to upgrade the BIOS
on a motherboard, but I have failed and I'm not willing to spend too
much more time on it. HP is supposed to have a nice utility to build
bootable USB keys on Windows, but all the links I've found on the HP
site are broken. Any suggestions?

Thanks.

Perhaps you could use noatime or mount it readonly and remount 
readwrite as necessary.

On the subject of invalid recipients, I see quite a few as well.  Why
are attempts to reach unserved users so common?  I run a filter that
checks if an invalid recipient has been tried 3 times from the same ip
address, but I'm not getting very many hits.  I also check for 6 tries
to a retired recipient, but the most I am seeing lately is 4 tries.

I still get some spam even after sqlgrey and razor have their way with
things.  Actually, razor isn't used to block spam, just to mark it.
Razor thinks bounce messages are spam, so it's not perfect.

I also have a custom dns blacklist, but what should go in it?  I got
nigerian spam, so I put the IP address of the mail server with a french
address that sent it to me in my dns blacklist.  It's debatable whether
or not I'll ever see that server again.

The other thing I do is check spamcop and sorbs.  I'm wondering if there
are any other blacklists that I should check?  I kind of arbitrarily
chose these two.

I check the helo address to see if someone is saying hello as me or
localhost, but I'm not so sure that this check is appropriate.  Some
people say don't check the mail from, but I do and I check the receipt
from too.  If neither the receipt from nor the mail from resolve, I
consider the source IP blacklist fodder 
(A postfix map file in this case).

Here is the recipient restrictions section of my main.cf:

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =    reject_non_fqdn_recipient,
                                     reject_non_fqdn_sender,
                            reject_unknown_recipient_domain,
                               reject_unknown_sender_domain,
                                  reject_unlisted_recipient,
                                   reject_unauth_pipelining,
                                          permit_mynetworks,
                                  reject_unauth_destination,
            check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/blacklist,
                reject_rbl_client spamsrc.robinson-west.com,
                           reject_rbl_client bl.spamcop.net,
                          reject_rbl_client dnsbl.sorbs.net,
               check_policy_service unix:private/policy-spf,
                   check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:2501,
                                                     permit

The sqlgrey should be the last check, 2501, but it is not oddly.
I want it to be checked if and only if the connection hasn't been
rejected by some other rule already.  I'm not sure what
reject_unlisted_recipient does or if it is in the right place.
I'm not sure about reject_unauth_destination either.

Well Rich, what do you put in header_checks and body_checks???
Understanding the syntax for these files is not easy and figuring
out what should never be present in a header or a body is even
harder.

Beautiful! It works, except for one thing: that image file no longer
exists. I used the 'fdboot.img' file, and it doesn't keep the USB stick
available.

I tried the 'balder10' image (it's supposed to be a replacement for the
odin track), but that didn't load the USB either.

Any thoughts?

You can get the fdodin91.img file here, at least for a week or so.

I would be interested in helping out.  I run the PLUG Advanced Topics
group.  (I also know a fair amount of people at KBOO.  Conch, for one,
knows me.)

Give me a call at 503-422-6209 and we can discuss it.

A USB key is just like any other disk in that it'll have an MBR, a
boot loader, and partitions.  They key is that your MoBo needs to know
how to recognize the USB stick and boot from it.  That may require
some adjustment in you BIOS and some BIOSes do a better job than
others.

So let's imagine you have Ubuntu installed and the thumb drive appears
as /dev/sdb, here's a quick-and-dirty way to get grub on it:

1) partition the drive with one 100 MB partition: sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
2) format the partition as vfat: sudo mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdb1
3) mount it: pmount /dev/sdb1
4) install grub: grub-install --recheck --root-directory=/media/sdb1 /dev/sdb
5) copy memtest: cp /boot/memtest86+.bin /media/sdb1/boot/
6) create a menu.lst file in /media/sdb1/boot/grub/.  For example:

timeout         10
title           Memtest86+
root            (hd0,0)
kernel          /boot/memtest86+.bin

That will give you grub on a USB stick.  Once you get that to work,
then you can add stanzas to menu.lst for a Linux kernel.

Rich,
Thanks for the tips.  I made some minor tweaks this AM and have not seen 
any "Undelivered Mail Returned to Sender" messages in the spam filter 
since.  Time will tell.

On a related subject (sorry, this should really go to plug-talk,
please address followups there), I am looking to "recover" the best
possible (in a practical sense) audio from an old (~40 years)
reel-to-reel tape, into a digital format.  Preferrably someone in
town.  I have a 20 year old audio cassette copy, but the treble end of
the spectrum is pretty much shot on that copy.  I am hoping that the
original is in better condition, but of course without the gear I have
no idea.  I know there are places I can ship to, but the original is
precious and I'd rather not risk it getting lost.

Can anyone recommend someone in town who can do a good job with the
material that's available?

Thanks!

   Dick Steffens bought a USB turntable and I bought the ARTcessories USB
PhonoPlus preamp/converter. Haven't had the time to use it yet, but I'm sure
it will work well.

Frank,

   I have found Rolf Hilterbrandt's Postfix book to be an invaluable help. I
worked my way through his extensive discussion/examples of UCE filters,
testing each one as it was added, and found their effectiveness -- and my
understanding -- increased. Very powerful tools.

   The SpamAssassin web site and mail list also helped me tremendously.

   Probably took me two days of focused effort to redo both Postfix and
SpamAssassin but the results are certainly worth the time and effort.

Rich,
Thanks again, I will check out the book.  I think things are in pretty 
good shape now - at least based on a one day sample anyway -- 
spamassassin caught 99 spams yesterday, which is down significantly from 
the historical 200-300 daily, so that means the others were dropped. 
Large amounts of spam come to abandoned email addresses and thus were 
generating at least two hits each with the former configuration.  My 
filters are catching > 99% of spam but is still annoying when one gets 
through.  Lately the messages with a high  gibberish content are the 
only ones sneaking in.  More research required on those . . .

Frank,

   Don't waste time on those. Pass them to SA (don't forget to run sa-learn
for both spam and ham periodically) and just press the delete key.

I bought an Ion iTTUSB turntable from Amazon -- I'm pretty sure that's
where I bought it. It's available from them for $135 or so:

http://www.amazon.com/Ion-iTTUSB-Turntable-USB-Record/dp/B000BUEMOO

It comes with a CD containing the Winders and Mac versions of Audacity.
Those versions -- at least the Winders version -- support the USB
feature of the turntable. The last time I checked, the Linux version of
Audacity did not.

The turntable does not do the mp3 encoding itself; that's left to Audacity.

The turntable has an analog stereo output as well, so I've connected
that to the sound card on my Linux machine. I'm pleased with the
results. Earlier this year I bought a needle from  for playing 78's:

http://www.lpgear.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=LG&Product_Code=IONSITTUSB78

I have used the USB connection with my XP laptop and then copied the
.wav files to my Linux machine for further processing with gramofile and
bladeenc. I didn't see any particular advantage to the USB recording vs
analog; I probably will stick with analog in the future.

I'm very happy with the Ion turntable. It has a pre-amp, which is needed
to connect the magnetic cartridge to the input of the computer's sound
card, but if you already have a good turntable and a pre-amp, they will
work just as well.

Subject: [PLUG] OS Survey at RMLS
Message-ID: <48503EF8.8070903@comcast.net>

Realtors Multiple Listing Service, the MLS for much of the state, took a
survey the other day asking which operating system members "prefer." Of
course I replied "Linux." The results are not surprising. 3296 members
responded with the following breakdown:

Vista	13%
XP	77%
Linux	 1%
Mac OS	 9%
Other	 1%

It's possible that I'm the only one who picked Linux, and the result
tabulator rounds up to 1%, but it may mean that there are other Linux
fans in the real estate business. At least Linux rated it's own category
instead of being lumped in with other.

RMLS promised us that around the middle of this year they'd release a
version of their web site that we could use with browsers other than IE.
I think they switched focus because what they are in the process of
releasing is a version for mobile devices, like smart phones. So, until
they get back to the main site conversion project I'll have to keep
using XP.

These numbers are about on par with national usage statistics.

They certainly match my site for users.

There should have been a line item in the poll for preferred browser as well
as OS.

That might have helped to encourage them to finish the site conversion

Do you mean rmls.com? That works fine for me (and for my wife), but
maybe you have a different site or a different site if you're actually a
realtor.

rmls.com is the public access site. Members go in through a different site.

I think they understand that enough of the general public uses Firefox
that they had to make it work for them. The member site still depends on
a number of active-x components (they won't say which), and so requires
IE. Back when they introduced it, "everyone" was still on dial up, and
some of the features were more responsive when the processing was pushed
to the users' machines.

Have you tried IE in linux?  I found a site the other day that was a
single install
of IE with wine that did the trick.

Supposedly 6.0 installs just using regular Wine, although perhaps not so well on all distros.

http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=469

I used to run 6.0 under Wine as far back as Dapper x86_64, but I always used Codeweaver's version of Wine (Crossover Office).

PLUG Advanced Topics Meeting 
June 18th, 2008 at 7pm - 9pm
Jax Bar 
826 SW 2nd Avenue

Speaker:   Timothy D. Morgan
                 Virtual Security Research, LLC.

Subject: IPv6

IPv6 is the next generation Internet protocol designed to expand usable
address space and implement evolutionary improvements to the current
IPv4 protocol.  As the address space shortage looms near, it is becoming
increasingly clear that the networking and systems communities remain
ill-prepared for this transition.  This talk provides a broad overview
of IPv6, it's features and transition technologies, and follows with a
demonstration of how to set up an IPv6-enabled firewall for a simple
network using Linux.

And a basic BIO:

Timothy D. Morgan is a long-time programmer, systems administrator,
security consultant, and Linux user.  Tim's work in IPv6 has consisted
of home networking experiments and research in utilizing the expanded
IPv6 address space for spoofed attack mitigation.  Tim currently works
as an application security specialist and digital forensic investigator
at Virtual Security Research, LLC.

Remember to buy food and drinks and tip your waitress well.
Jax has been very good to us over the years and we want to make sure they 
survive.

What am I going to do with this big box of Penguinos, the premier
penguin-themed mexican cupcake?  I know, I will bring them to the
Linux Clinic on Sunday!  Perhaps we can boot Ubuntu on them!

The Linux Clinic runs from 1 to 5 PM this (third) Sunday, June 15,
at Free Geek 1731 SE 10th in Portland.  The main facility and the
store are closed;  we will be in the room on the southeast corner.

Not only will we have penguinos, cookies, coffee, portland punch,
and other savory collations, we will have distros, power, wifi,
wired ethernet, keyboards, monitors, and much, much more!  We will
even have answers to your most pressing Linux questions, and some
fraction of those answers may be approximately correct!

So bring yourself, your machine, a notebook to write in, and what
Linux knowledge you have to the Linux Clinic!  We can use helpers
as well as helpees;  this is your chance to flaunt your knowledge,
or just make stuff up!

Keith

Or, perhaps we can boot them with Ubuntu?

I have a CD with Kubuntu 7.10, but I find I do not know how to use it.  I can 
use Adept to upgrade--it goes through its paces, then says it will take X hours 
to download the stuff--last chance to cancel.  Well, I have the stuff on the CD 
right here.  How do I use it to upgrade (NOT a full install)?

Clue stick whacking sought.

If it is a Live CD then boot from the CD and install from there.  If it 
is an install only, I think it boots and starts the process.  If you 
truly want to update to 7.10, start Adept, under the Adept menu click 
manage repositories, under the Third-Party Software tab you can x the 
cdrom box and uncheck the http: boxes and all should be good.

There is a newer version available.  If you can make the clinic 
tomorrow, they can help you.

Bruce,

Thanks for your reply.  I can make it to the clinic, but this is a desktop 
(grunt), so I am trying to do this here. I do want to do a version upgrade to 
7.10 from 7.04.

I got so far as

"start Adept, under the Adept menu click manage repositories, under the 
third-Party Software tab..."

No tabs in my system--only a list of sources.  I understand that ubuntu is 
easier than Kubuntu, so maybe you have ubuntu.

Any other ideas?  My Googling led me some comments saying that one needs the 
"alternate CD", not the "standard CD".  No mention of how to tell what I have.

This is what ls -l gives me from the root of the CD:

total 1169

No magic word "upgrade" in sight.

I will be at the Clinic with a full complement of all the Hardy CDs -
that is, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Edubuntu and Xubuntu, all in 32- and 64-bit
and including the alternate  and server versions of all of the above. 

I downloaded them all shortly after Hardy went final and saved them on
the big-ass drive in my desktop.

Sorry, I should have read your post more carefully.  I missed the 
upgrade not install part.

John,
I am sure Hardy is neat, but I would prefer to UPGRADE from my present 7.04. 
This requires going through 7.10 (Gutsy).  The only way to go from 7.04 to Hardy 
(number?_) directly is to do a full install.  I am not sure that I want to do 
that. Comments?

Apparently what I need is a CD which has the script "cdromupgrade" on it.  Mine 
does not have such, at least I have not been able to find it.  Moreover, the url 
link on the CD I have leads me to a page which says "...this is a 
pre-release...".  It is clear that I do not want that.

Rats. I misunderstood what you needed. 

The distros are all on my desktop, which I don't normally bring to the
Clinic. So, in anticipation of the Clinic, I decided to check my stack
of distro CDs to make sure I wasn't lying about what I will have with
me. I noticed several missing ones, plus I decided to download Edubuntu
and Xubuntu which apparently weren't available last April when I
downloaded the others. Then I started burning the missing ones. Except
I ran into a problem - the 7.10 versions were all in the same folder
and I kept clicking on the wrong one. Thinking that no one would ever
want those old ones I just deleted them to save space on the disk and
keep me from burning the wrong ones. And now this morning I get your
note that you need one of the old ones. Aaargh.

I'd re-download, but I'm not sure which one you need. You really need
to download from home or something because Free Geek doesn't have
enough bandwidth to get a whole distro in the time we will be there.

OK.  It looks like I will not be coming to the Clinic.  I will instead start the 
upgrade from the internet.  It could take a full day to do it, but at least I am 
less likely to create problems for myself than if I try to monkey with the 7.10 
CD that I have.

I would like to jump in with my $0.02 about the "upgrade vs. install" issue.

I run Fedora X86_64 on my main desktop, and Ubuntu (both x86 and PPC) on
several different laptops, from G3 and G4 Powerbooks, a PII Dell, and a
generic centrino.

On my desktop, I have a separate /home partition, and keep all my data on
that.  When a new release comes out I backup config files to /home, and just
do a full install, then tweak or re-merge the config files (mainly just
xorg.conf, /etc/mailcap, things like that).  Doing a full install helps keep
things cleaner IMHO.  I used to do upgrades, on this machine from Fedora
core 1 to Fedora core 2, and a few others in there.  After a while things
got a little muddy so I decided to do a clean install.  Makes life easier.
With a separate /home you can maintain your data and personal settings.

On my Ubuntu laptops I don't have separate /home, (in some cases the HDD is
only 6GB) but I don't keep much on them anyway.  Ubuntu is easier to upgrade
with the Update Manager, it has an automagic upgrade tool (which is a
front-end for apt-get dist-upgrade).  I used it a few times, it works OK.
But for Hardy I did full install on a couple of my laptops to clean them up.

Especially in a case where you are behind several releases (and will need to
do several upgrades), my recommendation is to backup your data, repartition
with a separate / and /home (and swap and possibly /boot), then do a fresh
install of Hardy.  It will save time and headaches in the long run.  Doing
an upgrade install takes longer than a regular install, and it can leave
some things in a weird or just broken state.
IMHO, YMMV, etc.

Good luck with it whichever way you go :).

Subject: [PLUG] Distro downloads 'n stuff
Message-ID: <20080615205236.ec59f134.johnxj@comcast.net>

Another scintillating afternoon at Free Geek has ended with another
more or less successful Clinic. Lots and lots of people, so if someone
is promoting the Clinic, your work is paying off. Keep doing it!

In consideration of the issues of Denis' need for a CD of Gutsy
Alternate and my idiocy in deleting my copy of it, I been thinking
about distros and the Clinic. Some thoughts:

1) There are a ton of distros, many with multiple versions. There are
more than a dozen just for each version of Ubuntu.

2) It never fails that the one that someone needs is the one I left at
home.

3) Bandwidth at Free Geek is not good enough to download an entire
distro in the time allotted.

4) It turns out that I have a 60 GB USB hard drive that I am not using. 

In consideration of the above, I have decided to dedicate the 60 GB
hard drive to the Clinic. It will live in a box that I always bring
with me to the Clinic. I will populate it with the latest downloads of
all popular distros and keep them on it for a couple of years. At the
Clinic we can then just burn a CD of whatever someone needs in a few
minutes. I have pretty good bandwidth at home, and torrents can run
unattended on my desktop. My real main computer is my laptop, so it's
not a big deal if my desktop is downloading ISOs.

Having said that, I know there are distros that I should maintain on
the disk, but I don't know which ones. Considering its popularity, I
certainly plan on maintaining all versions of Ubuntu. But what else do
people think I should have on it? Puppy? DSL? Fedora? Others? 

It was also suggested at the Clinic that I could maintain an ad hoc
repository on it as well. However, I countered that such might take way
more space than is available. But maybe a minimalist approach would be
doable. Comments from y'all on this idea are also welcome.

1. Fedora 9
2. Ubuntu 8.04
3. CentOS or Scientific Linux 5.x
4. Debian Etch
5. latest openSuSE
6. Maybe Gentoo, although if their release doesn't make it out of beta 
soon, I'm not convinced they're going to survive.

That's really it, I think ... if there's nothing you like in that list, 
you're probably not a Linux person. :)

Maybe one of the BSDs and Solaris Indiana?? I'm seriously considering 
trying Indiana on my ancient Compaq Presario. I put Fedora 9 on it, but 
I really don't use it that often -- it wouldn't be a bad thing if I 
wasted a week on openSolaris. :)

Sounds like a great idea. FYI I did get my POS Broadcom card working just fine 
with that 15 step method I showed ya. Ubuntu is now set free! ;-)~

Richard,

I'm up in North Idaho (NILUG.ORG) and at the last meeting a member ran 
into an issue with a Broadcom chip based pci card and Ubuntu 64.

Could you share your 15 step process or a link to it.


Thanks,

You might consider including other linux rescue CD images (cli based) as
well.

I have used Finnix ( http://www.finnix.org ) and SystemRescueCD (

This is useful for things like booting an installer (one-time USB boot).
For a permanent USB boot device, I've learned that I have to build a
custom initrd file with a linuxrc script that mounts the non-boot disks
and uses pivot_root to make them the boot disk. 

Thanks for the tips.

Rod,

Here is the link:

It says its for an HP Pavillion dv9000 but it worked like a charm on my dv6505

PS--its only a 12 step process...I have been known to exaggerate ;-)~

I don't follow.  What's a one-time USB boot?  What's a permanent USB
boot device?  What distro are you using?

FWIW, I boot my laptop from my external USB drive for all my Linux
work.  That way the internal Windows drive remains untouched.  Some
photos:

http://www.flickr.com/photos/rwcitek/tags/usb/

In the photos you'll see that I use Grub to choose from among eight
(8) OS installs on a single USB drive, including Debian, Ubuntu, and
CentOS.  I created that drive using instructions almost identical to
the one's I wrote in the previous post.

Regards,
- Robert

I propose something different. 

Rather than try to fit everything on John's 60GB drive (and given point
(2) above, which will also apply to that drive), and given the limited
speed of his CD burner, I propose that we build a small mirror server
for Free Geek, that lives permanently in their server closet and on the
Free Geek internal network and is not available for outside access. 
Given their very limited bandwidth it would not be complete mirror like
PSU or OSUOSL, just distros that we might want.  

We can set up nightly "wget" runs to download new distro images of
interest, perhaps copying the URLs over from a wiki page (on either
the PLUG or Free Geek wiki) where people can queue up a list of desired
URLs for images and md5sums.  I would like there to be a manual vetting
process for that, so that spammers or other scum don't subvert it or
point links in the wrong direction, but it should be fairly easy to
maintain, and much easier to do than manual downloads.  Of course, we
could all bring in CDs and disk images on our laptops at the clinic,
and upload those, saving Free Geek bandwidth.

Free Geek would have access to the server the rest of the month, of
course.  Perhaps they can even set up a "download and burn" booth in
the store, so that customers can choose and download distros for a 
small fee.

Since this is a fixed location box, it can be a lot bigger than John's
60GB - I'm thinking two seagate 750GB drives, which are often on sale at
Fry's for $110.  If we split them up correctly, we can download from both
drives at once at full ethernet speed.  We could seed it at PSU, on their
network, from the PSU mirror, before we install it at Free Geek.  I can
probably arrange this through Bart or some other friend at PSU.  Who
should we talk to at Free Geek?

John's drive might will still be useful, as a portable "bucket" for him
to carry stuff in at the last moment.  Many of us have better bandwidth
than Free Geek, so we can bring in more stuff with portable drives than
the Free Geek mirror can download at the last minute.

Lastly, I propose that we put out a donation box at the clinic, to help
pay Free Geek for the facilities we are using for the distro server and
the Clinic.

Keith,

I like this idea.  I believe the 750Gb have been going for $90 lately.
We can do iso mounts from the server to install whatever distro.

I don't mind sharing a bit in the expense of something like this.
However, I have to say that I do not understand what y'all are
proposing and why it would be better than a USB disk. What would be the
transfer rate from the server?

Another question is how we maintain the server. Does someone have to be
in charge? How will it be kept up to date, i.e., when a new version of
a distro comes out, how can we be sure that it gets installed on the
server?

I have no idea who at Free Geek to contact. And since I don't
understand what y'all are talking about, I would sound stupid if I
called someone to talk to them about it.

I like the idea of a donations box at the Clinic. It probably won't
raise much, but sometimes the thought is more important than the
execution.

Since my original message, I have re-downloaded the Gutsy ISOs that I
deleted earlier. So now I have every version of Gutsy and Hardy (16
versions for each). I also have all versions of Fedora 8. And in
addition I have 

Gentoo 2007.0
Damn Small Linux 3.4.6
Ultumix 0015UE
PCLinux-2007
Puppy 3.01
Sabayon 64-bit 3.5 Loop 1
Simply Mepis 6.5.02.64
Slax 5.1.8.1
Syllable 0.6.4

I need to check the websites for the above to see if they are the
latest, and update as necessary. 

I also need to add the distros that others in this thread have
suggested.

Also I need to add some rescue and utility CDs, as others have
suggested.

At the current point the folder with the above has 45 GB. After I
finish the above I will not have much room left on the 60 GB USB disk.
In fact, I probably don't have enough room for everything we want.

If we are going to have a couple of 750 GB drives, I am curious about
the suggestion of creating a local repo. How big is a repo?

E.g. Debian netinst. You boot off the USB stick to run the installer,
then you boot from the device you installed to.

One that is expected to provide bootstrap information every time the
machine starts up.

Not relevant.

You have most certainly 'touched' the Windows drive. All of those boot
off the same physical device, but from different partitions.

I can't do that because drivers need to be loaded to recognize the
drives as a RAID1 pair before any information there is usable. So I have
to boot a kernel off another device (the USB stick in question), load
the drivers, then mount the RAID device and make it the new root.

Does this make more sense?

Subject: [PLUG] FC 9 startx Problems
Message-ID: <4857CDD5.4030100@gisnet.com>

Having received no responses from my local LUG on this problem I thought 
I'd bounce it off you experts here and see if anyone has suggestions 
about how to debug this one...

I recently installed Fedora Core 9 and let it load everything for server 
and desktop. However the X11 server failed to start, so it booted up in 
text mode. When I tried startx I got this error:

error setting MTRR (base = 0xe2000000, size = 0x05000000, type = 1)

Fatal server error:
no screens found
giving up.
xinit:  Connection refused (errno 111):  unable to connect to X server
xinit:  No such process (errno 3):  unexpected signal 2.

I checked wiki.x.org and found the page referencing the error "Screen(s) 
found, but none have a usable configuration", but it said nothing about 
the "error setting MTRR" problem, and I don't understand what it means 
by "invalid argument (22)", either. Neither argument equals 22, nor are 
there 22 arguments. I tried asking the Internet's oracle, but found no 
relevant googlhits on these errors.

The monitor (which worked fine in FC6) is a NEC MultiSync 4DS.

Any ideas what I should try? Or configuration files to examine? I'm more 
used to being a Linux user rather than an accomplished system administrator.

TIA,

Bill,

   This is the first place to look: /etc/X11/xorg.conf (if Fedora puts
xorg.conf in that directory, otherwise where it's located.) In there you'll
find a screen section; mine's like this:

Section "Screen"
     Identifier     "Regular Screen"
     Device         "nVidia GeForce 6150"
     Monitor        "Acer LCD"
     DefaultDepth    24
     SubSection     "Display"
         Viewport    0 0
         Virtual     1440 900
         Depth       24
         Modes      "1440x900" "1280x1024" "1152x864" "1024x768"
     EndSubSection
EndSection

   You also need the "Monitor" and "Device" Sections; be sure the names are
consistent among the Sections.

   Let us know what you find.

I'll forward Keith's suggestion to Ali Briggs at Free Geek.  She is (or was)
the Community
Outreach contact, under whose auspices PLUG's facilities use falls.   She'll
know the
ropes on this kind of request.

Alternative USB:  Storing the distro library on John's USB drive:

A1) Advantage: John knows how to do this, and is willing to do the work.

A2) Advantage: Nothing to negotiate with free geek.

A3) Disadvantage: The number of distros would be limited to what fits
    on the 60GB drive.  That is actually not very many, especially if
    some are DVD distros (we will see more of those in the future).

A4) Disadvantage: John might forget to bring the drive, or might lose
    it, or drop it.  Back to square one.

A5) We would be burning most of the CDs at the Clinic on John's laptop.
    There are better uses for his time.


Alternative Server:  Distro library on a server at Free Geek:

B1) Advantage: We can store a LOT more distros on a fixed server with a
    big disk.  I would like to store all the Redhats and Fedoras, Debians, 
    Ubuntus (various flavors), and OpenSUSE and Slackwares, in time.

B2) Advantage: We can make potentially it an update mirror, also.  Ubuntu
    likes to do updates, and it would save a lot of bandwidth if we could
    do that locally.

B3) Advantage:  Mucho bandwidth.  The local network is faster than a USB
    link.  Desktop/server hard drives are faster than notebook drives.

B4) Everybody can access it, we aren't tying up John's laptop.

B5) Advantage:  We can set up a partially automated process, using a 
    wiki page as a request page, to download more distros.

B6) Neutral:  We will still be downloading stuff, probably more stuff
    than the burst of activity during the clinic, but we can run the
    downloads during slack times at night.

B7) Disadvantage:  It will be running continuously, consuming power and
    space and needing some maintenance.

B8) Disadvantage:  We will need permission from Free Geek, and there
    will be folks that want to change/control what we do.

B9) Disadvantage:  It will be somewhat harder to set up the process
    and the "add a distro" process will need a maintainer.

B10)Disadvantage:  It may be difficult to set up the mirror and 
    update process to seamlessly work with standard Ubuntu and yum
    update mirror selection processes.

B11)Disadvantage:  It will cost a few hundred dollars for drives.
    I imagine we can get the rest of the hardware from Free Geek.
    

I hope that makes my proposal a little more understandable.  Again, we
can do the initial load on the local network at PSU from their local
mirrors.

Subject: [PLUG] Configuring Cyrus-SASL
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0806170843440.11116@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   It's time to upgrade Postfix from the ancient 2.3.6 to the current 2.5.2.
In preparation for doing this I want to tune SMTP AUTH. Postfix supports
cyrus-sasl, and the latest production version (2.1.22) is installed here.
However, I'm embarrassed to write, I never actively configured SASL. Now's
the time to configure cyrus before I do the postfix upgrade, and I'd
appreciate suggestions from you professional network admins on which choices
would be most appropriate.

   Postfix must be using saslauthd by default and authenticating using
/etc/shadow. But, I cannot prove that because when I telnet to the mail
server's port 25 and send 'EHLO client.domain.tld', no AUTH interface is
returned.

   According to Hildebrandt and Koetter's "The Book of Postfix," I can select
among various SMTP AUTH mechanisms, methods, and backends.

   This is a small site with two local users and a handful of aliases,
running linux. No Microsoft or Apple. Pine and Thunderchicken are the MUAs
in use here.

   Among the SMTP AUTH mechanisms, the most likely choices include
CRAM-MD5/DIGEST-MD5, EXTERNAL, GSSAPI, OTP, PLAIN/LOGIN, and SRP. The book
recommends PLAIN, LOGIN, and CRAM-MD5 for a mixed OS environment.

   The two authentication methods are:
 	saslauthd (used with only PLAIN and LOGIN, and the apparent default
 	since I have /usr/sbin/saslauthd).

 	auxprop (which can use plugged-in tools such as sasldb2 and
 	postgres).

   The authentication backends supported include: imap, kerberos, ldap, pam,
passwd/shadow, sasldb2, and sql.

   Pine supports CRAM-MD5, GSSAPI, Kerberos4, LOGIN, and PLAIN. Thunderbird
is not in their table 15-1.

Thanks Rich,

I don't seem to have a "Monitor" section, and the Device and Screen 
sections look pretty "generic". I'm suspicious that a screen setting of 
"screen 0 0" is a non-starter, but I'm not sure that this is the problem 
nor what to do about it, Here's what my xorg.conf says:

Section "ServerLayout"
        Identifier     "Default Layout"
        Screen      0  "Screen0" 0 0
        InputDevice    "Keyboard0" "CoreKeyboard"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
# keyboard added by rhpxl
        Identifier  "Keyboard0"
        Driver      "kbd"
        Option      "XkbModel" "pc105"
        Option      "XkbLayout" "us"
EndSection

Section "Device"
        Identifier  "Videocard0"
        Driver      "savage"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
        Identifier "Screen0"
        Device     "Videocard0"

        SubSection "Display"
                Viewport   0 0
                Depth     24

EndSection

Bill,

   Yes, they do look generic.

   I always give my devices non-default names so I know that I tuned that
section.

   You need to dig out your NEC monitor manual to get the sync frequencies,
and look at the amount of vRAM on your card.

   I'll send a copy of my xorg.conf so you have a model to follow
(attachments not allowed on the list).

No, it is a USB drive, so distros can be burned from anyone's computer
as long as it has a USB 2.0 port.

It is now morning and my brain is sort of functioning again. (Sort of
is the best it gets.) 

I now remember that I also have a 160 GB USB drive that I have not used
for years. It is the size of a thick hard bound book and needs a wall
wart. Not as convenient as my little shirt pocket 60 GB drive, but
still eminently portable.

The Nec 4ds monitor is old enough that it will not autoconfigure.  You
need to actually have information on the monitor itself.

Do you have the xorg.conf from the old system?

Sort of.  Yes, all the Linux installs boot off different partitions on
the same drive, the external USB drive.  But the Windows installation
is on a completely separate drive, the internal SATA drive.  Remove
the USB drive and there is only Windows.  Remove the internal drive
and plug in the USB drive, and there are only the different Linux
installs.

I can also boot Windows from grub on the USB drive by dropping to a
grub command line and typing this:

map (hd0) (hd1)
map (hd1) (hd0)
rootnoverify (hd1,0)
makeactive
chainloader +1
boot

Once Windows starts booting, I can unplug the USB drive.

Makes perfect sense.  And is doable.  The instructions in my first
post get you about 90% of the way there.  After that add the kernel to
the USB stick and an appropriate stanza in the menu.lst file.

Get a ____ GB drive to replace it (at whatever the sweet spot is at
the time), and/or RMA it and reload the images from PSU or some other
fast connection.

It doesn't seem like this would really necessitate backups aside from
what's needed to rebuild the OS / synchronization "stuff", which
should be on the order of MB.  All the ISOs are readily available from
many on-line sources and this isn't a mission-critical machine.

Kind of overkill.

How many distros/versions do we need?  Figure 3-4 gigs for each distro.
10 distros are only 40-45 gigs at most.  You could fit ~100 distro disc
images on a 500gig drive.  I can't believe you need over 100 distro
images on line at any given point.

My laptop has a 320 gig drive in it and has a dvd burner.  I guess I
need to dedicate a bit of space and bring blanks to the meetings.

750gigs is overkill.

We keep needing old distros, for people with old systems that don't
upgrade well.  I figure 750GB is overkill in June 2008, too, but we
are going to see lots of DVD-sized distros in the future.  We may
also want to maintain upgrade mirrors for some distros.  The cost
difference between 750GB and 500GB is small, while the inconvenience
of moving up in size is large.

I remember when I spent $2000 for a 600MB (M not G) drive, and thinking
it was all I would ever need.

CentOS 4 and 5, with updates, in i386 and x86_64 flavors only, takes 
up 21 gigs of space on my local mirror.

To my way of thinking, making updates available locally will cut down 
on bandwidth consumption just as much local base repos -- because who 
wants to walk away with an unpatched machine?

Hello,

I just wanted to mention that if you plan on attending and would like to
try to get some IPv6 connectivity for your Linux laptop, I'll be trying
to help folks out with that toward the end of the talk.

cheers,

And build a custom initrd with a linuxrc script that loads drivers,
mounts the RAID device, and runs pivot_root. 

Thanks for your help.

Well, if someone wants to donate an external USB 500+ gig drive, i am
willing to keep the mirrors updated over my DSL line.  I can also add
images of various distros from my archives.  (I don't throw anything
away.)

OK.  If that's what you need to do for your Linux distro, then that's
what you need to do.  For me all I need to do is tell grub where the
kernel and initrd are.

If they are on the internal drive, then grub's root becomes (hd1,1)
(Linux happens to be on /dev/sda2 on my desktop):

title           Ubuntu, kernel on internal drive
root            (hd1,1)
kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.22-14-server root=/dev/sda2 ro quiet splash
initrd          /boot/initrd.img-2.6.22-14-server

If I copy the kernel and initrd to /boot/ on the USB drive, then
grub's root becomes (hd0,0):

title           Ubuntu, kernel on USB drive
root            (hd0,0)
kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.22-14-server root=/dev/sda2 ro quiet splash
initrd          /boot/initrd.img-2.6.22-14-server

What's key is that the root= parameter points to the root filesystem,
which may be the same as or different from where the kernel is.
Notice that it remained unchanged.

In both cases, I can unplug the USB drive once I get a login screen
(probably earlier).

Regards,
- Robert

If your IT department doesn't configure your Windoze computer correctly,
it can ruin your life.  Of course, this can happen with Linux, too, but
you have to work at it.

Damn.  I am going to miss this due to a weekly meeting of the Personal
Telco Project at Civic Stadium (corporate tools call it PGE Park).  We
are checking out coverage in the stadium from our newly renovated node
across the street.  Also maybe eating overpriced peanuts and drinking
overpriced beer.

What makes the story compelling is the quick rush to judgment by the
employer.  In that kind of environment it does not matter what
operating system you are using.

"Employer judgement" is a bit of an oxymoron, like "govermnent
organization".  How many of you are lucky enough to work in a place
where competent IT professionals are occupying the decision-making
positions?  I've only seen it in pure coding shops.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux Clinic Distro Download Page
Message-ID: <20080618154114.GA7151@gate.kl-ic.com>


http://www.pdxlinux.org/wiki/PlugDistros

In preparation for downloading a bunch of distros for the Clinic,
either to a Free Geek Mirror or to John Jordan's USB drive, I started
a list on the PLUG wiki to facilitate downloading.  You can edit the
Wiki page and add things you want to see downloaded.  Eventually we will
set up a bot that does the downloads automatically, but for now this
helps a human being find the Linux or BSD distros you want.

I seeded it with some possible needs, but it needs a lot more filling
in.  I would prefer we use the PSU mirror where we can, but some
distros are only available elsewhere.  For now, .iso files only; 
later on, we can add update mirrors to a separate page.

This is not a popularity contest.  These distros will be for 
Clinic/Freegeek use only;  we won't be serving them outside of
the Freegeek intranet.  If you aren't coming to the clinic to use
one of these downloads, then please don't put it on the list and
create unnecessary work for somebody else.  If you want to proselytize
your favorite distro, come to the clinic and do it in person, or do
it on the mailing list.

And if you can't be bothered to learn how to use the wiki, we
can't be bothered to download your distro for you.  This page is
to make it easier for us to help you, and we expect you to do some
of the helping yourself.

Keith

I used to have such a job in academia.  the director of my department
was a techie in a former life who'd become facilities manager and
finally director by doing all the crap that nobody wanted to do until
she was in effect running the place and was finally promoted to a
position that had official responsibility commensurate with the work.

we were without doubt the best run department from a tech point of
view in the huge (75,000 employee+student) university.

i miss that job.

Hi Tony!

I passed your message along to the Technocrats committee.  They're the techy
folks who deal with that kind of stuff.  If there's no response from them in
a week or so, please shoot me an email and I'll poke them about it.

Be well,

Subject: [PLUG] email best practices
Message-ID: <ae2db4620806180953y24236decud248e33d2581a19c@mail.gmail.com>

hey folks,

i'm coming from a 12-year background of using sendmail to handle mail
for single domains which have always been trivial to administer:  the
domain name is valid, entirely managed by me, is hosted on the IP from
which mail comes, and that IP resolves to the domain in question.

in my new job, we are hosting many domains on a single machine (and
IP), so the reverse resolution is no longer correct.  our web apps
need to send mail (largely receipts for purchases) from domain.com
when we do not control or host domain.com--clients just have
www.theirdomain.com pointing to our server, and often lack expertise
to run a mailserver that will route mail from us appropriately (and we
don't want to get into the business of managing their mailserver).

so my question is;

what's the best practice for sending mail from a machine which does
not match up DNSwise with the necessary sending (From: address)
domain?  obviously, we could just spoof it, and eventually get
blacklisted or at least dropped into spamboxes.  we'd like to avoid
that =)

i am open to all kinds of solutions, but unfortunately, sending from
ourdomain.com is right out, since the clients wish to appear to be
doing everything on their own.  we can do things like get the domain
owner to set up SPF records.

i am willing to do research, i'm just not sure what to research.
could you point me in the right direction?

SQL-Ledger (version 2.8.14), but fail to log in. There's a server error.

I also had to make a new softlink for /usr/lib/libpq.so.4. Then I restarted
(rather than stopping and starting) httpd. Now the errors are:

Did you make a text dump of your database before you upgraded? I think 
you need to do that.

Bill,

   Yes, I used pg_dumpall to write out all the data, and read it back in to
the new version. Using psql I can look at all data tables. But, that has
nothing to do with the httpd issue. It's a failure in the perl login script
that a module upgrade apparently did not fix.

From .4 to .so?

Something in the DBD::Pg install or the perl lib paths has gone wrong.  
Dynaloader is the package which loads compiled (XS) extensions and it 
is not happy.

  perl -e 'print "$_\n" for(@INC);'

You may have more than one DBD/Pg.pm somewhere in those directories.  
Searching for "object version undef" might yield some instructions.

What is on line 85?

That's too bad.  Well for those who are interested and can't make it

Hi, Eric!

   Yes, there was a complaint about not finding /usr/lib/libpq.so.4, so I
looked and found both .3 and .5. I pointed .4 at the parent for the .5
library.

   Aha! Didn't think to look for that ...

   This may be the problem:

[root at salmo ~/]# find / -name Pg.pm
/opt/DBD-Pg-1.49/blib/lib/DBD/Pg.pm
/opt/DBD-Pg-1.49/Pg.pm
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/i486-linux/DBD/Pg.pm
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/i486-linux/Bundle/DBD/Pg.pm
/root/.cpan/build/DBD-Pg-2.8.1-xp7ihj/lib/Bundle/DBD/Pg.pm
/root/.cpan/build/DBD-Pg-2.8.1-xp7ihj/blib/lib/DBD/Pg.pm
/root/.cpan/build/DBD-Pg-2.8.1-xp7ihj/blib/lib/Bundle/DBD/Pg.pm
/root/.cpan/build/DBD-Pg-2.8.1-xp7ihj/Pg.pm
/root/.cpan/build/DBD-Pg-1.49/blib/lib/DBD/Pg.pm
/root/.cpan/build/DBD-Pg-1.49/Pg.pm

   The version in /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/i486-linux/DBD is
141926 2008-06-11 16:12 /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/i486-linux/DBD/Pg.pm

while the version below that (in the Bundle/ directory) is
544 2008-06-10 10:37 /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/i486-linux/Bundle/DBD/Pg.pm

That is quite a size difference between the two.

   How do I remove the 1.49 version so only the 2.8.1 version remains? And,
is that most likely the problem?

require "$form{path}/$script";

   A Google search shows that DBD::Pg-2.0.0 was released last February.
However, that's not what CPAN found for me. Should I go look for that, then
figure out how to build it here?

   Belay that. CPAN found and built 2.8.1. Why it's not working when I remove
the 1.4.9 I don't know.

Subject: [PLUG] Dirvish on Debian
Message-ID: <485991AC.3010304@gmail.com>

I have a installation of dirvish that's working great except that it 
doesn't delete old backups.

If I run dirvish-expire it just returns immediately.
If I run dirvish-expire --vault <vault name> it will start deleting all 
the outdated backups.  The main dirvish cronjob seems to run 
dirvish-expire without any arguments so this seems to be he root cause. 
  I know that last year it was deleting old files, but now it seems to 
have stopped.

This is my master.conf file....

Message-ID: <da2207740806181907w13e9d54cl2c03b40b6d43c9e4@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Not quite sure how to search for this kind of error, I tried to Google a bit
but nothing relevant comes up (can't think of way to describe it in a
google-ish phrase).

So here is my big weird dilemma- capital "C" doesn't work with either shift
key, only with caps lock on.  Lowercase "c" works (obviously) and shift
works with any other letter.
My first guess is some strange config file mess up where it is capturing
shift-c for something else, not sure what though.
The only thing I can think of changing recently in regards to key combos is
compiz.

I just checked console mode (ctrl-alt-f1) and shift-c works there OK, so it
is an X issue.  (Yes I've tried restarting X)

So while I go digging through the compiz options manager again does anyone
have any other ideas where to look?  Any obvious ~/.[configname] files or
something?

Setup:
Fedora 9 x86_64,  2.6.25.6-55.fc9.x86_64, AMD64 3200, 1GB RAM, Geforce
6600GT (using nvidia blob driver), SBLive, 120GB HDD for Linux.

Keyboard is a regular PS2 Memorex, and PS2 Logitech mouse.  Haven't seen
this kind of thing before in other Fedoras (been using them since FC1, and
RH before that since about 5.0).

TIA

Hmm.

The one in Bundle/ is actually Bundle::DBD::Pg -- a totally different 
module, so the size difference is to be expected.

Searching the '/' filesystem tells you something, but not what you need 
to know because not all of those directories are in the search path.

Well, what matters is what order they're in in your @INC, if the .so is 
there, and whether having it linked to the .5 is ok.

  cd /tmp/ # because . might be in @INC
  find $(perl -e 'print "$_\n" for(@INC)') -iname Pg.so
  find $(perl -e 'print "$_\n" for(@INC)') -iname Pg.pm

If you installed it with the cpan client, it should have passed the 
tests - so presumably it built correctly.  If you didn't get any error 
messages during the install, I have to guess that the .pm and .so got 
into the wrong locations or something.

If it didn't pass the tests before the install, well...

Eric,

   I see. As root, I ran 'perl -MCPAN -e shell;' then asked it to install
DBD::Pg. More on this below.

   Now this is the really interesting part. Yesterday's first attempt threw
errors and suggested that I force the installation. I did. That's when I
discovered the server errors while trying to log in to SQL-Ledger.

   This morning I removed
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/i486-linux/DBD/Pg.pm, and re-ran the CPAN
client. The response was that the module was up to date, so I ran it again
with the 'force' option ... with much better results!

"All tests successful, 3 tests and 15 subtests skipped."

   And I can now successfully log in to SL.

   The initial installation was apparently broken, and removing the Pg.pm and
forcing a re-compilation of the source did the trick.

   Thank you very much for making your expertise available to me. I learned a
lot, and was guided to the solution.

Much appreciated,

Rich

Matt,

   So it's not a hardware failure.

   What do you have in ~/.Xmodmap? That's the X Window System equivalent of
~/.keymap. Perhaps a key reassignment in the former was made while you
weren't watching.

   None of this is relevant, as you wrote above, it's an issue with X.

Right, it works OK in console (and that _other_ OS)

I don't have a ~/.Xmodmap.  /etc/X11/Xmodmap is present and looks normal,
nothing about shift-c.
Anywhere else I could be looking?
I haven't found anything in compiz or emerald configs (GUI settings manager)

I know just covering all the bases ;)
(In case it could be something weird with NVidia blob or etc)

   Distributions apparently look for it in different filesystems.

   Nothing comes to mind. But, just to clarify: where do you see the
inability to type C using the shift key? In a virtual console? In specific
applications? In every application/environment when X is running?

   I'm wondering if it's specific or universal.

that's how I'd investigate, too.  narrow down the circumstances or
find the most general way of describing the problem.  so far you've
got "it only happens in Xwin", as far as i can tell.  so start slicing
and dicing =)

what happens in a different window manager, or no window manager? (do
something like put a lonely "xterm" in your ~/.xinitrc or
~/.xsession).  what happens when running as another user?

Ah! good idea.  Gnome and KDE both do some "weird" things with
keyboard configs, and could conceivably trigger bugs somewhere else in
the pipeline.  (eg: you can usually swap caps-lock and ctrl keys, I
believe there is also an option to swap it with shift, in gnome at
least.)  It's probably worth digging through the keyboard
configuration for your desktop manager.

Huzzah I found it.
It was in the Compiz settings, under one of the special sections, the "draw
fire on screen" section, for some strange reason I bound the "clear screen"
option to shift-C (yes it works now!) instead of a dual-meta control combo
like usual (like control-shift-C).  I fixed it and now everything is hunky
dory.
Thanks for the ideas guys.
I figured it was some boneheaded thing I tinkered with just wasn't sure
what.

Now it's off to the surgery room, I just got some new hardware to upgrade
(more on that later, hopefully it all goes well).
I've done this before, upgraded the hw without reinstalling the OS's, and of
course Linux faired better than Winders, but they both got through it OK.
Last time it was an Athlon XP 32bit 2200, to my current Athlon 64 3200.
Both motherboards were Gigabyte, with VIA chipsets.
Now I'm going to Athlon 64x2 5200, Gigabyte mobo with AMD chipset.  They
were also all accompanied by video card upgrades (NVidia 4400something to
6600GT, and now an 8800GT).

I can C the light now.
Oh say can you C.
C what you've done?
C:\>DOS.  C:\>DOS RUN... RUN DOS RUN....     <BSOD>
I can C clearly now the rain is gone...

OK I'm done ;)

This reminds me of conversations I've seen recently on border searches 
of laptops. I suppose it would be an idea to have a separate Linux 
partition on a drive that only loads if you have the USB flash drive 
inserted with the boot loader. Otherwise Windows loads. A tad 
inconvenient if Linux is the primary OS, always having to keep the USB 
stick with you an all. But it's an interesting idea.

the post I saw recently on this mentioned that sometimes they make copies of
the whole hard drive. Not much to protect against that, other than really
good encryption... but once They have a copy of your data to hack away at,
it's only a matter of time.

Subject: [PLUG] openSuSE 11
Message-ID: <485C6CB3.1030806@cesmail.net>

In short, I like it! I have this aging Compaq Presario that's 
dual-booted with Windows. I used to have Gentoo on the Linux side, but 
the machine sat powered off for a couple of months, so I decided to 
rebuild it.

I put Fedora 9 on it a couple of days after the release, and most 
everything seemed OK, although a week or so ago, I couldn't get it to 
sync up with an LCD projector. So this morning, I decided to put 
openSuSE 11 on it.

The install is blazingly fast -- about 15 minutes. But the real thing 
that impressed me is that it saw my Belkin USB wireless adapter when it 
booted up! So I am going to keep it. :)

In an endeavor to continue getting distro downloads I am trying to get Slax 12.1. For the life of me I cannot fine the .iso file. I can file all kinds of folders on all kinds of http and ftp mirros labeled 12.1, but inside I find everything but an .iso. Clearly I have misunderstood something.

Subject: [PLUG] What's Up With This Weird .gvfs Directory?
Message-ID: <485CFC34.60106@gisnet.com>

I've recently installed Fedora Core 9 and I'm now dealing with little 
system upchucks here and there. I'm getting an error in my logs that 
says "df: `/root/.gvfs': Transport endpoint is not connected". So I 
looked into root's directory and when I ls -al, I get the following:

ls: cannot access .gvfs: Transport endpoint is not connected
total 236
drwxr-x--- 25 root root  4096 2008-06-21 06:39 .
drwxr-xr-x 22 root root  4096 2008-06-18 14:10 ..
. . .
d?????????  ? ?    ?        ?                ? .gvfs
. . .

(The ". . ." would be replaced by the normal files listing.) 
Furthermore, I can't do anything with this directory. I can't cd or rm 
-r  it, nor chmod, nor even 'ls .gvfs'.

I've also got it in my normal user accounts, too.

What is it and how do I get rid of it?

                http://slackware.osuosl.org/slackware-12.1-iso/

   Slackware is now distributed on 6 disks rather than the former 4 disks.

   Disk 1:	Core of the distribution
   Disk 2:	KDE/TeX
   Disk 3:	More basic installation, KEDI (Internationalized), Extra
 		Packages
   Disk 4:	Source code
   Disk 5:	Slackware Book, /pasture (deprecated stuff), source,
 		/testing (new stuff not yet part of the core distribution)
   Disk 6:	Source code

   I install from 1, 2, and 3. I use 4 when I want to rebuild a package with
different options (e.g., adding mechanisms to cyrus-sasl); modify the
configure options in the .SlackBuild script and rebuild the application.

Foundthis: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GVFS

Not totally sure if it's related, but it probably is.

Also try doing a "mount" command and see if anything interesting shows up.

OK, I had already found that link. I know what an .md5 file is.
And .asc is an extension either for an ASCII file or an Autodesk export
file. Where is the .iso file? Or a torrent link for it?

That looks like it. I also had a crash with Nautilus when I logged into 
Gnome this AM, and pulseaudio has been whining to the logs for a while 
now too. And when I first set up this installation I had lots of trouble 
with the X server not working until I got a more modern monitor. 
According to your reference above, all these seem to be related. Except 
that my version of .gvfs looks even more screwed up than what people 
have reported in that ref.

This fixes the weird permissions:
fusermount -u ~/.gvfs

But then when I logged out and logged back in again Gnome announced that 
the power settings were not installed correctly and that  I should 
contact an administrator. (uh oh...)

Then the menu panel on the desktop came up missing. Good grief! This is 
getting to look and feel too much like Windows! @#$*!!

OK, half an hour later I've now learned lots about building Gnome menus, 
and things seem to be back to normal again. Also the weird settings for 
.gvfs seem to be cured now too. I think I'll stop messing with this 
problem now. I've got others that need attention...

   Every Slackware package (*.tgz) has a description (*.asc) and a md5sum to
validate the correctness of the package file (*.md5). The OSUOSL site has,
at the top of the ISO page a file called README.1st. It is reproduced here:

"If you're reading this on ftp.slackware.com, you will find that the ISO
images are not here.  This is because we simply don't have the bandwidth at
ftp.slackware.com to provide ISO images. ISO downloads take a long time, and
block people from retrieving small updates.

"If you're looking to download the ISO, consider using BitTorrent. If there
are active torrents available, information may be found on on
http://slackware.com.  BitTorrent is available as a package for Slackware in
the /extra directory.

"Mirror sites may also have the ISO images up for FTP.

"Use the .asc files here to verify your ISO images are authentic."

   I don't torrent bits so I've no idea how to do that, And, I've no idea
where the huge files might be found since my upgrades come in the boxed set.

Yeah, I did that. In fact, I had already been at /getslack. But when
you are at /getslack you find a list of a couple dozen mirror sites.
When you go to one of the mirror sites you get an Index of
Pub/Slackware, one of which is a /slackware-12.1 folder. In that folder
you find

I tried each of the [DIR] folders above, but each one contained
multiple additional folders. I don't know how deep I have to go to find
the ISO file, but I gave up after 15 minutes. And bear in mind that
there are a couple dozen mirrors, all of which seem to have the same
directory structure without a clear way to find the ISO. Searching
every folder on every mirror site would take hours.

Normally there is an .iso file, plus an .md5 file, and .torrent file.
The torrent file is only a couple K as it just contains information
that your torrent client needs in order to download the .iso while
sharing it with other down- and uploaders. You download the .torrent
file and then open it in your torrent client program (Bittorrent,
Ktorrent, Azureus, etc.).

I don't know where Slackware buried the torrent and ISO files, but I
give up looking for them.

Subject: [PLUG] kubuntu 8.04 setup problem(s)
Message-ID: <485CBF71.30306@dslnorthwest.net>

Hi,

After my failed attempt to upgrade from 7.04 to 7.10 (very long, sad story), I 
have (with a lot of help from Keith) installed 8.04.  Now I am trying to set 
things up back to where they were before leaving 7.04.

First: web links in Thunderbird do not launch Firefox.  I fixed this by 
installing the "Support for Gnome in Mozilla Thunderbird".  I did this because I 
saw another user had and solved this problem doing so.  But there are about 20 
modules associated with "Support for Gnome...", and I thought the K in Kubuntu 
stood for KDE.  Anybody really know what the issue is?

Second:  Changes (at least some of them) I make to System Settings (a GUI in 
KDE) seem not to have any effect. (Yes, I did restart X.  Also rebooted.)  I 
have changed the double mouse click value out to 1.5 seconds, and I still have 
trouble getting a doubleclick to launch a new window in Thunderbird.  It works, 
but I have to put in effort to get my finger to click fast enough.  I have 
googled for this problem, but have come up dry.  Ideas?  I remember a couple of 
years ago finding that System Settings did not save the power saving settings. 
This is a similar problem.  Where is the basic data stored?

Third:  Not sure yet, but based upon recent history, there will be a third.

Thanks for any suggestions.

-Denis

More--found kcmshell gets to the individual modules system settings uses. 
kcmshell mouse opens the same dialog I get with system settings.  I tried kdesu 
kcmshell mouse, still it does not seem to change anything.  But I did notice 
that the values of the settings displayed appeared different than those 
displayed using system settings.  So I am about to try restarting to see if 
changes take effect then.

No dice.  I changed the number of lines a wheel click moves to 9, but it still 
moves 3.  This is dumb.  Why have a module which the system ignores?

New information. Error message. Does it contain a clue that someone here can 
decipher?

parents at r2d3:~$ kdesu kcmshell mouse
passprompt


DCOPClient::attachInternal. Attach failed Could not open network socket

kbuildsycoca running...

The module launched, and showed the changes I had entered, but no changes in 
behavior.

I learned long ago that overseas sites are a good bet.  I like Australia,
Germany,
Sweden.  I know the distribution home web sites say something like "Please
select the site nearest you", but sometimes ya gotta go where the action is.
Try these:
ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/unix/linux/mirrors/slackware/slackware-12.0-iso/
ftp://mirror.switch.ch/mirror/slackware/slackware-12.1-iso/

John,

Looking at your directory listing, I would have to say that that
_is_ the .iso.  That is to say, that entire directory structure is
what goes onto the DVD.  Assuming you are using an FTP client, I would
be willing to bet that an 'ls -R' would give you the _entire_ distro
listing.  I suppose you could download it that way; most FTP clients
will do recursive downloads these days.  One advantage to that method
is that the FTP client will also resume a download if it gets
interrupted.  No need to re-download everything you've already got, or
select files by hand.  (I've done that.  Bleah.)  On the other hand,
you'd have to download everything to a (large) temporary directory,
from which you could build a .iso image.  A bittorrent or jigdo download
would be simpler.

Dale

First, I suspected that the myriad files on these sites is really the
ISO. But if Slackware expects users to know how to compile those files
into a live CD or DVD, they didn't count on people like me. Now, I'll
bet someone will say "it's so easy, you just ...." Fine. If it's so
easy, why couldn't Slack people have made the files into ISOs.

In fairness, I think the problem is only 12.1. For previous versions I
have found ISOs all ready to download.

Regarding the links offered by Bruce and Tony, they do seem to have the
ISOs. However, now I need to figure out what "d1" to "d6" refer to.

The 12.1 DVD is only available via bittorrent except for a couple mirrors in
Europe who's admin's compiled the dvd and put it up for http/ftp download.

I couldn't find the torrents, but the straight download is plenty fast
enough.

I didn't grasp the "d#" because I have a CD of Slackware 5.1 and the
whole thing is on just one CD. You can load the whole thing into RAM if
you have enough memory. It didn't occur to me that Slackware had gotten
so big.

Any Linux or security dudes in town this weekend/Monday and wanna meet
up?  Or does anyone know of some related events going on?  Looking
forward to meeting some Portland Linux people.  Actually, I was
looking for Kevin Karwaski, who I used to go to school with, but
haven't heard back from him yet.  I love Portland.  The city and
culture is so raw and beautiful.  My phone is 567 237 4237 is you
would rather get me over phone.  Thanks!!!  :-)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0806221336020.32496@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   This has been an interesting thread, and will certainly result in a useful
resource for many people. In light of this (and an off-list dialog about
distributions with someone unhappy with his present installation) brings up
a thought: why not augment the available distribution list with a sentence
or two that describes the distribution's philosophy, intended market, and
similar information.

   For example, which distributions are aimed more for the enterprise, small
business, home office, or personal use? Of course, all can be adapted to
each type, but some seem to be aimed more toward one market than the rest.
Which stress the CLI and which the GUI? Which seems oriented more toward
life on servers, and which more toward life on desktops? Are some better
suited for business, others for schools, and still others for homes? Et
cetera.

   If there are those wondering what distribution to choose in a particular
setting, such information might make the choice easier and more confident.

   This information might be worth putting on the web site.

Well, about help on sound? Amarok reports "xine was unable to initialize any

I found this one entry in a log:

Looks like the command "file" should do it for you ...

More, in hopes that SOMEONE will have some ideas:

My last bout with sound inspired me to document some stuff.  At that time (an 
earlier kernel), I got:

modinfo emu10k1

This time, (kernel 2.6.24-16-generic) I get:

Instead, I find:

This is a very interesting idea. 

My first thought is that someone has surely already done this. But
maybe not. I know of one site that I use myself a lot:

http://www.livecdlist.com/?pick=All&showonly=All&sort=&sm=1

The Live CD list above is not exactly the same thing, however. 

One problem with this idea is that there are a great many distros. The
idea is rather massive. Might it not be better if it were a public wiki
type site with open editing by anyone. Yes, I know - the best thing
about a wiki is that anyone can edit it, and the worst thing about a
wiki is that anyone can edit it. In my experience, the more control the
creators of the wiki exercise the less the wiki is used by the public.
Also the more rapidly the wiki goes out of date, since no one ever
seems to take the time to update it. A wiki that is completely open
sounds like a better idea, even if some of the facts sometimes are
wrong. The public will correct errors, even if sometimes not very
tactfully.

In addition to a writeup about what audience the distro aims at it
might be useful to have a popularity index. And another index might be
drivers and compatibility.

Basically I like the idea, but I think its implementation needs some
discussion.

   Then it should be limited to the distributions that will be made available
at FreeGeek. As these are the choices offered to folks from a local source
(with installation and tuning help available at the clinics), that's all the
coverage needed.

   This might be of interest to some:

     <http://www.linuxjournal.com/video/almost-9-distros-almost-6-minutes>

Shawn Powers shows a few seconds of each of several linux distributions (all
running KDE) and describes selected differences/features of each. Seems to
me the focus is on the desktop and appearance with the target audience being
the less technically sophisticated user (or those supporting such users).

   That's quite interesting and useful, Larry. Perhaps the URL should go on
the wiki.

Subject: [PLUG] Printer Issue
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0806231008190.665@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I originally posted this to the xubuntu users mail list yesterday, but
have seen no responses. Posting on the Xfce mail list elicited one response
suggesting I use the browser interface to manage printers, but that made no
difference; the darn message box keeps popping up and won't stay away.

   Perhaps a ubuntu guru here has some ideas of what I can do.

   Not long ago I moved the hard drive from an IBM ThinkPad 600E to a Toshiba
Tecra 8000, and made the adjustments for the hardware differences.
Xubuntu-7.10 was installed then (and it is being upgraded to -8.04 as I
write).

   After the move to a different portable, my wife discovered that a message
box continually pops up in the upper left corner of the screen with the
message:

"Not connected?
"Printer laser5_duplex may not be connected."

   This is the expected situation, since the printer is off, and a network
node rather than directly connected to a workstation or server.

   I have not discovered how to make this message dialog stay away when it's
closed; it almost immediately re-appears.

   I've looked at /etc/cups/printers.conf and it's the same on the laptop as
it is on the workstations and servers. I've not discovered where this
message dialog might be generated.

   Suggestions appreciated.

Unless it's self-describing (like XML), this is an impossible task,
although you can "guess".

A file is just a sequence of bytes.  Bytes don't have "character sets".

I can't seem to make it output a character set, I get mime types and 
type of file but no character sets (ie: windows-1250 or utf-8) - does 
your file command determine character sets?

thanks,
Brent

   man file shows no option to reveal the character set used to display the
file.

There's also Distrowatch.com, although it is an advertising-supported

Well, if you're looking for something that's more than a blog, or a 
forum, you might look at Moodle. You need a MySQL database, Apache and 
PHP, but just about everyone has that.

I've got a CentOS 5 machine running with openldap for authentication. 
  It's mostly working, but I'm puzzled as to why passwords are being 
saved in crypt form.  I used authconfig to select ldap and md5, yet 
when I use passwd to change a password the corresponding ldap entry 
looks like userPassword: {crypt}...  This is true regardless of 
whether root or a normal user changes the password.  Any ideas as to 
what I'm doing wrong?

Also, I'm still not clear on the distinction between /etc/ldap.conf 
and /etc/openldap/ldap.conf.

   Well, I also asked on the ubuntu forum site, and there's still no
response. So, let me ask where I could look in the xubuntu system for the
cause of this perpetual message box.

   In /etc/cups/printers.conf the status of the printer is 'processing' even
though it is turned off and the print queue is empty. Using the browser
interface I tried changing the status of the printer (it was stopped and not
accepting jobs), saved that configuration, then went back to printers.conf

How does one go about finding the source of windows being displayed by the
window manager? In Windows I can open the Task Manager and it will give me a
list of open windows, in which I can right-click a specific window and there
is a Go To Process option. What is the equivalent in Linux or X Windows?

Once you determine the specific process that is spawning the window, we can
check the source to determine what causes it to spawn that window, and see
if we can figure out what's triggering it with your specific situation.

   The same way one hears the sound of one hand clapping.

   It turns out that looking at Administration->Settings->Printer displays
the Local (I presume local network) printers by default. I had not looked at
the Server tab. D'oh!

   Changing the server location from localhost to the socket fixed the
problem.

   In retrospect it was a communications issue: I read "Local" and "Server"
and "Status" and applied a meaning other whan what the Xfce folks meant by
those terms. When I saw the "Local" printer with the socket address I
assumed that the laptop knen were the printer was located. But, no. The
server address did not match the local printer ipp address by default; I had
to manually match them to resolve the problem.

Thanks for the thoughts, Wes,

Rich

i'd use some combination of xlsclients, xprop, and xwininfo.

depending on the type of popup, it may not work if the window's not a
persistent window.  still, good thinking, and worth a try!

I don't know the answer, but I know where to find someone who probably
does. There is a very active CUPS mailing list here:

And in my .emacs

Galen,

Not sure about the password hash type problem, but:

/etc/ldap.conf configures nss_ldap/pam_ldap.
/etc/openldap/ldap.conf configures the OpenLDAP clients (ldapsearch,
ldapadd, etc).

Probably nothing. Are the first 3 letters of the crypted password '$1$'?
If so, then it's using MD5 hashing rather than DES hashing (crypt(3)),
just like it would if it were in /etc/shadow. This form is for
compatibility with existing systems that already understand BSD-style
MD5 hashes in the shadow NSS database. You get MD5-hashed passwords in
both cases of '{crypt}$1$' and '{MD5}'.

/etc/ldap.conf is for {nss,pam}_ldap, which are low-level loadable
modules used system-wide.

/etc/openldap/ldap.conf is for the LDAP client libraries, in particular
the OpenLDAP command-line utilities, such as ldapsearch (but any client
that uses the OpenLDAP client libraries is affected by their settings).

Because it's not optional, it's just part of the description:

$ file test
test: ASCII English text
$ vim test (here I add a Unicode character)
$ file test
test: UTF-8 Unicode English text

That said, file(1) doesn't look at the whole file and as Randal said, if
it's not specified as it is in XML, it's just a guess.

My file(1) is the stock with Fedora 9; 4.23 from
http://www.darwinsys.com/file/.

Unfortunately I can't deal with just the bytes, I must 
slice/dice/spindle/mutilate these files of unknown character sets.

A guess is good enough, my editor is somehow able to guess the character 
set of files that I open in it with some accuracy it seems.  So it seems 
that it's a task that somebody has done before; it'd be awesome if that 
same, or even significantly crappier guessing power was available in a 
command line tool and not only in a java gui.

XML files can self describe all they want but it doesn't mean the self 
description is correct.  My desire to find something is because of 
several thousand xml files that I have which are self described as utf-8 
but some of which are really encoded in windows-1250 (thanks shitty CMS 
software!)

It's not a problem when you stay within the 7 bit ascii limits but when 
they start throwing in trademark, registration, curly quotes, em dashes, 
en dashes, ellipsis, etc, characters it makes the xml parser we're using 
puke.

Thanks for the information, my file is version 4.21 which does not tell

Drupal is easy to set up and has quite a lot of nice features.  It 
doesn't do forums very well, phpBB is much better for that.  It also 
provides RSS feeds of all the pages (nodes), and a nice RSS aggregator also.

 From a statistical/security standpoint, you'll find that different  
pieces of software have different vulnerability track records.

Drupal's is mentioned in 120 CVE's. Wordpress has 143. Geeklog has  
22. Nucleus has 6. Moodle has 39.

I use NIST as one (of many) reference points when looking at F/OSS  
projects: http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm

How you *interpret* those numbers is up to you. My personal choice is  
to not install, or use, Wordpress or Drupal, as the benefits offered  
were far outweighed by the risks involved, and a horrific track  
record always leaves me a tad shy. It was easier for me to hand-build  
HTML pages than spend a ton of time patching oft-exploited software,  
especially for content that was only truly "dynamic" once or twice a  
day... :)

   Where do folks keep their Elisp files (*.el) so they're not removed
during upgrades? I'm assuming that /usr/share/emacs/lisp/ is replace in its

specific apps that I'd like to retain.

Gang,

Does anyone out there used XP in a Virtual setting regularly?

I am planning on upgrading my primary computer (new HW) which currently runs
XP to Linux with XP running in a virtual environment.

What I want to know is what limitations there are, say with HW devices etc.

I have two XP instances. The first is the XP Home that came with my 
Presario 2110US, which occupies 15 GB of a 55 GB hard drive. The other 
40 GB recently got converted from Fedora 9 to openSUSE 11. On that 
machine, Windows is virtually unusable because of the slow laptop disk 
drive. I've tried defrags and lots of other stuff but most of the time, 
I just boot the thing up in Linux. BTW, the Linux filesystem is XFS 
except for /boot, which is ext2.

The other instance is an XP Pro running as a 1 GB guest with two 
processors on a 4 GB Athlon64 X2 5200+. The host OS is Gentoo Linux and 
the hypervisor is VMware Workstation 6. This Windows instance is very 
usable. I have not attempted to do anything with the sound card, and I 
don't have any other peripherals of a special nature.

I have not tried other virtualizers on the Athlon X2, nor do I plan to. 
If I were to buy a new laptop, I would most likely convert it to Linux 
(throwing away an existing Vista) and attempt to run my current Windows 
XP Pro instance on it under an open-source virtualizer first, and if 
that didn't work, move my VMware Workstation license and the Windows XP 
Pro instance to it. I'm also seriously considering nuking the XP Home 
part of the current laptop and making it Linux only.

Very likely, those files are just latin-1, where the default for XML

I've been trying out Drupal,Wordpress,Nucleus,etc. My host has them all ready 
to go on cpanel. Do you (or anyone else) have an opinion on b2evolution? I've 
read that its  CVEs are in the low single digits too.

I like Movable Type.  I've found it somewhat easier to deal with than
Word Press, particularly when it comes to writing content.  MT seems
to keep the un-parsed text for each post/page around, so you can edit
it with whatever syntax you wrote it in in the first place (say,
markdown, textile, etc..).  MT works like a wiki in this regard, while
Word Press just seems to make the conversion to html immediately, and
I can't stand the visual editor (for either platform, really).

That may have changed though, and there are many more themes/skins
available for word press.

I have an XP virtual server running 24/7 under virtualbox.  i don't
use sound (haven't tried, would probably need some config to get it
working), but i do some fairly funky things with the screen settings
and it works a-ok.  resize/redepthify/screen-capture is pretty much
this VM's full-time mission (i run a private instance of
www.browsershots.org with about 12 different versions of IE and
firefox installed), and it executes flawlessly.  also occasionally use
IE to visit the one website i use that i can't hack around in opera,
but that's definitely a rare usage.

i haven't used other virtualization software in the past 7 years (did
use vmware back around 2001), so i don't have much of a point for
comparison.

i've been using 32-bit XP Pro under VirtualBox on 64-bit Ubuntu (Fiesty 
through Hardy) for a few reasons:

- TurboTax
- Quicken
- IE for the many sites that *still* break under Firefox (TicketBastard, 
er, TicketMaster, is one i use regularly, yet another reason to disklike 
Paule Allen, but i digress...)
- Running an ancient version of Symantec Act until i find or build a 
reasonable replacement contact manager (anyone have a script handy for 
converting CSV or tab-delimited files to Evolution .vcf's?)
- Synching the excellent SplashID to my ancient Handspring Visor until i 
can find a way to synch my KeePass data

My machine is a Core 2 Duo laptop w/4 GB RAM, with ReiserFS. i'm 
satisfied with XP in VirtualBox to the point of reformatting the 
partition with Vista Ultimate on it to get the space back (Vista 
Ultimate + Office 2007 Pro = >40 GB of disk suckage).

XP is very well-behaved in this environment, and performance is 
excellent. Quicken and TurboTax run better than they do on Vista, 
without a doubt. i find configuring VirtualBox much easier than VMWare, 
although the docs are a bit thin in places. Configuring USB devices is a 
bit tricky - especially my Visor, which is visible on the bus only when 
it's trying to synch. Networking is great (i configured it for bridge 
mode so i can use my home lan transparently), making my other partitions 
visible to the XP environment is a snap. Audio works fine, with the 
minor annoyance that VirtualBox hogs the audio - i can have have audio 
*either* from Windows or Ubuntu, but not both. Screen-resizing is great, 
and VirtualBox offers a "seamless" window mode in which the XP windows 
can coexist with the Linux apps (kinda like Parallels on the Mac), 
although XP taskbar positioning can make switching between XP and Linux 
apps less than seamless - but it sure looks cool (in a perverse sort of 
way) to see IE side-by-side with native Linux apps...

I've checked out all the platforms mentioned and I've settled on Nucleus. I 
like the look and feel of if and it has a good security record. Thanks for 
the input, guys.

Subject: [PLUG] VSFTP & Firewalls
Message-ID: <4862C006.3090908@gisnet.com>

I'm trying to figure out a firewall for my FC9 system, but I'm having 
trouble with vsftpd. When I put my shields up, I can ftp to this machine 
from another Linux machine on my LAN. It connects in "Passive" mode, but 
I can't get it to do anything until I switch to active mode.Then it 
seems to work fine.

My Windows XP machine refuses to connect to it via FTP at all. But when 
I drop the firewall, it connects and works just fine. I've read 
vsftpd.conf man file, but didn't understand much of it, and my firewall 
script used to work fine before I loaded FC9. So I'm not sure why 
passive mode on my Linux machine just sits and does nothing or why my 
Windows machine can't connect when my firewall is running. Here's the 
firewall script:

#! /bin/bash
#
# clean out everything first
iptables -F
iptables -X
iptables -Z

# Drop anything coming in that we don't explicitly allow, but
# allow anything going out.
iptables --policy INPUT DROP
iptables --policy OUTPUT ACCEPT
iptables --policy FORWARD DROP

# Allow unlimited incoming traffic on the loopback interface.
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT

# allow people to ping us
iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT

# Allow any *established* connection packets through
iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

# Allow the following services
#     port 22 ssh
#     port 80 web
#     port 443 secure web
#     port 21 ftp

iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 443 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 21 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT

# drop any sources of known noise (Windows) without logging
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 135  -j DROP
iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 137:139  -j DROP
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 445  -j DROP            # Windows SMB
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 1433  -j DROP           # MS SQL server
iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 1024:1026  -j DROP      # IM spam
iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 5353  -j DROP           # iTunes searcher

# log everything else
# iptables -A INPUT -j LOG --log-prefix " **DEFAULT-INPUT** "


Can someone explain what causes this behavior or what I should read to 
find out ?
TIA,

I had similar problems when I setup VSFTPD to use SSL (on Fedora 9).
The Netfilter connection trackers couldn't follow the PORT commands.
My workaround was to:

1) Use these rules to allow FTP service in my
    'iptables' script:

      $iptables -t filter -A tcp_check  -p $proto_tcp  --dport $p_ftp       -j ACCEPT
      $iptables -t filter -A tcp_check  -p $proto_tcp  --dport 12800:12809  -j ACCEPT

    where:
      iptables="/sbin/iptables"
      p_ftp=21
      proto_tcp=6
      (... and, since it's a low-use server, the 10 port numbers
           12800:12809 were just randomly picked out of mid-air.)

2) Make the FTP server passive, and limit the ports it can use by
    putting these lines in /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf:

       #
       # PASV
       pasv_enable=YES
       pasv_min_port=12800
       pasv_max_port=12899


Hope that helps.

Joe,

You have my attention with your reply.
I would be interested in the following information:
 * How was your XP virtual machine generated?  Did you:
    o Install XP from CD   or
    o Convert an existing install into a virtual environment

I also would be very interested in the what was needed to configure your
Linux environment to allow the smooth integration you are claiming.

I plan to be running on a 32-bit Linux on a quad processor.  
I've currently got 3 Gb of RAM.  I know XP can't use a full 4 Gb, can Linux?

If you would like to take this discussion off line, that is fine with me.

i've been using 32-bit XP Pro under VirtualBox on 64-bit Ubuntu (Fiesty
through Hardy) for a few reasons:

- TurboTax
- Quicken
- IE for the many sites that *still* break under Firefox (TicketBastard, er,
TicketMaster, is one i use regularly, yet another reason to disklike Paule
Allen, but i digress...)
- Running an ancient version of Symantec Act until i find or build a
reasonable replacement contact manager (anyone have a script handy for
converting CSV or tab-delimited files to Evolution .vcf's?)
- Synching the excellent SplashID to my ancient Handspring Visor until i can
find a way to synch my KeePass data

My machine is a Core 2 Duo laptop w/4 GB RAM, with ReiserFS. i'm satisfied
with XP in VirtualBox to the point of reformatting the partition with Vista
Ultimate on it to get the space back (Vista Ultimate + Office 2007 Pro = >40
GB of disk suckage).

XP is very well-behaved in this environment, and performance is excellent.
Quicken and TurboTax run better than they do on Vista, without a doubt. i
find configuring VirtualBox much easier than VMWare, although the docs are a
bit thin in places. Configuring USB devices is a bit tricky - especially my
Visor, which is visible on the bus only when it's trying to synch.
Networking is great (i configured it for bridge mode so i can use my home
lan transparently), making my other partitions visible to the XP environment
is a snap. Audio works fine, with the minor annoyance that VirtualBox hogs
the audio - i can have have audio
*either* from Windows or Ubuntu, but not both. Screen-resizing is great, and
VirtualBox offers a "seamless" window mode in which the XP windows can
coexist with the Linux apps (kinda like Parallels on the Mac), although XP
taskbar positioning can make switching between XP and Linux apps less than
seamless - but it sure looks cool (in a perverse sort of
way) to see IE side-by-side with native Linux apps...

XP 64bit can address (read: see all of, and use) 4GB+ of physical 
memory, as well as any other 64bit OS. 32bit OS's that support PAE (as 
well as the underlying hardware and drivers) can address more than 4GB 
of physical memory as well. The limitation is part of the x86 
architecture itself. PAE merely extends the physical address space 
beyond 4GB. The 2.6 kernel and above supports PAE.

   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Address_Extension

While WinXP 32bit does support PAE, it's only because it's a requirement 
for DEP if it is enabled. The OS itself is limited by MS to only address 
a maximum of 4GB of address space, so it will never see more than 3.5GB 
(and sometimes less) of physical memory in a machine, as some of the 
address space is reserved for resources like the BIOS, peripheral cards 
and such.

Eh, sorry for the long winded response to a small part of your question. 
I've learned a lot about this recently. The above is simplified. :)

Thanks for the help Don. The passive mode issues are solved now, but I'm 
not sure about these:

   $iptables -t filter -A tcp_check  -p $proto_tcp  --dport $p_ftp       -j ACCEPT
   $iptables -t filter -A tcp_check  -p $proto_tcp  --dport 12800:12809  -j ACCEPT

Since I have no jumps to a tcp_check chain, just copying this into my 
firewall script doesn't work, and I don't know how you're using it. Can 
you explain how I'd incorporate whatever this does into my script? When 
I tried:

   $iptables -t filter -A INPUT  -p 6  --dport 21           -j ACCEPT
   $iptables -t filter -A INPUT  -p 6  --dport 12800:12809  -j ACCEPT

my Windows machine still coudn't make a connection. I also tried this SWAG:

   $iptables -t filter -A INPUT  -p tcp  --dport 21           -j ACCEPT
   $iptables -t filter -A INPUT  -p tcp  --dport 12800:12809  -j ACCEPT

and that didn't work either. At this point I'm just like a blind dog in 
a meat market stabbing at anything that smells good, but since I don't 
know what I'm looking for, I'm not seizing the steak.

I'd try adding these two lines at this point in your script:

     iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 21           -m state --state NEW  -j ACCEPT
     iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 12800:12809  -m state --state NEW  -j ACCEPT

... don't forget to do the vsftpd.conf edits, too.  (see below)

Don't forget:
   -- to add the "pasv_ ...." lines to your vsftpd.conf file.
   -- to restart (or reload?) the vsftpd service after editting
      the .conf file.
The latter item is the usual source of my own headslapping,
"doh!" uttering moments in these matters.  (Happened to me
again just yesterday, in fact.)

Apparently the info I reported in my previous message was of no value.

The present situation is that I installed Audacity and was able to get it 
functioning in both playing and recording modes.  Wonderful.  But the Amarok 
message reported above still persists.  A web search turned up the idea that it 
is a rights issue.  If I launch Amarok as su, the message does not appear. 
BUT--it still does not produce sound.  It appears to play songs, but silently. 
And visiting sites such as YouTube produces no sound either.

What additional information would be helpful in getting these silent players 
their voice?

You are correct.  I might have figured it out for myself had I be able 
to see the actual hash.  As I now know, the ldap userPassword value is 
base64 encoded.  For those who are interested, a disabled/invalid 
password entry might look like this:

userPassword:: e2NyeXB0fXg=

# echo -n e2NyeXB0fXg= | base64 -d
{crypt}x

This is a sort of shot in the dark, but it sounds like Amarok and Xine and
flash plugin might not have all the needed codecs to play restricted format
files.
You didn't mention if you are playing MP3 or OGG or ?  If it is MP3, the
default programs that come with Ubuntu/Kubuntu are neutered and can't play
them.
There is also the issue of different flash plugins available (gnash,
svf-plugin I think, and then adobe flash non-free).
Check the Ubuntu forums on where to go to get the restricted format codecs
and players (Audacity for ex. has a separate .deb installer for MP3 and
other plugins, audacity-plugins-nonfree or similar), mainly you have to
enable the universe and multiverse repositories.

Before this post I was going to ask if you tried a different program, and it
looks like Audacity works, so it isn't a hardware issue.  So it is either a
configuration issue or a restricted format codecs issue probably.

Interesting idea.  And it could be a contributor to the problems.  But could it 
explain the absence of system sounds?  They wouldn't be so silly as to make them 
proprietary...

What kind of configuration issue could it be?  How might I investigate it?

Eric,

   What's wrong with regular colors? Do they need to be odd colors just
because this is Portland?

The regular colors have all been outsourced to Elbonia and I couldn't 
find a US manufacturer which made orso colors, so I figured the odd 
ones would fit best.

(So, did you want yours in "weird black" or "oddball white"?)

   The latter. I'm an oddball, not a weird. Too old to be weird.

   Do you have a curmudgeonly puce? I'd much prefer that color, or cynical
drab.

   Thanks, Eric! What a great sport you are.

Subject: [PLUG] Can iptables Block a Range of IPs?
Message-ID: <20080628133835.GA20469@www.gisnet.com>

I just set up a database and mapping server (running FC 9) and it seems to
have instantly attracted the attention of the Chinese hackers. They're
trying brute-force login attempts through ssh2, and the busy little
nippleheads seem to spend all night at it.

This anti-social behavior really annoys me, and I'd like to "block China"
from accessing my site. 

I looked at iptables and it looks like 

iptables -A INPUT -s ###.###.###.### -j DROP

will block any IP I put in place of the ###'s, but is there a way to
specify a range (such as using CIDR notation)? Entering hundreds of
individual IPs is not an option for me.


I also looked at creating blocks of IPs in hosts.deny, but doesn't that 
only affect web traffic? Does ssh look at that file?

What is the best way to stop these attacks or render them ineffectual?

Try denyhosts. It works through hosts.deny and there is a centralized 
server you can use to download offending IPs automatically.

There's also a whitelist feature that works well.

something like:
nnn.nnn.nnn.0/24 for class C
or nnn.0.0.0/8 for class A, etc
I also log the action with:
iptables -A INPUT -s $IP -j LOG --log-prefix "IPTABLES DROPPED"
so I can see who/how often I am dropping.

remember to save the iptables list after modification or it will be lost 
on restart.  iptables-save > <somepath>iptables.conf
then in /etc/network/if-up.d (or wherever):

#!/bin/sh
iptables-restore < <somepath>IPtables.conf >> /etc/network/if-up.d/iptables
chmod +x /etc/network/if-up.d/iptables

Yes, iptables accepts CIDR notation. The iptables(8) man page has the 
syntax.

Or you could use shorewall, which makes messing with rules quite easy.

Thanks for the help on this, but as I was adding rules to block all of 
China, it occurred to me that there might be too many address ranges to 
block and maybe this approach is not the best. I've added just these:

# Block hackers from China
IP=202.99.0.0/20
iptables -A INPUT -s $IP -j LOG --log-prefix "IPTABLES DROPPED"
iptables -A INPUT -s $IP -j DROP
IP=219.151.0.0/21
iptables -A INPUT -s $IP -j LOG --log-prefix "IPTABLES DROPPED"
iptables -A INPUT -s $IP -j DROP
IP=202.102.0.0/16
iptables -A INPUT -s $IP -j LOG --log-prefix "IPTABLES DROPPED"
iptables -A INPUT -s $IP -j DROP

# Bloxk hackers from Taiwan
IP=61.66.206.0/26
iptables -A INPUT -s $IP -j LOG --log-prefix "IPTABLES DROPPED"
iptables -A INPUT -s $IP -j DROP

# Block hackers from India
IP=203.197.0.0/16
iptables -A INPUT -s $IP -j LOG --log-prefix "IPTABLES DROPPED"
iptables -A INPUT -s $IP -j DROP
IP=210.212.204.32/31
iptables -A INPUT -s $IP -j LOG --log-prefix "IPTABLES DROPPED"
iptables -A INPUT -s $IP -j DROP


But if I try to add all the possibilities, I wonder if legitimate 
traffic would ever be able to get through all this screening? Is this 
approach worth the effort, or can I make it more efficient?

For instance, jerks from these addresses all tried to use brute force 
methods to try to guess passwords on various account names. Is there 
some way to detect when the same IP is trying to log in and failing, say 
more than 3 times per minute, and then automatically banning them for 10 
minutes (or even forever)?

It seems to me that there are obvious patterns to many attacks, and I 
was wondering if there's any tools available that can recognize them and 
do something about it as it's happening. One of these guys banged away 
for nearly 1200 guesses before he gave up, but in hockey, the more shots 
on goal you take, the more you're going to score, and I guess it's the 
same in hacking. I'm looking for a good goalie script!

Yes. The following has worked well for me. It allows three SSH (port
22) connections per minute, beginning with (and including) a
three-connection "burst". It drastically reduces the size of your
auth.log files. The second rule allows unlimited connections from the
local network.

  -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT 
  -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT 
  -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m limit --limit 3/min --limit-burst 3 -j ACCEPT 
  -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j DROP 

The following rules do the same thing for HTTP (port 80) connections:

  -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT 
  -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT 
  -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -m state --state NEW -m limit --limit 3/sec -j ACCEPT 
  -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j DROP

As previously suggested, you want the denyhosts package.

Subject: [PLUG] http / curl data decoding problem
Message-ID: <034e01c8da2a$6b626030$fce5a8c0@qlaptop2>

Hello,

We're experiencing an annoying problem and hope someone out here has a suggestion. 

Background: we're trying to load a series of settings into a black-box device that's hooked up via ethernet to our embedded pc running a slack distro under a 2.4.23 kernel.  This black-box device is normally set up manually via html, using the built-in server / GUI that's accessable via e.g. Firefox. If you do the setup that way, everything works fine.  However, we are trying to do the html setup in batch using a script that's using CURL to emulate the actions of the Firefox browser. No matter what we try, we can't quite get the batch setup process to "take"

I think we could readily troubleshoot this problem if we could easily compare the HTML data to and from the black-box when we're using Firefox, to the HTML data to and from the black box when we're using CURL.  We've tried tcpdump and the output is not only asyncronous, but comes in a very unfriendly format with all sort of un-wanted "extra" stuff that makes the result quite difficult to parse and decipher.   My question - is there a tool that we could install on our embedded PC that would let us monitor (and store for later analysis) these HTML strings / data packets in a user-friendly and human-readable form?

Thanks!

Tom Sharples

I'll echo Sean's suggestion - denyhosts does exactly what you've just
described... http://denyhosts.net/. It's what I use and works very well.

Capture whole packets with tcpdump[1], load the result into wireshark[2] and
filter away the traffic you don't care about.

[1] tcpdump -i <iface> -s 1500 -w /tmp/capture.pcap
[2] wireshark capture.pcap

That sort of depends on what you're trying to emulate.  If the process 
uses AJAX, there would be various posts and replies involved and 
possibly a lot of state accumulating on the server.  If it's a simple 
form, then one post request should suffice -- except that you might 
need to login and have a cookie if it doesn't do standard http auth.

If the request/response contents aren't fairly obvious from viewing the 
html source, something like firebug or an http proxy (can squid do 
this?) might give more readable output than tcpdump.

You might want to try curl's -D switch to see if the response header 
tells you what is wrong, but I would be working in Perl with 
LWP::UserAgent (which includes the handy POST program and seems to have 
more http-specific diagnostics than curl.)

curl is only one of many, many HTTP clients out there.  There are a
whole class of clients that are implemented as libraries that expose
their APIs to the code you write.  These are available for just about
every language.  My favorite is drama, a common lisp ASDF library.  To
use it: fire up a lisp image, load the drakma library with
  
  (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'drakma)

and call drakma's `http-request' function to make an HTTP request and
get back a response.

  http://www.weitz.de/drakma/#http-request

I have used drakma interactively from the lisp REPL to pick apart very
complex Oracle Collaboration Suite web pages (heavy on the faces and,
therefore, AJAX) with amazing ease.  The ability to read the response
body makes it as good as wireshark for this kind of work; the ability
to fashion any request you like makes it exponentially more powerful.

Any HTTP client library can give you this power.  But a lisp library
lets you use it in full force from an interactive prompt.  This speeds
up iterations by a factor of 10 at least.

Here's an example usage.  This calls http://www.google.com/.  Fire up
an ASDF-capable lisp like SBCL, and then type the following 3 forms at
the REPL:

CL-USER> (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'drakma)
CL-USER> (in-package :drakma)
DRAKMA> (let ((cookie-jar (make-instance 'cookie-jar)))
          (http-request "http://www.google.com/"
                        :method :get
                        :cookie-jar cookie-jar))

I have had mixed results with denyhosts.  When it works, it works well.
It seems to stop working after a while and I have to restart it.  I
suspect it has problems with log rotation.

I need to just set it to restart once a week via cron.

Subject: [PLUG] OT ReactOS 0.3.5 is out...
Message-ID: <20080630214128.saqt5k068kk0kgcw@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

It seems to be far more stable than the last release, but there is clearly
a lot missing, i.e.: user accounts, sound, etcetera.  Some of the software
packages, firefox and openoffice, have been dropped for the time being.
I suppose the networking implementation isn't ready yet.  Diablo II seems
to work better, I have not experienced as many crashes.

Better late than never.  Maybe it's time to help this project out.   
After all, there are some things Windows isn't being replaced for  
evidenced by the number
of people who run it under emulation.  If ReactOS improves enough to  
support TurboTax and Quicken, it will be possible for the first time  
to run these
programs without paying Microsoft for a copy of Windows.  Imagine  
being able to run your favorite proprietary Windows program in a  
GPL'ed OS.  Imagine a Windows XP compatible OS that isn't as bloated.

I'd like to see disk checking implemented and I'd like to see the  
installer improved so that complex partitioning is possible.

Okay, anyone know how to address this?  I'm running Slackware 10.1 on a PII
with 64 megs of ram connected via a Realtek 8180 to a Linksys WAP11  
which is hooked to a Linux gateway running Slackware 10.1.

Google hasn't turned up anything.

I don't think this really gives enough information -- googling for
"Disconnecting: Bad packet length" does turn up a bunch of results
that look relevant, but the most obvious cause seems to be related to
ssh version mismatches that may not be an issue today.

I'd advise that you disable root logins over ssh, and/or use sudo, but
that's probably not relevant to the disconnecting issue.
