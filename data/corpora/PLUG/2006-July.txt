Most consumer broadband routers have a features which proxies DNS.
Typically your router will use DHCP to get an address from your ISP.
This DHCP reply comes with the IP address, mask, default gateway, and a
couple DNS servers.

Your router will then take any DNS request received on its internal
interface and send it to the DNS addresses it received from DHCP,
relaying the reply back to the internal host.

Anyone had a chance to take V5.0 for a test drive?

I already did it, burned the ISP, and had it with me at the last
Clinic. I don't know when it came out, though.

Is it possible to mount other drives with it? E.g., can it be used as a
rescue disk?

Yes, Knoppix is often used as a rescue disk and can mount other drives.
v5.0.1 came out on June 2.

Didn't it offer to install a desktop? When I did that (with Sarge) I got
both KDE and Gnome on top of X. I forget whether it came up with GDM or
KDM, though.

In any event, I think all you need to do is type

# apt-get install gnome

from a command window as "root".

This is what I get..


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

host:/etc/ssh# apt-get install gnome
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.

Since you only requested a single operation it is extremely likely that
the package is simply not installable and a bug report against
that package should be filed.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies.
  gnome: Depends: gnome-desktop-environment (= 1:2.12.3) but it is not going
to be installed
         Depends: rhythmbox (>= 0.9.2) but it is not going to be installed
E: Broken packages

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@2



Should I try to install gnome-desktop-environment?

TIA

Vram,

Try doing this (in bold):

1. nano /etc/apt/sources.list
    Step
    a. change stable to unstable
    b. put a # at the beginning of the line that indicates "security"
    this will prevent some 404 errors
 
2. *apt-get install xutils mdetect*
    (should give no errors

3. *apt-get install x-window-system*
    should give no errors, although I recieved an error that said
    could not get a package from the server
    I reran the command and successfully recieved the packages

4. *startx *(if x starts install a window manager like gdm or kde)
    **This is where I experienced the the configuration error
    **The screen goes black and comes back to the terminal with the error
    **Please note that if Xorg is not set up correctly startx will not work

5. *apt-get install gdm*
    (no expected errors)

6. *apt-get install gnome* or what ever desktop environment

7. apt-get install apt-buglists <<VERY IMPORTANT>>

**** You are now finished setting up the desktop reboot your system or 
type startx ****

 >>>> BUT YOU MAY WISH TO DO THE FOLLOWING NOW SO YOU DO NOT FORGET<<<<   

8. apt-get -f install apt-file synaptic
9. apt-file update

apt-file search (missing package)



Issues that I experienced:
    configuring the mouse: I had two options ImPS/2 and ExplorerPS/2
        *neither configuration worked
    resolved by:
        nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
        scroll down to the input device type
        find the "Device"
        change the value from /dev/input/mice to /dev/psaux

   
STARTING ISSUES:
    issue:        My mouse would jump all over the place after my system 
came up.
    resolution:    I ran apt-get -f install kernel-image-2.6-686
    cleanup:    *NOT NECCESARY* use synaptic package manager to remove 
the old kernel image
       
    issue:        My mouse is a big ugly block
    resolution:    installed a mouse theme and applied it.

##########################this is what I get


marvin:/etc/apt# apt-get install gnome
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.

Since you only requested a single operation it is extremely likely that
the package is simply not installable and a bug report against
that package should be filed.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies.
  gnome: Depends: gnome-desktop-environment (= 1:2.12.3) but it is not going
to be installed
         Depends: rhythmbox (>= 0.9.2) but it is not going to be installed
E: Broken packages


##############

so If i go on ... It just keep complaining about broken deps....

I can't install rhythmbox...

Depends!!!

TIA

Vram

I'd recommend filing the bug as the message suggests. "Etch" is
testing-level software, so you are now a tester. Welcome aboard! :)

Or if you're in a hurry to get up and running, load "sarge" or Ubuntu.

Subject: [PLUG] Thunar File Manager
Message-ID: <20060703073307.8bcc3e7b.johnxj@comcast.net>

WRT previous discussions about file managers here, Thunar is a relatively new file manager for XFCE that I just discovered. Installs fine with Synaptic on Ubuntu-64 Dapper. Opens instantly, tree on the left, drag and drop works the way I expect it to (e.g., recursive for folders), lean, simple, and is not a web browser wannabe.

An interesting feature is that you can program "actions" that will appear in a context menu when you right-click on a file. For example, you could create a action that will open a file in gedit by entering the command "gedit %F" in the window where you create the action. There are examples in the Thunar wiki, so even a n00bie can figure out some things. You can also add an action to the toolbar.

It also comes with an archive function -- just select some files and you can archive them easily with a couple mouse clicks.

Missing: A search function. It does have a "select by pattern" function (also a "bulk rename" function for renaming based on a pattern), but the "select by pattern" function just selects the files wherever they happen to be. They are not displayed conveniently in a separate window or pane. 

It also doesn't have an automatic way to mount network shares. E.g., it can't see my Windows desktop over the ethernet. However, I suspect I can make it do so; if I can figure out the syntax. Perhaps a mount point with "smb-something."

Another thing that would be handy is to have it ask for a root password if you want to do something that requires root privileges, e.g., move a file owned by root. Again, perhaps eventually I could figure out how to do this with an action. In the meantime, I have two menu commands to launch it, one of which launches it as root. 

It is so fast and easy to use that it has already become my favorite.

Subject: [PLUG] Upgrading to Dapper
Message-ID: <44A9605B.8040102@verizon.net>

I recently had a few minutes and tried to install Dapper on my 933 dully 
w/1.5 gig of memory.  I have dedicated a hard drive to the install.  The 
machine is a dual boot and runs Breezy without problems.

For some reason I am unable to burn an ISO image to CD these days.  I 
seem to get a coaster that is missing something.  My machine is very 
capable of booting from CD...but I keep burning coasters.

So for this attempt, I installed Breezy and then waited for the system 
to tell me that 6.06 was available.  I then clicked on the upgrade 
button and watched the action.  I didn't get any unreasonable messages 
during the process.  All went well and it rebooted into a working 
Dapper.  I copied some files from the Breezy hard drive to the Dapper 
hard drive, used Synaptic to install Thunderbird, and then rebooted back 
into Breezy.

Later that evening, I tried to boot into Dappper again and the system 
hung trying to put the last splash screen up showing the last modules(?) 
loading.  I had set it to auto login earlier.  So now I am looking at a 
brown screen with a usable mouse curser.  What a shame there is nothing 
to click on.

Is the auto login causing problems?

I looked at the /var/log/messages and saw lots of scary stuff I don't 
have a clue about.  I tried to attach the file to this email in the 
hopes that someone would have the time to show me where the problems 
are...and point me to the path for making this work.  I then received 
notice that my email was too big for the list.  If someone is interested 
in reviewing the file...I realize that this is a holiday 
weekend...barbecues, family, and fireworks being much more important 
than computers.

Thank you!!

Bruce

Vram,

Try using the -f option

apt-get -f install rhythmbox

It will try to force the dependencies...

Have you ran update? Do you have the desktop environment installed?

There are lots of problems with the upgrade that are discussed on the
Ubuntu Dapper forums. From your description it sounds like the problem
may be in xorg.conf. One of the big problems is with ia32-libs, which
seems to get stuck in an unrepairable loop of unmet dependencies, and
xorg seems to be one of the problems. So is OpenOffice.org. I never
could get the dependency issue resolved and ended up wiping out Breezy
and installing Dapper fresh. While trying, one thing that seemed to
resolve a lot of problems was "sudo dpkg --configure -a." (I think I
remembered that right.) You'd have to run it by booting in safe mode,
since there is something wrong with your GUI.

There is also a problem with autologin -- again. look at the forums.
Evidently it doesn't work. Bug reports have been filed. Meantime, as
far as I remember from reading the forums, users just have to login
manually until the bug is fixed. I don't recall anyone not being able
to log in at all, but it's been a while since I read that thread.

I love my new Dapper-64. Everything that I needed that didn't work on
Breezy-64 is now working, and without chroot -- Flash, Java,
RealPlayer, Adobe Reader, plus I can finally use the latest versions of
things like OpenOffice.org. The support for running 32-bit apps in
64-bit Ubuntu is vastly improved. And stuff like ndiswrapper, that used
to take half an hour of painstakingly trying to remember how I did it
last time, now installs via Synaptic with a couple mouse clicks. Dapper
comes with Broadcom wireless drivers, so lots of people don't even need
ndiswrapper any more. Dapper totally rocks!

You may also want to try some alternative window managers such as TWM,
Flux or XFCE4.  That is how i have my system configured, it always
boots to text mode only and using TWM, i just issue a startx once I
log in.

Well I liked Paul's but here is my take ( if I follow your drift. )

sub getpassdb {
   # Read password file creating usernames and
   # passwords hash.

   my %passworddb;

   local $file_passwd = "/root/firewall/var/cgi_password" ;

   open ( $INPASS, '<', $file_passwd" )
     or die "Error--unable to open $file_passwd $!" ;

   while ( my $passline = <{ $INPASS }> ) {

     chomp $passline;

     %passworddb = ( $passworddb, ( split ( '=', $passline ) ) );

     return %passworddb;
}

It will be a bit of a pig if your %passworddb hash get very big eg. 10's 
to 100's of thousands of records but is fun.

I don't think that code will compile.  At the very least you have to
close the while block.

$passworddb should be changed to %passworddb so that it will append
to the hash, and the subroutine isn't clean for a use strict.

Message-ID: <200607031233.28552.dave@dhdo.org>

Try this:

sub getpassdb { 
        my $pwdb = 'passwords';
        my %hash;
        open $infile, "<", "$pwdb";    # Always use the multiple argument open
	local $/ = '';        
        %hash = split(/\n|=/, <$infile>);
        return %hash;
}

With the data: 
user1=pass1
user2=pass2
user3=pass3
user4=pass4
user5=pass5

And when you run this code, 

my %passwordhash = getpassdb();
print join("\n", map { "$_ -> " . $passwordhash{$_} } keys %passwordhash );

you get:
dave at ampet:~$ perl test.pl
user5 -> pass5
user1 -> pass1
user4 -> pass4
user3 -> pass3
user2 -> pass2dave at ampet:~$ 



It works mainly because $/, the record seperator is set to nothing, and the 
entire file is slurped into the split(), which splits on EITHER \n or =, 
giving you an ordered list of user, passowrd, user, password, which if you 
use it as a hash, will translate to key, value, key, value.

It'll break if the source file is not well-formed, or there's unsightly 
whitespace.  Such things are left to the author to figure out.

Why use local?  You should only do that when you need to localize a 
global variable.  Further, you should not have any global variable 
names of your own.  Only use local for things like $/ (which is why the 
OP didn't get more than one line.)

  local $/;
  my $wholefile = <$filehandle>;

>? ?open ( $INPASS, '<', $file_passwd" )
>? ? ?or die "Error--unable to open $file_passwd $!" ;

open(my $INPASS, '<', $file_passwd)

my $passworddb; # put this as close as possible to where you need it
>? ?while ( my $passline = <{ $INPASS }> ) {

while ( my $passline = <$INPASS> ) {

No, Paul had the right thing happening here.  Were you trying to 
reassign the whole list with %passworddb = (%passworddb, %new_stuff) ?

The only suggestion I have for Paul is the lexical filehandle and limit 
the split with:

  my ($user, $pass) = split(/=/, $passline, 2);

>? ? ?return %passworddb;
>}

Remember.  Always follow best practices.  Even when golfing.

  use strict;use warnings; my %pw_db = sub {
  my $h;open($h,$_[0])?return(map({chomp;split(/=/,$_,2)} <$h>)):die $!
  }->($filename);

The 64-bit port in Etch may not be complete yet.  The port, until fairly 
recently, was unofficial.  It has been made official now, but there is 
still a lag getting some packages built and ported.  You might be able 
to find out the current issues by searching or browsing through 
http://lists.debian.org/debian-amd64/

Yes, that's certainly a problem, but one that I thought Freedesktop.org, 
with the xdg-menu specification, had solved:

http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/menu-spec-0.9.html

"It allows third-party software to add menu items that work for all 
desktops, and allows system administrators to edit menus in a way that 
affects all desktops."

Ambition's okay.  I just don't get what the Portland Project is doing 
that other standardization efforts aren't already doing -- in 
particular, Freedesktop.org.  Isn't your second example an example of 
mime types?  Freedesktop.org has a spec for that too.  If both KDE and 
Gnome are following the specs, then a user should be able to set 
Konqueror to launch from a click on a URL in a Gnome session email.  A 
user *should* be able to choose whatever default browser he wants from 
either KDE or Gnome, even if the browser isn't part of either project.  
It's things like that I thought Freedesktop.org was tackling.  And from 
what I've seen of the xdg-menu system, Freedesktop.org seems to be very 
effective.

Yeah.  Seems like these people would talk to each other or something.

You're right.  I was trying to pop that off while do _too_ many other 
things at the same time.  I did test the

  %passworddb = ( %passworddb, ( split ( '=', $passline ) ) );

line construct.

Message-ID: <659b9ea30607031903l6adbc24alb58a68192082d066@mail.gmail.com>

I am interested in trying to find a local hosting provider that either
offers Drupal as an installation offering on a shared server, or finding a
hosting provider that would permit SSH access so that I could install Drupal
for this client.  The 1st requirement is
that this company is local, so price is less of an issue than you might

Subject: [PLUG] Breezy
Message-ID: <44AA2304.4090706@verizon.net>

After my last post and discussion with Aaron, I started doing some 
digging in Breezy.  I just thought all was well with Breezy.  It has 
many of the same problems that my "upgraded to Dapper" has.

Aaron noticed that Dapper was only using one of my processors.  Breezy 
has the same issue.  After a little digging on the Internet, I note that 
I should probably be using the *.*.*-686-smp kernel instead of the 
2.6.12-10-386 that /var/log/messages reports.

After doing some Google work looking for a set of instructions for 
updating a kernel, I decided that one of you would most likely know 
where I could find that information.  So...

A couple of questions...
1. Do I need a new kernel or do I just need to reconfigure the one I have? 
If so, where can I find instructions for downloading an appropriate smp 
kernel, building(?), installing said kernel, and is this a safe process?
2.  How long does this process take on a PIII 933 dually working with 
half it's horsepower (I realize this is asking for a guesstimate)?
3.  If I were to dump my vision of a working Dapper until the Ubuntu CDs 
arrive in the mail box, what flavor of Linux would you all recommend for 
my second hard drive?
I had thought to install Slackware, but my 10.2 coasters are not being 
helpful (something about a corrupt or missing something or another).  I 
have a live Gentoo CD which will also install, but I read that might tax 
my knowledge of Linux.  I may try anyway...worst case scenario is format 
and start over...and can someone close to Sandy, Oregon burn the install 
disk(s) for me?

Thanks!

Bruce

use the following command.. Choose the appropiate image

 apt-cache search smp | grep smp

Post again if you still have problems

Argh.  no.  That continually recreates the hash by repeatedly deconstructing
it to a list.  That'd be like building a house, one brick at a time, by
first removing all the bricks back to the truck, adding a new brick in
the truck, then rebuilding a house.  Ouch ouch.  Expensive.

Perhaps what you want is

        my ($newkey, $newvalue) = split /=/, $passline;
        $passworddb{$newkey} = $newvalue;

Darn.  I know this.  I forgot I had used something similar where I 
wanted a pre-existing hash to overwrite another hash if the keys were 
the same.  Much smaller arrays to work with and it happened only once in 
the script.

Yup when I'm reading in lots of stuff.

Now I'll go back to my corner and work on the other stuff.

User Iam,

   How strange! Is that the response when you type -- as root -- 'hwclock?'

User Iam,

   I _thought_ there was a 'mkdev' command to make those devices, but I cannot
find a man page on my system. The only references I see on Google are for
VMware and SuSE. And most of these relate to not making the rtc module when
the kernel was built.

   The SysAdmins on the list need to step in now as I've exhausted my limited
knowledge.

Sorry,

Rich

I don't have a /dev/rtc on 2.6.6-1-k7-smp, but I do have an rtc.ko 
module.  Perhaps if you did 'modprobe rtc' hotplug or udev would make 
you a node?

I developed a response which I considered posting; one of the things I
thought an improvement over Paul's response was the use of '=' instead
of /=/ -- that is, a plain character string instead of a regex.  Isn't a
plain string faster and clearer (in that there is no possibility of it
being a regex metacharacter, since the list of regex metacharacters
seems to extend well past the memory of anyone who doesn't do Perl at
least once a week)?

Well, since I mentioned it, here's my rendition, heavily infected by
PBP:

use strict;
use warnings;
use Carp;
use English qw( -no_match_vars );
use IO::File;

my $file_passwd = 'test-pass';

#
# read_file_into_array - Reads a file and returns an array of chomp'd lines
#
sub read_file_into_array {
    my ($input_file) = @_;

    # Open file
    my $input_fh = IO::File->new($input_file, '<')
        or croak "Failure opening '$input_file': $OS_ERROR";

    # Read lines, chomp, stick into an array
    # Note that chomp happens in-place and returns the number chomped,
    #   so we actually have to return the resulting $_
    my @input_lines = map { chomp; $_; } $input_fh->getlines();

    # Close
    $input_fh->close()
        or croak "Failure closing '$input_file': $OS_ERROR";

    wantarray   ?   return @input_lines
                :   return \@input_lines
                ;
}

sub getpasswd {

    my %password_for;

    %password_for
        = map { split '=' } read_file_into_array($file_passwd);

=begin comment
    # The following is equivalent to the map line above
    # Read each line, split, stuff into hash
    for my $line (read_file_into_array($file_passwd)) {
        my ($user, $pass) = split '=', $line, 2; 
        $password_for{$user} = $pass;
    }

=cut

    # Return the hash or hash ref, depending on the calling context
    wantarray   ?   return %password_for

my %password_for = getpasswd();
my $password_for_ref = getpasswd();

use Data::Dumper;

I've been happy with acornhost at http://www.acornhost.com  The company
is local (but I'm pretty sure their a reseller).  The prices are pretty
good and they give great discounts for non-profits.  They use Red Hat
for their server and cpanel to install Drupal.  They have no SSH, which
is a bummer, but I've been pleased otherwise.

By "They have no SSH" do you mean they don't allow interactive logins 
but can use sftp?  Or that they have no way to put bulk load files on 
our website without sending your password in plain text?  The first

Yes, usually all hard disk partitions with file systems show up on the
desktop. Also, if you have mucho RAM, you can type in "knoppix toram" at
the very beginning, letting you eject the CD and mount any other CD once
it copies the contents of the CD to RAM.

It doesn't make an excellent Windows recovery tool, as you have to
wrestle with captive-ntfs before you can modify files on Windows
partitions. (Read-only access is hassle-free, though.)

Dan,

Which live distro would you recommend for data recovery?

Thanks.

The reason I asked is because I recall once using a live CD and it
wouldn't let me touch the hard drives. I just assumed it was because
they advertised "this won't touch your current OS." It might not have
been a Knoppix live CD, however. I don't recall the brand.

Install a new kernel the same way you install anything else -- using 
apt, aptitude, synaptic, Adept, or whichever tool you usually use.  You 
will have to reboot to use the new kernel.  If you use GRUB as your 
bootloader (the default in Ubuntu), it should update automatically to 
add your newly installed kernel to the boot menu.  Ubuntu should also 
leave your current kernel in place (presuming you don't remove it), 
which will serve as a backup in case something goes wrong with the new 
kernel.

If you want to build a custom kernel, that's more involved.

The nice thing about Gentoo is the documentation.  The installation 
guide is comprehensive and thorough, and the Gentoo wiki is a trove of 
information about all kinds of things related to using Linux (and not 
just Gentoo).  If you just go with the defaults, you should end up with 
sane installation.  The tweaking and optimizing can come later, if 
you're so inclined.  It might tax your knowledge of Linux (it certainly 
taxed mine), but you learn a lot in the process.

The not-so-nice thing about Gentoo for the impatient is that the 
compiling takes time.  It's not the speediest way to get up and running, 
especially if you want to use a fat desktop environment like Gnome or KDE.

Unless you are using back ports I don't believe that xorg is in sarge.  

Try:

dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86

While there are a lot of commands to tell you what is installed on your 
system, I like this one:

dpgk -l | grep [packagename]

For example, on my Kubuntu system:

$ dpkg -l | grep xserver
ii  xserver-xorg  7.0.0-0ubuntu45  the X.Org X server
ii  xserver-xorg-core    1.0.2-0ubuntu10     X.Org X server -- core server

Knowing what package name to look for is half the battle, so this page on 
debian.org is good for Real Debian users:

http://www.us.debian.org/distrib/packages

Look in 'View package lists' to browse package lists by category. Scroll down 
the page for more search options.

Subject: [PLUG] GUI Development
Message-ID: <BAY123-DAV1371E7B305DFC4AEE09B118F760@phx.gbl>

This is a software development question:

I've done GUI development in Windows using VisualC++ 6.0 (pre .NET), VisualStudio.NET (using both C++ and C#), Borland C++ Builder and NetBeans (using Java of course) - these are all IDEs. I've done lots of command line development on both Unix and Linux, but not GUI development and not using an IDE to do it with - just vi (to create/modify the source code) and makefiles. I'd like to do some GUI development in Linux, but I'm not sure where to begin. I want to create a database application (MySQL looks adequate and it's open source) using labels, push buttons, combo boxes, graphs, menus and whatever other GUI widgets I may happen to need. Also, I'm not picky about which language to use, although I do prefer the C language family like C, C++, Java, C# and Perl and I'd like to stay away from VB.

Can any of you, who have done GUI development in Linux, suggest how I might get started on this path? Maybe even point me to a web tutorial?

Part two of this question would be how would you test such an application (other than ad hoc testing, of course)?

Thanks in advance ...

      TeX is a computer language designed for use in typesetting; 
      in particular, for typesetting math and other technical 
      material.  Extremely high quality work can be done with
      TeX.  Indeed, this is TeX's niche market.

      Robin is the Executive Director of the TeX Users Group, which is
      the guiding organization for Tex.  Karl Berry is the President of
      the TeX Users Group.  Robin and Karl will describe TeX along with 
      some of it's extensions.

Hello John,

It sounds like your looking for an Open Source solution, but I suggest that
ya take a look at RealBasic.
Http://www.realbasic.com

I have used it on Linux & mac for GUI app development, and I love it.

Just a suggestion.

This is a software development question:

I've done GUI development in Windows using VisualC++ 6.0 (pre .NET),
VisualStudio.NET (using both C++ and C#), Borland C++ Builder and NetBeans
(using Java of course) - these are all IDEs. I've done lots of command line
development on both Unix and Linux, but not GUI development and not using an
IDE to do it with - just vi (to create/modify the source code) and
makefiles. I'd like to do some GUI development in Linux, but I'm not sure
where to begin. I want to create a database application (MySQL looks
adequate and it's open source) using labels, push buttons, combo boxes,
graphs, menus and whatever other GUI widgets I may happen to need. Also, I'm
not picky about which language to use, although I do prefer the C language
family like C, C++, Java, C# and Perl and I'd like to stay away from VB.

Can any of you, who have done GUI development in Linux, suggest how I might
get started on this path? Maybe even point me to a web tutorial?

Part two of this question would be how would you test such an application
(other than ad hoc testing, of course)?

Thanks in advance ...

John,

   Take a close look at wx.widgets/wx.python. It's multi-platform and python
has a large library for database, math, etc. applications.

> (other than ad hoc testing, of course)?

   Python has a unit testing capability that is worth learning.

The first Linux GUI development I did was with Trolltech QT designer.
Combo GUI/IDE.

They had some very good (sometimes too simple) examples and tutorials.

Because the QT stuff is c++ you can build a class and test the class
separate from
other things, provided you did proper class isolation.

   I've been using 'joe' as the default editor within pine for years. It's set
up to have a black background with light grey text. Worked flawlessly until
about a half-hour ago. All of a sudden, when I compose a message or reply to
one, the cursor's invisible and I have a white background with black text.

   Looking in ~/.joerc I don't see where the colors are controlled there. In
~/.pinerc colors are set as 'color-style=use-termdef'. That's not changed
since 1 July, but the colors were working just fine until a few minutes ago.

   Ideas?

Testing should be (roughly) the same under any OS, but some tips:

Java (and other lanugages, I'm sure) has a Robot class that can record
/ playback some verbatim actions at the simplest, and probably allows
for some relatively complex scripting of gui actions.  I haven't done
any of this, but I think it was built with the intent of testing and
automation.  I'd assume it's a pain in the ass, but probably better
than doing all the testing by hand every time you do a new build..

As Larry mentioned, in an OO-capable language you can create an
(extremely simple) interface for each gui widget / portion of the
interface and put all the interface-related logic into a logic class
that uses only the interface you've created to access the actual
widget.  Then implement that interface to pass calls directly through
to the real widget for your application.  At this point it is trivial
to stub the interface in testing code and verify the behavior of the
logic class, and if your interface is simple enough you can rely on
the presumed correctness of the gui toolkit.  (This is all assuming
you have access to some unit testing framework, like nunit, junit, etc
...)

For the situations where this isn't possible (custom components, for
example) keep a list of acceptance tests that must be done by hand.

You can also add a code-coverage tool, but I'm not aware of any that
do much better than line-coverage, which is arguably worse than none.
(Line coverage generates a false sense of security.)  It's probably
not a bad idea to check even line coverage of your test suite once in
a while, just to make sure you've at least tested that well -- just
don't use it as a constant measurement of your progress.

RE: toolkits, I second wxWidgets, but I can't reccomend any gui
building toolkits.  I've tried a number of them for java and met only
serious dissapointment, and I don't have experience with any others...

For what it's worth, Eclipse is the least aggrivating IDE I've used.
It has some fabulous tools for code navigation and java refactoring,
but it does not have a macro recorder...

Are those the default colors? I haven't used pine in years but I recall that
those colors seem familiar :-) Maybe make a backup of .joerc and see what
happens with a fresh copy or with the global joerc?

Drew,

   No, they're not. I just tried with the global joerc, and I get a colorful
display on a white background, but not what I had before. And, in pine, the
cursor is still AWOL.

Thanks,

   Here's some more insight: the problem is -- somehow -- related to The X
Window System. I'm writing now on a console, and the colors are correct (that
is, white on black). I've no idea what I might have inadvertently change in
the rxvt in which pine runs when X is active.

You didn't by chance recently upgrade from xorg 6.x to 7.x, did you? I
just did that on Gentoo and the location of "Rgbpath" moved. That messed
up a bunch of things. Check your "xorg.conf" and "Xorg.0.log" files.

You didn't by chance recently upgrade from xorg 6.x to 7.x, did you? I
just did that on Gentoo and the location of "Rgbpath" moved. That messed
up a bunch of things. Check your "xorg.conf" and "Xorg.0.log" files.

I like QT, which is a native C++ toolkit but has bindings for nearly all
of the major scripting languages. It works on either Linux and Windows,
is open source, and it has a "QTDesigner" tool for building
applications. If you use KDE on Linux, there are some more goodies, like
Kommander.

But the real reason I like QT is that the widgets are *prettier* than
most toolkits. :) There are a couple of lighter toolkits out there ...
the two I remember are FLTK and Fox.

Of course, if you don't mind ugly, there's GTK

That is trivial compared to how that metric treats Sendmail. Better than
three-quarters of the ones listed searching for sendmail are things
completely unrelated, that simply call their mail sending functions
"sendmail".

CVE-2005-0337 most certainly looks like Postfix's bug (that doesn't
appear to be an addon). CVE-2003-0540 as well, both within the past 3
years.

Because my view is a highly valuable one? Yes, I do make decisions in
wierd ways, but be well aware that I make reasonable decisions, though my
reasoning may not be yours. I will admit that I haven't been monitoring
the situation as closely recently, and it does look like the number of
MTA bugs has continued to head downwards.

Looks like I just pointed to two in the past 3 years. Okay, I'm using
rough estimates, sure it isn't precise but do you truely want exact
numbers for everything you do? Do you track how many hundredths of a
gallon, how many (walking) steps, and how many tenths of a second it will
take you to buy something from a store?

Is tracking http://www.debian.org/security/ (sorry about missing the
security area above) an unreasonable metric?

True. Still seems to work pretty well though. There are plenty of issues
with all the MTAs, either they're merely problems that don't effect you
or you can avoid, or they're definite problems for you. You decide
whether each problem is large enough to reject the MTA. Exim's record has
been horrible (okay, has been better recently). Postfix can't so some of
the things Sendmail can. Sendmail is a problem to configure and is a
little worse security wise than Postfix. Qmail has license issues and
needs an update for the mainstream version.

I have a policy of keeping up on security updates. Each update is an
annoyance to deal with, therefore I go for Qmail due to the very low
number of security updates.

A reasonable decision based on my evaluation of the issues I encounter.

Under Linux, I'm going to have to suggest taking a look at KDevelop -- it's 
very much like Visual Studio in the IDE department.  kdevelop3 can handle 
just about every project type you can conjure up, with just about every 
widget set or langauge out there.  

It was originally designed to be a KDE development GUI, so the C++ and Qt 
support is the "best", but it uses Kate as the text editor, and has lots of 
extra goodies, including a Visual Studio-style drag-and-drop GUI designer.

I've been using WxPerl and generating some code with WxGlade.  While the 
wx documentation is huge, things are a bit dispersed.  You'll usually 
end up in the C++ docs and/or the source.

As for WxGlade, it's not perfect, but if you tell it to generate code 
that uses your custom subclasses instead of using the widgets directly, 
you'll have a much easier time not fighting a code generator (never, 
ever touch generated code.)

  ./Build test

Mostly Test::More, though I just recently started doing some 
internalized testing of the GUI (do a require("./app.pl") and hook some 
extra events to MainFrame to run your tests.)  I've looked at 
X11::GuiTest, but this is a cross-platform app.

Ed,

   No, I didn't upgrade Xorg at all. This happened suddenly, mid-afternoon
yesterday, possibly around the time I installed FreeRock Gnome so I could try
building the latest GnuCash. But, the only applications affected are pine and
slrn. Both run in virtual consoles ... WAIT! I just saw something that is
probably the cause of the problem:

   Pine is configured to run in a rxvt window. When creating a message or
reply, the default editor is 'joe' (because after 20+ years I know the old
WordStar ctrl-<key> chords instinctively; all my editors have been configured
that way). But, when the editor opens in a window, it's an xterm, not rxvt!
A-ha! I'll bet that's it.

   Why the virtual terminal type got switched I've no idea. How to fix this is
also currently unknown to me. But, I'm certain that if I can get the editor
to open in the same terminal (rxvt) as the host application, the colors will
be as set as they were before. Perhaps related is that the cursor is still
missing in the rxvt pine window.

   Any ideas?

Thanks,

Rich

Message-ID: <44AD20A6.6080903@pacificscreening.com>

Are there any command-line utilities available that will allow one to 
modify the pitch of a sound file (wav, mp3, or pvf)?  I've got vgetty 
functioning as an answering machine for home but the pitch of everyone's 
voice is such that it sounds like they've been persuaded to accept a 
transplant of taffy for brains as a really keen idea and then call me 
telling me that they'll be about half an hour late and the pasta salad

CVE-2005-0337 was a bug in a 3rd-party IPv6 patch.
Please read the Redhat report:
http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2005-152.html
Or from Wietse on Bugtraq, if you prefer:
http://seclists.org/lists/bugtraq/2005/Feb/0070.html

CVE-2003-0540 is 35 months old, so not three years old for all of the
pedants out there. Thanks for clarifying that. It was a DoS, not
remote code execution, like the most recent Sendmail bug
(CVE-2006-0058).

Someone sent me some linguistics data in WAV file format. Turns out I

them to mp3s with lame, but I'd rather figure out what is wrong and fix
it. Any ideas what might be wrong? Or is there a better WAV file player

Depending on your distribution you might be able to try -- play myfile.wav

Thanks for the suggestion. Didn't work, but got more error messages
that might indicate what is wrong.

First, I tried playing an mp3 in RealPlayer, because I just realized
that I had not done so since installing Dapper. It always worked fine
in Breezy, but now RealPlayer gives me the same error message for mp3s
that it does for the WAV files. So something fundamental must be wrong.

Then I tried playing one of the WAV files using your suggestion, from a
terminal window. This gave me:

     sox: Can't open output file '/dev/dsp': Device or resource busy

Then I opened Nautilus and double-clicked on a WAV file. This gave me:

     There was an error identifying the audio
     i/o layer. You will not be able to play or 
     record audio.
     Error: Host error.

Meantime, sound is working fine otherwise. RealPlayer happly plays
streaming radio stations on the net. Totem plays movies just fine. The
system beeps, honks and snorts at me as usual.

I suspect a missing library. Or something else is missing.

WAV files support several different audio formats.  Try running the file
command to find out what type of file you have.  For example:

tinman$ file ej22_16.wav
ej22_16.wav: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft PCM, 16 bit, stereo 22050 Hz

A three-second Google (http://google.com) search on 'dapper .wav' returned 
this link as the very first hit:

http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=164614

I then followed the link in Jason_25's post and found the answer. Elapsed 
time: less than a minute. It's a well-documented, well-publicized Ubuntu 
issue, and there has been a mechanism in place for dealing with it for ages. 
Ubuntu installs with only Free software, and provides separate repositories 
for users who want non-Free packages. 

Dapper's habit of removing all kinds of packages on an upgrade from Breezy is 
terribly wrong behavior, but the devs don't seem to see it that way.

Sounds like they are using a proprietary codec or some sort of DRM.

What app was used to create the files?

I got:

13.wav: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft PCM, 8 bit,
mono 22050 Hz

But I'll have to spend some time learning what that means. I know

Perhaps this information would have been useful in the first post. Several others have replied, none of them hit the issue though.

Your sound device is in use, or nonexistent. (/dev/dsp) This isn't a software or library issue. You may have another application using the sound device, or no driver loaded for your audio device. Most commonly this will be sound servers, like ESound or ARTS.

Once you kill whatever is using the sound (since you can watch movies, the sound driver must work) the wave files will play. Riff wave audio requires no decoding to play, so there's no issue there.

This should help you find it.

/usr/sbin/lsof | grep /dev/dsp

Also try "ls -l /dev/dsp" and see if it is actually there.

This assumes you have lsof installed...

It could be that the module for the sound card is not getting loaded.

Ah, but you already knew there was an issue. It didn't occur to me to
do that search because I had no reason to think of it. :(

I've been using Ubuntu for over a year now, and I had no idea that my
current Dapper was missing non-free software. I had no problem in
Breezy. If I ever installed non-free stuff in Breezy to get WAV files
to play, I did it so long ago that I no longer remember doing it.
Evidently "well documented" has a different meaning for you. I
certainly have never heard of this problem before today, and I scan at
least the subject lines in new Ubuntu 64-bit forum posts regularly.

I fear I have misled you slightly. I failed to state that this is not
an upgrade from Breezy. It is a fresh install on a new partition. My
old Breezy was an upgrade from Hoary, however. And Hoary was my first
Linux. 

Unfortunately, Jason_25's solution does not work for me because he was
responding in a general forum, not the 64-bit forum. But now that I
know what to look for I am searching for the correct solution for
64-bit Dapper. So far, no luck. I note that my default Dapper-64
already had all the stuff that Jason_25's link says is needed, except
for the w32codecs, which is probably what is missing. 

Thanks for steering me in the right direction. Now that I know what to
look for I'll figure out how to get it.

   Do a Google search for 'wav2mp3' and take your pick from the 36,800 hits.
You can play mp3 files on xmms, mplayer, and whatever else.

Alan, you're a genius!

Actually I had already searched for /dev/dsp, and yes it was already
there. I noted that it was owned by root and no one else had permission
to change it, so i took possession as jjj and gave myself the right to
do anything with it. Probably not necessary, but I was trying anything.
It didn't change anything.

Meantime I went all over chasing w32codecs. Then I saw your message and
did the grep line. The only thing in the results that looked suspicious
was Firefox. So I closed Firefox, and lo and behold! Everything is
playing now!

Now that I think of it, in my old Breezy I ran 32-bit Firefox in
chroot. Hence, it didn't affect the 64-bit world where I had sound
players installed. Either that, or maybe I did't have the sound plugin
configured (can't remember). 

So now all I need to do is figure out how to make Firefox (I assume
it's a plugin) play nice with other software. Off to Ubuntu and Firefox
fora!

Thanks for sharing your genius!

Update: I relaunched Firefox, then tried RealPlayer. It's still playing
the files just fine. So now I wonder why it was blocking things before.
Maybe a tab was open on a page with sound. Dunno. I'll keep trying
RealPlayer from time to time, and if it quits working again, I'll check
what Firefox is doing. Maybe eventually I'll see a pattern that will
give me the answer.

Thanks to all who responded.

Aaarg, once again god punishes grumpiness. I missed that, plus I've been 
working with .wmv files and thought .wmv instead of wave. Sigh. Good catch.

I've never heard of GNU other than the unix acronym, perhaps you mean ENU ?

As you discovered, you don't need a special codec to play your file.  PCM
files are effectively raw ADC samples.  Any sound card can play them.

This is about as simple as a sound file can get.  After the short
header, each byte is just a speaker-position offset value.  There is
really nothing special here for an app to deal with, provided the app
has minimal support for WAV files.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0607061549500.14005@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   For those who care, I have Gnucash-1.9.8 running on Slackware-10.2. It was
pretty easy and painless, once I realized that FreeRock Gnome did not
install everything needed from the Slackware package.

   I removed the installed package and used the approach recommended by the
FreeRock Gnome folks (see the wiki entry on Slackware): use lynx and
slapt-get to get the full FreeRock Gnome distribution (it also upgrades all
other installed Slackware packages while it's at it). Took a while, but it's
all there now.

   Second step was to grab the Gnucash-1.9.8 source tarball, configure, make,
and build a slackware package with checkinstall (don't think there's a
slack-build script yet for gnucash). Then I installed the package, and up it
comes.

   The gnucash folks warn that the 1.9.x series is considered unstable beta;
the stable 2.0 is due out Real Soon Now. But, it works with Gnome2! Now I
need to learn what needs to be exported from kmymoney2 and imported into
gnucash.

   I tried really, really hard to like kmymoney2 (despite the name), but it's
far too buggy, inefficient, and dependent on the trackball for my liking.
Specifically, the date can be changed only by highlighting year, month, or
date and using the spin control or the arrow keys. Changing the month from
June to July (06 -> 07) also incremented the year from 2006 to 2007. I
didn't catch that for quite a while. Same thing happened when I changed from
May to June. The transaction type reverts to the last one used regardless of
how it's set. While the payee field is shown as one types, every payee with
the string appears, not only those beginning with that string; pressing
[Enter] doesn't select a string, it enters the incomplete transaction. To
edit, one must use the right button on the pointy device, then select edit
from the menu before making changes. And, there is more. Yes, I have
reported all these to the developers but have not received any replies.
Sigh.

   Hope this is useful to someone.

Yes, and the page you posted above works. But when I click on "English" I get a popup asking for my username and password. My bookmarks all go to *.org pages, e.g.:

http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=134 (This is the Dapper 64-bit forum)

If I change it to .com I get:

"You are seeing this page because the current domain is not configured in the current set of name servers.
This is usually just a temporary error while the domain is being added. Once the domain is configured this page will expire and your correct site will be shown."

Very strange.

Well, I'll try it from PSU in about an hour. Who knows. Maybe it's Comcast.

Obviously, it is something with your system, and not the Ubuntu forums having

Perhaps, perhaps not. I am currenly at PSU, and I am getting the same
thing.

It would be helpful if someone would try the Ubuntu forums to see if
you are able to view them. If everyone says they are working, then it
is my problem. If everyone else gets the same results, then it's
Ubuntu, not me.

Anyone?

No matter. First, at tonight's meeting several others confirmed that
the problem is Ubuntu, not me. And now, half an hour later, the forums
are back. And the web site appearance is different. Obviously an ugrade
was going on. A better error message would have been nice. :(

As Keith brought up several times tonight, our venue for the Advanced
Topics talks is going to be severely attenuated in the near future,
due to monday night football crowds or what have you.

Therefore, we are looking for some place new.  The primary
considerations are:

  a) free (or sponsored)
  b) serves beer
  c) seat about 30 people
  d) allow speakers to be heard

If you know of a possibility, please follow up here with your
suggestion (and whatever particulars you know or can find out).  Don't
self-censor, blurt out your idea.  There'll be plenty of time to weed
out the less worthy later on.

In the past, we've held the AT meeting at: a) some sports place in
Tualatin or something; b) It's a Beautiful Pizza; c) wall-of-alcohol
place; d) Jax.

To get things started, I'll suggest a place I vaguely know about (Jeme
suggested this the last time we were looking for a place):

  Mississippi Pizza (on N. Mississippi Avenue).

Let 'er rip, people.

The new Lucky Lab on NW Quimby has it all. Beer, a semi-private and
large room, food, friendly people, and best of all, it's close to home
(for me). #:)

It's only 6-7 blocks from the 23rd/Northrup streetcar stop too.

As I stated in my original post, I have shopped at ENU.  When I asked 
him about that he corrected me and stated GNU.  This was a ham radio 
conversation...crystal clear I might add.

Kurt,

   The original Lucky Lab charges for use of their private room. Do you know
their policy for use of the separate area in the new venue?

How's parking for those of us that don't like to waste time on public

Hi Burce.

	I did a google earth search for this store called "GNU" and couldn't find 
anything in Portland. That doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, of course, but 
it does mean that I don't know where it is...

There are quite a few Denny's that have both beer and partitioned 
meeting halls.... There is one in Clackamas on 82nd drive

Unless you mind walking a block or two it's fine over in that part of NW.

I thought the Monday Night football show had finished.  ABC doesn't
have NFL football
broadcast rights anymore.  Did someone else pick that up and will
start again on Monday
nights?

Unless some silver tongued devil can arrange an exception, the policy
at Lucky Lab has been "$50 if you want to close the door". 

If you are willing to walk two MORE blocks, the parking structure
in my wife's office building at 23rd and Kearney is open for public
parking in the evenings.  The parking lot is near a lot of other 
places, such as the Gypsy or the Rams Head or the Blue Moon or the
Silver Dollar.  I don't know which have free meeting rooms or the
smoking situation, though.

Does Hot Lips Pizza serve beer?  There is a meeting room in the
Ecotrust building at 721 NW Ninth Avenue, and Hot Lips is in that
building.  Also, I wonder about the meeting rooms at Kennedy 
School - are they all for rent only?

Please add "smoke free" to the list - that is, not an open door away
from the pollution section.  And parking nearby is useful if the 
venue does not have a screen and I must bring mine from my car.

I know of places out in Beaverton, but I don't want to lose the
east side and bicycle contingent;  most west siders have cars and
are more flexible.  So I prefer the core area or near east side.

Russell mentioned Mississippi Pizza - their webpage mentions "live
music 7 days a week".  How close is the sound to the meeting room?

Can we use the "open source, we're helping Portland" card to help
argue for a free space?

ESPN, I think, and still on Monday night.

Funny that they should have made such a big deal about it since both ABC 
and ESPN are owned by Disney.

Curiously enough, I seem to recall noticing such a place advertising in
Computer Bits a few years ago.  It caught my eye specifically because
its name was "GNU".  I do not, however, recall any more details, other
than a vague recognize that there was such a place, although whether it
was frequented by Sasquatch and Venutians or real people I cannot say at
this particular juncture.

Hm, ComputerBits.com seems to be gone; when did they cease publishing?

I haven't been into the new Bridgeport in NW since their renovation; it
might be worth looking into.

I don't know.

Personally I hope we can stay at Jax.

They have good food.  They have alcohol I can drink.  They are located two 
blocks from work.  They have a screen. They have space for a bunch of 
people. They don't charge us a fee for use of the place.

I don't know how much we will need to fight with sports this fall.  I will 
ask them.

Another issue for a site is "do they allow minors".  We have a few people 
who are not the legal age for legal ingestion of solvents who would like

Wil,

According to the guys at ENU they just ceased one day last year.  I used 
to enjoy reading through that one and it just "poof" was gone.  They 
must not have been able to sell enough ad space for a freebie newpaper.

I tried the same trick, and had the same results.
I seem to recall a computer store over near the eastside Costco.  I 
don't remember the name of it.  It would have been around 133rd...

Yep.  (I have a friend who writes a regular column.)

The new version is called "Computer Chips".  Same format, different 
owners. Available at many of the same locations.

They have a room and it could be ours for $100 minimum purchases.  I checked in
March.

While it's a given that the group would spend over $100, someone still has to put
down the deposit and then we have to work our him/her getting reimbursed on
meeting night.

<former-editor-rambling>

Although there has certainly been a decline in the number of locally 
owned tech companies aimed at the consumer market (esp. hardware 
vendors and ISPs), I think there are still enough to make a go at 
something like the Bits. The local market probably wouldn't support 
the 100-page magazines we were publishing in 1998 -- and no one would 
get rich in the endeavor -- but I don't think it's impossible.

The former owner (and my boss), Paul Harwood, sold the magazine 
sometime in 1999 or 2000. In his telling, the new owners alienated 
many of the long-time customers.

He had financed the buyout, so when the new owners were unable to make 
their payments, he "repossessed" the magazine. (I think this was in 
the spring of 2004, but my memory is hazy.)

Unfortunately, Paul's main job demanded a lot of time, and I don't 
think he was really up to the task of rebuilding all the goodwill and 
infrastructure the magazine required. He'd spent 1991 to 1995 
operating on a shoestring, and the sacrifices he faced to do it all 
again were just (imo) too daunting.

FWIW, Portland is a great place for tech editing: solid local business 
owners and a great stable of tech writers. But advertiser-supported 
publishing is tough work, especially during ramp-up.

Not surprising; when I was consulting full time a few years ago, they
gave me several months of a free half page ad and seemed pretty
desperate to keep the pages filled.  Unfortunately, I got 0 calls from
it, so I didn't buy any further advertising.

Paul and Carla (and probably some others) used to work for Computer
Bits, so they might know more.

Why?  While not as convenient as downtown, it's right at the end of the
Fremont bridge, and it's on the #4 bus route, which is a frequent service
bus.

If it's a deposit they might just rip up the card impression or do a 
chargeback to the card, making this less of hassle for the deposit person.

I did not know that.

Are there any fees for use of the place?  What about space? Can they hold

Where are you at?  I have a battery that works.  (In fact, I am using it

Contact me off list and we will see what we can do.

Great imagery!  You can use sox to change the pitch of sound files, but
it sounds like your modem ain't working right.  A quick Google showed
that someone else had the same problem with a Zoom 2949L.  Maybe you can
find something else at FreeGeek that'll work better.

Thanks, Carla, for recommending Akkana Pack's book, Beginning GIMP. It's 
opening up the tool for me.

As I'm using it I'm noticing that there are many features that are 
common with mechanical CAD programs I've used. I wonder if anyone's ever 
considered building a mechanical CAD program using the GIMP as a 
starting point. My Google search for GIMP "mechanical cad" turns up lots 
of sites that talk about each, separately. After two pages, I gave up. 
I'll have to go back later and search some more.

I haven't seen many regular meetings, but I agree.  I hope the slides
are made available so I can look at the stuff I couldn't see from the
back row, and try the examples they showed.

And heck, it looks like a session on advanced document-processing in
OpenOffice might be useful for the WYSIWYG crowd, too.

How so?  I haven't the faintest idea what distinguishes mechanical CAD
from the usual vector-drawing-with-dimensions that most folks do with
AutoCAD and such.

Well, whether you spell it as a plain character or a regex, it gets *turned*
*into* a regex.  For example,

        @list = split ".", "127.0.0.1";

probably doesn't do what you want, because Perl treats it *identical* to:

        @list = split /./, "127.0.0.1";

Hence, I *always* write the first arg as a regex, to ensure that my reader
understands that whether I write it as a regex or not, it IS a regex.

I'll see if I can find out how many patrons it takes to keep the Redwing
open later.  They do that for some events, and have yummy food and beer.

Other thoughts: Blue Monk, some McMenamins, Rose and Raindrop.

Discussion of the Lucky Lab seems to mention a $50 fee to "close the
door".  If it were to keep things quiet rather than bar guests, or it
could be left open, would the saem fee apply?  We don't want to bar
the idly curious, right?

(Not that I'm a huge fan of the Lab...)

AutoCAD is a mechanical CAD program as opposed to an electrical CAD 
program that can take a circuit diagram and generate a PC-board etch 
pattern, or a mask for a chip making machine (I'm starting to get out of 
my league, here). I have only used mechanical CAD programs, but I've 
been taught that there is a difference.

Sounds good.

Blue Monk:  Where "It's a Beautiful Pizza" used to be, downstairs would work well.
 Only complication would be that they're getting too busy and use the spot.

McMenamins:  $$ deposit required.

Rose and Raindrop:  Upstairs might work, back room is marginal size for us, not

   Actually, the genre started as Computer-Aided Drafting. Generating the
first drawing using a CAD program was no quicker than drawing by hand. But,
changes were much quicker on the computer. CAD vendors focused on serving
the design, engineering, and architectural markets. Many added pick lists of
standard items such as I-beams, wall studs, and doors and windows.

   Since then the biggest additions have been the addition of automatic Bill
of Materials generation, parts lists, sheet cutting templates, and similar
aids. A generic vector drawing program could serve as a CAD base; a raster
drawing application (such as The GIMP) would not.

   Yet another application that folks and organizations with a large
investment in CAD software tried to force fit is that of geographic
information systems (GIS). The latter adds a geographic coordinate to all
nodes, lines, and polygons, and in the better ones has only a single
boundary between adjoining objects.

   Different horses for different courses.

Oh yeah, I've been meaning to follow up--I RTFM'd and realized that I
was wrong that it would behave differently.  Well, actually, it
does--there's overhead in turning the string to pattern, and it's
especially bad for regex metacharacters:

Part of the reason you may be seeing such a difference in performance
is that those two commands don't do the same thing...  The second one
will split on every character, unless I'm mistaken.

Very well put.  There are many vector-based drawing tools for linux,
but Inkscape is the only one that I've seen which compares to
something like Adobe Illustrator, for example.
It would be a better starting point if one were to build a CAD app.
Not that it would be the *best* starting point by any means, but it's
closer than the gimp :).

There are also some level editors for 3d games out there that might be
viable alternatives (not alternatives for a CAD app, but alternative
starting points for a CAD app :)

Yeah, you're right.  Changing the second to '\.' yields pretty much the
same performance as /\./:

Timing splitting of 'a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h.i.j.k.l.m.n.o.p.q.r.s.t.u.v.w.x.y.z'...
                Rate split_re_dot split_ch_dot
split_re_dot 44383/s           --          -1%
split_ch_dot 44823/s           1%           --

That's not what I'd expect, though--I'd expect a literal string to be
treated as if all regex metacharacters were escaped (which was, in fact,
part of my motivation for using a string instead of a pattern to begin
with).

Oh well; live and learn.

AutoCAD is a generic 2D CAD package w/ basic to midrange 3D 
capabilities.  Out of the box it's not really geared towards any one 
discipline.  There are several CAD packages available in each field that 
are made specifically for that field.  AutoCAD is not an electrical 
package just like it's not an architectural or mechanical package. 
Sorry, ACAD rant over. ;)

From message of Friday 07 July 2006 14:29:
:
:    Actually, the genre started as Computer-Aided Drafting. Generating the
: first drawing using a CAD program was no quicker than drawing by hand. But,
: changes were much quicker on the computer.

Another advantage back in the days of, say AutoCAD v2, was the ability to copy 
and paste exact duplicates of things in a precise array - such as holes in a 
bolt pattern.


:    Since then the biggest additions have been the addition of automatic
: Bill of Materials generation, parts lists, sheet cutting templates, and
: similar aids. 

Actually the biggest leap forward had been that solid modling has become as 
comprehensible and easy that most mechanical engineers model in 3D and then 
drop the model into 2D views in  the modeler's attached drafting mide.

2D drafting is still an artistic specialty, so many engineering houses will 
keep a set of 3D seats of ones program (which usually had a decent but 
not-so-great drafting package: think Pro-Engineer) and an artistic-quality 2D 
program such as CADKey or AutoCAD for 2D. Models would be exported into a 
common, nonparametric format such as .dxf, .igs, or the newer STEP format.

AutoCAD today has all the controls for most 2D drafting tasks of 'normal' 
mechanical objects (brackets and machine parts, that aren't too oogie-shaped 
think 'normal, mundane' machinery, not 3D shapes seen in a Lava-lamp.)

In Linux, Q-Cad was free, came close to AutoCAD in basic functions, and the 
last time I tried it, the rpm installed with a double-click.This was a VERY 
GOOD thing - I'm a mechanical engineer, not a computer configurator.

Now - I'd LOVE to see and FEA package in Linux, with a good GUI-based 
whack-a-mole install. Some 'OK' clicks allowed, 'a' versus 'b' click-on, 
options, nothing with a double-minus sign typed in a command line, and no 
guff about dependencies. 

:    Different horses for different courses.
Definitely...

The most fun I had in a *nix environment was running a Japanese program called 
EDMICS (in Japan) in Unix on a SUN Sparc-1. This thing had cursor drag shapes 
as COMMANDS: You could delete a bunch of entities by circling them with a 
dragged mouse pointer (fence command,)  then drag the two strokes of hirigana 
'to' character for 'toru' (delete, or take away) and that would erace the 
selected entities. They had about 10 other common and handy kana-based 
drafting commands for local stretch and scale, cut, paste, and copy.

I also remember that the redraw command was the 'L' key for 'leflesh.' No 
joke.

Yes.  Perl *is* intuitive, but you have to think like Larry thinks. :)
I've spent 18 years describing "how Larry thinks" to people, and I still
get surprised occasionally.

Message-ID: <200607081356.58871.carla@bratgrrl.com>

Thought this might be useful to the Debian/Ubuntu/other debian derivative 
noobs, and even some oldtimers.

Online Debian package-finding tools:

View package lists, by category:
http://www.us.debian.org/distrib/packages#view

Searchable online database to find packages:
http://www.us.debian.org/distrib/packages#search_packages

Searchable online database to find files inside packages:
http://www.us.debian.org/distrib/packages#search_contents

When you're looking at a particular package there is always a link to see a 
list of files in the package. This doesn't always work; Debian's package 
database tends to break every so often. So here are some useful command-line 
tools.

Get information about packages not installed on your system with apt-file-

Synchronize local file list with the server:
apt-file update

Find files containing [name], which can be part of the filename, it doesn't 
have to be exact, and the packages they belong to:
apt-file search [name]

Show the package name only, not filenames:
apt-file search -l [name]

List files in a package:
apt-file list [package name]

Query packages on your system with dpkg-

What package does this file belong to?
dpkg -S [filename]
 [filename] can be part of the filename

List files in an installed package:
dpkg -L [package name]
must be exact package name

Find the exact package name:
dpkg -l | grep [name]
this can be a partial package name

Read the package description:
dpkg -p [package name]

List all installed packages:
dpkg -l | less

Query package repositories-

Search for a package to install; partial names are OK:
apt-cache search [name]

thing I got on sale, but after a while the beer will improve it. I'm
tired. I don't care.

Except that the sound card is not functioning properly. <sigh>

Previously I had observed that Firefox was the culprit. I never had
this problem under Breezy because under Breezy I never got the sound
plugin working in Firefox. So I closed Firefox. Last time that solved
the problem. This time it does not. 

"OK," I thought. "I'll modprobe the soundcard. That'll probably wake it
up." Wait ... what is the soundcard called? Crap. I have no idea what
the driver is called, or even how to find out what it is called.

OK, I know if I shut down and reboot the sound card will be working
again. But that's just wrong. I'm trying to learn Linux here. I need to
figure this stuff out. 

If I right click on the sound icon in the Gnome panel, it says "no
volume control, Gstreamer plugins and/or devices found." Please note
that I usually have sound muted. Ubuntu is rather noisy when it boots.
Not cool in the library at PSU. However, right-clicking on the icon and
then on "mute" toggles it on and off. This time it just gives me the
above error message.

Opening Firefox and going to about:plugins I find that I have
mozplugger installed twice. Is that possible? Guess so. Somehow, I have
it installed twice. At least it's listed twice. The entries are
identical. Googling off to mozplugger, I find nothing that clarifies
the issue.

OK, that's it. Gonna reboot. Meantime, if someone has any genius ideas
that will help me figure out what is wrong, please let me know.
Tomorrow morning, after a strong cup of coffee, perhaps I'll even
understand what you say.

Good stuff. Thanks. 

Here's a pair that I use on occasion. I always dump the current package
list before backups so that if a machine takes a dirt nap I can get the
packages installed in one go after the basic (re)install.

  dpkg --get-selections > file
  dpkg --set-selections < file

After '--set-selections', an 'apt-get update && apt-get upgrade' will
install the packages listed as 'installed' in the file.

This is not like 'dpkg -l' in that it is a minimal list of installed
packages; none of the version info or descriptions like 'dpkg -l'.

If one were to build a CAD app, one would go nowhere near SVG.

PythonCAD is doing some interesting stuff, and has a less silly 
interface than qcad.  There was a perlcad, but it seems to have 
stalled.  IME, the worst part is getting a right-side-up coordinate 
system in any GUI toolkit.  Tk::Zinc is interesting, but still clunky 
WRT fonts.  I was thinking a good Perl binding to the Cairo canvas 
would do the trick for CAD::Drawing, but I haven't had a chance to look 
at it lately.

I finally got it working again. One issue was /dev/dsp. It was owned by root. After taking possession and giving myself 755 permission suddenly the hedadphone jack was working, although not the speakers. That struck me as really weird.

I was also struggling to get a login error message fixed. When I booted at PSU during our PLUG meeting I got a strange error message that my home folder permissions were wrong; that it should be 644. I could never be sure if this error message was related to the disappearance of the sound driver. So last night I gave myself 644 permissions to the whole home folder. Afterwards I wasn't able to launch anything, not even a terminal, nor could I Ctrl-Alt-F1 to a command line. Totally stuck, I rebooted, but was unable to log in. I had to boot to my alternate rescue installation to fix things. Then I gave myself 755 permissions -R for /home/jjj and rebooted. Finally I was able to log in and the error message was gone as well.

Then I proceeded to work on the speakers. I googled and Ubuntu-forum-ed for hours, but could not find anything specific. Lspci did not reveal the name of the driver. It just said that it was an nForce3. I already knew that mozplugger was listed twice in about:plugins. So I used Synaptic and uninstalled it. Still no joy. Then I started uninstalling other stuff. Nothing worked. After uninstalling half a dozen things I decided to reboot. Afterwards sound was working again as before, speakers and all. However, I don't know which uninstall did the trick because I didn't reboot after each one. All I know is that I uninstalled a lot of sound-related apps that I don't like and never use anyway -- xmms, beep audio player, gxine, soundjuicer, and rhythmbox.

And then I had to reinstall totem-gxine in order to play movies. And in all this I have killed Firefox's ability to open PDFs in browser windows (uninstalling mozplugger did that). However, Flash and Java are still working. I think I'll not worry about sound in Firefox because it's annoying anyway. I just want to get evince working as the Firefox PDF plugin. I'll google on that later.

In the meantime, is this the Flash Audio bug?

While not FOSS, there is one. UGS' NX product is currently available on 
Linux. While the FEA package at present is not really complete, it has a 
lot of really nice tools. The solid meshing tools are some of the best 
I've seen period. The rest is getting better all the time and should be 
useful for most analysts with the next major release available sometime 
early next year.

Now the installer is not the nothing to get excited about. There is no 
GUI, and no pretty widgets, but it is simple text menu. Select option 1 
to configure licensing, option 2 to set the install directory, etc....

Not in any repository I have in my sources list yet. Synaptic just
finds 1.8.12. Oh well. I don't like bookkeeping anyway. A good excuse

I recently was talking with someone who was learning QuickBooks[1] to  
help out a small non-profit.  I've heard of GnuCash but have never  
used it, so I wasn't sure if suggesting GnuCash[2] would be  
appropriate.  Anyone here familiar with enough of both to comment?   
That is, would GnuCash be appropriate for handling the finances of a

Yes, it probably would. However, accounting requirements vary a lot,
even for the same type of organization. Since it's free, give it a shot.

   No. While there's been some business-related journals added recently, it's
still best suited for personal finance.

   For any organization -- for-profit, non-profit, whatever -- the better
solution is SQL-Ledger <http://www.sql-ledger.com/>. This is a full business
accounting system (written in perl and working with any of several dbms
backends, apache/thttpd, and almost every web browser -- inlcuding lynx). It
has a General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, purchase
orders, etc. While originally designed for the vertical integration of
manufacturing -> distribution -> retail/POS, I've been using it for my small
consulting business for several years. It will do whatever the small
non-profit wants, the support is outstanding, and new features are added on
demand.

   Some on this list prefer other accounting packages because the perl
scripts are not as tight and elegant as they could be. I just use it and
have found it to work flawlessly so I really don't care if the perl is
spaghetti-coded or not.

Yes - I use NX at work now. It's a fun product, but it's so old there are some 
legacy clunkies in it carried over from the paleo-text-adventure-gaming era 
of computing history. It's 2006, and to convert a drawing from in to mm you 
close, exit, and type in a command line! Hilarious!

NX 4 is supposed to be even more stable and robust than ever. I wondr how much 
1 seat costs nowadays?

At home I use SolidWorks on Windoze, becuase it was affordable for a solid 
modeler, and I am a user-level person when it somes to Linus (like this box.)

I am too afraid to fiddle with this one, because if it breaks I know I'd never 
be able to get it going myself, so I don't really do installs or maintenance 
on it. I like Linux because it's secure and runs for 2 - 4 years between 
upgrades

New question: I am wondering about SuSE 10. If I plop a bunch of disks in and 
run them, do Linux instll act nice and find other, older distros' suff like 
all my emails, etc? Also, I have a firewall/router from my DSL company. Would 
Suse 10 autodetect IP's and all that stuff from the inside? I can feed it 
user/pw combo's all day, but that's all I'd know how to do.

Advice on SusE?

As a side note, I don't get this mentality.  I'm not going to guess on 
an exact number, but I would imagine in the last two years an exploit or 
two has come out for Linux.  Windows runs 2 to 4 years between releases 
too.  Patch management no matter what OS, shouldn't be forgotten.

Although it doesn't have anything to do with your problem, I'd 
suggest to switch to dovecot as your IMAP server. Reason: It
supports maildir mailstorage and is thus quite somewhat faster
as uw-imap with mbox. Also, because of the mbox format, you're
more likely to risk losing *ALL* of the mails, if there's one
defect in the mbox file.

Good Afternoon.

I'm running a debian etch system at home, and I've fallen into a
position where I need voip service (well, "need" is too strong a word,
but daily conferences over the telephone, long distance for an hour,
gets pretty expensive. 

Anyway- I'm looking into VOIP service, and Broadvoice offers a level of
service at $20.00 which would give me free long distance in the US. Is
there a better supplier at a similar price point?  Price is key here,
but I don't want a free crappy service.

And my understanding is that I'll just need asterisk + a soft phone + a
headset that plugs into my sound card; is that about right? (I've seen a
walkthrough for specifically asterisk+twinkle on debian, I think).

more detail please ...

if the 67x is set up with nothing but NAT, you should
not have any issues. I use a 678 (someday will get that
26xx connected up) and 'dial in' via SSH all the time.

I have used two different services (well 3 if you count skype without
dial-in/out) that
 seem to serve me well.
Softphone from project Gizmo.
Service from sipphone.com

The other is Googletalk.  This doesn't allow for calling other phones
yet :( but seems
to have good quality every time I have used it.

Sipphone is just that: a sip phone service provider.  Zero cost
between other sip users,
google and skype.  Virtual numbers for a cost. Dial out costs in the
US/UK for .01/min.

Contact me off list if you want to test the quality.

Also you might want to check testmyvoip.com as they can show you
wheither you have
ISP/network problems that would prevent you from using VOIP.

Larry,

   Thank you for that URL. Just for giggles, I tested my connection. Both
Bahston and Europe came in at 4+ on the default SIP port; San Jose could not
be contacted on that port, so the application tried a different port with
quality 3.5-3.7. Californicated!

:-)

As already mentioned there are holes on Linux as well. They tend to be
comparatively minor, but add all the minor ones together and you get a
major one. This should be a factor in your choice of distribution, how
easy it is to get/install updates. They all make it pretty easy, but one
or the other method might be preferable.

Debian has been running 3-5 year release cycles. Their security
infrastructure is also pretty simple to deal with. Reasons I go with
Debian. (alas you would need assistance with pure Debian)

My tendancy is to do a fairly thorough paving during upgrades, so I have
to know where this is stored to save it. Some of this, yes, some, no.
If you're talking about name->IP address resolution, that isn't too
likely to be preserved (though differing versions of the same distro
might). Mail is pretty likely to survive, if you've stored mail in files
in your home directory. You would need to be careful about the spool
files (save /var/mail!). Ensure your home directory isn't paved over, and
you should be pretty safe.

> Advice on SusE?

They're a commercial distribution, now owned by Novell. Quite a few
people use it. There are good things about SuSE, there are bad things
about SuSE.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Date: Tue, 11 Jul 2006 21:16:18 -0400 (EDT)
From: Wietse Venema <wietse at porcupine.org>

A few months later than usual, Postfix stable release 2.3 is now available.
The release was postponed until Postfix was complete enough for today's
email environment. Hopefully I can now spend more time doing new projects.

You can find the Postfix 2.3.0 source code via the mirror sites listed at
http://www.postfix.org/. If it's not there today, then it should show up in
the course of the next 24 hours.

    435112 Jul 11 17:24 postfix-2.3.0.HISTORY
     35125 Jul 11 16:40 postfix-2.3.0.RELEASE_NOTES
   2770830 Jul 11 17:25 postfix-2.3.0.tar.gz
       280 Jul 11 17:25 postfix-2.3.0.tar.gz.sig

What follows is a very much compressed summary of what has changed. See the
RELEASE_NOTES file for compatibility issues that may affect your site. The
HISTORY file gives a blow-by-blow account of what happened over the past 1+
year.

 	Wietse

- DSN (delivery status notification) support as described in RFC 3461 .. RFC
3464. This gives email senders control over notification of successful,
delayed, and failed delivery. DSN involves extra parameters to the SMTP
"MAIL FROM" and "RCPT TO" commands, as well as extra Postfix sendmail
command line options for mail submission. See DSN_README for details,
including how to limit the amount of information that you are willing to
disclose.

- Major updates to the TLS (SMTP encryption and authentication) support. 
Postfix 2.3 introduces a configuration user interface that is based on the
concept of TLS security levels (none, may, encrypt, verify, secure) and that
can more effectively deal with DNS spoofing. The old configuration user
interface, with multiple boolean parameters to enable or enforce TLS, is
still supported but will be removed after a few releases. See TLS_README
for details.

- Milter (mail filter) application support, compatible with Sendmail version
8.13.6 and earlier. This allows you to run a large number of plug-ins to
reject unwanted mail, and to sign mail with for example domain keys. All
Milter functions are implemented except the one that replaces the message
body (this will be added later). All this and more is described in
MILTER_README.

- Enhanced status codes (RFC 3463). For example, status code 5.1.1 means
"recipient unknown". Mail clients can translate these status codes into
text in the user's own language, and greatly improve the user experience.
Enhanced status codes can be specified in Postfix access tables, in
header/body_checks content filter rules, in "rbl" reply templates, and so
on.

- Configurable bounce messages with support for non-ASCII character sets. 
Details are in the bounce(5) manual page.

- Plug-in support for SASL authentication in the Postfix SMTP server and
client. With this, Postfix can support multiple SASL implementations without
conflicting source code patches. Postfix 2.3 has Dovecot SASL support built
into the SMTP server. As before, support for Cyrus SASL is available as
add-on feature for the Postfix SMTP server and client. See SASL_README for
more information.

- Support for sender-dependent ISP accounts, in the form of sender-dependent
relayhost lookup and sender-dependent SASL username/password lookup.

- The Postfix SMTP client now implements both the SMTP and LMTP
protocols. This means that a lot of features have become available for LMTP
mail delivery, including the shared TCP connection cache.

- After TLS handshake failure, the SMTP client will now reconnect to the
same server to try plaintext delivery (if TLS policy permits). Earlier
Postfix versions would skip the server and defer delivery if no alternate MX
host was available.

- All delay logging now has sub-second resolution. Besides the total delay,
Postfix logs separate delays for different stages of delivery (time in
queue, time in queue manager, time to set up connection, and time to
deliver). This gives better insight into the nature of performance bottle
necks.

- Smarter utilization of cached SMTP connections. When one destination has
multiple inbound SMTP servers, the Postfix SMTP client will now send less
mail via the slower ones, and more mail via the faster ones.

- Support for empty MX records. Older Postfix versions treat this as a
malformed response and defer mail delivery.

Hi.

	I filed a bug report on korganizer about a month ago and haven't even got so 
much as a reply from the maintainer of the application. Does anyone know if 
korganizer is being developed anymore? If not, then why isn't it being 
actively developed anymore? It is probably the best personal organizer 
software available for linux right now, if not, for any platform!

	Apparently, there is a section in this changelog that shows korganizer having

someone steps upto the plate to update the korganizer webpage soon (I would,

Rod,

   There's an extension for keymapping
             <http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/keyconfig>
perhaps it will allow you to redefine the key(s) causing problems so they
they are benign when pressed.

   I wouldn't sue the keyboard, either. Legal fees will take whatever you
win.

A lot of secret settings (like not using the horizontal scroll for 
back/forward, middle-click for new tab vs window, etc) are only

  Currently I use Asterisk at home which is basically a Whitebox Linux(I
think. Well one of the RHEL plain wrapper versions anyway) install with
asterisk, amp, sugarcrm, and a bunch of other goodies installed. My
understanding is that now it has changed to TrixBox. Looks like it has a
nice new skin with the freepbx product. I love the ease of install and
ease of use. 
   I use a Cisco 7960 sip phone and it works flawlessly. I have also
used a cheaper Polycom phone and had great results from it(I liked its
web configuration interface). If you can afford it I am partial to the
cisco. It is simply bulletproof. I used to work in the telecom industry
and I haven't seen a phone this well build since the RolmPhones of
yesteryear.
   The only problems I have encountered so far are with the service
providers themselves. Some service providers don't have the best
international connections and sometimes calls are routed incorrectly.
Note that this happened to me alot with MCI calling cards on land lines
so it may just be the cost of a cheap connection. 
  One thing I love is the sugar crm integration with asterisk. Out of
the box you can import your contacts into sugar crm and use it to setup
calls. If you double click a contact it will call your phone and when
you pickup it will automagically dial the contact you clicked. It is a
pretty nice system. 
  As for connecting to ma bell I use commercial AIX termination services
through (in order of stability not cost..) connect.voicepulse.com,
Gafachi.com, & terravon.com. There are literally thousands of different
providers out there and they all offer very different services and
pricing. As for outbound dialing I tend to use Gafachi because they are
good enough as far as quality but are easy on the pocket book... ;)
  I highly recommend doing your homework on the service providers. It
can save you substantial $'s. I really didn't do much homework so take
my recommendations with a grain of salt.. :o 
  Someday soon I will probably install the new TrixBox. I am sure its
better than the original.
  Hope my jabbering helps... One tip: dedicate a box for telephony...

It's quite nice, and the best new feature is it now has an upgrade script, so 
no more reinstalling just to upgrade.

Been there, done that; and didn't find anything key-like.  It was at the 
end of the day so my eyes might have been a little fuzzy.  I'll look again.

You may want to examine the xmodmap command and setup up a wrapper
around firefox remapping keys if it really bothers you that much.

I may do that since the only other (semi-)viable solution I've come 
across is a serious hack job that will have to be done eveytime there is 
a new release of Firefox.

This came up again as I was getting ready to make some entries in RT and 
remembered the last two times I tried to make similar for the same 
ticket.  I got most of the way through and -- because I ahd been using 
emacs just before -- tried to do a ctrl-w to cut a chunk of text.  Lost 
the whole d**n entry.
    I could change the emacs key-mappings but since it's been around 
longer than Firefox/Mozilla and I've used it longer than I've had access 
to the Internet I'll go for a change in the Firefox stuff.

I forget about xmodmap since the GUI for the most part works fine.

Thansk for the reminder.

I have not seen announcements for any of these, but we've got a busy
Sat/Sun/Mon coming up:

Saturday, July 15   1 to 7 at Free Geek:   Geek Fair street festival

http://www.freegeek.org/geekfair/index.html

Sunday, July 16   1 to 5 at Free Geek:   Linux Clinic

Monday  July 17  7pm to ?? at Jax:  Advanced Topics


Since I haven't heard of a topic for Monday, I hallucinated one:

   "Free Vista", a round table with Bill Gates, Steve Balmer, Linus
   Torvalds, and Richard Stallman.  In contrite apology for years of
   shameful business practices,  Bill and Steve ask Linus and Richard
   how to reform Microsoft and GPL their entire code base.  PLUG
   attendees are asked to be nice, because Bill has offered to buy
   the Rose Garden from Paul Allen, donate it to the group, and 
   rename it the PLUG Garden, so we will always have a venue for 
   Advanced Topics.  

On the other hand, Alan might wish to announce something a bit more
likely ...

I'm pretty sure its not working because Squirrelmail is looking for mbox but
I could be wrong. What errors do you get? And I agree with Alexander, either
dovecoat or maybe just plain imapd. I was able to get it up and running in
an existing Qmail environment in about 20 minutes.

In the search for a new location I scoped out Blue Monk last night.

Remember the days before It's A Beautiful Pizza moved across the street?  When we
met in their basement?   Blue Monk has that location now.  Beer selection is more
than excellent.   Basement is available on Monday nights, the rest of the week
they have live music.

Nice selection of reasonably priced and good food also.

Squirrelmail talks imap -- I would think mbox or maildir would look
the same to it, no?

Is there a cost for using the space? (Other than buying food.)

There are times when I wish the Horse Brass had a meeting room...

I didn't remember to ask.  Judging from the reaction when I described the group it
didn't seem so.

Strongbow and/or Blackthorne hard cider on tap.  Scotch Eggs that are

Ok

Having a problem  with apache2


Carla isn't helping

She wants me to put stuff in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf  <page 429>
Should I really put stuff there?

Apache2 really wants stuff in /etc/apache2/sites-avail/default.

As far as I can tell..

Anyone know a good how to???

It really depends on your system.  Some file ( /etc/apache2/<something> 
would be the toplevel config ) is including everything in the 
sites-avail directory.  This sounds like Debian/Ubuntu?

>Anyone know a good how to???

Seems like there were some docs that installled with the deb.  The 
apache manual is really good, but what you're dealing with here is a 
simple install/management policy thing.  If nothing else, understanding 
how includes work would help though.

Are you using a Debian based distribution? 
Your description rings familiar.

do a mental s/httpd.conf/sites-avail\/default/ and continue to follow Carla.

First of all, which distribution are you using?  Where things go depends 
on what distro you are using and what their preferences were when building 
the software.

   I had thought that grep would search through pdf files for a string
pattern. No such luck. Google tells me there's a commercial tool for
Microsoft and another one for Apple, but I find none for linux.

   Is there a tool that can identify the pdf document containing a specified
string?

How about

  for f in *.pdf; do
    ps2ascii "$f" | grep yourSearchString >/dev/null && echo "$f"
  done

   That'll do it, as long as the pdf can be converted by ps2ascii. Some
demand pstotext, and too many recently just will not disassemble. Perhaps
that's because the version of Adobe used to create them does things the
current versions of the linux tools cannot handle.

Thanks for the suggestion!

If that won't do it, Adobe Reader 7.0 will search a PDF file, and you
have radio buttons to check for 1) this document or, 2) all PDF files
in [dropdown to choose a folder]. You also have checkboxes for "whole
words only," "case-sensitive," include bookmarks," and "include
comments." If you click on Advanced Search Options you get many more
choices, including "Look in" 1) the current PDF document, 2) currently
selected indexes and 3) select an index.

I was going to start over with a clean configation..

I was thinking in setting up ssl I have have misconfigured something.

Then I couldn't get apache to uninstall

I used

dpkg --purge apache2

But it crabbed that apache2-common was there..

So I tried to

dpkg -- purge apache2-common

And it complained that apache2 was there..

What am I missing?

 Like everyone else said, different distributions muck with Apache in all 
kinds of ways. Debian/Ubuntu uses apache2.conf, not httpd.conf, so you should 
stick with that.

/etc/apache2/sites-avail/default is handy for managing virtual hosts. But if 
you don't have any virtual hosts you don't need it. Or you can put them 
somewhere else entirely. Look in apache2.conf to see where all the 
configuration files are that Apache is using. You can tweak these to your 
heart's content. 

Look in /usr/share/doc for the installed Apache help files, these should help. 
Apache is so flexible, and the different distros so pointlessly different, 
your best bet is to learn about httpd.conf/apache2.conf options as well as 
you can.

But won't search multiple files.  pdftotext uses the same libs as xpdf 
though, so might do a more correct job than ps2ascii.

Use apt-get, using dpkg is like using rpm instead of Yum. Try this:

apt-get remove --purge apache*

That should nuke all your Apache installation. It might leave a few configs, 
even with the --purge option. So check /etc and manually nuke any leftovers.

So that would be rm  -R /etc/apache2

Subject: [PLUG] Installing SuSE 10.1 on Thinkpad 600E
Message-ID: <44B802B8.5070000@comcast.net>

My sister-in-law gave me her old Thinkpad 600E (2654~4BU). I decided I'd 
swap out the hard drive with a spare one I have and install SuSE 10.1 
(from May 26, 2006), since I have it burned to a DVD, and the laptop has 
a DVD drive.

I had previously installed SuSE 10.1 on this drive in another laptop. I 
just went ahead and ran the installation again, and was given the option 
of a "New Installation" or an "Update". I choose a New Installation, 
assuming that this would be needed to find the appropriate drivers for 
the 600E.

I chose "local" for the hardware clock, (as I remember something about 
this being correct if you are also going to use the machine with that 
"other" OS, which I will), and a KDE desktop.

I did this twice. The first time I got one failure which was related to 
not finding a British spell checker for Firefox. I chose to ignore that 
and allowed the installation to finish. It reported that there was a 
failure, and then would not boot, saying "Missing operating system" just 
after reporting that there are 163264 KB OK. POST gives its usual one beep.

The second time I tried the load, the installer only got as far as 
looking for and not finding a "catalog".

Both of those actions sound to me like the DVD has problems. I still 
have the ISO on my other laptop. At the moment I can't seem to locate a 
program that will burn the data! I know I burned it there before, since 
that's the only DVD burner I have. I'm pretty sure I ran NTI 
CD&DVD-Maker, which is the XP program that came with the Acer Aspire 
laptop. But, when I try to create a new data dvd I get an error message 
that says, "The ISO filesystem has a 2GB limit on individual file size. 
File "SuSE-Linux-19.1-GM-DVD-i3a6.iso" has exceeded this limit and 
therefore must be skipped. If you want to include large files, please 
choose the UDF filesystem ... (there is one more line in the error 
message, but the line of buttons obscures all but the top pixels of the 
characters!).

I poked around in the NTI program and found a way to go with UDF, and 
made a coaster. With 20-20 hindsight, I can see why that didn't work, 
but I still don't know how I made the first DVD!

Is there something I've missed, or am I on the right track in 
considering the DVD corrupted?

Message-ID: <44B80625.6030104@writemoore.net>

A blog I've been reading, BikePortland.org, has a public forum component 
that has been hit by spammers.  Jonathan Maus, the guy who runs the site 
is looking to replace the forum software with vBulletin, which he says 
is $85 for a one-year license.  You can read his post about it here:

http://bikeportland.org/2006/07/13/help-me-fix-the-forums/

I was just wondering if anyone knows of any free (as in beer) 
open-source forum software that might be appropriate and has good 
security options.  Unfortunately, he doesn't say in his post what 
software he was using, just that it was free, but I gather from the 
comments to the post that it was phpBB.  Someone else recommended 
bbpress.  JM seems kinda set on vBulletin, though he appears to be open 
to suggestions.  Anyone have any?

I like to use WebGUI.  The forum component isn't as fully featured as some, but
it has an option for anonymous registration with captcha.

And after it's installed you have an entire CMS to play with, not just
a forum.

a hypothetical admin of a nice stout Unix system want to migrate to Linux or

Because Linux has current and updated software from this century?

SCO has never been a good choice.  They have always been the most 
expensive option out there for what you get.  Now that they have even 
bigger lawyer bills than what they pay their developers, it is even worse.

AIX works, but it has limited and crufty tools.  You can get packages from 
IBM for most of the Linux tools, but they are from Redhat 7.x and are not 
current or patched regularly.  Not certain why anyone would want to run 
AIX unless they had an app that demanded it or special hardware needs.

HP-UX and I have never gotten along.  Less said the better.

Until reciently Solaris has shipped old outdated versions of tools, did 
not ship with a C compiler and took forever for security patches.  They 
are getting better.  The Sun hardware allows some useful remote debugging 
posibilities I have heard.  Never had to use them.

It really depends on the hardware you want to use, the level of 
handholding you need from a vendor and the speed of security patches. 
Linux provides all those these days. Not certain what the support for the 
BSDs are like anymore.  (OS X and BSDi are the only commercial BSDs I have 
used.)

I prefer Linux because I can get more than enough software for it and it 
does what I want.

Most of what you gain is illustrated here:

Otherwise, stick with Solaris if you can (and you have the
experience).  Use OS X if you just want to get things done.  Linux for
everything else ;-)

Carla:

Here's my take on it:

GAIN:
  + lower cost per unit of performance
  + easier hiring (lots of linux folks around)
  + consistent OS from desktop to server
  + avoid licensing headaches

LOSE:
  + app certification only on UNIX/Windows (this is becoming less common)
  + serial console that always works
  + proprietary UNIX iron hardware diagnostics
  + single-image scaling to large numbers of CPUs
  + Enterprise-quality OS support from vendor

I'm sure the "lose" list is likely to start a lively discussion, so
let me explain a bit...

The OS is there to run an application.  The applications are often
purchased, and if the vendor doesn't support Linux, it's removed from
the table.  The same is true if they don't support a particular UNIX.
Fortunately, this is becoming increasingly rare as Linux gains
popularity.

Perhaps a minor nit, but as a sysadmin if there's problems on a server
and I can't get to the console, it's bad.  I need some way to get in
to diagnose a LAN or NIC problem if the box is off the network.  Linux
servers make this more difficult since unlike dedicated/proprietary
hardware they can't be assured at always having a serial console
available that's not used by a mouse, modem, or other device so most
distros don't enable the serial console by default.  In addition, very
few servers for Linux have a BIOS-over-serial-port available.
Expensive remote-VGA-console cards intended for Windows work
reasonably well but can be slow over WAN links.

The hardware diags built into dedicated UNIX servers can be impressive
when compared to those in the x86 world.  For example, the exact DIMM
that's tossing the single-bit errors can be identified.  This sure
beats DIMM-swapping between memtest86+ runs!  If you need to take a
memory dump for debugging purposes, on some servers you just push a
button and it dumps.  The ability to achieve tight integration between
the hardware and the OS can be an advantage-- albeit a costly one.

Many UNIX systems routinely run applications on servers with over a
hundred processors.  Linux isn't there yet.  Clustering is not always
a viable alternative, either.

Lastly, my support experiences with RedHat have been awful.  I get
better help from the 'net at large.  The proprietary OS vendors use
their support as a selling point and it's generally good, and in some
cases can be excellent.

I put a line in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

ServerName <something>

Works great..

phpbb is great and easy to set up.  Some huge boards are using it and 
it's free provided you don't remove the "Powered by phpBB" statement a

   * Solaris is probably much better these days with the work of the 
     Blastwave (http://www.blastwave.org/).  With SFW it was hit or 
     miss.
   * AIX, even with AIX Toolbox (http://sf.net/projects/aixtoolbox), 
     sucks.
   * Most modern Linux distributions have almost all the applications 
     you want readily available, either directly from the distributor 
     or from a 3rd party (like RPMforge).
   * Most applications are developed first on Linux and then ported.  
     Some are developed on *BSD and ported, but they're usually ported 
     much more quickly and more often.
   * (Nearly) guaranteed to have access to the compiler that built the 
     rest of the system, so building applications that use libraries 
     that are sensitive compiler maker and version is less painful 
     (think OpenSSL, Perl modules).

 + Sane patch and package management (well, except for SUSE).  This 
   should be both here and in the previous section.  When I don't have 
   a package already available, I can build it and without too much 
   suffering, penance and ritual sacrifice.  AIX at least supports RPM, 
   but it's an ancient version.  Good luck using a network-installer    
   like apt or yum.  (Well, AIX has NIM, which is kinda okay.  It's 
   also kinda shitty.)  It's also generally possible to update a Linux 
   system without rebooting; userland updates aren't closely tied to 
   kernel updates.  Not so with AIX or Solaris generally.

 + Modern, flexible userland.  At one time I thought I should 
   discipline myself to using ksh with vi mode, but I've since realized 
   that my life is too short and my typing too bad.

   * The proprietary UNIX systems lack a lot of things that seem 
     pretty basic in Linux systems--log rotation, 
     who's-got-that-port-open (netstat/lsof), vim, GNU utilities, 
     working top, tcpdump on localhost (couldn't do that on Solaris).

 + Depending on what system you get, the ability to replace a failed 
   piece of hardware within an hour or two.

 + Active, vibrant communities of users in a myriad of 
   channels--mailing lists, web sites, IRC, IM (anyone else tried Qunu 
   yet?), Usenet.  There's an AIX channel on Freenode and an okay 
   newsgroup; Solaris has a more active IRC channel and a few more 
   lists, but it's still paltry.

 + Periodicals.  Oh, SysAdmin is okay, I guess, but I have yet to find 
   either web or paper periodicals as good as LWN, LJ, LG, and the 
   myraid of other newsblogs like linux.com, slashdot, etc.  There used 
   to be UNIX Review, which became Server/Workstation Something, then 
   disappeared.  There used to be AIXpert, which ultimately became a 
   column in UNIX Review, and went down with it.  I guess there's an 
   AIX journal printed by the same people that print the IBM zSeries 
   mainframe journal I see a few people around the office, but I'm 
   prejudiced that a mainframe publisher can really speak UNIX.

 + Sane, sensible defaults.  I guess there's a lot more concern for 
   legacy with proprietary UNIX systems, which explains why the default 
   syslog configurations for AIX and Solaris are everywhere.  /var/adm, 
   WTF??  The FHS (nee FSSTND) is really wonderful and I wish 
   proprietary vendors would get on board.

 + Sane configuration and init system.  There are some nice things 
   about the ODM in AIX (it's a configuration database, not to be 
   compared with the Windows registry), but most SysV systems are 
   lame.  rc.config is better than that, and that kinda sucks too.  The 
   SRC in AIX is kinda nice (it's a system starter like DJB's   
   daemontools) and I hear there's something nice in Solaris 10.  But 
   the init scripts they do have, when they have them, look like they 
   were written by lazy interns.

I could probably go on, but it's Friday evening and I've got things to
do.

Hm, a lot of the depends on who's making the PC.  The expensive big iron
from the proprietary monoliths have a lot of the same capabilities.  I
used to be a lot more impressed with it than I am now.  The higher-end
stuff has hot-swappable CPUs, DIMMs, etc.

I'm especially unimpressed with the failure rate of absurdly expensive
hardware.  For that matter, I'm unimpressed with the failure rate of
their OSes too--I managed to kill AIX the other day with a simple
software installation.

Other than the old Cray vector machines, I don't think even the
highest-end UNIX hardware goes to a hundred--the Sun Fire E25k goes to
72 CPUs, with something like hyperthreading to make 144.

http://www.sun.com/servers/highend/sunfire_e25k/index.jsp

The p5 595 only goes to 64 cores, plus 2x Symmetric Multithreading:

http://www-03.ibm.com/servers/eserver/pseries/hardware/highend/595.html

Sure, there are bigger than PCs; the biggest xSeries 4 CPU, which is 8
cores (+ 2 hyperthreading)

But in most cases, at least with the IBM pSeries systems I use, boxes
that big are used to make partitions of smaller hosts--the biggest LPAR
in use is 4 dedicated CPUs.  The problem is that a lot of workloads
still don't scale across lots and lots of CPUs as one might like.

Sure, I get nervous hearing about people using 32GB of memory in a PC
running Linux; unless I had a lot of support and wasn't fighting a
I'll-show-you-Linux-on-a-PC-can-be-just-as-good fight, I wouldn't try
it.  

For running huge databases and workloads like that, a pSeries or Sun
running their respective OSes is probably a good choice.  But front-end
and middle-tier application layers?  Much better on Linux; these tend to
cluster or distribute well.

There are few things in the world I'd like to do less than calling
technical support, waiting on hold, hunting around for the right
customer or license number, explaining my problem to half a dozen people
over the telephone, most of whom just route me to someone else, never
explain the details about went wrong, rarely communicate back to
engineering (esp w/stuff that's not system-critical, like the fact that
their C headers are brain damaged and #define vaguely common words like
'open') and in almost all support cases I've seen, they were solved by a
hardware replacement, if I didn't solve it myself.

He's actually using phpBB:

Spam came to Usenet and at first it wasn't too big and people deleted it.

Then it became largish and people installed basic filters. Some groups
moved to web-based bulliten boards to escape the spam.

The spammers responded with measures that bypassed the filters.

The e-mail game of whack-a-mole ensued which continues. The web-based
systems sat back and grinned thinking because they didn't use SMTP.

The spammers kept the game of e-mail whack-a-mole going. They noticed the
motion towards web-based bulliten boards and responded.

Now it is clear for all to see that aside from pissing folks off who
thought Usenet was pretty effective, that web-based boards don't avoid
the spammers.

Moving to another system will merely continue the game of whack-a-mole.
If that is the only reason, then don't bother, they'll be back and you'll
of annoyed some of your fans. Porting Spam Assassin to work with other
things would be a partial solution, though it is still merely
whack-a-mole. The irony is that it was the variety that made web-based
systems take a long time to attack, yet now this variety makes a general
filtering a lot more difficult.

My wife's Thinkpad T30 got a non-warranty repair this morning - it was
making gnarly sounds and freezing occasionally.  Since it is out of
warranty, and I know how to disassemble a T30 down to the mainboard,
I removed lots of screws and cleaned it out. 

Little dust bunnies everywhere - the fan above the CPU was coated with
dust, and the input and output channel was mostly clogged.  The CPU
was probably overheating.  The globs of dust added up to about the
size of a grape.  I didn't pull the main board all the way - there
is probably more dust underneath - but at least there is clear airflow
through the main components.

The unit works a lot better now.

I'm not in charge of the rules for the Clinic, but I don't recall that
there is a requirement that you appear with a computer. All that is
necessary is a desire to learn or a desire to help others learn. Show

I ripped the cardbus slot ejector out of mine.  (It got caught on the 
laptop case and tore out of the slot, taking a bit of metal with it.)

I have had to do that to more than one machine.  Fun with dust alergies. 
(I once had to clean 15 Sparc 20s filled with dust.  Double plus ungood.)

Not all of them, but most of them.  I have an exploit around here 
somewhere for it.

BTW, it is a *local* root comprimise, not a remote.

Just be careful with those CPU screws; they seem to be designed to break
if you tighten them too tight (*sigh*).

I've found that a little sewing machine oil on fans will greatly improve
them.  I've also got a $25 hand-held "dual action" vacuum that blows in
addition to sucking (huh-huh); much better than those stupid compressed
air cans.

I haven't used phpBB since it was the attack vector for a worm that overwrote
a good share of the web content on my box.  

His stated problem is that he can't keep up with the spam fighting.  Perhaps
all he really needs is a sufficiently clueful person to apply whatever
effective spam tools phpBB has available.

I also received my cd's today. I would like to give 5 cd's for the linux 
clinic. The issue is that I cannot bring them to the linux clinic as I 
have other commitments (religous practices). I can make the disks 
available at 10110 SE Linwood Ave. Milwaukie, OR from 9:30 to 12pm. If 
someone would like to pick them up, the door will be open and the disks 
will be on a table, near the double door entry. The building is for a 
Church of Christ. Anyone able to come and get them it would be cool... 
but let me know so that I can be sure to bring them.

A GREAT alternative to the compressed air cans is to go to Harbor 
Freight Tools (or harborfreight.com) and get one of those cans that can 
be pressurized.  They are meant for spraying paint (think refillable 
spray paint can) BUT you can pump them up with a bike pump or compressor 
- are VERY portable, and even environmentally friendly (only air, no 
propellant!).

$10 for the can at Harbor Freight, bike pump free to $10 if you look around!

The premium part of the canned air is that it has no dirt or moisture in 
it.  The other part is it's not air since liquid N2 is a bit harder to 
ship.  As for environmental friendliness, I'm guessing the cost/weight 
tradeoff of using a fluorocarbon instead of CO2 was just too good to 
pass up (or is there some other reason not to use CO2 like that 
easy-to-compress-to-a-liquid-state near-room-temperature-range boiling 
point of refrigerants?)

A cylinder of N2 or CO/2 from NAPA might be better than a compressor for 
refilling your little spray can.  Bit of a steep investment for the 
cylinder (and hey -- spring for the little cart) if you only go through 
one a year, but blowing-out an entire data center on a $9.95 refill has 
got to be priceless.

Well, sure.  But it'll allow abritrary code to run as root, so if you've 
got a hole in anything else (apache, sendmail, etc.), this will turn that 
unprivileged user into a superuser... which bites.

I guess I'm rebutting simply because those who know what the thing does 
know whether or not their systems are secure and those who don't, well, 
probably aren't secure.

And really, better safe than sorry.

Watch out for static with plastic attachments on a vacuum cleaner. Air 
flowing through a plastic tube sets up a significant charge. I read 
something about this several years ago. The recommendation was to be 
sure to use a metal nozzle.

This is just another reminder, that the only really secure computer is
one that is in a locked room, with no connections to the outside

Essentially what you are saying is that the most secure system, is a
system that has not even been manufactured yet.

A system that has not been manufactured yet has some other advantages 
besides security:

1. It never breaks down
2. It consumes no power
3. It takes up no space
4. You don't have to teach your parents how to use it
5. Best of all -- it is *not* obsolete technology!!!

That would seem to fail on the first four accounts; it doesn't fail on
the fifth because it's not technology at all, although some might argue
it has reached obsolescence.

I wanted a blower instead of a vacuum specifically because a blower
works at a distance.  I'm sure there is a possibility of danger, but it
seemed the best option within my budget range.  There are, of course,
special multi-hundred dollar units that are free of static, but that's
not within my budget.

I've seen ones that use those CO2 cartridges used for air rifles,
whipped cream dispensers, etc.

My father, on the other hand, was a propane service man for many years
who would actually use the compressed propane to blow-out things, like
the space heaters he refurbished.

I was a happy broadvoice customer until we moved to Tigard and my wife decided to get Comcast for our internet access. I ended up canceling the broadvoice account because calls would not reliably connect.  

I do however suspect the issue with broadvoice was caused by something comcast was doing...

http://cloud9tech.com/, that refurbishes and upgrades color computers.
For those of us who have 256k 30 pin simms lying around for example,
they have a part that allows 2 of them to be installed in a Color
Computer 3.  I don't know why they don't allow installation of 4 to 8
simm chips.  2 megs might be nice, especially if you could run a 
ramdrive on a color computer since disk and tape access is so slow.

What I've heard, the color computer died because the GIME chip was 
engineered in such a way that it would have to be completely redone
costing too much.  Other theories are that the Tandy 1000 was 
supposed to be better than the color computer, so Tandy purposely 
gave the coco 3 less by dropping, for example, 256 color support.

Apparently, the 68B09E has on chip memory management capabilities.  I've
run into an OS-9 replacement called Nitros9 that some sites on the
Internet compare to UNIX.

I wrote my first programs on a color and still feel it's a good platform
to explore with.  Computers are so complicated now, it seems that the
fun has been lost.

What would a color computer be like today if the line hadn't ceased in 1989?  
Color computers didn't even have real time clocks in them, I wonder what did
between 1970 and 1989?  When did the first 386 hit the consumer market?

I still have a color computer 3, but noone sells 5.25" 360k media anymore
and my disks are going bad.

It sure would be awesome if I could get a rom pack version of Power Stones
of Ard II to replace my bad disk.  The rom pak could possibly have flash
chips in it so the game to be saved.

The color computer never was Z80 based, why on earth was the coco 2 called
the TRS 80 in the first place?

Is it true that the 6809 was the predecessor to the 68000 processors that
the early Macs were based on?  Were there any other spin offs?  Were there
any further attempts to create a successor to the color computer 3 after 
the Tomcat and MMI flopped?

How much longer will old color computers be around.  Is the design lost?
Could someone build one from scratch today?  It has probably been 14 years
since a color computer has been manufactured.  In 6 more don't the copyrights
Tandy had expire?  I've heard suggestions that a CoCo 4 capable of running
at 200 mHz could be built today that would be downward compatible.  If 
someone were to attempt to do this though, the machine should probably 
be 32 bit so it can run Linux.  How could you make a 32 bit color computer
that is compatible with what came before?

So, if I leave my systems unmaintained for long enough, eventually
they'll secure themselves? Fantastic!

   For all you web application developers here, I have a question. Is there a
useful module (or whatever) that will allow a web-based application written
in php to connect to any one of several dbms backends? Specifically,
PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MySQL would be nice.

   OK. I discovered ADOdb. Anyone here with experience with it? If so, can
you suggest why it works with mysql and not postgres?

Though I don't recommend anyone use PHP, ever(, ever), Pear is what
you're looking for I think.  It's a bit More than just a database
abstraction system, but its database layer behaves very much like perl's
DBI.pm.

Dave,

   When I look at Zend's web site I see that they don't recommend it as an
application development language, either. A single web page, yes; more than
that, no.

   Regardless, the developers of XRMS <http://xrms.sourceforge.net/> decided
on using php, and that's the way it is. But, they (like SugarCRM) hardwired
it for MySQL only. Late last year, someone else started trying to make it
work with PostgreSQL-8.x, and I've taken up where he left off. I've found
and fixed the bugs that generated when the install.php script was run, but
there are still a lot of error that keep it from running.

   My Google search turned up ADOdb which is a large php class that provides
dbms abstration for a whole slew of back ends -- including Microsoft's and
Oracle. I've asked the developer who's been doing some postgres-related work
why it would not be more better to devote development time on integrating
something like ADOdb than trying to find all the code that must be changed
somehow to work with both mysql and postgres. Reinventing the wheel type of
effort.

   From what I've seen, XRMS is the client resource management/sales lead
administration application that I want and need. I tried SugarCRM and just
did not like it. Seems to be that Pear or ADOdb would allow a solution
faster and with less effort than what is now being done. I'll pass on the
pear info.

Thanks,

Rich

It's probably not capable of addressing more than 2megs or ram.  If
you've only got 8 bits to store memory addresses in, then you just
can't "see" more than 2^8 * (wordsize) bits.

I'm no expert in hardware design, but that's the basic principle of
the thing... I'm sure other people can chime in with specifics and /
or corrections :)

I wouldn't worry. We only need 3-4 per clinic, max, so if you bring
them to the next Clinic, all will be well. 

Re the Clinic tomorrow: Having just come home from the Geek Fair, we
should plan on a bit more time to get things set up than usual. The big

by "it" you mean PHP?  I guess their application framework must just be 
a dead link then..

   We've had local folks move far away for jobs. If there are subscribers who
are un- or under-employed, why not list openings that come your way?

   According to the developer who's focusing on adding postgres support
fully, ADOdb does not do all the translating required for each dbms'
ideosyncracies. That's why we keep seeing errors despite their incorporation
of ADOdb.

   Now, I thought the purpose of such middleware was to let one write sql
statements in any supported language, and it would translate them to the
appropriate syntax for the database backend. Returned tuples would also be
translated to a neutral syntax that the application could display. Having
used neither PHP nor ADOdb for anything I've written, I can only pass on
what I've been told.

Brent,

   Here's what I just learned: ADOdb will translate record insertions and
retrievals, but not SELECT statements. It is in those that the errors come
up. It can be a major PITA if one dbms supports full outer joins and another
does not, for example.

Subject: [PLUG] Command line tools to troubleshoot Samba
Message-ID: <20060715192044.b115a5df.johnxj@comcast.net>

Last time I used Samba or file sharing between my Windows 2000 desktop
and my Ubuntu Dapper-64 laptop was about a week ago. It worked then.
Today neither can ping each other, not even using ip address.
Conclusion: Samba died. I have used Samba for ages and it always "just
worked."

Why it broke and how to fix it eludes me. The GUI is not helping. No
error messages; it just fails to display the folders. OK, Konqueror
does give me an error message -- "unable to establish connection
<crashing noise>." Not very helpful. The Windows computer just acts as
if it is the center of the universe and there is nothing beyond its
borders.

There are probably a ton of command line tools to troubleshoot this,
but I don't even know the name of the command(s) to ask for a man page
about, let alone google. Could someone give me a hint here?

I think you've just hit on why developers pick one database and stick
with it.  There's just too much variance between the feature sets to get
any sort of real performance when you using the lowest common
denominator.  

>From my experience with DBI.pm, you /can/ write something that will work
everywhere, but you're going to do it slowly and poorly.

A design tip that I've found useful:  Make your application look
something like:

[app]<----[AppDB]<----[ADOdb]<----(database)

Where 'AppDB' is some class you spent time writing that has very, very
custom function calls to handle your app's needs, and stay the bloody
hell away from using direct SQL inside your application.

First thing to do is to establish functonal network connectivity on both
machines.  The connections between the 2 smaba endpoints must be deemed
good first, before delving into samba config files.  If it worked when
the machines' network connections were functioning, and it doesn't work
now that at least one of the machines can't talk, my gut feeling tells
me that this is your real problem (unless you hosed your samba config
while clicking around in the death GUI, trying to make something happen).

It is not good to assume things when troubleshooting.  One needs to
know: does the linux box's network connectivity function normally in all
respects other than conversations with the windows box?  Can the linux
box get to the internet, and can it get an IP address from your DHCP
server?  Can the linux box ping your router?  (I'm making assumptions
about your network - shame on me.)

If I had to make a call on the information provided thus far, I'd say
your windows box is 100% the problem.  Its network connectivity died.
Why is uncertain.  Start with hardware, then get a physical link, then
get an IP address, then check the routing table (windows has a route
command too), then ping, then get a web page, then nmap the windows box
from the linux box and look for samba ports:

netbios-ns      137/tcp             # NETBIOS Name Service
netbios-ns      137/udp
netbios-dgm     138/tcp             # NETBIOS Datagram Service
netbios-dgm     138/udp
netbios-ssn     139/tcp             # NETBIOS Session Service
netbios-ssn     139/udp
microsoft-ds    445/tcp             Microsoft-DS
microsoft-ds    445/udp             Microsoft-DS

At least some of these ports should be open.  Not all of them, though.
These are just all the relevant entries from the /etc/services file.  I
don't have a windows box to ping, or I'd give you the exact list of
ports to expect.

Then I'd use ethereal on the linux box to watch BROWSER packets.  the
windows box will squawk every few minutes if functioning "correctly".

You've been doing Python lately, haven't you?  You might look into
Roundup (http://roundup.sourceforge.net/).  At its most basic, a request
tracker, but it's very adaptable, as you can see from the list of
applications it's been used for on the first page and the concepts
behind request trackers and CRM apps have a lot of parity.  Plus, it's
already got an abstracted DB backend w/Postgres support and it's written
in a language (I think) you understand.

I have two reasons to think it is the Linux box that is the problem.
First, I have used the Windows box for about ten minutes in the past
twn weeks, all of which were spent posting entries to Quickbooks. It
just sits there and runs 24/7. If I had any brains I'd shut it down and
save the power. I use the Linux computer nowadays 95+% of the time.
(Yay!) In other words, it is unlikely that any configs were changed on
the Windows box. And both boxes can go out to the internet via home
ethernet, switch, router, and modem. Both boxes can print over the
ethernet to my two networked Laserjets. It's just talking to each other
that is broken.

More important is what happened when I tried to remove and then
reinstall  samba via Synaptic. It removed OK, but reinstalling it gives
the following error message:

"E: /var/cache/apt/archives/samba_3.0.221ubuntu3.1_amd64.deb:
subprocess new pre-removal script returned error exit status 102."

Just a few minutes ago I found a thread on Ubuntu forums that was
started a few hours ago. Evidently I am not alone. Others are getting
the same error message. One person suggested "sudo apt-get clean" first,
then reinstalling. I did that, then did apt-get remove and apt-get
install from the command line. Same error message. So apt-get clean
does not resolve the issue.

At this point I think the culprit is one of those update things that
Ubuntu is so fond of. Until someone on the Ubuntu forums figures it out
and posts a workaround, I guess i'm down to my flash drive and hiking
back and forth.

Thanks for the suggestions. Barring some additional brilliant insight,
I'm going to wait until someone on the Ubuntu forums figures out what
is going on.

John,

I am not able to be at any of the clinics because of the scheduling 
conflict. I would really like to go to the clinics; however, my God has 
preeminence in my life... Is there a location (preferably in outer SE 
Portland) that I can drop Ubuntu discs during the week?

There's one flaw in your logic:

"Today neither can ping each other, not even using ip address."

Before screwing around any more with Samba, I would suggest following
Carlos' advice, and fix your networking.  Samba has nothing to do with
ping.  Once that is working, then you can worry about the Samba
install errors.  Hopefully you saved a good copy of your working Samba
configuration.

This is a bad assumption, if a windows box is running, it can change its
configuration at any time; for reasons unknown to us mere mortals.

Are you trying to get them to talk by using names or IP addresses?  Have
you tried any other forms of communication, like ping, ssh or nmap?

Try removing before cleaning, instead of cleaning before removing.

That is not entirely true, you could install WinSCP on your M$ product

But you can also use the cylinder of CO2 to drive your beer keg system. 
You do have your own keg system at home, don't you?

Free Geek is closed on Sundays, but we have a Free Geek person with a
key to let us in. The door on 10th Avenue will be open and there will
be a sign out on the sidewalk. Several of us arrive a bit early to set
things up, so if you arrive anytime after 1 you should find us
operational.

Worry not, the door will be open, with a nice obvious sign for you to
follow.  Since FreeGeek is closed, following the noise should bring
you to the main event.

Previous to the current difficulty, ping always worked. However, I
misstated something when I said "neither can ping each other." At the
moment it works from the Linux laptop to anyplace on the internet
(e.g., the Comcast DNS server addresses), it works to my two big HP
Laserjets via home ethernet (Jetdirect cards), but doesn't work from
the Linux laptop to the Windows desktop. However, the Windows desktop
can ping everything, including the Linux laptop. So evidently the only
time ping does not work is when the Linux laptop (192.168.1.102) tries
to ping the Windows desktop (192,168.1.100).

In the meantime, someone on the Ubuntu forums pointed out that the
error we are getting when removing and installing Samba has to do with
some links in /etc/rc.X that are incorrect. The poster pointed out that
doing a "remove completely" from Synaptic before doing an install will
clear those out. (Same as --purge.) I tried it and it worked. No more
error messages on removing and installing Samba. Nevertheless, I still
can't see anything on the Windows desktop, nor do I get a ping response
from it.

After much poking around on the Windows desktop, this is what I found:
	IP address: 192.168.1.100
	IP subnet: 255.255.255.0
	Default IP gateway: 192.168.1.1
	DHCP enabled: True
	MAC address: 00:40:F4:60:73:7A

Doing ifconfig on the Linux laptop gives me:

I don't understand why the Linux computer can ping the whole world,
except the Windows desktop.

I've also discovered something else on the Windows desktop. The network
card is a Realtek RTL8139(A). Device Manager shows it as working fine.
However, next to it are two additional "devices": Packet Scheduler
Miniport #6 Realtek RTL8139(A) PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter Realtek RTL8139
(A) PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter - Packet Scheduler Miniport The two
packet scheduler miniport entries have a yellow ! next to them, and
their properties indicate that they are not functioning properly
because of driver issues. I tried various things to fix them, but
nothing worked.

Then I remembered that I had a second bare-bones installation of
Windows 2000 on the desktop, to be used as a rescue installation. I
shut down and booted the bare-bones installation. Its Device Manager
listed just the Realtek card, no references to any packet scheduler
miniport things. And this installation was still able to ping and go to
the internet, etc., so evidently those two miniport things are not
essential. Before shutting down the rescue installation I tried pinging
it from the Linux laptop, but still no joy. I also tried looking at
Network Places with Nautilus, but it still sees just "Windows Network,"
but nothing inside the network.

Then I rebooted to the usual Windows desktop installation. I opened
Device Manager and disabled the two miniport things. That required
restarting, so I did so. When it came back up the Linux laptop still
couldn't see the Windows desktop or ping it. But Device Manager now
showed: Packet Scheduler Miniport #5 Packet Scheduler Miniport #6
Realtek RTL8139(A) PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter Very strange. And neither
of the miniport things was disabled, even though I had definitely
disabled them.

I still think the problem is somewhere on the Linux laptop. But it's
time for the Clinic, so that will have to wait until later.

To get to most of that info in the Winders world, click:

Start>Programs>Accessories>Command Prompt

At the prompt run, ipconfig

I'll leave it to the historians to explain the naming difference between 
ipconfig and ifconfig.

Check the Windows firewall -- I'm pretty sure in that it disabled
incoming ICMP by default.  Not that this will clear up your samba
problem.  

If I recall correctly (and I don't), you get to the windows firewall
configuration by doing a right-click-properties on the network
connection, "Advanced" and keep clicking until you find something that
looks like a firewall.

It's also possible that the routing tables on either the linux or
windows machine is off, though, with your setup (.1's and .255's) it's
pretty hard to screw up..

On XP it's 'ROUTE PRINT', on 'nix it's '/sbin/route -n' ...

OK, I have installed a fresh Ubuntu on another partition on the laptop.
It sees the Windows desktop just fine, the same as my main installation
of Ubuntu used to do. Conclusion: The Windows computer is not the
problem; something in my main Ubuntu installation is hosed.

And I just found out what it is: Firestarter. Yup, it was the Linux
firewall, not the Windows firewall. I went through System >
Administration and noticed that I had not checked out Firestarter yet.
I did so, it popped up a window, and there was a button to disable the
firewall. I clicked on it, then went to Places > Network Servers and
voil?!

So now I have to figure out how to keep Firestarter doing its thing
while still letting me see the Windows desktop. That will be another
adventure, I am sure. But at least now I found the problem.

Thanks to all for your inputs.

Meet at Jax, at 7:30 depart en masse for Blue Monk to check out its
possibilities as a future meeting site.  Discuss Option. 

Follow up discussion:  nominate non-present people for future AT meeting

I believe that is the updates to Windows XP and it is now disabling the 
PING responses. Take a look at your Firewall configuration on the 
Windows XP to ensure ICMP PING is enabled.

Subject: [PLUG] updating a kernel
Message-ID: <44BB4E83.5010107@verizon.net>

I did a fresh install of Breezy and switched to the latest kernel for 
686 SMP.  All is well and I am switching to the new install (email 
goodies mostly) giving my wife her own log in, etc.

The update manager wants to install an update to the 386 kernel that 
part of the fresh install.

I do not want to revert to the 386 kernel and am wondering how to tell 
the program not to install the patch, ever...or if I want to install it 
for some reason the newb doesn't understand.

Thanks

Since we had a speaker drop out on us at the last minute, we will have a 
general question and answer discussion, as well as a discussion on 
alternate venues for AT once football starts interfearing with our

Also suggestions for topics for later meeting and suggestions on ways or 
recruiting speakers.

Or you can just sit around and gab while consuming alcohol.

Where will this meeting be held?
Is it friendly for my 6 year old if we happen to be in the area while 
running errands today?
An address and basic directions would be helpful, if you want a newb to 
possibly show up...

The other is some 3D renderings of the plans for the

This is probably overkill for what you want to do, but you might find it

Remember the conversation about remote administration and being able to see
the boot process?

I wish I had that now.

I updated my mail server to the latest kernel for FC4 and rebooted.

It did not come back up.  I won't know why until tonight, when I can look at
the console.

Sigh.

Well, at least I am supposed to get my laptop back today.  Hopefully they
fixed it.  (And not like a vet fixes a cat.)

Although not an Advanced Topic, I could bring in a copy of the
"Welcome to Free Geek" video that I picked up on Saturday.  It
has its amusing moments, and some of the PLUG crowd appears in it.

Very few PC makers make it possible (much less easy) to push 
BIOS-level I/O to a serial port. HP/Compaq does; newer Opteron boards 
from SuperMicro do. PV Weasel cards will do the trick, but at $300 per 
card, they don't really provide a scalable solution.

Sigh. SPARCs and Alphas have had native serial console support since, 
what, 1990? It's not cutting-edge computer science. The boot-time 
logic is simple: "Hmm ... there's no keyboard attached to me; better 
spew out the serial port instead."

The hard part is then getting that output out through my firewall in a
secure manner without every script kiddie trying to hack it.

Considering I paid less than $300 for the whole system, it is a bit of an
additional expense.

I guess that is what I get for being impatient.

You're thinking of patents, which last 20 years.  Copyright, thanks to 
the Sonny Bono CETA passed by Congress, last life + 75 years or a flat 
95 years for corporate-created works.  Any copyrights created by Tandy 
14 years ago will be in force until 2087.  And that's only if Congress 
doesn't extend copyright terms again, which our Congresscritters have 
been all too willing to do.  They get handsomely rewarded by the 
entertainment and software lobbies for their cooperation.

I think you still have the -386 kernel installed, so it wants to keep
it updated (even if you're using the 686-smp one). You probably want
to just uninstall the 386 kernel image altogether.

Thank you.  I removed all the -386 kernel things I could find.  I no

I know it's not much help now, but I have a *very* small list of things 
I *never* do remotely:
1. kernel upgrades (if it bonks on the BIOS level, no remote daemon can 
save you... the only fix would be a magic box that tunneled raw VGA 
output, raw PS2/USB input, etc. over TCP/IP... is there such a beast?)
2. RAID juggling (if /boot is on a SCSI RAID 5, for example)
3. For that matter, anything SCSI. Requires waaaay too many goat 
sacrifices when *at* the console to even consider doing remotely. (Or, 
alternately, really good high end cables and terminators, which I 
*never* seem to see IRL.)
4. Any crypto library changes, or pam changes, if my sole admin access 
is ssh. (Want to know how to make an sshd session work when the daemon 
dies because libraries have changed? So do I.)
5. ifconfig changes (without a crond/atd backup script to restore 
settings) on single NIC machines.
6. For that matter, ipchains/iptables/ipfw changes (without a crond/atd 
backup script to restore settings) on even multi-NIC machines.

Anybody else have warnings to add to the historical pool of "Ooops", so 
future admin folks can spend less time pounding their heads mercilessly 
into keyboards?

I totally agree on this one. But one has to remember, today purchases
on this type of server are not usually made on technical merits, if any
technology is there, it is usually covered in so much gloss (as in glossies
a slang for marketing/advertising paper) that you need a chisel to
get to the dead tree material. IBM got to be IBM on their marketing and
sales skills,
and still do. They have tons of technology such as the pSeries but if you
look at the performance/cost matrix then add AIX, it is at my pc opinion
sad, AIX could have been something great. But knowing a couple (ex) IBM
engineering VP's, they constantly were under the eye of Armonk not to
steal sales form the X and I series, or for us old timers AS/400 and 390's.
They say the power-5 has so much going for it, such as the ability to
monitor internal registers, etc, but to get to see anything performance
wise you have to shell out $1000's and that is plural just to look.
Add that to get C, C++ and a dev environment will set you back about $4K.
There is only one third party OSS software source and it is getting really
bad, UCSD. Last time I had something that didn't work, their reply was
we just compile it, we don't use it. If IBM did not give them hardware
for basically free, my call is they would vanish as fast as Toronto did.
As to the hardware
to get a say 4 way server reasonable loaded say with 16 GB RAM, etc, will
set you back close to $60-100K, and that 4 way is not 4 CPU's, it is
a 4 Core CPU. Again, marketing. That $20K box they advertise is a scam
period.

1000% agree, that's why you saw it so much in gov't locations,
their only technology was in the quality of the sales presentations,
and the type of cloth the suits were made out of. The best is IBM.

Never used it, to me HP's fame was the ability to sell a complete
package, and the package worked. A good example is 1/2 of all
credit unions were HP, and it worked. Nothing to do with HPUX.

Here's the one I will disagree on. They had good tools but
where expensive, and the UI for the tools were mostly command
line. On packages they unofficially support SFW (SunFreeWare),
think of a fedora repository but for Solaris. When I admin'd
a shop with Sun/Solaris I had no trouble getting
the latest FOSS from SFW. 
As with AIX, the C/C++ compiler was not free, but not like
AIX, gcc was available from SFW and it worked. Sun's C got
you more performance but not much more unless you were doing some
fancy SMP tricks. More the libraries then the compiler itself.
Check out Dtrace .. it is totally awesome. Their Fortran was
very good.
As to hardware, if your application can really make use of
SMP and more importantly fine grained threading, you cant
beat something like the 890, especially if it has 64 GB of RAM.
Not everything can be run on a 1,000 chickens (*).
I was part of a group in 1995 that tried to convince Sun to
open up Solaris, there were quite a few Sun insiders that wanted to.
And don't get me going about the lame decision to kill Solaris x86.
Sun is their own worst enemy, period.

BSD is still there and still as stable, bullet proof etc. If I was not
so lazy I would prob have the devil (FreeBSD) on my mail/web/etc servers.
or I would have Solaris x86. May just do it.

OSX why why a greatly hacked 4.2 not 4.4 ? If I had gone with Apple in

to go back to A/UX. Anyone remember the Apple servers ?

Yup. Lets see... they've tried:
a) A/UX (circa Mac II series (ci/cx/fx,etc.), a *really* stripped down 
*nix, and the X/motif GUI was almost laughable.
b) a beastly (in the best and worst ways) AIX setup (circa "Apple 
Network Servers"), nice mini-computer boxen, but a tad overpriced,  SMIT 
makes me gnash my teeth, and the darned things took up *insane* amounts 
of physical space.
c) and now they're on to OSX's Mach/Darwin/BSD/NextOS/Gnu stack, and 
their server line takes up one rack height unit, but sounds like a 747 
and requires some severe rack *depth*.

It's almost as if Apple just had an aversion to using *nix variants that 
anybody else *liked*.

It's not *that* bad...

Just about any 1U server is loud; the form factor forces those tiny 
fans to spin so quickly. I've got Apples, Dells, Penguins, and others 
in the server room at work; they're all loud compared to an average 2U 
unit.

The PowerPC Xserve machines all have decent support for serial 
consoles; their Samba and OpenLDAP implementations work and play well 
with both Windows and Linux; and Apple has done a reasonable job of 
documenting the command-line equivalents of the GUI tools:

 * OS X 10.3.x:
   http://www.apple.com/server/pdfs/Command_Line.pdf

 * OS X 10.4.x:
   http://images.apple.com/server/pdfs/Command_Line_v10.4_2nd_Ed.pdf

I have three main beefs:

1. GUI Administration vs. ASCII Config Files

Apple's BSD underpinnings are mostly well-behaved. The hard part is 
getting the GUI to work and play well with ASCII config files. I like 
to keep configuration files in a Subversion repository and push into 
production via cfengine.

But ... the minute I open the administrative GUI for any given daemon, 
the GUI will parse and re-write the config file, often removing 
comments or directives it doesn't understand (even if the underlying 
daemon *does* understand them).

Then again, this isn't so much different from using GUI controls on 
Linux boxes. It's tough to mix and match administrative techniques.

2. Launch Manager

The hardest part for me to understand continues to be the launch 
manager. Apple's developers are trying to depart from both the BSD and 
System V init methods -- and I think they've got a ways to go before 
the system will mature.

That said, there have been rumblings in the Linux community about the 
shortcomings of the traditional init systems. Parallelization is a big 
topic, as are the increasing difficulties of getting daemons 
initialized in the correct order. The Gentoo rc-update system is 
another attempt to solve these problems in non-traditional ways.

3. Lack of Unified Package Management

Apple provides fairly timely updates for Unix utilities near the core 
of the system (httpd, smbd, etc.) -- but there's no vendor-approved, 
integrated way to add other *nix applications to the system.

You end up using fink, Portage, or DarwinPorts, all of which exist 
outside Apple's own package system. I've read rumors that Apple is 
addressing the problem, but so far it's just rumors.

Bill,

I googled it and found this 
http://reviews.cnet.com/NetGear_SC101_Storage_Central/4505-3382_7-31470528.html 


It says, "*The bad: * Currently accessible from only Windows machines;

Doesn't sound like what you would want.

It's called serial output.  There is no raw vga.  It's just text you're 
looking at.  Some BIOS's will have a setting for redirecting console 
output to a serial port.  If you're using a GUI then forget it.  This 
method is for command line only.  It also requires another computer next 
to it, or a remote console appliance.  You can watch the computer boot 
up from the beginning, even going into the BIOS to make changes.

Subject: [PLUG] newbie with an old system
Message-ID: <200607181533.48339.t_rex@verizon.net>

I want to take a few minutes to thank the crew at the Linux Clinic for 
helping me get my antique (a 486DX 133) up to a system that can be 
useful for another year or so.
A "tip of the hat" to Keith for his skill at troubleshooting my CDROM 
and USB problem and solving them . ?He fixed my USB problem but didn't 
know it. ?He got it working with his flash drive, a 64Meg, but it 
wouldn't work with my flash drive, a 1Gig.


After I got home I put the system back together, plugged in a 512Meg 
drive and turned it on.
It came up just fine, it put an 8 pin DIP icon on the screen for the 
flash drive and when I clicked on it I could access the folders and 
files on the flash drive. ?I shut the system down , plugged in the 1Gig 
drive and powered up the system, and it worked!!!

The only difference is, I put a folder on the 1Gig and plugged it in 
before I started the system.

The first of the Xserves were very, very loud - I hate being in the  
same room with them. The newer ones aren't bad at all. The graphical  
management tools on OS X Server get better with each release, but  
there is still the frustration over the "impedance mismatch" between  
the pretty stuff and the command line stuff.

However, there is a very major development at Apple that will - for  
sure - change all those complaints for the better. Seems they are  
gradually ditching all their non-Apple server stuff (transition is  
nowhere near complet and they are Eating Their Own Dogfood. The  
complaints we all have are going to become very real to the folks  
within Apple and we will see a lot of our frustrations addressed.

At least, that's my hope.

Message-ID: <659b9ea30607182134h760a3e18md830a3aa0921fdda@mail.gmail.com>

I was having trouble getting the default ubuntu postgres 7.4 to work
after I changed some configuration files.  So, I deleted the files in
/etc/postgresql and /var/lib/postgresql.  No matter what I try, I
cannot get the system to reinstall these files.  I have tried deleting
with all combinations of these commands:

apt-get remove --purge postgresql-7.4 postgresql-common postgresql-client-7.4
dkpg --purge postgresql-7.4 postgresql-common  postgresql-client-7.4

This seems to work in that I no longer see postgres when I run

dpkg -l | grep postgres

However, no matter what I do, I cannot reinstall the configuration
files, not with "apt-get install --reinstall postgresql-7.4 ..."  No
combination I've tried works.

I tried running dpkg -c like so to see if I could find the package
with the pg_hba.conf files:

 dpkg -c /var/cache/apt/archives/postgresql-common_27ubuntu1_all.deb

I could not find anything.

Does anyone know how I can reinstall these files?  I cannot believe
this has been this difficult for me.

Also:  definitely see "A Scanner Darkly" if you haven't already.
Highly recommended!

Chris

Chris,

   Version 7.4 is quite old. Grab 8.1.4 instead.

Left one out

Tru64 DEC Alpha. This one to me had a lot going for it. Another
example of West vs. East. The WRL (leave that as a challenge)
guys came out with some very nice small boxen, the engineers
where very gung ho' about not only doing the best big boxes but
did some very nice "affordable" boxes.

Tru64 had great SMP, a lot of other performance features, and
the start of a good open source library/site. But then
Maynard (another test :) )got involved, started the DEC
(and other suit type vendors) vs. Sun (technology, stability,
birkenstocks, etc) wars.

A good friend of mine at WRL left DEC for Sun, and the way he
put it, everyone at WRL wanted to be on the other side of that
war.

I know a guy who sold Alphas through the 90s and into 2001. From his 
POV, the writing was on the wall: the Alpha's performance lead was 
dropping steadily, DEC could no longer remain competitive charging 
premium prices on their smaller and mid-sized servers, GNU/Linux/*BSD 
were making Unix functionality a commodity, and DEC (then DEC/Compaq) 
needed to invest too much to maintain its ever-slimmer tech lead over 
the x86 crowd.

That, and (locally, at least) DEC/Compaq was *really* stingy with 
Tru64. When I was at OGI, we had a small-ish Alpha-based compute 
cluster. Their .edu sales staff came calling one day, and I 
practically begged for an eval copy. No dice. Feh!

last rant ..

<rant>

   Never let the suits decide who you customers are
   going to be.

   Early IBM (well '60-70s) if you were an edu
   that S/360 was free or at cost and didn't screw
   you later on suppor costs (Microsoft), ditto Sun,
   ditto early DEC (VAX/PDP-11) and so on. Many people
   don't know but IBM mainframers started the first
   FOSS group, COMMON (not the group that there today
   taken over by the as/400).

   I got to see some of the dirty tricks and hear
   about them what DEC Maynard (east coast/suits)
   did to make sure the Alpha boys never had a chance.

   Does this apply to Linux/Plug ? If you are in the
   biz of makeing $'s on software, don't let some
   'expert' convince you that certain markets are not
   worth your time.

The first readily apparent difference between you and him is the choice
of browser.  Now, IE (as an example of a steamy pile o' browser) requires
"http://" in front of a URL if it doesn't start with "www".  Maybe
safari is even worse, and requires the protocol at all times.

Can your friend ping "www.domain.com"?  Can he hit
"http://www.domain.com/squirrelmail" with lynx or wget?  Best to remove
variables from the equation when troubleshooting.

Do you have POP or IMAP running?  Can your friend hit it with pine?
Pine is good because you can send him a known good .pinerc file.  Either
it works, or it doesn't.  There is no ambiguity about the configuration.
You do not need to send him an openoffice doc with screenshots of kmail
account config, and hope he can follow it.

Any "Allow from" directives in your apache virtual host config that
would exclude your friend by IP address or other rule?

Is there an SSL cert involved?  Is he denying it, either consciously or
not?  Again, pine.

I have a piece of code in a subversion repository.  I want to see what 
changed from a specific date until now.

But...

What I want is to see what happened in each step along the way.  So if 
there was a change to the file from revision 3 to revision 4, I want to 
see the diff of that, then if there is a change from 4 to 5, I want to see 
that change, etc.

I could write a script to diff each version, but that gets a bit tedious.

Suggestions?

   It's probably the newspaper, not the Croatian government who has confused
open source software with open standards. But, that's common.

Alan,

   According to the Subversion manual, "svn diff" shows you the specific
details of how a file changed over time.

   svn diff can:

   1) Examine local changes.
   2) Compare your working copy to the repository.
   3) Compare repository to repository.

   You want number 3, I believe:

   svn diff --revision x:y filename.c
   svn diff --revision y:z filename.c
etc.

Other than scripting, my only suggestion would be to install Trac. 
It's got a seriously cool subversion repository browser.

I want a history of changes, not just the diffs.  I may have to script 
this.  "svn log" tells me the revision number of the changes, however.

My croatian is pretty nonexistent but the referred PDF is definately about 
Open SOURCE - specifically - open source programs, not open document formats. 
Any folks from .hr out there that can verify this?

Are you looking for a specific change?
 
  http://scratchcomputing.com/svn/Module-Subversion-Juggle/trunk/bin/find_change

(you'll need to 'cpan Getopt::Helpful')

If you actually want to pull every diff, hack it to dump $out to 
a file right after the run() call.  Then send a patch.

Thanks,
Eric

Unfortunately, his Subversion server is on AIX, by fiat.  Remember my

Croatian Government Adopts Free Software Policy in State Administration

Tomislav Domes
18 July 2006

Last week, on July 12, the Government of Croatia adopted an official document 
titled Directions for Development and Use of Open Source Code Computer 
Programmes in Bodies and Institutions of State Administration. In the 
document, the Government accepts the responsibility to develop, prepare and 
procure open-source software solutions in the development of information 
systems of state administration bodies.

This policy is motivated, according to the document, by the fact that 
proprietary software leads to great dependence on suppliers, which can damage 
the market competition. Furthermore, open source programmes increase the 
transparency of administration?s work and free access to information. 
Ultimately, the document states that the use of open source based solutions 
will reduce the unjustified budget spending and strengthen the domestic 
information science industry.

In addition to its fine argument on the need to introduce free software in 
administration, the document lists ten directions and recommendations for 
future government action in that area. Although the directions don?t offer 
concrete requirements and quantities (for instance, the targeted share of open 
source software solutions), as well as deadline for implementation, but they 
do introduce clear imperatives that can, in the worst possible case, be used 
as strong advocacy basis.

===

how far this is gonna go is a riddle to us all, but I'm sure such a document 
makes lots of campanies very nervous :)

Cheers,

Auke

I installed FC5 last night and then clicked the update link. It is 
still downloading after around 12 hours (DSL line).

What gives?

The thing is, being stuck at the LI prompt is actually more secure than a
problematic kernel. Your stuff is inaccessible to you, but it keeps the
intruders out as well.

With a distribution kernel though, this isn't all that hazardous. They
tend to ship working kernels, and the associated scripts tend to ensure
no steps are skipped (`pkgadd` a kernel patch on SunOS remotely, no
problem!). Also with GRUB understanding the filesystem and not needing to
be rerun, the danger has been greatly lessened. Still something to avoid
if you can, but a danger that can be minimized.

Installing a new custom kernel on a system 600 miles away which uses
LILO and Sun-style disk slices, definitely not for the faint of heart.
Finally got it to work for me though (the previous times I was a lot
closer, this time would of been a downtime of more than a week).

You've got a method to install SCSI disks remotely? Impressive.

Problematic on SunOS where open() never returns EBUSY, elsewhere, pretty
easy. You just have to make sure to only kill the server sshd process,
and then test that you can get back in successfully (meaning you keep a
termninal with a root shell open while testing). Not danger free, but
something I do without many worries.

Yeah, know that one two. /Somewhat/ less dangerous than kernel upgrades
(less actually if you're using a package manager).

Not really, you've gotten the ones you have to worry most about. Though
of your list I think only 1, 5 and 6 are really major. 2 and 3 you need
to be at the console to juggle the hardware anyway.

The tradition is that 100 years is "forever". This is why things like the
Panama Canal treaty was for 99 years. Given that the Constitution
explicitly says "for a limited time", I hold some hope that next time the
Supreme Court will take action.

You probably hit a bad mirror.  Kill the process and restart yum. (Use "ps 
-auxw | grep yum" to find the process to kill.  It spawns a child process 
with a weird name.)

Yum does not have a way to tell if the mirror is not broken yet way too 
slow.

Oh yeah, I know this one. This is what makes me avoid RedHat. This is
much worse when your setup *requires* those options, and there is no way
to make the GUI tool add them. Particularly annoying when the option has
existed more or less forever.

For one-off machines or very small networks, GUI tools can save time. 
In larger networks with policy-driven configurations, they just get in 
the way.

Red Hat's tools are completely, 100% optional. In my experience, they 
only rewrite files when you specifically tell them to change 
something or other.

The Mac GUI tools are way more aggressive. They'll rewrite any time 
you open them, regardless of whether you actually change any settings.

By default, yum points to a random mirror among Fedora's worldwide
repositories. When I've checked, I've been connected to mirrors in NZ,
Germany, and Brazil. While they're working on a "fastestmirror" RPM for
FC6, the best approach for now is to revise the files in
the /etc/yum.repos.d directories to specific nearby mirrors. 

I recommend that you modify the baseurl directive to point to nearby
mirrors such as at kernel.org (hosted at OSU) and fedora.cat.pdx.edu.
Comment out the mirrorlist directives. Multiple baseurl directives in
each stanza are allowed.

Thanks,
Mike

Okay here is my new deal.  My son has started to take an interest in the

at bedtime (he loves him some Hulk).  I know that KDE has a bunch of 
apps for education.  But what about Gnome?  I have switched to Dapper 
from Mandriva, and I don't think I will ever look back.  I would like to 
try and set him up with games that would help him learn some basics like 
typing and some easy spelling.  He is only 4 so I don't want to set him 
up and have him get frustrated because the games are too hard.  Any 
suggestions?

Ryan,

Yes, there is an entire suite for children. It is called debian 
junior... if I remember correctly.... but I am not logged into my linux 
box. Use Synaptic... and search for Educational software. There may even 
be a button on the left side that is marked 'education'... if so, click 
it and it will give you all of the educational software packages you 
could ever want....

Also, Edubuntu is pretty good. Personally, I like Debian, but to each 
his own!

Well, occasionally I *will* do "cowboy" work, but those gigs come with 
hefty disclaimers and sign-offs. Or it's on my "own" old hardware 
(which, of course, I have already made nearly all the mistakes on, and 
thus know how to recover).

I guess *never* is more of a "never if I expect to keep a client for 
more than 6 months". Even when they've signed off to a policy which 
states "this may render the system permanently unusable", mgmt. folks 
want to know "how many minutes" until a system is back.

Well, so does a melted motherboard. :-) Increases the time-to-recovery

Yeah, if one can *get* to grub, and/or a functioning init level, it's 
possible to use a rollback/grub.conf change script to roll-back to a 
working state it, say, the rollback job isn't killed by a sysad getting 
a good login within 10 minutes after reboot/init/etc.

...custom binary RAID modules (gee, thanks, Dell!)...
...netboot+wireless drivers...

Basically, anything that has to do with lower-level access to a 
bootable kernel and enough being init'ed to login.

Some colo's allow you to ship hardware to be installed with minimal 
instructions like "stick this in the RAID module bay with the failure 
light". I'd advise against doing it, or expect to burn long distance 
minutes pretty heavily.

I've nuked this lots of times on linux with hand re-compiles (for speed 
reasons) of various crypto-libs over the years (make install step).... 
I just got into the habit of making a "safe, outside of program space, 
login" (usually telnet from a machine inside the perimeter). Maybe this 
rule is just because of working with some cruftier boxen, or I'm 
missing something simple. I dunno.

Well, 2 and 3 are really things that should be possible to do mostly 
remotely (aside from physical moving of disks), *provided* that the 
booting system components, and the raid system components, being 
juggled, are separate.

Example: say a big fileserver with lots of images. 'images' is a RAID 
mount at /home/Images. Server can boot with, or without, the RAID or 
RAID modules. If software RAID, this can be juggled remotely. If 
hardware/BIOS raid... it's trickier.

Hm... Oh wait. I don't have anything in the list yet about MBR-related 
proggies... they belong somewhere in there, no? Upgrades that 
(not-so-nicely) "repair" or "refresh" or "replace" a MBR?

Hello!

I remember that most of the KDE stuff works on Gnome. I do not know if you 
have realized that in the Add/Remove Programs. once the Adept program starts 
up you can choose to download from a number of options. Add them all and see 
if the choice of programs changes. If it does not go to /etc/apt and un # all 
the lines that have what looks like a url after them. This will greatly 
increase the number of programs to choose from.

Subject: [PLUG] Trouble with nfs...
Message-ID: <1153250462.44bd349e1d79c@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I have an old Redhat 7.3 server that I want to be an nfs client
to a newer Fedora Core 3 machine, to back it up.  Every time I try,
the old system locks.  It starts out okay, but then I get nfs server 
not responding errors on it (in another terminal).  I want to back 
this server up so I can upgrade it, is there an nfs upgrade that will 
install to Redhat 7.3 so that it can use a Fedora Core 3 exported 
share?  I know the server is working because I'm running two machines 
nfs root off of it.  I'm thinking there was an nfs bug back then that
is causing all this trouble.

I've thought of vmware, but I don't have a license for it, a royal 
pain.  The only other thought I have is to set up Fedora nfs 
root with local volume support and back it up that way, but that 
would be overkill compared to a simple upgrade and take a great
deal of time.

Subject: [PLUG] Package management...
Message-ID: <1153359944.44bee0487ba4f@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I'm trying to work with an evaluation copy of Redhat 8 and need to strip it
down as much as possible.

I remember a utility called gnorpm, but I don't know if that existed in 
Redhat 8.  Another annoyance, there seem to be a lot of packages that 
won't remove easily for internationalization.  Is there a distribution 
that is currently maintained which is meant for NFS root installations 
that are used to backup/restore/and network test clients?

I'm trying to support gnome and am having a heck of time removing all
kinds of unneeded support.  For example, is html support needed?  What
is really necessary as far as gtk, tk, etc?  The pango package doesn't
want to uninstall, but I suspect that I can force it off safely.  The
smaller footprint I can get: nfs, X, archiving tools, partitioning tools,
print/pdf/postcript support and gnome into, the better.  Experiments have 
shown me that Redhat 8 works as an nfs client to Centos 4.3 Final and 
Fedora Core 3 where older is probably less bloated than newer.  I'm also 
after something that will work on older computers such as 486's.

Well, can someone explain how AMD, Intel, etc. produce processors 
that support the same binaries without violating copyrights?  Does 
each competing company reinvent the  wheel?  Imagine where the 
electronics industry would be today if noone, save one company, 
could produce transistors without paying a huge royalty?

Practically speaking, you probably only need a copyright for 10 years 
or less to profit from your work.  Even where copyright means you have
to pay to use someone else's idea seperately from them, that's
reasonable if the price isn't too high.  It seems the idea behind
copyrights is that a business, at least temporarily, needs a monopoly
to offset the cost of it's development.  Trouble is, that company
can control that idea even if that means leaving people behind who
want to see it taken further.

The GPL was created to solve a problem, the inability to share software
freely and efficiently.  Is there an analogue to it for electronic 
hardware?  Are the days when Commodores came with blue prints behind
us?

I used to use fedora.cat.pdx.edu as my rsync source, but I had
occasional failures when rsyncd hadn't been enabled at boot time; at one
point I found I hadn't gotten an update in a week or more, so I gave up
and switched to mirrors.kernel.org and haven't really had any problems
since.

If you can find (or get some to make for you) a pre-setup virtual
machine, you can use vmware player for free.  It runs all machines
created by vmware workstation or others, it just can't create its own.

I realize there is a time to learn, but it seems you're going to get rid 
of the old anyway.  Maybe it's best in this situation to just get back 
to the basics.  I would just tar up my stuff then scp the archives to 
the other machine.

Gcompris is a good one to start out with, plus all the education packages in
Ubuntu are worth looking into.  As for games, not a clue.

I'll second Gcompris, and also suggest TuxTyping
(http://www.happypenguin.org/show?TuxTyping) I used both when I
switched from QWERTY to DVORAK, and found both to be pretty solid
programs.  (Gcompris does much more than typing, btw.)

Thanks for reminding me, pretty much anything with Tux would be a good
choice,:

Tuxracer
Tuxtype
Tuxpaint
Supertux
Tuxart
Tuxpuck

Subject: [PLUG] Encrypted data pass-phrase
Message-ID: <44BFC13E.4060105@acm.org>

If that isn't vague enough I'll try to confuse it some more with details.

I'm working on a system that needs to run charges against customers 
credit cards periodically or sporadically.  This will typically be more 
than one card at a time at a time and could happen anywhere from once a 
year to twice a day.

The CC numbers are encrypted before being stored.

We'd prefer to not have someone sitting at the console :-) entering the 
pass-phrase for each run.

We've come up with several ideas how to make this fairly secure and 
hands-off but I have the impression several on the list have done 
something similar and might have other ( better ) ideas.


TIA,
Rod

WHY????

Redhat 8 is broken.  Redhat 9 fixed most of the brokeness of that version, 
but not all of it.  If you have to use something that old, I suggest using 
either Redhat 7.3 or Redhat 9.

Just don't put it out unprotected on the net.

As for package management, there are not any real useful tools for Redhat 
8/9.  You might be able to build Yum for it.  All the older tools are a 
headache and a half.

Gcompris has a cool feature of adding different games and applications 
to it. You could make gcompris into a console that can access all of the 
children's stuff. I have not gotten into it that much, but I think I am 
going to after looking into it further.

I have RH9 that I could kick to you as well.... I have both single disc 
and 3 disc installation sets. Maybe even meet up this afternoon?

I have a full version of Redhat 9 as well.  (Not to mention all of the 7.x 
series and most of the other Redhat releases going back to 4.2.)

Or use RHEL/Centos 2.1 or RHEL/Centos 3.  RHEL 2.1 is similar to
Redhat 7.2 and RHEL 3 is similar to Redhat 9.   But they are
maintained and still get security fixes.

Centos 2.1 uses yum 1.0.3.  Centos 3 uses yum 2.0.8.  Not as nice as
the current yum 2.6 but much better than using rpm directly.

Be careful with lubricants, and follow the manufactures recommendations 
when possible. Oil mixed with dust bunnies can make the problem worse. 
When in doubt, I use a graphite lubricant. On a similar note, WD-40 is 
not intended to be a lubricant, but rather a solvent.

When I worked for DEC, a vacuum/blower was standard equipment for 
preventive maintenance.

Agreed.  The big changes on yum in the later versions is handling 
multi-architecture installs (like x86_64), which is not an issue with 
something that old.

If you really need RH 9 or RH 7.3, I'd suggest taking a serious look 
at CentOS 2 and 3, which are Free rebuilds of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 
2.1 and 3. RHEL 2.1 is quite like RH 7, RHEL 3 like RH 9. The 
end-of-life promises on these products are quite specific:

  RHEL 4 (see CentOS 4):   Feb 29, 2012
  RHEL 3 (see CentOS 3):   Oct 31, 2010
  RHEL 2.1 (see CentOS 2): May 31, 2009

  Source: http://www.redhat.com/security/updates/errata/

The Fedora Legacy project has, to my mind, been quite spotty in 
maintaining updates (of course, it's not like I've pitched in to help, 
so I'm not really casting blame...), while RHEL/CentOS updates are 
typically quite timely.

Mel,

   Actually not. While you're correct that a lot of folks think that WD-40 is
a lubricant, it actually stands for Water Displacement. Think of it as a
drying agent.

   Yup. That's why I was a ham radio operator when I was a kid and spent a
lot of time designing and building the electronics for our cyclotron when I
was in high school. We got it running just before I graduated; first high
school in the country with a working particle accelerator.

Since "the final word" was said 2.5 years ago, I'm thinking "what's 
devfs?"  I'm pretty sure I never had it on any system (except the 
Gentoo one that didn't work right.)

  http://kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev_vs_devfs

> Somewheres I read that from kernel 2.6.13 on, you get only udev.

Was it here?

  http://kerneltrap.org/node/5340

Debian's udev started conflicting with their hotplug package and that 
got me to the point where I can't switch between 2.6.9 and 2.6.(>11 or 
so) without some rather painful cherry-picking of files (vs losing 
wireless and maybe a few other pieces of hardware like the display.)

Devfs is dead, dead, dead.  It has not seen an update in over a year.  The 
only distro that used it to any extent was Mandrake and it was buggy as 
hell.  The kernel maintainers are planning on removing it from the kernel 
as soon as they can, if not sooner.  (Greg KH has been trying to kill it 
for a while now.)

I am not certain if udev or sysfs is the "one true way" at this point.

This is actually a common problem with that particular version of red hat.

See RedHat bugs 64921, 64984, and 65069 for details. Go to

What version the Herl is the old machine running?

   In the ORA Emacs book (p. 278) are directions for adding a timestamp to an
html file. But, I find nothing that shows me how to add a timestamp in other
files.

   Specifically, I'd like to add a timestamp to the revision section of a
program file when I've modified it. Is there an emacs function I can assign
to a key to do this? Ali?

TIA,

Are you perhaps working in a repository where there might be large gaps
in the sequence (from commits happening in areas you aren't interested
in maybe) ?

> I could write a script to diff each version, but that gets a bit tedious.

svn log -r $BEGIN:$END --quiet $REPO_OR_PATH   | \  
sed -e '/^-\+$/d' -e 's/^r\([0-9]\+\).\+$/\1/' | \ 
{ while read rev; do svn diff -r "$rev" $REPO_OR_PATH > "r${rev}.diff"; done }

I expect that to get the relevant revision numbers (stripping off cruft)
then one-by-one create a number of files between r$BEGIN.diff and r$END.diff .

> Suggestions?

Might:
svnadmin dump (with appropriate revision range, delta and incremental usage)
followed by a 
svndumpfilter (include/exclude to get what you want)
... be the droids you're looking for?

The output would be an svn dumpfile containing the changes you are
interested in - which is fairly readable and brings in some changes a
usual svn diff won't/can't. You could also play-it-back into a
temporary repository if that was a good way to work with it.

! This does have the distinct drawback of being, probably, the most resource intensive !

Maybe add a function to Semantic Highlight Edits Mode Hook or Vc Before
Checkin Hook?  Or write a save function of your own, and bind it to a
keychord of your choice.  That's how to get the timestamp function to
run at the right time.

To actually write a timestamp into a file, I scraped this up online.
Function foo is the one you call with M-x foo while in the buffer you
want to timestamp and save.  The other 3 functions just give you a
choice of date formats.

I didn't bother placing the timestamp with much elegance because I don't
know where you need it exactly.  Elisp buffer functions are easy enough
to find docs for and use.

(defun foo ()
   (interactive)
   (goto-char (point-min))
   (insert (insert-date-iso))
   (save-buffer))

(defun insert-date-iso ()
   "Inserts the current local date and time (to the minute) into the current buffer
before Point. The data are formatted per ISO 8601 specification. This is useful for
prefixing entries in a log book."
   (interactive)
   (setq now (decode-time)
         final-string (format "%04d-%02d-%02dT%02d:%02d+%d"
                              (nth 5 now)          ; yyyy
                              (nth 4 now)          ; mm
                              (nth 3 now)          ; dd
                              (nth 2 now)          ; HH
                              (nth 1 now)          ; MM
                              (/ (nth 8 now) 36))) ; UTCO
   (insert final-string))

(defun insert-date-stamp ()
   "Inserts the current local date into the current buffer before Point. The data are
formatted per ISO 8601 short specification and prefixed with my initials 'MJL'. This
is useful for inserting mod comments into code files."
   (interactive)
   (setq now (decode-time)
         final-string (format "MJL%04d%02d%02d - "
                              (nth 5 now)          ; yyyy
                              (nth 4 now)          ; mm
                              (nth 3 now)))        ; dd
   (insert final-string))

(defun insert-date-dow ()
   "Inserts the current local date and the day of the week into the current buffer
before Point. The date data are formatted per ISO 8601 specification. The DOW is
expanded to the full name. This is useful for prefixing day entries in a log book."
   (interactive)
   (setq DOWlist '(Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday))
   (setq now (decode-time)
         final-string (format "%04d-%02d-%02d %s"
                              (nth 5 now)                 ; yyyy
                              (nth 4 now)                 ; mm

Subject: [PLUG] setting up SSH to chrrot to user homeDir
Message-ID: <44C05B6C.2020500@emediatedesigns.com>

Hello all,

Been looking about the wonderful web and reading about how I could 
achieve this but all that I've found makes it sound like I need to setup 
yet another customer product of sorts.  So...

Is there a way that I can configure SSHD to allow clients to login but 
be chrooted to their home directory? 

FTP does this well and I would like to have it do the same for SSHD.  
I'm actually surprised this isn't a configuration option on OpenSSH as 
it would make sense that you would want to allow certain shell access 
but not allow all people to go about browsing your entire server. 

So, is this possible?  Do I need some sort of custom SSH or is there 
another program I can use to give secure Shell access?

Thanks,

Josh

They are complimentary.  udev is userspace, so it uses sysfs to get
information about the system state when it is signaled by
/sbin/hotplug.

I cheated for my date function, and just used a shell command:

(defun enter-date nil
  "Enter today's date at point."
  (interactive)
  (shell-command "date '+%B %d, %Y'" 1))

Think about it.  ~/.login
/usr/sbin/chroot $HOME

with symlink in home directory:

ls -l $HOME

drwxr-x--- <user> users .
crwxr-xr-x  root  root  ..
drwxrwxrwx  root  root  home

cd home
ls -l
lrwxrwxrwx  root  root  ../.. <user>


You would need to have executables within your jail.  Libraries also.
Much work.  If you system is one partition, hard links might work.  Mine
isn't so cannot run chroot.

TINST

as Kenneth already explained this is very much a nightmare to setup, and FTP 
can do it since the user only needs 1 exectuable (ftpd) running on the server 
after login, so that executable itself can chroot at startup.

If you really want to permit users to login but not see something outside of 
their homedirectories, then you should investigate more secure ways (chroots 
can be busted, yes even with grsecurity) such as UML or providing a fully 
chrooted install with sshd running already in it.

If you're only looking into offering limited functionality (e.g. sftp-server) 
you might also want to see if you can get around it by just allowing the user 
to run only one type of connection that way.

Cheers,

Auke

Just because I have a bad habit of reading these things ---  Does any

The part I am interested in is the "You may make and distribute

Being a consultant that enjoys eating and ....  I would rather not see this.

7 Tech Northwest is proud to announce two upcoming trainings in August:

Plone System Administration: 15 - 17 August
http://www.7technw.com/training/t-padmin01-f

Build by Design: Rapid Product Dev for Plone using ArchGenXML: 29 - 31 
August
http://www.7technw.com/training/t-agx02-f

Both trainings are in Vancouver, WA.

Our new Plone System Administration class will give any IT professional 
a slid overview of how Zope and Plone work, how to deploy them, and many 
key admin tasks. We will be covering a key new technology for Plone 
called CacheFu. This application suite can increase the speed of a Plone 
site by 10-40 times. We will cover the basics of how to implement 
CacheFu in both a Windows and Linux environment.

Please see the training page for more details:
http://www.7technw.com/training/t-padmin01-f



Many of you have been interested in ArchGenXML for some time, some may 
already have been experimenting with it, others may have not even heard 
of this great RAD tool for Plone. Some of you may have seen a demo of it 
first hand at some event, read something about it online, or seen one of 
a few pod-casts that show off this amazing technology as the 
demonstrator cranks out a new Plone product almost faster than you can 
follow.

To put it simply, ArchGenXML allows you to create fully functional, 
ready to install, Plone products from a drawing. In this apparent magic 
act, the drawing is a UML diagram and the resulting product is based on 
Archetypes.

This technology is not actually magical, does allow a developer to 
quickly visualize an idea and move it into a working product very 
quickly. This tool is the product of the hard work and dedication of 
many key developers in the Plone community. Every user has a different 
perspective on how it fits into their tool-set, and how deep down the 
rabbit hole they tend to plunge, but all will agree that it is a key 
feather in the Plone development communities hat.

We will be spending most of three days delving into all aspects of this 
tool. Every student will leave with both first hand knowledge of the 
capabilities of this tool, and personal experience in it's use. We will 
also explore other related tools including the future replacement of 
ArchGenXML, Genesis.

We will start with a foundation that will allow you to best capitalize 
on the benefits ArchGenXML has to offer, starting with a quick reminder 
of what it means to be a product in Plone, then an overview of 
Archetypes, and then into an introduction to UML. This foundation will 
give us a solid base from which to build our understanding of ArchGenXML.

We will be offering these trainings again in the future as demand 
dictates as well as other Plone trainings. See our website for details.

What about setting the users shell to rbash or bash -r.

>From the bash man page:
RESTRICTED SHELL
       If bash is started with the name rbash, or the -r option is supplied at
       invocation,  the  shell becomes restricted.  A restricted shell is used
       to set up an environment more controlled than the standard  shell.   It
       behaves  identically  to bash with the exception that the following are
       disallowed or not performed:

             changing directories with cd
             setting or unsetting the values of SHELL, PATH, ENV, or BASH_ENV
             specifying command names containing /
             specifying  a  file  name containing a / as an argument to the .
                builtin command
             Specifying a filename containing a slash as an argument  to  the
                -p option to the hash builtin command
             importing  function  definitions  from  the shell environment at
                startup
             parsing the value of SHELLOPTS from  the  shell  environment  at
                startup
             redirecting  output using the >, >|, <>, >&, &>, and >> redirec-
                tion operators
             using the exec builtin command to replace the shell with another
                command
             adding  or  deleting builtin commands with the -f and -d options
                to the enable builtin command
             Using the  enable  builtin  command  to  enable  disabled  shell
                builtins
             specifying the -p option to the command builtin command
             turning off restricted mode with set +r or set +o restricted.

Dale,

Here is the license agreement from the Suse (Novell) Website:


  SUSE Linux 10.1


    Novell Software License Agreement

This software license agreement applies to SUSE Linux 10.1 only. If you 
are searching for license and maintenance agreements for other Novell 
products, please visit the Novell Licensing Programs site 
<http://www.novell.com/licensing/eula/index.html>.

SUSE Linux 10.1
Novell Software License Agreement

PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. BY INSTALLING OR OTHERWISE USING
THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING ITS COMPONENTS), YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF
THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, DO NOT DOWNLOAD,
INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE AND, IF APPLICABLE, RETURN THE ENTIRE
UNUSED PACKAGE TO THE RESELLER WITH YOUR RECEIPT FOR A REFUND. THE
SOFTWARE MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED, OR FURTHER DISTRIBUTED WITHOUT
PRIOR WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION FROM NOVELL.

RIGHTS AND LICENSES

This Novell Software License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal
agreement between You (an entity or a person) and Novell, Inc. 
("Novell") with respect to the software product identified in the
title of this Agreement, media (if any) and accompanying documentation
(collectively the "Software").

The Software is a collective work of Novell.  You may make and use
unlimited copies of the Software for Your distribution and use within
Your Organization.  You may make and distribute unlimited copies of
the Software outside Your organization provided that: 1) You receive
no consideration; and, 2) you do not bundle or combine the Software
with another offering (e.g., software, hardware, or service).  The
term "Organization" means a legal entity, excluding subsidiaries and
affiliates with a separate existence for tax purposes or for legal
personality purposes. An example of an Organization in the private
sector would be a corporation, partnership, or trust, excluding any
subsidiaries or affiliates of the organization with a separate tax
identification number or company registration number. In the public
sector, an example of Organization would be a specific government
body or local government authority.

The Software is a modular operating system.  Most of the components
are open source packages, developed independently, and accompanied by
separate license terms.  Your license rights with respect to
individual components accompanied by separate license terms are
defined by those terms; nothing in this Agreement (including, for
example, the "Other License Terms and Restrictions," below) shall
restrict, limit, or otherwise affect any rights or obligations You may
have, or conditions to which You may be subject, under such license
terms.

While the license terms for a component may authorize You to
distribute the component, You may not use any Novell marks (e.g., SUSE
and SUSE Linux) in distributing the component, whether or not the
component contains Novell marks.

OTHER LICENSE TERMS AND RESTRICTIONS

The Software is protected by the copyright laws and treaties of the
United States ("U.S.") and other countries and is subject to the
terms of this Agreement. The Software is licensed to You, not sold.

The Software may be bundled with other software programs ("Bundled Programs"). Your license rights with respect to Bundled Programs
accompanied by separate license terms are defined by those terms;
nothing in this Agreement shall restrict, limit, or otherwise affect
any rights or obligations You may have, or conditions to which You may
be subject, under such license terms.

Novell reserves all rights not expressly granted to You. You may not:
(1) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software except
and only to the extent it is expressly permitted by applicable law or
the license terms accompanying a component of the Software; or (2)
transfer the Software or Your license rights under this Agreement, in
whole or in part.

MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT

Novell has no obligation to provide maintenance or support for the Software.

OWNERSHIP RIGHTS

No title to or ownership of the Software is transferred to You. Novell
and/or its licensors owns and retains all title and ownership of all
intellectual property rights in the Software, including any
adaptations or copies. You acquire only a license to use the Software.

LIMITED WARRANTY

For ninety (90) days from Your date of purchase, Novell warrants that
(1) any media on which the Software is delivered is free from physical
defects; and (2) the Software will substantially conform to the
documentation accompanying the Software. If the defective items are
returned to Novell or if You report the nonconformity to Novell within
ninety (90) days from the date of purchase, Novell will at its sole
discretion either resolve the nonconformity or refund the license fees
You paid for the Software. Any misuse or unauthorized modification of
the Software voids this warranty. THE FOREGOING WARRANTY IS YOUR SOLE
AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND IS IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED. (The foregoing warranty does not apply to Software
provided free of charge. SUCH SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.)
 
THE SOFTWARE IS NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED OR INTENDED FOR USE OR
DISTRIBUTION WITH ON-LINE CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS
REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR
FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION, COMMUNICATION, OR CONTROL SYSTEMS,
DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES, WEAPONS SYSTEMS, OR OTHER USES IN WHICH
FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE COULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY,
OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.

THE SOFTWARE IS ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH CERTAIN COMPUTERS AND OPERATING
SYSTEMS. THE SOFTWARE IS NOT WARRANTED FOR NON-COMPATIBLE
SYSTEMS. Call Novell or Your dealer for information about
compatibility.

Non-Novell Products. The Software may include or be bundled with
hardware or other software programs licensed or sold by a licensor
other than Novell. NOVELL DOES NOT WARRANT NON-NOVELL PRODUCTS. ANY
SUCH PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS. ANY WARRANTY SERVICE
FOR NON-NOVELL PRODUCTS IS PROVIDED BY THE PRODUCT LICENSOR IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE LICENSOR WARRANTY.

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE RESTRICTED BY LAW, NOVELL DISCLAIMS AND EXCLUDES
ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. NOVELL MAKES NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION OR PROMISE NOT
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LIMITED WARRANTY. NOVELL DOES NOT WARRANT
THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL SATISFY YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION
OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED. Some jurisdictions do not allow
certain disclaimers and limitations of warranties, so portions of the
above limitations may not apply to You. This limited warranty gives
You specific rights and You may also have other rights which vary from
state to state.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

(a) Consequential Losses. NEITHER NOVELL NOR ANY OF ITS LICENSORS,
SUBSIDIARIES, OR EMPLOYEES WILL IN ANY CASE BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, TORT, ECONOMIC OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE,
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS OR DATA, EVEN
IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES.

(b) Direct Damages. IN NO EVENT WILL NOVELL'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR
DIRECT DAMAGES TO PROPERTY OR PERSON (WHETHER IN ONE INSTANCE OR A
SERIES OF INSTANCES) EXCEED 1.25 TIMES THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE
SOFTWARE OUT OF WHICH SUCH CLAIM AROSE [OR $50 (U.S.) IF YOU RECEIVED
THE SOFTWARE FREE OF CHARGE].  The above exclusions and limitations
will not apply to claims relating to death or personal injury. In
those jurisdictions that do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
damages, Novell's liability shall be limited or excluded to the
maximum extent allowed within those jurisdictions.

GENERAL TERMS

Term. This Agreement becomes effective on the date You legally acquire
the Software and will automatically terminate if You breach any of its
terms. Upon termination of this Agreement, You must destroy the
original and all copies of the Software or return them to Novell and
delete the Software from Your systems.

Benchmark Testing.  This benchmark testing restriction applies to You
if You are a software vendor or if You are performing testing on the
Software at the direction of or on behalf of a software vendor.  You
may not, without Novell's prior written consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, publish or disclose to any third party the results of any
benchmark test of the Software. If You are a vendor of products that
are functionally similar to or compete with the Software ("Similar Products"), or are acting on behalf of such a vendor, and You publish
or disclose benchmark information on the Software in violation of this
restriction, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
Similar Product's end user license agreement, and in addition to any
other remedies Novell may have, Novell shall have the right to perform
benchmark testing on Similar Products and to disclose and publish that
benchmark information and You hereby represent that You have authority
to grant such right to Novell.

Transfer. This Agreement may not be transferred or assigned without
the prior written approval of Novell.

Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the
State of Utah, U.S. Any action at law relating to this Agreement may
only be brought before the courts of competent jurisdiction of the
State of Utah. If, however, Your country of principal residence is a

Association, this Agreement is governed by the laws of that country,
and any action at law may only be brought before a court of competent
jurisdiction of that country.

MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION OR PROMISE THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM, OR IN
ADDITION TO, THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

Waiver. No waiver of any right under this Agreement will be effective
unless in writing, signed by a duly authorized representative of the
party to be bound. No waiver of any past or present right arising from
any breach or failure to perform will be deemed to be a waiver of any
future right arising under this Agreement.

Severability. If any provision in this Agreement is invalid or
unenforceable, that provision will be construed, limited, modified or,
if necessary, severed, to the extent necessary, to eliminate its
invalidity or unenforceability, and the other provisions of this
Agreement will remain unaffected.

Novell products directly or indirectly and via any means, including
electronic transfer, is wholly responsible for doing so in accordance
with the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the laws of host

The rbash idea is a good one but there are still many more steps to take to
make sure the user stays within that shell and within the confines of their
home directory.  You have to create a directory somewhere like /usr/progs
and put the binaries and only the binaries that you want the user to have
access to and then declare that directory and the users only path in their
.bash_profile or .bashrc or both.  Better off if any programs with potential
shell escapes like pine, vi, emacs etc, are all replaced with a restricted
version of the binary such as rvi or rvim, etc.  You will also need to
declare restrictive aliases for each user to prevent them access to any
other shells so declare an alias for ksh to /bin/rbash and csh ->
/bin/rbash, so what you are doing here is making sure that any shell they
attempt to get to will always put them back into and keep them in rbash.
 Make sure also that you prevent them from using the unalias command by
declaring that to /bin/rbash as well and then you must prevent the user from
modifying the file so do a chattr +i on the .bashrc or .bash_profile files
in their home directories.  I did manage to do this but it was a pain and
quite a bit of work and a lot of trial and error.  Feel free to ask

This worked for me using rbash:

Create an account where login shell is rbash.  Create a .bashrc like
this in the user's home directory:

PATH=/opt/wiab/binary_data/upload/bin
PS1='Master Upload #

I symlinked only the applications I wanted into
/opt/wiab/binary_data/upload/bin.  You can only run those applications
when you are logged in.

Thinking about it, I guess you'd need some way to keep the user from
editing, moving or deleting that file, else they'd be able to disable it and
then log in normally.

Subject: [PLUG] iptables and nfs
Message-ID: <44C1535D.4080804@acm.org>

We're just getting an "interesting" set of systems tied together.  One 
provides an nfs share for three others.

While fiddling around with the iptables settings on one of the nfs 
clients ( so I can access it from home this week-end I ) I did a service 
sshd restart.  Just few seconds later one of our testers reported an 
error related to a part of the application that accessed the share.

Sure enough a quick 'df' on the client hung at the nfs portion ... 
really hung and a check of the server said the mount was busy.  Finally 
I restarted  'nfs' and the nfs mount ... mounted.

The iptables setup ( and nfs configuration ) is pretty simple and based 
on some research that lead me to a Redhat page.

So is anyone else doing nfs and running iptables?  Does this feel like 
an iptables issue?


TIA,
Rod

this sounds good.  But can the user just change the path in .bashrc and 
then have access to any file?

Post your iptables script, and the output of an 'iptables --list'.

Also, if you can recreate and test the ussue, it'd be good to watch
some ethereal captures during it to see if you're getting RST's, ICMP
unreachable, invalid or otherwise bogus traffic patterns on port
connects.

One thing that came to mind, a lot of older distros have shown me
issues with the RPC advertised ports not matching up to the port the
daemon is running on (i.e. rpcinfo -p differs from the port
mountd/statd, etc are listening on).  You didnt' mention specifics, so
it's kinda hard to do anything but speculate :)

Tim,

Reading backwards on post this sounds like the only option there is.  
Too bad. I would have liked an easier way to accomplish this.  I like 
SSH but do to it's nature of sharing the entire computer file system I 
have elected to not allow it.  Now I need to and I'm trying to judge 
rather to just allow and trust all SSH users or find a more secure way 
of giving them access but locking their ability. 

When you mentioned that you did a Chattr on the files I'm unfamiliar 
with this.  I see it is like chmod but I think not the same.  I see by 
putting a +i with chattr on a file that prevents a user from modifying 
the files.  Hmm, okay the more I write the more I understand.  Perhaps I 
could do this without too much more. 

How do I get the other shells to re-route back to rbash? 

Thanks,

Josh

The man page says:

"the following are disallowed or not performed:

       ?      changing directories with cd
,,,,"

So, no, you cannot change directories.

Read the man page.  The first page is super simple and tells you
everthing you need to know.

pretty easy, just use the alias command in their .bashrc file like this

alias sh='/bin/rbash'
alias ksh='/bin/rbash'
alias csh='/bin/rbash'
alias bash='/bin/rbash'
alias tcsh='/bin/rbash'
alias unalias='/bin/rbash'

And add to that any other shells that might possibly be on the system such
as ash or zsh etc...then make both .bashrc and .bash_profile immutable using
chattr +i /home/user1/.bashrc and chattr +i /home/user1/.bash_profile.  Make
you test everything out first that you have implemented before you do the
chattr or you have to chattr -i all of them, make your changes and then back
to immutable.  The way I did it is by allowing them access to very few
binaries such as vi, ls, cat, grep and mail (you can definitely add others)
and I copied all of these files into a new directory /usr/progs and then put
that directory as the only path in their .bashrc and .bash_profile files.
 Be careful about dropping vi in their as that will allow them an escape
shell so you might have to download vim, but if you already have it then do
the same thing as with bash and copy the vim binary to rvim and then copy
that to the /usr/progs directory.  Also check the mail utility if you are
going to use it to make there is no escape shell or you will also have to
address that issue.  the less access you give them to programs, the less
likely they are to break out of a shell.  You may also want to prevent them
from accessing the chsh utility and might have to alias that to '/bin/rbash'
as well.  Then just test it out locally using your extra screen consoles
(alt - F2 - alt - F3 etc..) and log in as that user and try anything and
everything possible to break out of your shell and to also break out of your
working directory.  Eventually you will get it and then you can chattr +i
those two files.

There is one thing i thought of that can bite you in the behind and that is
the ssh keys.  when you generate the user's ssh keys (ssh-keygen -t dsa),
make sure that the keys go directly into the users home directory and not
into ~/.ssh or the user will never be able to successfully ssh to the
system.  Because remember that rbash does not allow cd into any
directory except the working directory.

Please make the following corrections to the aliases as the alias command
does not accept "/".

alias sh='rbash'
alias csh='rbash'
alias ksh='rbash'
alias tcsh='rbash'
alias unalias='rbash'
alias chsh='rbash'


etc.....

If you want to lock out shell access in mail, just drop in a .mailrc file in
their home directory with "unset shell" in it and chattr +i the file and you
should be all set.  I just did it on my system with a new user and they
cannot escape the shell or working directory.

Sort of reminds me of working for a government contractor at a
governnment facility.  The removed the rm function so we could not
delete files.  We figured out we could delete files anyway with the move
command.  cp /dev/zero to ~/zero.  cp ~/zero file-to-delete.

I don't know if the wording has changed, but Novell's policies have not. 
  I asked SUSE about this before their acquisition.  Later, after 
openSUSE was announced, I asked them if it had changed.  SUSE, including 
openSUSE, cannot be resold (whether standalone, as part of a software 
bundle, or preloaded on a system) without paying per copy.  Before the 
acquisition, SUSE required purchase of the actual boxed product for 
resale (at least for small resellers).  Now, Novell will allow resellers 
to burn their own media, but they must still pay on a per-copy basis.

Mandriva has similar requirements.  Fedora can be sold free of charge.

Tim,

Thanks for all the help.  I understand all that I have to do.  I have 
rbash setup and working.  I've set up the new bin folder and working on 
setting up the needed binaries. 

One last question.  Can I put 'cd' in the bin directory and have it not 
change directories out of the homeDir?  Or is their a way to limit a cd 
command so they can at least change directories inside a homeDir? 

Thanks for all the help.

Josh

Yes I saw this.  I have been unable to sleep and thus was thinking of 
ways to solve this.  I think I have found a way. 

Since I have restricted the path to one bin directory and also limited 
the shell access with the aliases and using rbash,  why not write a 
script that would take the first argument and check against a variable 
called chrootDir and see if the argument of the command matched the 
chrootDir Variable.  You'd have to take the argument and turn it into an 
absolute path to check but would something like this work?  Does someone 
have a suggestion on how I could do this in bash?  I suppose it could be 
a perl script or something too. 

Here is what I'm thinking:

set a variable:  chrootDir=/home/user  in the .bashrc file, which the 
user can't change.

Put a script in the rbashBin directory of  'rcd' 

The user executes:
rcd mydir

The script then takes the absolute path of the first argument which 
would be "mydir"  It would check the absolute path against the chrootDir 
variable making sure they match.  So,  since mydir is relative it would 
need to find the PWD then append that and then construct the path 
confirm that that directory is really there and then parse the first 
part of the absolute path and compare it to chrootDir.  If they match 
and there are no '..' in the argument, this prevents getting around the 
problem, Or perhaps you figure out the ..'s and .'s when making the 
absolute path, you then pass the command onto the really cd command and 
execute it for the user. 

This could be done for ls and other programs you would like to allow the 
user but not allow them to leave their home directory.  Would be nice to 
have cd and ls and other basic commands know when they are running as 
rcd or rls like rbash works but this solution seems like it would work. 

Thoughts?  Has this been tried and it is too easy to get around? 

If someone is super cleaver and wants to pump this out that would be 
cool.  If not I'll work on it after the weekend, I'll be gone this 
weekend avoiding this 100 degree weather as much as I can. 

Thanks and have a great weekend.

Subject: [PLUG] Off Topic: Moving to Portland
Message-ID: <44C23772.1030900@openboxbuilder.com>

I'm moving to Portland (from Georgia) at the end of August.  I've never 
been to Oregon and don't know much about it (beyond the results of a 
Google search), so I wondered if anyone could offer advice.

I'm about to start looking for a two-bedroom apartment.  I'll be working 
near Portland State University, so something close by would be ideal. 
Looking at the map, though, I wondered if that area floods very often. 
How much trouble does Portland have with flooding?  Should I look for 
high ground?  :-)  Is there anything else (or anywhere else) I should 
look for or avoid?

I appreciate any and all suggestions.

Edward

Edward,

   It rains quite a bit here, from September through May with other rainy days
to keep the natives from feeling restless. Get shoes with rubber soles, or a
good pair of rubber overshoes. Or, wear sandels all year; the water will
drain quickly from them.

   I never lived in downtown Portland, the closest was about 3 miles away in
the northeast section of town. Others will have to tell you about apartment
life and the city core. However, public transportation can be a good deal so
consider expanding the geographic radius of your search for living
accommodations.

   The closest we came to flooding was in February 1996 when we had a 100
year storm event. But, folks turned out to raise the height of the seawall
along the Willamette River with plywood sheets and sandbags. Starting in the
1930s, the Army Corps of Engineers followed instructions from Congress to
build flood control dams in the basin. There are now 13 such dams,
specifically to prevent the flooding that historically dampened the flood
plains, but tended to tork people living on them. However, if flooding is a
concern, get an apartment on an upper floor.

   Portland is the cleanest city in which I have lived; it's also the nicest
by any measure. The coast is 90 miles to the west; the mountains and high
desert just a bit more than that to the east. There's something for everyone
here, and it's a fine place to live and work.

I don't have any specific recommendations.  However, I'll point out
that a false sense of security is worse than no sense of security.
Encryption is easily mis-used, and by its very nature gives a sense of
security that may or may not be deserved.  If the passphrase/key for
the encrypted data is stored on the same system as the encrypted data,
and that system is compromised, then there is no value added by the
encryption.

You may want to consider an independent security assessment of the
system before going live with anything.

Welcome to Oregon!

Everything Rich said plus:

PSU is up the hill from the river. If we get another 100 year flood, and 
if the enhanced seawall doesn't stop it, and if the water got as far as 
PSU you'd probably have worse things to worry about.

Oregon is a great place to live, especially if you like outdoor 
recreation. If you want some tourist advice, feel free to contact me off 
list and I'll share as much of my ex-tour guide stuff as you are willing 
to put up with. :-)

There is a large contingent of organized bicyclists in the Portland 
area. We have official bike lanes on many of the streets, and a few 
sections of some streets that are officially intended for very limited 
car traffic in favor of bicycles.

Rich mentioned the coast to the west and the mountains and high desert 
to the east. We also have the Mt. St. Helens volcano about 50 miles to 
the north and the Columbia River Gorge, the only near sea level pass 
through the western mountains in the western hemisphere.

About the weather: Rich mentioned rain from Sep - May. In the city, that 
stays as rain throughout the winter with only a couple of exceptions. 
One or two times a winter we might get an ice storm. When that happens, 
the city shuts down for a day or two, as far as traveling the streets 
goes. Then the ice melts and we're back to rain. Winter temps tend to 
run in the low 40's and summer temps in the 80's, this weekend not 
included -- 105 yesterday, 101 predicted for today! But when it gets 
hot, it's a dry heat. The only time it gets humid here is in the winter 
time.

Didn't see Rich's reply, but let me throw this in: Portland has good mass  
transit, including an excellent train system called MAX which reaches  
close (easy walking distance) to PSU. That gives you reach out in a number  
of directions, without having to worry about downtown parking/traffic. And  
as a happy resident of the Yamhill wine country west of the city (an  
hour's reach both of downtown and of the ocean beaches), I'd suggest  
scouting around before settling on a specific spot. There are a lot of  
fine options here.

everything everyone else said...

Fishing is good. We have stocked lakes thanks to Oregon Fish and 
Wildlife and, of course, PGE.

We have with in ~50 miles:
Ocean
Dessert
Mountains
Forest
Hot springs

We even have hiking, climbing, mountain biking just off of the bus lines.

We also have some really good night clubs, or used to... (but I haven't 
been for such a long time.)

Oh yeah, it is also a technical hotbed.... even Linus is just down the 
road in ~Beaverton.

WD-40, according to the WD-40 company, is a lubricant too. However, as 
they say, external conditions may require additional applications.

Note, Portland is 50 miles inland from the coast, unlike most of the
large West Coast metropolitan. As a result Portland weather tends to be
more towards the extreme than other West Coast cities. This is minor
compared to what it is like on the East Coast though. Figure two weeks in
the 90s each year, and a week very close to 30 each year. During the rest
of Spring/Summer it will be around 70, the rest of Fall/Winter it will be
around 40. Also 1000 _hours_ of rain each year, that is merely 30 inches,
but it takes forever to come down.

This needs correction. Portland has good mass transit, if you're in
downtown. If you're at a very common destination then it is decent. If
you're going anywhere else Tri-Met (the public transit system) *sucks*,
with the only plus side being that it is pretty clean; that though isn't
the primary goal of a mass transit system. Specifically, in Beaverton or
Tigard you'll want a car unless you get very lucky and manage to be
directly on a bus route.

It is quite possible to always stay within downtown and thus avoid
Tri-Met's warts, but I'll have to rate Tri-Met pretty low due to lack of
coverage anywhere but downtown. Perhaps New York's system is pretty
dirty, but it will get you *anywhere* in New York *quickly*.

This we have discussed.  And of course if the system had been 
compromised it is pretty simple to core dumb the memory and get any keys 
from there.  One suggestion was to put the pass phrase on a CD and as 
soon as the system was up and running eject the CD.  Which of couse is 
susceptible.
   But if the system has be cracked then we have otehr more serious 
problems.

I do like the outdoors.  I probably won't have much time for a

I should be able to sneak in a little hiking.  I just emailed you, Dick.

Subject: [PLUG] Backing up with tar
Message-ID: <20060722225426.f019c678.johnxj@comcast.net>

The need for caffeine while at the mall today drove me to the Starbucks
inside of Barnes and Noble. Naturally, I needed something to peruse
while sipping, so I grabbed several books on Linux, including a couple
about Ubuntu and a couple about command line stuff. One of the command
line books was Sobel, in which I read about using tar for backups.
However, the one I took home with me was the O'Reilly Linux Pocket
Guide. Now I'm sitting here at home trying to figure out tar. My
motivation is that Kdar still crashes a lot and I need something
more reliable. But I just need something for occasional backups of my
laptop to a USB pocket drive on an as-needed basis.

I've got the command down to this (manually adding today's date to the
filename): [Wait ... I bet I could automate that, right?]

tar -pczvf /media/usbdisk/backup_7_22_2006.tar.gz /home /etc

And I actually understand what all that is doing. Not only that, it
backs up 2.4 GB of data into a 1.1 GB tarball in 4 minutes 20 seconds
over a USB port. Pretty impressive. And it does it without crashing.
Kdar may soon be history around here.

But I have a few questions that google is not supplying answers for.

1) Does this command back up files that are open? In other words, had I
better close all open programs and files before running it?

2) The first time I ran it I did it as root (sudo), and then I noticed
that the resulting archive was owned by root. This might not be very
handy in case I need to access it as jjj. Any thoughts on this? The
files are just personal stuff that I don't want to lose. We're not
talking national defense archives here.

3) I have been trying to figure out relative path vs absolute path. My
understanding is that the / in /home and /etc means that in case of a
restore, that is where the files must go. The alternative (so my
googling tells me) is to leave off the /. But when I do that the
command pukes up: 
tar: home: Cannot stat: No such file or directory
tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors 
So I'm kind of confused. I need something where I can go into the
tarball and grab just one file that I inadvertently deleted from my
hard disk, and yet I might also need to restore the whole thing in case
of a hard disk crash, stolen laptop, etc. Relative path makes more
sense, doesn't it?

4) I'm also trying to figure out how to make it incremental. My best
guess is that I'm supposed to add -u to the command:

tar -pczvfu /media/usbdisk/backup_7_22_2006.tar.gz /home /etc

But when I try that it takes just as long as an entire backup. To test
it I opened my cheat-sheet file with Gedit, changed a couple of words
and resaved it. Then I ran the same exact command, except with the -u
switch. I assumed that it would cleverly go out to the existing
tarball, find the cheat-sheet.txt file, replace it, and suture the
thing back up again all nice and tidy. Instead the hard disk whirred
for 4 minutes and 20 seconds and the fan came on as the CPU shot from
800 MHz to 2.0 GHz, just as it does when I make a full backup without
the -u switch. The only difference is that I didn't get pages scrolling
by telling me what it was doing. Something tells me that the -u switch
is not what I should be doing in order to make an incremental backup.
Shouldn't I be making a different backup tarball file, i.e., a
different filename?

5) Clearly I need to back up the entire /home folder. And I have read
that /etc should be included as well. But are there other folders that
I should include? How about the /boot folder?

That's enough questions for one day. Now I need to go learn how to
restore a file.

The land use patterns of the suburbs are hardly Trimet's fault.  When
Beaverton and Tigard achieve the population density of NY, I'm sure
Trimet's service levels will be there.  

SE, NE, as well as close-in SW and NW all have good bus and light rail
coverage and frequency.  You don't have to live downtown to make
effective use of the system.  And how many places in the country can you
get real-time arrival information from your browser or cell phone?

   According to today's newspaper, the average apartment rent in Portland is
$775. I've no idea if the 'burbs are higher or lower.

It should, to your last saved state. (i.e., you'll lose changes that

You should be fine - test a small bit of your backup. When you restore,
you should have file ownership by the original users and groups.

If you use relative path to backup, you need to be disciplined when you
restore, otherwise, you might end up with restored files
in /home/john/home/john directories.

That's one reason why rsync is more popular. You can also rsync over
ssh, which makes it easier to back up securely.

In principle, if you're not backing up an entire hard drive, you need to
back up those files which you've changed personally.

If there's a crash, you can reinstall your version of Linux, and connect
to restore any additional updates (including kernel updates
to /boot). /home and /etc in general cover this. However, if you
recompile your own kernel (or have a dual-boot), backing up /boot is a
good idea.

Use backticks to run a date command inline:

     tar -pczvf /media/usbdisk/backup_`date --iso-8601`.tar.gz /home /etc

I'm no authority on this subject, but I believe that linux does not have
all the weird "open file" issues that, say, winblows has.  In linux,
when you "open" a file (especially an executable), you are making an
in-memory copy of the file and using that.  Anyway, I have never had an
issue backing up an "open" file in linux (using tar or rsync) and
restoring it successfully.

I hope I'm wrong about what I said about open files in linux, and a real
expert will step up and provide us all with the real scoop.

If you are backing up /etc (or any file/folder owned by someone other
thatn jjj), you need to run the tar command as root, and the resulting
file will be owned by root.  If you are putting the tarball on a USB
drive, don't you have to be root to mount it anyway (unless you are
using user permissions in /etc/fstab)?

Because your tar command refers to the source and destination paths in
absolute terms, you can run the command from anywhere.  But, if you
inspect the resulting tarball, you will find that there are no absolute
paths stored in it.  This is a security feature, designed to make it
impossible for someone without access to a restricted directory (like
/etc) to be able to plant files there by untarring a tarball from, say,
their home directory.

It would be less ambiguous if you did away with absolute paths
altogether, and did something like this:

     su -
     cd /
     tar -pczvf media/usbdisk/backup_`date --iso-8601`.tar.gz home etc

You are getting the "tar: home: Cannot stat: No such file or directory"
error because you are trying to find the folder "home" from somewhere
other than /.

If you want to backup the entire machine, grab everything except /proc.
This goes for using rsync as well.

I have trouble getting --exclude to work with tar.  But I have good
success with --exclude-from .  In other words, I cannot specify which
paths to exclude in the tar command itself, but I can make a file
listing the excludes, and the tar command will read it.  Here's an
example exclude file:

root at ns:/hda1/sphinktoo# cat exclude 
./proc
./backup
./var/samba/public/avi
./var/samba/public/mp3
./tmp
./var/tmp/portage

Notice I exclude /proc, /tmp and /var/tmp/portage because nothing in
these directories needs to be restored in order to rescue a system
(/var/tmp/portage is a gentoo-specific path).  I also exclude /backup,
which is the place I am creating the tarball, so that no recursive
loops happen.  Finally, the remaining 2 directories have huge files
that are not critical, so I don't bother tarring those.

The command I use to tar my system:

     cd / ; \
     rm backup/*.bz2 ; \
     tar -jcvf backup/sphinktoo.tar.bz2 --exclude-from=backup/exclude .

In my case, /backup is an NFS share.  This is how I get the tarball
off the machine I'm backing up - no 2-step process needed.  tar works
great over any network filesystem mount.

Final note on tar vs. rsync:

tar                             rsync
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Smaller backup image            Larger backup image (0% compression)

Takes a long time               Very fast

Not incremental                 Incremental to the extreme

Restoring single files: a pain  Restoring single files: a snap

Using remote repository         Using remote repository requires
   requires network filesystem     no network filesystem mount - ssh
   mount                           support built in
--------------------------------------------------------------------

For regular backups, I use tar due to the smaller storage footprint.  If
I am about to do something dodgy to my system, I will get an rsync
backup first because it's easier to use during an actual restore.

What would an rsync equivalent to my tar command look like?  (Notice I'm
not using the NFS mount here; I'm going straight to the server with
ssh.)

rsync -e ssh -av --progress --delete --exclude=/proc --exclude=/backup --exclude=/var/samba/public/avi --exclude=/var/samba/public/mp3 --exclude=/tmp --exclude=/var/tmp/portage / root at ns:/hda1/sphinktoo/rsync

Tri-Met is a hell of a lot better than some places.  Try getting anywhere 
on a bus across the river in Vancouver, for example.  (Bonus points if it 
is after 9pm or on a weekend.)

It is not perfect, but what is?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0607231058431.9101@sphinktoo.pippiandcarlos.com>

Last October, I moved from Eugene, OR to Hailey, ID.  Having been here
for 10 months now, I feel the time is right to organize the loose bands
of linux users in the Wood River Valley.  The total population of
Ketchum, Sun Valley, Hailey, Bellevue and everything in between comes to
roughly 10,000.  I think there's just enough linux action here to get
something going.

I am ashamed to admit I have never attended a linux users' group
meeting.  I did attend a Timex Sinclair users' group meeting 20 years
ago, which was cool.  All my interaction with linux users has been in
the mailing lists.  While I am a mailman install away from being able to
host a users' group website and forum, I have no concept of how to run a
meeting with actual people in a physical building.  This won't stop me,
but I thought I'd troll for commentary before jumping in with both feet.

First of all, can anybody start a linux users' group, or is there a
higher power to which I must answer?  An Uber Tux Authority or the like?

What sorts of fun stuff goes on during a linux users' group meeting?

Is there any reason why my venture would be considered ill-advised?

Message-ID: <20060723104008.GA3445@gate.kl-ic.com>


I went to Portland Codecamp yesterday.  While there was an enormous
number of Microsofties there, and most of the talks were about C#
and .NET and other boring stuff, there were some useful talks about
Ruby and Eclipse and Subversion, and the hallway conversations were
great.  One of the attendees, Meryll Larkin, is active with the
Seattle Linuxchix, and might have something interesting to present
at a PLUG general meeting.

Stuart Celarier's presentation on the open source Subversion revision
control system was great.  Stuart maintains the Subversion server for 
local banking software company Corellian, and the server is running
on Windows, but 98% of the talk was on Subversion itself, and I 
think it would make a wonderful presentation for Advanced Topics.

BTW, I had a bunch of old Breezy Ubuntu left over from the Clinic,
and Ted Kubaska and I passed out most of them.  Viva la Revolucion!

Thanks to Mjang and Carlos for the additional thoughts.

I had  heard about rsync many times before I started with tar
yesterday. It just always seemed so confusing, and the web resources
made it even more confusing. After reading Carlos' comparison I have
decided to put efforts with tar on hold for a bit. Instead I am going
to use my handy-dandy new Linux Pocket Guide and see if I can figure
out rsync. It sounds like it might be a better solution in the end.

I have a pretty easy question to answer, but it's for a production
firewall in front of about 800 IP addresses.

If I want to do some basic accounting on an IP address basis, is the
best (quickest) way to do this by inserting an empty rule for each ip
address for which I want statistics? Then I can use "iptables -L -v "
and show all the packet counts /byte counts for each rule ?

Should I insert a rule for each class-c, and then insert the accounting
rules into those, to keep traversal time down?

and then on the other hand doing a dump-and-save procedure, which I can
come up with, I'm just looking for a "quick and painless" way to tell
someone "yeah, this ip address used 432 MB last month..." and/or make
some pretty graphs and stuff.

Considering that the "official" word on membership in PLUG is that if 
you say you are a member, you are a member, and considering that this is 
an open source endeavor, I'd be very surprised if there were such an 
authority.

Even a small group of 3 or 4 who get together once in awhile can provide

Don't let me talk you out of a good thing.  tar is a very solid backup
mechanism.  http://www.kernel.org, Gentoo Linux and Cygwin use bzips to
distribute their product.  I've switched to bzips after several years
of happily using rsync, mostly for the disk space savings.  If you have
the disk space, though, rsync has its advantages.  It's definitely worth
being familiar with both utilities.

Happy data shepherding!

I'm not. Tri-Met is very much centered on downtown. Service level doesn't
correspond very with the population density. Though downtown might have
four times the population density of further out, downtown certainly has
a lot more than four times the bus service! The irony of course is that
by the very nature of being spread out, outside downtown needs more bus
service than raw population would suggest because people *have* to go
further.

You should note that MAX isn't very efficient. They're absolutely fixed
at two car trains due to being at the level of surface streets. NY can
have trains more than 10 cars long, longer than some of the subway
stations by the nature of being underground. If you're going through
downtown, heading for the Zoo, Memorial Coliseum, Lloyd Center, or the
airport, MAX is also highly inefficient because it has zillions of
intermediate stops in downtown that aren't needed and greatly slow things
down.

For MAX to truely act as a backbone, the bus routes need to reflect that
as well. Most routes still go downtown like that was the center of the
universe, even when they're quite close to MAX.

Yeah, but I'd rather have more buses and not care about whether the next
one was 5 minutes or 10 minutes away. Close in SW isn't too good. If
you're in the hills (which is pretty close in) there are severl holes 2
miles or more across.

Yeah, transit agencies don't tend to handle talking to each other very
well. This is also Vancouver's fault though. The original plans for the
North-South line of MAX had it going across the river. The funding
was mostly lined up, and it was killed by Vancouver.

After 10 months of service (and counting) in a Microsoft/Oracle death
shop, it is refreshing to hear a fellow human being extol this brand of
policy.  Yes, there will be a place for Wood River linux enthusiasts to
meet without fear of rolling eyes and threats of linux workstation
wipage and windows re-installation at the slightest provocation by a
windows-washed manager who can't deal with a software vendor that he
can't sue.  There will be a place where many computers will congregate
in a room, and they will all be linux boxes.  There will be a place
where the young linux newbie can come to absorb knowledge from his
elders, so that he too may enter the workplace with an eye toward
redecorating his hard drive and spreading our "mad penguin disease" to
others who might otherwise have perished not knowing there was
something better out there.

Thank you for the positive feedback.  I am buying wrlug.org right now!

Does anyone know if a non-student can get a library card at PSU?  (Or at
one of the other universities in the Portland area, for that matter.)
I've lived near several universities; some allow members of the
community to purchase library cards, while others won't even allow
non-students in the door.

Thanks for all the information.

I don't think so, although anyone can use the library. The only
limitations are that the public can't check out books, rent study
rooms, or use the computer lab. However, you can access the Vikat
catalog even from your home, student or not. Just go to
http://www.pdx.edu/library/. Also, as far as I know, the staff would be
more than happy to answer questions and assist you, even if you are not
a student. I'm always asking a staff person how to find something, and
no one has ever asked me for my student ID before helping me.

Having said all that, you can enroll as a PSU student for $10. I think
you have to register for at least one course before you get library
privileges, though.

Another option would be to enroll at a different school that offers a
library card with fewer requirements (maybe one of the community
colleges). There is an inter-library deal where each school will honor
the other's library card. I can check out books from just about any
school in the northwest. 

Oh, and it's not really a library card. It's just encoded in the
magnetic strip on your student ID card. At least, that's the way it is
at PSU.

Library cards are given on an individual basis. I know that I can check 
out library books from CCC using my Oregon City Library Card. Also, 
there is an "inter-library loan" program that allows you to check out 
books from other libraries from your local library. The loans allow you 
to pick up and drop off a loaned book from your local library with out 
driving clear out to gresham or beaverton or where ever.

Well depending on what you want to check out, the Central Branch of the
Multnomah County Library is downtown, not all that far from PSU.

True, and anyone can get a Multnomah County Library card with just a
driver's license for ID. However, Multnomah County Library is not part
of the university inter-library deal. They won't honor my PSU student
ID and school libraries will not honor a Multnomah County Library card.
They're also more on the popular side; not so good if you want
advanced technical info. They live in a different world than the
university library system. Through the PSU library I can get just about
anything that has ever been printed because they will query every
university library in the known universe and obtain it for me. It may
come from deep in the third underground level of stacks at the
University of Lower Slobovistan and take a month to arrive, but if it's
out there, I can get it. Multnomah County just deals with other city,
county and state libraries. Not that I want to knock them -- they play
a vital role in society. Just not very useful past the high school
level of inquiry.

I'll definitely sign up with the county library, and I'll look into the 
other options that were mentioned as soon as I get settled.  One library 
is never enough.  :-)  Thanks.

Hey, Edward (and everybody else)!

I'm sure that I and many others would love to participate in this 
conversation if only it were over on plug-talk!

If you subscribe over there, we can talk about all kinds of awesome 
Portland things.  I'll give you the ins and outs of the cycling world AND 
the university system AND the transit system (those are all kind of my

Yay for plug-talk!

The Clackamas County library finds things at some university libraries. 
I once checked out a technical book that came from UNLV.

it's by far the fastest way - the device doesn't go into promiscuous mode and 
nothing can count as fast as x_tables/ip_tables can in Linux afaik

I honestly doubt that this is a problem yet, but there's only one way to find 
out - give it a try. I don't think 800 entries is enough to make it spend a 
lot of time in traversal yet.

iptables -L -Z is your friend, it displays all counters and then zeroes them, 
making it unnecessary to reload your configuration. Parse the output with awk 
hourly and you should be able to make nice graphs, which I've done this way.

There's been a lot of talk about the outdoor opportunities.  You should also be
aware:

Largest number of book stores and movie screens per capita.

Powell's City of books - a full city block with multiple stories of books.  A tech
book store is two blocks east with a vast selection of, surprise, technical and
scientific titles.

pretty good music scene.  See the Willamette Week site for an index into that.

Very respectable variety of ethnic food choices.

Subject: [PLUG] Bernoulli support...
Message-ID: <1153507380.44c12034158a5@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I want to support the Bernoulli Multidisk 150.  I'm trying to use it under
Redhat 6.2 because I'm on an old 486 system ( though it has one of those
pentium upgrades that it thinks is an AM DX-4 120 Plus instead of a P-133. )

I'm trying to google for Bernoulli Linux drivers, but I keep getting zip 
and jazz and occasional links to pick up the bernoulli's dos drivers.  
First off, I hate zip drives.  I installed slackware to a zip disk 
once, but it made a nasty eject noise when I tried to boot up.  I was 
using a floppy boot disk and an old parallel port model.  There was 
also something wrong with zip drives when it came to playing dos games 
off of them where the games would only work if played off of a hard 
drive instead.  Probably copy protection.  

The complaints about zip drives aside, I have a Bernoulli MultiDisk 150 
with an NCR53c400 memory mapped 8 bit ISA controller.  It seems I have
the module loaded for the scsi card, but when I lsmod I see uninitialised.
At least I am getting the driver to load without seg faulting.

Is there a way to instruct google to ignore promotions for newer products
than the one I'm trying to support under Linux?

Michael C. Robinson

This sounds good but can the user just change the path setting in the 
.bashrc file and then have access to the other files?  You just assume 
they won't know enough for that?

Actually the Mandriva License says that you can freely distribute the 
down load editions but must pay to distribute of the commercial editions 
(like the Power Pack).  To resell or modify Mandriva, there is an 
agreement that you need to sign regarding their logos and intellectual 
property and their liability (or lack there of).  You can avoid the 
agreement if you remove Mandriva's logos and name from the product.  
Mandriva also many levels of partners and various other commercial 
agreements.

August 1990, Rainbow color computer magazine.

"The Future of the CoCo," by William Barden Jr.

"There's no point in  denying it, MS-DOS systems
such as the Tandy 1000 series and  IBM PS/2 are
big business.  They consitute the bulk of computer
sales all over the world..."

He compares DOS's 640k of memory to a CoCo 3's 512k.

He says that the IBM's 640x200 CGA monitor is comparable
to 640 x 192 on a color computer CM-8 monitor.

He sets the price of the IBM at $1200 equipped and says
a comparable color computer would cost $750.

"...Multi-Pak interface for many of these...  CoCo options 
are generally a third to half the cost of a comparable 
option on an MS-DOS system..."

"...Software is another factor in computing the two types
of systems.   There's a great deal of software for MS-DOS
systems; however, the CoCo also has a large amount of 
reasonably priced software for basic applications. - data
communications, spreadsheets, wordprocessing, and the
like.  Again, CoCo software is much less expensive                             
                                           
than the MS-DOS variety - about one-third to one-half the
cost."

...

"BASIC still remains the most popular computer language.  BASIC
is bundled with most computers as part of the system software.
Fortunately for the computing community, BASIC used with all
MS-DOS systems and with the CoCo is Microsoft BASIC.  I'm not
a big fan of monopolies in computer software, but in this case
Microsoft basic has standardized BASIC programming."

"The 80x86 instruction set...  is a hodge-podge of instructions
that date back to one of the original Intel microprocessors, the
8008."

He briefly mentions that Windows 3.0 has just come out claiming
that OS/2 and OS-9 are more interesting, especially when you add
BASIC09.

All efforts to carry on after the coco 3 failed essentially.  If
you go to http://www.cloud9.net/, you may be able to support a
hobby level interest in color computers.   Overall though 16
years later, the color computer is essentially dead.  You can't
even buy floppy disks for them anymore let alone upgrade to a
modern and compatible variant.  If I'm not mistaken, the IBM PC 
has been around for about 26 years.  For 10 of those years, there
was the color computer.  Today, Intel even makes the processors
in Macs, the only surviving large volume IBM PC competitor.   
Games are increasingly becoming tied to restrictive gaming systems 
that their makers try to purposely hobble so you can't use them 
for personal computing, XBOX for example.

The Tomcat was a bust along with the MM1.  I don't know if there
were any other major attempts to clone the color computer with
a faster more powerful machine.  Why these efforts failed, I'm
not certain.

Michael C. Robinson

Message-ID: <20060724113834.ac8cf5b1.johnxj@comcast.net>

The computer is still running.

I have two installations of Dapper-64. One is plain, bare installation on hda2, which is 60 GB (hda1 is swap). The second installation is the real one, on hda3 (8 GB). I have been tweaking, testing and installing on the second one (the hda3 installation). My plan was always to wipe out the first installation, then copy all files from the second installation to it so that my real installation would be on the 60 GB partition, leaving the second installation on the 8 GB partition as a rescue installation. Today I decided it was time to do so.

Both installations automatically mount the other's partition. So here I am running the second (real) installation, I opened Nautilus to display hda2, and I see all its files and folders. So far, so good. I wanted to delete them all. Then I thought I would use rsync to copy everything from this real installation to hda2, replacing all the deleted files.

However, I ran into a problem. I couldn't delete anything. Permissions and ownerships, of course. OK, to heck with Nautilus. I opened terminal window and navigated to /media/hda2. Then I tried sudo rmdir bin (thinking I would just start with the top one and work my way down). But this gave me an error message that the folder was not empty. After reading the --help I finally accomplished it with sudo rmdir -r /bin. While doring this I had the Nautilus window open showing hda2. And the bin folder disappeared. 

So then repeated, substituting "boot" for "bin." And this gave me "command not found." What? This worked a few seconds ago. 

Yep. That command deleted the bin folder from BOTH partitions. This, in spite of the fact that I was in jjj at Devil5:/media/hda2$ when I issued the command. 

OK, time to look at backups. Oops. All my backups so far have been just /home and /etc. I have no full disk image backup.

Wait ... once at a Clinic a couple months ago I replaced the original hard drive with a new one. Then I put the old one in a USB enclosure. It should still have the /bin folder. <Scrambling around, finding drive and its cable.> OK, it's plugged in. Nautilus sees it as "54.9 GB Volume." But double-clicking on it gives me an error message "Unable to mount the volume, unable to execute pmount." OK, it's probably not listed in fstab. My other USB drive is still connected and mounted at /media/usbdisk. I'll unmount both, then plug in just the old one. Hopefully Dapper will see it as a USB drive that it can mount at /dev/usbdisk. 

Oops. "Unable to unmount." OK, never mind. I can unmount the things. Because, push come to shove, my fingers are more powerful than the computer. I waited a few moments and made sure no lights were flickering, then pulled them out. They disappeared from Nautilus. Then I plugged in just the old one. Didn't work. Shows up in Nautilus, but same error message about not being able to execute pmount. OK -- wild guess here -- pmount is a utility located in /bin. <Sigh>

OK, no problem, back to the command line. Opened the terminal window where I caused this mess. Decided to do "dmesg | tail" to see what the drive is called. When I hit enter, a message popped up "Gnome terminal has quit unexpectedly." I clicked on restart. Got the same error message. Several more times, same error message. Terminal will not run. OK -- wild guess here -- it needs something in /bin.

"Fine," I thought. "I'll just Ctrl-Alt-F1 to a command line." And that worked. Got to a command line. It was asking for my login. So I typed jjj and hit enter, expecting it to ask for my password. But nothing happened. The prompt for the password did not appear. Several more tries, same results. OK -- wild guess here -- login needs something in /bin.

OK, computer is still running, but I'm out of ideas. I still have 10 GB unused on the hard disk. I can shut down, make a fresh install of Dapper on it, then copy its /bin folder to the others. It appears that's the only way I can get /bin back. We'll see if Sylpheed can still send an e-mail. If so, I'll wait for an hour or so to see if there is a guru on the list with a better, simpler suggestion. 

This is just Monday morning. :(

John,

I'm not clear on how you deleted BOTH bin directories with that one
command.  Are you sure there isn't a bin directory on hda2?  From the
commands in your letter I would have expected the /bin on hda3 to have
been wiped out but not the one on hda2.  Perhaps you just need to
specify the full path or alter your search path to get you through this.

As has already been pointed out, /dev/hda2 *should* still have a /bin
directory.  However, that may not be critical one way or the other.
I'd suggest booting off an ubuntu64-live disk -- ideally the live cd
that corresponds to the install disk you used to install dapper.  When
that boots you should be able to 1) look at hda2 and hda3 to see which
if any have a a /bin directory. 2) copy a bin directory over to hda2
and/or hda3 from one of three locations: hda2, hda3 or the cd's
filesystem.  (when you boot up with the live cd this will show up as
"/bin", whereas the hda2 bin dir, if it exists will probably be at
"/mnt/hda2/bin" or "/media/hda2/bin" or some such place.)

To do the copy, you need to first find the mounted location of the
destination -- this is the place you need a /bin dir.  Either hda2 or
hda3.  Since I don't know exactly where these will be mounted, or even
if they will be mounted by default, you will have to poke around a
bit.   The first step is to run "mount" and see if they show up.  If
they do, you will see the mount point in the output also.  Let's
assume you want the bin dir on hda3, and hda3 is mounted at /mnt/hda3.

Go to a terminal and run:

sudo cp -a /bin /mnt/hda3

That should restore your bin dir to hda3, and you *should* be able to
reboot into your "workable" 8-gig partition. The next step is to
restore any programs in /dev/hda3's bin dir that were not on the live
cd.  I don't know how to do this :( but I'm sure some one else on here
does..

Once this is all ironed out I'd suggest using a live cd to do the copy
over to the new partition.  (may be worthwhile to format the 60 gig
drive before putting data on it, so you don't get confused about what
has been copied and what was there from the previous partition.)

You aim so low.  The computer I want usually costs $20,000.

[lots of confusing information deleted]

let me get this straight:

1) you had 2 full installations (hda2, hda3)
2) one of them is broken (hda2)
3) the system boots/runs the broken one

All you need in this case is to manually reboot into the still intact 
installation. That's as easy as booting `linux init=/bin/sh root=/dev/hda3` 
assuming hda3 is the intact installation. After that you can mount && cp all 
the stuff from the intact /bin to the broken install, and reboot back into it.

Cheers,

Auke

Great suggestion! I hadn't thought of that! Wait ... I think the Ubuntu
live/install CD (I actually burned a live/install DVD, which is what I
used for both installations) does not let you touch the filesystem. I
am told that Knoppix will, but this is 64-bit Dapper, so Knoppix won't
work. 

<More wheels turning upstairs.> But now I have another idea. I do have
Aaron's rescue CD (copied at a Clinic a couple months ago) that
definitely does boot you as root. And it has three mount points. I
could use it to mount the live/install DVD and the filesystems on hda2
and hda3. In theory, this should work. Note that I'm leery of
restarting the computer until I'm pretty sure I have a way to do it.
Without a /bin neither setup is likely to boot (no pmount) -- not even
in rescue mode.

Yeah. My *original* plan was to reformat hda2, then use Aaron's rescue
CD to copy everything from the good hda3 partition to the hda2
partition. But then I learned about rsync and decided I could do it
with rsync instead. And then I got this harebrained idea to just delete
everything from hda2 instead of reformatting it. <sigh>

Sorry. the story line is, indeed, getting involved.

Yes.

> 2) one of them is broken (hda2)

As far as I know, both are broken. That's because I deleted the /bin
folder on both. However, I did it while running the installation on
hda3. And, while some things are not working (terminal), most stuff is
still working. I have not attempted to restart because I'm pretty sure
neither will boot. As long as it's running I have a chance of repairing
it (e.g., restoring the /bin folder).

That's changed since I asked about it, then.  That's good to know.

You can do the same thing with SUSE.  You would have to come up with a

Yes, I was impressed with their partner program.  Mandrake was my first
real distro.  (I used BearOps for a week or two, but couldn't get the
modem working and switched to Mandrake.)  They've always had good support.

I haven't looked into Ubuntu's license.  Do you know if it can be freely
resold?

That's extremely unlikely, as you would have to be mounting *two* 
folders with /bin in them, at the same place.... or, alternately, you 
only ever had *one* bin folder.

But doing it live like this is more fun, and more of a challenge. :-)

Since /bin is gone, you can (or rather, must?) use tools from /usr/bin 
and /usr/sbin (and /usr/local/bin, etc. etc.) to find and get your /bin/ 
tools back. Thankfully, that's a *lot* of tools at your disposal.... and 
find (the command) can happily help you get to the "other" bin, if it 
still exists... how far have you gotten? Do you have a working terminal 
yet, or do you need to make a new user entry, with a shell that *isn't* 
a shell from /bin?

One is (was) in / and the other was at /media/hda2. I was definitely at
jjj/Devil5/media/hda2$ when I gave it the command. Anyway, here's my
most recent theory about what happened. I know I tried the rmdir
command more than once. I could swear I got error messages indicating
it didn't work before I tried it again with different syntax. But what
if I did:

jjj/devil5/media/hda2$ sudo rmdir -r bin

And thought it didn't work, so then did:

jjj/devil5/media/hda2$ sudo rmdir -r /bin.

If that would result in the current mess, then that's how it happened.
I definitely remember trying it without the /.

You definitely do not forget lessons learned like this. :(

I still have not shut down because I am sure neither installation would
boot. That is because, lacking the /bin directory, I can't mount or
unmount disks. That means that Grub wouldn't find a filesystem. Not even
if I try booting in Recovery Mode. I keep hoping I can fix it without
having to shut down and restart. If I do have to, my plan is to use a
Rescue CD that I copied from Aaron at a Clinic a couple months ago. It
boots you as root at a command line. And it has three mount points
available. At the time I got his Rescue CD I was replacing my hard
drive (which is what I originally used the Rescue CD for). I still have
the old hard drive, and it's now in a USB enclosure. So, push come to
shove, I can boot with the Rescue CD, mount the old hard drive as well
as hda2 and hda3, and copy the old /bin folder over. The problem is
that I don't know what else has gone into /bin in the past couple
months.

And I still don't have a terminal. Synaptic is running, however. I
tried reinstalling bash and gnome-terminal but, even though the
reinstall went without error messages, I still can't get a terminal
open. I can Ctrl-Alt-F1 to a command line, but when I try to log in the
prompt for the password never comes up. So it appears I am stuck
without a way to get to a command line.

Just now I tried to create a new user, but when I went into System >
Administration > Users and Groups, it wouldn't take my password. Odd
that Synaptic did.

I just looked at /usr/bin and /user/local/bin. The former has 1699
items (according to Nautilus), but the latter is empty.

Luckily I am still functional as to e-mail, browser, etc. And there is
no rush. And I do have a complete backup of /home made yesterday to an
external drive. It's just that I don't have a backup of the entire
filesystem.

Thanks for the suggestions and observations. Still poking away here
hoping to be able to fix it.

You need /bin/login installed to see that.... that package is helpfully 
called "login".
Try re-installing that.... (did Synaptic actually put /bin/bash back, or 
is /bin still missing, along with /bin/bash?)

I don't know about your *specific* install, here's a fairly stripped 
down sarge box's /bin:
--
arch   dir            gzip            mkdir       ping6      su          
zdiff

zless
cp     false          login           mt          rmdir      true        
zmore
cpio   fgconsole      ls              mt-gnu      run-parts  umount      
znew
csh    fgrep          lsmod           mv          sed        uname
dash   fuser          lsmod.modutils  nano        setpci     uncompress
date   grep           lspci           netstat     sh         vdir
dd     gunzip         mbchk           pidof       sleep      zcat
df     gzexe          mkbimage        ping        stty       zcmp
--

Many of these commands have packages of the same name. (Of course, once 
you can get a mount going, you won't need to reinsatll all of these 
though Synaptic...)

I reinstalled login, but still unable to log in at a command line. That
is, when I do Ctrl-Alt-F1 it asks for my username, I type it in and hit
Enter, and the prompt for the password never comes up.

Going into Nautilus there is still no /bin folder.

Conclusion: Synaptic just assumes the /bin folder is there. If it is
not, anything to be installed there just goes into the ether without a
whimper. Earlier I tried manually creating the folder, but in all my
GUI file managers (Nautilus, Konqueror, XFE, Thunar, Endeavour) the
option to create a new folder is grayed out.

> I don't know about your *specific* install, here's a fairly stripped

I've also discovered that OpenOffice.org won't launch. Nor will
anything I installed with CrossOver Office. Most Linux-native stuff
launches, but anything kinky (e.g., Adobe Reader 7.0), or for which I
had to use --force-architecture, fails to launch. The usual error
message is "unable to launch child process."

It looks like I will have to reinstall everything I have done in the
past two months since the new hard disk was installed. And that's
assuming I can get the /bin folder off the old hard disk back onto
hda3. Also, there was at least one kernel update since then. (I use
Upgrade Manager once a week or so.)

> Don't forget /usr/sbin too.. :-)

Is there a way to extract a new /bin folder out of these /usr folders? 

If there is not, then it appears it's time to get out Aaron's Rescue
CD, get the old hard drive mounted, and copy its /bin folder to at
least hda3. And then set about reinstalling stuff that won't launch.

I really think the live disk is the easiest way to do this.  As you've
already seen, many, many things rely on stuff in /bin.  Doing anything
is going to be chancy (I don't mean that you will do more damage, just
that many things won't work, and you  probably won't know which things
are broken until you try them all.. which will take forever.)

The Ubuntu live cd may not let you touch the filesystem by default,
but you can unmount them and re-mount them read-write so that you can.
 The other resuce disk may be easier, but you should know that it is
indeed possible to do this with an ubuntu live cd (barring any very
bizare and arcane configurations on the ubuntu disk).

The following commands should do this (run as root, or with sudo,
also, tihs is in context of an ubuntu live distro):

umount /dev/hda2
umount /dev/hda3

mkdir /mnt/hda2
mount /dev/hda2 /mnt/hda2

mkdir /mnt/hda3
mount /dev/hda3 /mnt/hda3

(the mount commands may need a -o rw, as in:
mount -o rw /dev/hda3 /mnt/hda3)

Hence the rescue disk.  First step in reparing a system: Get a
terminal (if at all possible) :)

In a later email in this thread you mention:

This should not be a time consuming or difficult task -- the database
of applications you've installed is still intact.  In the worst case,
once you have a /bin back on your system, you can do this:

dpkg --get-selections > packages

then use the packages file on a new install of Dapper 64 as:

dpkg --set-selections < packages

then:
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade

replace your /etc and /home from backups, and you're good to go.

It is possible to refresh all the packages with an apt or dpkg command
though.. (you could try doing the process I describe above, it may
very well work and it shouldn't hurt anything.)

apt-get's --reinstall option may help too.

Thanks for the detailed suggestions. I decided to make a printout,
since I use Sylpheed for mail, and once I go to the live CD I won't be
able to access the mail folder. Of course, I quickly discovered that I
can't print.

Luckily Gedit still runs. I copied and pasted your message. Tried to
print, but Gedit can't print either. Tried AbiWord too. Eventually
saved from Gedit as text. Then I crossed my fingers and checked out
network places. Luckily Ubuntu can still see the Windows shares. I
copied the text file to the Windows computer and opened there with
Notepad -- which gave me a formatting nightmare. All one continuous
stream of text without line breaks.

Twenty minutes later I finally have a readable printout in my hand.
Gawd, the *** you have to go through when you screw up. :(

It's time to bite the bullet, shut down, and see what happens. Thanks
for the help. If you don't hear from me for a while, just consider that
my education in Linux is continuing apace.

Search for dos2unix and unix2dos to help with conversions of CR and LF
differences.  The utilities are available both for *nix and Windows.

OMFG, I'm back. Whew!

Haven't assessed the damage yet.

I started by trying to boot my real installation (hda3). Sure enough,
it couldn't mount the filesystem. Shut down and tried hda2
installation. Same results. Oh well, I expected that. Time to get out
the CDs.

I started by booting to my Ubuntu live/install DVD. Then I changed my
mind and decided to use Aaron's rescue CD instead. Once it booted I
mounted the usbdisk, hda2 and hda3. Then I copied the contents ( -a )
of the usbdisk (really my old hard disk, not used for the past two
months) to /hda3/bin and to hda2/bin.

[Side comment: Some of us really, really, really need a course in how
to use the cp command. I don't mean just copying one file. I mean how
to get files from one folder into another folder without also creating
a subfolder. I have read how-tos on that until I am dizzy and I can't
ever get it right. I never get the / in the right place, or I use a /
when I shouldn't. It was easy in DOS: Go to a folder and type
"copy /folder/folder/*.* and it copied everything from that folder into
the one you were in. OK it was easy because I understood the rules. Why
is it that I cannot grasp the rules for Linux? Additional comment:
Don't reply by telling me how to do it. This is a problem that requires
hands-on practice; not reading a how-to. I need exercises.]

OK, back to the present.

Finally successfully copied /bin from the usbdisk to the two partitions
on the laptop hard disk, I shut down the Rescue CD and rebooted. Except
I forgot to unmount the hda2 and hda3 partitions first. Also forgot to
unmount and unplug the USB disk. See, once you start ***ing up, you
just keep on ***ing up. Computers know when you have ***ed up. They
purposely make it easy for you to continue ***ing up. Don't ever let a
Linux computer know you don't know what you are doing. Bad enough on a
Windows computer, but a Linux computer has no mercy.

When the Grub menu came up I decided to go for the gusto and boot
straight to hda3 (my real installation). I watched anxiously as it
proceeded, and then heaved a sigh of relief as it started to mount the
filesystem. Oh no! Not shut down clean, fsck forced. And it was hanging
trying to read the USB disk. I decided to abort. I held the power
button down until shut down. Then I pulled out the USB disk and
restarted.

This time things went much better. There was a forced fsck on both hda2
and hda3, but it went smoothly. But then I groaned as I saw the usual
messages replaced with command-line type. This always happens when the
video is borked. Sure enough, lots of video driver errors. But hey! It
booted to my normal installation at a command line! Plus, I had been
here with broken video several times before.

So I did "sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf." (see, I even remembered where
the file was and what it was called), and proceeded to deleted "Nvidia"
and replace it with "nv" in the driver line. Then I restarted.

And when it rebooted, it came right up! No Nvidia video drivers, but I
can fix that later. So here I am. Everything looks exactly as before.
Sylpheed and Firefox are working. I'll deal with the others later.

A thousand thanks to all who helped today. Now I'm off to finish fixing
stuff. And first I'm going to mount my other USB disk, the one I use
for backups, and do an rsync of this whole bloody partition.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0607250810510.5200@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I'm stumped for a solution. I remap the ctrl and caps lock keys on my
~/.bash_profile because I prefer them that way. My fiancee prefers the
default positioning. So, in her .bash_profile (and .bashrc), I removed
references to both .keymap and .Xmodmap. But, the key functions are once
again switched.

   I've no idea how this can occur without the explicit mapping of keys to
functions, and neither keymapping file is referenced in her login scripts,
so I've no idea what else to check.

Suggestions, anyone?

Or just use WordPad instead of NotePad, it knows what to do with the

The other is rebooting without a monitor hooked up.  (I had to remove it
when the monitor got soaked by a leaky drain.  Dried it out and it worked
fine.)

The whole system has been moved to a more useful location and a different
monitor attached.

Remote-migrate a server to a new VLAN / Subnet:
1. Make IP/gateway/mask changes
2. # reboot; exit
3. Effect Cisco IOS changes
4. Smile when the 'who has' succeeds

No "Ooops" on that one, to date.  But just as painful to watch. ;-)

X Server keeps a copy of your setup, internally.  You'll need to
"un-do" the key swap for it to go back to normal.  i.e. Create
.Xmodmap for each login.

Dear John, 

Congrats on making it back! I think you're now on your way from user to
hacker ;)

I'm sure others will correct me if I'm wrong, but if /bin is all you
deleted and restored, all of your data should still be there. 

Good luck with the rest,

kde borks my xorg.conf-configured keymap when I enable keyboard 
profiles.  Quite possibly something going on in your desktop 
environment.  Also, I'm thinking ~/.bash_profile is not the right place 
to configure it.

Eric,

   I've always used Xfce, not KDE or Gnone. Anyway, .xmodmap is referenced in
~/.xinitrc while .keymap (for console key map swapping) is in
~/.bash_profile. Sorry for the confusion.

Message-ID: <ff01ea180607251348y67bf2163g617bceda9750f85c@mail.gmail.com>

  A friend of mine has a Linux laptop encryption question.  His
employer has enacted a laptop encryption policy with some specific
requirements.  Has anyone heard of an encryption project that can meet
the following specs?  (The names have been removed to protect the
guilty.)

Thanks,

XXXXX is looking for a product to encrypt our Linux laptops. Windows laptops
are already encrypted. If I can find something that satisfies them, I won't
have to run Linux on a Windows-hosted virtual machine. The unusual bit is
the encryption of the boot partition, I don't expect anybody's done that
Linux-wise.

I'd love to hear about ANYthing that y'all think is remotely applicable:

1)  Must encrypt the entire disk

2)  Must authenticate the user prior to booting the OS
(preferably prior to the boot loader)

3)  Must work with (most/all of) the distros that are in
use within XXXXX (do we even have a standard?  I use Ubuntu, but I know we
also have RHEL and FCn around.).

4)  Must have separate "accounts" for administration - so
that an administrator can decrypt a machine without knowing the user's
password.

Anybody want to write a decrypting stage 1.5 for Grub?

You are assuming the only usage of ASCII files is to view them.
Notepad is only one of many Windows programs that does not know how to

As it turns out, even though the copy of /bin that I had was two months
old, almost everything worked exactly as before, including all the
programs installed last week with CrossOver Office. One thing that
didn't work was the video. I had installed the Nvidia proprietary
driver and Dapper puked on that when it booted, so I had to switch to
the nv driver. I haven't reinstalled the Nvidia driver yet. Oh, and
RealPlayer has a conflict with something. I fixed this once before, but
I can't remember how I did it. I know I got the how-to from somewhere
on an Ubuntu forum. Whatever I did to fix it must have ended up
in /bin, and more recently than two months ago, 'cause it ain't fixed
now.

Now I'm wrestling with tar and rsync. I just rsynced my entire setup to
the USB drive. However, I had to do it folder by folder because I
needed to exclude /media, and I couldn't get the --exclude= statment
right. That is a feature of rsync that is not very well documented. And
rsync hung on /sys. It just won't do it. It also gave me a bunch of
error messages about "the file has vanished" when I did /proc. I
haven't had time to research what this means. But I do now have an
almost complete image of this partition.

I also tried to tar the / directory, but had to abort it because I had
excluded /media, but it was proceeding to tar it anyway. I mean, /media
is where the USB disk is hanging. That can't work. It would be like
going back in time and killing your grandfather. So I gave up until I
have time to research the correct syntax for the --exclude statement.

Thanks again to all who helped. :)

No link, per se.  We use loop-AES and have a bunch of scripts and
procedures we use to carefully encrypt a HDD, etc.  It's taken a while
to automate, and there's still some room for improvement -- as always.

We started working with a few Wells Fargo Home Mortgage offices -- to
satisfy Requirements 1-4, and more (their Windows XP laptops are also
encrypted).  Later, we ported this to several ditros, but found Arch
Linux to be the best platform to work with, overall:
http://www.archlinux.org/

The loop-AES README is a good place to start:
http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net/  When I have some time, I'll try to
write an article or two about this.  Sorry.  Happy to help, off-line,
though.

Subject: [PLUG] CUPS postscript/config problems
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0607260743430.7324@grond.sourballs.org>

(Just to get it out of the way, I'll start by saying I loathe CUPS. 
Printing used to be simple for me back in the lpd days - now it's a 
byzantine pain in the ass.)

Scenario: 
2 machines, both running OpenSuSE 10.  One has a Canon BJC-250 attached to 
it.

Initially, the printer was hooked up to machine A, which ran KDE. 
Everything was hunky-dory.

A few days ago, we switched the printer to machine B.  We now have the 
following problems:

1. Printing from machine B (the local machine) using Firefox:

same '/rangecheck' error when sending output from Lyx, or when sending 
postscript files via lpr.

HOWEVER... viewing the same postscript files directly, using 'gs', works 
fine. As far as I can tell, it's the same ghostscript in both cases.

(printing the CUPS test page works fine.)


2. Printing from machine A (remote):
printing works fine, except that all jobs start halfway down the page.
The only straw I can grasp at is the change in the filter chain on the 
remote machine's cupsd server. It used to do this:

I [31/Dec/2005:20:24:43 -0600] Started filter /usr/lib/cups/filter/pstops (PID 5643) for job 2.
I [31/Dec/2005:20:24:43 -0600] Started filter /usr/lib/cups/filter/foomatic-rip (PID 5644) for job 2.
I [31/Dec/2005:20:24:43 -0600] Started backend /usr/lib/cups/backend/parallel (PID 5645) for job 2.

now it does this:
I [25/Jul/2006:18:49:58 -0500] Started filter /usr/lib/cups/filter/pstops (PID 11606) for job 134.
I [25/Jul/2006:18:49:58 -0500] Started filter /usr/lib/cups/filter/pstoraster (PID 11607) for job 134. 
I [25/Jul/2006:18:49:58 -0500] Started filter /usr/lib/cups/filter/rastertoprinter (PID 11608) for job 1

I'm guessing the change in filters has something to do with the change in 
output. But I have no idea how to test that.


So, in summary, 2 problems: 1. postscript printing from localhost is 
broken, and 2. printing anything from remote is mis-aligned (but 
postscript is apparently fine).  I figure that, eventually, by slogging 
through CUPS' documentation, I'll figure out problem #2.  But #1 I'm not 
sure what to do about.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0607260825320.20594@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I have a small file (a logotype) using a specific typeface that I can
create with OO.o or GIMP. Using OO.o I can save it as a .pdf file and the
edges are sharp and smooth. If I run it through pdf2ps, the resulting
PostScript file is of obviously lesser quality. Could this be due to the
specs used by the two tools?

   When I create it in the GIMP I can save it directly as an .eps file, but
again the quality is not as high as it could be. I don't know why.

   This file is a logo that I want to use in the LaTeX templates for
SQL-Ledger. Those files are compiled with latex, not pdflatex, so I cannot
use a .pdf file in them.

   Have any of you graphics-oriented folks any thoughts about getting a
high-quality .eps file I can use?

Thanks,

Rich,

What does the image look like when you print it? Does it look as crude 
as it is on the screen or is it a better quality?

<quote from http://www.prepressure.com/formats/eps/fileformat.htm >

EPS files can optionally contain a bitmapped image preview, so that 
systems that can't render PostScript directly can at least display a 
crude representation of what the graphic will look like.

There are 4 preview formats:

    * PICT, mainly used in files generated on Macs. The PICT file is
      stored in the resource fork of the EPS file, while the actual
      PostScript data are stored in the data fork. PICT is the default
      file format of QuickDraw, the graphics model that is used by all
      Mac applications to generate the screen display.
    * TIFF: Most EPS files created by Windows applications contain a
      TIFF file for preview purposes.
    * Metafile: Some EPS files originating on PC contain a Windows
      Metafile preview. WMF or Windows Metafile is the PC equivalent of
      the Macintosh PICT file format.
    * EPSI which is an EPS file with a platform device independent
      preview. EPSI is an all ASCII (no binary data or headers) version
      of EPS. EPSI provides for a hexadecimal encoded preview
      representation of the image that will be displayed or printed.
      EPSI files were documented by Adobe as a means of providing a
      preview for EPS files which would be cross-platform. In reality
      though DOS machines and Windows favour embedding TIFF or even
      Windows Metafiles in the PostScript. EPSI is mainly used on Unix
      systems.

After several hours away from my machine, i.e. it's running but idling, 
there is a delay of up to two or three seconds between clicking on a 
running program's button at the bottom of the screen and the display of 
that program's window. After a couple of minutes, response time returns 
to normal. This effect grows gradually over a period of weeks (maybe 
months?) to the point that it becomes annoying. I'm used to some delays 
getting a program started, but once running they usually run fine.

Any ideas what causes this?

Hardware: Pentium II, 400 MHz, 192Mb RAM
Software: SuSE 9.1 (2.6 kernel), KDE 3.2
Applications running minimized:
   Thunderbird (checking for e-mail every 10 minutes - not downloading)
   Firefox
   Patience (card game)

I didn't say that it would handle all aspects of a *nix ASCII file
correctly, just the line breaks.  I will have to admit though that if I
have to do something with a *nix file in Winblows, it is usually just to
view it.

Is the delay from the applications being paged back in from swap?  Is
your hard drive grinding away while the delay occurs?  Perhaps a
background cron job (does SuSE ship with slocate/updatedb enabled?) is
hogging your memory causing your idle apps to be paged out?

Yikes! I've seen firefox/thunderbird alone eat 192M of RAM.

It's just swapping everything back in.. this is normal. Running KDE on a
PII is not very recommended :)

If you had more RAM and CPU, I'd suggest tuning the swappiness kernel
parameter, but I think you're just in need of more hardware. Even with a
light-weight window manager, I think you'll still experience this, but
probably not as bad.

Apparently. (See reply from Charlie).

Not that I've noticed, but the machine is under the desk and the fan is 
loud enough that I don't hear the hard drives.

I've never looked before (he says somewhat sheepishly). I see from the 
following that updatedb is enabled, but on a daily basis. I also see 
that there is at least one useless feature, a battery check, so I'll 
investigate further and see what each of these things does.

If you fan is loud...
it could have a bearing missing
it could cause your cpu to overheat
it could cause your system to be VERY sluggish
it could greatly reduce cpu life span

but on a PII.... where are you going to get another fan? Keep everything 
that is important backed up.

Oh, yeah.... if it is your power supply fan, it can screw up the proper 
volt/amp.... which will also cause your cpu to act sluggish.... I may 
have a power supply and / or a fan for your PII.

   Since this is a family-oriented mail list, I'll limit my description to
"poor."

   But, ... I found the ideal solution! It's a tool called 'bmeps' (which I
deduced stands for 'bit-mapped to EPS', 'cause that's what it does. It will
convert a bit-mapped .png, .jpg, or similar file to .eps. And it does an
outstanding job of it. Took about 6 sec to configure, 1 sec to make, and a
short time to cp the executable to /usr/local/bin. Works like a charm.

                See: <http://bmeps.sourceforge.net/index.html>

   The resulting .eps was happily accepted by latex and dvips. I specified
the grey-scale option during the converstion, along with PostScript level 2,
and I really like the results.

Charlie,

   Not necessarily. My fiancee's ThinkPad 600E has a PII/400MHz cpu and 128M
RAM. We run only Xfce, and she's happily using both firefox and
thunderchicken -- at the same time; I've heard no squawks about that.

   I agree that using KDE will slow down everything; so will Gnome. On an old
workstation (with 32M RAM), I tried running Knoppix, but it refused to load
KDE (too little memory). I figured out the switch to use at invocation to
have Knoppix use xfce instead, and it worked happily away. Of course, since
we'd been using xfce we never noticed the memory limitations.

More hardware is on my list of things to get, but is somewhat low on the 
list. Until then, I'll remain patient.

Thanks for confirming what I suspected, that it was just what my machine 
does.

It's not that loud. It's just loud enough, when combined with the noise 
from the other computer next to it under the desk, that I don't hear the 
disk drive.

Good advice, anyway. Thanks.

Thanks for the offer, but I don't think that's the problem. The power 
supply is fairly new (3-4 months?), and is quieter than the old one.

A memory is returning: some years ago, when I had spare time, but just 
as it was about to disappear, I added memory to achieve 192 Mb. 
Somewhere around that time is also when I installed SuSE 9.1 on this 
machine. I expected the install process to totally reformat and 
partition the drive, but for some reason (either I said yes when I 
should have said no, or visa versa) the old partitions were kept. Later, 
I consolidated some of them and then added the second swap partition. 
IIRC, the first one is unused, but don't quote me on that. I believe the 
recommendation was to create a swap partition that is double the 
installed RAM, but don't quote me on that, either. Here's what fdisk has 
to say:

    Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hda1   *           1          12       96358+  83  Linux

I had the same problem with Suse 9.1, (older kernel). Swap usage kept 
increasing, and the only thing I could do was reboot. I got up to 10.0 
before switching completely over to another distro.

Seconded. 

I have a faster/newer machine, which runs dirvish/rsync backups at
full throttle every night, which soaks up most of the available RAM
(and network, and disk IO), swapping out most of the desktop apps. 
I am running ancient Fedora 1 with a 2.4 kernel on it.

I wonder:  Is there is some way to tell it to swap all the desktop
apps back in, after the heavy lifting is done?  Then the machine
would be ready to rock in the morning...

Yes.  I've mentioned this before:

  # swapoff -a
  # swapon -a

The first will page all the swapped out data back into RAM, the second
will re-enable swap.

And, in Keith's case it ought to be fairly easy to add the operation
to the end of his backup script.

Wait till XFCE 4.4 comes out. It's still lighter than KDE, but I think 
you can prune Gnome to the point where it's competitive with XFCE 4.4. 
Stick with XFCE 4.2 if you want a light "real desktop".

Of course, *I* switched to WindowMaker/GNUStep. :)

Hello,

Does anyone know if a squashfs image can be expanded to a directory 
by a command line utility? tar and gunzip didn't get me anywhere.

Thanks!

Michael.

I found the answer should anyone need this...

There is a utility called unsquashfs in the squashfs-tools directory.

Cheers!

Nice, but it costs more than twice what  I paid for the machine.  If I had
corporate backing maybe, but not this year...

This has some fun possibilities.  I can think of a couple added pranks to
add to this.  Shift every picture so it gets a copy of the picture before
it. (It would pretty much scramble any page.)  Replacing random images with
other random images.  Filtering the text through a language filter.  The
list goes on...

   I get a pinegpg-signed messages from the Slackware security team, but the
contents are missing. The error message is that when /usr/bin/gpg runs it
cannot find libiconv.so.2. I have the latest gnupg installed: 1.4.4. And,
this is a fairly recent development.

   That is a reasonable statement, because I cannot find it either. Worse
yet, when I look with Google, all I find are old messages about the same
library missing on Solaris, AIX, and numerous Red Hat and Samba references.
Nothing that tells me in what overall package this library comes, nor where
I can find the silly thing.

   If you can identify a source of this library, I'd greatly appreciate it.

   Wow! This is strange (cue the theme from The Twilight Zone). I
re-installed gnupg-1.4.4, but this time from the official Slackware package,
not the one put up on linuxpackages.net. After sending the original message
to the group here, I was returned to my inbox, and there was the fully
decrypted message in all its glory!

   So, now I know to either grab from osuosl.org or build it here. No more
linuxpackages.net downloads for me!

Whew!

Subject: [PLUG] Debian doesn't detect my DVD-Burner on my new Laptop
Message-ID: <200607272142.11155.bobby_miesen@yahoo.com>

Hi all.

	I recently had the misfortune of having to replace my old laptop because the costs of repairing it were too great to warrent it and purchased a new Toshiba A105-S4074. Everything works well with one exception---debian doesn't detect my DVD-Burner. I tried using 'discover' 'lshw', 'report_hw' and none of them even detect my DVD-Burner. 
	I'm not sure why this is, since I test-ran Knoppix v4 on the floor model before I purchased the new laptop and it ran fine, reading from the DVD-Burner with no problems. I also was able to run moodle off my DVD-Burner. However, when I tried to run disk 1 of the Debian v3.1 "etch" DVD set, it could start up the installer, but the installer could not detect my DVD-Burner. The same holds true for my installed copy of Debian. 

	Can anyone shed some light onto what might be causing this annoying situation and how I might fix it? The DVD-Burner in question is what Toshiba calls a "DL DVD SuperMulti" and I am running linux v2.6.16-2-686-smp. Thanks in advance.

Which begins: "My neighbours are stealing my wireless internet
access. I could encrypt it or alternately I could have fun."

Or, alternatively, you could decide to announce that it is
intentionally available for sharing.  See the Personal Telco Project,
for example:

  <http://www.personaltelco.net/>

With all the recent hoo-haw over the Unwire Portland (MetroFi)
project, it bares realizing that we could easily have vastly better
wireless network access than MetroFi can ever provide *this afternoon*
if people simply decided to affirmatively, intentionally share their
existing internet access.  Individually-deployed wireless is so dense
in Portland *today* that it's not even funny.  How powerful and
generally useful could it be if we all decided to share it?

You should be worried about this even if you're using your home
connection.  Such critical data needs to be encrypted, since you can't
make any assumptions about the route your packets will take.

Not just wireless.  *Any* public network/computer/terminal should be 
considered unsafe.

That's why you set up ssh tunnels for everything on your laptop.....

The real solution is to revert back to direct cable connection for home
networks and toss the wireless stuff.

As for SSH tunnels, I beg to disagree and contend that there should not even
be an SSH tunnel, the less services running on your home system, the less
opportunity for people trying to find a way in.

DefCon does this with the "Wall of Sheep".

Encryption is your friend.  (As is ssh tunneling.)

Does anyone have the current VPN client tarball for Linux?

I need to get a copy and/or an MD5 checksum of the file.

Thanks.

   Almost every day my sshd log shows folks -- primarily from Asia -- trying
to get in as 'root,' 'test,' and similar names. Of course, they're not
allowed in, but it's interesting to see the constant attempts.

Yeah. I use "denyhosts" to block those.  I got tired of the repeated 
attempts from the same servers over and over and over again.

If you configure ssh correctly, there should not be any security issues. 
Use public key, disable ssh v1, and remove cleartext passwords.

How does this prevent some one on the other end of the connection from
sniffing your password?  How do you know there are no malicious
monitors between your isp and your destination?  Wired networks aren't
really that much more secure than wireless.

Is an ssh tunnel really a service?  Isn't the standard practice to
make them local-only, and close the tunnel whenever you aren't
personally using it?  I fail to see how this is less secure than not
using encryption.

   And configure sshd to allow only certain named users in.

If you have a cable modem, the line is shared (and sniffable) by everyone 
on your block.

If you are routing through to your home machine and back out you are.  But 
if you set it up right, it is not insecure.

Right you are, it is interesting and sometimes upsetting to see the things
people are trying to do all day long.  Are they getting paid to do this crap
all day or still living at home with the parental units?

They are scripts.

Subject: [PLUG] Can't see files with Konqueror
Message-ID: <44CA97A1.4070402@comcast.net>

On my SuSE 9.1 system, I have an icon labeled "My Computer" that opens a 
Konqueror window with the Location "drives:/" containing icons for "CD 
Recorder", "CD-Rom", and "Floppy". Along the left side are small icons, 
one of which displays the tree of my home directory.

Today, when I click on the Home icon, the frame is created, but the tree 
list never opens. At that point the Konqueror window freezes. Closing it 
brings up this "Warning" message:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Window with title "drives:/ - Konqueror" is not responding. This window 
belongs to application konqueror (PID=11778, hostname=localhost).
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clicking on the appropriate button closes the window. If I start it 
again, I can close it normally, as long as I haven't tried to access my 
home directory.

I have another icon on the desktop labeled "Network Browsing" that opens 
a Konqueror window with two icons, one labeled "All SLP Services" and 
the other labeled "Windows Network". There is no problem with this, 
today; I can display the files on my Winders machines.

I assume something is corrupted somewhere, but had other plans for the 
afternoon, so I thought I'd try using smbclient to access a one of my 
other machines and move a file from the SuSE machine to there. Having 
never used this tool before, I tried looking up the man page with 
Konqueror by putting "man: smbclient" into the location box. When I do, 
I get the following error message:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
KDE Man Viewer Error

No man page matching to smbclient found. You can extend the search path 
by setting the environment variable MANPATH before starting KDE.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any idea what I have to fix to correct these problems?

I've been running Breezy Ubuntu just fine for a while and just downloaded

This is a clean install not an upgrade and a brand new virtual partition.

I can provide lots more details but if anyone has experienced this problem

The shutdown process hung when it tried to unmount the /home directory, 
saying something about it being busy. I'm sure there's a more correct 
thing to do next, but since I don't know what it is, I did a hardware 
reset. Now things are back to normal and I can get at my home directory 
from Konqueror.

I did try one other thing before rebooting: Another of the icons on the 
Konqueror window displays the root directory. This worked. I was able to 
expand /home to show my directory, but when I clicked on it, Konqueror 
froze, just like before.

When you say you "just downloaded Dapper" what do you mean? Do you mean
you downloaded the live/install CD or DVD, burned the ISO to a CD or
DVD and are installing from that?

Thanks for responding, John.

I downloaded PC(Intel X86) server install CD from ubuntu.com. I got a file
called ubuntu-6.06-server-i386.iso, which I burned to a CD.

I then made a virtual machine at www.easyvmx.com just as I did for Breezy,
choosing "Ubuntu Linux" -- there was no version indicator there.

Then I put the CD I made into my drive clicked on the virtual machine and
the install started. It got to the point where it said to remove the CD,
which I did. Then I clicked on Continue to boot without the CD. It then
hangs at ...booting the kernel.

I also downloaded and burned a Live CD (the file
ubunto-6.06-desktop-i386.iso) which works. However, I see the same problem
when I try to install from the Live CD. I then killed VMWare and booted the
virtual machine (the one from the Live CD which was not comletely
installed). Ubuntu did come up then. However, this version from the Live CD
does not have my max screen resolution. If I look at Preferences ... Screen
Resolution my resolution (which I can get with Breezy) does not appear in
the dropdown list. With this version (which I dont want to keep because of
the resolution issue) I did update with those initial 132 updates).

That's why all my traffic, except web browseing, is encrypted when using
wireless, even if it's not a honeypot, somebody with a sniffer could
capture all your traffic.  WEP is just to make bosses happy, not for
real security.

And I'd also recomend PTP style shareing, unless you have comcast, then
you propbably should turn your AP off when you ar not using it. :P

ssh does not send passwords in the clear, ALL ssh traffic is encrypted
using public key exchange.

Dear Ted, 

I had a similar problem with the Dapper RC on one of my systems when I
tried to install from the Live CD. However, it worked fine from the
other CD ("alternate install CD").

In other words, there are two ways to install Dapper. If one doesn't
work, try the other.

Thanks,
Mike

Thanks, Mike. I did finally get this installed, but I am very disappointed
in Ubuntu right now. I finally did get the screen resolution I wanted by
editing xorg.conf, but I don't feel I should have had to do this.

I was unable to install the alternate way -- I ended up using the Live CD,
chose install, let the install crash and then brought up the crashed
incomplete version which did surprisingly come up and configured it to be
what appears to be complete -- we'll see. 

I do have a virtual machine now that I can checkpoint.

I honestly believe it should have come up much easier than this. Breezy did.

I'm not personally, but I'm almost certain that model is supported by HPLIP, which integrates with CUPS. From the web administration interface when you add the printer, if you select HP and the model you need isn't listed, I recommend installing HPLIP (HP Linux Imaging and Printing) through whatever system your distro provides for packages.

Thanks for the suggestion. Already have HPLIP installed. And several
more related packages. And all the PPD files. And CUPS. 

I can print to it just fine. The problem is being unable to access a
key feature of the printer that I need. The feature is printing
multiple copies collated without concatenating individual print jobs to
a massive spool file ("RIP once, print many"). I've spent hours and
hours googling and experimenting. No luck so far. I can print to it
with this feature just fine from my Windows 2000 desktop, which is
using the same PPD file.

I am hoping to find someone who has accomplished this.

Ah, I've used the feature you speak of. I'm almost certain this feature is implemented by the driver itself in Windows, not anything printer-specific. However, I've not seen such a feature using HPLIP before. The Canon BJC-4400 Gutenprint driver has a setting for this, available in the CUPS web interface. If your driver had such a setting, that's where you'd find it.

I'm not an expert on printing, but it may be possible to print to a postscript file and use some nifty commandline tools to seperate each page into it's own file, then queue each individual file the same number of times.

I've seen lots of folks on the list reference the postscript tool suite, perhaps one of them knows how this would be possible, if it is.

Send a check for $500 to AOL and label it "coercion fund deposit." That's what all the SPAMmers do. As for yahoo/hotmail, I can't help you. Hotmail has been bouncing most of the messages my server sends for probably a year now. I've just told all my users that correspondence with hotmail-hosted accounts is impossible, since no one has ever had a solution for me. Ahh, the rules Microsoft breaks...

To respond to my own posting, I was able to solve this problem.  It turns 
out that the version of ghostscript (8.15.0) that OpenSuSE 10.0 installs 
can't handle certain postscript constructs (the developers considered them 
'nonstandard').  The answer was to upgrade to gs 8.15.2, and that seems to 
have solved that problem.

The second problem was a config error; the lesson learned, basically, was 
"don't filter output on the client machine and then filter it again on the 
print server machine".

Thanks. Already went there several days ago. And back again. And again.
And to multiple other web sites, wikis, forums, and how-tos. So far I
haven't found an answer to my problem.

The problem is that there are probably a dozen different configurations
that will print to this printer, and each has several dozen options.
(It's a very popular printer in workgroup settings, which is what it
was designed for.) I need to find someone who is actually using this
printer to find out which configuration/option will make the printer do
what I need it to do. I can do it from my Windows desktop, so there
must be a way to poke it with Linux to make it do the same thing.

It is not a problem of not being able to print to the printer. I can
print to it. I just can't get a particular feature working.

Are you sending mail directly? If so can you relay it through your
ISP? 

I had this problem before, but not after relaying my mail
through my ISP. I can now send mail to anyone, and it won't be 
blocked... that I know of.

Hmmm, Gutenprint. I've heard of it, but haven't checked it out. Thanks
for the idea. I'll google and find out more about it.

In the meantime I discovered that the problem is not in the driver, not
in CUPS, not in the printer, and not in Linux. It's in the application.
How do I know this? Because I have now accomplished it, just not with
the app I was trying to use.

I had been trying to print 100 copies collated of a 276 page book in
PDF format. I started trying to use Adobe Reader 7.08. I chose Adobe
Reader because Adobe Reader 7.0 on my Windows desktop does this without
a problem. But Reader 7.08 on Linux does not. It just continuously
concatenates print jobs to one mammoth spool file. You can imagine how
big the spool file would be. Plus, printing is slow, you don't get job
offset in the output stacker, etc. 

When I discovered that it didn't work, I tried the command line. First
I tried printing the PDF file directly. The command I used was "lp -d
Laserjet-8000 -n 2." (I started with two copies just to see if it would
work.) It printed one copy and stopped. I switched to "lpr -P
Laserjet-8000 -# 2." Got the same results. Then I tried putting the -n
in different places, but still no luck. Finally I installed two more
printers in CUPS, and repeated the commandline experiment. Still no
luck.

That was the next thing I tried. I used Adobe Reader 7.08 to print to a
PostScript file, then used the lp and lpr commands to print it. Still
no joy. Worse, Adobe Reader hosed a graphic on the first page by
deciding it was underneath the text when it was really on top. I didn't
bother to figure out why -- it didn't work anyway.

And then I decided to install other PDF viewers. I already had Evince,
but its print dialog is pathetic. Searching in Synaptic I found Kpdf,
and that was the secret. It happily prints multiple copies collated
just like Adobe Reader 7.0 does on my Windows desktop. That is, except
that the first copy out is unbearably slow. But at least it works. More
important, it proves where the problem lies. At least now I can quit
fiddling with CUPS, drivers, PPD files, and the command line.

Another thing to google on. 

Thanks for the suggestions.

The HPLJ 8000 is a Postscript printer, and that is probably the interface
that CUPS is using.   The postscript file itself, generated by the
application and merely transmitted by CUPS, is what tells the printer
to print multiple copies of a page, with a "/#copies 2 def" (replace 2
with desired count) in the file.  I suspect that Postscript will only
interpret that as printing multiple copies of each page at each
"showpage" command in the Postscript, without collation.

When you think about it, the printer would need a hell of a lot of
memory to store all the page images for a book, so all most printers
can do is concatenate multiple copies of the source Postscript in a
"massive spool file".   However, it looks like the HP8000 can have
an optional hard-disk, and could spool the whole images out
repetitively.  I don't know whether that hard disk is accessable
under Postscript, but the 8000 PPD file has some magic words like
"Mopy" and "HPOption_Disk" that may result in suitable Postscript.  
Google on them, and also ask questions on the linuxprinting.org
HP discussion forum, after searching for past answers of course.
Most of us do not have such printers.

If the printer is fast and the pages are simple, repeated spooling
of a whole-document image isn't too bad;  that is what happens when
you click the "collate" box for most Linux or Windows applications
with less capable printers.  However, you will need to have enough
room in /var/spool/cups or /var/spool/lpd to hold the monster.  If
you built /var in too small a partition, you can use symlinks to 
put the partition in a larger space.

Another option is to dump all the postscript from the application
into an appropriately named Postscript file, then build a shell
script with a loop around the lpr command to print out that file
repeatedly.  If I was in the print-on-demand book business, that
is what I would do, all driven from a web page order form that
selects the file and produces cover pages with UPS info ("hmm, the
printer is going, time to bind a cover and stuff an envelope and
summon UPS").  Sometimes, the Windows-style "everything through
the GUI" approach is far too time consuming...

Yes, directly.  But that's an incredibly simple fix to the problem.  I 
will give that a try in the morning.

Message-ID: <44CC5DE4.8070202@dimstar.net>

Before I reinvent the wheel, does anyone know of a DVD/CD/other media 
catalog software that will integrate with a web server?

I'm thinking along the lines of php with mysql backend, but that's not 
required. I'm also thinking of just something for my network, as my web 
server is inward looking only.

I'm sure I could write something myself, but why reinvent the wheel if I 
don't have to? :)

I use php4flicks. It has some annoyances like requiring to choose a

Subject: [PLUG] Converting Cassettes to computer files
Message-ID: <20060730074654.ec34748a.jmpurser@gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm finally actually UNPACKING for the first time in about 6 years.
In the process I've discovered an unbelievable number of cassette tapes
I'd like to convert to computer files.  I've done this one song at a
time and have discovered that I just don't have the attention span to
do this successfully.  Has anyone on this list played one full side of
a tape into a computer, then used a program to break out the individual
songs?

Any tips, hints, and tutorials would be appreciated.

Thanks,

John Purser

I had to implement such a solution a long time ago in order to send 
e-mail to my parents. Using sendmail on Comcast, the config bits were 
pretty easy. In sendmail.mc,

   define(`SMART_HOST',`smtp:smtp.comcast.net')

Contrary to my expectations, Comcast has a fairly robust and well 
maintained SSL infrastructure on its SMTP servers. To help ensure I 
get a verified *and* encrypted outbound connection, I've twiddled 
/etc/mail/access just a bit:

   TLS_Srv:smtp.comcast.net        VERIFY:128

I get rewarded with mail log entries that confirm the connection:

   Jul 29 16:23:11 irvine sm-mta[17049]: STARTTLS=client,
   relay=smtp.comcast.net.,version=TLSv1/SSLv3, verify=OK,
   cipher=AES256-SHA, bits=256/256

256-bit AES? Not bad! At the very least, it keeps messages safe from 
the prying eyes of snoopy neighbors. :-)

Unless these are some obscure hard to find artists, I would just get the 
files online.  It will probably be quicker and you're going to get 
better quality copies with album info.  And since you already own them 
it would be legal.

I have used gramofile for recording cassette tapes, as well as LP's.

http://freshmeat.net/projects/gramofile/

While not perfect, gramofile does a reasonable job of locating the 
breaks between tracks. For conversion to MP3, I've used BladeEnc.

http://freshmeat.net/projects/gramofile/

Both are command line programs. Gramofile has a curses user interface, 
and BladeEnc allows wild cards to permit conversion of multiple files 
with a single invocation.

Gramofile also has decent scratch and pop filtering. I just use the 
default filter and have been happy with it. I've never tried mixing and 
matching from the other possibilities that also come with gramofile.

Like most mp3 encoders, BladeEnc will let you choose the bit rate you 
want. I understand a lot of folks are happy with 128. It really depends 
on the kind of music you are listening to, and how fussy your ears are. 
I use 256 for classical music. I can tell the difference between 256 and 
192. I can't tell the difference between 256 and 3xx (whatever the 
number is that's supposed to be as good as a CD).

I'v been using lame with -vbr (variable bit rate). While I've been
generally satisfied, sometimes the fidelity of the resulting piece is
not as good as the original CD. Usually that happens when the CD wasn't
too great in the first place. I've never tried BladeEnc. Do you
consider it better? 

I guess one of the reasons I've never used it is because it's not
listed in Synaptic (just checked).

I never tried lame. The machine I use for audio is in the basement and I 
connect to it either with ssh from my Linux machine or with putty from 
one of my Winders machines. In either case, I'm not using an X 
environment and so I'm not using GUI tools.

One possible reason could be the patent issue BladeEnc ran into several 
years ago. High up on Google for Linux's list on BladeEnc is the following:

Slashdot | Bladeenc Under Patent Attack
Bladeenc Under Patent Attack -- article related to Patents.
slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/06/01/1826246&mode=thread

The page dates back to 2000, but I would guess that the issue never went 
away. The source code remains available, but binaries were taken down. 
So, if Snyaptic only pulls in binaries, there wouldn't be any available.

I did the equivalent of this in qmail.  My server at home uses the Plesk 
control panel (I host a few sites for some clients) and qmail is what it 
uses.  Thanks guys for the advice.  This was a great solution.

Lame is not a GUI application, although I think several GUI front ends
for it exist. I use it from the command line. I found the GUI tools
confusing, hard to use, and buggy.

How is your partition table laid out?  Is '/home' on a second hard disk 
from the '/' directory?  If so, your second hard disk could've stopped 
responding for some unknown reason (check your logs) or it could be an 
impending hardware failure.  Look into SMART tools to see if the disk 
has any problems (ex. "smartctl -a /dev/hdb").

Although you could see the directory structure of your home directory, 
there is a good chance that information was cached in memory and didn't 
need to access the hard disk.  Konqueror, on the other hand, would 
probably need to load up cached file preview images and such that might 
not have already been cached in memory.  It's interesting that, provided 
enough memory, a hard disk can crash and people won't even realize it 
for minutes or even hours; so long as everything was previously accessed 
and cached in memory.  This could explain why your email client worked 
to post your problems.

Cheers,

Daniel Hedlund

David,

I would be happy to talk about this subject at a future PLUG meeting as 
I've done quite a bit of work in this area.  At some point in the future 
I might also like to give a talk on virtual file systems; I could 
probably merge the two since loopback encrypted filesystems would also 
be of interest to the crowd.

Cheers,

This is very odd behavior since Knoppix is Debian-based.  Are you sure 
that Knoppix actually detected the drive and not just did like the 
Debian installer?

I did a little bit of searching around on the Internet and it appears 
that there are quite a few problems related to serial-ATA (SATA) based 
CD-ROM drives.  Apparently you might try turning off ACPI support in the 
kernel (kernel arg "acpi=off").  Some places also seem to say that some 
chipsets require certain drivers to be detected properly.  Mostly 
though, these tips don't seem to help anyone.  Your kernel seems new 
enough.  I'll provide a few links to other people having similar 
problems that you can refer to for updates, but it might be worth taking 
this problem to the Linux kernel mailing list (especially look at first 
link below):

Just to make sure before you go to the kernel list...you don't have a 
"/dev/hdc" (or equiv.) listed, correct?  If you do, double check ripping 
an ISO or something first ("dd if=/dev/hdc of=test.iso).

Also, double-check the kernel bootup messages to see if your CD-writer 
is mentioned anywhere in there; it might present an error or warning 
message about it.

I hadn't heard of SMART tools. I'll download and install it later and 
give it a try.

Could this be dangerous to run on a system with only 192 MB memory?  
What would happen if he is actually using more memory than he has 
physically available?  Would swapoff just bork with an error instead of 
killing the system or apps?

Again, I would hate to see what happens after waking up one morning to 
find a corrupt Inbox.  I think the following URLs have a much more 
appropriate solution, which is to tweak the swappiness settings of the 
kernel.  For example, "/var/sys/vm/swappiness" on my computer is 
currently set to "60".  If I change the value to a low number such as 10 
(or even 0, "echo 10 > /var/sys/vm/swappiness") just before running 
updatedb, the kernel will be very unlikely to swap out any memory unless 
it really really has to.  Once updatedb is done, you can set the 
swappiness back to its previous value:
http://lwn.net/Articles/83588/
http://kerneltrap.org/node/3000

However, I think the easiest solution would be to either disable 
updatedb in the nightly cron job and make run it once a week.

There is also apparently a patch being proposed (not sure if it's been 
implemented in the main trunk yet), which would automatically reload 
certain applications back into memory after they've been paged out to 
swap (http://members.optusnet.com.au/ckolivas/kernel/index.html).

How many people here know how to enable WEP, IPSEC, etc?  I don't.  I use 
hostap, when it comes to WEP I've never been able to get a working 
connection.

Makes me wonder if IPSec is a better approach than trying to figure out
WEP, but I've never done that either, even for wired networks.

When it comes to secure networking, anyone get confused with Kerberos,
OpenLDAP, IPsec, etc. being wrapped into many of the standard Linux
packages?  How many people understand PAM?  I don't get PAM.  I'd
say most people don't know how to use ANY of the security options
available in Linux while the sheer number of encryption/security/authentication
methods tied onto even the smallest package set Linux will install with is
daunting to say the least.  I'd say Linux is too obscure when it comes to
encryption, especially wireless encryption.

Rogan is right, the service is ssh where tunneling is merely a particular
application of that service.

The obscurity of packages being built for various and asundry
encryption/authentication methods needs to be closely visited
in my opinion and cleaned up.  I don't see why Linux systems
even need PAM.  Packges should be set up for 0 
authentication/encryption methods by default and you should be 
able to install one method with the package dependencies set
up for that.  Should I really have to force krb5-libs off 
because sendmail insists that it depends on it even if it isn't
being used?

You may also need to try a different kernel. I was using 2.4.X and then 
as soon as 2.6 came out I installed the kernel and lost my wireless 
connection. Then after a few revisions of 2.6 my network card worked 
again. Try a different kernel and see if this works. Try a newer and an 
older version.
I missed the original email, so I am going off the cuff...


Turning off acpi may work or it may not. I have had good luck with it on 
HP laptops, as for Toshiba laptops, they have been a real pain. Are 
there any toshiba utils? I thought that there were some, but it has been 
so long since I have done anything with Toshiba and Linux.

In terms of supporting WEP or WPA I've never found Linux as easy to configure 
as WinXP. But with a little bit of effort I've been able to use both WEP and 
WPA-PSK with Linux. WEP is easy as I've used a program like "kwifimanager" 
for setting up WEP for several networks. It's also possible to set the WEP 
key on WIFI from the command line using "iwconfig" and I've done it with a 
simple shell script that scanned the available WIFI networks and when it 
detected a network ID is recognized it set the WEP key accordingly. 

WEP is so easy to crack though that I generally avoid using it for any WIFI 
network that I manage. When I did have to use WEP I went through extreme 
measures and put the WIFI side of the network on its own subnet and used an 
OpenBSD firewall with "authpf" support. To get to the internal side of the 
network users had to login to the firewall via SSH which caused "authpf" to 
dynamically update the firewall rules to allow packages from the given WIFI 
client to traverse from the WIFI subnet to the internal network. When the SSH 
session was closed the firewall rules were updated to remove the WIFI 
client's ability to access the internal network.

For WPA secured WIFI networks though I felt like I had to jump through a few 
hoops since an extra daemon process is required to  support WPA using a 
program called "wpa_supplicant". Unless one's Linux disto supplied a working 
version of the "wpa_supplicant" it has to be build with support for whatever 
WIFI chipset is being used. I wasn't able to get the WIFI drivers included 
with SuSE 9.2 to work with with the "wpa_supplicant" daemon so I had to 
resort getting a newer version of the ipw2200 and ieee80211XXX drivers from 
sourceforge and building them myself. 

With the updated Intel drivers I was able to get WPA-PSK support working but 
anytime I installed an updated kernel from SuSE  I'd have to rebuild my WIFI 
drivers and install my updates over the SuSE supplied kernel modules to get 
WPA support working again which made me dread installing kernel updates 
because of the extra work involved..

I was so happy when I upgraded to SuSE 10.0 though as they included support 
for WPA into YaST2 so it was just a simple matter of setting my passphrase 
and allowing YaST2 to automatically install the "wpa_supplicant" package. I 
had held off upgrading for months for fear of breaking my WIFI support since 
I wasn't sure if SuSE 10.0 would fix or break my WPA-PSK support.

Sorry for the long post but IMHO I think more work needs to be done for WIFI 
support for both WEP and WPA in Linux. Support is there and one just needs to 
figure out what to use depending on what encryption method a given WIFI 
network needs. But I wish it was as easy to configure WIFI support as it is 
under WinXP. 

Tony.

I've used 'mp3splt' with reasonable success in the past. It basically
listens for quiet spots and splits the file accordingly. Sometimes it
goofs, but if you don't mind fiddling a bit, you can "tune" it to
better suit the sort of audio you're working with. Note that it only
works with pre-existing MP3/Ogg files, so you'd have to do the capture
and initial encoding some other way.

  Mp3Splt is a command line utility to split MP3 (VBR supported) and
  Ogg Vorbis files into smaller files without decoding. Useful for
  splitting albums, either manually, using freedb.org data, or .cue
  files and for splitting based on length or on periods of silence in
  the file.

I believe your comments are more about perspective, are we looking at this
in terms of from my home computer to the demarc or are we looking at it from
the ISP to the destination.  If we are talking about from the ISP to the
destination then that is something we have absolutely no control over and
wired or wireless would not really even matter.  I was referring to "from my
home computer to what could be either a wireless access point or in the case
of a wired network, a hardware based firewall".  Considering that, then
wired would probably be more secure than wireless.  True, providing someone
with the know-how and the equipment to eavesdrop on electromagnetic
interference was parked out front of my home then my wired network would not
be any more secure than a wireless one.  The chances of someone having all
the required equipment to capture electromagnetic interference are a lot
less likely than someone with stumbler, kismet, airsnort or some other
wireless cracking tool.

So now I am going to have to go out and buy fiber optic for my home
network!!  Donations anyone?

though, the record volume usually comes across pretty high so the

and sometimes distortion will be fairly high in comparison to your

few others
but don't waste your money on them as they are very worthless and do almost
nothing to improve the quality of the recording.  I believe you need to pick
up the LAME encoder to use the line sampling in feature.

Anyone out there that has found a linux based one please let everyone know
as I will be very excited to try it out.

I think you missed a critical portion of my reply.. If you have
complete controll over the entire path that your packets take, then
wired is more secure.  eg: your laptop to your hub, to your server,
assuming your server is connected to your hub, with arbitrary chaining
in between, but *ONLY* if you have complete controll over who has
access to all the intermediate networks, and you trust all those
connections.

The moment you leave a network that you controll, then all bets are off.

There is no way to know if the connection from your isp prevents
another one of their users from running a packet sniffer, which is
trivial to use, and requires no "specialized" equipment at all.  While
it's unlikely, it's also possible that there is a wireless link
somewhere between your connection to your ISP and the destination
you're communicating with -- you have no way to prove this one way or
the other, so you should assume the worst.

The point I was trying to make is that, like servers, networks are
insecure as long as some one has access to them.  Comparing wired
networks to wireless networks in the context of the entire internet is
like comparing a boat with one large hole in the bottom to a boat with
two large holes in the bottom -- the boat is sinking either way, so
you've got to take the same precautions in both cases.

Won't solve the problem (of applications laggily swapping back in).
Rsync on big jobs chews up lots of RAM (has to maintain a lookup of

The ability to do something like that on a per-process basis could
solve the problem.  Something like: swapin $(pidof mozilla)

Depending on the situation/machine, though, my swapoff/swapon trick
will work too.  Thanks for pointing out the caution though.  I am not
sure what happens if swapoff can't swap everything back in.

That's a really good idea!  Why can't a process's memory be swapped back 
in or accessed on a per-process basis with a command like you 
suggested?  Examples being:
$> proctouch $pid
$> proctouch (with a syntax similar to killall)

This could be done as a script using existing files in the /proc 
directories as each process has it's own listing of memory, maps, etc.  
It should even be possible to "touch"(cat to /dev/null) all a process's 
shared library dependencies by accessing the process's "maps" file and 
getting the memory addresses of such.

This could also be done as a C application and possibly use built-in 
library functions in the kernel or another standard library (not sure 
which one would have everything needed).

I think I have become obsessed and will try to see if I can implement 
part of this tonight.  :)  I will start with script-based attempts 
though and might look into a C-api if I get time in the coming days.

Cheers,

Awesome, this sounds like a great idea. I think it'd be really neat to eventually have a kernel patch and/or daemon that allows swapping in of processes by owning user ID, nice level, or other parameters whenever system RAM becomes available.

Hello!

I have a Acer Aspire 1800 running Kubuntu. Worked great until a few days ago. It now powers on for about 5 seconds and then shuts down. SO I guess it is not even getting to the OS.

I have taken the battery out of it and placed it back in thinking this would reset the BIOS. This did not help.
I took the battery out completely and tried to start it up. No go.

It does not stay on long enough to read a cd, I do not have a 3 1/2 in floppy.

Does anyone have a suggestion?

Thanks ahead of time.

Dale,

   It looks like it may be a power supply problem. The brick may not be
recharging the battery or running the unit even when it's plugged in the
wall outlet.

   I had this problem on the ol' ThinkPad. The fine folks at Northwest
Computer Support (in southwest Beaverton) fixed me up with a new A/C power
supply after confirming that was the problem.

   They've done all the repairs and stuff on my portables. Despite the
distance, I find them worth the trip.

Rich

In addition to what Rich suggests, I've had two separate instances where 
the power connector to the mainboard on the laptop has come loose or 
unsoldered.  The power brick may still be okay.  You can test this by 
using an ammeter on the end of the cable...or for those people who are 
poor or stupid enough like myself, you could always try sticking your 
tongue on the end of the cord; this might at least rule out the brick.

If the brick is okay, depending on how skilled you are, you could try 
taking your laptop apart.  Don't do this if it's still under warranty.  
With most laptops, it's quite difficult to get down to the mainboard 
where the power connector is to have a look or take the board out to 
resolder it.

What if you have an identically-sized swapfile $file (not in fstab)

  swapon $file && swapoff -a && swapon -a && swapoff $file

Would that page everything into ram on the way to the swapfile and then 
(typically) happily notice that it fits with overflow going to the file 
only if needed?

Could be a spare swap partition, but the file would be a bit more 
flexible (it's only a safety net, so swapfile performance suckage 
doesn't matter much here.)
