Don't:
1. Try to hide your car.
2. Try to "clean" your car by hosing down the interior. With a hose.
3. Remove passenger seat from said car, so you "can sleep there",  
especially if you have a house and a bed.
4. Tell a jury you'd rather sleep in an undrained inch of water in  
your car than your bed, ....in a car parked a mile from your house.
5. Tell a jury that a 6-inch blood stain on a bag was caused by sex.
6. Leave bloodstains from the wife in the house, during a messy divorce.
7. Take a road trip through the desert, for no appreciable reason,  
after your wife disappears.
8. Show up to pick up your kids on the wrong day, after she  
disappears, but before there's any reason to think she wouldn't appear.

My take is that he thought he was smarter than any one cop, lawyer,  
or prosecutor he would face, and forgot about the intelligence of  
crowds.

I will miss his code contributions... but he seems guilty as heck to me.

Not saying Hans Reiser is an example of this, as I haven't personally 
followed this case closely enough to know. However, before making a 
blanket statement that circumstantial evidence shouldn't be used as the 
basis for conviction I would do specific research on other cases where 
no physical evidence can be found, and the difficulty law enforcement 
has in even investigating, much less prosecuting them. Marilee Strong 
has written a book on cases that seem similar to Reiser's:

And some people are guilty of posting to the wrong lists.  I will
continue this on plug-talk.

It appears that Adobe is finally releasing the flash spec.  Perhaps we 
can now have a robust open source player, and I will no longer have to 
impersonate Don Quixote by refusing to install flash.

So is this the end of the ReiserFS, or are there any other developers
who are willing to carry on that part of the codebase, perhaps with a
name change?

Last time I tried OpenSUSE, the default FS was changed to ext3.

Thanks,
Mike

Reiserfs was pretty much abandoned years ago. Apparently, Novell has a
couple developers still doing maintenance because of SLES, but the code
is difficult to understand and no one wants to work on it.

Reiser4 is a different filesystem, the reason reiserfs was abandoned. It
was started in 2002 and ever since then Reiser has been unable to
convince Linus and friends to merge it. Because of the trial, Reiser's
company Namesys went out of business. Some of the Namesys developers
said they plan on continuing to work on reiser4 and perhaps even
creating a new company around it. Since the trial started, they have
made further effort to get reiser4 merged and some think it might make
it into the next kernel version. Only time will tell if reiser4 has a
future or if it doomed to become a dead end like reiserfs.

                             Short Topic Discussion

     For the first time in a long time, we do not have a scheduled
     speaker this month - unless someone volunteers at the last minute.

     Instead, we plan to have a series of short discussions and "show
     and tell" topics by anyone wanting to speak for 5 or 10 minutes.
     It should also be a good chance to ask questions and get people
     opinions about some topic.

         Agenda:

             7:00 - 7:30  Business
                  We will discuss the status of our ongoing projects
                  including PLUG's monthly Advanced Topics meetings,
                  PLUG's monthly hands on clinics, PLUG for Education,
                  etc.

             7:30 - 8:30  Presentation

               Chamber of Commerce in Corvallis.
               As of May 2008, the Mid Willamette Valley Linux Users
               Group was under reconstruction.  Once this is done

consulting and training division called O'Reilly InPractice. Here's an
interview with the new Chief Strategy Officer George LeBrun that's
worth a quick read.

 And as usual around here, we've got lots of new books, conferences,
and other projects going on. One of the latest is a new book widget
that lets you share O'Reilly and our partners' books on your web site.
You can choose by author, topic, or just show all our new releases
automatically and it's completely customizable for your web site so
you can choose the size, design, and more.

 I'm willing to trade you a book of your choice for posting one of
these cool new widgets. Send me a link and let us know how you like
them.

 Many thanks to our beta testers including Stephen Henry from NCMUG,
Michael Ross from SDOUG, Jen Blackledge from COWPU, and Satish Talim
from the RubyLearning User Group.

 New books we're hoping to get Amazon and Slashdot reviewers for
include "Web 2.0: A Strategy Guide," "The Principles of Project
Management," "Subject To Change," and "bash Cookbook." Send me an
email if your interested and I'll get the book right out.

 Travel Alert: Are you going to Tech?Ed or JavaOne? Please let me
know! I'll be attending both shows and want to say hi.

 We're also getting ready for OSCON in Portland, OR. If you have any
UG activities or ideas we should know about or attend--pass them
along. This will be our 10th Year of OSCON.

 And here's a funny video every cat person should watch--"An
Engineer's Guide to Cats"

I can talk about some data collection I did this week measuring
"static" magnetic fields on the University of Washington campus (I
just got back last night).  It relates to a Sound Transit light rail
project and possible spurious magnetic field signals affecting
sensitive instrumentation in use at the University.  I built an
"improvised measurement device" similar to my "purple box of doom"
wifi stumbler that we could deploy outdoors for several hours at a
time and run off battery and that we could also control and monitor
remotely over wifi.

I can also show the software I wrote to query the instrumentation and
timestamp the response.

We will count on you to talk about

                     Measuring "static" magnetic fields
                                     on the

No.  Same trip, different job.  I am reducing my carbon footprint by
means of trip aggregation.

Here's to hoping I can get a laptop talking nicely to the projector.

I may have the program around here somewhere. I'll look.
The program was rather simple. Written in C or C++, it
used one function call to detect alternate streams within
a while loop that hit every file on the system; so, it
was slow. The anti-virus vendors I spoke to at the time
cited this performance issue as a reason why they did not
support ADS until it appeared in the wild.

The router is a WRT54G and only allows hex. I have a DD-WRT modded WRT 
at work I will look at and see if it has these options. If so I will 
flash mine with DD-WRT as well. From my reading, hex is the most 
compatible, so this is strange to me. 7.04 was the best release for my 
laptop. 7.10 and 8.04 have been a lot of work.

Hi Bill,

> Would you be aware of any modern day equivalents.

I don't know exactly what kind of interface you're looking for, but The
SleuthKit (TSK) should be able to easily obtain ADSs from NTFS.  The
only tricky part is interpreting the output.  NTFS considers all file
properties "attributes".  This includes file data.  A given object in
the filesystem may have multiple data attributes (all of those beyond
the first one are considered "alternate").  The NTFS data structures
even support assigning data attributes to directories, and directory
indexes to files.  (That's right, we're talking about file/dir gender
bending here.)

So as you can imagine, trying to build a single tool that can represent
all of this complexity while still supporting more traditional
filesystems would have been a pain.  Here's an example of TSK's output
using fls and istat (some output ommitted):

> fls /dev/sda1
r/r 7417-128-1: AUTOEXEC.BAT
r/r 4-128-4:    $AttrDef
r/r 8-128-2:    $BadClus

d/d * 28-144-6(realloc):        WINDOWS
...


In the above output, the three numbers separated by '-' are important to
understand.  The first number of the three is kind of like a Unix
filesystem's inode number, in that it uniquely identifies the file.  The
second two numbers, I don't remember what they're for off hand, but they
can be used to uniquely identify a specific property of a file.

If you wanted more details about AUTOEXEC.BAT, you could use istat with
the MFT (inode) number:

> istat /dev/sda1 7417
MFT Entry Header Values:
Entry: 7417        Sequence: 1
$LogFile Sequence Number: 50333850
Allocated File
Links: 1

$STANDARD_INFORMATION Attribute Values:

$FILE_NAME Attribute Values:

File Modified:     Sat Nov  3 14:54:25 2007
MFT Modified:      Sat Nov  3 14:54:25 2007
Accessed:          Sat Nov  3 14:54:25 2007

Attributes: 
Type: $STANDARD_INFORMATION (16-0)   Name: N/A   Resident   size: 72
Type: $FILE_NAME (48-2)   Name: N/A   Resident   size: 90
Type: $DATA (128-1)   Name: $Data   Resident   size: 0
...


Notice the $DATA attribute?  It's name is "$Data".  This is the default
data attribute for the file.  To get that attribute's contents, you can
append the second two numbers (128-1) to the MFT/inode number and run:

   icat /dev/sda1 7417-128-1


I don't have any ADSs right now, but I suspect if I did, they would be
numbered ...-128-2, ...-128-3, etc.

TSK has a lot of other tools to play with and is pretty easy to script
with.  I imagine you could write something to scour a filesystem quickly
for them.

good luck,
tim

Granted it is Fedora specific but they may be able to help you.

I've been to the annual FISL conference (7000 attendees) in Porto Alegre
(Brazil) for the past four years.  Linux (and all FLOSS) is *huge* in Brazil.
If you have specific requests, I might be able to forward them.

Message-ID: <20080505184953.0d8f509a.johnxj@comcast.net>

Hardy upgrade was supposed to fix the random disconnects I had with the
Intel 4965agn wireless in my Lenovo T61. Instead the 4965agn no longer
works at all. :( 

However, the borrowed Netgear WG511T PCMCIA card still works reliably.

I know a number of people on the Lenovo Thinkpad (ltp) e-list for whom
the 4965agn works fine, both on 32- and 64-bit Linux, various distros.
I also know there are a lot on the e-list and on the Ubuntu forums who
have a range of issues with the 4965agn.

I intend to post on the ltp e-list and/or Ubuntu forums regarding the
specifics of my problem, but before I do I need to check out everything
that wireless on Linux does. That is, I suspect it is a configuration
on my computer that is causing the problem. 

I need information about all utilities, GUI and otherwise. For example,
Network Manager used to show available networks about one time out of
20 tries. Wifi-Radar used to show all available networks every time.
>From the command line "sudo iwlist wlan0 scan" used to show all
available networks about three times out of four. Kwifimanager used to
show all available networks about one time out of four. (Right now,
none of them show any available networks ever, except the command line,
and it works only half the time.) And even when one of these displayed
all available networks I could usually not get an IP address.

l also need information about all configuration files and what they do,
how the syntax works, etc.

I'll never be able to get this thing working until I understand what
all the myriad pieces of wireless networking do, nor will I be able to
post a coherent query on an e-list or forum. I have searched for
tutorials, but (as usual) I can't find any comprehensive
tell-the-whole-story-from-the-beginning sites. Can anyone suggest a
Linux wireless-for-dummies site?

I am writing this on my desktop because I have messed up the network on my laptop, which is my main computer. I messed it up by installing wicd in an attempt to fix the wireless after upgrading from Gutsy to Hardy x86_64. However, I cannot reinstall network-manager because now I have no network at all on the laptop. The only way I will be able to reinstall network manager is via the CD. I have all the Hardy CDs, but nothing I can do will get Synaptic to see the CD.

In Synaptic I go to Settings > Repositories and then on the Third-Party Software tab. Then I click on the Add CD-ROM button, which pops up a box that says Please Insert a Disk into the Drive. I insert the Ubuntu Hardy desktop x86_64 CD in the drive and click on OK. A popup says "Scanning disc for index files, then "The disk is called <can't read the rest because it disappears too fast>." And then it says "unmounting CD-ROM." That's all it says, and afterwards Synaptic still does not see the CD-ROM. I am using Ubuntu Hardy x86_64 and I have tried other CDs as well, e.g., the Alternate Install CD. No way can I get Synaptic to see the CD drive.

If I can't get Synaptic to see the CD drive, how can I ever repair Network Manager?

I'm desperate here. I hope someone can help.

Since the GUI thing doesn't work, I wonder if there is a command line way to install network-manager from the CD.

I guess it would be "sudo apt-get install <network-manager-whatever-it's-called>" but after cd to the CD-ROM drive

Taking a step back, can you just fix your network via the command line
(i.e. ifconfig and/or /etc/network/interfaces) and then install things
over the network again?  Wireless might be tricky if you're not used to
wpa_supplicant, but a wired connection shouldn't be hard to set up
temporarily for this.

dhclient eth0

  or

ifconfig eth0 <YOUR_IP> netmask 255.255.255.0
route add default gw <ROUTER_IP>
# finally edit your /etc/resolv.conf to set your DNS server

  or

# use your favorite editor to fix /etc/network/interfaces and
ifup eth0

  or what have you.

HTH,
tim

No, none of the above will do anything. Until Network Manager is
reinstalled there is no network connection. It's as if the ethernet
cable is not plugged in. Any repairs that require going to the internet
will fail. What I need is a solution for installing Network Manager
(package name "network-manager") without an ethernet cable connected.
That means from a CD.

Hmm.  Well I admit I'm not an Ubuntu expert... I use Debian, but last
time I messed with Ubuntu, the network manager junk was limited and
painful to use, so I just disabled all interfaces in it and worked from
the command line and config files.  I'm pretty sure the command-line
utilities I just mentioned do not depend on the network-manager package
and nor do the kernel modules.  These are standard regardless of
distribution.

If you've actually tried this, then do correct me.

thanks,
tim

I can assure you that the ethernet port is not working. For example, I
have a Laserjet with a net connection set to 192.168.0.15. If I turn it
on and ping it, I get "Network is unreachable." This is connected just
over my home ethernet network. I printed a document to it from my
laptop this morning, so I know it is working correctly. And I can print
to it right now from the desktop computer.

Whatever software is required for the ethernet on the laptop to
function is not working. I assumed that was network-manager. But I may
be mistaken. Whatever it is, I need to know what it is and how to
install it from a CD. Or if I had the .deb file I could put it on my
thumb drive and install it with gdebi or with apt-get. If it's not
network-manager that I need, then I need to know what app I need to
install.

Sorery for my attitude. It's getting late, I'm tired and frustrated.

That just means that the interface isn't configured.  Check to see if
the interface is there:

  sudo ifconfig -a

do you see eth0?  If so, make sure you've got an ethernet cable to
your local network, and type:

  sudo dhclient eth0

If you've got a DHCP server on your network (you probably do), then
that should get you fixed up wired-network-wise.

If the ethernet interface is *not* present, then the module might have
been unloaded for some reason.  Try reloading it.

Network manager is just a gui interface.

John,

Since you're using Ubuntu, you can go in and ensure the only source you
use for adding software is the CD-ROM.

Using bash:
$ sudo su -
# cd /etc/apt
# vi sources.list

(Comment out every line EXCEPT the first one:)
deb cdrom:(xxxxx)

On my system - Kubuntu Gutsy Gibbon, the first line actually reads:

deb cdrom:[Kubuntu 7.10 _Gutsy Gibbon_ - Release amd64 (20071016.1)]/
gutsy main restricted

Make sure you make a note of which lines you comment out as you'll want
to uncomment them later.

On my system I use:
#TJB
to comment each line.  That way I can readily identify lines I comment out vs those that should be commented out.

Good luck.

Tim

If the network card is there then follow the directions from others 
about configuring it.  If it's not there then try these steps...

$ lspci     # look for the ethernet controller
$ modprobe -l -t kernel/drivers/net   # look for a driver that matches 
your network card
$ sudo modprobe module   # where module is the network driver you found 
in step 2.

For the module name above, just use the name of the module, not the 
entire path, i.e. e1000 rather than kernel/drivers/net/e1000.ko.

Tim already gave me that information but I was too tired last night to
see what he was talking about. This morning I did "sudo ifconfig -a"
and sure enough, the network was there. And "sudo dhclient eth0" got me
a connection. I'm back in business. I'm curious how I managed to kill
it, but that is not an important question. Thanks to all for your
patience.

I know some people have the 4965agn working fine, yet there are many others who have issues with it. Under Gutsy it always worked, but sometimes I had to poke it repeatedly, and it would give me random disconnects, especially if I wasn't sitting right under an access point. The LED also never came on. I had heard that the real solution was to use a newer kernel, specifically the one that comes with Hardy. Accordingly, I just decided to continue using a borrowed Netgear card until Hardy went final. So last Thursday evening I upgraded to Hardy, which went well, but the LED was still not on, although I did connect at PSU the next day. When I connected it knew what network to connect to (pubnet.pdx.edu) because there was a line in /etc/network/interfaces to use that ESSID. Wifi-Radar and the Network Manager GUI did not show any available networks, nor did the command line.

When I got home Friday and restarted the LED was on (how did that happen?), but the GUIs and command line still did not show any available wireless networks, even though there are several from my neghbors that are visible if I use the Netgear card. I didn't do anything further with it until Monday when I was back at PSU. And this time I could not connect at all. For some reason it would no longer connect to pubnet.pdx.edu. I tried everything I knew how to do, and after half an hour just put the Netgear card in so I could get a connection.

When I got home last night I decided to install Wicd, which automatically uninstalled Network Manager and Wifi-Radar. (A lot of people on the LTP e-list say they much prefer it over network-manager.) It was afterwards that I discovered that I had no wired connection either. Thankfully, that is now fixed (what made eth0 go away?), but I still need to figure out what is wrong with the wireless.

I see the 4965agn with lspci, and it appears in the GUI, but the GUI says it is not configured, and "sudo iwlist wlan0 scan" says "No scan results." Here is some output:

The default seems to be en_US.UTF8 but mkisofs doesn't like that.
It does like en_US.cp437.  How do I change the default?  The locale
command only shows me the current settings.

Last night I briefly spotted the large words "Tech Show" on an ad
on the rear of a rapidly departing TriMet bus.  It was dark and I
did not see anything else.  A quick google revealed nothing besides
the April 24-25 Tech Show at Benson High;  is there anything else
going on in the near future that might explain that ad?

Were you at PSU when you restarted the networking? You won't get a DHCP
lease unless the AP is showing pubnet, you'd have to change it to whatever
available essid, if any you were near.

But don't do that. You don't want en_US.cp437 as your system language. 
Ungood things will result...

Read carefully the "CHARACTER SETS" section of the mkisofs(8) man page 
and adjust the -input-charset and -output-charset options as necessary 
-- or use "-input-charset help" to see what's built in. I'd suggest 
using iso8859-1 (or -15 for EU support) rather than cp437.

Also, and pardon the stupid question -- but I'm stumped why you'd 
still be running CentOS 4.3. That release is over two years old (Mar 
2006). Release 4.6 is the most current: Nov 2007. I guess it's not an 
issue if the machine isn't networked, but still...

I saw this on Jesse Keating's blog (which he apparently lifted from a 
Planet Fedora discussion), a one-liner for discovering your favorite 
shell commands:

   history |\
   awk '{ a[$2]++ } END{ for( i in a ) { print a[i] " " i } }' |\
   sort -rn |\
   head

It won't take into account commands that are not the first token in 
any given line -- maybe they've been invoked by a wrapper like sudo or 
they sit on the other end of a pipe -- but it's still sort of 
interesting, in a navel-gazing sort of way.

It also only looks at the history of your current terminal (and I rarely 
have fewer than 20 of those.)  So, it might be more entertaining and/or 
informative to take a snapshot of currently running programs throughout 
the day if you really want to gaze all the way to the center of the 
navel.

So malloc calls a timeout and starts rummaging around the free chain,
sorting things out, and merging adjacent small free blocks into larger
blocks. This takes 3 1/2 days.

Bummer.  I've got a Lenovo T61 running Ubuntu 7.10 and 8.04 (among

Does this mean your Hardy is 32-bit? Mine says:

I have extra stuff in the configuration:
duplex=full firmware=0.3-0 ip=192.168.0.102 ... and at the end speed=1GB/s.

My configuration here says:
configuration: broadcast=yes driver=iwl4965 latency=0 module=iwl4965 multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11g

The difference is that you have an IP address where I do not. But that is because I am at home where I do not use wireless.  If I was at PSU and was actually connected I would probably have a "131.x.x.x" in there. And my ethernet here shows an IP address where yours does not because that is how I am connected at the moment.

All the same except the following lines are different for me:

	Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 504
	Memory at df2fe000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=8K]
	
> How does that compare to yours?

It appears that my wireless uses a different IRQ, has a different memory address, and yours doesn't know what the device is where mine is convinced it is a T51, even though it is really a T61. Sometimes computers get the silliest notions into their little silicon heads.

I doubt the IRQ and memory address are significant because mine is seen. An error in either of those should result in the device not even working, right?

I'm not sure any of the differences are significant.

   Communication and note-taking device while traveling.

   I'm in the same situation deciding what to do with the Libretto's
replacement: a Toshiba Portege 3025. That has a 200MHz Pentium MMX, 96M RAM,
and a larger keyboard/screen. Weighs only 1kg and is about 2cm high when
closed.

Hmm well with that kind of spec, best thing would be a real featherweight
type distro, such as DSL. (http://damnsmalllinux.org/)

If you or someone you know is into Ham Radio, something like that would be a
perfect machine for contact logging, especially during Field Day.
http://www.arrl.org/contests/announcements/fd/
Basically Field Day is like a 24 hour camp out, contest, and emergency
preparedness exercise all in one.
Those that use laptops during FD for logging tend to use older ones they
wouldn't mind getting a little dirty or roughed up during a camp-out type
situation.

You could also use this old beast for serial console work (just a real basic
text only Linux install, with Minicom, to log into another machine by serial
port).

Just learn the command line tools, LVM2 isn't difficult to figure out.  
Start with pvcreate, then vgcreate, then lvcreate.

EVMS on the other hand is an overlay on top of LVM2 and supremely 
complicates it.

I have a slightly older Libretto -- 32 MB of RAM and a 133 MHz Pentium, 
but I think it's a 70 and not a 50. I managed to load DOS 5.0 from 
floppies on to the first 25 MB of the hard drive, then somehow got 
enough of Debian Woody on the hard drive to do an install. It wouldn't 
boot the Debian install floppies back then, but it might now. But it did 
come up and run Woody (early 2.4 or late 2.2 kernel, IIRC) and KDE 2 
something. Debian Potato was a slam dunk, and as someone else pointed 
out, you ought to be able to run Damn Small on it.

I'd still be using it if the battery was good, but it's sitting idle.

I have a Libretto 110 (Pentium 266) that would actually still be
perfectly serviceable if it weren't for the execrable hard drive
performance (no DMA for you!) and limited RAM (64 MB, max). It runs
Debian unstable just fine, although I haven't upgraded in a year or
so.

It was once pretty handy as a classroom PC, too (taking notes, reading
e-mail during boring lectures, etc.). Sadly, Firefox was all but
unusable on the Libretto. Opera was slightly better.  I've never
bothered with any fancy GUI desktop stuff. The ion window manager fits
the small display perfectly, and it's fast. For its final mission, I
stuck a 40 GB hard drive in it and use it in the garage as a poor
man's iPod.

Sounds like whatever you installed played with the
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 file.  I usually back those up
when playing with net network apps or drivers.

Must have done more than play with it. The whole /etc/sysconfig/ folder

Ah, now I see. Actually I was kind of guessing it was
the /etc/network/interfaces file. I am already familiar with it. But on
my Ubuntu machines there is not much in it.

Yes indeed, K6LNX :)  I've been into Ham Radio about as long as I've been
into Linux, since RedHat 5 days.
I am hoping to go to a Field Day this year, either with the Oregon Tualatin
Valley ARC, or Portland ARC. (OTVARC meetings are closer for me)
Are you a member of either of those?
I have yet to get to either of their meetings (or PLUG for that matter).

Back on topic ;)

I have a clunky old Dell Latitude CPi D300XT, which has a PII 300 I think,
64MB RAM, and right now the HDD is failing (battery is dead too).
...Anyone have an old 10-20GB laptop HDD for sale cheep?  or free? :)
(freegeek maybe good place to look?)

When it was still working I had Xubuntu on it, ran fairly decently, and
would work fine for a logging station as well.
It runs DSL like a champ too, my only real problem with DSL is old browser,
and can't seem to get it to download and install newer one.

Then in the other corner I have my trusty rusty old G3 Powerbook, which runs
regular Ubuntu fairly well, it's a G3-400 "Lombard", 340MB RAM, and I think
still has the 6GB original HDD (edge of failing).  At any rate it runs quite
well for its age.

This is possible in bash (assuming I understand correctly).  Below is
the relevant portion of my .bashrc -- all my history-related config is
here, it's not all needed for the shared history command "stuff":


# make a multi-line cmd into one line in history
shopt -s cmdhist

# don't put duplicate lines in the history. See bash(1) for more options
export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups
# ... and ignore same sucessive entries.
export HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth

# set up the prompt:
promptCommand() {
    # save the current history to disk on each command (this enables
on-the-fly history sharing between terminals)
    history -a

    ## Snipped a bunch of stuff to set a PS1 based on system status.
}
export PROMPT_COMMAND=promptCommand

Which breaks the intent of the original awk to count command use frequency.

Message-ID: <20080507144657.638782a9.johnxj@comcast.net>

(Crossing fingers.)

Last night I installed wicd on my Hardy x86_64 Lenovo T61 laptop that
has the Intel 4965agn wireless. It failed to detect any of my
neighbors' wireless networks. Of course, at home I am wired, so it
didn't matter, but I assumed that failing to see their networks meant
that it was not working. 

Well, today here I am at PSU. As soon as I booted up I ran wicd and, lo
and behold, there were all the wireless networks. I told it to connect
to pubnet.pdx.edu, and voil?! A few moments later I was logged into my
student account and here I am.

Now all I have to do is wait a while to see if the random disconnect
problems are resolved. 

Oh, and the LED came on as soon as it connected to pubnet.

I may have spoken too soon. After about an hour suddenly I couldn't go
anywhere. I am sitting directly under an access point.

Opening wicd it said that I was connected and displayed the pubnet IP
address. This is exactly the same problem I had before - all systems
say I am connected and that I have an IP address, but the DHCP lease is
really terminated. And this happens at Free Geek, Starbucks and any
other wireless network I connect to.

At least wicd makes it easy to renew the lease. Previously I had to go
to a command line and cycle through modprobing the iwl4965, restarting
the network, modprobing some more, doing iwlist scan, and several other
command line tools before suddenly it would decide to give me a
connection and a DHCP lease. With wicd I can just click - click - click
and it reconnects with a new lease. At least it just did so.

The problem is why I am suddenly losing the lease (timing is random)
and why the command line and GUI tools fail to see that the lease has
been lost.

Nice.  How did you know about modinfo?

I did a man on lsmod, modprobe, insmod, and rmmod, none of which
reference modinfo.  A man on modinfo did reference modprobe.  Since
cross-referencing seems inomplete, I tried this to see what other
interesting module commands may show up:

$ man -k module | grep -i kernel

pcimodules looks interesting, although I'm not quite clear on how it
differs from lsmod.

Indeed. It works great, but I googled all over looking for something
like it without luck. Thanks for the info. Now I'm off to find out what
the latest version from Intel is and try to figure out how to install
it.

It is configured via 2000/XP/98 through a program that works over USB.

I was dismayed that this used AP didn't come with drivers, but I
was able to download them at least.

This is a Linksys WAP yes?
If so, it should have a web based configuration, like all Linksys routers.
It should be the default gateway address (such as 192.168.1.1, or
192.168.1.254 or etc), check the manual.
It should also have a standard default password, like username:admin,
pw:linksys, etc.  Again check manual.
>From there you can change settings to your liking.

What "drivers" do you need for a WAP?  You need drivers for a wireless card,
but the WAP should be OS agnostic, if your system supports 802.11a/b/g it
should work- as well as good ole 10/100 ethernet for direct interface and
admin.  The only "drivers" you might find would be the proprietary config
program, which you don't really need (shouldn't), and then possibly a
downloadable flash update for the firmware.

I want to start backing up our remote servers using dirvish with SSH. 
This however requires that I allow remote root login through ssh.

I'm trying to figure out the best way of doing this.


In /etc/sshd_config I need to set
PermitRootLogin yes

But is there a way to require root (an only root) to require ssh key 
exchange and not allow remote password login?

I took a different approach but it requires some extra disk space on the
machine being backed up. I do a two-stage backup. In the first stage a cron
job running as root on the host being backed up, backs itself up in to tar
files in a dedicated local area for backups. Permissions for the tar files
are set such that user "backup" has read access. In stage two a cron job on a
remote host logs in via ssh using keys (rsync via ssh actually) as
user "backup" and mirrors the tar files. The backup user does not have a
password. You could also have the first host push the tar files to a
non-root account on another host, as long as the second host is not behind
a NAT'ing firewall or something.

Terry might have a better solution for you there, but I've done this
before for non-root users for system accounts and such.  You can simply
lock the user's password hash, disabling all password login for that
user with:

# password -l <USER>

However, ssh key logins should still work fine.  Of course for root that
means you can't su anymore, but you should be using sudo anyway, right?
Of course this solution may not work if you're using LDAP or something
as a backend (but who does that for root users anyway?).

HTH,

Out of necessity, I took it one step further (or to the side, if one 
prefers) ... I was doing the backup locally and then using a remote 
machine to pick up a copy, but for space constraints I had to gzip it on 
the go and the whole mess just took too long (running into the users and 
degrading the performance of both the machine and the database, plus 
making the backups iffy).

(short story)
Solution - move the backup process to the remote machine and gzip the 
files after the backups are copied completely.  I use a shell script 
(BASH, but Bourne would do as well) on A to get do the backups on B.  I 
embed expect scripts in the shell script to do whatever is needed on A 
(telnet, ssh, ftp), and B (sql included).  By redirecting the expect 
script like this ...
    /usr/bin/expect << EOF > $TempLogFile
... I capture an output file on A that my shell script can manipulate 
for required data to continue.

(long story)
... if you want more, just ask ... tell me what you need to know ... 
hope this helps

"man 5 sshd_config" says PermitRootLogin can be "without-password' in
which case password authentication is disabled for the root user. See
also the "forced-commands-only" option.

vnc will do it, on (virtually) any combination of OSes. Take a look at
the shared and viewonly options (they exist for vncviewer -- there are
many implementations of vnc though, YMMV.)

SSH can be programmed to do this, see the sshd_config man page.  I
think you want "PermitRootLogin without-password", which permits 
keyed login but not password login;  not sure.

For extra security, you can do this through a VPN tunnel.  The double 
encryption adds a little runtime, but dirvish/rsync is efficient for
most data sets, and usually disk-access limited anyway.

Thw VPN/SSH setup will also facilitate remote system administration. 
Note that if you are backing up the whole machine, the backup client
has no secrets from the backup server anyway.

When trying to backtrace spammers, the WHOIS information is typically
skimpy to nonexistent; I get a page of boilerplate, but none of the
contact information that was available a year or two ago.

It is not surprising that this is happening; under the guise of privacy,
Versign is protecting their fellow criminals.  Still, it would be nice
to be able to track down the bad guys.

   I see this on some queries, but certainly not on all. Most of the ones
that have only the name are small operators, so I block their IP addresses.
The sites that have full information -- including an abuse username -- get
my boilerplate spam report. (The ISPs in Brittain frequently follow up with
a message that they've taken the appropriate actions.)

   I've wondered why not all queries return the full set of information, but
didn't bother looking into it.

   I'm trying to write an awk/gawk script to alter the field sequence in a
data file containing about 300 lines. Because of different field separators
in each line I've not figure out how to write an expression that works.

   The file is to insert data into a SQL database table. The original lines
are like this one:

INSERT INTO "Rules" VALUES('Few','Inorganics','Aquifer','GroundWater'

   What I need for output is this:

INSERT INTO "Rules" VALUES('GroundWater','Aquifer','Inorganics','Few'

so I can finish the statements.

   My trials taught me that gawk sees 4 fields, not 8, because the first
four are separated by spaces while the last four strings are separated by
commas.

   Suggestions solicited.

are the commas or spaces unique to field separators? I would probably just
fix the field separators that are wrong, and then grab the fields normally.

   Thought: if I change the FS to ',' then I can ignore the first four
strings and match the pattern of the last four strings. Yes?

wes,

   Here's what I've tried, but it does not work as desired:

BEGIN {FS = " "}
       {print $1, $2, $3}
       {FS = ","}
       {print $4, "," $3, "," $2, "," $1}

   If I add the 4th field to the first print statement, nothing's changed.
The output of this version is totally messed up.

   Any thoughts on the path to the proper approach?

Thanks,

Rich

Can you use sqlite?

$ apt-get install sqlite

$ sqlite3 foo.db "create table Rules (a,b,c,d);"
$ cat <<eof | sqlite3 foo.db
INSERT INTO "Rules" VALUES('Few','Inorganics','Aquifer','GroundWater');
eof
$ sqlite3 foo.db "alter table Rules rename to bar;"
$ sqlite3 foo.db "create table Rules as select d,c,b,a from bar;"
$ sqlite3 foo.db ".dump Rules"
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE 'Rules'(d,c,b,a);
INSERT INTO "Rules" VALUES('GroundWater','Aquifer','Inorganics','Few');
COMMIT;

Pipe that through grep to get just the inserts.

Is the data file a series of SQL statements?
If not, please provide an example.

Is the intent to have the VALUES parameters reshuffled to fit another order?

Perhaps your solution lies in viewing the problem from a different perspective.

When I read the SQL I mentally rewrote it as:

  INSERT INTO "Rules" (Quantity, Type, Location, Resource) VALUES
('Few','Inorganics','Aquifer','GroundWater');

Well actually I thought ... "Rules" (Foo, Bar, Baz, Fee) ...

I'm sort of simplistic when it comes to this stuff.

I would pipe the output to sed, then pipe the output of that to your awk
command.

[get data] | sed "s/ /,/" | awk [print your stuff in the order you want]

   I need to add these to the table Rules, and prefer to do so with SQLite's
.read rather than manually within the application.

   I considered modifying each row to include the field names, but thought
that awk would be the most parsimonious solution. Guess I can change that.

   OK, Took the path of least resistance and added field names.

In a SQL insert statement, can one not ...
    INSERT INTO tablename (column4,column3,column1,column2) 
VALUES(value4,value3,value1,value2);
... does that help?

This is pretty bad if you're running Debian or any derivative (e.g. Ubuntu):

http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/msg00152.html

This also affects anyone who migrated keys generated on a Debian

Debian right now:

Ubuntu already has the fix in the repositories:

$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

which will also resets your hosts keys.

Debian also has the fix, but you have to reset the host keys yourself.

Well, it seems I figured out the solution on my own.  I tried using dpkg 
in what I thought were unsuccessful attempts to resolve the dependency 
issues.  Either something I did worked or something changed in the 
repository and apt-get update/upgrade solved the problem.

Did you hear about the SSH vulnerability that was patched in Debian and all
it's derivatives (including Ubuntu)?
Debian:
http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/msg00152.html

Ubuntu
https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2008-May/000705.html

Note this was a Debian (and derivative) specific issue, with the packages
(random number generator wasn't really random, getting "dirty" data), not an
issue with OpenSSH or OpenSSL itself.

This is most likely the reason.
Not sure about the templates issue you saw but it could be there was
something related that was also fixed...

As a side note you may want to regenerate your SSH keys on your Ubuntu box,
if you log into it remotely (probably even if you don't).

Thanks for the pointer.  I received another update this morning that 
(according to what I Googled) regenerated the appropriate keys (replaced 
a certificate).  I went ahead and followed the instructions to 
regenerate them again, just for giggles.  I am not using remote login at 
this time, but will be again in the near future.

Upgrading your ubuntu boxes will result in regenerating the hostkey.

On debian boxes check the date of the keys, if they are prior to 
September 2006, they are probably ok, otherwise I think you need to 
replace the keys yourself.

ssh-keygen -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key -t rsa -N ''
ssh-keygen -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key -t dsa -N ''

Also there is a new package available in ubuntu called 
openssh-blacklist.  It's also available in and in lenny and etch, using

deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security etch/updates main

Installing this will prevent compromised keys from logging into boxes.

Also check out the new command ssh-vulnkey in the openssh-client 
package.  It uses the openssh-blacklist package to highlight compromised 
keys.

Finally ssh-keygen -lf <file> will help you generate fingerprints to 
help located bad keys.

If you still doubt how bad this is, see:
  http://metasploit.com/users/hdm/tools/debian-openssl/

To exploit weak SSH host keys, an attacker would likely need to
man-in-the-middle the connection.  To exploit SSH client keys, he would
merely need to know/guess a user name that has a weak key and then grid
at it for a while in an online attack.  Similar attacks would exist for
SSL and any other keys generated by openssl under debian, et. al.

Thanks Sean,

The bit of research I did led me to do just what you suggested.  This I 
did after I found the openssh-blacklist and something else ready to 
install with the upgrade manager this morning.

Thanks!

Come one!  Come most!  Sunday May 18th at 1PM, we will be holding Yet
Another Linux Clinic at Free Geek at 1731 SE 10th Avenue in Portland
( www.freegeek.org ).   We will be using the meeting room on the
southeast corner of the building.  The main facility and the store
is closed on Sunday.

We've got distros!  We've got wifi and wired networking!  We've
got coffee and cookies!  We've got Portland Punch!  We are out of
Penguinos, and not buying more!!!  I can bring some fresh fruit,
as long as nobody invites John Cleese ...

I will have a few home-made copies of Ubuntu 8.04LTS Hardy Heron,
the best Ubuntu so far.  However, we can also help you with RedHat,
Suse, and Debian.  We can even help you dispose of Windows!

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu 30-boot forced fsck
Message-ID: <20080514224046.44115b1d.johnxj@comcast.net>

I've been bitching about this for years. Every 30th boot Ubuntu tells
me it needs to do an fsck. I think that is a great idea, except it
always pops up when I am in a professr's office and have just said "let
me show you what I mean ..." It never happens when I have a lot of time
and it doesn't matter. A "next time, please" button is what I have
begged for.

So just now I installed the new ssh security stuff on my desktop, which
required a reboot. And when it came up it was the 30th reboot. But this
time the screen said:

Routine check of drives: /dev/md2
Press esc to skip
Routine check of drives: /dev/md3
Press esc to skip

This is the first time it has been rebooted since the upgrade to Hardy
x86_64. I am thrilled to see that the issue has finally been addressed.

But there is a small problem. My laptop runs exactly the same Hardy
x86_64, and coincidentally it went through the 30th boot routine this
afternoon. However, the "Routine check" notice above never came up. I
just had to sit there five or ten minutes until it finished.

I wonder if it has to do with the fact that the laptop runs just plain
ext3 and the desktop drives are set up with mdadm as mirror neurons.
Has anyone else experienced this yet?

tune2fs -c 0 -i 0 /dev/XXX # /dev/sda1 or /dev/md0 or whatever

I don't know if the disk checks are a deliberate decisions by the
creators of the Ubuntu installer, or a side effect of you creating the
filesystems by hand instead of using the installer, but the above can be
used to turn if off.

Or you could use a better file system like xfs or reiserfs.  Ext2/3 is 
SLOW and even with journaling on ext3 you still need to fsck periodicaly 
like you describe.  XFS and Reiserfs are Btree based and have a native 
integrated journal so unless your file system has major damage, they 
won't need to fsck, ever.

I don't want to turn it off. A periodic fsck is a good idea. I want it
to give me the option to skip it until the next boot.

As far as I know the 30-boot mandatory fsck is an Ubuntu thing. I've
been using Ubuntu since Breezy and it's always been there, but from
comments by others it does not appear in all distros.

Just now I checked /boot/grob/menu.lst on the desktop and the laptop
and I don't see any differences that should cause the desktop to give
me a skip option where the laptop does not. 

Having said that I suspect the reason the laptop does not is because of
usplash. The installations on the laptop and the desktop  were both
brand new installations of Gutsy, But the usplash never worked on the
laptop, so after much gnashing of teeth I installed splashy instead.
When I upgraded the laptop to Hardy I discovered that Ubuntu had fixed
whatever problems caused usplash not to work, so I uninstalled splashy.
I note that when the laptop went into the mandatory usplash yesterday
it cut to the command line, where the desktop still stayed in the
usplash mode. That is probably why the laptop does not give me the
option to skip while the desktop does.

I need to figure out what Ubuntu is doing on the desktop to give me the
option to skip the  mandatory 30-boot fsck so I can enable it on the
laptop as well.

Both XFS and ReiserFS (and JFS as well) have some quirks, some 
situations where they rock and some situations where they suck. I've 
seen lots of filesystem benchmarks go by and my net conclusion was that, 
unless you're doing the exact kind of I/O that one of the "alternative" 
filesystems rocks with, you're better off accepting the default you 
distro installs. Most of them default to ext3, but I think one of them 
does default to reiserfs 3.

SUSE used to use reiserfs by default. However, because of reiser4
Namesys basically abandoned reiserfs years ago. There's a couple of
developers at Novell maintaining reiserfs for SLES, but apparently
everyone hates it because the code is so ugly. Novell has announced that
SLES11 will use ext3/ext4 instead. openSUSE has already started down
this path. Looks like reiserfs's days are numbered.

Actually, most filesystems are really good at certain things and pretty
sucky at others. ext2/3 on the other hand tends to be middle of the
road, rarely the best and never the worst. Because it is the official
Linux filesystem, it tends to have a larger number of developers
maintaining it and better integration with other Linux features. For
example, ext3 and reiserfs can grow and shrink whereas xfs and jfs can
only grow. ext3 and xfs can store selinux labels, but reiserfs and jfs
can't. ext3 is supported by all distros, some don't even include
reiserfs, xfs or jfs and of those that do include them many don't
officially support them.

My personal approach is to use ext3 for most filesystems, and XFS when I
want its unique advantages. I have a couple of XFS filesystems
under /data because compared to ext3, I'm able to store about 10% more
data on XFS. I tend to avoid resierfs these days. And JFS isn't
available on some of the distros I use.

It would be nice if there was advanced warning - that is, something
that comes up and says "After 4 more reboots, I'm going to do an 
auto-fsck".  You really ought to do this more often than the value
written with tune2fs.  I suggest looking around for some program that
can provide this warning, say sending you an email when an fsck is
imminent.  There is probably such a program out there;  if not,
somebody could write a script that takes apart the information from:

   sudo /sbin/dumpe2fs -h /dev/hdaXXX 

... where XXX is one of your partitions.  dumpe2fs will tell you (among
many other things) things like:

   ...
   Mount count:              10
   Maximum mount count:      33
   Last checked:             Mon Mar 17 09:11:16 2008
   Check interval:           15552000 (6 months)
   Next check after:         Sat Sep 13 09:11:16 2008
   ...

Given an imminent fsck, you can force a premature fsck reboot when
there is time available by doing a "sudo touch /forcefsck" followed
by a reboot from the menu, or a "sudo /sbin/shutdown -F -r" which
does the fsck-forcing reboot.  When that is done, it will reset
the counters to 33 or whatever is set by tune2fs.

You really ought to do an fsck every 3 months or so.  Hard drives do
unravel at the edges over time, and fsck cleans up some of the damage. 
In my case, I leave my laptop up all the time (suspending when I
transport it) and I am surprised by the "fsck after 180 days"
limit more often than I run into the maximum mount count limit.  Ditto
my servers, which only go down for kernel upgrades.

Running a file system like reiserfs just moves the "unravelling" problem
deeper down.  Yes, it will recover more often than ext3, but when it
encounters a problem it can't handle (and there are *always* classes of
problems unanticipated by the author) you are pretty much hosed.  I don't
know about the reliability/fixability of XFS or other advanced file
systems, they may be better, but nothing is perfect, and no advanced file
system written in (say) 2006 is going to accomodate all the weird new
failure mechanisms that an advanced technology drive released in 2007
or later may produce.  Worst case, the drive manufacturers may be
incorporating hardware level fixes optimized for windoze NTFS that
totally hose the repair mechanisms for the Linux file system.  In that
case, you want to use a popular file system that is (1) supported by your
distro, and (2) frequently upgraded by your distro supplier, so that
there is a chance that these hardware quirks get noticed and accomodated.

At the end of the day, be thankful that these inconvenient fscks happen
*sometime*.  Windoze ignores most of these problems, and your data is at
much higher risk.  The bits on a modern hard drive are tiny and fragile,
and you lose some from time to time, even if the disk is just sitting
there unused.  The hardware makes corrections, but not 100% perfectly,
and rarely-visited files aren't frequently tested for these bit
failures.  fsck examines the entire partition, forcing a hardware-level
rewrite if nothing else, and keeping the system healthy.  That means
that you will be faced with catastrophic failures much less often.

I have not and, like you, think this is a great feature.  If it would
be anywhere, I would imagine it would be somewhere in the startup
scripts.  So, I greped for 'routine' in the /etc/ tree but didn't find
anything:

$ sudo grep -R -i routine /etc/

The next place I thought to look was in the *fsck* binaries:

$ sudo strings -f /sbin/*fsck* | grep -i routine

Again, nothing.  Same results with Gutsy and Hardy.  If that feature
exists, it's well hidden.

Regards,
- Robert

You generally can't check a filesystem that can be written to because
something might change while the check is going on, and it could
incorrectly report errors.  There may very well be more dangerous
consequences too -- I'm not sure, but it seems reasonable that the FS
check is going to be doing things that normal programs shouldn't
interfere with.

Therefore, you've got to mount the partition as read only:

$ sudo mount -o remount,ro /dev/hdb1

should do it.

When the check is done:

$ sudo mount -o remount,rw /dev/hdb1

(running from memory, the last part may need to be a mount point, eg:
/ not a device)

Note that you probably can't write the check log to /dev/hdb1 if
you're checking /dev/hdb1...

it works either way (device or mount point).  you may also find the
"-n" flag to mount useful--i use it by reflex now, since it was at
some point required to move an FS from R/O to R/W or back.

note:  mounting an actively in-use (ie being written to) volume
read-only may cause some havoc with stuff crashing as it can't write
needed files.  gnome definitely tanked once when i did that.  it's
been years since i used gnome though, so hopefully developers have
gotten smarter with failing gracefully...  and certainly you'll lose
some syslog info if you were to do that to the partition syslog would
write to.

so don't leave it r/o for longer than you need =)

This ability to escape out of  the maintenance e2fsck  at boot was added in
an Ubuntu patch to the initscripts.

http://patches.ubuntu.com/by-release/atomic/ubuntu/s/sysvinit/sysvinit_2.86.ds1-14.1ubuntu35.patch

You might be able  to apply this patch on your laptop, copy over the patched
script, or upgrade sysvinit.

I am at the Cedar Hills Crossing PTP node (Yay, PTP!) and connected
to my home network on Verizon FIOS.  Ping time is 65msec;  a
traceroute shows my packets are being routed through Los Angeles. 
Often connecting through other networks to home show packets going
through Seattle or Oakland.  When I ping from a friend's house in
Bethany, also on FIOS and about 10 miles away, the ping time is
1.2msec .

On other news, ping time from CHC to dns1.easystreet.com is 13.2msec.
CHC is served through Infinity Internet, BTW.

Has anyone built a graph or chart showing ping times between various
networks in the Portland area?  Are there internet providers that
tend to have better local connectivity?  It would be nice to know
which network to put a local server on, for example, or keep track
of network improvements.

Here is one place to start:

http://www.nwax.net/


I helped on the technical side of this when I was with PSU.  The theory is the
members that are located at NWAX will exchange local BGP routes, thus keeping as
much traffic off their expensive tier-1 upstreams as possible.

It was up to the members to setup those agreements between each other, so you
have a partial mesh of peering agreements.  Some members allocate more time to
that than others.

It's nice I can get to mirrors.cat.pdx.edu from my Easystreet colo through NWAX.

Message-ID: <20080516114442.245c270c.johnxj@comcast.net>

I need to use an .flv video clip in a class presentation. It would be
best to play it in an Impress slide show, but if I have to launch a
separate application to play it, that is doable. The problem is that
the classroom has only a Windows XP computer on it with standard PSU
program load (which includes OOo). I did place the .flv file on a slide
in OOo 2.4 Linux and it plays fine on my Ubuntu laptop. It won't play
in OOo 2.2 Windows in the classroom.

I figured out how to use ffmpg to convert the .flv to .mpg, but the
sound did not make it. The video resolution was also crappy. I need the
highest resolution possible, as it will be displayed on the classroom
screen. The resolution of the original is not too great, so if there is
any way to fake up an enhancement, that would be coolness.

What I need to know most is what format would be best for playing the
video when placed in an OOo Impress file running on Windows. I know
nothing whatsoever about movie formats, so any suggestions are welcome.

ffmpeg to convert to an MPG file is probably your best, following that maybe
mplayer/mencoder, or avidemux (though I'm not sure avidemux supports flv).
ffmpeg is incredibly featureful and generally can do a good job, but the
defaults are often "sub-optimal". So, if the quality is noticeably degraded
from the original start poking at the options and see if you can improve
things by explicitly specifying various options.
http://howto-pages.org/ffmpeg/#basicvideo is a reasonable starting place,
though I have no idea if this is more or less sophisticated than what you've
already done.

I can think of two possible solutions. One is VLC medial player. There 
are both Windows, and Linux versions (free).  http://www.videolan.org/vlc/

Another is a Windows only application called ConvertXtoDVD. I don't know 
if it is free, but it supposedly can convert any video media to a 
standard DVD.

One thing I forgot to mention is that I can request that software be
installed on the Windows XP computer in the classroom, but I have no
direct control over it. But having said that, I have just discovered
that it does have VLC on it. And VLC does play the original .flv file
perfectly, complete with audio. 

So VLC is my backup, but I'd still like the video to play in Impress,
and Impress (at least version 2.2/Windows that is installed on the
classroom computer can't handle a .flv file at all. That's why I
originally used ffmpg to convert the .flv to .mpg. Impress does play
the .mpg file, but without sound and the resolution is much lower than
the original. 

I think the problem with the .mpg file is my own failure to grasp how
to use ffmpeg correctly. I note that the man page for ffmpeg is long,
and I did not understand most of the switches and options.

However, as a starter, it would be good to figure out the properties of
the .flv file. If I can figure that out I would have a better chance of
getting ffmepg to do a good conversion. If I right-click on the .flv
file in Nautilus and then on Properties it tells me the duration, that
the Video Bitrate is 316 kbps, and that for the Audio there are 0
channels. The display is "N/A" for Audio Codec, Sample Rate and
Bitrate. is there a better tool to find out the parameters of the .flv
file?

I've only done this in Windows, so pardon me. "Internet Video Converter" 
makes it pretty painless, and is a front end for ffmpeg and mencoder and 
can output the Flash video file to anything you want.

Subject: [PLUG] cdrecord from cronjob
Message-ID: <482E58DB.3000706@acm.org>

I've run into an interesting situation and am looking for some insight.

The scripts that copies some selected directories, creates and iso 
image, blanks the CD-RW, then burns the image to the CD works fine from 
the command line but when called aa a cronjob cdrecord seems to get it 
wrong.  Some times the blanking doesn't work and sometimes it does and 
then the iso burn works but when trying to mount the drive it tosses all 
kinds of fits about not finding a valid file system.

Since it works from the command line I'm assuming I've got all the 
pieces write but it pukes from cron.

Clue-stick anyone?


TIA,
Rod

When that happens to me, I add an "su" to the crontab line ... something 
like this ...
    0 5 * * * su - username -c command
... another thing that I find helps in some cases is to give the full 
path name of the built-ins
    /bin/echo instead of echo, for example
Mostly that has been on SGI IRIX, but occasionally on Linux
Hope that helps

I've seen things like this happen a few times. I attribute it to the 
fact that cron usually runs commands with SHELL set to /bin/sh, which is 
  usually (but not always?) different than /bin/bash.

To fix this I often just make a small script to contain the commands I 
want cron to run. Then just make sure that script has #!/bin/bash (or 
whatever you need) at the top. cron will then run that script which can 
have the normal environment you expect on the command line.

If it's not a path problem, could you bump up the error reporting level

(when the scsi trickery didn't shuffle the dev entry).  Something like

Pluggers,

I will be bringing remastered 32-bit Ubuntu and Kubuntu 8.04LTS Heron CDs
with updates as of 5/17.
Updates tend to expand the size (+8%), so they will in fact be DVDs.
These will hopefully can save on load time and network bandwidth.

discover the same (or indistinguishable mangling) in both zsh and

this from others, I presume it is something in my ancient

Ooh.  I bothered to look at /usr/share/man/man1/jhead.1.gz and found
this is the source paragraph corresponding to the mangling above:

First clue is:

  $ man -l /usr/share/man/man1/jhead.1.gz > /tmp/jhead.man

gives me the same mangling I reported.

  $ man -l -Tps /usr/share/man/man1/jhead.1.gz > /tmp/jhead.ps 

renders an unmangled postscript file.  However, the following gives me
an interesting, but thus-far-not-understood error:

  $ man -l -Tdvi /usr/share/man/man1/jhead.1.gz > /tmp/jhead.dvi

So, it looks like there is a font problem?

Mine does the same thing. It seems to have something to do with
character sets and locales. I have $LANG set to "en_US.UTF-8". Setting
it to "C" produces readable man pages.

I have found that most strange text in man pages can be rendered 
properly by doing
export LC_ALL=C
in your shell.  As stated above, it's a local problem.  As side effect 
of LC_ALL=C is that ls will sort ascii, so case and dot files sort as 
we're used to.

Fred, Daniel, and Robert.  Thanks for the ideas and suggestions.

Interestingly enough is I had implemented most of them.  Script begins 
with #!/bin/bash, full paths to all the commands.  Along with checking 
that script is executable by root whose cronjob it is.

I'm going to look at the mkisofs and cdrecord parameters again. 
Possibly slow down the write speed for cdrecord and add a couple more 
switches to mkisofs in case I'm trying to burn a buggered image.

The real bummer is when I upgraded this system I forgot to grab the 
script that I had created several years ago.  But when I looked at the 
older CDs there were problems so I don't know how long this has been 
happening.  Could be a /slightly/ buggered CD-RW drive.

Got to do some more looking in the spare parts pile to see if there is 
another CD-RW to test with.

Again thanks for all the input.

LC_COLLATE is the variable that determines sort order. I set it to "C" 
in all shells to get the traditional ls listings. (LC_ALL is the trump 
card of locale variables, overriding LANG and LC_*.)

My assessment is that you'd be better off fixing your UTF-8 display 
issues than ignoring them by forcing everything to ASCII.

Does locale(1) show that you have en_US.utf8 stuff installed?

   locale -a | grep ^en_US

On Debian systems, /etc/locale.gen determines what locales get built 
when libc is updated.

Debian also includes a validlocale(8) utility that can be handy. On 
this system, I've got American English Unicode installed, but not 
native German (my forebears would be aghast!):

   [heinlein at monk ~]$ validlocale en_US.UTF-8
   locale 'en_US.UTF-8' valid and available
   [heinlein at monk ~]$ validlocale de_DE.UTF-8
   locale 'de_DE.UTF-8' not available
   de_DE.UTF-8 UTF-8

The very last line -- "de_DE.UTF-8 UTF-8" -- is what I would add to 
/etc/locale.gen if I wanted to make German available. Then I'd run 
locale-gen(8) to bootstrap the new locale.

I've been too lazy, up until now. "validlocale" showed that
en_US.UTF-8 was indeed valid on my system. Turns out that rxvt doesn't
support two-byte character sets, so I upgraded to rxvt-unicode-lite.
No more wacky unrecognized characters in my manpages!

Looks like I've had a joe-job done to my main email address.  Forged 
envelopes with my address as the Return-Path.  A couple of thousand 
bounce messages since around 10:30 this morning and still coming in.

Any ideas as to how to identify that they are bounce messages.  Is there 
a postfix header check or a procmail recipe?

I'll probably start with the Sender containing postmaster and dump that 
into a folder.  That should cut down on the pile I have to sort through 
so I don't miss a real message.

Not sure Spam Assassin would help and this is a pretty old mail server, 
running postfix, that has never been compromised before, so installing 
Spam Assassin isn't a good option.  I'm working towards replacing it but 
not ready yet.  Looks like I might have to get ready sooner.

Man do I hate Mondays!

It is not a joejob..  It is spam with your address as the return address.

A JoeJob is when someone sends out mail to nail you personally.

This is just a case of someone picking a random address off the net and
setting it as a return address.  (It happens all the time.  I have gotten
these for at least the last 10 years off and on.)

Examples of joe jobs are like the mail I got a while back claiming that
you could buy drugs and/or kid porn films at a site owned by a group of
Russian Jews.  It was done to cause law enforcement and/or vigilante
action against the site.  That is not happening in your case.

Bummer.

I can't believe that there are still that many mail servers that are 
queueing mail without running spam/virus filters during the SMTP 
transaction -- in which case the sending MTA is responsible for the 
bounce. When the sender is a spambot, which is likely in this case, 
the failure notice is ignored, because the $$$ are made by sending 
spam, not forged bounces.

Spam's been a major problem for years now. Why are recipient MTAs 
still accepting responsibility for bouncing spam?

I can think of a number of reasons.  Most people who run mail servers do
not have any clue how to configure them correctly.  Or they picked
software that does not filter well.  Or they use packages that do stupid
things like generate bounce messages on viruses and other bogus content.

There are over 1,000 solutions to spam.  Most of them are bad.

This happened to me a few weeks ago and it tapered off after a few days

Thanks all.  Alan you are correct.  I jumped too deep into it.  The fact 
it looks like I'm sending all these messages out made it feel like a joe 
job.  I run a pretty tight mail server and double checked to make sure 
it wasn't an open relay of any flavor.

I saw something similar a couple of weeks ago but that was right after I 
sent mail to the dovecot list.  In that case I figured is was a 
compromised PC on the list.  This time I had just given my email address 
out for order tracking to a company I've never used before.  But when it 
went wild with thousands I got worried my system or account might have 
been compromised.  It hasn't!

So I guess I'm in it for a bit longer.

The term is "backscatter" when you are not being deliberately targeted
but instead your email address is simply being abused.

Dealing with backscatter has been my struggle for the past many weeks,
but I've more or less got it under control now with some custom filters
that I slapped together.

First I try to determine if the message is some sort of bounce, legit
or not. If so then I try to find the original message either as an
attachment or in-line. In-line is most difficult because there are so
many different formats with different delimiters. But if I can find the
original message then I run it through the regular spam filters. If it
turns up positive then I assume my bounce is backscatter.

If I can't find the original message then I just search the body of the
bounce message for the original "From:" line. If I find it I pick out the
name and address. Say for example it's this:

   From: "go large" <myaddress at example.com>

(I also check the "From:" line even in the cases where I do find the
entire attached message, but where it passes the regular spam filters.)

The backscatter clue is that the string "go large" does not match
the string "Terry Griffin". [Insert your own joke here.] For myself and
every user on my mail server I know their real name. I lookup the name
using the email address from the "From:" line, then do a fuzzy string
comparison between their name and whatever name is in the "From:" line.
If there is no similarity then I assume the original message was spam
with a forged address, and that the bounce is backscatter.

Some bounces unfortunately don't contain enough of the original spam
to work with. But even so I'm now getting a backscatter catch rate
well in to the 90% range and no false positives.

Rod,

   In my postfix header checks I have a line that looks like this:

/^Received: from nnn.nn.nnn.nn/                 reject Rule H9

where the obfuscated part is my public IP address. Since my MTA will never
receive mail from the outward-looking IP address I know it has to have been
spoofed. Catches quite a few every day.

   Don't know if that will help you or not, but I offer it in case it's
something you've not yet implemented.

Rich

I had not heard this, but it does not surprise me. Considering the poor
turnout last year I imagine they lost money on it.

Message-ID: <20080519182808.bab5db27.johnxj@comcast.net>

I need to do a class presentation at PSU. OOo Impress does a dandy job
of creating the slides and stuff. However, when I open the Impress file
on the Windows computer in the classroom stuff doesn't work. The most
recent exasperation was a video file in .mov format. So I finally
decided that it would be a lot easier just to hook up my T61 with Hardy
and run it directly.

But that turns out to be a lot of trouble also. I use the
nvidia-glx-new driver, so I installed nvidia-settings as well. If I run
it as root I can click on "Detect Displays" and it finds the projector
in the classroom. I can even get the projector to display my laptop.
That is, part of it. My laptop runs at 1680 x 1050 and I need every
pixel of it. But the nvidia-settings utility sees the projector as only
640 x 480. All that I see of my desktop is a small corner. 

How can I cram 1680 x 1050 into a device that only does 640 x 480?

I have a feeling that I have overlooked something basic.

I should also add that the nvidia-settings utility is confusing because
I don't understand what the options mean. E.g., what is the difference
between "twinview" "separate X screen"? It's kind of clunky too. Some
changes require restarting X. I do so by Ctrl-Alt-Backspace, and when I
log back in again I discover that my Gnome panel settings are gone.

I know there are people here who connect laptops to projectors at PSU
all the time. Is there a simple, reliable method that even a dummy like
me can figure out?

Does the projector have its own resolution settings - unless it's really 
old, it should offer a few better resolutions - at least 1280x1024. 
These settings are typically controlled by hardware buttons on the 
projector. Try setting the reolution on the project, then booting your 
laptop while connect - nvidia-settings should see it then. You only need 
to run nvidia-settings as root if you want to save the changes to your 
xorg.conf file.

Unless it's a high-end projector, i don't think it will offer 
wide-screen resolutions like your laptop.

Clarity is not a feature of large parts of the spam fighting community I
am sad to say.

I have been on the wrong end of too damn many anti-spam twits who got a
piece of spam on a mailing list (like say p5p) and then complained to
the isp of the person running the mailing list and his isp and so on.
(Without checking if it actually came from there or not.)

Too many people say "something must be done! This is something,
therefore we must do it!" without figuring out what effect it will have
if they do.

There is a big difference between a joe job and backscatter.  I have
seen enough of each to be able to tell the difference.

For some still yet unknown reason, the Ubuntu Live 2008 conference has
been canceled and I am left wondering why ;-(  Does anyone have
details?  What is most disappointing is that two of the youngest Linux
speakers in history, both members of TeensOnLinux.org (15 years old),
will now be unable to present their material.

Can anyone cite a source?  From looking at the website, it seems like
it's still going to happen:

Been to long since I had to deal with any real serious problems.  Yes, 
odd though it may seem from my lack of cluefulness, I admin a few mail 
spools but they have been running so well I don't have to deal with or 
think about these issues.  The brain has been working other stuff so 
last used is first dumped.  :-)

How are you coding and calling them?

I'm working my way through the LDA (deliver) that dovecot offers and 
it's filtering (sieve, etal.) option.  Currently I use procmail but 
there appears to be better/easier using deliver.

Great.  Worth doing on my personal email server and other places.

Thanks Rich.  I'll have to see if the headers have same/similar Received

Everything starts out going through /etc/procmailrc, but from there
I invoke various other filters including Vipul's Razor, Bogofilter,
and SpamAssassin. For backscatter I wrote a custom python script
also invoked from /etc/procmailrc. If the custom script determines
the message is a bounce and it can find a message attachment then
it runs the attachment through Vipul's Razor etc. Sometimes it finds
only the headers of the original message. These too can be run
through SpamAssassin but are less useful to Bogofilter and completely
useless for Vipul's Razor. If the message gets through all that without
being flagged as backscatter then the custom script does the final check
using the "From:" header method I described before, if it can find the
"From:" header that is.

If you always send your mail via your personal server then Rich's
solution of checking the Received header would be a lot easier. In
my case that's not an option since a lot of my users send mail from
other places via other mail servers.

Indeed it is.  Although it seems as though the Ubuntu talks will be
rolled into OSCON.  Logistically, that would seem to make sense from

Subject: [PLUG] Using Konqueror for FTP client
Message-ID: <48346EBB.6040904@comcast.net>

I currently have two Comcast personal web space sites:

http://home.comcast.net/~rsteff/

and

http://home.comcast.net/~nwtours/index.html

I used Konqueror as my ftp client to update the nwtours site this
morning. Then I tried to use Konqueror to look at the rsteff site, but
kept getting the nwtours site instead.

When I go to ftp://upload.comcast.net/ with Konqueror I get a log in
dialog box. I type in the user name and password for rsteff, but I'm
sent to the directory for nwtours.

Do I have a Comcast problem, or a Konqueror problem? If it's a Konqueror
problem, how do I clear whatever it's holding that keeps pointing to at
the previously visited directory? If it's a Comcast problem, does anyone
know what to do about it? If not, I'll ask them (that usually results in
several iterations of irrelevant instructions until I finally get
someone who understands).

TIA.

Message-ID: <4a0b36aa0805212212v12b82595q5ff49e2109eccad6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi:

I am running Ubuntu 7 on a laptop and I am using a Linksys Wireless-G USB
adapter (model WUSB54GC) to
logon to WIFI SSIDs.  I have no problem with those SSIDs that have no
security or those that uses WPA.

This morning, I went to a location with WEP 128-bit security and I have the
key.  I uses Network Manager and
the scan picks up the SSID I want.  I typed in the WEP key I was given (I
have confirmed the key is correct as I can logon using an XP box) but failed
to connect up with this SSID.  I then switched to using manually
configuration with wpa_supplicant and putting the WEP configuration in the
wpa_supplicant config file.  When
I fire up wpa_supplicant, it complains unable to associate with driver.  (I
uses ndiswrapper with the given
Linsys Win XP driver that comes with the adapter).   I am sure the driver
works fine
as I can see it with ndiswrapper and I have no problem connecting up with
WPA-enabled SSIDs or SSIDs with no
password.

I am at a lost why WEP 128-bit SSID should give me that much trouble.  Any
help much appreciated...

Thanks

Hint: wpa_supplicant does not work with WEP, only with WPA.
You just configure it manually for WEP, with NetworkMangler (TM) or using
iwconfig in a terminal.
See man iwconfig for reference.

iwconfig wlan0 essid [SSID_NAME] key [WEP_KEY]

For NetworkMangler are you sure you are using the correct options?
IE use WEP Open or WEP Shared or etc, not WPA?

WEP and WPA are totally different protocols.

Hmm... That's kinda odd because I use it with WEP all the time.  For
instance, see the configuration examples in: 
  http://hostap.epitest.fi/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/hostap/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf?rev=HEAD

One excerpt:
-----8<--------
# Shared WEP key connection (no WPA, no IEEE 802.1X)
network={
	ssid="static-wep-test"
	key_mgmt=NONE
	wep_key0="abcde"
	wep_key1=0102030405
	wep_key2="1234567890123"
	wep_tx_keyidx=0
	priority=5
}

This is certainly an option as well.  Probably a good way to take one
moving part out of the picture.

IMHO, I suggest ya just go with a nice `n easy X-windows based WEP/WPA
all-in-one solution like one of the following;

wifi-radar @ http://wifi-radar.systemimager.org/
   -OR-
kwifimanager @ http://kwifimanager.sourceforge.net/

Sure, a bash script is easy to produce, and highly manageable :: this is a
sample of what I use for connecting my client to a WEP-encrypt'd access
point via a bash script when I'm not using kwifimanager (I am using a DLink
wireless PCI card, which slackware shows as having a "Atheros
Communications, Inc. AR5212 802.11abg" chipset);

</usr/sbin/WEP2w.sh>
#!/bin/bash
/sbin/ifconfig ath0 down
/usr/local/bin/wlanconfig ath0 destroy
/usr/local/bin/wlanconfig ath0 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode sta
/sbin/ifconfig ath0 up
/sbin/iwconfig ath0 essid 2W10001 mode managed rate auto ap
00:18:3f:xx:xx:xx
/sbin/iwconfig ath0 key 42:28:xx:xx:xx
sleep 3
killall -15 dhcpcd 1> /dev/null 2> /dev/null
/sbin/dhcpcd -t 10 -d ath0

I like all the purty colors though, of kwifimanager   =)   Choose to do
whatever you like, that's the beauty about linux, eh? Good luck! ((The end
of that bash script pulls a DHCP IP address, just FYI.))

I recently had problems with WPA and Network Mnanager.  I changed one of 
the default options from shared to open key and all was good again.

I couldn't get my Linksys WAP11 that is
web page configurable and my slackware
10.1 box to talk with WEP enabled even
with the keys written down and:

iwconfig wlan0 key xx-xx-xx-xx [1] ... key yy-yy-yy-yy [4] key [4]

So I turned WEP off, which is not ideal.

One of my WAP11's, the 1.4 something version, can only be configured
via Windows using a USB cable.  This sucks ;-(

Trying to use /etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts didn't work, so I commented
everything out except the lines that are supposed to be deleted to
use the examples.

I'm having better luck with /etc/rc.d/rc.wireless.conf for the PCI
based adapter, a Realtek 8180.

I'm using rc.local to configure the two wireless cards in my server
manually.

OK I stand corrected, but perhaps I should have said, wpa_supplicant isn't
*necessary* for WEP, unlike WPA, which you need wpa_supplicant.
The iwconfig tools have built in functionality for handling WEP, and thus
you wouldn't need to use wpa_supplicant, unless you are using scripts or
some sort of setup where you normally use WPA, and have wpa_supplicant
already setup, and want to connect to a WEP only WAP.

So with a WEP WAP without WPA you can use wpa_supplicant but don't need to.
Better?  ;)

And as Tim said it removes one more variable from the picture to narrow down
the problem.

We now return you to your tongue tied regularly scheduled programming...

Well, no one actually uses WEP at home do they?  I mean, it's bloody
pointless, so this would be the common setup, right?  

**looks around the mailing list pointedly**

But seriously, if you have power over your AP, don't use WEP.  WPA
shouldn't be any harder to use these days, and WEP is a joke.

Indeed, if you are in control of a WAP it is best to use WPA.
As one of my previous bosses liked to point out, using WEP is akin to laying
a piece of swiss cheese on top of a WAP for security.


Hey if you have a particularly heavy duty WAP you can make grilled cheese
sandwiches!  OK I'll stop now ...

I am obligated by my position to say that the *best* mode is open.
That said, WEP does one thing well, it establishes that the owner of
the AP is *not* intending to share their connection.  WEP, apparently,
can be cracked in short order, though I've never bothered to try, but
if someone does so, it would be hard for them to argue that they did
it unintentionally.

I think all networks should be open and available to share, as
security guru Bruce Schneier does[1], but I defer to the node owner to
make that decision.  Sharing is the polite and neighborly choice.  If
you want to be a hoarding a**hole, that is absolutely your right.

Ask not what free wifi can do for you, ask what you can do for free wifi.

Yes, it's true there are legal protections here.  More on that in a moment.

Well I have nothing against altruism, but unfortunately there are always
those out there who will exploit the good will of others.  If you made
all of your wifi traffic cleartext, then there's always a chance that
your neighbor will spy on what you're doing.  (Or perhaps more likely,
the guy that compromised his windoze box will sniff all wireless packets
around to gather passwords.)  Some of us do things with our computers
that we'd rather not have known by our neighbors.

> Ask not what free wifi can do for you, ask what you can do for free wifi.

I have often had the desire to set up a secondary open network with
reasonably throttled bandwidth for just this purpose.  Maybe sometime
you could help me out with that.

There are some legal worries I have about this though.  As you mentioned
above, having a locked down wireless network implies that you don't want
others snooping around on it.  If you could actually ever catch someone
cracking it (which is highly unlikely), then you would have some legal
recourse.

On another legal point, if you open up your wireless network to share
with others, you immediately become a provider under federal laws such
as the ECPA, Wiretap act, and Pen registers tap/trace act.  In all
technicality, just running tcpdump on that network could be risky.
You'd certainly want all users to agree to monitoring and other terms to
provide the proper exceptions.  If you aren't set up to do this, (as most
home users wouldn't be) then there would be some risk associated with
providing access to the neighbors.

Comments?

Not always.  Often there are not.  E.g. my node has been providing
access to something like 20 of my neighbors a day.  Rarely (like, none
in at least the last 6 months) have abused the network.  And were they
to, I have the means to teach them better behavior.

Red herring.  Almost nothing (save maybe pop-mail) sends anything
terribly sensitive over the air in the clear.  Any commerce traffic
damn well better be encrypted end-to-end.  Any candy-ass wifi
encryption isn't going to do you a damn bit of good once it's left
your house.

I am not a lawyer, but I have yet to find or hear of any significant
risk from any statute for making your wifi network open.  If there
were, don't you think someone would have already cracked down hard on
some poor coffee shop owners?

I'm sure it does work out well the vast majority of the time.  I just
don't want to have to deal with the feds showing up because someone was
using my connection to download child porn.

It all depends on what you're doing I guess.  I just prefer not to have
to think about it.  I work from home and this changes the game a little
bit for me.

> Encrypted tunnels of various descriptions can help you out there.

Yeah, I guess end-to-end encryption is always better for security, but
it is a lot of work to maintain for each protocol if your goal is simply
to secure your wireless.

> If your network is open, no one is cracking your network.  If they are

Well sure, but there is essentially no way for the average person (and
rarely even for experts) to catch someone who is "cracking your
network".  Computer crimes are anonymous crimes.  Attackers have to be
really dumb to get caught.

Basically the general rule is, you can't snoop on others communications
at all, even if it's on your own network, unless you fall under a
specific exception clause provided by these laws.  This presentation
does an OK job of outlining things:

  http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-02/bh-us-02-eckinwiler-patriot.ppt

(blech, powerpoint, I know...)

Anyway, there are lots of exceptions that permit one to sniff traffic
for specific reasons or in specific situations, but these exceptions
change significantly once you become a public provider.  Once you start
providing access to the general public (and not just your own company or
your family), you have different legal obligations under these laws.
And yes they apply to everyone.

Of course there's not going to be a "crackdown" unless specific people
have complaints about you monitoring things.  However, think of the
silly lawsuits where burglars injure themselves on something while
breaking into your house.  Kinda inane stuff like that can come up.

Not trying to scare anyone away from offering public wifi, but these are
things to think about.  If you get all of your users to agree to all
monitoring, etc for any reason, then you probably don't have to worry
about it.  But of course IANAL... I'm just an investigator who has to
think about this stuff.

tim

I have control over my AP and I use WEP, thought it's not out of choice. 
One peripheral device I own has WEP for encryption and nothing else. I 
would like to replace this device but it's not cheap. Also, for those 
who have kids, the Nintendo DS can't do WPA/2 either, so you're stuck 
with WEP there too if you want to go online with one. My head esplodes 
wondering how Nintendo blew that one.

It's the peripherals. But even those stupid Qwest/actiontec DSL modems 
won't allow you to use a WPA key with a "/" character in it. It locks up 
the modem and it won't reboot unless you do a reset. My neighbors new HP 
wireless printer won't allow special characters in the WPA password 
while setting it up via the USB cable. Haven't tried changing it after 
the fact. Most Linksys devices I've used don't require you to put in a 
user name to log in to the web interface, just the password. Not the 
WAP54G though. I hate the inconsistency with wireless products.

Can you point out the "scary" parts of that document for me?  I read
through the whole thing and 95% of it is a description of rules
applying to criminal investigations and disclosure of private
information to the government.

I read the following without remotely feeling scared:

  http://ilt.eff.org/index.php/Privacy:_Wiretap_Act

Here is the actual law as written:

  http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_119.html

Again, IANAL, but I don't find anything in there particularly scary.
Specifically, look for the phrases: "It shall not be unlawful under
this chapter".

The main lesson, as it relates to the operator of an open wireless
network, seems to be that you should not randomly intercept third
party communications and disclose them.  I personally would not have
been inclined to do that anyway.  Otherwise, as far as I can tell,
there isn't much else to be concerned about.  You can monitor your
network in order to protect it or make sure its working, afaict.
Those tend to be the reasons I run tcpdump.

Message-ID: <483B1DAB.2080705@seitzassoc.com>

I'm running gnucash 2.2.4 on my CentOS 5 machine.  It works fine there 
as a native X app.  I'm also able to use it remotely from my Ubuntu 
laptop with ssh X11 forwarding.  The performance is good, and not 
noticeably different from the local display experience.  However, when 
I try to the same thing from my wife's Macbook, the display is 
painfully slow.  Other ssh forwarded X11 apps seem to display just 
fine on the Macbook.  Does anyone have any idea what might be causing 
the Macbook too be slow in this particular situation?

...

I did a little more searching and discovered that my problem is likely 
related to the X11 Security Extension.  When I connect from the 
Macbook to CentOS with ssh -X, gnucash is slow.  If I use ssh -Y, 
gnucash performance is okay.

If someone knows more about this, I'd be interested in hearing about 
it.  There doesn't seem to be much information on the web regarding this.

thanks,
galen

Subject: [PLUG] printer parallel port magic
Message-ID: <483B8AAC.4070009@pacifier.com>

Hello all:
I am attempting to write a little driver (ppit) that will allow me to 
run some interrupt response tests, but I can't get the printer parallel 
port to work. My driver loads, opens and my write method runs, but I 
don't see anything on the printer port data pins, 2-9.

dmesg shows my printer port to be at:
parport0: PC-style at 0x378, irq 7 [PCSPP,TRISTATE]
lp0: using parport0 (interrupt-driven).
lp0: console ready

Before installing my driver, I
rmmod lp
rmmod parport_pc
rmmod parport


When my driver is installed, my module_init( ppit_init ) code is:
# define BASE 0x378                /* Use first printer port */
static int range          = 3;     /* number of bytes that ppit will 
read from or write to. */


int __init ppit_init(void)
{
       
    unsigned char data = 0;

    ppit_major = 0;
    prs = request_region( BASE, range, "ppit" );
    if( prs )
           printk( KERN_INFO "\nppit_init: Received I/O port address 
0x%x\n", BASE );
    else {
           printk( KERN_INFO "ppit_init: can't get I/O port address 
0x%x\n",BASE );
           return -1;
    }

    /* Create a character device the old way and dynamically get our 
major number. */
    ppit_major = 0;
    res = register_chrdev( ppit_major, "ppit" , &ppit_fops);
    if( ppit_major == 0 )ppit_major = res;
    if( res < 0 ){
           printk( KERN_INFO "ppit: can't  register_chardev()\n");
           goto FAIL;
    }
    printk( KERN_INFO "ppit_init: Dynamically allocated ppit_major == 
%d\n", ppit_major );

    /* Set the data port direction to output. */
    data = ~0x20;
    outb( data, BASE+2 );
    wmb();
    printk( KERN_INFO "ppit_init: outb( 0x%x, 0x%x )\n", data, BASE+2  );


    /* I will install an interrupt handler for int 7 here */

<snip>

When the module initializes, it prints out the following messages:
ppit_init: Received I/O port address 0x378
ppit_init: Dynamically allocated ppit_major == 248

Somewhere I read that parallel port base +2, the control port, needed to
have bit 5 reset to set the direction of a bi-directional data port to out.
The result of the last printk above is:

ppit_init: outb( 0xdf, 0x37a )

In my write method, ppit_write, I write to the BASE (0x378) port as below..

    address = (unsigned)(BASE + ofs);
    outb( data, address );
    wmb();

and then print out the value of data and the address with the following 
line:
    printk( KERN_INFO "ppit_write: I/O port address was 0x%x   data was 
0x%x\n", ofs + BASE, data );

Below is a series of those writes.
ppit_write: I/O port address was 0x378   data was 0x1
ppit_write: I/O port address was 0x378   data was 0x2
ppit_write: I/O port address was 0x378   data was 0x3
ppit_write: I/O port address was 0x378   data was 0x4
ppit_write: I/O port address was 0x378   data was 0x5
ppit_write: I/O port address was 0x378   data was 0x6
ppit_write: I/O port address was 0x378   data was 0x7
ppit_write: I/O port address was 0x378   data was 0x8
ppit_write: I/O port address was 0x378   data was 0x9

My user space program that opens the driver calls write once per second and
writes a incrementing byte to the data port, BASE + 0.

Following is the complete series of init, open and several write calls..

ppit_init: Received I/O port address 0x378
ppit_init: Dynamically allocated ppit_major == 248
ppit_init: outb( 0xdf, 0x37a )
ppit_open:
ppit_write: I/O port address was 0x378   data was 0x1
ppit_write: I/O port address was 0x378   data was 0x2
ppit_write: I/O port address was 0x378   data was 0x3
ppit_write: I/O port address was 0x378   data was 0x4
ppit_write: I/O port address was 0x378   data was 0x5
ppit_write: I/O port address was 0x378   data was 0x6
ppit_write: I/O port address was 0x378   data was 0x7
ppit_write: I/O port address was 0x378   data was 0x8
ppit_write: I/O port address was 0x378   data was 0x9

Nothing is happening on the printer port pins.

I have connected a parallel interface printer on the port, and it works.
I have moved my programs to other mother boards with the same lack of 
results.
What am I missing?

I will be out of town tomorrow, 27 May, so if you ask me a question and 
I don't get back to you right away, that is why.

Thanks.
Wayne

Subject: [PLUG] DNS resolution for blacklisting...
Message-ID: <20080527150818.qeky10f4iss4o40w@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I'm working on a perl script that checks to see if the rcpt from and  
the mail from are resolveable.  If neither of these resolve, the rcpt  
from IP should be blacklisted.  Well, I've run into some questions  
about what resolved should mean.

[michael at eagle block_smtp]$ host aeincgr.com
aeincgr.com mail is handled by 15 mail2.aeincgr.com.
aeincgr.com mail is handled by 5 mail.aeincgr.com.

Look at the latter example here.  There is no A record.  Should I  
consider aeincgr.com resolved?

The following is my dns query script in my perl script I'm working on.  Notice
that only hostnames which produce an A record are considered resolved.

###### dnsquery
#  
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
sub dnsquery
{ # Return 0 if $teststr resolves or has resolved before.
   # Return 1 if $teststr doesn't resolve or it hasn't resolved before.
   # $teststr passed in.

     if ( $PRINT_FUNCTION )
     {
          print FUNCTRACE "dnsquery...\n\n";
     }

     # Make sure $teststr hasn't resolved already before checking it.
     if ( exists $dnsres{$teststr} )
     {
          $dnsres{$teststr}++;

          return 0;
     }

     # Make sure $teststr hasn't failed to resolve already before checking it.
     if ( exists $dnsdnres{teststr} )
     {
          $dnsdnres{$teststr}++;

          return 1;
     }

     use Net::DNS;

     my $res = Net::DNS::Resolver->new;

     my $query = $res->search($teststr);

     if ($query)
     {
         # Add to the dns resolved hash table.
         $dnsres{$teststr} = 1;

         foreach my $rr ($query->answer)
         {
            next unless $rr->type eq "A";
            print $teststr, ": ", $rr->address, "\n";
         }

         return 0;
     }
     else
     {
          # Add to the dns does not resolve hash table.
          $dnsdnres{$teststr} = 1;

          print $teststr, " does not resolve.", "\n";

          return 1;
     }

} # End of dnsquery.

Should I check to see if MX records are returned instead of A records???  What
changes do I need to make to this function to do that???

You probably want to follow the behavor of SMTP as defined in RFC 2821.  I
quote:

    5. Address Resolution and Mail Handling

       Once an SMTP client lexically identifies a domain to which mail will
       be delivered for processing (as described in sections 3.6 and 3.7), a
       DNS lookup MUST be performed to resolve the domain name [22].  The
       names are expected to be fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs):
       mechanisms for inferring FQDNs from partial names or local aliases
       are outside of this specification and, due to a history of problems,
       are generally discouraged.  The lookup first attempts to locate an MX
       record associated with the name.  If a CNAME record is found instead,
       the resulting name is processed as if it were the initial name.  If
       no MX records are found, but an A RR is found, the A RR is treated as
       if it was associated with an implicit MX RR, with a preference of 0,
       pointing to that host.  If one or more MX RRs are found for a given
       name, SMTP systems MUST NOT utilize any A RRs associated with that
       name unless they are located using the MX RRs; the "implicit MX" rule
       above applies only if there are no MX records present.  If MX records
       are present, but none of them are usable, this situation MUST be
       reported as an error.

Hmm, not sure you'd want to bother much with From: addresses in the
body.  If you do, you'd still end up having to accept the full email for
processing (there isn't a way for the server to prematurely quit a DATA
command, is there?) and parsing bodies is typically tricky.

As for envelope from addresses, yes you definitely should be considering
these as real.  Go back through the RFCs and make sure you understand
how a mail server looks up the IP address to forward mail based on a
recipient's domain.  Hint: it doesn't start with an A record lookup.  A
base A (or AAAA) record lookup is a last resort method to get mail to
the destination.  MX records are definitely preferred and you should
honor these.

Of course if you're looking up MX records as you should be, do you now
follow those to ground with A/AAAA lookups?  What if you encounter a
CNAME?  What about lookup loops?  Things could get hairy if someone was
wanting to screw with you.  If it were me, I'd probably just let the
mail through if an MX or A or AAAA record existed for the base domain.

I do still question the overall spam reduction this is going to provide
though...  How much of your spam really comes from nonexistent domains?

good luck,
tim

I have a borrowed Netgear WG511T that works fine in my Thinkpad T61.
Actually I haven't used it for a month because the upgrade to Hardy,
plus installing Linux headers, has gotten the interanal iwl4965agn
working. So far anyway (knocking on wood). I don't know it it will work
with Win98, but I keep trucking it around in my backpack. If you want
to test it with Linux I'll be at PSU tomorrow.

I have no ken of the Ativa or Linksys models you mentioned.

I'm processing my postfix mail log for 554, User unknown in relay
recipient table...  I'm not writing a full blown mail server like
my older brother.  I figure the envelope from address should be
trustworthy and the mail from address really shouldn't be fake.
I'm looking at more than this of course.  I'm looking at the number
of times the mail to address is not one of my retired addresses 
by IP address.  If 3 times the same IP address tries a nonexistent
recipient, I blacklist it.  If 6 times a retired recipient is tried,
I blacklist.

Look at my comments header for the script:
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
#
# Look at the postfix mail log for smtp clients that need to be 5xx
# blocked.
# Specifically, focus on 550 smtp errors where the intended recipient is
# invalid.
#
# Be nice if the invalid recipient was valid once upon a time.
#
# Block anyone who tries to send to an unsupported domain 1 time.
# Block someone who tries to reach a phased out email address 6 times.
# Block someone who tries to reach a never existing email address 3 
# times.
#
# So what is the definition of someone that I should use?
#
#     Someone is an IP address.  You fail to be someone if none of your
#     provided identity information resolves.  Someone doesn't attempt 
#     to
#     reach a non existent recipient that was never phased out more than
#     3 times.  If an IP tries to reach a phased out recipient, that IP
#     get's 6 tries before it gets blacklisted.
#
#     Blacklist if RCPT from address, and mail from domain don't   
#     resolve.
#     No mail relay has any business letting mail through that is
#     totally unidentifiable.
#
#     Blacklist immediately IP that tries to reach a domain that isn't 
#     served.
#
# I hope noone can embed <,>, [, ], or : in their helo name or email 
# address.

The following is my new dnsquery.  I know that Rogan is suggesting
a combined data structure, but my Perl is weak and I understand
simple hashes better than multi level hashes.  I'm debating about
going to the point of checking mail exchangers against the rcpt
from IP address.

###### dnsquery

    if ( $PRINT_FUNCTION )
    {
         print FUNCTRACE "dnsquery...\n\n";
    }

    # Make sure $teststr hasn't resolved already before checking it.
    if ( exists $dnsres{$teststr} )
    {
         $dnsres{$teststr}++;

         return 0;
    }

    # Make sure $teststr hasn't failed to resolve already before 
    # checking it.
    if ( exists $dnsdnres{teststr} )
    {
         $dnsdnres{$teststr}++;

         return 1;
    }

    use Net::DNS;

    my $res = Net::DNS::Resolver->new;

    my $query = $res->search($teststr);

    if ($query)
    {
        # Add to the dns resolved hash table.
        $dnsres{$teststr} = 1;

        if ( $PRINT_DNS )

                print $teststr, ": ", $rr->address, "\n";
             }
        }

        return 0;
    }
    else
    {    # Check for mail exchangers for the domain...
         my @mx = mx($res,$teststr);

         if (@mx)

         }

The purpose of the latter function is to prevent DNS checks when they
don't make sense.  Question is, am I right about the rules for DNS
names?  Are there more rules than this that I can use?

There is a function to update a history file, the main part of the
script, an initialization section for globals, a function to create
and append to a blacklist, and a process_record function.

The following is the main part of the script:
$mailfile="maillog";
$badstr=": Recipient address rejected: User unknown in relay recipient
table";
$TEST_PRINT=0;
$PRINTSEP=1;

# Open the maillog file in read mode.
open ( INDAT, "$mailfile" );

$trouble_line=<INDAT>; # Throw out the header line.

while ($trouble_line=<INDAT>)
{ # Pull from $mailfile all lines that match $badstr into 
  # $trouble_line...

       if ( $PRINT_FUNCTION )
       {
            print FUNCTRACE "MAIN PROGRAM...\n\n";
       }

       if ( $trouble_line=~/\Q$badstr\E/ )
       {    #**********************************************

This main part of the script tokenizes a $badstr so that I
can process it further.  I wrote this script to 80 columns,
but evolution is chopping it up funny when I paste it :-(
Perl's string manipulation power is very useful in this
part.

Message-ID: <483CFD56.6090609@subtend.net>

Trying to install SLES 10.1 SP1 under KVM in Ubuntu 8.04.

The installer DVD iso runs using 'virt-install' via libvertd, but takes
about 4 hours to do a default install (with X/Gnome).  It feels 'no-kvm'ish but
everything shows acceleration working.

After this long install completes, the disk image won't boot and isn't
mountable.

This is my first experimentation with KVM so I'm not familiar with what my
avenues are for troubleshooting yet.

Does "ps aux | grep qemu" show qemu or qemu-kvm running?

I do not have a thinkpad but a dell laptop and
Linksys WPC54G works fine for me.

I have also used E-Home EH103 USB adaptor and that works fine too
(with Ubuntu 7 and 8).  I go through ndiswrapper in both cases.

Message-ID: <4a0b36aa0805281026see7fa30mdc92926fdc3ed5c4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi:

I notice this behavior on my Ubuntu box.  If I ssh into it, steps away for a
while and comes back, the ssh session
would hang.  I added

    ServerAliveInterval 155

to /etc/ssh/ssh_config but it does not see to solve the problem.

Is there another ssh config I can put in so my ssh connections won't hang
after idling for a period of time?

Thanks

That's the setting I've always used (or the deprecated Debian option
that used to do the same thing) to keep connections open when going
through annoying firewalls (like the PIX) and such.  Maybe just try
reducing the interval?

I discovered that using ndiswrapper caused my battery to drain from a
full charge to nothing in less than an hour. That was with Gutsy
x86_64. One of the big deals about Hardy is that it was a stated goal
for the 64-bit version to have the same power management capabilities
as the 32-bit version. Indeed, my screen now darkens after a few
seconds of non-use, where it did not before. There may be other goodies
inside that I have not noticed. So what I'm saying is that ndiswrapper
is frequently a choice, but may produce undesired side effects.

I've had good luck with d-link and linksys PC(MCIA) cards under linux,
in general.  PCI cards have been spottier, in 2001 i had one that
wandered off frequently, but that was a long time ago..

out of curiosity, does anyone else experience occasional instability
with ndiswrapper?  i am extremely impressed with its performance
overall, considering what it is & the amount which i abuse it--i have
a fileserver doing several GByte of traffic a day at minimum that uses
it mostly without issue, but on occasion (3 times in the past 5
months), the irq in use by ndiswrapper goes unserviced for too long
and this happens:

Dec  5 00:06:31 home irq 20: nobody cared (try booting with the
"irqpoll" option)
Dec  5 00:06:31 home <c0125fe3> __report_bad_irq+0x2b/0x69  <c0126192>

Dec  5 00:06:31 home Disabling IRQ #20

and the OS is still running fine, but there's no saving the network
without a reboot (i don't recall what happens when i try to
rmmod/insmod again, but it didn't work).

i have added the irqpoll option to my kernel boot line with no change
in behavior.

i'm using a linksys wmp54gs (PCI card stolen from an old dell docking
laptop docking station).  and it works great except when it doesn't,
which as i mention is rare.

as well, don't forget the TCPKeepAlive yes.  And I just found a
      ClientAliveInterval <seconds>
setting in the man page that might be worth trying, though i've never
needed to solve similar problems.

I had a similar problem with connections getting dropped, not so much
hanging as you describe. In my case it turned out to be a timeout on
some firewall or router between the client and the server. I fixed
this by using login_keepalived on the server end.

Message-ID: <483DCE37.3080109@pacifier.com>

Hello all:
In reference to my earlier post on 26 May..
I discovered what is associated with my problem and was able to get the 
driver running.
If I prevented parport_pc.ko from loading, everything worked fine.

If I allowed parport_pc.ko to load, then unloaded it with "rmmod 
parport_pc",
it appears as though parport_pc leaves the chipset / port in something 
other than it's
pristine boot time state. I have no idea what, and don't have the time 
right now
(and maybe the skill) to chase it down, but if anyone is wanting to 
write a driver for the
printer parallel port using Slackware 12.0, Linux 2.6.22.5, this should 
be helpful.

Subject: [PLUG] [SOT] SonicWALL SOHO2 manual
Message-ID: <483EF253.10805@acm.org>

I've inherited the support of a SonicWALL SOHO2 with no manuals or 
information on how it was configured.  (Heck they don't even know where 
it came from.)   To save them some money I'd like to reuse it -- verses 
put in something new -- (their IP's etc. were changed during a service 
upgrade) and though I've spend the last 1/2 hour searching I can find no 
manuals online or down-loadable for this device.

Anyone know where I can find one or what is the procedure to reset it to 
factory defaults and what those might be.  I'm really hoping there is no 
need for a Windows box to configure it.

Push comes to shove I'll put in something else so I'm accepting 
suggestions on that too.  Small office, < 10, computers but they have 32 
route able IPs and seem inclined to use them.  So something that will 
handle that would be nice.  A device instead of a DIY from spare parts 
is preferred.

So if this isn't vague enough let me know and I'll try and muddy the 
waters a bit more.  :-)

Hello!

Is there anyone who would be willing to lend me an asterisk server for a
window display for next First Thursday June 5th?

Essentially I'd like to have an old school Ma Bell black rotary phone (which
I have) ringing periodically as part of the window display.   No one would
answer the phone so it's all about the ringing.  I thought about just
running an MP3 player nearby but it'd be much nicer in my opinion to
actually get the phone to ring.

Thanks in advance,

ben

   Why not stick the MP3 player in the phone body, or the handset in lieu of
the speaker or microphone?

I feel like it's just a bit different if it actually rings.  There's such a
kinetic element to that clang.

Alas, it's not that simple.  The POTS ring voltage is 90 VAC @ 20 Hz. 
  There are various ways of generating an acceptable signal, but they 
require time and a bit of electronics expertise.  I'm guessing that 
Benjamin is short on both counts.

Benjamin, if you do manage to track down an Asterisk system, I'd 
recommend checking the specs of the line card to be sure it's capable 
of driving a traditional ringer.

  You've never heard of Black Magic?  They've been making potted ring
voltage generators for years.  I used to use them to make 4-wire E&M
to FXS converters.

Those were pretty simple devices actually - if I remember correctly, the 
central office/PBX sent a low voltage DC (5 volt?) charge down the line 
and the bell rang (magnetic clapper type bell) - or isn't your's that 
old (they did make some nostalgic stuff later)?  If it is what I think 
it is, you could just use a timing device to periodically close the 
circuit for the length of time desired for the ring.  One could test the 
theory with DC batteries first - starting with 1.5 volt and working up 
until the desire ring was achieved.  Hope this helps, but even if it 
doesn't, thank you for reminding that such things did exist - memories, 
ya'know.

I'll have to check for sure once I get home but I'm pretty sure this is the
model...

http://cgi.ebay.com/Vintage-Black-Desk-Bell-Western-Electric-Rotary-Phone_W0QQitemZ360056088441QQcategoryZ38038QQcmdZViewItem

It does have a magnetic clanger.

I'd be happy to hoist pints with anyone who could help me out.

Could someone give me a ballpark estimate of how long it would take me to
piece an appropriate asterisk server together myself?  Which digium card /
other FXO solution would I require?

Thanks,

ben

You could just wire it to a real line and post the phone number in as
many public places as possible ;) (say, on the craigslist free
section, with something tantalizing ;).

You wouldn't even have to tweak any software/hardware to get
"realistic" behavior.  I imagine you'd want to arrange to have a
special, disposable, phone # for the event though (say, a pre-paid
cell phone with call forwarding to the classic rotary phone?)

(I didn't intend this to be serious, but it might actually work :)

Top Post ... sorry!  The SonicWall was sitting way up high so I had to 
do some fiddling with chairs and/or ladders but found a RESET button on 
the back.  It doesn't show up too well in the flyers so it took a hint 
from a friend to look there.

But I'm still looking for another firewall appliance because the upgrade 
includes a split of two companies and therefore their internet access. 
Oh yes, Linux based is preferable.  ;-)

here a long shot

a couple months ago I gave the surplus store on Cornelius off HWY26
a Mitel PBX in i was at least on ring generator, I also gave them two
complete sets of documentation ..

as i said a long shot

another is if you just want ring and no battery (i.e. talk circuit)
you should be able to cheat and run 20 cps from an audio osc./function
generator in to a 120V/9V transformer in reverse.

My search on-line turned up this list of devices:
http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT2005548492.html

Of that list, I would pick the Asus device or the linksys device.
On these you would use open-wrt or dd-wrt.

Now if you don't mind doing your own, there are a few projects that I
would recommend.

LEAF http://leaf.sourceforge.net/
IPCOP http://www.ipcop.org/

Thanks Larry.  I was doing some research thinking I'd find something 
without wireless.  I have a Linksys WRT54G (Version 4) with dd-wrt 
installed for wireless access at home but use a Asante firewall 
(Friendly Net?) for my firewall.  I'll look into router/firewall options 
with the dd-wrt some more.  With my last pass through the admin/config 
interface but nothing jumped out at me that screamed "FIREWALL".  It 
works for wireless so I've been able to leave it alone.  No exploring!

As I'm sure you know one of the hazards of doing work under fire is a 
bit of blindness to the obvious.  :-)


Again thanks.

There is also a package called firestarter that installs on most distro that
can be used as firewall.  At one of my companies they just installed
Fedora Core 4 and loaded firestarter to build the firewall.
The then added a vpn tunnel to the home office across the internet and
across the country.

I have a Linksys WRT54G with DD-WRT.

Check the Security tab, there is a sub-tab that says "Firewall".
Is that not what you are looking for?

Yes ... I think. I suppose I was expecting more -- complexity.  But with 
the "Access Restrictions" and "Applications & Gaming" tabs I should get 
what I need.

Obviously I've been dealing with too many fully exposed servers where 
IPTables is the way.

I'll have to check for sure once I get home but I'm pretty sure this is the
model...

http://cgi.ebay.com/Vintage-Black-Desk-Bell-Western-Electric-Rotary-Phone_W0QQitemZ360056088441QQcategoryZ38038QQcmdZViewItem

It does have a magnetic clanger.

I'd be happy to hoist pints with anyone who could help me out.

Could someone give me a ballpark estimate of how long it would take me to
piece an appropriate asterisk server together myself?  Which digium card /
other FXO solution would I require?

Thanks,

ben

  I'm not clear on why you're building an Asterisk server just to ring
a bell?  The Black Magic module from Cambridge Labs is designed to
ring telephone bells.  It take in 12 vdc on one side, and puts out 86
vac @ 20 Hz ring signal on the other.

  You could easily gin up a interrupted ring signal with a Black Magic
module, a scrap PC, a relay, and a small perl script.  See Fig. 13 in
the "Black Magic! Telecom Design Tricks" manual (page 19) for an
example schematic.

Cambridge Labs - Engineering Design Literature
http://www.camblab.com/lit/lit.htm

  You will need an FXS card if you choose to build an Asterisk box.
The FXO interface emulates a telephone.  The FXS interface emulates a
Central Office.  The FXS provides the battery, dial tone, and ring
voltage which is used by the telephone (station).

  Many of the new FXS card (and PBXs) may not be able to drive a old
mechanical ringer.  The new systems don't always provide enough
current to saturate the bell coils.  It would be worth while to
contact the manufacture of the card and verify that it can drive an
official "REN: 1 Bell" Weco-500 style telephone.

Subject: [PLUG] lisp: coerce string to real
Message-ID: <18497.38425.75901.295398@localhost.localdomain>

Any lispers out there (attn. Russ) who know a good way to coerce a
string (it's a given that the string is a representation of a legal
real value) to a real?  Common lisp provides (parse-integer) only.  I
think the following algorithm would work:

- split the string on the decimal point

- (parse-integer) the absolute value of the whole portion

- (parse-integer) the fractional portion

- divide that by the power of 10 that matches the number of decimal
  places to the right of the decimal point

- add that to the whole portion

- apply the sign of the original number

Is there a better way?

Never mind, got 'er:

(defun cast-float (string-rep)
  "Tries to return the float representation of `string-rep'.  If
`string-rep' cannot be parsed as a float, returns `nil'."
  (let ((read-value (read-from-string string-rep)))
    (cond ((floatp read-value) read-value)
          ((integerp read-value) (float read-value))
          (t nil))))
