The gzip package (at least in debian) comes with all sorts of goodies:
/bin/zdiff
/bin/zgrep
/bin/zforce
/bin/zless
/bin/zmore
/bin/znew
/bin/zcat
/bin/zcmp
/bin/zegrep
/bin/zfgrep

Which operate on compressed, gzip'd, or uncompressed/ungzip'd files.

Another not-quite-as-elegant solution is to use percentages for the
size; just remember the whole CSS nesting thing; 100% -> 80% -> 80%
probably isn't what you want.

Yeah, it does ... my statement meant to imply that I'd tried it, but I 
wasn't very clear.  When you said "emacs," I thought, well then it 
should work with vim also.  I was presuming you meant emacs the text 
editor and not emacs the email client/newsreader/operating 
system/religious cult. :-)

But I didn't know about "zcat" nor the other "z-" commands Paul 
mentioned in his follow-up.  I had seen something about zcat in the gzip 
man page, but I really didn't understand what it was talking about, how 
to use it, or why it was useful.  Now that I can access all these docs, 
maybe I can learn more of these little details.

Thanks (and to Paul, also)

And you would have read all about nice host-based firewall builders in the 
link I posted. :) Lokkit (or gnome-lokkit for a nicer GUI) is probably the 
simplest and easiest to use.

Subject: [PLUG] Dumb DNS Question?
Message-ID: <4405635F.23298.29750AF7@localhost>

OK, I think it's a DNS problem, but maybe it's something else. In 
any event, I can't figure out the answer.

On my Ubuntu-64 Breezy laptop I use Sylpheed for e-mail. I have it 
set to leave e-mail on the servers because I want to use my 
desktop at home as the place to archive messages. It happily 
checks the servers for my three e-mail accounts whenever I tell it 
to. I can also send e-mail just fine -- except when I am at PSU. 
That's the problem that I can't figure out. Why should it send and 
receive just fine at home, but at PSU it can only receive? 
Everything else works just fine at PSU -- Firefox, etc. When I try to 
send an e-mail the little dialog box just sits there and says 
"connecting to <servername>," but it never connects. It would sit 
there for half an hour if I let it. The program is not hung -- I can tell it 
to stop trying and just tell it to "send later." That puts the e-mails in 
its queue. When I get home I just click on "send all" and it 
promptly sends the messages that it couldn't send from PSU. And 
this happens exactly the same with all three accounts.

I can use Firefox to log into my Comcast account and send the e-
mail with the browser. Or I can send an e-mail from my pdx.edu 
account, also with Firefox. It just seems strange that Sylpheed 
can't send, when everything else has no problem going out. Does 
pub.net discriminate against Sylpheed? And since Sylpheed can 
send without any problem from home, obviously I must have the 
account and passwords set right.

This is probably one of those dumb things that will make me slap 
myself on the forehead as soon as I figure it out. But right now it 
makes no sense at all. Does anyone have any idea why this is 
happening?

Your PSU account likely uses a different host for SMTP than it does
for POP3/IMAP.

They are probably blocking or restricting any outbound SMTP access at
the firewall.

Message-ID: <1141234300.7739.11.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Oh, I totally do!

I am printing to a Laserjet 5SiMx and to a Laserjet 8000 DN. Both are
pretty well decked out with 2000 sheet bottom tray, duplexers, and the
8000 has a 3000 sheet stacker. I am printing from Ubuntu-64 Breezy.

The problem is that options available on the printer do not appear in
the print dialog boxes. Now, this *may* be a problem of the application
rather than the driver. 

      Depends on the application and whether it's CUPS enabled or not.

But I don't know enough about how these things are supposed to work to
be able to figure out the answer to that question. However, I can say
that printing from Adobe Reader 7.0 is the worst. I can't even select
the number of copies, let alone duplexing, paper trays, or anything
else. 
	See above.

Totally pathetic. OpenOffice.org is much better, but still doesn't know
about input and output trays or any of the dozens of other options that
are available when I print from Windows 2000 -- and I mean from *any*
Windows 2000 app I get the same full list of options.

Si I don't know if the problem is the driver, Linux, the app, or an evil
spirit. Do you know anything about these issues?

	Yeah. How did you go about setting up the printer(s)? You may need
newer PPD files which will have all that information and make sure you
are printing postscript as well.

Lokkit!  That's what I couldn't remember (and was too lazy to find). 
Also, my apologies for not reading the entire thread, especially since

   I use a small, black keyboard; it's the best one I've ever used in 20+
years with microcomputers. But, my heavy use of joe and emacs means that the
white key labels are worn away on the left side; e's completely gone and a,
s, d, f, c, and v are hanging on by their fingernails. This is the second
time I've worn them off, but this time I'd like replacement labels.

   Is there a local source for these white keyboard labels? If not, is anyone
familiar with a mail order source?

Is Sylpheed configured to send outgoing e-mails to a Comast SMTP
server? Can it be configured to send through a PSU SMTP server
instead (or better, a different SMTP server for each account it's set
up for).

Comcast probably has their SMTP servers set up to not accept (without
authentication, at least) incoming connections from IP addresses
outside of a Comcast-controlled network. In other words, when you're
connected to your home network, the Comcast SMTP servers sees you
connecting from the IP address associated with your cable modem. When
you're connected via PSU's PubNet, the Comcast SMTP server sees a
"foreign" IP address, and either ignores your connection request
entirely, or waits for some form of authentication. IIRC, back in the
old days POP3 auth was used as a method of authenticating a host
attempting to connect to the SMTP server. Odd, but I guess it worked.

You might want to check with Comcast to see what they have to say
about sending mail through their servers when you're not connected to
their network.

> Does pub.net discriminate against Sylpheed?

That could be it, too. Have you tried reading your e-mail with emacs
or 'mail'?

I know I have the latest PPD, because I remember going 
someplace to get it and noting that it was labeled as the last one 
for these printers. I just did a search from root and this is what I 
found:

/usr/share/cups/model/HP8000_6.PPD  2005-12-05
/usr/share/cups/model/HP8000_7.PPD  2005-12-20
/usr/share/cups/model/HPLJ5SIM.PPD  2005-12-20

As for how the printers are installed, I just did it via the GUI. But I'm 
almost positive that the GUI uses CUPS, plus the PPDs appear to 
be the right folder for CUPS (above). How can I tell for sure?

And assuming that I did install via CUPS, why would 
OpenOffice.org not be CUPS enabled? As powerful as OO.o is, it 
seems kind of unlikely that it wouldn't be CUPS enabled. But 
again. how can I tell?

Hurray! HP and Samsung are the only printer vendors, as far as i know, that 
blatantly support Linux. HP even has this nice page showing which printers 
and multi-function devices have Linux drivers:

http://h10018.www1.hp.com/wwsolutions/linux/products/printing_imaging/index.html

Samsung also makes it easy to find supported printers.

Each of the three accounts sends through that account's SMTP 
server.

Possibly true, except I had problems configuring Sylpheed for the 
Comcast account. Problem was that I had a typo in the password. 
Even so, I could send, I just couldn't receive. In the troubleshooting 
(before figuring out it was just a dumb-ass typing problem) I 
discovered that Comcast does not do any checking for passwords 
on sending. Still, it's possible that they check to see if it is coming 
from a Comcast user. However, that doesn't explain why the other 
two accounts also can't send. One is Hotpop and the other is a 
business account for a domain that I own, hosted at pairNetworks.

That sounds like exactly what is happening. But why would they do 
this? Admittedly I know next to zero about security stuff and 
probably less about e-mail, but that means no students will ever be 
able to send e-mails except via web-based accounts, right? 

I will be there in a couple hours. Maybe I'll go downstairs in Smith 
and ask someone.

No. You can send email if you configure a PSU server as your SMTP 
server, using your login credentials. Alternatively, you can use port 
587 (submission) or 465 (SMTP SSL) if comcast supports it.

I thought we covered this once before? :)
Briefly, PSU blocks outgoing port 25 connections to stop 
spammers/students from sending spam. Intentional or not, it was a huge 
problem that had to be dealt with.. that's what happens when you let the 
public connect to a network. (wireless, library, resnet, etc)
Not to mention infected boxes..

I've used firestarter and it works very well.  The only problem, that I
have seen is that it does require some management, as it has a tendency
to be a bit agressive.  The learning curve isn't great but it will take
a little effort to get working.

OK. Now I have to translate that into Computer Dumb-Ass, a 
language which apparently I am the only one who speaks. :(

But there is one additional question that just occurred to me. At 
the point where I am trying to send e-mail I am already logged in. I 
mean, I had to log in with my student ID and password or NoCat 
wouldn't let me in, right? So evidently I'll have to log in again? How 
does that solve the problem with spammers, etc.?

You authenticated to nocat to get network access.
Now, any other resource you want will require authentication too.

Basically what I'm saying is that you have to comfigure your email 
client to either send via PSU (then we'd have logs saying who spammed) 
or you can use "submission" ports for non-PSU servers that mail servers 
don't accept mail on (except from it's own users). So, if spammers can't 
connect to port 25 of e.g. yahoo.com, they can't send email. This is 
harder to explain than I thought :)

So, to "fix" your problem, you how two choices:
Configure your email client to send email (SMTP server in the config) 
using port 587 with authentication. Thunderbird actually has a "TLS" 
option, which provides encryption and authentication. You'll be able to 
specify either server in the config, and it should work from both places 
(IF comcast supports this).

Or, you can configure two SMTP servers and use the comcast one when 
you're at home, the PSU one when you're at PSU.

I would suggest sending all email through PSU. (i.e. change your setup 
so that you use PSU's SMTP server, port 587, with TLS)
You can still send email "From:" whatever you want.. so your comcast 
account will still function the same. It just gets relayed through PSU 
instead of comcast. Does that make sense?
See: http://www.uss.pdx.edu/bin/article.php?article=343700
And there's more documentation about email services there too.

BTW, do you have any fast n easy way of identifying un-chipped printers? I 
hate those damn things, they claim you're out of toner when you're not, and 
don't let you refill cartridges unless you can find a chip-resetter 
somewheres.

Why?  You're a good enough typist to find the keys without their labels. The wear
doesn't indicate lack of care for the keyboard.  Your fingers don't care about the
lables.

Truly puzzled.

side story:  When working retail I had a custmer come in who owned a court
reporting business.  All of her employees typed 120wpm+.  She only bought
Northgate keyboards. Not because of the sturdiness, there were a couple of other
options for that.  Northgate was the only manufacturer who made keycaps that had
the letters go through the whole key, rather than just being a this plastic (or
whatever) layer on top.

I asked her the same question.  None of her employees needed the printed keycaps,
why did she insist on the only keyboard that wouldn't wear out?

She just liked the orderly look.

Rich,
You might try our friends at FeeeGeek - they get pretty much all kinds 
of everything coming in their door.  Other than that, it's the usual 
Google search for whatever kind of keyboard you have.

I must note that despite missing many characters on your keycaps your 
messages are pretty clear and easy to read.

How necessary are keylabels if you're just going to wear them off again?

Hey Rich, don't you love it when geeks cover up their lack of an answer by 
questioning your question? :) 

I bought these a few months ago:

They're cheap but they get the job done.

For anyone who is thinking "ew, I need a Mac to do digital photo editing", I 
won't try to talk you out of it. Macs are very nice. But for anyone who might 
be wondering if Linux is up to the task of organizing and editing digital 
photos, and creating Web galleries, and all those fun things, the answer is 
yes. This O'Reilly blog gives a brief overview:

Jesus guys, he just wants some new labels for his keyboard..

Unfortunately I don't have first-hand knowledge of a local or online
source but a google search for "keyboard labels" turned up plenty of
places that sell them, including white printing on a clear substrate for
your black keyboard.

   Thanks, Carla. I'll call and find out if they have white-on-black, too.

Brent,

   Thank you. I was going to search on-line, but if someone knew of a local
source that would be more convenient.

   Sigh. It's one of those days, I see.

 "Of course this required a new video card, so I got a deal on a eVGA
 NVIDIA GeForce FX 5500 256 MB AGP, which packs more horsepower than my
 first three PCs. Yes, I know that PCI-E is teh hawt, but my mobo does
 not support it. This card has wonderful 2D performance with the native

I have a similar machine, and I was about to complain about poor 2D

is that the slowness is apparently due to gnome terminal(version 2.7.3).

   I found a place that prints the characters on the underside of the plastic
label. That should slow down the rate I go through these things.

   If anyone's interested, the keyboard is an Adesso ACK-595 mini, black with
white labels. It's just about the size of a notebook keyboard, and the only
strange placement is the tilde -- it's immediately to the left of the space
bar. But, it leaves me plenty of room on my desk, has a great feel, ... but
just keeps spelling words incorrectly! I like it. Those who prefer GUIS and
use the mouse more than the keyboard probably will never notice the
difference.

This is a known consequence of running a gnome-terminal, there are at
least a couple projects (Darcs, is one, iirc.) that recommend not
using gnome terminals to do the compilation because it puts such a
tight bottleneck on the output, and can *greatly* increase the time
needed to build the project.

I'm a fan of rxvt still; rxvt-unicode for Unicode output.  GNOME 2.14,
however, is supposed to have a much faster gnome-terminal:

Wayne,
I'd suggest having a good look at django (http://www.djangoproject.com). It's a 
very nice solution for getting things started and provides a lot of benefits. 
Finding an ISP that hosts it should not be difficult.  Let me know if you have 
any problems there.

django is done in Python and PostgreSQL (preferred) or others (not worth 
mentioning).  It will get you a long way up the road right out of the box.

That will take care of your platform needs, then you need to learn HTML and CSS. 
  You've already seen a lot of links to those.

Happy Trails!

Message-ID: <20060302001725.GA8605@gate.kl-ic.com>


By some miracle, the folks that schedule Penguicon and Linuxfest have
not scheduled on top of each other this year, so rich/idle folks can
go to both!

Penguicon is a Detroit MI area combination of science fiction and Linux
convention.  Three days of frolic and hacking.  I attended Penguicon 1
in 2003, and had a good time.  At the pre-con Geeks With Guns activity,
I watched Eric Raymond teach Guest-Of-Honor Terry Pratchett how to
shoot a pistol.  Late nights spent yacking about software and alternate
universes (but I repeat myself) with midwest notables from both fan groups.

Penguicon 4 will be in Livonia, Michigan (About 20 mi west of Detroit)
on April 21-23 2006.  Website: http://www.penguicon.org   There is no
firm programming schedule yet, though there are many ideas on the wiki.

LinuxFestNW is scheduled for the next weekend, on Saturday April 29
at Bellingham Technical College .  http://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org .
They have less information about this year's event on their website,
but the past Fests have been fantastic.  I plan to present a talk
about using an offsite virtual linux machine as an outward facing
server.  I hope to have the talk ready in time for either the April
6 General PLUG meeting or the April 19 Advanced Topics meeting,
so PLUGgers will only have to choose among 7 other topics during
my time slot up north.

Message-ID: <20060302003306.GB8605@gate.kl-ic.com>


iptables rules are complex, and usually the only way to test them
is to "go live" with them.  Are there any good offline parsers or
simulators for iptables rulesets? 

Ideally, it would be a tool that could read in the rulesets, and
a script to generate ip packets on various simulated interfaces,
then display them traversing the rules.

I did find one simulator, nfsim, that can do some of this, but it
is targeted at kernel code developers, and a little less flexible
for setting up oddball interfaces.  

I suppose if there are no such tester/simulators, somebody could
write one (perhaps a mangled version of nfsim) and put it up on
a pay-per-view web page, and make a little money.

Assuming you have a test box or two  . . . 

Load up your iptables rules on one, *
set up another configured to treat #1 as the gateway
use Netcat
or  nemisis
or  ip sorcery
or  _____ to generate traffic

view the logs to see if it's doing what you want.

You authenticated to nocat to get network access.
Now, any other resource you want will require authentication too.

Basically what I'm saying is that you have to comfigure your email 
client to either send via PSU (then we'd have logs saying who spammed) 
or you can use "submission" ports for non-PSU servers that mail servers 
don't accept mail on (except from it's own users). So, if spammers can't 
connect to port 25 of e.g. yahoo.com, they can't send email. This is 
harder to explain than I thought :)

So, to "fix" your problem, you how two choices:
Configure your email client to send email (SMTP server in the config) 
using port 587 with authentication. Thunderbird actually has a "TLS" 
option, which provides encryption and authentication. You'll be able to 
specify either server in the config, and it should work from both places 
(IF comcast supports this).

Or, you can configure two SMTP servers and use the comcast one when 
you're at home, the PSU one when you're at PSU.

I would suggest sending all email through PSU. (i.e. change your setup 
so that you use PSU's SMTP server, port 587, with TLS)
You can still send email "From:" whatever you want.. so your comcast 
account will still function the same. It just gets relayed through PSU 
instead of comcast. Does that make sense?
See: http://www.uss.pdx.edu/bin/article.php?article=343700
And there's more documentation about email services there too.

Samsung does fairly well by Linux, too:

I don't know of any DHCP server/client that supports this.
I also don't know of any email clients that have the ability to lookup 
which SMTP server to use (presumably this would be stored in a file 
somewhere?).

Dremel. Enamel paint. Etch letters into keys with dremel, fill letters  
with paint, letter labels will last longer?

And of course, there's the much less geeky:
<http://www.google.com/search?q=Keyboard+labels>
but maybe kick it up a notch:
<http://www.hooleon.com/miva/merchant.mvc? 
Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=KBH&Category_Code=OV-D>
So more keys will wear out based on the layout (Qwerty vs Dvorak) used?

Not a dumb question.  However, I think it makes more sense to promote
authenticated smtp than create a new architecture for dynamic smtp
assignment.  Since most email users these days use a pop3 or imap
server to retrieve mail from an ISP, from a user perspective it makes
more sense to use the same credentials as the pop3/imap account to
authenticate to smtp.

Or just use a web interface like me :-)

How do you suppose really large organizations with mobile people solve this
when those people show up at various locations around the world?
Or for that matter people from their business partners who visit.
I just assumed that DHCP/DNS would provide all the information to let them
do things like email, etc.
Anyone out there have experience wrestling with such problems?

Red Hat lets you create profiles for storing different settings for different 
networks, and the Netenv utility works on all Linuxes, though I'm not sure if 
it's maintained. KDE also has a network profile manager. Which is not as easy 
as logging into a new network and having everything setup for you, which 
would be lovely.

My encounter with Samsung linux drivers was not so
memorable, it involved binary drivers and if I remember
correctly their installation script overwrote some of my
configuration files. The printer was an SCX-4016 which
I eventually had to hook to a Windows machine and use
Samba.

On the other hand I have never had trouble printing to any HP printers.

We're missing my point here.
I bet the RH and various distro's don't automatically configure 
thunderbird/<client of choice> for you.. right? "SMTP server" isn't 
something like resolv.conf or your default route:)

People from large companies typically use a VPN connection to connect
to their corporate network remotely, and then use the same smtp
settings they always use.

Subject: [PLUG] Cheesy Postgrey/Mailman whitelist hack
Message-ID: <20060302063336.GA10763@gate.kl-ic.com>


A couple of weeks ago, I proposed a way to whitelist email addresses
for real people that were being stopped by Postgrey.  That method
involved a special webpage where folks could enter their email
address, and get added to the whitelist.  I've been ruminating on
that, and all the good feedback I got from the PLUG list.

I thought of an easier hack.  There are five Mailman mailing lists on
my server;  the folks that are using the mailing lists might also
encounter Postgrey problems.  The Mailman administration command
"list_members <group>" emits the email addresses of all the folks
that are on mail list "group".  So instead of constructing an
ad-hoc kludge based on a web page,  I hope to use Mailman as an
address entry engine instead.  

I have created a new mailman list named "allow".  Folks having
problems getting through Postgrey can sign up for this zero-traffic
moderated list.  Any time a person signs up for the allow list, as
well as at a time specified by cron, this triggers an email to
user "allow" which kicks off a script that runs list_members for
all the groups and builds a new whitelist for Postgrey.  

This Mailman based-approach is easier and probably more secure than
trusting my own ability to construct a webpage and authenticate
an address.  This approach whitelists all the members of the real
mailing lists, too.  I have not had problems with bad guys signing
up for Mailman (so far), and Mailman has methods for blacklisting
the bad guys.  If Mailman starts being abused by the black hats,
new versions will rapidly close those holes.  

Suggestions?

I can't believe they haven't fixed that yet!  As little as two years 
ago, various networks were starting to dump mail coming from some 
Comcast IP ranges because Comcast-sourced spam was such a huge problem, 
precisely because Comcast didn't require authentication.  USENET support 
groups were filled with questions and complaints from people about why 
they weren't getting email from their friends on Comcast.  But I thought 
Comcast finally got its act together, at least back east.

IPv6 is here, but it doesn't work for me under Debian.  I had to turn it 
off completely in order to use Firefox, Mozilla and Ephiphany. 
Konqueror, however, worked fine, but I think the version I was using was 
not IPv6-enabled.  Also, w3m worked when invoked with the "-4" (IPv4 
only) option.  Otherwise, it would time out like the others.

But I don't know about the new hardware requirement.  My machine, a 
flat-panel iMac, is (IIRC) five years old, or four at the least.  IPv6 
works fine under OS X, using both Safari and Camino.  Maybe you were 
referring to routers or modems?

And that is why I won't buy another HP printer that has a chip.

Canon inkjets are a dream to refill. (Haven't used one on Linux yet.)
Just got a Samsung laser because of Linux compatibility. Will return it if 
any hint of a chip.

Not that I know of.  ipchains used to have a '-C / --check' option,
where you could specify packet parameters and test against an existing
chain, but iptables seems to have dropped that.  It's rather too bad; a
complex state-machine like Netfilter is easy to get wrong and when it is
wrong it can be very badly wrong.

dhcpd-options(5) has:
       option smtp-server ip-address [, ip-address... ];

          The SMTP server option specifies a list of SMTP servers available to
          the client.  Servers should be listed in order of preference.

So, ISC DHCPD supports it and I would presume dhclient's script could do
something useful with it (update a local MTA, perhaps?).  But that's a
long way from "plug-and-play"...

Message-ID: <20060302174631.GN16144@syrinxpc.com>

I was checking my calendar, and I noticed that the April 16 Linux Clinic
falls on Easter Sunday.

I personally have no plans that'd keep me from running the Clinic that
day, however I suspect that many other potential attendees will have
other plans that day.

Is that true?

If so, any problem with moving it to Sunday April 23?

Thanks,

And this is necessary for a LAN???  All you have to do is acquire
an ipx to ip gateway program if you MUST cross a public network.

Using iptables -A INPUT -j LOG --log-prefix="...: " seems to help.  
Except for one major headache on my Fedora Core 3 system, undesired 
logging to the console.  Nothing like trying to vim in one Xterm 
while you watch /var/log/messages on another only to have the 
messages muddy up your editing window.  I could use good 
documentation on how to prevent logging to the screen for 
Redhat and Fedora systems.  I don't know if this happens a lot 
because of bugs or if there is a simple change that can be done 
to syslog.conf.  Maybe the kernel logger is to blame, but where 
is the kernel logger's config file???  This problem doesn't seem
to really be distro specific.

Ahh, but there may be good reason not to.  Do I want to do personal
correspondence through my boss'es server even if I am not too inclined
to worry about him eavesdropping?  If nothing else, it could be said
that personal emails crossing a corporate network are in bad taste
during any time of the day or night.

The idea of dhcp handing out smtp server settings makes sense.  After
all, why isn't there a standard service to dynamically set that up?
For that matter, why isn't there a fall back web server dns record 
like the MX record?  Maybe it could be called WS, for web server.

A possible solution is a new standard mail protocol that abstracts 
which smtp server you use and whether pop or imap is called for
to ensure that these things are controlled on the server side.
Web mail sites sort of do this, but not everyone likes webmail.
Specifically there are many detractors who notice that mailto:
tags in html pages try to access a local mail program...  A very
simple mail client that sends say a "do I encrypt?" message to a 
server looked up via a special DNS record should be able to work 
quite nicely.  

Seemless integrations suggests that you don't run into problems 
with middleware.  If you can get Windows, or even Linux, to open 
a web browser and start a webmail session when you click on a 
mailto: shortcut in an html document, that would make web mail 
far more palatable.  If imap worked the same way for every imap 
client that accesses the same imap server, this would help as 
well.

Authenticating who sends email through PSU servers and requiring that it
be encrypted, doesn't this smack of censorship and a pointless approach
to spam control?  How many people are afraid of being identified?  Even
if you are identified, how much can PSU do about it considering the 
first amendment?  Maintaining an advanced environment that requires 
people to possess intimate knowledge to use it efficiently, especially 
in a large University where it's easy to get lost in the crowd, doesn't
strike me as particularly conducive to productivity or learning.  Since
when are college students professionals that are comfortable with 
sophisticated environments?  Maybe this makes sense for PSU where 
the average student is probably over 30.

What's up with the EPSON CX4600 printer/scanner/card reader and Linux?  
Couldn't find a stable full featured driver for Fedora Core 3.  
There is http://www.linuxprinting.org/.  When I tried to get my dad 
to buy a Linux compatible HP Printer/Fax/Copier/Scanner, he just 
ignored me and blew off all of my suggestions.  I don't know of 
any multifunction device as functional as the latter mentioned 
one that works well with Linux, period.  It seems Linux advocates 
are stuck buying seperate scanner, printer, copier, fax modem, etc.

Someone needs to mass produce competitive multi function 
printer/copier devices that are designed for Linux in the 
first place to replace the Windows/Mac only garbage that 
is so prevalent these days.

If you just follow the three line masquerading trick and turn on forwarding,
you're mistaken if you think you are firewalled properly.

Well, let me rephrase, then.  Sure, IPX might be a decent protocol...
but the fact that it isn't globally routable makes it worthless as a
true IP competitor.

And you can't just willy-nilly translate from IPX to IP... what most of
those "IPX gateway" programs do is just create tunnels over which IPX
can run free.  Only really for old games, at that...

No, that's just being a good netizen.  The authentication only goes so
far as to say "yes, I will relay emails for you because I know who you
are."  An alternative is to hit an SMTP server on a different port - the
fact that it's encrypted is only a bonus.

How would requiring SMTP traffic be encrypted (harder for prying eyes to
see) even be near censorship?

What ARE you smoking today, Michael?

I don't know about most Samsung printers, but they do have great
support for some.  I bought a Samsung ML-2010  B&W laser printer. 
It is small (about 14x16 footprint) and cheap ($60 after rebate). 
The toner cartridge does not appear to be "chipped".  It is a USB
"winprinter", but it came with Linux drivers, and a GUI installer
for them, as well as a few pages of the skimpy printed manual
devoted to Linux.  There are also ML-2010 drivers on the web. 

Since I *don't like* manufacturer installers (they usually don't
play well with RPM or hardware management systems like SUSE YAST),
I used open source drivers from the web.  These work fine.

If you need a small and inexpensive B&W laser printer, you should
consider the Samsung.  If you are satisfied with it, a nice thank
you letter to Samsung, mentioning that you are using it with Linux,
will probably encourage them to keep providing Linux support.

I like HP printers better, of course, but they are expensive,
and for the application above, too large.  I have 3 old HP4M+
postscript printers (2 running, one for parts) in places where
I have the space, and in spite of their age they work great. 
At some point, I may purchase an HP color laser, someday, after
my old Tektronix Phaser 350 postscript crayon printer breaks. 
(This from the guy that kept his old Subaru running for 24
years, and is typing this on a Redhat 9 laptop)

Is there a list online of what printers use chipped toners, 
and which do not?

I am able to attend the Linux Clinic on April 23rd if that is the date

I have just done a fresh FC4 load and was starting the process of getting
updates.
Up2date asked if it should down load the PGP signature, to which I answered
yes.

BAD mistake.  Now every update complains that there is no signature on the
update.
How do I turn off the signature requirement??

Look in /etc/sysconfig/rhn/

Why are you using up2date?  Yum does a better job.

I had the same problem. Under KDE, go to System Settings->Red Hat Network Configuration (or just run /usr/bin/up2date-config from the cmd line). On the Retrieval/Installation tab, uncheck "Use GPG to verify package integrity."

Colorado company called 'raindance'. The format of their streams is .rmv, and
their techie says they support only IE and safari, but their 'light' version
is a java applet that _should_ work in any browser.

   Has anyone any experience with this Microsoft format?

   It may be possible for me to listen to the live audio stream even though I
cannot download their app to try the demo or view/listen to previous

   I cannot wait for the world to accommodate open data format standards.

I just set up a second network on two linux boxes and I'm seeing odd

directly connected with a crossover and are both on eth1 and have IP's 
of 192.168.1.108/109.  When I try to ping from 109 to 108 I get this 
returned:

When I try to ping from 108 to 109 it just hangs.  Doesn't do anything. 

Thoughts?  I never seen a return like this.  Both machines have another 
nic card in them and is working correctly. 

Thanks,

Hi,

Any recommendations or warnings on USB drives, 20GB or more?

To boot Linux do I need anything more than a BIOS supporting USB as the 
boot device and a distribution with USB support?

ENU doesn't stock them. Any recommendations that are not Fryed?

Any other questions I should be asking?

TIA and cheers to all,
Mike

If you value gold rather than GB, check this out:

But to answer your question, IMHO they all work.. and just stay away

Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, will introduce new legislation today that
would prohibit Internet network operators from charging companies for faster
delivery of their content to consumers or favoring some content providers over
others.

I use a USB/Fireware case for laptop drives. Works very well.  I picked it 
up at Pacific Solutions.  I think it was $35 without the drive.  (Might be 
wrong on that price. It was a while ago.)

I don't know about booting from a USB drive, but I found a 60 GB pocket drive brand new in the box on eBay for about $100. Works great as a backup destination. I can stick it in my shirt pocket if I want to take it with me, or at home I can store it in a fireproof file cabinet. There are a number of eBay "stores" that specialize in those things, which is where I found mine.

Anyone looked at their mail logs when sending to a yahoo account?

My sister moved to them a few months ago and though we do our emailing 
in flurries I've sent her a couple since the move but haven't heard 
back.  Neither required a reply but I've got snail mail with no mention 
of the messages.

So ... I looked at my logs from last week and see two entrys for my 
email to her.  One a status=deferred -- Resource unavailable. then 20

   I know they can customize their reply ( I've done it on a few systems

Define "doesn't work". Though it isn't fully supported, a lot of Debian
is fine with IPv6. Some programs do need recompilation to enable IPv6
support. Multiple folks are filing non-wishlist bugs against packages
which fail to support IPv6.

Note that your ISP does need to support IPv6, or you need a tunnel to get
to IPv6 sites.

How many routers actually do IP in hardware? Even Cisco routers which
were designed to do IPv4 in hardware, can do IPv6 in hardware though it
took them a long time to implement.

You could try running ethereal on the interface to see how it decodes

similar, but I didn't see a reply.  Might try different NICs.

Y'know, I picked up a 300GB external Seagate drive for around $150 after
rebate the other day.  It was at Fry's, I know... but the deal was a
good one.  :-)

It feels to me like the huge (*huge*) vfat partition slows things down
sometimes, and I wouldn't want to really run a desktop OS off of it, but
the thing is GREAT for backups and such.

As far as I can tell, HP has no Linux support for any of
their scanners. I'm talking new scanners - something you

IPX _is_ globally routable. You just need an IPX-based global network.
The reason why IPX is not suitable for a network the size of the
Internet is because packets can't cross more than 15 routers or hops.
The IPX equivalent of the IP TTL is a 4-bit counter - unless Novell
changed that in a recent decade. :-)

There were at least three real (not tunnels) IPX/IP gateways back in
the 1990s. I don't remember if any of them were Open Source - probably
not.

It is routable, but there's no standardization to say your network won't
use the same addresses my network uses...

How can you route from IPX to IP, exactly, though?

That doesn't quite jive in my head.  :-)

I don't see any reason why not.  As mine is going back and forth between

I wanted one of those super-small and lightweight USB scanners so I could take it to the university with me if necessary. I can't remember where I found it -- Xsane website maybe -- but there is a web page somewhere that lists just about every scanner out there complete with how it works in Linux. I ended up getting a Canon LiDE 30 for under $100 on eBay and it is perfect, albeit kind of slow. Weighs just a few pounds and the color even matches my computer. Every feature is completely supported and works great with Xsane. I just plug it in, fire up Xsane, and scan away. But watch out -- the LiDE 30 is the model from like two years ago and it is the last of the line that work with Linux. Canon changed something deep inside the later models and none of them work with Linux.

As for HP, they used to make pretty good scanners, although never cutting edge. Nevertheless, reliable and well supported. I have an ancient IIcx on my desktop and in spite of its age it still works fine. But under the previous r?gime the decision was made to come out with new models every few months in order to boost sales, even though the only change was a different paint job. In the process, quality sank. And support pretty much disappeared also. I'd look elsewhere today.

Until then, there is Kinko's, which to open source people is somewhat
like whorehouses are to married men.  Libraries are also usually 
infected with windoze, too, but are often overly restricted on what
runs there.

I suspect another thing that screws up these weird media players are
strict Linux firewalls.  Ah, for the simpler (and imaginary) times
when you could design a protocol without worrying about security.

There are a lot of .rmv presentations out there, hopefully you can
find one to practice on. Guy Kawasaki does a lot of Raindance stuff,
and he's entertaining.

Got it working. At home it takes longer to send than it used to, 
because it has to connect to mailhosts.pdx.edu now, and 
mailhosts.pdx.edu sometimes doesn't respond very fast. But no big 
deal. At least now I can send from anywhere without having to 
make changes in Sylpheed.

Thanks to all who helped me figure it out.

Yeah, aside from the few exceptions (ahem, olympus camera that announces 
"I'm a shovel") the usb mass-storage protocol is pretty much just the 
usb hardware saying "there's something that behaves like a block device 
at the end of this cable" and the kernel assigns it the next random 
scsi id and away you go.  That means fdisk /dev/sda, 
mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda1, etc should give you no grief.  Maybe not the case 
on ipods if you want it to continue being an ipod, but drives are 
drives.  As for the backup button and such, that's a different beast 
(is there a hub in the box?) but if you can mount it as vfat on linux, 
you can reformat it.

"Doesn't work" as in the apps I mentioned above will not load any 
websites; instead, they'd time out.  For example, doing:

:$ w3m http://www.google.com

would not load Google.  It would sit there trying to open a socket until 
it finally timed out.  But when I did:

:$ w3m -4 http://www.google.com

it loaded Google without delay.

It's not the program that's the problem.  I found a couple of 
discussions that went back and forth between the kernel module or 
Debian's network stack as the source of the problem, though some were 
also blaming Netscape/Mozilla.  But AFAIK, w3m is unrelated to Mozilla, 
so I don't think it's a Mozilla problem.

See, for example:
http://lists.debian.org/debian-ipv6/2004/12/msg00014.html
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=253590

I've also found at least one discussion on Ubuntu's developer forum 
pertaining to the IPv6 problem, and I had the same issue in Ubuntu.  My 
Debian kernel is 2.6.8, but I believe Ubuntu uses a newer kernel.

I don't know whether it does or does not, but I do know that under OS X, 
I do have an IPv6 address (which, for all I know, might go unused) and 
this doesn't create any problems for me.  I have no issues with Safari, 
Firefox or Camino, which is a Mozilla Community Project and shares a lot 
of code with Mozilla/Firefox.  Under Debian (and Ubuntu), however, IPv6 
screws me up.  I had to disable it by commenting out the appropriate 
lines in /etc/modprobe.d/aliases.

There's nothing special I was trying to do with IPv6 -- I wouldn't have 
a clue how!  It's just that there's something amiss with the way Debian 
handles IPv6, or handles failed IPv6 queries, at least as compared to 
how OS X handles these things.

No idea.  It was just conjecture on my part.

I think that's the string qmail sends as a receipt acknowledgement.

Here's the web site for the liquid oxygen charcoal starting technique
that I mentioned last night.  I had one important part wrong.  The 
ignition source must be present when pouring the LOX on the charcoal.

I work for the big C cable company, you know the only cable company in Portland.   There has been a lot of talk about this issue for the last couple of months.  Looks like this is mainly because of skype and p2p stuff.  We offer services that "compete" with skype and p2p.  The big wigs dont like that people can use the connection to do more than just surf.   Most people dont even understand that you can do more than surf with that big pipe.  I am glad that Wyden is looking out for us nerds, even if he doesent know that he is doing it.  Maybe i'll give him a RnR on CL.  ;-)

Keith,

   What screwed it up was the so-called "light" version turned out to be an
.exe file when I thought of downloading their stuff. Then, to add insult to
injury, the raindance "techie" kept saying that they support only IE and
Safari. He refused to acknowledge that any other browsers exist. When I got
tired of him repeating himself without providing any useful information, I
hung up.

   I wrote to the fellow offering this lecture and received a raply that
they'll send the "slides" as a .pdf file and I'll be able to stream the audio
so I can listen to it live. Very cooperative.

Thanks for the suggestions,

Rich

I don't know about stand-alone scanners, but the OfficeJet MFU that I
have scans just fine with the HPLIP software and SANE.  I'd be very
surprised if stand-alone scanners weren't supported.

  I stopped at FreeGeek yesterday.  I was looking for parts to build
an el-cheapo development server.  I already had a spare ATX
motherboard with dual CPU's and memory.

  I picked up a nice ATX case, CD-RW drive, PCI NIC, and 60 Gig IDE
drive for $54 dollars.

So, if pouring LOX on charcoal starts it in 3 seconds, what does 
pouring LOX on a booting PC do?  Can we find an expendable Microsoft
executive to try this for us?

Apologies for being the annoying grammar cop, but I believe 'expendable

I just got my new Acer Aspire3005WLCi. It has an internal SiS900 
Ethernet NIC, but I can't get it to work at all. No ARP, no ping, 
nothing. But the lights work.

I reloaded Windows (as much as it pained me) and the NIC worked fine. I 
am using the same cable/cable path as the Windows test. It's going to a 
D-Link DSS-5+ 10/100 Fast Ethernet Switch.

lsmod shows the sis900 module loaded.

modprobe.conf shows:
alias eth0 sis900

dmesg shows:
sis900.c: v1.08.08 Jan 22 2005
eth0: SiS 900 PCI Fast Ethernet at 0x1800, IRQ 3, (MAC in Hex)

lspci shows:

I ping a machine and I only see my side sending out an arp request with 
no response. Obviously nothing shows in the arp table.

Hi all,

I posted the event to http://plug.podasp.com

I also added two new podcast feeds to complement the first one.  There
is now an "Advanced" feed for advanced topics, like the Michael
Rasmussen talk on FUT.  There is still the "General" feed.  And, there
is now an "All" which gives you both the advanced and general feed.

If you want to syndicate these feeds off your blog, you can include
this little bit of JS code.

Thanks,
Chris

This is great for those of us in remote areas!  But then there is how to 
a How-to-Listen issue since I don't have an iPod.  I did some looking 
and have several possibilities for software but was wondering what 
others that have non-iPod equipment might be using.

I like to capture/download and convert to something I can listen to on 
my Palm Tungsten T5.  Not sure of all the types the RealPlayer 
application handles but I've converted some .oggs to .mp3 and used them 
on the T5.

Any suggestions?

Go to the site, click on "archive" and you'll see that everything is
posted as MP3 files.  You can listen to these using any MP3 software
you'd like, like xmms, mplayer, or Windoze stuff like Windows Media
Player or RealPlayer.

The RSS feed allows you to subscribe to the feed so that you
automatically get the newest episodes when they become available.  I
use iTunes under CrossOver office to download mine, but when Juice
(formerly iPodder comes out with a linux port) I'll probably switch to
that.  There are lots of podcasting clients out there.  But, the file
which is downloaded is still nothing more than MP3.   So, you can use
any player which supports MP3, like iRiver, Zen, etc.  iTunes, for
example, lets you play them once downloaded through iTunes directly,
so you don't need a portable media player regardless.

If you don't already know, however, a podcast is NOT just posting MP3s
on a web page.  Podcasts are subscriptions to media using RSS, so that
your podcasting aggregator automatically downloads it.  Automation is
the key and is provided when you reference your media within an RSS
file.  If only we could change the stupid name, as it is neither
broadcasting nor restricted to iPods only.

Does that help?

Irregardless of its silly portmanteau-of-the-month label, a "podcast"
doesn't necessarily have anything to do with iPods (or broadcasting,
for that matter). Most are just digital audio files (MP3, typically).
You don't even need an RSS feed parser to deal with them. The PLUG
talks are archived such that you can just download individual files
and play them with whatever software/device you prefer.

This part is bad news, as it means the driver timed out trying to talk
to the hardware.  There is either a device driver problem or a
hardware problem at work here.  Does ethtool show anything
interesting?  What are the outputs of ethtool by itself, ethtool -S
and ethtool -k?

I'm really rusty on IPX - I know the network id is 6 bytes, with the end
station's MAC being the hostid. Is there any method for subnetting or
supernetting/aggregation, or is that six byte network the only unit you
can work with?

I don't see these podcasts listed in the iTunes Music Store.  Registration is
free, although a bit twisted, because you need to have iTunes installed.

Using iptables -A INPUT -j LOG --log-prefix="...: " seems to help.  
Except for one major headache on my Fedora Core 3 system, undesired 
logging to the console.  Nothing like trying to vim in one Xterm 
while you watch /var/log/messages on another only to have the 
messages muddy up your editing window.  I could use good 
documentation on how to prevent logging to the screen for 
Redhat and Fedora systems.  I don't know if this happens a lot 
because of bugs or if there is a simple change that can be done 
to syslog.conf.  Maybe the kernel logger is to blame, but where 
is the kernel logger's config file???  This problem doesn't seem
to really be distro specific.

Yes, klogd is the culprit.  Make the following config change:

/etc/sysconfig/syslog
	KLOGD_OPTIONS="-x -c 3"
Sets the default console log level to 3 (ERR).
This stops iptables log messages from being displayed on the console.

Haha, good point :)

I propose we all go buy him a beer if it passes.  That's still kosher, right?

This isn't IPv6 not working, this is IPv6 attempting to operate when your
network has no support. The response:
http://lists.debian.org/debian-ipv6/2004/12/msg00016.html

Covers it. The kernel module gets loaded, it attempts to route the packet
onto the local subnet despite no default route. Packet gets dropped
instead of producing an error.

Sounds like the failure mentioned in that followup. This though is not a
Debian failure, but a kernel bug. Sounds like MacOS X correctly handles
the situation of no IPv6 default route (produce an error internally and
have connect() fail).

This is a problem of how the kernel handles the /lack/ of IPv6, rather
than a problem of how is handles the presence of IPv6.

I would venture a guess that Wyden knows exactly what he's doing.
Rarely do Senators introduce legislation when they're unaware of most
(if not all) of the implications of that legislation.  

Take, on the other hand, Gordon Smith, whom I refer to as "Gordon Smith
(R-Douchebag)", looking to give the Broadcast Flag new life.

You're very optimistic.

I think at least one survey was done which discovered that no Senator
read the Patriot Act before passing it. True, that doesn't mean they were
unaware of the implications, but you should agree that is a bad sign at
best. If you've looked at the amount of legislation which goes through,
let alone the amount introduced, you'd realize there is no way they could
realize the consequences of all of it. Further all too often they try to
legislate technical issues, for which they don't have the background. In
these situations how would it even be possible for them to know?

> Take, on the other hand, Gordon Smith, whom I refer to as "Gordon Smith

Yup. Introducing legislation on the request of his Hollywood constituents
but not paying attention to the voters.

I make a distinction between "introduce legislation" and "vote on the
bill"; most legislators *don't* read everything that comes across their
desk, but if they wrote (or co-authored) a bill, I'd hope they have some
idea what it does. The PATRIOT act was notorious for being rushed
through and I'm pretty sure you're right on that count -- no one read it
fully.

True, "all the implications" is a bit broad, I suppose.  I suppose I
should say they have an idea of what they intend the bill to do and have
written it accordingly.

I've been a pretty savvy end user of linux for about 3 years now.  I figure out a lot of things on my own, but I'm not afraid to ask for help when needed.  I've been throwing around the idea of getting some linux certifications.  Mostly sys admin stuff has been catching my eye and I want to know how you all feel about certifications vs a  degree.  

Do you guys/gals think the sys admin certs are a well rounded, or should I go after  some of those all encompassing linux jujitsu master certs that cost an arm and a leg.

Some years back, Novell had a program called "IPX Everywhere" or
a similar name in which they encouraged people to register for
a unique IPX prefix (network address). I did. This, of course, was
needed if IPX customers wanted to interconnect.

At the same time, AT&T partnered with Novell to offer a worldwide
IPX-based network. I always assumed that AT&T achieved that with
IPX/IP gateways, thus solving the 15 hop limitation. But they might
have extended the TTL. I remember there were a few unused bits in the
IPX header.

They're all sysadmin certs, right?  Sure, the Red Hat one is more
expensive and has a practical exam, but they all take some knowledge.

I took the LPI Level 1 exams at Free Geek a while ago, and even as a
7-year Linux user/admin, I learned some new stuff while preparing for it.

I'd suggest starting with that and an A+, and look at achieving a basic
SAGE skill level.  They have a standard for rating sysadmins; a SAGE
Level 2 admin is pretty dang competent.  (It's self-rated, not by exam.)

People know A+ certifications now, and "Linux Professional Institute"
looks pretty good on a resume.  CCNAs aren't that hard to get, either.

Let your employer pay for the expensive ones.  And don't forget, you can
deduct tuition.

Move fast, there's lots of folks hiring sysadmins right now.  I think
PSU Office of IT is still looking for a Linux/Solaris admin.  Hey, free
tuition and generous benefits...

Hi

A particular cert may be required to apply for a position.

IMHO, besides showing you can pass tests, certs are useful for
1. Applying to entry level positions when you don't have much experience.
2. Satisfying HR types who use degrees and certs to compensate for not 
fully understanding necessary job skills.
3. To differentiate yourself from similar candidates.
4. Demonstrates commitment to career advancement.
5. Know that you have broad understanding of the topic.

Certs are vendor specific like Red Hat, Novell, etc. or vendor neutral like 
, CompTIA and LPI. The LPI organization and development process is more 
"open" than the rest.

To pass cert tests, use some combination of master the material versus cram 
for the exam. There are lots of self study materials and a range of online 
and classroom courseware. At least visit the cert web site and study the 
Certification Test Objectives pages.

Checkout IBMs online tutorials for LPI: 
http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/lpi/?S_TACT=105AGX03&S_CMP=ZHP

While you're at it, checkout the rest of IBM developerworks site, a nice 
present to the community.

Freegeek has offered LPI exams (someone add details).

Cheers,
Mike

Have you ever seen a cert REQUIRED to apply.  Being non-degreed I have
gotten a number of jobs (every one I ever had as a programmer) despite
not having the "required" degree.

Subject: [PLUG] Reconfiguring for change of hardware
Message-ID: <440A0960.4080207@comcast.net>

I recently had to replace the power supply on this machine. The new one 
has fewer "regular" connectors, the ones used for hard drives and CD 
drives, than the old one. With the old one I had a CD-ROM drive and a 
CD-RW drive. It is very rare that I need to read a CD on this machine, 
so I just left it disconnected when I put in the new ps.

The OS installation is SuSE 9.1.

I'm having two problems. One may have always been there. I am unable to 
open the CD-RW drawer unless the K3B program is running.

The second is that I am unable to point various CD tools at the 
recorder; they all want to look at the no-longer-connected CD-ROM drive.

In /dev I have:

lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 3 2004-10-06 11:16 cdrecorder -> hdd
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 3 2004-09-27 17:24 cdrom -> hdc

Would the simplest thing be to replace cdrom with a new link also 
pointing to hdd, or is there something more fundamental that I'm missing?

I already have my A+.  That was a cake walk. I'm just a little confused
on what exams would be best for just a basic all around certified linux
guy.  But so far thanks for the links everybody. I'll check them out
tonight while I'm working.

CCNA is good, but (obviously) Cisco-centric.  You'll get a great
overview of networking technologies and TCP/IP, but you'll also get a
bunch of IOS commands, which is useful if you're a netadmin working
with Cisco equipment, but perhaps not as useful for anyone else.

LPI Level 1 was a bit dated (as of 8/2005), but very well rounded.
Aside from the package management questions (debs or rpms), it is
basically distro-neutral... and it's fairly cheap (when compared to
the distro specific certs) at $100 per exam and no mandatory class.

... just my 2 cents.

Subject: [PLUG] Software problem or bad motherboard?
Message-ID: <20060305030522.E6125@eehouse.org>

I'm about to demonstrate just how little I know about hardware....

I just rebooted my three-year-old IBM NetVista for the first time in
two months, and it won't boot.  It dies before touching the floppy or
hard drive, spewing "L 07 07 07 07 07 07 07 07 07 07 07...." across
half the screen.  It *will* PXE-boot, however.  Now, I tweaked my
kernel prior to the reboot, installed new modules but forgot to
install the new bzImage -- but is there any way at all that software
could be implicated in a failure so early in the boot process?

The warranty expires sometime this month.  I won't know when until I find
the receipt.  :-)

Thanks,

--Eric

LILO problem.  Need to either have a small /boot partition at the start of the 
drive, or use grub instead.

I use grub.  Unless some debian 'apt-get upgrade' swapped lilo for grub
on me!  Is the "L" indicative of a Lilo error?

Even if Lilo were hosing things, wouldn't I be able to boot off of a
floppy?  Or a CD?  Net boot (PXE) is the only thing that works.
Unfortunatly all I've been able to find to boot is the Debian
installer, but even with that I can mount partitions and see that the
HD is fine.  There's not enough in the installer to run grub though.

I'll play around a bit....

Forget my previous reply/question: you're entirely right.  The "boot
floppy" and "bootable CD-ROM" I was trying with don't boot any other
machine either, lables notwithstanding.  Once I'd made a floppy that
could boot a working machine it booted the broken one as well.  It was
an ancient debian rescue disk, on a 2.2 kernel, but with it I was able
to run grub-install, reboot to "L 07 07 07" again, boot off the floppy
and run grub-install again, and finally boot off of the hard drive.
As far as I can tell, the machine's back to working.  No motherboard
problems here.

lilo is not on the machine.  I don't understand how it got involved in
the boot process.  But I'm happy now, and can worry about that some
other time. :-)

Thanks very much for your help this Saturday evening!

galen,

   Doesn't appear to work in version 7.0. However, there is a command that
works well:

   pdf2ps filename.pdf - | lpr

Message-ID: <af070b010603051436p539e3b7ft95adca9f2d5bdb4a@mail.gmail.com>

I am doing a bit of information organizing and would like
to be able to create html links which open up specific
email messages in Thunderbird.  Are there any APIs
or command line arguments which you can pass to
Thunderbird to cause it to open a specific message?

The GoogleDesktop under Windows is able to do this
so in principal it can be done, but I don't know how they
do it. All I can see is that the url goes to Googledesktop
listening on localhost and contains the Message-ID
of the email in question.

Thanks for any suggestions,

Bill Barry

That might just be exactly what cups does under the hood, but I can just

  lp filename.pdf

   I've thought about this, Eric, but never tried it. Perhaps the next time I
print a pdf file I'll give it a shot.

See: http://www.lowth.com/LinWiz/nfs_help.htm

I guessed on how to change nfslock, commented out the default line and
replaced it with: 

     daemon rpc.statd -p 4000

Fedora Core 3 is using some variable by default, but I don't know where
it comes from let alone how to set it.

So I'm think I've succeeded:

Looked at klogd man page, says that the definition of the error
levels is in kernel.h.  Well, these aren't under 
/usr/include/linux/kernel.h on my Redhat 7.3 system.
Odd.

I could just say anything higher than level 3 and call it good...

Having a Slackware install CD is another good way to do rescues.  The way 
Slackware installs, you start in a working Linux environment which happens
to be incredibly useful for fixing things.  Anymore, I'm moving towards
freedos and loadlin to get into Linux.  This is a nice clean way, especially
if Winhose is installed anywhere, to avoid the boot sector nightmere.
One problem I've run into is wanting to run parallel Linux systems on the
same machine so that there is a main and a backup system.  Even adding a
blank hard disk can mess up grub.  If PC's supported an off hard disk 
boot sector, this could significantly alleviate this issue.  If you can
boot to thumb drive before hard disk, this is something I'd recommend 
exploring.

If you are using a distro that does SELinux, you will screw up the 
security contexts doing that. I don't believe Slack uses SELinux extended 
attributes.

There is a recovery disc for Fedora Core that works and does not muck up 
SELinux.

Kevin,

I passed both of the LPI level one tests at Free Geek.  They are
providing them at a discounted rate of $40/exam (instead of $100).
Regarding vendor neutral exams, this is what I have gathered:

Comptia's Linux+ is the easiest, and is said to represent six months of
on the job training as a Linux SysAdmin.

LPIC-1 is more difficult than Linux+ and represents 12-18 months of
experience.  That is based on talk on the LPI mailing lists. There
currently are ~28,000 LPIC-1s in the world.

LPIC-2 is significantly more difficult than LPIC-1, and represents 24-36
months experience - again garnered from the LPI mailing lists.  There
are currently ~4,800 LPIC-2's.

If you shoot for the LPIC-1 exam, here is another good site to find some
training information.


Good luck,

W. Reid Leake

Message-ID: <005e01c64153$0f6b7770$6d01a8c0@RAMA>

File Size Limit Problem

I have been doing backups across my LAN lately and have been
encountering some file size limit issues with FC4.

The problem is this.  I have two systems:

System A (RH FC4) and system B (Knoppix)

I have booted to a Knoppix CD on system B and am trying to backup a disk
image to system A.  All operations are done as root.

>From system B:

  dd if=/dev/hda | bzip2 | ssh systemA 'cat > file'

aborts short of a full transfer with no diagnostic

  dd if=/dev/hda | bzip2 | ssh systemA 'cd /scr ; cat > imagefile.bz2'

aborts with "File limit exceeded (bash)'

To get the transfer to work I have to start the ssh server on Knoppix
and from system A:

  ssh systemB 'dd if=/dev/hda | bzip2 ' | cat > imagefile.bz2

Both logged directly into system A or via ssh from system B into system
A "ulimit" returns "Unlimited".

* So where is the limit coming from on system A??

* How do I remove the limit that appears to be imposed with an ssh
  transfer into the FC4 (system A) system??

William,

Thanks for the info... good to know! Will freegeek be administering
the LPI Level 2 exams? I did actually attain LPI level 1 in 8/2005 and
was just giving my opinion/experience with it.

I'm looking forward to seeing how difficult Level 2 is...

Cheers,
-Kevin

We care...

Frames

Packets

Segments..

These are different things.

IMHO they're all packets... to differentiate between the various levels
is just going in to more specifics than is usually necessary unless
you're dealing with very knowledgeable and nitpicky network engineers.

When we speak of datagrams, frames, or whatnot... does the context tell
us what layer we're dealing with even if the proper packet term isn't
used?  If not, then you're not communicating effectively with whoever
you're communicating with.

Subject: [PLUG] IPS HLBR 1.0 released (off-topic)
Message-ID: <duhv3h$4li$10@sea.gmane.org>

IPS HLBR - Version 1.0 can detect malicious traffic using regular
expressions

Version 1.0 of Hogwash Light BR, released march 5th 2006, brings two
interesting new features. The first one is the ability of using
regular expressions to detect intrusion attempts and e-mails with
virus or phishing. The second is the use of lists with banned words.

HLBR is an IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) that reads network
traffic in the layer 2 of the OSI model. Since it works like a bridge,
it stays in-line in the network topology and doesn't need an IP
address. So, HLBR is invisible to attackers. Traffic filtering
(including the packets contents) can be done with simple rules.
Version 1.0 can use regular expressions to filter the packets. Below
is an example of rule with regular expressions:

(please see http://hlbr.sourceforge.net/hlbr-rule-1.gif)

In short, all TCP traffic destined to port 25 of the e-mail server
will be filtered. If the text:

filename="anything_different_of_line_breaks.s__c__r"

(please ignore underlines in s__c__r)

is found inside the packet, that means there are an attachment .scr in
the e-mail (virus). So this packet will suffer the action named 'virus'.
This action logs the event, dumps the malicious traffic in tcpdump
format and drops the packet. Below is an example of rule against a type
of buffer overflow attempt against DNS servers:

(please see http://hlbr.sourceforge.net/hlbr-rule-2.gif)

In this case, due to the use of pipe characters (|), HLBR will check
the traffic for the hexadecimal sequence given as an attack signature.

HLBR lets you use rules for blocking attacks against network servers.
In order to fully understand it please read our documentation at
http://hlbr.sourceforge.net/ips-en.html - explanations about the IPS
concept including charts.

HLBR site is at http://hlbr.sourceforge.net.

Not really.  It's closer to the clip/magazine/firearm confusion among people 
who have not been properly introduced to modern (ie last 100 years) firearm 
technology.  The clip (of ammunition) fits in the magazine, fits in to and 
feeds the firearm: Each component breaks down into a bunch of sub-components, 
which in turn have their own parts.  Except instead of a firearm, we're 
*really* dealing with a 7-layer burrito.

I personally am wary of people with lots of certifications.. when I
interview people its pretty easy to see who actually knows what they are
talking about in relation to the certifications they list. Some areas have
made it so easy to get the certs these days it takes little more then a few
days worth of cram sessions before you can go get it.

I personally have a CCNA and I think if you study for the certification and
can glean more then just what its trying to teach you, for instance with the
CCNA.. if you can take away the practical info about TCP/IP and networking
in general and also take in the cisco stuff as well then its beneficial.

just my .02 cents

Oh, dear doctors of medicine, can't we just call everything "illness", 
without talking about germs, viruses, genetics? (Okay, bad example).

Oh, dear attack/defense geeks, can't we just call everything malware, 
instead of talking about virii, trojans, and worms?

In short, no. People who work in fields where a single bad *segment* 
can slam an OS into silence, as compared to a group of segments being 
re-assembled results in crashing an OS... well, those people must know, 
and work on (and in) the differences. There are portions of 
communication which are only dangerous when combined with other 
portions, just as there are portions which by *themselves* are pretty 
brutal.

Having descriptive language helps us sort out the what, and where, of 
an attack, misbehavior, or oddity. If it were all the same, we wouldn't 
need words to describe the differences.

Thanks for the reference. I just read the article.

On a related note, as an old guy I looked into the cheap Internet access
offered by the AARP (PeoplePC deal for AARP members), I called and was told
that the deal was only available for Windows users. Not that they would only
support MS Windows you know not answer questions about Linux, but no, only

Ted,

   This is very common; I see it in the business community all the time. In a
way there's a rational explanation for this: most of these folks (AARP,
business consultants, natural resource companies, and more) are not into
computers other than as tools they must use. As such, they go with the flow
and don't even think of looking for alternatives.

   Back in 1990 when I first arrived and was working for someone else, all the
computers were DOS and not networked (except by sneakernet). Of course,
WordPerfect was the processor of choice for all the words produced. I tuned
my machine to have a black screen with grey foreground. Everyone else had the
default of white on blue and would ask me, "How'd you do that?" Never
occurred to them to look at the tool they used all the time to see what they
could do with it.

   In the intervening 16 years, nothing's changed in most places. This is not
to write that I am happy with the situation, but sometimes it's like pushing
water uphill.

Is it possible that a lot of these issues stem from the fact that a majority
of organizations do not trust in the ability to ensure and verify the
integrity of opensource downloads including the Linux operating system and
vendors are quick to jump on the bandwagon to provide them with
applications/drivers that will be deployed on "verified" operating systems?
"verified" as in the administrator has the reasonable expectation that the
Windows 2003 Server installation CD has not been tampered with.

In the case of PeoplePC it is a hold your customer prisoner issue.  The 
PeoplePC setup puts some MS Windows stuff in that is nearly immpossible 
to pry out.  Back in my ISP support days I had to turn new customers 
away ( or tell them to call PeoplePC to uninstall ) if they'd even tried 
PeoplePC.  We ( and there were some very savy Windows people there ) 
couldn't find, using normal/typical means, how to uninstall.

I already went through the same type of deal with Smartforce.  Through
my work we can take some classes for free and others for a discount.
Anyway I called up and wanted to take the Linux+ course.  I made it very
clear to them at the time of purchase that I did not use windows at home
and they assured me that it would work on a Linux box. WRONG!  I took me
three months to get my money back ($450 bucks). They didn't understand
why I didn't just want to install windows and take the course.   I would
love to have a course like that, as I am somewhat of a visual learner.
Kinda defeats the purpose when it wont even run on the os that you want
to really learn.

Tim,

   Perhaps. Then sell them a set of Slackware disks (from the factory),
Debian, SuSE, or whomever. They can see the disks are nice and clean.

Bruce,

   Well, that's why the price is so low. What Winduh's user wants to study for
linux certification?

   I've received CDs that have a Winduhs start up program on them, but the
files are either pdf or text.

Here's Carla's article:
http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/nethub/article.php/3589561


I can tell you exactly why there are so few open source hardware
drivers.  There is no big conspiracy, at least not the one you think.  
Carla, normally so very smart about such things, and Pam at Groklaw,
who ought to know - biffed it.

The general reason is patents.  No, not to protect the patents of the
manufacturer of the device in question, but the patents NOT owned by
the manufacturer.  

Most of us agree that many patents are stupid and should not have been
issued.  However, because of recent changes in the management of the
patent office, patent examiners are actually encouraged to approve
lousy patents - it means more revenue.  With the patent office being
treated by Congress like a cash cow, the office itself gets little of
the revenue gathered by fees.  Slightly increasing the approval rate,
and spending less time per patent, and hiring some really questionable
examiners at very low salaries, and outsourcing the examination 
process overseas, allows the patent office to stay in the black.  At
the cost of some really crappy patents.  The assumption is, let the
courts battle it out.  Patents not issued means less revenue.  Duh.

But the courts are part of the problem.  Before 1982, patent plaintiffs
would shop the country for the district court with the most favorable
track record - the rates of successful attacks on patents, or successful
defenses of them, varied by a factor of 5 from district to district.
In 1982, Congress created the CAFC, the Court of Appeals for the 
Federal Court, and tasked it with patent litigation.  Unsurprisingly,
this court became a revolving door agency for judges and staff, who
would shuttle back and forth to the major patent attorney offices.
Successful litigations protecting patents skyrocketed.  The result
was incentives to get even more bad patents, by parties that had no
intent to do anything with them but blackmail manufacturers with them.
The result is even more patents.

There are now something like 500 electrotechnology patents being
issued per week.  The vast majority are poisonous dreck, often 
repetitive, overly broad, and covering existing technology.  I have a
few patents - I have seen major players like Texas Instruments take a
thesaurus to my patents and apply for patents that describe the same
invention in different words.  If I use my own patented ideas, I risk
getting taken to court for violating a copy of my own patent.

So, with perhaps 100,000 active patents, averaging 20 pages each,
covering the design of subcircuits and architectures for integrated
circuits, many overlapping and repetitive, it is nearly impossible
to design a chip without violating hundreds or thousands of patents.
Further, if a manufacturer was stupid enough to engage a large staff
to read all these stupid patents, in an attempt design around all of
them, they now open themselves up to triple damages for "knowingly"
violating a patent.  Ignorance is less expensive.

Fortunately, *finding* these patent violations is very difficult in
many cases;  tearing down a chip covered with millions of transistors
and connected in a possibly obfuscated way is enormously expensive;
it costs more than the original design.  I can design chips ONLY because
the patent vultures have a very hard time seeing what I am doing.

Imagine you are a troll at a patent mill, with your half-dozen
stupid patents on some aspect of computer graphic circuit design. 
How are you going to find out if a manufacturer has violated your
stupid patent?  A teardown of every graphics chip on the market
would cost you tens of millions of dollars, with only a small
chance of finding "your" "invention" in any particular one.  Even
if you win an enormous court settlement, it will not compensate
you for all the teardowns that did not pan out.

---- Enter open source drivers ----

What if the trolls had a clear view of the inner workings of the
targetted chips - their architecture, their clever ideas, how to use it?  

That is what an open source driver is - a complete description of
how the chip is used, mandated to be open to everyone, including the
trolls.  Rather than engage in million dollar teardowns, the trolls
merely need to Google for Linux drivers.  A search process that used
to cost tens of millions of dollars now costs thousands.  So the
trolls can spend a few thousand on a bad patent, a few more thousand
on a search, and a few thousand on retaining a lawyer.  The litigation
itself will be expensive, but the bastards at CAFC will just hold
your arms while the trolls rape you.

Only the very largest manufacturers, with big legal departments, or
the very smallest, who are too small to be worth suing, can afford
to produce open source drivers.  And there are no "small guys" in
chip manufacturing.

With the legal environment like that, the surprising thing is that
there are any open source drivers at all.  They are often produced
by reverse engineering overseas, and can still subject manufacturers
to risk.  Reverse engineering in the US subjects the open source
driver writer to the tender mercies of the Digital Millenium Copyright
Act, AKA the "keep my patent violations secret" act.  

OK, so the situation sucks.  It will remain sucky as long as people
let their congresscritters pass stuff like that.  And citizens will
do that as long as some pinheaded technologists claim that "protecting
intellectual property" is a good thing, rather than a form of rape,
and we let them get away with it, rather than spit in their faces.

----

So Carla, give the manufacturers a break.  Many would like to
provide you with open source drivers, but they will get their asses
sued off if they do.  It is a sad state of affairs, but they did
not create it - our political representatives did.  If you want to
change the situation, turn the bastards out of office.  To do that,
you will have to convince a lot of your neighbors that "intellectual
property" is not only unnecessary to technological advance, but the
biggest barrier to it.  There are a lot of people to convince, and
there are a lot of liars with Big Media bullhorns opposing you. 
But there is also the fact of Linux, which is a pretty amazing
intellectual accomplishment given the IP crowd's claim that such
things can't happen without patents...

You're confusing two issues here- Linux support of any kind, and FOSS drivers. 
The ideal would be nice well-written FOSS drivers. The patent-paranoid can 
still supply closed-source binary drivers. The fact is the majority of 
vendors are unwilling to support anything but Windows, and it's not because 
of lame market-share arguments. We're all grownups here, and we know it's a 
combination of pressure from Redmond and plain old dimwittedness.

Ya know, Linksys and D-Link and Netgear and IBM and Sun and HP and Dell and 
all them others have a lot more money and lawyers and lobbyists than we do. 
Don't waste any tears on them.

Quite amazing, given the current hostile climate to anything sensible.

I have a 1U boxx system that is about 5 years old. You have to promise to do
good with it. The only problem is that its not really "dead". Dual P3
~800Mhz on a Tyan MB with either 1024 or 2048Mb of RAM. 40Gb IDE. Deal is,
the Psup will probably die within the next 1000 hours, so you'd need to have
a spare 1U that is ATX.

Also, it's a Boxx, so it is LOOUUD!

Subject: [PLUG] mounting an ISO read/write?
Message-ID: <20060308045235.GA7929@merlot.com>

I have an ISO that boots FreeBSD. It won't boot on my client's PC
because the APIC is in the FreeBSD blacklist. So I want to turn it off
for booting. Easy, except that I can't get the ISO mounted RW under
Linux.

I have tried a whole slew of command lines to get it mounted RW, and I
never get an error until I actually try to write. Then I get errors.

  legs:/mnt/boot# chmod 666 device.hints
  chmod: changing permissions of `device.hints': Read-only file system

Here's the mount line I used for this one:

  mount -t iso9660 -o rw,loop ../ISOs/FreeNAS-0.6.iso /mnt

I've also tried using the '-w' mount option, and remounting it as rw.
Same results.

The ISO file is writable. The mount directory is writable. The loop
device is writable.

Any ideas?

Thanks.

ISO 9660 is a read-only filesystem.  You can't just dynamically write
data to it....

No, that's not the province of the robots exclusion file...

I'll defer to those on the list with more knowledge/experience on
printing from linux->Windows printers.

I was wondering about that.

A deeper google suggests that ISOs are built whole, and not as
filesystems. If it can be mounted as a filesystem, though, why can't
someone write a 'write' function for isofs? 

I guess I have to build a FreeBSD machine so I can run the build process
and make a fresh ISO with the necessary flags set. Oh well. Maybe
there's a bootable CD I can use.

Thanks.

Subject: [PLUG] Can I make a link happen automatically?
Message-ID: <440DFB91.32373.4B078DF8@localhost>

Some time ago I installed Firefox in the 32-bit chroot environment 
on my Ubuntu-64 Breezy laptop, along with Adobe Reader and 
RealPlayer. Right after I installed it I discovered I couldn't go 
anywhere with it. Other applications in the 64-bit world had no 
problem. After much advice and suggestions from people here I 
finally determined that it was a DNS problem. The chroot 
environment was not seeing the DNS server addresses in 
/etc/resolv.conf, which apparently change whenever I connect to a 
different place, e.g., going from home to PSU, back again, etc. 

With more help from people here I now have a little command to 
enter that links the 64-bit version to the 32-bit version of resolv.conf:

sudo ln -f /etc/resolv.conf /chroot/breezy/32bits/etc/resolv.conf

This works great. However, it is a pain in the neck. I need to 
automate the process somehow. My first choice would be to create 
some kind of command that would make the link update 
automatically any time there is a change in the file in the 64-bit 
world. I.e., if /etc/resolv.conf changes it will automatically trigger 
the link command.

As a second choice, can I add the link command in front of the 
command that launches Firefox-32 (the one installed in chroot)? 
The command to launch 32-bit Firefox in the Gnome application 
drop-down menu is "dchroot -d firefox %U." Could I just stick the 
link command in front of it by adding some secret code in between 
so Linux will realize it is two commands, not just one?

Or does anyone have a better way to avoid having to open a 
terminal and type out that command and my password every time I 
go to a new place?

That is the way it was designed, but it might be possible to do dynamic
writing with the right hacks. I notice that recent 2.6 kernels have
support for packet writing (used for CD-RW and DVD-RW drives with RW
media). Perhaps only other filesystems read-write on RW media, but that
is something (but not portable).

It wasn't designed to handle constantly changing data. After all
originally all CDs were prerecorded. Might be possible if someone tried
though.

It works similarly to a NAT firewall. The gateway translates the 
addresses to what it needs on each side and remembers where connections 
are coming from and going to.

You could create a script to run both commands, or (not being a gnome user I don't know for sure) it may be possible to separate multiple commands with a semicolon.

Another way you could do this would be creating a cron job to run once a minute that checks the modification time of both files, and copies the resolver configuration into the chroot when it's stale.

A third option would be to investigate having your dhcp client update both files. Some of them can update multiple files, or be piped to a script which runs tee and gets both files modified. (dhcpcd is the one I'd investigate first)

Sorry for the late response.  Left town.  The crossover cable was made by
someone and lent to me.  I tried two different ones.  The nic cards are
RTL 8139 and not sure about the other nic card yet.  I think a realtek
also.  It was configured with the detected driver from CENTOS install. 
Problem is on the new server I'm forgetting the passwords.  It is late at
night.  I'll sleep on this then get back to it.  I'm still confused as I
only fund one place on the internet with the same error and no answer. 
Almost seems like a hardware issue but no idea.

Thanks.

Keith responds:
Carla, please read what you wrote again.  You mention the lack of
open drivers, and then start spinning conspiracy theories.  I responded
to your statement about open drivers.  "Linux support of any kind" is
indeed another kettle of tofu, and is in fact at least three kettles.

I design hardware, and work with a few of the companies that produce
drivers, and actually have taken the time to ask some of these people
what their concerns are.  We had some folks from HP at a recent PLUG
meeting to talk about printer drivers.  Their concerns, both expressed
to the whole meeting and to me privately, paint a much more complex
and nuanced picture than the "pressure from Redmond" or "stupidity"
(or "wickedness" or "indifference" or "venality" or "greed" or
"Bill Gates inflatable doll fetish") theories.  

Since you feel your article was about a combination of open and
binary drivers, I will explore what you think you wrote about.
Let's look in the three (!) binary driver kettles.

Like you, I dislike binary drivers.  I dislike them because the
Kernel Gods, in their Infinite Wisdom, have decided that binary 
drivers are a Bad Thing.  They do not provide a common API that
allows one binary driver to work with all kernels, or two drivers
that work with all 2.4 and 2.6 kernels, say.  That would not be
impossible or even difficult, and it might in fact make the kernel
more robust.  But it is Politically Incorrect, because it is Not GPL. 
This is, IMHO, an example of the Linux community shooting itself
in the foot.  And I take some responsibility for that, because it
would not be difficult to fork the kernel just slightly, and
maintain a few glue routines that provide an interface for standard
binary drivers, and compile those routines into the kernels from
the main tree.  I have not helped make this happen.  Mea Culpa.

So to match all the kernels, we actually need zillions of binary
drivers for one device.  Or at least a large range of drivers that
will "insmod -f" into groups of similar kernels.   What is a
hardware manufacturer to do?  Support one driver for one kernel
variant?  Drivers for all the popular distros?  Drivers for every
combination of kernel 2.X.YY ?  They only have to support four
or five drivers for all of Windows.  Get real!

So now we get to the three kettles of binary drivers.  Manufacturers
can support (1) most kernels, or (2) a few kernels, or (3) none. 
Every kernel version they don't support lights up the phones in
Bangalore, as angry Linux geeks berate them for not supporting
Slackbuntu or RedPanties or some other obscure distro with a
tweaked kernel.  Supporting none is a lot easier. 

Blessings on those that actually make an attempt, and put up with
the foolishness that results.  They probably do it because many
manufacturers (like HP) develop drivers on Linux first, and then
port to Windoze.  Often,  the coders themselves push the Linux
drivers out into the world, without letting the bean counters 
know.  If somebody ever does a cost-benefit analysis of this,
and finds out how much Linux costs to support, we are screwed.

But again, this cacaphony of binary-phobic kernels is our fault,
not the manufacturers.  We can fix this if we choose.

I will join you in your contempt of the manufacturers who don't
mention Linux (in)-compatability.   However, in practical reality
I have found there is nothing like a Google search before buying. 
If the community says the included Linux drivers are hard to use,
I don't care if the manufacturer claims Linux compatability.  And
I don't believe the mantra of "requires Win 98, Win 2000, Win XP"
on the box if Linux folks have written of their successes.  For 
wireless cards especially, it is critical to find out what people
have had success with, because versions of products change.  The
manufacturer's sites are indeed useless.  But we know that before
we look at them, right?   Useless websites will be with us long
after Windows crumbles into dust.

The Google search is hard to do when you are standing in the aisle
at Fry's, about to purchase a "Happy Family Mixed Vegetable Brand"
gizmo and wondering if it will work.  It is bad enough to drive 20
minutes each way to Fry's from Beaverton on the offchance that the
items you want will be there.  It must be hell to drive there from
eastern Oregon, with only a vague idea of what's there (Hint:
reboxed crapola).  Thank goodness for mail order and UPS, and
friends in Portland glad to help with your shopping.

Subject: [PLUG] Fun with web logs
Message-ID: <20060308145741.GB17455@patch.com>

Scanning some web logs I saw this entry:

202.108.22.78 - - [07/Mar/2006:21:53:00 -0800] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 4199 "-"
  "Baiduspider+(+http://www.baidu.com/search/spider.htm)"

That's curious.  What is that spider?  Visiting that link brings up a page in
Chinese that I can't comprehend.  A little research lead me to:

 http://ir.baidu.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=188488&p=irol-homeprofile

  Many people have asked about the meaning of our name. "Baidu" was
  inspired by a poem written more than 800 years ago during the Song
  Dynasty. The poem compares the search for a retreating beauty amid
  chaotic glamour with the search for one's dream while confronted by
  life's many obstacles.  "... hundreds and thousands of times, for her
  I searched in chaos, suddenly, I turned by chance, to where the lights
  were waning, and there she stood." Baidu, whose literal meaning is
  hundreds of times, represents persistent search for the ideal.

What a great story.  Makes Google look cold and heartless.

Thanks for the suggestion. I tried it and it's half working. I edited 
the launch command in the drop-down applications by adding the 
link command in front, follwed by a semicolon, then the launch 
command. When I tried it all I got was "firefox is loading," then the 
message disappeared and nothing launched. 

So then I thought I'd try it from the command line, because that 
usually gives a bunch of error messages. But strangely, it launched 
from the command line. Assuming maybe I made a typo in the 
menu editor, I went back to the menu editor and copied and pasted 
exactly what the launch command was into the command line and 
it still worked in the command line. So evidently the menu editor 
(smeg) has issues with semicolons.

I don't want to wait 60 seconds after booting before being able to 
get on the net. Can a cron job be run more often, like every five 
seconds or so? If so, would that be a drag on the system? I know 
nothing of cron, but I'll go check it out if this is a viable solution. I 
just don't want to bog down my computer. I read "man cron" but 
didn't understand more than a few words of it.

This is over my head. I've heard of dhcp -- doesn't that have 
something to do with the connection? I know I have to specify 
"dhcp" in the choices in System > Administration > Networking. 
What is "your dhcp client"? I tried "man dhcpcd" and "man dhcp," 
but nada. Is dhcpcd something on my computer? Or on the 
connection end? Sorry I'm too dumb about this stuff.

Thanks for the suggestions.

I care. ;-)

The terminology I know & love is at layer 4 of the OSI model, tcp and
udp chop up the data from the higher layers in to _segments_.

At layer 3, IP wraps up those tcp or udp segments in to IP _packets_. If
the layer 2 techology is ethernet, then at layer 2 we use ethernet
_frames_.

Layer 1 is just bits on the wire...

Another common element is that with each change your network interface goes down
and comes back up.

You're running Ubuntu right?  /etc/network/ifup.d (from memory, I'm at work and
there's nothing but Solaris and Windows around me) contains scripts that are
executed whenever the network interface comes up.  If you include your ln ...
command in one there the linking would happen automagically evertime the interface
came up, no matter where you were.

That thought "I need to automate the process somehow."  That's a good one.  Hold
on to it.  Great attitude to take.

I've seen a similar problem with a cable that was made incorrectly.  The
person that made it just made sure both ends were the same, but didn't
pay attention to the twisted pairs.  This cable drove me nuts, creating
all kinds of bizarre problems.  The worst part was that some NIC's would
have no problems, while others would choke but keep going, and others
would choke and die.  I re-did the ends and solved all the problems.

Anyway, your situation reminded me of that incident.

Good Luck,

Then perhaps the best solution would be to create a shell script (~/bin/chrootff.sh) like so:
----
#/bin/sh
sudo ln -f /etc/resolv.conf /chroot/breezy/32bits/etc/resolv.conf
exec dchroot -d firefox %U
----
(Don't forget to chmod u+x the script)

Then just use this script as the command for your menu entry for firefox 32 bit.

This really wouldn't be an ideal solution in any case. It's possible with some cron daemons to have scripts run more often than 60 seconds, but even if the overhead for the system is minimal, it exists nonetheless.

I only suggested it because you hinted more than firefox may be having issues with DNS, and it'd be one way to avoid changing the run commands for all the apps you run chrooted.

DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. Technical issues aside, it's how your system is able to communicate with a foreign network without you manually configuring an IP address and related information. There are several somewhat-common dhcp clients for unix/linux type OSes. dhcpcd is IMHO the most configurable of them. A lot of distros use ISC DHCP client, which is also fairly configurable but tends to be slower and is definitely bloated.

In any event, mucking around with the init scripts your distro uses to do network management to get the DHCP client to work with multiple files is not a task for the faint of heart.

Granted, I did not present a clear position on open vs. closed drivers. 
However, as far as conspiracy theories go, they're not theories.  The DOJ 
blew it- who gives a rip about the antique Netscape browser, sheesh. The real 
anti-competitive behavior is collusion with hardware vendors. Microsoft 
exerts tremendous pressure on its partners and resellers (perhaps "victims" 
is a better word) to support only Windows. Microsoft offers certification for 
its vendors. The price of this is extremely restrictive NDAs- the vendors 
cannot discuss anything, including their own specifications or the fact that 
the NDA even exists. When MS releases a service pack or security patch that 
breaks devices, oh well, all they have to do write new drivers and get 
re-certified. Anyone who tries to remain independent pays much higher prices 
for MS licenses, and is denied access to documentation and other essential 
resources.

The whole point of Linux and FOSS is not to bail out self-enslaved Redmond 
serfs, though that is a common side-effect, or to give a free ride to 
commercial hardware vendors, though again that is a common side-effect. If 
you consider FOSS to be merely "politically correct" you do not understand it 
at all.

I cry a river. If they had not painted themselves into a very small insane 
patent/DMCA/NDA corner, which you say is the main problem, they could simply 
open the specs and let the FOSS devs and distribution maintainers take care 
of it. And, if supporting closed drivers is so difficult, how does NVidia 
support such a wide range of architectures and kernels with a very small 
number of self-installing binaries?  Consider wireless adapters- how does 
supporting a limited number of wireless chipsets present such big 
difficulties? There are a zillion different brands of wireless adapters all 
using the same few basic radio chipsets- Broadcom, Atheros, Prism, and a few 
others. One basic Atheros driver, for example, supports dozens of different 
devices. Doesn't sound so awful to me.

Another little nugget to ponder- How can so many products support Mac OSX but 
not *nix? It's a lot shorter leap to other 'nixes than it is from windoze, 
and Linux has a lot larger market share than OSX. Linux + Unix is even 
bigger.

Your posts are interesting, and they paint an even bleaker picture than the 
one I already had. As far as I can see, every woe you state is 
self-inflicted. I'm not blaming the folks in the trenches, the devs and 
engineers- they are just as victimized as us customers by shortsighted, 
dimwitted management, and the rapacious Microsoft.

No reasonable person expects perfect Linux support for every single device as 
soon as it hits the market. What most folks want is a truly competitive 
market, not the ridiculous handcuffed mess we have now. Just think of what 
the computing landscape would look like without Linux...it would be a Winduz 
wasteland, and Windows would be even awfuller than it is now, if that is 
possible.

A good pointer, but I think you (and perhaps Greg Kroah) misunderstand
what a binary driver interface should be.  Greg's essay regards open
source drivers, either in the main kernel tree or not.  He calls
binary driver writers "leeches", which is a slur, not an analysis, and
shows a marked misunderstanding of the motivations for binary drivers. 
I touched on that in my first posting;  for those that got here late,
binary drivers often result from avoiding costly patent litigation.

Nobody demands the schematic or the mask data for the chips in the
computers they use; it is obvious that at some level, everyone accepts
"binary drivers" if they are unable to understand them.  I am glad 
that Greg can do such great kernel coding work, but to the ordinary
user both the kernel and the chips underneath are black boxes.  The
user wants something that "just works", and doesn't care how it is
delivered.  Every one of us has this attitude for the aspects of
the world we take for granted.  It is called division of labor,
and modern civilization depends on it.

Successful systems make use of division of labor, and in technology
this occurs through defined interfaces and abstraction layers.  When
Galen designs a circuit board, he rarely concerns himself with the
chemistry of copper or the tempering of through-hole drills.  He just
follows the manufacturer's design rules for circuit board layout,
which are extremely simplified abstractions of all the picky
implementation details.  Yes, he might be able to design a smaller,
faster board if he bypassed these simplifying rules and worked at
a lower level, but his design time would increase enormously.  

Right now I am working with a client to define an interface for
a block of circuitry I am designing for their integrated circuit 
chip.  The client does not need to concern themselves with what
is inside the interface, and I don't need to concern myself with
what is outside it.  We could optimize the behavior of the system
by interpenetrating each other's domains, but we would reduce
engineering progress to a snail's crawl.  Defined interfaces are
what allow chip designers to double silicon productivity every
18 months.  If software methods had kept pace, then we could
write an operating system from scratch in an afternoon.

A defined interface in software would be a well defined set of glue
code that works in kernel space and delivers a consistent set of 
data structures and subroutine calls to the binary drivers using it. 
That will be a *slow* piece of code, because data structures must
be translated by the glue code, and legacy subroutines must be
emulated with new ones.  This whole mess of spagetti will need to
be frequently rewritten to match a rapidly changing kernel.  But 
it means the binary driver I got with my Super Whizzy Gizmo three
years ago will work with this week's kernel - slowly, perhaps.

Some high performance devices will not be supportable with this slow
technique.   Some poorly written binary device drivers will wreak
havoc from within kernel space - Greg has a good point that stability
will suffer.  In other words, welcome to Windoze!  But users like
Carla and I are demanding drivers for Linux, closed binary if that 
is the only available option, and it should be our concern if we
trade off stability for increased functionality.  A brick is very
stable but not very versatile.

Yesterday I was building a kernel.  I did the usual:

  $ cd /src/linux-2.6.15.6
  $ cp ../linux-2.6.15.5/.config .
  $ make oldconfig
  $ make
  $ su
  # make install
   ...

And the "make install" as root rebuilt everything.  Sometimes it
rebuilds everything, and sometimes it doesn't, and I haven't figured
out why.  Anyone know?  

A possibly irrelevant detail is that I initially built with "make -j4"
(this is on an SMP box).

Do you clean your build tree first? If you have old config, object, and 
dependency files lying around from previous builds, it will use those. Do 
'make mrproper' first to start from a pristine state. Somewheres in your 
Makefile it tells you what 'make mrproper' and 'make clean' do.

I think "packet writing" is a different filesystem--UDF.

I don't know the layout of an iso9660 filesystem, but since the ISO  
is a set size and it contains both the metadata and the data  
together.  I'd imagine, there isn't any free space in the filesystem  
to write new metadata or data to....

If you have the disk space you can make a new changed iso file by:
mounting the iso
Copying the data from the iso to a writable filesystem
Making the changes to the copy
Run mkisofs to make a new iso

Subject: [PLUG] Vonage...
Message-ID: <1141774052.440e16e4984b5@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Recently, my friend has switched to Vonage and she uses it over
cable.  It works well now that she has a local number.  Question,
how different are the regulations considering that Vonage is
VoIP based compared to a telephone line from the local bell?
Specifically, is privacy a problem with VoIP service?  A VoIP
phone doesn't require a specific phoneline, so how do 
the line tapping rules apply?  Major plus of Vonage, it's 
cheaper than CenturyTel's service out here in Scappoose.

Can Linux establish a dial-up ppp connection over Vonage?
Why does Vonage offer add on fax service?

One problem with her Vonage router, it's hiding her global ip
address from her.  Uge!  If she doesn't know it, she can't send
it to me over the Internet.  I offer limited access, her ip
address only, to certain services in an effort to keep those 
services private.

I set up EasyTCP so she can send me her ip address manually.
I only wrote a client for Fedora, I haven't given my friend a
Windows client.  I have a hunch that I can get the connection
source via EasyTcp and that there's a way to tunnel the session
via ssh, but how do I do ssh under Windows XP?  I've never 
installed perl to Windows XP either.

I wish Comcast would tell people what ip block their dynamically
assigned ip addresses are going to come from.  I also wish that
Comcast would stop arguing that dynamic assignment of ip addresses
makes managing their network easier.  I have a static subnet on
DSL, why is this so hard to get for cable?  Static assignment can
be done by dhcp.  If I could get her on a static ip,
I wouldn't have to monkey around to determine her current address
dynamically.

In a nutshell, I can either find a new way for my friend to determine
her global ip address from her end or I can focus on securely receiving
a message on my end so I can determine her global ip address.  Both 
approaches allow me to ip limit entry to a specific service.


If anyone knows how to serve a simple web page that tells you the
ip address that is connecting to it, that would be a good start.

The privacy is worse with Vonage.  The audio traffic can be captured
while travelling over the Internet since it is not encrypted.  Vonage
is subject to the new Internet wiretap rules.  It can also be
wiretapped where it enters the POTS.

Modem connections aren't supported.  The adapters have special support
for fax pass-through.  They offer add-on fax service because people
want to continue to use their fax machines.

You don't have to use the Vonage adapter in NAT mode.  I put mine
behind my Linksys router.  I use a script which gets the outside IP
address from the Linksys' admin website and uses that to setup a
DynDNS name.  I am pretty sure there is an admin site for the Vonage
adapter which does provide the external IP address.

The dynamic IP address assignment from Comcast is pretty static.  My
cable modem has has had the same IP address for at least a year. 
Comcast wants to make it harder for people to host servers over their
connections.  I bet it is also much easier to confgiure dynamic IP
addresses for DHCP instead of static ones.

Since this is a pretty common problem, I bet there are Windows
programs which do the job of either accessing the router admin site or
going to website to find the external IP address.  Getting you the
address is probably the issue.  You might want to setup a dyndns.org
domain name and use that.

That is pretty trivial.  The CGI environment variable REMOTE_IP holds
the remote IP address.

Sorry, I left out that detail.  This is a clean untar'ing.  First step
is:

  $ cd /src
  $ tar xjvf /src_archive/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.15.6.tar.bz2
  $ cd linux-2.6.15.6
  $ cp ../linux-2.6.15.5/.config .
  $ make oldconfig
  $ make -j4
  $ su
  # make install

That's about as pristine as you are going to get.

I am printing from all of my linux boxes to a printer on a windoze box 
but I used Networked Windows (SMB) as the queue type on the Linux side.  
Remember that the printer must be "shared" on the windoze side so the

Does it also fail if you use make without the -j option?

I wonder if some sort of write cacheing is getting in the way of 
object files getting written to disk in the correct order.

   For those who care, the LyX developers officially released version 1.4.0
today. It's available from ftp://ftp.lyx.org/. Many new and eagerly-awaited
features added after 3 years of very hard work.

   There's a Mac OSX version someone built and put up there, and my

Eventually, the winduhs version will be available, too.

Could some one explain why you need to do this more than once?  Is
something in the chroot blowing away this link periodically? If so,
that sounds like the problem that should be fixed...

If it's an option, I'm pretty sure the UDF spec allows for writing to
the filesystem (hence, the packet-writing CDs are formatted UDF) -- I
have no idea if the kernel supports writing to UDF (reliably) yet,
though last time I checked (2.1.x) it was "no".

I'm guessing it is something different in the environment (different

time it is normal, where "make install" just does the install.
Mysterious.

I am down to my last 10 PLUG cards - it is time to print more.  This
time, I would like to pass the hat and pay Bill Ensley of Bear
Printing for his fine work - and lots more of it!

Should we take a new picture?  I think the old one looks fine, but
since we have gone a few months and nobody on there got assassinated,
perhaps some timid souls would like to join in a larger picture.

I have one reservation, though.  The last set of printed cards had the
time and place for the Linux Clinic on the back.  We stopped using
Riverdale High School soon after.   When we print new cards with Free
Geek on there, I don't want to lose that venue, too!  :-)

I will commit to $20 if I can PayPal it to Bill. That's because I can 
PayPal from a company account as a tax-deductible expense.

The pic is great. So what if it is a couple months stale? We're all 
more than a couple months stale.

Not a problem. Here's how you deal with stuff like that:

1) Draw a pentagram on top of your computer.

2) Place a candle in the center of the pentagram and light it.

3) Gather various Linux friends. Explain that the purpose of the 
assemblage is to ensure that we not lose the Free Geek venue. 
Join hands and dance around the candle chanting the text from 
Carmina Burana.

Is UDF distinct from ISO9660?

My understanding is packet writing isn't a filesystem at all, instead an
alternative mode of writing that works with optical media, instead of
conventional block-by-block which they apparently have problems with.

Mixing metadata and data is a trivial problem. XFS and ReiserFS do it.
This merely isn't conventional Unix filesystem design. This makes
performance optimization and filesystem integrity checking more
difficult, but if everything is behaving appropriately (no power loss,
no reset button) there are no problems. Simply differing set of
parameters to work within.

It's not AARP's fault if PeoplePC uses software that works only with
Windows, but it is AARP's fault if they strike a deal only with
PeoplePC.  You'd think it could broaden its horizons some.  I'm sure
there are lots of ISPs that don't use proprietary Windows-only software
who'd be eager to work with the AARP.

I'm surprised that there aren't more Mac-using AARP members annoyed
about this.  Perhaps people who can afford Macs in the first place don't
bother themselves with low-cost ISPs.

AOL is just as bad. They install their own networking stack over Windows', 
with the result that when you try to connect to a different network you can't 
do it. Sometimes you can surgically remove the AOL junk and reinstall Windows 
networking, but just as often it takes a complete reinstallation.

In addition to this, and whatismyip mentioned by Randy, and probably a
dozen others, Google's personalized homepage has a module you can ad
that displays your IP address.  It wouldn't surprise me if some of the
scads of other Web2.0-type homepages (Netvibes, Pageflakes, Microsoft
Live, My Yahoo, etc.) that are popular now have the same feature.  To
date, Google is the only one I've used.

Gentles,

I am looking for a tech who is familiar with Ubuntu Linux to consult
with on expanding the capabilities of my new Freekbox:

Ubuntu Linux 5.10
PIII 600 MHz
13 GB HDD
ATI 3d RAGE Video
PCI ethernet card (connecting with Comcast quite nicely)
Onboard sound
PCI Modem (I don't use it)

Things I need to add:

More Storage
A set of USB 2.0 ports to take full advantage of the external drives I
already have
DVD burning capability, faster the better
Better sound

Private notes appreciated

Not to deprive anyone a nice consulting opportunity but...

If you want to do it on the cheap, hit the FG store for a USB 2.0 card
(they often have them) and a nice Ensoniq or SB Live! card.  
Ask that lazy teen-ager playing games in the corner (hi, Sam!) for help
picking stuff out.

Also check the Fry's ads and the Sunday computer ads for a good deal on
a hard drive.  Look for Parallel ATA drives, not Serial ATA.

Then bring 'em to the Linux Clinic two Sundays from now on March 19 and
ask for help getting 'em working.

Also, if you don't have 512 MB on your box, I'd strongly recommend an
upgrade.

I wouldn't buy anything from Fry's... most of their stuff has been sold 
at least once before! Take a little trip to your local PC CLUB or ENU. I 
have bought over 60,000 worth of parts from pc club and have had very 
few things that were DOA. The guys out in clackamas store have a lot of 
knowledge with their parts. The only thing I would buy from Fry's is 
bulk cable and the like. Other than that, I agree with Aaron.

You can do it, though, just very, very slowly.  Shoot for 14.4 or slower.  I 
had to play around with my TiVo a bit to get it dialing up for guide listings 
again to figure that one out.

Thanks Frank,
    But I have realized that it seems to be more of a software on the
client side in this case for a start. I have updated my system and it
seems to have broken the CUPS configuration and I will need to get that
straightened out before I can progress any further.

DHCP client daemons typically move the existing resolv.conf to a
backup and create a new one with the DNS info from the DHCP server, so
they can restore the original later.  The hard link would have to be
maintained with the most recent file created by the DHCP client
daemon.  As it is, I would guess the 64-bit resolv.conf he created the
link from either got unlinked (deleted) or moved to a backup which
doesn't contain the right info and isn't used by the 64-bit
application environment.

I think the easiest solution is either what Aaron suggested (a FF
script wrapper that updates the link) or investigating if there's a
place in the networking scripts to insert a post-DHCP update script.

No, it isn't a filesystem, but because it works differently than the
disk-at-once or track-at-once mode that ISO9660 was designed for, it
benefits from a new filesystem.

This sounds like a great idea. However, I'm not sure which script to
edit. In /etc/network I have the following tree:

if-down.d
   postfix
if-post-down.d
   wireless-tools
if-pre-up.d
   wireless-tools
if-up.d
   postfix
run
   ifstate
interfaces (file)
options (file

Assuming it was the right file, I opened the if-up.d/postfix file in
gedit. Its contents are:

---------------------
#!/bin/sh -e
# Called when a new interface comes up
# Written by LaMont Jones <lamont at debian.org>

RUNNING=""
# If master is running, force a queue run to unload any mail that is
# hanging around.  Yes, sendmail is a symlink...
if [ -f /var/spool/postfix/pid/master.pid ]; then
	pid=$(sed 's/ //g' /var/spool/postfix/pid/master.pid)
	exe=$(ls -l /proc/$pid/exe 2>/dev/null | sed 's/.* //')
	if [ "X$exe" = "X/usr/lib/postfix/master" ]; then
		RUNNING="y"
	fi
fi

# start or reload Postfix as needed
if [ ! -x /sbin/resolvconf ]; then
	cp /etc/resolv.conf $(postconf -h
queue_directory)/etc/resolv.conf if [ -n "$RUNNING" ]; then
		/etc/init.d/postfix reload >/dev/null 2>&1
	fi
fi

# If master is running, force a queue run to unload any mail that is
# hanging around.  Yes, sendmail is a symlink...
if [ -n "$RUNNING" ]; then
	if [ -x /usr/sbin/sendmail ]; then
		/usr/sbin/sendmail -q >/dev/null 2>&1
	fi
fi
<sudo ln -f /etc/resolv.conf /chroot/breezy/32bits/etc/resolv.conf>
-----------------------

Not knowing anything about programming the text means nothing to me,
but I'm guessing I should just add my link command at the bottom and
resave it, like the above < > line that I added, right?

That's how I'm learning Linux. When I need to do something I take
the time to figure it out. Slowly but surely I add to my knowledge and
skills. Learning it on an as-needed basis automatically ensures that I
will learn things in order of importance. Except for a couple things,
that is -- e.g., firewalls and backups.

Each of those directories contain scripts to be run when if- changes.

if == interface

so,
 if-down.d scripts are executed when an interfaces goes down
 if-up.d scripts are ...

The names of the scripts tell you what system is being affected.

So don't edit the postfix file unless you want to change the behavior of postfix.

What do you want to do?  link/copy resolve.conf  so it would make sense (at least
to me) to create a file called resolve.conf_up_to_date in if-up.d

Why?

When the interface comes up you'll have your new networking environment, that's
when you want to make the change.  resolve.conf_up_to_date is a filename that
gives you a pretty good clue as to the script actions six months from now when
you've forgotten what you did.

All it needs to contain is:

  #!/bin/bash
  ln -f /etc/resolv.conf /chroot/breezy/32bits/etc/resolv.conf

sudo's not needed becuase the thing will be run as root.

Now, some error checking would be nice, maybe log a message stating whether or not
the action was successful.  I'll leave those modifications as an exercise for the
reader.

Subject: [PLUG] blurb: slackmatic package build system for slackware
Message-ID: <20060309122110.59635edf@alloy.copperisle.com>

The slackmatic project is a package build system for Slackware.
It is intended to make it easy to acquire, build and install
additional software in standard Slackware ".tgz" format.

See: http://www.slackmatic.org/

Features:

 * easy to use
 * simple, transparent build specification
 * BOIM: build once, install many
 * automates 100% compliance with Slackware package policy
 * supports use of dietlibc for many packages
 * distributed port repositories

The system is non-intrusive and relies on the standard Slackware
package management utilities.  The slackmatic system simplifies
package development by centrally scripting all the download,
checksum, patch, build configure, compile, and package creation
work--so you don't have to!

The project works with Slackware and all Slackware-compatible
distributions.

We recently surpassed our first 100 port milestone, including the
following repositories:

* "ahl"
Andreas Liebe's repo contains over 20 ports including the Opera
web browser and several multimedia toolkits and libraries.
The "ahl" repository is the first place to go if you are
working with audio/video applications on Slackware.

* "clear"
Charles Lear's repo contains over 30 ports including beagle,
rubrica, and many additional desktop apps.  Checkout the "clear"
repository for a great and growing resource to enhance your
Gnome desktop environment on Slackware.

* "guinix"
For server installations, the "guinix" repository includes most
of the djb suite of software from Daniel J. Bernstein, including
qmail, djbdns, and daemontools.  All software in this repo may
be built automatically with dietlibc for tiny, tight, fast, and
secure statically-linked executables.

* "wcm"
This repo includes postgresql, sqlite, dillo, sylpheed-claws and
other applications.

The project welcomes other contributed repos, which are very
easy to set up following the online documentation.  Let us
know about your own repository and help keep slackmatic growing!

The project was developed right here in Portland, Oregon.
I would welcome the participation of any interested PLUG
members.

Wayne,

   I'll take a look at this shortly. In the meantime, what does this give us
that checkinstall doesn't?

OK, did that. There is now a file called resolv.conf_up_to_date
containing the above two lines in /etc/network/if-up.d. I checked in
Konqueror and its properties shows that it's a shell script. I guess
that happens automatically to anything in that folder, because all I
did was save it there from gedit (had to launch gedit as root in order
to write to that folder).

Wait ... I just discovered something. In a terminal window I navigated
to /etc/network/if-up.d and did an ls command. It showed postfix and
resolv.conf_up_to_date. But postfix displayed in green, and
resolv.conf_up_to_date was just black and white. After more checking in
Konqueror I discovered that the difference was file permissions, plus
the "executable" box was not checked on resolv.conf_up_to_date. I shut
down and relaunched Konqueror with sudo, then changed the permissions
to match postfix, and checked the executable box.

Then, with root-gedit I opened resolv.conf in chroot and deleted the
entries under server, and resaved. And then I tried to go somewhere
with Firefox-32, and was satisfied when it couldn't go anywhere. 

At that point I figured I was ready to test the new script, so I shut
down and restarted. As soon as everything was up I launched Firefox-32,
expecting that it would work fine. It did not. I opened resolv.conf in
gedit and noted that the server addresses had not been replaced. So the
script didn't do anything. However, there were no error messages during
the boot process. And when I run the command from a terminal, as I have
been doing, it then adds the correct entries to resolv.conf in chroot.

Maybe I need to figure that out in order to see what is going wrong.

And figure out how to _ensure_ that the DHCP address and setting were put in place
before the script is run.

I purchased a used portable PA system that we can use to vanquish the
excessively loud air conditioner at Jax when presenting at Advanced
Topics.  Unfortunately, all I have that works well as a microphone is a
bulky handheld.  Good for Karaoke, bad for fumbling with laptops and
laser pointers and notes.

Does anyone have a wireless lapel microphone they would be willing to
sell that we can bundle with the PA?  I can get a new one from Radio
Shack for $50, but I would rather clear out somebody's junk closet.

Keith

P.S.  I also have a cheezy wired lapel electret-mike that works
sorta-kinda (not enough gain, works if amplified by a laptop),
but there is no sport in throwing tomatoes at presenters if they
are tethered and can't move fast ...

Many software packages are simply not checkinstall compatible. For
example, all of the djb packages, as well as many others.

On the other hand, slackmatic build scripts may be easily written to
cope with any possible source build.

Other benefits of slackmatic:

  * full and automatic compliance with Slackware package policy (binary
ownership, stripped binaries, gzipped man pages, etc.)

  * distributed port repositories: leverage the package build work
already tested by others

  * optional integration of Felix von Leitner's dietlibc: tiny
statically-linked executables, without the overhead of GNU libc

Subject: [PLUG] tee --rotate_if_exists mybatchapp.err ?
Message-ID: <4410CE51.50608@TemporalArts.com>

I am trying to find and/or create, essentially, an enhanced version of 
the "tee" utility
such that, when file mybatchapp.err already exists, the following command

$ mybatchapp 2>&1 | tee --rotate_if_exists mybatchapp.err

would first rotate mybatchapp.err (ala logrotate) to mybatchapp.err.1,
rotate existing mybatchapp.err.1 to mybatchapp.err.2, etc.

My goal is to have the LAST run of mybatchapp logged into the same, std 
name.
I have some scripts currently using temp files (ie logging into 
mybatchapp.$$.err)
but that builds up a lot of log files and makes it difficult to write 
log analysis scripts.

I'm trying to find/create a command-line utilty because I need to invoke 
this kind of functionaliy
from Perl scripts, bash scripts, and Java utilities.  All three let me 
easily output through a pipe into
such a utility.

If someone knows of such a utility (or combination of utilites), great.  
I thought I had used one in the past
but I can not find it.

If not, can anyone point me at the [ C | Perl | sh ] source for a tee 
like command which I can extend?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <4410D760.8050302@gmail.com>

I have a customer who has supplied me with several hundred spreadsheets
containing several hundred rows that contain interface statistics.

Unfortunately, it's in a really useful format like 44.21M or 0.356k

I want to convert these to bits.

I am wondering if sed can

recognize a field in the nature of ( ,44.21M,) and convert that value to
 ( ,44210000, )

I am not sure RadioShack still sells those $50 wireless microphones. 
I called all over to buy on a few weeks back and was not lucky.  They
told me they are discountinued.

You can get one at Fry's for about $70 that works pretty well.  Can
this be something we can jack into the podcast recording as well?

This shouldn't matter, as DHCP should only change /etc/resolv.conf, not
trounce on the symlink.  I think that is where you should be looking,
symlinks don't break because the contents of the file changes.  I do
have a question, what is your 32bit resolv.conf when the symlink is
broken?  Something must be breaking it.

Good luck,

He's using a hard link, since a symlink would not be able to cross the
chroot environment.  Hence the complication.

Ok, every night at 8:05 pm I get a phone call.
It's from 727-569-1515 .. if that's the real info. When I answer it 
immediately disconnects with no noise.

Googling that phone number brings up a bunch of .info pages, but they're 
all blank pages now. Calling that number results in zero rings, but the 
call is completed and it just sits there with no noise. I hung up after 
30 seconds.

Anyone have ideas about how I can crack this caper? Apparently this is a 
phone number in FL, if the caller id is correct. I'm don't think it's a 
dead relative, but you never know :)

I love a mystery.  OK, so a quick reverse number check with 411.com 
yielded the following:

"We're sorry. We did not find a listing for the phone number you entered.
* The phone number "(727) 569-1515" is based in New Port Richey, FL and 
the registered carrier is Us Lec Of Florida, Inc. However, due to number 
portability, some numbers have been transferred to a new service 
provider other than the registered carrier."

Next I googl'd **"Us Lec Of Florida, Inc."  and got:

*Based in Charlotte, N.C., US LEC is a full-service provider of IP, data 
and voice solutions to medium and large businesses and enterprise 
organizations throughout 16 eastern states and the District of Columbia. 
US LEC offers advanced, IP-based, data and voice services such as MPLS 
VPN and Ethernet, as well as comprehensive Dynamic T^SM VoIP-enabled 
services and features. The company also offers local and long distance 
services and data services such as frame relay, Multi-Link Frame Relay 
and ATM. US LEC provides a broad array of complementary services, 
including conferencing, data backup and recovery, data center services 
and Web hosting, as well as managed firewall and router services for 
advanced data networking. US LEC also offers selected voice services in 
27 additional states and provides enhanced data services, selected 
Internet services and MegaPOP? (local dial-up Internet access for ISPs) 
nationwide. For more information about US LEC, visit www.uslec.com.

So, these guys ara a VOIP provider.  My next stop would be to try one of 
their contacts, maybe this one:

Ft. Myers US LEC of Florida Inc.
Royal Palm Commons
Annex Building
1610 Royal Palm Ave.
Ft. Myers, FL 33901

Mr. Karl Bergstrom

Call or email Karl and ask him what the F is up.

Keep us posted . . .

Something like this might work for you.  Keep in mind that this is GNU cp
specific.

application | (cp --backup=t /dev/null application.log;tee application.log)

Perhaps there's an easier way to piece this together, but I think this will
work.

I'm not sure sed is the best tool for that sort of manipulation; awk 
or a general-purpose scripting language (perl, python, ruby) would 
probably serve you better. I think this snippet of perl is akin to 
what you want:

   tr/a-z/A-Z/;
   if ( /,([0-9.]+)([BKM]?),/ ) {
     ($num, $mul) = ($1, $2);
     $num *= 10**3 if $mul eq 'K';
     $num *= 10**6 if $mul eq 'M';
     $num *= 10**9 if $mul eq 'B';
     print ',', $num, ',';
   }

I'm probably missing something here, but why not just replace 'K' with
'E3', etc.?  Of course, as Pete pointed out, this won't work if K and M
are base 2.

Thank you for the clarification, I'm beginning to grasp the
complication.  To bad a hard-link to a symlink doesn't work, when I
tried this, the hard-link by-passed the symlink and linked directly to
the original file.

I think John's original idea is the best solution, create a script that
will create the link, then launch the browser.  This script could then
be placed in the command window for the launcher.

Nice lesson in linking files, thanks again.

Better yet, since CSV is such a horrible and fragile format (maybe your 
particular CSV doesn't have arbitrary linebreaks thrown in), use the 
spreadsheet directly.

  http://search.cpan.org/~hmbrand/Spreadsheet-Read-0.14/Read.pm

That's still only going to give you access to the formatted (displayed) 
values (I guess they are statically stored in most spreadsheets.)  But, 
it should be more robust than dealing with csv.  It comes with xlscat, 
which makes a good example to crib off of.  Works on sxc, xls, etc, and 
even csv if you only want an abstraction layer.

That's what I started to do, although without an actual script. I just 
wanted to concatenate the update link command and the 
command to launch Firefox. Unfortunately, I'm using Gnome, and I 
can't figure out if there is a magic character that tells Gnome "after 
this is a second command." I can update the link and launch 
Firefox simultaneously in the command line by putting a semicolon 
between the update link command and the command to launch 
Firefox. But if I do it in the drop-down application menu it doesn't 
work. I googled and couldn't find the answer.

I thought of doing this because even n00bie me could understand 
what I was doing. Plus, when I go to PSU I always have to launch 
Firefox in order to bring up NoCat and log in. However, now that I 
have an icon that just runs the update link command, I think it's 
actually a better solution. I have to update the link always when I 
change locations. But when I come home I am on ethernet to the 
cable and there is no NoCat. Hence, I don't really need to launch 
Firefox -- in fact, I usually don't. Instead, I need the net for 
streaming radio, which means RealPlayer, which is also in chroot. 
So having the icon do the update link command without launching 
Firefox is turning out to be a better idea anyway. 

On the other hand, if I could figure out how to do it for Firefox I 
could duplicate it for RealPlayer. After all, those are the only two 
internet apps in chroot. But sometimes the effort required to figure 
out how to do something is too great considering the benefit 
derived from the solution.

Now, if I could just get the update link command to type my 
password in for me, I would have it reduced to nothing more than 
one click. :)

Thanks to all for the discussion. :)

To add to the perl "don't reinvent the wheel" mantra, there are several
other options places where someone has reinvented the wheel. Depending
on how you want to get at the data and what you want to do --

http://search.cpan.org/~jzucker/DBD-CSV-0.22/lib/DBD/CSV.pm - A DBI
driver for using SQL-like queries against the CSV file.

http://search.cpan.org/~tmtm/Text-CSV-Simple-1.00/lib/Text/CSV/Simple.pm
- Simple parsing of CSV text files.  The read_file method reads the
Whole Dang Thing into a big array of list references.  (You can
optionally use want_fields to filter out unwanted columns)

And http://search.cpan.org/~alancitt/Text-CSV-0.01/CSV.pm - the heavy
hitter of the above -- make sure you read the caveats at the bottom and
do any munging on your data beforehand if needed.

Once it's in IOwait you can't stop _that_part... check your interface
stats and you'll likely see it's still transfering the data.  Once
that is done (current/all data TX queue) it will exit.  Unfortunately,
if you killed it while it was sending you'll likely end up with a
portion of the the data in each location and possibly
missing/corrupted files.

Hindsight is 20/20, try rsync over SSH (or a piped tar) next time :)

Eli,

   If I correctly understand you, it's actually crawling the data over the
network and will -- sometime in the next week or two -- actually finish.
That's OK. I can live with that.

> Hindsight is 20/20, try rsync over SSH (or a piped tar) next time :)

   Yes. And foresight, too. I should have used cp (or scp) rather than mv;
that works like a charm. Then I rm the directory at the source.

Thanks,

Rich

BTW, if that's a large transfer over dialup or somesuch, you can pull
the same trick as with stale NFS mounts.  Depending on kernel/mount
options, you can add an entry for the hostname in /etc/hosts, set up
an alias for the IP on your loopback or ethernet interface, and
sometimes change your routing table so it catches it locally and
presto-chango you've got a dead NFS mount you were copying over :)

Sometimes you don't have to go through all of it to work...

Check out Cacti for using SNMP as a network monitoring/analysis tool,
though it's applicable to far more than just SNMP, network devices,
etc... And the net-snmp project on sourceforge for specifics of the
tools and usage.

Eli,

   No, it's local. I rebooted the destination host and that freed the
processes.

   I just tried 'scp -r ...' and the process hung on a specific file, so it's
probably a corrupt file.

Thanks,

Rich

Just a hunch, make sure it's not /var/lastlog... on most modern
distro's its a massive sparse file, which has to be handled specially.

Anyhow, peace.

   No. It's the plotutils-2.2 build directory.

1. Do you know what SNMP is, what it is used for or what an SNMP tool
might do?

2. Have you searched freshmeat.net and Wikipedia for "SNMP"?

3. It's not due Monday, is it?

Good luck on the report,

Your question #1 is actually what the presentation is to be about and to
consider what tools I would use if I were the administrator.

  I like Cricket.  It's a useful tool, except for the killer learning
curve to get it installed and running.

The big Open Source SNMP toolkit is Net-SNMP.  It *is* da'bomb.  It
can be a bit tough to use.  The documentation is a few releases behind
the code.

  I'm currently writing a custom NMS system that uses a lot of SNMP. 
It's my third major SNMP project.  Send me an email if you need any
pointers.  I can share some scripts for using "snmptrap", snmptrapd,
and how to write custom trap handlers.

Don't know what will happen in this mailing list if I attach a PDF, but here's a sign for the Clinic that I whipped out. It prints on two 11 x 17 sheets, so it comes to 22" high by 17" wide taped together. I'll mount it on both sides of an easel sign made out of some scraps of plywood I have. I'll print out several more and roll them up for posting on the walls inside Free Geek. I can drop them by Free Geek some time next week. But before I do that, any suggestions or objections to the verbiage?

   The battery on my cell phone lasts about three days -- on idle. The
charging cradle is attached to the computer because that cradle is also used
to synchronize it with jpilot on the workstation. I have automobile adapters
that will charge it while I'm driving, but this trip I'll be car-less.

   Can someone suggest a source for a wall-wart into which I can plug the auto
adapter so I can recharge the phone while I'm gone?

Any Radio Shack will have 12v transformers - they also carry 12v car 
sockets and female plugs for the transformer. 4 quick solder joints and 
your done. (BTW the Coleman Quick Heat does work very well for this type 
of job)

usb?

Seems like an extra step.  How could the phone be getting 12V over usb?  
The auto adaptor is likely a step-down DC-DC converter.

Plug the cradle into a powered usb hub?  If that's too clunky, the wall 
wart you want is probably 5V (check the output voltage on your car 
charger.)  Radio shack has a large selection of tips that are 
interchangeable with their wall warts.  Believe it or not, the output 
voltage is actually much more stable under load on their wall warts 
than the ones that get shipped with most gadgets.  I guess it's a 
better class of wall wart (they are quite a bit larger and than most 
and pricey.)

Thanks Steve, it would be nice if you have some pointers that I could use as
examples in my presentation. This is all somewhat new to me and is
interesting as I am in the process of setting up a couple servers for mail
and http, so I am hoping to learn some regarding the tools to help manage my
personal network as well as gain a stepping stone into the world of
technology.

I may be way off base here but it appears the primary DNS is set as the the
local gateway. Might try pointing to a different DNS Server.

DNS problem. It looks like you're not getting the domain name servers into /etc/resolv.conf. If you can go somewhere with an IP address but not with a human-readable name, that's a DNS problem. Open /etc/resolv.conf in a text editor and see what it says. Also, 192.168.0.1 looks like the IP for yourself. If I do a whois on the second one I get:

So it looks like the second one may be your domain name server. I don't know enough about how these things work to be of more help.

I set up a computer for a friend using FC4. It can get only get to some web

66.78.76.163, but not by typing http://www.portlanddocs.com.

This is a Qwest DSL line and Lunux determined the following settings at

Can any one tell me how to fix this?

I dont know if FC4 uses resolv.conf

but that sounds more than likely what it is

/etc/resolv.conf

nameserver 192.168.0.1
search had1.or.comcast.net.
domain Tnetwork

you just need to setup your nameserver info for your isp, ie DNS

I might expect to see a configuration like that if a firewall/router box is 
being used. I use a Netgear firewall box and its DHCP server gives out its 
local IP address for primary DNS when it gives out a DHCP assignment to a 
system on the local network.

I am not certain what is going to happen with Advanced Topics this
month.

I don't have a speaker.  I was planning on doing it myself. (I was
planning on speaking on wikimedia.)

Then the feces hit the rotating oscillating device.

It looks like I will have to find a new house fairly soon as my
negotiations with my current landlord are not going well.

Events make concentration a bit rough.

Suggestions for topics are welcome. 

I have things planned for upcoming months.  (Even stretching out to
November.  I may have a "big name speaker" for the November meeting, if
all goes well.)

I agree.  I have one of those qwest actiontec gt701's and it does the same
thing.  It passes out its own ip as the first dns server, then passes out
the second of the 2 ip's that you've set for dns servers.

The only way past it for me was to manually set the /etc/resolv.conf with a
true dns server.  Although if you leave the interface configured for dhcp it
may overright the resolv.conf file the next time your reboot the system and
put the 192.168.0.1 address back in there.  It that case you may want to
configure that adapter manually.

Subject: [PLUG] remote ssh and nat
Message-ID: <200603112254.55118.carla@bratgrrl.com>

All right NAT gurus, here's your chance to strut your stuff. I've always taken 
the lazy way to SSH into LANs. I make an iptables rule to allow SSH into the 
gateway box:

-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 --sport 1024:65535 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT

I ssh into the gateway box, then ssh from there to whatever LAN host I 
need to get into. 

To illustrate: remotehost is a remote PC on a different network. windbag 
is my gateway/firewall, and stinkpad is a LAN host. Windbag and stinkpad are 
on 192.168.1.0/24. Windbag has two NICs, wan and lan.

carla at remotehost:~$ ssh windbag.foo.net
carla at windbag.foo.net's password:
Linux windbag 2.6.12-10-386 #1 Mon Feb 13 12:13:15 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux
Last login: Sat Mar 11 17:07:24 2006 from foo-29.isp.net

carla at windbag:~$ ssh stinkpad
carla at stinkpad's password:
Last login: Sat Mar 11 17:07:50 2006 from windbag.foo.net

[carla at stinkpad ~]$

This works fine, and I don't have a pressing need to find a better way. But I 
was fiddling around and wondering, can I write rules that will let me log 
directly into stinkpad, or any other LAN host, without having to log into 
windbag first? Assume all LAN hosts have private, non-routable addresses.

I tried forwarding:

$ipt -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $WAN_IFACE -p tcp --dport 10000 -j DNAT 
--to-destination 192.168.1.12:22
$ipt -A FORWARD -p tcp -i $WAN_IFACE -o $LAN_IFACE -d 192.168.1.12 --dport 22  
-j ACCEPT

But this doesn't work, because all outgoing traffic is SNAT-ed, so the remote 
SSH client sees the same IP for all hosts, so when it sees a different host 
key it pitches a fit:

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@ ? ?WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED! ? ? @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!

I don't want to be continually replacing host keys, or disabling 
StrictHostKeyChecking. What other options are there? (besides putting 
everything on routable IPs)

$ipt -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $WAN_IFACE -p tcp --dport 10000 -j DNAT

Don't need a separate forwarding rule.

sorry, iptables is confusing enough!

Personally, I point multiple hostnames at my home IP, and then set up 
shell aliases to ssh using the right port/hostname for each box. 
Different hostnames = no more problem with ssh keys :)

I think there are two possible solutions using nothing more than ssh 
configuration settings. In ~/.ssh/config you can set CheckHostIP to no 
or set HostKeyAlias to 192.168.1.12 (or its hostname).

I think the latter approach is the one typically used for ssh 
tunnelling; it's what I use when ssh-ing from from off-site machines 
through my home firewall to internal hosts. See ssh_config(5) for 
details.

That may be a good thing in the future. I have already finished the
signs, and it didn't take me long. I made two easel signs, both with a
2 x 3 on the top so they can be hung over a door. In the spirit of Free
Geek I used leftover scraps of plywood. (See how I'm developing a Free
Geek attitude?)

I printed out the signs on my tabloid printer and taped them together,
then taped them to the plywood. They look pretty good, but after I
finished I realized I need some big pieces of clear plastic to cover
them with -- because eventually they will have to be left outside all
afternoon in the rain. Right now the paper is exposed. Does anyone know
where I could get some clear plastic like we use for transparencies,
but 17 x 22 inches?

I also made several more for pinning up on the walls inside. And I
remade the PDF as a letter-size sheet in portrait (attached) and
printed a bunch of those too. I plan to drop by on Sunday with the
signs and the cookies, then take off to study.

I found what I think is the best solution, thanks to the gang at Linuxchix. 
Well, actually the best solution is "use real IPs. Death to NAT." But that 
won't happen until Y3K, when IPv6 is finally implemented. :)

The trick is to use your ~/.ssh/config file. For example, you have two hosts 
behind your NAT firewall, host1 and host2. You need something like these 
iptables rules to forward ssh traffic to the correct hosts:

$ipt -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $WAN_IFACE -p tcp --dport 10000 -j DNAT 
--to-destination 192.168.1.12:22
$ipt -A FORWARD -p tcp -i $WAN_IFACE -o $LAN_IFACE -d 192.168.1.12 --dport 22  
-j ACCEPT

$ipt -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $WAN_IFACE -p tcp --dport 10001 -j DNAT 
--to-destination 192.168.1.13:22
$ipt -A FORWARD -p tcp -i $WAN_IFACE -o $LAN_IFACE -d 192.168.1.13 --dport 22  
-j ACCEPT

In ~/.ssh/config, write this:

Host host1
HostName me.mine.net (IP address works too)
Port 10000
UserKnownHostsFile ~/.ssh/host1

Host host2
HostName me.mine.net
Port 10001
UserKnownHostsFile = ~/.ssh/host2

Log in this way:

$ ssh host1

At your first login, you'll get the usual "The authenticity of host '1.2.3.4' 
can't be established" etc foo blah. Say yes, and it will create ~/.ssh/host1 
and copy the host key to it.

SSH tunneling is simpler to use, but it has its drawbacks. This gives you 
end-to-end encryption, more control, and I think more security, especially if 
you need to keep a tight rein on users.

Subject: [PLUG] eMail stuff
Message-ID: <4414AE99.2080404@frankhunt.com>

I am seeing some errors in my mail logs and need some help to figure out 
what to do about them.

First off, I see many like this: 

Mar 12 15:11:32 stingray sendmail[14123]: k2CNBGXE014123: 
someserver.somedomain.whatever [some IP address] did not issue 
MAIL/EXPN/VRFY/ETRN during connection to MTA

This seems to be somewhat of a "check engine" light in that it can mean 
many things most of which are blamed on the client.  How do I get more 
information on what is causing these errors.  I know that it can be 
caused by things like the client not responding quickly enough after an 
HELO or EHELO because I can make that happen via telnet to port 25.  
Some of these errors may be from mischief causers, but I know that some 
are from legitimate sources.  I also understand that errors of this type 
can be caused by the client not liking what the server says in response 
to a HELO.   I can't see anything in the logs even if I log sendmail at 
level 13.

I also see errors of this type:

Mar 12 14:51:56 stingray sendmail[12482]: k2B22cJB031809: 
to=<somebody at VERIZON.NET>,<somebody_else at VERIZON.NET>, delay=1+20:48:42, 
xdelay=00:00:30, mailer=esmtp, pri=7166125, relay=relay.verizon.net., 
dsn=4.0.0, stat=Deferred: 450 Requested mail action not taken-Try 
later:sv21pub.verizon.net

In fact, I can't send ANY email to anybody at verizon.net (including one 
of my accounts there).

I have attempted to contact Verizon's "support" but they are only open 
during the week.  If I ever do get hold of them, what should I be 
testing between now and then so I can pretend that I know what I'm doing?

Thanks,

Frank


BTW - I have tested with both sendmail and postfix and get the same errors.

The latter may not be as evil as the former, but it is still fairly evil.

IPv6 is implemented, just not yet universally. I believe some ISPs in the
PDX area do in fact allow you to send IPv6 directly on their networks.

So close to what you really wanted. Set HostKeyAlias to the hostname that
is the end point. You'll no longer need separate known hosts files.

Another trick is that known hosts files are mappings of IP addresses to
keys, but that need not be unique. Important for round-robin DNS names
is you can have the same hostname match multiple keys. This is not
appropriate for this case as you prevent SSH from verifying that you're
connecting to the appropriate host (your gateway could MitM you, and
you'd never known).

It is pretty darn simple to create the file yourself and add the
appropriate line. Crucially, yet again you can be sure you're not getting
MitM'ed by a malicious router.

SSH tunneling also gives you end-to-end security. Very definitely better
security that the scheme you've been using because your password is never
present on your gateway machine. Also allows for the paranoid case where
you don't even want to forward packets without some flavor of
authentication. You can just as easily do iptables fun in the OUTPUT
chain, rather than the FORWARD chain.

Portland Linux/Unix Group Advanced Topics

Topic: The Guts of Perl (and why you should care)
Presenter: Eric Wilhelm

Date:               March 15th 2006
Time:               7:00pm - 9:00pm

Location:           Jax 826 SW 2nd Ave
                    Portland, OR

Briefly covering:

(roughly) What the perl interpreter does when you throw a program at it.
How perlguts and compiled extensions work. How to peek into perl 
internals with Perl code. How this knowledge is useful.

Agenda:

  * Overview of perl's parse, compile, run process.
  * Possibly some mildly off-topic bits about XS, perlapi, etc.
  * Tour of the B:: modules.
  * Comparisons between B and PPI approaches.
  * Example code, case studies, and esoteric observations.

Applications:

  * Mechanically analyzing readability and refactorability of Perl code.
  * Design patterns and optimization insights.
  * Better understanding of what is under the hood.

Usual meeting rules apply.

...thus showing that one has to read every word sometimes. I ment setting
StrictHostKeyChecking to anything other than the default "ask" or "yes"
is *really* evil (people have been MitM'd for less), while setting
CheckhostIP is merely evil. OTOH setting HostKeyAlias is exactly what is
needed here, and isn't evil at all.

A little of both.  It's a reference to The Matrix.  D?j? vu is caused by a 
change to one of the matrix's parameters in that movie.

old fashioned i feel knowing how something works makes
one a better user of what ever it is.

I am going to be giving a short presentation to 20 people on Why they 
should use Linux instead of Windows. They are students. Is there 
anything else I should include? I have stats for proof of numbers

Overview of Linux and Windows

   1.

      cost

   2.

      software

   3.

      infections

   4.

      usability

   5.

      support


Cost (for 25 systems)

   1.

      Windows

         1.

            home version $2500 ($100 per 1)

               1.

                  office = 12,500 ($500 per 1)

         2.

            pro $37500 ($150 per 1)

               1.

                  office = 12,500 ($500 per 1)

         3.

            server $37,000

               1.

                  office = 12,500 ($500 per 1)

   2.

      Linux

         1.

            home users $0 to ?$70

         2.

            professional $0 to ?$100

         3.

            Server $0 to ?36,000

   3.

      Why the cost difference?

         1.

            Licensing

               1.

                  Windows pc's must have ind. Lic.

               2.

                  Linux very limited lic.

                     1.

                        Most distro's do not have lic.

Overview: Total cost of ownership is higher because Microsoft Windows 
cost more to obtain software, remove infections and support. Linux TCO 
is lower because it is inexpensive to obtain, programs support are free, 
and Linux cannot be infected with malware, spyware, virus, or malicious 
code.

I'm sad that you can't make it (I think.)  This particular talk has 
already had a thorough heckling by chromatic.

Hey, you can always podcast your heckling of the podcast.

Just a thought, but I believe that Linux could be infected with malware,
spyware, viruses, and malicious code if it were created for Linux. Is this
an incorrect thought. I may be totally incorrect as Linux does not use
executibles as Windows does, but it does seem possible that it could be
infected although much more difficult than Windows

ok, that didn't make it through very well...

Overview of Linux and Windows
1.cost
2.software
3.infections
4.usability
5.support

Cost (for 25 systems)
1.Windows
1.home version $2500 ($100 per 1)
1.office = 12,500 ($500 per 1)

2.pro $37500 ($150 per 1)
1.office = 12,500 ($500 per 1)
3.server $37,000
1.office = 12,500 ($500 per 1)

2.Linux
1.home users $0 to ?$70
2.professional $0 to ?$100
3.Server $0 to ?36,000

3.Why the cost difference?
1.Licensing
1.Windows pc's must have ind. Lic.

2.Linux very limited lic.
1.Most distro's do not have lic.
2.Most distro's can be installed many times

Software

2.aol
3.virus
4.adware
5.spyware

3.Purchasable software
1.ranges from $0-$0000


2.Linux

2.Purchasable
1.few that are charged

Infections
1.Windows
1.easily infected by
1.virus's
2.malware

1.cross os standardization of applets
2.very few changes between OS
2.familiar
1.the widest used operating system
3.easy to update
4.Difficult to upgrade w/o loosing apps and docs

2.Linux
1.vary naming scheme
1.some distro's call things by different names
2.packages are not hiding in sub applets like windows
1.add/remove programs is hidden in control panel
3.choose many different window management
1.xfce (menu based, very fast)
2.fc4 (menu based, very fast)
3.gnome (icon and menu, speedy)
4.kde (pretty icon & menu slightly slower > gnome, faster > xde)
5.xde (WinXP look alike slightly slower)

Overview: Total cost of ownership is higher because Microsoft Windows 
cost more to obtain software, remove infections and support. Linux TCO 
is lower because it is inexpensive to obtain, programs support are free, 
and Linux cannot be infected with malware, spyware, virus, or malicious 
code.

It's hard to make out what you're communicating from such a sparse outline.
Also, who is your (theoretical) audience--SMBs?  Home users?  Systems
administrators?  CIOs and technology buyers?  VARs and integrators?

My favorite in-depth report is: http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html

Also: http://www.bellevuelinux.org/reasons_to_convert.html

Have you looked at the OSDL's Linux TCO report?

You also need to include the cost of the equivelent apps.

With Windows, when you buy the OS you get a small number of apps.  (It 
varies depending on how you got it.  Some machines have additional apps 
bundled.) Anything beyond that is extra.  (And the prices can add up 
quick.)

Think about what it would cost to add

- An office suite
- C and C++ compilers
- HTML editors
- Image manipulation software
- Server applications (html, mail, database, etc.)
- media applications
- CD/DVD burners

and so on...

To get the same types of software for Windows that comes with most Linux 
systems would be many thousands of dollars extra.  (Plus more everytime an 
"upgrade" comes out.)

When I first started with Linux, the argument was "there was no software 
for it".  Now there is too much.

It is possible to get ported apps for Windows, but you find that sometimes 
there are limitations due to lack of features in Windows.  (Lack of fork, 
weird threading model, lack of symlinks, weird case issues on filesystems, 
etc.)

It is quite possible.

They are much harder to spread, however.

Under Windows, the original assumption was that every user was the 
equivelent to root.  Not the case anymore, but so many of the apps need 
that sort of permissions to run that it is still the case on far too many 
systems. (MS Word for a very long time required the ability to modify 
system binaries in order to run.)

With Linux, users are not allowed (unless you do something stupid) to 
modify system binaries.

Aaron,

Thank you. I will look at the reports asap. I am speaking to college 
students (at CCC)...  I do not want to make it too complicated. I will 
be giving them the Ubuntu disk set.... wish I had the newer set, but I 
only have the older set. The main theme that I want to communicate to 
the users are:
1.cost ~~cheap to get and use
2.software ~~more software for free
3.infections ~~no virus worries or malware spyware
4.usability ~~easy to use and get used to
5.support ~~lots of help out there for free

The tendency in Linux/Unix is to store files and do process 
communication via open standards, while the Windows world tends to do 
so via unpublished or proprietary methods. (Note that "tendency" 
doesn't mean "hard and fast rule.") Open standards will allow you to 
work with your data more transparently and for a longer period of 
time.

The tendency in Linux/Unix is to emphasize tool building while Windows 
emphasizes tool purchasing (same note on "tendency"). Unless your 
process and data dovetail more or less exactly with a vendor's idea of 
the same, it'll be much easier to get *your* job done on a Linux box.

Not only is the cost of any individual Windows host probably 
higher than its Linux counterpart, so the cost of administering 
multiple machines higher in the Windows world. Remote, scaleable 
administration tools are typically included with Linux, while decent 
remote-administration tools are usually an additional cost in a 
Windows infrastructure.

Windows or Mac OS X is probably the better choice when

a) you absolutely need bleeding-edge hardware;

b) all you want to do is assemble what loosely may be termed
    "documents": word processing files, multimedia presentations,
    spreadsheets, audio/visual streams, e-mail messages; these apps are
    for the most part more mature on proprietary platforms;

c) you need to work and play well with an IT department that only
    supports proprietary operating systems;

d) you want to be able to play the latest and greatest games available
    for purchase in consumer electronics stores.

What kind of students? High school? University? Do they have things in common, like all are physics majors, or something?

In my estimation you'll get a more positive reaction if you tell them what they want to hear. They'll try to tune you out if you tell them something that *you* want them to hear. Learning is all in the motivation. So is behavior modification. 

So if they're all gamers, spend half the presentation time on games. Sell the sizzle, not the steak.

Christian,

   Don't forget the hardware upgrades, too. This week's issue of The Economist
contains the Technology Quarterly. In an article on flash memory and whether
it's a challenge to hard drives was a statement by Microsoft that the next
version of Winduhs will reguire at least 80G -- just for the OS! (Well, I
suppose that if all applications are part of the kernel that's justifiable.)

   Friends of mine who run/ran Winduhs used to buy new hardware with every OS
upgrade.

Pete is definitely right.  In fact, that's one of the main points of the 
"(and why you should care)" bit.

Anyone with some inkling of how programming works should be able to keep 
up (e.g. you understand that the CPU doesn't speak source code, etc.)  

Those who are unfamiliar with scripting and interpreted languages but 
know Solder/Assembler/C/C++/Java may be at a disadvantage when it comes 
to groking runtime.  But there should be enough info to bootstrap you 
into the concept.

If you've worked with python, ruby, or lisp (to name a few) you're 
probably qualified for at least a little educational heckling.

The talk was primarily designed for Perl programmers that want to know 
what is going on under the hood in order to become better users of 
perl.  There is also a fair amount dedicated to the analysis of Perl 
code with the aim of refactoring large codebases.  It has already been 
in front of a room full of Perl hackers, and I think it was educational 
for all involved.

But hey.  I'm flexible.  If only two people that know assembler show up, 
I'm sure it will still be fun.

This is completely dependent on what the person runs on the box.  This 
has *nothing* to do with Win vs. Lin.  I would say on average the system 
requirements are very close w/ any modern day OS in a general use role.

I'm on the Vista beta team (mainly because I like to keep up on new 
tech) and this statement is pure FUD.

One example.  I can run XP fine on a dual 333Mhz machine I have that 
just about croaks w/ Lindows.  CentOS is better on that machine but 
still no where near as responsive as XP.

Well I understand the basic execution path (???) of how really any
programming language eventually makes it to the CPU, it should be
enlightening ;). I'm sure 90% of it will be over my head. But I find when I
discuss programming with the "knowlaged" I always wonder about the how and
why something works so this should be right up my ally. It will make me a
better programmer in the long run anyway. maybe I'd be good at assembly ;).

More than anything you should always recommend the right tool for the 
job.  I think a better approach to what /you/ are trying to do would be 
to emphasize the strengths of Linux rather than try to push dogma on to 
someone else.

This may be true (to a point) for home users, but this is just not true 
as a blanket statement.  It requires context.  There seems to be this 
misconception that there are no ace admins in the Windows world.  On a 
corporate network it is nowhere near the problem it is with your 
neighbor if halfway properly maintained.  But I digress..

Look, go push Linux.  I like it and want more people to use it too.  But 
keep it real.  Things like learning it in a day is a world apart from 
learning half a dozen basic tasks, which is what you probably really 
meant.  Linux has no viruses or vulnerabilities and can't be infected by 
such?  C'mon!  That's an outright lie!  I could tear apart a lot more of 
your points (like Windows not having the *same* free support you speak 
of for Linux) as well but I just don't have time.

People have to know what they're getting into.  They need to know that 
many times Linux is work.  That you are rarely able to just download and 
install a program you need with Linux compared to the Windows way of 
doing things.  This is the perspective they'll be coming from, and if 
you don't speak on a level they can understand, then you haven't said 
anything at all.  You're pushed past advocate, through fanboyism and 
become an out of control train with some of what you say.

Hi,

TCO is only part of the argument. Money overshadow larger issues because 
it's quantifiable and it's money. Intangibles won the argument for me.

Open Source is fun. There is a community of people sharing the wealth and 
encouraging innovation. Nobody is trying to beat me up for license 
violations, push the latest $$upgrade$$, sell me add on stuff I don't want 
and hide the details I need to understand the systems. Don't forget, we 
have a penguin and they don't.

Open source is free. Like free speech, there is a larger world when you 
have choices and can make decisions that fit you best. In house developers 
have a new way of thinking. They can see and change source code. Network 
admins have a new world of resources. One Sunday morning my question to the 
Postfix list was answered by Weitse Venema, the author! There is a 
different culture for everyone involved in the organizations information 
systems which is difficult to appreciate until you've been there.

If you manage people, it's obvious that the most significant variable in 
the productivity equation is morale. Get out of the Microsoft gulag as fast 
as is reasonable and enjoy the fresh air.

Cheers,
Mike

While I totally agree that all advocacy should be honest and include 
full disclosure, this statement is at least a little off.

>That you are rarely able to just download and

Assuming that the "windows way" means stumbling across a website, 
punching in your visa# and downloading an exe, then yes Linux is not 
that.

But, Linux (the kernel) is a different beast than Windows (the OS), so 
you have to compare Distributions.

Installing packages with aptitude (on Debian (IME), and probably Ubuntu 
and Fedora) is almost always completely painless and o-so-much more 
convenient than dealing with exe installers.  I'm reminded of the 
semi-annual process of reinstalling windows and the hand-holding 
process of walking the system through the double-click, wait, click, 
wait, click, stand on head, reboot, click, reboot process of installing 
all of the third-party applications, not to mention setting up the 
desktop, hotkeys, start menu, and everything else that I get when I 
simply copy my home directory on a linux machine.

Installing from tarballs can be a real pain, but Windows gives you zero 
tools that can even compare to aptitude.  I'll also mention the fact 
that there is no semi-annual reinstall process with Linux.

Even Debian is not the "buy now", download-and-install experience, but 
only in the same sense that Mac is not that as much as Windows.  
There's no technical barrier in the way of vendors providing .deb 
packages, but there is a huge technical barrier to Windows apps being 
installed via aptitude.

I have not heard this 'misconception'.... maybe, ace admins think linux

If this is an outright lie, then you must know of a Linux virus... 
please state the source, so that I can find it. I have yet to find one 
that was not a false virus. Also, where can we get this live and 'free 
support'... I have looked but did not find anything. Many students are 
poor and would appreciate this information.

They can understand what these things are, as I will define them, virus,

Hi,

I don't use dynamic ip addresses privately because I don't understand how to
implement dynamic dns updates.  I'm afraid of the whole idea of letting
a computer, hopefully on the correct network, register a name in exchange for
a useful ip address.  Dynamic dns updating still looks experimental where it
is essential if you use dynamic ip assignment, unless you don't care about
being able to identify computers on your network by their ip address.
When you implement a firewall policy of computers are allowed out by 
specific ip address, you have to know which ip goes to which computer.
The other downside of dynamic ip assignment is that it becomes harder,
in the event of a dns outage for example, to ssh into a specific 
computer.

The other thing about dynamic ip assignment via dhcp, how do you network
boot a computer that has been given an ip address dynamically?

Long term, since the modem that I gave to my friend won't work over Vonage, 
I'll have to come up with another plan to provide her with backup Internet
access.  She lives close enough to me that a radio link should be possible.

Concerning Comcast's cost, why did Comcast rent her the cable modem if she
signed up for the service during a promotion that offered free cable modem
after purchasing it?  More disturbing, what is this FCC regulatory cost she
is getting nailed with considering that she doesn't have cable tv and
was told there won't be any taxes when she signed up?  Her cable bill
claims that there is a new FCC tax affecting all cable customers.

Subject: [PLUG] Cable laying permit...
Message-ID: <1142186973.441463dd1bc86@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

Google search string that missed totally:

Scappoose Oregon cable laying permits -RV

I'm curious what it costs to get the necessary permits to run your own 
cables along city streets?  Not that I can afford this now, but I am curious.  
Comcast obviously got permits to run their network thoughout Scappoose 
and St. Helens, what is the process for someone else to acquire similar 
permits?  If you are able to site some kind of line, do you pay property 
tax on it?

While competing with Comcast is obviously large scale, what about two people
who live down the street from each other that want a dedicated network?
Has anyone done a cable installation within a city block for a neighborhood
network?

Why do Comcast and the local phone company essentially have Internet Access
monopolies?  I haven't heard of any significant Comcast competitors in the
cable market, at least for Scappoose.  Satellite doesn't seem to be a decent
alternative for Internet because you usually have to have a phoneline to use 
it.  I know Starband offers a two way satellite, but this product isn't
Linux friendly and it doesn't impress me.  It was installed in a company
I worked for briefly, I think it's a Radio Shack service.

Why didn't the local cell phone companies when they put their towers in in
Scappoose start offering high speed Internet access?

Are telephone and cable services expensive because a small number of
players have their own private networks, or are other reasons more
significant concerning the high cost?

Say I want to run a high speed coax cable or phone lines from one end of
Scappoose to the other, what would this most likely cost?

I'm talking about something easy.  Updating Moz, or better yet getting 
java to work in it.  Look, these things may be easy for you and me.  But 
you don't just download the program to your desktop and run it.  There's 
more to it.  And when you bring in more than one distro it gets more 
diluted.  I don't even know why I have to say this.  You guys know this 
already.  What the heck do software purchases have to do with what I said?

Did you really try?

Let me quote you:

   1.cannot be infected with
   1.virus's
   2.malware

And emphasize your *cannot be infected*.  As if it's something no one

Well what free live support are you talking about exactly?  You mention 
IRC, chat groups, email, all under Linux but not Windows.  You imply it 
doesn't exist.  Now if you mean live as in Freegeek, fine.  But that's 
not exactly what you said.

You either need to re-read what I said or open your eyes.  I've said 
nothing that should require any sort of proving.  It's basic common 
sense.  You cannot claim Linux *cannot* be infected by viruses. You 
cannot claim Linux can be learned in a day.  That's an insult to your 
peers. You cannot claim all Linux software is free ("1.ranges from 
$0-$0000").  These are some of the things you claim that are flat not 
true.  IMHO, that is out of control.  I am not biased towards MS.  They 
wouldn't get another dime from me if I didn't have to be acquainted with 
their software to serve my customers.

Subject: [PLUG] iptables, dmz, public addys
Message-ID: <200603131402.54294.carla@bratgrrl.com>

hey all,

Here's the scenario:

Suppose I have a nice tri-homed Linux iptables firewall/gateway. Default 
filter table policies are:

$ipt -P INPUT DROP
$ipt -P FORWARD DROP
$ipt -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

My three network segments are 

wan 1.2.3.4
lan 192.168.1.1
dmz 192.168.2.1

On the dmz are a few public servers, the usual web, mail, ftp, wotever. These 
have public routable IPs. To correctly route incoming traffic to them, do I 
need only FORWARD rules? Like this:

$ipt -A FORWARD -p tcp -i $WAN_IFACE -o $DMZ_IFACE -d 1.2.3.44 --dport 80 -j 
ACCEPT

I don't want any DNAT or SNAT on the server IPs, I want to use their real IPs. 
The idea is to forward only traffic that belongs to the servers, and drop all 
the other junk at the gateway. (all them charming ssh attacks and ms sql 
worms etc. ad nauseum, thank you very much microtwits)

I'll have a limited bit of time for testing later this week, so I want to get 
it right the first time.

thanks!

The process is the same whether you are using a bootp server or a dhcp server (
as the dhcp server is required by RFC to support bootp requests).

Less than 2000 infections for all of the 'virus'. I can say that  Linux 
user will not have to ever worry about getting an infection... most of 
them were lab tests.

Most people only use a handful of programs. (Email, Browsers, 
OfficeSuites) These apps are easily transfered over from win to lin. 
Will they be able to grasp the changes in a day, and have an operating 
level of knowledge? I know they can have the same level as they have 
with win. I do not claim that all Linux software is free. Some is quite 
expensive, which is why I have 4 0's there. Also, it should be pretty 
obvious that I am not making this claim, as I state that linux corporate 
edition costs about $36,000 dollars for a certain version. HOWEVER, 
those that I am talking to will (more than likely) NEVER encounter this 
type of software. The software that they will wish to purchase will be 
game emulators, and the such. (I also noted it is something I had not 
considered in another email.) You may not be understanding some of the 
notation that I used. In that case there are others that are probably 
not reading it the way it is intended.

This outline is not finished by any means, merely a rough draft. There 
are some higher knowledge level issues that technically challenged 
people will have a VERY difficult time making it work... (Like a linksys 
wireless NIC).

I am not examining all differences between win and lin. I have 5 min. 
That is it. It will be just about impossible to go into some of the 
details with this kind of time frame, much will be overly generalized. 
(Probably, should have posted this first.)


Thanks for your response. I appreciate it very much. I will definitely 
give the best representation of Linux possible. Besides, the last thing 
we want are people installing Linux and expect everything to be the 
same, then become so frustrated that they are completely turned off to 
Linux. That would be counter productive. Again, thanks for your response.

There is? At least with Debian and its derivatives, Mozilla Firefox
(to use your example) is an "apt-get install firefox" away. And that's
it. It doesn't require any more configuration. As far as the average
non-technical computer user is concerned, I can't imagine they'd find
this procedure any more difficult than the usual point-n-click Windows
style of installer, which often asks them which components they want
installed, where they want to install the software, if they want
shortcuts placed here and there, etc. There are certainly plenty of
packages out there that are not of the install-and-forget variety, but
for the most part they're not the sort of desktop applications that
most people are going to care about.

You are thinking "building permit" when this is more like "bill in
Congress".  To run a cable through the city, you need active approval
from misc. agencies advising the city council.

Since this does not concern Linux, and gets into politics, it is
more appropriate for Plug-Talk, so I will provide a detailed answer
to your question there.

Subject: [PLUG] Gnome panel application launcher
Message-ID: <20060313204339.9ad7cc63.johnxj@comcast.net>

Any gnome users here?

I use KDar for backups. It may not be as user friendly and easy to figure out as I'd like, but it gets the job done. However, when I make a backup it refuses to back up lots of files and gives me error messages unless I launch it with sudo (e.g., "sudo kdar").

I can do this from the command line, but it's kind of a pain to have to open a terminal and type that every time I decide it's time to make a backup. I have a menu item for it in the application drop-down launcher in the Gnome panel, but when I change the launch command to "sudo kdar" it does not launch. I click on it and nothing happens. No error messages, no flickering screen, no disk drive activity -- absolutamente nada. It launches fine from the drop-down list if I delete the "sudo," but then it refuses to back up a lot of files.

Any ideas?

Never mind. Problem was Gnome expects "gksudo" in the application launcher, not just "sudo."

Thanks for the comment. I bought the one on eBay for $15 + $4 shipping.
It's 512 MB and slightly used, but it will get me by for quite a while.
More importantly, it's not worth more time shopping to get a slightly
better deal. Now I can get back to work. :)

And there is a good reason for this.

Windows has access to the video card hardware acceleration.  

X does not.  (At least not at the level where it is needed.)

There are a couple of reasons for this.  Microsoft has information that
allows them to have drivers that make use of this information, where X
does not.  (Due to the proprietary limitations on 3d graphics
acceleration.)

This is changing however.  XGL is being worked on.  I have played with
the beta and it is as fast and responsive as any Windows product, if not
faster.  And that is with FULL eye candy mode turned on.

Want to see something cool?  Take a look at
http://getkororaa.com/#download .  It is a bootable live Linux distro.
It is .01 beta, so don't expect rock solid stability.  You will want an
nVIDIA or ATI card to run it.  (Preferably nVIDIA.  Some models of ATI
have problems.  But I repeat myself.)

Expect to see Linux pass Mac and Windows in the eye candy department
within the next few years.

Fast is always nice, but hold the eye candy, please. One of the things that I love about Linux is that my desktop doesn't look like a set from the Teletubbies.

And you can turn it off.

Actually the eye candy on xgl is pretty functional. There are a couple
of bits I really like.  (Zoom and some of the window effects.)

It is also a way of making Windows and Mac users think of switching to
Linux.

The capabilities of the system and the tastes of the graphical
designers are completely independent of each other.  Just because XP
comes with a Cartoon Network theme by default doesn't mean the
graphics capabilties it provides wouldn't look amazing in the hands of
a talented artist.

What's wrong with the OSX look?

Personally, I wouldn't stress this point very much, the reason being
that there is so much quality freeware available for Windows, in all
those categories (with the possible exception of C/C++ compilers -- I
have no idea, never used one).  Back when I was using Windows, at some
point I made a decision to start preferring OSS over proprietary
software.  Over the course of a few months, I dropped every closed
source app I was using in favor of OSS "equivalents."  "Equivalents" in
quotes because, in fact, the OSS was in almost all cases better than the
proprietary software I'd been using.  Really, I think the only software
I was sorry to abandon was Xnews, which remains the best newsreader I've
ever used (alas, Windows only -- freeware, but not open-source).  It was
the success of this experiment that led me to Linux eventually.  I
figured if all the OSS was better than proprietary software on Windows,
than probably an open-source OS would be better than a proprietary OS
like Windows.

Also, there are superb resources for Windows users looking for freeware,
whether open-source or not.  The newsgroup alt.comp.freeware is great,
and it maintains the Pricelessware list of the best freeware, almost all
of which runs on Windows.  And there is some excellent open-source
software on Windows that just doesn't have any equal on Linux -- for
instance, foobar2000, the best damn audio player on the planet.  BSD
license, but only works on Windows.

I think it would be a mistake to pretend that you have to spend lots
more money on software once you buy Windows.  Actually, I think it would
*be* a mistake to spend more money on software if you're running
Windows, unless you have specialized needs (in which case, you'd
probably *have* to run Windows anyway).  The best stuff is free, and
that includes security apps like anti-virus and firewall software.

I wish more Linux advocates would stress the utility and all-around
awesomeness of OSS, even on proprietary platforms like Windows and OS X.
I think people would be more likely to dip their toes in the OSS world
if they were encouraged to do it from the comfort of their existing
OSes, rather than exhorted to switch OSes and deal with all the
potential for hardware hassles that exist.  Many, of course, already
have, with Firefox and OpenOffice.org.

Installing Linux *can* be easy, but it isn't necessarily easy.  Every
day on the various Debian mailing lists there are dozens of pleas for
help with various and sundry pieces of hardware that don't "just work."
But any Windows user can install Firefox or foobar2000 or CDex in 30
seconds flat, and be introduced to OSS.

There are several good shell replacements for Windows, some of them free
and open-source.  I used BB4Win (Blackbox for Windows) well before I
started using Linux.  I used another one for awhile -- can't remember
the name -- that was developed by a nice guy in Australia.  Incredibly
simple and lightweight window manager.  Windows XP runs so much better
when you don't load Explorer!

And on OS X, you can install X11 (Apple's own implementation, or via
Fink or OpenDarwin) and use any number of X DEs or WMs, including Gnome,
Fluxbox, etc.

And of course, a lot of KDE (and some Gnome) users under Linux spend a
great deal of time trying to get those DEs looking and working like OS
X.  And IceWM is a conscious effort to emulate the look and feel of
Windows 95.

Really, the notion of the desktop being tied to the OS is *so* 1994. :-)

Yeah, I'm familiar with ELI, but none of their services are
consumer-oriented.  Perhaps it's not what Elliot meant, but since we
were talking about Carla's DSL, I assumed there were consumer-level ISPs
that provide IPv6.

Subject: [PLUG] Hosed rpm database...
Message-ID: <1142319402.4416692a16eb0@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I accidentally used the P option to tar improperly again and started hosing
/var on a Fedora Core 3 system.  Forunately, I stopped the command and this
system obviously still works.  Question, is there any trick to rebuild the
rpm database?  I untarred a Fedora Core 1 var image partially over my /var
directory.  I'd love some tips to find out what files were overwritten by
my mistake.  For starters, I can output tar's messages to a file and kill
the command when it gets to var so I can tell what files are likely to be
broken.

It would be sweet with a local copy of the archive to see which files 
on my main system match the files in the copy exactly.

Silly question, but why don't the security enhancements of SE Linux protect
against clobbering /var, /dev, /etc, etcetera?

If anyone is wondering, I was trying to untar a system so I can NFS root
boot it off of this machine.  Frustratingly enough though, this is the
second time I've partially corrupted the host system.

It would make an awful lot of sense for Fedora to have a tool to rebuild
a list of what's installed from the rpms themselves.  There should be a
special installation option where rpm determines for a binary package if
that package is installed to the system already, even if the local rpm
database under /var is trashed.

I have Avast! installed on my wife's laptop, been great so far except
it sure is annoying when it announces "Virus database has been
updated!"  You do have to register with them, but I've never gotten
any email from them other than the initial license key.

And FC4 shipped an installer image that didn't boot on a very common
Intel-based system without kernel command-line voodoo magic.  Linux
distros are created by humans, and they make mistakes.

SquirrelMail is pretty good and quite popular.  I use it on all my
webmail setups.  Some of the plugins are quite useful.

It works especially nicely with the Dovecot IMAP daemon.

FWIW, sudo expects input on stdin (standard input), which is not
typically available with a gui launcher.  One way to debug these
things is to tell the launcher to use a terminal (in gnome,
right-click on launcher -> properties, check "Run in terminal").  That
should show you what's up. gksudo is a gtk wrapper around sudo (which
you probably figured out.. in any case, that is the right way to go
about it :).

Unless rpm has seen major improvements since I did the same thing years 
ago, there is only one way to rebuild the rpm databases:

Use rpm to reinstall everything.

Supposedly there is a way to rebuild those databases that involve convoluted 
incantations & sacrificing virgins to unspeakable gods -- which is 
documented somewhere on the rpm mailing list. Tried it, it didn't work 
for me. Bleh. Next time I need the help of unspeakable supernatural 
beings, I'll just stick with a more mainstream vendor like WinTentacles 
or Crawling-Chaos-R-Us.

FWIW, if this makes you want to commit violence against someone at Red Hat, 
I'll understand.

Before you try that, try

rpm --rebuilddb

If that gives you errors, you may have stale lock files.  I will have to 
figure out where they are.  (It is easy to do.)

If the db is totally unrecoverable, you will need to reinstall after 
making a fresh database.

One thing I've never been able to do with a Lexar is make it bootable
(such as DSL), which is easy to do with the SanDisk Cruzers.  If you
don't care about that then the Lexar JumpDrives are nice as well.

I used web mail for a while - I got annoyed with it because it was
slow and I was already used to mutt.  So instead I just improved my
ssh setup, and added mindterm so I can make ssh connections from just
about any java-equipped browser.  Especially as I have ssh listening
on port 80 of my alternate IP address, so I can get past port blockages.

OTOH, I hate it when somebody hijacks a thread and changes the 
subject, and it appears I just did it.  The offending web mail app
was "twig", and it choked on the thousands of mail folders I have
collected over the years.  I hope squirrelmail is better than that.

I am using Kororaa at the moment, so I could not look at the specific

Oh really?  I took a CD-based distro and got it booting from my Lexar. 
It took a fair amount of work, but it *is* working.  :-)

Christian,

   Thank you. I bought the 1500mA model because the car charger plug notes
that its output is 1200mA. That's certainly higher than I would have
expected, but what the heck. The phone charges in vehicles, so this will work
the same way.

Subject: [PLUG] Recovering as much as I can...
Message-ID: <44173637.5080908@axpr.net>

My laptop hard drive died on me.  I have a complete backup from when I 
installed the drive in September, but would rather like to get some of 
the data I had sitting on the drive if I can.  I haven't lost anything 
critical... just a few, "oh shoot, I'll have to try and get that phone 
number again" type pieces of data I had sitting in IM logs and whatnot.

The drive boots the Linux kernel but errors with UnrecoverableError 
messages as it attempts to mount the filesystem (ReiserFS 3).  This 
leaves me unable to get ANYTHING as everything was in the single FS
(of course).  So I ask... what would you guys try and do to try and
get some of the data off the drive?  There are tools, I think, that
will skip over the sections that error out on me, to try and get as
much of the data off as possible, but I've not used them before and 
don't know for sure how I'd then try and get data off the partially 
damaged filesystem image... last I read, Reiser wasn't exactly well 
known for their recovery tools.  :-\

Again, it's not a huge deal if I lost the data... I'd just like to try 
and see what I can get off the drive before I RMA it back to Seagate - 
it is under warranty until July of 2010.  :-)

Boy this is a complicated question, the simplest answer is that the average
joe, just can't. Even big companies that want to run their own dedicated
lines from office to office  *can't*  you basicly have to go through a telco
at some point. They are the ones that own the rights to the utilities and
they don't just let every joe, bob and harry rig their own lines on their
equipment (yes, telephone poles are considered equipment) My suggestion
would be to get some cheap DSL at both locations and set up a VPN between
them, that will give you the privacy and reliability you need at a cost you
could probably manage.

*Shameless Plug* For Scappoose DSL I know that Opus:Interactive has DSL
service in the Scappose Area, I used to Intern for them a few years ago,
they are a great bunch of people so I have no shame in pimping some business
their way. They're also a local company so that is a + in my book
too.//Shameless Plug//

Laying line is generally left to the "big boys" these days, Verizon, Level3,
AT&T, Qwest...

Even in the long run you would proabaly never recoupe the cost of laying
your own line verse leasing a high speed line for a long period of time.

While competing with Comcast is obviously large scale, what about two people

Comcast Already had the infustructure in place they have just upgraded it to
allow cleaner  signaling and such...

Why do Comcast and the local phone company essentially have Internet Access

Basicly because they owned the lines WAY before anyone else and they've
managed to keep control of them wether that is a good thing or not is
debateable but really not "on-topic" for the purposes of this discussion.


I haven't heard of any significant Comcast competitors in the
> cable market, at least for Scappoose.


That is because they don't exist. Comcast owns the cable lines that run to
your house, and have thus far successfully blocked out any other provider
from using their lines to provide service. No competition makes life easier
for comcast. (It also makes our cable bill $109...)

Starband and DirectWave both have 2 way Sat now, the biggest issue with Sat
Service is latency, It takes a long time to go from Ground to Sky to
Ground(NOC) to Internet to NOC to Sky to Ground. (it's a lot of hops...)


Why didn't the local cell phone companies when they put their towers in in

They are upgrading the cell networks to carry more and more data but when
they were constructed their main focus was (and still is) to carry as many
customers per cell tower as possible, and for the cell providers voice data
(as it should) takes precidents.

Maintaining such a vast and complex network is extremely expensive, unlike
our home networks where we install a router, get our computers online and
don't think about the broad network beyond the jack, the infustructure
behind that jack needs to be constantly upgraded and maintained.

I'm curious.  How did you go about making your SanDisk drive bootable?
I managed to turn my SanDisk into a readonly device while messing with
boot images.  Do you write the bootable image to the raw disk or to a
partition?

Sygate personal firewall is what I use on my Windows 2000 
desktop. What I like about it is 1) unlike ZoneAlarm, it seems to 
have no bugs and evil interactions with the rest of my computer, 
and 2) even a doofus like me can figure out how to configure it, and 
3) I can stop any application from being able to get out to the net. 

The last item is really handy in this age of monopolistic software 
companies wanting their products to phone home all the time. 
Currently all Adobe products are blocked, as is Quickbooks and 
Internet Explorer.

I've used it for a long time and have never had a virus. Of course, I 
also know better than to open a file in an e-mail unless I use 
something safe. E.g., if someone sends me a Word file I'll open it 
in OpenOffice.org Writer.

Where I feel more vulnerable is with my Ubuntu-64 laptop. At home 
I am behind a router, and I did install Firestarter. But I have no idea 
how to configure Firestarter beyond the standard installation. It 
worries me when I connect at some wifi hotspot, especially places 
like coffee shops.

I have to step back and admit that my SanDisk is currently booting
DOS, not Linux.  That was accomplished using HP's tool over at
http://h18007.www1.hp.com/support/files/hpcpqdt/us/download/20306.html.
 The tool says it is for HP devices, but it works on many others
AFAIK.

Someday when I am feeling particularily smart I would like to get grub
working on the SanDisk, so I can boot whatever I feel like.  Today I
am not feeling so smart.

Yeah, I knew about telling the application launcher to use a 
terminal. That is how I made my little link command work. The 
command is 

sudo ln -f /etc/chroot/breezy/32bits/etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf. 


It wouldn't work by clicking on the launcher entry until I told the 
launcher to use the terminal. 


However, now that I know about gksudo I tried it, and unchecked 
the "use terminal." I expected that this would pop up the pretty GUI 
window asking for my password instead of a terminal asking for my 
password. However, it did not. Nothing happened. It just didn't work 
at all. 


Oh well, changed it back to "sudo" and "use terminal." I'll figure out 
the why of this some other day.

I bought one of two they had at the Washington Square Radio Shack. 
There are also two at the Beaverton Radio Shack.  The Radio Shack
website lists the local stores that have it, so you can also try
Lloyd Ccenter or Jjanzen Bbeach.  Item number 32-1257 .

I think so.  The wireless unit has two outputs,  a 1/4" microphone
jack and an RCA line jack.  The PA sounds better off the RCA jack. 
The PA has a second speaker output, also a 1/4" phone jack.  So
either build an RCA splitter from the line jack, or else connect
to the 1/4" speaker or microphone outputs.  Let me know how you
would like to connect, and bring the appropriate cables to A.T.

So ... presenter's laptop, projector, PA, wireless, podcast ...
I think we need a bigger power strip, too!

The microphone is wired straight into the transmitter.  It seems
unidirectional, no noise cancelling, so feedback is a problem if
the gain is too high.  I suspect we will want to keep the PA a
good distance from the speaker.  The transmitter does have a large
mute button, so the presenter can stop the feedback after hearing
is destroyed but before bleeding begins.

My knowledge is from the 1960's in Cincinnati, but I suspect that it is 
similar around the country.

Sometimes the electric utility owns the poles, and sometimes the phone 
company owns the poles. I have no idea who decided which company would 
install which poles, but once there, the other company rents space for 
their wires or cables.

I think ownership was indicated by a metal strip with numbers stamped 
thereon. I suspect it was some kind of serial number that also indicated 
  who owned the pole.

Galen got to it first, the most common tool is dd_rescue. I've also got
my own tool that roughly mimics `dd`, but fixes the one problem for disk
recovery.

This has proven to be a valid and reliable method for me:

http://www.antrix.net/journal/techtalk/reiserfs_data_recovery_howto.comments

Interestingly enough, it was easier for find in Google than my
bookmarks ;)  It's also got a new update/link for Foremost (haven't
tried it...) to recover data from a dd image.  Sounds apropos for your
case.

that's it - it also works with sqlite for small sites (handy for da dsl box at home) and they're working on postgresql. I've used it with courier-imap and dovecot.

OK, got some squirrels running on my server now.  Not bad but it is 
pretty bland to look at.

first thing to do before anything else:

- enter BIOS, set disc to PIO mode 0 and turn off multi-byte transfers, DMA etc.
- boot cdrom and use hdparm to turn all speed options off

This saved my life many many times on IDE drives in the 20GB-80GB range - a lot of those started dropping like lemmings on me due to temperature problems after 3 years sustained use. Dropping the speed made the (I suspect!) cache memory and controller on the disc behave

This way I have retreived all information of many ""died"" hard discs without any trouble.

Oops, might have spoken too soon.  I can READ mail just fine and send to 
my internal network but I can't send to any address outside my net.

I get a "Relay access denied" error.  I've seen this stuff happen in 
sendmail and know what to do about it there, but not in postfix since I 
am a n000bie.

Anybody know the solution for this???

SMTP admin class #1 - how to setup a smtp server properly ;^) (I honestly wish someone would write the notes for this tho!).

seriously, you should setup your smtp server to relay all mail to your ISP's mailhost ONLY. In postfix that would be one of these:

relayhost = [gateway.my.domain]
relayhost = [mailserver.isp.tld]

hth,

I don't understand the frustration here.  If one runs Windows, which has 
no source available, why be bothered by a free and reputable, non-oss 
addon?  The bottom line is there is no money out of your pocket.  If 
people are *so* hung up on not having the source that they can't even 
see the rest of the picture (again, for reputable companies) then I 
don't know what to say.

That being said, I can't believe the amount of stuff some people around 
here think doesn't exist.  Search for 20 seconds or so at sf.net.

John,

I too have used it quite awhile. I have seen a few major upgrades with 
it.None of the upgrades caused any major issues... well, unless you use 
A-OH-HELL... but it is the only app that I have seen get messy with, and 
that I will blame on aol.

The licenses on these "free" products are often fairly restrictive, for 
one.  If I have somebody running Windows, they absolutely need Antivirus 
protection and need some sort of a good firewall between them and the 
Internet.

Not everybody can migrate away from Windows.  To assume they can is naive.

Given that, you have a choice.  Either find a "free" product with a 
license that is nonrestrictive enough to allow your legal use of the 
software, use the software illegally, or find and use a truly free 
product out there.  I, personally, would much rather support OSS 
developers than some project out there to simply capture some of the 
market share to leverage their money making ability in the future.

But that's just me.  :-)

OK, I don't use my isp for mail service.  I use me.
In sendmail, I think the answer was /etc/mail/relay-domains combined 
with /etc/mail/local-host-names
Anyways, squirrelmail is a nice mail READER.

That does seem high, but at least you'll be safe with the 1500mA. 1500mA 
should cover anything you decide to plug into it.

I would like to point out that once this was discovered it was fixed in a
matter of hours, and as with any ubuntu install you should always

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

after the install is complete, the patch was released sunday afternoon for
this bug.

Tim,

Thanks for the update. I will advise the students to get used to the

up with plug.

Carla,
Yes, you only need FORWARD rules to let traffic get to the DMZ servers.
For greater security you can create multiple rules that are server-specific
so that traffic is restricted to the server/ports that are legitimate.

Subject: [PLUG] iptables, dmz, public addys

hey all,

Here's the scenario:

Suppose I have a nice tri-homed Linux iptables firewall/gateway. Default 
filter table policies are:

$ipt -P INPUT DROP
$ipt -P FORWARD DROP
$ipt -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

My three network segments are 

wan 1.2.3.4
lan 192.168.1.1
dmz 192.168.2.1

On the dmz are a few public servers, the usual web, mail, ftp, wotever.
These 
have public routable IPs. To correctly route incoming traffic to them, do I 
need only FORWARD rules? Like this:

$ipt -A FORWARD -p tcp -i $WAN_IFACE -o $DMZ_IFACE -d 1.2.3.44 --dport 80 -j

ACCEPT

I don't want any DNAT or SNAT on the server IPs, I want to use their real
IPs. 
The idea is to forward only traffic that belongs to the servers, and drop
all 
the other junk at the gateway. (all them charming ssh attacks and ms sql 
worms etc. ad nauseum, thank you very much microtwits)

I'll have a limited bit of time for testing later this week, so I want to
get 
it right the first time.

thanks!

You can verify that in Postfix (/etc/postfix/main.cf) that the line 
"mynetworks" includes 127.0.0.1/8 and the internal IP address of the web 
server (assuming you're behind a firewall and don't allow relaying from 
the outside), in my case 172.16.1.10/16.  That solved "my" problems when 
I encountered that error.

After much head scratching/banging & two bottles of Fat Tire, I came 
upon a solution.  In main.cf, based on configuration examples and advice 
from the internets, I had mynetworks_style = class.  Upon changing to 
mynetworks_style = subnet all is well, tested and working.

I'm happy now.

One more Fat Tire, then off to dreamland.

Well, it worked for a day.
I came back the next day and it has reset itself to point to the modem 
instead of the Qwest DNS server for the Primary DNS.

Also the Samsung printer that I had installed and left working, quit 
working with a  message that the print was aborted and that I should find 
out why.

I tried a Ubuntu live disc and it asked me what video chip set was being 
used. I guessed and the installation ended up freezing.

I then tried Knoppix 3.4 and it had a bad sector.

I then tried Knoppix 3.3 and it came up and was able to browse the web just 
fine without any manual changes.

So, how do I make the changes to /etc/resolv.conf permanent? (The head of 
the file says that it is machine generated.)

Or should I just dump FC4 and try install Knoppix since it seems to get the 
DNS stuff OK.

What is the least hassle and most likely to work without further problems?

Thanks


JK

OpenWebMail has the one feature my boss required in a webmail
application: spell-check.  It has other nice features too.

http://www.openwebmail.org/

I've been running it since Dec. so far it is less buggy than
SquirrelMail.  I'm actually running them both, as I already have some
users hooked on SM.

The only draw back was that no where is it documented that it won't run
on Apache2.  So I have both the older version of Apache and the newer
version running at the same time.

Good Luck,

well if you use DHCP it will overwrite it every time your computer
connects.... but FC4 might have some other screwy stuff changin
resolv.conf.... I don't know since I stopped using it around FC2, I
found it just installed far too many things and I like to keep my
systems slim, that and I like to know whats installed.

If you are using DHCP just make you IP static instead and redo your
resolv.conf file.... its should change again

Do you mean that you have more than one dmz server and that you would
like to be able to access each of these using a different wan IP
address?  Or are you using several dmz servers and you would like to
access them by a single wan IP address?

Both can be done.

   Took it for a test drive yesterday afternoon, and it charged the phone just
fine.

Thanks for the RS suggestion,

I had similar problems about a year ago.

ReiserFS is reportedly more sensitive to corruption. Chances are better
that recovery tools (all available on the live version of Knoppix) will
work. I had a similar problem with a multiboot system - a couple of the
partitions were formatted to reiserfs, a couple of others to ext3.

As Galen suggests, dd_rescue skips over error bits.

I think with one of the partitions, I had bunches of errors, and it
eventually borked. I had to do a "dd_rescue -r" - a reverse read, which
took a bit longer.

After completing the recovery, I tried a dd_rhelp, written by the author
of dd_rescue for more difficult situations. It worked well, just took
about 5 or 6 hours to get through a big (I don't remember how big,
probably around 10 GB) partition.

My procedure was to boot a Knoppix live CD - and connect to a FireWire
drive. I remember that it connected fine to my network, so I could have
saved in that direction as well. Once saved, you can dd the image back
to the new drive.

Thanks and good luck,
Mike

The first. Assume a single shared Internet connection for both public services 
and private LAN. The dmz NIC connects to a switch with a nice little batch of 
servers, each one with its own gen-u-wine public IP.  So I want to have each 
one Internet-accessible via its own address. I don't want to use DNAT/SNAT 
because that's just dumb when you have real routable public IPs. Performance 
hit, too complex, etc blah. I don't know if this is something that is better 
handled with iproute, or something that iptables is good for. If I had an 
actual pool of public IPs to play with I could figure it out, but alas, out 
there are many cows and few IPs.

PHBs would require spell-check on the freakin' coffee-makers if the
idea occurred to them.  That said, tha Squirrel comes with a spell-check
plugin.  Otherwise, my users wouldn't touch it.

Sounds like a big drawback.  Probably why I couldn't get it working.  
That said, it looks pretty darn nice.

Thanks. It is frustrating not having the means to test this until I can 
commandeer some resources from a friend. With private IPs, I can test 
everything except DNS.

Intentions are held by people.  Which people's intentions do you care
about?

The intentions of the writers of the Constitution were primarily to
reward folks with temporary monopolies for publically disclosing trade
secrets, in particular manufacturing arts that European governments
did not want us to have.  Cash grants were considered instead, but
there was no source of funding.  Later, this became transmogrified
into rewarding original inventors.  Later, this became a reward for
lawyers working for large companies.

> How costly is it to violate a patent?

The sky is the limit.  Lemelson got over a billion dollars on a patent
that was later thrown out of court by a persistent opponent.  The
recent Blackberry suit was $160M IIRC.  Violating my patents costs
almost nothing, because I can't easily fight back.

Depends.  Radios are valuable, and very limited by government.  
Big Mouth Billy Bass is useless, and unlimited by government. 
Politics is not government, but a way to choose a government.

IBM and other large companies have huge patent portfolios they 
explicitly permit open source developers to use.  If Microsoft ever
tried to use their patent portfolio to stop Linux, IBM would use their
patent portfolio and huge legal staff to shut down Microsoft stone
cold dead.  Mutual assured destruction.  Small outfits with patents,
"patent mills", will attack anything and anybody - legalized extortion.

To the same extent that it protects prisoners with firing squads.
Inventors are not "protected" by patents,  mostly they are thwarted
by them.  Threats and protections are two different things.  So are
expectations and property.

Patents are a license to sue and create economic havoc without being
punished.  They are allegedly justified by the larger havoc that would
occur if inventors were not paid - but unlike lawyers, inventors and
others have many ways to make money besides lawsuits and extortion.
Linux, and science, and many parts of the free market show that you
can make plenty of money creating ideas without government-mandated
monopolies.


> Should patents be harder to get?

Impossible in almost all cases, except for mine :-)  There are some
interesting notions in the book "Innovation and its Discontents". 
It isn't about easier/harder, it is about appropriate and productive.
Should it be easier or harder to get money?  Depends on whether you
are talking about free exchange or robbery.

If you want a book that will reinforce some of your opinions, read
"Hot Property" by Pat Choate.  You can absorb some history from that. 
I think Choate gets quite a few things wrong, but...

There are many books on the subject of patents and their public value.
You will learn more from reading the right books than asking questions
on a technical software list.

Strange that one didn't pop-up in my search for spell-checking webmail
programs.  I like the spell-check in OpenWebMail, it is easy and quick,
much quicker than the sequential checkers.

So far it is not a real problem, the system isn't very heavily used.

You don't even want the dmz, in that case.  All you need to do is use
the router supplied by your ISP (usually called a modem by the ISP),
plug that into your switch with your firewall as one of the bunch of
nice servers.  The exception to this is if your ISP assigned a subnet to
you, then you need to setup the router as a gateway for that subnet.  In
this case, no iptables rules are needed, though they can be applied.

Good Luck,

If there is anyone on the PLUG list willing to serve as an
editor/moderator for the technology section at News4Neighbors, please
contact me off list. 

http://www.news4neighbors.net/index.pl?section=Technology

The tech section is a good local forum for tracking stuff like the PTP,
Free Geek, GOSCON, the OSDL, local PHP meetings and more. We're also
looking for representatives from the Perl, Python and Ruby user groups
to post info about their meetings.

Duties would include posting the PLUG speaker articles to our Slashcode
based interface. You'd also get to approve Tech stories and give out
unlimited moderation points. 

Thanks,

David

Subject: [PLUG] New venue for advanced topics
Message-ID: <20060316163818.GB12261@gate.kl-ic.com>


I am hard of hearing.  I kludged up a PA and wireless microphone
system for Advanced Topics at Jax so I could hear the speaker over
the machine noises from the kitchen, with the side benefit that
the people in the back of the room might hear, too. 

Jax has had "jazz nights" on thursday and friday for a while, and
they are now doing it on wednesday across the hall, every wednesday
for the forseeable future.  Every time the door opens between bar
and meeting room, the music swamps the speaker and the questioners.
So the arms race escalates, and it was more difficult for me to hear
last night with the PA than without in the past.  Now that I have
something to tap into, I can use headphones, but that doesn't help
me hear the questions and it doesn't help anyone else.

In a few months, TriMet will be rerouting transit onto 3rd and 4th
street while they rebuild the mall.  It will be impossible to find
parking nearby - hauling projector and PA will become very difficult.

And Jax may decide that jazz night needs the big room on wednesdays.
We may be "out on our ears" with little warning.  Especially if the
acoustic competition reduces attendance for our meetings.

So - we should look for another place for Advanced Topics.  A new
venue will need Beer, sufficient room for 20 to 40 people,  nearby
parking, Beer, usable transit, food, and Beer.  This will be hard
to find - Alan has looked.  Someplace between the west hills and
east 39th would probably be sufficiently accessable. There are some
restaurants with space up around 11th and Burnside, but they have
inadequate Beer.  Bridgeport might work, if they have an appropriately
sized room.  Unfortunately, the McMenamins want room rent, as does
the Lab.  There are some small restaurants up near Lloyd Ccenter
that might have space, but again the Beer situation might suck. 
Beer is important for many, because it makes unprepared speakers
and nonsequitur questions tolerable.

Jax has been good for us, and I don't want to ditch them if we can
work something out.  It might be possible to move to monday night
now that football season is over, and that will give us search time
until the fall.    

Ideas?

Keith

This might change in the summer when it is warm enough for them to move to 
the roof.  (That is a short term solution, at best.

Hard cider and/or hard alcohol are a plus as well.

Another round of the "Elliot drinking game"?

Monday is about the only option left for us, as they have poker games on 
Tuesdays.  Glad to see them doing well, but it sucks for us.

Paddy's room is way too small.  (Which is why we moved to Jax in the first 
place.)

Might also check if any of the pizza places have beer and a meeting room. 
(They tend to have large rooms like that.)  The only places I have known 
with those sorts of rooms have gone under in the last few years.

I've only been to a couple advanced topics meetings, so I understand 
my advice comes from grandstands, not the playing field -- but I'm 
sympathetic to a Monday gathering. It certainly dovetails better with 
my schedule.

the Rose and Raindrop has a meeting room, which last time I heard was
free as long as you buy a few drinks and/or food, they have wifi, minors
can be in the meeting room too last time I checked (I don't know if
that's a big deal for AT meetings or not, but if I were under 21 I
imagine I'd like it).  I'm not sure it could hold 40 people though..

I'm using a cheapo bttv card. I plan to get a hauppage pvr-150 pretty soon.
The hauppage cards seem to be pretty popular among MythTV users. You might
ask the same question on the MythTV-users list.

Subject: [PLUG] Low-end laptops for firewall routers
Message-ID: <20060316191214.GA12770@gate.kl-ic.com>


The Free Geek laptops mailing list is discussing what to do with
the pile of old low-end laptops they have accumulated.  I suggested
firewall routers - with a couple of 10Mbps PCMCIA ethernet cards
a >50MHz laptop does a decent job of firewalling a SOHO site.  They
probably also would make dandy Personal Telco node computers.

Is anyone motivated to put together a "minimum requirements" Linux
firewall router disk image?  It might be worthwhile to build a CD
with a "hard disk wipe and install" package that leaves a small
laptop ready for final configuration over the net.  Some machines
might not have CD drives; for those, floppy-based network boot might
work.  Laptops with neither a floppy or a CD would need to have their
hard drives pulled.

I imagine one remaining issue might be finding enough PCMCIA ethernet
cards and dongles to go with them.  I suspect the dongles don't end
up at Free Geek with the computers very often.

I don't have any spare cycles right now.  Anyone else looking for
a project?

What's considered a low end laptop?

Have you considered IPCop? It meets all of your requirements, except telco 
stuff- it's a complete small, specialized Linux distribution customized to be 
a complete firewall/router/intrusion detector. It comes with VPN, OpenSSH, 
Snort, DHCP, DNS cache, and bunch of other goodies. It's designed to run 
headless, and can be administered either via SSH or its HTML interface. I've 
used it on PII 233 boxes satisfactorily. It supports ethernet, dialup, 
wireless, multiple networks- all in all, quite a nice package. And it's all 
GPL.

I probably have a handful of old PCMCIA cards like 3Com, Megahertz, Xircom
etc.  Some with dongles and some without.  I could provide those but must
tell you that a number of these cards are not highly compatible with Linux
builds so I guess it comes down to a pretty skilled drivers coder in this
project.

They have low end laptops?  Where do they hide them and how much are they?

Actually, it doesn't. To give an example, if you fetch your mail with an SSH 
tunnel, traffic between the remote SSH server and the mail server will be 
transmitted in the clear. This is a nice in-depth article:

It depends on where you define the "ends".  If you use a mail protocol 
that also encrypts (say "pop over ssl") then it will.

I use it to bypass the braindead firewall at work.

Maybe what they meant is that end-to-end means encryption from your
connecting workstation to the SSH server?

I have a card in a computer that was given to me that SuSE read as 
something very similar to this.  Ubuntu 5.10 reads it as a Brooktree 
Corp. Bt878 Video Capture.  Below that is listed Bt878 Audio Capture 
(digital, analog, and ALSA control device).  It shows Hauppage computer 
works, Inc. as the OEM vendor, and is a WinTV series.
I do not know what this card actually does.  I haven't had the time to 
Google it and figure it out.

sorry for walking in 30 minutes late, but parking was a bitch. Eric did a
great job and althought 90% of it was over my head (as I expected it to be)
I still was able to learn somethin ;).

That being said, I walked out of the Jax with one hell of a headache. With
the background freaknoise of jass (yes jass because it sounded like ass)
coupled with the only seat in the house being in the back hearing was an
issue, I'm pretty sure my headache was induced by the straining of my ears
to hear, and the obnoxiously high heat level in the room. I wasn't able to
hear a single one of the questions so I missed out on that part, and being
the "new guy" in the room, I didn't want to create too much of a ruckous
yelling "WHAT!" from the back of the room repeatedly. I'm so glad the
waitress asked my friend and I if we wanted anything to drink as well
(sarcasm...she didn't) that was special. The place is nice enough, but
seriously it sucked.

I don't have any suggestions of places to meet there is a greek resturant
around there, but being from Salem I'm not too familure with the area.

Please for the sake of my ears, let's not do that again...

Your example was using SSH to a gateway machine, and them SSH from the
gateway to an internal network machine. Building from that I was
suggesting merely using the first SSH connection to terminate a tunnel
into your internal network, then use SSH on top for the actual
connection.

The multiple levels of tunneling is inefficient, but it does allow the
gateway machine to do its job and still gets you into your internal
network. More significantly it means your authentication tokens are never
present in the clear on the gateway. Thus cracking the gateway merely
allows access to the internal network, it doesn't give an attacker access
to the internal machines without more work.

In this situation though, you very definitely need to verify the
destination host key, as otherwise cracking the gateway allows an
attacker to MitM you.

My network connection is fine.  This is strange because I have done a full

Hi,

If you ping the site by name, does it resolve the IP address?
If you enter a URL of http:// the_IP_ address does the browser find the page?

worked, then didn't work. I am still sorting the details.
Doesn't he know that Metro and BART are both financial failures. Buses

I am eagerly awaiting more ideas to try. BTW this is on QWEST DSL line.

I'm looking to buy a new PC and have been searching around on the web
for local shops that will build one.  The two places linked from PLUG's
homepage, ENU and Pacific Solutions, both have somewhat limited options,
at least on their website, as does Belmont Computer.  Do these places
have more customization options than are indicated on their sites?
(Pacific Solutions, for example, seems only to build AMD Sempron
machines.)

Are there better bets than these places in the area?  Failing that, does
anyone have a favorite company that does custom builds and ships
nationally?

Could it be an IPv6 issue?  I ask only because that was the problem I
had, and it took me a while to figure out what was going wrong.

You could test it by firing up w3m (text mode browser/pager) and trying
to load a website with the "-4" option, which tells w3m to use IPv4
only.  If it loads with -4 and not without it, then that's probably the
issue.

Belmont Computers and Pacific Solutions can order pretty much anything.
I wouldn't base too much off of their web sites.  I'd suggest calling
them to discuss what you want.

BTW, I just noticed yesterday that Belmont Computers is moving east
about 19 blocks.  The new address is 4505 SE Belmont.  They are moving
on April 1st.

Call Pacific Solutions and tell them what you are looking for.  They can 
probably order it for you.  It takes them about 1-2 days to get stuff in, 
unless it is unusual.

I have shopped at Pacific Solutions for years and I have been very happy 
with them.  Unfortunatly they have lost their Linux-savy techs in the last 
year.  (Not that I ever use their techs, considering how long I have been 
using Linux.)

I prefer someplace close I can walk into in case I have hardware failure 
issues.

Personally, I love PC Club. You gotta wait around on the ENU store to 
open AT NOON. My day is half over by then. I do not know anything about 
PS. I wouldn't recommends Belmont either, as I have had to go and fix 
some of their ignorant mistakes. One guy had his pc in there 3 times to 
have the same issue fixed, they kept it for a week each time, and 
returned it unresolved. They may be better now, but I still won't buy 
anything from them.

If you are going to put Linux on it do a little research on the chip 
set. Some are harder than others to make work, ie linksys wireless cards 
are a pain to get working, while cisco wireless cards tend to be a snap 
to get them to work.

ALWAYS DO YOUR HOMEWORK.... or be prepared to spend time getting things 
tweeked just so.

This is such an alien concept to me.  Except for laptops, I haven't
bought a computer off the shelf since 1986.  Building a computer is
trivial.  The sequence is: a) buy parts; b) plug together; c) power
on; d) install OS; e) do stuff.

I had (have) the same issue with a Verizon DSL line and Ubuntu.  I don't 
know what the solution is, but, I know what the problem is.

I have an Actiontec GT704WG modem/router.  Every time I turn the 
wireless off or on, or just turn the modem off for the night, I get the 
Browser Blues.  Somehow the problem seems to just fix itself if I leave 
things alone for a while.  In my case I am able to use Konqueror until 
Firfox and the modem make up to each other.  If I leave the Actiontec 
alone, all is good.

I have the intention of installing a firewall on the computer and 
turning off the one on the modem to see if that solves the problem.  All 
I need is a little time...

Subject: [PLUG] Mounting Thumb Drive
Message-ID: <20060317122402.48e1eefa.johnxj@comcast.net>

The 512 MB Cruzer thumb drive I bought on eBay arrove.

Now I need to mount it. I created a mount point as /media/thumbdrive. But I can't figure out what Linux is calling the drive. I did dmesg | tail and it seems to be /dev/sda -- at least it identifies something there as /dev/sda and having 512 MB. If I go to File > Open in any application it shows up as SanDisk Cruzer Micro.

I'm assuming it's formatted vfat, since I bought it from someone using Windows. And if it's not, that's what I need on it, because the purpose is to be able to transfer files to non-linux computers. I double-checked it by plugging it into my Windows 2000 desktop, and in My Computer it is seen as 512 MB, formatted Fat32. For kicks I dragged a small .txt file and copied it onto the thumb drive. Windows seemed to have no problem doing so, and the file now shows up on the drive in Windows Explorer.

Moving it back to the Linux computer, I tried sudo mount /dev/sda /media/thumbdrive and it said it wanted the filesystem type. So I read the man page and it seems I should insert "vfat" in between the dev and the mount point. But that doesn't work either -- all I get is the help messages with indication which feature I did wrong.

I also opened Krusader with sudo and tried to use its mount-man feature, but it can't see /dev/sda. Evidently mount-man can only mount stuff that is in fstab, and this is not in there because I'm not sure what to call it. There's already a /dev/sda in there, and it refers to my 60 GB pocket disk, which is not currently connected. I don't want to mess that up. I can't find any instructions on how to edit fstab.

At the moment the thumb drive is in a USB port on the Linux computer and all happily lit up emitting an eerie blue light. If I try to open the file I put on there (e.g., with gedit) I get the error message "Unable to mount the selected volume.:Error: given UDI is not a mountable volume."

I bet I'm just missing some little key point. :(

most usb storage devices contain a partition table and one or more partitions. You should check if you have a /dev/sda1 or similar partition device.

You can always verify that there is a partition table by doing a 'fdisk -l /dev/sda'. That should also show up any partitions on the drive. If the drive is unpartitioned (i.e. empty or unformatted) you might want to partition it and put a new filesystem on it - but that's assuming that there is nothing actually on the drive that you want to lose ;^)

Can fdisk open it?

/sbin/fdisk /dev/sda

See what the partition table looks like.

I have a thumb drive that has gotten fried in some weird manner.  (It was 
removed from a Windows system incorrectly.)  fdisk says it cannot open it, 
but lsusb can identify the drive and sees it.  (Just won't mount it.)

Anyone know how to reinitialize a thumb drive?

The -p option gave me:

Disk /dev/sda: 512 MB, 512483328 bytes
16 heads, 63 sectors/track, 993 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 1008 * 512 = 516096 bytes

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda1               1         992      499851+   b  W95 FAT32

So that means (aparently) that it is sda1. Acting on that supposition I tried:

sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /media/thumbdrive

And it worked! Krusader now sees it as mounted. But why did dmesg | tail said it was sda? Or is -1 always appended? I'm just trying to figure out what syntax to use next time I want to mount it. Like, what if I want to mount it at a time when my pocket disk is already mounted on another USB port? Also, I copied the -t from some other command, but I don't know what it does or if it is necessary. And should I add it to fstab? This stuff is so confusing!

Well, at least I know there is nothing wrong with it. Now I need to be sure I can mount it when I need it, which will probably be in a last minute crisis situation trying to print out a homework at PSU ten minutes before class.

Thanks for the help.

The Thumb drive *is* /dev/sda.  That's all the kernel/hotplug was 
looking at when you plugged the thing in.  What got you was there is a 
partition on the thing.  Often thumb drives and the like don't use 
partitions, but rather just write a filesystem to the entire disk.

PC Club looks promising, but I am having a lot of problems with the
homework part.  It's much harder than it should be to find information
about Linux compatibility.  The Linux Compatible website is helpful, but
there's so much hardware out there that it's nowhere near comprehensive
enough.  At least I was able to rule a few things out, mostly due to
finding the odd blog or USENET post about something not working.  But I
have yet to find confirmation that anything that looks good and is
priced reasonably will work.

Crap, maybe I should just by a Dell and be done with it.

Once upon a time I had DSL from SBC back in the midwest, and they
explicitly told us to never turn the DSL modem off for unknown
reasons.  Perhaps you should stop turning off your modem for the
night.

I have Verizon DSL now, never turn off the modem (except for long
trips away from home) and don't have any problems with surfing the web
with Firefox.  There's a Linksys all-in-one box between my systems and
the modem.

PC Club will help you with finding parts that are compatible if you send 
them an email and tell them what you want to do with it. Let them do 
your homework for you. Gigabyte MB's tend to work with them, but Nvida 
graphics people were having a hard time with... I think ATI was decent.

If you are using X-Chat go into the irc.freenode server, and go into the 
#debian or #oklinux channel and ask them Or which ever distro you are 
going to put on it. (I would determine the distro FIRST.) I use debian 
and it has worked well... a word of caution... sometimes the guys in 
#debian are just plain rude. If you go to #oklinux talk to Cybo-Work or 
Cybo-dog, they are the same guy. He is a very good source of info.

Here are some questions to ask. Who has a decent MB that is working well 
with Linux? What is it? Which Video Card are you using? Does it play 
well? Was it hard to set up?

Also, I copied the -t from some other command, but I don't know what it does or if it is necessary. And should I add it to fstab? This stuff is so confusing!

The reason there's a 1 is because the block device (sda) has a partition table (ms-dos format). There's much controversy around this scheme (and it's relative lack of flexibility in today's hotplug-world), where block devices are identified by the driver (usually h for IDE, s for scsi [including USB, Serial ATA, etc.]) and then d and the drive's ID, starting with a.

For example, a modern system might have the following:

/dev/hda <-- primary hard disk on the IDE controller
/dev/hda1 <-- first partition on the primary hard disk
/dev/hda2 <-- second partition on the primary hard disk

/dev/hdc <-- CD-rom on the IDE controller channel 2
Note that there will be no /dev/hdc1 in this case because CD-ROMs do not (usually) get disklabels or partition tables. I don't know if it'd even be possible to write one -- probably not.

When you add a new SCSI device (whether it's using usb_scsi emulation such as your flash drive or a real SCSI controller) you'll get devices like

/dev/sda <-- Some scsi disk somewhere
/dev/sda1 <-- first partition on this disk
/dev/sda2 <-- second partition on this disk

And so on. Additional scsi drives will be /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc etc.

Basically to answer your question, the number at the end of the block device identifies a partition, which is recognized seperately because partitions usually have their own filesystems. It is possible with linux to have an entire block device used as one filesystem, say for example formatting /dev/hda as reiserfs. No reason not to, but no reason not to partition either.

As far as using fstab, I find it more convenient (since I don't use an automounter) to use Labels for removable media. Example, I have a USB harddrive labelled "OUTERSEAGATE" which is specified as follows in fstab:

LABEL=OUTERSEAGATE	/mnt/data	reiserfs	defaults	0 0

But that won't work for fat filesystems as far as I know. If you only have one removable device, you can certainly modify your fstab, although it'd be possible to corrupt another device if the system tries to mount a non-vfat filesystem as vfat. Mount should avoid that, however.

HTH,
Aaron

PS, the -t shouldn't be necessary for the mount command as long as you specify the correct partition:

mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/thumbdrive

Aside from the popular sayings related to dHell, keep in mind that a boxed system is less likely to have "decent" hardware. I.e. soft-DSP and winmodems.

Especially for Linux guys, building your own system is the way to go to assure compatibility. But as posted previously on the list, if you can give us an idea of requirements we can make better recommendations. (Personally I've never trusted sales people at any computer or high-tech store)

If you don't need wireless, and you don't use dialup, chances are any box out there would work. Even a dHell. But if it's going to be a big performance machine, you definitely want to care about chipsets running the IDE and memory, there are quite a few that Linux works with but only just. (Windows is no better.)

I can be of additional help off-list, if you have more specific questions.

HTH,
Aaron

I hear ya, dude. 

When I bought my first Compaq laptop a year ago I researched for over a
month, and was finally convinced that I could run Linux on it. And then
27 days after it arrived, I shipped it back because I couldn't get the
ATI video to work. (And the Ubuntu forums are still populated with
posts from people trying to get ATI chipsets to work.)

It took me a month of research -- and the research ended up being
faulty -- because I had to run all over the web trying to find out
stuff. And I had to post queries on e-lists and bug people who had more
important things to do than put up with stupid questions from a n00b.
In the end I had to make my decision based on half a fact from here and
half an opinion from there.

Right now I am considering building myself a new desktop that will use
that Dell 30" widescreen LCD monitor at 2560 x 1200. Think I can find
out anything about it on Linux? Hah! Lots of people point me to what
kind of video card it needs, but there are several different ones. So
then I get to try to figure out which card has the features I want --
difficult enough just because I don't have any idea what the various
features do. And then I have to stumble around elsewhere trying to find
out if there are Linux drivers for the card. And if there are, then I
have to figure out if "yes there's a driver" also means "and everything
works."

 What the Linux world needs is a total, comprehensive, all-in-one-place
database of every component that has ever been used in a computer, and
a mandatory requirement that everything be posted on it.

Thanks for the extensive education! I have added:

sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/thumbdrive

To my text file where I keep command line stuff that I know I will need right after I have forgotten the syntax.

Which reminds me of another question:

I use gnome-teerminal, the default on Ubuntu. I know there are other terminals I could use, I just have no experience with them. Is there one that has like a database where I can save commands to pop in later? I mean more than the up and down arrows, because they don't hold commands after I shut down the computer. Something like a pop-up addressbook in a mail client is what I am thinking of. It would be more convenient than opening my text file in gedit.

Dell's real popular around these parts, I see. :-)

I want what I guess would be described as a decent "home/office"
computer.  I'm not into gaming (not beyond tetris, solitaire, and frozen
bubble anyway), so I don't need any suped-up demon.  I do like to watch
a DVD on the computer once in a while, and I do want a reasonably snappy
machine -- that is, I'd rather not sit around watching the paint dry
while OpenOffice loads.  And I tend to have a fair number of apps open
at once.  I rip/encode CDs pretty regularly -- that tends to be slow on
this machine (an iMac P4 with 256mb ram).  I don't want to step down
from what I have.  Don't do video editing.

PC Club has a nice-looking AMD Athlon 64 2.4GHz with 512MB DDR and a
Gigabyte motherboard with this chipset:
 
NVIDIA? GeForce? 6100 and NVIDIA nForce? 430; 
Super I/O: Winbond W83627 chip; 
Integrated peripherals; 
VIA VT 6307 IEEE1394 controller; 
CICADA VSC 8201 Gigabit LAN PHY chip; 
Realtek ALC880 Audio Codec.

>From what I've been able to find, all of that should be okay with a
relatively recent kernel (not a stock Debian Sarge kernel, though -- too
old).  On-board audio should be fine, it's all I've ever had.  On-board
video, though?  Supposedly, it's a good budget line chipset, so maybe
the on-board video would be fine.  I guess I could always get a video
card later, if the performance isn't very good.  It's never been clear
to me how important a video card is for something like watching on-line
video or a DVD ... every review I ever come across only talks about
gaming.  The last PC (as opposed to PPC) I had had a mid-range Nvidia
card.  When I started using Linux, at first I used the proprietary
driver that provided 3D acceleration; but after awhile, I used the
open-source nv driver.  I never noticed a difference.  This leads me to
think it's not that important.

I've also never had an AMD machine, and I've read conflicting things
about AMD vs. Intel as well.  Some give the impression that AMD is more
of a gamer's platform and Intel Pentium 4s are better at office-type
applications because of hyperthreading.  Others don't make that
distinction.  And then there's the whole 64-bit thing, which I don't
know much about, except that there's not a lot that actually takes
advantage of it.  I guess that's changing, though.

For someone who has a hard time remembering what watt light bulb to buy,
this is all rather confusing.

I believe that everything listed will work with most distros. I would

issues/difficulties... at least you can be prepared for it.

Well, over the years my experience has generally been more comfortable using Linux on Intel-centric platforms. Intel's drivers are in the kernel for their NICs, and their P/S ATA controllers are some of the best-supported under Linux. AFAIK Intel is the only company who writes drivers that are actually distributed with the kernel. I like that, for reliability and guaranteed workingness (as much as it can be).

I've never heard of CICADA, and I configure on average 2 Linux kernels a day (I've never seen support either hacked in the kernel or natively), so that's the first red flag I notice. Also, I've had issues with realtek codecs under Linux recently, maybe the hacked drivers haven't caught up (I've never gotten their binaries to work at all)

Lately I've been recommending Intel D865GHZ boards with 3GHz Celeron Ds. The pair can be had for $120, then all you need is a hard disk drive, ram, case, and optical drive. (That board has audio, gigabit LAN, and video). And the 3GHz celeron Ds are very snappy, even without hyperthreading.

Bruce,

I have an Actiontec GT701-WT DSL Modem/Router with Qwest DSL service.

I tried power cycling the DSL Modem/Router.  No Help.

I tried plugging the network cable into the second network interface.  
The idea being that a new MAC address would force the DHCP to generate a new
IP.
New IP address, but this did not change the problem, so it is likely not the
DHCP.

I am out of things to try,

I am open to suggestions

I had (have) the same issue with a Verizon DSL line and Ubuntu.  I don't
know what the solution is, but, I know what the problem is.

I have an Actiontec GT704WG modem/router.  Every time I turn the wireless
off or on, or just turn the modem off for the night, I get the Browser
Blues.  Somehow the problem seems to just fix itself if I leave things alone
for a while.  In my case I am able to use Konqueror until Firfox and the
modem make up to each other.  If I leave the Actiontec alone, all is good.

I have the intention of installing a firewall on the computer and turning
off the one on the modem to see if that solves the problem.  All I need is a
little time...

This is my basic troubleshoot-DSL recipe:

1. power-cycle DSL modem
2. reboot PC

That cures most DSL silliness. If that doesn't work, did you test DNS like 
Mike Neal suggested?  Or the IPv4/6 test that Michael M. said? What does 
your /etc/resolv.conf say? Maybe you have some leftover static entries that 
don't work anymore?

To get a new DHCP lease, just run 'dhclient' or whatever DHCP client FC uses. 

You really don't need to guess, run Ethereal and you'll see exactly what is 
happening.

Hmm, well a Google search for "Intel D865GHZ" turns up exactly two
results, neither of which lead to anything useful.

It's been a long time since I've searched for anything on Google and
gotten only two results!

This is my basic troubleshoot-DSL recipe:

1. power-cycle DSL modem
2. reboot PC

That cures most DSL silliness. If that doesn't work, did you test DNS like
Mike Neal suggested?  Or the IPv4/6 test that Michael M. said? What does
your /etc/resolv.conf say? Maybe you have some leftover static entries that
don't work anymore?

To get a new DHCP lease, just run 'dhclient' or whatever DHCP client FC
uses. 

You really don't need to guess, run Ethereal and you'll see exactly what is
happening.

Oh, apologies, typo. D865GVHZL.. there used to be a 3 letter one but it's discontinued. This board costs $60 at TigerDirect.com, and they have bundles with $50 rebates on the 3GHz celerons. (http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1648816&CatId=182)

I was too hasty with my prior posting.
I would appear that Konquorer is operational.
Firefox is only able retrieve pages that Konquorer had fetched.
This is getting stranger and stranger.

Anyone, any guesses as to the root cause here?

Sounds like exactly the problem I had.  Basically, as was explained in a
previous thread a few weeks ago (when I had mentioned my problem),
there's a bug in the kernel that doesn't handle the absence of IPv6
properly.  Presumably, your ISP is not providing IPv6 yet (mine -- Qwest
-- is not).  What should happen is that when IPv6 requests go out and
don't receive a reply, the network should default to IPv4.  Or something
like that.  Instead, it just waits for a reply over IPv6.  Konqueror
works because it isn't IPv6-enabled yet, so it's only using IPv4 from
the get-go (doesn't send anything out over IPv6).  The same with w3m if
you invoke it with "-4".  Gecko-based browsers (Mozilla, Firefox,
Epiphany), however, are IPv6 enabled, so they just hang, because the
network is waiting for a reply over IPv6 that will never arrive.

I had the same thing happen with Gecko browsers you describe -- if I
browsed to any website with Konqueror or w3m -4 first, then Firefox etc.
would load the page.  Otherwise, they wouldn't load anything.  I don't
completely understand why this is the case, but my grasp of all of this
is pretty tenuous.

I don't know how you address the problem in Fedora.  In Debian, I
commented out "alias net-pf-10 ipv6" and added "alias net-pf-10 off"
in /etc/modprobe.d/aliases.  That shuts down network support of IPv6
altogether, and the problem goes away.  It's not exactly a fix, but it's
a workaround.  Fedora might be different, though.

Oh, I read that a reboot was required after
editing /etc/modprobe.d/aliases.  Apparently, just stopping and
restarting the network won't do the trick.

I would settle for a solidly researched site that broke out components
by type and level and just focused on what is widely supported across
distributions -- i.e., here are the 10 best high-end motherboards, here
are the 10 best mid-range motherboards, 10 best low-end graphics cards,
etc.

Some distros have some specifics about hardware compatibility (Debian
does not).  Linspire actually has a decent listing, but just because
something works under Linspire doesn't mean it'll work across the board.
I can't tell you how many message board posts and like I've come across
in the past few days where someone says, "SuSe has no problem with this
xxx, but Mandrake won't detect it" or some such, even with the same
kernel version.

Linux's greatest strength -- its diversity -- is also its greatest
weakness.  The lack of standardization makes it very flexible and makes
it very difficult for the techno-semi-literate to figure out the
landscape.  Every distro has slightly different strengths, slightly
different quirks, slightly to wildly different ways of system
administration, software installation, etc.  Windows and OS X work one
way; Linuxes work any number of ways.  Of course, there are some distros
that, if they were the only choices, would drive me back to Windows or
OS X.  So I'm glad there's choice, but it creates problems that get very
frustrating at times.

One thing I'm planning on doing when I finally figure out what hardware
to buy is try FreeBSD.  It has the benefit of a centralized management
structure -- it's not just a kernel.  Even if I don't like it any
better, it'll be interesting to check out.  Plus, philosophically, I
admire the BSD license more than the GPL.

I don't know if what you're requesting is exists, but what I do when I
want a quick view of some notes somewhere is just cat the file.  If you
keep a cheat sheet of commands in a text file in your home drive, it's a
lot faster to do cat ~/cheatsheet than to open gedit.  And if you want
to edit the file, it's faster to do it with vim (or nano, emacs,
whatever) from within the terminal than to open gedit.  Myself, I'm
finding fewer and fewer reasons to open gedit at all. :-)

The thing I like about gnome terminal, even though it's slower and
hungrier than xterm or aterm, is tabs.  Inevitably, I end up with three
or four tabs open in almost any instance.  It's like tabbed browsing ...
once you get used to it, it's hard to live without it.  I usually keep
any files I know I'm going to want to refer to and possibly edit open in
a tab.

There used to be a competition... see who could get only two results in

Late reply here, but if you're considering a boxed solution, I would 
recommend Gateway or an eMachine.  For those that don't know, Gateway 
bought them out a little while ago.  Any eMachine that is black and 
solver is a Gateway.  The best part about these brands (though not true 
for all older beige models) is that they are built with off the shelf 
commodity parts.  If a power supply goes, or even a motherboard, it can 
be replaced with something you buy from Fry's or Newegg.  The new 
eMachines are not the same ball of crap they used to be.

If you're going to get a custom built machine, and you know how to swap 
out memory or upgrade a video card, then maybe you should just build it 
yourself.  It's really not that hard, and there is little tweaking if at 
all you need to do to the computer to run it optimally.  There is 
probably nothing you can do that will make any noticeable difference in 
performance.

It's echoed here many times that Freegeek will train you on building a 
machine.  The building part hasn't changed much with the new stuff. 
Maybe a couple different cables, or 'now-it's-on-the-other-side' stuff, 
but the knowledge will transfer just fine.

That being said, I recommend Newegg.  They rock, their cheap, and any 
part you get locally that has to be ordered by the store means you will 
have to wait on a part anyway.

Thanks for that info. I tried cat and it does work great. However, I 
still have to type "cat CheatSheet" and then copy and paste from 
it. Still, cat is faster than opening gedit.

And thanks for reminding me about tabs. I've known that gnome-
terminal had tabs for a long time, but I never bothered to figure out 
how to use them. I've just been opening a new terminal window 
each time. So now I took the time to explore gnome-terminal and 
I'll be using tabs. Much more efficient.

I'd still like something where I could just point and click to select 
often-used commands. Something like bookmarks in Firefox. As 
efficient as Linux users have made the command line, surely 
there's something out there. Maybe a "terminal" is not what I 
should be looking for.

Bill:

In general, you seem to be "trying things" and not "gathering data".
There are too many things that can be misconfigured, and chances are
you will be taking a random walk that diverges from a solution.  There
is not enough time in the universe to try all the different possible
combinations.

I do not use the later Fedora Cores - they are far too experimental
and much too unsupported to work with for people with my limited
experience and limited available time.  A better time investment
might be made in Ubuntu, or SUSE, or one of the many RHEL4 clones,
so that you are not dealing with a science project.  I won't go
into the differences between the three alternatives I suggest (and
there are many more good alternatives besides) but they are all
rather different but competent ways to approach the "Linux Problem",
and they are all much more finished products than Fedora Core.

That said, you are now trying to follow the "Fedora" path, and since
that shares some history with the Fedora Cores 1 and 2, Redhat 9,
and RHEL4 systems I am used to, so I will try to steer you from that
perspective.  

First, /var/log/messages is your friend.  Just about everything you
are doing will leave traces there.  You should be using "ifconfig"
to see what interfaces you are using, and what the net masks and
gateways are.  "route -n" will tell you other things about your
connection.  /etc/resolv will tell you what the "ifup" and dhcp
processes decided your name servers are.  iptables -L will tell
you about what is firewalled off.  You should be using something
like tcpdump or ethereal if the aforementioned tools don't tell
you enough, though debugging at the packet level is painful.

And of course the outputs of all of these diagnostics (and many
others) from *working* systems in similar circumstances, compared
to your outputs, will be instructive.

One good source of "working" would be a Knoppix or an Ubuntu Live
CD.  These are pretty good at connecting to a network, and they
can be started without a firewall because there is nothing for the
bad guys to rewrite.  You are not doing this as a "try something",
you are doing this to gather data about a working connection. 
Unfortunately, since both of those are Debian based, you will need
to do a lot more abstracting of data from a different set of
configuration files than the Redhat family, and since they are
live CDs not all the logging will be in place.  

The key to debugging a problem is to start with a working system and
change one thing and see what it does.  Once you understand all the
aspects of your change, you are ready to change another thing.  Changing
two or more things at once is a recipe for confusion and failure.  And
while it is working, write down important observations ( network 
configuration, DNS server addresses, a few numeric IP addresses of
test targets) so that you have something to work with when things
go wrong - and they will.

There are so many things that can go wrong with a network connection,
and with a bleeding-edge experimental distro, and with buttheaded
windoze-tunnel-vision service providers and hardware designs, that
you are very unlikely to land on top of an island of working solutions
if you dive randomly into the ocean.  You will have to do some 
navigation, and more importantly you will have to first prove to
yourself that an island actually exists.  That is what the rest of us,
and Google, can help you with;  duplicate the coordinates of somebody
elses dry land, and strike out from there.  That may involve a
different distro, cable modem, DSL provider, etc.  It may even involve
starting with a borrowed windoze system on your DSL line to see
whether that can connect properly.  At least you will be able to talk
to the windoze-addled service reps at your DSL service if the windoze
box doesn't work.

One last note about internet services;  I don't know how it works for
the various DSL providers, but Comcast wants to talk to a specific
MAC address on the other side of the cable modem.  In my case, they
talk to a particular PCMCIA ethernet card on my laptop router.  If 
I get the cards mixed up, Comcast won't talk to me any more.  The
same could be true for you.

Try bringing your box into the Linux Clinic at Free Geek tomorrow. 
If the network connection is running, we can see if your box works
with your ISP and your DSL modem out of the equation, and compare 
log files with a working RH-style system, such as my laptop.

Sooo, what's stopping you from doing this yourselves? 

Linux hardware support really isn't a big deal anymore. The two trouble spots 
are high-end video cards and wireless a/g adapters. Video is easily solved by 
sticking with NVidia, though that is a problem for folks who would rather 
support cards that use 3D FOSS drivers. ATI also makes Linux drivers, and 
they are somewhat "open", but ATI quality is not very good.

Wireless b adapters are easy, lots of them work fine on Linux. Wireless a/g 
adapters are a pain because vendors don't like to make it easy to find which 
chipsets are in them. But once you know the chipset, you're golden. Atheros 
is the friendliest to Linux, and is good quality. Netgate.com is a good place 
to buy Linux-friendly wireless gear.

Printers can be troublesome, but we've been down that road on the list many 
times, with many good answers. 

Mainboards, SATA, PATA, SCSI, USB devices, sound cards, monitors, PCI-E, 
hotplug, CD/DVD writers, etc etc all work fine. No worries.

Don't even bother with Tier 1 vendors like Dell, Gateway, and so forth. If 
you're serious about supporting Linux and want genuine Linux expertise, 
support the shops who have genuine Linux support, and have for years, like 
Penguin Computing, Monarch, Linux Certified, and Emperor Linux, to name a 
few. Or support the good local shops like people have named here. 

It's really not a big deal.

In my experience, you really don't want much more than a text editor for 
collecting snippets of commands.  Consider what a "click to run" 
interface would imply:

  o  You must be in the right working directory or else enter absolute 
paths to all filenames.  Some commands (e.g. ps2pdf) expect to write 
output into the working directory unless explicitly told otherwise.

  o  You always want to run the command with the same filename 
arguments.  Otherwise, such a system would have to prompt you for one 
or more filenames and would either do this with a plain text-entry 
dialog or a file-chooser (both of which (depending on the GUI toolkit) 
can have tab complete, at the expense of some extra code.)

If the commands of which you speak really are repetitive and predictable 
enough such that the above two points are non-issues, then it is best 
to either make them into cron jobs or scripts.  Cron jobs run on a 
timer, scripts run when you say "name_of_my_script".

As for the rest...  Given that the shell has tab-complete, typing most 
commands and filenames usually reduces to a series of 2-3 letter groups 
joined by tabs for me.  I realize that doesn't help if you don't 
remember the first couple letters.  My own memory is also less than 
perfect, so I have a few directories full of snippets in various 
languages for just this reason.  Grep does a great job of digging up 
history that no amount of head-scratching would ever manage to 
correctly retrieve.

that's a load of nonsense. Dell and Gateway are extremely serious about supporting Linux on their systems - and I can say that from professional experience working with them. Feel free to go to the shack on the corner to pick the cherries out of the fruit, but saying that Dell does not invest in getting their systems to work with linux is false. They actually invest a lot in this and work closely with redhat, suse, novell to get their systems supported.

This reminded me -- does anyone have (or have time to burn) some Ubuntu Live and Install CDs? Ditto for Knoppix. We should have some of these in our "PLUG box." 

I also found an old telephone cable and tossed it with the signs I'm bringing tomorrow. It's not very long, though.

Guess I should have been more specific- both Dell and Gateway suck at Linux 
desktops.  Dell keeps dodging and weaving, and wanting us to think they are 
Linux-desktop friendly, but it's all a load of hooey. I prefer to support 
vendors who are not under Microsoft's thumb.

It's not necessary to insult local vendors.

Those are excellent points that I hadn't thought of.

No, they are like:

sudo ln -f /chroot/breezy/32bits/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

I already went through trying to get that into a script and ended up with a half-solution (see previous discussion here). Scripts are too complicated for desktop users like me. Yes, I realize I am not supposed to be using Linux. It ought to be illegal for someone without a CompSci degree and programming experience to use Linux. I've gotten that attitude from a lot of Linux people. It's never stated overtly, but I can read between the lines. Well, too bad. I just want something that a dummy can use. I'm a dummy. I'm here. And I intend to stay.

But your points above are very good. Nevertheless, I think a simple bookmark-like click-and-select feature would be useful. If the command needs to be run in a specific folder, then the user can type the whole path before saving it. I don't see why such a feature has to handle everything that a script could do. Its purpose is just to pop in one command. Consider it like a super-tab feature. Maybe it could just be a plugin or extension for gnome-terminal.

By the way, I just tried doing the above link command using tab. It took six tabs to get it all, and after each tab I had to type more letters to get tab to go to the next stop. It would have been faster just to type it and forget about tabs. The problem with tab is that you try it, it doesn't work, and you have to type some more, back and forth, back and forth. I'm not saying it's useless, just that it sometimes isn't much help.

Unfortunately, not only is it impossible to define "best" for everyone
but components change so often that by the time the reviews were done
that equipment would be different or simply no longer be available.

I'll second the recommendation for NewEgg.  I have a new
CPU/memory/motherboard combo on its way from them to replace my aging
dual-Pentium III 850 linux server.  In the interest of giving you some
ideas, here's what I bought-- keep in mind that this is not yet
assembled so there may be some lingering compatibility problems I'm
unaware of.

Motherboard: TYAN S2865G2NR

Tyan makes server-grade motherboards which cost about twice as much as
chipset-equivalent boards but their Linux compatibility has been good.
 Surprisingly, I've even heard that the on-board LAN and video both
work with Linux!  The downside is this board requires an EPS12V power
supply.  Just when I was getting over the horrors of the AT-to-ATX
conversion...

Power Supply: Antec TruePower 2.0 TP2-550 EPS12V

Required for the above board, there goes an extra $100.  Ow!

CPU: AMD Athlon 64 x2 3800+

This server/high-end desktop runs a lot of stuff at once-- hey, that's
why Linux is so nice, right?  Having that second CPU (or core) really
smooths out system response even when it's getting abused.  The 4200
is about 10% faster than the 3800 based on benchmarks and clock speed
(2.2GHz vs. 2.0GHz) yet costs 20% more.  I plan to run this system for
a long time and 3 years from now I'm not going to care about that 10%
since it'll be slower than anything else around anyway.  I can take
that $150 and do something fun-- like buy a power supply. :-(

Memory: Kingston KVR400X64C3AK2/2G

I would have preferred ECC memory since this board supports it but I'm
going to be "borrowing" some additional memory from a board that
doesn't so I had to go this route.  I've found that higher-end
motherboards tend to be pickier about their memory than cheaper ones
so I go name-brand.  I've also used Crucial memory, but for some
reason they now cost more than Kingston, so Kingston wins.

Video: onboard

This won't be used for games so I'm not too worried about the video. 
If I were, I'd get the lowest clock speed of Nvidia's highest-end
chipset at the time of purchase.  This has generally been a good
price/performance point and runs around $200.  The above board does
NOT support SLI, but Tyan makes an equivalent that does.

Video tends to be a compatibility nightmare, but I've had good luck
with Nvidia's stuff.

Summary:

Remember, I haven't assembled this yet so there may be some issues,
but I hope this gives you some ideas.

Steve,

That sounds very much like what I want to build for myself, except for
the video. Like you, I do no gaming, but I do need something for
serious desktop publishing. Hence, I want that Dell 30" LCD at 2560 x
1600 (or 1200 or whatever it is -- brain is slightly fried from
studying). I think I also want a TV tuner card, and the best DVD
read/write I can get, maybe two of them for copying purposes. And a
very fast hard disk as well. Also I think I want 64-bit Ubuntu. 

But what you outlined above is a good start for what I want to build.
My current Windows 2000 desktop is 3 1/2 years old and stuff is
starting to fail -- already had a close call when the hard disk died. I
want my next desktop to be pure Linux, and it's close to time to build
it.

I have totally saved your list. Please post your experience once the
stuff gets here and you get around to putting it together.

Subject: [PLUG] Linux box losing time
Message-ID: <200603181344.02409.aaron@madebyai.com>

Hey all,

I have this problem on one of my Linux boxes. It seems to lose about a minute of time for every 5 minutes it's on. I've never seen such severe clock skew. Opennptd adjusts the clock by about a minute every 5, so it keeps generally correct time as long s the 'net is up, but I'd like to know why this occurs if anyone might have some suggestions. The box is identical to three other ones I have, running a 2.8GHz prescott with hyperthreading. (Same kernels [built myself] and hardware in every regard). The only big difference is that this box runs a bunch of CPU intensive java proceses. But there's a pretty heavy load on the samba box as well (not as constant though) and it doesn't have problems.

Any ideas or pointers for where to start?

Thanks,
Aaron

Feel free to go to the shack on the corner to pick the cherries out of the fruit, but saying that Dell does not invest in getting their systems to work with linux is false. They actually invest a lot in this and work closely with redhat, suse, novell to get their systems supported. 

This is contrary to my experience, though some of my experience
may be dated - I remember trying to order a Dell desktop that
did not come with a Winmodem. It was impossible - I had to take
out the Winmodem when I received the computer and throw it away.

I tried to order a Dell computer without an operating system and
I was unsuccessful. I still had to pay the Microsoft tax.

On the Dell rack mount 2850, I can't use lmsensors for some reason.
I have to use Dell's proprietary software that does not integrate
well with my scripts.

A few weeks ago, I took delivery of a 1850 and couldn't install my
Linux on it. I had to use Dell's installation disk that required
that I have Red Hat Linux. Of course, I figured out a way around
this but it cost me time and frustration.

I'd rather buy from vendors that don't litter the path with
obstacles.

They won't be here in time for tomorrow's Clinic, but I ordered 20 32-bit and 5 64-bit Ubuntu CDs. Also one for Mac (didn't even know such existed). I'd have ordered more, but Dapper Drake is supposed to be released April 20, according to the current official timetable. By the May Clinic we'll need the new ones. After Dapper Drake is released I'll order a big bunch for our "PLUG box."

I was planning on attending, but I woke up this morning feeling like total
shit, so I'm going to have to rain-check. The current Ubuntu (and even
Ubuntu-Live) ISO's are a bit creepy to get to burn correctly, out of the
last 6 I've burned of each, I've only had 1 success (that is at 4x write
speed...) it could be the media, but I doubt it, it seems to be a widespread
issue in #ubuntu on freenode. I've also ordered 5 Ubuntu Install disks, I
plan on keeping 2 of them but I'll donate the "extra" to the stack.

Also on Dapper, It has been delayed 6 weeks so they can throw some shoe
shine on it and buff out the rough edges. I'm really looking forward to
Dapper tho, it look like it's going to be one solid monkey.

Aaron,

The only time I have seen a clock lose time is when the battery is low. 
The weird thing is that your system is losing time when it is ON.... 
that doesn't make much sense. Even if it is dependent on the system 
clock it should not lose time when it is on, only when it is off.... and 
that normally would restart your system clock to an old time such as 
1999 or 2002 or something as such. Still, if you have a battery laying 
around throw it in there and see if it helps.

Speaking of tabs, the bash shell has a feature called "tab completion",
where you can start a command, then hit tab (multiple times if needed)
to complete the command.  I just found out about it, but from what I
read, it is a bit limited.

For Debian based systems, copy the contents of /etc/bash_completion into
your .bashrc file; don't replace it, just copy the contents.  From the
command line, run:

echo '. /etc/bash_completion' >> ~/.bashrc

Of course you can.  I know that in gnome, you can add an application runner to a panel.  This applet has a drop down that buffers commands, and a check box for running in xterm.  I imagine that KDE has something similar.

Good Luck,

Great!  I'm burning a few CDs right now: 
 Ubuntu 6.04 Flight 5, both Install and LiveCD
 Knoppix 4.0.2
 Debian 3.1r1 CD #1
 Damn Small Linux 2.2b
 Kororaa-XGL LiveCD 0.1 (nifty GUI effects on Geforce and Radeon cards)
 System Rescue CD 0.2.17 (my usual rescue CD)
 Recovery Is Possible 14.9 (worth a try)
 Featherweight Linux LiveCD 1.3
 Oralux 0.6 alpha (LiveCD for Visually Impaired users)

All are the latest version I can find; mostly under 2 months old.

I figure if I have time, I can try 'em out.  If you, Dear Reader, plan
to be there, are there any others you'd like on-hand?  Want your own
copy of one of the above CDs?

See yuz tomorrow,
  Aaron

For whatever it's worth, I have this same issue on a Windows machine -  
have had this problem for several years - though the skew is considerably  
less than in Aarons' case. And it only happens while the machine is  
running and in use; when it starts up again after a shutdown, it  
invariably kicks to the correct time. Have never figured out why.

I've become halfway familiar with the Gnome panel, but I've never run

I've had computers with lousy clocks before, but nothing as bad as what Aaron is describing, except for my experience with my first Linux computer. This was the Compaq R4000 that I ended up returning to HP because I could never get the ATI video to work with Linux. On that machine the clock ran exactly double speed. It was otherwise perfectly accurate. :)

I never got around to fixing it, but there was some discussion of it on Suse's site, and someone also posted there an rpm file which was supposedly a fix. I remember that the cause had something to do with the kernel, and that there were other CPUs where problems cropped up occasionally also.

I know that's not much help, but I just wanted to say that it may be a Linux problem, not a hardware problem, and there may be a fix out there somewhere.

Thanks, I was pretty sure I've heard of issues with Linux's clock before. I believe the kernel keeps it's own idea of time, that's why most distros set the HW clock via the 'system clock' on shutdown. I'm sure the hardware clock is fine.

I've had a system be fast about time before, and gotten messages in the system log about the kernel "losing too many ticks". I googled a bit for information and to the best I can interpret what comes back, if the system is too overloaded the kernel might 'push forward' it's internal clock to compensate for losing interrupts, but that would make it skip forward, not back. And mine's definitely losing time.

I think I'll stop all the services and see if the system loses time with nothing running. I suspect it's java causing the problem somehow.

If you're doing all of those, I'll make a few of Breezy 32-bits, both
install and live. I'm supposed to be studying, but it doesn't take
active participation to download and burn them. Besides, I have a fast

open Gnomebaker, which I've never used before, but it appears pretty
straightforward. I start the process and a few seconds later Gnomebaker
just disappears.

So I open a terminal and launch it from the command line. I repeat the
process. And this time when it disappears the terminal says
"Segmentation fault."

OK, screw it. I knew Gnomebaker wasn't going to work the minute I
launched it. The menus and buttons were simple to understand and it was
just too easy to use. This is, after all, Linux, right?

So after I toss Gnomebaker in the bin, what do y'all suggest I replace it
with?

Dude.  You should totally demand a refund.

You might try xcdroast or k3b.  I just use cdrecord so I wouldn't know 
what all the buttons are for.

The website says April 20. Does the six week delay mean end of 
May? Or is that already reflected in the April 20 date?
 
I agree it looks like it is going to be awesome. I can't wait. 
Besides, I'll finally be able to get OpenOffice.org 2.02 instead of the 
1.93.129 that I'm currently stuck with. Plus, according to Ubuntu 
forums, if you're using the proprietary NVidia driver you won't have 
to reinstall it after the upgrade.

I thought it would be a good day to do a backup of what I think is
important on my system.  It has been a while, maybe 4 months.

So I try to remember the secret incantation to produce non-coaster DVDs
on my Fedora Release Candidate 4 system.  I remember it's cdrecord as
the command line.  But since I do have some DVD's and a writer, why not
use them?  So I start with dvdrecord.  Hmmm, what device is it?

OK,  we are cooking, now.

But, first I need to make an iso file of the data I need to backup. Now,
let's see how much data.

>du -sh /stuff
6.9G /stuff

Wow! That's not going to fit on a DVD that only takes 4.7G.

I pare it down to Just one directory that is 4.1G.

mkisofs -o /tmp/cd.iso /lessStuff

It does it thing.

Now I can create my DVD.

dvdrecord -dao -data -v speed=4 dev=0,1,0 /tmp/lessStuff

Can't open device.  Google, Gooooooogle, and some more Goooooooogling.

Then in the back of I don't know when and a few readings of the man
cdrecord on my system, I find it.  Need to add a device name to the dev
option.

dvdrecord -dao -data -v  speed=4 dev=ATA:0,1,0 /tmp/lessStuff

Viola, a Data DVD.

Totally! Ummm, is there a form I need to fill out for that?

Ah. Well, as it turns out X-CD-Roast was already installed. Ubuntu 
must've done that, because I don't remember installing it. In any 
event, I tried running it, only to be greeted with an announcement 
that the first time it is run it must be configured by root. So I sudo-
launched it from a command line. But that's about as far as I got. I 
tried several times to get it configured, but to no avail. Plus, it 
couldn't find the DVD-RW drive. How lame is that? And to top it all, 
it uses that sucky-ugly GTK 1.2 interface that I can't change 
because the right librares aren't available in Synaptic.

Moving on, I tried K3b. As soon as I installed it I realized I had 
already used it once before a long time ago when I was still futzing 
around with that R4000 laptop. I also had it for a while under 
Ubuntu. I had uninstalled it only because it's one of those annoying 
KDE apps that screw up Gnome. These apps work just fine, and 
then later the user needs to log in again, only to be told that the 
user's last session lasted less than 10 seconds, so the system 
isn't going to let him log in any more. Problem is with 
.ICEauthority, and the solution is just to delete .ICEauthority, as a 
new .ICEauthority will be created as soon as the user logs in. It's a 
known and frequently yelled about bug.

Anyway, K3b works just fine and I burned two each of the Install 
and Live Ubuntu-32 CDs. In fact, I really think I like K3b better than 
Gnomebaker, in spite of its clownish KDE interface. Did I mention 
that I don't like KDE? :):)

Thanks for the suggestions.

John,

  If you find the ISO file in your file manager, then click on it, the 
default application should start. (If one exists.) Otherwise, I can 
vouch for k3b, and it's fairly easy to get used to.

Is it possible to have multiple identities using Thunderbird (ver 1.0.7)?
My wife would like to use this program.  We share a computer at this 
point and have very different methods of keeping emails sorted.  I 
wonder if I could have Thunderbird running on separate virtual desktops 
with a his and hers distinction.  Evolution has some limitations I 
haven't figured out how to conquer and she likes what she sees on my

Y'all are using the same preferences - the same username?  Do you share 
an email box as well?

I'd just run it under a different user name (one for you, one for her) 
and then allow her to set her preferences as she likes them.

Or am I misunderstanding something?

Thunderbird can certainly do this.  What you are calling identities
Thunderbird calls profiles.  Instead of directly starting Thunderbird,
use the Thunderbird Profile Manager.  There is probably a profile
already there called default, that is your profile. Now you just have
to create a new profile for your wife   On one virtual desktop start
Thunderbird with your profile, and on the other virtual desktop start
Thunderbird with your wifes profile.
Here is more information about profiles

Yup, you can do this.  I run 8 to 10 virtual desktops each for a 
different user, each one with their own thunderbird mail client and 
firefox broswer.  The only issue I have had is that sometimes the window 
comes up in the wrong workspace but I think that was a result of adding 
workspaces and introducing confusion.

As happens every once in a while, Firefox locked up my computer. No
mouse, no keyboard, everything dead. 

First question: Is there any escape from this situation other than the
power button? I mean, I know how to Ctrl-Alt-F1 and then Ctrl-Alt-F7
back, and how to kill a program when I'm in there. But you can't
Ctrl-Alt-F1 when the keyboard is dead. It's most annoying to have to
shut down when it's probably just one app that has gone berserk.

Second question: When I restarted I had not removed the new thumb drive
from it's little home in USB-land. It was still sitting there glowing
bluely. But when I restarted the computer hung on Configuing Modules.
This normally takes only a second or two. I killed the boot with the
power button, removed the thumb drive, and restarted. This time it
booted normally.

This is a SanDisk Cruzer 512 MB, that seems to work fine otherwise. Is
there something wrong with my system if it hangs the boot process when
it is installed during boot? Is it fixable, or must I remember never to
have the thumb drive installed while booting?

I haven't done it in quite awhile, but you can use Nautilus, at least 
for simple CD-R burning.  I would think it could manage to create a 
bootable CD-R from an ISO.

It's a fairly simple interface, not unlike burning from Explorer under 
Windows or Finder under OS X.  That is to say, you're not going to get 
all the fancy options you'd get from a dedicated app like k3b or from 
the command-line.  But you don't need them if you're just burning an 
ISO.  It's brain-dead simple to create a bootable CD-R from Finder -- I 
have several Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, and OpenBSD PPC install discs to 
prove it!  I don't remember it being much more complicated using Nautilus.

While trying to back up files to my DVD drive Nautilus ate 14 GB of
mp3s. Nautilus is now banned from my computer.

But I found success in K3b. :)

This may not be the problem, but I had similar issue with a box that
continually ran fast (or slow) -- in spite of NTP running, etc.

If your BIOS supports Spread Spectrum frequency, try the following:  Go to
the "Advanced Chipset Features" menu. Set the options "FSB *Spread* *
Spectrum*" and "AGP *Spread* *Spectrum*" to DISABLED.

Heh, I use 'less' frequently, but I didn't know about half of those.  I 
default to the up-down arrow keys and 'page up' 'page down' keys.  I 
guess I will never really be a keyboard shortcut guru, despite my 
preference for keys over the rodent.

I was reading the vim documentation a few weeks ago and noted how 
disparaging the docs were of using PgUp/PgDwn and arrow keys over 
'h-j-k-l' for navigating because you have to *reach* *all* *the* *way* 
over to the right to access those keys.  It's not enough to avoid 
reaching for the mouse, now you have limit yourself firmly to the 
alphabet and shift/meta keys to achieve keyboard shortcut nirvana. 
These people must type 300wpm! :-)

Well, I'm glad I asked ... everyone had lots of great suggestions, even 
if some of them don't work for me right now.  Regarding building my own 
machine, down the road I will.  And I've been participating in Free 
Geek's build program, so I know it's not that hard.  Unfortunately, I've 
had to stop for awhile because I came down with pneumonia.  But I'm 
starting to feel better and hope I'll be able to resume in a week or 
two.  The hard thing is not so much the mechanics of it, but knowing 
what you want and what makes sense and what works together.  That takes 
a lot of research, if you're not fairly conversant with the options.  I 
think it's easy for people who are to forget how much more daunting a 
task seems to someone who isn't.  And this is especially true when you 
find wildly conflicting information about what's supported, by whom, and 
under what circumstances.  Searching Google/Linux for a particular piece 
of hardware turns up data that's sometimes two or three years 
out-of-date and might not be relevant anymore.  Sifting through that 
plus through the mountain of completely irrelevant stuff that turns up 
is a chore, not to mention sorting out the information that's accurate 
from someone's misdiagnoses of a problem.  I just don't think it's 
something you can do in the course of a week and come to completely 
satisfactory conclusions, unless you're already starting with a good 
baseline of foreknowledge about what you're interested in.  It strikes 
me from the comments many of you made that these are things you've been 
doing or thinking about for quite sometime.  Plus, it would be nice to 
see some of this stuff I've been reading about and I really don't have 
the energy right now to make a field trip.  So, for me, assembling the 
parts to build a box is more of a long-term project than something I can 
accomplish while I'm recovering.  Maybe I'm making it more difficult 
than it needs to be, but I have a tendency to do that sometimes anyway. 
  So there you are.

So I know you're all waiting with baited breath to know what I've 
decided.  :-)

I ordered a machine from these folk: http://groovix.com/solutions.html

The prices are decent if not exceptional, the machines are sufficiently 
configurable that I could get a couple of things I knew I wanted and 
trust that they know what they're doing with the rest.  They seem to use 
good parts, and obviously everything should be compatible because they 
load Ubuntu.  It's kinda nice to be supporting a company that's trying 
to make a go of supporting Linux for home use.  Even if it has a dumb 
name.  (Groovix?  WTF?)  It'll be interesting to get a machine with 
Linux that someone else has installed.  And it'll be my first AMD 
machine.  So I'm psyched.

Now if it would just get here already!

[While I was writing this message I managed to burn a piece of toast and 
set off the smoke alarm.  You see, technology hates me.]

I have tried four Linux's on a Qwest DSL line. The only one that was able 
to browse the web "out of the box" was Knoppix. Ubuntu, FC3 and FC4 didn't 
work. (Knoppix was the only one without FireFox.) I downloaded the Debian 
single CD version and installed it. It couldn't find two different mirrors 
to begin installing. Presumably another victim of the Qwest DSL line.

FC3 & FC4 both worked after changing the primary DNS from the local modem 
to the Qwest one:  205.171.3.65 and changing the secondary DNS to: 
205.171.2.65. Unfortunately these revert back after a reset (or perhaps it 
was a power cycle).

FC4 also seems to have lost my ML-2010 Samsung printer after it was working 
when I left the computer and printer at a friend's place for use on their 
Qwest DSL.

Needless to say it is highly embarrassing to leave a working computer for a 
friend to use, only to find that it can't serf or print the next day. Is 
there a less troublesome distribution around and where do I get it?

Thanks
JK

ctrl-alt-backspace will restart your x-windows, but you said "no
keyboard"

You can try to log in from another system using ssh.  Kill your kdm
session.  The init task will respauwn it.

How about control-r? If you're comfortable using the tab-key expansion, 
then it's probably not to big a jump to searching your command history. At 
a command prompt, hold the control key, press the "r" key, and type in the 
text you're searching for.

So, in the case you mentioned, hit control-r and type "resolv" (sans 
quotes). *If* you've issued the command recently, it should appear. If it 
doesn't, hit control-r again - which should take you to a prior match (if 
there is one).

Just curious - does anyone know the simplest route to getting mplayer to 
work on SuSE 10?  There's no rpm for it in the included package set, and 
the version of gcc included is one that the mplayer developers strongly 
warn against using... but I'd rather avoid having to install a whole 
separate gcc just to build mplayer.

Without mplayer, I'm stuck trying to use kaffeine (emphasis on "trying") 
as a multimedia player.  (In my personal experience, kaffeine is the most 
worthless piece of OSS ever in the history of the world - I have never, 
once, in 3 different versions of SuSE on 3 different machines, been able 
to view a single file with it.)

Not sure if this is the exact package you're looking for (i.e. player?
plugin?), but here's the official, unofficial web site that supports mplayer
for SuSE:

You're better off compiling it from source. It's not that bad.
If you use a precompiled package it has to do run time CPU
Detection, which will effect performance.

You could use aliases for some of this.  Take the command you want to
use later, copy it verbatim, then make a line like this in your
.bashrc file (at the end, to be safe )

    alias chrootResolv="sudo ln -f /chroot/breezy/32bits/resolv.conf
/etc/resolv.conf"

(where chrootResolv is the name of your "new" command)
load the new .bashrc with

    source ~/.bashrc

(or open a new terminal)
and run chrootResolv to build your link...

You can also use the .bash_history file for a lot of what you want. 
Dan Haskell already mentioned using ctrl-r (which I *strongly*
recommend also -- you can just keep hitting ctrl-r to get to what you
want, at which point hit enter to run it, or use the arrow keys to
move the cursor and make modifications).  There are other tricks also,
though:  command history (up/down keys scroll through recent
commands), and you can grep the .bash_history file directly, if you
want (or cat, tail, less, etc...)

At one point I put it in cvs, and added the ci/update commands to my
.bash_login / logout files, but that became problematic..

If you hit tab twice (eg: /etc/ <tab><tab> ) you get a list of all the
possible completions, from which you can narrow the search.

One thing I was wondering is whether Gentoo would work best with this 
issue.  One of the USE flag options in Gentoo is IPv6 support, meaning 
that you can strip it out of the kernel and every app that is IPv6 aware 
by compiling with the IPv6 USE flag turned off globally.  I would think 
that might take care of the problem until Qwest starts supporting IPv6, 
but that's just a guess on my part.  You might ask in a Gentoo forum if 
you think it's worth investigating.

Of course, technically, you could recompile everything in any distro 
with customizations, including removing IPv6 support, but Gentoo is the 
only distro I know of that is set up to make that kind of thing easy. 
It would be a PITA on Debian, maybe less of one on Slackware.

This is another reason I'm going to investigate FreeBSD when I get my 
new computer.  I do not have this issue under OS X, it works fine.  OS X 
uses a BSD-variant subsystem (it rides on top of a Darwin kernel), so my 
bet is that FreeBSD would not have this problem either.  I seriously 
doubt that Windows has this issue either, or I imagine we all would have 
heard much more about it.  From what I've read, Microsoft lifts some of 
the Windows network stack from BSD, which is another reason to suspect 
that the BSDs don't have this problem.  I'm kind of dismayed at the fact 
that this has been a Linux issue since at least 2004 and still has not 
been fixed.  Far be it from me to question the priorities of the Linux 
kernel developers, but I would think this is an issue that should get 
higher priority than it has.  There's a thread in the Ubuntu developers' 
forum that discusses this problem in which one of the contributers said 
some people have told him "I tried Ubuntu, but the internet didn't 
work."  So they went back to Windows.  This isn't a good strategy for 
spreading Linux adoption.

Thanks to everybody for the suggestions.  I'm finding that the 
RPM-dependency hell involved in installing the suggested rpm is 
particularly severe; it may be just as painful installing from rpm as 
installing a second gcc and building from source. More so, it looks like.

Rhetorical question: why can't a tool as feature-bloated as rpm 
recursively resolve dependencies?

Hello!

I have personal experience with Pacific Solutions and they will build what 
ever you want. I have used them consistently for over 6 years and have always 
found them to be knowledgeable and excellent with help.

They do not advertise as a Linux shop however, I have found them to be an 
excellent resource on this issue. They build my first Linux machine back when 
Red hat was at 5.0. 

I cannot recommend them highly enough.

Thanks,

Dale F. Victor

It does recursively resolve dependencies (me thought).  However, the
depended-upon RPM packages must be available in order for recursive
resolution to occur.  Ok... It was a rhetorical question and I'm stating the
obvious...

So, when is it a good time to recommend a distro change?  Never?  Fair
enough, but there are distros that are just as easy to use as their RPM
counterparts, but do not subject a user to RPM hell.  Just a thought ;-)

Finally something I might know a bit about!  kaffeine is just a gui for
mplayer.  Just issue the command "mplayer" on the command line.
naturally some thing like this 

# mplayer path/to/the/file/you/want/to/play.avi,mpg,mov,ect,ect

you should get something like this after issueing the command

MPlayer dev-CVS-051220-04:08-4.0.1 (C) 2000-2005 MPlayer Team
CPU: Advanced Micro Devices  (Family: 15, Stepping: 2)
CPUflags:  MMX: 1 MMX2: 1 3DNow: 1 3DNow2: 1 SSE: 1 SSE2: 1
Compiled with runtime CPU detection - WARNING - this is not optimal!
To get best performance, recompile MPlayer with
--disable-runtime-cpudetection.


89 audio & 203 video codecs
Usage:   mplayer [options] [url|path/]filename

and then a list of all the options available.  


If you get some kind of error then there is a problem somewhere.  But
mplayer on the command line should give you a pretty exact error. 

Do you know if you have all the win32 codecs installed?  

If you do compile by hand, you will have to find the mplayer plugins
folder and just extract the codecs there and make sure all users have
permissions to use the codecs.  I really dont know where Suse puts this
folder as I'm a lazy Mandriva user.

Does Suse have repositories for programs they cannot include because of
copyright issues?  That might be what you need.   


I hope that helps...

Subject: [PLUG] A wiki for plug
Message-ID: <20060320170035.GA9369@gate.kl-ic.com>


Is it possible/practical for PLUG to have a wiki?  There is content
(such as the times and locations of Advanced Topics and of the Linux
clinic) that may change with time, and that needs to reach a wider
audience than the users of the mailing lists.  

I could set up a PLUG wiki at my site, with pointers from the main
PLUG site, but that would be a little confusing.  

Here are four options (out of hundreds) for wiki software:

MediaWiki - the software behind Wikipedia, also used at Free Geek.  PHP.
PMwiki    - another user friendly PHP wiki.
MoinMoin  - a Python wiki, Personaltelco uses this.
Kwiki     - a Perl wiki, which I use because I like Perl.

I don't know how difficult it is to set up the first three, and of
course the decision of which Wiki (if any) to use will depend on 
what is easy for Wil (or whoever) to set up.  It would be handy to
have a Wiki that can export the database to new Wiki formats as the
technology improves.

I'll add a pitch for Trac:

   http://trac.edgewall.com/

It's loosely based on MoinMoin, but it includes support for trouble 
tickets and a project roadmap. (It also includes tie-ins to a 
subversion repo, though that feature would be of dubious value to the 
plug site).

I'd be more than happy to provide some overview and how-to info 
(permissions, SELinux interaction, Apache config) if there's interest.

'yum' (standard with FC) does resolve rpm deps - really well.

Yes, the alias command can be a very good friend.  If you just type 'alias',
it will list all of your aliases, which may suffice as your menu of
commands.

Plus they work with tab completion in bash.  I like to add a hyphen to
standard commands and then some descriptive text, for aliases that add my
favorite options.  So I have an alias for CVS updates, for example:

	cvs -q update -Pd

And the alias is "cvs-update".  So I can type "cvs-" and hit tab a couple
times, and I get a list of all my aliases for using cvs.

Opennptd adjusts the clock by about a minute every 5, so it keeps generally correct time as long s the 'net is up, but I'd like to know why this occurs if anyone might have some suggestions. The box is identical to three other ones I have, running a 2.8GHz prescott with hyperthreading. (Same kernels [built myself] and hardware in every regard). The only big difference is that this box runs a bunch of CPU intensive java proceses. But there's a pretty heavy load on the samba box as well (not as constant though) and it doesn't have problems.

What kernel version are you running?  I have seen serious clock skew
problems with Opteron dual-core processors.  The problem was a kernel
bug which selected an unstable clock source for the dual-core
processors.  I wouldn't be too surprised is a similar problem affected
Intel SMP processors.  It is also possible to force the kernel to use
a more stable (but slower) clock source.

In addition to separate profiles, Thunderbird does support multiple
accounts in one profile.  And multiple identities (name and email
address) for a single account.  For example, at home I have work,
home, etc accounts.  And my home account has two different email
addresses associated with it.  There is a dropdown while composing
email which allows selecting the identity.

If you share an email account, then multiple identities is the way to
select the name on outgoing email.  If you don't share email accounts,
I would suggest having separate profiles.  Even better, have separate
Linux users.

It seems particularly ironic considering that the PLUG webmaster (at

The profiles seem to have solved the problem for now.  In the future I 
hope to return to separate computers.  I think I will do some research 
into separate users...the old win box required a log out and log in as a 
different user.  I wasn't aware that Linux did the something 
similar...most likely because I hadn't run into this problem yet.
Since Google is my friend, I won't ask the obvious question.

Isn't there an embedded version of Perl?  I imagine that would have
all the modules you'd need for xml stuff.

Bruce,

   Winduhs is inherently a single-user, single-tasking OS; linux (as are all
unices) is an inherently multi-tasking and multi-user OS. That's why you can
log into your linux box six or more times, by yourself. If you are running
the X Window System, press alt-ctrl-F2 and you'll have a new login prompt on
the console. You can log in again there. It takes a bit more to run two
separate X Window System sessions, but it can be done.

   Read 'man adduser' for your distribution. It lets you have multiple users
(you add them as root). Then you and your wife can log in individually and
have your own data files while sharing applications. However, unless you have
a separate workstation for her, only one of you can control the monitor and
keyboard at any given time.

FWIW, it's trivial to run more than one X session (my wife and I share
terminals this way).  If startx works for you, just log in to a
virtual console and type the command:

  $ startx -- :1

or
 
  $ startx -- :<n>

Switch back to the first X session with ctrl-alt-F7, and to the new
one with ctrl-alt-F8.  Additional sessions land on F9, F10, etc.

I've noticed in particular messages from Keith Lofstrom are being rejected by my mailserver when sent through the PLUG list, because he's got SPF for his domain configured properly. I also have SPF configured for my domain, so I'd guess that he's not getting my messages (and possibly other people's).

Obviously the entire idea behind SPF is to work this way, so my question is, why does mailman set the sender to the post submitter when forwarding to each subscriber? It seems like a better way would be to leave the sender as PLUG at lists.pdxlinux.org and note the originator of the message in reply-to or something. And since I doubt anyone wants to change how it works, what's the best way to deal with this issue on my end and anyone else who's using SPF?

Should we all add SPF records allowing the PLUG mailserver to send on our behalf? That seems like a cheap hack to me.

Comments appreciated,
Aaron

I'm running 2.6.15. I don't think it's that sort of bug since the other three identical systems aren't having the problem.

I've been meaning to find a lull time (when everyone's asleep) to stop all the processes on the box and see if it still loses time. I'm fairly suspicious of java for some reason, maybe something I heard once.

Thanks for the suggestion, though.

Aaron,

   I have SPF enabled in my DNS record, but haven't read of a rejection from
anyone because of that.

This isn't the only thing SPF breaks. Just ...don't. SPF is one of the 
worst ideas ever.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0603201654460.2141@PPC.DavidMandel.com>


Suppose I'm configuring apache2 to run the web site, DavidMandel.com
and I want users to be able to get to it by pointing to:

           http://DavidMandel.com
      or
           http://www.DavidMandel.com

Assume that I already have an A record in my DNS for both addresses.

Do I need to build two separate files in my vhost.d directory:
              DavidMandel.com with "ServerName DavidMandel.com"
          www.DavidMandel.com with "ServerName www.DavidMandel.com"
or is there is better, more elegant way of handling the problem?


                                          Sincerely,

But the thing is, doing this is wrong, because some folks do have access
to IPv6 tunnels. What I have to wonder is, how are the modules getting
loaded in the first place? I've yet to see an installer that installs
IPv6 support by default. Are these ISPs perhaps sending broken packets
that are triggering the installers to detect the presence of native IPv6?

Didn't the previously mentioned bug report on Debian say 2.6.15 fixed it?
For a while the USAGI project (http://www.linux-ipv6.org/) had been
working on IPv6 conformance, while the kernel fell behind on actual
support. I think the kernel got its first infusion from USAGI in 2.6.11,
after a lot of work to get the maintainers to accept patches.

Keith replies:
1)  I was told I should set up SPF, and I followed a cookbook formula
to set it up, but frankly I did not take the time to understand what
I was doing, and I may have made a mistake.  I am encouraged that you
(Aaron) say I did it right.

2)  I get the PLUG list as a digest, so I do see your messages to the
list that way.  

3)  I have not received any messages from you directly.  If you or
anyone else is expecting some response from a mail you sent to me,
then perhaps I do *not* have SPF set up correctly.  Or perhaps I am
a lazy weasel and ignoring your mail.

4)  I have postgrey set up on my incoming mail server.  Some ISPs
are broken and can't handle the retries required.  That might be
another reason I am not getting mail from you.  I have not seen
any log messages regarding madebyai.com , though, and I log all
the failed attempts (about 11,000 per day).

David,

If I'm not mistaken, it doesn't really matter what you name the files, 
it is just a directory from which all files are included my some 
typeglob in the main apache config.  Naming the configs after the 
domain is just a convention to make it easier to find.  Most (all?) of 
the newer styles of apache config layout are just convention rather 
than hard-and-fast rules.

To slightly elaborate on what Charlie said:  Best to just add a 
ServerAlias entry to your existing VirtualHost section.

MediaWiki is dead simple to set up and configure.  Last time I installed

How embedded?  There's a small perl interpreter out there, but I don't 
know how it does with XML processing.  Looks like microperl and miniperl 
are the two things you'd want to look at.

I run ~10 KDE workspaces each with several windows open - mostly 
browsers and mail clients and terminals.  The system is also my mail 
server and listserv server.  After a period of no user activity, it 
seems that there is nothing in memory except the disk cache.  When I get 
back from $tarbuck$ and user activity resumes, there is significant 
latency while the disk beats it's brains out reloading everything back 
into memory (like 20-30 seconds for thunderbird to get it's brains back, 
for instance).  Is there any way to keep the applications from being 
swapped out in favor of (what I am assuming is) the disk cache?

Turn off swap?  E.g.:

  # swapoff -a

MediaWiki is dead-simple to set up, but has a steep learning curve for
anything but simple customizations.

Kwiki is in Perl, which means it's dead-simple to set up, but has a
steep...

One advantage of MediaWiki is that it seems to have nice features for "recent
change patrol" people... who can watch for vandalism on their pages of
interest, and the revert-to-prior versions is almost painless.

Because, that needs to be your number two concern... what to do with vandals.

Depends on how much RAM you have, how much stuff you have in memory,
and what the OOM-killer wants to whack first.

You could try tuning the kernel's "swappiness" value:
/proc/sys/vm/swappiness

What kernel version are you running?  I recall this behavior when I had 2.4x
but it ceased when I upgraded to a 2.6x version kernel.

I'm sure we can all think of suitable punishments; the challenge is how 
to track them back to their homes & inflict said punishment. Then there 
is the issue that one man's vandal is another man's free speech hero.
Not that anyone actually believes that line, but it's amazing what some 
people will post & expect to receive a serious response.

No, I'm not speaking from experience.

A particular type of vandal, mainly spammers, should be the number one
concern. Yes, there are active spambots out there that add tons of spammy
links onto Wikis. Any new and upcoming Internet thing needs to be
prepared to handle Spammers. Yes, they really are dirty enough to spam
*anything*. Just an issue of how large a target you need to be before
they start writing bots to attack.

One thing I thought was interesting about Groovix's
( http://groovix.com/solutions.html ) options is that they make a point
of stressing the multi-user capabilities in Linux.  They set-up their
buying configuration options so that it is easy for you to buy one
computer (CPU) with multiple terminals, which of course is less
expensive than buying multiple workstations.  And they will
pre-configure the OS for as many users as you want.  They point out how
easy it is to play multi-player games from the same computer with each
player getting their own terminal.  Semi-savvy Linux users know all this
already, but they seem to be aiming as much or more at Windows users who
wouldn't have thought of it.  It's a selling point I had not noticed any
consumer-oriented Linux vendors emphasizing before.

   After running for years without problems I've hit what may be a hardware
(RAM) problem that's affecting my backups. I'd greatly appreciate some help
in figuring out the source of this error.

   When I checked mail this morning (after the first incremental backup
following a successful full backup last Friday night), I had the following
e-mail message from root:

>From root at appl-ecosys.com Tue Mar 21 06:02:46 2006

To: rshepard at appl-ecosys.com

Tue Mar 21 06:00:55 PST 2006 - Started BRU Level 1 Backup\n\tcommand = 'bru
-c -vvZ -n /etc/BRULEVEL0 -f /dev/st0 /'
Tue Mar 21 06:02:46 PST 2006 - ERROR IN BRU BACKUP, check log file:
'/tmp/brulog'

   I looked at the log and it just ended at this line:

bru: [I245] "/usr/lib/qt-3.3.4/examples/textedit/textedit.h": skipped file,
excluded by -n flag

   The log file size is 18.3M, so there's no point in mailling it to anyone.
Now the error message in the second e-mail from root was:

/bin/incbru: line 119: 18733 Segmentation fault      $BRUCMD >$LOGFILE 2>&1
incbru: ERROR in BRU Backup

   Line 119 is the end of an IF statement; the instruction to write to the
logfile is actuallly about line 113, but that's immaterial.

   I tried running the backup with a manual start rather than the cron job,
and it halted at the same place.

   Both yesterday morning (when I went to log in after being gone for several
days), and this morning when I went to log in, I saw the results of the seg
fault dump on the console. Here is probably what I saw:

You may have a corroupted file.  First copy it to a new name.  diff them 
to make sure it is truely copied.  Then remove the old file followed by 
a rename ( mv ) of the new file.

Rod,

   No, that's not it. I tried this three times, the last time moving that file
out of the directory. The backup halted on the next file.

   When I try to list the contents of that directory I also get a seg fault.
Now, I can 'ls /usr/lib/qt-3.3.4/examples' just fine; I can even cd there.
But, attempts to list the files in the textedit/ directory, or to cd there,
produce a segmentation fault.

   What does that information add to your understanding?

Thanks,

Rich

Terror.  Well at least concern.  I've seen this happen as a disk started 
to fail.  My first moves have been to restart the system; sometimes by 
hitting the power or rest button; forcing it to see an unclean shutdown 
and allowing you to check the partitions.  ( I'm sure there is some 
really-cool/total-sysadmin method to do this but I like low-hanging 
fruit and it has worked on almost every distribution I've tried. )
   If this fixes the problem I breathe a sigh relief and think of 
budgeting a replacement/backup drive.  If this fixes the problem for a 
while then I get _really_ concerned and start looking for a new drive.

Last time this happened ( a month or so ago ) it was the swap partition 
kept _going away_.  Since the system was going to be re-purposed I just 
did a clean install including a repartition of the drive(s).  The system 
is still very lightly loaded -- processing-wise and diskusage -- so I 
don't know if this was some file system corruption or a bad disk.  This 
reminds me I need to stress that system a bit. :-)


Other more knowledgable should be following up on your post s owe might 
get a better answer.

Try the following:
* Reboot into a Knoppix Live CD (or other live CD)
* Mount the hard drive partition READ ONLY:
1) In Knoppix, just right-click the drive-like icon and choose one of the
mount options
2) From a command prompt, enter: /bin/mount -n -o remount,ro /
* From a command prompt, enter: /sbin/fsck -T -C -a /

>From the way you describe things, you should see complaints from fsck.

Good idea, having backups ;-)

Forgot to add: One of the best ways to check main memory is to adjust your
BIOS to do a "complete" memory check.

It's convenient because it's one of the few ways to do a check without also
using some of the memory being checked (e.g. real tough to do when there's
an operating system running) and it's always available -- i.e. no need to
hunt down your diagnostics Floppy.

(You'll probably want to put the BIOS back to "quick" check mode, or each
reboot will be painfully slow.)

I think I prefer Jon's suggestion of running fsck from a CD, but here's
a way to run fsck on an idle system.  I don't think an unclean shutdown
is a good idea.  The only exception I can think of is if you just
entered something liked rm -f /.

Logout from any X11 session.
Login as root on a vt.
#telinit s               #go to single user mode
run fsck

Does anyone know how to tell the addresses that a Windows 2000 computer gets from Comcast cable? 

So I spent almost all day yesterday at PSU and had no problems. I just left the computer sitting when I got home because it was late. This morning I plugged it into the ethernet, which goes through the hub to the router to the cable modem, and always just "works." Then I turned on the power and waited for it to boot, First thing I did was to run the link command to copy the DNS addresses from /etc/resolv.conf to the copy in chroot, because otherwise I wouldn't able to go anywhere with Firefox. Then I launched Sylpheed to check e-mail, using the "Get All" button on the toolbar (I have three accounts set up in Sylpheed). It happily went to two of the servers, but said that the connection failed on one of them. Note that Sylpheed is running in 64-bit world, so it should not need the link command to go anywhere. Puzzled, I swiveled my chair around and tried it with Pegasus on the Windows desktop. No problem getting to that account.

Then I launched Firefox (in chroot) and tried to go places. It would go some places, but not others. I re-ran the link command, but it made no difference. I opened System > Administration > Networking and disabled eth0, then restarted it. Still no go. All my internet apps would go to some places but not others. Using the Windows computer I pinged some of the places that the laptop couldn't find, then pinged the IP address from the laptop, and the laptop could find the server. So it's a DNS issue. And throughout, the Windows desktop could go anywhere. I don't get this. Somehow the laptop is not getting the DNS server entries from the network, but I know little about how these things work. It just seems to me that it should work 100% or not at all. It's acting like my house wiring when one side of the incoming lines is down -- half the circuits work and the other half are dead.

Eventually I shut down the laptop and restarted it. That finally resolved the issue. However, this is not the first time this has happened. And I seriously need this computer for at least another day and a half until finals are over, 'cause it's got everything on it. It's all backed up, but I don't have time to rebuild things until Friday. Someone please tell me the problem is simple!

from the command line run
ipconfig
that will tell you your ip info

if you need to release and restart it do this... You may or may not need 
*_all*
ipconfig /realease_all
then either restart your system or
ipconfig /renew_all

Message-ID: <200603210858.59900.alex@daniloff.com>

Hello Linux folkz,
I went to this web site:
http://greenwichmeantime.com/gmt-timestamp.htm

and saw that they somehow read the time stamp right from
my PC. 
I'm behind the firewall and all ports are in stealth mode
I wonder, how they do this. Is it a part of TCP/IP protocol or
environmental variable of my browser?

Thanks in advance for any replies.

You pc doesn't get info from comcast.
Comcast gives to modem
Modem gives to PC or router
Router gives to PC

Unplug your modem for a minute and restart it. turn off your system, 
turn off the router.
after a minute turn on your modem
then after it is completely linked to the network
restart your router
once it is up
restart your pc

that should fix any of your connection issues, if it doesn't then call 
comcast... they may have a line down.

Sure.  I already have instances of Kwiki, MediaWiki and MoinMoin.  I've
mainly used MoinMoin (for http://nakedape.cc/wiki) and defeated spamming
by requiring sign-ups and using some anti-spam features in MoinMoin.
It's kind of an old version though; I think I need a newer version of
Python than ships with RHEL3.  I've built a back-port of the current
Python release, but I haven't installed it and updated MoinMoin yet.

 Undoubtably,  quite a bit of info is contained the http conversation
between your browser and the web server.  Fire up tcpdump or ethereal
and capture the session to see all the information that changes hands. 
Very informative.

Nothing fancy going on here, just a javascript in the page that reads your system clock via the browser. Starts at about line 414 in the source for me, if you're interested.

There is a standard HTTP "Date" header, but user agents rarely, if ever, send it. Usually it's for the server to tell the UA what timezone they're in.

Take a peek at the source for the page and you'll see the javascript
that grabs the date and time; it's something your browser provides.

You forgot the step just before a: Spend hours re-learning about this
month's memory standard, PCI standard, verifying Linux-compatibility,
comparing price/performance, shopping all over the 'net finding the very
cheapest parts, waiting weeks for them to arrive, re-ording memory
because the first stick was damaged...

Last time I had to build a PC I went to a local vendor, told them
roughly what I wanted and paid them $50 to assemble it (no cuts on my
hands afterwards and the memory was tested reasonably well before I
walked out with it).

Yuck.  I toyed with the idea of getting into system building, but
quickly realized I wasn't going to do it in the volume I'd need to do it
efficiently.  I've more or less settled on local vendors for lower-end
systems and vendors like Pogo for servers.

Heh.  Yours is the better, simpler way. (Was trying to make it simple --
more GUI based -- but simple is relative, I suppose :)

There can be problems if the CPU clock rate that the kernel discovers by
probing is different than that it really is (by, say, several hundred
MHz--don't be confused if your 3GHz CPU is reported as 2992.626GHz--the
3GHz is just rounding).  You can use the 'hwclock' program to see query
the hardware clock directly to verify that it's the kernel and not the
system clock.  You might want to check that your motherboard has the
current BIOS/firmware version.  'dmidecode' can be useful to compare
your systems.

Don't reject messages with conflicting SPF records wholesale.
Generally, don't reject messages based on only a single test--you'll
wind up with too many false positives (unless it's a really good, really
reliable test).  That's why I prefer the scoring mechanism SpamAssassin
uses.

But the sender /isn't/ the mailing list; the sender is... the sender.
The mailing list is just the forwarder.  Reply-to is something
altogether different.

Or just whitelist the list server itself, since yours is in the minority
of ones with problems.

Subject: [PLUG] Reconfiguring for change of CD hardware
Message-ID: <44204DC0.3070509@comcast.net>

I recently had to replace the power supply on this machine. The new one 
has fewer "regular" connectors, the ones used for hard drives and CD 
drives, than the old one. With the old one I had a CD-ROM drive and a 
CD-RW drive. It is very rare that I need to read a CD on this machine, 
so I just left it disconnected when I put in the new ps.

The OS installation is SuSE 9.1.

I'm having two problems. One may have always been there. I am unable to 
open the CD-RW drawer unless the K3B program is running.

The second is that I am unable to point various CD tools at the 
recorder; they all want to look at the no-longer-connected CD-ROM drive.

In /dev I have:

lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 3 2004-10-06 11:16 cdrecorder -> hdd
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 3 2004-09-27 17:24 cdrom -> hdc

Would the simplest thing be to replace cdrom with a new link also 
pointing to hdd, or is there something more fundamental that I'm missing?

They probably pulled it from the http headers.

It depends.  If you're like my friend that moved to Nevada 5 years ago, who

if you've joined us in the third millennium already and have a gig or two of 
RAM, you're far less likely to encounter any problems.  ursine.ca has about 
30 shell users, 400+ Jabber users, and 6000+ jabber transport users (mostly 
Google users thanks to BigBlueBall's guide to setting up the obsolete IM 
networks to work over Jabber[1]), and I regularly run KDE with a whole lot of 
stuff open, then get bored and play UT2004 without closing anything first.  

free -m reports 2536 MB of RAM installed, I went two weeks without noticing 
that I (or one of the roommates with root) did a swapoff for some reason and 
never did a swapon until I noticed it two weeks later.

Eventually I'm going to have enough parts left over from upgrades that I can 
Frankenputer a server together and make this machine exclusively a desktop, 
but for now it serves as a great conversation piece with the Borg friends:  
"You're doing *how much* with one single system?  And you still pull *how

I have it properly configured on my domain, however, I do see your messages.  
I suspect his SPF configuration may be broken in some obscure manner, since

Note: enabling the TXT record with sfp= in your DNS records is 
completely different from actually telling your mail server to CHECK 
these records (and drop email that doesn't comply).

Yup, it did that for me in the Debian installer...mediawiki's expected the DB 
to already exist, so I had to create a db first and it was able to pick up 
from there.

In Mediawiki's LocalSettings.php

$wgUseRCPatrol = true; # use "patrolled edits"
$wgSpamRegex = "/overflow\s*:\s*auto/"; # customize this
$wgWhitelistEdit = true;   # true = user must login to edit.

and moderate manual blocking goes a long way.

As others have noted, in this case it was just some javascript,
however there are a number of other ways to get your PC's time-- the
simplest is the TCP timestamp option which is enabled by default on
all modern distros of Linux that I've seen:

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1323.txt

Another option would be the ICMP timestamp:

http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/protocol/icmp/msg13.htm

This is seldom used, but enabled by default on at least Red Hat
variants-- I can't remember if it's enabled on others.

I recall reading an article about "fingerprinting" PCs based on the
delay patterns between packets to reveal the PC's inherent clock
drift, but I can't find the URL.  However, I know of no current
vulnerabilities that could be exploited using your PC time.  I
generally don't worry too much about the fact that it's trivial to
deduce my current PC time.

Also, the problem with the air conditioner noise is actually resolvable. 
It is a beer cooler that can be turned off during the meeting.

Also, the room we are using has a built-in PA system that we can use as

You waited until the day *after* the third Monday to announce
third-Monday meetings.
Did you not have a speaker ready?

Those two together tell the story. The immediate problem is some number
of pages of kernel memory have been corrupted. At a minimum you'll need
to restart the system, and forcing disk checks would be a good idea. The
next question is what is the origin?

This could be memory that is marginal. If this machine stays on
continuously, eventually even /slightly/ marginal memory will bite you.
This could be a processor that is a little too warm. This could be a
dying disk drive (doubt it, they tend to be more spectacular).

memtest is the conventional target for #1. #2 you look at lm-sensors. #3
you look at what smartctl (smartmontools) tells you.

Not much, the above already strongly pointed to corrupt kernel memory
and filesystem damage is a common result of that.

There are several ways, but the handiest in this sort of situation is
`touch /forcefsck`, and reboot. If you look at the init scripts, there
are a number of little control functions managed by the presence/absence
of files in /. I imagine you can guess what the presence of a file named
"forcefsck" on root does (size of course doesn't matter, so typically
touch is used to make zero-sized ones).

Thanks you all for the answers.
May be somebody can advise me how to retrieve client 
browser or PC timestamp on the server side without
using java or javascript. 

Thanks,

Subject: [PLUG] Ubuntu Dapper Drake Officially Delayed
Message-ID: <32c2f9130603211608r1a7a215ep38db75df91190fcc@mail.gmail.com>

Strait from Mark's mouth, Dapper Drake has been delayed until June 1st.

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2006-March/000058.html
-----------------

Hi,

June 1st 2006 is the updated release date for Ubuntu Dapper, Desktop
and Server editions, a delay of 6 weeks over the previous release date
of April 20.

The Ubuntu Community Council and Technical Board discussed feedback on
the delay proposal received during two town hall meetings on the
#ubuntu-meeting public IRC channel. After conferring with an absent
colleague they have now unanimously approved the new release schedule,
published here:

  * https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseSchedule

The additional time will be used to:

  * devote an additional three weeks of bug-fix-only quality assurance
    time to the release for the core development team

  * integrate the work of the localisation sprint to ensure excellent
    out-of-the-box support for Asian languages as well as other
    languages for which we are receiving a stream of community
    contributions

  * devote additional developer time to UI polish that we believe will
    make Dapper stand out as a high-quality desktop operating system
    for large-scale deployment

  * bring the XFCE desktop environment, which has received substantial
    community-driven work during this cycle, into the main Ubuntu
    repository to improve the usefulness of Ubuntu on lightweight
    desktops

  * ensure that Dapper will be LSB certified at the time of release

  * provide for wider testing of the new Ubuntu server kernels and
    server features

  * ensure that the new graphical Live CD installer receives very
    widespread testing

This is not a general relaxation of the freeze process. While there
are some new features that are being integrated, the general
stabilisation and bug fixing freeze remains in place, with some
specific exceptions.

Progress towards the set of goals identified for Dapper has been truly
excellent, with almost all feature goals already implemented or
available for wide testing 5 weeks ahead of our previous release
date. The current status of all 82 new Dapper features (not counting
new upstream features in this cycle) is listed here:

  * https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/dapper/+specs

The extra time will help ensure that Dapper is a robust and reliable
platform for organisations with long-term and large-scale free
software deployments.  This is the first release of Ubuntu that will
be supported for 5 years on the server and 3 years on the desktop, and
we believe that this release will help expand the reach of the Ubuntu
and Debian communities substantially.

While the release schedule of Dapper+1 is not finalised, the Technical
Board feels that it will be best to plan for a short release schedule
to return to our regular Gnome + 1 month cycle. This will likely
result in Dapper+1 being released in October 2006.

Thank you to all who participated in the discussion or sent in their
commentary directly to the Technical Board, Community Council and
SABDFL.

I think what you are asking for is NTP but I'm not sure, NTP stands for
Network Time Protocol. It's a dedicated protocol for clock syncing. beyond
that I haven't looked too much in to it I know I use it but I don't know the
nitty gritty details of how it works or how to configure it in linux. I do
know my linux box sets it's time via NTP every time it starts up, and I know
you can cron-job it somehow to update the clock at regular intervals to keep
it on time. but the how to do it escapes me. perhaps someone else on the
list can help us.

While I simply love the idea of XFCE coming to a distribution which has 
such a good reputation for ease of use and sanity as Ubuntu, I must 
wonder about gnome these days... as KDE can be easily paired down to be 
about as quick-and-nimble as Xfce.

I love Xfce, BTW.  :-)

I'm not talking about NTP but plain browser and a server interaction.
I'm asking about any mechanism which can be used on the server side to 
retrieve timestamp from the client browser without using javascript.

Thanks,

Alex

galen,

   I'll give this a try. The filesystems are reiserfs. Any recommendations for
flags? According to the man page, -A will check them all, starting with /.

Thanks,

Sorry, I'm not an expert on this.  I'd read the man page and look at your
startup scripts to see what they normally do.

As someone else mentioned, you should also run memtest86 to help rule out
memory issues.

Xfce is good, however gnome for a new user is where it's at, KDE is bloated,
and without serious modification is a real PITA IMO. KDE lite is nice but
it's a grass roots effort and doesn't have the support that Gnome has. XFCE
is very light which I love, but kind of a horse to figure out at times. I'll
stick with Gnome for now and hope the linux desktop improves substantially
over the next 2 years.

umm...I don't think there is without some type of client side script to send
the data back to the server. AJAX might do it. what is wrong with
javascript? what exactly are you trying to do? I'll read through the
conversation real quick to see if I missed somthing, but I'm not sure as to
the question I think.

This is "envelope from" we're talking about, not "header from".

If I send to PLUG at lists.pdxlinux.org, it should look like:

        From plug at lists.pdxlinux.org (date)
        From: merlyn at stonehenge.com
        To: plug at lists.pdxlinux.org
        Date: (original date)

etc etc

Or, in SMTP terms:

        MAIL FROM: plug at lists.pdxlinux.org
        RCPT TO: (each user)
        DATA
        From: merlyn at stonehenge.com
        To: plug at lists.pdxlinux.org

etc etc.

If the mailing list software at pdxlinux.org is not doing the right thing,
then it needs to be fixed *or* it needs to not publish hard-fail SPF records.

If the recipient is hard-failing based on "From:", shame on him.  SPF is only
supposed to check envelope-from, not header-from.

Sounds like you came from Windows.  :-)

Windows users think something is easier when often it is not.  They 
think something is difficult often because it isn't Windows-ish. 
Remember trying to learn Windows?  Bet it was a lot more complicated 
than trying to learn a "Linux" desktop such as Xfce.

I've found Xfce to be customizable enough to work quite well for me.  My 
computer using habits are such that X holds maybe six or seven graphical 
applications and twenty or more terminals (and I really need to find a 
nicer terminal...), so I map keys to launch these six or seven graphical 
applications and run all the oddball stuff from the Run dialog (which is 
also mapped to a hotkey) or a terminal (ditto).  I don't use a task bar 
(it wastes space) and have the panel set to auto-hide with a nice 
graphical pager on it (which acts very taskbar-esque for me)... with 
about ten desktops going most of the time.

So I pretty much go insane using Windows, and have found gnome to not be 
as quick-and-easy to get going as Xfce (this particular install took me 
about ten minutes to get in to shape)... and it's oh so bloated.

I wonder if people examined their computer usage habits if they'd find 
they really pretty much never need to use that whole start menu thing 
Microsoft "came up with" and KDE/gnome "copied" except as a reference 
when they just can't remember what that program was called...

The only difference is you'd have to take a little bit of time and learn 
how to effectively use your computer instead of assuming the way Bill 
Gates told you how to use it was how you should use it....

</rant>

As an aside - has anybody ever noticed people pretty much never maximize 
windows unless they're using Windows?  Windows users ALWAYS have the 
window they're in maximized... but others pretty much NEVER have the 
window they're in maximized.  I've found myself doing this - at work I 
generally have whatever I'm working in maximized while at home (in 
Linux) I like to have things laid out in such a way that I can see 
what's going on elsewhere.....

"AJAX" uses javascript, that's what the "J" stands for..

By timestamp I assume you mean what time the client's clock is set to,
even if wrong.  Unless the client sends a date/timestamp header with a
request (and it doesn't appear to be in the HTTP spec so it seems likely
they won't) you might be out of luck.

A highly inaccurate method would be going a geo lookup on their ip
address and mapping that to a time zone, from that you could get their
actual time.. but those ip->geographic location things aren't exactly
foolproof.  And it wouldn't account for what time their computer was
actually set to if it was wrong or they were in Miami on their laptop
set to a Portland time.  Or you could ask the user to type it in and hit
 submit.

If you read the source of the page, it's very simple javascript.
Your browser knows things like your timezone and current time,
so javascript is able to report it to whatever site that requests
it.

I almost never maximize Windows windows (or any other windows).  The
exception is when I am working in a low-resolution environment.  I
prefer the Mac philosophy of "maximizing" the window to fit whatever
is in the window, not necessarily to the size of the screen.

Just wondering if you could place a cookie on the client and get a time

Subject: [PLUG] Loading a NetPC
Message-ID: <e3b7bac0603212035t996ae0ev4fd9a94738b79a4f@mail.gmail.com>

Hey All,

I have an old NetPC that I would like to reload with a debian-based
version of Linux.  (It is running Slackware 9 ATM.)  It has a parallel
port, 2 USB ports, and a floppy disk port.  (The bios only support
booting from the hard drive, the floppy, or the network.)  To load it
with Slackware, I connected a floppy drive from another computer while
leaving its power cord in that other machine.  This is a pain, and I
would like to find a simpler solution this time.  (Why bother at all? 
The NetPC is *really* quite and small.)

I was hoping I could use a 1.44 MB floppy drive and a power supply
that I had in my stash of spare parts; however, after connecting them
up and plugging in the power source, the drive doesn't start -- needs
a switch or something to turn the power on I think.

I suppose I could set up DHCP and TFTP servers on my desktop, but I
wanted to ask if anyone has any other suggestions before I start down
that road.

TIA.

Travis Spencer

I'm kinda curious as to why you use a DE at all, given the way you
describe how you like your set-up.  What's the advantage of using Xfce
over something simpler like Openbox?:

--no default toolbars/taskbars/panels that you'd need to hide or disable
--everything keymappable, including a highly configurable menu that can
be as comprehensive or skimpy as you want
--as many desktops as you want
--configurable window auto-arranging policy and configurable window
manipulation from the keyboard (nudging windows, auto resizing to fill
open space vertically or horizontally, moving windows to different
desktops, etc.)

And beyond Openbox and similar, there are the tiled WMs like wmii and
ion3, which you might find even more to your liking.  I think wmii is
pretty cool, except I couldn't really get with the "plan 9" aspect of
it, which seems to me to add unnecessary complexity.  And as for ion3 --
well, I don't want to have to learn a scripting language just to control
my desktop.  PekWM might be better than either of these, if development
continues.

Well, okay, it's a rant, and rants aren't *supposed* to be, um, fair ...
but c'mon.  Microsoft spent millions on usability studies to come up
with what they did.  Anyone can argue that they still didn't do a good
job, but it's hardly reasonable to attribute Windows's layout to the
whims of Bill Gates.  Sun and Ximian and other Gnome backers similarly
have invested enormous effort in researching and establishing HIG, and I
doubt that KDE simply copied Windows.  And that's to say nothing of all
the work Apple has done in these areas, which has had an impact on the
design of all these environments.  I would say that Gnome is at least as
influenced by OS X as Windows, and Xfce owes something to it as well.
None of this is to suggest that they must all be right just because they
spent a lot of money, but you're being awfully dismissive of the work
that's been done just because they don't happen to be right for you.

Not really, but there might be something to that.  I think people tend
to like maximized windows or not, regardless of what environment they're
in.  One of the basic ideas behind tiled WMs (which are about as far
away from the MS/Apple paradigms as you can get) is that there is no
point in *not* having windows maximized.  After all, what is the space
that's not being occupied by a window doing for you?  Why not take full
advantage of the space available to you by filling it with actual work
space?  A WM like Openbox takes a kind of "middle road" in that it does
not, by default, fill your workspace like a tiled WM, but it makes it
easy for you to do that when it's appropriate.  It takes a little more
work in Openbox if you, say, have two xterms filling the screen and want
to add a third, than it does in wmii, which will auto-arrange the
addition of a third (or fourth, or fifth...) xterm.  But it can be done
in Openbox with a couple of keystrokes.

There is certainly an unstated element of "I like [insert DE/WM here]
best because it's what I'm used to" in people's assessments of all these
environments, but that's to be expected.  When I started using OS X, one
of the things that drove me crazy at first was the single-desktop
paradigm.  I had used multiple desktops in both Windows and Linux for a
long time, and I thought not having this feature available was a real
limitation.  But after getting with OS X, I realized that it provides
multi-desktop functionality without the multi-desktop paradigm.  The
ways you can move, arrange, control and switch between windows in OS X
is no less featureful than the ways you can do those things in
Gnome/KDE/Windows XP or other environments with multiple desktops, it
just provides a different conceptutalization of window management.  And
yet, some people still use third-party tools to provide multiple
desktops in OS X -- probably only because that's what they've been used
to coming from other environments.  It's silly, but it's human nature.

Cookies are basically name-value pairs that can expire at a certain
time.  You might be able to iteratively set the cookie to expire
sometime in the past+0 seconds, then past+1, past+2, etc. checking to
see if the client sends the cookie value back to the server each time,
the first time it sends one back would be client computer's time I
think.  That sounds pretty kludgey.. but it might be a fun hack.  Would
obviously require cookies be turned on the client.

Great!  That should last us until football season, by which time we
can have other arrangements made.

Even better.

I will bring the wireless mike, which we can plug into the room PA,
and I will leave the suitcase PA in the car.  

Also, I noticed a projector platform hanging from the ceiling.  If we
can build some sort of anchor arrangement, so the weight of the cable
does not pull my tiny little projector off it, then we can put the
projector up there, and free up the front of the room.

If I get to Jax early before the meeting next month (like 5:30), and
somebody else shows up to adjust sound levels, or make runs to Radio
Shack to buy cables and adapters and gaffers tape if necessary, we
can have quite a nifty setup.

And since I will be speaking at the April A.T.,  I can be the focus
of blame for both a bad presentation AND a bad setup.  That should
cut the rotten tomato expenses by half!

Kudos to Alan for following through on this!

I assume you mean to say that manual blocking is a big task on the
wikipedia?  Would the plug wiki really have the same level of abuse that
the wikipedia has?

My first couple experience weren't entirely pleasing.
However, recent experience has changed my earlier opinion,
and I have even start putting up some wikis of my own.

I think PLUG could benefit from a wiki.

No, but I do have a mediawiki.  Tuning $wgSpamRegex will take care of most of

In my experience they do.

I like the new arrangements for the meeting - all except for 3rd Monday.
It conflicts with the Rose City Astronomers meeting.

Well, honestly, I don't *use* a DE so much as have it running in the 
background for the heck of it.  I really only am using the basic window

I used OB3 from about a week after it was released until perhaps a year 
ago when I discovered Xfce4.  Before that I used an incredibly stripped 
down KDE.  Before that it was Englightenment.  Before that it was 
Fluxbox.  Before that it was Blackbox.  And before that... it was 
hmmm... what was it before that?

I've found Xfce4 to be *faster* than all of the above.  Smoother.  OB3 
started taking too long to switch desktops when I had ten desktops each 
with ten or more windows on it.  It would literally take a second or two 
for me to flip to a new desktop.  KDE was just getting ugly as stripped 
down as it was.  In Fluxbox, scrolling text in terminals ate CPU time 
like there was no tomorrow... and it was relatively buggy.  Blackbox 
didn't have a good pager available for it.  Enlightenment was full of 
bloated eye candy and ate up RAM like there was no tomorrow.

Things I need but don't regularly see in window managers or desktop 
environments are pagers that not only show me there are windows on other 
desktops, but *WHAT THE HECK THOSE WINDOWS ARE!* and smoothness in 
flipping desktops or other standard things when I have a bunch of 
windows open.  The keybinding issue can be solved in any window manager, 
although it feels easier in Xfce4 than it did in most of the others.

My windows overlap.  All the time.  How else can you fit ten consoles 
into a 1024x768 screen with an IM window and web browser open, too?

*Was* there really a lot of money spent on interface research for 
Windows 95?  I would be surprised if there was.  And I would wager any 
future research done by MS was tainted by the task bar/start button 
ideas they were so intent on keeping.

FWIW, I like the way Apple does things with OS X... I think they *did* 
do their research and came up with some ideas that were different from 
Microsoft's.  I still like my customized Xfce environment better... but 
OS X is definitely something I could live with instead.

How long have you been using Linux, though?  And do you use it to get 
work done or just to play?

I found when I first started using Linux, probably with KDE or GNOME, I 
only used it to play around a little bit and always maximized things as 
I did in Windows.

However, after I started using it full time and to actually get work 
done, I found I needed a lot of windows open for various tasks and 
simply couldn't see a reason to maximize a window and hide everything 
else behind the blank araes of the windows.

How is that different for someone who uses Linux to "actually get work
done" versus someone who uses Windows to "actually get work done"?  If
your work demands lots of open windows, then you probably won't
maximize, irrespective of which OS you're using.

Of course, you can feel free to insert your favorite "getting work
done on Windoze" joke here.

I think that people "work" and "play" in different ways and just because
somebody likes to maximize their windows doesn't have anything to do
with whether they're "working" or "playing"

I actually use Xfce (Not because I'm working on it as a project and have met the large part of the developers) but because it balances the ability to work fullscreen (or maximized - those are two different things) and in windowed mode. On top of that it offers all the features you (I) basically need and remove the fluff, is fast and generally rather pretty. Keybindings, etc... it's all there!

If you want to start desktop warfare then obviously you can for any desktop. Working with the team I can say however that Xfce is taking things very seriously such as portability (freebsd, opensolaris, cygwin!) very seriously and keeping things minimal when this is applicable. This appeals and proves to be a good foundation of what is rapidly becoming a more popular desktop. The project manages to produce a high amount of translations and enough buzz that it's out of the "written by one hacker" age for a long time now - and future plans prove promising.

I do some distro management as well and often recompile packages - Xfce takes me maybe 2 hours to install from an empty box - including X. KDE and GNOME take me a whole day - and that's just not worth it. Things like openbox and ion, etc remind me of twm - sure they are "the only wm" but I'm just not that l33t enough!

and it works for me =^)

In response to popular demand, here it is. I'm going to copy over what I 
shared on WikiEN-L (from
http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-February/038997.html ). 
Dave Mandel was also part of the conversation, so he can verify/correct 
my account.


Last weekend I took part in the RecentChangesCamp that was held here
in Portland, where I had the oportunity to talk to Ward Cunningham &
heard from him his experience with his own pioneering Wiki at
www.c2.com. (He may have discussed it at Wikimania last summer, but the
first time I heard about the following was last weekend.)

One thing he had done -- much as Jimbo did a few years ago with Wikipedia --
was to identify a number of contributors (either 14 in number, or a total
of folks whose average time dedicated to Wikiwiki totalled an FTE of 14, I'm
a little hazy here) who showed sufficient knowledge of how the Wiki & the
community worked, & made them his assistants to help him deal with spam,
vandalism, & other malicious behavior towards the Wiki. This allowed him
to step back & devote more time to other things, & because he wasn't as
closely involved in the day-to-day activities of the wiki on c2.com he
was spreading the word of the success of the Wiki way, how the community
was successfully managing itself & dealing with its problems. And he
honestly believed this.

He had this utopian belief corrected after a couple of years when the Wiki
was rocked by a severe flamewar over a "trivial matter" that had gone as
far as the opposing sides each creating bots to revert the edits of the
other side. (For the record, the controversy was over whether to keep or
delete a node that was a parody of the movie "Fight Club", called
"BoogerClub".) As he spent time not only to get to the bottom of the
matter, but also to bring himself up to date with the Wiki & the community,
he discovered that the struggle to keep the Wiki usable & in order had
burned out his assistants in their long, hard & unappreciated efforts.

Ward said he was able to help his assistants by adding a simple bit of
code which prevented bots from functioning on his Wiki -- which stopped
the spamming immediately & brought a cease-fire to the major flamewar,
but the damage had been done. People left, & WikiWiki "plateaued" in
growth, losing something of its original excitement & attraction.

I've held off on sharing this story with this mailling list because I
feel that in telling it, it should have a moral or a lesson -- but I'm
not smart enough to point to it. Except to belabor the obvious point
that Wiki communities aren't as self-regulating as people think they are.

I admit that my original post was nothing more than a bit of savage 
humor about vandals, & probably was a waste of time both to post & 
read. However, it has uncovered a surprising blind spot shared by many 
people, who apparently forgot that a Wiki has the same security issues 
that any server on a network will have: the certain percentage of users 
who are bad guys. They will always attempt to copromise its security 
either for their entertainment (e.g. vandalism) or personal gain. 
Wiki software doesn't magically transform these jerks & criminals into 
a bunch of mature, peace-loving & mellow types whom you could trust 
with your girlfriend if you had to leave the country for a few years.

Yes, if your Wiki has a small enough audience the vagarities of sampling 
may mean you won't encounter any determined vandals or bad guys. And yes, 
you can change the code in any Wiki to make it harder for them to 
compromise the machine.

However, SECURITY IS NOT A "MODERATE" ACTIVITY!

Someone has to constantly study the changes in a Wiki -- just as a 
good SysAdmin always studies the server logs to look for problems. 
Further, the more users a Wiki has the more eyeballs the Wiki needs 
to look for problems -- & if human nature holds true, 20% of the 
eyeballs will be doing 80% of the vandal-fighting. And if you have 
a Wiki, you have to monitor things on two levels -- on the 
software level, & on the content level. And there will always be 
someone who come along & wait until it is the dead of night in the 
admin's timezone & either replace all of the content with gibberish 
or try out the latest scripted exploit.

I'm not saying that a Wiki on our webpage will have the same amount 
of problems that Wikipedia has: Wikipedia has a *much* bigger audience 
than I can ever imagine pdxlinux.org will ever have. And having a 
Wiki on our website might not only solve some problems, but also be 
fun. But to state that the manual labor needed to fight vandals on 
a successful Wiki as "moderate" is just plain stupid. Unless you 
consider doing the equivalent work of two SysAdmins (again, one on 
the server level & another on the content level) as "moderate".

I have a couple of strain relief gizmos that I've been carrying around 
in my tool box since the early 1970's. One of them might be suitable for 
your purposes. I'll try to describe them:

This device is made of aluminum. I believe it was intended for aluminum 
utility cable, as they came from my dad who worked for Cincinnati Gas & 
Electric. One end has a loop of ~1/8" AL wire about 1-1/4" across at the 
large end, tapering to about 3/4" at the small end, where it is attached 
to the part that would hold your cable. This loop can be removed from 
the other end via a keyhole arrangement.

The other end is formed so that there is a tapered piece with about a 
1/4" groove along the top. A larger piece is U shaped with curled edges 
so that it slides over the other piece and locks any cable set into the 
groove.

In use, one would open the loop, place it around some part of the 
projector platform and close it, again -- something like a safety pin. 
Then, one would lay the video cable into the other end, leaving enough 
slack so that it did not interfere with the projector. Thus the weight 
of the bulk of the cable is transferred to the platform, or its support.

I would be happy to donate one of these to the cause. We'll just have to 
find a mutually convenient time and place for me to hand it over to you. 
At this time, I don't know if I'll be able to attend the meeting. 
Alternatively, if you know an electrician, you might be able to get one 
from him/her. I suspect something like this is still on the market.

I disagree with this statement. If it were to read:

then I could agree.  Any reader writable Internet accessible web page is subject

On the surface I wonder why you'd want to always maximize windows. What
is the point of a windowing UI, if you never have multiple windows
visible, why not use a simple framebuffer in that case? I wonder if
perhaps this is from MS-DOS, which had more or less that. It was possible
to do task-switching with MS-DOS, but only one was ever visible onscreen.
Perhaps that is why they're like that?

First off, thanks again to all who replied.  
After chasing down all the necessary rpms and srpms, I was able to install 
mplayer, but it didn't work correctly. (Behavior described below.)

I decided to break down and build the thing from scratch.  So I 
downloaded, built, and installed gcc-3.4.6.  That seems to be working 
fine.

I then took the MPlayer-1.0pre7try2 source I had lying around, and 
built it with gcc-3.4.6 & installed it.  So far no problems.

Testing the resulting mplayer, I get the *exact same error behavior* as I 
did with the mplayer binary installed from rpm -- which makes me think 
there's a more fundamental problem than just mplayer, but I'm not sure 
where to go looking for it.

Here's what mplayer does:

"Exiting..." line, the window goes away.

The test file is available at http://fredrik.hubbe.net/plugger/test.mpg.

So, I'm looking for ideas on where to start debugging - I suspect there's 
something buggered up in the underlying installed-from-rpm libraries, but 
I don't really know where to start looking.  I don't see anything 
obviously wrong in mplayer's diagnostic output, or in what gets reported 
with 'mplayer -v' set.

Well, yes ... presumably, those people for whom it's working don't need
to do anything. :-)

AFAICT, the modules are loaded at boot on Debian and Ubuntu.  IPv6 comes
up in dmesg, or did until I disabled it.  This is the case with kernel
versions 2.6.8 and 2.6.12.  What distros do not provide IPv6 support by
default?

I don't know about broken packets.  I checked out one those websites
that will report whether you're IPv6 ready under OS X, using both
Firefox and Camino.  Both times the site reported in the negative.  (I
didn't get the dancing frog, or whatever it was.)  I take that to mean
that my ISP doesn't support IPv6.  Is that wrong?  Yet ifconfig under OS
X reports that I have an IPv6 address.  Wouldn't that mean that the BSD
kernel is loading the IPv6 module by default, even if my network doesn't
support it?  The same thing happens under Debian and Ubuntu -- ifconfig
shows an IPv6 address.  But under OS X, I have no problems surfing;
under Linux, I do.  Wouldn't that seem to indicate that the problem is
with the Linux kernel, not with the ISP?

Sorry, I missed the previously mentioned bug report.  If it's fixed in
2.6.15, that's great.  I have not used such a recent kernel.  But it's
not fixed in 2.6.12.

Not really.  Might be that one or two of your CD programs are config'd
to use /dev/hdc instead of /dev/cdrom, but you'll be able to fix that.

this is not good - it looks like your codec to play mpeg files does not like plain X11 output. The codes that come with mplayer have quirks and some don't work with xv, some don't work with sdl etc.

You should investigate:

- using -vo xv or -vo sdl to play through a different library/output channel
- downloading and installing the codec pack that adds other codecs

ATX power supplies are like that.  As it is, it's a pretty hinky to use
two power supplies like that.  Grounding and all that.

Setting up DHCP and TFTP for netboot ain't that bad, and it's *very*
useful if you're a sysadmin.  Go for it.

Which desktop or window manager are you using? KDE has this built-in, 
right-click -> Configure Desktop. I don't know of any others, though they're 
probably lurking out there somewheres.

I just got caught by the IPV6 / Mozilla problem.  My wife's office
computer runs SUSE 10, and has automated updates configured.  
Sometime in the past week, it updated something(?).  Mozilla
would no longer do DNS, though it would still fetch webpages
given an IP address, much like the problems others have commented
on here.  Fortunately, the discussion on this list pointed me at
a solution.

The solution was to go into the file /etc/modprobe.conf, and
find the line reading:

  alias net-pf-10     ipv6

and add another line after it:

  alias net-pf-10     ipv6
  install ipv6        /bin/true

I rebooted the machine (remotely) and tried Mozilla (remotely,
using ssh+X through two VPN tunnels) and it worked.

--------

Note, what DIDN'T work was attempting to use SUSE's yast command
to fiddle with the network.  Not only did it not offer a way to
edit the information in /etc/modprobe.conf, or in any other way
turn off ipv6, it also hung the network on exit.  So my wife had
to make a special trip back to her office to reboot the machine.  

Yes, changing the network configuration from remote is like 
do-it-yourself brain surgery.  However, if one exits without making
changes, one would think yast would recognize that no changes were
made, and leave the cottin-pickin running processes alone.  Oh well...

---------

Another annoyance was that my virtual colo provider, which I VPN
tunnel through to connect to her office, was going through upheaval
last night while I was trying to do all this - the uptime to that
point was months, and most reboots before that took minutes.  The
bad news was that they were debugging for almost 8 hours, the good
news was that this was day shift in New Zealand so it did not affect
my US customers.   The bad news was that it did affect my customer
in Shanghai, the great news is that they used the fixup opportunity
to repair some of the other virtual machines I share a host with.
This resulted in an open proxy closed, some repaired postfixes,
and a much lower load average.  They proved the power of Xen, by 
moving running the virtual machines around between hosts.   They
proved a pitfall, when they moved my virtual machine back to an
incorrectly repaired host and it died.  Hopefully, next time the
mistakes will be new and different.

Use a script that calls xsetroot to do the work. I haven't googled, but
I'm sure there are a few out there already. I always thought the
sunclock program was the coolest 'active desktop'.

I've completed the basic assembly and everything works, even using the
same CentOS 3 install I had in place before.  (Don't try that with
Windows, the Intel-to-AMD switch won't work without a reinstall...)

The only real surprise was that the 2x2GB PC3200 I ordered plus 2x1GB
PC3200 DIMMs I borrowed from another system won't run in DDR400 mode--
only DDR333.  I gather this is a somewhat well-known problem when
running with 4 DIMMs, though I'd never heard of it before this build:

http://forums.amd.com/lofiversion/index.php/t61499.html
http://forums.amd.com/lofiversion/index.php/t60467.html
http://forums.amd.com/lofiversion/index.php/t68304.html

I prefer more RAM to faster RAM on this system so I'm going to leave
it alone.  A minor disappointment.

All I had to do with my existing CentOS 3 on its first boot was choose
"remove" or "configure" as appropriate on the kudzu screen when it
came up.  I then ran "redhat-config-xfree86" to choose the new X
server since my old video card used Nvidia's drivers.  The
kudzu-chosen LAN drivers worked fine at 100BaseT.

Admittedly, I'm running 32-bit code on the 64-bit chip, but I've read
that this is actually more stable.  There are also a lot more
precompiled binaries for 32-bit stuff than for 64-bit, and VMware (the
main application I'm running here) looks to be better supported on
32-bit platforms.

My only concern is VMware now coredumps a lot, which is bad since
that's all this box does.  However, I'm a revision behind on their
beta server so I'll upgrade and see how it goes.  I'm a bit puzzled
why everything else would work great yet have one application choke...

I may also try a reinstall of CentOS 3 and see if that stabilizes
VMware at all.  Perhaps the lingering NVidia drivers are causing a
problem.

I've been using Linux on and off for a few years, I get in to it for a
while, then drop out, don't touch it and have to start over again ;). I'm a
windows boy, you give me a windows box, I can get it running smooth as silk.
I work in full screen most of the time due to the fact that my #1 program is
my web browser, and not having it full screen can warp web pages out of
whack, I like to look at the web the "way it was meant to be seen."

As I get more in depth with Linux I will probably adapt my usage to a style
that best fits the OS and WM's One thing that I am doing is getting myself
acquainted with the Gnome Desktop Environment (Lets call it GDE shall we?)
so that I can support the less tech savvy employee's that I'm setting up
these systems for.

Subject: [PLUG] Spanish technical translator for Linux project needed
Message-ID: <4420DF78.2010406@vcolo.com>

Last August a friend any I flew down to a small town in Bolivia to 
install a computer lab.  This friend grew up in the town, and wanted to 
give back in a meaningful way.  The computers have become so popular 
that the schools are wanting to make the class a graduation requirement.

http://www.omegacs.net/gallery/Padilla/Trip-Slideshow

The problem is that we are trying to expand the project, and 
communication is becoming a significant burden.  Our local partner, who 
helped bootstrap the project and is the regular teacher for these 
classes, only speaks Spanish.  I only speak English.  The best choice 
for translator was another member of the consulting group he worked for 
in Sucre, where he lives on weekends.

However, we finally made contact (email addr added to mailing list) with 
this guy yesterday, only to learn today that our partner split with the 
company today on disagreement about revenue from working on our project. 
  Helpful.

At the same time I am going to be writing a comprehensive proposal for 
the expansion of the project, instead of our local partner trying to 
assemble a system for which has has no experience.  In addition, this 
document has to redirect the Major (who requested it) from creating a 
wireless network in town, to *FIRST* getting an Internet connection...

Anyway, long story short: I need to find someone who's fluent in 
*technical* Spanish and willing to translate not only this larger 
document, but periodic email exchanges with our partner in Bolivia. 
Communication along these lines has been exceedingly poor from the 
beginning, but these issues are starting to become critical.

If anyone on this list can help directly, or can point me to someone 
else, or another list to ask, I'd much appreciate it.  I'm not on the 
list, so please email me directly.

TIA,

   I've two SCSI devices on my system: the tape drive and the cd-rw drive. I'd
like to assign the latter to /dev/cdrw to distinguish is from /dev/cdrom, but
I don't know how to identify on which /dev/sd? it is associated. Looking
through /proc/scsi/ I see only numbers and I've no idea what they represent.

tape drives are named /dev/st* and thus you cannot confuse them with drives that way. you can also check /proc/partitions - it will only list valid block devices that are either a partition or a disc - but never tapes.

Untrue. Lots of programs need additional patches to support IPv6, anyone
wanting operational IPv6 tends to have a number of things to fix.

That would make sense as Debian and Ubuntu are closely related. Most
distributions though, you have to explicitly enable IPv6. I don't run
prebuilt kernels, but in Debian's installer I've noted that the IPv6
module was never loaded unless I told it to load it.

Mentioned in the refered bug reports. Apparently in vanilla 2.6.8 if the
kernel is unable to route an IPv6 packet (or perhaps when it has no IPv6
default route), it simply drops it, while everyone else will reject
(produce a no route to host ICMP response). The result is when it
attempts to connect via IPv6, you wait until the connection times out,
then retry over IPv4 (which works). With the correct behavior, it would
then immediately try IPv4 and you'd be fine.

Oops. The bug reports were on bugs.debian.org, and mentioned in a
previous by someone else.

I don't think that is a projector platform. I think those are aimed at
simply keeping the lights from shining on the screen. I imagine it could
easily support your projector, but there is a problem.

Ceiling mounts of projectors always invert the projector. The reason is
projector optics are designed for the image to be "above" the projector.
If the image is "below" the projector, the top of the image will be
compressed and bottom expanded; unless your projector has a *really*
generous keystone ("trapezoid") adjustment. Most likely your projector
doesn't have that, so unless you've got a way to invert your projector
the plan won't work. The projector will also need to be able to invert
the image, but that feature is almost universal.

It turns out the problem is the AMD processor.  I figured AMD or Intel
made little difference-- but I was wrong.

AMD64 processors do not keep themselves in time sync on multiprocessor
systems.  VMware was getting confused because it would send a SCSI
command to its virtual disk, then when it checked how long it took it
came up with a negative number and panicked.

The workaround is to tell each virtual machine to only run on a single
processor.  This nicely fixed the coredumps.

Description of the source of the problem (SCSI timings):

http://www.vmware.com/community/thread.jspa?threadID=7644

The official fixes:

http://www.vmware.com/support/kb/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=2041 (didn't work)
http://www.vmware.com/support/kb/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=2039 (did work)

Some other folks who suffered my same fate:

http://www.vmware.com/community/thread.jspa?threadID=20973
http://www.vmware.com/community/thread.jspa?threadID=19953

Fortunately, with this fix my new system is all working now!

If I had to do it over I'd probably get an Intel dual-core processor
on an Intel motherboard-- a bit pricier, but probably fewer surprises
in the long run.

Auke,

   Thank you. This I know. However, I'm looking for the device to which the
CD-RW drive is assigned.

   While I'd still like to learn how to identify this device's assignment to
/dev/sd?, the immediate need has gone away. I fixed the tape drive thrashing
and that was my major concern.

Thanks a lot for that script. Once I was able to make it work, it only

Wow.  Um, you'll excuse me if I find that pretty fishy?  
It's always easier for a software vendor to blame the hardware and issue
a workaround than to admit there's a bug in the code.

That'd make sense if VMWare had a race condition, a common software bug
exposed by SMP systems.

whoops!

depending on how your devices are setup they should be named sr* and sg* - again /proc/partitions might prove useful too here.

be able to play some of the newer wmv or mov files.  Again I would
manually install the codecs.  Don,t use an rpm.

I should stop by at Jax to look at it again, but it was flat, about
18 inches square, I did not see anything on it, and tellingly, it had
an extension cord and socket on it.  But then, I did not go up on a
ladder to look more closely.  Perhaps that is where they mount the
rotating mirror ball for dances.

The projector won't invert images.  I wonder if you can do that in X?

If I tilt the back end of my projector up high enough (which I am not
prepared to do at Jax, so I better build a platform with a slide
stop!) I have enough trapezoid correction to project from a 15 degree
angle above the top of the screen.  When I use the projector at home
(note to IRS - /always/ for business purposes!) I project downwards
from a tilted platform level with the top of the screen.  That is on
a little plywood platform, with an inverted mouse pad glued to the
top (old mousepads, with the slick surface peeled off, make dandy
slide-proof surfaces).  

So it ought to work.  However, I do need to check it for focus and
clarity at the large angle, and I need to build a secure high-tilt
platform for it, and I need to arrange for a ladder.  It is starting to
sound like too much work to set up;  it is easier to just move tables.  


But this brings up an entirely different approach to an advanced topics
projector;  lets talk Jax into buying and installing a projector.  There
are three advantages - I don't need to drag one in there (so I can take
the bus or use my bicycle), it saves setup effort, and it it makes them
invested in using that space for projector-centric activities - like us! 
Amongst our surly recluses, is there anyone with good sales skills that
can convince the owners of Jax that it would be a Real Good Idea for
them to invest in a projector?  The selling points:  it frees up table
space (more customers), and reduces setup time (more revenue time for
the room), and increases safety ( fewer cords on the floor, no climbing
ladders to set up the projector on the platform ).  Now if either Alan
or I tried to sell them on that, our abysmal sales skills would backfire,
get us kicked out of Jax and probably arrested for congenital assholery. 
But there must be one among us who can politely talk to adults ...

   Thanks to the gentle clue stick from here, I turned the sound wire around
(green at the workstation end, blue at the monitor/speakers end) and it
worked really well. Since the big hardware crash Wednesday morning, I've been
fixing pieces that broke when I created one working box out of the two I had
before. The last piece to fix is the sound.

   Same hard drive, drivers, etc. from before. I went to the ALSA Web site,
migrated to the Wiki and the Trouble Shooting page, and went through all the
steps. Still no sound.

   All drivers are in place. alsamixer is on non-zero for the master and PGM
channels for both root and users. xmms comes up, but no sound comes out of
the speakers and instead of seeing the little bars jumping up and down, I see
a wavy line near the bottom of that plot window. I'm stumped.

   The new motherboard is a MSI K7N2 Delta 2 with the nVidia chip set. The
sound in built on the board; the chip's seen in /proc/asound/cards, the
intel8x0 driver is loaded, and so on.

   Another clue would be very helpful here.

Thanks in advance,

Rich

Subject: [PLUG] Opening CD drive drawers
Message-ID: <44244471.1020908@comcast.net>

I suspect there's a philosophy issue involved that I missed somewhere 
along the line, but why doesn't the eject button work on my cd drive(s) 
most of the time? I say "most of the time" because it does work when I'm 
running K3B to burn a CD. If K3B can recognize the button, why isn't the 
button recognized at other times?

I found the "eject" entry on a (Konqueror) context menu and learned that 
this is the way to open the drawer in order to insert a CD. It seems 
somewhat artificial to have to use the mouse to open the drawer when the 
effect is the same (or could be) as pushing the button. I also learned 
that even though unmount is listed in the context menu, it's not 
available unless I'm logged in as root. The eject entry appears to take 
care of the mounting and unmounting housekeeping, so why not associate 
that with the button on the drive?

Have you tried using the command-line tools that ALSA provides? There
should be some sort of "alsa-utils" package available for your
distribution. I try to avoid fancy apps like XMMS when I'm
troubleshooting audio issues. Something like:

  aplay /path/to/my/favorite/sound.wav

is a quick way to determine if it's an application issue or something
a bit deeper.

   As root, edit /etc/fstab so your entry is equivalent to this:

/dev/cdrom       /mnt/cdrom       iso9660     noauto,users,ro,unhide  0 0

This lets me, as a user, mount and umount the drive.

   If you press the button on the drive it just won't open? How strange! I
wonder if this is KDE's way of protecting you from yourself.

   Both my drives open at a push of their buttons whether I'm in X or at a
console.

Paul,

   Sigh. I found the problem after trying a couple of .wav files I didn't know
were on the system. Turns out that aumix had the volume and pgm set down to 0

The clock drift is a well known problem with the dual-core 64-bit AMD
processors.  The problem is that the TSC counter for each core are not
synchronized.  Power management causes one core to stop or run at a
lower clock speed.

It is a software problem in that the kernel or applications shouldn't
be using TSC for timekeeping since it has always been unreliable on
multiprocessor.  One SMP machines, the OS uses more stable time
sources.  My impression is that Intel SMP processors don't do as much
power management so the problem is less apparent.  My impression is
that the kernel didn't know about the dual-core processors and wasn't
selecting better time sources.  Some apps, like VMware, use the TSC
directly and will also have problems.

Have you tried using the command-line tools that ALSA provides? There
should be some sort of "alsa-utils" package available for your
distribution. I try to avoid fancy apps like XMMS when I'm
troubleshooting audio issues. Something like:

  aplay /path/to/my/favorite/sound.wav

is a quick way to determine if it's an application issue or something
a bit deeper.

Ah, thanks, that makes some sense.  I always get suspicious when someone
says, "Brand X is borken, Brand Y isn't."  Sounds like VMWare needs to
fix its code before Intel ships enough chips that the problem shows up
on their processors, too.

My son launched Amarok while Audacity was open.  Amarok launched its opening

use another player.

The next day, after a shutdown and reboot, Amarok still behaved the same.  Worry.

Moved .kde/share/apps/amarok/ to a safe place. Reinstalled Amarok.  Works OK.

Replaced the saved .kde/share/apps/amarok/  Amarok broken the same way.

I cannot find anything in the .kde/share/apps/amarok/ files which are dated 
yesterday, when we launched Amarok with Audacity open.  Maybe that had nothing 
to do with the problem.

Message-ID: <1143235371.9433.19.camel@localhost.localdomain>

It occurred to me that I would like to be able to connect my current
machine with my new machine, when it arrives.  So I guess I'll set up a
little network with a router, since it might be useful to be able to be
on-line with both machines simultaneously on occasion.  Routers, it
seems, are like hard drives in that no matter what manufacturer you
investigate, you find a lot of people who've had good and bad
experiences with any particular brand and model.[1]  One site suggested,
helpfully, that you should ask around for advice from colleagues and
neighbors.  So, I'm asking.

I need just a simple 4-port wired broadband router that won't balk at
the absence of Microsoft products in my home.  No need for printer
sharing or anything more complex than having both machines being able to
reach the net and each other, for moving files back and forth between
them.  Any suggestions about what to get, and in particular what to
avoid?

[1] Well, I guess you could say the same thing about ... oh,
everything. :-)

All I meant was that if you aren't having any IPv6 issues, then it's
nothing to worry about.  Honestly, stand in Pioneer Courthouse Sq. for
awhile and ask passersby whether they are excited, concerned, relieved,
or upset about the IPv6 transition.  I suspect most of them will give
you a blank stare or worse, and before long the police would stop by to
ask what you were doing.  Most people are blissfully unaware of IPv6.
*I* would be blissfully unaware of it, had it not caused me so much
trouble.  It's one of those things that a handful (relative to the
general population) of folk have to concern themselves with; for
everyone else, it's supposed to be seamless.

I don't know what you mean here.  At no time does either the Debian or
the Ubuntu installer ask me anything about IPv6.  If I knew how to
disable it at installation, I would.  The only way I know to address it
is to edit the appropriate lines in /etc/modules.d/aliases.  But that
happens after the installation, obviously.  Where do you tell Debian's
installer to load the IPv6 module?  How do you tell it not to?

By "everyone else," you mean the *BSDs, OS X, and Windows?

Michael,

   Why not use a 4-port switch? If you're moving bits around internally then
that's all you need. I assume that you already have access to the 'Net. If
you can do e-mail, ftp, http, and more from the one box, you'll be able to do
the same from the other box.

   In 1998-early 1999 we used a 56K modem to access the 'Net simultaneously
from two linux workstations. We'd each be fetching mail and loading web pages
with no problems.

Rich,

Actually. This depends a bit on how he is set up with his ISP. If he is
only allocated one IP address, then just plugging them both into a switch
will not do what you describe. He would need to set up one of the boxes to
do NAT, and have the other use it for a gateway. That would usually
involve having two NICs on the gateway box. That's all very doable of
course, but broadband routers are pretty inexpensive nowadays. It may not
be worth it to put in a switch and do all that extra work.

I use a DLink router on my home LAN, which comes with quite a few
features, including the ability to do static DHCP (where the DHCP server
always hands out the same IP to a given MAC address). I don't remember the
model number and I'm not there right now, but there are probably newer
ones now anyway. I think it cost about $50 at the time, and it's been very
reliable.

Um, because I didn't think of it?  :-)

I've never had a need for a home network before, so I haven't given it a
lot of thought.  I helped a tech-challenged friend set-up a home network
with a broadband router -- it's really the only thing I've any passing
familiarity with.  But I guess you're right, a switch would be just
fine.  Perhaps cheaper, too?  I'll search around.

Same question applies -- are there good switches and bad switches?  File
transfer speeds between machines are the same as with a router, yes?

it is all relative.  older routers only had a 10 mbs interface so your home
network connection would have been slower from host to host.  Most 4-8 port
switches these days are autosensing 10/100 and can be picked up for around
$50.  Used Linksys 4-ports and never had a problem.  Just because I have not
had any problems does not guarantee that the rest of the world is not having
problems with that switch.  If you want to throw in some management
capabilities  and access list capabilities for grins, pick up a Cisco 2900XL
on ebay for about $130+ and get a better backplane too!

I think most of the consumer ones out there come with Windows-based configuration software that lets you click through the wizard a couple of times and it configures everything for you. Since you won't be able to do that, you'll have to use the web interface on the router (unless you're lucky enough to find one with SSH.)

I don't want to say one router's better than another, because everyone has their own opinions. My personal preference is U.S. Robotics or Netgear, but I've successfully configured consumer-class routers in linux environments from Linksys, D-Link, and Hawking Technology as well.

I would however recommend avoiding Belkin. The web interfaces I've tried to use with them seem to be very IE-Bug dependant.

If you need help getting the network setup just let us know. Most routers will start handing out 192.168.x.y addresses as soon as you plug them in, and then you can grab DHCP, run 'ip route show' in a terminal, and type the IP listed for default gateway into your browser to get started. Here's an example:

--
aaron at zoomzoom ~ $ /sbin/ip route show
172.16.6.0/24 dev vmnet8  proto kernel  scope link  src 172.16.6.1 
10.6.0.0/24 dev eth0  scope link 
192.168.199.0/24 dev vmnet1  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.199.1 
127.0.0.0/8 dev lo  scope link 
default via 10.6.0.1 dev eth0 
--
So if I were running a consumer router to configure I'd type '10.6.0.1' into FIrefox and hopefully see a configuration page (or more likely a user/password prompt)

If you get a user/password prompt, the mfr. manual will probably list the default user/password. I know most of them, if you can't find it feel free to ask the list.

HTH,
Aaron

I would have to agree with Aaron about Belkin.  Those units also have a
nasty habit of overheating, creating fun fire hazards around the house.

Subject: [PLUG] FC5 Boot problem
Message-ID: <011a01c64f9e$6e31eab0$6d01a8c0@RAMA>

I have loaded FC5 into a free partition in my FC4 machine.
I find I have no way to boot the FC5 load in sda9.  

The machine was already a XP/FC4 multiboot machine.
During the install I told it not to install the boot loader.
What I ended up with is an FC5 install in the new partition, complete with
its own /boot directory.  
While there is a grub subdirectory, but it is empty except for the
splash.xpm.gz .

How do I boot sda9?

Booting into the existing FC4 on sda7, and fdisk -l gives:

Disk /dev/sda: 160.0 GB, 160041885696 bytes
240 heads, 63 sectors/track, 20673 cylinders

/dev/sda10          12437       18213    43674088+   b  W95 FAT32

I am also puzzled why sda9 continues to read as a W95 partition.
I can mount it with : mount /dev/sda9 /scr -t ext3

Most OSs (besides Windows) do not let you eject a CD that is currently
mounted.  This is to protect the OS from getting a mounted filesystem
ripped out from under it.  If you are using a burning utility, then
the CD is not mounted, because you are burning it, so the drive is not
locked.

You should eject your CD using the 'eject' command, or via the file
browser in Gnome/KDE.  Apple got this right by just not supplying an
eject button on their drives.

 Chris,

The general Innotech Registration will get you into see the Gov, Stuart
etc. Here's the response I got from the Innotech people:

Hi David,
http://www.eroi.com/servlet/com.gcm.servlet.event.EventRegisterForm?
commodityID=16459&command=cp&supplierID=496

Above is the direct link to the InnoTech registration page where
registrants enter the OTBC405 code.  This code only works for general
InnoTech
Registration.  So, if people try to use it for the CIO Summit, for
example,
it will not work.  We have not reached the 25 person cap yet.

Yes, general InnoTech registration includes the session with the
Governor,
Stuart Cohen and Dave Chen.
Andrea.

They're big on it in Asia, they've got a much smaller slice of the IPv4
space. I believe Europe also likes it, but they aren't quite as starved
for address spaces as Asia is.

There is a dialog for optional modules, you can select the IPv6 kernel
module there. If you do a blanket selection of the extra kernel modules
you might get the IPv6 one as well, and you know the results.

Removing the collection.db file causes rescan of the collection, and then it 
runs fine.  But all the html files get updated at the same time, so I do not 
know what file is the culprit (if it is only one file!)

Maybe this is to make up for not having had kids.

Here's what SuSE decided on when I set up the machine:

/dev/cdrom        /media/cdrom      subfs
     fs=cdfss,ro,procuid,nosuid,nodev,unhide,exec,iocharset=utf8 0 0

/dev/cdrecorder   /media/cdrecorder subfs
     fs=cdfss,ro,procuid,nosuid,nodev,exec,iocharset=utf8 0 0

There are enough differences between your simple entry and mine for me 
to want to understand before changing, just in case SuSE depends on 
something being setup this way.

I understand that on my machine, /media is just a place for the mount 
points, and is equivalent to /mnt. /media has just three entries, cdrom, 
cdrecorder, and floppy. I have a /mnt. It has one entry, flpy.

I know what iso9660 is, but not subfs. My man pages for fstab and 
mount(8) don't mention it. Neither do they mention cdfss, but I'm 
guessing that somehow subfs and fs=cdfss work out to iso9660.

I don't find anything in the man pages for fstab or mount(8) to explain 
procuid.

My man page for mount says that nosuid is defined thus:
      Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits to
      take effect. (This seems safe, but is in fact rather unsafe if you
      have suidperl(1) installed.)

I don't have a man page for suidperl, and "ps ax | grep suidperl" 
doesn't return anything, so I'm guessing I don't have it.

I understand the meaning of the rest: nodev,unhide,exec,iocharset=utf8
but I don't know if all of them are really necessary.

Hard to say. I thought K3B was one of KDE's utilities, and it recognizes 
the button.

>   Both my drives open at a push of their buttons whether I'm in X or at a

Interesting. I suppose one of those other settings may have some effect 
on it.

I'll try commenting out the existing settings and inserting ones like 
yours, but pointing at the /media directory instead of /mnt and see what 
happens.

But, that will probably happen sometime tomorrow.

Thanks for the ideas.

   You can add 'user' to the strings and that should let you mount/umount the
drives.

Message-ID: <4424A86D.2030108@freegeek.org>

Yo PLUGgers!

Richard from Free Geek here.

Our system admin volunteers have decided to host a key signing party,
tentatively set for the 5th Wednesday of each month. (Of course not all
months have 5 Wednesdays, but this one does.)

We have some assurers in the CACert.org system on staff and available.
(See http:cacert.org for details.) And we'd encourage people to sign
PGP/GPG keys as well.

So bring your fingerprints and a couple forms of IDs. If you're looking
for CACert.org points it'd be swell if you could print out an assurance
form, but we might be able to swing that here.

Here's the schedule:

March 29, 2006

* 6:00 pm -- regular tour of Free Geek

* 6:30 or 6:45 pm -- key signing party in our meeting room

* 7:15 pm -- Administrators of Systems and Security work meeting begins

* 9:30, 10:00 or whenever -- beer (if we feel like it)
  at some to be determined bar

It all goes down at Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Ave (2.5 blocks south of
Hawthorne).

All invited. See you there.

Why not get a linksys wrt54gl ($70.00) and then load something like hyperwrt or tarifa on it.  It will do most of the stuff those big routers will do.  My favorite feature is static dhcp in the tarifa firmware.

I'm assuming you have GRUB as the bootloader from FC4?  You'll want to
edit /etc/grub.conf and add an entry like:

title Fedora Core 5 (2.6.15-1.2054_FC5)
        root (hd0,8)
        kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-1.2054_FC5 ro root=/dev/rootvg/rootlv
        initrd /boot/initrd-2.6.15-1.2054_FC5.img

Assuming that your hda9 (which, in grub, is hd0,8--it indexes from zero)
is just one large filesystem.

It's just a few bits in the partition table; AFAIK the only thing that
actually cares are the MD and LVM layers, although it can be easier to
keep up with what you've got.

I had the dickens of a time last night installing FC5, mainly because I
didn't want to burn the ISOs to actual CDs.  Since the installer can use
a directory of the ISOs themselves (handling the loopback mounting
automatically), I thought I could just install from the filesystem where
I downloaded them.  Wrong: All of my filesystems except /boot are LVM
volumes, which is loaded from the stage 2 part of the installer.  Damn;
well, I though I could use my USB drive, sine I'd already copied them
there for transporting.  Still wrong: USB storage isn't probes until
stage 2.  In the end, I copied the ISOs to another host and installed
over NFS :\

BTW, you can avoid having to burn installation media just by booting the
install kernel and initrd from the first ISO with GRUB (I renamed my
files to be more descriptive):

title Fedora Core 5 Installer
        kernel /fc5-install-vmlinuz
        initrd /fc5-install-initrd

Of course, if I hadn't been so lazy, I could've just used my netboot
server...

Are you talking about installing a kernel?  I was talking about
installing the OS itself.  I thought the typical terminology in
Linux-land is "configure" a kernel, "install" an OS.  AFAIK, the Debian
and Ubuntu installers (installing the OS) do not provide a means of
configuring a kernel on installation (of the OS); therefore, there is no
option to load or not load IPv6 modules nor any other kernel modules.
The only distro I've seen that does is Gentoo, but I imagine there are
others.  If there is a way to reconfigure the kernel during a Debian
installation (of the OS), I've not come across it.  Do you get it when
you use the "expert" option?

What's the difference between an eject button on the drive and an eject
key on the keyboard, which Apple does supply?  I thought it was just an
aesthetic thing.  Apple's design philosophy seems to be to hide all
buttons (for example, the power on/off button) and connectors to keep
the machine's appearance as clean as possible.  But doesn't the eject
key provide the same functionality in the same manner as an eject
button, in terms of the way it interacts with the OS?

Most routers will start handing out 192.168.x.y addresses as soon as you plug them in, and then you can grab DHCP, run 'ip route show' in a terminal, and type the IP listed for default gateway into your browser to get started. Here's an example:

Thanks again, everyone, for the advice.  After looking around a bit, it
seems that these days home broadband routers are no more expensive than
switches and probably provide a bit more flexibility in the long run.
Newegg has a good-looking, well-regarded Netgear 4-port router for $41
and a not-quite-as-stylish but also well-reviewed D-Link for $32.  Seems
pretty hard to beat.  The basic Linksys router is almost $50 and has
given a lot of people problems, but that could be because Linksys is a
more popular brand.  More units sold = more people with issues.

I'll stop by the local Radio Shack tomorrow to take a look at their
stock, and buy one there or order from Newegg if RS doesn't have a good
selection.

The lack of documentation for, or even acknowledgment of the existence of, 
subfs in SuSE annoys me no end. (Along with lack of built-in mplayer 
support.)  subfs is a module for automounting filesystems, especially 
removable media and nfs exports.  There isn't a scrap of information about 
it on my SuSE systems, but there is some documentation about it at 
http://submount.sourceforge.net/ .

'cdfss' means that submount will try to use iso9660 and/or udf* 
filesystems to mount the device, whichever is appropriate.

"procuid" will mount non-unix filesystems with the uid and gid of the 
process accessing the mount (from the sourceforge link above).

It might be in /usr/bin/suidperl. It's part of the standard perl 
distribution, but it's not suid by default.  You have to aim to shoot 
yourself in the foot with this one, as far as I can tell.

   Based on my experience with the Netgear FVS318 (Firewall, VPN router,
Switch), don't buy that model.

Thanks - using '-vo x11' on the command line seems to work for most

Not sure what to recommend.  Are other sites loading OK?

Are they both using the same DNS servers? 

Can you browse to other sites?

The expert option makes it very visible, but you can get to it without
difficulty with the normal install. I'm unsure if there is another point
when you get easy access to somewhere to select the IPv6 module. If I
recall correctly, it pretty much simply adds it to /etc/modules though.

Port count is the only argument against your suggestion.

Yes, but the eject button on the keyboard signals to the OS that you
want to unmount and eject the CD, so the OS can handle it properly. 
The eject button directly on the drive tells the drive firmware that
you want the CD now, regardless of what the OS is currently doing.

Welcome to the Browser war.  I am not sure what is happening either,
but Something Changed recently, and it has affected many of us over
the past few weeks. 

In my case, the problem was on a recent 2.6 kernel in SUSE 10.0,
and seemed to be involved with DNS, Domain Name Service, the process
that converts internet (dot) names into numeric IP addresses.  I fixed
it by turning off IPV6 in the modprobe process, and I posted about
that a few days ago.  The problem suddenly appeared (for all sites,
not just Powells), a couple of weeks after moving the machine to a
new site, and it may have been due to the eventual change of DNS
cache info caused by the change of ISPs.

It may also be due to some kind of enemy action.  Perhaps there are
things the bad guys can do to DNS transactions that confuse the cache
and linger, causing the problems we have seen.  I don't know enough
about DNS to say.

What distribution and version of Linux, and Mozilla, and Konqueror
are you running?  I can't help directly, but if all of us with
problems report the relevant details, it may help those knowledgable
enough to fix the large scale problem.

In the short term, though, look at the postings regarding browsers 
over the past two weeks and see if they have relevant fixes. 
Warning, there is a bit of a technical argument going on that
doesn't have much to do with fixes; be patient and read past that.

I need to get an elderly lady set up with internet access.

I'd greatly appreciate any advice as to which ISP would be a good fit.

She lives in North Plains, if that helps.

I've set up a couple of senior folks with SpiritOne. Those folks have 
been happy with the service, and I've been happy that I've had no ISP 
problems to have to deal with. On those few occasions when I did need to 
talk with SpiritOne tech support (when I was setting up the systems), 
they were very helpful. And, they are local.

I don't know what the phone access issues are in North Plains -- is that 
outside the metro calling area?

my mom 80 yrs and going strong lives in a 'gated community'
i call it a prison compound, but thats me, any way her house
has ethernet all setup and wired in, gets around 2-4 Mbs.

She never had internet before that and had no idea that
was broadband and thought thats what everyone had.

   Bad feng shui. Did you try turning the system unit to face in a different
direction? I've found that burning a joss stick helps, too.

   I've been with Aracnet (now SpiritOne) since mid-1999. The service and
support has been excellent. They are one of many good ISPs here, but the only
one with whom I have direct, multi-year experience.

This would most likely be a dialup account.
I like your description of SpiritOne.
It sounds like the kind of outfit I'm looking for.
I'll have to find out if they have a number that would be local for her.

I've set up a couple of senior folks with SpiritOne. Those folks have 
been happy with the service, and I've been happy that I've had no ISP 
problems to have to deal with. On those few occasions when I did need to 
talk with SpiritOne tech support (when I was setting up the systems), 
they were very helpful. And, they are local.

I don't know what the phone access issues are in North Plains -- is that 
outside the metro calling area?

There is a low-level command that CD-burning software sends to the drive
that locks it closed. The drive will ignore the button and software
commands that request an eject until the command is sent to unlock the
door. 

Regular CD-ROM drivers can (and in the last few years, actually do) lock
the door when a CD is mounted, so you don't just blindly eject a mounted
filesystem.

I've been ignoring this thread, so I hope this isn't redundant.

Now that I understand that subfs is there to allow automounting and that 
right clicking on the device's icon brings up the eject option, I can 
let the system handle mounting and unmounting.

I understand the logic of not pulling a mounted filesystem. If K3B can 
control the button, then the OS should be able to control the button. 
Pushing the button should just be like a keypress. Maybe the button can 
only be told to be active or inactive, and won't return a keypress event 
without also opening the drawer.

Oh well. Now that I know where to find the appropriate icons I can open 
and close the drawer as needed.

Thanks to all who responded.

If SpiritOne doesn't work for some reason, you might also check out
Easystreet.  My mom in Hillsboro had them and they were excellent, even
with the "help, I'm an old lady and I don't understand this stuff"
calls.  (Considering how many I got being across the country, I can only
imagine how many they got being in the next town.)  Patient and
friendly.  She had no complaints about the service, not that she was a
heavy user.

I think they're based in Beaverton, but I could be wrong about that.

I'll second the Aracnet/SpiritOne recommendation -- they were great to me

   That's the Boy Scout's Order of the Arrow chant. The lack of proper feng
shui requires careful placement, orientation, and case color to ensure that
all Web pages load.

Chaz,

   Thank you. I pay by the year so if someone is a month-by-month customer of
theirs, they'd probably benefit more than I. That written, I did recommend a
couple of new customers to them several years ago and they credited my next
year's payment.

   Your call.

You know, I've noticed that too.  My site works significantly better if 
my router is facing East and there is nothing in front of it and the 
room lights are dim.  Also, performance increased with the change to 
yellow cat-5 cables.

I've been having the same problems that others are reporting. Just now I went to an eBay search that I have had bookmarked for ages. It always worked fine, but suddenly I am getting "We have made changes to the search function to serve you better. If your pages are displaying in text only, upgrade your browser." So I decided to display one of the listings and that gave me a big clue what was wrong -- it loaded the page pretty much all the way, but then I got a popup error message that it couldn't find cgi.ebay - something (I forget). I think that's where eBay's popup ads come from, so you KNOW eBay would never let that be down.

So instead of upgrading my browser (no effin' way, eBay), I did my link command to overwrite the resolv.conf file in chroot (where Firefox lives) with the one in the 64-bit world. Afterwards the eBay page loaded normally and no more popup error messages. Now, this computer has been connected at home for the past two days and not shut down. It gets to the internet over home ethernet to the hub, to the router, and to the cable modem. It was working fine yesterday, but today I had to reset resolv.conf. Yet I was on Powell's site yesterday looking for a book and it was working fine, at the same time it wasn't working for others. 

What is going on?

Comcast is plug-and-play, and fairly cheap if she already has cable TV.

I am not a kernel hacker, so when reading kernel code I've always been
a bit curious about struct list_head, the generic doubly linked list
in the kernel.  The mystery to me was always: how (expletive deleted)
do you get to the associated data!  I finally tracked down the answer
tonight.  The kernel source file include/linux/kernel.h contains a
macro, container_of() that magically returns a pointer to the
enclosing structure.  So, you plunk the list_head in your structure,
and then pointers to the embedded list_head are de-offset to the start
of the enclosing structure, and there you have your data.  

Clever.

I set up my 87 year old grandmother with SpiritOne and she is pleased with
them.

I've always known it as the Royal Order of Siam. I did learn it in Boy 
Scouts, but at that time and place it wasn't connected with the Order of 
the Arrow.

I have since inducted many people into the Order, and yet I'm still alive!

Russell> Clever.

And the wonderful thing is that with this being open source, you can *see* how
it works, and *how* it is used, in a large enterprise-ready system, and all of
us become better programmers for it.

One of the cool things about the original Unix Source licenses available to
universities was being able to study the V6 and V7 (One True Unix) kernels
line by line.  The V6 kernel was small enough that you could read it in a long
weekend from start to end, including the commentary from Lyons University.

Having good examples of large systems is a great way to see what works in
practice, not just theory.

Part of my wonderings are, no doubt, due to not keeping up on more
recent C standardization or even gcc extentions (as this was) for that
matter.  My primary C reference is still K&R and/or Harbison&Steele.
So, one question might be, what is a currently germane C reference?

Another topical question for me is: what are good tools for exploring
existing code?  Particularly in figuring out the overall structure of
a project.  I am thinking of a call tree (this function calls these
other functions) kind of thing.  Or other similar tools that are
useful, beyond, say, /usr/bin/less.  What do people find useful?

doxygen is widely used and creates a function reference with hyperlinks - sort of an automatic API creation tool specific to webpage output. It is widely used and works with c, perl php etc...

Yes. Kernel doesn't use K&R  nor ANSI C (which I cut my teeth on, too).  It
uses ISO C99 and some gcc extension (which really threw me, first time
digging through :-/ ).

Not familiar with any... Mostly just schlep through code until familiar :)

I've always thought LXR (Linux cross-reference) was pretty darned
handy.

<http://lxr.linux.no/>

The site has cross-referenced trees for several different kernel
versions, and you can download the tool source to apply locally.

ctags and vi/emacs, or if you're feeling more browserish, LXR
(http://lxr.linux.no/).

Source Insight is really nice, but it isn't open-source (or cheap).

Um... I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, but what is
this?  Why the rediculous pseudo authentication scheme?  Why do all
your URLs end in .exe?  And if you're trying to promote this project,
then why is it not available for download anywhere?

I'm thinking spam or phishing.

What I was imagining (perhaps fancifully) was just call structure, not
so much hyperlinked source.  Something that could potentially be fed
into graphviz or similar.

CTAGs or hyperlinked source is useful too, of course.

Does 'cflow' fit the bill? I've never used it myself, but it appears
useful. It generates a tree of function calls as a program executes.

Correction. It looks like it just analyzes source code, but doesn't
actually trace a running process:

  GNU cflow analyzes a collection of C source files and prints a
  graph, charting control flow within the program.

Years ago when I was an undergraduate CompSci major I managed to get a good 
chunk of the BSD source code o. I wanted Unix commands on my PC and actually 
spent some time porting some of the BSD text utility programs to DOS. It was 
pretty difficult as the DOS C compilers of the day were lacking in terms of 
common Unix system calls. It was still an intersting exercise and I learned 
quite a bit about the various system calls that BSD Unix had.

I think the p4 3.06 takes a socket 478.  I have a processor that was 
purchased on Ebay and given to me after they didn't build a box around 
it.  I don't know for sure if it's even a working unit.

I have recently abandoned KDE in favor of XFCE4. I haven't looked at
Gnome recently, but I do know that XFCE comes up so much faster than KDE
that I'm sorry I didn't switch long ago!

What sort of issues have you had "figuring out" XFCE?

I've also run into another, more severe problem with this
configuration-- also related to the unsynchronized timestamp counters
(TSCs) found on AMD multiprocessor systems.  My keyboard randomly
repeats characters under CentOS4, just as described here:

http://kerneltrap.org/node/6258

I've tried the various fixes, some don't apply (not using a USB
keyboard) and some didn't work ("clock=tsc" on kernel line).  I'll
keep investigating, but right now I'm not hopeful.

I'm continuing to use CentOS3 since it seems to work properly, but am
once again disappointed in my choice of AMD for my multiprocessor
system.  As someone who's used AMD processors wherever possible since
my 386-40 way back in The Day, this is extra disappointing.

Ed,

   But, you've finally come around, so welcome to the club.

>> Xfce is good, however gnome for a new user is where it's at,

   I've been using Xfce for 8+ years now; I started with fvwm2 back in 1997,
then discovered Xfce. The issue back then was that it looked too much like
CDE for those who grew to hate that on various flavors of UNIX. Since I had
no such baggage, I liked it from the first.

   Let me comment on the embedded quote first. I believe the assumption in
stating that "gnome for a new user is where it's at" comes from believing
that everyone who defenestrates wants a desktop that looks just like Winduhs,
'cause anything different is too difficult to understand. To this I say,
"feh!." I did not like fvwm2 because it looked too much like Winduhs. That's
also what I don't like about Gnome and KDE (in addition to their bloat).

> What sort of issues have you had "figuring out" XFCE?

   From what I've read on the Xfce mail list over the years, there are many
users who like to do everything with a GUI and ask for more and more
capabilities built into Xfce. Fortunately, Olivier and crew made it all
modular so those of us who don't want all the extra eye candy don't need to
use it.

   The duplicated feature that puzzled me (and some others) for a long time
was the addition of a task bar when everything was alread on the panel. I
still have no idea why, but apparently some users prefer the former.

   The setup has become better documented over the years, and the disappearing
panel in Xfce4 was the feature that caused me to upgrade from version 3. For
those who want to tune the appearance and function of the desktop, there's
the application-specific mail list and several of us here who use it and may
be able to answer questions.

   I've used Xfce on all my machines, including the Toshiba Libretto with 64M
RAM and the Toshiba Portege with 96M RAM. A couple of years ago, I was
trouble-shooting a problem with a workstation here by booting with Knoppix.
However, that box had "only" 64M RAM and would not load KDE (which requires a
minimum of 128M RAM). I found the switch to have Knoppix come up using Xfce
and it worked just fine.

   Can playing .mp3 files with xmms stress a system sufficiently to cause it
to hang if the CPU is weak?

I'm seeing this same issue here on my system.  I have strong doubts
that this an AMD processor issue.  Does your system use an nForce
chipset?  That seems to be the common thread in your kerneltrap
reference.

my system:
Asus A8N5X
AMD 64 3000
1GB ECC RAM
Nvidia 6200
Tekram U2W SCSI (53c895 (rev 01)
Intel gigabit ethernet (82541PI)
Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite 2 keyboard (USB)

CentOS 4.2  64 bit version
2.6.9-22.0.1.EL

The common themes I've seen for the various TSC-related problems:

+ AMD CPUs
+ multiple processors (cores)
+ SMP kernel
+ Nvidia chipset (usually Asus motherboard, but this may just be a
reflection of their popularity)

I wouldn't expect the TSC sync to be an issue with either a single CPU
system or if running the uniprocessor kernel.  This might be a good
diagnostic for you.

The VMware note mentions that some motherboards (Nvidia?) don't always
disable the power management feature that causes the TSC sync issue,
even when asked.  If so, this problem may also be chipset-related as
well.

I should have pointed out that I have a single processor system, so
the repeated keystroke problem is not SMP specific.

   Other than the X Window System, I had several rxvts open, pine (in an
xterm), and firefox-1.5.0.1. The usual cast of daemons was running along
(postfix, postgres, sshd, etc.).

   More background: This CPU and RAM were in a workstation with a Soyo
motherboard. Last October (13 months after assembling the system), it would
hang while building a kernel or writing python code in emacs. There's a
thread on the PLUG mail list archives about this. Based on advice given here,
I ran memtest86 on that box (2 or 3 iterations, I don't recall how many). The
RAM checked out fine. The next suggestion was a motherboard failing.

   Last Wednesday morning, my main workstation/server failed. This might have
been the residual affects of a power supply failure last autumn. I decided
that I did not need two boxes sitting here consuming electricity, so I'd
build one box using the faster processor and the drives from the failed box.
Bought a new motherboard to replace the Soyo, used the AMD Athlon XP+ 3200
from that box (the failed box had a XP+ 2100) and the 400MHz memory DIMMs.
All drives from the failed box were moved over.

   This eventually got straighened out (one hard drive cable turned out to be
bad; I bent a power supply pin on the floppy drive) and I thought I was back
in business again.

   Friday morning, the system locked up while I was checking the usual Web
pages I review first thing in the morning. Later that afternoon, it hung
three more times, each time with a shorter uptime interval. Significant PITA.
So I halted the machine, pulled the DIMMs, and had them tested at ENU.
They're fine. So, RAM's fine, motherboard is brand new, the only other
suspect (it seems to me) is the CPU.

   I've not before experienced this amount of hardware trouble. I want to
resolve the problem(s) so I can continue to focus on my business and not
wonder what the system is going to do next.

How long have you run your system as uniprocessor?  The frequency of the
keystroke problem here is once every day or two.

What exactly is a "weak" CPU?  The only thing that seems likely to me is
if the cooling is inadequate--playing digital audio would keep the CPU
busier and perhaps not run as cool as otherwise.

Well it appears to be approaching the end of it's life and already, web
sites are recommending an upgrade to Fedora Core 4.  The up2date engine
in my opinion has something to be desired.

First off, is there a way to get all the updates for Fedora Core 3 and
make a private update mirror before the Internet update servers are
turned off?

Second off, how do I get the source code for the updated Fedora Core 3
packages?

Third, can the Fedora community fix the updater so that people who update 
samba and want to install samba-swat don't have to force the old version 
on?

For the third problem, I updated samba-swat after forcing the old version on.
Major kludge though.

Can the Fedora community be convinced to release an end of life version of
Fedora Core 3 with all of the final updates to it?  Are there tools to replace
old packages with their updated versions on the Fedora Core 3 iso images and
rebuild the install trees?  I would like to be able to install Fedora Core 3
using the updated packages.

Is there any way with the gnome updater to make sure that the updated rpms 
don't get deleted after they are installed?  I've been using:

cp -u /var/spool/up2date/*.rpm $backup_dir

before continuing on to the installation stage, but there has to be a better 
way to save a copy of the update rpms that doesn't involve attending the
update.

Is the Fedora Community fixing the gnome front end to up2date so that
it doesn't lock up and crash so much?  I've noticed a lot of warnings
along the lines of, deprecated function call.

Concerning newer releases of Fedora Core beyond 3, is there a continuing
developement branch for people who want a more ironed out release of Core 3?
Is Core 4 the current release?  How is Core 4 different?

Aside:
Speaking of source code, I can't figure out how to get the source code 
for MHonArc which I downloaded from http://mhonarc.org/.

   The heat sink/fan is a huge one that looks like the cooling tower on a
nuclear power plant. The BIOS is set to turn on the fan when the CPU
temperature reaches 40C (the lowest of the three temperature options).

   From my research into support for lm_sensors, the Soyo board does not have
any; I've not looked to see if the MSI K7N2 Delta 2 board does have support.
So, I don't know how to monitor CPU temperature in real time.

Why not just use the Fedora Legacy repository?

Sounds like a job for wget or rsync.  However, it isn't like the
servers are going to be turned off.  If you had the desire, you could
install FC1 off of mirrors.kernel.org still, along with all the
updates until it was handed off to Fedora Legacy.

The source rpms are stored on the mirrors with the packages, e.g.
http://mirrors.kernel.org/fedora/core/3/SRPMS/

Probably not, because there isn't the demand for it.  Fedora is
supposed to be a bleeding-edge distro, and the developers involved
likely don't want to be bothered with creating a stable distro.  If
you want that you'd be better off with RHEL (or CentOS), or a distro
with a different focus like Debian or Ubuntu.

No, they are removing up2date, since up2date is a RHEL thing.  You
should look into using yum instead.  yumex is a good GUI front-end to
yum.

Core 5 is the current release, released on last Monday.  Hence the EOL
of Core 3.  Core 3 will be transferred to the Fedora Legacy project,
so look into that if you wish to continue running Core 3 with security
updates.

Modern spam bots have learned how to sign up for accounts. To my
knowledge they're not fully generalized, but many sufficiently popular
CGI programs have custom spam bots aimed at them.

Interesting how everyone's move to web-based messaging systems to avoid
spam, has merely brought spam to those systems. Now, will all those damn
fillout the web-based form to report problem things revert to e-mail?
Pretty, please?

What about the contact between the heatsink and the CPU?  Is it making
good contact?  Is there adequate thermal grease?  Have you verified
that the fan *does* turn on?

lm_sensors support seems to remain rather uncommon in desktop-class
motherboards, at least from my experience.

Then yes, I would say playing an MP3 on a system with a CPU that "causes
the system to hang solidly and unexpectedly" would cause the system to
hang.  Oh, wait, but I'd /expect/ to hang the system, but I can't since
it only does it unexpectedly.  So, I reverse my position: No. :)

This CPU came from a system with a failed power supply?  CPUs seem to
rarely go bad on their own, but a failed power supply or over-heating
can cause that kind of thing.  Of course, it's also possible for other
chips to overheat or there to be design errors in the motherboard or bad
routines in the BIOS, etc.  (Are you at the current BIOS/firmware
level?)

Can you not set it to be on all the time?  Does the fan ever come on?
How are the other fans in the system?

If you want to put an artificial load on the CPU, you can do so with
cpuburn: http://pages.sbcglobal.net/redelm/  That would at least tell
you if CPU load is the problem.  Of course, you don't necessarily need
cpuburn; it's easy enough to create a load just with:

$ md5sum /dev/urandom & md5sum /dev/urandom

Probably best to do so from single-user mode or from a rescue or live-CD
sort of system.

You ask a lot of questions. Here are answers to a few of them.

You can make a private mirror with rsync. Just check the mirror list
at http://fedora.redhat.com/download/mirrors.html and find a mirror
near you that supports rsync. Then just mirror the mirror.

The source code is on the mirrors as well in the form of source-rpm
(SRPM), but in a different subdirectory.

If you use the yum utility to do the updates, it won't delete the
downloaded RPMS unless you tell it to. I assume the Gnome update
utility is a wrapper around yum, and it probably tells yum to delete
the files.

The main update servers never go off-line. They just stop getting new
updates. Some of the mirrors may eventually delete the updates for
FC3.

If you're not ready to upgrade the consider getting future updates
from the fedora-legacy project. You just have to set up new yum
config files to point to their update servers, and you can continue
on as before.

If you are ready to update, consider FC5 instead of FC4. But if you
are an inexperienced user you might wait a couple more weeks so that
the experienced users can work out some of the installation issues.

When running the SMP kernel I see the problem every 30-60 seconds.  I
have not done any extended testing (e.g. no more than an hour) with

Auke,

   Thank you. After years of monitoring the mail list I finally unsubscribed
because the tool just works for me. I disabled the task bar on my systems so
it never loads.

All modern CPUs will throttle down and/or halt if they experience
overheating based on an in-package temperature sensor.  On some CPUs
that sensor is exposed via smbus, and thus available to lm_sensors. 
Usually those are more server-class CPUs, like Xeons/Opterons.  I
don't know if there are heatsinks/fans that can connect somehow to a
system management functionality, that would be interesting if
possible.

Have you looked for kernel panics?  Perhaps this is all an unrelated
software issue that happened at the time of changing your system? 
Different device drivers than were in use before?

Interesting discussion, for me.  My assumption has been that people who
prefer a DE to a WM tend to choose one based upon the apps they prefer
-- i.e, like Konqueror, k3b, Kmail, use KDE; like Nautilus,
Epiphany/Galeon, Gaim, Evolution, use Gnome.  Basically, I thought "it's
the apps, stupid."  That's why I've always wondered what XFCE brought to
the table, in it's capacity as a DE rather than a WM.  Once you've
decided not to use KDE or Gnome, it's not clear to me what extra benefit
you get from using XFCE vs. any of Blackbox, fvwm, Afterstep, IceWM,
etc.  That's not to say I don't think there's any good reason to use
XFCE, just that I don't understand how it being a lightweight desktop
environment makes it more useful or desirable than the others being
lightweight (to varying degrees) window managers.  This may be because
my assumptions are incorrect.

I would have said, contrary to your characterization of the assumptions
made about new users, that the reason new users are directed to KDE or
Gnome is because those include a complete set of native apps for most
common desktop tasks.  The heavyweight DE's have ready-made answers to
the common questions that new users have:  how do I send email?, how do
I listen to music?, how do I change my background image?, etc.  What's
more, the answers are more-or-less integrated, so that you can email a
file with Evolution from Nautilus with a right-click, for example.  A
window manager does not provide these answers; from what I can tell,
XFCE provides some of the answers, but not as complete a set as provided
by KDE or Gnome.  Maybe the degree of integration is the same, though?

But distros can, of course, set up their installations to provide what a
DE like XFCE or even a window manager does not.  I was looking over the
project page for Xubuntu yesterday.  It was interesting to see the notes
about what default apps they're considering for inclusion.  (Xubuntu
uses XFCE as the DE.  See: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu ,
specifically the "Proposed Packages" section.)  Damn Small Linux is
another good example.  Since it has to be small, it uses Fluxbox as the
WM and selects some apps for common tasks, like web browsing, that
Fluxbox doesn't provide.  Last time I checked, VectorLinux also used
Fluxbox by default.

We've got an Altus 1300, in addition to a pair of Relions. My 
(obviously limited) experience with Penguin has been great. They 
respond to sales and support requests quickly and helpfully.

The Altus has a pair of Opteron 250s and 4 GB of RAM; it runs the 
32-bit x86 release of CentOS 4. It's deployed as a general-purpose 
login and compute server. The box has experienced no unplanned 
downtimes since it was put into production last September. Performance 
has been great.

The only oddity was that the Penguin-provided rails don't work with 
our four-post configuration of telco racks. It's odd because the 
Relions dropped into the rack without any whining whatsoever.

I guess that's a thumbs-up from me. :-)

the new panel has the following features:

* the panel can have multiple instances - so you can have 2 panels: one with the taskbar and one without

No Altus 1300. Got a couple of 1U Relion servers some years ago. They
are still running fine. One had a failed hard drive right out of the
shipping box, but getting it replaced was reasonably painless. It's been
good since then.

Jason,

   There's something on the motherboard that watches and turns on the fans as
needed.

   No kernel panics; at least, I saw no signs of any.

   I wondered if it was software related. Today, for example, I'm not running
xmms and the system's been as stable as I would expect. What I would like is
to identify the cause so I can then figure out a fix.

Thanks,

Rich

I'm gonna write some stuff down as I see it - no offense taken ;^). I'm an Xfce fan and
supporter for over years now and hope I can provide some insights on "why Xfce"...


this is partially a wrong statement here - gaim is not a GNOME application, and so
is *the* killer app firefox (thunderbird/mozilla). 

Gtk+-2 is a powerfull toolkit with a reasonable small footprint (ha, right?). This has
spurred development to used it and made a lot of users happy - firefox and openoffice
are the 2 biggest and most important killer apps. They require no gnome support and
work perfectly on an empty box with "just" Xorg and gtk+-2.

Now, I didn't say that these are necessarily lightweight but if you drop GNOME on
top of this (gnome-vfs2 and all that it drags along) then the lightweight desktop idea is obliterated. That
makes a lot of people unhappy - as they see no need to upgrade their 1ghz PIII's with
nvidia gforce2 MX440's - it's perfectly capable of running all those apps, and does a
really good job at it even.

they don't want that.

we first of all Xfce is a desktop with some structure - especially the later versions and
4.4 tops it with really good integration. On top of that most of it is modeled
around freedesktop.org's standards and thus offers really good integration
with apps that want some form of gnome or kde interaction (which kde does
really badly - take dnd support for instance).

gnome and desktop have tried to take over the desktop like a virus - they have
a lot of people and fought really hard to conquer the virtual "market" around it.
Apps like epiphany, galeon, konqueror, kmail etc are an example of how _BAD_
open source can be at collaboration.

Xfce's standpoint is different - it aims to be a desktop environment, but not the
-entire- desktop and certainly not all applications. Xfce leaves the choice to you
whether you want to install mozilla or firefox or.... but still gives you a (4.4) a
file manager that gets all the work done and can be operated by your
mother-in-law ;^)

if they would have adhered to the freedesktop.org "desktop file" standard then you 
would have been able to send files directly from Xfce's 4.4 file manager as well!

Here you see what exactly is the problem - it's not Xfce who is stifling innovation
by being the odd one out, but KDE by not integrating with other desktop
environments - driving app developers to madness because they need to
merge kde/gnome related bugfixes to keep their desktop-neutral applications
supported or working.

Xfce is not a window manager - it's a desktop environment. It includes 'xfwm4'
which is a window manager just like metacity, kwin or others. You can run
Xfce with Compiz for instance - without problems.

This is a misconception perhaps - Xfce is lightweight compared to KDE and
GNOME, but if you compare it to enlightenment this doesn't hold anymore. fluxbox
en openbox are not lightweight - they are *minimalistic* - a whole different
range. Consider mozilla -> balsa -> /usr/bin/mail... :^)

Rob,

   In ~/.config/xfce4/xinitrc, at line 46 (on my system) you'll find
xftaskbar4&. Comment that out, restart X, and you'll have no taskbar.

   And I use the panel for the same purpose: switching among open
applications.

Oh, believe me, the taskbar is dead here. :-)

I was only (slightly) concerned the integration of the taskbar in to the 
panel would mean I would be stuck with a task bar in the 4.4 release.

Thanks.  :)

this has been discussed on the Xfce mailinglists and in short:

xfwm4 (the WM of xfce) will most likely not support XGL (in the near future) because:

1. too big of a change
2. it's not meant to be *that* fancy - it's meant to be lightweight and simple
3. it already uses composite which is a reasonable addition enough without affecting 1. and 2.
4. XGL api hasn't stabilized yet
5. you can already use Compiz instead of Xfwm4 if you so desire

hth,

Auke

Michael,

   I suppose that it's Xfce's ability to run KDE or Gnome apps in addition to
anything else. Beyond that I don't know. I pick and choose my applications
and don't care if they all look alike, have the same eye candy or other
things. But, I'm a curmudgeon so you can treat me as an outlying data point.

I haven't experienced enough machines to be certain, but I believe pretty
well *all* processors and motherboards have I2C/SMBUS; as that is how the
motherboard reads those sensors and knows when to do an emergency
shutdown or throttle the fan(s). Now how often the particular sensor
chips are supportted is another matter...

For a while at least, you've got the Fedora Legacy project, but that only
buys you 18 months or so at which point you'll right back here. Beyond
that, no. They stated when they started that this was the plan, you knew
(or should of) that when you opted for Fedora Core, you've only yourself
to blame.

This is where you ask yourself, "what long-support cycle distribution do
I like?" Debian, SuSE and RedHat-Enterprise are your main options; choose
your poison and live with it.

You don't even have to go that far. Just kill xftaskbar and save your

Nope. Our display (model M8536) is too old to work with that adapter. 
The folks at the Apple Store told us they no longer have that sort of 
part for a model as old as ours.

I've been using WinCVS for a few years and have never needed to export. It appears that the UI doesn't have support, but you can type the command in the lower window:

cvs -d :pserver:username at server:/some/dir export -D date -d outdir module

Wil,
Thank you for your help.
I was able to solve my partition type problem using sfdisk.

The grub entry was helpful. What you gave me required change because my box
is a dual core, thus needed "smp" version of the kernel.
I also had to change the root entry: "root=/dev/sda9"
I have avoided the LVM usage because it messes with my understanding of disk
addressing especially when I use Knoppix.

Thanks again,

- Bill Morita

I'm assuming you have GRUB as the bootloader from FC4?  You'll want to edit
/etc/grub.conf and add an entry like:

title Fedora Core 5 (2.6.15-1.2054_FC5)
        root (hd0,8)
        kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-1.2054_FC5 ro root=/dev/rootvg/rootlv
        initrd /boot/initrd-2.6.15-1.2054_FC5.img

Assuming that your hda9 (which, in grub, is hd0,8--it indexes from zero) is
just one large filesystem.

It's just a few bits in the partition table; AFAIK the only thing that
actually cares are the MD and LVM layers, although it can be easier to keep
up with what you've got.

I had the dickens of a time last night installing FC5, mainly because I
didn't want to burn the ISOs to actual CDs.  Since the installer can use a
directory of the ISOs themselves (handling the loopback mounting
automatically), I thought I could just install from the filesystem where I
downloaded them.  Wrong: All of my filesystems except /boot are LVM volumes,
which is loaded from the stage 2 part of the installer.  Damn; well, I
though I could use my USB drive, sine I'd already copied them there for
transporting.  Still wrong: USB storage isn't probes until stage 2.  In the
end, I copied the ISOs to another host and installed over NFS :\

BTW, you can avoid having to burn installation media just by booting the
install kernel and initrd from the first ISO with GRUB (I renamed my files
to be more descriptive):

title Fedora Core 5 Installer
        kernel /fc5-install-vmlinuz
        initrd /fc5-install-initrd

Of course, if I hadn't been so lazy, I could've just used my netboot
server...

RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 is closely related to FC3, and they share
many of the same versions of software.  CentOS4 is a clone of RHEL4,
as is Scientific Linux 4.  While both are good, I would lean towards
the latter, as it is supported by a full time team at FermiLabs,
with the promise that it will be supported for at least five years,
and probably a long time after that.  Certainly a long time after
RedHat stops supporting RHEL4.  

Scientific Linux is used by the big government labs, for array
computing and long-term scientifc experiments.  While it will probably
not have bleeding edge device drivers, it will be around and it will
get security updates for a long time.  If you want the latest device
drivers, then by all means stay on the Fedora Core path, but plan on
updating the distro once or twice a year.  You can't have newness
and stability and familiarity all at once.

New device drivers for common hardware (particularily server hardware)
are very often back-ported to RHEL update releases.  RHEL is supported
for five years from release, and if you give them enough money they'll
probably support it for longer.

What I don't know is whether CentOS/Scientific Linux/etc. follow the
RHEL update releases, and thus also gain the back-ported device
drivers for newer hardware.

I ordered the ASUS P4P800SE Socket 478 Intel 865PE ATX Intel Motherboard back 
in Sept 2005 from NewEgg.com  and I've been real  pleased with it using a 
3.00GHz P4. I got an nVidia 6600 GT card at the same time it's been great 
running Doom 3, the D3 expansion pack, and Quake 4 under SuSE 9.3. 

I also do real work on the box too running Oracle 10g and Eclipse to develop 
and test code when I'm not in the office. :-D

Speaking only about CentOS, For the most part the answer is yes. At
least to the extent that the source rpms that RedHat releases contains
the said back-ported devices and passes their QA process.

Well, he said he was setting up windows GUI folks with CVS...

Are there good SVN winders clients out there that folks would recommend?

Well I know people *say* you can use KDE apps under Gnome and Gnome apps
under KDE, but in practice I have yet to find it satisfactory.  I
installed one qt app (not an official KDE app, but one built with its
widget set) under Gnome and it looked terrible.  It functioned just
fine, but it wasn't much fun to use.  From the screenshots on the
website, I gathered it would've looked much better in a KDE environment.
I should try it (or something else) again in a neutral environment like
XFCE, or a window manager.

Yes, and while that has a lot of value for people with some level of
Linux experience, I still think the reason KDE or Gnome is foisted upon
newbies is to define the choices more concretely.  People like to say
Linux is about choice, which it is, but the overwhelming number of
choices can be somewhat paralyzing.  First, you have to figure out what
distro to try, then what DE/WM's you want to try, then what apps you
want to try.  If you're using KDE and you want to send an email, at the
very least Kmail is there, ready to go, with all the documentation you
need.  It may not be what you like in the long run, but if it wasn't
there, you search Google and look at various Linux websites and plow
through reading about two dozen different email clients, and you get
exhausted and boot back into Windows to use Outlook Express.

I never thought of XFCE as "stifling innovation."  I just didn't
understand it's position as a DE rather than a WM.

The distinction between "lightweight" and "minimalistic" is lost on me,
I'm afraid.  I guess I don't understand how you can be "heavyweight" and
minimalistic simultaneously.  Maybe that's what Enlightenment is aiming
for.  :-)  But Openbox, while certainly minimalistic, feels very
lightweight to me, in that it's snappy and responsive.  XFCE might be
just as snappy, and not minimalistic -- that much I get, anyway.  I'll
have to try it out again once I get my new computer.  I can't remember
where it was the last time I checked it out, but it wasn't up to v4 yet.

Ok since someone asked, I thought I would dump on the pile what I like and
dislike about linux.

First the file structure, boy isn't that a beast to learn, I'm starting to
get the hang of it after months of use, but seriously I can't sit my mom
down in front if a linux box and tell her "hey go to / or
/var/apache/apache.conf (I'm sure I have that path screwed up but it's to
illustrate my point, I can't remember where all the stuff is in this damn OS
and right now, atleast for me, it doesn't make any logical sense.)
 On windows programs are easy to find even when they arn't in the start menu
(there are definatly things to be said about the start menu...I'll get in to
them later.) and unless you start getting in to the nitty gritty of things
(or windoze starts to act flaky / get a virus that is a whole other can of
beans) I atleast know where things are. even on MacOS it's pretty strait
forward with logical naming.

Finding the right program for the job in linux...
Without some heavy reading and great IRC support I'd have been lost long
ago, I'm still asking how to do simple operations in linux. the great thing
is, there are 100 ways to do the same thing, the bad thing is, there are 100
ways to do the same thing.

graphical v. command line
Some apps are made to run in Xwindows there should be a centeral point to go
to to launch these apps.

Eye Candy
yes eyecandy is bloat, but we've become accustomed to making our computers
look cool as hell, yes there is eye candy in xfce but it ain't enough to win
my heart. grey boxes of win95 past should be long gone, but sadly it's not.
take some interface lessons from gmail, nice, simple, elegant, white and
easy. try to apply KISS to the interface without it looking like 10 years
ago.

I could go on, and will, but I'm sure I'm going to be told how wrong I am
(and look forward to my public flogging ;). but for now, here is some more
food for thought. basicly we need to focus a GUI for the computer idiot. not
all the world is as smart as us bleeding edge tech guys.

Do they also release updated installer images?  Doesn't matter too
much if the kernel rpm is updated with your shiny new SATA driver if
the installer image kernel can't understand your SATA controller (as a
rather common example).  This, to me, seems like it would be the
difficult part, since rebuilding SRPMS is easy but remastering an
install CD is a bit more work.

Def take a look at the Asus P4 series, I think I have P4C800E Deluxe that
kicks serious tail. It runs LiveCD's pretty well so I don't see that it
would be too big a pain to get an actual linux install going. One BIG
problem I run in to is that linux doesn't like my SATA RAID 0 array.

On Windows, just like *any* OS, you can put an executable file
anywhere you damn well please.  It is not really any more difficult to
remember /usr/bin than it is to remember C:\Program Files, and it sure
is easier to type.  Creating a link from there to your start menu,
application menu, root window menu, or Chili's menu is the job of the
package installer, on Windows, OSX, any variant of Unix, *and* Linux.

I have at least as much difficulty finding the right program for the
job in Windows.  At least when I find it in Linux, I usually don't
have to pay several hundred dollars for it.

Refer to my earlier point about the job of the package installer.

Look into skins/profiles/templates/themes/whatever they're called for
your window manager.

Perhaps you should try thinking beyond the box that Redmond has built
around you.  Why are we limited to 2D windowing at all?  Why do we
still use the qwerty keyboard and mouse, invented so long ago and
proven to be bad ergonomically, as our primary input devices?

What happened to the 3D Doom wrapper for ps/kill?

And why, oh, why does Gmail, in all its wondrous elegance, not have
configurable color themes?

Tim,

Linux is not for the lazy, it is for learners. My kids (from 7-13) use 
Ubuntu with ease. They have their own login, customized desktops etc. 
They do not do any installing because I do not allow them, they could if 
I would let them. I am curious as to what simple things you are still 
trying to do? I understand that most people only use 5-9 applications.

As for understanding the way the files structure works... well, I am not 
sure why you are having difficulties. I would suggest a book on Linux. 
One thing that can be confusing is all of the bin files seems like the 
bin files have bin files which is strange. I can understand some of the 
confusion, but I think some education as to what var or usr or home 
folders are intended to be used for might make your Linux experience 
easier. You sound like a person that wants to know what and how an OS 
works which is a prime user for Linux. Now you just have to put in the 
time and learn it. Good luck.

I'm not positive one way or the other.  I suspect that installer images
are updated. But again, this is all dependent on what work RedHat does. 
Centos inherently does not change what RedHat provides, and yes I'm sure
there are exceptions.


In reading the posts that Johnny Hughes Jr. and other write, just the
opposite is true.  Rebuilding the installer image is not too difficult. 
But then that is what is scripting is for.  QA on the other hand does
take time as the source rpms have to be stripped of RedHat proprietary
info, mostly branding stuff I believe.  Undoubtedly, YOU can determine
what changes are coming down the pike since RedHat provides quite a bit
of documentation, which CentOS mirrors quite a bit of.

Do we just say that to feel better about ourselves? "it's not easy, nor
should it be!" or like I always tell my parents (they are windows lovers)
"If you want it to just work, get a mac!" I think it's cool that your kids
are learning *nix at a young age, I wish I was more in tune with the tech
world back then. I honestly grew up on apple hardware and microsoft. I
remember DOS hacking like there was no tomorrow, generally to get past what
ever blocks my parents friend tried to throw at me. I demolished more then
my share of computers back in the day but just wish I had the opertunity to
learn *nix younger.

But what is it you want from Linux, anyway? Your list of complaints seems 
to boil down to faulting Linux for not being more like Windows.  Why does 
the world need yet another Windows-like user environment?  Isn't one 
enough?

Obviously, long-time Linux/UNIX users have responses to all of your list 
items.  Personally, I think that KDE is pretty much the "Linux for idiots" 
that you speak of, though it has its share of annoyances for the 
uninititated as well.

Except when /usr/bin might be /usr/local/bin, or /bin, or /sbin,
or /usr/X11R6/bin, or /usr/local/sbin.  It's not usually *you* putting
the executable anywhere, it's usually your distro's package manager.
The app's website says to find the docs in /such/and/such, but it turns
out your distro in its infinite wisdom uses /so/and/so instead.  And the
particular example.conf the website says to refer to isn't where the
website says it will be, and may not be anywhere on your system because
the package maintainer decided to strip it out.  And you search Google
for how to alter a particular start-up routine, and only after you
follow the "Linux" instructions and they don't work do you discover that
they depend upon your distro using System V init vs. BSD-style init or
vise-versa.

Windows, OS X, FreeBSD are all *one* thing each; Linux is many things.
You install something on any of the former, and you know that the
install routine will work the same way it always does, and you'll find
all the elements in the same places you always do, which will be exactly
where the app's website will tell you where to find them.  You install
something on "Linux" and it's time to play a guessing game, at least
until you become familiar with your particular distro's routines and
learn how to adapt the generic "Linux" instructions to your own distro's
quirks.

This does make "Linux" more confusing and harder to grok.  The others
are operating systems; Linux literally is a kernel, and colloquially is
a term for a host of distinct operating systems, many of which function
in subtly and not-so-subtly distinct ways.  "Mac OS X Jaguar for
Dummies" will do me fine for learning OS 10.3 Panther.  Sure, some new
features won't be covered, but the guts will be the same.  AppleScript
is still AppleScript, it's not apt, yum, yast, emerge, pacman, or urpmi.
I go to buy "Linux for Dummies" and it turns out that it's really "Red
Hat for Dummies." What good does that do me if I'm not running RH or one
of its variants?  There is a whole set of issues Linux users face that
users of the others do not.

Yah, my Windows copy of OpenOffice.org was almost a pricey as Microsoft
Office.  And Firefox, boy the Mozilla people really rip you off on
Windows.  But, you know, you get a discount if you buy Firefox and
Thunderbird together.  :-)

Have you seen?:  http://www.theopencd.org/

Chances are, if you're paying hundreds of dollars for a Windows program,
then you're buying something that will run only on Windows and has no
Linux or OS X equivalents.

I've found a workaround that seems to work so far, in fact it's the
opposite of the workaround suggested above.  ;-)

I found this detailed description of the AMD TSC issue, straight from
the mouth of an AMD engineer, Rich Brunner:

http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/4/173

Some key quotes, just in case the above link goes away since it seems
to be excluded from archive.org:

-----
Current AMD Opteron(tm)  and Athlon(tm)64 processors provide
power  management mechanisms  that independently  adjust the
performance state ("P-state") and power state ("C-state") of
the  processor[1][2];  these  state  changes  can  affect  a
processor  core's  Time   Stamp  Counter  (TSC)  which  some
operating systems  may use as  a part of their  time keeping
algorithms.
-----

-----
Applications  should  avoid   using  the  TSC  directly  for
timekeeping  and instead rely  on the  appropriate operating
system  calls.   Using  the   TSC  directly  means  that  an
application  is not  protected from  TSC-drift and  does not
benefit  from   the  logic   in  the  operating   system  to
work-around it; as a result, applications using TSC directly
could get confused by TSC-drift.
-----

VMware does not follow this advice, it would seem.

-----
TSC  drift  due  to  C1-clock  ramping  can  occur  only  on
8th-generation[8]   AMD    multi-processor   platforms   and
uni-processor  dual-core platforms.   This  drift can  *not*
occur  on  single-processor  single-core platforms.   It  is
generally noticeable only when the operating system uses the
TSC as either the only source  of time or as a fast timer to
interpolate  between  periodic  timer interrupts.
-----

-----
STPCLK-throttling   is  supported   on   8th-generation  AMD
uni-processor and multi-processor platforms; it is supported
for   7th-generation   processors   only  on   uni-processor
platforms.  STPCLK-throttling  reduces the power consumption
of the  entire platform by  dividing down the clock  rate of
all processor cores in  all processors on the platform.
...
Platform  vendors typically use STPCLK-throttling
as a  safeguard to quickly  cool a platform due  to abnormal
thermal  conditions that  occur on  the platform  or  in the
environment   the  platform   is  in.
...
STPCLK-throttling ramps  up and  down  the clock
grid of all  cores on a processor equally,  therefore it can
not cause TSC drift on a uni-processor platform.
...
STPCLK signaling will  reach processors in a multi-processor
platform at different times,  and each processor can ramp up
and down at different times and different durations than the
others;  therefore TSC  drift can  occur on  such platforms.
-----

-----
Future AMD processors will provide a TSC that is P-state and
C-State invariant and unaffected by STPCLK-throttling.  This
will make  the TSC immune  to drift.  Because using  the TSC
for  fast  timer APIs  is  a  desirable  feature that  helps
performance,  AMD  has  defined  a CPUID  feature  bit  that
software   can   test   to   determine   if   the   TSC   is
invariant.
-----

-----
In  general,  it  is  likely  that  end  users  should  only
experience   and  notice   TSC  drift   on  single-processor
dual-core platforms  which do not expose HPET  and which are
running an older operating system  that is using TSC on that
platform. On  such platforms which  run Linux, the  end user
can correct  the problem by specifying  the appropriate boot
option  switch  to  bypass   the  TSC  such  as  "notsc"  or
"clock=pmtmr".    Equivalent  solutions   exist   for  other
operating systems[4].
-----

-----
[1] Throughout this discussion,  a processor is defined as a
    physical  socketed chip package  containing one  or more
    on-die CPU cores;  a processor plugs into a  socket on a
    platform motherboard.
[2] These are described  in the "BIOS and Kernel Developer's
    Guide  for   AMD  Athlon(tm)  64   and  AMD  Opteron(tm)
    Processors", Publication 26094
[3] TSC drift occurs when the computed (expected) difference
    between the  TSCs of two  cores is no longer  a constant
    value but  varies by a  significant amount to  the shock
    and surprise of the operating system.
[4] 32-bit  Windows XP SP2,  64-bit Windows XP,  and Windows
    2003  SP1  provide   the  "/usepmtimer"  switch  in  the
    boot.ini to  override using the  TSC on single-processor
    dual-core platforms; these operating systems do not rely
    upon TSC on multi-processor platforms.

[6] ACPI Power Management  Timer is defined in the "Advanced
    Configuration   and   Power   Interface   Specification,
    Revision 3.0"
[7] AMD's 7th  generation  processors return  a CPUID  base
    family value of '7'. These include AMD Athlon, AthlonXP,
    AthlonMP, and Duron.
[8] AMD's  8th generation  processors  return an  effective
    CPUID family of '0x0F'. These include AMD Opteron,
    Athlon64, and Turion.
-----

The suggested "clock=pmtmr" kernel option seems to have solved the
frequent keyboard repeat problem for me.  Note that this is an
SMP-specific issue, so Galen Seitz's keyboard repeat problem is
something different.

I may still have an infrequent problem, but at least the system is
usable now.  With the keyboard going nuts every 30-60 seconds or so,
it really wasn't.

The installer images for both CentOS and S.L. tend to exceed what is
available for RHEL, both in frequency and range of available apps
software.  I don't know how CentOS is for device drivers, but S.L.
offers only what RHEL does.   And RHEL is pretty conservative in the
device driver department - it is targeted at servers, not at laptops
or desktop workstations particularly.  That is why I suggest Fedora
Core for those with 2006 happy-family-mixed-vegetable-brand gizmos
that have alpha development drivers available.  But if you can show
some restraint in your hardware purchases, then you can get by on 
stable drivers.

Where S.L. exceeds RHEL is in range of apps, and in testing.  Since
it starts with RHEL, and then adds more testing amongst the scientific
community, it is slightly less buggy - and reaches users a few months
later.  S.L. adds extra software for updating and extra repositories
( I avoid ATRPMS, but DAG is good ), more applications and file system
types, and heavy support for clustering.  Generally it is extended 
into the scientific/academic space , as you would expect from the 
name.  You can find it at: https://www.scientificlinux.org/

I don't mean to disparage CentOS with the S.L. promotion;  I use
CentOS on my offsite virtual server, and it has its own charms.
I suspect there is a lot of sharing between the two communities,
and that helps both.  

But the main thing about both is that they are stable, and supported
for a long time.  If you like RedHat style, are too cheap to pay for
RHEL but still want long term support, and don't need bleeding edge
drivers, then consider CentOS or Scientific Linux.  If you need the
latest drivers and are willing to make upgrades, go for Fedora.

Now try to tag some mail after it has gotten to your inbox.  You're 
stuck clicking select, tag, archive, with a nice pause between tag and 
archive at a page of 20 at a time (even when the search matches 
thousands of messages) and if you happen to accidentally click archive, 
oops, you'll have to start your search again without the "in:inbox" 
parameter.

> try to apply KISS to the interface 

Too simple means broken.  Some things really are complicated.  How do 
you change the file associations on a windows box?  Is that a text file 
in /etc/... ?  No, you have to edit the registry.  Granted, most people 
will use the special file association editor, but we're getting much 
more complicated than text file here and introducing another layer of 
flawed interface over the data.

You can't fault Linux for being transparent, spread out, and loosely 
joined.  That's the way it is and the way it is going to stay.

Now, what's the company that sells you a thin-client(ish), 
fully-maintained, home linux solution -- answering the phone 24/7 with 
"no problem, try it now" plus the continual security updates?  And how 
much do they charge?

Triad, schmriad.  I want easy, powerful, and cheap... no, free.  And now 
too, right?

David,

I was also thinking that Linspire/Lindows was "Linux for idiots" because 
it has the 'Click to Run'... but I openly admit that I have only about 
10 minutes on a Linspire/Lindows machine. (Back when PC Club was selling 
them.)
Have any of you ever used Linspire/Lindows?

[subversion] yes and will be setting it up as well.

but .. i'm working here with those that from what
i was told, took years to even use rcs, and now
i will have MS Windows types added to the mix.

but to the issue with wincvs, it could be i've
not RTMF'ed yet, but shouldn't a GUI be obvious :) ?


lets say i have a project called mystuff

on the PC i have a directory c:\test

yesterday when i was telling wincvs to export the module
mystuff, each time i did it it would each time create
an new branch under c:\test, first time c:\test\mystuff
then c:\mystuff\mystuff and so on.

I made sure I had only c:\test selected ..

will see if i can recreate it today with creating a
module on the PC first

i'm off to checking out subversion clients

Why, yes, it's not Windows, and does things differently.  What's your point?  

All this talk of XFCE made me try XUbuntu again.  Pretty slick, though a
few missing applets and usability niggles make me prefer Gnome.

What's frustrating is that Firefox/Epiphany/whatever take so much RAM
and CPU that a lightweight desktop makes little difference in performance.
Dang, I wish Dillo were somewhere beyond Netscape 4 in capabilities.

FC3 is close enough to Centos 4 that it should be possible to upgrade
an FC3 machine to Centos 4 with yum.  I have seen a few postings about
people taking this path.  It basically involves installing the centos
release package and doing "yum upgrade".  Alternatively, a fresh
install of Centos 4 should be compatible.

I doubt Centos and Scientifc Linux will be supported longer than the
RHEL version they are based on.  Five years is the support lifetime
for RHEL releases.  Centos and Scientific Linux mainly just rebuild
the updates which come from Redhat.

Do you need SCSI2 or will SCSI work - I assume if you are calling it an 
'old school tape drive' that SCSI will work.

If so I have 2 you can try.

Again, Scientific adds to RHEL ( for example, pine and OpenAFS ),
and they update their disto (they are at 4.2 ), and they support
"clones of clones".  They explicitly state that they will support
S.L. well beyond the RHEL end-of-life if there is a significant use
base still using it.  Since their user base is typically physical
scientists with kludgy home-brew apps that would probably break
with library updates, they have a strong incentive to keep the old
stuff going.  AFAIK, they haven't end-of-lifed any of their versions
yet.  And they have full time people working on S.L. at FermiLabs
and at CERN.  That is specifically why I chose them over CentOS,
even if CentOS has more of a "community feel".

Indeed, education is the key. But I still must fault Linux a bit here. 
Someone else said "/usr/bin" is as easy to learn as "c:\Program 
Files." I must disagree. It's a picky point, to be sure, but a novice 
will have no idea what "/usr/bin" is for. When I started using Linux a 
year ago I literally thought it was the trash folder. Well, it said "bin" 
didn't it? I'll agree that "c:\Program Files" is not completely clear 
either, but it's a lot clearer than "/usr/bin." 

Perhaps the Linux for Dummies edition should come with a file 
manager that displays folders translated into non-Unix terms. I 
don't mean into Windows terms, as that is also not perfectly clear 
either. I mean, start over from scratch and make labels that no 
beginner could possibly confuse.

Recognizing our faults is the first step to improving ourselves.

John,

I do not fault Linux for my lack of understanding the OS. If I do not 
take the time to understand how the thing works, I can only expect to 
come to a certain level of understanding, which tends to be minimal. 
Maybe what would really be helpful would be some generic mouse over 
hints. Linux clicks with some people, others it doesn't. Take care.

Despite the level of detail, I think newbies could learn a lot by
just skimming the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.

   I would like some thoughts on what could be wrong with my newly-built
composite system. There are still unresolved issues of system lockups and
segmentation faults that are new experiences for me and beyond my expertise.

   The past two mornings, just after logging in and starting X, the system has
locked up solidly while loading Xfce. Yesterday it was after the root window
wallpaper loaded; today at the next step, after the panel loaded. In both
cases I had to do a hardware reset, and then X started just fine.

   Thinking to eliminate one possibility, I just downloaded the xfce-4.2.3.2
tarball so I could rebuild from source and see if that makes a difference.
Trying to check free drive space in the various partitions, I get a
segmentation fault from 'df -h' or just 'df.' How strange!

   I thought that a seg fault was a bad data structure or pointer that crossed
a code boundary in the ia86 processor/memory architecture. Despite the 2.2M
hits Google returned, all I saw were reports of the occurrence of a
segmentation fault, not a confirmation of just what it is, and what causes
them.

   This sudden lack of stability with a new motherboard, memory that tests
good, and the same hard drive that worked flawlessly in the old
workstation/server is distracting and bothersome. If anyone has ideas on what
the problem might be, ways to test for the problem source, or practical
solutions, I would like to learn from your greater expertise and experience.

TIA,

Rich

Seg fault is not x86 specific.  It can happen on any processor that has
an MMU or other memory access protection.  If a read, write, or fetch
occurs to an area of memory where that type of access is not allowed by the
MMU, a seg fault will occur.

An old, but still relevant link.

I think you have a hardware problem, not software.  Here are some ideas.

Boot from Knoppix or similar and try to recreate the problem.  If the
problem persists, this would confirm that it's not a software problem, 
and that it is unlikely to be a disk drive problem.

Double check that the processor is not being overclocked.

Double check that the memory is not being overclocked.

Double check that the front side bus is not being overclocked.

Double check that the PCI bus is not being overclocked.

Your motherboard probably has some fan connections that are not speed
controlled.  Move your CPU fan to one of these connectors.  If your
motherboard has a CPU fan speed check in the BIOS, you will probably 
have to disable it.

Make sure you have good contact between the CPU and heatsink.

Check the DMA configuration of your disk drive.  Consider backing its
speed down.

Go back to the shop where you got the motherboard and ask if you can get
a loaner motherboard and power supply from different vendors.  If the
problem persists with the different mb and power supply, your CPU may
have been damaged when your old system died.

Good luck!

I've got an odd box here that I can't use but I thought someone in this
group might be interested in it.  It's a Digital computer running (I
believe) an older version of Redhat.  I hate to toss it out but can't
really justify keeping it.  Anyone interested?

Rich,
These are all great ideas.  You may also want to check cables, 
interconnects, and I/F boards to eliminate them.  I build systems at 
FreeGeek and have seen many mysterious problems caused by flaky cables,  
incompatible NIC's, graphics and sound boards.  Try removing everything 
that you  don't need.

   This CPU came from the system that did not experience the power supply
failure last autumn. The motherboard is new; it replaces the Soyo that was in
place before. The power supply is also the new Antec, not the generic model
that came in this case.

   Thank you. I've replaced one hard drive cable that turned out to have gone
bad and will check the rest of the components, too.

heh, that's an rtfm allright ;^).


yes - everyone should get some education before using a computer!

-> spam, malware, permissions, passwords are part of the digital world and the concepts should be known to all mankind if we wish to survive!

no - some things are not productive - devices should just work to the end user 

-> imagine having to format your phone and enter all your phone codes before you can make a call


it's a balance struggle - neither side will win because they can't - you can never educate everyone, and you cannot make nerds out of all of them - some just have to be "human" too ;^)

While I can't use the excuse of being a newbie anymore, in many ways I 
still am one. What would help is some collection of links to information 
like this. When coming from the Win world, many of us are unaware that 
information like this exists. Maybe the Plug web site could offer a 
Newbie-Links page. As links like this one turn up, they could be added.

As another example, I recently discovered, thanks to a pointer from one 
of you on this list, that I can read man pages with Konqueror by 
putting, for example,

man:ls

in the address box of the browser. Now while that addressed my immediate 
  question of another way to search with a man page, it also resulted in 
the discovery of another set of man pages written in a way that 
explained more than the usual pages.

Continuing with the example of man:ls, I get,

---------------------------------------------
There is more than one matching man page.

/usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz


/usr/share/man/man1p/ls.1p.gz
---------------------------------------------

The first one is what I am used to seeing, and works fine as a reference 
to remind me of what options a command has. The second one explains more 
about how the command and its options work. For me, this is particularly 
useful when I hear, "Such-and-such command will do what you want. Just 
read the man pages." Up until a week or so ago, I was completely unaware 
of this additional set of documentation.

Disclaimer: I'm running SuSE 9.1. I have no idea if this same set of 
documentation exists on other distributions.

Or you could talk to Poweel's Tech books and see if they want it for their 
collection of ancient equiptment.  (I have a Sparcbook I need to take over

what kind of card/driver are you using? older nvidia binary drivers were known to lockup - and ati's fglrx driver hasn't been much better. Especially composite pushes the driver to madness - you might want to stay away from it if you're stuck with older drivers or just value your time ;^)

Message-ID: <022901c65353$cbcb3100$6d01a8c0@RAMA>

I do not seem to be able to get XDMCP working on FC5.
I use cygwin from my XP box to access my multipled linux boxes.
Up until now I have used the proceedure of:

. From /etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess file, uncomment the line "# * #any host can get
a login window".
. From /etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config file, comment out the line
"DisplayManager.RequestPort: 0".
. From /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf file, set the enable status to True (or 1) in
[xdmcp] section.
. From /etc/kde/kdm/kdmrc file, set the enable status to True (or 1) in
[xdmcp] section.

Except with FC5, I cannot find gdm.conf and "Xwin.exe -query HOST" does not
get a response from the FC5 box.

I know that XDMCP is a security risk, but I am on my on internal network.

I would be willing to change to a more secure remote desktop setup if
someone would suggest one.

Thanks in advance.

The key here is a distinction between how easy it is to learn and how easy it is
to figure out without being told.  Both are easy to learn.  Someone may think they
know what C:\Program Files is for without being told.  A quick scan of my work
WinXP system shows 396 directories containing files with the extension exe. 
C:\Program Files is an understatement at best.

I'd assert that any one who does not know what /usr/bin is for needs to stick with
the options provided for in menus and desktop icons.  If one needs more than what
is  provided for by those visual prompts remembering /usr/bin is the least of
their worries.

side story


I have a friend who does residential remodeling. He's worked in his trade for over
25 years and has a waiting list of over a year for people who appreciate the
quality of his work.  He also teaches occasional classes at Home Depot.

I asked him what the most common fault was in students who come to his classes.
"They don't know how to hammer" was the reply.  Now really, how hard is it to use
a hammer?  That's the rub.  It has an obvious place for your hand and an obvious
surface for striking the nail or other object.  Many people see the obvious and
assume they've got the hammer all figured out.  Only they have no real clue on how
to properly use the tool.

A hammer enables easy misuse.  An OS typically doesn't.  Linux does so less than
Windows.  This is a bad thing?

I would also try running memtest86+ (http://www.memtest.org/) this is
a good way to exercise the CPU, memory, and motherboard.  Any errors
reported should be considered a sign that you have a problem either
with overclocking or bad hardware.  If you see problems, try changing
your BIOS to "fail safe" settings and running it again.

If this still fails, then either your motherboard/CPU or memory are
bad.  I usually start by swapping out or reducing the memory simply
because this is easier than swapping the whole motherboard/CPU
assembly.  ;-)

   This was done last autumn. Also, this past Friday I took the memory DIMMs
to ENU and they tested OK there, too.

Auke,

   The same card and drivers that worked in another system for 2+ years (and

Auke,

   This problem started in the past couple of weeks. Whatever was run on the
video card two weeks ago did not cause that system to lock up ... ever. As a
matter of record, until the power supply failed in that box, it ran for about
two years with reboots only for new kernel versions. The other workstation --
the one that provided the current CPU and RAM -- did hang up several times
last autumn and winter. That's why I suspect a failing CPU because everything
else has worked well in the previous system or (in the case of the memory)
consistently tests OK.

I've been to it many times and have found useful stuff there. The 
difference is that I had a notion of what I was looking for. For a

Every time I've had a power supply failure on a computer plugged
directly into wall power, it's taken some hardware with it.  This has
varied from a single disk drive to almost everything inside the case.

I've never had a power supply die on me when the system was on a UPS--
even a cheapo UPS.  Maybe I'm just lucky, or maybe the brief power
lags I can see now that I have the UPSes to alarm are slowly taking a
toll on the power supplies.

I still think running Memtest86+ on your current CPU, motherboard, and
known-good memory would be a good idea.  Despite the name, it tests
more than the memory.  If the CPU or motherboard has been fried, they
should fail this test.  Run it overnight and see what happens...

I totally swear by having a 'real' line filter.

If you can afford it or have good scrounging skills,
try to get a good isolation transformer, the best
come from companies like OneAC. Real ones are not cheap,
unless you find one at a surplus or thrift store.

Use to have my whole house on a 250A OneAC line
filter. Everything from light bulbs to X10 devices
lasted longer. Now wish I had kept it.

That is a good point - I have been looking at "bin" and seeing an
abbreviation for "binary" for over 30 years.  That was the case in
DOS, for example, and in CPM and unix and way back to the first
PDP-8 I worked on.  There was a time when the "ARY" in "binary",
stored in RAM, cost as much as a cup of coffee.  Abbreviations
saved money.  The trash directory came much later, when disks
became cheap enough that saving discarded files was an option.

Some bright person at Microsoft realized the "bin/trash" confusion, and
hence "Program Files" was introduced for Windoze.  And yes, Microsoft
has had many bright people.  It's the implant that makes them evil.

Consider the phrase "acoustic guitar".  Before electric guitars, 
all guitars were "acoustic guitars", and the adjective "acoustic"
was redundant and unnecessary.  Words change with context.

Programmers invent nomenclature at a prodigious rate.  Unimaginative
ones forget that their nomenclature may last a long time, and may
bounce off other nomenclature from other development threads, or off
new situations that import concepts from the Real World (tm).  Take
the word "port", which is used in half-a-dozen contexts in computers,
all formerly isolated, now tied together.  When contexts merge, 
nomenclatures can self-destruct. 

So when choosing names, keep in mind that context will shift during
the life of a program, sometimes lethally.  Perhaps we will need
"intertemporalization" as well as "internationalization" files for
our programs, to accomodate context shifts.

But back to Linux.  John, you are in a great position to serve the
community when you run into these ambiguities and misnamings.  Your
observations are valuable, and can help a lot of people.  A year
from now, all this will be old hat and Linuxisms will be obvious
and natural to you, so writing this stuff down now is important. 
May I suggest you start a blog or a wiki, and get this stuff
captured where Google can find it? 

If you need help setting up a wiki, we can work on it at the next
clinic.  If you don't have a website to put a wiki on, perhaps we
can get started on that, too.  I can loan you space on my server,
if you pay for yet another domain name (use dyndns.org), and in
time you can move everything to your own server.

And speaking of bruised thumbs and typing, I have a problem with my
Ubuntu-64 Breezy laptop, which uses nVidia proprietary video drivers.
(Side note: Word on the Ubuntu forums is that installing the upcoming
Dapper Drake will not require reinstalling the nVidia video drivers.)

The reason I installed the nVidia drivers was to get Totem to play
movies, which it now does very well. Previously, while trying to get
movies working I had installed ogle, gxine, vlc and mplayer. So last
night, this being spring break, I decided to watch a movie and try out
the other players. All failed, and have been uninstalled, except gxine.
So I was playing this movie with gxine and suddenly "Do you want to
enable stikey keys" popped up. I said no, and continued to watch the
movie. A few moments later another one popped up. And so it went for
15-20 minutes. At one point I clicked on No and another one popped up
immediately. This went on for 10-15 popups before it finally went away.
And afterwards another one popped up every vew minutes. Eventually I
decided I didn't like gxine, particularly because there was evidently a
bug with sticky keys. After all, I had not touched the keyboard once,
not even to start the movie. I went to close gxine, but all I could get
with the mouse was a + sign over whatever I was clicking on, and no
action resulted. The keyboard was completely dead. I had to shut down
the computer to escape.

Now, I have had this "Do you want to enable sticky keys" window pop up
before. Normally it just goes away when I click on No. It's annoying,
but it doesn't happen that often. And it has always happened on this
computer, even back when I was running Hoary. The thing is, though,
that it happens at random even if I don't press the shift key five
times, which is supposed to be how you turn on sticky keys.

At this point I just want to get it off my computer. According to what
I can find it is part of X. But the only documentation I can find tells
me how to enable it and how to disable it. I need to REMOVE it forever.
Or at least find some startup code that will make it unavailable even
if the user presses shift five times. I can't find any documentation
that tells me how to get completely rid of it. Does anyone have any
ideas?

Thanks for the suggestion. I won't have much time to play with it, and 
that's better than scrapping it. I'm an ex-DEC field service guy back 
when the VAX 11780 was king and the first 1 MIP processor. I have a 2.0 
GHz Celeron laptop rated 2449 MIPS, and that's considered old.  :)

Well, I nearly gave myself carpal tunnel syndrome manually changing 
permissions of a few hundred files one-by-one in mc -- try repeating 
"C-x c <arrow-down> <arrow-down> <arrow-down> <arrow-down> <arrow-down> 
<spacebar> s" over and over, and your hand will be pretty sore too.

That was before I read 'man chown,' which nearly made me give up on 
Linux altogether.  Linux man pages either are the greatest thing since 
sliced bread or make you want to put your head through the monitor.  But 
then I found a useful tutorial somewhere that was written in English 
with examples, and all was well again.  I still think 'man chown' is a 
good example of a man page that could not be less newbie friendly if it 
tried.  It seems deliberately calculated to shut out the uninitiated.

Subject: [PLUG] Hardware Found With One Kernel, Not With Other
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0603291608470.3738@salmo.appl-ecosys.com>

   I've spent the day trying to get my system running reliably again, but
without a lot of success. Here's a summary: cannot build the 2.6.16 kernel;
somewhere during the make it hangs the system (same as when this CPU was in
the former motherboard).

   The stock Slackware-2.4.31 kernel was configured for an i486. I re-ran
'make menuconfig' and changed that to MK7 (for the AMD Athlon XP+ 3200).
Cleaned up a couple of minor things (such as removing ham radio support),
then ran 'make dep & make clean & make & make modules & make
modules_install'; copied from arch/i386/boot to /boot and rebooted the
system. Yes, I added another stanza to /etc/lilo.conf and ran /sbin/lilo. The
generic_serial driver was not built. That's needed to access the additional
serial port on the add-in PCI card so that I can synchronize my PDA with
jpilot. Under the stock 2.4.31 kernel that was /dev/ttyS4, and the module was
/lib/modules/2.4.31/kernel/drivers/char/generic_serial.o.gz. So, 2.4.31 no
longer works.

   I also built 2.4.32. Same .config file, but I also ran 'make oldconfig'
first. Now I have /lib/modules/2.4.32/kernel/drivers/char/generic_serial.o
(not gzipped), and that's loaded. But, setserial /dev/ttyS4 now shows:
             /dev/ttyS4, UART: unknown, Port: 0xffffffff, IRQ: 0.
With the old stock 2.4.31 kernel it showed the UART as 16550 and the port and
IRQ were as expected.

   Not before have I had this type of difficulties building kernels. I don't
understand why the 2.4.32 modules are built but not gzipped, why the 2.4.31
kernel no longer has the generic_serial module, or why building a 2.6 kernel
causes the machine to hang. While I suspect the latter is related to the CPU,
the problems with the 2.4 kernels should be resolvable quickly. But, I've
spent my day spinning my wheels on this and not being productive. If someone
has ideas on what might have gone wrong, please share them.

Message-ID: <20060330031642.04C601023B1@medulla.enet.sharplabs.com>


I have a research paper I'm writing (in latex) in which are included
a number of resolution-enhanced images.  (The research is on resolution
enhancement.)  The images look great
when the document is printed as a postscript file.  But when
I convert the PS file to PDF with:

ps2pdf14 paper.ps

(which creates paper.pdf) the images look awful.  The size of the .pdf
file (200 Kbytes) vis-a-vis the .ps file (4 Mbytes) tells the story.

The conversion is compressing the images with jpeg compression and the
resulting block and colour artifacts ruin my results.

Does anyone know how (under linux) to convert the .ps manuscript to
.pdf with compression turned off, or at least with lossless
compression?

FYI, the .ps was created by:

    latex paper.tex;
    dvips -o -N0 -Ppdf -G0 paper.dvi;

The images that were included were all converted to .eps
by ImageMagick's `convert' and included w/in the latex file
using  \epsfig{...}

Thanks in advance.

Dean,

How are you converting it to a pdf file? Are you printing to pdf? or Are 
you using a conversion utility? I would start by printing to a pdf 
printer and then print it to a file... if you can do that(?). I am not 
real familiar with latex, but am pretty familiar with pdf and postscript.

I will try it on my linux box... right now I am on a doze machine.

Subject: [PLUG] Booting mulitple Linuxes
Message-ID: <442B56FD.5050106@writemoore.net>

The new machine has landed and so far, anyway, it is *sweet.*  I never 
thought the old iMac was a speed demon, but it's positively pokey 
compared to this -- I guess a extra processor and more than double the 
amount of ram makes some difference after all.  :-)  Plus, I kinda 
splurged (for me, anyway) on the monitor and it's nice to have the 
luxury of lots of screen real estate.

So Ubuntu was pre-installed and is working fine, or as fine as Ubuntu 
can.  Now I want to install another distro or two, but I'm thrown off by 
  the presence of a separate boot partition.  I've never done that, I've 
never gotten more complex than /, swap, and /home.  The boot partition 
has all the stuff you'd expect, including grub, but it's more complex 
than I've encountered before.  (I'll post the grub menu.list at the end 
of this message.)  Honestly, I've never paid a lot of attention to 
/boot, and grub and yaboot have always worked so well that I've just 
overwritten them all the time upon a new Linux install, when 
dual-booting with Windows or OS X.  They've always found the other OS 
present, and I never had more than one Linux OS present.

 From what I've read, I gather I should *not* overwrite grub in the MBR 
when I install a second Linux OS.  I should finish the install, boot 
back into Ubuntu, and edit menu.list, adding the appropriate information 
about where to find the kernel and initrd for the new OS.  What I can't 
figure out is if I'm supposed to move the kernel and initrd images to 
the existent boot partition, or leave them on the root partition of the 
new OS, or create a new separate boot partition for the new OS.  I've 
seen suggestions that it's better to move them, and that moving them is 
asking for trouble.  I don't really understand what either method gains 
you, but I don't really understand what having a separate boot partition 
in the first place gains you.  Is it just an extra layer of protection, 
in case something bad happens in your root partition, at least the 
kernel and boot sequence is preserved?  Or is there more to it than that?

How do you typically handle booting multiple Linuxes?

This is what my menu.list looks like.  It scares me.  The default is 
2.6.12-10-k7-smp.  I'm not sure why I have two others; do I really need 
them?:

Dean,

   I didn't see your original message; I'm having fits with my system.

   Have you tried pdflatex instead of plain latex? I've used dvips with the
default options and had that work just fine. Of course, I don't have 4M .eps
files.

   I used to have a book called "Linux A-Z" that was used for an operating
system course at the Univ. of Sheffield. It was distribution agnostic and
covered topics such as the file system hierarchy and what's in each directory
tree. Unfortunately, the book's out of print now and I gave away my copy
several years ago. If you can find a copy it's a valuable introduction.

   There's also Matt Walsh and Lar Kaufman's "Running Linux". I have the
second edition (from 1996), so I imagine that it's in the upteenth-gazillion
edition by now. This was the first linux book I read and it gives a very good
overview. The chapter titles include, "Preparing to Install LInux," "Basic
Commands and Concepts," "Essential System Managment," and more. This book,
too, is not distribution-specific so it will work for everyone.

   Powell's Technical Books has a great selection. If you browse amongst them
you're certain to find at least one that covers what you need and that is
written in a way you find easy to follow.

[blatant plug] The fine owners of my "Linux Cookbook" already know the answers 
to all this stuff. A separate /boot partition, located on the first partition 
of the boot drive, lets you remove and install new operating systems without 
needing a "host" or base OS. So you could even remove your original Ubuntu 
installation and still have a functioning boot menu.

Don't move kernels and initrd images, leave them on the first sectors of their 
respective root partitions. Not overwriting the MBR with your subsequent 
installations ensures that the GRUB boot menu remains 
in /boot/boot/grub/menu.lst, so you'll always know where it is, and it won't 
be lost when you delete stuff. It's a bit of a pain, because you'll have to 
create the additional boot menu entries yourself. But if you let subsequent 
Linux installations overwrite it, the boot menu will move around. If you know 
how to boot manually from the GRUB command-line it's pretty easy. (In fact 
you can read any file on any computer with GRUB, regardless of permissions, 
because GRUB operates outside of filesystems.)

I would love to help in whatever way I can. However, I am running a 
small home-based business, building an addition onto the house,  
trying to learn Linux, determined to maintain my 4.0 cume at PSU 
(and yes, I made it again this term -- whew!), and at the same time 
trying to have a social life (riiiight!). And I'm single, live alone, and 
have to do all of the above myself. Time sometimes gets in short 
supply.

Perhaps someone else can create a site to do this. I can help 
financially with creating the domain. I also have no problem with 
someone copying and pasting stuff into the website. And not just 
my ruminations, but input from thousands of other newbies as well. 
Linux is, after all, a group effort.

A more important point is the philosophical perspective. The only 
thing that never changes is that everything changes. That includes 
Linux. It seems abundantly clear to me that, in spite of the desires 
of a few old Linux hands, Linux will get to the desktop. And to do 
so, it will become more user friendly. The Linux we will be using 10 
years from now will bear little resemblance to what we use today. 
For example, the terminal will be all but obsolete. It will still be 
there for the old hands, just as the command line ("DOS prompt") 
still exists in Windows. But few Windows users even know it is 
there, let alone what to do with it. Linux will arrive at the same point.

For most of its history Linux has been playing catch-up to 
'Windows. It is as though the goal is to have everything that 
Windows has. That is not necessarily a bad idea. To carry on, 
Linux must continue to increase market share, and that means 
mostly wooing people from Windows. Being able to offer an easy 
upgrade path with everything available that Windows offers is a 
natural requirement. But we are approaching a point where Linux 
will be at parity with Windows in the user-friendly and application 
department. When that point arrives, Linux will move ahead of 
Windows. There will be things that Linux will offer that Windows will 
not. Yes, many such things already exist -- security, free of cost, 
etc. But I mean utility value -- the sexy things that consumers will 
flock to Linux for. Cool things like free ways to print photographs 
from your digi, free ways to create, buy, store and play your tunes. 
free ways to play your movies -- the media edition of Linux is what 
will sell it to consumers. And cheaper acquisition, deployment and 
training costs will be what will sell it to corporate America. 

And these things generally mean that things must be point and 
click, and documentation must be complete, understandable, and 
readily available from a uniform help button. Man pages simply will 
not do. Web sites with two paragraphs will not do. Clicking on a 
Help button and getting "not yet implemented" will not do. Linux 
programmers will be pressured to create extensive documentation. 
If you're a programmer, get used to the idea. It's going to happen, 
whether you want it to or not. Either you're going to have to create 
the documentation yourself, or you're going to have to outsource it 
to a Linux user who has writing skills.

Another thing that is going to happen is a slowdown in the 
frequency of new releases. Not because development will slow 
down -- if anything it will gain speed as Linux gains market share -- 
but because of stability issues. Geeks can handle installing a new 
version of a program and discovering that it has bugs or needs 
tweaking to work with their existing installation. Consumers 
cannot. Therefore, improved features will be saved up and released 
only every year or so, which will allow much better bug-testing and 
stability for new releases. We are already seeing this with the 
major applications -- OpenOffice.org, Firefox, etc. This will become 
commonplace in Linux.

To arrive at this future shangri-la is essential for the future of Linux. 
If we do not strive toward it, we are doomed. The reason is the 
economics of market share. We have to be big enough to matter, 
else we will never be big enough to matter. Why does Broadcom 
ignore us? We all know the answer. But if our market share was 
25% instead of 5%, would they provide drivers. Damn right, they 
would. 

OK, it's the middle of spring break so I have time to ramble on. But 
it's bedtime, plus I've already created a yawn epidemic here, so I'm 
going to shut up.

thanks for your insights & perspective.  Work prevents me from

Tim,

Care to share? It doesn't sound like too many people have used it on 
this list. I thought about purchasing it, but then did not want to risk 
the money. If I didn't like it I would be out  of some cash.

I agree with most of what Carla said.  

One more thing to consider.  Different distros have different userid
numbering schemes and different program versions.

I'm dual-booting fedora and ubuntu.  Fedora wants to start the userid
numbers at 500, ubuntu starts then at 1000.  You may need to override
the default.

There also seems to be a minor compatibility issue between the versions
of gnome (for example: ubuntu can't find the icon to use for the
trashcan on the desktop).  Next time I'm planning to create a shared
/data partition instead of a shared /home partition, and set up links.

Jon

Has anyone ever taken one of these positions?  I heard the pay is somewhere
in the range of chump change and that the full time people out there treat

They have been doing that since the tech crash.  Hopefully they have 
learned that paying people squat gets you little in return.  I doubt it 
though.

I find myself in need of a contact manager (so I'm told!). The party 
doing the telling assumed that "everyone" uses Outlook. I, of course, 
would much prefer not to use Outlook, and probably can, if whatever I 
come up with can export .csv files to be used to create mailing lists.

The other feature she mentioned is some ability to track communications 
with my contacts.

A Google/Linux search on contact manager turns up Evolution, I-Man, 
Atlas, GNUe, and probably others (I stopped after the first two pages).

Do any of you have experience with these, or other contact managers? I'd 
appreciate your recommendations.

   I currently use jpilot (the Palm PDA desktop, available at
http://www.jpilot.org), and have done so for the past decade. I use the note
feature for each record to track contacts.

   Also, I'm working with the developers of xrms to get their contact manager
working with postgres ('cause I don't like MySQL). This is more of a sales
management/lead tracking/customer relations (whatever that means) application
than is the PDA's addressbook and datebook.

   If you check the archives here you'll see that I went though a lot of
effort to install MySQL and Sugar-CRM. After all that effort, I tried using
it, but never acquired a taste for it. Guess my sweet tooth has disappeared.

   What, specifically, do you need -- or are told that you need -- and why?
That'll help focus replies.

I use evolution at work for similar reasons.  It imports the csv, though
not every aspect, but it's good enough.  Evolution was initially created
to be a mimic of outlook and if I'm not mistaken it was one of the
first, if not the first, to be able to connect directly to an exchange
server with relatively full functionality.  I could be wrong about that
though since I've never had to connect to an exchange server.  (I know,
fortunate, huh?)  ;-)

I've had very good luck contracting at Intel, both in terms of
being well paid and well treated. Of course the pay part depends
a lot on what job shop you're working through. I'd be happy to
compare notes off list.

That could be useful, as I will probably be getting a Palm one of these

This is probably the right idea.

The new business is real estate (I got my broker's license a few weeks 
ago). Tracking potential buyers and sellers will probably be the bulk of 
my use of the tool. The recommendation was to start creating a list in 
Excel and then import it into whatever contact manager I end up with. 
I'm still getting my feet wet. I'm sure I'll figure out more of what the 
tool needs to do as I go along. I'm assuming the usual stuff, name, 
address, phone number(s), and e-mail will do for a start. I notice that 
one of the tools (Evolution, I think) has entries for birthdays, and 
other personal stuff that a good salesman would want to respond to. I'm 
not as yet sure just how much of that I'll really need.

Somewhat of an aside: I was disappointed that the local Multiple Listing 
  Service site requires the use of IE 5.5 or above. However, I've 
learned that the reason is that the service was built back before 
broadband was common and relies on active-x for much of its 
functionality. They tell me that they are working on a replacement site 
that will be able to run on other browsers.

I was pleased to discover that Oregon Realty's web site will work in 
other browsers. I can work in it with Konqueror or Firefox. Also, I get 
an Oregon Realty e-mail address that forwards to one of my own 
addresses. I tested it and looked at the headers. I was surprised and 
pleased to see that my message passed through SpamAssassin in its travels.

Thanks. I'll try installing it and see what I think. I'll probably try 
out a few before deciding.

   Aha!

   While you can probably work well with a PDA for this, take a look at xrms
and sugar-crm (Google will give you the URLs). That may be more to your
liking.

   I've become very fond on my cell phone/PDA. I have all my phone numbers
with the phone, can look up information in the middle of a call, and don't
have to enter numbers tediously, as I did with previous phones. For someone
like you, that may be the best tool, and the jpilot desktop works seamlessly
with it.

   My hardware problems were almost certainly caused by a failing CPU. I
replaced the Athlon this morning with a borrowed Sempron and the system has
been as solid as we would expect. Most importantly, I was able to build a 2.6
kernel without locking up the machine, the first indication of a problem last
autumn. As a matter of fact, I built 2.6.16 twice because I mis-configured it
the first time. I also built 2.4.32, which is what's currently running.

   Now, the question is whether the failed CPU was a fluke (my first thought)
and buying another OEM processor will be OK (3 month warranty by AMD), or try
to find the more expensive "PIB" version with the official AMD heat sink and
fan which comes with a 36 month warranty. I've not had a CPU go bad in the
20+ years I've used them, so this is a new experience.

   While I have your attention, I'll ask two other questions:

   1) Why are the 2.4.32 modules not gzipped, and why are the 2.6.16 modules
named *.ko?

   2) Despite sound capabilities declared in .config, and sound modules built,
I have no /proc/asound directory under any kernel now. Therefore, aumix
doesn't run and there's no sound available. The ALSA sound trouble shooting
guide assumes that /proc/asound exists. What are my options here?

   While the CPU swap seems to have solved the problem of system lockups, the
fileutil 'df' still seg faults. All other fileutils (e.g., ls, dir, du,
mkdir, cp, mv) work just fine. Google turns up 80K hits, but I don't see
anything that seems to apply to my situation.

   Any ideas of what to do?

Another equipment limitation: there is a companion program from the 
maker of the lockbox that somehow ties in a PDA. The limitation is that 
it only works with Palm Zire 31 or a Tungsten E2. At this point, I don't 
know why. There's something to do with a clamshell holder that both the 
PDA and the electronic lockbox key fit in together. I'll have to see 
them in action to understand more about them. There's a class I can 
take. I'm hoping I can take the class before I go get the PDA. The other 
unfortunate thing is that the E2 only works with Win 2000 and up. (I 
haven't checked it's Linux compatibility, yet.) I don't really want to 
get an XP machine, so I'd have to go with a Zire.

Still much to learn.

What makes you think the modules *should* be gzipped?  All 2.6.X
kernel modules have the .ko extension, which I imagine was to be able
to distiguish a loadable kernel module from a standard object file,
since both are generated in the process of building modules.

/proc/asound only shows up when the "snd" module is loaded, which
should be a dependency for any sound driver modules.  Sounds (no pun
intended) like you don't have any drivers loaded.

I've had varying degrees of luck contracting at Intel.  Sometimes, I got
re-optioned for up to three years in a row.  Other times, I got arrested and
convicted of three felony charges.  Most of the time, it was something
in the middle.

   Don't know about 2.6 modules, but all prior 2.x modules on my systems have
been gzipped. Even the ones installed with the Slackware-10.2 stock 2.4.31
kernel were compressed. That's why I wondered why the ones I built here
weren't.

   There were a couple of drivers loaded, but not named 'snd.' Guess I'll go
look for that one.

   Well, no. First, I run reiserfs on this box and it's been rebooted so often
lately that I need new soles and heels on it.

I wouldn't worry about getting a warranty for your CPU.  I think it's quite
unlikely that you will see a CPU fail in the 3 to 36 month window.  You
just happened to be unlucky this time.  That said, I typically get the
PIB package because: 1. I'm not overclocking, and thus I don't need a
heatsink the size of a small car, and 2. the included fan is likely to be
of good quality.  I typically use standard heatsink compound rather than
the included thermal pad, but that's just my own personal preference.  I'm
sure the thermal interface material is fine, or AMD/Intel wouldn't ship it.

That doesn't sound good.  I'd switch to single user and run fsck.

   I don't overclock, either. Since I already have two heatsinks with good
fans (yes, they're the size of an original mini-Cooper) I don't need
another one; I haven't even found the PIB version on PriceWatch or at Newegg.
Everyone's selling the OEM version. The tube of heatsink goop I bought at
Radio Shack seems to be doing the job, so I'll take your advice and continue
to use it.

galen,

   I was under the impression that 'telinit 1' not only switched to single
user mode, but also remounted filesystems read only. I was wrong. So, I'll
have to remount each one read only first.

   Back in a while.

   And here I am. Despite reading the mount man page, I'm not getting the
results I want.

   As root, I type 'mount -t reiserfs -o remount ro /dev/hda1', but then
'reiserfsck --fix-fixable /dev/hda1' fails; it tells me that the partition is
mounted writable so it won't check it.

   Instead, I type 'mount -t reiserfs -o remount ro /usr/local', then run
'reiserfsck --fix-fixable /usr/local'; I'm told the superblock is gone and I
need to run reiserfsck --rebuild-sb. That fails; can't find a superblock to
rebuild.

   It seemed so straight-forward. What've I missed?

Thanks,

Rich

Message-ID: <442C4928.9040708@spek.org>

Hello,
  I'm trying to make a copy of a directory tree containing a large
number of very small files, and it's taking forever, as in 2 hours and
counting.  Is there a "fast" way to do this?

  I estimate that there is about 6 million files (I'm still waiting for
the file count to come back), most files are < 1KB, some directories
contain maybe 60K files.  I need to make a copy of it so I can "thin"
the files by several orders of magnitude, and I want to make sure I
don't "over thin" the original.

thanks,
Brent

I don't know where you get the idea from that kernel modules should be gzipped or bzipped, but they are not (neither under 2.4 nor under 2.6).

If you are talking about the initrd - yes sure you can compress that. Doing a `make modules_install` under /usr/src/linux does not compress any module, and trying to gzip a file below /lib/modules/`uname -` will result in the message:

WARNING: Module /lib/modules/2.6.16/kernel/fs/binfmt_aout.ko.gz is not an elf object

and not load the module. This is the standard way of installing modules. even rh and suse do it this way.

you can compress an initrd, but not individual modules.

You want -o remount,ro

Citing the manpage: 

       -o     Options  are  specified with a -o flag followed by a comma sepa-
              rated string of options. [...]

Note: "comma separated" in particular.

So then, should my kernel and initrd images for the Ubuntu install 
actually be in the /boot partition, instead of somewhere in Ubuntu's / 
partition?  Are they only there because it was the first OS installed? 
If I end up wiping Ubuntu altogether, I can have just the grub folder 
all by its lonesome in the /boot partition?

Actually, it was a lot easier than I thought it would be -- sometimes 
things like this sound more difficult than they are.  I installed Debian 
Etch and had it install grub on it's own root partition.  Then I booted 
back into Ubuntu, mounted the Debian root partition, and copied the 
Debian kernel/initrd info from the /boot/grub/menu.lst there to the 
grub/menu.lst in the boot partition.

Well, that would be even easier!  But if you've booted from the grub 
command-line, can you edit the /boot grub/menu.list?  Or do you still 
have to boot into one OS or another to be able to edit the menu?

Thanks for the explanation -- much obliged.

Two causes come to mind:

First, the optimistic guess is you've simply got filesystem damage. `df`
simply gets misloaded and this results in something that cannot run.
`touch /forcefsck` will do the job, or you can also manually force `fsck`
on all your filesystems if you know how (remount read-only, `fsck -f`,
there are subtlties here). Given that you had a flaky processor, in all
probability, you've got *some* filesystem damage, so this is the first
test no matter what.

Second, alas more probable from the symptoms, you've got filesystem
damage in the data areas. Grab distribution packages from a clean source
and reinstall.

Due to the MS/Perma-temp ruling, you cannot contract at Intel for 3 years
in a row anymore. For the past couple years you could contract for 18
months and then had to take a break for 6 months (or else get hired
permanent by Intel). They've recently lowered it to 12 months contracting
followed by a 6 month gap.

They don't pay very well, though the contracts are pretty long. If you're
in the situation, feel free to take the money and run. Don't expect to be
there long-term though.

I have been wrestling with this today.  I have three large partitions on 
my second hard drive I want to share between all OS'es, but the my UID 
in Ubuntu is 1001 and my UID in Debian is 1000, so I couldn't write to 
the partitions from Debian with my user account.  I chowned the 
partitions by username, rather than UID, since I have the same username 
in both OSes.  I haven't yet booted back into Ubuntu to see if I still 
have full access, so I don't know if this method will work.

Ubuntu puts the Gnome trashcan on the bottom panel, so perhaps it
doesn't include a desktop icon for the trashcan.  Seems odd to me that 
they'd have left it out altogether, though.  With Debian's default Gnome 
install, the trashcan's on the desktop, but you still have the option of 
putting it on the panel.  I'm getting a little frustrated with Ubuntu; 
it seems to limit choices and options more than necessary, at least as 
compared with plain ol' Debian.  But I'll wait for Dapper to decide 
whether to keep it around or delete it off my computer; meantime, I 
don't know if I'll be using it much.

I've never shared /home partitions, that sounds like living dangerously!
I've made small 2GB home partitions for each OS, mostly for 
configuration files and whatever else might be useful for one but not 
the other(s).  But I keep the bulk of my own data on separate shared 
partitions.

It'd be helpful to know what technique you're currently using. :-)

Me, I'm a sucker for tar and pipes:

# the traditional way
tar cf - dirA dirB | ( cd /dest/dir && tar xf - )

# the gnu way
tar c dirA dirB | tar xC /dest/dir

Elliott,

   Just ran 'reiserfsck --fix-fixable' on three /dev/hda partitions and one
/dev/hdc partition; all reported no corruption.

   I tried to find in which package 'df' is located. The search of the
Slackware package repository found nothing when I checked for the file. So,
I'm going to post on comp.os.linux.slackware and see what I can learn.

   All the other utilities work just fine. It's only this one that seems to be
broken. Very strange ... and annoying.

Thank you,

Look at MANIFEST.bz2 on your Slackware CD... the file is located in 
a/coreutils

And did you mean aols or cols?

When you say "just fine" do you mean that included images are

I'm using ps2pdf to convert from .ps to .pdf.  It's merely a script

don't understand.  I know nothing about gs.  I was hoping someone

   Well, the replacement Athlon XP+3200/400 has been ordered, the system is
stable, and all utilities are once again working. The fortnight from hell

: How are you converting it to a pdf file? 

with `ps2pdf14' as the original message says.
`ps2pdf14' is just a script (on my machine) that uses `gs' to do
the actual conversion.

: Are you printing to pdf? or Are 

No.

: you using a conversion utility? 

Yes.

: I would start by printing to a pdf printer

Don't know what you mean by "a pdf printer".
When I print a .pdf file with, say acroread, to the printers available to
me at work, it converts (I think) to postscript and ships that
to the printer. At all events, the .pdf file is 8 times smaller than
the .ps file so _I know_ that lossy compression is being done.
That ends up ruining my results.

: and then print it to a file...

I don't know what you mean.  The output of latex is .dvi
>From .dvi I use `dvips' to convert to .ps.  This is all detailed
in my original message.

: if you can do that(?). I am not 
: real familiar with latex, but am pretty familiar with pdf and postscript.

Can you tell me how to use `gs' (ghostscript) to convert a .ps file
(with lots of images) to .pdf so that compression is either off or lossless.

Please note: The final  paper must be in .pdf format for publication.
I don't want all my results ruined by jpeg compression.

   What I meant is that all the files that I've included as .eps within a
LaTeX document have reproduced clearly and legibly in the resulting .pdf
file. The largest I've done have been about 800K, and greyscale, not full
color.

   According to one Web page I found, ps2pdf can accept Adobe Distiller
arguments; e.g., <</CompressPages false >> to turn off compression. Exactly
what the syntax is I don't know; now I can't read 'man ps2pdf.' Sigh.

   But, that string should help.

Once again, I feel compelled to point out that "Linux" isn't a 
monolithic entity like Windows.  I've little doubt you're right that 
Linux -- some Linux, some form of Linux -- will make it to the desktop 
in a bigger way that it has yet.  But that doesn't mean we'll still call 
it "Linux," nor does it mean the "Linux" we know today becomes obsolete. 
  You could say that "BSD has made it to the desktop" because OS X rides 
on a Darwin subsystem and Darwin is a modified BSD.  Yet there is still 
FreeBSD, NetBSD, etc. -- OS X doesn't preclude them.  It seems possible 
to me that something like that will happen with Linux, an OS or two or 
three featuring a mix of proprietary userlands and a Linux (or something 
very similar) core.  That is, unless Stallman manages to prevent it.  It 
doesn't seem like Linus Torvalds has the same agenda as Stallman, so I 
don't think the latter will be able to.

I think what Congress, WIPO, and the cartels do will have a much bigger 
impact on the future of home computing than what Broadcom supports or 
doesn't support.  Either the future opens up and Linux gains or the 
future is locked down and the only thing for sale is "trusted" hardware 
that will refuse to run anything not MPAA-RIAA-BSA approved.  And even 
then, Linux might not go away entirely -- TiVo runs on Linux, after all.

   Several of the GhostScript man pages produce this error when I try to read
them:

man ps2pdf

   What's strange, is that ps2pdf.1 is in /usr/local/man/man1/ and there is no
ps2pdf.1.bz2 in /usr/local/man/cat1/. No wonder it fails. Has anyone
encountered this before?

   Other man pages display as expected.

Often it is, because the reads and writes can happen independently of 
one another. I think cp has to do all of its operations atomically, 
which can really slow stuff down over a network connection.

Here are some test averages, where /usr/share is a local drive 
and ~/timetest/ is NFS-mounted:

[heinlein]$ cd /usr/share/doc

[heinlein]$ time cp -a [abcde]* ~/timetest/

real    0m11.854s
user    0m0.078s
sys     0m1.824s

[heinlein]$ time tar c [abcde]* | tar xC ~/timetest/

real    0m9.043s
user    0m0.148s
sys     0m1.364s

The timings will vary depending on network traffic and load on the 
file server, but in general tar is 20% faster. My hunch is that gobs 
of small files would tilt the equation even further in tar's 
direction.

   TeX and LaTeX has been doing typesetting for decades. Not only does it
provide ligatures, but the basic unit for typesetting is the paragraph, not
the line. If you want the easy-to-use GUI, use LyX.

   More experimentation shows this happens on a bunch of man pages, not just
gs related ones. What's happening is that bzip2 is trying to make a
compressed version of the existing page, and failing.

   Why is bzip2 trying to make a compressed copy in ../cat1/ from ../man1/?
And, what could make it fail?

The link points to a writeup about Graphite, which looks like it will
really clean up the font mess for Linux.  I can make good looking
documents Linux-to-Linux, or Linux-to-Printer, but this looks like it
will be a good open source framework for text anything-to-anything,
which means that someday soon we should be able to import and export 
documents to Those Other Applications and retain the look of the
document.  The article suggests M$ may not play along, or at least
lag, but their cooperation is not necessary.

Pete, thanks for the good news - brightened up my day!

I'm guessing that tar preserves permissions and symlinks in this case, 
but what about hardlinks between the directories being copied from one 
fs to another?  (quick test... the answer is yes)

I discovered yesterday that cp -a is all you need to migrate a dirvish 
vault to another drive (and here I thought those hardlinks were going 
to be trouble), but I guess tar does the trick just as well!

The nVidia Quadro NVS 285 has been treating me very well.  Switching 
virtual desktops with lots of windows is very fast.  Rock solid text 
display, no ghosting or artifacts.  No problems setting up Xinerama or 
with driver compatibility under RHEL 4.

Replacing the heat sink on an AMD processor violates the warranty.

   Even if it doesn't come with a heat sink? How interesting.

I can't say too much about the Real Estate stuff, but the Tungsten E2
(which I have) does just fine syncing with JPilot and Linux.  You CANNOT
access it as a USB device unfortunately to remotely delete files like I
could with my old Handspring unfortunately.  (This allowed me to kill
"misbehaving" applications that weren't always compatible.)

***Secure Your Linux Server

rock-solid security is out of your reach, though. Aaron Brazell shows

ensure success? Andrew Stellman and Jennifer Greene introduce five basic
principles in their new book, "Applied Software Project Management," that
will help any project succeed, open source or proprietary. The authors
detail these principles in this article.

***What Is Java
Everyone knows what Java is, right? Interpreted code, applets,

vibrant and independent, and developers are taking the best ideas from
other languages and frameworks and bringing them to Java. In this
article, ONJava editor Chris Adamson tries to reset old assumptions
about Java to fit modern realities.

You might want to see if you can get on the file server and transfer
directly from there.  My guess is that the slowness is caused by
latency in requesting each file.  I am pretty sure NFS requires a
round-trip message for each file; this adds up for a million files. 
Reading lots of small files is faster on a local disk because Linux
does caching of file metadata and blocks.

You'll need to run `usermod -u 1000 <username>` on your Ubuntu
installation to get Ubuntu's passwd file synchronized. You can do a
blanket change of the behavior by changing UID_MIN in /etc/login.defs
(odd location, likely historic).

Why does that sound like living dangerously? The distribution shouldn't
ever write there. You can generate config files that one doesn't like,
but the distribution tools /shouldn't/ do anything nasty without asking
you (since those are *your* files, and you're free to modify them).

Thanks to some off-list help from Rich Shepard I discovered a solution:


ps2pdf14  -dEncodeColorImages=false -dEncodeGrayImages=false   <file.ps>

This prevents all encoding (compression) of images.  This is
acceptable.  I'd still like to _losslessly_ compress them w/in the .pdf.
But this, at least, solved the problem.

Thanks Rich.

I *used* to have great luck with the Matrox multi-head cards under
Linux, but I do not know the status of more recent cards.  The last
one I used was a G550.

I had less good luck with the nVidia drivers, but I didn't spend much
time trying to get them to work well, and the system was a laptop
connected to a monitor with a different display resolution.

Thirded. It's funny; I've been seeing this same sort of stuff from
ponderous new users for years now--I even recall espousing many of those
notions myself.  The thing I've learned--or rather, keep learning, is
that some things are just difficult and require work and patience.
Changing operating systems is hard, learning a foreign tongue is hard,
entering a new career is hard.  C'est la vie.

With the distribution diversion that is occuring, there seem to be a lot
of distributions now, how is anyone supposed to compare them?  What is
being done to keep all these distributions reasonably standardized?

A lot of people are pro Debian and yet others are pro CentOS. I'm not 
intending to start an annoyingly long thread here, but why?  If anyone
can explain why Ubuntu is popular, that interests me as well.
  
Is 300 the number of Linux distros these days, or are there more?
If the Linux community continues to fragment, will development stall?
With an average of at least 3 to 5 distros in use on this list, to
what degree can we all be talk about the same thing?



Aside:

A HOWTO that annoyed me on NFS root claims that rc.sysinit is adequately
documented for someone to modify it correctly.  WRONG!  I halt to cut the
links to killall, not documented.  Don't know why that script doesn't work 
right when root is nfs mounted.  The system that I'm nfsrooting is Fedora 
Core 1 without any updates applied to it.  What is the best way to learn
how to read Redhat and Fedora init scripts so that I can look into replacing
them with ones that are more intelligible?



Guess I need to learn more about rsync and go for it ;-)  I've never used
rsync.

Greetings,
I'm new to this list (but not to Portland) so my appologies if this has
been mentioned already...

"Mastering Linux" was the book that got me through the learning curves.
I'm mainly a NetBSD guy these days but I still occasionally crack this book
open since much of the userland stuff is the same.  I guess it's gotten a
bit dated but for someone starting out and interested in learning the
command line it's still a pretty good reference.

Cheers,
Jeff Woodall

Long term, very much a danger. At the moment though there are lots of
distributions, they're tightly clustered in 2 groups. There are a number
of outliers, such as SuSE, and Slackware, but not many of those. Pretty
well all the recent new ones are varients of Debian or RedHat/Fedora;
while SuSE and Slackware split off more than 5 years ago. Though the
scripts are pretty varied, they're still running off the same core code.
I'd say we're safe for the next 5 years, at which point another
reassessment will be needed.

So, you're doing this on a dare, to show it will take more than 5 minutes
to get cracked?

Directly to the question, I'd guess the writer is assuming more knowledge
of scripting than you've got. The complexity isn't there to make it hard,
it is there because it is a complex task. I doubt you'll be able to make
them more intelligible, without a major rewrite exclusively for you. I
doubt you'll find it worth the effort.

I find the DVD torrents to be very handy-- no more disk-swapping!  You
can find the .torrent files alongside the CD-ROM ISOs on the mirrors.

CentOS replaced White Box Linux as my preferred distro a while back. 
I really like running the same OS instance for years without a forced
upgrade, and they do an excellent job of turning the Red Hat
patches/updates around quickly.

Ok, dangerously is too strong a word.  It's just that sharing a home 
partition opens up the possiblility of incompatible config files, and 
yes I'm sure there are more-or-less straightforward workarounds or fixes 
for issues that arise.  It seems simpler to me just to give each distro 
its own small home partition.  I've seen this advice time and again on 
newbie-oriented message boards and mailing lists, always in response to 
people who were having problems because they were sharing a home 
partition between distros.

I used to be a big fan of the Matrox cards but have found the newer cards,
which I installed to get dual DVI / dual VGA, are NOT at all well 
supported under LInux.
They require using the proprietary driver to get full features but those 
drivers have been
very buggy (for me) and have not been updated in forever.

I wound up switching to nVidia based cards and have been much, much happier.

Please clarify.

Dual what resolution monitors? LCD?

Dual single-link DVI ports to run two monitors?

A dual-link DVI to run large resolution 21, 24, 30 inch, high resolutin 
LCD's?

I strongly recomemend the nVidia cards. 

I have had good luck running dual VGA and dual DVI on GeForce 5700, 
5900, 6200, and 7800 based boards.
If you are, or might in the future, run higher resolution (1600x1200, 
1920x1200, 2560x1600) LCD monitors
I would recommend jumping to the newer 7800 or 7900 cards.  Note most 
7800 cards are dual DVI but most
are only some support dual-link DVI and almost all the second DVI is 
single-link.  Also true for the lower end 7900 cards.
Some, but not all, of the 7900GTX cards appear to support 2 dual-link 
DVI (that is dual Dell 30" 2560x1600 monitors :) )

I typically use cpio pass-through

$ mkdir destdir
$ cd srcdir
$ find * | cpio -pvdmu srcdir

If you are going to repeatedly make this same copy to archive or mirror 
the original source,
I would strongly recommend using rsync.  I'd use cpio for the initial 
copy, then update the destdir
from the srcdir thereafter using rsync

Before asking PLUG I had never heard of dual-link, single-link.
Up to now just a serial port is all I have ever looked for, since
until now I've done all my GUI stuff via a dedicated Xterm.

The first monitor I'm stuck with for now

   LCD Gateway 900G 19" 1280x1024 DVI and VGA Inputs

The second one that I'm trying to convince the powers
to be is a

   Samsung SyncMaster 204T 20" 1600x1200
   http://www.samsung.com/Products/Monitor/LCD_Digital/LS20BRBABXAA.asp

The PC I'm stuck with has only a analogue VGA output but has unused
PCI-e slots, at least one is x16.

A card a PLUG member reccommened is the

   Nvidia Quadro NVS 285
   http://www.nvidia.com/object/IO_14605.html

I've even offered to swap the 19" Gateway for a whatever the default
17" is where I work.

All of my local hosting experience has been bad, they either suck or

low-to-medium-end hosting to some national company.  If you can suffer

Get your cans of fuel and matches ready.

...

What are your thoughts on SCSI verses SATA RAID?

Assume RAID cards not software RAID.

Cost is not the biggest issue though the cost savings of SATA mean 
more/bigger drives.

SCSI typically has a longer warranty ( 5 years ).


So let the flames begin!  :-)

Not to fuel, but there are a lot of really crappy
performance SCSI RAID5 adapters out there. I've
not looked at what is being made now days, but it
seems ever since Adaptec bought out the competitors
performance gains have not been that great.

My 'gold standard' is raid5 at 'wire speed'. It
can be done but is expensive and so far have only
seen it in a fibre channel array.

I'm a SCSI bigot from way back, but the price point on SATA is just
too compelling these days.  A while back SATA crossed the "costs half
as much for the same capacity" mark, which is important since it means
you can now own a mirrored pair of SATA drives for about the same
price as a single SCSI drive.

A quick Pricewatch search on 5-year warranty drives (Seagate) at 300GB
shows this today:

SCSI: $500
SATA: $120

Based on this approximation, I could own *four* SATA drives for the
price of a single SCSI drive, under the same warranty.  The SCSI drive
is 10,000RPM, and the SATA 7200RPM, but with four drives I can now run
a striped/mirror arrangement ("RAID-10") and those two pairs of
7200RPM drives will outperform the 10,000RPM drive due to the RAID
involved.

I frequently hear RAID rebuild time as a reason the individual drives
need to be more reliable.  The probability of having a second drive
fail during the 2-3 hours (at most) it might take to rebuild onto a
hot spare (hey, you can afford one now!) is very low.  Far lower than
the probability of a second SCSI drive failure during the 3-5 days it
will take to order a new drive, since you couldn't afford a hot spare.

As painful as it is for a "quality-conscious" person such as myself to
think about, once RAID comes into play, the "I" (inexpensive) is the
important part.  Unless the failure rate is truly ridiculous (and the
warranty prevents that) the cheaper, the better.

I am using http://www.webhostfreaks.com I am pretty satisfied. I have 
the cheap $7.50 per month plan. They have plans for as little as $4 per 
month. You can take a look at the specs at 
http://www.webhostfreaks.com/starter-hosting.php

I would reccomend them for just about any service needed.

All of the new ones come with a heat sink.  (As far as I know.  All the

Then you are purchasing a 'boxed' retail processor, whereas the other 
person is purchasing an 'OEM' processor. OEM's you need to purchase a 
separate heat sink and fan Retails come with whatever the manufacturer 
likes to send.

It is interesting that if you compare the spec files between CentOS/RHEL 
and Fedora, they are almost exactly the same for most critical apps. 
Sometimes there is a version difference, but not always.

Pete, Steve;

Thanks for the thoughts.  I'm starting my research.  Your ideas have 
helped me focus a bit.

I too have been a SCSI guy for years ( when build servers anyway ) but 
the price difference is making it hard.  There is also the SCSI attached 
SATA option so I'd get the SCSI speed and the SATA cheap.

Again thanks for the input.

Why RAID vs. non-RAID?  Your question should really just be SATA vs. 
SCSI, as RAID changes the answer.  Many good SATA RAID cards can be as 
expensive as some SCSI RAID cards.  The same can be said for some drives 
too.  Though it's very easy to go through the roof on SCSI components.

My suggestion is this:
   Seagate SATA 7200.9's w/ 5 year warranty for the budget
   Western Dig SATA Raptor's for the serious SATA attempt (5yr wnty. too)
   Seagate Barracuda's for the low end SCSI
   Seagate Cheetah's for the high ($$$)

I don't have time to get into RAID cards but Promise would be the 
consumer (low end) brand.  Most decent SATA RAID cards start at around 
$400 ~ $500.  The Promise SX4 I used a while back didn't even support 
running more than one card in the same system, this may not be the case 
with more recent cards.

As it turns out I managed to "corrupt" part of the dirtree when working
on it by resetting a bunch of timestamps on files by forgetting to use
the -a option on cp..

Which means I was able to try the tar method, and it does seems quite a
bit faster.  I didn't actually time it though, I always think it
would've been cool to start timing something 30 minutes into some
non-interruptable process.  This time, instead of going to my
local-network copy of the directory tree I decided to goto the one true
master that lies across the country and downloaded that over a SSH
tunnel with tar which was definably faster than scp'ing it.

thanks,
Brent

Aren't a lot of the cheaper/low-end SATA "RAID" controllers actually
software raid and/or RAID 0 and 1 only?

Since CentOS has been much discussed here recently, I thought many here 
might be interested in this:

http://www.centos.org/modules/news/article.php?storyid=127

It's one of the funniest things I've read in a while, especially when 
the Tuttle City Manager claims to have "22 years in computer systems 
engineering and operations."  I just hope he was never responsible for 
anything like bridge or tunnel construction.

Any given RHEL release these days is usually based strongly on a 
certain Fedora release. RHEL 4 is a trimmed and buttoned-down version 
of Fedora Core 3. RHEL 5 will probably be based on FC 5.

Fedora, with a more frequent release schedule, will usually leap ahead 
of RHEL early in the latter's lifecycle. Right now, for instance, FC 5 
includes some cool new SELinux config options that RHEL users won't 
see until RHEL 5 comes out.

The other fairly obvious difference is that Fedora Core contains a 
*lot* more packages than RHEL. Sure, there are third-party 
repositories for some of it, but RHEL is limited so Red Hat can make a 
reasonable stab at supporting the entire package set for its paying 
customers.

It all depends on how many disks you want to use. The 3ware cards are 
quite well supported under Linux, and the two-disk models like the 
8006-2LP (good for simple RAID-1) can be found under $150.

Please tell us a bit about the project.
The best hosting solution depends on your needs and your
project's qualifications.

Is it Open Source or otherwise not-for-profit?
A lot of people will give these projects free hosting - sometimes with 
significant bandwidth and lots of freedom  - even root passwords.

Will the project require significant resources?  bandwidth? disk? CPU?

Is reasonable uptime good enough or does it have to be up all the time?

Are there backup issues?  How secret is any of the data?

All of this and more affects your server choice.


                                          Sincerely,

You can buy a virtual Linux machine with root access for $20/month .
That may be more power than you need, but it permits you to do all
sorts of things that a user account does not.

I used pdxcolo.net for a year, and was happy with them until they got
caught in an interface upgrade struggle.  The struggle is over now,
the new interface looks pretty good.  They are now vcolo.com .

During the struggle, I switched to rimuhosting.com .  They are located
in New Zealand, host out of Dallas TX, and have a service center in 
Cambridge UK.  They are more fussy about what they let you do, but they
are also quicker to respond to service requests.  They are not "local",
but the round trip ping time to Dallas is only 37 milliseconds longer
(gotta love that speed'o'light!), so they are both fairly quick.

Both offer many different distros.  I used Fedora Core at pdxcolo,
and now I am using Centos 4 (a clone of Redhat Enterprise 4, sorta
like Fedora Core 3) at rimuhosting.

I will be talking about Offsite Virtual Colocation Servers at the 
Advanced Topics meeting on Monday April 17 at Jax, so that is a good
time to find out how a person can manage an offsite virtual server
with little knowledge (Moi?).

If you choose either one, tell them I sent you.  It earns me brownie
points (which I use up with lame-ass experiments).

Oh yes, I am indeed on this list.  Anyone want to collaborate on it
with me?  Funny that I happen to be writing this from San Jose...

A favored pointer:
http://www.pacificcable.com/DVI_Tutorial.htm

One interesting factor is you can drive very high resolution displays
with single-link DVI, you just push the refresh rate through the floor.
The trick of course, that with LCDs a lower refresh rate isn't a major
problem. With CRTs refresh rate is very much an issue, but there you're
likely using the analog path, not the digital path.

Now one issue is, "who the heck is the idiot who thought not supporting
high resolutions such as 1920x1536?" Why oh why did they design a digital
system that couldn't drive *existing* monitors?  :'-(

I was looking at the 9500SX but haven't done any pricing yet.  I'm sure 
my eyes will get real wide but this looked to have the best long term 
potential.

The software we'll be running on it is limited by I/O and sort-of RAM. 
The sample data we sent the vendor ran quite nicely on a run-of-the-mill 
Power book G4 with external/attached drive and 768 MByte RAM.  To get 
the processing speed we need I'm looking at a dual ( or quad ) processor 
with 2-4 GByte RAM.  From what I'm seeing on the 3ware site the SATA 
RAID would be ideal.  There is an amount of data issue also so the 
bigger RAID with SATA drives starts to make a bit more sense.



Thanks,
Rod

Have you personally run a 7800? The reason I ask is that the Dell 
30" widescreen LCD, which will do 2560 x 1600, seems to need 
the 7800 cards. At least Dell lists three of them for sale on the 
same page with the monitor:

http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&l=en&
s=dhs&cs=19&sku=3007WY3&category_id=4009

I've asked around on various forums and have yet to find anyone 
who is actually using one of these with Linux. I could call Dell or 
nVidia, of course, but reports from an end-user are way more 
credible than what a sales droid will tell me.

I'm planning on building myself a new Linux-only desktop, and this 
monitor will be its crown jewel. The rest of the stuff is open to 
negotiation -- its end point being to get this monitor producing 
properly at 2560 x 1600 under Linux, and preferably Ubuntu-64.

Another question is why I always insist on being cutting edge.

Wait ... don't answer that.

As others have noted, if you're looking for I/O speed, stay away from
the low end hardware "RAID" cards.

It may be worth looking at Linux software RAID since it's quite
snappy-- at least run a quick test on your planned hardware with
software RAID before spending big $$$$ on good RAID cards.

You may also be able to extract some additional performance out of
your hardware RAID card(s) by running software RAID-0 (striping)
across the top of them.

This is true, though the centosplus repository and rpmforge go a long
way towards closing this gap.
